Tucson it's my first time to be in your land America America I come to the message at the age of 20. and the first book that I bumped myself into in the pastor's Library was the man the book that the father ministry here had written or he has written the acts of the prophet I read that book from Cava to Cava [Music] I have read the messages of the prophet and at times I feel touched I cry I whip I read that book and I wept and from then on I developed the [Music] I wanted to meet him I wanted to meet Pastor Green say Lord if I can meet this man [Music] I didn't know that one day I'll get to America [Music] I started following his testimones and his teachings and this opening came that I'm coming to the James show in Tucson I went to the Tabernacle I was alone and I was there for two hours and I prayed I said Lord if I go to Tucson [Music] I'll make Tucson Tabernacle my home Church I didn't know that brother Peterson would meet me welcoming and I didn't know that the man here is now the pastor of this church rather than has worked very closely with my pastor in the country when he was a voice of God our pastor has been the manager for several years he started that library in his house that's where when I started staying with him I was I could be in the library back the books and I told the Lord that when I go to Tucson I want to go to the Tabernacle before I go to sleep and that is exactly how the Lord made it with brother Peterson that I was brought here [Music] he brought me here and I had time to thank the Lord here I thank you pasta for receiving me [Music] I see so much love among you here [Music] I have found a family [Music] when brother Johnson was preaching that testimony the pastor gave here is not a small testimony I saw on a Sunday when he was looking at the quotation how he was troubled in the spirit I'm a minister and I sat there I just said Lord help the pastor I think he left this puppet with that heavy head nice on his art and brother Johnson he goes to pray he picks up everything that the pastor wanted to say just to come in to show that there is God unit of purpose in the church I appreciate of Who You Are I appreciate the elders brother Aaron and all the brothers here that since the going out of your pastor you have remained strong you have kept the faith you have allowed this atmosphere to continue in the church [Music] and I pray that God will bless our pastor and you give him strength my pastor called me after they spoke he called me and he has instructed me I know that man make him your pastor and stay under his ministry in Tucson so I wanted to say to the pastor and to the brothers all the years that God months weeks that you allow me to stay in your country Tucson Tabernacle share remain my home Church [Music]

Sammy Marriott we're going to have a memorial service for him a celebration of his life that will be on Saturday March 18th it's on the branhamtabernacle.com website um I'm sorry the Tucson Tabernacle yeah I uh I was thinking about brother Zan brother uh uh from Zambia and I was thinking about brother Ronnie kapisha your pastor brother let me tell you brother Ronnie kapisha he is a precious precious brother I think he's got at least one Church of at least a thousand people I'd say right and he's just always working for the Lord he's doing he's just he's a true man of God he's got a great character and you don't build character like brother Ronnie capisha has without trials without tribulations without Hard Times brother Ronnie's been through it and it is just uh it's good it was good to hear from Brother Ronnie and um like I said my mind's on him and he's just a tremendous brother has done just so much um so anyways uh Brother Sam Marriott's celebration of life will be here March 18th um brother eleazer Castillo we had him last month have scheduled him to come in on Sunday March the 26th so I really think a lot of also brother Eliezer he's I believe he's a young young man filled with the Holy Spirit I think he's only 31 years old but wow is he is he something special um again I'll put that on the Tabernacle website and then for tonight uh for communion there's uh at least one that may not be able to be with us at sister Mercy she's in her 90s and she says she doesn't know if she can hold her balance and that she's going to try to get to service but if she can't get to service we're going to take communion there and sister Angela put you on the job maybe maybe someone else um but uh if you know anybody that's in the hospital or that that by no means can make it we want the people to come because this is where we should take communion but if you simply can't then we'll be taking that um the communion to the people sister Eva it's good to see you my sister God bless you welcome I am I was talking with uh brother Ed yesterday I think it was and he he walked in and he had he had a phone and he says here somebody wants to talk to you and he let me talk to brother Nathaniel his son and uh we just had the best conversation he shared some really really nice testimonies and then I guess they talked a little bit later and brother Ed shared a testimony with me that that brother Nate had he started a Bible study in uh in his prison and it started when I think it was just three or four people is that right brother is that what you said is yeah it was just a very small group and then it started growing and it started growing and brother Nate told me that they get now 40 or 50 people in this Bible study but it's not just growing in the inmates it's growing brother Nate was telling me that the um the prison guards have heard about it and they're interested in starting to come and he was uh brother uh Ed was telling me that the chaplains everything things the the ministry was just kind of dead in the prison that they were at in the chaplains they weren't doing anything and and brother Nate got this it started to grow and it it started to spread and the chaplains took notice now there are different denominations and they took notice of how this Bible studying is just studying the Bible is not bringing in anything any outside doctrines or dogmas just concentrating on this holy book and they uh the chaplain said hey we want to get in on this too so they made the commitment now there's a Catholic and there was another one I forgot it was a Baptist or something but it's different denominations and they said we want to get in on this we see what you're doing we want to start just teaching this Bible too so they're starting now can you imagine a minister saying we just want to teach the Bible what were you teaching before there's nothing else to teach but this I I was uh I was blessed blessed to hear hear that testimony yesterday that's how revivals start is it just maybe it's a Bible study and it starts spreading it can start in a prison it can start in Kentucky it can start in Jeffersonville it can start in Tucson anywhere you can start anywhere wherever the Lord's Sovereign he can start it wherever he wants to with whoever he wants to he started a Revival with 12 of the most unqualified people that had probably ever preached the gospel two thousand years ago and we are still we are still reaping the benefits of that Revival here two thousand years later I was thinking on my heart and I was I was thinking about some of these testimonies over the past few days and I was thinking about two men Disciples of Jesus famous men we all know who they were both of them failed miserably in their lives failed had many many failures these two men are Peter and Judas is caring and I look at these two men these two Disciples of Jesus and as I was studying on their lives and on their Ministries I was wondering what separated what was the difference between these two men this man Peter who we Revere as high as anyone in the Bible aside from our Lord and then this man Judas who we do not see a lower form of life in the Bible than him yet both of them disciples both of them were in the boat when the when Jesus was sleeping under the hall and and those storms started raging and the boat started going back and forth and they went and they said Jesus we're gonna die Jesus gets up and stands on the bow of the boat and says peace be still and the winds and the wave caused both of these two men were there and they witnessed that and then when they get to the shore they they come they come to a man that that maybe what we would consider a homeless man today running around is naked yeah no clothes on completely out of his mind running through the tombs and and sleeping in the graveyards and we we would look at them today as somebody that we see it walking around up and down this Stone Avenue and Jesus comes and casts out demons from this man when asked his name he said We Are Legion for we are many maybe schizophrenic terrible terrible person Jesus is there and Jesus casts out these demons from this man so much such a strange thing that happened that the demons cried out to Jesus they said don't send us to the depths don't send us to hell these are demons afraid of going there how much more should we be of that place yet Jesus casts out these demons they come back and there there is this Legion in his right mind talking with the Lord saying Lord I want to follow you Jesus says no you stay here he had a work to do then Legion goes and he witnesses to all the people around in his town introducing them to the Lord and Judas and Peter were there so then they get back and they get word that there's a a a priest's daughter that was dying Lord would you come would you come pray for my daughter Jesus gets up and and the disciples go and all the people are going around and they're walking down and a little lady with the blood issue that was bleeding for many many years she touches the very Hem of His Garment she's made whole and Judas was there Peter was there and then they go and they receive word that this man Jairus that his daughter had died said don't come she's dead already Jesus I'm gonna go anyways so Jesus goes in him he goes in there Judas wasn't in the room but Jesus and Peter was there and John was there and James was there and they prayed for this dead girl and she rose from the dead and Peter was there and Judas also witnessed it he he wasn't in the room but he knew about these things how could we have two people that were so different come from the same place you know I look at I look at Divine Healing and I think about how important this Divine Healing is but they had the understanding that these Miracles that were happening Legion and and the storm and and jairus's daughter and these ones there the people are going to get sick again they're going to die again but they had the Revelation if we can just get people to Christ that their bodies May wither and die eventually but their souls will live forever in eternity they had this revelation of who this man was two men walking side by side and you go all the way back to Genesis we go back to the serpent and now in Genesis 3 it says I will put enmity between these speaking to The Serpent and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel speaking of Jesus and Satan all through these ages and then Jesus comes and then these two men get to be in his ministry Jesus goes to the woman at the well sends the disciples off to give food and he's talking to this this lady who maybe he shouldn't have been talking to as a minister of the Gospel yet they're around this well and he's talking to her and and back and forth he tells her that she's a sinner he tells her what she's done wrong and he says he says I will she says the well is deep she says you don't have anything to draw with it to draw the water and he's Jesus says the water that I give him shall be in him a well of of Living Water springing up to everlasting life and she looks at him and she says forgive me this water that I thirst not that's what this ministry was about it wasn't about just being healed so that we can get sick again we thank God for that and thank God that we are healed but but this Divine Healing and these Miracles they point us to Christ they showed us that Jesus that God is alive that he dwelt on Earth that yes he heals our sin our sicknesses he's saying he he saves those laws he brings them in to the church and we receive everlasting life through him that we will never get sick again I see these two men this Peter and and Judas and as I was studying I was reading the Bible there's so much more negative written about Peter then there is Judas mistake after mistake that Peter made Judas we only see one mistake that he made both of them repented what was the difference between these two there was a very obvious difference between them let's turn to John chapter 12. Peter and Judas coming into this last supper that Jesus was going to have on the Passover they come in but something had happened just before this Passover and this man Jesus now there's two schools of thought on this it's written two different places in the Bible and I'm going to read both of them and it's written slightly different in either one there's there's some schools of thought that say it's the same woman that this happened to and there's other schools of thought that say that it was two different women and then there's other schools of thought that say oh well here's a mistake in the Bible because it's not consistent so I want to read both my thoughts are these are two two different occurrences that happened really close in time to each other John chapter 12 verse 1. then six days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was then Jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which he had been dead which had been dead whom he raised from the dead there they made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment then said one of his disciples judas's carrot Simon's son which should betray him why was not dis ointment sold for 300 Pence and given to the poor this he said now the author of this is John John knew Judas traveled with him slept probably slept in the same tent as he did was around him a lot this said this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put therein another translation says this he said this not because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and having charge of the money bag he used to help himself to what was put in it and John seems to know this Judas very well and uh you can see Judas he didn't like it what are you doing going and buying this you're a sinner woman anyways why are you even here with us going and buying this expensive ointment and taking it and wasting it on Jesus he could wash his feet and and doing what you're doing and wasting all that money it didn't make sense to Judas he didn't like it and something started to happen as far as I can read the scriptures it looks like right there something started to happen in Judas and he started to justify in his mind Maybe I can get what I want and I can do it at his expense next verse then said Jesus led her alone I love the way Jesus stuck up for this young sister he's he I don't care what she's done leave her alone she's one of mine and she has a revelation that you don't have Judas let her alone against the day of my burying has she kept this Jesus was prophesying of his death that would happen in just a couple days for the poor always you have with you but me you have not always now let's read that very similar story that takes place in Matthew chapter 26. well we can start with verse 1 again and it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples you know that after two days is the Feast of the Passover and the son of man is betrayed to be is betrayed to be crucified then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and the elders and the people under the Palace of the high priest who was called caiaphasis and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety and kill him but they said not on the feast day unless there being uproar among the people we're going to wait a day now when Jesus was in Bethany same place as he was just at when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box a very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat the previous account was washing his feet but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste because of the testimony of John I I really don't see how this could have been anyone else but Judas saying that and he may have been an influence started to influence the others for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor when Jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me for ye have the poor always with you but me you have not always for in that she hath poured this ornament on my body she did it for my burial again prophesy of what was about to happen verily I say unto you where wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in all the world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial to her this day this prophecy is fulfilled then one of the twelve called Jesus carrot went unto the chief priests and said unto them what will you give me and I what will you give me and I will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for 30 pieces of silver and from that time he sought the opportunity to betray him while Judas saw he could get a benefit from this he was thinking of himself first and how many times do we see people joining a church or or going or switching from this church to that church or going into the ministry or whatever it might be so that they can get a benefit from it might be about money it might be about popularity whatever it might be but how often do we see people going for a purpose to serve themselves rather than to serve others and that's what judas's Focus was Judas was was premeditated in what he did he had fought all of this out time had passed by and he was working towards he wanted this money and he was going to do anything to get it there was a a friend of mine lives in the Bahamas brother Jordan knows him he calls people on the phone a lot and preaches to them whoever number he can get um aggravated me a few times but he's uh he's been successful in what he's done well he got the phone number of this famous evangelist I won't name the evangelist's name but this is a I don't know eight to ten years ago he got the name of this famous evangelist and he and the phone number and he calls him up and this man says says yeah you know this is so and so and he says listen he says you're going You're not preaching the gospel he says you're preaching for money he said the only thing you're doing is you're pulling on the people you want to pad your pocketbooks and you're preaching down a watered-down gospel and not correcting the people in their sins just because you're a good singer you're a good preacher and you can get a following but you're not providing correction to the people you know what he told them he says if I preach what you're saying he said I'd lose my Ministry that man got on an airplane and it crashed and he died that same day voila what a thing famous man he was given the opportunity I'm not calling this man as I said I don't know I don't know this man I'm not judging him I'm just going by what the story that this brother told me no matter how many people are in this church no matter how many people that we're preaching to no matter how many people you are ministering to or whatever never we could never compromise we can never compromise in the world for the world and just water it down because we're afraid people won't be here we can't it won't be successful hey uh I'm gonna skip down here let's uh let's go to verse 17. before we get there Paul said the Apostle Paul said he says I know how to be poor I know how to be rich he says he says I I know how it is he says I know how to is to be a beast I know how it is to abound he says every word in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need it doesn't matter where we are as long as we're in Christ and then he says I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me let's skip to verse 20. now when the evening was come he sat down with the twelve and they did eat he said verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me and they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say to him Lord is it I look at a Christian they're not pointing the fingers at each other they're afraid Lord is this me am I the one that is sinning am I the hindrance and he answered and said he that deepeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed these things are going to happen these things are prophecy he was going to go to the Cross but woe unto that man by whom he went to the cross then Judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it I want a foolish question I don't know why I asked that he said unto him thou has said right there right there Judas should have repented he had an opportunity Lord I'm sorry I did this I went to these priests we said this I'm sorry forgive me and he would probably be in glory today but he was born for this and he's he went on with his premeditated plan let's go to John chapter 13. now we're getting to the last supper here and this is this is John's take on this and they're going into feet washing Let's uh let's skip down brother to verse 18. okay we'll start at 16. that's good um barely I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither that is sent greater than he that sent him for ye know these things for if you know these things happy are you if you do them I speak not of you all I know know whom I have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me now I tell you before it come that when it has come to pass you may believe that I am he verily verily I say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever I sendeth receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me now right here we should be so careful be so careful in saying something against one another Judas he was aggressive he was attacking he was the one that was condemning he was the one that sought to betray Jesus he sought to do it when Jesus had thus said he was troubled in the spirit and testified and said verily verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake now there was leaning on Jesus's bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake Peter and John they're friends John obviously had a special relationship with Jesus they were close and he said ask him then lying on Jesus then he he that he then lying on Jesus's breast said unto him Lord who is it Jesus answered he it is to whom I shall give sop a sop when I have dipped it and when he had dipped the SOP he gave it to Judas Iscariot the son of Simon and after the sub Satan entered into him then said Jesus unto him thou doest do quickly right here again Judas has the opportunity to repent he has the opportunity to stop to not go through with this he had to know he was doing wrong but Satan had a willing vessel to enter into and that's this Judas Judas sought the money Satan had a willing vessel to come into and he comes in as I said he was born for that purpose he was born the Son of Perdition the son of Destruction to me this is the saddest story in the whole book is this story of Judas no now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him they didn't we would think that we would pick if we were one of the 12 we'd oh it's Judas they had no idea they're all wondering if it was me Lord am I the one that's going to do this for some of them thought because Judas had the bag that Jesus had said unto him by those things which we have need against the feast or that he should give something to the poor he then having received the SOP went immediately out and it was night his decision was made right to the priests he went therefore when he was gone out Jesus said now is the son of man glorified in him and God glorified in him so Judas leaves Jesus gets down and and he's he's washing the feet of the disciples and he's he's talking to them and and they're fellowshipping around the table and um let's go to verse 32. I'm sorry let's go to Matthew let's go to Matthew 26 32 I'm sorry brother there we go but after I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee Peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet I will never be offended the modern translation says though all men shall fall away because of you I will never fall away look at Peter's heart Lord I want to serve you I want to do right I'll never betray you I'll never make a mistake I'll never do something wrong Jesus said in him verily I say unto you that this night before the Crow Thou shalt deny me three times Peter said unto him though I should die with ye yet will I not deny thee likewise said all of the disciples how could I fall into sin how could how could I Lord how could I deny you there is no way so then as time goes on they go down to the Garden of the Gethsemane Jesus said will you stay here I need to go pray these are hard times Peter says yeah the same one I'll never deny you can you stay up can you watch Peter says sure he's sitting there and and Jesus is over praying and Peter he falls asleep again he betrays Jesus Jesus said don't fall asleep he comes he says Peter oh sorry I fell asleep Jesus goes back to pray again he does it again falls asleep Jesus comes back he goes back finally comes he says it's time it's over so here it comes the Judas and his crew they come in with with pit with with the Torches and that and Judas walks up to the Lord Jesus remember this is the one that was in the boat with him when he casted away the storm and he kisses him on the cheek and they knew from that kiss that this was Jesus he says you betrayed me with a kiss my friend Jesus called him his friend and there's Peter Peter pulls out a sword takes a hack at the guy's head fortunately he ducked I guess and and slices the ear off Jesus said Peter what are you doing did you not listen to anything that I said I did I not tell you if somebody Smite you on this cheek turn let them hit you on the other one and you're doing this come on Peter then all the disciples Peter included they get scared they run away and he says he tells Peter he says don't you know Peter I could ask the father he could send 12 Legions of angels you think I'm that weak Peter come on Peter gets afraid and all the other ones and they they leave Jesus let's skip to verse 69. so Peter he's following Jesus they they take him and he's scared and he's following Jesus far off and he's watching where he's going and he's watching all of this that's happening with Peter and then with Jesus and then he finds himself outside the palace and a damself comes to him saying you're with Jesus in Galilee and he denied them said no I wasn't verse 20 verse 71 it says and when he was gone out in the porch another made Psalm and said unto unto him unto them that were there this fellow also with was Jesus of Nazareth and again he denied with an oath I don't know the man I don't know that guy this is the one that healed his mother-in-law that he saw it this is the one he was there when Jairus daughter was raised up from the dead Peter was there when Legion when the demons were cast out of Legion this is the one that said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God I don't even know him wow look at the failure from Peter verse 73 and after a while came they unto him that stood by and said to Peter surely Thou Art also one of them Thou Art Thou also are one of them for thy speech be right thee then began he to curse and to swear saying I know not the man and immediately the crew just exactly what Jesus said that you're going to deny me three times before this rooster crows and I look at Peter and how he felt there and how a true Christian feels Peter was a true Christian and how that that it's it's like oh no I did it I did it again and how many of us how many of us lose our temper say something we shouldn't to our children to our parents to our husbands or our wives how many of us make mistakes and do things wrong just like Peter did we're guilty I was just just Friday it's with my wife she's thinking Dan don't do it don't tell them I think I I maybe my role is to make all the mistakes so then you can say I don't want to be like that guy up in the pulpit I'm gonna get fired we're Steph and I were driving and we pulled in to this parking lot and this homeless guy on a bike was right in front of me and I'm going to go around him and then he takes the left right in front of me and I hit the brakes and what did I do Peter I honked the horn and that guy he turned around he had a pile of Coke in his hand and he chucked it at the car I hit the brakes and I jumped out and he wisely took off as fast as he could on his bike away I got back in the car Lord I just caused that man to sin I did I didn't have to blow the horn but I caused him to sit I'm the one that did it and Stephanie kind of piled it on me she said yeah he probably needed those calories in that coke oh honey I felt so bad I did it I messed up I failed I sinned and I caused that poor man to sin I was I was upset and we went in the store and I was like I just can't handle it I was I I was feeling bad about myself and I was looking for the guy to try to find him you know Stephanie's with me I couldn't go into the homeless people and and ask but I wanted to get to him I want to say I'm sorry man forgive me I shouldn't have done that so I know how Peter felt we get we walk up to the car we were in the store we walk up the car and the tire's flat I was like Lord I'm sorry I hope that that's my punishment because I repent so we're able to limp to the to the gas station and and and and air up the tire and I said honey let's just pray Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry for making that man sin I'm sorry for for doing what I what I did Lord would you have mercy on him would you would you give this man eternal life that mean guy that honked at him I I just it just broke my heart but I can relate to Peter I did wrong and I repented and I I look at Judas Judas made that decision consciously premeditated for his own gain Peter when he denied the Lord he was afraid he messed up and he repented the very next verse I think it is um what's the next verse my brother I think it's is 75 yeah right there and Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he said unto him before the Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and he went out and wept bitterly there's a son of God there is that Seed of Abraham there is that man I'm sorry Lord I messed up and then Judas goes and let's read it I think I think it's just I think it's just good to read Matthew 27 we'll start with verse 3. and Judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned speaking of Jesus he repented and brought again the 30 pieces of silver to the pre to the chief priests and Elders Judas now he is repenting he said I have done this wrong and you we look at that Spirit Satan had entered Judas it was already done Jesus was already condemned he already did his job he takes the bottle the bag of money and he throws it down and he he goes out to the field sets up a noose and hangs himself I was I was reading that last night I was thinking Lord he repented but I thought I wonder if if he would have said Lord I was wrong I'm going to serve that man until the day I die but no he took the easy way out he goes out and he hangs himself you know what Satan had entered him Satan was like yeah I'm finished with you now I'm done with you and even Satan forsook him and said I'm finished hang yourself remember that's Satan's ultimate goal is to take our lives and he was so upset so sad and here he goes betrayed the Lord and goes and takes the easy way out and hangs himself I think brother Branham said one time that's the one thing I respect him for but I I think about that man I think about what if what if he would have followed through with his repentance and given his life to the Lord as Paul did Paul said I was wrong he said Lord who are you he said I'm Jesus whom you persecute Paul repented Paul gave his heart to the Lord Jesus and look what he did Paul was guilty of murdering Christians but there's this premeditated Judas and he's he's out there and he is looking for something to criticize that's the spirit of Jesus Peter just made a mistake but Judas he wanted something and now and we see all of the criticism of not only brother Branham we see criticism of ourselves we see criticism of this Bible and they're going and they're they're going and they're finding things like the story of Mary and the the two women that anointed Jesus look how different they are it must be false but look at their motives they're looking at it to find faults they want it and they same thing they go into the message that we believe and they're looking to try to find fault that is the spirit of Judas when you go into a church or you go in to wherever you go and you're looking for fault what spirit is that do you think that's the spirit of Christ that is not the spirit of Christ that's the spirit of this one here that hung himself the spirit of Peter was a Christian the spirit of Peter was Lord I'm sorry I keep messing up I keep doing the same thing wrong I'm going to get better I'm going to get better and then we look even later after Peter had received the Holy Spirit we see Peter and Paul come together I believe is it Antioch Peter's there and he's sitting with Paul and he's and they're all these Gentiles and they're eating and they all receive the Lord Jesus and they're so happy then two men came from Jerusalem down to this Antioch the the Jews they come down there first day then the next day Peter's like I'm not going to eat with gentiles I'm not going to do that because the Bible said he was afraid it was a weakness in Peter and so often we keep making mistakes over and over and over Lord why do I do it why do I do it because it's a weakness he forgives us for that but when there is a premeditated effort to take someone down when you go to church or when you are looking at people and you are looking for things to criticize in their lives that's not Peter making mistakes that's the spirit of Judas over here that is what will get us in trouble and it got Judas in trouble until he killed himself and then Peter I got to read this this other one I'll be fast Matthew chapter 16 verse 21. look at this rebuke from the Lord Jesus upon Peter Matthew 16 21 from that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and the chief chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again on the third day then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee Lord this shall not be done unto thee but he turned and he said unto the unto Peter get thee behind me Satan he said it to Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art an offense unto me wow how did how did Peter feel for thou savior is not the things of God but the things that be of men look at the rebuke there I could find two places brother Jonathan that the Lord said get thee behind me Satan one time was when he was tempted in the wilderness and it was to Satan and the other time was to his Guy Peter wow can you imagine how bad Peter felt and how bad that we feel look at me that poor guy on the bicycle boy I Repent about that I feel so bad and I go before the Lord Lord I'm sorry I did it again and Peter I can see him saying Lord I did it again I keep doing it over and over again but then later on they had gone through the last supper and the musicians can come I'm closing they they went to the Last Supper Jesus serve the communion wash the feet they went down Peter Garden of Gethsemane Peter messed up fell asleep ran away forsook him three times and all that Peter did Jesus dies and he's Resurrected and Jesus comes back to the disciples and he's he's talking to them and imagine how they felt imagine how they felt on that Easter morning when it's they were so afraid and they were so condemned and all that they had done bad and here he is here I am and oh God oh thank you and Jesus pulls Peter off to the side oh I love this I love this so much Jesus pulls him off to to the side and he says he says Peter he says do you love me Peter from Obama's art said bless the Lord I love you and he said feed my sheep how wonderful Lord Peter with all of your faults and though you kept forsaking me you kept making mistakes you kept doing things wrong Peter feed my Lambs do you love me yes Lord three times do you love me Peter yes feed my sheep and there we see the difference between the son of Destruction and Judas and a son of God in Peter there was Godly repentance in Peter Peter's mistakes were not to serve himself Peter was not going to go after someone and tear them down so that he could be exalted so that he could have more money that was not Peter that's not us I pray it's not us [Music] there are judas's everywhere that same Spirit but then there's the same spirit that was in Peter also both of them made horrible mistakes over and over mistakes Peter made but yet at the end the Lord yeah do you love me we have it I was standing there and I saw this big tractor trailer come in and take out this tree and I watched and I laughed Lord I messed up right there says I know he said feed my sheep the Lord I was driving and I honked at this poor guy and I caused him to say he threw his Coke at me and I got mad I know feed my Lambs but Lord I got mad at my my husband or my my wife and and we were fighting and and I didn't and I just I did so wrong I know feed my sheep serve me serve each other [Music] love the Lord don't be a Judas that we come and we're looking for something and we want to talk about them we want to tear that person down because somehow it makes myself feel better that's Judas that's the serpent all the way to Cain look at all the way back Cain saw Abel and how God accepted that sacrifice and he was jealous The Same Spirit that Judas had on him he was jealous and he destroyed his brother [Music] that's the spirit of Judas but the spirit of God Jesus for so Peter forsook Jesus I understand but he repented and he he said Lord I was wrong and that's the same as we that was the son of God but we can never forsake never hurt a Son of God or a daughter of God Jesus Christ tore himself into pieces and placed those pieces called the Holy Spirit into his people and then those people represent Christ in this day and that is who we're dealing with that's the difference between Peter and between Judas let's stand [Music] friends we fail so much [Music] and how many things have we all done wrong but is there repentance in our heart when we fail is it is it to promote ourselves is it to benefit ourselves or is it just because we messed up we have a choice are we going to be a Judas are we going to be a Peter we're going to be all the other disciples and we're going to be a son of God let's think about it today as we prepare for tonight's communion it'll be at the normal time let's bow our heads [Music] think about how good he is Lord I will never forsake you I will never forsake you I'll never deny you it says son daughter feed my sheep work for me [Music] time is growing growing short
