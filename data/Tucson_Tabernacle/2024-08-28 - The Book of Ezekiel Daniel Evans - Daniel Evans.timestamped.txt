[34:52] scripture out of the Book of Ezekiel I
[34:56] want to read it out of the book of
[34:57] Psalms so let's talk let's turn in our
[35:00] Bibles it just sounds better when he
[35:02] says
[35:05] that the original is always the
[35:08] best Psalm
[35:11] 137 I want you to listen to this Psalm
[35:13] close this Psalm is
[35:17] written
[35:19] about the beginning at least of the Book
[35:22] of
[35:23] Ezekiel and um it describes it perfectly
[35:27] psalm 37 says
[35:29] this by the Rivers of
[35:33] Babylon there we sat down yay we wept
[35:37] when we remembered Zion we hanged our
[35:40] Harps upon the Willows in the midst
[35:42] thereof for they for there they that
[35:44] carried us away captive required of us a
[35:47] song and they that wasted us required of
[35:51] us mirth saying sing us one of the songs
[35:54] of
[35:55] Zion how shall we sing the Lord's song
[35:58] In a Strange Land If I forget thee Oh
[36:01] Jerusalem let my right hand forget her
[36:05] cunning if I do not remember thee let my
[36:07] tongue cleave to the roof of roof of my
[36:09] mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above my
[36:13] chief Joy remember oh Lord the children
[36:16] of Edom in the day of Jerusalem who said
[36:20] raise it raise it even to the foundation
[36:25] thereof oh daughter of Babylon who art
[36:28] thou to be
[36:30] destroyed happy shall he be that

[38:38] else is just Home
[38:40] Folks
[38:41] um this um This Book of Ezekiel so
[38:45] brother Gideon what we do is on
[38:46] Wednesday night we have a Bible study
[38:49] and we're going through the Bible we're
[38:52] going from Genesis to Revelation we're
[38:53] taking one evening a week and we're
[38:58] dedicating that to one Bible book so we
[39:01] have come to the Book of Ezekiel um to
[39:05] to give a background to the Book of
[39:07] Ezekiel we had Jeremiah last week
[39:10] Jeremiah prophesied of the coming
[39:13] Invasion from the King of the North do
[39:16] you remember who the king of the north
[39:17] is Nebuchadnezzar this man very cruel um
[39:22] very powerful King Jeremiah U much of
[39:26] his ministry was prophesying that this
[39:28] man is coming and then towards the end
[39:30] of Jeremiah's um to his book then we see
[39:34] that Nebuchadnezzar invades
[39:37] Nebuchadnezzar invades actually invades
[39:40] Israel Jerusalem three times and I'm uh
[39:43] going down here I want to make sure I
[39:45] get my dates right the first time he
[39:48] invades is around
[39:50] 597
[39:52] BC he comes
[39:54] in and uh he
[39:58] takes a number of uh people captive when
[40:01] he gets to Jerusalem do you know who one
[40:04] of the ones that he took captive
[40:07] was Daniel right Daniel he takes this
[40:10] young man Daniel captive brings him out
[40:14] then about eight years pass and he
[40:17] invades
[40:18] again and uh he takes this young this
[40:22] man young man Ezekiel captive takes them
[40:25] out and then the Third time he invades
[40:29] he completely destroys Jerusalem
[40:32] destroys the temple um lays Siege to it
[40:35] for two years they were starving to
[40:38] death they um it was just a very as
[40:41] brother Lyall prayed it was it was one
[40:44] of the hardest times that have ever been
[40:47] for God's people very difficult very um
[40:50] very tough tough
[40:52] time so in the Book of Ezekiel we'll
[40:56] read many many times in fact he says 60
[40:59] times he Jeremiah will prophesy God will
[41:03] tell Jeremiah what to say and he'll say
[41:05] this that so that you'll know that I am
[41:07] the Lord and He prophesies these
[41:10] hardships to come and and that is the
[41:14] theme really of This Book of Ezekiel
[41:19] that he is he is prophesying he's called
[41:23] to be a prophet and God keeps let laying
[41:27] the hammer down on this um on Israel
[41:33] really so it um it
[41:37] starts with um it's it's obviously
[41:39] written probably by this this man
[41:42] Ezekiel Ezekiel is taken captive when
[41:46] he's fairly young and now he is in
[41:49] Jerusalem and he receives his commission
[41:53] as a prophet as as we're going to read
[41:55] in really in the first chapter it's the
[41:57] first that we know that God gave Ezekiel
[42:00] a
[42:01] um a prophecy to give and um it's just a
[42:07] it's really a very sad book Jeremiah was
[42:11] sad ezekiel's sad Ezekiel and Jeremiah
[42:16] both Servants of the Lord and and
[42:18] Prophets of the lord they're considered
[42:20] among the Major Prophets really the
[42:23] difference between a major prophet and a
[42:24] minor Prophet is just how much is
[42:27] written in the Bible the Minor Prophets
[42:29] have less written the Major Prophets
[42:32] have more written it's that simple
[42:34] doesn't mean one's greater than any
[42:35] other one they both spoke on behalf of
[42:37] the Lord Jeremiah and Ezekiel they had
[42:41] it they had it really rough and you look
[42:44] at really these Servants of the
[42:47] Lord and your heart just bleeds for them
[42:51] they're not prosperous men at all most
[42:54] of them aren't they they come and and
[42:57] they they give their lives to the Lord
[43:00] and then the Lord uses them and many
[43:02] times it's such a hard life we saw that
[43:04] Jeremiah how difficult his life was a
[43:06] couple weeks ago and now Ezekiel you're
[43:09] going to see a man that was equally
[43:13] suffered equally as much as Jeremiah and
[43:15] I look at this man Ezekiel and I think
[43:17] how could anyone be so dedicated to God
[43:22] as this man that's that's something that
[43:24] you may sound strange but when you hear
[43:27] what this man had to
[43:30] do it it's
[43:33] sad and he wasn't respected God even
[43:37] told him he said you're going to be a
[43:39] prophet but they're not going to believe
[43:40] you believe you Ezekiel they're not
[43:43] going to listen to
[43:44] you and he uh he still did what he was
[43:49] told he still prophesied and he
[43:52] dedicated just the dedication that these
[43:55] prophets have to God they truly don't
[43:59] care really don't seem to care about
[44:01] anything else they are so in tune with
[44:06] God and and willing to give everything
[44:08] and they are not treated well really the
[44:11] only thing that treats these prophets
[44:13] well is
[44:15] history many of them they're they're
[44:18] highly regarded in this
[44:20] book but during the time of their lives
[44:25] they've got it rough
[44:27] Jeremiah or
[44:29] Ezekiel he was he was told to lay on his
[44:33] side for a year eating just a little bit
[44:37] of food St basically starving to death
[44:40] cooking his food on
[44:43] dong and then laying on the other side
[44:47] for about another
[44:49] year and lay laying out there and then
[44:53] people walking by and surely making fun
[44:56] of him but just as a
[44:58] symbol about what God is going to do to
[45:02] this country of
[45:04] Israel very very as I said no one
[45:08] believed and there were Prophet other
[45:10] prophets prophesying at that time like
[45:11] with like with Jeremiah and they were
[45:14] prophesying good things and everybody
[45:16] wants a good prophecy it feels good and
[45:19] everybody listens to the good prophecies
[45:21] but it's these hard prophecies it's
[45:23] these Prophecies of coming judgment that
[45:26] were re at this
[45:28] time so it's just it's a very very
[45:32] difficult
[45:34] book very difficult story this man
[45:39] Ezekiel um so Ezekiel
[45:42] was as I said Daniel was taken captive
[45:46] which we if the Lord's willing we will
[45:48] get to next week this Ezekiel was taken
[45:51] captive in the second
[45:54] captivity and if you remember the PSAL
[45:57] he says
[46:00] this go back to Psalm
[46:05] 137 starts with this by the Rivers of
[46:09] Babylon there we sat down yay we wept
[46:14] when we remembered
[46:16] Zion so let's turn the Book of Ezekiel
[46:19] chapter
[46:20] 1 so
[46:23] ezekiel's young man is as you'll see
[46:27] see it was his
[46:30] birthday and he was turning 30 years
[46:34] old and he um he was there and he was
[46:38] just not feeling bad he had grown up his
[46:42] life to be a minister to be a preacher
[46:47] in God's Temple to be a priest that was
[46:49] the desire of his heart but then he was
[46:52] taken captive pulled out of his home and
[46:54] brought up north to this Heathen
[46:59] country and he didn't have a temple to
[47:01] preach in didn't have a church to preach
[47:03] in still called to be a minister and it
[47:07] was just was very
[47:10] discouraging this man so he
[47:14] comes as and as you read from the Psalms
[47:16] there's probably some other people with
[47:18] him and he comes down and he
[47:23] sits
[47:25] by this canal
[47:28] the place that they were at in Babylon
[47:31] the Tigers and the Euphrates River come
[47:33] through there and they would
[47:36] build canals from these two
[47:40] rivers and Ezekiel sits down by this
[47:45] canal and he's probably thinking
[47:49] wow 30 years old is when a priest is
[47:51] ordained and here I am 30 years
[47:55] old and in
[47:57] captivity no Temple to preach in my
[48:00] family or friends and all of that
[48:04] back in
[48:07] Jerusalem I don't know what to do so he
[48:09] sits
[48:10] down and here's what
[48:13] happens now it came to pass in the 30th
[48:17] year on the fourth month and in the
[48:19] fifth day of the month as I was among
[48:22] the captives by the river of by the
[48:24] river of kar most translations say by
[48:27] the canal
[48:29] kear that the heavens were opened and I
[48:31] saw the vision of God so it says here it
[48:34] came to pass in the 30th year it doesn't
[48:37] say the 30th year of Hezekiah it doesn't
[48:41] say the 30th year of Nebuchadnezzar it
[48:43] just says the 30th
[48:45] year
[48:47] which really could only be it was his
[48:49] 30th year that was his
[48:53] birthday and he says that the Heavens
[48:57] were
[48:57] opened and I saw visions of God in the
[49:01] fifth day of the month which was the
[49:03] fifth day which was the fifth year of
[49:06] King jehoich Chin's captivity the word
[49:09] of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel
[49:11] the priest the son of buzi in the land
[49:14] of the calans by the river Kar and the
[49:17] Hand of the Lord was there upon
[49:20] him and I looked and behold a whirlwind
[49:23] came out of the North and a great cloud
[49:26] and a fire infolding himself and the
[49:29] brightness was about it and out of the
[49:32] midst thereof as the color of amber out
[49:35] of the midst of the fire also out of the
[49:38] midst thereof came the likeness of four
[49:40] living creatures and this was their
[49:43] appearance they had the likeness of a
[49:46] man and everyone had four faces and
[49:49] everyone had four wings and their feet
[49:52] were
[49:53] straight feet and their soul of their
[49:56] feet was was like the sole of a Cal's
[49:57] foot and they sparkled like the color of
[50:00] of burn of burnished brass and they had
[50:03] the hands of a man under their wings on
[50:05] their for on the on their four sides and
[50:08] they four had their faces and their and
[50:10] their wings their wings were joined one
[50:13] to another and they turned not when they
[50:17] went and they went everyone straight
[50:20] forward so
[50:22] these
[50:23] powerful angels were flying in formation
[50:28] flying
[50:30] straight and as for the likeness of
[50:33] their faces they four had the
[50:36] face they four had the face of a man and
[50:40] the face of a
[50:42] lion on the right side and they four had
[50:45] the face of an ox on the left side and
[50:47] they four also had the face of an eagle
[50:50] brother Jeremy has been telling me he's
[50:53] been going through the the church ages
[50:56] and um
[50:57] the seals well he said the church ages
[51:00] and the seals and the ages are there we
[51:02] know that from a study of the seals that
[51:07] during the Gentile
[51:09] dispensation after the the um the Jewish
[51:14] people they rejected the Lord God turned
[51:17] his face to the Gentiles and we know
[51:20] that Paul the Apostle Paul broke the ice
[51:22] there and he went out and brought this
[51:25] and and in the those 2,000 years of that
[51:28] Gentile dispensation remember it starts
[51:30] with Ephesus and it ends with leoa in
[51:33] those 2,000 years there are different
[51:35] ages inside of that time and those ages
[51:39] if you go to the Book of Revelation I
[51:41] believe it's in chapter 4 you see this
[51:44] scripture here repeated you'll see it
[51:46] repeated again in Ezekiel this scripture
[51:49] is
[51:50] repeated and it says that this this
[51:57] lion
[51:59] first is one of the
[52:02] insignias from the the tribe of Judah so
[52:05] it shows here that says that there's
[52:07] four faces here there's four things here
[52:10] and Judah would encamp and there would
[52:12] be four insignias one of those insignias
[52:14] the first one was the lion of the tribe
[52:17] of
[52:18] Judah and then the second one and that
[52:20] was that was the beginning of the ages
[52:23] there that was that was this boldness of
[52:25] the Lion and it went out and it was
[52:27] preaching the gospel and then time went
[52:30] on and then it went into this Ox
[52:34] age this
[52:35] lion was represented by Judah and then
[52:39] the ox age was represented by Ephraim
[52:42] and that was the laboring that they
[52:44] labored during those dark ages and then
[52:49] after that those ages came then the
[52:52] spirit of the man came and that Spirit
[52:55] of the man was the intelligence and and
[52:58] the being able to translate the
[53:00] scriptures and we see that in Luther and
[53:03] Wesley and then and that was Reuben and
[53:07] then in the last age it was the eagle
[53:10] age and the in Insignia of that of the
[53:12] four was Dan and that was the prophetic
[53:17] age the the the ending time age there
[53:21] and the closing of the Gentile
[53:23] dispensation we know that from a study
[53:26] on the church ages and the
[53:29] seals thus were their faces and their
[53:32] wings were stretched upward two Wings on
[53:35] every of every one were joined together
[53:37] and two covered their bodies I'm I'm
[53:39] sitting here because Ezekiel was sitting
[53:42] there when all of this
[53:47] happened and they went everyone straight
[53:49] forward whether the spirit was to go and
[53:51] they went and they turned not when they
[53:53] went as for the likeness of the living
[53:56] creatures their appearance was like
[53:57] burning coals of fire and like the
[53:59] appearance of lamps it went up and down
[54:02] and among the living creatures and the
[54:05] fire was was bright and all and out of
[54:07] the fire went forth lightning and the
[54:10] living creatures ran and returned and as
[54:13] the appearance of the flash of lightning
[54:16] now as I beheld the living creatures
[54:18] behold one wheel upon the Earth by the
[54:21] living creatures with his four faces
[54:27] the appearance of the wheels and their
[54:30] work was like unto the color of barrel
[54:32] and they four had one likeness and their
[54:35] appearance and their work was as it were
[54:38] of a wheel in the middle of a
[54:41] wheel this is going to show up later on
[54:43] in
[54:44] Ezekiel when they went they went upon
[54:46] their four sides and they turned not
[54:49] when they went and as for their four
[54:51] wings they were so high that they were
[54:54] Dreadful and their their Rings were full
[54:57] of eyes round about them their their
[55:00] Rings which is their rims were full of
[55:02] eyes round about them and when the
[55:05] living creatures went the wheels went by
[55:07] them and when the living creatures were
[55:10] lifted up from the earth the wheels were
[55:12] lifted up with so withersoever the
[55:15] spirit was to go they went tither was
[55:18] their Spirit to go and the wheels were
[55:20] lifted up over against them for the
[55:23] spirit of the living creatures was in
[55:25] the wheels when those went these went
[55:29] and when those stood these stood and
[55:31] when those were lifted up from the earth
[55:33] these the wheels were lifted up over
[55:35] against them and the spirit of the
[55:36] living creature was in the wheels and
[55:39] the likeness of the Firmin upon the
[55:41] heads of the living creature was as the
[55:43] color of of terrible Crystal that word
[55:46] terrible doesn't mean the same now as it
[55:49] did when the King James was translated
[55:51] it means like Great and
[55:53] Powerful terrible Crystal stretched
[55:55] forth over their heads above and under
[55:57] the firmament were their wings straight
[55:59] and one toward the other everyone had
[56:01] two which covered on this side and
[56:04] everyone had two which covered on that
[56:06] side their bodies and they and when they
[56:09] went I heard the noise of their wings
[56:11] like the noise of Great Waters as the
[56:14] voice of the almighty the voice of the
[56:16] voice of speech as the noise of a host
[56:19] when they stood they let down their
[56:22] wings and there was a voice from the
[56:24] firmament that was over there heads when
[56:27] they stood and had let down their wings
[56:30] and above the firmament that was over
[56:32] their heads was like the appearance of a
[56:35] throne and the appearance of a sapphire
[56:37] stone and upon the likeness of the
[56:39] throne was the likeness as the
[56:41] appearance of a man above it and I saw
[56:44] the color of amber as the appearance of
[56:48] fire round about within from the
[56:50] appearance of his loins even upward and
[56:52] from the appearance of his loins even
[56:54] downward and I saw as it were were the
[56:56] appearance of
[56:57] fire and it had the brightness round
[57:00] about and as the appearance of a bow
[57:03] that is in the cloud in the day of rain
[57:05] so was the appearance of the brightness
[57:07] roundabout this was the appearance of
[57:09] the likeness of the glory of the
[57:12] Lord and when I saw it I fell upon my
[57:15] face and I heard a voice of one that
[57:19] spake so here he is he's he's seeing all
[57:22] of this he's sitting by this this this
[57:25] canal and all of this happens this
[57:28] vision goes and and all of these these
[57:31] powerful noises and all this and then he
[57:35] hears a
[57:38] voice and he said unto me son of man
[57:42] stand upon thy feet and I will speak
[57:45] unto
[57:46] thee so we
[57:48] see here the Lord is addressing his
[57:52] prophet and he says he says son of man
[57:57] son of man is it's a
[58:00] term that is
[58:03] um it's often misconstrued son of man
[58:07] basically means what it says it means
[58:10] the son of a human being it means you're
[58:13] a human
[58:14] being so when he's addressing here he's
[58:17] saying that you thou son of man he says
[58:20] he says listen to me you human
[58:22] being and later on we'll see in
[58:27] Daniel
[58:29] that God that Daniel will prophesy that
[58:33] the son of man is coming and he will
[58:36] have great power and great Authority and
[58:39] and that this son of man which is going
[58:42] to be Christ is going to basically be
[58:45] God on Earth so when you see Jesus when
[58:49] Jesus calls himself son of man that's
[58:52] why they hated him they wanted to kill
[58:55] him they said it was blasphemy because
[58:58] they were they knew the Book of Daniel
[59:00] but here in the Book of Ezekiel and in
[59:03] Jeremiah he's basically saying thou son
[59:06] of man you human being listen to
[59:12] me and the spirit entered into me when
[59:15] he spake unto me and set me upon my feet
[59:20] that I heard him that spake unto me
[59:24] notice the spirit of the Lord it he
[59:26] enters into Ezekiel when the Lord speaks
[59:29] so when when he he he's he comes in and
[59:31] Ezekiel as I said is a major prophet in
[59:34] the Bible but even Ezekiel he has to
[59:37] have the spirit of the Lord enter into
[59:39] him before he can
[59:43] prophesy and he said unto me son of man
[59:46] I send thee to the children of Israel to
[59:48] a rebellious nation that hath rebelled
[59:50] against me they and their fathers have
[59:53] transgressed me against me even unto
[59:56] this very day this story happens over
[59:59] and over again in the Bible ever since
[1:00:01] we've been going through our Bible
[1:00:02] studies the same thing they transgress
[1:00:05] against me the people sin against me now
[1:00:10] I will send a prophet and he will
[1:00:12] prophesy saying get
[1:00:15] right or else judgment is coming and
[1:00:19] once again nothing new we have a prophet
[1:00:24] prophesying against the sins of the
[1:00:28] people the sins of the people got very
[1:00:30] very bad in this time of the Captivity
[1:00:33] just before the Captivity they
[1:00:36] were
[1:00:39] living against the Lord's commandments
[1:00:42] they they were they were sinning they
[1:00:44] were living immorally they were cheating
[1:00:46] on their wives they were there's
[1:00:48] prostitutes everywhere it was a really
[1:00:50] sinful time so here is the the prophet
[1:00:54] Ezekiel sent like Jeremiah was sent to
[1:00:57] try to set these things straight but
[1:01:00] nobody listens to
[1:01:05] him for they are impotent
[1:01:09] children and stiff hearted I do send
[1:01:12] thee unto them and thou shalt say unto
[1:01:15] them thus sayith the Lord God so basic
[1:01:18] they're they're obstinate they're
[1:01:19] stubborn so he's saying say unto them
[1:01:22] this is what the Sovereign God says and
[1:01:25] they whether they will hear or whether
[1:01:28] they will forbear for they are a
[1:01:30] rebellious house yet shall they know
[1:01:32] that there hath been a prophet among
[1:01:34] them and thou son of man be not afraid
[1:01:37] of them neither be afraid of their words
[1:01:39] though briers and Thorns be with thee
[1:01:41] and thou doest well among the Scorpions
[1:01:44] be not afraid of their words nor be
[1:01:46] dismayed at their looks though they be a
[1:01:49] rebellious house so he's saying L listen
[1:01:50] Ezekiel they're not going to listen to
[1:01:52] you it's going to be a hard time don't
[1:01:54] be afraid of them don't be afraid of
[1:01:56] what they're going to do because I'm
[1:01:58] going to be with you and here's
[1:02:01] Ezekiel no one listens to the man no one
[1:02:05] cares about him but what a man that he
[1:02:08] says Lord I'm going to do whatever you
[1:02:12] say he says I'm going to do what you
[1:02:15] command and thou shalt speak my words
[1:02:17] unto them whether they will hear or
[1:02:20] whether they will forbear for they are
[1:02:22] most rebellious but thou son of man hear
[1:02:27] what I say to thee be not rebellious
[1:02:30] like that rebellious house open thy
[1:02:32] mouth and eat that I give that I give
[1:02:37] thee so this is something that is going
[1:02:39] to happen again also in the Book of
[1:02:41] Revelation where the Prophet is told to
[1:02:44] eat the
[1:02:46] Scrolls and when I looked Behold a hand
[1:02:50] was sent unto me and lo a roll of book
[1:02:53] was therein so we have a scroll
[1:02:57] and he spread it before me and it was
[1:02:59] written within and without and there was
[1:03:01] written therein Lamentations and
[1:03:04] mourning and
[1:03:06] woe moreover he said unto me son of man
[1:03:11] eat thou eat that thou findest eat this
[1:03:14] rooll and go and speak unto the house of
[1:03:16] Israel so I opened my mouth and caused
[1:03:19] me to eat the
[1:03:21] roll and he said unto me son of man
[1:03:24] cause thy belly to eat and fill thy
[1:03:26] bowels with this roll that I give thee
[1:03:29] and then I did eat and it was in my
[1:03:32] mouth as honey for
[1:03:35] sweetness so he takes the word and he
[1:03:38] eats it and it's in his mouth and it
[1:03:40] tastes really
[1:03:42] good but then in the Book of
[1:03:45] Revelation it says that he eats it and
[1:03:48] it was good in his mouth but boy when it
[1:03:51] had time to sit it became bitter in his
[1:03:54] stomach it became hard it was good when
[1:03:56] you first get it when you first get the
[1:03:58] word but then there's something that
[1:04:01] comes along with getting it there's some
[1:04:04] suffering later
[1:04:07] on so then he goes back to the side so
[1:04:12] so he hears this voice again and and
[1:04:14] it's like an earthquake to him he hears
[1:04:16] the wheels turning again and the wings
[1:04:17] of the cheram as they touch one another
[1:04:20] and he says that he went in the
[1:04:21] bitterness and the Heat of the spirit
[1:04:23] and then he goes back to the side of
[1:04:25] this this canal and there he sits for 7
[1:04:28] days and he's just overwhelmed with what
[1:04:31] had happened verse number um verse
[1:04:34] number 16 and it came to pass at the end
[1:04:37] of the seven days that the word of the
[1:04:39] Lord came unto me saying son of man I
[1:04:42] have made thee a Watchman under the
[1:04:43] house of Israel therefore hear the word
[1:04:45] of my mouth and give them warning from
[1:04:47] me when I say unto the wicked Thou shalt
[1:04:50] surely die and thou givest him not
[1:04:52] warning nor speakest to warn the wicked
[1:04:55] from his Wicked way to save his life the
[1:04:58] same Wicked man shall die in his
[1:05:01] iniquity but his blood will I require at
[1:05:03] thine
[1:05:05] hand if thou if thou warn the wicked and
[1:05:08] he turn not from his wickedness nor from
[1:05:11] his Wicked way he shall die in his
[1:05:13] iniquity but thou Hast delivered thy
[1:05:16] Soul again when a righteous man doth
[1:05:19] turn from his right his righteousness
[1:05:21] and commit iniquity and I lay a
[1:05:23] stumbling block before him he shall die
[1:05:25] because thou Hast not given him warning
[1:05:28] he shall die in his sin and his
[1:05:30] righteousness which he hath done not
[1:05:33] which he ha he which he hath done shall
[1:05:36] not be remembered but his blood will I
[1:05:38] require at thine hand nevertheless if
[1:05:40] thou warn the righteous man that the
[1:05:43] righteous sin that the righteous sin not
[1:05:46] and he do not sin he shall surely live
[1:05:49] because he is warned also thou Hast
[1:05:51] delivered thy soul and the Hand of the
[1:05:53] Lord was there upon me and he said unto
[1:05:55] me arise and go forth to the plain and I
[1:05:58] will talk with
[1:06:00] thee he's saying that these Watchmen
[1:06:04] were up above and they're looking out
[1:06:06] and if they see an invading Army come
[1:06:09] they'll blow the
[1:06:10] trumpet and that's their job here it
[1:06:13] comes here comes the invading army or
[1:06:16] Here Comes sin or Here Comes adultery
[1:06:19] Here Comes whatever you blow the trumpet
[1:06:22] now Ezekiel you tell them that this is
[1:06:26] wrong now you have done your part if
[1:06:30] they go and do it and they sin they will
[1:06:32] die in their sins but it's not your
[1:06:34] fault but if you don't tell them if you
[1:06:37] don't have enough courage to cry out
[1:06:39] against
[1:06:40] sin then that man
[1:06:42] dies because he gets invaded he gets
[1:06:45] killed by this invading Army and you
[1:06:49] also will suffer you will I will require
[1:06:54] your blood also because of his
[1:06:58] sin so Jeremiah or Ezekiel is here and
[1:07:02] he's following the Lord's words doing
[1:07:06] everything that he can warn these people
[1:07:08] and and what's going on now is is he's
[1:07:11] here he's he's prophesying out that
[1:07:13] these these invading armies are going to
[1:07:15] come and it's going to be really really
[1:07:18] bad in Jerusalem because of all their
[1:07:21] sins remember there had been two
[1:07:24] invasions there's one left and this last
[1:07:27] one is really bad and most of this the
[1:07:30] first half of This Book of Ezekiel the
[1:07:31] first part of This Book of
[1:07:33] Ezekiel he is prophesying that this is
[1:07:38] coming let's go to chapter four then
[1:07:41] Ezekiel starts doing he starts doing
[1:07:43] some strange things and these things are
[1:07:46] symbolic things before the people so
[1:07:48] they're not listening to his words so
[1:07:51] now God tells him okay instead of doing
[1:07:54] instead of is telling them now act these
[1:07:58] things
[1:07:59] out like make a play or or give give
[1:08:03] some sort of symbol here and then God
[1:08:06] tells him what to
[1:08:08] do he's now
[1:08:11] relating what is going to happen to
[1:08:14] Jerusalem in this upcoming
[1:08:17] Siege chapter 4 verse1 and thou also son
[1:08:20] of man take the a tile a brick
[1:08:25] and lay it before thee and portray it
[1:08:28] upon the city even Jerusalem so what
[1:08:30] he's doing is he's getting some like you
[1:08:32] know the kids play with like Legos and
[1:08:35] stuff action figures so that's what
[1:08:38] that's what Ezekiel is doing here he's
[1:08:39] getting these things together and he's
[1:08:41] building these this little like
[1:08:44] model as a symbol
[1:08:48] against Jerusalem and against the
[1:08:52] sin he says and thou son of man take the
[1:08:55] a tile a brick and lay it before thee
[1:08:58] and portray it upon the city even
[1:09:00] Jerusalem and lay SE lay seeg against it
[1:09:04] and build a fort against it and cast a
[1:09:06] mount against it set the camp also
[1:09:09] against it and set a battering rams
[1:09:11] against it round about so he's he's
[1:09:13] making all this and this little model in
[1:09:15] front in front of
[1:09:17] him moreover take thou unto thee an iron
[1:09:20] pan and set it for a wall of iron
[1:09:23] between thee and the City and set thy
[1:09:26] face against it and it shall be besieged
[1:09:29] and thou shalt lay Siege against it this
[1:09:31] shall be assigned to the house of
[1:09:33] Israel so he builds this
[1:09:36] thing and it's a sign and then he goes
[1:09:40] on and does something else he says lie
[1:09:43] thou also upon thy left
[1:09:45] side you've heard that there was a
[1:09:48] prophet that laid on his side for many
[1:09:50] many days this is
[1:09:52] Ezekiel lie thou also upon thy left side
[1:09:55] and lay the iniquity of the House of
[1:09:57] Israel upon it according to the number
[1:09:59] of the days that thou shalt lay upon it
[1:10:02] Thou shalt bear their iniquity for I
[1:10:04] have laid upon thee the years of their
[1:10:07] iniquity according to the number of the
[1:10:09] days 300 and 90
[1:10:14] days so Thou shalt bear the iniquity of
[1:10:16] the House of Israel over a
[1:10:19] year and when thou Hast accomplished
[1:10:21] them lie again on thy right side and
[1:10:24] thou shalt bear the iniquity of the
[1:10:26] house of Judah remember Israel in the
[1:10:29] north Judah in the South remember we
[1:10:32] have two different countries Israel's
[1:10:33] already gone by now already dispersed
[1:10:36] and conquered and and taken captive now
[1:10:38] Judah is the only one left so now bear
[1:10:41] the iniquity of the house of Judah 40
[1:10:43] days I have appointed thee each day for
[1:10:45] a year therefore Thou shalt set thy
[1:10:49] face towards The Siege of Jerusalem and
[1:10:52] thine arm shall be uncovered so he pulls
[1:10:55] up a sleeve and thou shalt prophesy
[1:10:58] against
[1:10:59] it and behold I will lay bands upon thee
[1:11:02] and thou shalt not turn thee from one
[1:11:04] side to another till thou Hast endured
[1:11:07] the days of The
[1:11:09] Siege Thou shalt also take unto thee
[1:11:12] wheat and barley and beans and lentils
[1:11:14] and Millet and FES basically barley
[1:11:17] beans lentils and and wheat and put them
[1:11:20] in a vessel and make thee bread thereof
[1:11:23] according to the number of the days that
[1:11:25] Thou shalt lay upon thy side 390 days
[1:11:28] shal thou eat thereof and thy meat
[1:11:31] basically your food which you shall eat
[1:11:34] shall be by weight you ever have a you
[1:11:37] ever go on a diet where you weigh your
[1:11:39] food put it on a scale this is the
[1:11:42] extreme this is not much food at
[1:11:45] all and thy meat your food which Thou
[1:11:49] shalt eat shall be by weight 20 shekels
[1:11:52] a
[1:11:53] day and from time to time Thou shalt eat
[1:11:55] it so he's on a very strict diet he must
[1:11:57] be starving to death laying there and
[1:12:00] thou shalt drink also Water by measure
[1:12:02] the sixth part of a hen from time to
[1:12:04] time Thou shalt
[1:12:06] drink shall thou drink and thou shalt
[1:12:09] eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt
[1:12:12] bake it with the dung that cometh out of
[1:12:14] a man in their sight later on Ezekiel
[1:12:20] asks he says he says Lord I've lived
[1:12:23] I've lived a good life he says I've
[1:12:25] lived like a priest I haven't let
[1:12:28] anything unclean come into me and then
[1:12:30] God makes concessions with Ezekiel and
[1:12:32] instead of using human dong he allows
[1:12:35] him to use cow dong to cook his
[1:12:40] food still
[1:12:43] rough the man had it had it hard serving
[1:12:47] God
[1:12:49] though Ezekiel chapter
[1:12:53] 7 we continue on with these with these
[1:12:56] prophecies and these these
[1:12:59] symbols he says this let's go to verse
[1:13:03] 23 he says make a chain so Forge a chain
[1:13:08] for the land is full of bloody crimes
[1:13:10] and the city is full of violence so he
[1:13:13] this this chain is an instrument of
[1:13:15] bondage and he says make this chain
[1:13:18] wherefore I will bring the worst of the
[1:13:20] Heathen and they shall possess their
[1:13:21] houses and I will also make the pomp of
[1:13:24] the strong wrong to cease and their holy
[1:13:26] places shall be defiled destruction
[1:13:29] cometh and they shall seek peace and
[1:13:31] there shall be none my Mischief shall
[1:13:33] come upon mischief and rumor shall be
[1:13:35] upon rumor then shall they seek a vision
[1:13:38] of the Prophet but the law Shall Perish
[1:13:41] from the priest and the council from the
[1:13:43] Ancients and the King shall mourn and
[1:13:45] the prince shall be clothed with
[1:13:48] desolation and the hands of the people
[1:13:50] and of the land shall be troubled I will
[1:13:52] do unto them after their way
[1:13:55] and according to their their deserts
[1:13:58] will I judge them and they shall know
[1:14:01] that I am the
[1:14:03] Lord those words as I said I am the Lord
[1:14:07] continually 60 times at least they
[1:14:11] happen in this in this
[1:14:14] book so we move on and remember this is
[1:14:18] just an overview of the Book of Ezekiel
[1:14:20] there are sermons after sermons after
[1:14:23] sermons in this book there are so many
[1:14:25] symbolic things that that happened dur
[1:14:28] during this but but we're looking just
[1:14:30] on kind of outside looking in just
[1:14:33] getting a big picture and we see that
[1:14:36] that again that he's prophesying against
[1:14:40] Jerusalem saying all of this is coming
[1:14:42] very similar to what Jeremiah did and
[1:14:45] then he says
[1:14:47] this verse uh chapter
[1:14:50] nine this is something that all of us
[1:14:53] are very familiar with
[1:14:57] verse one he cried also in mine ears
[1:15:00] with a loud voice saying cause them that
[1:15:03] have charge over the city to draw near
[1:15:05] even every man with his destroying
[1:15:07] weapon in his hand and behold six men
[1:15:09] came from the way of the higher gate
[1:15:11] which lith towards the North and every
[1:15:14] man a Slaughter weapon in his hand and
[1:15:16] one of them was clothed with linen with
[1:15:19] a riter's inkhorn by his side he's
[1:15:21] speaking
[1:15:22] supernaturally with a Rider's inhorn by
[1:15:25] his side and they went in and Stood
[1:15:27] Beside the Brazen Altar and the glory of
[1:15:29] the
[1:15:30] Lord the glory of the god of Israel was
[1:15:33] gone up from the Cherub whereupon he was
[1:15:36] this word
[1:15:38] cherub we we we talked about this a
[1:15:41] little bit in Jeremiah we talked about
[1:15:43] it in Isaiah these are great angels that
[1:15:46] guard the Throne of God they're the ones
[1:15:51] that um they they're just they're very
[1:15:55] very powerful and great angels and
[1:15:59] behold six
[1:16:01] men I said that and the glory of of
[1:16:04] Israel was gone up from the church
[1:16:06] whereof he was in the threshold of the
[1:16:08] house and he called to the man clothed
[1:16:10] with linen which had the riter's inkhorn
[1:16:13] by his side and the Lord said unto him
[1:16:15] go thou in the midst of the city
[1:16:17] throughout the midst of Jerusalem and
[1:16:19] set a mark upon the forehead of the men
[1:16:21] that sigh and cry for all the
[1:16:23] Abominations that be done in the midst
[1:16:26] thereof and the others the ones that
[1:16:29] don't have that
[1:16:31] Mark he said in my hearing go ye after
[1:16:35] them through the city and smite and let
[1:16:38] not your eye spare neither have ye pity
[1:16:43] slay utterly the old and the young both
[1:16:46] maids and little children and women but
[1:16:49] come not near unto any man unto whom is
[1:16:53] the mark
[1:16:55] and begin at My
[1:16:59] Sanctuary he's talking about Jerusalem
[1:17:01] begin at my temple and start killing
[1:17:05] these people start wiping them out but
[1:17:07] those
[1:17:08] ones that sigh and cry for the sins of
[1:17:12] the world don't touch them don't even go
[1:17:15] near
[1:17:18] them
[1:17:22] wow and began at My Sanctuary then they
[1:17:25] began at the ancient men which be were
[1:17:28] before the house so he goes and he sends
[1:17:33] this destroying Angel and I know it's
[1:17:36] it's very much symbolic of
[1:17:39] today and we see all the sins that are
[1:17:42] in the world we see all the problems
[1:17:43] that are in the world and how many
[1:17:46] people cared in ezekiel's time how many
[1:17:50] people were saved I bet you not
[1:17:52] one and we look at today and how many of
[1:17:55] us truly sigh and cry for the sins of
[1:17:59] the world this is going to come up here
[1:18:01] in a minute and it's beautiful that we
[1:18:03] see that Jeremiah was a perfect example
[1:18:05] of
[1:18:06] this so Ezekiel goes on and it's been
[1:18:10] rough so far but then we see a glimmer
[1:18:12] of hope in chapter 11 let's go to
[1:18:14] chapter
[1:18:16] 11 says this moreover the spirit lifted
[1:18:19] me up and brought me into the East Gate
[1:18:20] of the Lord's House which lookth
[1:18:23] Eastward and behold the door of the gate
[1:18:25] 5 and 20 men among whom I saw Janiah the
[1:18:29] son of azure and pelatiah the son of
[1:18:33] bayah princes of the people remember
[1:18:36] that name the
[1:18:39] pela it's like
[1:18:41] pelaton it's a like exercise thing so
[1:18:45] remember that name pelah the son of
[1:18:46] bayah and he said unto me son of man
[1:18:50] these are the men that that devise
[1:18:52] Mischief that G and give Wicked Council
[1:18:55] in this city which say it is not near
[1:18:59] let us build houses this is the cauldron
[1:19:03] and we be the flesh therefore prophesy
[1:19:06] against them so they're saying
[1:19:07] everything's good everything's okay
[1:19:09] don't worry about it therefore prophesy
[1:19:12] against them prophesy oh son of man now
[1:19:15] let's go to verse
[1:19:19] 13 and it came to pass when I prophesied
[1:19:24] that ptia the son of Bah
[1:19:29] died then fell I down upon my face and
[1:19:34] cried with a loud voice and said oh Lord
[1:19:37] God wilt thou make a full end to the
[1:19:41] remnant of Israel so here he is he just
[1:19:45] prophesied send this Angel out with his
[1:19:48] anchorn right on on them those that sigh
[1:19:51] and cry for the sins of the world
[1:19:55] and here is Jeremiah sighing and crying
[1:19:59] for this man pelatiah who is obviously
[1:20:02] an evil man but that he died look at the
[1:20:06] compassion that he
[1:20:08] had again in verse n n uh chapter 9
[1:20:12] verse4 it says and the Lord said unto
[1:20:14] him go thou in the midst of the city
[1:20:16] through the midst of Jerusalem and set a
[1:20:17] mark on the foreheads of the men that
[1:20:19] sigh and cry for the Abominations that
[1:20:21] be done in the midst
[1:20:23] thereof so
[1:20:25] chapter 12 through 24 we continue with
[1:20:29] judgment after judgment after
[1:20:32] judgment rough prophecies so let's go to
[1:20:36] chapter
[1:20:42] 24 and it says this
[1:21:00] the parable of the Boiling Pot um for
[1:21:04] time sake we'll we'll continue on um
[1:21:10] let's go to let's go to Ezekiel 28
[1:21:12] something that is very interesting here
[1:21:15] as we as we go on through this
[1:21:19] book there's many times in the Bible
[1:21:24] sometimes it's hard to distinguish is
[1:21:26] this a spiritual thing or is this a
[1:21:28] natural thing and this is one of those
[1:21:31] times where we're going to see back and
[1:21:32] forth between the two the king of Ty was
[1:21:35] a very arrogant man a very arrogant King
[1:21:37] that lived to the north of um of Israel
[1:21:40] and uh watch the condemnation here verse
[1:21:44] um chapter 28 verse one it says this the
[1:21:47] word of the Lord came again unto me
[1:21:50] saying son of
[1:21:52] man say unto the prince of Tyrus thus
[1:21:55] sayeth the Lord God because thine heart
[1:21:57] is lifted up and thou has said I am a
[1:22:01] God I sit on the seat of God in the
[1:22:04] midst of the Seas yet thou art a man and
[1:22:06] not God though thou set thine heart as
[1:22:09] the heart of God so something is
[1:22:11] influencing there's something
[1:22:12] influencing behind this king of tire
[1:22:15] behind this this Prince as he's
[1:22:17] called so it's hard right here are we
[1:22:20] distinguish is this is he talking about
[1:22:22] the actual king or is he talking about
[1:22:24] about the spirit influencing him behold
[1:22:26] Thou Art wiser than
[1:22:28] Daniel there is no secret that they can
[1:22:31] that they can hide from thee with thy
[1:22:34] wisdom and With Thine understanding thou
[1:22:36] Hast gotten the riches and H has gotten
[1:22:38] gold and silver into thy Treasures by
[1:22:40] thy great wisdom and by thy traffic
[1:22:43] traffic is trade like business hast thou
[1:22:45] increased thy riches and thine heart is
[1:22:47] lifted up because of thy riches
[1:22:49] therefore thus sayeth the Lord God
[1:22:51] because thou Hast set thine heart as the
[1:22:54] heart of God behold therefore I will
[1:22:57] bring strangers upon thee the terrible
[1:22:59] of the Nations and they shall draw their
[1:23:01] swords against thee the beauty of thy
[1:23:03] wisdom and they shall defile thy
[1:23:05] brightness they shall bring thee down to
[1:23:08] the pit and thou shalt die the deaths of
[1:23:11] them that are slain in the midst of the
[1:23:12] Seas wilt thou yet say before him that
[1:23:16] slayeth Thee I am
[1:23:19] God the
[1:23:21] arrogance but Thou shalt be a man and no
[1:23:25] God in the hand of him that slayeth thee
[1:23:28] Thou shalt die the deaths of the
[1:23:30] uncircumcised by the hands of strangers
[1:23:32] for I have spoken it sayeth the Lord God
[1:23:35] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[1:23:37] me saying so now ezekiel's taking he's
[1:23:41] taking a little bit different direction
[1:23:44] before he was addressing this king of Ty
[1:23:48] now he's addressing the spirit that's
[1:23:51] behind him son of man take up a
[1:23:55] lamentation upon the king of Ty and say
[1:23:57] unto him thus sayeth the Lord God thou
[1:24:00] seal us up the sum full of wisdom and
[1:24:02] perfect in
[1:24:04] Beauty thou Hast been in Eden the Garden
[1:24:07] of God when was the king of Ty in Eden
[1:24:11] who was in Eden the serpent was in
[1:24:15] Eden thou has been in Eden the Garden of
[1:24:19] God every precious stone was iy covering
[1:24:22] the Sardis the topaz and the diamond and
[1:24:25] the barrel and the onxx and the Jasper
[1:24:26] and the sapphire Sapphire the emerald
[1:24:28] and the carbunkle and the gold the
[1:24:30] workmanship workmanship of thy T tabrets
[1:24:34] and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in
[1:24:37] the day that thou was created this man
[1:24:40] was this Angel this Spirit was really
[1:24:43] seemed like the greatest of all of them
[1:24:44] Thou Art the anointed
[1:24:47] cherub that
[1:24:51] coverthe so thou was a on the Holy
[1:24:55] Mountain of
[1:24:57] God thou has walked up and down in the
[1:25:00] midst of the stones of fire this man was
[1:25:03] great do you remember the Book of Job
[1:25:06] when Satan comes up before
[1:25:09] God and he says where you been he says
[1:25:13] I've been walking been going to and
[1:25:22] fro thou was perfect perfect in thy ways
[1:25:26] from the day that thou was created till
[1:25:27] the iniquity was found in thee so you
[1:25:30] cherub you great angel that was created
[1:25:33] you were perfect in the in your ways you
[1:25:36] were really one of the greatest of them
[1:25:37] all until there was some iniquity in
[1:25:42] You by the multitude of thy merchandise
[1:25:46] they have filled the midst of thee with
[1:25:47] violence thou has
[1:25:49] sinned therefore I will cast thee as
[1:25:52] profane out of the Mountain of God and I
[1:25:54] will destroy thee Oh covering cherub
[1:25:57] from the midst of the stones of fire
[1:26:00] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[1:26:01] Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by
[1:26:04] reason of thy
[1:26:07] brightness I will cast the
[1:26:10] vanity in this Spirit you've corrupted
[1:26:14] your wisdom because you were so bright
[1:26:16] you are so beautiful and you got your
[1:26:18] eyes on yourself I will cast thee to the
[1:26:21] ground I will lay thee before kings that
[1:26:23] they may be ho thee thou has defiled thy
[1:26:26] sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
[1:26:27] iniquities by the iniquity of thy
[1:26:29] traffic therefore will I bring forth a
[1:26:33] fire from the midst of thee it shall
[1:26:35] devour thee and I will bring thee to the
[1:26:37] ashes upon the Earth in the sight of all
[1:26:39] them that behold thee and
[1:26:42] they that Know Thee among the people
[1:26:45] shall be astonished at thee Thou shalt
[1:26:47] be a terror and shalt never and never
[1:26:51] shalt thou be anymore you see how this
[1:26:55] Spirit was influencing this king of Ty
[1:26:59] how great he was but Ezekiel here he's
[1:27:03] calling this
[1:27:05] out in in Ezekiel
[1:27:09] 33
[1:27:11] um he receives he talks again about this
[1:27:16] Watchman and
[1:27:18] then in verse
[1:27:21] 21 he receives word that isra
[1:27:25] is struck down let's go to verse 21 says
[1:27:28] this and it came to pass on the 20th
[1:27:31] year of our captivity in the 10th month
[1:27:33] in the fifth day of the month that one
[1:27:37] that had escaped out of Jerusalem came
[1:27:39] unto me saying the city is spent so a
[1:27:42] messenger came from Jerusalem all that
[1:27:45] that Ezekiel had been prophesying this
[1:27:48] messenger comes and
[1:27:51] says it's
[1:27:52] Fallen it's
[1:27:57] destroyed now the hand of the Lord was
[1:27:59] upon
[1:28:00] me in the evening a four that he was
[1:28:03] escaped and came and opened my
[1:28:06] mouth until he came to until he came to
[1:28:09] me in the morning and my mouth was
[1:28:11] opened and I was no more dumb and the
[1:28:14] word of the Lord came unto me
[1:28:16] saying son of man they that inhabit
[1:28:20] those Wast of the land of Israel speak
[1:28:21] saying Abraham is one and he inherit
[1:28:24] inherited the land but we are many the
[1:28:26] land is given us for inheritance
[1:28:29] wherefore say unto them thus sayeth the
[1:28:31] Lord God ye eat with the blood and lift
[1:28:33] up your eyes towards the idols and shed
[1:28:36] the blood and shall ye possess the land
[1:28:39] you stand upon your sword you work
[1:28:42] Abomination and you defile everyone his
[1:28:44] neighbor's wife and ye and shall ye
[1:28:47] possess the
[1:28:49] land say thou unto them thus sayith the
[1:28:52] Lord God as I live surely they that are
[1:28:55] in the waste shall fall By The Sword and
[1:28:57] him that is an open field will I give to
[1:29:00] the Beast to be devoured and they that
[1:29:02] be in the Forts and in the caves shall
[1:29:05] die of pestilence so he's talking about
[1:29:07] these people that in invade and they too
[1:29:10] shall fall so then the last chapters of
[1:29:15] Ezekiel they um they they give they give
[1:29:18] some light and they give some good
[1:29:21] things and they they tell of that there
[1:29:26] will come the people will return that
[1:29:30] life will return to Israel and then at
[1:29:34] the end of The Book of Ezekiel and we'll
[1:29:36] close with
[1:29:41] this Ezekiel
[1:29:46] 48 at the very end he's talking about
[1:29:49] this city
[1:29:54] verse 30 he says this and these are the
[1:29:56] goings out of the city of the on the
[1:29:58] North side 4,500 measures and the gates
[1:30:02] of the city shall be after the names of
[1:30:04] the tribes of Israel three gates
[1:30:07] northward one gate of of Reuben one gate
[1:30:10] of Judah one gate of Levi those what I
[1:30:12] talked about at the at the beginning and
[1:30:15] the East 4,5 and3 Gates one gate of
[1:30:20] Joseph and the Gate of Benjamin one gate
[1:30:22] of Dan and the South side 4,500 measures
[1:30:25] and three gates one gate of Simeon gate
[1:30:28] of isachar gate of zebulun and the West
[1:30:31] Side 4,500 with three gates one gate of
[1:30:35] GAD one gate of Asher and one gate of
[1:30:38] Neftali so he's describing
[1:30:41] these how these um sons of Israel these
[1:30:44] children of Israel their their Gates
[1:30:46] will be named after each one and this
[1:30:50] new city this resurrected City and it
[1:30:52] says this in verse 35 it was round about
[1:30:56] 18,000 measures and the name of the city
[1:30:59] from that day shall be the Lord is
[1:31:03] there it's a good way to end such a a
[1:31:07] rough story so he's building they they
[1:31:09] build this new city it's prophesied to
[1:31:11] come in the last and and this last these
[1:31:14] last chapters of Ezekiel many it gives
[1:31:16] the plans of the temple and and the city
[1:31:19] and many people say that well this is
[1:31:22] the blueprint this is the plans for this
[1:31:24] third Temple that's to be built others
[1:31:27] say that no this is a symbolic thing
[1:31:31] that that it's uh all these different
[1:31:34] things symbol symbolize of different um
[1:31:37] different things that will happen but in
[1:31:39] the end the city is
[1:31:42] rebuilt the temple is rebuilt and God
[1:31:47] will return to his City Jerusalem so th
[1:31:51] we have the book of um
[1:31:55] Ezekiel and we see that that he
[1:32:00] prophesied Faithfully he loved the Lord
[1:32:03] he was called to be a priest his 30th
[1:32:06] what seems to be his 30th bir birthday
[1:32:08] he received his commission and laid on
[1:32:12] his side and and and ate certain types
[1:32:15] of food and
[1:32:17] really
[1:32:19] history he wasn't anything when he was
[1:32:22] here but history made him one of the
[1:32:23] greatest prop prophets that ever lived
[1:32:25] and that's the Book of
[1:32:26] Ezekiel it's a powerful
[1:32:30] book my favorite part in there is is
[1:32:33] really the Watchman and how he calls out
[1:32:36] the ministers listen if you know these
[1:32:39] things you tell the people or I will
[1:32:42] require your
[1:32:44] blood they're going to
[1:32:46] die in their
[1:32:48] sins they'll be responsible and you'll
[1:32:52] be responsible but I like the scenario
[1:32:56] of you tell them and then they don't do
[1:32:59] it and then they live well we can uh
[1:33:02] brother Michael you can come with with
[1:33:04] the in
[1:33:06] closing um it's a it really is it's a
[1:33:09] powerful book it's it's a wonderful book
[1:33:11] it's it's a book that you can take so
[1:33:13] many many sermons from
[1:33:18] but it's also tells a story of a devoted
[1:33:22] man
[1:33:24] that was called at a young age that was
[1:33:26] pulled out from his home but that um
[1:33:31] that put God
[1:33:32] first and
[1:33:35] uh his his prophecies really are still
[1:33:40] happening
[1:33:41] today with Israel returning to their
[1:33:43] Homeland he says in here that they're
[1:33:46] going to come back he says that I'm
[1:33:48] going to bless them he says that I will
[1:33:50] make them a new heart right
[1:33:54] I um you know what let me uh let me read
[1:33:57] that I think I have it
[1:34:02] [Music]
[1:34:11] here he says I will put my spirit within
[1:34:14] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:34:18] and ye and ye shall keep my judgments
[1:34:20] and do them and ye shall dwell in the
[1:34:22] land that I gave your father others
[1:34:25] imagine when Ezekiel prophesied that
[1:34:27] when God told
[1:34:29] him the beginning we see that everything
[1:34:32] is lost and then he gives this prophecy
[1:34:36] saying that and you will dwell in the
[1:34:37] land that I gave to your fathers and you
[1:34:39] shall be my people and I will be your
[1:34:41] God and I will also save you from all
[1:34:44] your uncleanness and I will call for the
[1:34:46] corn and will increase it and lay no
[1:34:48] famine upon you and I will multiply the
[1:34:51] fruit of the tree and increase of the
[1:34:52] field that you shall receive no more
[1:34:56] reproach of famine from among the
[1:34:57] Heathen among the Heathen then shall you
[1:35:00] remember your own evil ways and your
[1:35:03] doings that were not good and you shall
[1:35:05] loath yourselves in your own sights for
[1:35:07] your iniquities and for your
[1:35:09] Abominations not for your sakes do I do
[1:35:12] this sayeth the Lord God be it known
[1:35:14] unto you be ashamed and confounded for
[1:35:18] your own ways oh House of Israel he's
[1:35:19] saying
[1:35:21] repent thus sayith the Lord God in the
[1:35:23] days that I shall have cleansed you from
[1:35:27] all your iniquities I will also cause
[1:35:29] you to dwell in the cities and the waste
[1:35:31] there shall be builded and the desolate
[1:35:33] shall be laid shall be tilled whereas it
[1:35:36] shall it laay desolate in the sight of
[1:35:38] all that passed by and they shall say
[1:35:41] this is the land that is desolate has
[1:35:42] become like the Garden of Eden and the
[1:35:45] waste and the desolate and the ruined
[1:35:47] cities are become fenced and are
[1:35:48] inhabited then the Heathen that are left
[1:35:50] round about you shall know that I the
[1:35:53] Lord builded the ruined places and the
[1:35:56] plant that was desolate and the Lord
[1:35:59] have spoken it and I will do it thus
[1:36:01] sayeth the Lord God I will yet for this
[1:36:05] be inquired of by the house of Israel to
[1:36:08] do it for them I will increase them with
[1:36:11] men like a flock as the holy flock as
[1:36:15] the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
[1:36:17] Feast so shall the waste cities be
[1:36:20] filled with flocks of men and they shall
[1:36:22] know that I am the
[1:36:26] Lord that's not happened yet it's
[1:36:28] happening right now I believe look at
[1:36:31] that place over there it's blessed they
[1:36:33] have big farms everything is is fruitful
[1:36:36] everything is multiplying God's
[1:36:38] protecting him that they have their own
[1:36:40] flag they have their own Army and God
[1:36:43] has laid his hand once again upon
[1:36:47] Jerusalem and upon
[1:36:50] Israel our Prophet Ezekiel his words
[1:36:53] coming to pass in this day but

[1:37:08] Lord for your mercy never fails

[1:40:06] Israel just kept on on stayed with them
[1:40:10] they would sin he would send prophets

[1:40:16] then they would sin again and he'd send
[1:40:18] another Prophet get them to
[1:40:21] repent it was it was just the the
[1:40:23] longsuffering and the grace of God that
[1:40:26] he would do that and we see in this Book
[1:40:29] of Ezekiel he didn't change his ways and
[1:40:32] he does it for
[1:40:34] us he he's there for
[1:40:38] us and we sin we mess up but he requires
[1:40:43] a
[1:40:44] repentance and if we would just repent

[1:40:49] want to do it anymore I'm going to I'm
[1:40:50] going to do a better job if we were just
[1:40:53] do that then we would see that grace of
