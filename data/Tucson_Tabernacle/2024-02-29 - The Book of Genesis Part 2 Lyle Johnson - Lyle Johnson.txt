are we safe in Jesus I'm safe ever more thank you so much I need to turn this on and see if we've got the first little slide up there yes that's the title of the sermon tonight it's uh it's Hebrew you probably figured that out and it's it's the first word in the Bible That's translated in the beginning and it is uh barit the Jewish Bible doesn't have the name Genesis or Exodus they use different names so we're going to do part two of beet tonight last week brother Daniel covered the first part of portion of Genesis tonight we'll cover the rest now I assumed he was going to do the first half the first 25 chapters so I'd only have 25 to do and then he said said well brother ly um I might only get to 22 I said well that's okay he got to 15 so we're going to be a little bit busy now I gave my wife a sign so if you see you're holding it up you can for everybody can see she's telling you to slow down because we got about 90 seconds per chapter to cover 35 chapters tonight um but tonight when we cover this we want to be emphasizing the pointers to and the Fingerprints of the Messiah the one we know is Jesus of Nazareth whom we believe to be an embodiment of the very God of barit creation so please join with me once again in prayer as we go to the author not only of the Book of Genesis but the author of The Salvation of our that in whom we put our faith and trust for our Salvation let's go to him Lord Jesus Lord this is such an awesome responsibility to stand in front of your people a portion of the body of Jesus Christ people each one of whom you would have laid your life down for and yet we're a Congregation of such blessed People Help Lord that tonight the words that are spoken be a blessing that answers questions that draws us closer to you Lord Jesus and therefore closer to one another we commit the remainder of this service in your hands forgive me Lord where I've fallen short forgive us all where we've fallen short Lord Lord just help us to be yielded to you accept our praise and worship this evening as we turn to your word in Jesus precious name amen before you're seated I'd like to read a few verses from one of the closing chapters of Genesis these particular verses are ones that strike a deep chord within my soul they give me hope verses that I think reflect the very nature of the one whom we seek to serve the scene is Egypt it's about 1859 BC 17 years after arriving in Egypt Jacob also called Israel has gathered his sons and given them his dying blessings from Ruben the firstborn to Benjamin the youngest after doing this we read in Genesis 49 starting at verse 28 all these are the TW tribes of Israel this is that their father spake unto them and blessed them everyone according to his Blessing he blessed them and he charged them and said unto them I'm to be gathered un to my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the hittite in the cave that's in the field of Mella which which is before Mam and the land of Canan which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the hittite for for for a possession of a burying place there there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife there they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife and and there I buried Leia Leah please be seated there they buried Abraham and and Sarah his wife there they they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife and there I buried Leah this is the verse that got me started years ago and to a desire to dig into the Book of Genesis the transformation of Jacob not just a name change but a nature change his tenderness toward the wife he once hated brother Daniel covered the first part of Genesis last Wednesday from the creation of the universe the first humans the destruction of the flood the saving of Noah and his family the Tower of Babel the story of Abraham migrating to Canan Canan this evening I'll give you an extremely brief overview of the remaining 35 chapters of this remarkable book in that overview I'll share some excerpts that are prophecies Promises of God's commitment to fulfill what he told to Abraham and I want to share the story of a Young Man part of an incredibly dysfunctional family that I think illustrates the very nature of Jesus patient transformation of character spoiler alert not Joseph my hope is that if you haven't already done so after last Wednesday evening you'll grab your bible read the whole book of Genesis it's it's only 50 chapters oh 50 chapters well this is a Sunday school textbook or read chapters 10 or 20 Pages we're talking 40 to 60 Pages depending upon the size of pages and size of type in your Bible couple of hours three hours spread it out over a week if you haven't done it please do it uh you might find it easier to read and follow if you use a newer translation the NIV or NLT or ESV read it not to extract Doctrine but to follow the flow if you do I think you realize as with our recent study the book of Acts these are real people flawed in character flawed in action they're not superheroes they're they're not possessing unique powers they're People Like Us certainly people like me Paul described him in this way he said in 1 Corinthians 1:26 for you see your calling Brethren that not many wise according to the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called so what type of people does God choose but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are Mighty God is the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen and the things which are not to bring to not to bring to nothing the things that are so the one that's ones that God chooses the chosen people the elect are typically the food foolish or the weak or the base or the despised you you get the idea and Paul tells us why that no flesh should glory in his presence it's all about him it's not about us and in Ephesians 1 he says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as Heath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world before barit that we should be not that we are but that we might become holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of our our steadfastness no of our accomplishment oh no to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein by or through which he hath made us accepted and the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to not our efforts but to The Riches of his grace he he didn't choose us because we're Superstars he chose us because he is the Superstar and that is in part what Genesis is all about what it illustrates what it tells us as it sets the stage for the entire Bible God's grace accepted through faith let's start with the review of the call of Abram Genesis 12 verse1 we read now the Lord had said to Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee curse him that curseth thee and in thee through you Abraham shall all families of the earth be blessed speaking of the Messiah of Jesus Abram was aged 75 era was Sarah Sarai was aged 65 and the nephew lot moved with them from Haron after Abram's father nahor died and they came to Canan and you can see here on the map those of you that are sitting close to the front can see on the map those of you in the back have to take my word for it that up here we have Haron down here we have uh the the promis and we have sheum we have uh I can't see it either we have beers a uh heon and you can see the scale of Miles 300 miles so they they had about a 350 400 mile walk ahead of them I hope they didn't have the amount of baggage to carry that we tend to have so brother Daniel took us through chapter 15 so we're going to go on to chapter 16 I'm just going to give you a brief overview of these chapters we'll dig down into a couple of places as we move along chapter 16 sirar I suggests that we've married a long time haven't had any kids so conceive a child by her Egyptian slave Hagar he agrees Hagar gets pregnant and she despises Sarai Sarai becomes very cruel to Hagar causing Hagar to flee into the desert the Lord tells Hagar go back go back that she'd have a son Ishmael God hears who will be wild and at odds with those around him Ishmael is born a son whom Abraham dearly loves Abraham is 86 years old This Time chapter 17 at age 99 the Lord appears to Abram affirms his promise that he will be the ancestor of many nations and changes his name to Abraham we read 177 I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God and God said unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their Generations this is my Covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every Manchild among you shall be circumcised he goes on to change sarai's name to Sarah tells him he will have a sum by her to be named Isaac Abraham pleads for Ishmael God promises to make him a great nation but tells him that the Covenant is to be through Isaac God leaves Abraham at age 99 is circumcised along with Ishmael age 13 and all the men in his house chapter 18 God comes to visit Abraham along with two angels we're all familiar with this story Abraham is told that Sarah will be pregnant within a month and sends two angels to investigate Sodom Abraham pleads for the people of Sodom and is told that if there are 10 righteous in it God will not destroy it chapter 19 the Angels rescue lot and his family thus god making sure that not only are there not 10 righteous that there are zero righteous in it as they leave Lot's wife looks back and dies changes into a pillar of salt Sodom is destroyed by fire from heaven lot and his daughters flee to a cave lot's two daughters think think that they're alone in the world they just saw all this destruction so they plot they get lot drunk and each one seduces him and is pregnant as a result and the lines of Moab think of the story of Ruth or the entire book of Deuteronomy it's all said in Moab and Aman are the result chapter 20 Abraham moves South to guer tells Sarah to say she's his sister that this is his his pregnant wife as in chapter 12 this is now the second time Abraham goes around deceiving a king aimc which is which it's a title I think rather than a name it means my father King kind of like Pharaoh so he takes her for his heram God tells aimc that Sarah is married to Abraham and to restore her or perish and further says that Abraham is his prophet and must pray for ailec this guy that lied to you he's my prophet and he's got to pray for you where you're going to be in big trouble strange how God works aimc gives Abraham great wealth tells him to live where he wants tells Sarah the money gave Abraham will clear her reputation Abraham prays ABC's household previously Barren becomes fruitful with children chapter 21 Isaac is born he's circumcised on the eighth day at his weaning Sarah wants Hagar and ishma cast out get rid of these people they're they looked at me funny Abraham doesn't want to do it but God tells him are you listening Brothers God tells him listen to Sarah Hagar and Ishmael leave they're running out of supplies in the desert lay down to die God hears not Hagar's cries but ishmael's cries and rescues them ishma grows up marries an Egyptian becomes an Archer Abraham and ailec have a confrontation over water rights they settled their differences at beeva be means uh well and cheva means seven but it also means completion it's a sign of a completed Covenant or contract so be cheva that plays a role in here a bit later as well chapter 22 God asks Abraham to sacrifice Isaac he agrees they travel to mount Mariah in Genesis 22:5 Abraham said unto his young men abide you here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you remember remember Abraham's an old man he's 115 or 20 his voice isn't so strong a bit like mine Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and they climb up this this mountain in the Judean Hills leaving the plane and going up to an elevation of about 2500 feet is about the peak there and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said Dad uh my father and he said here I am I am my son and he said behold I see the fire in the wood but where's the lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering and so they went both of them together just as Abraham is about to kill Isaac to sacrifice him an angel stops him a ram is caught nearby and they sacrifice it instead Isaac and the ram in different ways symbolize the eventual death of Jesus on the nearby Mount Calvary just a few hundred yards away Genesis 23 starts and tells us Sarah was 107 and2 years old these were the years of the life of Sarah so at this point Abraham's 137 ishmael's 50 Isaac is 37 Sarah died in curiot Alba the same as Hebron in the land of Canan and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her I quote this because Sarah is the only woman in the Bible I I believe this is correct whose age and death and burial all three are each distinctly recorded others we know where they died how they died but not how old they were Sarah is is unique Abraham negotiates the purchase of a cave for burial and berries are there this is the burial cave mentioned by Jacob in our opening verses this evening three years pass and in chapter 24 we read that Abraham was old and well stricken in age in fact he's now 140 years old the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things and Abraham said unto elzer his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I will make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the Earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but thou shall go into my country andto my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac and the servant said unto him what par Adventure what if the woman will not be willing to follow me into this land must I needs bring thy son again into the land from whence thou camest and Abraham said unto him beware thou bring not my son thither again the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his angels before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from F and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then Thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my my son thither again and the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swear to him concerning this matter note Abraham's insistence that Isaac not leave Canan not leave Canaan in fact Isaac is the only member of the line of Patriarchs that does not leave the promised land Abraham Jacob all of Jacob's sons leave all spend time in Egypt Isaac is the exception there's a lot being said with this but we're constrained by time tonight 35 chapters 90 seconds get going loud Abraham sends his servant eleazer of Damascus to Mesopotamia Syria and he finds Rebecca granddaughter of Abraham's brother nahor he gives her gifts indicating there's more where those came from similarly the gift of the holy spirit is the earnest of our Redemption it's glorious but there's more and better where that came from she agrees to go with elaser to Canon upon her arrival she marries Isaac this chapter types or models the Holy Spirit sent to seek out a bride for Christ for you and I trust for me well Flash Forward about 35 years Abraham dies at age 175 Isaac at this point age 75 and ishmail at this point P age 88 bury him in the cave next to Sarah ishmael's descendants are listed in this chapter and another Flash Forward of an additional 49 years we're told that ishmail dies at age 137 when Isaac is 124 then it goes back to the story timeline still in chapter 25 after 20 years of marriage when Isaac is 60 the twins Esau and Jacob are born to Isaac and Rebecca they have very different Natures Esau Isaac's favorite is a hunter Jacob Rebecca's favorite Cooks Reds sto Jacob gets Esau's riter the firstborn from Esau at about age 15 according to Jewish sources Esau which means means hairy is also called Edom which means red I suspect maybe he had red hair chapter 26 opens with God's promises to Isaac and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham and in fact we'll see that famine caused by lack of rain is a major factor in the movements of the Patriarchs Isaac went unto to ailec King of the Philistines unto guer and the Lord appeared unto him and said go not down into Egypt dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of again Isaac never left the land of promise sojourn in this land that's the condition that's the command and these are the promises this is the result of this obedience I will be with thee and will bless thee For unto thee and unto thy seed thy descendant I will give all these countries all this land all this ground and I will perform the oath which I swear unto Abraham thy father I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these countries and here's the one that applies to us and thy seed shall all the nations all the peoples of the earth be blessed pointing to the Future Messiah and here's why your line will be chosen to bring this blessing to all the peoples of the world Isaac because that Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my Commandments my statutes my laws Isaac stays in this area he lies about his wife to aimc claiming she's his sister remember these are flawed people and no doubt he learned this trick from his father Abraham Isaac I I this worked for me twice you might want to keep it in mind so he becomes a successful farmer note aimc my father the king it's probably a title and not a name and and similar to Pharaoh but in any event it's not the same guy that decades earlier Abraham had dealt with Isaac is asked to leave and lives in what we now call the neab the southern part of Israel think of it as Northern SI he digs Wells for water gets into quarrels with the locals over water rights aimc makes a treaty with Isaac Esau marries two local women the twins are now 40 years old meaning that Isaac is 100 years old we move into chapter 27 Isaac is old and blind if you do the math from the other clues in the Genesis text I'll do it for you so you don't have to take notes and go back and calculate you'll realize at this time Isaac's 137 years old making Jacob and Esau 77 years old Isaac wants to bless his sons before he dies so he tells Esau go out and Hunt me up some vettis and then oh I'll make you a real good blessing then so Esau goes out meanwhile what happens Jacob in collusion with Rebecca and it's more likely Rebecca in collusion with Jacob tricks Isaac into blessing Jacob thinking he's Esau his favorite and the firstborn Esau comes back and is enraged Rebecca tells Jacob to flee for his life to haran and Syria and to his mother's brother his uncle laan chapter 28 begins with Isaac sending Jacob on his way from Beva to Syria meanwhile Isaac knowing that his parents don't like the local ladies marries a distant cousin a descendant of ishmail not a Canaanite hoping that this will please his parents chapter 28 verse 10 we read that Jacob went out from Bersa and went towards haran we know that that's 350 or 400 miles it's going to take him a while to walk that he lighted upon a certain place one long days walking trying to get away from Esau he carried there all night because the sun was set he took the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the Earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac does that seem a little strange Isaac's his father in Biblical Hebrew they don't have grandfather and Grandson in Biblical Hebrew ancestors are always father descendants are begat and are called seed or Sons or daughters or child or children regardless of the number of generations that separate them don't get tripped up by this especially when you read lists of names in the genealogies and discover gaps and inconsistencies I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land wherein thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed to thy descendants and thy seed shall be as is the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the East and to the north and to the South and in thee and in thy seed speaking of the Messiah shall all the families of the earth be blessed Jacob's frightened but if you remember with his uh with his Stu and his brother he's Jacob's a Wheeler Dealer right so he he builds a pillar an alter requires many stones a pillar is one stone so he takes the stone he's been sleeping on sets it up as a pillar and and he vows if God Elohim will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and rment to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace remember he's fleeing for his life from his brother Esau the hunter then shall the Lord capital L O R D be my God and this Stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house his Temple and all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee chapter 29 Jacob gets to his relatives in Syria he sees Rachel wants to marry her agrees to work for his uncle laben for seven years in Li of a dowy he only has a stick in what he's carrying Rachel has an older sister Leah who has tender eyes but Jacob wants Rachel who is beautiful and well- favored he works for seven years they celebrate with a feast and at age 84 Jacob marries Rachel except that it turns out when you wakes up in the morning that laan unbeknownst has substituted Leah for Rachel Jacob's not real happy about this he agrees to work for another seven years for laan if he can marry Rachel so a week goes by and the have a second wedding and now he marries Rachel uh Leah's slave a lady named zilpa goes with Leah that's her slave her property and Rachel slave BHA accompanies Rachel we're told that Jacob hates Leah and loves Rachel God makes Leah very fertile and Rachel Baron Leah has four sons in Rapid order Reuben Simeon Levi and Judah Chapter 30 Jacob has seven more sons and one daughter from Leah we get isachar zebulun and the daughter Dina bilha we get Dan and Neftali zilpa we get God and Asher and eventually through Rachel Joseph Jacob's now 91 years old he's tired he wants to go home laan persuades him to stay and work for a while to get flocks and herds get get get a little more wealth well there's trickery involved in this laan is trying to trick Jacob and Jacob has a few tricks up his uh 91y old sleeve and he he tricks laben as well there neither one of them are particularly upright in all of this stuff so they're cheating Each Other Well after 31 chapter six chapter 31 excuse me after six more years at age 97 Jacob has finally had enough and gained enough wealth laan is unhappy and God tells Jacob to go back home his wives agree and they set out sneaking out from laan Rachel steals her dad's idols and takes them with her three days later laan finds out they've left and after seven more days of pursuit he tracks him down just before he gets there God Appears to laan and says Don't Hurt Jacob be careful so Laban and Jacob make peace Jacob can turn continues the journey West if I'm going too fast on some of this stuff tap Heather on the shoulder and have her hold up that sign chapter 32 Jacob is afraid of Esau who he hears is traveling with 400 men toward him 400 this can't be good Jacob sends ahe a large offering splits up his family in case Esau means him harm if he kill if he attacks these people the rest of us can get away over here that night before he meets Esau he wrestles with a man we're told all night he Demands a blessing the man touches Jacob's thigh causing him to limp afterwards the man tells Jacob he's wrestled with God and prevailed changes his name from Jacob to Israel and departs from Jacob supp planter heel Grabber to Israel with God and departs chapter 33 Jacob meets Esau peacefully Esau heads home Jacob says he'll follow him but instead he goes the opposite direction and heads to sukot sometime later he travels onto shakam buys land and pitches his tent there and Builds an altar so he sees Esau over here Esau heads down here to Mount seir Jacob comes to sukot Settles for a while comes over here to Shak buys some land and settles there well we get to chapter 34 Jacob's daughter Dina goes into town to meet some other young women she's seized and raped by the son of the leader of the Town a guy named sheam the same name as the town itself his dad hamor hore means donkey goes to Jacob to try and arrange a marriage Dina's brothers are angry and two of them in particular Simeon and Levi work out a way to disable the men of the Town by convincing them they had to be circumcised they thus weaponized the Govern the Covenant between God and Abraham's descendants they turned the blessing the Covenant of God turned it into a weapon while the men of sheam are recovering from this the two brothers go into the town kill all the men take the women and children and steal the wealth of the town of the Town Jacob is pretty unhappy about this obviously so in chapter 35 God tells Jacob who's here in she who's here in sheim to go down to bethl that's the place where he set up that rock where he slept where he saw the vision of the ladder nobody pursues them Jacob Builds an altar God renews his pledge to make Jacob's descendants a large multitude they leave bethl they're heading south towards Isaac down here in Hebron and as they get as far here as Bethlehem here's Jerusalem so just the other side of Jerusalem Rachel goes into labor we don't know how old she is she gives birth to she calls him benoni and Jacob says no he's Benjamin son of my right hand she dies in child birth and she's buried there according to the Jewish Sage Rashi Ruben is incensed that Jacob has moved BHA Rachel's slave into his tent after Rachel's death a huge disrespect to his mother Leah the Bible tells us that Ruben violates bilha sacrificing his position as the first born to force Jacob to recognize Leah Jacob is enranged of course never forgives his son we see this in the blessings of chapter 49 well the family eventually gets to heon down here to Isaac Isaac dies at age 180 he's buried by Esau and Jacob the twins are at this time 120 years old chapter 36 lists the descendants of Esau I'm not going to read the list also known as Edom Esau is the Father the paternal ancestor of the they play roles further down I think when you get to the New Testament and you find out where Herod the Great is from that you're going to discover that he's from Edom chapter 37 The Story begins of Joseph it's the focus of Genesis until the end of the book we have 14 Chapters at least 13 of which are focused around Joseph to do Joseph's story Justice we'd have to spend I don't know between six and 13 Services I think but we can't do that we can't do it certainly not tonight so chapter 37 Joseph has two dreams he's about 17 years old which his family interprets as them bowing down to him his brothers which hate him why because his father favors him as I said it's a dysfunctional family they hate him the more because of his dreams as you have seen in wi see this is a very dysfunctional family but God chooses such to show his power as we read earlier so Jacob sends Joseph to check on his brothers who were pastoring the flocks near sheam so Jacob's down here in heon he thinks that the 10 of his sons are supposed to be up here in sheim with the flock pastoring them and you have to scratch your head and think why would they go to sheam I mean this is a place where they they did a lot of bad stuff and you can't imagine that the neighboring people around there are very fond of these guys so dangerous place well Joseph gets there and he's told that no no they've moved on to Dothan so Joseph follows on up to Dothan to track him down and see how they're doing as he approaches them the brothers plot to kill him Reuben rescues him by suggesting they put him in a pit an empty sstn Reuben intends to retrieve him later and return him home and if you're familiar with the geography you'll know that Dothan is its South End of the valley of megido and they're going to put Joseph in a pit and we read in Revelation about somebody else going into a pit after a battle at Armageddon there's all sorts of interesting uh parallels and links going on here well they see a caravan of ishmaelites from Midian and Judah suggests let's not kill him let's sell Joseph after all this is our brother we don't want to be guilty of his blood so they decide that they're going to sell him to this Caravan of ishmaelites and there's whole another chain of story going on there but what happens then is they sell Joseph to this Caravan that's coming along here they take his special coat that his father made for him they dip it in the blood of a of a baby goat of a kid and they bring her back to Jacob and who identifies it sorry who identifies it as Joseph and he goes into mourning Joseph is taken down to Egypt somewhere down over here and sold into slavery to potier the captain of the pharaoh's guard in Egypt chapter 38 about the time Joseph arrives in Egypt this chapter tracks the next 20 or 21 years of judah's life I want to cover this in a little bit of depth because it's not often read or taught but first a little bit about Judah he's the fourth son of Jacob and Leah his name means praise it's the first mention of Praise in the Bible but let's look a little closer I've I put up here English letters if I can get the right button and the Hebrew letters so this is what we sometimes call Jehovah yud he B that's it's never pronounced in Hebrew they say adoni which means Lord it means Lord or God but you see here judah's name it's actually Yehuda it's it's not Judah it's Yehuda and you can see the yud V with with a d adalot the fourth letter of the Hebrew alphabet in it meaning praise y DH which is also part of that name yadada it literally means hand but it means praise it also means Thanksgiving it also means confession Yehuda is the only one of Jacob's sons whose name includes the name of God the rabbis say that it envelopes God's name in Praise well let's just read a little bit from chapter 3 38 it came to pass at that time after they delivered the coat to Jacob that Yehuda went down from his Brethren he ran away and turned to a certain adullamite whose name was hyra so he leaves home lives in a Canaanite town and hangs out with this guy that becomes his friend in the area be careful who your friends are they can influence you and you can influence them and we can see here that going from heon to Abdullah it's you know maybe 10 miles you can sit on the ridge where adum is and look back in Hebron and at night with there's a fire he could see home he wasn't that far away but he ran away his leaving has a couple of negative effects first Jacob has now suffers not only the loss of his favorite son Joseph but also of his next in line to be the leader of the brothers Yehuda you say well what about Simeon and Levi well we'll get to them probably uh when we get to Exodus but Reuben has violated things he's out of order Simeon and Levi when you read the blessings in chapter 49 you'll discover that Jacob says stay away from these guys so Judah would have been the next in line anyway so he's lost Judah as well as Joseph and the rabbis tell us Jacob became suspicious that Judah is somehow involved in the death of Joseph or why else would he run away well Judah marries an unnamed Canaanite woman and has three sons by her the oldest one is named ER and marri's a local woman named Tamar ER is wicked we don't know in what way and God slays him we don't know why when or how we just know that he was a very bad guy and God slays him the Second Son Onan under the laws of levate marriage refuses to have a child by her levate marriage was a practice they had in these days they didn't have social security and and all of these other sorts of support programs so so a widow depended upon her children to for support through her final years and so forth so it was very important so uh the the late marriage it's spoken about in Deuteronomy some 450 years later was a little bit different at at this time but the basic concept is that if your brother dies without a child and there's another brother the next brother and line he has to marry the deceased Widow and raise a child in the name of the deceased um not in the Moses version but but likely what's going on here if no brother is available then it's the father-in-law's duty to produce a child with his daughter-in-law to to raise a child in the in the name name of of that son that died well on doesn't want to have a child for ER likely because with ER dead and without an heir onan's going to have the birthright and he'll get the greater portion of the inheritance why would he want somebody else to have it especially not even in his name so uh Onin deceitfully uses tomorrow and he abuses her God kills him too we get to verse 11 then said Judah Yehuda to Tamar his daughter-in-law remain a widow at thy father's house till Shaya my third son my youngest be grown for he said lest peradventure perhaps he die also as his Brethren did tomorrow went and dwelt in her father's house so Judah sends her away until his third son Shaya will be old enough to marry well Shaya getss old enough but Judah never s for tomorrow after all his first two sons are dead after marrying her he's probably thinking well this lady is cursed there's something going on here and if I give my third son to her he's going to die too this is a bad deal she can just stay at her father-in-law's house and I'll just keep Sheila over here and and and that'll be fine so there's a lesson that God is teaching Judah like Jacob Judah has lost two two sons like Jacob who dots on Joseph his 11th son Jude is now protecting his young son God's teaching Judah something here very painful lesson chapter 12 in the process of time the daughter of shua shua being judah's father-in-law the daughter of shua J judah's wife died Judah was comforted he went up to his sheep shearers to timna he he and his friend hyra the adullamite so judah's wife died like like Jacob Judah now knows the grief of losing his wife sheep sharing is a time for celebration and the local religion in practice it's time for Deery it was told Tamar saying Behold thy father-in-law goeth up to timna to sheare his sheep here's another gigantic journey of 10 miles from ulum down here in the plain to timna so we read she put her widow's garments from offer covered her with a veil wrapped herself sat in an open place which is by the weight of timna for she saw that Shaya was grown and she was not given unto him to wife Judah is violating the levate law which he had promised to fulfill when Judah saw her he thought her to be in Harlot because she'd covered her face she knows her father-in-law pretty well he red her by the way and said go too I pray thee let me come in unto thee he knew not she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will you give me that thou mayest come in unto me and he said I will send thee a kid from The Flock and she seeing he had no goats with him said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it and he said what pledge shall I give thee and she said thy signant the ring you used to for legal documents thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it her and came under her and she conceived by him she arose went away laid away her veil from her put on the garments of her widowhood telling the world of judah's faithlessness well Judah goes to timna he sees his Harlot by the road approaching bargain for her favors has nothing of commercial value gives her his staff race its ins signant ring until he can arrange payment in the form of a kid from his flock of goats those items bear his name the symbols of his authority when he sends the payment a a a goat kid to get his stuff back the woman can't be found he doesn't know that tomorrow was the woman that he thought was the Harlot it came to pass about three months after that it was told Judah saying Tomar thy daughter-in-law hath played the Harlot and also behold she is with child by wh Judah said bring her forth let her be burnt such a vile cruel way to take another's life did you really think she was cursed perhaps but like the story in the Gospel of John no one seems interested in finding the male involved and now we're going to see a change when she was brought forth she could have done a lot of things she could have publicly identified Judah but she put her life in the hands of the one condemning her to an awful fate she sent to her father-in-law saying by the man whose these are I am with child and she said discern I pray thee whose are these the signant the bracelet the staff she hands him this stuff he realized that she tricked him to raise a child for her according to leverate law she forced him to do his leverate duty for for her to have a son discern this Hebrew word is exactly the word that's used when the brothers bring the coat to Jacob and they discern is this Joseph's coat it's also to examine to acknowledge and so forth verse 26 and Jacob acknowledged that same word he discerned he identifi them and said she now he's not talking to her he doesn't say thou no he's talking to the crowd that's gathered for this horrible thing they're going to do he's making a public proclamation of his guilt and her innocence she has been more righteous than I because that I gave her not to Shayla my son and he knew her again no more Judah is a changed man and his Rebellion he was about to kill his own unborn children or Child by fire she Bears twin boys Zarah for ER FZ for Judah FZ will be in the Messianic genealogy and it's kind of curious he got twin boys but one of them is his grandson and one of them is the uncle of the other it's uh it's a kind of a strange relationship for twins but but there you go the text doesn't say but Judah returns home with Tamar Shayla and the twins meanwhile now we roll back to 20 or 21 years to the story of Joseph most of you are familiar with this at some level it's a quarter of the Book of Genesis but we'll quickly skim through it Joseph worked Piper's Fields that's who he was sold to he did well for his master he's promoted to overseer of his house Piper's wife tries to seduce Joseph fails and claims she was attacked by him the opposite of Judah Joseph goes to prison he's put in charge and again he's successful in that context chapter 40 Pharaoh's Chief Baker and Butler are put in the very same prison under Joseph's care they each have a dream which Joseph interprets accurately the baker is to be executed the butler returned to his office this happens exactly as Joseph said and then there's a blank space between chapter 40 and chapter 41 two years pass you can imagine Joseph is in the prison they're thinking okay well he's going to tell them about this and it's going to be good and I'm going to get out of this place and day passes and a week passes and a month passes and a year passes and two years two years later Pharaoh dreams he's troubled by what he dreams no one can interpret the dreams and then the butler remembers Joseph interpreted his dream accurately Joseph is summoned he interprets Pharaoh's dream there's going to be seven years of plenty followed by seven years of severe famine as a result he's put in charge of Egypt second only to Pharaoh he's given an Egyptian wife has two sons manasse which means causing to forget and Ephraim or Ephraim which means double fruit the seven years of plenty ensue and then the famine begins it's in the entire region not just Egypt Joseph is in charge of grain distribution chapter 42 the famine has reached Canan and Jacob sends his sons except Benjamin to buy grain in Egypt they come to Joseph they don't know who he is he accuses them of being spies he puts them in prison for three days over here's what's going on he discovers that Reuben was against the plot to kill or sell him so when he sends them back he keeps the number two son Simeon as a hostage he sends them the way with a requirement that they bring Benjamin with them when they return He arranges to have their payment put back in the their sacks of grain they returned to Canan tell Jacob that Benjamin has to go with them next time Reuben tries but fails to convince Jacob to send them back with Benjamin chapter 43 Jacob's Clan runs out of food as the famine progresses and the changed Judah steps up Jacob is not about to send Benjamin down Judah spoke un saying the man did solemnly protest unto us saying you shall not see my face except your brother be with you if thou Wilt send our brother with us we'll go down and we'll buy thee food but if thou will not send him we will not go down the man said unto us you shall not see my face except your brother be with you and Israel said wherefore D she so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother and they said the man asked us straightly of our state and of our Kindred saying is your father yet alive have ye another brother we told him according to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would say bring your brother down Judah said to Israel's father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones if if we don't go we're going to starve to death Benjamin's going to be dead along with all of us the changed Judah I will be shity for him of my hand shalt thou require him if I bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame forever reluctantly realizing they'll all die including Benjamin if they don't get more grain Jacob allows them to return to Egypt he sends Benjamin with him along with double payment for the Grain and some gifts for the man that they don't know is Joseph Joseph sets A Feast for them in his house he brings Simeon out of the prison and he sets them in order from oldest to youngest this amazes the brothers the Bible says they're amazed why are they amazed the SE 11 guys born over space of seven years all but Benjamin in their 40s why would they be amazed well this is where my inner nerd has to come out if you have 11 people and you put them in order or put them in another order how many different ways can you seat 11 different people no guesses 39,9 2016, 1800 different ways now love you want to get up here and try all these combinations will be here for a very long time so the odds are about 1 in40 million that he could guess correctly one in40 million well this helps when he has them convinced he has powers of divination chapter 44 Joseph arranges for their money to put in their grain sacks sends them all on their way but also his silver cup this look yeah well that's plastic but his was silver that it's his divination cup uh and he has that put in his but the silver cup is to be put into Benjamin's sack so shortly after they leave Joseph sends his Steward to overtake them accuse him of theft of his divination cup find the cup and bring Benjamin back the brothers are all shocked and they all return with Benjamin to Joseph and now we see the changed Judah the new Judah not just pleading with his dad in Canaan but following through in Egypt with this strange powerful man I have to read this section of the story Genesis 44 Verse 18 then Judah came near unto Joseph and said oh my Lord let thy servant I pray thee speak a word in my Lord's ears let not thine anger burn against thy servant for even as Pharaoh my Lord asked his servants saying have you a father or a brother and we said unto my Lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loves him and and you said to your to thy servants bring him down unto me that I may set my eyes upon him and and we said unto my Lord the lad cannot leave his father if he should leave his father his father would die and th say unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more' and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my Lord and our father said oh go again and and buy us a little food and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then we will go down for we may not see the man's face except our youngest brother be with us and thy servant my father said unto us you know that my wife bear me two sons and the one went out from me and I said surely he's torn in pieces and I saw him not since if you take this also from me and Mischief befall them you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave now therefore I come to thy servant when I come to my thy servant my father and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life it shall come to pass when he seeth the lad is not with us he'll die thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the Grave for thy servant May Judah I became shy for the lad unto my father saying if I bring him not unto thee then I shall bear the blame to my father forever now therefore I pray thee I beg of you let thy servant let me abide instead of the L had a bondman a slave to my Lord and let the lad go up with his brethren for how shall I go to my father and the lad be not with me lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father Judah pleads for Benjamin and ask to be substituted and become Joseph slave outlining the grief that will kill Jacob if Benjamin does not return Judah who campaigned to sell Joseph into slavery in Egypt is now pleading to become a slave to Joseph in Egypt What A Change chapter 45 Joseph tells his brothers who he is tells them there's still five years of famine to come to bring Jacob and their families to Egypt and he will take care of them Pharaoh agrees to all this and sends wagons and gifts with them to Jacob chapter 46 Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beva and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father Isaac so here's heon where they've been they get as far as Beva it's not all that great of a distance but remember this is the Jacob that ran away was happy to leave Canaan in fear of Esau his brother now he's back in the land he as badly as he wants to see Joseph he will not leave unless the Lord gives him leave he won't leave the land even for something as important to him as this God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said Jacob Jacob and he said here I am and he said I am God the god of thy father fear not to go down into Egypt for I will there make of thee a great nation I will go down with thee into Egypt and I will also surely bring thee up again and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes right when you die Joseph will be there to close your eyes Jacob though he longs to see Joseph won't leave without permission from God Jacob has changed too Jacob and the whole clan traveled to Egypt to Goan and the Nile Delta the richest Farmland in Egypt the clan totaling 70 Joseph is reunited with Jacob and prepares to bring him before Pharaoh chapter 47 the family comes before pharaoh and settles in Goan meanwhile chapter 47 people run out of money to buy Grain Joseph says well then give me the deed give me the deed to your ranch right so he acquires all the land for pharaoh and after that they don't have land they don't have money they're still of H and he says well you could be Pharaoh slaves you could be bondmen we're going to put some heavy taxes on you for for all time so Joseph makes Pharaoh very secure and very powerful well Jacob nears death makes Joseph swear to return his body to Canaan for burial chapter 48 is a little unusual here Jacob blesses Joseph's sons and claims them as his own he says eph and Manassa they're mine I have 14 Sons now these are my sons if you have any more Sons they're your sons but these two are mine he tells Joseph he too will return to Canan and gives Joseph the right of the firstborn the double portion consider when they later on when we read about the Book of Joshua and you'll find that Ephraim and Manasseh each get an inheritance a division of the land so Joseph thus through Manasseh and Ephraim gets that double portion chapter 49 Jacob blesses his sons we'll just read about Judah now and we'll read about another perhaps when we look at Exodus Genesis chter 49 verse 8 Judah UD Yehuda Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee Judah is a lion's welp from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion as an old lion who shall Rouse him up the scepter shall not depart from Judah no or walk ever from between his feet until Shido means tranquil secure the Messiah come and unto him the Messiah shall the Gathering of the people be binding his fo unto the vine and an ass's cult unto the choice Vine he washed his garments and wine and his clothes and the blood of grapes his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk he charges them to bury him alongside Leah in the Tomb Abraham purchased as we read when we began this evening and Jacob dies at age 147 chapter 50 Jacob is inbombed and his body returned to Canan for burial Upon returning to Egypt the family fears Joseph will turn against them Joseph takes care of them instead and finally in chapter 50 Joseph said unto his Brethren I die God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swear to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob Joseph took an oath the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and you shall carry up my bones from hence Joseph believed those promises so Joseph died being 110 years old they inbombed him and he was put in a coffin in Egypt what a contrast in the beginning God in a coffin in Egypt God's testimony we read of Joseph in the New Testament if the musicians would please come Hebrews 11 verse 22 we read by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones speaking of Faith of Our brief overview of Genesis the theme that resonates throughout is captured I Believe by Paul in his letter to the Ephesians Ephesians 2:8 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it's a gift of God it's not of Works lest any man should boast Genesis Grace and Faith Grace is not a new
