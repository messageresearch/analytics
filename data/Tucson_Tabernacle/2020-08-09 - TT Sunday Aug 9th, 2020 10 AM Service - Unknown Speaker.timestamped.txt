[31:16] you
[31:20] amen we do have some requests and a
[31:23] couple of things to bring to your
[31:25] attention
[31:27] um there's a brother from
[31:31] he's living in phoenix now but when my
[31:34] dad was doing the work in
[31:35] mexico he would stop him and visit him
[31:38] in a town called embodiment which is
[31:40] close to wymas and the brother helped my
[31:42] dad quite a bit
[31:44] but he called my father yesterday
[31:45] morning crying his
[31:48] his son the brother's name is oscar
[31:50] aviles and his son
[31:52] oscar passed away yesterday the whole
[31:55] family had been struck with kobets
[31:57] several months ago
[31:59] and they'd seem to recover it but his
[32:02] son
[32:03] started hanging around with the wrong
[32:04] crowd and yesterday he came home
[32:07] and he passed away so i asked dad how
[32:11] old brother oscar was he figured he was
[32:12] in his late 40s maybe early 50s his son
[32:15] was in his 20s
[32:16] so he was a very brokenhearted this
[32:18] morning
[32:20] and so we we told him we would remember
[32:22] him in prayer
[32:24] and we got a report
[32:27] that my uncle john we mentioned it
[32:30] wednesday
[32:31] but that his lungs were full of blood
[32:33] clots
[32:35] also got a report that at the spanish
[32:38] tabernacle there are
[32:39] very many sick with covet in the church
[32:43] we have two two folks that contact us
[32:45] that we're related to
[32:47] and they have actually had some pass
[32:49] away but they're kept very quiet about
[32:52] it
[32:53] but it has it has affected quite a few
[32:55] families there are some in the hospital
[32:57] there's some at home
[33:01] and some of them are still attending
[33:02] church so it's it's gotten very critical
[33:05] so
[33:07] there are brothers and there are sisters
[33:08] okay some folks
[33:10] have their issues and things but god be
[33:14] merciful to me and if i want him to be
[33:15] merciful to me i must be merciful to
[33:17] others
[33:18] that's that's how god works so let's
[33:21] remember them
[33:22] and this morning my sister-in-law is
[33:24] elizabeth is here and
[33:27] she's been having a lot of problems with
[33:28] vertigo and
[33:30] the doctors told her she has i think
[33:32] it's called menaire's disease
[33:34] which causes vertigo and the doctors
[33:36] told her it was incurable
[33:38] but we talked to another doctor the
[33:40] doctor of doctors
[33:42] and he has a whole different prognosis a
[33:45] whole different way to deal with things
[33:47] and
[33:47] i'm so glad that we can talk with him
[33:50] that he's mindful of us
[33:52] that he was wounded before the
[33:54] foundation of the world is that he was
[33:55] slain
[33:56] for everything that would come our way
[33:58] so
[34:00] do you feel you can come up or do you
[34:01] want us to go back back there
[34:05] if you feel it'll be okay to walk up
[34:08] prince if you'll come up with her
[34:09] we're going to anoint her with oil she
[34:11] asked
[34:12] [Music]
[34:14] my the oil's not up here
[34:21] here it is
[34:22] [Music]

[38:58] they have the plans for him and sister
[39:00] rachel to be here this coming weekend
[39:02] following weekend and be here for both
[39:05] services and
[39:06] i understand that brother matt would
[39:08] like to share his heart also with us
[39:10] as as we've talked about how we're going
[39:13] to proceed over the next few months
[39:15] whether we're going to extend the time
[39:16] or things so
[39:18] we'll want to get that resolved as quick
[39:20] as possible because
[39:23] i don't know how much longer or
[39:25] anybody's saying let's take another year
[39:26] or two waiting on this i don't believe
[39:28] that's
[39:28] anybody's heart but we also want to do
[39:31] what god wants us to do
[39:33] okay that's that's priority that's first
[39:36] lord is this your will
[39:38] and if it's not then lord you show us
[39:40] which way we're to go
[39:42] and give us the heart to do it that way
[39:44] you know and
[39:45] brother branham said it that way he says
[39:47] you feel something to do
[39:48] he said start walking in that direction
[39:51] and see if that's what god wants you to
[39:52] do
[39:54] and and god i don't believe wants us
[39:56] sitting on a rocking chair
[39:58] just waiting for him to come and tap us
[39:59] on the shoulder and say okay get up and
[40:01] go.
[40:02] there are things we can be doing we can
[40:03] be praying we can be seeking god's
[40:06] god's favor we can be telling others of
[40:08] the grace of god and
[40:10] plenty to keep yourself busy with while
[40:12] god moves so
[40:13] you keep praying about that and see how
[40:15] the lord would would uh
[40:17] would answer that for us so um don't
[40:19] have any more details than that so i'm
[40:21] not going to say anymore and then
[40:22] give out the wrong information but so
[40:25] let's just trust in the lord
[40:28] he's kept us this far he said he would
[40:30] never leave us
[40:31] he would not forsake us and he keeps his
[40:34] word
[40:35] so let's believe that together so as
[40:37] brother matt
[40:39] continues with his service here save
[40:52] me and i will be saved
[41:02] heal me

[50:08] god bless you to say welcome to friends
[50:11] house of the lord this morning
[50:13] and i appreciate uh this matthew there
[50:16] and musicians
[50:17] i'm excited to be here this morning and
[50:20] then we have um
[50:21] very thrilled to introduce to you
[50:24] an associate minister here in buford
[50:26] brother jason to mars
[50:28] and the lord put it upon my heart just
[50:29] to ask him to speak last week
[50:31] amen and so he's going to be carrying
[50:33] the service over
[50:35] uh today we trust that everything comes
[50:37] through as always we're
[50:39] we're depending on the lord and in
[50:41] between that is technology so we've had
[50:43] just a little bit of trouble this
[50:44] morning
[50:45] getting things set up on our end and
[50:47] getting things set up with brother
[50:48] jason's
[50:49] computer here but i think everything is
[50:51] well
[50:52] i think the video and audio from the
[50:54] test that we had is coming through good
[50:57] amen so uh so just trust that that
[50:59] continues
[51:00] uh brother jason is going to be speaking
[51:02] for us today whatever the lord has put
[51:03] upon his heart
[51:04] trust that you came with an expectation
[51:07] amen and that you have an expectation
[51:09] not to hear from a man
[51:11] who you maybe have never heard before uh
[51:13] although brother jason's very well known
[51:15] he's a uh he's a worldwide minister uh
[51:18] missionary
[51:19] uh to the middle east and so uh but
[51:21] don't look to a man don't look to uh
[51:24] a talent or the ability to articulate
[51:28] but
[51:28] uh have an expectation that the lord
[51:30] jesus is gonna meet your need and that
[51:32] whatever you have need of
[51:34] brother branham said he's the he's the
[51:36] chief shepherd
[51:37] and uh he feeds his sheep he feeds us
[51:39] and so it doesn't matter who's speaking
[51:41] it doesn't matter
[51:43] as long as your expectation is right i
[51:45] believe the lord has something for you
[51:47] today

[56:03] and
[56:03] and actions and different things that he
[56:06] uh
[56:07] spoke to us as a family

[56:14] south carolina here and uh
[56:17] we've been we've been blessed and very
[56:19] thankful for what the lord has
[56:21] is doing in our lives here of course we

[56:24] our family greatly back in minnesota but
[56:27] we
[56:27] you know we take comfort knowing that it
[56:29] was the lord that led us
[56:31] down here my
[56:35] my parents are still in minnesota
[56:37] they're older
[56:38] but my dad was excited to hear that i
[56:42] would be preaching from
[56:43] beaufort to a church in tucson arizona
[56:47] he's uh he loves anything that's western
[56:51] and so just to hear that i was going to
[56:53] preach for a church in tucson he became
[56:56] really really excited so i'm excited as
[56:59] well
[56:59] just really thankful for this
[57:01] opportunity um
[57:04] with that said i want to go to the word
[57:07] i want to speak on the subject knowing
[57:11] god
[57:13] if you want to stand as we open in the
[57:16] word to isaiah
[57:18] chapter 6 i want to look go through the
[57:21] scriptures and look at the attributes
[57:24] of god uh this isn't so much dealing
[57:27] with the
[57:28] elect as his thoughts and a part of his
[57:31] life
[57:31] and thus his attributes and neither is
[57:33] it really looking at the doctrine of the
[57:35] godhead
[57:37] uh but we're we'll explain more what we
[57:40] mean
[57:40] by the attributes of god but before we
[57:43] do that i'm going to look at
[57:44] isaiah chapter six and we'll read one
[57:47] through seven
[57:50] in the year that king uzziah died
[57:53] i saw the lord sitting upon a throne
[57:55] high and lifted up
[57:57] and the train of his robe filled the
[57:59] temple
[58:00] above him stood the seraphim each had
[58:03] six wings
[58:04] with two he covered his face and with
[58:06] two he covered his feet
[58:08] and with two he flew and one
[58:11] called to another and said holy holy
[58:13] holy is the lord of hosts
[58:16] the whole earth is full of his glory
[58:19] and the foundations of the threshold
[58:21] shook at the voice of him
[58:22] who called and the house was filled with
[58:25] smoke and i said woe is me for i am lost
[58:29] for i am a man of unclean lips and i
[58:31] dwell in the midst of a people of
[58:32] unclean lips
[58:33] for my eyes have seen the king the lord
[58:36] of hosts
[58:37] then one of the seraphim flew to me
[58:39] having his hand
[58:40] in his hand a burning coal that he had
[58:42] taken with tongs from the altar
[58:44] and he touched my mouth and said behold
[58:46] this has touched your lips your guilt
[58:49] is taken away and your sin atoned for
[58:53] let's pray heavenly father we just come
[58:56] to you now in the name of the lord jesus
[58:58] we ask that your spirit would come and
[59:01] enliven this word in our hearts lord
[59:04] take it
[59:05] and make it so real to us lord may be a
[59:08] a revelation deep within our soul we
[59:12] know that
[59:12] knowing you it's not by human
[59:15] understanding
[59:16] human reason but it's by personal
[59:19] revelation to the individual
[59:22] and so would you come to each one as an
[59:24] individual lord
[59:26] and reveal yourself a little bit more to
[59:28] them
[59:29] we ask these things in the name of jesus
[59:31] christ amen
[59:34] god bless you you can be seated
[59:42] looking at this verse when i originally
[59:45] studied this about a month ago
[59:49] uh it it so impacted me
[59:53] uh the the morning before i i preached
[59:56] for the first time i woke up and
[59:58] uh it was almost that there was a
[1:00:00] trembling
[1:00:02] within my heart i felt such a
[1:00:06] such a a heaviness just to be
[1:00:09] just to come and and speak on such a
[1:00:12] subject as
[1:00:13] the attributes of god is so um
[1:00:18] it just it feels so huge it's so great
[1:00:21] god is so great god is so powerful that
[1:00:24] who am i
[1:00:25] to come and speak of such great things
[1:00:30] and i think that's the thing that i love
[1:00:33] to speak about the most
[1:00:34] is the greatness of god i love to speak
[1:00:38] about who he is i love
[1:00:40] to make him the center of everything
[1:00:44] when you look at this verse king uzziah
[1:00:47] died and he was a great figure in the
[1:00:50] day
[1:00:51] of isaiah and it's interesting to see
[1:00:54] that this word that
[1:00:57] is used i saw the lord it doesn't say
[1:01:00] i saw capital l capital o capital r
[1:01:04] capital d i saw
[1:01:05] jehovah or yahweh i saw the lord it
[1:01:08] speaks of the sovereign
[1:01:10] one the the king i
[1:01:13] so in the year that king uzziah died i
[1:01:16] saw the lord
[1:01:17] sitting on a throne god didn't
[1:01:20] lose his throne when you king uzziah
[1:01:24] died we hear we have kings and they die
[1:01:27] or presidents and they are voted out and
[1:01:29] it goes to another
[1:01:31] one but god
[1:01:35] is the one that is the sovereign over
[1:01:37] everything
[1:01:38] king uzziah was an important figure he
[1:01:40] did much to restore
[1:01:42] worship he did much to
[1:01:45] make judah a more powerful kingdom and
[1:01:49] it was because of his
[1:01:50] trust in the lord but when he trusts
[1:01:52] when he
[1:01:53] when he became great
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:57] he took his trust away from the lord and
[1:01:59] put his trust
[1:02:00] in his position and in his riches and
[1:02:03] his success and that's when he went into
[1:02:06] the temple
[1:02:08] and it was against god's law
[1:02:11] and he went into the temple and he
[1:02:13] offered incense and he was immediately
[1:02:14] struck
[1:02:16] with leprosy and he had to live in a
[1:02:18] separate room and rule his kingdom
[1:02:21] from a private room the rest of his life
[1:02:24] and so king uzziah died in that year
[1:02:27] they would have had a year
[1:02:29] of mourning they would have a year of
[1:02:32] sorrow
[1:02:32] even isaiah isaiah was connected to the
[1:02:36] royal family he was an
[1:02:37] important a person in society he wasn't
[1:02:43] he was he was not a lower class person
[1:02:46] he was
[1:02:47] he was in the upper class he was a
[1:02:50] he was a part of the aristocracy you
[1:02:53] would
[1:02:53] you would say connected with the royal
[1:02:56] family
[1:02:57] and and him as a prophet even he would
[1:03:01] have been in a place of
[1:03:02] mourning over the death of king uzziah
[1:03:06] but then god opened the scene to his
[1:03:08] prophet to see the true
[1:03:10] reality in the temple
[1:03:13] there's god seated upon his throne
[1:03:18] and he's so great so powerful just
[1:03:22] the train of his robe filled
[1:03:26] completely filled the temple and it
[1:03:28] speaks of the seraphim
[1:03:30] standing above him this
[1:03:35] sovereign god
[1:03:38] surrounded by angels these angels have
[1:03:41] never been
[1:03:42] in the presence of sin these angels have
[1:03:45] never sinned
[1:03:47] they themselves are are holy separated
[1:03:50] unto god
[1:03:50] there in his presence and god is
[1:03:54] so much more holy these angels have to
[1:03:57] have six wings
[1:03:58] two to cover their face two to cover
[1:04:02] their feet and with two they fly they're
[1:04:05] in the presence of god this is how great
[1:04:09] how mighty this god
[1:04:10] and they cry holy holy
[1:04:14] holy it's not speaking of a trinity
[1:04:17] of persons what is it what is it
[1:04:20] speaking of
[1:04:21] when in in the hebrew they will use that
[1:04:25] as jesus said
[1:04:26] verily verily or in aramaic he would
[1:04:28] have said
[1:04:29] amen amen i say unto you
[1:04:33] it wasn't a mistake of speech it was
[1:04:36] saying this is this is a point that's
[1:04:39] emphasized
[1:04:40] i'm saying this is complete this is a
[1:04:44] this is complete truth that i'm speaking
[1:04:47] unto you
[1:04:48] and here the angels are saying not only
[1:04:51] is it
[1:04:52] completely holy god is infinitely
[1:04:56] holy and in fact he's so great he's so
[1:04:59] powerful
[1:05:00] the whole earth is
[1:05:04] full of his glory the the earth
[1:05:07] itself cannot even contain his glory
[1:05:11] and when he begins to speak uh
[1:05:14] the foundations there's an earthquake
[1:05:18] the earth tr itself trembles and this is
[1:05:22] isaiah's response to this vision
[1:05:25] this isaiah was a prophet
[1:05:28] he was set apart to the lord he was the
[1:05:31] holiest
[1:05:32] man in israel he was the godliest man in
[1:05:36] israel
[1:05:38] this is his response in coming into the
[1:05:41] presence of the lord
[1:05:43] woe is me for i am
[1:05:46] undone this this word
[1:05:50] woe is me um
[1:05:53] in in yiddish that is actually
[1:05:57] and so we've heard that statement before
[1:06:02] sometimes said jokingly but that's what
[1:06:05] it means is
[1:06:06] woe is me it's a statement of extreme
[1:06:11] emotion a statement of extreme
[1:06:15] pain extreme
[1:06:18] devastation woe is me
[1:06:22] and then he follows that up with worth
[1:06:24] for i
[1:06:25] am undone have you ever heard the
[1:06:27] statement
[1:06:29] this person he has it all together
[1:06:33] so this is the opposite of that isaiah
[1:06:36] is saying i
[1:06:37] have completely fallen apart
[1:06:41] woe is me i am i'm in pieces
[1:06:44] my emotional being my spiritual being
[1:06:49] my whole existence is now
[1:06:52] crumbled to pieces
[1:06:56] i'm undone i'm broken
[1:06:59] that is the response
[1:07:02] of the holy prophet of god when he
[1:07:06] comes and sees god in his glory
[1:07:09] sitting there upon the throne i'm
[1:07:12] finished and he makes this confession
[1:07:15] the godliest man in israel says
[1:07:18] i'm a man i have a dirty mouth
[1:07:22] my mouth is filthy and by extension my
[1:07:25] life
[1:07:26] is filthy because out of the abundance
[1:07:29] of the heart the mouth speaks
[1:07:32] and that creates the life that's the
[1:07:35] life that
[1:07:36] you live and and and
[1:07:39] he's saying i'm unclean i'm dirty i
[1:07:42] am filthy when it comes to being in the
[1:07:46] presence of god this is the greatness
[1:07:48] of the holiness of god it speaks of
[1:07:51] transcendent
[1:07:54] holiness this isn't just what god has
[1:07:56] set apart
[1:07:57] when we're talking about god being three
[1:08:00] times holy
[1:08:01] we're saying his holiness is
[1:08:04] transcendent it's far above
[1:08:08] any holiness that you and i have created
[1:08:12] in our life
[1:08:12] by god god alone is holy
[1:08:17] god alone is transcendently holy he's so
[1:08:21] far above and beyond different
[1:08:24] than you and i
[1:08:29] why is again why is isaiah come to this
[1:08:32] place
[1:08:33] he says because my eyes have seen the
[1:08:35] king the lord of hosts
[1:08:38] a true revelation of who god is would
[1:08:42] produce
[1:08:43] this kind of understanding about
[1:08:46] yourself
[1:08:48] how can we ever experience
[1:08:52] true salvation in christ until we've
[1:08:54] experienced
[1:08:55] this that we come to the presence of god
[1:08:58] and say i am broken
[1:09:00] i am dead i have
[1:09:03] nothing to offer you lord i'm completely
[1:09:06] sinful
[1:09:08] and isn't it beautiful that god doesn't
[1:09:10] say yeah you're right isaiah
[1:09:13] you're right and there's no hope for you
[1:09:18] no immediately the seraphim
[1:09:22] knows what to do he goes
[1:09:26] takes that burning coal what
[1:09:29] what if think of that for yourself
[1:09:33] taking a burning coal put that coal
[1:09:36] burning coal
[1:09:37] upon your lips what a pain
[1:09:41] that would be what a painful purging
[1:09:44] that speaks of though i don't believe it
[1:09:46] was something that was truly painful for
[1:09:48] isaiah
[1:09:49] the picture is there what a painful
[1:09:53] purging that took place but the answer
[1:09:57] back was
[1:09:58] this has touched your lips your guilt is
[1:10:01] taken away
[1:10:02] and your sin is atoned for god is
[1:10:05] acknowledging of course
[1:10:06] you're right isaiah that is true what
[1:10:08] you said
[1:10:09] is the truth but i have a solution
[1:10:13] for your problem that's the grace of god
[1:10:17] that's the beauty of god but we don't
[1:10:19] really come to that place
[1:10:22] of seeing the salvation of the lord
[1:10:25] until we can come to the place where you
[1:10:27] say
[1:10:28] woe is me i'm undone i'm a man of
[1:10:30] unclean lips and i dwell amongst
[1:10:33] people of unclean lips jeremiah 9
[1:10:37] 23 24
[1:10:40] jeremiah says thus saith the lord let
[1:10:41] not the wise man glory in his wisdom
[1:10:44] neither let the mighty man glory in his
[1:10:46] might
[1:10:47] let not the rich man glory in his riches
[1:10:50] but let him that glorieth
[1:10:52] glory in this that he understandeth
[1:10:56] and knoweth me that i am the lord which
[1:10:59] exercise loving kindness and judgment
[1:11:02] and righteousness in the earth for in
[1:11:03] these things i delight sayeth the lord
[1:11:07] isn't that beautiful if you're gonna
[1:11:09] brag if you're gonna
[1:11:11] if you're gonna glorify something don't
[1:11:14] let it be
[1:11:15] sports your city that you live in your
[1:11:18] past history and life
[1:11:19] that's nothing to glory about the thing
[1:11:22] that we need
[1:11:24] to take our greatest delight in and
[1:11:27] glory in is that we know
[1:11:31] the lord not just in a surface knowledge
[1:11:35] but
[1:11:35] knowing that in these things the
[1:11:39] the he's the lord that exercise loving
[1:11:41] kindness judgment
[1:11:42] and righteousness we know who he is
[1:11:46] because we know his attributes of who he
[1:11:48] is
[1:11:51] and i i feel so strongly
[1:11:55] that it's so critical for us
[1:11:58] you know in our walk with the lord
[1:12:01] to on a frequent basis not just think
[1:12:05] about our troubles and pray
[1:12:08] not just
[1:12:11] focus on the promises
[1:12:15] that affect us that's good there's
[1:12:17] nothing wrong with either of those
[1:12:18] things
[1:12:20] but even greater than that
[1:12:24] we should lift our hearts up and our
[1:12:26] minds up
[1:12:27] to the majestic holiness
[1:12:30] and power and greatness of god he's the
[1:12:34] center of everything he should be our
[1:12:35] focus
[1:12:37] he is our delight he's the main theme of
[1:12:40] absolutely everything the whole theme of
[1:12:43] every chapter and verse in the bible
[1:12:46] is god revealed through
[1:12:49] jesus christ and we have a dangerous
[1:12:54] tendency sometimes to focus
[1:12:57] on man centered religion
[1:13:01] that's the hour that we're living and
[1:13:02] that's laodicea people's rights
[1:13:05] and you look at all the people that are
[1:13:08] prominent not all the people that are
[1:13:10] prominent
[1:13:10] but the main ones that are prominent on
[1:13:12] places like tbn
[1:13:15] uh trinity broadcasting network and
[1:13:17] christian television
[1:13:19] you see the preachers are so focused on
[1:13:23] me me me and you you
[1:13:26] you your life and you doing this and it
[1:13:29] can
[1:13:30] be a danger danger thing that creeps
[1:13:32] into
[1:13:33] us in the message that we're so focused
[1:13:36] on us
[1:13:38] let's get away from man-centered
[1:13:41] religion
[1:13:42] and man-focused preaching
[1:13:45] let's get back to god-centered reality
[1:13:51] you know sometimes we can so focus on
[1:13:54] this is who the bride is this is her
[1:13:57] this is his
[1:13:57] her position this is her place that we
[1:14:01] lift it out of balance instead of having
[1:14:04] our focus and say
[1:14:06] who god this is who god is this is who's
[1:14:08] revealed himself to be
[1:14:10] this is this is who he is for you
[1:14:14] it's great to know who we are but if we
[1:14:16] if we only know about who we are and we
[1:14:18] don't know him
[1:14:19] we haven't known anything yet
[1:14:23] so i want to look at um the attributes
[1:14:26] of god of course
[1:14:27] this is a ever unfolding subject so
[1:14:30] there's no way
[1:14:31] in the next 30 or 40 minutes i'm going
[1:14:34] to be able to
[1:14:35] get to every one of these things and but
[1:14:38] i just want to
[1:14:39] kind of lay a foundation of that and and
[1:14:42] get some basic understanding from
[1:14:46] merriam-webster's online dictionary says
[1:14:48] that the word
[1:14:49] attribute speaks of a quality character
[1:14:52] or characteristic
[1:14:54] ascribed to someone or
[1:14:57] something so that's what i'm looking at
[1:15:01] i'm looking at the characteristics of
[1:15:04] god
[1:15:05] but before we do that i want to look i
[1:15:07] want to just differentiate between
[1:15:09] things that sometimes we blend them
[1:15:11] together
[1:15:12] and i want to just sort of separate
[1:15:15] those out
[1:15:17] to give a better understanding of of
[1:15:19] what we're talking about
[1:15:20] the first one that we look at when
[1:15:24] we talk about the lord
[1:15:27] is we look often at the godhead
[1:15:30] or what you'll call the being of god
[1:15:35] that's the first thing and we're not
[1:15:36] going to be talking about the godhead
[1:15:38] and
[1:15:38] and looking at the relationship between
[1:15:41] the
[1:15:42] father and jesus christ and
[1:15:44] differentiating and looking at the logos
[1:15:46] and all those different things that the
[1:15:48] scripture speaks about
[1:15:50] you know god's oneness we're not gonna
[1:15:52] look at that specifically
[1:15:55] um that's a separate issue from what
[1:15:56] we're talking about the next
[1:15:58] part that we we see here um
[1:16:02] is the nature or essence
[1:16:06] of god and those things are closely
[1:16:09] related to the attributes of god
[1:16:13] and some of those some of that nature or
[1:16:16] essence
[1:16:16] of who god is kind of overlaps
[1:16:20] some of them are are parts of the
[1:16:22] attributes of god
[1:16:24] um so the nature of god
[1:16:28] speaks of the essence of who he
[1:16:31] really is again closely related to his
[1:16:35] attributes but
[1:16:36] they sort of they sort of start at the
[1:16:39] top
[1:16:39] and govern everything else
[1:16:46] in other words the attributes of god
[1:16:48] flow out from his essence
[1:16:50] or nature uh here's the first one is
[1:16:54] love
[1:16:55] we look at his essence or nature first
[1:16:58] john 4
[1:16:59] 16 and we have known and believed the
[1:17:01] love that god has to us
[1:17:04] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[1:17:07] dwelleth in god and god in him
[1:17:10] it's not just that love is one of god's
[1:17:13] attributes
[1:17:14] it's that god is
[1:17:18] love that's who he is
[1:17:21] next one is light first john 1 5
[1:17:24] this then is the message which we have
[1:17:26] heard of him and declare unto you
[1:17:28] that god is light and in him is no
[1:17:32] darkness
[1:17:32] at all that's who he is god is
[1:17:36] light darkness has no impact and effect
[1:17:40] on him
[1:17:41] because he is light that's who he is
[1:17:45] now when we look in scripture i think in
[1:17:48] i think it's in ephesians
[1:17:49] it said whatsoever makes manifest
[1:17:53] is light so if we put that together with
[1:17:57] this scripture that
[1:17:58] god is light we understand at the core
[1:18:00] of who god is
[1:18:01] is he seeks to be manifested
[1:18:05] what good is what good is being light
[1:18:09] unless there's someone to behold that
[1:18:12] light
[1:18:13] so that doesn't mean that god is relying
[1:18:16] upon us
[1:18:17] or that god needs us to fulfill himself
[1:18:21] god is complete in himself
[1:18:24] he doesn't need us we don't add anything
[1:18:28] to god
[1:18:29] he's completing himself but
[1:18:33] that's why we're here that's why this
[1:18:35] creation is here that's why you're
[1:18:37] living the life that you are that's why
[1:18:39] he's called you he's changed he's given
[1:18:41] your spirit
[1:18:42] is because at the very core of his being
[1:18:44] is light which begs the
[1:18:46] with which just leads to the fact that
[1:18:49] he's going to
[1:18:50] unfold himself and reveal himself
[1:18:54] to others who are not him
[1:18:58] but even even within light
[1:19:02] when you think of light it also speaks
[1:19:05] of
[1:19:05] holiness or purity
[1:19:09] or goodness those different attributes
[1:19:11] of god
[1:19:12] flow out from light god is the
[1:19:16] ultimate source of holiness the ultimate
[1:19:19] source of purity the ultimate source of
[1:19:21] goodness
[1:19:22] the ultimate source of justice
[1:19:26] you know his justice and his wrath those
[1:19:28] two things together
[1:19:30] are connected with light
[1:19:35] we are only light as we derive
[1:19:40] light from him we are we only
[1:19:44] possess holiness as he
[1:19:47] takes from himself and gives it to us
[1:19:51] we only possess purity as it comes from
[1:19:54] him he is the source
[1:19:56] of all of it uh hebrews 12 29 says for
[1:20:00] our god is a consuming
[1:20:03] fire that's light
[1:20:06] on one side light produces purity
[1:20:10] on the other side when light is rejected
[1:20:13] a fire
[1:20:14] reaches out and consumes that
[1:20:17] in wrath the third
[1:20:21] uh part of his nature
[1:20:26] is or essence is from john 4
[1:20:29] 24 it says god
[1:20:32] is a spirit if you notice in
[1:20:35] the king james not every version but the
[1:20:38] scofield version you'll see that it's an
[1:20:40] italics there
[1:20:41] that means that the word a is in italics
[1:20:45] that means that the translators have
[1:20:47] added this
[1:20:48] to increase understanding but what it
[1:20:52] really says
[1:20:53] if you look at the english standard
[1:20:54] version it says god
[1:20:56] is spirit
[1:21:00] not god is a spirit there's talk there's
[1:21:02] many many spirits and god is a spirit
[1:21:04] he's one of them
[1:21:05] no god is the source god
[1:21:09] is spirit and when we look at this we
[1:21:12] understand god is not
[1:21:14] limited to one particular body
[1:21:17] he's not limited to one particular
[1:21:21] place let's look at a few scriptures
[1:21:25] jeremiah 23 24 can any hide himself in
[1:21:28] secret places that i shall not
[1:21:31] see him that's speaking of his
[1:21:33] omniscience
[1:21:34] saith the lord but then it goes further
[1:21:37] and says do not i
[1:21:38] fill heaven and earth saith the lord
[1:21:42] brother branham in 1956 the sermon the
[1:21:44] mighty conqueror says the place cannot
[1:21:46] be too humble
[1:21:47] too little he's praying for you to come
[1:21:50] and yet
[1:21:51] you fill all space and time ii
[1:21:55] chronicles 6
[1:21:56] 18 but will god in very deed dwell with
[1:21:59] man on earth
[1:22:00] behold heaven and the heaven of heavens
[1:22:03] cannot contain thee how much less this
[1:22:05] house
[1:22:06] which i have built
[1:22:11] first timothy 1 17 now
[1:22:14] unto the king eternal immortal invisible
[1:22:18] the only wise god be honor and glory
[1:22:20] forever
[1:22:22] and ever part of being spirit means
[1:22:25] god is invisible he
[1:22:28] cannot be seen the scripture says and
[1:22:31] yet we understand
[1:22:32] he unfolds him he unfolded himself into
[1:22:36] the logos and that became the very body
[1:22:40] the theophany of jehovah god so that
[1:22:43] he could relate to his creation and his
[1:22:45] creation
[1:22:46] could relate to him and we see him as he
[1:22:49] manifests himself
[1:22:50] but god in himself no man has seen god
[1:22:55] at any time paul says this
[1:22:59] acts 17 28 for in him
[1:23:03] that we live and move and have our being
[1:23:06] as certain also of your own poets have
[1:23:08] said
[1:23:10] for we are also his offspring
[1:23:13] so god is a spirit as the prophet said
[1:23:16] he covers all space and time
[1:23:18] the heaven and the heavens cannot
[1:23:20] contain him
[1:23:21] and and as jeremiah says he fills all
[1:23:25] heaven and earth so these are this is
[1:23:28] the essence of god
[1:23:30] from which flows all of his attributes
[1:23:33] god is spirit
[1:23:34] god is light god is love
[1:23:39] let's take a few minutes to re reflect
[1:23:41] on
[1:23:43] the awesome the words
[1:23:46] are so feeble in describing who god is
[1:23:50] but let's look at his awesome grandeur
[1:23:54] his majestic glory
[1:23:56] and this worship provoking splendor of
[1:23:59] god
[1:24:00] i believe it will do us a great deal of
[1:24:02] good
[1:24:03] to meditate upon these things not just
[1:24:06] today but literally on a daily basis if
[1:24:10] we
[1:24:10] really think and contemplate who
[1:24:14] god really is it will have a great
[1:24:18] enormous impact on our everyday life and
[1:24:21] how we walk
[1:24:22] in this evil world
[1:24:26] again it's in knowing him
[1:24:30] personally by revelation
[1:24:34] that we receive life and that life is
[1:24:37] displayed through us that we receive
[1:24:40] strength
[1:24:41] to endure everything that we pass
[1:24:44] through in this life
[1:24:45] it brings the to know him in truth
[1:24:48] brings the comfort necessary on the
[1:24:50] journey
[1:24:51] and let me just say this when we
[1:24:55] people will make these statements my god
[1:24:58] would never do such and such
[1:25:03] the bible says to not have any other
[1:25:05] gods before him
[1:25:06] the true and living god we have no
[1:25:09] right to define who god is
[1:25:12] based on the whims of a 21st century
[1:25:16] mind
[1:25:18] my god would never do that your god
[1:25:20] might not do that
[1:25:21] but the true living god is defined
[1:25:25] by this book he's not defined
[1:25:30] by joel osteen he's not defined
[1:25:34] by benny hinn the god that
[1:25:38] is preached over the charismatic pulpit
[1:25:41] very often is not the true
[1:25:45] and living god but is a creation of men
[1:25:48] and is a violation of the first
[1:25:50] commandment
[1:25:52] which says to not have any other gods
[1:25:53] before him
[1:25:55] who he who is he he says i am that i
[1:25:58] am amen
[1:26:02] god is who he says he is god is not who
[1:26:05] you say he is
[1:26:06] god does not care what you think
[1:26:10] about who he is it has no impact about
[1:26:12] who he is
[1:26:14] all you need to do is say i i believe
[1:26:17] and trust
[1:26:18] in the god that reveals himself by
[1:26:22] his word that is absolute
[1:26:26] so here's a starting list of the
[1:26:28] attributes of god
[1:26:31] the self first one is the self existence
[1:26:34] or i would say the
[1:26:35] aloneness or uniqueness of god
[1:26:39] to the councils of god three the
[1:26:41] knowledge of god
[1:26:43] for the supremacy of god five the
[1:26:46] sovereignty of god
[1:26:48] six the holiness of god seven the glory
[1:26:52] of god
[1:26:52] eight the power of god nine the
[1:26:56] faithfulness of god
[1:26:58] ten the love of god eleven the mercy of
[1:27:01] god
[1:27:02] twelve the grace of god 13
[1:27:05] the wrath of god 14 the goodness of god
[1:27:09] and 15 i i put as the eternal
[1:27:13] revealing of god so
[1:27:16] right there shows that i'll never be
[1:27:18] able to cover everything
[1:27:20] in one sermon or a thousand
[1:27:23] sermons because we will spend all of
[1:27:27] eternity
[1:27:28] getting to know god
[1:27:32] more and more and the revealing will
[1:27:34] never
[1:27:35] ever stop the first one i start with
[1:27:40] is the aloneness of god
[1:27:43] genesis 1 1 starts this way
[1:27:47] in the beginning god
[1:27:51] god was alone he was by himself there
[1:27:55] was no
[1:27:56] no one there with him in fact the
[1:27:59] english word god means an object of
[1:28:01] worship
[1:28:01] he wasn't even god then because there
[1:28:04] was no one there
[1:28:05] to worship him before before he created
[1:28:10] the word there in the hebrew
[1:28:13] that's used for god isn't like the
[1:28:16] english word it's a little different
[1:28:18] it's the word elohim many people have
[1:28:21] believed that this means a plural
[1:28:24] form of god which it definitely can but
[1:28:28] i want to look more specifically and if
[1:28:30] we break down these two work
[1:28:32] two words that are connected in one the
[1:28:35] word el
[1:28:36] means strong one
[1:28:39] and the word in hebrew ohim
[1:28:42] means to swear or bind by an oath
[1:28:46] so in the in the very beginning of
[1:28:50] creation
[1:28:51] we see that god is the strong one bound
[1:28:55] by an oath
[1:28:56] the first one that appears in the bible
[1:28:59] is the one who's already bound himself
[1:29:03] by his word
[1:29:08] he's already bound by his own word
[1:29:13] so not only did god dwell alone before
[1:29:16] time but
[1:29:17] god is alone in excellency
[1:29:21] exodus 15 verse 11 says who is like unto
[1:29:23] thee o lord among the gods
[1:29:25] who is like thee glorious in holiness
[1:29:29] fearful in praises doing
[1:29:32] wonders who's like god there's no one
[1:29:35] like god
[1:29:36] there's no one that can be a parrot
[1:29:38] compared to him he alone he is alone in
[1:29:41] excellency
[1:29:42] romans 11 34 through 36
[1:29:46] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[1:29:49] or who hath been his counselor
[1:29:51] or who has first given to him and it
[1:29:53] shall be recompensed unto him again
[1:29:56] for of him and through him and to him
[1:29:58] are all things
[1:30:00] to whom be glory forever amen
[1:30:04] god is not in need of anything that we
[1:30:07] can give
[1:30:08] everything belongs to him everything
[1:30:11] that we have belongs to him
[1:30:13] all that we are belongs to him the bible
[1:30:16] says
[1:30:16] does not the speaking of mankind does
[1:30:19] not the potter
[1:30:21] have power over the clay to do as he
[1:30:24] wishes
[1:30:25] that is the potter is god our father
[1:30:29] he has the right to do whatever he wants
[1:30:32] to do with us god is self-sufficient
[1:30:37] there's no other being in all of
[1:30:41] the universe that is self-sufficient
[1:30:45] we all derive our life and
[1:30:48] everything from him he derives nothing
[1:30:52] from
[1:30:52] from us there's no word of blasphemy
[1:30:56] that could take away from god
[1:30:59] it could never take away from who he is
[1:31:02] in his character and in his central
[1:31:03] being
[1:31:04] and there's no amount of faith that we
[1:31:07] can put in him
[1:31:08] that would add to his
[1:31:11] essential being that would add to him
[1:31:15] yes god is glorified and dishonored by
[1:31:18] us
[1:31:19] but that takes away nothing nor adds
[1:31:22] anything to him to glorify him is to
[1:31:26] merely
[1:31:27] recognize a reality
[1:31:30] of who he is and to blaspheme him is to
[1:31:34] simply fall
[1:31:35] upon an impenetrable rock that can only
[1:31:39] crush you you cannot crush it the worst
[1:31:44] blasphemy blasphemers and atheists
[1:31:49] that have spoken the most vile things in
[1:31:52] all of history
[1:31:54] take nothing away from the majesty
[1:31:58] the splendor the excellency of god
[1:32:03] isaiah 40 21
[1:32:07] through 23 have you not known have you
[1:32:10] not heard hath it not been told to you
[1:32:11] from the beginning
[1:32:13] have you not understood from the
[1:32:14] foundation of the earth
[1:32:16] it is he that sitteth upon the circle of
[1:32:19] the earth
[1:32:20] and the inhabitants thereof are as
[1:32:22] grasshoppers that stretcheth out the
[1:32:24] heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them
[1:32:26] out
[1:32:26] as a tent to dwell in that brings the
[1:32:28] princes to nothing he makes the judges
[1:32:30] of the earth
[1:32:32] as vanity god is so
[1:32:35] far above us as he looks upon us
[1:32:40] he sees us and he says you're like
[1:32:41] grasshoppers
[1:32:44] the the the sky is like just a mere
[1:32:48] curtain that we would pull
[1:32:50] over a window and he says
[1:32:54] the earth is like a chair for him he
[1:32:56] sits upon the circle of the earth
[1:32:59] um isaiah 66 says heaven is my throne
[1:33:03] earth is my footstool the
[1:33:06] the vastness of earth when we look at it
[1:33:09] i mean just start walking and try to
[1:33:11] walk and swim around the whole earth
[1:33:13] you'll find go on a go on top of a
[1:33:16] mountain
[1:33:17] 14 000 foot mountain in colorado and
[1:33:19] look down
[1:33:20] and look at yourself or stand
[1:33:24] stand at the last spot and look up
[1:33:26] towards the people
[1:33:28] that have reached the summit and see
[1:33:31] just how
[1:33:32] miniscule they are compared
[1:33:35] to that just that mountain let alone
[1:33:38] earth
[1:33:40] and god says the earth is literally a
[1:33:42] footstool i mean think about a footstool
[1:33:45] that you have in your home maybe it's
[1:33:48] like
[1:33:49] this big and you just rest your feet on
[1:33:52] it
[1:33:52] and it's a small an insignificant thing
[1:33:55] in your home
[1:33:56] and yet to god that's what the earth is
[1:33:59] it's so
[1:34:00] minuscule compared to his the greatness
[1:34:05] and majesty of his being
[1:34:09] we esteem the the earth as great and
[1:34:12] majestic and it truly is it truly is
[1:34:16] the the majesty of the earth is an
[1:34:18] expression of the one that created
[1:34:21] created it and yet it's nothing compared
[1:34:24] to who he
[1:34:24] really is he just uses things like a
[1:34:28] rock and
[1:34:29] different things to express
[1:34:32] who he is and yet even that doesn't
[1:34:35] truly
[1:34:36] grab a hold of the greatness of who he
[1:34:40] is
[1:34:40] and he says i bring the princes to
[1:34:42] nothing and make the judges of the earth
[1:34:44] is vanity
[1:34:46] every president every king every prime
[1:34:49] minister
[1:34:50] everyone everyone in power on this earth
[1:34:54] are as nothing god only has to
[1:34:58] say this one's dead i'm relieving the
[1:35:01] life from him
[1:35:02] and he's gone but god has a purpose
[1:35:06] he is sovereign and he is working and
[1:35:08] those who are in power
[1:35:10] are there for a reason and god is
[1:35:13] working
[1:35:13] something towards his plan to accomplish
[1:35:16] his purpose on the earth exodus
[1:35:20] 8 verse 10 says and he said tomorrow and
[1:35:22] he said be it according to thy word that
[1:35:24] thou mayest know
[1:35:26] that there is none like unto the lord
[1:35:29] our god there's no one like him
[1:35:33] no one can even approach to be who is
[1:35:36] yet we are made in his image
[1:35:39] yet he says the inhabitants of the earth
[1:35:41] are as grasshoppers
[1:35:43] we're made in his image what a
[1:35:46] glorious thing that he tells us and
[1:35:49] reveals us to in his word
[1:35:50] that image was lost in the garden of
[1:35:53] eden
[1:35:54] but that image is being restored through
[1:35:56] jesus christ and will ultimately be
[1:35:58] restored when he gives us a new body
[1:36:05] the councils of god
[1:36:08] acts 15 verse 18 known unto god are all
[1:36:12] his works
[1:36:13] from the beginning of the world
[1:36:18] god made a plan
[1:36:21] made a purpose and that plan and that
[1:36:24] purpose was made
[1:36:25] before creation ever came to be
[1:36:34] ephesians 3 11 according to the eternal
[1:36:36] purpose which he purposed in
[1:36:38] christ jesus our lord
[1:36:42] not only did god purpose and plan
[1:36:46] and counsel before the foundation of the
[1:36:48] world
[1:36:50] he did it for his plan was fixed for
[1:36:53] all eternity acts 2
[1:36:56] 23 him being delivered by the
[1:36:59] determinate counsel and foreknowledge of
[1:37:01] god you have taken
[1:37:02] and by wicked hands have crucified and
[1:37:05] slain
[1:37:06] ephesians 1 11 in whom also we have
[1:37:09] obtained an inheritance being
[1:37:11] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:37:12] of him who worketh all things
[1:37:15] after the council of his own
[1:37:18] will verse 9 and ephesians 1 as well
[1:37:22] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:37:24] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:37:26] which he purposed in himself as we read
[1:37:29] these verses
[1:37:30] we see that god's purpose is eternal it
[1:37:33] has no
[1:37:33] beginning and no ending it changes not
[1:37:36] god's counsel his decree
[1:37:40] is predetermined and god
[1:37:44] works everything after the council of
[1:37:46] his own
[1:37:47] will god does nothing nothing by whimsy
[1:37:52] god does nothing unplanned
[1:37:55] he's not reacting and responding to what
[1:37:57] satan is doing
[1:37:58] satan is reacting and responding to what
[1:38:01] god is doing
[1:38:03] he's trying to thwart god's plan and all
[1:38:05] the while
[1:38:06] he's fulfilling exactly what god
[1:38:09] wants him to do he wanted satan wanted
[1:38:12] to kill
[1:38:13] jesus christ what was that
[1:38:17] god by his predetermined counsel
[1:38:21] determined that by wicked hands christ
[1:38:23] would be slain
[1:38:29] god purposed everything according to his
[1:38:31] what pleased him
[1:38:33] what he desired to do that he did
[1:38:37] god's will is free and his purposes
[1:38:40] cannot be thwarted
[1:38:42] or changed by someone else's will in
[1:38:45] other words
[1:38:46] if if i decide i want to do something
[1:38:49] different
[1:38:50] i'm not actually changing anything god
[1:38:54] has already
[1:38:54] predetermined what is what would have
[1:38:57] happened
[1:38:58] isaiah 40 13 and 14 who has rejected
[1:39:02] directed the spirit of the lord or being
[1:39:04] his counselor has taught him
[1:39:07] with whom took he counsel and who
[1:39:09] instructed him and taught him in the
[1:39:10] path of judgment
[1:39:12] and taught him knowledge and showed him
[1:39:13] the way of understanding it begs the
[1:39:15] answer
[1:39:15] no one has god is the original
[1:39:20] god is the source of all knowledge of
[1:39:23] all understanding
[1:39:24] he is the one who's planning god has
[1:39:28] free will let's look at this
[1:39:32] in the smirnion church age brother
[1:39:33] branham says
[1:39:35] this the eternal thoughts of god let me
[1:39:38] ask you
[1:39:39] are the thoughts of god eternal if you
[1:39:41] can see this you'll see many things
[1:39:44] god is unchangeable in both essence
[1:39:48] and behavior we've studied that and
[1:39:50] proven that already god is infinite in
[1:39:52] his abilities
[1:39:54] so therefore he is god must be
[1:39:55] omniscient
[1:39:57] if he is omniscient then he is not now
[1:39:59] learning
[1:40:01] nor is he taking counsel even with
[1:40:03] himself nor is he at any time adding to
[1:40:05] his knowledge
[1:40:07] if he can add to his knowledge then he's
[1:40:08] not
[1:40:10] omniscient the best we could say is that
[1:40:13] sometime he will be but that's not
[1:40:14] scriptural
[1:40:16] he is omniscient he's never had a new
[1:40:19] thought about
[1:40:20] anything because all his thoughts he has
[1:40:23] always had and always will have
[1:40:25] and knows the end from the beginning
[1:40:27] because he is god
[1:40:29] thus the thoughts of god are eternal
[1:40:32] they're real
[1:40:32] they're not simply like a man with a
[1:40:34] blueprint he has drawn up
[1:40:36] which one day will be translated into
[1:40:37] some sense and form but they are already
[1:40:40] real and eternal and part of god god's
[1:40:42] counsels are absolute
[1:40:45] and unconditional
[1:40:48] unconditional isaiah 46 10 says
[1:40:51] declaring the end from the beginning and
[1:40:52] from ancient times the things that are
[1:40:54] not yet done
[1:40:54] saying my counsel shall stand and i will
[1:40:58] do
[1:40:58] all my pleasure
[1:41:01] god is not subject to the will of man
[1:41:04] god not
[1:41:04] subject to the will of angels or devils
[1:41:08] he's not subject to nature all things
[1:41:11] are subject to him
[1:41:13] his counsel will stand he will do all
[1:41:15] his good pleasure
[1:41:16] no one will thwart it or stop it
[1:41:20] [Music]
[1:41:21] god's purpose is immutable and
[1:41:24] invincible
[1:41:25] immutable means incapable of change
[1:41:29] invincible means they can't be conquered
[1:41:32] or
[1:41:33] overcome i'm going to
[1:41:37] just depart from my notes for a second
[1:41:40] because often this creates several
[1:41:41] questions
[1:41:43] and when we look at this does man have
[1:41:46] free will yes of course man has free
[1:41:50] will
[1:41:52] but god is the ultimate
[1:41:55] source of free will god has free will
[1:42:00] you and i we make choices
[1:42:03] you chose to come to church today you
[1:42:06] you
[1:42:06] you chose to wear the clothes you did
[1:42:09] god
[1:42:10] was not forcing you to do that but god
[1:42:13] knew
[1:42:13] that you would do it and he planned that
[1:42:15] you would do it
[1:42:17] and those two things are not
[1:42:19] contradictory
[1:42:21] you should we we
[1:42:26] choose what we choose no one
[1:42:29] no one is thwarting us or stopping us of
[1:42:32] course we have many conditions around us
[1:42:35] we have many experiences in life that
[1:42:38] that
[1:42:38] cause us to choose a certain way we have
[1:42:41] a nature
[1:42:42] that's founded in our dna that
[1:42:46] that governs many of the choices that we
[1:42:49] make
[1:42:50] and yet we do make free
[1:42:53] free choices and yet god is not
[1:42:56] limited by our free choices i want to
[1:42:58] just give a
[1:42:59] kind of a word picture of things when we
[1:43:02] see
[1:43:02] what happens through history we see it
[1:43:05] on a timeline
[1:43:06] yeah you know in six thousand
[1:43:10] six thousand years ago the world was
[1:43:12] created and five thousand years ago this
[1:43:15] happened and
[1:43:16] on down the line we see all the history
[1:43:18] and all the details of things that took
[1:43:20] place
[1:43:20] that's how we see the past this way we
[1:43:23] see the future this way
[1:43:25] and we think of it in a linear way god
[1:43:28] is not in time god is out completely
[1:43:31] outside of time
[1:43:33] god sits above and out of time
[1:43:37] so that when he looks down he doesn't
[1:43:39] see this timeline the way we do
[1:43:41] he sees the past the present and the
[1:43:44] future
[1:43:45] all the same i know
[1:43:48] it's hard for any human mind to
[1:43:51] comprehend
[1:43:52] the past is never never the past with
[1:43:55] god
[1:43:55] the present is always it's always
[1:43:58] present
[1:43:59] and the future is not the future with
[1:44:01] god
[1:44:02] it's all the same because he's
[1:44:03] completely outside of that
[1:44:06] now we come down to this and the the
[1:44:09] thing that will be said is
[1:44:11] well god uh if god predetermines
[1:44:14] everything that's going to happen then
[1:44:17] what is the use of me
[1:44:19] praying the very same god that
[1:44:23] decreed that a certain event would take
[1:44:26] place
[1:44:27] in this timeline
[1:44:30] also decreed that it could not happen
[1:44:33] unless someone were to pray
[1:44:38] you know it's easy to speak of that
[1:44:40] regarding healing
[1:44:42] but you know talk about the salvation of
[1:44:45] people in a far away nation it took
[1:44:49] prayer how do we know what to pray for
[1:44:52] the bible says this
[1:44:53] the spirit we don't even know how to
[1:44:56] pray but the spirit
[1:44:58] prays through us with groanings which
[1:45:01] cannot
[1:45:02] be uttered god is orchestrating this
[1:45:05] whole
[1:45:06] process when we pray it's not merely to
[1:45:09] change
[1:45:10] what's happened yes humanly speaking we
[1:45:12] look at it
[1:45:13] so and so has cancer we pray and that
[1:45:17] changes
[1:45:18] what happened on a human level that's
[1:45:21] absolutely true
[1:45:22] prayer changes things but on god's level
[1:45:27] it didn't change anything god
[1:45:30] allowed the person to come to this place
[1:45:34] that they had a sickness
[1:45:36] he moved upon the heart of the man to go
[1:45:39] and lay hands on that person and pray
[1:45:41] for them
[1:45:43] and that person was healed god ordained
[1:45:46] each step and process of that
[1:45:50] but without the prayer taking place
[1:45:53] the healing doesn't take place god is in
[1:45:56] each aspect of that
[1:45:58] the very god that ordained the salvation
[1:46:01] of people
[1:46:03] in in iran or turkey
[1:46:06] or egypt ordained to send
[1:46:10] a preacher there to preach the word to
[1:46:13] them
[1:46:13] and there was many many prayers that
[1:46:15] went into all of that
[1:46:17] process of getting there
[1:46:20] perhaps thousands perhaps tens of
[1:46:23] thousands
[1:46:24] of things happened that led to that
[1:46:26] place
[1:46:27] that brought that there and god has
[1:46:29] ordained that prayer be such
[1:46:31] a huge portion of it because he wants us
[1:46:34] to be
[1:46:35] participants active parts of his plan of
[1:46:39] salvation he could have
[1:46:40] as the prophet said he could have
[1:46:41] ordained the wind to preach the gospel
[1:46:43] he could have
[1:46:44] ordained uh the moon to preach the
[1:46:46] gospel but he ordained that man
[1:46:49] be a part of his program and his process
[1:46:53] in order to bring the salvation eternal
[1:46:56] salvation of souls and so
[1:47:00] those things are critical to understand
[1:47:02] yes god has decreed everything
[1:47:04] nothing will afford his will yes he's
[1:47:07] ordained
[1:47:08] that your prayers be a part of that
[1:47:10] process
[1:47:12] they must be prayers do not change the
[1:47:14] mind of god
[1:47:17] nothing can change the mind of god
[1:47:18] because the mind the thoughts of god are
[1:47:20] eternal he's omniscient
[1:47:22] he's not learning anything he's not
[1:47:23] changing his mind
[1:47:25] now the scripture will say in different
[1:47:26] places that it repented him
[1:47:29] that he made man upon the earth
[1:47:33] well when god speaks to us
[1:47:36] in human terms he he says
[1:47:39] i'm sick of your sacrifices
[1:47:43] is god truly sick
[1:47:47] they're a stink in my nostrils do things
[1:47:50] really
[1:47:51] genuinely smell bad to god maybe so
[1:47:55] because he says it very often but the re
[1:47:58] the real thing is that's happening
[1:48:01] that's going on is
[1:48:02] god is speaking to us in human terms
[1:48:05] that we can understand
[1:48:08] he's speaking to us in that way so we
[1:48:11] know who he is
[1:48:12] we know his purpose we know his plan
[1:48:16] so god created man he had a purpose for
[1:48:20] man
[1:48:20] and man went away from that purpose
[1:48:24] hybrid everything perverted everything
[1:48:27] and it comes to that place in the days
[1:48:29] of noah and he says
[1:48:30] it repents me at my heart that i've made
[1:48:33] man
[1:48:34] i will destroy him from the face of the
[1:48:37] earth
[1:48:38] and so god knew that would happen
[1:48:42] you know we have two levels we have god
[1:48:44] as he's revealing himself
[1:48:46] to us so that we can understand what
[1:48:48] he's doing
[1:48:49] and then god in his eternal
[1:48:52] godhood he's outside of time he knew
[1:48:56] all those things were going to happen he
[1:48:58] ordained them to happen
[1:49:00] for an example and a type his hand is in
[1:49:04] all of it
[1:49:05] he was not surprised by anything and
[1:49:08] another place in the scripture it says
[1:49:10] god is not a man
[1:49:11] that he should repent or the son of man
[1:49:14] that he should lie
[1:49:17] god does not repent yet we have
[1:49:19] scriptures that we see god repents
[1:49:22] so again what does it mean it means that
[1:49:23] there's two different ways
[1:49:25] to understand that god is not actually
[1:49:28] changing his mind because his thoughts
[1:49:30] are eternal
[1:49:31] that's who he is in himself in himself
[1:49:34] in eternity
[1:49:35] but as god deals with us in time
[1:49:38] to us when we pray it changes something
[1:49:42] when man sins god repents and says i'm
[1:49:44] going to destroy him
[1:49:46] that wasn't god's original purpose and
[1:49:48] plan for man
[1:49:49] that's not what he decreed for man to be
[1:49:51] a
[1:49:52] perverted cesspool of homosexuality and
[1:49:56] and adultery and murder and
[1:49:59] racism and all these different things he
[1:50:01] didn't make man to be that
[1:50:03] so god is sorry in his heart that man
[1:50:06] would do
[1:50:07] such and such a thing but god in himself
[1:50:11] knows that knows all these things
[1:50:13] ordained them for a purpose
[1:50:14] and so it's just a matter of seeing
[1:50:17] scripture
[1:50:18] on the level that scripture is bringing
[1:50:20] it as musicians
[1:50:22] if you'd like to come forward
[1:50:26] knowing this great god whose purpose
[1:50:30] is immutable and invincible is the
[1:50:33] greatest thing that you and i
[1:50:35] experience in our lives and
[1:50:40] i'm just so thankful
[1:50:43] for the grace that he's opened my eyes
[1:50:46] he's opened your eyes
[1:50:48] to know who he is in true reality and
[1:50:50] that he sent a message
[1:50:52] to us in this day to restore a true
[1:50:55] revelation and understanding
[1:50:57] of who he is that's his grace from start
[1:51:00] to finish
[1:51:01] i'm so thankful for that
[1:51:05] let's pray heavenly father we just
[1:51:09] come to you lord and we thank you for
[1:51:11] your word i pray that you would take
[1:51:13] this lord and
[1:51:14] take this revealed truth from scripture
[1:51:17] and
[1:51:18] let it permeate our entire being our
[1:51:20] minds and our hearts lord
[1:51:22] may it penetrate deep within our soul
[1:51:25] lord and bring
[1:51:26] a continual transformation to us lord
[1:51:29] that we would be made
[1:51:31] likened to the image of the one that
[1:51:33] we're worshiping lord
[1:51:35] we thank you for that we give you honor
[1:51:38] and glory and praise lord
[1:51:41] your good your righteousness endures
[1:51:45] forever and we're so thankful lord we
[1:51:47] ask these things in the name of jesus
[1:51:49] christ

[1:52:33] that all in
[1:52:33] into one one sermon so much said there
[1:52:39] to think though that he was slain from
[1:52:42] before the foundation of the world
[1:52:44] to make sure it was all covered and
[1:52:45] taken care of
[1:52:47] because he saw he saw you and me
[1:52:50] in this hour and this day and i
[1:52:52] appreciate that
[1:52:54] i was thinking just
[1:52:57] maybe two weeks ago speaking with
[1:53:01] someone and they were talking about the
[1:53:02] scars and the wounds in life
[1:53:05] and and and how they they're showing and
[1:53:08] how we hide them and
[1:53:10] we don't want sometimes to see people
[1:53:11] that see that we're wounded and we're
[1:53:13] hurt
[1:53:14] but to realize that he knew that already
[1:53:18] and he would make a way for us so as he
[1:53:21] was ministering and i just think
[1:53:23] majesty worship his majesty
[1:53:28] king of all kings uh words whatever
[1:53:32] words we could use whatever words we
[1:53:33] could say would it be enough
[1:53:36] it might not be enough but he wants to
[1:53:38] hear from us soon
[1:53:47] worship his majesty
[1:53:54] unto jesus
[1:54:09] majesty
[1:54:13] kingdom authority
