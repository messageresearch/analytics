[40:35] wilson would be with us
[40:39] and he brought his security guard escort
[40:42] caretaker um
[40:44] oliver
[40:45] brother eliaser is always good to see
[40:47] you
[40:48] god bless you
[40:51] and i'll go and give you a little plug
[40:52] if that's okay he's a good mechanic too
[40:55] [Music]
[40:56] and uh for a small field give you his
[40:58] phone number
[41:00] now
[41:01] he's helped a lot of brothers out i just
[41:02] recently found out of the work he did as
[41:04] a mechanic and then as i heard oh yeah
[41:07] he helped us he helped us so
[41:09] that's good that god puts those gifts in
[41:11] the body of christ to help one another
[41:14] if he'll stand with me our brother jesse
[41:15] wilson
[41:18] i had asked him i mentioned to you so
[41:21] quite some time ago possibly when i
[41:22] heard he was ministering and
[41:25] participating and helping out and i said
[41:28] so
[41:29] he uh
[41:31] he said he would and he talked to
[41:32] brother caleb and brother caleb said
[41:34] maybe i
[41:35] should better get a little experience
[41:36] under your belt
[41:38] and i thought that was good i think
[41:41] because he wasn't hardly nervous at all
[41:42] when he walked in so
[41:44] that's a good thing so
[41:47] i just know that god saw this day
[41:50] he said he has part of a testimony
[41:52] sharing some things that god gave to him
[41:53] so if he'll pull and draw
[41:56] god will minister to us so amen amazing
[41:58] grace

[43:24] amen god bless you tonight
[43:27] it's real privileged beer tonight thank
[43:28] you musicians i'm not going to sing
[43:30] and they already probably know that i
[43:32] don't know keys so i just sing whatever
[43:34] i can
[43:36] and try to make a joyful noise to lord
[43:37] amen
[43:38] before we get started i got a little bit
[43:40] of a testimony to read and then
[43:42] just a little bit of a thought i want to
[43:44] talk about tonight
[43:45] but if you'll bur if you'll turn to your
[43:47] bibles to john 14 12
[43:50] and then we're going to go to matthew 12
[43:52] 25.
[43:55] surprising i'm actually talking a little
[43:57] slow usually i'm really really really
[43:58] fast
[43:59] an hour long sermon usually takes me
[44:01] about five seconds so
[44:03] try to make it a little long but not too
[44:05] long tonight amen
[44:08] amen
[44:10] john 14 12
[44:12] verily verily i say unto you he that
[44:14] believeth on me the works that i do
[44:16] shall he do also
[44:18] and the greater works than these shall
[44:20] he do because i go into the father
[44:23] unto my father amen excuse me
[44:25] let's go over to matthew 12 25
[44:32] amen
[44:37] and jesus know their thoughts and said
[44:39] unto them every kingdom divided against
[44:41] itself is brought to desolation and
[44:44] every city or house divided against
[44:46] itself shall not stand
[44:48] amen just pray for a moment please
[44:51] dear heavenly father
[44:53] i have notes in front of me
[44:55] and every time lord i get to talk about
[44:56] you lord i don't want to talk about me i
[44:59] don't want to talk about
[45:01] basically my life lord before meeting
[45:03] you the lord i am standing here as a
[45:05] testimony once again follower to say you
[45:08] are truly a wonderful god and i am
[45:11] eternally grateful to you lord for the
[45:14] opportunity lord to talk about you
[45:17] and father you saw me in a state lord
[45:18] that you knew i couldn't get out myself
[45:20] but an amazing grace you had lord to me
[45:24] and thank you father once for again for
[45:25] saving me so lord as i begin to talk
[45:28] about you lord
[45:29] please be in every aspect of the service
[45:31] lord for your honor and glory lord what
[45:33] i'm here for in precious name of jesus
[45:35] christ we pray
[45:36] amen you may be seated
[45:42] now
[45:43] our church is a little small and i'm
[45:44] used to a lot of noise so if you say
[45:45] amen hallelujah it's not going to deter
[45:47] me if god determines to take over the
[45:49] service and we start worshiping that's
[45:51] all fine i'd rather you hear from god
[45:52] tonight and not for me amen
[45:55] let me get my
[45:56] handwriting over here brother ellie's
[45:58] here i'm telling you this is this is
[45:59] terrible i gotta get my laptop and start
[46:01] typing this stuff up again
[46:03] let's start with a testimony
[46:06] i guess we said skip all the part right
[46:08] like when i was born and all that stuff
[46:09] we need to skip ahead a little bit okay
[46:10] we don't have that much time
[46:12] so 18 years old i moved out on my own i
[46:14] moved out of my house and i lived on my
[46:16] own but every night i remember when i
[46:18] was living now i'm wearing purple
[46:20] sometimes it means power but i'm going
[46:21] to be very transparent is that okay
[46:24] you're going to hear a lot of things
[46:24] that you're going to look at me and say
[46:26] he did what he did those things i can't
[46:28] believe he was that bad of a sinner that
[46:30] prayer i just said that was from my
[46:32] heart and there's others that will
[46:33] testify that i was a
[46:35] worldly guy okay i came to this church
[46:38] my grandfather was the pastor here
[46:40] everyone knows that but i'm not just one
[46:42] of grandsons i'm seven of his grandsons
[46:44] amen but the only times i remember
[46:46] coming here was a young kid when i used
[46:47] to sleep on the pew but ever since i was
[46:49] a young man 18 i've been on my own and
[46:52] since 18 to about 27 i didn't attend
[46:55] church about two times i think i came
[46:57] here once to see my my grandfather or my
[46:59] grandmother sing me a song and she
[47:01] reminds me that she sang me a song and i
[47:03] don't remember it so see i'm telling you
[47:05] that's how bad i was i was not
[47:08] ready to serve god i was not ready to be
[47:11] in the house of god i was not ready to
[47:13] be of service to god amen
[47:15] so i joined at 18 i went right in the
[47:17] military it was like 18 and then four
[47:19] days before i turned 19 i was in boot
[47:21] camp because every night in high school
[47:23] when i was living on my own my own house
[47:25] remember i'm not with my parents i'm on
[47:27] my own paying my own bills
[47:29] every night i was doing the things that
[47:32] worldly guys teenagers tend to do
[47:34] everything mom and dad tell them not to
[47:36] do everything that will get you in
[47:37] trouble i was pretty much chasing after
[47:39] that
[47:40] but every night there was a loneliness
[47:42] in my heart thinking
[47:43] going out there and i remember looking
[47:44] at the the full moon no moon stars
[47:47] asking god i know you exist but why am i
[47:51] here
[47:53] if i'm doing all these wrong things then
[47:54] why are my still breathing right now
[47:58] so i kept looking for a purpose
[48:00] but as you heard the scripture i said a
[48:02] house divided will fall so how can i be
[48:06] doing what the devil wants me to do what
[48:08] i thought was a great life but yet now
[48:11] on the other side over here i'm saying
[48:13] god will you help me
[48:15] a divided house amen
[48:17] so i went into the military i didn't
[48:19] know what to do my cousin's like let's
[48:20] join the military let's have a purpose
[48:22] let's go
[48:23] be the best we can be amen
[48:25] so i said okay let's go do that so i
[48:28] went through basic training went through
[48:29] ait got in the normal army i know
[48:31] there's some military friends here so
[48:33] you know exactly what we're talking
[48:34] about here soon
[48:36] and my whole purpose in life was
[48:38] military
[48:39] everything i did was to be the best i
[48:41] didn't want no wife i didn't want no
[48:43] kids my purpose in life was to travel
[48:45] the world train with the best and become
[48:47] the best
[48:49] i felt really short of that but i tried
[48:51] i tried my best i still don't like
[48:52] running two miles but i tried amen
[48:55] but after eight years
[48:57] those two mile runs every monday morning
[49:01] but after eight years three deployments
[49:04] i thought everything i was doing good i
[49:06] mean i've been around the world about
[49:07] seven times kind of sounds like my
[49:09] grandfather but he was doing a better
[49:10] purpose than what i was mine was
[49:12] something that was a great purpose but
[49:14] it was for the government it was for you
[49:15] it was like i had a purpose and if i
[49:18] died that's the contract i signed amen
[49:20] that's what my purpose was so i thought
[49:22] i was happy
[49:23] but eight years three deployments later
[49:26] i saw friends committing suicide
[49:27] overseas
[49:29] overseas
[49:31] in the war zone
[49:33] now i'm single not married no kids like
[49:35] i have nothing back at home so if i'm
[49:38] dividing the purpose i have a purpose
[49:40] that's what i keep focusing on
[49:41] but when i started seeing that happening
[49:43] i'm like something is not right
[49:47] there's not going to be a military
[49:48] tangible ptsd and everything but
[49:50] i started realizing that someone started
[49:51] talking to me that maybe this is not
[49:53] what you should have been doing
[49:55] maybe eight years of what you've been
[49:56] doing
[49:57] there's another optical illusion that i
[49:59] got
[50:00] that i thought i was doing that i
[50:01] thought was the thing to do
[50:04] but after i saw that i got out
[50:07] it took me over a year
[50:10] to try to be a person again
[50:13] when you're in the military and you have
[50:15] someone always want to know where you're
[50:17] at your hair cut is your beard trim like
[50:20] this would get me in trouble i mean i
[50:21] even trimmed it a little bit but i like
[50:23] having a little beard your hair touching
[50:24] your ears like you had to be on point
[50:27] all the time
[50:28] so when i got in the military for a year
[50:30] it was really hard for me to me to
[50:31] understand that i'm my own person now i
[50:33] can do whatever i want
[50:35] but remember i said back in high school
[50:37] before i won the military
[50:38] i just fell back in the trap again
[50:42] i thought i was gonna be happy again
[50:44] doing the same thing i was doing eight
[50:46] years prior
[50:48] it took me over a year
[50:50] before i realized
[50:52] that something is still not right
[50:58] after a year of doing what i wanted i
[51:00] tried school i tried college
[51:03] if i cried it's okay don't worry i'm
[51:04] okay it's just
[51:06] you know
[51:07] they're always here unfortunately kids
[51:08] if you can avoid the things your parents
[51:10] are telling you there's a reason so you
[51:11] don't have to keep remembering this
[51:12] stuff and won't come up to badly
[51:14] especially when you're trying to tell
[51:15] everyone about your testimony
[51:17] but after that i tried scuba school i
[51:19] tried college
[51:20] i try to do whatever i thought was best
[51:22] i was on the verge of going broke all
[51:24] the money i couldn't accumulated was
[51:26] about to run out about to lose my car i
[51:27] don't have a house remember i'm still on
[51:29] my own i'm arguing with my mom i'm
[51:30] arguing with my sisters they're trying
[51:31] to give me help i'm telling them
[51:33] words i'm not going to say but you get
[51:35] the thoughts i'm a 27 year old man
[51:37] trying to tell them i still know better
[51:39] than you please hold your peace
[51:43] it wasn't until i was about to lose
[51:44] everything that i moved back here
[51:46] because i was like i'm gonna lose
[51:47] everything at least my family is putting
[51:49] up with me and all the stuff i was going
[51:51] through
[51:53] and
[51:54] during that time
[51:57] i went through college i was able to get
[51:58] a good degree
[52:00] but then i hit what's called
[52:01] transitional depression
[52:03] as you know
[52:04] my grandfather died
[52:06] i broke up with someone i was dating
[52:07] with and i also moved from an apartment
[52:10] to a house
[52:11] now it doesn't sound like a big deal but
[52:13] when those three things hit you at once
[52:15] it's called transitional depression so i
[52:18] was in the house doing whatever i wanted
[52:19] living out in miranda i had no
[52:22] accountability i'm still doing what i
[52:23] want to do
[52:25] still trying to figure out why am i
[52:26] unhappy i have pool league i have a nice
[52:29] car i have a house i have i thought i
[52:31] had the world of goods i
[52:32] i thought i was doing good again
[52:35] but i'm still sad
[52:43] it wasn't until a young woman invited me
[52:45] to church
[52:47] again worldly i'm going to be completely
[52:49] transparent
[52:50] and i told her you need to stay away
[52:52] from me
[52:54] because i am not a guy you should talk
[52:56] to interact with because the thoughts
[52:57] that i have are not what you think is
[53:00] going to happen if i start coming around
[53:01] and going to church
[53:02] i'm not going to go any further than
[53:03] that okay all right
[53:06] but they kept inviting me to go to
[53:07] church kept on vitamin church i'm like
[53:08] no i don't want to do that my life is
[53:11] happy
[53:12] but at home it's not
[53:17] so after that depression really hit me
[53:19] i'm like i'm not gonna go to church it's
[53:21] not gonna happen it got down to one day
[53:24] after my grandfather passed i'm at home
[53:26] after work and i just sat there
[53:29] and i made this confession
[53:32] because i was thinking about going to
[53:33] church
[53:34] and i said lord if you do not act on the
[53:36] scene right now
[53:39] if i go to church and nothing changes
[53:42] that gun i have
[53:44] with the bullets in it that will do the
[53:46] job
[53:47] i'm going to use it
[53:51] you hear what i said
[53:52] i was going to end it
[53:54] i have a car a home i have a life i
[53:56] thought
[53:57] was good
[53:58] but yet here i am telling god first off
[54:01] i'm telling god what
[54:03] what i'm gonna do like i'm threatening
[54:04] god first off again that's just a true
[54:06] confession
[54:07] i said if nothing changes i will end it
[54:10] and there's no one that's going to stop
[54:11] me because there's no one at home to
[54:12] stop me
[54:13] my family's not involved i go to and
[54:15] from the bars i go wherever i want i can
[54:17] do this anytime i want
[54:19] so i tried i came to church one time
[54:22] to here
[54:24] but
[54:25] transitional oppression
[54:26] with another profession now coming here
[54:29] remembering my grandfather is not here
[54:32] hit me like a ton of bricks
[54:34] so i went back home and i was like god
[54:37] nothing happened
[54:39] here we go but then my phone rang
[54:41] and my mom says hold on why don't you
[54:44] go over to amazing grass tabernacle just
[54:46] try it one time
[54:48] and that's when i met the brothers from
[54:50] the church and brother caleb duron
[54:53] now i know brother cable was here again
[54:54] i didn't know the back history i didn't
[54:56] know all that she said he was just a
[54:58] minister with her grandfather just go
[54:59] talk to him see if he can help you
[55:02] now you know his past is testimony i'm
[55:03] gonna leave it there
[55:05] and just say the first words he said to
[55:06] me after service was i'm not better than
[55:09] you
[55:09] i am you
[55:11] i was like what do you mean you're a
[55:13] pastor of a church like you're a
[55:15] shepherd like you go to church and then
[55:16] i started talking to them in a while on
[55:18] basis talking to the brothers i'm like
[55:19] what did he mean by that
[55:21] so god put someone in my life that had
[55:23] gone through the same worldly life doing
[55:26] what he wanted almost exact same age
[55:28] like our life stories are so close
[55:30] together it's pretty scary
[55:32] the things i was doing the things that
[55:33] he was doing we wanted to do whatever we
[55:35] wanted to
[55:36] but we both knew that there was
[55:37] something inside that needed to change
[55:40] so we're seeing amazing grace
[55:42] that is
[55:45] a lot of people just seen that song just
[55:46] to sing that song but there has to be
[55:49] grace there has to be a god because he
[55:51] knew i was going to end it
[56:01] so i felt led to get re-baptized
[56:04] so now a change is starting to happen to
[56:06] me
[56:07] but i want to tell you honest truth i
[56:08] was still not living right even though
[56:10] i'm starting to attend church i'm still
[56:12] doing that i'll call the bars what i
[56:14] still wanted to do on sunday i'm a good
[56:18] guy
[56:19] but when i get home i'm not who you
[56:20] think i am sitting next to you in the
[56:22] pew
[56:23] there's a lot of times that i'm still
[56:24] repenting over that thinking i knew
[56:26] better when i went to church doing the
[56:27] things i was still doing being around
[56:29] some of you
[56:31] bringing that spirit in but now i've
[56:32] learned that spirits on me could have
[56:34] jumped to you so i apologize to you if
[56:36] you ever met me and you thought
[56:38] something bad it probably wasn't you it
[56:40] was probably me carrying around that
[56:42] luggage because i didn't know how to
[56:43] repent
[56:44] so brother caleb and me talked and at
[56:47] the time we were redoing the bathroom so
[56:48] i started coming around and we were
[56:50] redoing the bathrooms of the church
[56:52] and he made a comment because i want to
[56:53] get re-baptized he's like well it's a
[56:55] long walk
[56:57] from the church like basically from his
[56:59] office get baptized over to the
[57:01] fellowship hall it's probably if you
[57:03] haven't been over to our church it's
[57:04] probably from
[57:05] this front step maybe to that back wall
[57:07] it's really not that far
[57:09] but something inside of me because i had
[57:11] a longing to get re-baptized i said
[57:13] jesus walked further than that for me
[57:17] startled he was like
[57:19] first off he was like where'd that come
[57:20] from and i was like i don't know
[57:22] but it was inspiration because i knew
[57:25] remember when i was talking to god the
[57:26] same time slowed down god i need to
[57:28] change or i'm going to end this this is
[57:29] still here
[57:31] so when we got to get baptized i think
[57:34] there was three that day it was
[57:37] i think everyone had their camera out
[57:39] because they knew i was struggling they
[57:40] knew i was going through something
[57:42] and everyone saw me walk into the water
[57:45] and it all hit me
[57:47] at once
[57:49] they prayed a prayer and i left it all
[57:52] there
[57:53] in that baptism
[57:55] every pain every hurt all of this was
[57:58] just overflowing
[58:00] because i got baptized here's one before
[58:02] but i did it for a different reason
[58:04] so if you need to recess what we call it
[58:06] that's what i went through i went
[58:07] through a reset
[58:09] because i was getting serious about god
[58:11] there has to be a change in me there has
[58:13] to be service to you because everything
[58:14] else i've tried doesn't work
[58:20] everything got better everything than
[58:22] god just wonderful life changed
[58:24] nope
[58:27] why
[58:30] because
[58:32] i got baptized
[58:33] i confessed like it says in the
[58:35] scripture
[58:36] i confess that jesus christ is my lord
[58:38] and i asked him for forgive me and then
[58:40] i got baptized
[58:41] but what was awaiting me at home was the
[58:43] old habits and the life that i knew that
[58:45] when i got home i had a certain time of
[58:47] when i was gonna do things when i was
[58:49] gonna crack a beer open when i was gonna
[58:50] play video games do everything else
[58:52] still not reading my bibles still not
[58:53] paying attention to guys still not
[58:54] giving them my time
[58:57] but remember i committed with my mouth
[59:00] to god saying i will serve you
[59:03] i asked him to forgive me so that i can
[59:06] serve him
[59:08] i said i am yours lord
[59:10] i am yours
[59:16] can you put up that uh the sermon
[59:19] quote by brother branham
[59:22] when i was preparing the notes for this
[59:23] i just preached on this a couple weeks
[59:25] ago
[59:26] but i didn't know again how wonderful i
[59:29] still know i know how wonderful god is
[59:30] let me back that up i didn't know that
[59:32] when i read this
[59:34] um at the church how now i can tie this
[59:38] in
[59:38] and say i wasn't serving god so why
[59:40] weren't things going right
[59:42] watch what he says you ready we're going
[59:44] through three fast this is uh
[59:47] what's the one title of it
[59:49] yeah i have heard but now i see
[59:51] it's 65.
[59:53] she says now the sick people that's in
[59:55] the building they're crippled people or
[59:56] you have a need of god when you can get
[59:58] that type of revelation that you are
[1:00:00] justified when you are actually
[1:00:02] justified in asking the thing that
[1:00:04] you're asking for and believe he is a
[1:00:06] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:00:08] him seek after him there's nothing can
[1:00:11] ever separate you from the faith that's
[1:00:13] anchored to you
[1:00:14] see but first it has to be revealed to
[1:00:16] you
[1:00:18] someone come not long ago a group of men
[1:00:20] some of them listening in tonight and
[1:00:21] told me said i kept telling them go to
[1:00:23] kentucky there's oil down there i knew
[1:00:26] it was i had seen it in a vision well
[1:00:28] brother
[1:00:29] is it demos
[1:00:31] demas is that i say right okay huh
[1:00:35] dms okay demons excuse me and them
[1:00:38] didn't go for a long time after a while
[1:00:39] finally they said after texas had moved
[1:00:41] and they said now we're going down
[1:00:45] i said you ought to have went a long
[1:00:47] time ago but they didn't do it
[1:00:50] he said i made a great mistake in that
[1:00:52] by not doing that brother branham i said
[1:00:55] if you had went down there you'd have
[1:00:56] had it all well they wouldn't listen to
[1:00:59] it then the first then for
[1:01:02] then before we left that night
[1:01:04] the place where we were having lunch the
[1:01:06] holy spirit showed me a great crack in
[1:01:08] the earth and then that was full of oil
[1:01:10] and these overflows in kentucky was just
[1:01:12] a little beads beds of oil that were
[1:01:14] pumping from but this one came from the
[1:01:17] mainstream and i said better demos it's
[1:01:20] there
[1:01:20] so they went to searching for it said go
[1:01:23] down and tell us where where the oil is
[1:01:27] i said oh no no no see we don't use the
[1:01:30] gift of god for commercial
[1:01:32] no no we he could tell me
[1:01:35] where it was at
[1:01:37] but i don't have any need of it i
[1:01:39] wouldn't even have faith enough to ask
[1:01:41] him see
[1:01:42] if i had need of it
[1:01:45] i believe i'd ask him he'd had he'd
[1:01:48] enough to ask or sorry skip that he'd
[1:01:50] tell me
[1:01:51] but first you see your motives and
[1:01:53] objectives have to be right
[1:01:56] now that's not my testimony remember my
[1:01:58] testimony was lord i want to serve you
[1:02:00] but then i started doing the things i
[1:02:02] want to do still
[1:02:04] but see he wrote i had made a commitment
[1:02:06] to god
[1:02:08] and this right here struck me when it
[1:02:09] said that no we don't use god's grace we
[1:02:12] don't use if he gives you a gift for
[1:02:15] your own purposes
[1:02:16] even though brother i'm saying if i had
[1:02:18] asked for it if i knew i needed of it
[1:02:20] then god would deliver it amen
[1:02:24] where was i but first you see the muslim
[1:02:26] judge had to be right you have to have
[1:02:28] reasons for this god don't give you
[1:02:30] those things just because you have just
[1:02:32] because you ask and you cannot ask in
[1:02:34] face unless there's a real objective to
[1:02:36] that
[1:02:37] to be in the will of god see if you want
[1:02:40] to be
[1:02:41] well what do you want to be well for
[1:02:45] see if you want to be healed what's the
[1:02:46] reason you want to be healed what are
[1:02:48] you telling god what do you want to do
[1:02:50] with your life when you get healed
[1:02:52] see there's got to be you've got to have
[1:02:54] a motive and objective and they have to
[1:02:57] be right according to the will of god
[1:02:59] and then there's and then when the faith
[1:03:01] is revealed to you and god by summer and
[1:03:03] grace places that faith in there then
[1:03:05] it's over see
[1:03:06] now see
[1:03:08] i read that
[1:03:10] because then i started realizing
[1:03:12] i didn't know about brother brenham i
[1:03:14] didn't know about his tapes i didn't
[1:03:15] know all about that
[1:03:16] but now here we are six later six years
[1:03:18] later in service of god that i preached
[1:03:19] about this and now i'm giving you a
[1:03:21] testimony i'm like
[1:03:22] well duh if i'm not doing what god wants
[1:03:24] to do if i'm not doing as well of the
[1:03:26] lord then how can i expect things to go
[1:03:28] right so let's jump back back in the
[1:03:30] past again so i started doing the things
[1:03:32] i wanted to do again so i went out i'm
[1:03:34] doing the things i want to do and then i
[1:03:36] got busted by the law
[1:03:38] because i was doing the things i thought
[1:03:40] was right yet i confessed that i was a
[1:03:43] christian going to church and i was
[1:03:44] doing
[1:03:45] what i thought that god what god want me
[1:03:46] to do
[1:03:48] how many times i've heard a lot how many
[1:03:50] times have you heard someone well i'm
[1:03:51] just going to bar to be a testimony
[1:03:55] listen to the greatest battle ever
[1:03:56] fought he covers that you walk into bars
[1:03:58] you walk into those clubs gentlemen
[1:04:00] clubs i'm not going to explicit but you
[1:04:02] think going to those that you think
[1:04:04] you're going to make someone's life
[1:04:05] change in there
[1:04:06] you really better know what you're doing
[1:04:08] and god better tell you that you need to
[1:04:10] go those places because that fight that
[1:04:12] you're about to get in is going to be
[1:04:13] overwhelming
[1:04:16] because i can testify to it
[1:04:20] so i got in trouble
[1:04:23] man that's not fun
[1:04:25] those fines the court dates lawyers all
[1:04:28] that stuff that had to get involved and
[1:04:30] man did i feel stupid going back to
[1:04:32] church because here i am i just got
[1:04:34] baptized
[1:04:35] here i am testifying god's good
[1:04:37] but i'm now in jail
[1:04:40] you know and having to go through all
[1:04:41] the legal procedures
[1:04:43] even after this the brothers were like
[1:04:45] they didn't give up on me they said hey
[1:04:47] there's a camp coming up
[1:04:49] they've had testimonies there
[1:04:51] let's why don't you go with us and
[1:04:54] just get away for a while let's just see
[1:04:57] you know what will happen
[1:04:58] so i said sure
[1:05:00] whatever i have to lose i've already
[1:05:01] embarrassed myself i've already crushed
[1:05:03] basically the testimony that i just had
[1:05:05] now i'm in a bigger fight of my life so
[1:05:08] i go to the camp up there was it white
[1:05:10] mountains
[1:05:12] yeah
[1:05:13] hebert
[1:05:15] that camp went up there in that camp
[1:05:17] with her brothers and i'm looking for
[1:05:19] something the whole way up there i'm
[1:05:21] driving on temporary license the whole
[1:05:24] way i'm driving up there and i'm asking
[1:05:25] him how do you find god how do you find
[1:05:27] the holy spirit how do i get close to
[1:05:28] god and by the time like three hours in
[1:05:30] there to like
[1:05:31] brother austin he's like will you just
[1:05:33] stop and i'm like what he's like i think
[1:05:35] you're looking too hard
[1:05:37] so we get to our cabin i'm thinking
[1:05:39] about what he said he's like it's not
[1:05:41] going to be the same for you as it was
[1:05:43] for us
[1:05:45] what god will do for you when you seek
[1:05:47] after him is going to be different than
[1:05:48] the way i experienced it
[1:05:51] so we took a nap
[1:05:52] we went to that night service
[1:05:55] and
[1:05:56] 300 kids i think
[1:05:58] it was filled i've never been to
[1:05:59] something like that before a whole
[1:06:01] church event before so we get there and
[1:06:03] me and ellie's here is in the front and
[1:06:05] there's kind of like a sadness on the
[1:06:07] camp you know because these are new kids
[1:06:08] coming in and they're getting pulled
[1:06:10] they're getting pulled to the worldly
[1:06:11] ways instead of going to christian ways
[1:06:13] and brother caleb miller look at me and
[1:06:14] they're like this something's not right
[1:06:16] we have to energize this we have to talk
[1:06:17] like we have to talk
[1:06:19] we have to be basically the pillars like
[1:06:20] we need to praise and worship god
[1:06:22] so that's what we did the entire time
[1:06:24] the kid gets up there preaches he's like
[1:06:26] what is it going to take for you to be
[1:06:27] serious with god
[1:06:29] one of the brothers from phoenix
[1:06:31] i think it was b3 at the time it was b3
[1:06:34] i'm in the very front see about right
[1:06:36] here he comes from all the way from the
[1:06:38] back
[1:06:39] because you can feel something's moving
[1:06:41] but again i've never felt the spear
[1:06:42] before i've never been for the holy
[1:06:43] spirit i didn't know at least i didn't
[1:06:45] know i had been filled before if i did
[1:06:47] as a kid
[1:06:48] but he walks from the back to the front
[1:06:51] just seeing his hands up
[1:06:53] something sparked to me and i was like i
[1:06:55] want that
[1:06:56] whatever is calling on him right now in
[1:06:59] front of 300 people because remember i'm
[1:07:01] military trained i'm special op trains i
[1:07:03] did everything you think of the military
[1:07:05] did with some of the most elite forces
[1:07:06] and now i'm going to stand up in front
[1:07:08] of 300 kids at church service
[1:07:10] that's a pillow swallow because i had
[1:07:11] too much pride
[1:07:13] but seeing that surrender caused
[1:07:15] something to stir inside of me saying
[1:07:18] that's what you've been chasing
[1:07:21] so brother caleb says who else is going
[1:07:23] to stand up and i was the second person
[1:07:25] down on my knees or at least between the
[1:07:27] tears that's all i could tell was that i
[1:07:28] was on
[1:07:30] a bench just crying out to god
[1:07:33] so brother caleb is talking about it and
[1:07:35] there's more just coming up to altar
[1:07:37] he says who wants the holy spirit raise
[1:07:39] your hand
[1:07:40] he also asked some other brothers will
[1:07:41] you go touch your friend if they're here
[1:07:43] to get filled with the holy spirit i'm
[1:07:45] already on my knees i can't even i
[1:07:47] barely can barely breathe
[1:07:49] you know i'm a mess let's just say i'm a
[1:07:51] disaster i'm a mess but this is a good
[1:07:54] disaster this is the surrender of my
[1:07:56] life that i have been looking for for
[1:07:58] months
[1:08:00] testimony from my brother over there he
[1:08:02] said that when he came up to me and
[1:08:03] brother came up asking the holy spirit
[1:08:04] and i put my hand up i actually touched
[1:08:06] his hand he said i was freezing cold
[1:08:11] sounds familiar doesn't it
[1:08:13] i'm pretty sure there was a prophet
[1:08:15] that lived that my grandfather
[1:08:18] testified of his testimony that when he
[1:08:20] walked up on the stage that he stepped
[1:08:22] into something that felt like a freezer
[1:08:25] and the prophet told him
[1:08:26] that won't hurt you because it won't
[1:08:28] right don't be afraid it won't hurt you
[1:08:31] so someone inside me says
[1:08:36] i love it when you can relive that
[1:08:37] moment
[1:08:39] something hit me
[1:08:40] i was so cold that the next five hours i
[1:08:43] can't remember what happened
[1:08:45] we're singing spanish we're speaking in
[1:08:46] english i don't know what they're saying
[1:08:47] but we're in so much worship there's so
[1:08:49] much love that you can't tell what's
[1:08:51] going on we are going around praying for
[1:08:53] every person there is asking to be
[1:08:55] touched we are touching them i'm even
[1:08:57] praying for our pastor praying for
[1:08:58] others i'm getting prayed for we're so
[1:09:00] like just filled the holy spirit is
[1:09:02] going around there that
[1:09:04] hundreds of kids got delivered that
[1:09:05] night
[1:09:07] that was my first holy ghost experience
[1:09:12] we even got back in the vans and we
[1:09:13] drove all night i think eliezer was on
[1:09:15] one van and i was in our van and i was
[1:09:17] so
[1:09:18] filled so happy so like that's what i
[1:09:21] have been looking for
[1:09:23] was that joy because it wasn't
[1:09:26] in the world
[1:09:27] it's not in the world i can tell you
[1:09:30] it's not
[1:09:32] money fade popularity all stuff is not
[1:09:34] going to make you happy
[1:09:36] but when you get sincere with god and
[1:09:38] you make that commitment to surrender to
[1:09:40] him and this is not a one-time thing
[1:09:43] every time i have to be reminded that
[1:09:44] when i go to church the mortgage the
[1:09:46] rent all that stuff all that stuff needs
[1:09:47] to be in the past
[1:09:49] i can't bring that in the church
[1:09:52] because the spirit that i'm looking for
[1:09:53] i want that touch again and again and
[1:09:56] again and again
[1:10:02] so after that
[1:10:04] let's get through stuff really kind of
[1:10:06] quickly
[1:10:07] me and i'll start talking
[1:10:09] i'm still
[1:10:10] i think i was better wasn't i don't know
[1:10:12] maybe just a little bit better
[1:10:14] a little bit better
[1:10:15] i thought i was still doing better
[1:10:17] and
[1:10:19] i saw my family go after trial after
[1:10:20] trial after trial
[1:10:22] and i'm like why is this happening
[1:10:25] and i went over to the petersons for
[1:10:27] dinner most times we had those
[1:10:28] conversations me and brother arne has
[1:10:29] conversations at dinner table i'm like
[1:10:31] what are we missing
[1:10:35] why when we are laying our hands on
[1:10:37] people why when we're praying for people
[1:10:39] why are they not
[1:10:41] what's not changing
[1:10:43] sister was going through cancer for
[1:10:44] years even twice
[1:10:46] now she's passed away
[1:10:48] but why
[1:10:51] so i got along with god a couple weeks
[1:10:52] ago
[1:10:54] you've heard hadassah my wife's
[1:10:55] testimony that she got to the point
[1:10:56] where she couldn't even walk
[1:10:58] she fainted a couple times i had to
[1:11:00] catch her put on the couch i'd take her
[1:11:01] to the hospital because we're praying
[1:11:02] for her but we didn't know like what is
[1:11:04] going on here
[1:11:07] so i got in my truck
[1:11:10] and sister rachel and grace and lily
[1:11:12] they all came over
[1:11:14] i can't talk highly enough about them
[1:11:15] about that family
[1:11:17] they came over
[1:11:18] almost every day for days because we
[1:11:20] have a little baby boy and i have to
[1:11:21] work from home i think i drive everyone
[1:11:23] crazy when i do that but they came over
[1:11:24] and prayed with her and they were making
[1:11:26] us dinner and they're doing everything
[1:11:27] they can to be a supportive family they
[1:11:29] have family across the country praying
[1:11:30] for him
[1:11:31] and i'm sitting there being like
[1:11:34] what am i doing wrong i'm a husband i
[1:11:36] should be able to lay my hands on her
[1:11:37] she should recover right now
[1:11:39] what am i missing
[1:11:41] so i got in my truck our truck
[1:11:44] her truck if she asked you it's her
[1:11:45] truck
[1:11:47] her truck
[1:11:48] and i went out and got along with god
[1:11:50] and i was like that's i wasn't like
[1:11:52] where that came from excuse me
[1:11:54] i asked god
[1:11:56] i'm about to preach tomorrow night my
[1:11:57] wife's at home
[1:11:59] what am i doing wrong
[1:12:01] i'm missing something
[1:12:05] that's where this thought came from
[1:12:12] okay let's go to
[1:12:14] matthew 15 21-28
[1:12:18] i don't know what time it is but i
[1:12:19] promise i'm getting close
[1:12:24] it just started
[1:12:25] okay we go back to when i was born yeah
[1:12:27] no okay
[1:12:29] gotta have fun when talking about god
[1:12:31] it's just
[1:12:32] you gotta have fun
[1:12:33] you gotta really just being transparent
[1:12:36] with you has helped me a lot and thank
[1:12:37] you guys for accepting
[1:12:40] all my past and baggage and everything i
[1:12:42] brought along with me
[1:12:44] so matthew 15 21-28
[1:12:50] it's all right
[1:12:56] yes
[1:12:57] yes then jesus went hence and departed
[1:13:00] into the coast of tyre incident and
[1:13:02] beheld behold a woman of canaan came out
[1:13:05] of the same coast and cried on him
[1:13:07] saying have mercy on me o lord thou son
[1:13:10] of david my daughter is grievely fixed
[1:13:13] vexed with a devil
[1:13:15] nice one but he answered her not a word
[1:13:18] and his disciples came and besought him
[1:13:21] saying send her away for she crieth
[1:13:23] after us
[1:13:24] but he answered and said i am not sent
[1:13:28] but unto the lost sheep of the house of
[1:13:30] israel
[1:13:33] then came she and worshipped him saying
[1:13:35] lord help me
[1:13:38] do you see what's happening right here
[1:13:40] canaanite is a gentile
[1:13:42] we're gentiles
[1:13:44] she's talking to the creator
[1:13:46] in human form saying lord i have need of
[1:13:48] you and he's saying i am not here for
[1:13:51] you
[1:13:54] to me that's
[1:13:55] just being honest
[1:13:57] that would kind of deter me a little bit
[1:13:58] like okay he's not going to help i've
[1:14:00] heard everything about him but now he's
[1:14:01] not going to help me
[1:14:03] but watch how she keeps going
[1:14:06] but he answered and said it is not me to
[1:14:08] take the children's bread and to cast it
[1:14:10] to dogs
[1:14:12] and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat
[1:14:15] of the crumbs which fall from their
[1:14:17] master's table
[1:14:18] then jesus entered and said unto her
[1:14:21] o woman great is thy faith be unto thee
[1:14:25] even as thou wilt and her daughter was
[1:14:27] made whole from that very hour
[1:14:34] he didn't go to her house
[1:14:36] he didn't lay hands on her daughter
[1:14:39] all he said
[1:14:41] and think about this it's the word
[1:14:43] saying the word that what have you asked
[1:14:46] for
[1:14:47] will be given to you because of your
[1:14:49] faith
[1:14:50] amen
[1:14:52] next one matthew 8 5-13
[1:14:56] is there a tissue
[1:15:01] side effects of crying
[1:15:07] and when jesus was entered into
[1:15:09] capernaum there came unto him centurion
[1:15:11] as all know this story right
[1:15:13] very famous story
[1:15:15] besieging him is saying lord my servant
[1:15:17] life at home sick of the palsy
[1:15:19] grievously tormented and jesus said unto
[1:15:22] him i will come and heal him so now
[1:15:25] jesus is saying to a gentile i will come
[1:15:27] and heal him
[1:15:28] this is the wonderful part ready watch
[1:15:30] this the century answered and said lord
[1:15:32] i am not worthy that thou should have
[1:15:34] come under my roof but speak the word
[1:15:38] only and my servant shall be healed
[1:15:42] amen keep going right the 13
[1:15:45] for i am a man under authority having
[1:15:47] soldiers under me and i say to this man
[1:15:49] go and goeth and to another come and he
[1:15:51] cometh and to my servant do this and
[1:15:53] he'd do with it
[1:15:56] when jesus heard it he marveled and he
[1:15:58] said to them that follow him verily i
[1:16:00] say unto you i have not found so great
[1:16:02] faith no not in israel and i say unto
[1:16:05] you that many shall come the east from
[1:16:07] the east and from the west and shall sit
[1:16:09] down with abraham and isaac and jacob in
[1:16:11] the kingdom of heaven
[1:16:14] but the children of the kingdom shall be
[1:16:15] cast out in our outer darkness there
[1:16:18] shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
[1:16:21] and jesus said unto the centurion go thy
[1:16:24] way and as thou has believed so it be
[1:16:28] done unto thee and his servant was
[1:16:30] healed in a safe self same hour
[1:16:34] do you want one more
[1:16:36] i'm glad you asked
[1:16:39] didn't ask but i'm gonna say it anyway
[1:16:41] john 4 46-54
[1:16:48] jesus came again into the cana of
[1:16:49] galilee where he had made the water wine
[1:16:54] side note on that
[1:16:56] everyone know that scripture we made
[1:16:57] water into wine
[1:16:59] did he touch the water
[1:17:03] he didn't
[1:17:04] huh interesting
[1:17:06] and there was a certain old man whose
[1:17:08] son was sick at capernaum
[1:17:11] when he heard that jesus was come out of
[1:17:13] judea into galilee he went unto him and
[1:17:15] besought him that he would come down and
[1:17:17] heal his son for he was at the point of
[1:17:19] death
[1:17:21] then said jesus unto him except you see
[1:17:24] signs and wonders you will not believe
[1:17:26] the mon the nobleman said unto him sir
[1:17:28] come down here my child die
[1:17:32] jesus said unto him go thy way thy son
[1:17:35] liveth
[1:17:36] and the man believed the word that jesus
[1:17:38] had spoken unto him and he went his way
[1:17:41] and as he was now going down his
[1:17:43] servants met him and told him saying thy
[1:17:45] son liveth
[1:17:47] of course we're going to ask when then
[1:17:49] inquired he of them the hour when he
[1:17:50] began to amend and they said unto him
[1:17:53] yesterday at the selfsame hour the fever
[1:17:56] left him
[1:17:58] so the father knew that it was at the
[1:18:00] same hour in the which jesus said unto
[1:18:03] him thy son liveth and then himself
[1:18:05] believeth in his whole house
[1:18:09] this is again the second miracle that
[1:18:11] jesus did when he was come out of judea
[1:18:13] into galilee
[1:18:16] he didn't go their houses he didn't lay
[1:18:18] hands on them
[1:18:19] they just believed what they had heard
[1:18:22] about jesus and what he the authority he
[1:18:25] had to be able to speak the word and
[1:18:27] they would recover
[1:18:29] do you know who else did that
[1:18:32] do you know
[1:18:34] who's famous or who's famous
[1:18:36] who's familiar with the three squirrels
[1:18:40] oh i saw some light bulbs go off
[1:18:43] gotta remember that story
[1:18:45] can i share it with you
[1:18:46] this is the last thing
[1:18:50] and he thought well how could it be
[1:18:51] remember he's out in the wilderness he's
[1:18:53] supposed to go meet some other brothers
[1:18:54] for lunch
[1:18:55] but he said how could it be because the
[1:18:57] lord's telling them if thou speak this
[1:18:58] mountain shall be removed and he's
[1:19:00] thinking on that scripture
[1:19:02] lord tells them i thought well how could
[1:19:03] it be he said
[1:19:04] i said he said speak
[1:19:06] and it will be that way don't doubt it
[1:19:10] and i was talking to somebody setting
[1:19:12] way on the woods no squirrels been there
[1:19:14] for three days there's no squirrels
[1:19:16] there and i was sitting in a sycamore
[1:19:17] thicket squirrels don't even come anyone
[1:19:20] that hunt scrolls know they're not in
[1:19:22] sycamore and i had been sitting there
[1:19:24] and wind blowing real hard about the 10
[1:19:26] o'clock in the morning and i was
[1:19:27] thinking again
[1:19:29] and it said you're hunting
[1:19:31] and you need squirrels just the same as
[1:19:33] abraham needed a ram
[1:19:35] i thought
[1:19:37] that's always told me the truth but this
[1:19:40] sounds funny and i got it from there i
[1:19:42] was sitting looked around
[1:19:44] where is that person that was talking to
[1:19:46] me
[1:19:47] nothing wind is blowing real hard and i
[1:19:49] thought
[1:19:50] could i have fell asleep and dreamed
[1:19:52] that no i wasn't asleep i was setting up
[1:19:55] against the tree there watching supposed
[1:19:58] to pick up brother wood and brother
[1:20:00] satman back there just in a little bit
[1:20:02] around 10 o'clock in the morning farmer
[1:20:03] was all out there working gathering corn
[1:20:05] i heard again say you were hunting
[1:20:08] unique game how many do you need
[1:20:12] and i thought now i don't want to overdo
[1:20:14] this
[1:20:15] who's done that
[1:20:17] you need something from god you're like
[1:20:18] lord i just need this much
[1:20:20] sometimes we just remember that we need
[1:20:21] to ask
[1:20:23] for exactly what we need
[1:20:24] because the god that created the heavens
[1:20:26] earth with his fingers and his hands he
[1:20:28] has everything you need of amen
[1:20:33] you're hunting your game how many do you
[1:20:34] need i thought now i don't want to do
[1:20:36] this i'm just going to ask for three
[1:20:38] three squirrels i want young three red
[1:20:40] squirrels i want them
[1:20:42] he said then speak
[1:20:45] about it
[1:20:47] i love it
[1:20:49] and i said i am going to get you three
[1:20:52] young
[1:20:52] i'm going to get three
[1:20:54] three young red squirrels
[1:20:56] he said which way will they come
[1:21:00] really
[1:21:04] so you're asking for three squirrels and
[1:21:06] lord saying well where are they gonna
[1:21:06] come from now he's being very specific
[1:21:08] right what a test of faith that is right
[1:21:10] there well i thought i went this far
[1:21:13] there's something talking to me here
[1:21:15] just the same as you hear me talking and
[1:21:16] god in heaven
[1:21:18] with this bible over my heart knows
[1:21:20] that's the truth and he said i s and he
[1:21:22] said and he and i said well i picked out
[1:21:25] a ridiculous place an old dry limb
[1:21:29] hanging out over there about 50 yards
[1:21:31] where my rifle was shot in i said the
[1:21:33] first one will be right there and there
[1:21:35] he was
[1:21:38] i rubbed my eyes and looked back i
[1:21:41] turned my head and thought i don't want
[1:21:42] to shoot a vision so i looked around the
[1:21:44] game and there set the squirrel i threw
[1:21:46] up through throw it up a throat
[1:21:50] i throwed a shell up in my gun aimed up
[1:21:52] and i could see his black eye
[1:21:55] young red squirrel i thought i might be
[1:21:58] i might be sleeping i'll wake up in a
[1:21:59] few minutes
[1:22:01] see i'm dreaming about this well i
[1:22:03] leveled down shot the squirrel and it
[1:22:05] dropped off the limb i thought well i
[1:22:06] don't know i thought well
[1:22:09] should i go over there and look for it
[1:22:10] and i walked over there and there it
[1:22:12] laid i picked it up and blood ran out of
[1:22:14] it a vision don't bleed you know
[1:22:15] so i picked it up and it was a squirrel
[1:22:18] i got real numb all over
[1:22:20] and i looked around and i said god that
[1:22:22] was you i said thank you for this
[1:22:26] now i'll go out and
[1:22:29] so lord he gave me one squirrel
[1:22:31] i'mma and he knew it was real he thought
[1:22:33] i was sleeping he found out it's a real
[1:22:35] squirrel
[1:22:36] amen he says i'm done
[1:22:39] but here the next part
[1:22:41] he said this is god telling the prophet
[1:22:45] but
[1:22:46] you said
[1:22:48] wow
[1:22:49] do you doubt what you said
[1:22:53] you said you get three
[1:22:56] now where the next one come from
[1:22:58] i thought well if i'm dreaming i'm gonna
[1:23:00] continue on
[1:23:01] so i said i picked up i picked out an
[1:23:03] old post over there
[1:23:05] off a tree that was all wrapped up with
[1:23:06] this here poison ivy
[1:23:08] you never get a squirrel in that so i
[1:23:10] said the next one will come right out of
[1:23:12] that poison ivy and there sat down there
[1:23:15] sat that young red squirrel looking
[1:23:16] right at me
[1:23:17] i set my gun down rub my eyes turn
[1:23:19] around again i thought there he sat
[1:23:22] turned his head sideways i shot the
[1:23:23] squirrel and then i started going home
[1:23:25] not just once but twice he's trying to
[1:23:27] leave
[1:23:29] but here comes the lord here comes god
[1:23:31] saying
[1:23:32] you said three
[1:23:34] do you doubt what you said
[1:23:38] i said no lord i don't doubt what i said
[1:23:41] for your confirming this is the one
[1:23:44] scripture has taught me not if i say but
[1:23:47] if you say
[1:23:48] now if jesus said it but if you say it
[1:23:50] yourself
[1:23:53] wow and i thought somehow i've broken
[1:23:56] into that channel and i know he's here
[1:23:58] because i'm almost beside myself
[1:24:01] i thought
[1:24:03] is it up there now
[1:24:04] this is my favorite line right there 149
[1:24:07] and i thought someone broke into the
[1:24:08] channel and i know it because
[1:24:11] he's here because i'm almost beside
[1:24:12] myself this is my favorite part i
[1:24:14] thought i'll make this one ridiculous
[1:24:18] so god is honoring his word that he
[1:24:21] spoke out and now the prophet is
[1:24:23] challenging the lord saying
[1:24:25] let's see how far god can go which we've
[1:24:28] already testified
[1:24:29] god can do everything
[1:24:31] as long as you believe it
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:35] she says i'll make this one ridiculous
[1:24:36] sure enough
[1:24:39] now i gotta find out my notes
[1:24:43] i said there'll be a red squirrel come
[1:24:45] down off that hill come right down this
[1:24:48] way and right by me and go out and sit
[1:24:51] on that limb
[1:24:52] and look down there at that farmer
[1:24:55] that is very very very specific
[1:24:58] if you said that and that happened
[1:25:00] with testimony right so here he goes
[1:25:04] he came
[1:25:05] down the hill went right out and sat and
[1:25:08] looked at that farmer
[1:25:11] and i shot him
[1:25:12] but of course here comes the devil
[1:25:14] saying said to me you know what the
[1:25:16] woods is just full of them now
[1:25:18] and i sat there till 12 o'clock and not
[1:25:20] another thing happened
[1:25:22] it goes to show that when god he's the
[1:25:26] very creator of the heavens
[1:25:28] and the earth
[1:25:32] so every time i was challenging
[1:25:34] god saying
[1:25:38] if you don't act i'm gonna do this if
[1:25:41] you don't do this i'm gonna do that
[1:25:43] how wonderful is mercy to look past all
[1:25:46] my
[1:25:48] human side i was trying to think of a
[1:25:50] polite
[1:25:51] word but
[1:25:54] so when i give you this testimony
[1:25:56] and i'm wrapping up now
[1:25:58] that's just another testimony saying
[1:25:59] that i have been
[1:26:02] far side
[1:26:03] doesn't matter left or right away from
[1:26:05] where god wanted me at
[1:26:07] and somehow
[1:26:09] not because i'm perry greene's grandson
[1:26:11] not because of the military service i
[1:26:13] did not because i was saving peoples
[1:26:14] around the world not because of anything
[1:26:16] i did
[1:26:18] but
[1:26:19] it was god knew a long time ago that
[1:26:23] there was going to come a point when
[1:26:24] jesse needed him to act
[1:26:28] and when i needed him to act
[1:26:30] he kept faithful to what he said
[1:26:34] so that i can say
[1:26:36] the same jesus christ is the same
[1:26:39] yesterday today and forever
[1:26:43] the same jesus
[1:26:45] that my grandfather saw
[1:26:47] the holy spirit that was in the prophet
[1:26:49] that some of you saw
[1:26:50] is the same god same holy spirit that
[1:26:54] you just sing songs about and did we
[1:26:55] talk before service
[1:26:57] i think you did three immediate songs
[1:26:59] when you came out was about the holy
[1:27:00] spirit wasn't it
[1:27:02] two or three
[1:27:04] i don't take coincidences
[1:27:06] when i'm back there writing these notes
[1:27:08] in my chicken scratch
[1:27:09] and i'm talking about i knew he was
[1:27:11] gonna finish up talking about the holy
[1:27:12] spirit and then this young man comes out
[1:27:14] here and starts singing about the holy
[1:27:15] spirit
[1:27:16] that's not a coincidence to me
[1:27:18] that is god saying no matter where you
[1:27:20] go or testify
[1:27:22] i'm still going to be the same jesus
[1:27:24] that you're relying on every day to stay
[1:27:26] alive
[1:27:31] matthew 18 19 again i'm saying to you
[1:27:33] that if two of you shall agree on earth
[1:27:35] as touching anything that you shall ask
[1:27:38] it shall be done for them of my father
[1:27:41] which is in heaven
[1:27:42] so when we spoke for hadas healing when
[1:27:45] the hospitals didn't know what they were
[1:27:46] doing well i shouldn't say they're doing
[1:27:48] when they didn't know what was going on
[1:27:50] and they had theory after theory and
[1:27:51] everything kept on getting delayed and
[1:27:53] every time we pray saying lord we can't
[1:27:55] wait three months we need to happen now
[1:27:57] we lord we need answers now lord can you
[1:28:00] act on the scene
[1:28:01] appointments guy moved up to two days
[1:28:04] her white blood cells started going up
[1:28:06] but they hadn't done anything yet
[1:28:08] so i knew that when we were speaking her
[1:28:10] health
[1:28:12] when everyone was believing saying lord
[1:28:14] your word said we ask that you'll heal
[1:28:17] her we ask lord that we're in service to
[1:28:20] you
[1:28:21] lord
[1:28:22] be the same god today
[1:28:24] now she's walking around she just drove
[1:28:26] up to prescott she's with my wife my son
[1:28:28] up there having a blast visiting family
[1:28:31] but now we're just cancelling
[1:28:32] appointments because they can't find
[1:28:34] anything wrong with her
[1:28:35] that's a testimony amen
[1:28:43] there is a song i want to sing but i
[1:28:45] think i'm just going to
[1:28:47] turn the servers back over you brother
[1:28:48] but there's that song that says
[1:28:49] something keeps holding me
[1:28:52] now every day when i'm getting battled
[1:28:55] and now that i have spoke this now twice
[1:28:59] i know i'm going to be challenged
[1:29:01] i know the devil is going to come after
[1:29:02] me
[1:29:04] because he's not happy
[1:29:06] that we are so close to going home
[1:29:09] he knows
[1:29:11] so close that he's about to lose
[1:29:13] everything
[1:29:14] that he's going to fight every single
[1:29:16] one of you
[1:29:17] every single one of us doesn't matter
[1:29:18] where you go to church doesn't matter
[1:29:21] your
[1:29:22] longtime believer or short time believer
[1:29:24] like me or i should say short term
[1:29:25] believer six years like me
[1:29:26] he's gonna fight you
[1:29:28] just remind your mind let these words
[1:29:30] soak in
[1:29:31] ask what you will you need god to battle
[1:29:33] this battle for you
[1:29:35] ask it
[1:29:37] it's not going to be too much for god
[1:29:41] so thank you for your time
[1:29:42] i really appreciate and love you all
[1:29:45] i just want to say
[1:29:46] it's been an honor to speak here
[1:29:49] as thank you for the opportunity to go
[1:29:52] so god bless you all
[1:29:54] [Applause]
[1:30:00] [Music]
[1:30:03] something keeps holding me
[1:30:09] something keeps holding me
[1:30:15] every day
[1:30:19] [Music]
[1:30:31] guiding me constantly
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:47] something keeps holding
[1:30:50] me
[1:30:54] and you know what that something is
[1:30:57] that's jesus christ
[1:30:58] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:31:03] and you know
[1:31:07] i just heard just a little portion of it
[1:31:09] i didn't know most of this
[1:31:11] but something in my heart said there's a
[1:31:13] testimony there and this was before
[1:31:16] sister hadas is healing
[1:31:19] there's just something of the change
[1:31:20] that god can make in somebody's life
[1:31:24] you're going 100 miles in that an hour
[1:31:26] that way
[1:31:28] and he'll turn you around
[1:31:30] and he'll bring you back home because
[1:31:31] you're one of his
[1:31:33] and i would say to you brother and
[1:31:35] sister who has a daughter a son a child
[1:31:39] a sister
[1:31:40] a father a mother
[1:31:42] that seems like there's no hope all you
[1:31:45] just heard about a god
[1:31:47] that is the same yesterday today and
[1:31:49] forever and can turn a life
[1:31:52] around
[1:31:53] and bring them back
[1:31:55] you ought to be able to believe right
[1:31:57] now you'd ought to say lord i can speak
[1:32:01] your word
[1:32:02] and you'll bring it to pass
[1:32:05] whatever it is
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:07] he's not a god that has limits
[1:32:10] he's not a god that says well no wait a
[1:32:12] minute i got to research that again is
[1:32:14] that doable
[1:32:15] brother branham tried hard to make it
[1:32:17] hard for god
[1:32:19] god took him and said just speak
[1:32:21] just speak just speak what it'll
[1:32:24] be brothers i'm running your son
[1:32:28] you can speak what you want
[1:32:30] he's still god
[1:32:32] he doesn't change
[1:32:36] whatever it is that you need god for he
[1:32:39] can do it
[1:32:40] if you can believe it
[1:32:43] don't be afraid to confess it don't be
[1:32:44] afraid to speak it
[1:32:47] i know my testimony
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:50] sitting there elk hunting
[1:32:54] and that same voice began to speak to me
[1:32:56] and say you're here for something
[1:32:58] you're here for something and my
[1:33:00] reaction was that was for brother
[1:33:02] branham that was for brother random
[1:33:04] three times i told god
[1:33:06] that was for brother brent
[1:33:09] but i'm glad that he said
[1:33:11] speak what you need
[1:33:12] amen
[1:33:13] and i did the same thing i said up on
[1:33:15] that hill up there
[1:33:17] let it come out let it come down let it
[1:33:20] run right from here and go back
[1:33:23] i turned around and there's the elk
[1:33:26] right on the hill and that's where i
[1:33:27] shot him
[1:33:29] and the other elk that was with him ran
[1:33:30] down and ran right in front turn around
[1:33:32] and ran back
[1:33:34] and it was about two hours later to
[1:33:35] realize exactly what i asked for i got
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:40] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:33:42] forever amen amen
[1:33:45] what do you have need of this statement
[1:33:47] what do you have need of
[1:33:51] oh but that's really not that important
[1:33:53] really then why is it in your heart
[1:33:56] why are you desiring it why are you
[1:33:58] asking for it
[1:34:01] if it's important enough for you to
[1:34:03] desire it to want to draw closer to god
[1:34:05] then it's important enough to ask
[1:34:09] brother joe what is it that you want
[1:34:11] you can ask god and he'll meet you
[1:34:14] he's the same yesterday today and for i
[1:34:17] challenge you to believe it
[1:34:20] you know brother branham said the holy
[1:34:22] spirit spoke to him and said beware of
[1:34:25] these three things
[1:34:27] said women
[1:34:28] popularity and money
[1:34:31] he said that's a trap
[1:34:33] but he never told him you can't ask for
[1:34:35] anything he said just beware of that
[1:34:37] don't go in that direction
[1:34:40] look for that which would profit the
[1:34:41] soul
[1:34:43] him walking through oral roberts of the
[1:34:46] university there and he's looking at it
[1:34:48] and he's saying my you didn't have
[1:34:50] enough confidence in me to give me this
[1:34:54] and he walks out and god says no i gave
[1:34:57] you myself
[1:35:00] he says i am your portion
[1:35:04] which would be better
[1:35:05] which would be the best of it all
[1:35:08] to have god the creator of it all that
[1:35:10] would say speak
[1:35:12] when you have that character you would
[1:35:14] speak nothing a mess
[1:35:17] oh what a mighty god we serve
[1:35:20] could you just believe that right now
[1:35:22] brother bobby rourke was here one time
[1:35:24] [Music]

[1:35:33] saliva in her throat
[1:35:35] and brother bobby spoke to her

[1:35:41] drowning me
[1:35:43] the saliva

[1:35:46] stand up on there and that part that
[1:35:48] hurts you move and talk to god i was
[1:35:50] standing about where sister barbie

[1:37:59] times already to know that when god
[1:38:01] spoke when jesus spoke it happened amen
[1:38:05] and she just said just do
[1:38:07] what he tells you
