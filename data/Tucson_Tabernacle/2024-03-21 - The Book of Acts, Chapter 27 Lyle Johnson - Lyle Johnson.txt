share I had the children the youngest Sunday school class and sister Angela had said she had this little project to teach the children about prayer and that was such a wonderful subject for me I got to thinking about how that really everyone said prayer is the greatest Force there is on Earth it's greater than any paraphrasing greater than any atomic bomb there is and I thought it's because he's the one that created the universe and I was like he's my God and he and he and I was pondering over that and I went to read the Bible because you know what are Christians supposed to do because we love to read the word of God and I opened up the Bible and it said I stretched forth the heavens and I laid the foundations of the Earth and it really blessed me I really praised the Lord for his goodness [Music] and all these things shall be added to you Hallelujah [Music] man shall not live by Red alone [Music] from the mouth of God [Music] ask and it shall be given unto you seeking can keep

[Music] pray I hope to meet you there blessed Jesus amen do you want him to hold your hand hey man if I could just grab a hold of his hand I know everything would be okay I remember walking the kids when they were little walking them outside of wherever it was and as long as me as a father as long as that whole had a hold of that little hand I knew that they couldn't fall I knew that nothing could ever happen to him and I'm that little baby that wants to grab a hold of that hand that unfailing hand um brother Stephen we heal brother Aaron's son-in-law we prayed for a friend of his last week with pneumonia and he writes that a man is doing much better and he's possibly coming home from the hospital tomorrow to thank the Lord for that brother Aaron writes that his boss brother Danny a man named Danny Silvis he uh they thought he had a stroke and it looks like he was diagnosed with Bell's palsy so he asked for prayer for this man sister Carol linhardt she writes please pray for my brother he is having extreme pain again and this time he's transferred from rehab to TMC so let's pray for sister Carol her brother there which is which brother is that Brother David okay and um another prayer request sister Nina but Aaron's daughter she has a co-worker's grandson I believe I got it right he's two weeks old and he's losing weight he's vomiting and he's in the hospital so let's pray for the little baby and that the Lord would touch him and brother Kevin Carey texted me he says this he says pray for me he says I'm having parents sentences done on Friday and he asked prayer that everything will go all right and I believe it will you know Sister Hope's song there let's put some scriptures together it's uh just beautiful that ask and it shall be given seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened to you so we know that if we pray and if we ask the Lord and we do it with faith that it's not according to anything other than he made a promise that we can have what we ask for and sister Cheryl also asked sister Cheryl if you'd come forward sister Cheryl also asked that we would anoint her with oil In The Name Of The Lord that she might be healed if she's been struggling with pneumonia having trouble breathing and it's just it's been really hard on her so brother Jonathan if you could come down with me with a microphone we do this according to the word of God according to the Book of James it says for the elders to anoint the sick with oil and to pray for them and that they shall be healed that's a good enough promise for me and I was telling sister Cheryl before service that I've been I've been amazed at how many people have come to be Anointed with oil over the past few months and that have been healed and just going through this as anointing with oil according to what God ordained through his servant Pastor James the Bible sister Cheryl the soil it represents the Holy Spirit and we do this as a commandment it's not the Holy Spirit but it's what it represents and when I anoint you with oil the Bible teaches us to whatever you do in word or D do all in the name of the Lord Jesus so brother Jonathan you could hold this [Music] Gerald I anoint you according to the word of God the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I lay my hands on you brother Jonathan father it is a great honor that we can read this Bible and see that you have given us these instructions on how to be how to be healed father we bring sister Cheryl before you in the name of Jesus Christ and claim her healing because now we have done what has been instructed to us to do now we have done it now Lord we lay it into your hands and ask for her complete healing in Jesus Christ's name and father for these other requests with the baby and and Lord the other ones that knowing that the almighty God knows these people and knows who they are Lord you know where they are now father we also pray for them that they would be healed and Lord that you would be glorified and father we thank you we know that our time is limited on Earth as we grow older we get sick and and we die and father we we move on to another place but while we're here we thank you that we can have our healing and Lord that you have given us these things and promised us these things that we can pray for others and they can be healed and father that we can come forward and we can be healed we thank you Lord we claim these healings in the name of the son of God Jesus Christ [Music] tonight we have a great blessing once again to open up this Bible the book of Acts and read what God did two thousand years ago through people that had faith and as I read through this book I just thank God that it never ended it has just continued on to this day in the same holy spirit that was with the apostle that we will hear about tonight is the same holy spirit that is with us today he said I am God and I change not if he was a Healer way back four or five thousand years ago he was a Healer 2000 years ago and he's a Healer tonight [Music] I appreciate her brother Lyle appreciate the work that he does that all of his labors and all of his efforts that we can benefit from them and we can understand this book a little bit better brother Jonathan if you have one more song while our brother comes I wish I was Slender my feet I know the master of that we I know the maker of the rain he can calm the storms make the sun to shine again my Lord I know the master of the way oh I know the master of the we I know my Lord [Music] he can calm the storms may make the sun to shine again [Music] one more time Hallelujah oh oh I know the master of the Wind I know the maker of the rain he can call me stars one more time as we raise our hands together Church [Music] I know the maker of the rain [Music] he can calm the storms make the sun to shine again [Music] thank you thank you good evening God bless you thank you for being here that song is just I think a wonderful lead-in to what we're going to be reading and studying about tonight in Acts 27. uh it's kind of sad not so much for what the chapter contains but realizing that we're coming to the end of our study of Acts I found strength and joy working on this and sharing but I'm confident the Lord has more Bible study for us laying ahead to learn and share together if you have ideas for topics or books that you'd like to pursue please let your pastor know this chapter 27 is a swashbuckling Maritime Adventure transporting the Roman prisoner Paul along with some of his friends from caesarea to Rome except they don't make it they don't get to Rome that's the Final Chapter next week before we open our Bibles and read Luke's account of these experiences let's pray together to the one that inspired him Lord it is such a privilege it's an honor it's a challenge but Lord it is just so wonderful to be gathered together with precious sisters and brothers young and old Lord that have a desire to draw closer to you to learn more of your word and Lord not to learn in our head Lord but to have that life in our heart Lord that can flow out and strengthen and help others Lord I pray that you'd help me to lay aside the the the the the the thoughts the cares of this world each one of us Lord forgive us Lord where we fall short where we miss the mark Lord and help us Lord draw us all closer together and to you to one another we thank you in Jesus precious name amen recall from chapters 24 through 26 that the Roman officials which hold trials and pass judgment in this case two different Governors and a king is an advisor each realized Paul is innocent but none will release him they're playing a delicate political game with the religious leaders of The Devout Judean population majority passions are strong there's rebellion in the air the Roman authorities want to prevent an uprising so try to appease the Jewish population to the extent they can while watching out for their own self-interest pox Romana the piece of Rome Paul's frustrated with what he sees as their hypocrisy and he may have other motives as well and a search is right as a Roman citizen to appeal his case for judgment in Rome I appeal to Caesar he said let's read the closing verses of chapter 26 to set the Tate set the stage for tonight's study and when he Paul had thus spoken sharing his testimony in the court the audience including many if not most of the high-ranking officials and the Roman Capital there of caesarea over the province of Judea the king and that's the grip of the second rose up and the governor fellow named Festus who had recently come to the governorship and Bernice the King's sister and they that sat with them they gathered Nobles and officials of the administration in caesarea and when they were gone aside out of the Court chambers that they that's Festus Agrippa Burness talked between themselves saying oh this man there was nothing worthy of death or for that matter even of bonds why is he even here then Agrippa said unto Festus this man might have been said at Liberty if he had not appealed unto Caesar hmm might have been please take your seats Festus could have easily offered him his choice of Freedom or Caesar simply dismissing his case declaring him innocent but Paul's appeal gives Festus an out and a very tense political atmosphere if you recall however the purpose of the hearing of Paul speaking in chapter 26 was to help Festus figure out would you charge Paul with before he sent him off to Rome seems like I should but these lists why I'm sending him we're not told What charges it is that Festus finally settled on but the scene is now set Paul will be sent to Rome for trial it's now late summer I believe the year is 60 A.D at this point the weather is acceptable for sailing west from caesarea to Italy sailing's faster more directly less expensive and less risky than marching over land which would include crossing the mountainous terrain of the Balkans so the decision is made and now we go to acts 27 and verse 1. and when it was determined and here doesn't mean when they finally made up their mind but it but the when is when the time came it had been determined so the time came that we so Luke has now indicated his presence with Paul in the narrative we'll talk a bit about that later determine that we should sail in Italy they the Roman authorities in caesarea delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius a centurion of Augustus band the Emperor Augustus is long dead this this is a regimental name it's some translations say the Imperial regiment the emperor's regiment the Augustine regiment just like when I was in the Army I served in the 101st Airborne that was just the name of the thing there weren't 101 of us entering into a ship of or from adramitium in other words the ship was registered in her owned by someone from the city of adromedium it's a bit south of troas sure you all have that pictured clearly in your mind we launched from the port of caesarea meaning to Sail by the ports along the coasts of Asia Southern turkey in today's world one aristarchus a Macedonian or thessalonica being with us accompanying us Luke doesn't tell us how many of Paul's friends and companions are traveling with him but he's careful to name this man aristarchus and even where he is from his address if you will well let's flash back about three years to Ephesus near the end of Paul's three-year Ministry there recall there was a riot instigated by Demetrius and the silversmiths I see Demetrius sitting on the front row and the whole city of Ephesus was filled with confusion and having caught Gaius and aristarchus Men of Macedonia Paul's Companions and travel they rushed with one Accord into the theater so at some point while Paul was ministering in Ephesus aristarchus had traveled from thessalonica in Macedonia northern Greece we'd think of it today over to where Paul was on this port city in the coast of what is modern day turkey and he was working with perhaps he'd accompany Paul to Antioch perhaps he heard Paul was an Ephesus and wanted to come and help we don't know when he joined up with Paul only that by this time in Ephesus aristarchus was with Paul well after Paul left Ephesus he traveled to Troast to Philippi thessalonica and so forth on his way to Corinth when he learned there was going to be an ambush there if he took a ship to Judea he retraced the steps Overland back through Macedonia and on to troas and and Acts 20 we read and there accompanied him from Philippi into troa support City in Asia what we think of as Western turkey sopater of Berea and of the Thessalonians or a starkas and secundus and gas of Derby and timothius and of Asia tikius and trophymus so we see here that aristarchus who had been with Paul and Ephesus accompanied Paul to Corinth and then back to Asia on the journey to Jerusalem along with Luke and the others well after Paul was apprehended and trundled off to caesarea while Felix was governor we read in Acts 24 verse 23 that he Felix commanded a centurion to keep to Guard Paul to let him have Liberty that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him so clearly there were some people that wanted to spend a little time with Paul and be with him while he was in bonds there well based on what we're reading in Acts 27 it appears that both Luke and aristarchus went to caesarea were among the acquaintances that came to administer to Paul during his captivity it's likely some of the others listed were also there at least for a while now some two years have elapsed we don't have instant Communications two years of elapsing we see these two Faithful Friends accompanying Paul on his journey to Rome it's incumbent on the Empire of course to provide Paul transport to Rome Luke and Ours tarkus are responsible for their own expenses travel lodging food this isn't a cheap internet fair and frencher Airlines it's a lengthy expensive uncomfortable and dangerous Journey later while Paul is in prison in Rome he'll write several letters Colossians and Philemon are among the first of the letters that he writes and they're sent together by trusted couriers one is a general letter to the church at colossae and to be shared with the church in laodicea the other is a personal letter to find an Iman on behalf of one of the couriers an escaped slave named onesimus at this time early in his period of detention in Rome Lucas still with him we read in the list of greetings at the end of Colossians Colossians 4 14 Paul writes Luke the Beloved Physician and Demas greet you at the end of the short letter to Philemon Paul mentions others that are with him at this time early in his time there in Rome Marcus Aris tarkas Demas Lucas my fellow laborers so not only is Luke his dear and faithful friend but aristarchus is still by his side at work to spread the gospel to assist Paul a fellow laborer in both these letters he mentions a fellow believer in labor in the ministry a fellow named Demas sadly later and the final chapter of his very last epistle Demus will have left Paul when Paul will lament his own lonely State as he faces execution he writes to Timothy in second Timothy 4. do thy diligence to come shortly to me Demas hath forsaken me he's left me having loved this present world and is departed into thessalonica crescents to galatia Titus unto Dalmatia only Luke is with me take Mark bring him with thee he's profitable to me for the ministry only Luke is with me in one sense it's so sad that only Luke is still there with Paul but in another sense that this physician has stuck with Paul through so many years of hardship Solomon tells us in Proverbs 18 24 that there's a friend that sits closer than her brother Luke was just such a friend to Paul there's one other mention that includes aristarchus and which speaks volumes to me also found in Colossians 4 verse 10. here he says aristarchist my fellow prisoner salutes greets you and Marcus sister son to Barnabas sounds like a nephew some translation say cousin touching concerning or about whom you receive Commandments or instructions if you come to receive them here again we see aristarchus here Paul calls him a fellow prisoner it's not a prisoner of Rome he's a prisoner of Jesus Christ well please note at this time so many years after their dispute over John Mark Paul is still associating and identifying himself with Barnabas here he mentions that Barnabas relative Marcus is with the Massachusetts to receive him if he comes in these simple lists of greetings I think there's truth that we can find that we can apply to our lives today it's supposed to be certifax get back to acts 27 while okay they've just boarded the ship they've loosed from caesarea and the next day we touched it sidon this is on the coast of modern day Lebanon it's about 78 miles due north of caesarea and Julius the Centurion guarding the prisoners courteously untreated Paul and gave him Liberty to go ashore unto his friends to refresh himself and when after we returned to the ship we had launched from fence from sidon we sailed under Cyprus that means on the leeward side if the wind is blowing you have the windward side and you have the leeward side where the wind is uh attenuated someone by the by the land mass so they're on the leeward side using the island as a shield from the winds why because the winds were contrary it wasn't exactly going in their Direction and when we had sailed Over the Sea of selicia in pamphilia this tells us that they were sailing north of Cyprus we came to Myra a city of lycea and there in Myra Julius the Centurion found a ship of from Alexandria which was sailing into Italy and since that's where we wanted to go he put us on it so here on this map those of you sitting in the back you're really supposed to sit really close to the front see but but anyway you can squint or bring binoculars next time but anyway uh up here is this place adromedium where this ship came from here's caesarea where they're leaving they stop in sidon and then the winds aren't helping and they come along this way and find they make it to this little place over here so so it makes you wonder a little bit about what these ships might be like this is an image from a coin that commemorates the Roman Harbor it's showing various types of ships how the sails were furled for example here or if the sales let out like you see here um and this was under the reign of mirror this coin is from 62 A.D so this coin was minted and put into circulation while Paul was in prison in Rome the merchant ship's cargo capacity and that time varied from about 70 up to 600 tons for the largest ships most ships had a cargo capacity of 100 to 150 tons here's a model of such a ship you can see that it has it has a Mainsail it's a square sail it's not like modern sales and it has a for sale and this particular one has two Rudders there's no wheelhouse per se you got some hopefully strong guys that are hanging on to the thing they're trying to steer the ship as well as by using the tackle with the sail there's no Keel for it to work against but the ship does have a definite draft it's it it's not a flat bottom boat that's easily maneuverable and very unstable it's much more stable designed to go into ports not to land on beaches or anything and this little illustration out here gives you an idea the size of a typical ship compared to like a modern city bus or your car and of course if you can see little tiny dot here well I don't look at it Lyle right under the tube that's a person give you an idea of the the size of this stuff okay um I found a website I don't know that it's 100 accurate but it made these claims about this sort of thing said there were no passenger ships per se in first century Rome no luxury Cruise Lines or anything similar people willing to travel by ship had to board a merchant ship there were no passenger liners they would first have to find a ship could be almost any kind of ship then they'd have to get the captain's approval the price would be negotiated with the captain most of the times passengers would bring their own food supplies covers mattresses even a tent to sleep on Deck sometimes there'd be hundreds of people on the deck there were no restaurants or any of the luxuries the today ships passengers could use the ships facilities to cook their meals and you can see that on this ship there's just there's no shade there's no air conditioning there's no ensuite there's no toilets and you've got a lot of people crowded on the deck no heaters no air conditioners um the uh I look at something like this and I remember several years ago probably it's been 25 or 30 years now back when I worked for the company that you're working for brother um I was in London England and I had to get to Sydney Australia so I got on a non-stop from from London to Los Angeles about 12 hours and about a four hour layover and then a 16-hour flight down to Sydney Australia and I was sitting there by the time I got to LAX feeling a little bit sorry for myself that I have to and I have to endure sitting in this air-conditioned safe stable tube with meals being served to me in a large comfortable seat for almost a day and a half to travel more than halfway around the world and I got to thinking a little bit was I was feeling sorry for myself I thought about what about those people back I was not thinking back in these days I was thinking back in uh you know the days of wooden sailing ships 1600 17 1800s whether it took days and days to cross the ocean and and very uh less comfortable than I was in a 747 going from London to uh London to Sydney I had no idea how tough a Germany Paul's would have been but oh speaking of Paul let's get back to Paul acts 27 7. when we had sail slowly many days and scarce will come over against canitis it's a small island off the southwest of modern turkey just north of roads in that Rocky at jnc that we've talked about before the wind not suffering us the wind wasn't going our way we sailed under right we know that's the leeward side of Crete over against salmon and hardly passing it we came to a place which is called the fair Havens and I were unto is a city of Lucia and and that's where they docked so here we see that path they made from Myra here snaking their way through these islands there's that canitus roads is obviously a bit more visible here and they came down to Crete and they came to this place right in this little southern tip of Creek Fair Haven and that city of uh Lucia was was very nearby now it says when much time was spent so they I don't know if that means that they were in that City for a long time I don't know Sailors on Shore leave when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was already passed the fast he's talking about Yom Kippur the day of atonement in the year 60 A.D that fell in the 24th of September for us it was just last week September 24 and 25 so it was exactly this time of year Early Autumn the weather starting to get unstable in the Eastern Mediterranean for a Westward sailing in fact commercial navigation in the Mediterranean was suspended during the four winter months this was known as the moderate Clausen yeah but I got Google Translate to read the Latin to me that's mare Clausen that's Latin for closed C in other words don't get on the water so because the fast was now already passed Paul admonished them he said unto them sirs sirs I perceive that this Voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading the the cargo and ship but also of Our Lives Paul may have had a sense of foreboding that caused him to make this comment but it's not a prophecy per se could be as simple as moderate closum and Paul's previous experience it was being Shipwrecked in the ajayan multiple times Luke tells us in this verse that it was due to the season this because the fast was already passed that's why Paul made this statement okay that plays into another statement he makes in a bit verse 11 nevertheless Julius the Centurion believed the master and owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul this should not be a surprise the shipmaster owner he was a sailor and he had a lot at risk Paul wasn't a seaman he was a passenger and besides that he was under guard criminal accused criminal being transported for trial so because the Haven which were more the city of lacia was not commodious to Winter in the Sailors would prefer to be somewhere else the more part the majority of the ships grew advised to depart fence also if by any means they might attain to Venus or Phoenix and there to Winter which is in Haven of Crete and lieth towards the Southwest it's the southwest of the island of Crete and Northwest Northwest of their current location so we see the ship's owner and crew weren't intending to go very far a short day's sailing distance they hold up the risk was small they were waiting for a favorable wind Sarah we can see that they were going to depart from down here at the bottom Lacey and just go over here to Phoenix it's just about 50 miles it's not very far it's only going to take him a few hours they wanted to winter at this place it's a larger City we'll find out later that there were 276 people on board this boat as well as the cargo yeah you think while if the weather was an issue they wanted to go 50 miles they could have left a small crew to guard the boat and stuff and everybody else could have just walked but at 50 miles two days if you're in decent Health back in those days people tended to walk a lot but that's not what they did and when the south wind blew softly that is a wind from the south so it's a Gentle Wind coming from the south and they're wanting to go North and and and West so that's perfect it blew softly the ship screw supposing they had obtained their purpose loosing fence in other words they left the port of lysia and they sailed close by Crete they say close to the shore oh nice beautiful soft Breeze yeah oh this is good but not long after there arose against a trumpetuous wind called Earl Clayton Earl Clayton simply means Northwest it's a norwester we'd say in modern terms so there were rows this tempestuous wind and it burst across the island and the ship when the ship was caught in this powerful storm and could not bear up and that means they couldn't Steward into the wind they couldn't fight it it was too strong we let her drive before the wind we tells us the crew had enlisted help from the passengers including Luke Paul aristarchus and running under again on the leeward side away from the island between a certain small island between them and the source of the wind the island called clauda we again the passengers apparently were again called upon to help had much work to come by the boat come by the boat what it's talking about here is we hardly manage with strenuous effort to get control of and make secure the ship's lifeboat so they had a small boat big enough for the crew not big enough for 276 people they fast forward to the Titanic and you get an idea what's going on which when they the crew had taken up had they'd hoisted this Lifeboat aboard they used helps under girding the ship so they got ropes and they wrapped it around the belly of the ship and tied it to help make things tight this is a bad storm there there have temporary slight relief they're still fighting things because they're near that other little Island and the next day the crew lightened the ship in other words they started throwing things overboard the non-essentials judging the cargo the third day oops I'm sorry I got ahead of myself shame on me they take it up they fearing less they should fall into the quicksands at sand bars near the shore of this little island this this ship requires a port you can't just pull it up on the beach so it says that they strike sail they lowered the sale and so we're driven before the wind no ability to steer or otherwise direct the ship so here you can see they're wanting to go from Lucia to Phoenix they wind up south of this island of Cloudera and this big nasty storm is blowing all that wind exactly where they don't want it and we being exceedingly tossed with the Tempest the next day they lightened the ship they started throwing things overboard jettisoning the cargo and the third day we sounds like the passengers are involved again cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship ropes and pulleys and so forth much of the sailing gear they're very desperate and when neither Sun nor stars and many days appeared and no small Tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away all hope of survival was gone everybody lost hope all hope Paul Luke aristarchus the crew remember his warning back in verse 10 was based on the time of the year he said sirs I perceive this Voyage will be with herd in much damage not only of the lading and the ship but also of Our Lives so Paul fought if you go at this time people are going to die and now they've reached that point where all hope is lost but after long abstinence after they'd gone a long time without eating Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs you should have hearkened unto me and not loose from Creed and have gained this harm and loss we see a little bit of Paul's nature here I told you so and now I exhort I encourage I urge I advise you be of good cheer keep up your courage I have an update for you there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship we're going to lose the ship we've already lost the cargo we're going to lose the ship but we're all going to be okay No One's Gonna Die before that was Paul speaking about the time of year now he has another reason and he tells us that reason for there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God hath given thee all them a-l-l all them that sail with thee if all hope was lost it's the same all all that sail with thee wherefore serves be of good cheer take heart I believe God it shall be even as it was told me albeit we must be cast we must be wrecked on a certain islands of some Island but when the 14th night was come two weeks the 14th night was come we were driven up and down in adri that's Adriatic Sea that's the water between Italy and Greece The Tempest apparently was more like a cyclone if they were going up and down I don't think they mean like this about midnight the shipment deemed that they drew near to some country some land they thought they were approaching land probably due to the behavior of the waves and the sea is the Tempest as the water becomes shallower and the waves become more violent and sounded and found it twenty thousands what does sounded mean well it's not a fish finder like you would find in modern votes they didn't have such technology back in the first century what they had ah and then they had knots in the rope and as they let that down they'd count the knots and that would tell them how how far it had gone down and and in this case the 120 fathoms is a translation now in modern stuff modern day a fathom is six feet but what the Greek word really means is the distance of outstretched arms well people were a little smaller mostly in those days so I'm guessing maybe it's closer to five feet instead of six feet but there were there were they were 120 fathoms so that would suggest that they were between 90 and 120 feet deep excuse me and when they had gone a little further they sounded again I I don't need to do that again right my back my back is bothering me a little bit and founded 15 fathoms oh it's shallower now 75 to 90 feet well the ship has a deep draft right draft means how deep it goes into the water that's why they threw all that stuff out to make it float higher and and on on the water so then fearing unless we should have fallen upon rocks it's midnight they don't have a big bright light that they can turn on and see what's going on out there they just know that they're approaching some land they have no idea where they are they've been blown about in a storm for two weeks they don't have compasses they don't have they haven't been able to see the stars even to figure things out so they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day certainly they were wishing for the day and just gives you an idea what anchors look like in those days these are Roman anchors from about that time some of them are made of of of iron some of them were made of stone actually they're quite heavy this happens to be in a Maritime Museum on the island of Malta where this photograph is from so now we read verse 30. there's a little bit of Nefarious planning going on here as the shipment the crew were about to flee out of the ship some of these guys were going to abandon ship they wanted to escape when they let down the boat in other words they'd lowered the Lifeboat into the Sea Under color as though in other words pretending like this was really attending that they were going to drop anchors off the front that they would have cast out anchors out of the four ships so these guys are preparing to abandon ship they knew that's where wasn't what they were supposed to do but they thought they had a better chance on the Lifeboat and who better to be in the Lifeboat than those guys so that's what they were going to do Paul saw what was going on and he said to juliusa Century into the soldiers except these abide in the ship you can't be saved if these guys Escape you're dead that's what he's saying well why would he say something like that like that why would he say something like that the analogy that I draw is brother Brandon would have a vision of something and he'd wait until everything lined up with what he'd seen in the vision and then he'd act I I think of the story of uh of um Ed biscal with a red check green checkered shirt and brother random is with Bud Southwick and and they're going back to some caribou and all of a sudden it's big silver trip Grizzly Rises up and brother random one shot and Bud's telling them as a tough guy you'd better take a few more shots and that said no the green checkered shirt the vision it took one shot you had it's still coming brother it's still finally fell with their feet dead so Paul is saying the vision that I had with the angel told me is we'll all be saved if these guys slip out it's broken and if that happens who knows what's going to happen because we're in a very dangerous situation so we read then the soldiers that the Centurion commanded the soldiers overcame the sailors and caught off the ropes of the boat it was being lowered and let the boat fall off into the sea and Drift Away oh and while the day was coming on Before Sunrise Paul besought them all to take meat that's that's grain that's food saying this day is the 14th day that you have carried that you've been in suspense constantly watching always on the alert and continued fasting haven't taken having eaten nothing wherefore I pray you I urge you take some meat eat something this is for your health to survive for there shall not and hair fall from the head of any of you and when are you thus spoken he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all and when he had broken it he began to eat then they were all of good cheer they were encouraged their courage was restored they also took some food began to eat and we were in all the ship 200 threescore and 16 Souls 276 people and when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship and cast out the wheat the remaining grain into the sea again it's to minimize the draft they want to get this thing as light as they can because there's probably no Port where they're headed they don't know where they are and if they've got to beach the boat they don't want it to be deep in the water they want it to be as high and the water as light as they can make it so they lightened the Ship cast everything you see and when it was day they knew not the land they didn't recognize the place they had no idea where they were the batteries were dead in their Garmin GPS they they just that didn't have any Maps they couldn't figure it out didn't even have compass in those days but they discovered they saw a certain Creek with the shore a small Bay with a beach into the which they were minded if possible to thrust in the ship they were going to run Underground on that beach that looked like the safest place to to put the ship and what they had taken up the anchors now that that sounds strange this is King James Jacobian English okay other translations say when they'd severed the ropes and let the anchors in to see but here it says they taken up the anchors and it's of the 20 or 30 translations I looked at it's only the King James that says taken up the Greek is to remove all around so they had removed the anchors they were trying to make the ship as light as possible dragging four heavy anchors back into the boat after you threw out your food I think I'd rather eat than carry around some anchors so it just makes sense if they they cut those things loose anyway they committed themselves Under the Sea they loosed the rubber bands not rubber bands Rudder they they had the Rudders tied to try and keep things steady so now they loosen that so they could attempt to steer the ship they loose the rudder bands and they hoisted up the Mainsail to the wind and made toward the shore so this is a route that they've taken approximately from lycea they've been blown around by this big wind and eventually they've arrived at this island they didn't know that it was Malta it's a straight line distance of 600 miles they've been blowing around on a stone for two weeks and falling into a place where two Seas two currents met they ran the ship aground and the four part the front of the ship stuck fast and remained unmovable that jammed into that Beach but the Hydra part was broken with the violence of the Waves this isn't good sailing weather this is still a storm and it's strong enough that it's ripping the ship apart remained unmovable the Hydra part was broken with the violence of the waves so this is a satellite view and then a another view you can see a little uh let's see if there you go there's a little Monument to Paul and this is called Saint Paul's Bay on Malta where they believe that this activity took place this would be somewhere near here is the beach where they ran aground so now the ship is stuck it's falling apart and uh we've got a problem the soldiers Council these guys were talking among themselves they said we got to kill the prisoners can't let anybody swim out or an escape the soldiers were accountable to bring the prisoners to trial better that they should die there are consequences if they escape yeah the prisoners we had to kill them because they were going to escape oh well we'll cut your pay in half the prisoners escaped uh you're not going to like what happens next remember the Philippian Jailer he was going to commit suicide when he thought the prisoners might have escaped after the earthquake so apparently the punishment to a guard who fails to guard is not pleasant but the Centurion the spell to Julius being in charge and wanting to save Paul willing to save Paul he kept them from their purpose commanded that they which could swim should cast himself first into the sea and get to land now there could be something at work here remember that Paul said if those guys go in the Lifeboat people are going to die so the soldiers cut the Lifeboat loose Julius is thinking of Paul but he could also be thinking of himself and because now if they start killing prisoners well that again breaks the vision if you will and who knows what's going to happen the ship is being torn apart Still In This Storm Commander they wish could swim should cast themselves first into the sea to get to land and the rest some on boards some unbroken pieces of the ship and so it came to pass they all escaped safe to land just as followed prophesied after the angel visitation and once safely unsure we found out that we're now in chapter 28. did that again sorry Daniel I did that again brother Daniel will tell you about chapter 28 Sunday night I believe the final the final chapter of Acts but there's a couple things I'd like to share with you about this it's not just a swashbuckling Adventure we often think maybe usually think that acts as a story primarily of Peter and then of Paul and it is that certainly but there's more there's another layer that we simultaneously acknowledge an overlook I'm speaking to myself that's what I do recall in Acts 26 Paul was presenting his testimony of his life and conversion to accepting Jesus Christ as God in flesh acts 27 is part of Luke's testimony it isn't how we came to Faith in Jesus Christ but his testimony showing God's faithfulness toward his children it's the first person narrative whenever he refers to someone else are they it's often from the perspective of an observer who is present an eyewitness account these are personal experiences Luke is not presenting Doctrine he's not trying to convince us the meaning of some portion of scripture he's not trying to persuade us to his point of view he's simply stating things as he saw and experience them now unlike his gospel account in much of the acts Luke's was there and not just there observing and recording but there is an active participant so much of Acts Luke is sharing his experiences is what we call testifying that's what happens Sunday night certainly Luke has bias as do I as do you I remember a fellow that I worked for was uh pretty much an atheist and we disagreed about some things and finally I I said to him I said Wayne I respect what you're saying but as a person of faith I choose to see it this way and so he respected that there wasn't any fights or arguments after that and when things would come up from time to time I'd say as a person of faith I see it this way so there's biases that we have here some parts of Luke's testimony are exciting catching our attention action passion danger Deliverance some parts seem boring like Paul was in prison for two years the blank space we spoke about two weeks ago but all this is essential parts of this brief time that we experience life on Earth throughout Acts we have seen how Luke was often with Paul he stayed with Paul from the latter part of the third missionary journey Acts 20 verse 6 tells us Luke was with him at Philippi they were celebrating Passover there he may have been with him weeks or months earlier we don't know he stayed with them until Paul's execution in Rome that's a period of at least five years a period of hardship Danger while Paul languished for two years in prison in caesarea Luke was there while Paul is a prisoner being transported to Rome Luke was there when Paul was imprisoned his Rome possibly as long as four years Luke was there at the very last when Paul Panda's final epistle only Luke was there brother Branham said in present stage of my Ministry you talked a little bit about this I said now we know when they seen this doctor following him or with him and Paul took Luke who said he said here Luke's the only one hadn't forsaken looks good to him but Luke is prospers to him he needs him for his ministry this doctor following a man around wherever he went and preached Divine Healing here brother Branham is telling how faithful Luke was how others criticized him for dragging a doctor around with him while proclaiming God is the Healer I mentioned last week about the vital a couple times ago about the vital role of the unnamed nephew Paul that he was just a young boy and what Treasures would have lost if he had not stepped up at that critical moment think about what would be missing in the New Testament if Luke had not recorded the acts or written his gospel account we'd still have three gospels but Luke got so much information not included in the other three remember who was Luke's audience for Acts Theophilus a person who had been taught faith in Jesus Christ The Gospel account is based on eyewitness accounts which Luke investigated and Luke one it starts out this is from the NIV many have undertaken to drop and account of the things that have been fulfilled Among Us just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and not just Witnesses but also Servants of the word with this in mind since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning I too decided to write an orderly account for you most excellent Theophilus why so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught Luke wasn't there during that time it was an investigation but following this axes Luke acts as Luke's own often personal eyewitness account of the spreading of the Gospel which Theophilus had been taught acts opens up again from the NIV and my former book Theophilus I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach until the day he was taken up to heaven after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen and those instructions are in verse 8. you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be my Witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria to the ends of the Earth and that's Acts highlights of the process by which the prophecy recorded in Acts 1 8 was fulfilled acts probably was written early in the mid 60s A.D before Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 and probably before the beginning of the Revolt did I say that too fast probably before the beginning of the Revolt in 66 A.D jumping forward to our day I'm sure many of you remember our brother Al Peterson if you ever had a conversation with him that exceeded three minutes and I maintain it was impossible to have a conversation with other Isle of less than three minutes he would have told you about brother branham's discernment regarding his wife sister Minnie being in the prayer line recorded in the message Dr Moses preached in Chicago on January 14 1955. the day before January 13th brother Brandon preached a message titled the fundamental foundation for faith I want to play you a short excerpt at the very end of that recording just under two minutes and then I have some comments that tie back to the book of Acts if you could play that brother our heavenly father speaking something [Music] keeps coming before the exception of our city and the city is in a valley [Music] it moves now coming to the corner it's a woman and she's taken by loved ones to uh it's a clinical male brother planning and the woman comes from Michigan they take her in for an examination but they can't find out what's the matter with her it's a brain disease someone in here sitting in here somewhere it's a woman that's very heavy and see oh we're bound God bless you ladies laying on the bed with you thank you [Applause] [Music] I could have my slides back there we are thank you the woman brother Branham mentions after he was miraculous healing you hear the entire audience erupt she literally flies off the stretcher is Sister Grace evilly her testimony of this healing in the background of it is contained in the final two pages of the booklet the 11th Commandment that brother Brandon's campaign had printed and distributed for many years at the end of the testimony the last item in the booklet is her name Mrs Wesley evilly and her address in Saint Ignace Michigan that was 1953 January in early 1973 January exactly 20 years after her healing she came to Tucson she stayed in our home at the time I was in the Army undergoing basic combat training but sister Grace Everly and Heather spent several days together here in Tucson sister Ely told Heather that she never sold the house and moved even after her husband died why because her address was in the book she wanted to be able to confirm her testimony to anyone who asked the musicians would please come my tie-in with this testimony to acts is simply this I I think I'm not a revelation it's not anything other than just thinking about this Luke gave some names and locations of people that he knew were still alive when he sent this manuscript to Theophilus Theophilus would then know where to find Rhoda the house slave Simon the Tanner Dorcas the seamstress aristarchus the helper Lydia the merchant if he wanted to confirm the testimonies contained in the book of Acts I think that's why some of these people that are only ever mentioned once in the Bible in Acts why their name is there why their location is there remember the context Luke was writing to Theophilus he wasn't panning a portion of the Bible for future Generations the Lord's return was expected any moment my sisters my brothers we each have a role to play a task to perform a life to live a testimony to give it's easy to focus on Peter and Paul and we should not forget them but we must never forget the vital roles played by others kill them Priscilla aristarchus Timothy Apollos James Stephen Phillip Barnabas Silas and the unnamed thousands who accepted the gospel message endured persecution and carried the message of Grace down to our day we need to each be diligent play our role take our place to love and serve one another thinking about Sunday not in the simulator but in the jet we need as we turn the service over to our pastor I'd like to sing sorry the battery died on this Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] tried and true [Music] with Thanksgiving [Music] sanctuary [Music] be a sanctuary [Music] tried and two with Thanksgiving [Music] I'll be at least [Music] for you one more time for the job Lord prepare me yes sanctuary [Music] and with Thanksgiving I'll be at least give me sanctuary [Music] 's brother Lyle was closing he's talking about this man Luke and all the research that he did and studying this man Jesus in his life we know that is as the Book of Luke and all that he had worked and all the studying that he did to report back to this man Theophilus and I wonder when he met the Apostle Paul I wonder what he thought when he saw Paul and he had studied all of this about Jesus and when he saw that man I wonder if he thought [Music] that man that I have learned so much about that I have been baptized in his name that that I have seen that he is the Messiah and all that he studied I wonder if he thought and maybe maybe even said out loud The Same Spirit that was in that man rests in this Apostle Paul I I know that around 1950 a little maybe in the early 50s my grandfather was listening to the radio down in south Georgia and he heard this man preaching he had been reading his Bible he had he had been following this new minister named Oral Roberts you know him and when he heard this man speak [Music] it may have been the same as when Luke heard this man Paul speak he heard it on the radio he told my grandmother he told his wife he said get the kids ready we're going to go hear this man he got in the car the next day and they drove I don't know six hours or so to Cleveland Tennessee and they saw that servant stand in front of the people preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ just as the Apostle Paul did and then he did the same works that Jesus did just as the Apostle Paul did and like Luke he saw something real in that man and he started following this man all around the country it may not have been an old ship across the Mediterranean but it was a station wagon following this man named William Branham all around the country and seeing the same thing that Luke saw when he saw Paul preach the same gospel so much so that even brother Branham himself when he went beyond the curtain of time he said I preached the same thing as Paul preached and he sought my grandpa saw it both of my grandpa's side it was the real thing and his brother Lyle was closing I just thought oh God the same thing happened in our day he talks about brother Peterson brother Peterson saw it he talked about the sister Grace and Michigan she saw it people around the world saw it the same spirit that was on these Apostles was manifested again in this man named William Branham and you can see why people would travel the world to come see him the same reason that this man Luke saw the truth in that man Paul and he just wanted to be a part and thank God that he did now instead of the Book of Luke in the book of Acts we've got tape recordings and thank God that we have those tape recordings that we can listen with our own ears a prophet a true Prophet a true Messenger from God that believed in the Lord Jesus Christ as Paul did that spread that gospel and that did the same works that Christ did just as the Apostle Paul did not feel good doesn't feel good that that we can tie in this book of Acts all the way to this day and let me tell you something there's more coming Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and there's more coming it'll be coming all the way until he comes down and we go up and we meet him in the air there's more coming friends let's all stand one more time brother Jonathan Lord prepare me Hello Brother David coming close [Music] [Laughter] [Music] with Thanksgiving sanctuary [Music] [Music] let's pray Lord Jesus we're honored to be able to gather here together like this in this building Lord Jesus what a thing to be part of the same story we're like these gentlemen have said we're all we're doing is we've written chapters through the last couple of thousand years and we're seeing the first few chapters we've we've studied it Lord but what we're living today is just a continuation of the same story Lord and and I it's a privilege to be a part of it I uh so many times Our Testimony it fails before people out in the world Lord Jesus forgive us of that give us the opportunity Lord to to live a life in front of those around us that they would see something real when when Luke looked upon Paul and thought that's the same spirit that I've read about that I saw when people looked on brother Branham and thought that must be the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ may they look on our lives and think that Jesus is Alive because I see it in that man or that woman there and that's proof to me may we have that kind of a testimony Lord forgive us where we fail and help us to to get up each time I was thinking earlier sometimes we have what it takes to to go maybe 90 percent of the way we're thankful that you reached down and help us the 10 percent sometimes we only have what it takes to maybe make a 30 percent of the way we're thankful Lord that you your grace pours out just a little bit more and you take a seventy percent Lord sometimes we can only give one percent we're so thankful that you're more than able to take us the rest of the way Lord we it's it's not easy yielding ourselves to you that it's it's a difficult thing that's why so many have fallen by the wayside that's that's not easy but Lord we that's our desire we wanna yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit we want to be a sanctuary a sanctuary is is a holy place that has been set aside that you can dwell in we literally want to be uh uh living breathing building Tabernacle that you could pour yourself into and live through US Grant Lord Jesus in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] Lord prepare [Music] to [Music] with Thanksgiving [Music] sanctuary for you Lord prepare me be a sanctuary [Music] with Thanksgiving I'll be early [Music] for you did you appreciate brother Lyle tonight that was great I just I'll tell you what the service just went by like that it was on the edge of my seat I was trying to watch the little monitor up here and I couldn't see it very well so I was looking up there I just loved it I I just thought wow it just put us right there it was to me it was it was just a great blessing brothers and sisters we are blessed we're so blessed we're just there's not enough words that we can say to our lord Jesus how much we love him and I just I just can't get off of this man Luke and the honor that he had and and when he saw that I can't wait to Brother David I can't wait to he gives his testimony to me I can't wait to meet him and shake his hand and say when did you meet him and what happened I think it's going to be a great day let's make sure that we are all there and if there's somebody that might be struggling they might not they might not make it grab a hold of their arm and pull them across the Finish Line if they can't walk pick them up and carry them across the finish line because we need to all be there friends Elijah back there this is the brother I was talking about don't let him leave without
