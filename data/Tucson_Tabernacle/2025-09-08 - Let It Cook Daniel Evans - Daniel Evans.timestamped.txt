[0:00] Let's put that first verse up. I have a
[0:03] source
[0:04] of strength when I am weak. Before we
[0:07] take the the prayer request this morning
[0:09] and open in prayer, we're going to sing

[0:34] That takes
[0:36] me through.
[0:40] When life
[0:42] is pressing
[0:44] me,
[0:47] I have a source.
[0:49] I have a source
[0:56] of power
[0:58] from
[1:00] above.
[1:05] I'm covered
[1:08] over
[1:12] by a shield
[1:16] of love.

[1:20] Oh, I claim the blood.
[1:26] Jesus shed
[1:29] on Calary.
[1:36] Those preious

[2:52] Oh, for there's a healing
[2:59] cleansing
[3:01] stream that flows.

[3:10] that only
[3:14] is redeemed
[3:17] can know. I claim the blood.
[3:22] I claim
[3:24] the blood
[3:28] Jesus shed on Calary.
[3:34] Those
[3:37] [Music]
[3:38] preious
[3:40] blood stains
[3:43] were made
[3:45] there just for me.

[4:11] [Music]
[4:13] I claim
[4:15] those preious
[4:17] blood stain.
[4:20] If the brothers want to come forward and
[4:21] open in a word of prayer,
[4:23] I have a prayer request that wasn't
[4:25] given. Brother Aaron, you want to come?
[4:27] And the brothers, I know of a family
[4:30] this morning that's having some
[4:33] difficulties.
[4:35] Can't go into too many details, but has
[4:38] a really rough family situation right
[4:40] now. Just want the church to pray for
[4:41] them this morning. Let's sing that first
[4:44] verse again. And whatever that need is
[4:46] in your life, for yourself or for
[4:47] someone else, lift it before the Lord. I
[4:51] have
[4:53] a source
[4:57] of strength
[4:59] when I
[5:01] am weak.
[5:02] [Music]
[5:06] Oh, that takes me through.
[5:12] When life is pressing
[5:16] me, do you believe it? Oh, I have a
[5:24] source
[5:25] [Music]
[5:27] of power
[5:30] from
[5:31] above.
[5:34] [Music]
[5:36] I'm covered
[5:39] over
[5:43] by a shield
[5:46] of love. Claim what he's done for you
[5:49] this morning. Oh, I claim
[5:54] the blood
[5:56] [Music]
[5:57] Jesus shed
[6:00] on Calaryry.
[6:03] Those
[6:08] preious
[6:10] blood stains
[6:13] were made
[6:15] there just for me.
[6:22] For all my sin,
[6:28] my sickness
[6:30] and
[6:32] my pain.
[6:33] [Music]
[6:37] When I need healing,
[6:43] I claim
[6:45] those preious
[6:47] blood stains.
[6:52] I have a source,
[6:55] but you have to go to the source.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; You just can't leave it as I have that
[6:59] source. It's right over there.
[7:02] take advantage of it.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; Go up and take your part to Jes.
[7:07] You know, he that's why he gave his life
[7:09] on Calvary
[7:11] &gt;&gt; because he loved you. He cared for you
[7:14] &gt;&gt; and he said they're going they can't do
[7:15] it without me. So, I'm going to give
[7:17] myself four of them and two. So, take
[7:20] that and claim. Amen. We have a few
[7:23] requests here.
[7:28] [Music]
[7:30] I don't know, brother David. When Yasi
[7:32] sent out a late evening yesterday, they
[7:36] had gotten some information from back
[7:38] home about the loss of of life and
[7:42] flooding back there. But then he found
[7:45] out that his was your aunt, right? The
[7:49] one that told him about God,
[7:53] she passed away. So it hurt him.
[7:57] But there's a source. See, and God uses
[8:01] different people as a source.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; The light that you have may just be
[8:07] enough for somebody else.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; So talking to him today, he's been
[8:11] comforted, but it hurt him. He lost the
[8:13] one that led him to Christ. And it's a
[8:16] blessing to have that. So remember those
[8:19] back there
[8:21] in other countries and places that's
[8:23] happening today.
[8:25] They have that source too. It's the same
[8:27] source.
[8:29] I just remember that Sister Barbara
[8:31] Yario and has a request.
[8:34] So I have two urgent prayer requests at
[8:38] this time. The first request is for my
[8:41] nephew who is looking for a job. Please
[8:43] pray that the Lord will lead him and
[8:46] guide him to the job that the Lord wants
[8:49] him to have. And you know, you can place
[8:52] all your cares on him. He'll lead you.
[8:55] He'll guide you. The second one is
[8:58] prayer for a young mother of five
[9:00] children who has been seeking searching
[9:04] or or searching scriptures and seeking
[9:06] God. This has gotten her husband very
[9:09] upset to the point of thinking that she
[9:11] is crazy.
[9:13] So remember that. You know, there have
[9:15] been those that have gotten that way and
[9:17] then God has gotten a hold of the one.
[9:18] You're praying for the wife and God gets
[9:20] hold of the husband or praying for the
[9:22] husband and changes the whole situation.
[9:25] Amen.
[9:29] Also, brother Tim Cruz is he said, "Just
[9:32] want to first of all, I said just want
[9:33] to thank the Lord for healing my mom
[9:34] from the skin reaction she had a few
[9:36] weeks ago. It's all healed up, but
[9:39] asking prayers for my mom for some major
[9:42] dental work she is having next week.
[9:44] She's at the risk of infection. praying
[9:46] that the Lord will keep her safe. Amen.
[9:51] And then brother Jeremy and sister
[9:53] Angela
[9:55] says, "Please keep us in prayer. We have
[9:58] a court on Tuesday for our younger
[10:00] children. I'll let them give the
[10:02] testimony that I believe is we're going
[10:05] to get to hear. It's going to be a
[10:06] blessing. Let you remember them."
[10:11] &gt;&gt; And then Sister Amelia, she said,
[10:13] "Praise God. unspoken prayer request and
[10:18] another prayer request I had before the
[10:19] Lord about our our our
[10:25] home. I believe that says have been
[10:27] answered. Thank you for your prayers.
[10:30] Amen. God is more than able. You have a
[10:33] need.
[10:34] [Music]
[10:35] I've raised my hand a hundred times.
[10:37] I've raised my hand a thousand times.
[10:39] But he hasn't changed. He's still the
[10:42] same. So let's just bow our heads.
[10:45] Lord, that precious blood that was shed,
[10:48] the stripes that were taken, the
[10:51] beating, the mocking,
[10:54] Satan did all he can. And he's tried
[10:57] from the day he was cast down from
[10:59] heaven
[11:01] to distort, to break up, to undo
[11:05] what you had planned to do, what your
[11:07] was in your heart to do. and he's never
[11:10] been able to stop and he never will.
[11:14] Lord, give us a strength, Lord, and and
[11:17] and the faith to take you at your word,
[11:19] Lord. That source that you've provided
[11:21] and apply it and use it. It's one thing
[11:24] to have that source sitting in the
[11:26] shelf. It's another thing to take
[11:28] advantage of it and use it, Lord. We
[11:30] thank you for the shed blood, the
[11:32] forgiving grace and mercy of God. For
[11:35] for daily we need it, Lord, and you've
[11:38] met, Lord. You looked beyond our faults
[11:40] and saw our needs, Lord. We praise you
[11:43] for that. We worship you for that. We
[11:46] thank you for the praise reports that
[11:48] we're going to hear for. Lord, we thank
[11:49] you already in Jesus Christ's name. Just
[11:53] an announcement from Brother Dan
[11:56] yesterday, and I'll let him, but
[11:59] yesterday there was a lot of work done
[12:00] in the church. Thank you for all of
[12:02] those who helped, and um
[12:05] One of the things that Dan really,
[12:06] brother Dan really expressed is,
[12:09] "Please, let's keep the food, the
[12:12] liquids out of the church except for the
[12:15] water bottles." Okay, we won't. Will we,
[12:18] Brother Ed? Will we catch them at the
[12:19] door? No.
[12:23] But anyway, so he may get more, but just
[12:26] it's beautiful. It's wonderful. It's
[12:28] It's nice what's happening. So, uh,
[12:30] let's do our best to keep it clean, to
[12:32] to keep it usable.
[12:37] It's
[12:39] It's kind of like when you remodel your
[12:41] house and after it's all nice and
[12:42] remodeled, you almost don't. You don't
[12:43] want to go in there and get it dirty.
[12:46] But it's a house of the Lord and he
[12:47] wants us to come and participate. So,
[12:50] God bless you.
[12:53] You can all have your seats. He knows my
[12:56] name.
[12:58] There were lots of needs this morning
[12:59] and the Lord knows all of them.
[13:05] Amen.
[13:07] Let's sing this song as a confession,
[13:09] something you actually believe. Amen.
[13:12] [Music]
[13:15] I have a maker.
[13:23] He formed
[13:25] my heart.

[24:43] brother John Locer,
[24:45] and all the work that they did and
[24:47] especially Brother Jordan and all the
[24:49] work that he did getting the
[24:51] hooked up and especially brother Ed Doo.
[24:54] He's been really the driving force
[24:57] behind everything. Special thanks to him
[24:59] and everybody everybody that came out
[25:00] yesterday to help get everything set up.
[25:03] Believe moving in a direction I believe
[25:08] very very grateful. I miss, you know,
[25:11] some people
[25:13] you miss and then really some people you
[25:16] just really really miss. And I have just
[25:19] been really missing. Brother Lyle and
[25:22] Sister Heather Johnson.
[25:25] [Applause]
[25:28] They're they're two people that are dear
[25:30] to me. They're dear to the church.
[25:33] They're such a pivotal part of our
[25:35] church. Very important part. And brother
[25:39] I sent out a text yesterday or this
[25:42] morning and saying if you want to read
[25:44] ahead, go ahead and read to brother Lou
[25:47] just texted me saying thank you. Um,
[25:51] brother L I I sent out the text this
[25:53] morning. If you want to read ahead, read
[25:55] First Kings chapter 18 and chapter 19.
[25:58] And brother Lyall there, I assume
[26:00] they're in Utah because brother Lyall
[26:03] sent me this picture. Brothers, if you
[26:05] could put up that first picture, brother
[26:08] Lyall sent after I sent that text.
[26:13] No, the other one.
[26:18] The first one. Yeah, that one. So, so
[26:21] Brother L's going I assume it's in Utah
[26:23] and he he sees this and he knows what
[26:26] First Kings chapter 18 is and that's the
[26:30] Mount Carmel experience with Elijah. And
[26:31] then now zoom in on it.
[26:34] and he just happened to see what's the
[26:36] the next picture there
[26:40] and he sees that sign.
[26:43] So, praise the Lord. I think we're all
[26:44] in even if brother Ly and Sister Heather
[26:46] are cruising across the country, we're
[26:49] all on the same page in doing this. So,
[26:52] yeah, I'm going to talk a little bit
[26:54] about the Mount Carmel experience and
[26:55] then I really want to talk about the
[26:57] still small voice that Elijah heard
[27:01] that uh Dan. So this past week, Daniel
[27:06] came into my office, which he he does a
[27:08] lot, just father and son. We talk about
[27:10] the Lord. We talk about just life. And
[27:13] Daniel, he was all excited about the
[27:15] church. And he was like like I have
[27:18] been. And and you know, he's he's a lot
[27:20] like his dad. He just he wants to go go
[27:22] and let's get it done. And and dad, this
[27:24] is a great idea. And when you get a
[27:26] little bit older, you see that these
[27:28] these great ideas, some of them stick
[27:31] and then some of them they they might
[27:33] just kind of fade away. And and Daniel
[27:35] came in and and he's talking about the
[27:37] music and and the instruments and all
[27:38] that and he was excited and I said,
[27:40] "Buddy," I said, "On with these ideas
[27:42] sometimes just let them cook for a while
[27:47] and just let them I said, "You don't
[27:49] take a roast out of the refrigerator and
[27:51] then take a big bite out of it, man.
[27:54] It's not done yet. You got to take it
[27:57] and you got to you got to put it in the
[27:58] pan and with all the seasonings in it
[28:00] and then you got to put it in the oven
[28:01] for a while to cook. And I said, "That's
[28:05] how it is with a lot of these ideas is
[28:08] just let them cook for a while and
[28:10] you'll find the Lord might change the
[28:13] direction." But a lot of times the
[28:16] pressures of the world, they they want
[28:21] it right now.
[28:23] and the the pressures that you feel
[28:25] especially in today's society you want
[28:28] things now like Amazon you get on Amazon
[28:32] and I'll look at things there and if
[28:35] it's not delivered within two days
[28:37] that's too long but if it's not
[28:39] delivered within two days I won't even
[28:41] go I'll go to the next one a lot of
[28:43] times I want it delivered today because
[28:45] it's like I want it I want it now and
[28:47] there's not time to cook there so we
[28:49] make a lot of mistakes in doing that I
[28:51] remember when I was a little
[28:54] I used to save up my money and I would
[28:56] get these hunting magazines from the
[28:58] grocery store. And in the back of the
[29:00] hunting magazines, they had these
[29:01] advertisements and you would cut out the
[29:04] advertisement
[29:06] and you'd fill out your name and you'd
[29:09] fill out your address and then you would
[29:11] put the money in the envelope and you
[29:14] would send it out and it'd be a pocketk
[29:16] knife or it' be a like a catalog or
[29:18] something like that. And I would save up
[29:20] my money and and I' I'd get it and I'd
[29:22] get a stamp from mom and I' I'd put the
[29:24] money in the envelope and then it'd
[29:25] always say it always say allow four to
[29:27] six weeks for delivery. You would
[29:29] immediately go out of business today. If
[29:32] it was for except for our carpet,
[29:34] brother Ed, but it if it takes four to
[29:38] six weeks for delivery, it's like you
[29:40] just go to the next thing. But that was
[29:41] just the way that we used to do things.
[29:43] and then about a month later, I would
[29:45] get my whatever it was that I ordered
[29:47] and I'd be happy with it. That's not the
[29:50] way today. You walk into a car
[29:52] dealership and they know that if you
[29:56] walk back out, then they've probably
[29:59] left lost the sale. So, they will do
[30:02] everything within their power to get you
[30:05] to buy this car. And it is like the
[30:08] world is going to stop turning if you
[30:10] don't put down that down payment, sign
[30:12] the papers. You'll never see a a deal
[30:15] like this again. It's just a once in a
[30:17] lifetime. I already went I talked to my
[30:19] supervisor and he says it's okay. You
[30:22] know, you know, don't tell anybody. It's
[30:24] like, yeah, right, man. Sure. But they
[30:27] know if you walk out, if they if you
[30:29] have a little bit of time to let it
[30:31] cook, then you probably won't come back.
[30:34] You won't make that decision.
[30:36] Same thing with with work. You know, you
[30:39] go to work and if you somebody's
[30:41] treating you badly at work or somebody
[30:43] makes you mad or somebody does you
[30:44] dirty, the best decision when that
[30:48] happens is don't do anything. Let it
[30:52] cook for a little while. my one of my
[30:55] first bosses, Nick Meltchure was his
[30:58] name, when he gave me a supervisor
[31:00] position, my first time I was ever a
[31:02] supervisor, he brought me into his
[31:03] office and he gave me some advice. And
[31:05] the only advice I remember him giving me
[31:08] is he said that if somebody ever makes
[31:12] you mad and he says it's going to
[31:14] happen. If somebody offends you and he
[31:17] says it's going to happen, he said you
[31:19] can go ahead and you can write the email
[31:23] or you can write down your notes on what
[31:25] you're going to say, but he said don't
[31:27] send the email.
[31:30] don't talk to the person until you've
[31:33] let 24 hours go by. And he says, "Then
[31:36] after 24 hours, then you can go ahead
[31:39] and send the email or you can go ahead
[31:41] and talk to that person or whatever it
[31:42] is." But he told me, he said, "Give it
[31:44] the 24-hour rule.
[31:47] Let it cook for a little while." And you
[31:49] know when ever this has happened I have
[31:52] written many many emails where it's like
[31:56] this guy and you know I write it up and
[32:00] then I let it sit and I come back the
[32:02] next day. I have never sent that. I've
[32:07] written many many of them but I have
[32:09] never hit the send button because I
[32:11] followed the rule let it wait. The same
[32:14] thing with talking but with somebody
[32:16] that may have made you mad or or got
[32:18] under your skin. Just wait a little bit.
[32:21] Let it cook for a little while and then
[32:23] you'll find the next day you might not
[32:25] make that same decision. You might not
[32:27] make that same mistake. And how many of
[32:29] us have made a mistake where we just let
[32:32] somebody have it because we lost our
[32:35] temper or we wanted to set them
[32:36] straight. And how many times do we
[32:38] regret doing it? It's probably every
[32:40] time or at least almost every time it's
[32:44] be best to let these things just cook
[32:47] for a little while. King Saul, brother
[32:51] and I went through a series on David and
[32:53] Saul. And one of the big weaknesses King
[32:56] Saul had was he he would act too
[33:01] quickly. He wouldn't pray about
[33:04] something. He wouldn't just let it wait.
[33:06] He he wouldn't wait for Samuel. He
[33:07] wouldn't wait for the Lord. And it. He
[33:10] was swayed by the people to make bad
[33:12] decisions. And if he would have just let
[33:14] those decisions sit for a little bit and
[33:17] weighed them out and prayed about them,
[33:19] he wouldn't have made such horrible
[33:22] mistakes. But he didn't. Same thing with
[33:25] marriage.
[33:26] How many failed marriages do we know
[33:29] about that would not have happened in
[33:32] the first place if they would have just
[33:34] let it cook for a while? If they would
[33:36] have prayed about this? If they would
[33:38] have had a little bit longer engagement
[33:40] if they would have just weighed things
[33:42] out and got to know each other better.
[33:46] There's again there's a time to take the
[33:48] roast out of the oven. Don't just let it
[33:49] cook forever.
[33:52] That's not right either. Then you'll get
[33:55] overcooked, but don't let the emotions
[33:57] dictate anything.
[34:00] You might be madly in love with this
[34:02] person or you might feel obligated to
[34:05] marry that person, but just let the
[34:07] roast cook for a little while and then
[34:10] let do it on the Lord's time.
[34:14] Remember when I was first called to the
[34:16] ministry, I think it was like 2017,
[34:20] Josiah and he uh I said, "What song are
[34:23] you going to introduce me to this this
[34:26] morning?" He says, "You'll know." And he
[34:28] didn't tell me because I've given Josiah
[34:31] the testimony of when the Lord called me
[34:33] to the ministry. It was by a vision that
[34:37] I saw and we were singing that song
[34:39] hosana in church and the Lord called me
[34:42] to the ministry during that during
[34:45] singing that song and I'll I'll tell an
[34:47] amazing amazing miracle that happened is
[34:52] when I was singing that song Hosanna and
[34:54] the Lord was was showing me and
[34:57] commissioning me and giving giving me my
[34:59] commission to preach the gospel the
[35:02] people in front of
[35:05] came to me afterwards and said, "Wow,
[35:07] you have a beautiful voice
[35:13] when you were singing that song,
[35:14] Hosanna." That was you should lead songs
[35:17] in church. And it was because I really
[35:20] believe it was because I was anointed
[35:21] and it was because that things were
[35:23] really that the Lord was dealing with
[35:26] me. But it wasn't until years later that
[35:30] I even stepped into the pull pit and
[35:32] opened the Bible.
[35:34] The Lord commissioned me, but I had to
[35:36] cook for a little while. Had to let let
[35:39] that cook and and just wait for the Lord
[35:42] to open the door. If I would have just
[35:44] went out and started going, I would have
[35:46] had all kinds of problems. But I waited
[35:50] on the Lord and then the Lord began to
[35:54] to open some doors. If I would have just
[35:56] ran out right then, right when I got my
[35:58] commission, it would have failed.
[36:01] But I waited, let it cook for a while,
[36:04] and then things started to happen. The
[36:06] Apostle Paul, same thing happened to
[36:08] him. He got his commission to go to the
[36:12] Gentiles from Jesus himself. Came to
[36:15] Paul in a blinding light and
[36:17] commissioned him to go to the Gentiles.
[36:20] But then Paul let that cook for another
[36:23] three years. He went and he prayed about
[36:26] it and he studied the scriptures and he
[36:28] made sure of his commission.
[36:31] Let things cook. It doesn't have to be
[36:35] right now. Just let it go. Pray about it
[36:39] and then go forward as the Lord leads
[36:42] you. I want to uh give a summary
[36:47] about this man Elijah.
[36:50] and he was coming off of a great and
[36:55] mighty victory. So you remember Elijah
[36:57] came. The first thing we know about
[36:59] Elijah is he just shows up out of
[37:01] nowhere. He walks up to the king and
[37:03] says, "Not due nor rain will fall until
[37:07] I call for it." And he brought this
[37:09] famine on Israel for three and a half
[37:13] years. It didn't rain. People were
[37:15] dying. The crops all dried up.
[37:19] Things were very very hard in Israel
[37:23] during that time that a very evil king
[37:26] you know the king's name Ahab do you
[37:29] know his wife's name Jezebel very very
[37:33] evil couple a very hard couple were
[37:36] ruling Israel at that time and they they
[37:39] came and and and it just really brought
[37:42] the country to its knees well then after
[37:45] three and a half years go by the The
[37:48] word of the Lord comes to Elijah
[37:51] and he tells Elijah to go back to Ahab.
[37:56] So Elijah goes back
[37:58] and the Lord must have really dealt with
[38:01] him because no one would do what Elijah
[38:04] did if they didn't already know what to
[38:07] do. Elijah goes up and he says, "Hey,
[38:09] bring all of your prophets." There was
[38:11] like 450 prophets of Baal that were part
[38:15] of this whole group. And he says, "Bring
[38:17] all of your prophets
[38:20] on this si this mountain called Mount
[38:22] Carmel." The the the road sign that
[38:25] Brother Lyle said there back in Israel,
[38:29] there's a Mount Carmel, too, the
[38:31] original. And that is where Elijah says,
[38:34] "Get all of your your your prophets and
[38:37] all of your priests, all of your holy
[38:39] men together. Go up there and we are
[38:42] going to build two sacrifices. We're
[38:46] going to build two altars.
[38:48] One altar is to Baal and then the other
[38:52] altar is to my God. Now, these were
[38:55] burnt offerings. And one of the things
[38:56] that you will notice here that not many
[38:58] people know is that this was a Jewish
[39:01] type offering. They followed all of the
[39:04] Jewish rules in doing this. We know that
[39:07] they were prophets to Baal, but it's so
[39:09] easy for a believer to get off. And
[39:12] these were Jews. Ahab was in the line of
[39:15] a Jew and they got off of the track to
[39:20] where they were worshiping false gods.
[39:22] And I don't think that they knew that
[39:24] they were worshiping false gods. And
[39:26] here Elijah says, "Okay, you bring your
[39:28] religion and I'll bring mine." And he
[39:31] says, "We will build these altars. We'll
[39:33] take a a bullock. We'll take a bull and
[39:36] we'll put it on the altar. We'll cut it
[39:38] up like the Jewish traditions are. will
[39:41] cut it up and then it will be a burnt
[39:43] offering to God. But here's the deal.
[39:46] The God is gonna light the fire. You can
[39:50] set up the wood and you can set up all
[39:51] of that, but the God that speaks through
[39:54] fire, we know that he is the mighty God.
[39:58] So what they did is they all they got
[40:01] together and they started getting all
[40:02] emotional and they started crying out to
[40:04] God. And they were crying. Elijah says,
[40:07] "You do it first." So they were crying
[40:09] out to God and and they wouldn't have
[40:11] been crying out to God if they didn't
[40:13] really believe it was going to happen.
[40:14] So these people had faith. They thought
[40:17] that their religion was right. They were
[40:20] as sure as anyone else that their
[40:21] religion was right. And they started
[40:24] crying out to Baal to to this God.
[40:27] Crying that God would send fire from
[40:30] heaven. He didn't send it. They
[40:34] continued to cry out to God, to their
[40:37] God, and he didn't send it. He didn't
[40:39] answer. So, you know what they did
[40:43] is as they were doing this,
[40:46] they began
[40:49] to cut themselves.
[40:52] Let me let me read it. Verse
[40:56] number verse 27, first Kings chapter 18.
[40:59] We'll read what happens with Elijah. So
[41:02] they're crying and they're doing all
[41:03] their emotional things. And it came to
[41:05] pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and
[41:07] said, "Cry louder
[41:10] for he is he is a god. Either he is
[41:13] talking or he's pursuing or he is in a
[41:15] journey or pervententure he's sleeping
[41:18] and must be awake.
[41:20] So cry as loud as you can."
[41:25] And they cried aloud and they cut
[41:27] themselves
[41:29] after their manner with knives and
[41:30] lancets till the blood gushed out upon
[41:33] them. So cutting, we hear that this is
[41:36] some of the young people do this.
[41:39] Cutting is not something new. Cutting
[41:41] goes way back and it's something that
[41:44] that the enemy uses to hurt a child of
[41:49] God. And God never ever wants you to
[41:53] hurt yourself. He never wants you to cut
[41:57] yourself. He never wants you to in any
[41:59] way hurt yourself. He never wants you to
[42:00] commit suicide.
[42:02] God is not that type of a God. And when
[42:05] those emotions arise up in us, it's
[42:09] because it's Satan doing it. And he is
[42:13] he is the one that's doing that. It
[42:14] doesn't it's not the person, but it's
[42:17] Satan that's doing that. So they're
[42:20] doing they're cutting themselves and
[42:21] there's blood gushing all over. And then
[42:24] nothing happens. So Elijah says, "Okay,
[42:26] now it's my turn." Elijah goes and he he
[42:29] tells the guys, he says, "Dig a trench
[42:31] around the altar." Maybe the altar was
[42:33] about this size. And he says, "Dig a
[42:35] trench around it." And he says, "Take
[42:38] water. Pour water on the offering." This
[42:44] this cut up bowl. Pour offering on. pour
[42:48] water on the offering and the and it
[42:50] drenched the offering and it and it
[42:52] drenched the wood that was around it and
[42:54] it filled up the trench that was around
[42:58] the altar. And I'm saying this because I
[43:01] want you to realize how great of a
[43:03] miracle that Elijah was coming from.
[43:08] Verse number 37.
[43:10] Then Elijah prays
[43:12] and he says, "Hear me, oh, oh Lord.
[43:16] Hear me that this people may know that
[43:18] thou art the Lord God and that thou hast
[43:21] turned their heart back again." Look at
[43:23] the spirit of Elijah. And that thou has
[43:26] turned their heart back again. Then the
[43:28] fire of the Lord fell and consumed the
[43:30] burnt sacrifice and the wood and the
[43:33] stones and the dust and licked up the
[43:36] water that was in the trench. And when
[43:37] all the people saw it, they fell on
[43:39] their faces and they said, "The Lord, he
[43:42] is the God. The Lord, he is the God." So
[43:45] this is a miraculous experience that
[43:47] caused all of these people to believe.
[43:49] And it increased all of these people's
[43:51] faith. And Elijah said unto them, "Take
[43:54] the prophets of Baal."
[43:57] Now we have all of this faith. They just
[43:59] saw fire come down and consume Elijah's.
[44:01] And they said, "All I saw all these guys
[44:03] running around making a lot of noise,
[44:04] but nothing was happening."
[44:07] So over here they see this happen. Now
[44:10] the faith of the people is raised and
[44:12] Elijah says now go gather up all of
[44:14] these prophets of Baal. Let none of them
[44:18] escape. And they took them and Elijah
[44:20] brought them down to the brook Kaishon
[44:23] and slew them there.
[44:25] So Ahab and Jezebel the king and queen
[44:28] they were not happy about this. Elijah
[44:32] starts praying that the Lord right after
[44:34] that Elijah starts praying that the Lord
[44:36] would send rain. Then remember as I said
[44:38] it's been three and a half years and
[44:41] Elijah told Ahab at the beginning it
[44:43] wouldn't rain until he called for it.
[44:45] Now Elijah is calling for it. And once
[44:48] again Elijah even gets down on his knees
[44:52] puts his head between his knees and
[44:55] prays to God that he would send rain.
[44:58] I think it was seven times he prayed
[45:01] this and then the the servant that was
[45:03] with him, he says, "Go look. Is there
[45:05] any anything? You see anything?" He's
[45:07] like, "No." Says, "Sunny and hot." And
[45:10] he says, "Now do it again." And then the
[45:12] last time he says, "Oh." He says, "I see
[45:14] a cloud starting to form in the
[45:16] distance." And Elijah gets up. He says,
[45:19] "That's it." And then he goes down. He
[45:22] says, "Tell Ahab." He tells Ahab that
[45:25] that God is sending an abundance of rain
[45:29] and then the rain comes. But now first
[45:34] Kings 19
[45:37] that obviously Ahab had just killed all
[45:40] of their prophets. They had failed and
[45:42] he had killed all of Ahab and Jezebel's
[45:45] prophets. So now you have the king and
[45:47] queen were upset.
[45:50] So Elijah's coming off two great
[45:52] miracles. one on Mount Carmel that his
[45:55] his sacrifice
[45:57] was taken was was burned up by the by
[46:00] the fire of the Lord and then second
[46:03] that the rain came.
[46:05] First Kings chapter 19 verse1 listen to
[46:08] this
[46:09] and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah
[46:13] had done and with all he had slain all
[46:16] the prophets with the sword.
[46:20] And then Jezebel sent a messenger to
[46:22] Elijah, saying, "Let the gods do to me,
[46:26] and more also if I make not thy life as
[46:30] the life of one of them by tomorrow
[46:32] about this time." So she threatens
[46:36] Elijah and Elijah runs for the hills and
[46:40] eventually Elijah finds himself in a
[46:44] cave in the mountains and surely
[46:47] thinking about all of these things and
[46:50] just letting them cook in his mind.
[46:54] Verse number nine.
[46:58] And Elijah came hither into a cave
[47:01] and lodged there. And behold, the word
[47:03] of the Lord came to him, and he said
[47:06] unto him, "What doest thou here,
[47:08] Elijah?" How many of us have been in
[47:11] that same place right there? Where we
[47:13] get this verse, it's like, "What am I
[47:14] doing? Why am I here? What purpose do I
[47:18] have? What what is going on in all of
[47:20] this in all of this confusion?" And it
[47:24] all boils down to what's what am I
[47:27] doing? Have you ever been there when
[47:30] you're trying to serve the Lord? It's
[47:31] like, "What am I even doing?" Or or
[47:34] you're you're struggling with with
[47:36] something in life. What am I doing? And
[47:38] here's Elijah and the word of the Lord
[47:40] comes to him and it's saying, "What are
[47:44] you doing?
[47:46] What are you doing here?"
[47:49] And Elijah
[47:51] says this. He says, "I have been very,
[47:54] very jealous for the Lord God of hosts.
[47:57] For the children of Israel have forsaken
[47:59] thy covenant, thrown down thine altars,
[48:01] and slain thy prophets with the sword,
[48:04] and I even o I only am left, and they
[48:07] seek my life to take it away.
[48:10] Elijah was down. He just had Imagine,
[48:14] put yourself in Elijah's spot.
[48:17] Can you imagine if you just prayed over
[48:20] a burnt offering and God sent a pillar
[48:23] of fire down and consumed it? Would it
[48:26] increase your faith? Of course it would.
[48:29] And then can you imagine that you prayed
[48:31] that it hadn't rained for three and a
[48:33] half years. You get on your knees and
[48:34] you ask the Lord to send rain and all of
[48:37] a sudden it just starts a thunderstorm
[48:39] starts coming. But here is Elijah. He
[48:42] wasn't looking in the past.
[48:45] Those things were great and God did
[48:47] those things. But Elijah was now walking
[48:50] in the present and he needed help from
[48:53] God. Those things were praise the Lord.
[48:55] They encourage us. But now Elijah is
[48:59] here in this day and he says, "Lord, I
[49:03] need help." He was seeking the voice of
[49:06] God. And it's a strange place that the
[49:09] Elijah's at. He's on this place called
[49:13] Mount Horeb.
[49:15] It's also called Mount Si.
[49:18] This is the place that God first sent
[49:21] his word
[49:23] to the prophet Moses in the form of the
[49:25] Ten Commandments. And here is Elijah and
[49:29] he finds himself on that same mountain.
[49:35] And he was seeking the voice of God. He
[49:37] was seeking something from God.
[49:41] And here's Elijah.
[49:44] And he wants God to speak to him in an
[49:46] audible voice.
[49:49] And we want so often we want the walls
[49:51] to shake.
[49:53] We want someone to speak in tongues and
[49:56] give a prophecy. We want the fire of
[49:59] heaven to come down like that. We want
[50:01] to see these things. And here is Elijah
[50:03] on the same mountain that God sent his
[50:05] word. And he is seeking the voice of
[50:09] God. And we need to understand that the
[50:12] scriptures
[50:14] Elijah maybe he had a little bit of
[50:16] Moses's writing.
[50:19] But we have something that is far beyond
[50:23] that. We have this word which is God.
[50:27] Remember John 1:1
[50:30] says in the beginning was the word
[50:33] and the word was with God and the word
[50:35] was God. And here is Elijah and he is
[50:38] just seeking the word word of the Lord.
[50:41] And we so often we are seeking God to
[50:45] speak to us. And can you imagine if if
[50:47] you're seeking God and you want him to
[50:49] speak to you and you're praying and
[50:51] you're praying and you're praying, but a
[50:53] lot of times most of the time if you
[50:55] would just open up your Bible, it's God
[50:58] speaking to you. You don't just open it
[51:00] and find a scripture and say, "Okay,
[51:02] there's the answer to my question." But
[51:04] if you open it and you can read the word
[51:06] of God, it is far beyond anything that
[51:08] we could ever imagine. You read this
[51:11] Bible, it is God speaking to you in a
[51:16] still small voice. And if we would just
[51:19] do it more often, we would hear God
[51:21] speaking more often.
[51:24] And Elijah was seeking this. Let that
[51:27] cook for just a minute. what I said.
[51:31] Let it cook that you can hear that still
[51:35] small voice just by reading your Bible.
[51:38] And you can do it whenever you want.
[51:40] Last night, Daniel came into my my
[51:43] office, my den after he got back from um
[51:46] from cleaning or from working here at
[51:48] the church.
[51:50] and he was um he told me he sat down in
[51:55] his chair and I sat I was sitting in
[51:57] mine and he said he said, "Dad, I read
[51:59] um this morning I read first John and
[52:01] first Timothy."
[52:04] And after a whole day of working at the
[52:06] church and how excited he was about
[52:08] everything that's going on and about all
[52:10] the instruments and all the music and
[52:12] all the carpet and all the excitement
[52:13] associated with the church, he was most
[52:16] excited. He wanted to talk to me about
[52:19] these scriptures that he had read that
[52:21] morning.
[52:23] It was still in the oven.
[52:26] The word was still cooking in Daniel. It
[52:31] was still moving.
[52:33] First John, here's what he read to me. 1
[52:36] John chapter 3 verse 9.
[52:40] He said, "No one born born born of God,
[52:44] no one I'll read the New King James
[52:47] Version. You can leave the Old King
[52:48] James up." No, I'm sorry. Daniel read
[52:50] the English Standard Version. And I'll
[52:52] read the English I'll read the English
[52:53] Standard Version here. 1 John chapter
[52:56] 3:9. No one born of God makes a practice
[53:00] of sinning. For God's seed abides in
[53:03] him, and he cannot keep on sinning
[53:05] because he has been born of God. By this
[53:08] it is evident who are the children of
[53:11] God and who are the children of devil of
[53:13] the devil. Whoever does not practice
[53:15] righteousness is not of God, nor is the
[53:17] one who does not love his brother.
[53:20] Daniel reads that to him and he says,
[53:21] "Dad," he says, "It is not okay to sin."
[53:26] He says it shows you who you are. And he
[53:29] says these ministries and and a lot of
[53:31] these these these contemporary churches,
[53:34] he says they say it's okay to sin just
[53:36] as long as you have a good heart and
[53:38] Jesus loves you no matter what you're
[53:40] doing. They are being they are deceiving
[53:42] the people. And Daniel's here preaching
[53:43] to me about this and he's saying, "Dad,
[53:45] it says right here in the word that it
[53:47] is not right that you separate yourself
[53:51] from God when you sin. When you make the
[53:53] choice to sin, now you have separated
[53:55] yourself from God. For this is the
[53:57] message that you have heard from the
[53:59] beginning that we should love one
[54:01] another. We should not be like Cain who
[54:04] was of that evil one and murdered his
[54:06] brother. Daniel's like, "Dad,
[54:09] remember this has been cooking all day."
[54:11] He woke up in the morning. Can you
[54:13] imagine always being in the word and
[54:16] this always being part of your day? He
[54:18] says, "Dad, Cain was of that evil one.
[54:22] He says, "Serpency
[54:25] doctrine."
[54:27] I said, "Yeah."
[54:31] 1 John chapter 4:9,
[54:33] Daniel continued on. He was flipping
[54:35] through his phone. He says, "In this,
[54:40] the love of God,
[54:43] in this the love of God was made
[54:45] manifest among us, that God sent his
[54:47] only son into the world, that we might
[54:50] live through him."
[54:52] In this is love, not that we have loved
[54:55] God, but that he loved us and sent his
[54:57] son to be the perpetuation of our sins.
[55:01] Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought
[55:03] also to love one another.
[55:06] No one has ever seen God. If we love one
[55:09] another, God abides in us and his love
[55:12] is perfected in us.
[55:15] By this we know that we abide in him and
[55:18] he in us because he has given us of his
[55:21] spirit, the Holy Spirit. And we ha and
[55:26] we have seen and testify that the father
[55:29] has sent his son to be the savior of the
[55:32] world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is
[55:34] the son of God, God abides in him and he
[55:38] in God.
[55:40] This was cooking all day in Daniel. And
[55:44] he was excited. He's like, "Dad, it's
[55:45] all about Jesus. The whole thing is
[55:47] about Jesus. It's all about if the son
[55:50] of God, whoever confesses that Jesus is
[55:53] the son of God, God abides in him. God
[55:56] dwelleth in him and he in God."
[56:00] If you just read these scriptures,
[56:02] friends, and let them cook for a little
[56:04] while. Really let it sink in. They were
[56:08] cooking in Daniel all day long. And it's
[56:11] the same word that Elijah was was
[56:14] seeking when he was on Mount Horeb. The
[56:18] same God speaking, the same God sending
[56:20] his word, the same God that was dealing
[56:22] with Daniel as he was just med just just
[56:25] rejoicing over these scriptures all day.
[56:27] It's the same God that spoke to Elijah.
[56:30] It's the same God that brought the fire
[56:31] down. It's the same God that brought the
[56:33] rain. It's the same God speaking. If we
[56:37] would just cook
[56:39] on his word.
[56:42] Now, let this put this in the oven for a
[56:45] minute. 1 Timothy 3:16.
[56:48] Listen to this.
[56:51] The Apostle Paul speaking, "All
[56:54] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[56:57] and is profitable for doctrine, for
[56:59] repo, reproof."
[57:02] I'm sorry, brothers. I gave you the
[57:04] wrong Try 2 Timothy
[57:08] 3:16.
[57:15] Yeah, there we go. I apologize. 2
[57:19] Timothy 3:16, "All scripture is given by
[57:21] inspiration of God, and is profitable
[57:23] for doctrine, for reproof, for
[57:25] correction, for instruction in
[57:27] righteousness, that the man of God may
[57:30] be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto
[57:33] all good works." What does that mean?
[57:36] He's talking about the word of God. He's
[57:37] talking about the Bible here. English
[57:39] Standard Version says this. All
[57:41] scripture is breathed out by God
[57:46] and profitable for teaching, for
[57:48] reprove, for correction, for training in
[57:49] righteousness, that the man of God may
[57:52] be complete,
[57:55] equipped for every good work.
[57:58] Think about that for a minute. All
[58:01] scripture is breathed out by God. I want
[58:05] to hear his voice. I always want to hear
[58:08] his voice. Yesterday, yesterday morning,
[58:11] I was up early and I was preparing for
[58:13] service this morning.
[58:16] And and I had a direction in going, but
[58:19] I was like, Lord, I I need to I need to
[58:21] refine this. I need to get it down. And
[58:23] every place that I would open my Bible
[58:24] and start reading, I was like, "Oh, wow.
[58:27] Oh, man. This is great." And I would
[58:30] read it for a little while and I would
[58:31] just sit back and I would just like,
[58:33] "Oh, this is this is incredible."
[58:37] And then I would go back and go to
[58:38] another scripture. I was like, "Oh, oh,
[58:41] this one's great." I could talk about
[58:43] every one of these. I could spend the
[58:45] whole sermon on just one of these
[58:47] scriptures. And here I am and I'm just
[58:48] trying to let one of them cook and I got
[58:50] all kinds of stuff in the oven and just
[58:53] loving it.
[58:56] Listen to this next scripture.
[58:58] Talk about
[59:00] growing and cooking in the Lord. Luke
[59:02] chapter 2 verse 52 says this, "And Jesus
[59:05] increased in wisdom and stature and in
[59:07] favor with God and man."
[59:10] This happened right after
[59:13] Jesus was 12 years old. He goes to the
[59:16] synagogue and all of these preachers are
[59:18] around like, "Wow, this kid is smart.
[59:21] This kid really knows the scripture."
[59:22] And they were all listening to this
[59:24] Jesus, this young man of 12 years old,
[59:27] expound on the scriptures. And they're
[59:29] listening like, "Wow, this guy, this
[59:31] kid's incredible." And then it wasn't
[59:34] until 18 years later that he started his
[59:37] ministry till he was 30 years old. And
[59:40] here he's 12.
[59:42] It had to cook for a while. The Bible
[59:46] says there, it says Jesus increased in
[59:48] wisdom and in stature and in favor with
[59:52] God and man.
[59:55] You imagine that the son of God, that
[59:59] scripture is amazing
[1:00:01] that the son of God had to get done. The
[1:00:06] son of God had to grow in the Lord. He
[1:00:10] grew in wisdom and he grew in stature.
[1:00:13] He got bigger and he grew in favor with
[1:00:16] God.
[1:00:18] How amazing is that? Now, let this one
[1:00:22] cook for a minute. I love these
[1:00:24] scriptures. I again, I could go on
[1:00:27] forever and ever on these.
[1:00:30] Before you make a hasty decision with
[1:00:32] someone, as I said earlier, remember the
[1:00:33] advice from my boss. James chapter 1
[1:00:36] verse verse 19 says this, "Wherefore, my
[1:00:40] beloved brethren, let Every man be swift
[1:00:44] to hear and slow to speak and slow to
[1:00:49] wrath, slow to anger, for wrath, for the
[1:00:52] wrath of man workketh not the
[1:00:55] righteousness of God.
[1:00:58] So when that anger wells up, when
[1:01:00] somebody offends you or something goes
[1:01:01] wrong, be swifty here,
[1:01:05] but slow to speak.
[1:01:08] Just let let that cook for a minute.
[1:01:10] when somebody maybe sets you aside and
[1:01:12] just let you have it, just stop.
[1:01:16] Just stop and keep in this mind, keep
[1:01:19] keep this in your mind. I'm just going
[1:01:21] to let that cook for a while. And then
[1:01:24] you'll find when that anger passes,
[1:01:29] then you'll be more able to address the
[1:01:32] situation. You'll be more able to speak.
[1:01:35] Here's another one. Listen to this.
[1:01:38] I was just having a wonderful time just
[1:01:40] reading all through the Bible.
[1:01:42] Philippians chapter 2
[1:01:44] verse one.
[1:01:49] If there be any consolation in Christ,
[1:01:53] if any comfort of love, if any
[1:01:55] fellowship of spirit, if any bowels of
[1:01:57] mercy, fulfill ye my joy that you be
[1:01:59] likeminded, having the same love, being
[1:02:02] of one accord and of one mind. The
[1:02:05] Apostle Paul to the to the church at
[1:02:07] Philippi, he's he's encouraging them to
[1:02:10] be in unity.
[1:02:12] Let nothing be done through strife or
[1:02:16] vain glory, but in loneliness of mind.
[1:02:19] Let each o let each esteem other better
[1:02:22] than themselves.
[1:02:24] Look not every man on his own things,
[1:02:27] but every man also on the things of
[1:02:30] others.
[1:02:31] Let that simmer for a minute.
[1:02:34] Do nothing, NIV says, do nothing out of
[1:02:37] selfish ambition or vain conceit.
[1:02:41] Rather, in humility, value others above
[1:02:43] yourselves, not looking to your own
[1:02:45] interest, but each of you to the
[1:02:48] interest of others. How many times do we
[1:02:50] say this is what I want. This is what
[1:02:54] pleases me. This is what and in other
[1:02:57] places, this is what promotes me. If you
[1:03:00] had people follow this, there are many
[1:03:02] people that I know that would be
[1:03:04] complete mute,
[1:03:06] that would never say a word because
[1:03:09] they're always either talking about
[1:03:10] themselves or or talking about what they
[1:03:13] want.
[1:03:15] But we should be talking about what
[1:03:17] glorifies God. We should be talking
[1:03:19] about what others want and trying to
[1:03:21] please God and doing nothing out of
[1:03:23] selfish ambition.
[1:03:25] Let this mind be in you, which was also
[1:03:29] in Christ, who being in the form of God,
[1:03:33] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:03:35] God, but made himself of no reputation,
[1:03:38] and took upon him the form of a servant,
[1:03:41] and was made in the likeness of men. And
[1:03:44] being found in the fashion in fashion as
[1:03:47] a man, he humbled himself and became
[1:03:49] obedient unto death, even the death of
[1:03:52] the cross.
[1:03:54] Think about that. Let it sink in.
[1:03:58] Who being in the form of God thought it
[1:03:59] not robbery to be equal with God?
[1:04:02] NIV is easier to understand. Did not
[1:04:05] consider equality with God something to
[1:04:08] be used for his own advantage.
[1:04:11] He took upon him the form of a servant
[1:04:13] and was made in the likeness of men. NIV
[1:04:17] says he made himself nothing by taking
[1:04:18] on the very nature of a servant. being
[1:04:21] made in human likeness. He humbled
[1:04:23] himself by becoming obedient to the
[1:04:26] death, even the death of the cross.
[1:04:28] Think about that.
[1:04:31] He was obedient to death, which means he
[1:04:33] didn't have to do it. When a child's
[1:04:37] obedient, that means they're doing what
[1:04:39] they're supposed to do. They don't have
[1:04:41] to do it. They can rebel and rebel. But
[1:04:44] Jesus was obedient. You think he wanted
[1:04:46] to do it? He said he didn't.
[1:04:49] But he was obedient to that calling.
[1:04:53] He didn't have to do it. Says right
[1:04:55] here, he didn't have to do it. But he
[1:04:57] went to the cross himself.
[1:05:00] Wherefore God hath highly exalted him
[1:05:03] and given him a name which is above
[1:05:04] every name. That the name of Jesus that
[1:05:07] that the name of Jesus every knee should
[1:05:10] bow of things in heaven and things in
[1:05:12] the earth and things under the earth.
[1:05:14] And that every tongue should confess
[1:05:16] that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[1:05:19] of the father. Every tongue should
[1:05:21] confess but it doesn't.
[1:05:24] But the Bible here it says it should
[1:05:28] confess.
[1:05:30] Think about that for a minute. This
[1:05:32] isn't written written about anyone else.
[1:05:35] It's not written about Moses. It's not
[1:05:36] written about Isaiah. It's not written
[1:05:38] about Joseph Smith with the Mormons.
[1:05:40] It's not written about Muhammad with the
[1:05:42] Muslims. is not written about Buddha
[1:05:44] with the Buddhists or even it's not even
[1:05:46] even written about Abraham
[1:05:48] for the Jews. It's written about one man
[1:05:51] and that's Jesus Christ.
[1:05:54] With all of this confusion, what Daniel
[1:05:56] was talking about last night on who I
[1:05:59] need to believe. Just let that cook on
[1:06:01] Jesus for a minute and let that cook on
[1:06:03] the scriptures
[1:06:05] for a minute. Galatians chapter 6
[1:06:09] verse 9 says this. And this as I was
[1:06:12] thinking about the scriptures, friend, I
[1:06:14] was thinking about this yesterday as we
[1:06:15] were all going and cleaning and and
[1:06:17] wiping down all the all the stuff and
[1:06:20] and getting everything ready for
[1:06:21] service. Listen to this. And let us not
[1:06:24] be weary and welloing
[1:06:26] for in due season we shall reap if we
[1:06:28] faint not. New Living Translation says,
[1:06:31] "And so let's not get tired of doing
[1:06:34] what is good.
[1:06:36] At just the right time, we will reap a
[1:06:38] harvest of blessings if we don't give
[1:06:41] up. That's how the meat cooks.
[1:06:45] Meat doesn't cook
[1:06:47] without you turning on the oven. You can
[1:06:50] take out the roast and it's cold out of
[1:06:52] the refrigerator and if you stick it in
[1:06:54] the oven, nothing will happen unless you
[1:06:57] put the heat to it. That's what we do.
[1:07:00] We put the heat to it just like Elijah
[1:07:02] did through prayer.
[1:07:04] And what it says right here, and in
[1:07:06] doing well and let it cook,
[1:07:12] let's go back to first Kings chapter 19.
[1:07:15] Let's go back to Elijah.
[1:07:17] Let's go to verse 11.
[1:07:24] And he said, "Go forth and stand upon
[1:07:26] the mount of the Lord."
[1:07:29] And behold, the Lord passed by,
[1:07:33] and a great and strong wind the
[1:07:36] mountains, and break in pieces the rocks
[1:07:39] before the Lord, but the Lord was not in
[1:07:41] the wind.
[1:07:43] And after the wind, an earthquake, but
[1:07:45] the Lord was not in the earthquake. And
[1:07:47] after the after the earthquake, a fire,
[1:07:49] but the Lord was not in the fire.
[1:07:54] Think about that for a little bit. He
[1:07:56] was seeking God. Elijah was seeking God
[1:07:59] and God passed by and there was a wind
[1:08:03] that ripped the rocks out this great
[1:08:06] powerful thing. Elijah was I'm sure
[1:08:08] praying and he's seeking God and in this
[1:08:10] great wind and he says but wait a minute
[1:08:12] Elijah had enough to him to say God
[1:08:14] wasn't in the wind.
[1:08:17] Then he continued to pray and then an
[1:08:20] earthquake came through. Can you imagine
[1:08:22] if you were praying and you were seeking
[1:08:25] the Lord and the walls started to shake
[1:08:27] and Elijah had enough to him that he
[1:08:29] knew that God was not in the earthquake
[1:08:33] and then a fire rolled through.
[1:08:38] There's a reason that this is written
[1:08:41] and it's a lesson and we need to be
[1:08:44] careful that we don't get caught up in
[1:08:46] the big things. We need to be careful
[1:08:48] that we don't get caught up in the
[1:08:50] noise. Those things are fine. If you
[1:08:54] want to shout and praise the Lord,
[1:08:55] that's good. But we need to be careful
[1:08:57] to say that that is the Holy Spirit. A
[1:08:59] lot of times the Holy Spirit comes down
[1:09:01] and we praise him and that's good. But
[1:09:03] we need to be careful in saying that
[1:09:05] that was the Holy Spirit.
[1:09:08] Elijah here, I mean, that's not as much
[1:09:10] as an earthquake
[1:09:12] or a tornado
[1:09:14] or a great forest fire.
[1:09:18] And Elijah knew that God wasn't in any
[1:09:21] of those.
[1:09:24] And after the earthquake of fire, but
[1:09:27] the Lord was not in the fire. And after
[1:09:30] the fire, a still small voice.
[1:09:36] Talk about seeing signs.
[1:09:39] I mean,
[1:09:40] I don't think any of us have witnessed
[1:09:42] signs like Elijah saw
[1:09:45] in the wind. It was a great wind. It
[1:09:48] must have been like a tornado come down
[1:09:51] in the earthquake and in the fire.
[1:09:55] But he knew there was something more.
[1:09:59] And it was a still small voice that
[1:10:02] spoke to Elijah.
[1:10:05] Friends,
[1:10:08] God gives us his word.
[1:10:11] And if we would just read that word and
[1:10:15] then sit and cook on it for a while like
[1:10:18] Daniel did all day long. Start your day
[1:10:22] with it. Listen to it. As I said, Elijah
[1:10:25] may have had a a few scrolls maybe from
[1:10:28] Moses, but the Philippians say that all
[1:10:32] of the scripture
[1:10:34] is breathed out of the mount of mouth of
[1:10:36] God.
[1:10:38] So, what does this book, this Bible,
[1:10:40] what does it mean to you? You can go
[1:10:42] into a cave in the wilderness or you can
[1:10:46] sit in your living room with a cup of
[1:10:48] coffee and read it
[1:10:50] and just cook like Elijah cooked. Mature
[1:10:55] like Elijah matured. Mature in the word
[1:10:58] that was breathed out of the mouth of
[1:11:01] God
[1:11:04] again after the earthquake of fire. But
[1:11:05] the Lord was not in the fire. after the
[1:11:07] fire, a still small voice.
[1:11:12] Tremendous. The musicians can come and
[1:11:15] we'll close.
[1:11:17] I just I'm just going to read
[1:11:20] a few a few scriptures. I just want I
[1:11:23] just want you to be blessed by this word
[1:11:25] that again what I'm reading. The Bible
[1:11:29] says it was breathed out of the mouth of
[1:11:31] God. It's not me speaking.
[1:11:35] Jesus said, "But seek ye first the
[1:11:37] kingdom of God and his righteousness,
[1:11:39] and all these things will be added to
[1:11:41] you." Hebrews 11:6 says, "Whoever will
[1:11:46] draw near to God must believe that he
[1:11:49] exists and that he reward rewards those
[1:11:52] who seek him." 1 Chronicles says, "Seek
[1:11:55] the Lord and his strength. Seek his
[1:11:58] presence continually."
[1:12:01] Jeremiah says, the Lord says, "You will
[1:12:04] seek me and find me when you seek me
[1:12:09] with all your heart."
[1:12:11] Can you imagine? Let that sink in for
[1:12:14] just a minute. I know I'm reading a lot
[1:12:17] of them. You can just take one of them
[1:12:19] and just think on it all day long. Pick
[1:12:22] one that I've been saying. Proverbs
[1:12:25] says, "I love those who love me,
[1:12:29] and those who seek me diligently find
[1:12:32] me."
[1:12:34] James chapter 4 says, "Draw near to God,
[1:12:37] and he will draw near to you."
[1:12:41] So Elijah is seeking God, and somehow
[1:12:45] someway he knew that that still small
[1:12:47] voice was speaking to that was speaking
[1:12:50] to him was the voice of God. And my
[1:12:53] favorite thing about this whole story
[1:12:57] is what James says about Elijah. So
[1:13:00] Elijah was the man that that brought the
[1:13:02] the fire down from heaven, consumed the
[1:13:04] the sacrifice. He was the one that
[1:13:07] prayed after three and a half years of
[1:13:10] drought. He's the one that prayed that
[1:13:12] brought the the rain. And he is the one
[1:13:15] that was up in that cave and he was
[1:13:17] seeking God. And he was the one that
[1:13:19] didn't get caught up in all the emotion.
[1:13:21] didn't get caught up in all of the
[1:13:23] different talking and all the different
[1:13:24] doctrines. He He didn't get caught up in
[1:13:26] that. And he heard that still small
[1:13:28] voice. This is one of the greatest
[1:13:31] prophets that has ever lived. This man
[1:13:34] Elijah.
[1:13:37] And my favorite part about the whole
[1:13:39] story is what someone else says about
[1:13:43] James chapter 5
[1:13:47] says this. El Elias Elijah was a man
[1:13:51] subject to like passions as we are
[1:13:54] which means he was a man
[1:13:57] which means he was a normal person.
[1:14:00] He was just like any of us and yet he
[1:14:04] prayed the first time and it didn't rain
[1:14:07] for three and a half years. He prayed
[1:14:08] the second time and it came sto came
[1:14:11] thunderstorms and and and and rain and
[1:14:15] the the fire came down from heaven.
[1:14:17] these great miracles. Yet he was a man
[1:14:19] like me. He was a human being like every
[1:14:23] person in this room.
[1:14:26] Verse number 13.
[1:14:29] First
[1:14:32] Kings chapter 9 19.
[1:14:35] And it was so
[1:14:37] when Elijah heard it, that still small
[1:14:41] voice. He can speak to us friends in the
[1:14:44] same way. We live below
[1:14:47] our calling. All of us do.
[1:14:50] And it was so when Elijah heard it that
[1:14:52] he wrapped his face in his mantel and he
[1:14:54] went out and stood in the entering of
[1:14:56] the cave. And behold, there came a voice
[1:15:00] unto him and said again,
[1:15:05] "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
[1:15:08] Same question as before. But now Elijah
[1:15:11] had let let these things cook for a
[1:15:13] while. And now God gives him
[1:15:15] instructions on what to do,
[1:15:18] on how to end the reign of Ahab and
[1:15:21] Jezebel, his mortal en enemies, and who
[1:15:25] to anoint as a prophet that would
[1:15:27] succeed him, this man Elisha.
[1:15:34] And then he says, Elijah,
[1:15:37] you know, you say that you're the only
[1:15:39] one. You think that you're the only one,
[1:15:41] Elijah. Remember,
[1:15:44] we are like Elijah. James said that. He
[1:15:47] says, "You think you're the only one."
[1:15:49] Maybe you think you're the only one that
[1:15:51] struggles with certain things. Or maybe
[1:15:52] you think that you're the only one
[1:15:54] that's doing right. Maybe you think that
[1:15:56] you're the only one who knows what's
[1:15:59] right to do in all cases. Maybe that's
[1:16:01] the way that you're thinking. That's the
[1:16:03] way Elijah was thinking. I'm the only
[1:16:04] one, right? And you know what God says?
[1:16:07] Verse number 18,
[1:16:10] he says this. He says, "Yet," he says,
[1:16:12] "You think you're the only one, Elijah?
[1:16:14] Yet I have left me 7,000
[1:16:18] in Israel, all the knees which have not
[1:16:21] bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which
[1:16:24] has not kissed him." Elijah, you're not
[1:16:27] all that.
[1:16:28] Elijah, you're struggling,
[1:16:31] and you think you're the only one, but
[1:16:33] I've got 7,000, which was a lot at that
[1:16:37] time,
[1:16:39] friends.
[1:16:41] Let these things cook.
[1:16:45] Pause.
[1:16:47] Be quick to hear
[1:16:50] and slow to speak
[1:16:53] and slow to anger.
[1:16:56] Just pause.
[1:16:59] Don't go buy the car. Don't get on
[1:17:01] Amazon and say, "You know what? I want
[1:17:04] that." And hit the buy button. Let it
[1:17:07] cook for a little bit.
[1:17:09] Just wait.
[1:17:12] Especially you young people
[1:17:15] and you're choosing a mate.
[1:17:18] Just wait.
[1:17:21] I know that you want to move quickly.
[1:17:23] And remember I said you can overcook the
[1:17:25] roast. Don't do that. But let it get
[1:17:29] done first. And in making any decision,
[1:17:32] all of us,
[1:17:35] let the roast get finished. Don't take
[1:17:37] it out of the fridge. Like I told
[1:17:38] Daniel, take a big bite out of the raw
[1:17:40] meat. It's not good.
[1:17:43] But if it's done perfectly, then it's
[1:17:45] really good. It's perfection. And that's
[1:17:47] what God has for us. If we will hear
[1:17:50] that still small voice, and you can hear
[1:17:53] it every day.
[1:17:56] Open up your Bible in the morning, read
[1:17:59] something, anything, and then cook on it
[1:18:02] all day, and it'll bless you. Think
[1:18:04] about those scriptures all day. It'll
[1:18:06] bless you. It will come back to your
[1:18:08] remembrance when you need it. That's a
[1:18:11] promise
[1:18:13] if you stay in the word all the time.
[1:18:18] and just continuing rejoicing on the
[1:18:22] scriptures and then
[1:18:25] everything all of the big stuff can be
[1:18:28] going all around you and all of these
[1:18:30] things happening and all of this stuff
[1:18:32] was going on with Elijah and he's like
[1:18:34] yeah the the Lord's not in the wind the
[1:18:36] Lord's not in the earthquake the Lord's
[1:18:38] not in the fire but he was in that voice
[1:18:41] as well
[1:18:44] and we are like him. Amen.
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; My life be glorified.
[1:18:56] Would you stand and sing with us?
[1:18:59] In
[1:19:01] my
[1:19:04] life,
[1:19:06] Lord
[1:19:09] be glorified.
[1:19:14] Be glorified

[1:19:32] today.
[1:19:33] [Music]
[1:19:35] Yes,

[1:19:50] Be glorified
[1:19:55] in

[1:19:59] life.
[1:20:01] Lord
[1:20:04] be glorified
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; today. Let's all agree together and say
[1:20:10] in this church.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, in
[1:20:15] your
[1:20:17] church
[1:20:20] Lord
[1:20:22] be glorified.
[1:20:27] Be glorified.
[1:20:31] in
[1:20:34] your
[1:20:36] church,
[1:20:38] Lord,
[1:20:41] be glorified
[1:20:45] today. Let's sing that again as a prayer
[1:20:47] together.
[1:20:49] Lord, yes in
[1:20:52] your
[1:20:55] church,
[1:20:57] Lord
[1:20:59] be glorified.
[1:21:04] Be glorified
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:09] in
[1:21:10] your
[1:21:12] church,
[1:21:15] Lord.
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:18] be glorified.
[1:21:22] Let's sing. In everything I say and do.
[1:21:25] Oh yes. In everything
[1:21:30] that I say
[1:21:33] and do,
[1:21:36] be glorified.
[1:21:40] Be glorified
[1:21:43] in everything I say. In everything that
[1:21:48] I say and do, I say
[1:21:51] and do
[1:21:54] be glorified
[1:21:56] [Music]
[1:21:58] today. Let's just sing in my life, Lord.
[1:22:02] Oh
[1:22:05] my
[1:22:07] life.
[1:22:09] Lord
[1:22:11] be glorified.
[1:22:16] Be glorified
[1:22:20] in
[1:22:23] my
[1:22:25] life.
[1:22:27] Glory
[1:22:31] glorified
[1:22:34] today.
[1:22:35] Let's bow our heads.
[1:22:41] Think on these things.
[1:22:47] The Apostle John said,
[1:22:51] he said, 'Beloved,
[1:22:53] believe not every spirit,
[1:22:56] but try the spirits whether they have
[1:22:58] are of God, because many false prophets
[1:23:01] are gone out into the world. Hereby know
[1:23:04] ye the spirit of God. Every spirit that
[1:23:08] confessth that Jesus Christ is come in
[1:23:10] the flesh is of God. And every spirit
[1:23:13] that confesseth not that Jesus Christ
[1:23:16] has come in the flesh is not of God.
[1:23:19] And this is the spirit of Antichrist.
[1:23:22] Whereof ye have heard that it should
[1:23:25] come and even now already is in the
[1:23:27] world.
[1:23:29] You're of God, little children,
[1:23:32] and have overcome them because greater
[1:23:34] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:23:37] the world.
[1:23:40] He says, he continues on. He says,
[1:23:42] "Beloved, let us not love one another.
[1:23:46] Let us love one another. For love is of
[1:23:49] God, and everyone that loveth is born of
[1:23:52] God and knoweth God. He that loveth not
[1:23:55] knoweth not God, for God is love."
[1:24:00] It is this in this was manifested the
[1:24:03] love of God toward us because that God
[1:24:06] sent his only begotten son into the
[1:24:09] world that we might live through him
[1:24:13] here in his hearing love not that we
[1:24:16] loved God but that he loved us and sent
[1:24:20] his son to be the perpetuation
[1:24:23] of our sins.
[1:24:27] Father, we're grateful,
[1:24:30] Lord, that you have given us
[1:24:33] this holy Bible
[1:24:36] that we might, Lord, meditate on these
[1:24:38] scriptures and, Father, get to know you
[1:24:42] better by your word.
[1:24:45] And Lord, that
[1:24:47] we could have, Father, what I'm sure
[1:24:50] everyone in the his in history has
[1:24:52] desired to have. And that is, Lord, to
[1:24:55] be able to hear that still small voice
[1:24:57] every day,
[1:25:00] Lord, knowing that you are your word,
[1:25:05] Father. Whenever we read that word, it
[1:25:07] is you speaking to us. We're grateful.
[1:25:10] Thank you, Father, for the story of
[1:25:12] Elijah
[1:25:13] and that still small voice
[1:25:16] and how that mighty man
[1:25:20] could discern
[1:25:23] what was just the wind or just a
[1:25:26] fire or just an earthquake.
[1:25:29] And Lord, what meant the most to him was
[1:25:31] that still small voice. We thank you.
[1:25:34] Bless each one today.
[1:25:38] Father, may we draw closer to you
[1:25:41] continually,
[1:25:43] looking forward to that great coming of
[1:25:46] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in
[1:25:49] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:25:53] Kad nothing without you.
[1:25:57] Take these hands
[1:26:01] and lift them up.
[1:26:06] For I have not the strength to praise
[1:26:09] you near enough.
[1:26:12] [Music]
[1:26:14] For I am nothing.
[1:26:19] I have nothing
[1:26:23] without you. Let's sing that again. Take
[1:26:26] these hands.
[1:26:29] Oh, take these hands
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:35] and lift them up.
[1:26:39] For I have not the strength to praise
[1:26:43] you near enough.
[1:26:47] For I am nothing.
[1:26:51] Oh, I have nothing
[1:26:56] without you. Take my voice. Sing. Take
[1:26:59] my voice.
[1:27:02] Oh, and take my voice
[1:27:08] and pour it out.
[1:27:12] Let it sing the songs of mercy I have
[1:27:16] found.
[1:27:20] For I have nothing.
[1:27:24] I am nothing
[1:27:28] without you. Let's sing. All my soul.
[1:27:34] Oh, and all my soul
[1:27:41] needs
[1:27:42] is all your love
[1:27:47] to cover me.
[1:27:50] So the world
[1:27:56] will see
[1:27:58] that I
[1:28:00] have nothing
[1:28:04] without you. Take my body.
[1:28:10] Oh, and take my body
[1:28:15] and build it up.
[1:28:19] May it be broken as an offering
[1:28:24] of love.
[1:28:27] For I have nothing.
[1:28:31] No, I have nothing
[1:28:36] without you. Sing all my soul.
[1:28:41] Oh, and all my soul
[1:28:48] needs
[1:28:50] is all your love
[1:28:55] to cover me.
[1:28:58] So all
[1:29:00] the world
[1:29:03] will see
[1:29:06] that I
[1:29:08] have nothing
[1:29:09] [Music]
[1:29:11] without you. Take my time here on this
[1:29:14] earth.
[1:29:17] Oh Lord, take my time
[1:29:22] here on this earth
[1:29:27] and let it glorify
[1:29:30] all that you are worth.
[1:29:34] For I am nothing.
[1:29:38] No, I am nothing
[1:29:43] without you. Let's sing that again. Make
[1:29:45] that your dedication to the Lord this
[1:29:47] morning. Oh, take
[1:29:51] my time
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:54] here on this earth.
[1:29:59] Let it glorify
[1:30:02] all that you are worth.
[1:30:05] Lord, for I am nothing.
[1:30:11] No, I'm nothing.
[1:30:15] without you.
[1:30:18] For all my soul.
[1:30:21] For all my soul
[1:30:28] needs.
[1:30:29] is all your love
[1:30:34] to cover me.
[1:30:37] So all the world
