turned in Mr Nina the Aaron's daughter wasn't feeling well so let's just remember her in prayer Also let's remember all the saints and Believers in the Florida and Coastline there with the hurricanes and all the different things that is going through the weather events and so forth there's many places that go through a lot of different situations so let's remember each one of them the Lord would grant them mercy and Grace and you might think well that's just the will of the Lord of a storm coming through but Jesus got up in the edge of the boat and said peace be still and he just he just stopped and I think of brother Green's testimony there where he woke up in the middle of the night in British Columbia with brother Branham and he heard brother Brandon praying he said he didn't think brother Brandon knew he was awake or she don't know but Brandon was praying there and he said Lord he said if brother if Perry knew that this that hurricane was coming off the coast of Texas there and his little children were his wife were in in danger he would be all worried Lord but you can just take that storm and send it back out and make it avoid the the coast and they got back two weeks later they're in the middle of British Columbia where there's no internet of course in 1960s and whatnot but they get him back and brother green found out the storm had come right up to the coastline and then just turned around and went back right out into the ocean so Lord can protect us for all the different situations we're in amen amen and even if we go through a storm he's with us amen let's stand this morning and ask brother Merle bag it if you would just come take what needs that we did Express this morning I'm sure each one of us have a an unspoken need this morning brother Merle if

have need of just have total preeminence we pray we'll give you all the glory and the honor for you alone are worthy no flesh or glory in your presence Lord but only you let it be this morning we pray in Jesus name amen amen let's let's turn to Genesis chapter 3. it's really good to see everybody out here on a thank you musicians on a Sunday morning here to honor the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ he's not dead but he's living he's risen he took my place he took your place and so we can have life and we can have freedom today amen so it's a good day and it's good to be here let's just read here in Genesis 3 and 14. and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and let's go to Mark 16 while you're standing in verse 15. we'll read down to verse 18 Mark 16 and 15. and he said unto them just wait a wait a second here and he said unto them I believe he's not just speaking to them but I believe these are still current words these are still relevant words these are still true words he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them with that believe in my name shall they cast out devils you say Amen they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it should not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen God bless you you may be seated I've got a lot of a lot of things that I like to say today but just pray for me that the Lord will help help me and believe that he has something good for us today but uh I hate snakes I think that's a good thing I think you know some people get real friendly to them and maybe that's okay for some people in some circumstances but I hate snakes and yesterday there was a really nice tea party I hear that I was not invited to but that's okay I hear it was good for those that were invited and I'm glad for that and I think those um if I understand right the intention of this was this was a way that the sisters could serve one another and I think that's a beautiful thing I think to to be able to show one another you're you're worth investing time and effort and love into I think that's a beautiful thing and so I'm not even hurt that I wasn't invited that's fine but I was um I got to spend some time with my boys because they weren't invited either and so what we wanted we uh we had to go spend some time and I didn't really get a chance to plan ahead so there I'm sitting outside of the church on my phone well what's going on in Tucson today and what I found that was going on in Tucson today was a exhibition with reptiles and amphibians so me and the three boys said let's go see what reptiles and amphibians we can see so we drove over to the Expo Center and I'd never been to one of these things but I found myself in a big room full of more snakes than I've ever thought about in my life every kind of snake every kind of snake lover there and just all these snakes and all these containers all these little tupperwares all these little plastic containers and so it got me thinking about snakes and what was amazing to me snakes can be small or big but what's amazing to me is how little the containers were that these snakes would fit into you'd have a big old a couple foot snake just in this little thing that's I'd rather add cookies inside which is this little little thing you have this big old snake but it'd be all curled up and and hidden and so if you wanted to you could these a lot of these snakes were for sale hundreds of dollars for these snakes so if you wanted to you could have a big old coat you could buy this snake and that snake and this snake and that snake and you could go out of there with 100 snakes all hidden in your coat I mean these things are collapsible these things are hidable these things are are pocket size for your convenience but I hate snakes and there's a there's an enmity between this serpent in the Garden of Eden and between the sons of God and the daughters of God and we've got Authority we've got power over snakes which is good because I hate snakes but the biggest snake I know is the devil and he was a snake in Genesis and he's a snake all the way to revelation and he's a lion deceiving nasty snake worse than the pythons worse than the Rattlers and he's trying to kill the life out of the Church of God out of those that are are born to be like Jesus he's trying to to kill the life out of that and uh he's pretty good at what he does you know we're not ignorant of his devices we know how he works but I was listening to uh I was listening to a sermon of brother green and he was referencing another sermon where this man got up in a church and he said there's no one like Jesus and everyone said hey man that's right they got excited they said that's a shame we ought to be like Jesus that's that's what this Resurrection is about is that it's not just a resurrection for one but it's a resurrection of many that he's the firstborn among many Brethren and that although he was the only perfect man that could step on all the snakes that could walk above sin it's not going to stay that way but there's coming what the scripture talks about a manifestation of the sons of God that they're going to be just like him and all the way back in in Genesis when God was right in his first Bible in the sky he made two two lights a greater light to Rule the Day in a lesser night light to rule the night and that lesser light has got no light of its own the Moon but it reflects that same original light that same light that shined forth when God separated the light from the darkness and and he started to make this Earth beautiful and bring life to it that same light is what we see in the Moon and I was thinking that you know we've got this promise in Malachi and to you that fear my name the son of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings see the sun rises to those that fear his name right now the world doesn't see that light of the Gospel that light of righteousness the son of righteousness but where that Moon that that we see it it's risen to us the fear his name is this son of righteousness has risen and we've we're being healed by this healing that's in his wings we're being healed in our bodies in our minds in our spirits in our walk we're being healed we're seeing that and as as we bathe in that light from the sun that's not visible here on Earth we reflect that out that those that can't see that sun yet they can see the moon they can see your light and they can know that there is a God you know one of these so these snakes we've got power over them but we could still be bitten these things still come after us we've got our Our Big Brother Paul he was not on an island making a fire and this Viper came in it it got him the power of God didn't keep this Viper uh you know whatever the kova distance 6 10 whatever feet that is you know we'd like that oh no sin in my bubble no snakes no vipers in my bubble no pain but that's not the way it works we're in a battle we're in a fight and these snakes are going to come at us this snake bit him and it probably hurt sin hurts but he had the authority to shake that thing off in the fire and it didn't hurt him so this these uh these these snakes are these Whispering lies of the devil these things that are meant to destroy your faith to destroy your spiritual life and they'll come they'll attack you there's there's two hundred thousand thousand Devils were told that you know that they're not just sitting around but they're busy they're trying to see what they can do who they can bite and one one came to me last night I was trying to study and these doubts come oh well how do you know this how do you know that you know anytime you make a move towards God God will make a move towards you but the devil will also try to stop that they'll try to get in there anywhere he can and so these doubts come well how do you know this is true how do you know this is true and the way that I believe the Lord helped me to shake that thing off in the fire was I thought well how do I know this is true what what do I have that that shows me that this is more than just stories more than just Fables and I thought well let let me see what testimonies I can think on is there any light that I can look to in my day and I watched I was able to to pull up a testimony brother Dwayne Lawson some of the things that he's seen and you know I've sat down to eat with him I've been rock climbing with him I know him to be a faithful Witness and I was able to see God just doing things in his life that at that moment in this fight I couldn't see the sun but I could see the moon I could see that somebody's life was bearing witness of this gospel saying this is true and when we come to church and we come like Jesus and we've come with love in our hearts and we serve one another and we lay down our lives for one another your ministry you're showing that light of the Sun and that light is is a healing light it delivers us but I'm I hate snakes I hate sin because of what it does you know the devil's plan is to have you walk walk around carrying a whole bunch of snakes hidden in your coat somewhere hidden in your pants your shoes whatever your backpack but God's plan for you is to be free to be free not just from Death the end result but to be free from sin that you don't have to be bound up in these say oh it's just a bad habit or you know we make excuses for these things well Nobody's Perfect that's not true the Christian is meant to be perfect in Christ through the shed blood through the Holy Ghost that's where we're going I'm not there yet but that's where I'm going that's where you're going if you'll if you'll endure to the end if you'll keep holding on that's where we're going I believe the Lord wants to set us free from these snakes that we carry around these sins I want so the the the title of my sermon today is power over sin and it comes with a question what will you do with the snake we have power over sin we have the ability to take up serpents but then what we do with the snake it's up to us Paul had this snake on his hand he could have taken it home fed it showed his friends enjoyed this snake or I could throw it in the fire and that's up to you you've been given power to loose the serpent to bind the serpent what are you going to do and it skip all the way to the end do you want to be healed do you want to be free of these snakes or do you want to keep carrying them around and you say well I don't have any snakes in my life well sir Maybe let's let's search our heart let's see is there something that's eating away that life something that's choking out the moving of the spirit in my own life I believe there's things that the Lord's helping me to to fight to get rid of I believe we all have these fights and we we need to we need to get rid of these snakes we were driving along on Friday we saw this this site that would just tug at your heart and it was these two little dogs running around on the road running around free and oh the way your heart Wells up these dogs are gonna get run over if no one gets them to their owner and I thought you know we're so concerned and we stopped and prayed and and oh these these poor dogs they're they're running around in the street they're in danger but we need to have that concern for so many people we see are playing in the street they're running around sin has separated them from the one that cares for them the one that will keep them from danger and that that's what sin does it gets gets these these Souls out there where they're helpless and so it's not just this oh it's a little pet snake but you can't take fire into your bosom and not be burned sin is going to take you farther than you want to go and you get your first snake and it's it's a little gardener snake this thing's pretty harmless nobody ever ever got bit by one of these then it grows and then it's taking more of your time and more of your food and this is this is something in your life and then we can't have just one snake all these all these snake enthusiasts there I don't think any of them had one snake they all had tables full because you get one and then you get another one you get another one and then these ones are boring so you've got to get one a little bit more exciting you've got to get one that's got a little bit more power to it you've got to get something that's uh and it grows and it grows the next thing you know your legion you're bound just with so many big snakes that didn't start out that big but whatever you feed is going to grow and whatever you think on is going to grow in your life in your mind whatever you give your your affections to it's going to be more and more of your life but we had one that came down where none of us could none of us could beat these snakes but we had the one that came down to bruise the head of the snake with Jesus Christ come in the flesh and die on Calvary that he was sin judged he was that snake lifted up that brass serpent that he became sin for us though he knew no sin that we could become the righteousness of God and that's the gospel if the gospel that we're preaching is not a gospel that lets us become the righteousness of God that lets us overcome these snakes in our lives then it's not this original gospel that Paul preached but we're called to be Overcomers I don't want to have any pet snakes I remember when I was in Sunday School long time ago and and the kids would come in and they're talking about their Pokemons the little pocket devils and I said that's wrong we don't talk about that in church and still still true what what are the things that we talk about after church are we talking about how good God is we're talking about the scriptures or we're talking about lost souls we're talking about eternal things were we talking about some some devil that we hold in our pocket to the end of church and then that's all we've been thinking about anyway say and it could be something that looks pretty harmless no it's just fishing just golfing it's just thrifting just whatever it is but if that's taking our time our thoughts our affections is that choking the life out of us and isn't it just another pocket devil but because he lives we live also because he overcame we overcome too and all All Through the Bible God has showed that he has authority over these things and not just he has Authority but a man a woman that surrendered to him also has authority over these things we've got Moses the Egyptians worshiped snakes raw their big sun god he was a snake and here's the miracle with with Moses not just that he threw a stick down it became a snake but he could take that thing up and make it on a snake he had power to bind power to loose he could bind that thing back into a snake I think that's the greater Miracle just to go stick to snake that's pretty great but that's um that's only part of it but can you take a snake and turn it into a stick I think of of Joshua and the promise given to him every place that the soul of your foot will tread upon that I've given to you and so we know footsteps are possession if there's this promised land that we're supposed to walk into but how Joshua taught about this this the Practical lab application of of footsteps or possession he had these men of Israel these captains of the men of War put their foot on the necks of Kings stand on them it's not just about walking through a picnic but it's this is my enemy this is that which is trying to kill my family this is that which is taking my land I'm gonna put my foot on his neck and we're gonna kill him and God's still the same his plan then his plan now total victory not just walking through the land and these guys can stay but no let's kill them because if you don't kill them they're going to kill you we don't make friends with the Enemy but this is this is a Time to be totally separate from the things of the world I don't know why anyone would keep a snake in in Romans well let's go to uh let's go to John 8 and 31 we're talking about being free this morning he set me free he set me free but let's walk into it let's let that be more than a song but let's not be let that be a power in our lives then said Jesus to these Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed we've got to continue in it we we hear John 3 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him would not perish but have everlasting life amen that is true but let's continue in it let's see what else Jesus taught because he taught a lot and he doesn't do anything in vain so if everything we needed to know was in John 3 16 that's all he would have given but he gave us more instruction he said in verse 32 ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free if you want to be free today of these snakes if you really want to be whole of these things that are are trying to bind you up we have to know the truth the Bible talks about a group of people that are ever learning but they never come to the knowledge of the truth because the truth is a person that's not how much you you can figure this things out but it's do you know Jesus Christ to know him is life and if we're just learning and we just have doctrines added in this and that no this is a nice Revelation in this will still be bound up we'll never be totally free but if we'll know Jesus Christ the person if we'll walk with him that's the eternal life that's how when we believe on him we don't go into the Judgment but we've passed from death and I is to know him as life amen the Jews answered him we be Abraham's seat we were never in bondage to any man snakes are tricky these guys are all tied up and they said no no we're free man how safe thou ye shall be made free watch it It's Tricky but here's what Jesus says I'm so glad we have his words his words are spirit and their life verse 34 Jesus answered them verily verily I say to you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin that was true when he said it and it's true now if we're still bound up committing these sins we're still the servants of sin the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed do you want to be free only he can do it but he has given us that Authority that if we walk in faith we will overcome Romans 6 16. says know ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but God we think that you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which is delivered from you delivered you being then made free from sin you're become the Servants of righteousness I believe that I believe that we're being made free from sin that this is the work of God in our lives that he finished the work at Calvary but we're still seeing the manifestation that were were becoming the Servants of righteousness there's a growth in a Christian's life there's the Lord has allowed these things like like the brother was talking last week about the winds that allow the roots to go deeper God didn't just empty the promised land of all these these Hittites and jebusites and everything but he let the let the sons of God go and fight for because it was good for them it was something that they needed to grow roots to go seek the Lord to grow down deepen in Christ and so if you say well you said I was free you said go go step on the snake and I'm still wrestling with it I'll keep wrestling just believe just keep holding on to the promises of God we must fight if we must win increase my courage Lord let us be courageous sons and daughters they're going to say well I went and tried it and and I I fell again no the righteous man falls seven times but he rises again he says no that's my land that's my inheritance I'm gonna fight for that you go down I'll get back up it's worth fighting for of of whom a man has overcome the same he's brought into bondage but where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty if we can just get in that Spirit of the Lord there's liberty there there's Freedom there that you can Worship the Lord and spirit and the truth because he has set us free he has taken the The Sting of death he overcame but Jesus is in need of a free people that's quite a statement to say well he's he owns the cattle on a thousand hills how can you say he needs something let's go to Luke 19. and 29. Luke 19 and 29 and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage and Bethany to the Mount called the Mount of Olives he sent two of his disciples saying go ye into the village over against you in which that you're entering you shall find a cult tide whereon never yet man sat loose him and bring him hither and if a man asks you why do you loose him thus shall you say unto him because the Lord hath needed him and they that were sent with their way and found it even as he had said unto them look at this though loose him for the Lord half need of him this is just I don't know if this was a cult or a donkey but this wasn't some race winning racehorse this was one that nobody ever sat on before but Jesus needed this cult because there was a prophecy that the Lord Jesus had said it's going to be this way and so it had to be that way if there was no prophecy he wouldn't have needed it right if there's no prophecy he could have just walked he could have done whatever but he said this is the way it's going to be and that's the way it had to be he's done the same thing in our day he said it's going to come like this there's going to be many songs brought to Glory there's going to be a bride without spot or wrinkle that's made herself ready so now because of the prophecy God needs somebody to fulfill that prophecy and we can't fulfill that prophecy if we're all bound up if we're still tied up this quote could say yes yes I'm gonna I'm gonna be the best cult I can but until that cult was loosed it could not do what was prophesied of it and until we'll be loosed of these things that are trying so hard to bind us how can we fulfill these Prophecies of us same thing with Lazarus he was risen from the dead but he was all bound up Jesus said loose him and let them go amen so that's what that's why we stay in the word that's why we we've come to church is because it is this word that looses us it's the hearing of this word that has the power to to let us walk on those snakes to defeat sin and have power over it there is a great work for us to do in John 14 12 Jesus said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father that's why we're here that's why we were born that's why we were born again is to do the works that he did and so we don't have the case we've got okay the the groom he's into destroying the works of the devil and he came to seek and save that which was lost and that's what he's about and then we've got the bride and she's into fill in the blank whatever other thing no her mission is his mission whatever his heart's about that's what her heart's about Jesus said and he's our example he's our perfect example he said I must be about my father's business he did nothing but what he saw the father doing and that's what the son did likewise and that's what we're supposed to be say father what are you doing because that's what I want to do that's what I need to do that's why I'm here that's how I can be this lesser light to rule the night these 11th Hour workers I believe we're we might be the 11 11th hour or 45 minute workers what were they doing they were working the same work that had been going on all day God's not doing some totally different work at the end although there are differences but the work is still the same I believe he's changing the laborers but I believe the work is the same that if we're about our father's business we're about destroying the works of the devil about seeking and saving that which was lost Jesus said the Harvest is plentiful but the workers are few and I think a lot of times we get we get discouraged one of the promises about about Jesus about the Messiah was that he would not be discouraged that can be our promise too we're part of him and sometimes we get discouraged and say well there's nobody out there they wouldn't listen you know we're all coming Jesus said that the Harvest is plentiful it's the workers that are few should pray that Lord sends workers Lord send us use us whatever it is we get so focused on the 99. but God's heart is for the one that's gone astray more than the 99 that that never left God's heart is for that one lost sheep that gone astray and there's more rejoicing of that one sheep that comes back and comes and gets the snakes pulled off then of 99 people said well we're still here we're still doing pretty good we're still holy and righteous that's not where God's heart is God's heart is where is that lost one running around on the road where is that one that's going to get plastered by sin if somebody doesn't reach down in love and show the light of that son of righteousness and say there's healing in his wings he cares for you you don't have to live like this you don't have to see sin is gruesome and bad and we we make excuses for it but there was a king in Israel that send I forget his name but the last thing he saw before his eyes were put out were his sons be killed before him and that's what sin always does is that as we sin we fail the ones that we love and we'll watch them die spiritually but even if that's happened he is the resurrection and the life though a man be dead yet can he live if we'll believe on him The Works that I do shall you do also we have power to bind power to lose but if we don't use that power to loose it will be too bound up to do anything but the Lord has need of a free people he's a man of war and so we're called to be like him we're called to be a people of War this is in Exodus it says the Lord is a man of Hope of war the Lord is his name we're Fighters we're snake Stompers in Ezekiel I was reading and the Lord shows the prophets all these snakes that are going on in the church says come and see this and he gives them the inside view everything looked alright on the outside but there were there are serious sins going on this group was was weeping for this God and this group was worshiping the Sun and these people were bound up in sin and what what was told then is that there was to be a mark on those that sigh and cry for the Abominations that are done in the midst thereof and everybody else was going to be slain young and old maids and maids and children and it says begin at My Sanctuary if we don't get rid of these snakes it's very serious it starts here it starts in the house of God that God knows what we're hiding God knows what we're what we're feeding what we're holding on to what we think that we're powerful enough to keep it alive in our lives don't mess with that don't be part in part out We Believe Christ is the Ark in this day that there's another destruction coming and this Ark was covered people talk about Perfect Pitch this Arc had Perfect Pitch it kept everything out kept everything that was supposed to be in in kept everything that was supposed to be out if we'll get into Christ and just stay there that's what we're called to do then these sins they won't be able to get in that if we know the truth the truth will set us free this truth is Jesus yes he's the one he's the rock he's the only one like this verse that I've been just chewing on except we abide in him we can do nothing in in John 13 8 here's a man that has been through a lot with Jesus he's heard all the sermons he's cast out devils he's eaten communion but then he says you'll never wash my feet and I believe Jesus answered him is the same answer that we have today if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me if we won't humble ourselves to the washing of the Water by the word to be clean every wit we have no part with him Jesus can't use a cult that's all tied up but we're to we're to make straight the paths for our feet or to pursue peace and holiness without which no man can see God but see the way this works the great thing about a snake so if you step on the head the rest of it loses its power and that head we're told is unbelief that these all these other things that are in our lives they come from this unbelief these things that come in these Prides these hatreds of our brother These Eyes of lusts that can't cease from adultery these these uh putting on of garments that pertain to a man putting on of makeup The Cutting of the hair these things we still believe those right we still believe that the adorning should be of a a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God is a great price that our women are to be dressed in modest apparel the men are are to stand with backbone and fight for what's right put up with sin we still believe those right we still believe that we can't have the the grace of God the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ with of with respective persons that when somebody comes in and their clothes aren't so good we're supposed to just treat them just as good if it was the king himself sometimes we entertain angels unawares so we've got a lot of different areas that there are snakes in our lives a lot of things a lot of things of the world the music that's got this snake-like power to choke the life out of us the wrong podcast the wrong things that we could watch or read those are still snakes maybe we don't preach about them all the time but those are still snakes and they're still trying to kill you they're still trying to kill me for Luke 10 19 is a promise for us Luke 10 19 says behold I give you power I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and overall the power of the enemy whatever that snake is whatever say well what's your what's your favorite sin what's your favorite snake what's your favorite devil what's the one that's troubling you start with that one because that's the one that's going to cost you say well I'm good on all these I've got 99 of my sheep are great what's the one percent of your life that's gone astray let's go there that's what God cares about not the 99 points in your life that are ducks in a row what's that one sheep in your life that's gone astray Jesus says I give you power over all the power of the enemy whatever it is nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven the wages of sin is still death whatever sin we let in our lives is going to bring death in one form or another but we've got power over it but the way that we've got to do that is by faith in his word you know that there was a lunatic brought to the disciples fell off into the fire in the water and brought this guy to the disciples and they said heal him they couldn't do it and Jesus rebuked them and then this is Matthew 17 19. the disciples came to Jesus apart and said why could we not cast him out and I think that's a good question if there's a snake in our life that's been there for a long time and we're fighting with this thing well what's going on why can't we get rid of this thing what do we have in our life that's the same thing that we've been fighting for days weeks months years God what's going on why aren't we being healed we know that you're the son of righteousness was healing in your wings why am I still Bound by this sin and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed and shall see unto this mountain remove hence Beyond replace it shall remove this is still true this is still for you that will believe that if we'll speak it in faith say devil get out of my life it will remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you I'll be at the sky and goeth not out but by prayer and fasting in John 5 and 5 a certain man was there by the pool of Bethesda which had an infirmity 30 and eight years and Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case a lot of our ailments are not new ailments it's the same old snake think back five years were you fighting with the same thing you're fighting now he says he's saith on him wilt thou be made whole how much do you want it do you really want it here was the testimony that I listened to that was an encouragement to me brother Wayne was over in India and he was preaching and this woman fell down she rose up and I think she fell down and and she was she was demon-possessed it was essentially what it was sticking her tongue out and different things she was really bound up with a snake they prayed for her they went and cast that devil out because this word is still powerful and she fell down that's when she fell down she was she rose up and was acting demonic they prayed for her she fell down and they woke her up and she was in her right mind she was free then they go to a different city they come and there's another demonic Spirit on a woman so both stories have the same start and this thing in a prayer line it's it's kicking and it's fighting it's against them and they they pray for this woman and she passes out too the stories are the same up here but they wake her up and she comes up with the same more of the same these things are real this isn't the boogeyman or spooky scary but there are snakes that we can't see she comes up the same thing and they're they're praying for they're praying trying to intercede for her and eventually the Lord revealed to brother Wayne that she worshiped that thing she didn't really want it to be gone she didn't really want to be free you say how ridiculous here she is and in the presence of the god that made her that's willing to loose her and she would hold on to this nasty devil but don't we do the same sometimes don't we make excuses and say it's not that bad I've got this one under control it before it kills you the wages of sin or death and if you want God to use you let him wash you let him loose you let him heal you say well I really do want to be delivered you know this word tells us how to be healed and if there's something that you've been fighting for a long time have you tried this prescription James 5 16 says confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man of Health much we like to quote that last part say well I'll just effectually pray and be righteous sometimes we need the first part it's been there for a reason too if you're fighting with this thing you can't get loose to it this is a way that you can be healed say brother sister I hate this snake so much that I want to be accountable I want to get this thing out of my life I want you to pray with me I want you to pray for me expose this thing how much do we hate this snake do we just hate it enough to get rid of it if we can get rid of it without looking without being embarrassed without looking like we don't have all our ducks in a row well we uh we only look for that lost sheep if we can do it well while still appearing to have all hundred rounded up or we come to the place or wherever like Samson we say I don't care if it kills me I've got to have Revenge on this my enemy let me die with the Philistines and if we get there if we'll get to the place where we don't care what happens to us but say no these snakes have got to die I'm gonna expose these I'm going to confess my sins I'm not just going to say Lord sorry for my sins what sins are you sorry for are you willing to make them right do you want to be healed when Samson got that way he slew more in his death and all they that were slow that he slew in his life I believe we'll really get to that place we'll say Lord your kingdom come on this Earth as in heaven I believe we'll see prophecy fulfilled I believe we'll see demons craft Sabbath I believe we'll see the sick heals the dead raised spiritually physically whatever it is but Jesus needs a loosed call do you want to be loose I want to I'll tell you I've been confessing things I've been telling my wife look I'm struggling with this I'm struggling with that because I believe that that's how I'm being healed is to say Lord what is it that I'm still fighting with what is it that my unbelief is keeping in my life but now is the day of salvation now is the time Hebrews 3 and 7. wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice is he speaking to you today is there anybody here that yes Lord I hear you have you heard him say that in your life needs to go if you'll hear his voice Harden out your hearts as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me prove me and saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart and have not known my ways they were bound up because they didn't know the truth they didn't really know the person so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest unless I wash you you have no pardon me take heed Brethren watch out lest there being any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God going astray where once you were free do you remember when you were at this altar you were free he broke all the chains you saw Calvary said yes Lord thank you thank you for bruising the head of that serpent don't depart from that don't depart from this living God but exhort one another daily that's what I'm trying to do I'm not trying to be anything or lift myself up but I'm saying brother sister remember when God gave you power over serpents that's for a reason exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any one of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end artists said today if you will hear his voice Harden out your heart says in the provocation for someone they heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt with by Moses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but unto them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief that's the head of the snake right we've been called out where the church that called out been wandering in the wilderness a long time but do you believe that there's an entering in for you do you believe it's not just being called out of denominational systems out of the ideas of man but do you believe that we are more than able to take the land that we can go in we can put our feet on the necks of these Kings have the victory don't Harden your heart don't don't pull away from God don't fall into unbelief say oh God I believe God wash me God loose me I believe that I'm to be free that who the sun sets free is free indeed oh that can be any that could be all of us if we just know him to know him is life is freedom it's for you we're called to walk in these promises of God cast down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and to bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ that's for you every thought to The Obedience of Christ how can we do that by the Holy Ghost by his spirit by surrendering by looking to him the author and the finisher of our faith he is the one that perfects us but he does it by his word and he doesn't bull you into it he says here it is is this what you want or you want something else what is your desire do you want to be made whole we have a promise if we resist the devil he'll he'll flee from us so if he isn't fleeing maybe we don't have the faith to really resist maybe we don't hate the thing enough to really push back you might have to resist every day you might have to push back but this thing shouldn't be growing in your life out of cactus once that I was trying to get rid of and I hacked everything off of it came back up and I hacked everything off of it and it came back up and I hacked everything up eventually it died but if this Cactus is bigger now than it was yesterday a year ago keep hacking keep fighting get to the root of that say Lord where do I not believe your word where is there an unbelief that would cause me to pull back from your presence for his in your presence there is freedom where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and that's our inheritance that we can come boldly into his presence you don't have to wait for Sunday to Sunday to come into His presence but every day go boldly in say Lord you're a man of war and I'm in a battle father put your arm around me father bind up my wounds give me Vision to see what I need to fight today he wants to show you he wants to guide us as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God they are the daughters of God the son has risen to us we can see the son of righteousness are we going to fulfill that the world would see this manifestation that the whole creation's groaning for to see us do the works that Christ did not just the Miracles but to live above sin every promise in the book is mine amen Peter said at Thy word Lord don't make it too complicated there's a there's a pamphlet I was reading and it's talking about you don't need to make it so complicated and say oh well I'm going to go fast for 40 days and I'm gonna do this great thing that thing just take God at his word Just Surrender it to him just say Lord help out my unbelief it's not some great things so far out there it's right Within Reach if you want to reach out and touch it if you want to reach out and claim that if you want to step out in faith and put your foot on that neck that thing that's been bothering you that's for you if the musicians would come let's put up Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 and we'll we'll close with this says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection do you believe that I believe that's for us not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and Faith toward God we keep that Foundation but God's Building a building on top of that Foundation he's building a tabernacle for his holy spirit the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands under the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment for this will we do if God permit but it is impossible for those that were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift or made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they should fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of God afresh put him to an open shame [Music] keep fighting Don't Fall Away don't just say I've been fighting this too long and I've fallen too many times we give up that's when we crucify him afresh that our sins this is a heavy scripture but I believe we gotta keep the whole Council of God in our mind foreign there's going to be a people that they tasted of the Heavenly gifts they were partakers of the Holy Ghost they started well but they were made Shipwrecked because they didn't let the Lord wash them and loose them [Music] so you have a choice today you have a choice every day this is not the one day in your life they have a choice every day you have a choice what are you going to do with the snake scripturally you have power to lose it you have power to bind it you have power to step on its neck to believe God's word or you can keep it hidden let it grow in your life what are you going to do with it God help us God help me I want to be free [Music] I Want To Worship the Lord let's stand together and pray [Music] the Lord spoken to you Harden out your heart [Music] just be led of the spirit he'll show you what you've got to do maybe you've got to confess it maybe you've got to be accountable for it maybe you've got to come to the altar maybe you've got to go talk to somebody and make something right maybe you just have to say Lord I believe he'll show you let's just look to him oh God thank you for Calvary Lord that you took all our sin father on yourself you took the punishment Lord you took the stripes on your back or the thorns on your brow father you purchased salvation Lord you purchased freedom for your children Lord we have such a great inheritance in your spirit Lord there's a Birthright that we've been given Lord we don't want to trade it for a pot of porridge the Lord let us just embrace it let us Stand Fast in the Liberty that you've made us free and not be entangled again with the Yoke of bondage Lord God if there's anybody under the sound of my voice that's bound today I pray God that you would set them free Lord by your spirit by your power let them rise above that thing let them see in faith the work that you have for them Lord the reason that they were born they could rise up and lay hold on on that door [Music] wash his father with your work Deliver us from evil Lord for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen [Music] amen do you love him do you believe him [Music] amen let's sing key of C greater than all my sin there is a remedy for the sensex soul there is a power this is not out of your reach this is right in the promises of God for you oh greater than all sin is the blood that still cleanses he is the grace that still sets me to Praise Him I know the Bloods apart I'm walking into [Music] life I cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the land greater than all my sins but that's still cleanses if you'd like a prayer come on up it sets me free [Music] foreign Paul writes in the scripture he says I Die daily constant battle until we're changed from this Mortal to that immortal but the scripture doesn't say you have to be overcome by it no you overcome it when that man came up challenged brother Branham I believe I was up in Washington it comes all the way and that spirit is cast out and they asked brother Brown why didn't you why didn't you do that and he says no that man worships and we when we give it when we feed it when we get paid heat to it we do we just strengthen it I was playing golf one time and with a just walked on and the guy told me he said it was the first time I played golf in six months and I said why he said because I was standing on the edge and a little rattlesnake bit me in the ankle he said for six months I couldn't do nothing they say the small snakes inject all the Venom the older snakes knows how to play with you they give you a little bit here and they give you a little bit there just to hold you captive they don't inject it all at one time Lord I don't want any of it none of it I wanna if it's if it's something like that I want to step on it and get it over with now
