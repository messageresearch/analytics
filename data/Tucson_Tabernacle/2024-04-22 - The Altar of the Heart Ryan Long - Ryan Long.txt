that you've done and all the elders in the church we have a special blessing today let's all stand this is someone that I have a lot of confidence in brother Ryan long is I've seen in his ministry that when he opens this Bible brother Ryan is not looking at this Bible to prove a point or to further the narrative that maybe he has grown up with or or that a organization would put forward but when brother Ryan opens this Bible I see a gift in him to where he looks at these words and he seeks out the Lord Lord what do you mean when you're saying these things that's brother Ryan I admire him I highly respect him and I look forward to what the Lord's laid on his heart today brothers and sisters let's not take this for granted this brother is a blessing and I look forward to seeing these bless blessings come out upon all of us brother Josiah one more we are standing on Holy Ground and I know that there are angels all around let's praise Let Us Praise Jesus now for we are standing in

to just approach you Lord approach your throne of grace and mercy Lord Lord we're not worthy of your presence that you've bestowed upon us this morning Lord Lord truly from the moment I walked in Lord we could just feel Lord just your holy presence with us this morning Lord Lord a presence that not even angels Lord are clean enough to stand in Lord but you through your grace Lord saw fit to come and be with us this morning Lord Lord to inhabit our praises Lord I just want to tell you thank you for that Lord tell you how grateful I am I'm sure every heart feels the same Lord I'm sure lord it's almost tangible how how real you are in this room this morning Lord we want to just surrender to you this morning Lord I don't know what happened Lord on the way to church or last night or this morning Lord but would you just help us set aside Lord any distraction Lord we have in our minds Lord Lord if our hearts Lord if they be troubled Lord would you just soothe it now Lord would you just bring a peace Lord and a calm to the people's minds their hearts Lord may we receive Lord just directly from your throne this morning Lord Lord I I believe that we've been blessed already Lord more than we could explain Lord more than we could tell you thank you for Lord would you just open up your Bible to us now open up your word Lord amen one word from you Lord would just mean so much to us father we love you and we thank you Lord we just look to you now Lord in Jesus name amen appreciate all the the kind words brother Dan it's um very very mutual feeling I can assure you I just love the people here and Tucson it's good to be with you this morning God bless you thank you to the Musicians brother Josiah the song leading was just uh I'll just tell you a quick testimony I kind of was sitting in the office there I don't know brother Dan if you've ever done this I was just sitting in the office thinking Lord is this the right thing to talk about this morning is it the right thing you put on my heart is it is it my own thoughts is it my own desires that I want to maybe talk about this subject and uh brother Josiah just started singing I believe led by the Holy Spirit the first song just confirmed it to me this morning it was exactly almost word for word what I had written down and then I thought Lord you're just so good and then he's saying the second song and it was just almost word for word what I had written down and so and I I just appreciate the Lord isn't he good brother Dan you didn't even know it you came back and laid hands and prayed with me and the first words out of your mouth were something I had written down so uh it's not I I know you know it's not me and it's not a man and I know it's not you it's not men and women it's a holy God who has decided for some reason to come down and inhabit your heart in my heart this morning and he's decided why I don't know the reason why other than he loves you and he loves me and and and I'm not worthy and you're not worthy am you're not worthy to hear a gospel but he made you worthy amen yes he did he paid a price for you that there just something I I I just I I repeat it a lot but his his own son the life of his own son he deemed you more precious than that life true oh yes amen he took that life and he laid it down for you for me what more can I do this morning except lift my hands brother Isaac and say all is well All Is Well with My Soul this morning let's just read a scripture and I'll have you be seated it's it's overwhelming to be with you this morning and to just receive the kind of greeting that you you never think somebody would say about you brother Dan and I just love and respect you and my I know my family feels the same about the church here my wife she had family in town visiting and she said I'm sorry I got to leave you we're going down to Tucson to be with the people down there and I I I just appreciated that sacrifice this morning let's just turn to a scripture that way you could be seated in Ezekiel I'm just going to trust the Lord that this is uh this is what he wants to speak on this morning Ezekiel 36 I kind of went back and forth the last couple days and weeks on what to talk about and every time I I thought well I i' I'd study on this a little bit maybe a year or two ago and I'll just leave that alone I couldn't get away from it so I'm just going to I'm just going to follow the leading of the Lord this morning Ezekiel 36:25 says then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness could you say all all how much of your filthiness all I don't know if we understand that from all your filthiness that means the deepest and darkest and ugliest part that maybe you don't want anybody to know about guess what he will clean you from even that amen when the Lord says all he means all from all your filthiness and from how much of your idols all of your Idols will I cleanse you and he says and a new heart will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues not because you can do it not because I can do it no he will cause you to walk in statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them amen you may be seated what a scripture this morning this is this is Ezekiel speaking but he's speaking to the people the same as we've had a Prophet come and speak to the people they speak the mind of God to the people when God wants to say something to you he can do it in many different ways amen but one of the ways he uses is a prophet and this prophet in this day is speaking his own words but they're really the words of God and the the words of God that he was speaking where I want to take the heart out of you and I want to put a new heart in you amenallah and I I I think about that statement and why would a god want to do that for me why would he want to do that for me and I'm going to read you just real quick a quote says I I want you to listen for a few M moments before closing I want you to notice one thing and watch closely now a prophet telling us listen closely watch closely watch the order of the scripture I will take away the Stony heart and I will give you a new heart prise the Lord now the heart if you don't get anything else this morning you you just remember this this morning the heart your heart this right here is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit it think about that right here that's correct I I don't care if you're not good enough first thing comes to my mind is well I don't know if I'm good enough for the Holy Spirit to come and dwell here right but this was made it was created by God as the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit the heart is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit and I will give you a new spirit I want you to watch the order now many people get mixed up here they think they got the Holy Ghost but they just get a new spirit watch I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit and then I will put my spirit now the new spirit God had to give you a new spirit but that's just a new spirit God give you so you could get along with the Holy Ghost amen anybody have trouble getting along with the Holy Ghost before God came into your life maybe you have trouble right now getting along with the Holy Ghost guess what God has a formula he says I'm going to take out that thing that doesn't get along with the Holy Ghost and I'm going to give you a new spirit and a new heart and then you have a place in that new heart where God himself the creator of everything that we see can come and live inside that to me is when we talk about the mystery of Christ the message that brother man preach it's it's a 4-Hour three-hour message it boils down to this that God could come and live in the heart of you that's the mystery of Christ revealed right there the whole thing wrapped up in a sentence that the god the almighty God who's holy who who who is so clean sir who he could come down and live inside of the heart of somebody that was born a sinner amen you got to claim that for yourself that is the mystery of God revealed that is something that the devil cannot wrap his mind around he cannot wrap his mind around it you know that throughout the Millennia he has studied that and he cannot figure that out why the Lord why God he knows God is Holy he was cast out from his presence he was not worthy to be in the presence of God he cannot figure out why you could have God living on the inside amen it's because he doesn't have a place for the Holy Spirit to dwell in amen amen that should that should do something to us now maybe what that does to you is it makes you feel even dirtier even more unworthy uhhuh but God has a remedy for that as well God had to give you a new spirit that old Spirit you had you couldn't get along with your neighbor anybody say Amen to that one you couldn't get along with your neighbor we could put in here your spouse your children your father your mother your pastor you couldn't get along he says here you couldn't get along with yourself anybody ever laid down at night and the biggest battle I have is not with people around me it's when I lay down and I get inside this mind that's the battle I have so you know you couldn't get along with God that's what he says so God gave you a new spirit and many times under enthusiasm and if you'll watch the life that it Bears see sometimes we get we get emotionally enthusiastic you know you have a song service like we just had it's to just get wrapped up you know because the presence is real but that presence is there to usher in change see you can bask in that presence every day of your life and be lost am but that presence is there like a current bringing a boat down the river that presence is there to to to bring in change to your life change to your heart you can bask in that presence and walk out those doors and be the same person maybe even be worse so when we feel that presence it's it I I I appreciate the musicians and the song leader because they set that atmosphere for the Lord to come in and do change many times under enthusiasm I hope I'm not hurting he says but I hope I'm uncovering a lot of times you think that you have the Holy Spirit and you say I sung I spoke in tongues and certainly being that close to it you might do all of that but that isn't the holy spirit yet the Holy Spirit Bears record of Jesus Christ that's what the Holy Spirit does I'm going to tell you this I hope this is okay the Holy Spirit doesn't bear record of your church I I believe in church I go to church but it doesn't it doesn't bear record of the doctrine of your local church it doesn't bear record of your thoughts it doesn't bear record of your heart it Bears record of one thing Jesus Christ that's what the Holy Spirit Bears record of and if you have it you'll bear record of the same thing you won't care about what church so and so goes to or you go to or what they believe because that's not what the Holy Spirit Bears record of it Bears record of Jesus Christ in fact if you knew somebody who is believing different than you the spirit of Christ in you would want them to know the truth it would want them to know what's right it wouldn't say oh they're wrong or they don't see what I see no it would want them to know the truth and and Out of Love That Spirit of Christ would say I'm going to bring them the truth in a loving way the way that you were brought the truth and what keeps you I have a question this morning this is a question for myself but I but I think that you could ask yourself the same thing what keeps you from being fully surrendered to God wow what gets in the way of you being used by God the way he wants to use you now I can't answer it for you correct because I don't I don't know your life I don't know your thoughts I don't know your heart that's corre I know that you and I have a Stony heart sometimes now maybe your thought goes brother I had a Stony heart but he took that out but I'm telling you and I'll take you to the scripture your heart can grow Stony amen you could have a soft heart a heart of Flesh God can come in and do something for you and over time and over persecution and over battles and over all these things your heart can become Stony this scripture is not just for when you first heard about the Lord this is a scripture we should be reading and claiming every single day Lord why can't you use me like I want to be used anybody ever asked that Lord why can I have more Works manifesting in my life why can't I seem this is a big one why can't I seem to overcome the enemy now I don't know what the enemy is for you it it it could be it could be cancer it could be addiction it could be bitterness it could be all sorts of things but you have an enemy where's the where's the Zeal that I used to have brother Dan where's that burning desire that I used to have where's the hunger and the thirst for the word of God like I had seems like sometimes the world gets in the way or or I want to say the let's just let's just break it down that's such a a blanket statement you know sometimes we don't listen to the message or or a a person be preached because we're listening to something else that might be music that might be podcast that might be video that might be news nobody say Amen I'm guilty Lord should I put on this tape or should I put on this podcast right where's the hunger and The Thirst that I used to have where I I I used to work and I would had headphones and and I would listen to it 8 10 hours a day solid and now I have 12 hours sitting at a desk and sometimes I don't listen to him where's the hindrance I know this isn't an amen message but that's all right and if you truly feel the same way then you and you know that this question Burns in your heart then I want to tell you there's an answer for it and and I wanna I want to make a case this morning let's let's turn into a scripture would you be okay we're gonna read a little bit it's a little bit of a lengthly scripture but you okay with reading the Bible all right it's in First Kings this is this is a story that I've I just never can get away from this story you excuse me first Kings 18 if you are new if you haven't read the whole Bible this is a great this is a great place to start you know I don't know you never really know who you're preaching to I see the my family here I see the people from Flagstaff brother Kurt brother Isaac my eyesight's bad I know he was here I'm sorry you had to come all the way to Tucson and just to hear me John I'm sorry you thought you were coming here to get a break but you never really know who you're talking to I don't know where you're at in your walk I don't know if you're new I don't know if you're Elder like he was talking about or just off the street but I do know this the Bible is just as good no matter where you're at and the Bible applies no matter where you're at I never want to get to the Place brother Dan where I think I've already accomplished that part of the Bible I never want to get to that place if you get to that place you have missed what the Bible was talking about you read a story in the Bible which is truth to me this isn't just stories and fables this is history to me if you read something in the Bible you think a I think I got that beat I went through that years ago you have missed the lesson of that story you have missed it go back and read it again there's a story here it's a good place to start it's talking about Elijah going up on a mountain and he's challenging 400 Priests of Baal and they say our God is the real God and Elijah says no my God is the real God and I'm sure you know the story if you don't you're going to hear it for the first time and he challenges them he says you I want you to offer a sacrifice to your God I'll offer one to mine and the one that is accepted that God is the true God and the the priests gladly take him up on this so we'll just we'll take off here at verse 22 he says and Elijah said unto the people even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but baal's prophets are 450 450 prophets verses one let them therefore give us two Bullocks and let them choose one Bullock for themselves gives them first choice gives them preference you know you're not worried about you're not worried about it when you have the truth on your side you can give the choice to somebody else when you have the truth on your side you're not worried about it Abraham when presented with a choice with lot he didn't go I think I really want this land when you're LED of the Holy Spirit you don't have to worry about making choices the holy spirit will lead you you can say like Abraham lot I'll give you first choice and lot not being led by the Holy Spirit chose poorly let them choose one Bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood I'm going to read a little bit fast if that's okay just so we're not on this for too long and I will dress the other Bullock and lay it on the wood and put no fire under no fire under this sacrifice and go and call you on the name of your God gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the god that anth by fire let him be God I want to tell you this morning that the god that will answer by fire is God and all the people answered and said it is well spoken the people agreed with this and Elijah said un the prophets of baales choose you one boock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call upon the name of your Gods put no fire under and they did so uh they uh prayed they leaped upon the altar uh verse 27 it came pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a God and neither is talking maybe he's on vacation or maybe he's sleeping and must be woken and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner of knives and lances till the blood gushed out upon them and it came to pass that midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of offering of the evening sacrifice everything in this scripture has a meaning I want you to notice the time of the day and what sacrifice came to be the evening sacrifice which is the time we believe we're living in that there was neither a voice nor any to answer nor the any regarded and Elijah said un all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and I want you to just focus on this last half and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down yeah praise the Lord praise God there was an altar of the Lord you can go back in Kings and you can go back in another in another book um I'll think of it in a moment where that you can see this altar used for God but guess what time had passed battles had passed persecution had to come yes amen and the one a thing that was once the altar of the Lord's had been broken down and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribes of Sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order all these things have meaning if if we had more time we go into these things all these parts of this story have meaning to them the bulock in pieces and laid them on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood do it a second time do it a third time 12 barrels of water everything has a meaning here and the water ran about the Altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near if you could I know you if you're spiritually minded you can just catch where we're at today I want to tell you that this scene is repeating itself as we speak right now we are in the evening time with the Elijah message in front of us and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy word hear me oh Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou Hast turned their heart back again God this whole thing was not to prove who God was it's what it sounds like he says Let The God Who Answers by fire be the true God but if you read to the end of this chapter they take those 450 men and they go slay them they weren't trying to prove to these prophets of Bale who the real God was he was trying to prove to the people that God is capable of turning your heart back to him again this whole thing was not so just so a show could go on that a fire could could fall as it falls in the next verse and consume up the stone and consume the water it wasn't a show it was he says right here that the people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou Hast turned their heart back again and when he says that the next scripture and then the fire of the Lord fell then the fire of the Lord fell thanes and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the God Hallelujah the Lord he is the God Amen and maybe I want to make the case this morning if it if it if it be right that I think a lot of times we're serving God with a broken heart now I don't mean broken heart like Hollywood would describe a broken heart maybe you think broken heart and you think well you think about a a lost love right you think about well I got my heart broken no I'm talking about I'm talking about Christians sincere believing Christians I think sometimes are serving God with a broken heart and maybe maybe know it or maybe don't even know it because the heart is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit yes it is the heart is the alar of the Lord yes it is yes it is see our our heart is not the sacrifice see our heart is not worthy of being the sacrifice because the sacrifice must be innocent and you and I are not innocent you know sometimes we think oh Lord I'm gonna lay myself on the altar no no no you are the altar what is laid upon you was the innocent one and if you read down I we won't read it but if you read in the in the in the Genesis and exodus it talks about the sacrifice and that they would lay the the Lamb on that spotless lamb on those on that altar of stone why didn't they just do it on the ground brother Dan because he said they would cut it and the blood would flow where down onto the altar amen you know sometimes we want I I don't know we think that our sins are covered but in order for your sins to be covered by the blood they have to be underneath the sacrifice a sin that is not placed under the sacrifice is not covered by the blood although the blood has the power to do it yes Jesus Christ has never stopped being Jesus Christ he's never stopped being slain for us he's never stopped being the one who hung on a cross and was resurrected and yet sometimes our sin is not covered because we don't go and place it underneath the sacrifice and by not doing that we actually serve god with a broken heart we serve god with an incomplete Altar and I'll tell you if you serve god with an incomplete altar this right here we were talking about the capacity of this heart you know that he cannot come down and change you how is he supposed to take out a Heart of Stone when all the stones aren't there maybe there's a stone off to the side that one that you don't want to talk about that one that you don't want to think about that one that you don't want associated with you although it's your own thoughts or your own desires it's off in the corner it's off over here and you say Lord I'm going to come to church I'm going to be on time today and that's good there's nothing wrong with that Lord I'm going to praise you I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to sing there's nothing wrong with that I'm going to pray to you I'm going to sit down I'm going to listen to a message I'm going to sit down and read your Bible and that stone sits in the corner and you're serving God maybe I don't know what your situation is but I find a lot of Christians myself included serving God with a broken heart your heart has an ability like nothing other has the ability of you know that you know that angels and animals don't have an ability that you have you have the ability to decide what comes and lives in your heart amen you have the ability you have free will you have the choice to Grant somebody to come and sit on the throne of your heart it says I believe in Revelations it says to him Jesus speaking to him that overcometh glory to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne and then Jesus says even as I had to overcome see he's not going to ask you to do something that he is not doing that's Jesus say look I made a way for you I overcame so that you could see that you could overcome because I dwell in your heart if you let me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down down with my father in his throne there's a scripture in John it says in that day you will know that I am in my father you and in me I in you and you think okay well that's Jesus is talking about to him that overcometh how does that happen the scripture right before that right before this scripture to him that overcometh shows Jesus on the outside of the door saying amen behold I stand at the door and knock what door do you think he's standing at right right there brother behold I stand at the door he doesn't have access unless you give it to him you know he doesn't have access to your altar unless you provide him an altar we we have a scripture right here in the Bible says Elijah before this miracle Could Happen had to go rebuild the altar of the Lord you have a choice to let him in or not you have a choice to now you could let him in I think I think the I think the prophet goes into this he says you could let him in but sometimes keep a room off off limits to him right anybody anybody hear him say that if you don't he says you can let them into your heart like letting somebody into your house oh but you can't open up that closet that's the closet I cram everything into and that door barely shuts and somebody just says one wrong thing to me and that door springs open real fast amen I mean that's that that's sometimes I find that I have that door in my in my house somebody just says the wrong word to you and man that door flies open real quick they get to know the real you yeah my wife's laughing because she's she met she met the real me a couple times I don't I don't mean it that's a joke that's not it there's there's things that we and I don't know why we do this there's things we keep hidden from the Lord and you know he doesn't walk through your heart and see a door and go ah there's probably nothing behind that he knows he knows and you know why because he made you he made that heart and he sees that door and he kind of sees you steer him away from it a little bit and he's like oh okay there's still a little bit more surrendering that this person needs to do to me and here's the thing is that he wants how how much of your filthiness can he cleanse you from all you know he wants to take everything that's in that room out he and he has the ability to take everything in that room out and you'll never see it again amen amen and we know this we know this and yet we keep that door closed and and I'm going to tell you what why I think we do it and that's because I think we're ashamed of it I think we're ashamed of it amen amen when I think about the things that I'm lacking in I'm ashamed of that amen when when I think about my prayer life and how it's not what it should be I'm ashamed of that and that's not something I want to go sometimes and tell everybody that's not something I want to talk about sometimes sometimes that's something I want to keep to myself and say Lord I'm going to work on that Lord I'll get better right anybody ever said that Lord I I'll do better Lord I'll try all we're doing is just keeping that door locked off for him you know that you cannot change amen you know that you can't change amen and I know that I can't change and yet I keep the door locked and why would you not let Jesus into every room in your heart seems like a brother Kurt seems like a real simple thing right would you let him into every heart we would say amen and now it comes time to do it amen and and I don't know I'm not trying to tell you have I'm not somebody that says you have secret sins and you have all these things going I don't know you I don't I know what's going on in your life I just know how the devil works and I know how your heart works because I'm I'm like you my heart works the same way I know that we have things that we are ashamed of most of the time it's things that we cannot control it's things that we do that we don't want to do or things that we want to do but we don't do them amen a lot of times it's I'm just going to say I don't know why but a lot of times that thing that we hold back is forgiveness amen you know may not even be something that you're doing wrong I don't want to tell you you have all these things wrong and secret sins and what are you you know what are you hiding no no sometimes it's just as simple as you cannot let your pride go long enough to forgive somebody and I want to tell you if that's the case you're serving God with a broken heart you are presenting God an altar that's incomplete and expecting a fire to fall and you might feel good because the music was good you might feel good because the preaching was good and then you go out and you say why don't I feel any different two days later three days later where was the victory I had last Sunday where was the victory I had last Wednesday and the answer is simple in order for you to let him in you have to rebuild your heart how do you rebuild your heart to present to God an altar that is complete now that also sounds simple that's not very simple well I actually I want to tell you this it's actually really simple I after I thought about it for like five seconds it's actually really really simple it's just hard to do the simplest things are most likely the hardest things to do now we can complicate them I know I'm not preaching to anybody who's ever been in church for a long time right now we can comp complicate them so that we don't have to make things right we can read and we can cover it up with a quote covered up with a scripture covered up with a good feeling covered up with a good song service and say maybe that thing has gone away until you lay down and you battle the only person that's there yes and you know that it's not gone somebody was saying something the other day up there in flag and say you think you've forgiven somebody man the Lord just just like hit me over the head with a sledg you think you've forgiven somebody and you convince yourself you have until you see them until their name's brought up until somebody else talks about them and then you'll know whether you've forgiven them or not right oh Lord I've I've I I just nothing but fellowship with those people right well why don't you fellowship with them well you know yeah I was busy but I love them I sure love them and and and I I I don't mean to be funny but like really I thought that I've had the love of God and then God put me in a situation where I needed the love of God and then I didn't have it and you know that's that seems cruel no that's that's that's the most merciful and graceful thing that he could do to put you in a situation that exposes whether you have what you say you have or not he'll actually put you in a situation against 450 enemies so you can see if your altar is built up or if it's broken down and it's not to shame you no it's for him to say now look I am the Lord thy God and I want you to know that if you do this I will turn your heart back to me I want to take out the Stony heart from your from you and put in a new heart but I can only do that when you present a Stony heart to me and that's something that we I don't know about you but that's something that we struggle with is presenting to God our ugly Parts amen presenting to God the things that we're ashamed of although he's the one we should be going to with them sometimes it's easier to keep it to ourselves or maybe we'll let it out on somebody else right and the person that we should be I know this is so basic this is not this is not high level but but you should be understanding what I'm saying and I think if you're honest with yourself you have done this at some point maybe you are doing this at some point maybe you're going to it it seems so simple to just present to God oh Lord I'm a sinner that's such I don't want to speak bad about that but that's such a generic statement now I I'm not I'm not against I'm not saying I'm not against saying Lord I'm a sinner it's all through the Bible Paul says chiefest of Sinner Sinners but listen some sometimes you don't want to get specific with the Lord right sometimes we don't it's just easier to say Lord I'm a sinner you know what's wrong and you know what we're doing we're steering them away from the door and saying oh you have full you have full rain of My Heart Lord you have full you you know you know yes he knows but you have to rebuild it amen because he's not going to force his way into your heart I want to tell you that he has the capability maybe of opening that door but he's not going to do it he's not going to open the door that you keep shut you have to open it now when you open it and you tell them what's in there now he has the power now he has the love to say I'm going to cleanse you of all your filthiness all your Idols every thing behind that door I can cleanse you from all I want you to do is open it help us Lord Jesus you know sometimes he's not even outside your heart knocking sometimes he's already inside your heart but he's knocking at that door you keep close to him you know and that that's a trick sometimes because sometimes people think oh I I let the Lord into my heart and I believe you did this message isn't for me because I let him in my heart years ago brother Dan I believe that you did but he's still out a door knocking oh I've walked throughout this I've walked throughout this heart for 10 years but I've never been inside that little room I'm I'm I'm telling you I've SE I've been there I I'm telling you that this is real because it's it's my testimony I have served God most of my life with an incomplete heart raising my hands praising him saying that he's done this and he's genuinely done things for me performed miracles for me and yet I did not open all the doors yes amen and and I know you want to serve him yes I'm not telling you you have bad motive I'm not saying that you do it maliciously I know that you want to be used of God ises any does anybody is anybody not want to be used of God okay that was easier that way that way you don't have to lift your hand if you don't want to everybody wants God right yes amen maybe you think you're not worthy enough maybe you think you're not clean enough but you can never be that way unless those parts get exposed amen what are the stones of your heart and simply they're the things that you are most ashamed of Amen I don't know what that is amen I don't know what you are most ashamed of what you don't want the Lord to know although though he knows and and and you know sometimes I'm just going to say this if if it doesn't apply don't apply it a lot of times it's not even what the Lord thinks sometimes we're worried about what the person next to us thinks you know sometimes the Lord's not even considered sometimes it's what would my church think about me if if if I were to say I struggle with X Y or Z what would the people my church think about me I have been a Christian for a year I've been a Christian for 10 years I've been a Christian for 30 years there nobody would want to hear that I have this problem and so the stone just gets thrown in the corner because I think sometimes we care I don't know do you care a little bit too much about what people think let's just be honest maybe you don't but I care and I got to the thing is we have to stop caring what's more important yes what's more important I want to ask you this morning what's more important that God himself come and live literally literally the life of God come and live in your heart or for somebody not to think bad of you when you put it in perspective it it shouldn't be a decision it shouldn't be a choice but sometimes we're presented with that choice and because of how we are as human beings and we're prideful and we care I I going to tell you to stop caring what somebody else thinks you can't but you got to care about something else more brother Bram says this the thing of it today is we don't try to establish the word of God in people's hearts now now maybe maybe I'll get on uh maybe I'll get on the ministry a little bit maybe I'll get on the churches a little bit we don't try to establish the word of God in people's hearts he says we are trying to establish ourselves you have to see it our way you have to believe it my way you have to believe it I mean even down to you got to believe it this Church's way I know there's other churches but this Church's way right we're trying to establish ourselves in somebody's heart rather than Jesus Christ but guess what the Holy Spirit only Bears record of one thing it doesn't bear record of you or your Doctrine or your church and I'm not speaking against churches now Bears record of Jesus Christ Alone Hallelujah we are trying to establish ourselves churches are trying to establish now if you didn't like when I said it you got to take it over with brother brandom churches are trying to establish the doctrine of a church in a person's heart that's what he says rather than lead them to the truth they'll lead them to our truth and and and I don't mean that even is bad but we we we'll leave it to our truth because we believe we have the truth that it's what happens and I don't think we do it maliciously but we do it we do it and I don't know if you if we can see that even with our family members sometimes that if we try to get them to believe our way and do things our way brother Daniel follow our rule book like we were talking about last night they can't make it to change that's because they haven't made it to the one who can make the change and I know this is so simple it's so basic but but yet this is where I feel like this is where we we struggle I think if you want to see Miracles and you want to see the Lord working in your life you have to take care of this Altar and and and you do you think that God is not capable of it do you think God is not capable of sending a consuming fire he's capable of it he's in it's in the Bible I've seen it happen there was two men there was two men walking to emus they're walking along they they don't have any plans and I'm man appears with them and starts to talk with them and the Bible says they looked at each other and said what didn't in our hearts burn within us as he talked with us and opened to us the scriptures there's literally in the Bible two men walking that a consuming fire is falling on the altar of their heart right there didn't in our hearts burn within us I imagine they maybe had some things that the Lord had to cleanse them from and they and he did it and they didn't even realize he was doing it what did it take it took them talking with the Lord it took them just H it's so simple talking with Jesus we sing a song I must tell Jesus but do we tell him the song says I must tell Jesus all of my troubles or are you too ashamed to them to tell him I'm telling you if you are you're hanging on to it and and whether you agree with me or not you're serving God I don't it doesn't matter how he's manifesting himself you're serving him with a broken heart in Mark there's a story about seed casting it says and I'll just read the one it says these are like those which swn on Stony ground so genuine word of God from a Vindicated Source can come forth and you can hear it amen think about that let's just let's just I don't want to rush past that that is God the godre the same God who who who burnt up this altar speaking words directly to you just just like let that sink in The God Who made the universe who created a drop of dew on a blade of grass to the largest star took the time to speak directly to you and that's all he wants to do is have a conversation with you and then you couldn't you couldn't talk back to him then he sent his son Oh Glory to make a way Hallelujah for you to be able to talk back to him because when he sees you he doesn't see you when he sees the room and he should out of out of justice and righteousness he should destroy you except when you when you give that to him you have now placed yourself under the sacrifice and now he doesn't see you he sees Jesus laying there this is about as basic as Christianity gets but I maybe we just skip past this a little bit or maybe we we we know it but maybe after time the heart grows Stony again it grows hard again it gets callous maybe that's a better word these are like those which swn on Stony ground when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness cuz sounds good right cuz it is good but they have no root in themsel and so endure but for a time now how long is that time it could be tomorrow it it might be this afternoon it might be a year it might be 10 years but eventually it makes itself known for a Time afterwards and when Affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake sake immediately they are offended God is going to put you in a situation for the word's sake that you will be persecuted you will be hated you will suffer so he can see what is inside of you and really so you can see what's inside of you you know sometimes we think we have fellowship with Believers until we need to have fellowship with Believers you know I don't for me I don't know if it's you know sometimes I lack compassion lack empathy the Lord's going to he has and he puts me in situations where that comes out and he says you know what you might be doing this right oh you might go to a message Church oh you might Minister here you might play the this none of that matters none of that matters if you present before him if I present before him an incomplete heart those things don't matter they're good in their place but that is not what he made me for he made me to be the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit I I I just want to maybe in closing God wants to remove all those things from your life how much there's not a single thing you say I know I know what comes up I know what comes up in the mind brother you don't know you don't know the thing that I struggle with and I want to tell you I know it but you know what it doesn't matter if I know it because he knows it and I want to tell you that when he says all he means all and I want to tell you the worst sin you could think of in his eyes is the same as the littlest white lie so sometimes we fool oursel oh well I don't I don't have the problem I don't know if we ever say this maybe I'm just making this up but I don't have the problems of that person maybe I don't have that drug issue maybe I don't have that addiction issue yeah but if if you have the littlest Stone left out of that altar the result is exactly the same and and I think I think it's time we stop presenting god with a beautiful altar amen I I really think that's I think that's what it boils down to I think we need to stop presenting God with what we think a Christian should look like should act like should speak like we need to can I just read you this it's a little bit long but can I read you this it says what what it is this is not my words this William random how is your heart with God tonight that is the question if it's the question then it's the question now Jesus never come for us to build big churches listen here let me tell you something and this is on the side I like how you gave us a little bit on the side Jesus never asked us to ordain or make any church he never left us word for us to build a church he never left word for us to organization a seminary he never left word for a hospital he never left a word for school or education but he did say to the church preach the gospel into all the world and then I will return I appreciated even the youth last night night that they you could say what you want but when was the last time you brought a stranger to church now you you you might may maybe you have that's good but I'm saying when I saw that last night that that to me is the scripture being fulfilled that's somebody who says the commission given go into all the world preach the gospel they're do oh they're 20 years old 18 years old yeah they're doing it right they're doing it you know why because they're not ashamed of what they believe in and I think about I think about when was the last time I went up to a stranger and I said I want you to come to church with me no instead we just go to church it's I hope this doesn't offend but we go to church with the same people we've always gone to church with right because we all think the same we all agree the same we all we all say Amen to the same things but that's not what church is about and that's not what the Life of Christ is about that's not what the Holy Spirit Bears record of what he Bears record of is what he did for you and that's going to get a soul and bring him it's not this building it's not this building it's bringing that heart to a place where they want to rebuild their altar where they want to say Lord you created this heart I I I didn't know that you were my Creator but now I know and I I want to open up every every door to you and I tell you that somebody walking in off the street has an easier time than that than those of us that have been in church most of our life that's the that is the truth I you might not agree with that is the truth somebody coming off the street has a much easier time saying Lord I'm filthy just take me then some of us that that have sat in a Pew a whole life and don't want anybody to know there's still a door we haven't opened up there's still a heart you say Lord I I I've I've so many things have happened in my life and I agree with you but sometimes you're serving God with a broken heart because there's something you're leaving out of your sacrifice and I'm telling you as mighty as God is he won't come down in a consuming fire until that altar is rebuilt because he won't force it upon you nothing against organization church and Hospital they're all right but we put our emphasis on that instead of taking the gospel to the world when 2third of the world tonight has never heard of the Lord Jesus Christ but yet I have the Holy Spirit that Bears record of him where is it bearing record of him oh in the in the in the room where everybody agrees with me that's not what it's for you say well brother I'm not a minister he has made you an able minister of the Gospel it's not behind this little square wooden desk go into all the world in the grocery store go in the gas station when you go on your vacation you can be a record of the Holy Spirit which is Jesus Christ you say how can I do that a consuming fire must come in and take out that Stony heart you're if you're trying to do it you're failing right there the moment you tried to do it you failed already now I'm not saying it doesn't take effort it doesn't take thought about it but when you try to work I don't know when I try to work work it up brother Dan it's it's when it fails miserably how can he come when two-thirds of the world tonight has never heard the Lord Jesus Christ he will come you want do you want him to come that's a that's a legitimate question because maybe maybe you don't want him to come because maybe that door hasn't been opened yet you know a lot of people you don't have to raise your hand but a lot of people actually are afraid of the rapture they're actually afraid of the Lord coming because the house hasn't been cleaned out yet and we know it hasn't been cleaned and we put it off how can he come he'll come when the gospel has been preached not passing tracks they're all right but preach the gospel means demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost to All Nations that I will call as a witness now this is what I tell you I think we need to to stop presenting god with a beautiful altar if you don't do it you could just you don't have to take that part notice Cain back there just as religious as he could be walked up and down and made a beautiful altar offered up his sacrifice knelt down with all of his pomp just like his daddy he wasn't an atheist he wasn't an unbeliever no sir he was a believer oh brother I'm a Believer that's good that's not enough there can't knelt down and worshiped oh brother I worship that's good that doesn't separate you fixed all the big lies I imagine upon his Altar and brought the fruits of the field and laid them there and knelt down and said now Jehovah look how pretty this altar is look at the old common altar that a bunch of holy rollers look how pretty this Christian is now maybe now I I don't think any of us say this in our mind but when we don't include all of the parts that we're ashamed of we're presenting to him what we think he wants to see just looking over there uh at that old common altar that bunch of Holy Rollers has over there look at that old common place they're worshiping in that guy Abel that old stinky lamb hanging up there look here what I've done for you I've built this great church I've put everything down here see what I am I've done something big it'll bring people in that's the works of the devil that's what he says now receive me Jehovah you know I believe in it and God flatly refused him here come little old Abel pulling that Lamb with a spiritual Revelation Oh Glory how did he have a spiritual revelation brother Kurt he had a talk with God I imagine Abel said my heart just burned within me as he opened the scriptures to me as he opened up his word to me he know that it wasn't fruit that brought them out of the Garden of Eden and life don't lay in plants it lays in blood here he come with a little string wrapped around or a great Vine around that little lamb throwed him up here and said this is it Lord and God said that's justification oh and then look his brother was jealous of him that jealous streak never leaves that High Society class I wasn't going to go here but I'm just going to go here I think some sometimes in the message we have high society class in the message we have high society we have Elites in the message we have an attitude sometimes that we are better than someone else who's in the message who believes what we believe because maybe the Lord has done more for us I don't think it's even necessarily bad maybe he's done more for us but as soon soon as we have the attitude I don't know if you you get this as soon as you have the attitude or the thought that you are better than a sinner on the street I'm sorry but you have lost what the Lord did for you you have lost it I'm not saying you're lost I'm not saying you can't get it back but the moment you think that you're better you have lost sight of what he did for you amen and I'm telling you at that moment you are not serving him with a complete heart no sir it's still there it's still there and it won't leave he says when Adam in the Garden of Eden and Eve whose children were cast out I just want to get I I'll I'll close here he says I'll build a beautiful altar I'll put flowers on it I'll put fruits fruits on it I'll make it pretty surely I can appease god with this this and let him know that I'm sincere in my heart he was right as far as the word went God wanted worship he went to worship he made a beautiful place to Worship in fine great Cathedral as they call it today he made it right he built and put an altar in he wasn't an Infidel but able upon the word of God there was no Bible wrote then but God revealed to him that it wasn't fruit that brought us out of the garden of Eden Beauty and things doesn't enchant God it's the sincerity of the Heart by a revelation that Jesus Christ has been presented as the Son of God our personal savior if I just close with this he does not want a beautiful heart he wants your heart exactly the way that it is but he wants all of it there is not a person there is not one single person that has presented themsel to God that he has turned away in the history of humanity when somebody gives their all and surrenders their all to him he has never w one time turn that person away there is a Formula there is a way it has never changed it's it's it's right every time and it's simple we just have to do it let's bow our heads and Lord I just want to ask that you would Lord that you would Lord not just be Lord just in words spoken Lord that you would be in action father Lord that it wouldn't just be a good feeling Lord or a good motivation Lord that Lord we wouldn't just feel Lord the urge to surrender to you Lord and then back away from it and Lord only you know what's in the heart of the individual person Lord what they hold from you what they hold back lord and father I'm sure I'm sure if it's anything like me Lord it's something they wouldn't want anybody need to know Lord including you but Lord would you just gracefully and lovingly Lord take that from them this morning Lord for somebody that I don't know who it's for Lord maybe one person but if there's somebody Lord who has kept something from you Lord by just a simple Lord lifting of the hand Lord where they just tell you this morning Lord I have something I need to talk to you [Music] about Lord I have something I need to make right with you and Lord I know who you are and I know you won't turn that person [Music] away Lord I know that you are a consuming fire lord a holy fire and Lord I know that you're more than able and capable Lord of cleansing me or that person behind a hand this morning Lord I have my eyes closed Lord you know who is hands lifted or not I know that you're capable of cleansing that person from every unrighteousness Lord every filthy thing and I pray Lord you would just let them know that you see them Lord let them know you hear them [Music] and not just a feeling Lord of your presence Lord but Lord maybe watch a life bear out the results Lord maybe where somebody wasn't sweet before lord they're sweet now maybe where somebody wasn't forgiving Lord they forgive now maybe somebody was weak Lord in their Faith Lord they have faith now maybe somebody Lord just had no control over their mind or their or they Lord what they do what they see what they act Lord but they would have you would have a control over that now Lord Lord not trying to work up enthusiasm Lord or emotion Lord It's just simply Lord I want you to have all of me Lord Lord and if there's somebody who agrees Lord if there's somebody who says that same thing Lord would you just see their hand Lord and more importantly Lord would you see the heart behind the hand this morning Lord I believe you're more than able Lord more than able somebody that wants to be used by you lord lord somebody wants that manifestation of you in their life Lord would they just surrender to you this morning Lord [Music] Lord we appreciate you all you do father Lord may we not be afraid Lord to tell you everything Lord may we have a sit down talk with Jesus Lord and tell you all our troubles this morning [Music] Lord maybe somebody's on the edge Lord of edge of tipping Lord but just Lord our pride or our stubbornness or maybe we're just afraid Lord may you just push past that fear this morning Lord Lord You're A Gentle Savior you're a gentle father Lord
