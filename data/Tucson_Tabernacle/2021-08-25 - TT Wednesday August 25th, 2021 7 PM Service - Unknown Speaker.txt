jeremy back there but i'm using a different microphone tonight because last time i spoke there was a thundering sound that came and uh we didn't want that tonight so until we can check that mic so good evening it's wednesday night that means what does wednesday night mean it means we have a wonderful opportunity we're able to gather together knowing many of our brothers and sisters in christ will be here we can worship together sing together pray together uphold one another unite our hearts and our minds set aside our busy lives have an hour or two of solace hear from the lord praise him love him greet one another have a time of fellowship all as we prepare to meet him and be with him forever eternity we're on the threshold of eternity without beginning without end going to a place that he's prepared for us we're not here for entertainment but to draw closer to jesus and as you draw closer to him we'll draw closer to each other and as we draw closer to each other we'll draw closer to him oh because it's wednesday i'll try not to keep you too long brother ed said that there was one dot on the microphone system with the battery he said that's good for uh maybe 60 minutes so um i don't want to test the the length of the battery but but we'll see we'll see so anyway let's pray together before we approach the scripture for this evening lord jesus lord it is such an honor to stand in this place before these people bought by your blood purchased lord that price that you paid as was as was just sung and pilate's judgment hall as those cruel stripes were made but lord you were wounded for my transgressions you were bruised for lyle's iniquities for each one of us lord it's personal lord we pray that you'd be here tonight lord that you would speak lord that that whatever is said lord would would just be coming from you and it would be heard lord as coming from you lord that that you would anoint each ear that hears lord that they would hear what you want them to hear lord help lyle johnson to be just out of the way lord and we commit this evening to you and we thank you for this blessed opportunity in jesus name amen well let's open our bibles to luke chapter 10 starting at the 25th verse and we read behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted jesus saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life and jesus said to the lawyer what's written in the law how how do you read it and the lawyer answering said well thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart remember thy thou in in this kind of english is personal it's not the you plural it's the you singular thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy strength with all thy mind and thy neighbor is thyself and jesus said to the lawyer that's right do this and you'll live and please be seated this event in luke's gospel occurs just as the 72 are returning from having spread the good news some think that this unnamed lawyer might have been one of the 72 we don't know but the answer is telling the pentateuch the five books of moses genesis exodus etc contain the commandments of god the law for the descendants of jacob for israel we're told that there are 613 different commandments to observe yet we just read that jesus indicated there's really only two the others derive or depend on these two and one of those isn't even listed among the ten commandments during his final week of ministry in jerusalem a person variously described the different gospels say he was a scribe or a lawyer he heard jesus debating with the sadducees and informing them of the truth of the resurrection so this fellow then approached jesus we can read it together it's found in mark the 12th chapter starting at verse 28. and one of the scribes came and having heard jesus and the sadducees reasoning together and perceiving that jesus had answered the sadducees well asked jesus which is the first commandment of all and jesus answered the scribe the first of all the commandments is shema israel adonai eloheinu adonai god hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment well this is found in deuteronomy 6 hero israel the lord our god is one lord thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart with all thy soul with all thy might well note the change here in deuteronomy it says with all all thy might the hebrew word it means vehemently holy completely utterly but in the new testament it doesn't say that it says mind and strength it isn't just doing something like a trained animal or a robot it's not simply physical or external but it has to be motivated and come from love from within the heart and within the mind now jesus goes on past the question to the first he's answered the fellows question but he's not going to stop there he states that there's another law another commandment that's that similar of a like comprehensive nature as the first let's read on in mark and the second is like namely this thou shalt love my neighbor as thyself there's no other commandment greater than these well this isn't found in even in the book of deuteronomy it's found in leviticus thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself i am the lord this wasn't written on the tablets of stone that came down from the mountain it's not part of the decalogue it's about attitude it's about love and respect it's about recognition of the body as well as the individuals that comprise it well returning to the temple mark 12 that fateful week the scribe said to jesus well master thou said the truth there is one god and none other but he and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul the the hebrew word there's the the nephesh the nature of being that which has breath and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices i imagine he gestured when he said that they're standing in the temple square the altar where they're doing the sacrifices is right over there this is passover week this is a very important time of sacrifice a very important time of gathering and celebration and he's saying these two things are more important than this thing that we're doing right here at this time what a statement what a place what a context and when jesus saw that the scribe answered discreetly prudently with understanding jesus said to the scribe you're not far from the kingdom of god no man after that dare to ask jesus any question some of you here this evening some of you might be old enough to remember the civil rights movement of 1950s and 60s i remember parts of it quite clearly i remember one of the topics of conversation then could be summarized as you can't legislate love you can tell people they got to get along but you can't make them do it in their heart sorry about that well a few years ago i read a book dealing with persecution of christians in various places including china that china we know is governed by a totalitarian regime they're bent on retaining power they want to dominate at least their part of the world and they broke no dissent one point consistently made is this fellow that wrote the book was interviewing these different people that had been oppressed was that the chinese government didn't care at all what you thought what you believed meant nothing to them they wanted to know and control what you said what you did how you acted they would punish or reward you based on your behavior not on what you thought not on what you believed much like the law handed to moses because you can't legislate love yet the mosaic law demanded that very thing love of god love of your neighbor the history of israel is related to us in the old testament shows us what happens when you try to force internal behavior in this case love by rules obedience to god needs to derive from love of him not fear of reprisal what got me going on this topic was meditating on what our brother evans shared with us last wednesday night i woke up thursday morning with a single word in my mind onus i thought what's that so i looked up found several dictionaries several definitions some of them include a difficult responsibility of necessity a burden or obligation the burden of proof words related to onus are duty obligation responsibility commitment that last one commitment that really jumped out at me i had a friend he passed away about 20 years ago and he and i worked on spacecraft projects together designing satellites and different things and some people would come around and say wow i'd like to be involved in a project like that my friend larry would respond that it takes commitment to get a spacecraft on orbit he illustrated the difference this way he said next time you have a breakfast of bacon and eggs consider this the chicken was involved but the pig was committed onus commitment another thing about the word onus it breaks down to on us the onus is on us i think the message to me was clear the onus commitment responsibility duty obligation burden is on us to love one another and in so doing to draw closer to him to break down the walls that separate us that separate me lyle johnson the walls i erect or that others erected might affect me can mean a burden well that sent me to the oldest writings we have in the new testament the book of galatians we'll read a little bit from chapter six just five verses verses one through five this is where we're told to bear one another's burdens yet we're also told that each must bear his own burden how does that work now as as i read this verses i'm going to inject commentary the commentaries from john wesley the one who recognizes the messenger to the sixth church age philadelphia i'll also read comments that brother branham made about two of these verses he didn't comment on the other three that that i was able to find galatians six beginning at verse one brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault by surprise ignorance or stress of temptation ye which are spiritual who continue to live and walk by the spirit restore such and one by reproof instruction or exhortation everyone who can ought to help herein only in the spirit of meekness this is essential to a spiritual man and in this lies the whole force of the cure considering thyself the plural is beautifully changed into the singular let each take heed to himself lest thou also be tempted temptation easily and swiftly passes from one to another especially if a man endeavors to cure another without preserving his own meekness bear ye one another's burdens sympathize with and assist each other in all your weaknesses grievances trials and so fulfill the law of christ the law of christ an uncommon expression is the law of love this our lord peculiarly recommends this he makes the distinguishing mark of his disciples we'll get back to this law of christ in a few minutes now here's something brother brandon said about verse 2 and in fact he said it in february of 1961 and i believe he was standing right about here when he said these very words he says now put water on this desert and leave it here for several years that cactus would come up with leaves on it be soft that's the way the churches get sometimes when we run without spiritual water we just roll up real tight sticking one another but put water on it it softens out and it's flexible and i think that's what we have churches for is where we can have spiritual water that keeps us sweet and soft so that god can use us and flexible and not sticking one another but just laying softly and sweetly upon the other fellow children each one of us bearing another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ later in 1961 he spoke in early november just after his mother had passed away he said many of you have sent in cards from different places and saying sympathy cards putting some money to help out on the expenses and things never realized that a little gift to someone or a little thing like that would mean so much until it come to me god richly bless you i'm so glad to know that i'm part of the people that has this kind of a spirit i'm so glad to know that i'm your brother and if i had was was eloquent enough or had the speech i'd like to just tell each one of you what i think but i can't do that i don't even know how to express it but i'm saying it this way that that you each one would know what i mean i thank you from the depths of my heart and how the scriptures fulfilled bear you one another's burdens and so fulfilled the law of christ that's from the testimony of a true witness continuing in galatians 2 verse 3 for if a man think himself to be something above his brethren or by any strength of his own when he is nothing he deceives himself he alone will bear their burdens who knows himself to be nothing but let every man prove his own work narrowly examine all he is and all he does and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone he will find in himself matter of rejoicing if his works are right before god and not in another not in glorying over others wesley tells us for every man shall bear his own burden and that day shall give an account of himself to god the link i found to verse 5 where brother branham spoke a little bit regarding this he doesn't actually quote the verse i found it through the through the hub but it reflects the thought i think it's from the greatest battle ever fought he says one time when caesar after a great battle he said i want my most famous warrior to ride by me in this great celebration of triumph over our enemy and every one of the officers trimmed their plumes and polished their armor and their shields and they they marched by whoever so correctly you know as real soldiers is after a while he says a little old fella came by cut he just kind of looked up and started on like that caesar said wait a minute wait a minute you not even dressed like an officer said come here said where'd you get them scars at he said out on the battlefield caesar said climb up here you're the guy i want to set by me why he showed he'd been in battle oh god have mercy on a man that can cut his hand on a sardine can and get a citation i want to be battle-scarred as paul said i bear in my body the marks of jesus christ that's why i want to battle on the field someday when our great chief captain shall come who armored us who gave us the armor of god the holy ghost give us his word to fight with stand out there when our great chief captain comes riding in i want to step up on the chariot and ride home with him don't you and when the battle's over we'll wear the crown oh my oh soldiers of the cross this morning pull that arm of faith out there get a hold of this weapon so the burdens we share are those where we support help encourage one another the onus is on us the burden we bear alone is answering for our personal conduct our thoughts our motives our actions as we heard sunday let's approach that judgment seat while it's sprinkled with the blood of our sacrifice jesus which cleanses us from all sin all unrighteousness and makes that seed of judgment a seed of mercy speaking of sunday what effect did john's experiences on the isle of patmos have on him the visions that when they were recorded for in the book that we call the revelation of jesus christ we heard two sermons about that on sunday and that was just from a fragment of that vision just a portion of chapter four and after experiencing all of this what's the conclusion what did john get from that experience the man who had those visions here's what brother branham said about it from jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he said john after he returned from the isle of patmos out in the aegean sea only thing he could say was little children love one another he found that there was something real and that was the disciple that wanted to call fire down on the city and burn them up because they wouldn't give them nothing to eat but how christ got a hold of them and let them know you don't know what kind of a spirit you have john he said trying to destroy life we come to save life that's what we have to have is love for one another john wanted to call fire down from heaven and destroy a city john the disciple that we associate with love the event referred to as jesus was on the road to jerusalem his final journey on earth ascending to the climax of his mission to redeem us you and me back to the father we read about this in luke chapter 9. starting at verse 51 it came to pass when the time was come that jesus should be received up that's an interesting way to put it he's going to calvary he's going to suffer gethsemane all those things that lay before him but luke tells us it's he's going to the time when he should be received up he's looking beyond the suffering to the victory he steadfastly without wavering jesus set his face to go to jerusalem he knew what weighted him there and sent messengers before his face his disciples right and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for jesus why would he think that the samaritans would receive him samaritans recall the woman at the well the two-day revival in samaria where they constrained him to stay many believed he was the messiah the anointed one perhaps that's the reason that he thought we'll just stop here in scenario they did not receive jesus why because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem remember the samaritans celebrated and worshiped on mount gerizim they did not recognize jerusalem you recall the conversation with a woman at the well they have their own set of priests their own sacrifices their own way of going about all these things yet they claim to embrace the books of moses as the basis of their religion so jesus is determined to go to jerusalem and the samaritans don't recognize that they didn't have dealings with each other the jews and the samaritans weren't buddies when his disciples james and john saw that they didn't receive him they said lord will you that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them just like elijah did oh you want us to do that lord the jewish people and the samaritans there wasn't a lot of love between them but jesus turned and rebuked james and john and said you don't know what kind of spirit you have the son of man does not come to destroy men's lives but to save them jesus and his disciples went to another village well back to the visions on patmos the effect of john on the visions he experienced it wasn't deep mysteries john didn't after that be sending letters and saying oh i've got this revelation of this and i've got this revelation of that it wasn't amazing doctrines it was simply love one another is this the law of christ let's read the opening lines of john's second letter sorry i didn't keep up with that the elder under the elect lady that's the called out the church the bride and her children that includes us whom i love in the truth the truth jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father but by me whom i love and the truth and not i only but also all they that have known the truth for the truth sake for jesus sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us forever that's jesus in the form of the holy spirit i will never leave you nor forsake you he goes on grace be with you but this includes me grace be to you and mercy and peace from god the father from the lord jesus christ the son of the father and truth and love i rejoice greatly when i found of thy children walking in truth as we have received a commandment from the father the commandment from the father what commandment is that and now i beseech thee lady this is a singular i beseech thee lady he's addressing this to the believers the church as a body as one body not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another and breaks it right down to the individual again each member of that body the onus is on us schofield puts a very interesting note here if you have a schofield bible and you read second john it takes all of a half a page so there's a note on the bottom of it where he's talking about the law of christ a summary of it he says the the new law of christ is the divine love as wrought into the renewed heart by the holy spirit and outflowing in the energy of the spirit unforced and spontaneous toward the objects of the divine love it is therefore the law of liberty in contrast with the external law of moses and this is the part that jumped out at me moses law demands love law is love and so takes the place of the external law by fulfilling it it's the law written in the heart under the new covenant i think this is what we mean when we say that christ fulfilled the law the external law is replaced by the internal one the external law had at its heart and foundation the requirement that we love god and love our neighbor didn't tell us how it measured our success and compliance by our external actions just like the example i gave early about the chinese if you break the sabbath we're going to take out and stone you why because you don't love god murder steal sexual sins you aren't loving your neighbor ignore your parents you don't honor them you just aren't showing love now we still look at outward actions now we call them fruits or works but the motive is a response to god's love to us the motive is not fear of a reprisal if we don't we do it because it pleases him right heather my wife dresses as she does because she believes it pleases the lord and heather loves the lord she desires to please him she understands this is one of the things that pleases him so she doesn't now the fact that i'm happy too is important but it's not as important nor should it be how do we have this love this response to god's love by accepting jesus sacrifice yielding our will to his such that he fills us with his spirit to motivate and guide and lead and influence us by being obedient to his word when we fail as we will and continue to do so we seek his mercy and we seek his forgiveness and we extend the same mercy and the same forgiveness to others were to be his little children right trusting but also and very importantly growing he didn't say be and remain as little children paul scolds those who don't grow and always need to repeat kindergarten lessons love one another the onus is on us in his final evening with his disciples jesus hammers his point home again and again john 15 we read starting at verse 9 as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue me ye in my love how if you keep my commandments plural you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy the joy of the lord is our strength that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full okay what are your commandments then lord this is my commandment we've gone from plural to singular this is my commandment that you love one another with what kind of love as i have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends just like the 613 commandments under moses were expressed in two commandments so christ commandments to us under this new covenant are reduced to one which he expounds upon so we can see the degree of the love that he had for us and that he expects us to have you're my friends if you do whatsoever i command you our relationship is not that of a servant but of a friend if we're obedient that's kind of a curious thing in other words both relationships whether you're a servant or a friend they both require obedience but the servant because he must obey the one to whom he owes servitude but the friend because he desires to please his buddy he desires to please his friend you want to obey christ because he's your friend and you want to please him or do you want to obey christ because he's going to smack you if you don't i'm sorry henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what is the lord doeth i have called you friends for all things i have heard of my father i've made known unto you you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he may give it you these things i command you that she love one another love one another i'm going to shift gears here for just a moment well a few minutes and talk about sickness and healing it's intrinsically related to the topic of love and to the onus that's on us regarding it i had nine excerpts i'm not going to read all nine various messages from 56 through 64 where brother banner mentioned the sickest body he knew i'll read just a few of them now he was talking about denominations and creeds and so forth that separated people these days i think it might have a little more impact if when we hear the word denomination we think faction if we hear creeds we think interpretations he says but since you have included me in your rank and this is at the azusa street celebration revival back in 1956 i'm trying my best to stand mutually between the different denominations factions and saying we're brethren i love all the denominations i'm trying to stand in the gap like that and say we're brothers together and i believe that if god will let me to have something to do with uniting the body of christ i think that's the sickest body i know of we have these prayer requests for healing almost every service but the sickest body that i know of is the body of jesus christ the greatest divine healing that needs to be done tonight is the body of christ to be healed into one person that's from the lamb and the dove in 1957 hear ye him now notice just a few minutes i want to say this before i start preaching the greatest need of healing tonight and the sickest body i know of in all the world is the body of jesus christ the church it's horribly sick it's broke up scattered it needs healing may god send the holy spirit in such a power to the whole body of christ will be brought together bond with love and unity until then you'll see things happen you never thought of before jesus will come it'll all be over later in 57 i think too much stress has been put on divine healing i think the sickest body i know of is the body of the lord jesus christ it's needing healing and it takes conventions like this where men have different denominations interpretations set together as brothers that's what does the healing the great ransom church of god should be one heart and one accord god will live in it that's from faith once delivered to the saint i want to give you two more brief excerpts here because he's talking about the bomb that heals the body and all the days of our life 1959 this is a sick world isn't it but you know it's the sickest body on earth i say this with reverence not to be sacrilegious god forgive me if i say wrong the body of jesus christ it needs healing and it can only be healed by brotherly love that's the sickest body i know of all broke to pieces and tore up god i pray for the healing of that body and you're the members of that body so god heal you physically and spiritually make you what you should be brotherly love the onus is on us there's another component to that healing as well this is uh from go wake jesus in 63 i announce i'm going to have a meeting the first thought is divine healing but there's more to the ministry than divine healing the sickest body i know of is the body of jesus christ it needs spiritual healing there's only one bomb i know that will heal and that's the word that's a sick body that we want to stand up in the strength and vitamin power of the gospel and that's why you use much of the time now in trying to strengthen the church by the word brother branham was consistent with this from the 1950s until his passing what about divisions over interpretations doesn't unity mean to be of one mind doesn't that mean like being in lockstep in total agreement amos said can two walk together except they'd be agreed what does this mean what is agreement again i want to read something from taking sides with jesus i'm very grateful that in these days i see it's got little satellites to it brother branham is talking about the church in jeffersonville that there's other sister churches uh brother cruz here his eldersburg group the brother back there just taken brother snelling's place at utica brother ruddle up there brother junior jackson those precious boys who were fine men wonderful men of god they preached this message now they may one might disagree just a little upon something or other he says that's only human amongst a group of ministers yet and if ministers have a little difference that one that won't be a shadow of difference in it maybe one might say i believe that the millennium will come and jesus will be on a white horse others say i believe when he comes he'll come in a white cloud you get those two guys together see what happens right well as long as they believe he's coming that's the main thing see no matter how he's coming just they believe he's coming and making ready for it it's from taking sides with jesus so we need to be able to distinguish between the big picture the the genesis to revelation thread and the small details remember i was going to tell you about an event that occurred when jesus was passing through samaria on his way to jerusalem for the last time how he was rejected in a village and james and john wanted to destroy the town you realize the samaritans did not accept jerusalem as a place of worship nor did they accept the sacrifices made there nor the jewish priesthood yet they claim to follow the law handed down by moses we just read about disagreements over little things i want to read you what happened next in samaria after that event where they were rejected this is found in luke 17 you'll you'll find that the gospels aren't necessarily chronologic so luke 17 11 it came to pass as jesus went to jerusalem it's the same journey he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers they stood afar off as required by the quarantine rules of their day they were at least six feet away and the group of lepers lifted up their voices they weren't whispering said jesus master have mercy on us ten lepers and when jesus saw them he said to the group of lepers go show yourselves to the priests he didn't say you're healed he didn't pray for them he didn't lay hands on them he didn't approach them they stood afar off and the law of moses of leprosy and so forth is when you're cleansed you go to show yourself to the priests or certain sacrifices and so forth jesus just said go show yourself to the priest to the priests there's something very striking going on here it came to pass that as they went as they went they were cleansed whoa what's going on and one of the group of lepers when he saw that he was healed he turned back and with a loud voice glorified god he got a little emotional a great credit where it was due he expressed his thanks remember jesus didn't tell them to show the priests that they were healed he didn't even proclaim their healing he said nothing about it they asked him for mercy and he directed them to the local priests the local priests and the former leper fell down on his face at jesus feet probably grabbing by the ankles giving him thanks the healed man was a samaritan we can probably infer that the other nine were as well we don't know that there's something there related to what we're talking about here jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed where are the other nine they are not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger this non-jew this samaritan this one who doesn't realize that i'm about to be the ultimate sacrifice for his sins at the very place that he scoffs and he rejects jesus said to him arise go thy way thy faith has made thee whole he's a samaritan so what priest is he going to go to a samaritan priest he's not going to go to a jewish priest he's not going to go to the one that sacrifices at the temple he's going to go to the guy that sacrifices on mount gerizim that's what jesus sent him go show yourself to the priests had no dealings with each other the samaritans and the jews what love is this what grace what mercy i'm going to end tonight with another excerpt from one brother random sermons it's a little long but i think we're told in it what we need to do now you who know me realize that i'm not one who often reads a lot of excerpts from brother random's message it's pretty unusual for me but but tonight's unique there'll never be another wednesday august 25 2021. this is the only one they'll ever be so we can do things a little differently approach things a little differently is that okay this is from 1955 and it's a strange title on this message the seal of the antichrist he says pentecostal preachers sometimes and men will go downtown you see them on the streets sometime will just jump into traffic and consider your friends if you see them fixing to get a ticket i don't care who he is put a nickel and don't let them be fine understand what's going on here these are these are people not necessarily part of brother branham's church or any other particular church they're just they're just people that want to be witnesses for jesus christ and so they stand on the street corner and unlike in tucson in 2021 they're not panhandling they're not asking for anything they're giving they're trying to give the gift of life and he says this you recognize this fellow and you recognize oh that's his car over there and it's parked and the parking meter has popped up and says expired he says go put money in the meter don't let the guy get a ticket he's trying to do good help him out he's your brother he may not be a member of your church he may not see things the way you do but he's doing the right thing you do the right thing help him out and not just that he says even in everything and he says what it'll grow on you and then i found this to be a little strange and it really struck me with onus try to be good to one another try if if if when my son was really little and he said daddy i can't pick this up and say try son and he'd try he'd put effort he put focus he put strength that's what he was trying to do he's wanting to do it right he's trying to please me right try to be good to one another try to shake hands and be friendly and nice try to be nice tear down all the walls of partition around you malice and difference ungodliness tear it down keep doing good to one another every time you meet one another make yourself be good to one another and the first thing you know it'll go around you till a bundle of love will wrap you up he says hallelujah that's the marking of god remember this is the seal of the antichrist the mark of the beast he's saying this is the mark of god it's the opposite love one another be kind to one another what did he say to little old david when he was up there she said your soul was wrapped in a bundle of love amen when abigail the great woman that met david said we know your enemies will be flung out like a sling that's right said because you're wrapped in the bundle of the love of god he says he's talking now from corinthians 13 he says brother where there's prophecies it'll cease where there's healings it'll fail where there's all this knowledge of the mysteries and so forth it'll cease but when that which is perfect has come he says the love of god will set us together he says what we need today we talk about pentecostal people knowing more getting farther along than the old-fashioned methodists they'd rise on the scene and make us ashamed of our life you know that's the truth when they'd have revivals from house to house you had it once that's right but you begin to break up set over this way set this way come this way creeds and denominations can i say interpretations and factions put the that put the barriers down broke fellowship within the body says that's all right if you want forty thousand churches as long as you can recognize one another as brothers and love one another if you're different in doctrine little bitty old things about your baptisms and all these little ins and outs forget it be brothers with one another that's right little video things interpretations factions following this preacher that teacher when a revival comes to town brother matthew if you'd come when a revival comes to town with one great united effort everybody go in and help out that's the way then you'll see ministers get together in a fellowship in love with one another and such things that you've never seen before will take place amen oh i love him because i know that's the truth i can say it in the name of the lord it's thus saith the lord that's right that's the truth did you catch that how do you tear down the walls of separation how do you love one another on a practical hands-on get out of the classroom way by sitting back by criticizing no he said make yourself be good to one another every time you meet one another keep doing it and the parking lot grocery store restaurant maybe even a church pretty soon it'll come naturally it'll come from your heart it won't be a great effort it'll be a pleasure and a joy but it takes work it takes effort to get to that place are you willing to put in that effort am i willing to put in that effort to love one another to live the love not just express it in words or claim to have it to have that level of commitment remember the chicken and the pig the onus is on us his brother aaron comes to close the service let's worship and sing i love him let's start at verse 1 gone from my heart the world and all its charms gone from my heart the world and all its charms [Music] now through the blood i'm saved from all along [Music] down at the cross my heart is bending low the precious blood of jesus cleanse [Music] i [Music] love him because he first [Music] and [Music] purchase my [Music] one more time i love him [Music] my salvation he was willing to go to the extreme whatever it took to show that he loved us that he cared if you think back over the last month month and a half it's three sermons now that we've heard addressed to tucson tabernacle to us to love one another to to and sometimes in a family mom and dad and especially if there's five six seven children things happen and i know some families would tell the the children he said if you don't get along i'm going to make you kneel down and wash your siblings feet [Music] and boy they would settle down quick and you know when you think about it but you know what you're doing when you wash one another's feet when jesus said by this shall all men you know you are my disciples you're humbling yourself and saying i love you i'm willing to put myself at a low enough place where i washed the feet of the one that walked amongst the dirt of the earth and all remember brother branham called him the the flunky the little flunky that would wash the feet of those coming in getting low enough to say i love my brother i love my sister and in my heart i had said the lord shared something in my heart and i thought there is a people or today that this word is taking in effect and they're becoming the very expression of the word of god because that's what it is and brother branham the statement that brought that brother branham said you see mary was the word of god being fulfilled that day and we've heard now three times the people becoming the expression and john says that god is love and you know and he was saying the the denominations and and brother i was saying the differences the partitions we've had some ministers meetings and coming up in a few weeks we're going to have another one and the brothers from arizona different churches have come but i've watched too and there are some churches that have not come not been represented and we can let that get to us or we can go and do our part the onus is on us so i appreciate that the lord would remind us again the greatest manifestation of god on earth is god's love in you being given out to everybody else because god is love so beyond the healing beyond the miracles his love reaching somebody's heart and saying because i showed him love through the god that is in me and it affected them to turn towards christ that's what it is so i appreciate that but remember the illness is on us wherever we go and sometimes it gets hard sometimes you get but you know quickly as you can catch your attitude and repent that's why it's as quickly as you can say i'm sorry how quickly that diffuses a just a quick simple i'm i sorry and just a couple of things to bring to your attention here brother matthew watkins called me today and what he said i'll just have you call the other brothers rather than me make four calls his plans are to be here this coming weekend minister both services come and spend the weekend with us as our brother and just just as a as he put it as a visiting minister but with the intention of let's just get to know each other a little bit more for the weekend and the following weekend which we're not sure if it's going to be the following or the third weekend from there because brother ed dougall and brother jordan will still be will be out of town so we may move it out he would come in the morning sunday morning and minister and lay his heart out if he was to become pastor here what his vision would be before the congregation and then the sunday evening service he would open up to questions for the congregation to question him saying what name so it's what he has asked if he could do that and then spend some time for us to pray and seek the lord and what the congregation would make as a decision yes we want him to be our pastor or no so that's what he is asked if he could come and do and express his heart and rather than tell us to tell you let him share what his vision is so this sunday he was coming to minister spend a few days here just he said just stay in that atmosphere and then possibly the next sunday just depending on how we feel brother brother and brother jordan said it would be fine for him to come we didn't have to be here but he kind of felt it would be nice to have everybody here so it may go out one more sunday beyond that but then at that point giving his heart expressing to the congregation where what he would desire how what his vision would be for the church he did not say i'm coming to be the pastor he says i'm going to lay my heart before the people and see how the people feel about that so you'll be praying about it see what what god wants us to do so and then a little update on my daughter sarah she left church on sunday night and took herself over to the hospital the northwest her the head doctor dr fadia who was head of the nephrology there at northwest hospital sort of just go there because the port had either cracked or come apart and was leaking into her system and though you just go and put yourself there i'll get you into the hospital no matter what they think well that weight was about 10 o'clock you guys went somewhere around there 5 30 in the morning before they were able to put her into a bed and then monday afternoon they were able to take the old port out and put the new one in and they had to put on some medication that she had been taking for quite some time so it left her quite feeling quite drowsy sleepy nervous and all so um yesterday morning when she woke up she just was not feeling very good and then they were going to dialyze her once they got everything done i got a chance to get over i had a break between jobs and i went over to the hospital and they were finishing dialysis and she was recovering and she looked at me and she said i'm feeling a whole lot better i'm starting to feel better in fact she says i'm hungry and so the the nurse was doing the dialysis running the machine and the other nurses came in and she got to being a little more herself in fact we were gonna fight over the food and just started playing with her and laughing and so she spent that night and then she had the alice's today and rachel brought her home rachel said she got off the car her color was the same she was the happy sarah she was so she wanted just to appreciate your prayers and thank you and thank the lord for him being mindful of that appreciate that so mama stayed home to be with her tonight and just make sure because some of the effects wear off after a little bit but she was the sarah that that we've gotten to know she'd come into going through a hard time so phil stand with me how many would say lord i want to live that way making no difference no separation because god didn't look and they said now wait a minute leper you're a you're a samaritan i don't deal with samaritans he just said go and i want to have that love that brother branham says that's going to get us to the other side that's what's going to be recognized brother brahm talked about the the cattle when he said it wasn't the brand they were looking at the blood tag and if you've come under that same sacrifice under that same blood tag you're my brother you're my sister i'm your brother also let's pray lord we thank you for your word today and sometimes it's it's just a reminder it's just something to to to make us look at ourselves closely and say what is my motive what am i trying to accomplish why am i acting that way why am i thinking that way what's the motive down in my heart lord let it be always motivated by the love of god that's in our hearts and that's what it would allow him to look at peter even after peter denied him and said i don't know him i cursed at him and he would tell his disciples and tell peter to come also look at a woman that they had caught in the very act of adultery and said woman where are thine accusers that love that would look past all the outside look at past all the differences look at maybe previous history and things and say no i i laid down my life for my friends so lord help us help us i pray lord as we've heard today lord [Music] go with us as we go the rest of this week and may the god of love jesus christ himself rule in our hearts lord we ask it in jesus christ's name amen the song that came to heart my heart was make me more like thee jesus [Music] make me [Music] likely jesus make me more like thee give me a heart that's filled with love and make [Music] i me things make me more likely [Music] jesus make me more likely [Music] give me that's filled with love and make me more likely [Music] now by singing that you just put yourself to be tested because you're asking him make me more like you he says okay let's put you to the test and you're going to see oh i miss it there and then you're going to say no lord make me more like you put me to another test again when you ask him he does that so god bless you as you go [Music] let me walk bless the lord in the way thou has gone leading straight to the land above fill my way every day with love as you go brother mark uh brother peter is going to he'll bring you around and we'll meet there in the back after service okay okay [Music] giving cheer everywhere to the sad and fill my way every day with love fill my way every day with love as i [Music] fill my way every day keep me close to the side of my [Music] [Applause] feel my way [Music] [Applause] [Music] will be [Music] fill my way god bless you tonight fill my way every day with love as i walk with the heavenly down
