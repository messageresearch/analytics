========================================
I can't [singing and music] even walk without you holding [singing] my hand. [music] And the mountains too high and the [music] valleys too high. Oh, down [singing] on my [music] knees. That's where I learn to stand. Cuz Lord, I can't [music] even walk without you holding my hand. [music] And I thought no would surely be me.

It's good to see you in the house of the Lord this evening. Tell you what, if you couldn't tell, I was through the moon this morning after that sermon. I just, it really, really did a lot for me. I don't have any prayer requests, but you have any prayer requests? Um, didn't see any back there. Friends, God is real. He's been answering prayer &gt;&gt; from the very beginning &gt;&gt; and he still answers prayer for healing, for deliverance, for reconciliation. Every need that we have, we can bring before him in the name of the Lord Jesus and he'll answer. Do you have a request on your heart? Is there something before you raise your hand, think about it, is there something that you want that you need that you would like to approach the Lord Jesus on and say, "Lord, here's my request. Here's what I need." You have something? Just raise your hand. Our Father, Lord, we're so grateful that there is an almighty God in heaven. that there is Lord there's just that there's goodness in this world today and all things that are good come from you Lord we are so grateful that we can [music] go before you in prayer Lord there are hands that were lifted and Father we don't just take these things lightly when we raise our hand we're raising our hand to the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, these hands were raised. We pray that Lord, you heard, you saw these requests and that you would grant each one, Lord. And then, Father, we want to just give you a testimony from it. We want to give you honor and praise. Say thank you. Thank you for being God. Thank you for being my savior. Thank you for being my Lord. Here I am in this world and I have a Lord that knows my needs and is willing to answer. Lord, we thank you. I place them into your hands and this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. We have a special blessing tonight. Brother Joel is going to preach for us and he's going to sing us an original song of his. He has in Canada named Blameless. I look forward to hearing Amen. God bless you tonight. This song is an original. It's a song I wrote long, long time ago. And this is my story. And it might be your story, too. It's the story of the protocol. It's called Back Home. I feel so unworthy as I walk along the road. [singing] Oh, and as I raise my head, look into the horizon, I see my father's house. I'm coming back home. [singing] I've been fooled and I went away, but now I'm coming back home. [singing] I'm coming back to stay. I wonder, will you take me back? Even with all I've done, you [music] feel so sad since your son left home. Oh, and every night you pray, hoping [music] he will soon be home. [singing] Oh, and as you're looking through the window, see someone walking by the house [music] looking like your son. Cuz I'm coming back home. [music and singing] I've been fooled and I went away, but now I'm coming back home. And I'm coming back [music] to stay. I wonder would you take me back? Even with all I've done, Lord, I wonder would you take [music] me back? Even with all I've done, my father's running to me. He threw his arms around me. Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no [singing] longer worthy to be called your son, but I'm coming back home. [singing] Whoa. I'm coming back home. I'm coming back to [music and singing] stay. I wonder would you take me back even with all I've done? [singing] Let's have a feast and celebrate.

You brought us back to this sanctuary. And uh I pray that your spirit tonight will move in a mighty way. I have come with great expectation. Expectation to see you move tonight among us. expectation to see you work and heal and deliver and you know mend the hearts and Lord we are needy people but you are a provider and and I pray you take over this meeting tonight and everything that be said or done may be according to your will and to bring you honor and glory. May you be exalted tonight among us. We're here for you and for [snorts] you alone tonight. Take control of this meeting. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're happy to be here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you have come under great expectation. I have. You know, as I Thank you, musicians. as I was up there during the song service and I was looking at the empty chairs, you know, and going back to what we talked about this morning. I believe with all my heart, God is going to fill this church &gt;&gt; to the point where you will not even know where to sit them. &gt;&gt; I expect great things for this church. I see a balcony up there. There will be people in the balcony. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I [snorts] will build my church." &gt;&gt; And I believe this church has got in a state where it's ready to receive the sick and afflicted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh and God will send them. He still calls. He calls. If uh if nobody comes to a church, it's not God's fault. He's still calling. is the church is not ready to receive the people and that's why nobody is coming because God won't send his people to see them die in a church somewhere. He wants to see them in a church where they will get in a personal relationship with him &gt;&gt; where they will cross through that open door. He said I am the door and where they will enter into Christ the promised land. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to keep you up uh too long. Let's just turn to our Bibles tonight. We we'll read a fair share of Numbers 13 as we go back to the story of the children of Israel tonight. And I hope you are blessed this morning if you were here. This morning we talked about Moses journey, his first run, his his first uh his first time leaving Egypt and uh we might have thought of it as an exodus, but it was in fact an exile. He ran to the church in Median. Amen. If you haven't heard it, you should go back and watch it. Now verse 13, starting from verse one. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel." This is very important to remember. Send spies to spy the land that I am giving the children of Israel. There's no maybe here. From each tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, everyone a leader among them. Now, we will skip a few verses because there's the name of all the tribes and the leaders. And we will go to verse 17. Then Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan Canaan and said to them, "Go up this way into the south and go up to the mountains and see what the land is like, whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, few or many, whether the land they dwell in is good or bad, whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds, whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are forests or there are up. Be of good courage and bring home the fruits of the land. Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes. So they went and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehab near the entrance of Hamat. And they went up through the south and came to Ibron, Haiman, Shishi, and Telmi. The descendants of Anak were there. Now Hebron was built seven years before Zan in Egypt. Then they came to the valley of Ishkol where and there cut down a branch with one cluster of grape. They carried it between two of them on a pole. They also brought some of the palm grenade and figs. The place was called the valley of Ishko because the cluster which the men of Israel cut down there. and they returned from spying out the land after 40 days. Now they departed and came back to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the wilderness of Pon at Kadesh and they brought back word to them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land. Amen. You may be seated. Tonight, I hope you can bear with my for English. It's It's even worse when I read because I don't get to choose the words, you know, when I speak, at least I can choose the words I use. So, I thank you for bearing with me and my French accent. May God bless you. Amen. Like I told you this morning, it's a little bit like a two-part series uh a minieries on the children of Israel and their journey. And my title for tonight's sermon is waiting on the Lord for the fulfillment of the promise. Waiting on the Lord for the fulfillment of the promise. And uh we turn our eyes to the children of Israel tonight and and you know they had seen so many miracles up to the passage we've just read where they're now you know they're not at the door just on the shores of the promised land. They've seen God do so many miracles. They've seen the plagues, the the 10 plagues of Egypt, you know, the the the water turned to blood and and the bugs and the frogs and everything. And then they walked out of Egypt and and the the Red Sea was parted and not only did the Red Sea open so they could cross, but it it went back over their enemy to destroy them. And then they ate the mano and they drank the water from the rock and they heard God speaking from the mountain. I mean all these things they had experienced all these miracles and wonders they weren't think God promised them. They had no promise for these things. There was no promise for mana. But mana was working hand inhand with the promise. They had a promise. The promise they had was the children of Israel will dwell in a foreign land for 400 years. But I will bring them out with my mighty hand and I will give them the promised land flowing with milk and honey. That was the promise. But the water and the mana and the parting of the Red Sea, there was no promise talking about these things, but they were steps into the fulfillment of that promise. &gt;&gt; You with me? And after all they experienced, after all of these miracles and wonders, God says, "I give you the land. send one leader from each tribe to inspect the land to see whether there's fruits and whether it's good and and what the inhabitants look like. Go and inspect the land I have given you, the promised land. That's what is asked of them, not to see if they can take the land or not. It's asked of them to see what the land is like. the land I have given you. So these men went on a 40-day expedition. And they came back with proof of the promised land. Throughout all of the children of Israel's journey, they had no proof of the promised land. They had none. But for the first time in their existence, they have something the promise spoke about. When the spies came back from inspecting the prom the the land, they told him and said, "We went to the land where you sent us. It truly flows with milk and honey." This was the promise. They come back from a land with the evidence of the promise. They say it flows with milk and honey. And here are the fruits of the land. For the first time of their journey, they have proof. They have evidence of the promise. They should rejoice. No. Shouldn't they rejoice that they finally near a land where flows milk and honey? They didn't they didn't rejoice. You know why? Because they are human beings. They were they were human beings shaped in iniquity, formed in sin, came to the world telling lies. And that is the one thing we have in common with them. We are humans also. So the story we talk about tonight is a story about us. Like I mentioned this morning, we cannot read our Bible 20,000 ft high and just, you know, see the big uh the big picture of the stories. These types are there so we can identify with them. So we can see the state of our lives. And so when I preach, I always tell the people, you should bring a mirror because it's easy to put it on someone else. Amen for brother so and so or he said this because of that or whatever that might be. But we should have the humility when we come in the house of God. Judgment starts in the house of God. Correction starts in the house of God. We should have the humility to come with a mirror and say, "What about me? &gt;&gt; What about me tonight?" This is how we can grow in our walk with the Lord. And um and so, you know, I'm saying all this because someone is sitting in the room tonight and has seen milk and honey in their life. Someone is sitting in church tonight and has seen the fruit of the promise in their situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But still give a negative report of the situation. &gt;&gt; Your husband begin to change but you still see everything that he does wrong. &gt;&gt; Your kids are getting better and closer to God, but but you only see their problems and their failures and their faults. Your wife is becoming who she should be. But you keep you keep looking at her through the glasses, these old lenses instead of acknowledging that the promise is starting to manifest in her life. &gt;&gt; No matter your situation tonight, you have seen the fruits of the promise. You have seen the milk and honey. &gt;&gt; Then why are you giving a negative report? Amen. &gt;&gt; They had seen, these spies had seen the milk and honey. But look at their report tonight. Look at their report. This is what they had to say. First they say, truly it flows with milk and honey. Then they say, "Nevertheless, the people who dwell in the land are strong and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the descendants of Anch there. The Amalachite dwell in the land of the south and the Hittite and the Jebusite and the Amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the banks of the Jordan. Now a true man of God stops them. Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, "Let's go up at once and take possession for we are well able to to overcome it." There was someone not looking at circumstances but looking at the promise &gt;&gt; but there's nothing he could do about it. You know the spies were too negative and they had a report to give and and they went on and said but the man who had gone up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we. And they gave the children of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, "The land through which we have gone as spies, is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great stature. There we saw the giants. The descendants of Anak came from the giants and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight and so we were in their sight. Now pretty much in the same sentence they give the people evidence of the promise and they say we are not able despite the promise and despite all the miracles and despite the milk and despite the honey the spies couldn't look at the situation with spiritual eyes and see victory because they were anointed with a spirit of unbelief. I want you to keep these words in your head tonight. Anointed with a spirit of unbelief. They looked at the circumstances instead of looking at the promise. Isn't that what they did? Isn't that what we do often times? My sickness is too severe. My problem is too big. My wife is too far off. My husband is too lazy. My children are too rebellious. They rejected God. We listen to the report of the spies. We often listen on the report of the spies in our situation and they couldn't wait on God for the fulfilling of the promise because their circumstances were too overwhelming or too frightening. But most of all, they couldn't wait on God for the fulfilling of the promise because they didn't recognize the nature of God towards them. Despite everything he had done for them, they could not recognize his nature towards them, his love for them. You would think that after all God did for them, they would know they are loved and cared for. But when you choose to look at circumstances after all of what God has done for you, you choose to die in the desert instead of entering the promise. And I will show that by the scriptures tonight. You choose to die in the desert instead of entering the promise or the promised land. Worst when you look at the circumstances and ignore ignore what God is doing, you backslide and you do it fast, very fast. You want to see how fast? Let's read it. Numbers 14. All the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron. And the whole congregation said to them, "If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in the wilderness, why has the Lord brought us to this land to fall by the sword that our wives and children should become victims? Would it not be better for us to return in Egypt?" So they said to one another, "Let us select a leader and return to Egypt." &gt;&gt; Now I want you to get the time period here. There wasn't a sun down and a sun up. This is the same day because we'll see later on tonight what happens the next morning. So the spies come back. They give a bad report. The crowd listens to the report and is ready to to appoint a new leader and go back to Egypt. That is how fast you backslide and you think about your old life when you listen to the report of the spies. It is instant and it is brutal. Now the men of God tried to talk them out of it. You know Moses then speak to the people and he and he goes like this. She says, "If the Lord delights in us, then he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which flows with milk and honey." See how the man of God is is remembering them the promise. We have evidence. It's a land that flows with milk and honey. God will give it to us. Only do not rebel against the Lord, nor fear the people of the land, for they are our bread. Their protection has departed from them and the Lord is with us. Do not fear them. Does that sound clear to you? Not for the children of Israel. No. Because they had already been anointed by that unbelief spirit because they listened to the report of the spies. They already listened to the report of the spy. The people were so backwards. They were so backslid that they wanted to kill him. As he's trying to stop them and to reason with them, what they do is is is this. And all the congregations said to stone them with stones in the same day. Can you realize after the mana, after the water from the rock, after everything they've been through, after the Red Sea, the spies come back with a false report or a bad report. And in the same day, they're ready to kill Moses and Aaron and go back to Egypt. Now, the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of meeting before all the children of Israel. Then the Lord said to Moses, "How long will these people reject me? And how long will they not believe me with all the signs which I have performed amongst them? I will strike them and and disenherit them and I will make you a nation greater and mightier than they. Now notice, God is not mad at the people because they are against Moses, but he's mad at the people because they are against himself himself. And he is ready to start a new race with the people who believe the promise and kill everyone else one more time. This is not the first time. He's just did it with Noah. Everybody that didn't believe was killed and he started a fresh. It's it's not long ago, couple hundred years maybe. And and now here he is again furious at unbelief, ready to kill and build a new race with those who believe. But Moses, a type of Christ, defended the people and reasoned with God. And this blesses me so much. He told God, you know, the Egyptians will say, "You are a God that cannot finish what what you start." When when when the Egyptians learned that everybody died in the desert, he will say, "This God, he's a failure. He cannot even bring his plans to pass. You're supposed to be a God who forgives the iniquities of your people. You said you are slow to anger and rich in mercy. Moses is pleading with God trying to save an unbelieving people. Then the Lord said, "I have pardon according to your word." But truly, as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord. Because all these men who have seen my glory and the signs which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have put me to the test now than these 10 times and have not heeden my voice, they certainly shall not see the land of which I swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who rejected me see it. I told you when you choose to listen to the report of the spies and look at the circumstances instead of keeping your eyes on the promise, you choose to die in the wilderness. Now, the man who Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation complain against him by bringing a bad report of the lamb. Those very men who brought the evil report about the land died by the plague before the Lord. But Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of how do you say that? Jeff, I don't know the the names are different in French, right? Remained alive of the man who went to spy out the land. Now, I want to pause here to say that this story is very much our own. How many times we listen to the spies report, the evil report that is given to us telling us we can't make it, telling us it won't happen. It's physical and it's spiritual spies, both of them. Sometimes, you know, it's through the mouth of someone we love or we know or we respect. Sometimes it's just a devil whispering to our ear. We listen to the spy report. When we listen to the spirit of unbelief whispering in our ear, we listen to this spy report. When we listen to the doctor telling us our cancer is stage 27 or something and and we have only three months to live, we listen each time we take someone else's word instead of God's word of promise. We listen to the report of the spies each time. And each time we listen to these evil reports, the result is fear, anxiety, depression, sometimes even anger because we don't understand. And right away, right away, my friends, we backslide. Right away when we accept the words and the evil reports of the spies, right away something sets inside of us and we start thinking of our old life and how things used to to be before. We start thinking of our Egypt like we talked this morning. Right away we start thinking of our Egypt whatever what it was. And now there is a risk tonight as you listen to this sermon. And now I'm kind of getting to the eye point of tonight's message, which is when you waited for so long, when you were desperate for so long, when when one has a deferred hope, when one has looked to the circumstances for that long and finally wakes up to his own belief, finally wakes up to the fact that he's been looking at circumstances Instead of looking at the promise, when you wake up after you've been waiting for so long, you get a fever. Have you ever heard of a the buck fever? You hunters, the buck fever happens when you've waited so long to see a buck. Then when it finally comes in sight, you can't wait anymore. when you realize you're you're you're getting there, you know, you can't wait anymore for it to position or whatever and you might miss him because you caught a fever. They call it buck fever. You know, in the 80s or the 90s, I'm not sure I was pretty young in them years. There was a space shuttle, Challenger it was called. I'm sure someone has heard of the Challenger space shuttle. It was supposed to launch to space and they put all crew members in the shuttle, you know, and and they closed the door and they were ready for departure, but the weather, the temperatures couldn't allow it. It was windy or something and they couldn't leave launch. So, they had to wait for many days, days, and days for temperature to change so they could launch. So they waited and waited impatient for many days with their eyes set on the circumstances. They looked the temperature. They look at different things and they just wanted, you know, it was a big event. It was a big deal for the country that space shuttle. It was supposed to be on TV, I guess. And everybody was in expectation and waiting. So So when all of a sudden the weather changed and allowed a departure, you know what they did? They rushed it. They skipped all the security stuff and different things and they rushed the departure and and 70 seconds after departure, the space shuttle exploded and everybody died. And this tra tragic event led to the creation of an expression called go fever. Have you ever heard about go fever? Go fever means I'm tired of waiting and I'm rushing to take action and it is very dangerous. In fact, it is more dangerous. It's worse than waiting. It's worse. Now the expression may have been coined in 1990 but the urge to take action has been around for much longer. You know when the children of Israel learned that the spies were dead. Now let's go back to the children of Israel. So here's the chain of event. The spies come back. They give an evil report. The people believe the report. They want to stone Moses and go back to Egypt. The Lord appears and says, "These guys who gave evil reports, these guys will die." And now the spies are dead. Now the children of Israel learn that the spies are dead. And when they learn it, they catch go fever. Now they they completely changed mindset and they rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain. Now that's the next morning. The next morning they raise up early because the spies are dead and so we we must take the land now. They they just flip. They go up to the top of the mountain saying, "Here we are, and we will go up to take the space which the Lord has promised, for we have sinned. Go fever." And Moses said, "Now, why do you transgress the coming of the Lord? For this will not succeed. Do not go up, lest you be defeated by your enemies, for the Lord is not among you. For the Amalachite and the Canaanite are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword, because you have turned away from the Lord. The Lord will not be with you." But they presumed to go to go up to the mountaintop. Nevertheless, neither the ark of the covenant of the Lord nor Moses departed from the camp. Then the Amalachites and the Canaanites who dwelt in that mountain came down and attacked them and drove them back as far as Hora and they killed them. Another version says they killed them as far back as Hora. Now when you read this in context, this event seems to support the spies report. Think of it. Here are the spies. They come back and they say, "We are not able to take the land. Our enemies are too strong." Here are the people of Israel saying, "Let's go. Let's take the land." And there they are killed and defeated. One might say, "The spies were right. Or are they dead?" They were right. We are not able. We've just been defeated. You see, waiting in fear is bad, but going is worse. You might say, "Brother Joel, but what must what must we do?" If we can't wait and and we can't go, what's the point of your sermon? It's really depressing. We must wait upon the Lord &gt;&gt; for the fulfillment of his promise &gt;&gt; because he made a promise and he will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; He's the one who made it and he's the one who will fulfill it. &gt;&gt; He cannot fulfill it if you're in unbelief, but he cannot fulfill it if you're trying to fulfill it yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Counter steer is so bad. What happens with us in in what is the danger preaching this sermon is once I realize I've been looking at circumstances and I've been waiting for so long in fear and listening to the spies report. There's a tendency to counter steer and be like I'm done waiting. I believe on the promise I'mma make it happen. It's bad. &gt;&gt; You cannot fix a mistake with a mistake. Tonight you might be waking up and saying, you know, I'm done looking at circumstances. Amen. You might say, I don't want to be a backslider, brother. Amen. I don't want to be in unbelief. Amen. I'm going to take over the land. Let's have war. Beware, my brother. Be careful. You do have a promise, but you cannot bring the promise to pass yourself. You must wait upon the Lord for the fulfillment of the promise. He made a promise and he will bring it to pass. All he is asking, all he's asking us, all he's asking you is to believe him, not to fall into unbelief, fear, and discouragement. and have the spiritual eyes of faith to see each step of the way towards the fulfilling of the promise. That's what the children of Israel missed there. The reason they they they could accept the report of the spies so easily is because they didn't recount the blessings of God. They didn't have the spiritual eyes of faith to see that. That the mana wasn't promised, but it was a step towards the fulfillment of the promise. That the water from the rock wasn't a promise, but it was a step towards the fulfillment of the promise. Can I share something with you before we close about the spirit of unbelief? You know there is a scripture that puzzled me for years and I mean years and it is the story of Jesus healing the boy with the mute spirit. You know that story. So basically the father brought his boy to Jesus disciple and they couldn't heal him. So so then the father brings his boy to the feet of Jesus. you you have for those of you if someone taking note Mark 9 and ma Matthew chapter 17 um we we will not read it but and now he comes to the feet of Jesus and he asks Jesus if you can do anything please help my boy and Jesus answers and says if you can believe all things are possible to him who believes and and now the account says immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help my unbelief. Now we'll get back to that that statement from the father in a moment. Here's the part that puzzled me. Jesus then proceeds to speak to the demon in the boy. Here here's how it it goes. Jesus after he told the father if you can anything is possible to them that believe. The father says I believe help my unbelief with tears. Then Jesus proceeds to tell the boy or the the demon in the boy rather, I command you to get out of the boy and come back no more. That doesn't sound very complicated, does it? It sound sounds pretty simple. But when his disciples come to him and ask why couldn't we heal him? Then Jesus tells them, "This kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting." You remember the story? &gt;&gt; Now this puzzled me. It bothered me almost for years because here is Jesus not fasting, not even praying. He's just he's just speaking to the demon. and the demon leaves. But right away, he tells his disciple, "This kind only goes out by fasting and praying." And I couldn't reconcile it. It bothered me. And and I ended up making peace with it by saying, "Oh, you know, it's because he's God." Maybe somebody else tonight went through that train of thought, you know, oh, it's because he's God. and and it's different for God than it is for the disciples. But this past summer, I read it maybe 10 times in a row. It came back to mind. I had a a conversation, a fellowship with a fellow pastor and and and we were talking about these things and and casting demons and stuff. And we read it this morning, Mark 16, you know, here are the signs that will follow them that believe. In my name they shall cast out devils. There's no mentioning of fasting or nothing. It says in my name they shall cast out devils. Now, so I opened my Bible and I read it and I said, "Lord, I don't understand." And then I read it again and then I read it again and it made no sense. And I read it again and then I read it again. You know Jesus on earth, he he didn't use any extra privileges. The account says that when he went to Nazareth, he couldn't do many miracles there because of his of their unbelief. You know, he he lived a life so we can model our life after him and be disciples. And and I read it again and and I said, Lord, you said in my name they shall cast out devils. Not not in fasting. They shall cast out devils. I don't get it. And all of a sudden, boom, I got it. Lord shown me something. And it all made sense. And I want to share it with you tonight. And I hope it'll do some something for at least one of you. You see, God had to deal with two different spirit in that story. The mute spirit was the spirit easy to deal with. When God had to deal with the mute spirit, he just spoke to the spirit and said, "Get out of the child." And the spirit left. He cast it out instantly. But here are the disciples after the miracle has just been done. They come to him with pride almost. They don't come to him like the dad saying with teary eyes, you know, God help my unbelief. No. No. They come at they come like spoiled kids. They come asking why can't we do it? Why can't we do it? The kid came to us and we tried and it didn't work like it was a recipe or something. Let's read it. Matthew chapter 17. Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?" And Jesus said to them, "Because of your unbelief. There is the spirit of unbelief whispering the ears of the apostles and anointing them because of your unbelief. For assuredly I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, "Move from here to there," and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you. However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting. the spirit of unbelief. He is not addressing the little boy. Now they ask him a question. Why could we not do it? And he tells them it's because of the spirit of unbelief. This kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting. This was the hard problem of the two because that spirit of unbelief is often accompanied by pride and ego and and unb we we have to become serious about it. We have to be wanting to get rid of the influence of unbelief on our lives. Whatever it takes. We have to come to a point where we say, "I don't want to hear the evil report of the spy anymore. I want to have faith in the promises and faith in my Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to get rid of it." It's because of your unbelief, says Jesus. This kind does not go out easily. You have to become serious about it. You have to be ready to pray and to fast if you need to. It did something to me, something very special. You know, right away I broke down into tears and I realized that, you know, these were the disciples. They were close to Jesus. They had seen all the miracles. They they even thought they could. They tried. You know, when when the boy came, they didn't say, "Oh, we can't go see Jesus." They tried. They were not aware of the spirit of unbelief in their lives. They were not. But they have been made aware when they asked the question. And not only did Jesus tell them what the problem was, but he told them how to get rid of it. And the spirit is telling us tonight how to get rid of it. It doesn't go out easily. But there must be a point in our Christian lives where we are ready to do whatever it takes to be freed from that spirit of unbelief and that spy on our shoulder that keeps whispering evil reports to us and and and binding our faith and and keeping it paralyzed to where we cannot truly believe the promises of God, but we keep giving false or bad reports of our situation and being negative about our situation even though we've seen the fruit of the promise. And we've seen milk and honey because we have I know we have. Everybody in here could say, "Oh, all the things that God has done for me." You have enough evidence of God's love for you. You should be able to hold to the promise and wait on the Lord for the fulfilling of the promise in your life. and not look at the circumstances. Sometimes as I finish I want to read Psalms 37. You know the spies they will use any and all you give them to come and give you evil reports. They will use whatever you give them. And sometimes I think this is what happens. Psalms 37 goes like this. Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him. That is what I've been preaching tonight. But look at the second part. Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way. And I think that sometimes that is what is upsetting. And it's a door that the spy uses to give us a false report, which is look how blessed he is. He's not sick. Why are you sick? He's not. Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way. Look at his business. It's doing so well. Oh, look at this family. They have no issue whatsoever with their kids. But you got all of these problems. Look at your family. It's not like this family. And then you get upset because you look at circumstances, not only yours, but you get into comparison. This is a sickness comparison. It's an evil report from the spies. Oh, or or or you know, look at them. They have no money problem. Money flows for them. Why are you so tight? You've prayed God to answer. Why isn't he answering? These are the report of the spies. And and the Bible is clear. Wait patiently for him. Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way. Don't listen to the report of the spy or you will backslide right away. You will lose even what you already have. You will not only lose the fulfilling of the promise, but you will lose what you already have. The joy you had this morning, you've lost this afternoon. If you listened to the report of the spy musicians could come as I close, I want to read Hebrews chapter 10. For you have need of hindrance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise. Folks, the promise is unconditional even for the children of Israel. You know, God told Moses, "Send the spies to look at the land which I have given you." Not not to look at the land and see if you're able to get the land or see if it's the right land. No, the land that I have given you. But we say the promise is unconditional. But in fact, the kind of is a condition and it's that we believe. That is all of what is required from us to believe the promise to believe the word of the Lord and when we don't believe you know it struck me as I was preparing this sermon to see that because we always we know the story of the children of Israel so so well you know in the 40 years in the desert turning round and should have taken three days and it took for 40 years and we know these things. But for me to really grasp and realize that the sole reason why they had to stay 40 years in the desert and everybody who disbelieved didn't never see the land. The sole reason was disbelief or unbelief. The sole reason up to that point in time there was no plan of them spending 40 years in the desert. But when they disbelieved after all God had done for them, God said, "All of those who have seen what I have done in Egypt and are still disbelieving me will not see the fulfilling of the promise. I have done so much for you. God says tonight. Will you please believe me? Will you please anchor your soul in in my word and in the promises I've given you and wait patiently for me to fulfill the promise in your life? Someone here tonight has been listening to the evil report of the spy for too long. Whether it be health or relationship or family issues or money issues or whatever it might be in your life, you have had enough blessings in your life to know the nature of God towards you. But tonight, you got to wake up and realize I've been listening to that true devil on my shoulder. And I keep giving bad reports of my situation despite all of what the Lord has done for me. And and I believe that this father, the father of this mute boy, he had the right attitude. His confession is amazing to me with the same words in the same sentence. He gets there and he says, "I believe." first words. But then in humility, he says, "If I have some unbelief in here, help my unbelief, Lord." He's not like, "Oh, yes, I believe. I've been believing for 40 years." No, he's humble. He believes, but he realized if there's anything inside of him in of him hindering the fulfilling of the promise, he needs help. And someone tonight, I believe with all my heart, needs help from the Lord, not from me. Someone needs to say, "Father, forgive my unbelief. Help my unbelief. I believe. Let me anchor my soul in your word and in [music] your promises. And let me remind myself every day of my life of your love for me and your divine nature towards me. I want to walk in the promises of God. I don't want to go back to Egypt. I don't want to stone my pastor. I don't want to be negative. I want to be a testimony, a faithful believer. Let us pray. Father, I'm sorry for I have listened to the report of the spies and I have been negative about my situation despite all that you've [music] done for me. But I comely tonight and I ask, Lord, can you help my unbelief? I don't want to listen to the report of the spies anymore. But I want to anchor my soul in your promises. Lord, you've done so many great things for me and I thank you. Help me to be patient, Lord, and to wait on you, not to rush and try to fulfill the promises or make things happen by myself, but to be faithful and believing and ready, but waiting on you because you are the one who made the promises. and I know you are faithful and able to bring him to pass. And I want to thank you in advance. Not only for I want to thank you for what you you've done for me already, but I want to thank you in advance tonight, but for for what you're about to do in my life. And I want to thank you for what you're about to do in the lives of my brothers and sisters as they get rid of this spirit of unbelief or the influence of this spirit over their lives and you choose to anchor their souls upon your word of promise. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. You are so merciful, Father. You don't hold it against us, but you you love us and and you forgive us. And Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Faithfulness walked beside me. Storms make [music] every season from where I stand [music] I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life. All over my life and [music] I see [singing] promises in fulfillment all [music] over my life. all over my life. I meant when I [music] leave. Oh, the fear [singing] may come to fear. &gt;&gt; Fear has to leave tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes. [music] My heart to victory. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, you do. You are my strength and you always [singing and music] will be. And I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life. All over my life. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And I see [singing] promises in fulfillment [music] all over my life. All over my life. [music] See the cross, [singing] the empty grave. The evidence [music] is in this. All my sin [singing] rolled away [music] because of you, oh Jesus. See the cross, the empty grave. The evidence [music and singing] is evidence. All my sin rolled away [singing] because [music] of you, oh Jesus. Oh, &gt;&gt; sing it [music] like you mean it, church. And I see evidence of your goodness all over my life. All over my life. And I see your promises in fulfillment all over my life. All of my life. Once more I see [music] I see [singing] evidence of your goodness all over my life. [music] All over my life. Oh, I see [music] promises fulfillment all around. I am &gt;&gt; church. If you have listened to the report of the spy for your health, for your family, for your finances, whatever it might be, tonight is time to step out in faith. It's time tonight to step out in faith and claim the promise and anchor your soul to the promise. No matter what the circumstances are, just anchor your soul there and wait for the fulfillment [music] and you will see it come to pass and it'll be such a great testimony [music] that'll bring honor and glory to him. I hope I can hear some of those testimonies in the near future. God bless you, church. I love you. [applause] I love you, Lord. For your mercy never fails me. And all [music and singing] my days I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake [singing] up [music] until I lay my head. Oh, [singing] I will sing of the goodness of God. For all my life, you [singing] have been [music] faithful. And all my [music and singing] life you have been so so good. With [music] every [singing] breath that I am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness [music] of God. And I love your voice. Oh, you have led me through the fire in a darkest night. You are [music] close like no other. I've known you as a father. [music and singing] I've known you as my friend. [music] And I have in the goodness of God. Let's all stand. &gt;&gt; For all my life, [music and singing] you have been faithful. And all my [music] life you have been so so good. is every [singing] breath that I make. [music] Oh, I will sing of the goodness. Amen. Amen. Friends, don't believe the lies of the spies. If you want to look over, just get up on the hill and look over. God gave it to us. He said, as our brother said, sent the spies over into land, the spy out to spy out the land that I already gave you. I love that so many people believe those lies. And they are lies. Let's bow our heads. There are so many lies in the world, friends. Lies that people say, that people tell you. And it's so easy to believe a lie. Why is it so hard to believe the truth? Don't believe these lies? Be mature in the gospel. These lies may come. They may come from a friend. They may come from a doctor. They may come from wherever wherever it is. But if it's a negative report that puts fear in your heart, then it is a lie. Father, I'm sorry, Lord. As our brother said, I echo what he said. I'm sorry for believing lies. Lord, you have given us this land. You've given us this church. You've given us life. And Lord, forgive us for believing the spies and what they have said. But Lord, there was a Joshua and a Caleb that went over and spied out that land. and they brought a good report. I want to believe that good report. Father, thank you that there are men in this world [music] that will point to the good things and the promises of God. And as Abraham did, he took those things that were not as though they were. Lord, we thank you now. Father, we reject the lies and we've pressed towards that prize, Father, that you have given us. We thank you. Thank you for our brother Joel, the messages that he brought us today, encouragement. Father, we thank you. Now, Lord, we pray that we would take what you've given us tonight and Lord, let us beware. Help us, Father, when the when the lies come into our ears. Lord, let us remember this sermon tonight and say, "I'm not gonna believe it." God made a promise and I will stand on his promise. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us bring that to our remembrance. Father, when these lies come to us in Jesus name we pray. Amen. All my life you [singing] have been faithful. All my [singing] life you have been so [music] so good. With every breath that I [music and singing] am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Your [music] goodness is running after. It's running after me. Your [music and singing] goodness is running after. It's running after me. With my life [music and singing] laid down, I surrender now. I give you everything. Your goodness is [music] running after is running after me. All my life [music] you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. every [music and singing] breath that I am. [music] Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God.
