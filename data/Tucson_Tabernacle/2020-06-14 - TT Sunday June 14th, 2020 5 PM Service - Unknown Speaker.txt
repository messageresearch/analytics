Yarborough had written in a very requested the name one there was hard to read but I recognize him for the man and it was sister Lucy bail her the ask prayer request for cancer no she was part of the Congregation for some time for the Daniel Ramirez sister and I believe is she back in California with with her family there so remember sister though she and her time today also brother Tony Ramirez called William it had a minor surgery and had got infected and had to go in today to have that taken care of somebody called me this afternoon they had been able to take care of infection and he said that there was more troublesome filling all the paperwork out and everything than it was them taking care of it he was grateful that it didn't get worsen him him an older brother as him his friend and his wife's name is Liz she she has a sister who has a son named Ray and ray son and why for the three of them have COBIT and they found race on about 25 years old unresponsive today and they raced him off to the hospital and he's on a ventilator but hidden up in responding and a couple of days ago her half-sister older sister's son nobody could contact him they went to look for him in his house he found him dead in his house they don't know for sure Fisk of it so my sister-in-law was quite shocked up today and that they would have to go through something like this older brother and his wife so I told him we would bring that to your attention to pray so let's stand him you have a need that's good to see sister Holly here after her request concerning her co-worker and an covet that God keeps his children he said that token would be applied and he would keep us so let's just believe that we asked Lord Jesus you've heard the requests and sometimes we actually know the folks and sometimes are just names but either way you know them Lord you're the author of life you're the giver of life Lord we pray for her for brother Tony for complete complete restoration of his body or from this infection for sister Lucy there with her son in California fighting cancer we think about something that brother Branham who said cancer is not bad if you don't fear take the fear out of our sisters heart right now those around her that might be full of fear and let the peace of God just settle over that Lord and may they trust in you and confide in you Saint no rules with fear Lord but you rule with peace and love Lord my sister-in-law Lord Eze and Fred in the family Lord and one loss already and three in the hospital Lord they're there they're good folks Lord they're friends they're they're a part of our family name they may not believe the same way we believe but your Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so Lord we extend Lord our faith out towards that Lord in every hand that was raised Lord we believe in Lord together and ask it in Jesus Christ's name and can we sing that Lord I believe is a confession Oh Oh [Music] I can testimony to go [Music] at all things are awesome [Music] praise the Lord God bless you amen tonight if you have your Bible let's go straight to Ecclesiastes amen chapter 11 Ecclesiastes chapter 11 amen I appreciate all that music amen and worship and then Ecclesiastes chapter 11 we had a PowerPoint we said if we get it good if not hey don't okay got the thumbs up no worries at all no we were a man asked the thing about technology it's just there to frustrate you appreciate it when it works amen but I sure appreciate the brothers amen working on that so so hard this morning and I trust that something was said this morning that you were encouraged by Amen that you were blessed by so we just have something more we'd like to continue amen tonight and I'm going to title this a little differently than we did this morning I like to speak on in touch with an eternal reality in touch with an eternal reality we're gonna read from Ecclesiastes 11 we also want to turn to Hebrews chapter 11 first we'll catch Ecclesiastes and then we'll have you be seated please he asked these eleven verse 7 truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Sun but if a man live many years and rejoice in them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be many all that cometh is vanity now you remember where we were in chapter 3 this morning and a Solomon after he had gotten everything in life and had prospered and had all of the the you know prosperity he can gain he says after everything no one's going to remember it it's all vanity and he continues this in Chapter 11 further and he says read it again in verse 8 but if a man lived many years and rejoicing them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be many all that cometh is vanity rejoice Oh young man in thy youth I'm young so I'm gonna rejoice and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth now watch right here what he says he says and rejoice in the days of thy let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth and walked in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment now I want you to just to hold there and I'm going to read you from the Tyndale house translation of this just bringing a little bit more modern English into it it doesn't change this the context or the thought at all I'm gonna read the same exact verses it says it's a wonderful thing to be alive if a person lives to be very old let him rejoice in every day of life but let him also remember that eternity is far longer and that everything down here is futile in comparison young man it's wonderful to be young enjoy every minute of it do all you want to take in everything but realize that you must give an account to God for everything you do hebrews chapter 11 does turn there quickly what is read 1 very familiar verse Hebrews 11 and verse 1 Hebrews 11 and verse 1 now faith notice I know you've read this many times I'm showing you you know just reading the Bible but I want to just bring this amen and from just a just to shed some light on this verse here he says now faith is is going to define what faith is faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen read it again now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen let's just bow our heads here just for a moment Lord Jesus or where the Lord God of your presence Lord your concern for us as your children Lord as your family Lord were also very keenly aware Lord of our inability to help ourself Lord Isaiah said it's not even inside of a man to find his own path Lord and your prophet preached a message called the guide Lord and you brought him to such a place to where he just gave up and threw up his hands and Lord and and I never Lord the words that he spoke Lord as he as it begins to testify that moment of anxiety and fear Lord lost out there in the snow and the dark on that mountain Lord but when he grabbed ahold of that line there was such an assurance Lord and were grateful today Lord that we grabbed a hold of that line from Calvary Lord it's an anchor for our soul Lord it's a surety it's a guarantee we have Lord it's a certainty that we possess and in such an uncertain world we pray God that you would come and take these words Lord anoint your words already anointed we believe that but may you anoint us Lord as a speaker Lord I raised my hands with every individual here and ask well God would you come and anoint us to receive Lord as this is a form of worship Lord as we worship you tonight may you just meet it every singing every single need Lord speak to every single heart thus our visitors Lord who are visiting here with us Lord and though lord I pray that her maybe listening by Lord livestream or the phone hookup God may you just be near us all near us Lord one and all we ask have your way we ask above all lord in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated I have a lot just again amen here on my plates I'm just gonna get straight to it and this is subject of faith that has been spoken on many times and when you come to this subject the Bible says that faith is the evidence or the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things not seen I had a conversation with a man much older than myself just a few years ago now maybe two years ago had a very lengthy conversation with him ran into him had known him you know from the days I was maybe 10 or 11 years old and he went to our church for many years and I had ran into him years after he left the church and and had a conversation with that individual and I was just so taken back by some of the things that were said by as I said a person much older than me a man who maybe you would say is in the twilight of his life you know the setting of the Sun older in years much older you know I would be you know double my age and more than double my age and this person just began to tell me as we begin to speak at this restaurant he began to express to me how that he had came to a spot in his life where he had lost all faith and he had lost all of his security it lost all of his surety his stability and and he had left the church left the message and and he was just telling me and he was currently in this state wasn't speaking of it as if he had been restored but he just began telling me how he just it was very confident you know there and I was careful you know to say anything just out of respect for this individual and he just began to tell me how that he had lost all of his faith and that everything in his world had been shaken in his mind of what was real and what what he had always been taught and and and and was basically in a state of questioning everything in his life he was questioning what he believed he actually made a statement to me and he said my spirituality has changed completely and he said I'm still a spiritual person but the way I view everything in the world is different I'm a humanitarian person I'm a globalist I uh II said I believe in the help of humanity but I don't don't necessarily believe that there's a God he begin to go on to tell me that through things in his life he had been begin to question these things and I no doubt he was this person was just expressing his heart and expressing Hallie Phil Hallie Feldon he made a couple of couple statements to me that just began to spawn this line of thinking in my mind that I'm preaching here on tonight and touch with an eternal reality we have that catchphrase today to be in touch you know they use it today to be in touch means to be you're connected that your your your relevant you you have an understanding that you know it's you're grounded that you have a certain reality and they speak you know you just need to be say you need to be in touch with reality but we would like to speak here tonight on being in touch with an eternal reality because it is a reality eternity for the believer is a reality this person begin to speak you know just about how that they had they weren't sure of anything in their life and he morgue I believe no doubt I know it was just a divinely orchestrated moment maybe not for him so much but for myself it was just something the Lord used this to see to look into the eyes as I just stared into his eyes and just begin to try to you know in some ways come with some way of understanding how does a person who had claimed to believe in the Bible had claimed to go to church and be a Christian how do you get from point A to point B how did he arrive at this place in his mind and and and and I begin to ask this even before two weeks before this conversation just in prayer and just in my own self to think it was just riding in my vehicle and just talking to the Lord and the beginning the conversation is pondering a question as I was just beginning to be inspired for a sermon and I and I begin to ask the question you know what is what am i assured of what in my life is sure what can I know with certainty what parts of my life that are connected to me that that those things that have no question that there's a guarantee you know what things do we have in our life things that we whether it's a possession or a moment whether it's a memory here that you have in your possession what things that we possess today are sure that's a very important word what can we know is sure or secure you know we there's a famous song that I love so much called it's a it's an old hymn where your anchor hold and when you look at the lyrics of that song is really the inspiration the song says we have an anchor that is steadfast and Shore and it's and it's anchored behind the veil I'm going to read the lyrics to that song just here in a minute but I begin to ask myself this question what things are of a surety what things do we have that are a guarantee when I say a guarantee I mean it's got to meet the requirement that there is no uncertainty whatsoever about it you I'm sure could list many things here in your own mind tonight you may have a job and it's a good job and you think that job is secure you think it's a really good job but ask yourself just for a moment is that job really secure no matter how many years you've labored or put your heart into I don't care if you're a business owner tonight you think it's so secure I've got revolving contracts and I've got so much of a surety you know maybe you have a government job and and you thought oh it's so secure and I could never lose it well we're lately seeing that there's nothing secure about government even our own entire world economic system is riveting and shaking under the pressure of an economic collapse and you may say well you know a secure job but you know the government could fail tomorrow you could be out of work tomorrow you could have your business today and have an accident at work and get sued by somebody and you're out of business completely and you're out looking for a job owned on the Internet you don't know there when it comes to your career there's nothing sure no matter how much education you've put or how much effort you've put into it we can we can get a false sense of reality of what's really sure and what's securing us in our life many times people are secured by things that they don't even realize are a sense of security to them until they lose it and then suddenly their entire world unravels and comes apart because they realized they were anchored to the wrong thing and I'm just going to go for a moment here on inspiration many people leave the church many things happen and you take people who have so much you know are so anchored to maybe a man maybe a certain individual whether it's a pastor or a father or a loved one or family member and that there's such a anchor there's such a connection there's such a security that they feel but it's amazing when you watch a person if that if that person who they have so much security and happens to fall away or to lose their faith you would think that they would be secured but then they themselves become shaken by it it really calamity and distress sometimes reveal what we're really connected to hello somebody some people are just connected and they literally live off the life of the church the problem is is that's good as long as they like the church and as long as the church is good to them it's always amazing to me as I watch people who serve God for years in a church but watch that church do something very rightfully so wrong to them and they not only leave the church but they leave Christ and it goes to show you that there anchor was never in the word there anchor was in a man you watch people who leave the message and they that you realize that their anchor was on the deity of a man and they think that brother Branham was perfect and he made no mistakes he was a human being he had to make mistakes the only reason I can believe it's because I have a prophet who could be a man who could have mistakes have faults have failures tell a lie yeah I know only that's a hard subject for some people to say amen to but it's right auntie tell a lie tell him I'm not here lie the bill collector called brother Branham stepped out of the room said tell him I'm not even here it goes to pray for a little girl got Holy Spirit convicts him and says go make that right that doesn't shake me that gives me confidence just say that if God could use a man with mistakes if we had a prophet who was perfect in every way boy what chance do we have as believers of that message it's amazing what people are connected to and what their anchor really is established in started the word many times we find it's established in religion tradition how they were raised what Daddy believed what grandpa believed but you watch as some of those things start to get removed from their life and note this was the case of this gentleman I was speaking to and I just seen his faith that became so shipwrecked maybe you have here today you know you you have so much confidence and security and your money and you think it's secured it's in the bank and the bank is secured and they'd say you know FDIC or whatever the acronym is for that that it's insured up to you know so much money and all my money so secure and it's guaranteed it's secured by the government and you can say that it's secured but it's really not secured the dollar can be devalued and lose you lose everything tomorrow the whole economic world as we notice is is crashed and revived and crashed and revived and up and down and in even today you know as we just think about this what our security is in you know maybe you can say well my Security's in my health if there's one thing that is unsure let me say another way if there's one thing that sure is there's nothing sure about your health and you may live in a body without any issues and that's good praise you should thank God for them but even today your body is breaking down every day you live in a cursed earth this earth is cursed it's not redeemed it's gonna be redeemed one day but it's not right now that's why it trips you up and messes you up that's why you get angry you have a temper that's why you still get headaches I'm gonna keep preaching until somebody says hey man your body's not redeemed it's not born again that your soul is translated but this flesh you live in is still cursed and your body's living every single day it's breaking down your body's breaking down you're growing closer and closer as we spoke on this morning to death and so we ask the question today what things for the mat are sure what's guaranteed what things are there that have no uncertainty or job isn't our money isn't our health is it even our loved ones aren't because you could love someone so much today and lose them tomorrow you cherish life but life can slip away as tight as you grasp it as we learn this morning you have no promise James says you make plans for tomorrow tomorrow and going to such and such a city James says you have no promise of tomorrow your life is just a vapor here it's gone just like that life is life really is all about losing this and this this life you know we live in a society and if we're not careful as believers we're not exempt from this but you live in a world that worships life hello let that sink in for a moment you letting that sink in now say man you live in a world that worships life they'll spend all of their fortune trying to prolong their life do whatever they can to try to live and live longer and live healthier lives stronger and we all none of us none of us want to die it's not it's natural inside of you but man has perverted that the desire to live comes from God because one day you are gonna live forever and there won't ever be any death but man has perverted that life and he worships life he worships and does everything he can to keep the wrinkles away to keep the shoulders straight to keep his health up to stay and live long and a long and happy and healthy life but as David said this morning our years are threescore and ten if you know if they if and and it by strength they're ten years longer than that so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom in other words David sands so that I can live those days with wisdom it's all about litt losing I'm just gonna be real with you here tonight life is all about losing it's all about losing you lose strength you lose vitality even your mind as you age begins to slip you begin to forget things even even some of us younger in age begin to forget things and your mind gets cluttered from things and your ever your entire body is breaking down you lose your mind begins to slip you begin to forget things that you could would never have forgotten you lose energy you get fatigued easier you're tired easier you lose loved ones you lose a whole lot in life but I'm so glad for a promise that Jesus says whatever you lose in this life I will restore tenfold in the next life what we realize this is the only things that are sure is the Word of God let me go further the only things that are sure are the promises found in this word the only thing that isn't fading is the eternal things the only thing that's not declining but is increasing is the promises of God and the divine blessings of God and the reality that we possess of another world and the power of that world some of us by the baptism of the Holy Spirit have tasted already in this life of the next life Oh am i preaching to believers today I have tasted of the good things to come I have already tasted of a know another life with no hurt and no harm and no disease and no complex and no stress and no pain and I'm looking for a city whose builder and maker is God I'm looking at I'm living every day of my life to make sure my home is secure on the other side I've tasted of it you realize every time you anointing falls in a church service the under the preaching of the word of God and you feel that stimulation you're tasting of another world you sing songs of Zion and the Holy Spirit falls and you begin to cry and raise your hands what is it it's a taste that's why you love it so much because you were made not for this negative life you were made for a world of a positive life I'm so thankful I can say and that's really what I have today is thankfulness in my heart that I could say thank you God that you chose me to experience an taste of a world that's coming after this world well your anchor hold this is the words to the song well your anchor hold in the storms of life when the clouds unfold their wings of strife when the strong tides lift and the cables strain will your anchor drift or firm remain well your anchor hold and the storms of life but we have an anchor that keeps the soul its steadfast and short I'm thankful for that while the billows roll it's fastened to Iraq let me change that it's fastened to the rock which cannot move it's grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love this man began to speak and I was just listening to him as he began to say that you know we really have no hope and you know he began to talk about that we have no proof of anything you know he was just very cynical very bitter that's that that's that's what I would describe it as is I came away from there as I was talking to a very bitter individual was very bitter of her life is very bitter over disappointments and and he began to speak and say oh we you know we have no proof and he went further and says you know we have no hope while we have this he says all we have is hope we really don't know I'm beginning to think of this word proof that it's such a buzzword today what proof do you have what evidence he said you know we have no proof that when we bury our loved ones that we'll ever even see him again that might be it we don't know no one's ever came back from the grave and told us he said you know and he began to say he said I aces we have no proof you know and in his life he begin to say you know I've questioned it we don't know anything we don't know if there's life after this we don't know if there's anything when we breathe their last breath that was his exact words he said we hope there's a heaven we hope there's another life but I wanted to stop him and say my brother there's there's we have hope there's a heaven and I wanted to say brother I have more than just human hope I have more than just hope job didn't say I hope my Redeemer liveth job said I know my Redeemer liveth and though the skin worms destroy this body what was it there's a revelation a reality that struck job's heart and he said I know my Redeemer liveth and I shall see him oh and joke seen him one day brother Branham says is he knocked on the door paradise job said I know my Redeemer liveth at a revelation of vision brother Brennan said job seen a vision and it wasn't of a say of Jesus of Nazareth it was a ver isn't Savior it was of a risen it was it was exactly what Joe begin to say I see the flowers and they come and then they go and look at the tree it comes up and wither its then it died and it comes back again the leaf leaves and it comes back he says but man what is man he dies he giveth up the ghost it was a complexity something that plagued the of all Schumann's and it plagues the mind of unbelievers today you as a believer are the only one who can face the subject of death with a certainty in your's the Bible says that job said I know my redeemer liveth because job had a reality of another world let me say this to you my brother my sister if you haven't tasted you can taste David said taste and see that the Lord is good you can taste it's not just a human hope you don't just hope that when you bury your loved ones you'll see them someday but you've gotten assurance it's an assurance of faith because the reality of that resurrection has already been made real in my own life thank you Lord that it's been made real in my own life thank you that I could face this subject with out fear can you say man tonight notice what Hebrews chapter 11 says and I want you to turn there just for a moment now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen listen to what he says faith is the substance when he says substance he says that means it's real it has it has tangible it means something you can grab a hold of faith is the substance of my hope let me say it this way faith is not a crutch for proof did you hear me faith is not a crutch for proof well how do you know well I have faith how do you know that there's an that there's an eternity how do you know there's a reality well because I have faith you don't use faith as a crutch for your proof we don't say well you know we don't know if there's a heaven we don't really know if there's eternal light we don't know if Jesus existed we don't know that but we hope and because we have faith therefore we believe that's Baptist theology but let me say to you today faith is not a crutch for proof faith is the proof faith is my proof because I have a revelation in my soul that's my proof and I can say today it's a proof that there's a risen Savior because faith is something you take ahold of it's something you can know that you know that you know brother Branham said it's not a hope so it's a no so my outward body can't see it my ears can't hear it I can't even smell it try to smell I smell a lot of things a lot of foul things in this world but I can't smell it with my ear I can't hear with my ears can't smell it with my nose he said for the matter how real is that proof that you have I can't smell heaven I can't see it with my two eyes you know you said well then I guess it can't be proven because everything by science has to be observable and you got to be able to see it you got to be able to prove it under scientific experiment but by these two eyes by by my mouth I can't speak of it to prove it my ears I can't hear it naturally but my inner man can feel it my inner man can see it my inner man already exists in that reality that's why I serve the Lord Paul said you're seated now together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now you're seated there it's in a different dimension not the one my body lives in not this one hello somebody you say for the mat what does that mean that means that unless you've been translated by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and are sealed already in heavenly places in Christ Jesus then you can never see the kingdom of God isn't that what Jesus said he that is not born of the Spirit of God can never see the kingdom of God that doesn't mean you can't read a Bible come on somebody I know it's Sunday night and y'all are tired but wake up doesn't mean you can't read a Bible everybody can read a Bible that doesn't mean you can't let me go further than that that doesn't even mean that you can't understand some of the doctrines of the Bible you can even have an intellectual understanding of the message but you're still not seeing the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God is only seen by revelation and revelation is faith that's what brother Branham preached faith is the sixth sense glory it's in another dimension and and if you've never experienced that then really truly all you have is human hope a hope but for the believer for the Christian it's not in this dimension that these five senses live in but while my outward man brother Aaron I can't see it it doesn't even fill it all the times in fact most of the time this outdoor man doesn't even feel like coming to church doesn't feel like worshiping the Lord sometimes I'm tired I'm weary don't feel like serving God but while while my outward man can't see it it can't explain it and sometimes the best we're doing even even sometimes when we start talking about Jesus and all he's done first and what he means to us all we can do is have a broken up explanation of our salvation and what it means to be born again and some of us try to explain it to tell tell some money we try to illustrate it with sermons we try to preach it to people we try to explain it we try to use illustrations we use pictures we use tapes we use music what are we trying to do we're trying the inner man is trying to express something to the outward senses that the reality really doesn't exist out here it exists in here and it's the language of the believer and only believers can speak that language that's why you can get around a believer in Africa or in India I've been to China I've got around believers that I couldn't speak that couldn't speak mandrian but yet when we started talking about the word there was an instant connection because we spoke the same language I might not a spoke French I might not have spoke a Norwegian when I went to Norway I couldn't speak their language but when I got around the believer there was a connection there was an affinity there was a unity because our inner man had both while we're both living at the same address in the same Kingdom speaking the same language desiring the same things is the face the language of their redeemed I'm glad I speak that language say for the man you bilingual I am I got a earthly tongue in a heavenly tongue sometimes I spring speaking my heavenly tongue in prayer I'm glad I got it I'm glad I'm one of them you ought to be glad about it tonight I'm one of them oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of those body can't know it can't feel it my inward man knows it's real and he's living right now anchored in that dimension that exists right now oh this is what Hebrews six says here and I think I had it brother Jordan on the PowerPoint you can you can display it if you want it was the it was the the fourth slide he says in Hebrews six verse 18 that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for odd to lie I'm so glad for them we might have a strong consolation I got a consolation here tonight who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us notice this which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil in other words you can't see it with your two eyes it's in another dimension it's an under the veil but it's an anchor it's steadfast its Shore while the rest of the world and your life may be shaken you have one thing you can plant your faith you can bank everything on it it's not gonna fail he's never gonna fail you may fail him I may fail him tomorrow but he'll never fail me the Bible says it's impossible for him to tell a lie and he made a promise I'll have a bride she won't have spot she won't have wrinkle she won't have blemish she'll be perfect in the midst of Lady Asiya and I say tonight amen to the Word of God I believe that in spite of what I can feel or what I can see God can't tell a lie some notice what he says here in Hebrews 6 he says for it's impossible for those who were once enlightened the slide before this and have tasted of the heavenly gift notices as Hebrews 6:4 it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost follow and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come now let's identify this person they have tasted of the heavenly gift they were made partakers didn't say they had the Holy Ghost said they were made partakers of it and have tasted the good word and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance now we know brother and preached eternal security on this but he also preached this this this right here speaking about the man in greens milk when he when he when he miss walk I think it was where he says that the man spoke in tongues the other interpreted mother might have said I was a see said oh oh boy what a gift he came outside if the man had spoken tongues shook his hand he said as soon as my hand did his hand he said I went into a vision and the man he said that man was living with another man's wife my brother branham quotes this Hebrew 6 and say how he's tasted of the good things of God he's tasted of the world of God of the world the power of the world to come he's been made a partaker of the Holy Ghost brother Branham says but if as he as Paul says if they shall fall away to renew them again to repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh to put him to an open shame he say brother Matt what does that mean it means that some have tasted it's a spiritual sense of the powers of the world to come but let me tell you something my brother taste is not enough taste is not enough you may speak in tongues today and fall away tomorrow taste is not enough being a partaker is not enough experiencing the power of God in a church service it's not enough Jesus said you must be born again if taste is not enough and for so many sadly this is all they ever experienced you say how do I taste turn on a tape turn on the tape of Malachi 4 go turn on a tape of the Prophet you're tasting of the good word you could even start to partake of that but there's more my brother you've got to do more than taste you got to do more than taste the angel of the Lord told angel told John in the Book of Revelations go and take the book and eat the book you've got to consume the book it's got to be more than just a taste that you experience you've got to become the word oh and I say tonight and maybe you can agree with me with an amen Lord I don't just want a taste of this word I want to eat the book I wanted to become part of me I wanted to become how I think how'd I live how I act where I go what I do I wanted to become me the real me not this outside me that's full of mistakes and failures but the inner man Paul said the outer man dies daily but the inner man is renewed day by day hallelujah what's Paul saying he's saying that this hope doesn't exist in this body if all your hope is bottled up and your five senses you will end up disappointed and sad and depressed if you try to get your reality of heaven from here you'll end up with doubts and questions and fears but the Bible says there's an anchor that's behind the film's meaning we can't see it with our eyes we can't touch it with our hands but our soul can experience it every single day in fact our soul lives there in that reality to know Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever that he's alive we have an anchor what is it it's a consolation within the veil it's in another dimension it's a hope but it's not a human hope human hope is not steadfast and sure but this kind of Hope is an anchor for the soul same for the mat so unless you've been translated you can't even have this hope not physically not speaking physically here but spiritually and the only way to get that hope is to be translated by the new birth by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by being a go of being born again of a new spirit and if you've never been born again you've never been translated then truly as we said all you can have is human hope I don't want human hope because it's subject to doubt it's subject to questions as we said already we live in a world and a society that worships like we worship living and and and and when we never disconnect for a moment and face that reality but let me say to say this to you my brother my sister if you've been really translated you can face the reality the question of what happens after I breathe my last breath you know what every single person faces that question they just face it differently and you can either face that with fear and doubt and push it out of your mind or you can face it with faith and assurance and reality say brother Matt how do you do that only one reason because Jesus rose like that's the only reason we can face death because he said if I live you shall live also whosoever liveth and believeth in me he shall never die believers brother Brennan said what did he say said believers don't die imagine believers don't die he says death is just as bad as David said although I walk through the shadow with a shadow of the valley of death I will fear no evil thy rod and thy staff they comfort me but the man says what was that in Psalms 27 he says it's because he said I live univ also and I am the resurrection and I am the life and whosoever believeth in me shall never die death to a believer is just a vehicle can you say man it can be painful and people could die a horrible painful way it can be tragically too awful someone can die in horrible ways but once you're free death is just freedom from bondage from a prison oh I hope that I hope you believe that here tonight this life is all about a prison its bars as the song says the hills of home were calling me it says the bars of flesh are gonna burst wide open when the Angels set my spirit free what was it it's another dimension that's why the song says the bars of Clay are going to burst wide open and I'm going to take my flight like a Mighty Eagle oh my brother my sister that's what I thought of my grandfather there in the hospital room on a ventilator maja spittle room but you know they took that ventilator off and as soon as they turned it off his heart just boom I told my wife I said he didn't waste one minute he didn't waste one moment he took his flight like a mighty Eagle he bursts out of all of that pain and all of that sorrow you might have lost somebody in this life they wouldn't come back to this world for one minute they've already experienced the body without pain and without suffering they're in touch with an eternal reality that's where the random gives the story about that fish he said could you imagine ever being a fish and he said you know there in that life could you come from this intelligent life as a human and go live as a fish he said just in the water and he says you know they're all he knows is the environment he says but in that little fish that's his entire world it's everything he thinks it is what life is as far as he knows that's it this is life this is everything brother Branham says but if you ever take that fish and he said you could ever bring him up to this and you bring him to a higher form of life he could never go back to being a fish again he said because once he's experienced this life it's a higher form of life he would never go back prophet of God said him once you've ever tasted of that heavenly life and that heavenly gift how could you ever go back to this world of pain and sorrow truly what Paul speaks up here and let me see what I had after that brother Jordan yeah you can just you can mute that here just for a moment what you realize is that the body the mortal body is merely a shell there's mortal body as merely just a shell it's all it is it's a housing probably of God call to the vehicle it's like a nut shell and inside of it is the real life and the life is not in the shell life is not in the shell the life is what's inside of the shell the shell is not for keeping you don't keep the shell you dispose of the shell are you with me life and that's what a mortal body is it's just a shell and life is not in the shell and the shell is not for keeping it's a temporary dwelling place it's a temporal where it's a temporary home and what brother Eddie preaches the future home of the Briley bride and the heavenly bridegroom and he says what is it he says that's why the body says win this if this Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting a body not made with hands what is this life this body is all a pest house it's just a pest house of trouble it's breaking down it's dying it's disease that gets hurt it gets shake its weak it gets weary it's just a shell that's all it is let me say this it's a cheap shell compared to the shell in heaven it's made in China but I've got a body that never breaks down no broken parts no defects all no defects in that other life I hope you're rejoicing in that here tonight and a believers been endowed with eternal life but the random said it's a gene seed it says he caught it Zoe so what does Zoe mean it means the Zoe the real true life of God he says that's worth it that's the real you brother Branham says I'm not I realized one day I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham that's not who I really am that was my life here on earth this isn't the real you the real you is the inside you it's the inner man that's the real you this you does this me causes me trouble the real enemy brother man says you look in the mirror since I realized my real enemy is Bill Brandon tell what I said there were enemies william branham he says i looked in the mirror says you look in the mirror says that's your enemy your brother's not your enemy that's your enemy go look in the mirror he says that's your real enemy he says this isn't the real this isn't the real me but there's a Zowie there's a gene seed of God prophets that was planted before the foundation of the world and he says you he says Jesus came straight from thoughts straight to existence he bypassed his theophany he says behold but you said what did you do you came into this world to be tested to be tried to be took for your character to be molded and he says in one day you go back to that life that real you that real existence of who you really were before there was ever a you on earth that's why brother madam said God says to Joe where were you Joe when the morning stars shouted for glory he says one that when I laid the foundations remenham says what was he trying to get job to understand this life that you call life is not really life there was another life it's another life you're going to job all of this is just a negative of a positive that makes me happy and if I'm the only one happy tonight I'm okay with that that makes me happy that makes me shout that makes me rejoice to know this isn't the real me cuz I'm not happy with this guy selling roses at family at lunch today I said you know people believe we're in the Millennium you know my dad always says boy if this is the millennium I want my money back if this is it this life this trouble this this pain this world no no but there's a life coming and with inside of that jeans seat of God oh it's within us it's an ever growing ever expanding process of development your entire Christian life you say you're saved but let me just say it this way I'm being saved Baptist have coined up the old theological terms are you saved well no not really I mean yeah I'm born again by the spirit but I ain't saved yet but I'm gonna be saved one day when I can look back at the world that's burning it on fire and I could say goodbye world that's when I can say I'm saved brother Adam says that's when they he says a real believer he says they'll get on the other heels of glory nice a safe I'm safe at last safe at last it's an eventual it's an ever-growing what is serving the Lord brother Matt it's an ever expanding process of that gene seed so a seed of God coming to maturity are you perfect yeah are you perfected yet no I'm not he's still working on me and then I'm still a project he's still busy working on me all I gotta say is Lord don't give up on me I'm gonna get there someday Lord I'm gonna keep pushing I'm gonna keep pressing I'm gonna keep trying don't give up on me Jesus one day I'm gonna burst wide open one day this inner man is gonna take over this outer man and Paul says the corruptible will put on incorruption this mortal shall put on in mortality it'll be a new life it'll be a new Kratz why the Bible says Jesus was the beginning of the new creation he was a whole new human he was a whole new life the resurrected Savior what was he he was the beginning of a new creation it's a maturing the Prophet says in every believer has that see gene of God that Zoe see gene of life it's planet is a little seed and you water that seed and you put that seed in the right light you put it in the sunlight of God's Word brother man and said you put it in the right atmosphere and it'll grow it's like the seeds they found in the tombs of and in Egypt and they pulled out from the graves little seeds that had been bottled up and just a little a little vessel found seeds thousands of years old took those same seeds out of the coffin out of out of the tombs of the mummies planted it in the ground got the sunlight got that got the the water guess what those seeds came to life why it's a law of life the seed is good but you've got to get the seed in the right atmosphere you got to get it under the right anointing you want to be born again you got to come in the right atmosphere you got to get into the Third's you've got to get in the spirit brother Branham says you got to get in the spirit to receive the Holy Spirit you've got to get in the spirit first can you say amen to the word tonight it's got to grow the seed needs to mature and all the while that seed is maturing day by day Paul said the the outer man is Dinah says but the inner man is renewed day by day by day by day by day you're feeding on the Word of God you're in your prayer closet you're communing with the Lord you're fighting battles you're in you're in a trial one brother said you're either in a trial you're coming out of a trial or you're about to go into another trial one play one way or the other you're in it you're going through a trial it's all about character it's all about molding it's all the while it's in this decay corrupt shell while it's in this flesh full of mistakes full of bad habits full of prone to subject to weakness the sickness to disease full of questions full of fears and all the while it's taking place not what you see on the outside it's what's happening in the inside outside the bodies dad died Paul said but the inner man's being renewed day by day a day he's becoming more alive more vibrant more strong he's not declining he's ascending he's in the process of maturity you're laying in the presence of the Sun you're ripening in the presence of the Sun ever developing ever expanding eventually you say for them at what happens eventually like a little chicken it eventually pecks its way at that outer shell and one day the big pops through and then it rips the shell and one day that inner man burst Oh Paul said oh and death shall be swallowed up in victory what is death this is death right here in one day one day this death is going to be swallowed up in life in everlasting life oh he's in the process of maturing ever expanding until that inner man breaks through the shell of this out of man and then the real you will be exposed Paul said oh I don't know what we shall be but we shall be like him in his very image not there now but that's okay because this is just a shell this is just an outer tabernacle a vehicle a body oh and the life that Zooey life of God pressurizes it puts pressure on that shell the outer shell oh and and then what happens those artificial bounds are broken oh and the soul is freed from the prison you know I always heard it said this body all it's just a pest how so I was wondering what that meant as a little boy what is it pest house what does that mean means you got a house with a bunch of pests inside of it it's a pest house always heard that expression you know I realized that more and more every day how true that is that this body is so limited from what my inner man wants to Express I can't even worship him in the way that my inner man really wants to worship him because I'm limited by this body [Applause] amen amen y'all were supposed to sing amen do you love him [Music] do you love him Amy do you love him amen amen amen you think anybody you got a lost loved one you think they'd come back for one moment to this limited confined body after being in that new body brother Brandon preaches and garnet Peaks funeral he begins to speak and he he says there I think I had that brother Jordan on the last slide he begins to speak it and this he says he's gone from us we realized that but he says I wonder if really there's such a thing as this being the end of it we're all conscious that that boy is going from us it's life but let's think I love this I gotta in bold what's next is there anything we could say could we ever see him again is this the last we're gonna see of garnet can you be sure that we're gonna see him again Jobe ask this question the oldest book in the Bible he said if a man die shall he live again is there any proof then that this is so could we have any physical proof that this resurrection is so it begins to talk about that leaf brother and it begins to illustrate that and because I say you watch that tree and he says did you take that life and he says you take the leaf he says what is that leaf of that tree it's the expression it's all of the vibrancy all of the vitality all of the potential of that trees and that leaf and he says that it blends and it makes shade for every pastor behind and he says oh and what is it it's a sign of life there's life from that little leaf and he says oh it just springs up he said it just lives it it lives he says every day it's it waves in the wind he said just praising the Lord all the time and he says but you watch he says that's that that's that's in that season of life he says that season of life he says but then he says watch what happens says the winner what is it he says the season changes you ever you know I know we remember there was talking about that today I know y'all don't experience a lot of seasons here in Tucson we don't actually back home experience it's real short were there we don't experience a lot of them back home either where our weather is very much the same except for about three times as much humidity but you you you you notice all the seasons of life as we spoke on it this morning prophet of God says what is this is that season changes you can feel you can feel it back home you can feel when we're going from winter to spring though we don't have much of a winter at all you know it's very similar to here but you can feel something almost in the atmosphere you could almost feel something's changed you walk outside you smell smells of pollen and pine pollen and oak pollen things you've never experienced you never had yeah I had it all through the winter and suddenly got that season changes and you can just you feel that something's coming the Jasmine starts to bloom and you smell the the the smell of you see all the green that that life of that brown life starts to turn green and starts to get real bright and almost in the middle of spring man it's just it's almost neon colored it's so bright green and it's my favorite time of year the spring season cuz that means turkey season and that's pretty much like heaven to me heaven on this side and and you can just feel the atmosphere shift and you feel it change but the band says watch what happens you said that leaf is in the fullness of its life he says but then you feel this to change and he says and that leaf begins to he says it just begins to lower from the stem and go lower and he says and then two gets colder and he says the winter begins to come on and he says then the wind one wind blow and he says and that leaf will just detach he says and you watch that life that used to be and he says what is he says life death and he says then you watch that death and you said you could watch it as it spins around and it makes its way to the earth and he says and then it falls and it hits the ground and he says and then after a while it says the wind begins to blow and he says it blows the soil overtop of that leaf and what does it do he says it buries that leaf and he says and what used to be life he says what do you have you have death you have burial and he says what is it it's it's all creation it's all nature that's why Paul says in Romans nine he says men will be without excuse because even nature cries out from the glory of God even nature exhibits in itself death and burial and resurrection and he says you watch that leaf he says as it's buried and he says and all the life leaves it and he says and he says and what used to be he says you watch that little leaf he says it's going there he says you know it's you may have lost a loved one in this life as you watch us maybe they were bright vibrant but she watches their life begins to fade and then you bury you bury that loved one he says what is it's a season of death brother Branham says what is it he says some voice some mechanism he says when that winter begins to come he says some voice he says tells that SAP and that tree to leave the tree and he says and that SAP goes down inside of all the life leaves the the tree the the the in the inward trees we spoke on it this morning and all that SAP goes down and to the roots he says science you know they can they can break it apart they can put a letter a molecule they can study it he says but they'll never find the germ of life because it's a mystery it's a mystery God holds for himself it's like the the the the you know the story of the scientist who got so scientific and said oh we don't need God you know we can week week we can create organs we artificial hearts and artificial skin we could create artificial hair we don't need God we don't need to create it would even need God sciences Excel to such a point God says you don't need me to say we don't need you anymore guys so we can build our own man we can build eyes we can build hands we could build hair god says ok no problem but get your own dirt it's your own dirt are you gonna get dirt from what is it brother man it says it's the mystery the germ of life is a mystery he says they could break it down he says they don't even understand what intelligence in that tree tells that SAP to leave the tree because if the SAP was the stay in the tree it freeze and break in the tree would die he says but there's some mystery of life he says it's a mixture of life and intelligence inside that tree he says that Allah tells the SAP to leave the tree and to go into the earth again and he says they can't explain it but it's the mystery of God and brother Brennan says and that proves what it proves there's life it proves there's death it proves there's a burial he says but you just wait and he says and when that season of spring wind begins to blow he said nothing can stop that sap from coming back in that tree again and he says in that little leaf that died that was buried poof sprouts again prophet of God said you may bury a loved one in this life you may have appreciated them for this life may have buried him in a cemetery he says all but one resurrection morning when their season of the resurrection he says nothing will stop those dead loved ones and dead Saints from coming out of the ground why it's a law and a but a mystery of life death burial resurrection Oh heaven declares the glory of the risen Lord Oh heaven and all earth declare of his glory and death if the musicians could come it's just a mere breaking of that fragile shell let me say this to you at the precise moment is what the Lord led us to preach on so I'm not going to try to explain God I'm just going to be obedient at the precise moment that God decides our shell has fulfilled its purpose got tasty and the death of his Saints are appointed that's why we don't fear we sorrow but Jesus says but don't sorrow is the world sorrows who has no hope no sorrow is the world Jesus says he says you but you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it weren't so would had told you he says but I go and prepare a place and he says and if I go I'll come back to receive you to take you to that place it's an eternal reality it's an internal reality it's a reality the Apostle Paul had in Philippians 1 verse 21 such a reality that this man had notice what he says Philippians 1 brothers verse Philippians 1 verse 20 notice the reality of this man who lived life full life and he says for to me to live is Christ and to die [Music] it's all crazy it's out of his mind or was Paul in touch that you talk like that is completely foreign to the world today completely absent we become as we said they they they they desire so little then won't life life life Paul says Paul says it this way he says for I am in a strait betwixt having a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far better he says yet for your sake for what for the sake of edification of the believers for the edification to ground the converts that he had he says I'll stay in the shell for now he says I'll abide in the flesh it's what Paul says he says having a desire to the part to be with Christ which is far better verse 24 he says nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you asked that question today what a Paul no where's the world don't know Paul says you know he would Paul showing a lack of respect for life no Paul lived his life well Paul let me just let me just let me just I'm burning my heart Harris we're close because I'm just gonna feel unsatisfied of his stuff Paul said I thought I kept in other words Paul was saying I didn't waste precious life God gave me he didn't sit there I just want to die I just want to go you don't know none of us wouldn't say that here today none of us would say here no I just can't wait I can't wait for life to be over can't wait no none of us all of us have a desire to live forever it comes from God but what Paul said is I've lived my life well I've ran my race well I've counted I've counted every day that I've had I've made use of everything God has given me and I say today Lord let me make use of the life that you've put in my body Lord let me make let me use the breath can you say that today let me use the breath you've given me which is a gift from God let me use it in the right way let me use the word and the tongues and the thoughts and the inspiration to express life to other people not [Music] let me use the life you've given me for a good purpose T'Pol life was just that it was a gift Oh can we realize can we recognize that as believers here today you got a gift which you're here today what are you doing that gift standing here for you Paul it overcome the fear what he called the steam death that's why I could say it's better to die and be with the Lord than the standard let me say it this way those who die in Christ we say all we lost we lost we lost you know what they they didn't lose they won were the losers yeah they're the winners it's been that way preach anonymous the Holy Spirit doesn't begin to stir my heart number your counter days appreciate every bit of life God gives you make it count make every moment count you have with your loved ones with those that are around you with those that God has surrounded you with what are you giving out do I give out bitterness and anger and do I get out frustrations I give out jealousies listen my brother my sister life is too precious to spend it bitter over something that happened to you life is too precious to spend it and hatefulness and and and ending and tearing down somebody or represented somebody or criticizing somebody life is too precious you ought to use it for the right thing by your heads with me if you could hear today [Music] [Music] we look at lofts in such a different way in this perspective of humanity it's tragic and tragedy you go through as we said this morning life is all about losing this life it's all about losing you may not have experienced that yet maybe you're young if you go through this life it's about good times and bad time - Solomon says - everything there's a season the time to be born a time to die time to shell time the dance time to cry time to mourn time to laugh it's all about the balance of serving God and balancing all of them oh we lost so much old but let me say to you maybe you've lost I'm just gonna say this because the Holy Spirit impressed upon my heart maybe you've lost someone in your life but let me say you might look at that as lost but if your spiritual eyes and spiritual ears if God could just open your spiritual ears just for a moment if he could open your spiritual eyes and you could look beyond the curtain you'd see that dear loved one on God's side of the universe walking and then under the pure crystal river of eternal life as they begin to shout I won I won I'm free and last Opress own dear people of Earth they're those that are in life there's nothing to fear death has no stink it's real life it's real joy it's real happiness thrill living it's the positive to this negative and let me say this Satan cannot destroy a child of God Satan might be permitted to touch job's life the choice flesh afflict his body but he couldn't take his life because garlic God gives life and God takes life that's what Paul says in Romans 8 I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory would shall be revealed enough oh maybe you're here tonight you just wanna raise a hand say Lord let me taste of that internal reality all I can become soul so finite in my thinking so earthbound today Lord I want to become heaven bound I want to look to heavenly things it's Paul said think things that are lovely things that are pure things that are of a good report if there be any praise if their being at glory think own these things take on these thing Lord Jesus so glad some happy in her heart we have an anchor it keeps this steadfast sure oh god it's fastened to a rock - the rock that cannot move this world shaking Lord it's shaking it's quaking it's moving Lord it's filled with swift transition changes every day Lord but we have a hope that never changes one that's ever sure one that remains the same though the whole world gives OH on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand I put my hope I put my confidence I put my faith not in this life not in what I can see not on what I could hear bold but want that inner man long but that inner man cries out for Lord that's life that's the real me help me to be help us to be help us to live our life in touch with that eternal reality Lord Jesus we pray granite Lord to each granite to young granite to old may we pondered
