[0:00] time once more
[0:03] in his time.
[0:08] In your time
[0:13] you make all things beautiful
[0:19] in your time,
[0:24] Lord. My life to you I bring.
[0:30] Great song I have to sing
[0:36] to you. A lovely thing
[0:41] in your time.
[0:45] Amen. Thank you so much.
[0:49] And good evening.
[0:53] Tonight,
[0:54] with the Lord's help, we conclude our
[0:56] series on the life of David. We've
[1:00] skipped much of his life, including
[1:02] famous stories like his defeat of
[1:05] Goliath. Instead, we've been focusing on
[1:08] those events that have psalms
[1:11] specifically tied to them to try and
[1:14] catch a glimpse of his heart in those
[1:17] situations. And for the most part, we
[1:20] have explored all of the psalms that are
[1:22] tied to specific identifiable narrative
[1:26] events in David's life. It's hard
[1:30] sometimes to fathom this complex man of
[1:33] seemingly great contradictions to to
[1:35] look into his heart, his motivations,
[1:39] to see what God saw in David, a man
[1:42] after his own heart. We followed his
[1:45] life mostly through the books of Samuel
[1:48] with minor fillins from the Chronicles.
[1:50] But how to conclude with a summary?
[1:54] other events in his life without
[1:56] corresponding psalms, just various
[1:59] psalms. Lessons we can draw from these
[2:02] many possibilities. If I concluded
[2:05] tonight with a narrative of the end of
[2:08] his life through the lens of Samuel and
[2:10] Kings, you might be shocked
[2:13] if you haven't read or remembered them
[2:15] or or saddened if you had of of his
[2:18] pride and his thirst for vengeance.
[2:21] If instead I read from 1 Chronicles, it'
[2:24] be telling of his co-regency with
[2:26] Solomon to ensure a smooth transition of
[2:29] royal power, sparing the nation from yet
[2:31] another civil war. And you'd be in some
[2:35] degree in awe at his love for the Lord,
[2:38] expressing his meticulous planning for
[2:41] the temple, which the Lord forbade him
[2:44] from building. forbade because he had
[2:47] shed too much blood. As the prophet
[2:49] Nathan said, he was too violent, too
[2:51] ready to kill.
[2:53] What to do?
[2:55] Before we open our Bibles to read, let's
[2:58] unite our hearts, purge our thoughts,
[3:01] and approach the Lord that he guide what
[3:04] is spoken and what is heard this
[3:06] evening.
[3:08] Lord Jesus,
[3:09] we're in awe of you. Lord, we're
[3:12] standing in your presence. Lord, we know
[3:15] that you're here and we desire to feel
[3:18] your spirit move amongst us, Lord. Lord,
[3:21] I pray that you would help me to be out
[3:24] of the way to get my head out of all
[3:26] this, Lord. That that you just might
[3:28] express yourself this evening, Lord, and
[3:30] that whatever is said, Lord, would be of
[3:33] help to those who are listening, Lord.
[3:36] Lord, we we look to you for guidance. We
[3:39] look to you for everything. We thank you
[3:41] for your word. We thank you for everyone
[3:44] that's gathered here, Lord. Our brothers
[3:46] and sisters, Lord, not just our brothers
[3:48] and sisters, my brothers and sisters.
[3:52] And Lord, I just pray that you would
[3:55] speak to us, speak through us, have your
[3:57] will, have your way. We thank you in
[4:01] Jesus precious name. Amen.
[4:05] Before
[4:06] you're seated, tonight our focus will be
[4:09] on the heart motive. What we can learn
[4:14] regarding what God wants from us. We'll
[4:19] start with only eight verses, but from
[4:21] four places,
[4:23] Matthew 5 and Leviticus 19 and
[4:27] Deuteronomy 25
[4:30] and Psalm 139.
[4:33] From the sermon on the mount, Jesus
[4:35] speaking. Matthew 5:43. You have heard
[4:38] that it hath been said, "Thou shalt love
[4:41] thy neighbor and hate thine enemy."
[4:46] Said, "By whom?" What was he referring
[4:49] to? In Leviticus 19, we read, "Thou
[4:54] shalt not hate thy brother in thine
[4:55] heart. Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy
[4:59] neighbor and not suffer sin upon him."
[5:02] It's a little hard to understand. The
[5:04] another translation reads, "You shall
[5:06] not hate your fellow countrymen in your
[5:08] heart. You may certainly rebuke your
[5:10] neighbor, but you are not to incur sin
[5:12] because of him." Continuing, "Thou shalt
[5:15] not avenge, nor bear any grudge against
[5:19] the children of thy people, but thou
[5:21] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,
[5:26] and listen up because I am the Lord."
[5:30] That's pretty clear about loving your
[5:33] neighbor. What about hating your enemy?
[5:37] Perhaps uh he was thinking of
[5:39] Deuteronomy 25.
[5:41] Remember what Amalecch did unto thee by
[5:44] the way when ye were come forth out of
[5:46] Egypt? How he met thee by the way, and
[5:49] smokeote the hindmost of thee, even all
[5:51] that were feeble behind thee when thou
[5:54] was faint and weary. And he feared not
[5:57] God. Therefore, it shall be, when the
[6:00] Lord thy God hath given thee rest from
[6:02] all thine enemies roundabout, and the
[6:05] land which the Lord thy God giveth thee
[6:07] for an inheritance to possess it, that
[6:10] thou shalt blot out the remembrance of
[6:12] Amalecch from under heaven, and thou
[6:14] shalt not forget it. Thou shalt not
[6:16] forget to do so.
[6:19] We recall from our studies here, it was
[6:21] an Amalachite that killed the grievously
[6:24] wounded Saul at Saul's request and
[6:27] brought the news of Saul's and
[6:28] Jonathan's deaths to David. Later, David
[6:33] wrote in Psalm 139,
[6:36] "Do not I hate them, oh Lord, that hate
[6:39] thee, and am I not grieved with those
[6:42] that rise up against thee? I hate them
[6:45] with perfect, that means complete
[6:47] hatred. I count them my enemies.
[6:51] Please be seated.
[6:57] We've seen in the era and culture of
[7:00] David's time that punishment, earned or
[7:03] not, was harsh and swift. A messenger
[7:06] brings a message you don't like, kill
[7:09] the messenger.
[7:11] The concept brought to ancient Israel
[7:14] through Moses was that there were
[7:17] certain rules or laws which came from
[7:19] God that applied to everyone from the
[7:23] slave to the foreigner often called the
[7:26] stranger to the king.
[7:29] This was unheard of. Monarchs, whether
[7:32] they were called kings or emperors or
[7:34] queens or pharaohs, were above any laws.
[7:38] Their commands were the law. This was a
[7:42] very new concept. Palace intrigue,
[7:46] assassination of siblings and other
[7:48] close relatives to seize or retain
[7:50] political power was the order of the
[7:52] day. Even in David's and Solomon's
[7:56] households, family members were murdered
[7:58] to help secure power or exact revenge.
[8:03] priests divide with secular rulers to
[8:05] establish power, influence, wealth.
[8:10] Internationally recognized borders did
[8:12] not exist. A lot of times if you if you
[8:14] try to look up a map and say, "Well, I
[8:16] wonder the border of this place was to
[8:17] that." And different maps will have them
[8:20] in different places when you go to
[8:22] ancient times because they weren't
[8:23] borders. They were frontiers.
[8:26] What you could defend was yours. what
[8:29] you couldn't became the property of some
[8:31] other nation or clan or group. There was
[8:34] constant fighting on the frontiers. In
[8:37] fact, it's only in the last century or
[8:39] so of our times that borders become
[8:41] generally recognized and peaceful within
[8:44] Western society.
[8:47] When Joshua led the conquest of Canaan,
[8:50] we read of definite boundaries or
[8:52] borders between each of the various
[8:54] clans or tribes. Some questions arose,
[8:57] but internal borders between them appear
[9:00] to have been respected by all of them.
[9:03] This is also something new. The fighting
[9:06] mostly occurred at the boundaries
[9:07] between what the nation of Israel or
[9:09] Judah claimed and what their neighbors,
[9:12] the Amalachites, Ammonites, Amorites,
[9:14] Philistines, Phoenicians, and so forth
[9:17] counter claimed as their territories.
[9:21] Focusing back on David,
[9:24] we saw that he refused to fight back
[9:27] when Saul tried to kill him. When it was
[9:30] clearly in his power to destroy Saul,
[9:34] David refused. Nor would he allow any of
[9:37] his followers to harm Saul.
[9:40] Beyond Saul, David was always looking
[9:42] out for the nation, the descendants of
[9:45] Jacob,
[9:47] his shepherd's heart.
[9:50] when he fled from Jerusalem ahead of
[9:52] Abselum's arrival from Hebron, he said
[9:54] he did it to protect the people of
[9:56] Jerusalem, sparing them from what today
[9:58] we'd call collateral damage.
[10:01] Recall last time we read Psalm 3. Let's
[10:03] let's briefly review it again.
[10:07] A psalm of David when he fled from
[10:09] Abselum.
[10:10] Lord, how are they increase that trouble
[10:14] me? Many are they that rise up against
[10:17] me. Many there be which say of my soul
[10:20] there's no help for him and God say
[10:24] even God can't or won't help him now
[10:27] David's situation appears hopeless but
[10:31] thou oh Lord art a shield for me my
[10:34] glory and the lifter up of mine head in
[10:39] the midst of my troubles I'll continue
[10:41] to thank I'll continue to praise you
[10:44] I'll hold to the promises you have given
[10:46] me Even as I stagger under your
[10:49] chastisement,
[10:51] I cried unto the Lord with my voice. He
[10:55] heard me out of his holy hill.
[10:58] Say la. Say lie, you know means
[11:00] something. Think about this. Ponder
[11:02] that. Absorb it.
[11:05] I laid me down and slept. I awake for
[11:08] the Lord sustained me. Even in the midst
[11:10] of all this pressure, this tension,
[11:12] running for his very life,
[11:16] he's not tossing and turning. He's
[11:17] getting a good night's sleep.
[11:20] His confidence in the Lord is such that
[11:22] he's able to do that.
[11:25] I will not be afraid of 10 thousands of
[11:28] people. Literally, the Hebrew word
[11:30] translated 10,000s means multitudes.
[11:33] multitudes of people that have set
[11:34] themselves against me round about, very
[11:38] literal. Arise, oh Lord, save me, oh
[11:41] God.
[11:43] He's fully aware of the mortal danger
[11:45] he's facing. Thou has smitten all my
[11:48] enemies upon the cheekbone. Thou hast
[11:50] broken the teeth of the ungodly,
[11:52] deprived them of their weapons, their
[11:54] strength, their stamina. Lord, you've
[11:56] done it before. You've promised. Please
[11:58] do it again.
[12:04] And a verse that really reveals his
[12:06] heart. Salvation belongs to the Lord.
[12:10] Thy blessing is upon thy people.
[12:13] Saha.
[12:15] Other translations say salvation,
[12:17] victory, deliverance. This is this is a
[12:20] a present tense kind of thing, not
[12:22] eventual salvation at some future time.
[12:26] This comes from the Lord. your blessing
[12:28] be on your people or may you bless your
[12:31] people. In other words, David was
[12:33] invoking the Lord to bless the very
[12:36] people who are chasing him.
[12:40] Why?
[12:42] They're his people.
[12:44] A shepherd's heart for his unruly sheep.
[12:50] Let's go back to that verse we read
[12:53] about Jesus sermon on the mount.
[12:56] You've heard it hath been said, "Thou
[12:58] shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine
[12:59] enemy." But I say unto you, love your
[13:03] enemies,
[13:05] bless them that curse you, do good to
[13:09] them that hate you, pray for them which
[13:13] despitefully use you, persecute you.
[13:18] Is this some new thing Jesus is
[13:20] proposing? Out with the old, in with the
[13:23] new. Isn't it what David was doing and
[13:26] asking God to bless the people that were
[13:28] chasing him?
[13:31] In another place, Jesus said he came not
[13:34] to destroy the law, but to fulfill it.
[13:37] Did that mean he was superseding or
[13:40] replacing it? Or did it mean his life
[13:43] was being lived in a way that was in
[13:46] compliance with fulfilling the
[13:48] requirements of the law?
[13:52] Let's look at two examples from the law.
[13:54] First, how to treat your neighbor.
[13:59] Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or
[14:01] his sheep go astray, and hide thyself
[14:04] from them. Thou shalt in any case bring
[14:07] them again unto thy brother. You can't
[14:10] pretend you didn't see him. And if thy
[14:13] brother be not nigh unto thee, or if
[14:15] thou know him not, then thou shalt bring
[14:17] it into thine own house, and shall be
[14:20] with thee until thy brother seek after
[14:22] it, and thou shalt restore it to him
[14:24] again.
[14:26] He can't pretend, can't keep it.
[14:29] And like manner shalt thou do with his
[14:31] ass, and so shalt thou do with his
[14:33] raignment. With all lost thing of thy
[14:35] brothers which he hath lost, and thou
[14:37] hast found, shalt thou do likewise. Thou
[14:40] mayest not hide thyself. You can't
[14:42] pretend you didn't notice or try to keep
[14:45] it for yourself.
[14:47] Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or
[14:49] his ox fall down by the way and hide
[14:51] thyself from them. Thou shalt surely
[14:54] help him to lift them up again. You have
[14:58] to stop and render aid.
[15:02] That's how you would treat your
[15:03] neighbor. What does the law say
[15:05] regarding how to treat your enemy?
[15:09] Exodus 23. If thou meet thine enemy's ox
[15:13] or his ass going astray, thou shalt
[15:16] surely bring it back to him again.
[15:20] If thou see the ass of him that hateth
[15:22] thee lying under his burden, and would
[15:25] forbear to help him, thou shalt surely
[15:29] help with him.
[15:32] These instruct us to help to assist our
[15:35] enemies, those that hate us in the same
[15:39] way we help and assist our neighbor. In
[15:44] some sense, there's no difference. So,
[15:48] we see that Jesus is really telling
[15:50] people that the law instructs helping
[15:52] those that oppose us. Not to help them
[15:54] to oppose us, but to help them as
[15:57] people, as neighbors.
[16:05] I'm reminded of a conversation I had uh
[16:08] with a neighbor shortly after we moved
[16:09] back to Tucson a dozen years ago. I'd
[16:12] sometimes go for a walk around the
[16:14] block, the place that we lived at that
[16:15] time. A fellow a few houses down would
[16:18] sometimes be out at the same time. We
[16:20] occasionally walked together and
[16:22] chatted.
[16:24] I forgotten the details, but in one of
[16:26] our conversations as we walked, he
[16:28] turned to me and commented, "We hate the
[16:31] sin, but we must love the sinner."
[16:35] Again, we saw David do exactly that and
[16:38] his relationship with Saul.
[16:42] Recently, Heather and I were viewing a
[16:44] lecture as part of a course on Jesus and
[16:47] his Jewish influences, trying to gain
[16:49] perspective on the era, the culture in
[16:53] which Jesus lived. The professor made a
[16:56] statement that was an aha moment for me.
[17:00] The light bulb went off, but but but it
[17:02] turned on at that time.
[17:04] The statement was that there was an
[17:06] ongoing and had been going on for a long
[17:09] time, an ongoing controversy in the late
[17:12] second temple period
[17:14] regarding the meaning of neighbor.
[17:19] Let's take a look at this. It pertains
[17:21] to David as well as to us.
[17:25] Recall that the land of Israel was under
[17:27] foreign rule from a little before 700 BC
[17:32] and including Judah from about 600 BC.
[17:35] We've talked about that when we went
[17:36] through the the books of the Old
[17:38] Testament. Assyrians, Babylonians,
[17:41] Persians,
[17:43] Greeks, Seucids, a very brief period of
[17:47] independence under the Hasminians of the
[17:49] Mcabes. than subjugation once again
[17:53] under Rome.
[17:56] We're all familiar with the Ten
[17:57] Commandments, though we may have trouble
[17:59] reciting them. That's okay. I'm not
[18:01] going to ask. No test. The various laws
[18:04] and rules that came under Moses, a total
[18:07] of 613 that we read in the in the Torah,
[18:10] the first five books, were mostly
[18:13] dealing with various punishments,
[18:15] remedies, and practices. The commandment
[18:18] might say, "Thou shalt not steal." Well,
[18:19] what do you do if somebody does steal?
[18:21] Well, here's the rules. This is how you
[18:23] deal with it. At least twice.
[18:27] Jesus reduced all of this to two
[18:31] commandments.
[18:34] We'll first look at the second time that
[18:36] he did that, which was during his final
[18:38] week in Jerusalem.
[18:43] But when the Pharisees had heard that
[18:45] Jesus had put the Sadducees to silence,
[18:48] they were gathered together. And then
[18:50] one of the Pharisees, which was a
[18:52] lawyer, asked Jesus a question, tempting
[18:55] him. It means testing Jesus. The
[18:57] questioner already knew the correct
[18:59] answer. And saying, "Master," which
[19:03] means teacher, not owner or boss,
[19:05] "master, which is the great commandment
[19:09] in the law?
[19:11] Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt love
[19:13] the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
[19:15] with all thy soul, with all thy mind."
[19:17] This is the first and great commandment.
[19:21] The second is like unto it. "Thou shalt
[19:23] love thy neighbor as thyself.
[19:26] On these two commandments hang all the
[19:28] law and the prophets."
[19:32] That's a very striking statement. On
[19:34] these two commandments hang all the law
[19:37] and the prophets.
[19:40] Isn't it interesting that neither of
[19:42] these are mentioned in neither of these
[19:44] are part of the ten commandments?
[19:48] The first of the ten commandments tells
[19:49] us we must not worship other gods but
[19:52] says nothing about loving God and
[19:55] certainly not the degree of love that
[19:56] God wants. We're told in the ten
[19:59] commandments to not kill or steal or lie
[20:02] or covet regarding others.
[20:05] We're not told we should love them.
[20:08] We read about loving your neighbor in
[20:10] our opening verses from Leviticus. The
[20:12] commandment to love the Lord is also
[20:15] found in the law of Moses. In
[20:17] Deuteronomy 6, we read
[20:20] here, "O Israel, the Lord our God is one
[20:24] Lord." I think I've told you before when
[20:26] I would ride the bus to work in Israel
[20:29] and they would turn on the radio station
[20:31] at 6 am or whenever the radio stations
[20:34] came on then and they would be singing
[20:36] this very song the Israel Adonia Adonai
[20:42] every morning in Israel if you turn the
[20:44] radio on you would awaken to this
[20:46] commandment here. Oh Israel, the Lord
[20:48] our God is one Lord. Thou shalt love the
[20:51] Lord thy God how much? with all thine
[20:54] heart, with all thy soul, with all thy
[20:58] mind.
[21:01] Consider
[21:03] love is a it's a relational word. It's
[21:06] not a behavior.
[21:09] Love speaks to motive.
[21:12] Jesus is driving at the motive, not the
[21:14] action or the behavior. You should
[21:17] worship God because you love God, not
[21:20] because you're afraid of punishment. If
[21:22] you don't, you don't mistreat your
[21:24] neighbor out of fear of punishment if
[21:26] you get caught,
[21:28] but because you love him or her and
[21:30] therefore desire the best for them.
[21:35] We're being told that the motive is more
[21:37] important than the specific action and
[21:41] that the motive must be love, not fear.
[21:46] Micah, a person after David, but before
[21:48] Jesus, said in Micah 6, "Wherewith shall
[21:51] I, how shall I come before the Lord and
[21:54] bow myself before the high God? Shall I
[21:58] come before him with burnt offerings,
[21:59] with calves of a year old? Will the Lord
[22:03] be pleased with thousands of rams, or
[22:06] with 10,000s of rivers of oil? Shall I
[22:10] give my firstborn for my transgression,
[22:12] the fruit of my body, for the sin of my
[22:15] soul?
[22:17] He hath showed thee, oh man, what is
[22:20] good. And what does the Lord require of
[22:23] thee, but to do justly, to love mercy,
[22:27] to walk humbly with thy God.
[22:31] When Jesus was asked about the greatest
[22:33] commandment, as we just read, his answer
[22:36] was not unexpected.
[22:42] In Mark's account of this event, we
[22:44] learn of the reaction of the questioner.
[22:49] And one of the scribes, Matthew told us
[22:51] he was a Pharisee and a lawyer, came and
[22:55] having heard Jesus and the Sadducees
[22:57] reasoning together, and perceiving that
[22:59] Jesus had answered them well, asked
[23:02] Jesus, "Which is the first commandment
[23:05] of all?"
[23:06] And Jesus answered him, "The first of
[23:09] all commandments is here. O Israel, the
[23:12] Lord our God is one God. Thou shalt love
[23:14] the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
[23:16] with all thy soul, with all thy mind,
[23:18] with all thy strength." This, this is
[23:20] the first commandment. And the second is
[23:23] like, "Name this, thou shalt love thy
[23:24] neighbors thyself. There's none other
[23:27] commandment greater than these."
[23:31] And the scribe said unto him, "Well,
[23:35] master, again, master means teacher."
[23:38] Well, master, thou hast said the truth,
[23:41] for there is one God. There is none
[23:43] other but he. To love him with all the
[23:46] heart, with all the understanding, with
[23:48] all the soul, with all the strength, to
[23:50] love his neighbor as himself is more
[23:52] than all whole burnt offerings and
[23:54] sacrifices.
[23:56] They're they're saying this in the
[23:57] grounds of the temple where sacrifices
[24:01] are being offered.
[24:04] And when Jesus saw that the Pharisee,
[24:06] lawyer, scribe answered discreetly,
[24:09] Jesus said to him, "Thou art not far
[24:12] from the kingdom of God."
[24:15] Now, we're starting to get to the crux
[24:17] of the matter. The question that was
[24:18] being asked and discussed,
[24:21] the matter that was driving wedges
[24:23] between people who should have been
[24:26] standing together.
[24:31] That sounds all too familiar sometimes.
[24:33] It's a question of doctrine, of of
[24:37] meaning, of interpretation.
[24:41] Just who exactly is my neighbor?
[24:46] We've all heard of the Dead Sea Scrolls,
[24:49] preserved fragments of the library, the
[24:51] Kuman community, generally agreed to be
[24:53] a sect known as the Essenes.
[24:57] In addition to priceless copies of
[24:59] almost the entire Hebrew Bible and
[25:03] pushing
[25:04] the oldest copies of the Bible back by a
[25:07] thousand years or more back to about 200
[25:09] or 100 BC, there were many other
[25:12] documents found that related to the
[25:14] Kuman texts beliefs and doctrines.
[25:20] One of these is called the war scroll.
[25:25] It describes an apocalyptic battle
[25:27] between the sons of light and the sons
[25:30] of darkness.
[25:32] Naturally, the consider themselves to be
[25:36] well, we're the sons of light. Clearly,
[25:40] the sons of darkness,
[25:45] everyone who's not in a scene, if you
[25:48] don't agree with us, clearly you're
[25:49] wrong. You're bad.
[25:52] Certainly, you're not my neighbor.
[25:55] the Pharisees, the Sadducees, everyone
[25:58] who disputed their calendars, their
[26:00] observances, the practices of the
[26:02] Essenes. Jerusalem's polluted, the
[26:05] temple polluted
[26:08] for the Essenes,
[26:10] their fellow neighbors, their neighbors
[26:13] were the fellow members of their
[26:16] community, their doctrine, their group,
[26:20] their denomination, their set of
[26:23] beliefs.
[26:24] the rest of the Jewish nation, sons of
[26:27] darkness,
[26:29] to be ultimately destroyed in their
[26:31] equivalent of the battle of Armageddon.
[26:35] Does any of this sound familiar?
[26:39] I find it scarily familiar.
[26:45] Earlier in his ministry, Jesus had a
[26:48] conversation about the meaning of
[26:50] neighbor. We're all familiar with it,
[26:52] but But let's read it. Let's consider it
[26:55] the context. Jesus had sent out 70
[26:59] disciples two by two to preach
[27:02] throughout Judea. And they had just
[27:04] returned and reporting back to him.
[27:06] Lord, this happened and this happened
[27:08] and it was so wonderful and it was so
[27:10] great.
[27:15] And behold,
[27:17] a certain lawyer, possibly, and I think
[27:20] probably one of the 70 returning
[27:23] disciples,
[27:25] stood up and tempted. We have a very
[27:27] negative connotation about the word
[27:29] tempted, but it means tested. He asked,
[27:34] it's a common practice, a common
[27:36] teaching technique. It doesn't
[27:38] necessarily mean he was challenging
[27:40] Jesus or trying to trip him up, but but
[27:43] he asked him, saying, "Master, teacher,
[27:46] what shall I do to inherit
[27:49] eternal life?"
[27:52] And Jesus said to him, "What's written
[27:55] in the law? How readest thou? What do
[27:59] you think?" Answering a question with a
[28:02] question. Again, it's a teaching
[28:04] technique. Jesus is the teacher and this
[28:07] this lawyer is the student, the
[28:10] disciple. Disciple means student, right?
[28:15] And he answering Jesus said,
[28:18] "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[28:21] all thy heart and with all thy soul,
[28:23] with all thy strength, with all thy
[28:25] mind, thy neighbors thyself."
[28:29] And Jesus said unto him, "Thou hast
[28:32] answered right. this do and thou shalt
[28:34] live. Good job. High fives. You got it.
[28:42] But he willing, wanting to justify
[28:45] himself, said unto Jesus,
[28:50] "But who is my neighbor?"
[28:53] Maybe what he's saying is, "There are
[28:54] some people that I I don't love, and in
[28:57] fact, I hate them, but they're not my
[28:59] neighbor, so it's okay, right?" He's
[29:01] trying to justify himself.
[29:05] And Jesus knows that he doesn't know the
[29:08] answer. So he's not going to ask him a
[29:10] question. He's going to give him the
[29:12] answer this time. Jesus answering said,
[29:16] "Who's your neighbor?" A certain man
[29:19] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
[29:22] fell among thieves, which stripped him
[29:25] of his raignment and wounded him, and
[29:28] departed,
[29:30] leaving him half dead.
[29:33] A certain man,
[29:36] might have been a Roman,
[29:39] one of the oppressors, not necessarily
[29:42] an Israelite. All we know is he was an
[29:45] adult. He was a male and he was a human.
[29:50] That's all we know.
[29:53] And and by chance there came down a
[29:56] certain priest that way. We assume we
[29:58] assume it's from Jerusalem to Jericho.
[30:00] It must be a Jewish priest, a Sadducee
[30:02] or a Pharisee. But Samaritans had
[30:05] priests. It could have been a Samaritan
[30:06] priest. We don't know.
[30:10] And when the priest saw the wounded man,
[30:15] the priest passed by on the other side
[30:17] of the road to remain ceremonially
[30:20] clean. He couldn't come near a dead
[30:22] body. He'd have to go through a whole
[30:24] procedure after that. He assumed the guy
[30:27] was dead and went on his way.
[30:30] Likewise, the Levite, thus associated
[30:33] with the temple and therefore with
[30:35] Judaism,
[30:37] when he was at the place where the
[30:38] injured man lay, he came, he came closer
[30:42] and looked on him and then crossed the
[30:46] road and passed by on the other side.
[30:48] Notice as we go down the chain of
[30:50] hierarchy, the passers by get closer
[30:52] from the priest to the Levite. The
[30:54] priest stays over. The Levite gets close
[30:57] enough to observe the guy
[31:01] to see he wasn't dead. Maybe he
[31:04] continued on his way looking over his
[31:05] shoulder in case the thieves which
[31:07] attacked the stranger was still in the
[31:09] area posing a danger to him. We don't
[31:11] know why. Jesus doesn't tell us why
[31:14] because that's not the point.
[31:19] But a certain Samaritan,
[31:22] despised, held at arms length by the
[31:24] general Jewish population, we're told.
[31:26] And Jesus is talking to a Jewish man. A
[31:29] Samaritan as he journeyed.
[31:33] Now, we're not told why a Samaritan
[31:35] would be traveling from Jerusalem down
[31:38] to Jericho. It's not exactly in or near
[31:40] Samaritan territory.
[31:43] Regardless, he's a traveler and he's
[31:46] riding on a donkey or or or some other
[31:48] animal.
[31:50] He came
[31:52] where the injured man was. And when the
[31:55] Samaritans saw him, he had compassion on
[31:58] him. He realized he wasn't dead. And
[32:03] dismounting
[32:05] went to him, bound up his wounds,
[32:08] pouring in oil and wine. And this isn't
[32:12] a doctrine if somebody is injured to
[32:14] pour oil and wine on them. It's it's the
[32:17] state of medicine and first aid 2,000
[32:19] years ago. We're a little further than
[32:20] that now. At least I hope.
[32:24] And seeing the injured man couldn't walk
[32:27] set him on his own beast. And the
[32:30] Samaritan now walking brought him to an
[32:33] inn and took care of him.
[32:37] And on the tomorrow
[32:40] when the Samaritan departed, he took out
[32:42] two pence, gave them to the host, the
[32:44] guy running the inn, and said to him,
[32:46] "Take care of him. Whatsoever thou
[32:49] spendest more? When I come again, I'll
[32:51] repay thee."
[32:54] Jesus then turns to the student lawyer,
[32:58] and says, "Which now of these three
[33:01] thinkst thou?
[33:03] Was a neighbor unto him that fell among
[33:06] the thieves?
[33:11] And the the student lawyer replies,
[33:15] "He that showed mercy on him." Then
[33:18] Jesus said unto him, "Go and do thou
[33:22] likewise."
[33:24] It may not be convenient. It may be out
[33:26] of your way. It may cost you to help
[33:29] somebody that is a complete stranger.
[33:34] Go and do likewise. Sometimes when I
[33:37] come to this part of the gospels, I I
[33:39] fail to see that command that Jesus just
[33:42] spoke. Be compassionate to others. Show
[33:45] mercy even if it's not convenient.
[33:50] At at this point, we've seen that the
[33:53] law and the prophets hang on these two
[33:55] commandments. Love God, love your
[33:58] neighbor.
[34:00] Did you know that Jesus compressed it
[34:02] even more to one commanded or or
[34:05] instruction of behavior based on these
[34:08] two which deal with motive?
[34:10] If I were to ask you, this isn't a test,
[34:14] but if I were to ask you to condense the
[34:18] law and the prophets, the practice
[34:21] of loving God and loving your neighbor
[34:24] into a single statement of 25 words or
[34:28] less, what would you say to me?
[34:34] What is the law and the prophets that
[34:36] hang from the love of God and love of
[34:40] neighbor?
[34:44] Okay, I shouldn't be listening. It
[34:46] wasn't a test. Matthew 7, therefore, all
[34:51] things whatsoever ye would that men
[34:53] should do to you, do you even so to
[34:56] them, for this is the law and the
[34:59] prophets.
[35:02] This is the law and the prophets. This
[35:05] behavior rooted in the motive of love.
[35:10] It's what hangs on the two commandments
[35:12] of loving God and loving your neighbor.
[35:15] Luke puts it this way.
[35:18] As you would that men should do to you,
[35:21] do ye also to them likewise.
[35:24] Skipping down a couple of verses.
[35:30] But love ye your enemies. Do good and
[35:33] lend hoping for nothing again.
[35:36] And your reward shall be great, and you
[35:39] shall be the children of the highest.
[35:43] Why? For he, the Lord, is kind unto the
[35:48] unthankful,
[35:50] and to the evil. Be ye therefore
[35:53] merciful,
[35:54] as your father also is merciful.
[35:58] And another place Jesus says, "Blessed
[36:00] are the merciful, for they shall obtain
[36:02] mercy."
[36:04] You know, I
[36:08] there's a
[36:11] this statement of Jesus was stated in a
[36:14] slightly different way by a by a Jewish
[36:16] sage of Jesus time, a fellow named
[36:19] Hillel is very highly respected guy. He
[36:22] became the president of the Sanhedrin.
[36:25] And if we take the dates that Josephus
[36:27] said this guy lived, then he probably
[36:29] would have been one of the main guys in
[36:32] the temple when Jesus was dedicated as a
[36:35] baby.
[36:36] And it's he was still alive. He may have
[36:39] been one of the people that Jesus was
[36:43] speaking with at 12 years old when his
[36:45] parents couldn't find him when they were
[36:47] on their way back to to uh Bethlehem and
[36:50] or back to Nazareth and Jesus was in the
[36:53] temple. astonishing people with with the
[36:55] depth of his knowledge and his grasp.
[36:58] We're told that Jesus grew in in wisdom.
[37:03] There was a a time and and Hill's
[37:06] grandson was a fellow named Galia who
[37:09] was one of the one that said, "Let's not
[37:11] judge these disciples of Jesus too
[37:13] quickly." And and was probably the very
[37:16] same Galia that taught Paul. And and
[37:19] there's a story
[37:21] it's recorded in the in the Babylonian
[37:24] Talmud, which is not scripture, but it's
[37:26] Jewish um commentary, if you will. Um
[37:31] and and it talks about a fellow. It says
[37:33] there was an incident involving a
[37:34] gentile who came before Shamai. Shami
[37:37] was a contemporary of Hillel also in the
[37:40] temple. Shamai was a very strict, rigid
[37:43] bump bump kind of a guy. And Hel was a
[37:47] little more
[37:49] Nice.
[37:51] He this this gentile came before Shemi
[37:54] and said, "Convert me to Judaism on
[37:57] condition that you teach me the entire
[38:00] Torah, the entire penetuk as I stand on
[38:02] one foot."
[38:07] Shemide chased him away. Get out of
[38:09] here.
[38:11] The same Gentile came before Hell
[38:14] and he said, "Convert me on condition
[38:16] that you teach me the entire Torah while
[38:18] I'm standing on one foot."
[38:21] And we're told that Hell converted him.
[38:25] How? He said to him,
[38:29] "That which is hateful to you, do not do
[38:32] to another." That is the entire Torah.
[38:35] The rest is its interpretation. Now go
[38:37] study.
[38:40] The same thing Jesus was saying. Do unto
[38:43] treat others the way you wish to be
[38:45] treated. The rest is commentary.
[38:49] This is the law and the prophets, said
[38:51] Jesus.
[38:52] I'm reminded of a story brother Daniel
[38:54] shared with us when when he worked at
[38:57] Voice of God in Jeffersonville. I may
[38:59] not have this perfectly accurate, but
[39:01] Daniel Jr. is here and he can sort me
[39:03] out. Thank you.
[39:07] Uh, as I recall, the power went out in
[39:09] the in the building where they were
[39:11] working and all the employees gathered
[39:13] together and might have been the
[39:14] cafeteria. I don't remember. Brother
[39:16] Billy Paul, brother Random's uh son, he
[39:19] talked a bit and he told them, you know,
[39:22] one thing is that he could never tell
[39:24] who was his father's friends and who
[39:27] were his enemies. He treated everyone
[39:29] alike.
[39:32] Brother Green told us of a time when he
[39:35] was with brother Random and Brother
[39:36] Random had related some some issues
[39:39] about a certain brother and he said
[39:42] sometime later they they were driving
[39:43] together near where that brother lived.
[39:46] Brother Brandham mentioned you know
[39:48] brother Perry if we had time we could
[39:50] stop in fellowship with brother soandso.
[39:53] Brother Green expressed surprise that
[39:56] brother Brandon would want to do that.
[39:59] Brother Random admonished brother Green.
[40:01] And he said, "Brother Perry, I'm
[40:03] disappointed in you. Just because he's a
[40:06] crook, he's still my brother."
[40:11] We could review the last years of
[40:14] David's life, how he found the place to
[40:16] build the temple, the preparations,
[40:20] his last words found in First Kings
[40:22] versus the closing of his life in 1
[40:24] Chronicles.
[40:26] Instead,
[40:29] let's look at how Paul described David
[40:32] in Hebrews 11, the chapter we often call
[40:35] the heroes of faith.
[40:37] We covered this in our opening lesson on
[40:40] David's life, it seems fitting to close
[40:43] with it as well.
[40:46] When Paul was recounting some of the
[40:47] heroes of faith in Hebrews chap 11, he
[40:51] wrote in verse 32,
[40:55] "What shall I say more?
[40:58] For the time would fail to tell me of
[41:00] Gideon hiding from the Philistines to
[41:02] thresh a little grain for his family.
[41:06] And of Bareric, who refused to do
[41:08] anything without Deborah accompanying
[41:10] him,
[41:12] and of Samson and his diance with
[41:16] Delilah,
[41:18] and of Jeffa, whose vow cost his
[41:21] daughter her life. Paul's telling us to
[41:24] stop looking at the weaknesses we all
[41:27] possess because God looks beyond our
[41:30] flaws. He looks for something else.
[41:35] That something else is a gift that he
[41:38] alone can give. Recall when Samuel went
[41:42] to Jesse's house to find the the person
[41:46] that was going to be the king after
[41:48] God's own heart that that the Lord
[41:50] admonished him don't look at the
[41:52] physical stature of this person.
[41:55] I look on the heart. God doesn't see as
[41:58] man sees.
[42:01] And of Jeff of David also and Samuel and
[42:06] of the prophets. I've highlighted David
[42:08] and the descriptions that apply to him
[42:10] in these verses in yellow.
[42:14] Who through their cleverness and skill?
[42:17] No. Who through their knowledge of
[42:19] doctrine?
[42:22] No. Political collection connections,
[42:25] their wealth,
[42:27] no. who through their faith,
[42:30] subdued kingdoms,
[42:33] wrought righteousness,
[42:35] obtained promises,
[42:37] stopped the mouths of lions,
[42:41] quenched the violence of fire, escaped
[42:44] the edge of the sword. We've covered
[42:47] these things. They're stirring your
[42:49] memory, I'm sure. out of weakness were
[42:52] made strong, waxed valiant in fight,
[42:56] turned to flight, the armies of the
[42:59] aliens,
[43:00] skipping to verse 38, of whom the world
[43:04] was not worthy. They wandered in deserts
[43:08] and mountains and dens and caves of the
[43:12] earth.
[43:14] We've seen all of that play out in
[43:16] David's life. And these all having
[43:20] obtained a good report through their
[43:23] merits.
[43:24] No,
[43:26] through the gift God gave to them, their
[43:28] faith receive not the promise.
[43:32] God having provided some better thing
[43:35] for us
[43:37] that they without us
[43:41] should not be made perfect,
[43:43] should not be made complete.
[43:46] David, the great king whose love of God
[43:49] is expressed in so many psalms and in
[43:53] the record of his life is waiting
[43:57] on me. He's waiting on you. He's waiting
[44:01] on us. We are none of us complete
[44:07] without all of us
[44:10] throughout time.
[44:12] And it is through the gift of faith.
[44:16] The gift. Ephesians 2. For by grace are
[44:20] ye saved. Through faith. And that not of
[44:24] yourselves. It is what? The gift of God.
[44:30] Why? Not of works. Lest any man should
[44:34] boast. It's a gift. God is sovereign. We
[44:39] are not. It's only our pride or
[44:41] arrogance that might suggest that we
[44:43] are.
[44:48] The life of David
[44:51] is full of lessons for us. Like me,
[44:55] he was not perfect. As brother Aaron
[44:58] said, it gives us hope. He had a temper.
[45:02] He held grudges, lashed out. He he
[45:05] murdered Uriah to try and hide his sin.
[45:09] But he was also able to sincerely
[45:12] repent,
[45:13] to worship,
[45:15] to try his best under difficult
[45:18] circumstances.
[45:20] He spared Saul when he could have easily
[45:22] killed him to claim the throne that God
[45:25] had promised him. This guy's out trying
[45:27] to kill me. God told me I'm going to
[45:29] succeed him. He's right there. I've got
[45:32] the sword.
[45:36] We're all flawed. We're all imperfect.
[45:41] And in our relationship with God and
[45:43] with each other, as Jesus pointed out to
[45:46] us, we must come from the right the
[45:51] right motive. I I remember
[45:54] brother Random often said, "Can you do
[45:57] something? Check your motive and your
[46:00] objective.
[46:02] Why are you doing it?
[46:05] What are you trying to achieve? Remember
[46:09] the words of Jesus to the lawyer
[46:10] questioning him. He answering Jesus
[46:13] said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[46:15] with all thy heart, with all thy soul,
[46:18] with all thy strength, with all thy
[46:19] mind, thy neighbor as thyself." And
[46:22] Jesus said unto him, "Thou hast answered
[46:26] right. This do, and thou shalt live."
[46:31] Physicians would would please return.
[46:34] Our motive is more important to God than
[46:38] our deeds.
[46:40] From the sermon on the mount, Jesus
[46:42] speaking, "Not everyone that saith unto
[46:45] me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
[46:48] kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the
[46:50] will of my father which is in heaven.
[46:54] Many will say to me in that day, Lord,
[46:57] Lord, have we not prophesied in thy
[47:00] name? and thy name have cast out devils.
[47:03] In thy name done many wonderful works,
[47:06] had powerful ministries. We led people
[47:09] to you. We foretold events accurately.
[47:13] People were healed. Lord, we did the
[47:15] very same things you did that you showed
[47:18] us. Clearly, this is doing the will of
[47:21] the father. Hallelujah.
[47:24] And then I will profess unto them,
[47:27] I never knew you. Depart from me, ye
[47:31] that work iniquity.
[47:34] I never knew you. Never had a
[47:37] relationship.
[47:39] It isn't what you did. It was a motive
[47:43] behind it. And if that motive isn't
[47:45] love, genuine, heartfelt, honest love of
[47:49] God and your neighbor.
[47:52] Oops.
[47:54] Love isn't an attitude or a reservoir of
[47:57] knowledge.
[47:58] It's relationship. And that's what Jesus
[48:02] wants and requires with us.
[48:06] A relationship.
[48:10] In spite of his flaws,
[48:12] David loved the Lord with all his heart.
[48:16] And the Lord loved David.
[48:18] David, in spite of his rank as king, was
[48:22] able to humble himself before God.
[48:28] just as he had as a young boy tending
[48:30] his father's sheep. Later as king, he
[48:34] wasn't too proud to ask forgiveness, to
[48:37] admit his faults, confess his sins,
[48:40] accept God's correction,
[48:43] excuse me.
[48:44] And Jesus was known as the son of David.
[48:49] Not of Judah or of Solomon or Hezekiah
[48:53] or Josiah,
[48:55] not of Abraham or Isaac or Jacob.
[48:59] But as a son of David,
[49:03] my prayer,
[49:06] my fervent prayer is that together,
[49:11] in spite of our flaws, we will be known
[49:14] as sons and daughters of God.
[49:19] As we close this portion of the service,
[49:22] this series on David, let's stand.
[49:27] Excuse me.
[49:28] I'd like to sing from some of the songs
[49:31] that David wrote. They were the song and
[49:34] praise book of ancient Israel. The words
[49:36] he's penned are still true and just as
[49:40] powerful today.
[49:44] First from Psalm 139.
[49:49] Search me, oh God.
[49:51] [Music]
[49:54] Search me, oh God,
[50:01] and know my heart
[50:05] today.
[50:07] [Music]
[50:10] Try
[50:12] me,
[50:14] oh Savior.
[50:19] Know my thoughts
[50:22] I pray.
[50:27] See
[50:29] if
[50:31] there be
[50:35] some wicked
[50:38] way
[50:40] in me.
[50:45] cleans
[50:47] me
[50:48] from every
[50:51] sin
[50:53] and set
[50:55] me
[50:57] free.
[51:00] H how how will he do this this searching
[51:04] and this cleansing from Psalm 51?
[51:08] Create in me a clean heart.
[51:11] [Music]
[51:14] created
[51:16] that
[51:18] you are,
[51:21] oh God,
[51:26] and renew a right spirit within me.
[51:36] Create in me a clean heart,
[51:44] oh God,
[51:48] and renew a right spirit within me.
[51:59] Cast me not away
[52:03] from thy presence,
[52:07] oh Lord.
[52:10] Take not thy holy spirit from me.
[52:20] Restore
[52:22] unto me
[52:26] the joy of thy salvation.
[52:32] And renew a thy spirit within me.
[52:40] and with a searched heart and and a
[52:43] cleansed heart will then be able to
[52:46] realize what was written in Psalm 19.
[52:53] The love of the Lord is perfect,
[52:59] converting the soul.
[53:04] The testimony of the Lord is sure.
[53:10] making wise the simple.
[53:15] More to be desired are they than gold,
[53:21] yay, than much fine gold.
[53:26] Sweeter also than honey
[53:31] and the honey cold.
[53:37] The statutes of the Lord are right,
[53:42] rejoicing the heart.
[53:47] The commandment of the Lord is pure,
[53:53] enlightening the eyes.
[53:58] More to be desired are than gold, yay,
[54:03] than much fine gold.
[54:08] Sweeter also than honey,
[54:13] and the honey cold.
[54:19] The fear of the Lord is clean,
[54:24] enduring forever.
[54:29] The judgments of the Lord are true
[54:35] and righteous allto together.
[54:40] More to be desired are they than gold,
[54:45] gave than much fine gold.
[54:50] Sweeter also than honey,
[54:55] and the honey cold.
[55:00] Moreover, by them is thy servant warm.
[55:06] is thy servant war
[55:11] over my lamb.
[55:16] Is thy sour.
[55:21] The keeping of them there is great
[55:25] reward. There is great reward.
[55:31] and the keeping of them
[55:36] there is great reward.
[55:42] Amen. And in the keeping of them, if
[55:46] you'll surrender, he'll help you to keep
[55:48] them. They did their best to keep the
[55:51] law, but they failed. And they missed it
[55:54] here and they did there. But he promised
[55:57] I'll be in you be with you even in you
[56:01] and you can turn to him. So and I to
[56:06] think how Paul writes of these these
[56:10] great men in chapter 11
[56:13] and and brother Ly took a moment to show
[56:17] what was also recorded of them. But when
[56:20] God sees it through his perfect
[56:22] sacrifice, it's clean. It is well and
[56:26] amen. And it just as he was finishing
[56:29] and I asked him to get this song ready.
[56:32] I will serve thee because of I love
[56:35] thee.
[56:36] Oh, I will serve thee
[56:42] because I love you.
[56:47] You have given
[56:50] life to me.
[56:57] I was nothing
[57:01] before you found me.
[57:06] You have given
[57:10] life to me.
[57:16] Oh heartache,
[57:21] broken pieces,
[57:26] ruined lives
[57:29] are why you died on Calary.
[57:36] Your judge
[57:40] was what I long for.
[57:45] You have given
[57:51] me
[57:53] as brother Lyall was finishing up. If
[57:56] you just go ahead and keep playing that,
[57:59] it brought brought to memory where
[58:00] brother Brandham said, "There's they
[58:02] told the Lord told brother Brand there's
[58:04] going to be a test laid out for you
[58:05] today."
[58:07] and he's ministering
[58:09] and there was a couple sitting out in
[58:11] the congregation that been began to do
[58:14] things they shouldn't be doing got
[58:17] immoral and and all is going and the
[58:20] angel told him whatever you say is what
[58:24] will happen if you want them their life
[58:26] taken if you want them this
[58:29] but see it's a spirit of Christ that
[58:32] said I forgive you.
[58:36] And as hard as it is sometimes,
[58:39] [Music]
[58:41] it's to turn around and say, "It's okay.
[58:43] I forgive you." And in forgiveness
[58:47] that God can do, it's also blotted from
[58:50] his memory.
[58:51] It's not on a list that well, I forgive
[58:54] you until you do it again or if No, I
[58:57] forgive you. So the next time he says,
[59:00] and you say, "Lord, I've done it again."
[59:01] He says, "No, you haven't. This is the
[59:04] first time. And if you'll confess, he'll
[59:07] make it right.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful, loving Lord. Amen. One
[59:12] more time. I will serve thee.
[59:16] I will serve thee
[59:20] because I love thee.
[59:25] You have given
[59:29] life to me.
[59:35] I was nothing
[59:39] before you found me.
[59:44] You have given
[59:47] life to me.
[59:53] They were heartaches,
[59:58] broken pieces.
[1:00:03] Ruined lives
[1:00:06] are why you died on Calary.
[1:00:13] Your tongue
[1:00:16] was what I long for.
[1:00:21] You have gi
[1:00:25] life to me.
[1:00:30] Let's just bow our heads as as we close.
[1:00:34] Lord, we've we've spent some time and
[1:00:38] we also want to appreciate the time that
[1:00:40] Brother Ly spent
[1:00:44] studying, researching, waiting on you.
[1:00:49] And sometimes, Lord, we're waiting on
[1:00:50] the inspiration that doesn't seem to
[1:00:53] come.
[1:00:54] We turn our notes and we look this way
[1:00:57] and that way. Is this what it is? Lord,
[1:01:00] but I believe the words that you put on
[1:01:02] brother L's heart over this whole series
[1:01:05] is what we was what was meant to be.
[1:01:08] So, we want to appreciate you and
[1:01:10] appreciate our brother for doing that
[1:01:12] and ask a special blessing, just an
[1:01:15] encouragement, just a strengthening for
[1:01:16] brother Lyall to give this way, Lord.
[1:01:20] Father, and as our as this day ends and
[1:01:22] we go into a a new day, Lord, let us be
[1:01:26] uh just remember that Lord, you said you
[1:01:28] would never leave us,
[1:01:30] but you'd go with us. You would be in
[1:01:32] us, Lord, so we can have that rest,
[1:01:34] Father. We can have that peace, Lord, to
[1:01:37] each one, Lord. Remember our pastor,
[1:01:40] Brother Dan, as he he begins to head
[1:01:41] home tomorrow, Lord. May may he have a
[1:01:44] quick safe journey Lord and and we thank
[1:01:47] you for all that was accomplished Lord
[1:01:49] and the help that he was able to give
[1:01:51] and trust Lord the help that he was able
[1:01:53] to receive Lord. So we commit this day
[1:01:56] and the rest of our lives to you in the
[1:01:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:02:03] And if you'll remember me, Lord willing,
[1:02:05] Sunday morning, we'll be ministering for
[1:02:07] brother Robert Figaro
[1:02:09] and um and just that we can help them.
[1:02:13] So as we go, the longer I serve him, the
[1:02:17] sweeter he grows.
[1:02:19] [Music]
[1:02:21] Oh, the longer
[1:02:24] I serve him, the sweeter
[1:02:29] he grows,
[1:02:31] and the more that I love him, more
[1:02:36] lovely
[1:02:38] bestow.
[1:02:41] Each day is like heaven.
[1:02:45] My heart
[1:02:47] overflows.
[1:02:50] The longer
[1:02:52] I serve him, the sweeter he grows.
[1:02:59] The longer
[1:03:01] I serve him, the sweeter
[1:03:06] he grew.
[1:03:09] The more that I love him, more love he
[1:03:16] bestows.
[1:03:18] Each day is like heaven.
[1:03:22] My heart
[1:03:24] overflows.
[1:03:27] The longer I serve him, the sweeter.
[1:03:34] God bless you tonight. Oh, the longer
[1:03:38] I say,
[1:03:40] the sweeter
[1:03:43] he,
[1:03:45] the more that I love him, more loving.
[1:03:54] Each day is like heaven
[1:04:00] overflows
[1:04:03] along.
[1:04:05] I serve
[1:04:07] your sweetness.
[1:04:14] Oh, amazing
[1:04:17] grace,
[1:04:19] how sweet
[1:04:21] the sound
[1:04:24] that saved
[1:04:26] a wretch
[1:04:28] like me.
[1:04:33] I once
[1:04:35] was lost,
[1:04:38] but now
[1:04:40] I found.
[1:04:42] I was lost,
[1:04:44] but now
[1:04:47] I see.
[1:04:51] When we've
[1:04:54] been there
[1:04:56] 10,000
[1:04:59] years,
