[17:56] how many of us already got their ticket
[17:58] stamped and they know
[18:00] they're in that number amen
[18:03] you may be seated for a few moments here
[18:06] we do have prayer requests and some
[18:08] things
[18:09] to bring to your attention and i'd like
[18:11] to share a testimony
[18:14] it it's it's how mindful god is
[18:17] and it's
[18:18] there are no surprises with god
[18:21] he's not oh my i wasn't prepared for
[18:23] that you know he takes care of things
[18:24] but
[18:25] sister amelia has asked us to keep her
[18:28] in prayer as for an urgent
[18:31] need that she has also she's going to
[18:33] the dentist to have a tooth removed so
[18:35] just remember that and she shared the
[18:37] need
[18:39] for some work they're going to be doing
[18:40] in their home and she has to find a
[18:42] place for a few days but i know god will
[18:44] supply that need while they take care of
[18:46] that because
[18:48] he says i own the cattle on a thousand
[18:50] hills
[18:52] got a call
[18:54] this afternoon and it's amazing how god
[18:57] allows things to work out i was sitting
[18:59] in the
[19:00] there in front of the office resting a
[19:02] little bit and kind of dozing off
[19:05] and i thought i left the church door
[19:07] unlocked because usually my girls come
[19:08] in after and i got a call saying would
[19:11] you please open the door dad
[19:12] so i went out to open it but it got me
[19:14] wide awake for the phone call that was
[19:16] coming next
[19:18] and sister tony
[19:21] cruz called me
[19:23] or asked sent me a text asked me to call
[19:25] her and
[19:26] she hasn't been able to
[19:28] be here with us and brother tim
[19:31] her son is here and he had put in a
[19:32] praise last wednesday about
[19:35] how she was being able to eat some more
[19:37] and her back was feeling better but she
[19:38] called me and she said
[19:41] she was having a lot of trouble standing
[19:43] and not being able to move and she had
[19:46] some tests done and they drew blood and
[19:48] they found cancer in her blood
[19:50] and it has gotten onto her bones now
[19:54] so the doctor said that she shouldn't be
[19:55] walking around because her bones could
[19:57] break and
[19:59] so she shared some things and and all in
[20:03] i just failed to ask her how
[20:05] how are you with god right now that's
[20:07] the most important thing
[20:09] god could hear you make you well
[20:12] but let's let's make sure our hearts are
[20:14] right before the lord so we
[20:16] able to share some things i didn't know
[20:17] she was a retired nurse
[20:20] she lost her husband
[20:22] um
[20:23] or i knew she
[20:25] i believe your father passed away is
[20:26] that right tim
[20:29] or
[20:30] was there separation
[20:34] okay but she said told me she said i did
[20:36] not want to live on welfare
[20:39] so i went back to school and i got my
[20:40] nurses degree at 45 years old
[20:43] i said i'm retired for that she said so
[20:45] i understand the medical portion of it
[20:48] but i said but we've got a god who's the
[20:50] healer
[20:51] and
[20:52] we're able to pray
[20:54] and and two people came on my heart to
[20:56] possibly could go help her
[20:58] sister heather and sister shirley moore
[21:01] and they're the first two people that
[21:02] walked in
[21:04] they came in and i said just the two
[21:05] people that god put him a heart to talk
[21:07] to and they walk in
[21:08] for the possibility of maybe being able
[21:11] to go and be with her
[21:12] god does things
[21:15] he's already got it laid out god had
[21:17] already planned
[21:18] i believe that tony's sister tony loves
[21:20] the lord jesus and i know he loves her
[21:23] and her desire she said i i don't want
[21:26] to go now
[21:28] i have a of my dad and my brother said
[21:30] older i'd like to live to see them
[21:33] and i believe that's a good request
[21:35] something in her heart but
[21:37] she said i'll make sure everything is
[21:39] right
[21:40] and i'll be ready to go if he calls me
[21:42] home and that's the assurance we have so
[21:44] let's keep our sister in prayer
[21:47] also i failed to call brother david
[21:49] zavala there in
[21:51] san diego
[21:52] because tomorrow is the memorial service
[21:54] and then tuesday is a burial for our
[21:56] brother lucero and brother lucero was a
[22:00] um how do i say just an integral part of
[22:02] the church
[22:04] he's such a fine brother and he had just
[22:06] remarried
[22:07] probably in his 70s and had just
[22:09] remarried
[22:11] and he passed away with cobin and
[22:13] brother david told me the church was
[22:14] having a hard time with that because he
[22:15] was such a part it's a small church
[22:18] but i said how are you doing he said
[22:19] well brother newton called me and asked
[22:21] me if it was okay if he came so he came
[22:23] and covered service for us today it's
[22:25] going to help us tomorrow so god already
[22:27] made that provision too
[22:29] so i know that god is mindful
[22:32] sometimes we say lord
[22:34] help thou my unbelief
[22:36] and so let's remember them in prayer and
[22:39] but i'd like to read you something as
[22:41] you know and and i don't know how many
[22:42] of you folks here knew brother tom
[22:44] earnest uh
[22:46] some of you may be to raise your hand
[22:49] um he he attended the tabernacle years
[22:51] ago
[22:52] he worked for brother joe greene and
[22:55] he came administered to us one service
[22:57] right before nina and stephen got
[22:59] married
[23:00] and he got sick with kovid he was
[23:03] associate minister for brother jim
[23:05] but let me read what happened before he
[23:08] passed away
[23:11] um
[23:15] nina sent it to us just to let her know
[23:18] says i wanted to share with you
[23:21] with you guys last night stephen and i
[23:23] went to visit sister sandy and that's
[23:25] brother tom's
[23:27] wife and their family that's brother
[23:28] tom's family that passed that had passed
[23:30] away
[23:31] i was amazed how strong they are in the
[23:33] lord because in a time like this it is
[23:35] only the strength of the lord
[23:38] if the lord gives it it can carry you
[23:41] they really shared testimonies of how
[23:43] the lord was preparing them
[23:45] for his death without them knowing
[23:48] it says so the day before brother tommy
[23:51] passed away i believe jessica which is
[23:53] his oldest daughter just felt to go to
[23:55] the hospital and call the doctors and
[23:57] tell them i am down in the parking lot
[23:59] and just letting you know if you need to
[24:02] have some questions or have some
[24:04] questions for us and you want us to come
[24:06] and talk to you about the decisions
[24:07] about the ventilator and so on we're in
[24:09] the parking lot
[24:11] and stephanie who is the other sister
[24:13] said she felt really strongly that day
[24:15] just to stay near the hospital
[24:17] and she hadn't told any of the family
[24:19] that she had felt strongly so she just
[24:21] kind of stayed near the hospital drove
[24:23] around
[24:23] and she got a call from her sister said
[24:25] they that they felt strongly to go to
[24:27] the hospital if you want to come and
[24:28] hang out with us we might just be in the
[24:30] parking lot so this was the two sisters
[24:33] getting the same
[24:35] so she was like i feel the same i'm
[24:38] around the corner so she went
[24:40] and jessica called and then told her
[24:42] they have to go ahead and to come up
[24:44] which is not what not they're letting
[24:46] not people do but the doctors told him
[24:47] to come on in
[24:49] he says
[24:51] no one is allowed near the patients and
[24:53] so on so they let sister sandy the moms
[24:56] jessica and sephie go up and they asked
[24:59] if josh your brother could go expecting
[25:01] to know but the nurse said yes he can
[25:02] come also
[25:04] he said
[25:05] so they all went in with the intent of
[25:06] answering questions and helping the
[25:08] nurses
[25:09] convince brother tommy to get on the
[25:11] ventilator because that is what the
[25:12] doctors thought would be best
[25:14] anyway when the decisions were made they
[25:16] were able to see for the tommy for a
[25:17] good time and talk with him which a lot
[25:20] of families are not being able to drink
[25:22] and the banana the next day brother
[25:24] tommy passed away
[25:26] now you'll get this impression this
[25:28] feeling i need to go do this
[25:30] and it tell your sister and your mom and
[25:33] all and they were all able to go spend
[25:35] the day before with brother tommy
[25:37] but god is still in charge
[25:40] god is still mindful sometimes he gets
[25:42] hard no question about it
[25:44] but we serve a living god
[25:47] do you have a need you have a request
[25:48] maybe you'd raise your hand and say lord
[25:51] lord i need you right now brother dan
[25:53] evans would you come up and if we'll
[25:55] stand

[43:10] [Music]
[43:12] thank you
[43:14] good evening
[43:15] it's so good to be back
[43:18] back in that leaky trailer with no hot
[43:20] water and a malfunctioning toilet
[43:23] driving back to the desert in a car with
[43:25] no air conditioning because some rodents
[43:27] found the wires to be a little too tasty
[43:30] not so much
[43:32] but back in fellowship with you
[43:34] my brothers and sisters my family in
[43:35] christ
[43:37] that's why it's good to be back as many
[43:40] of you know we left town on july 28th to
[43:43] attend the funeral and help comfort the
[43:45] family of brother allen hopkinson in
[43:47] dallas texas he passed away unexpectedly
[43:50] that morning suddenly but peacefully he
[43:53] was laid to rest on monday morning
[43:55] august the second allen was a world war
[43:57] ii veteran just a few weeks shy of his
[43:59] 97th birthday
[44:02] afterwards heather and i decided
[44:05] we needed a break
[44:06] so we headed out to colorado planned to
[44:09] do some national parks and just get away
[44:12] but who's in charge
[44:15] us as we try to plan and exercise
[44:17] control over our lives
[44:19] or our lord
[44:21] who's slaves we are
[44:23] you know the answer
[44:25] thus we find ourselves back in tucson in
[44:27] august and not cooling off in some
[44:29] national park
[44:31] because in the end
[44:32] we are his
[44:34] we must yield to his control
[44:37] we can do it the easy way
[44:39] or the not-so-easy way but if we're his
[44:42] we must do it
[44:43] let's join our hearts together in prayer
[44:45] one more time lord jesus
[44:48] we're so grateful for this opportunity
[44:50] that we can be together that we can
[44:51] gather around your word that we can
[44:53] worship you lord in spirit and in truth
[44:56] accept our worship except our praise
[44:58] because in the end it's all about you
[45:00] lord
[45:01] lord jesus i pray that you'd help me to
[45:03] step out of the way forgive me where
[45:04] i've fallen short attitudes words
[45:07] actions thoughts
[45:09] lord
[45:11] that your people
[45:12] are here tonight lord desiring to hear
[45:15] from you to draw from you
[45:17] to receive from you and lord i just pray
[45:20] that you'd help me to be a channel for
[45:22] your honor and for your glory this
[45:24] evening we commit the remainder of this
[45:26] service into your hands and we thank you
[45:28] in jesus precious name
[45:32] see if i can remember how to use this
[45:37] our opening verses for this evening are
[45:39] found in ephesians the second chapter
[45:43] ephesians 2 verses 8 and 9.
[45:46] for by grace are you saved
[45:50] through faith
[45:51] that not of yourselves
[45:53] it's a gift of god
[45:56] not of works you can't earn it
[45:58] lest any man should boast
[46:01] please be seated
[46:03] i was going to use these verses for a
[46:05] very different sermon
[46:07] but who's in charge
[46:10] tonight
[46:11] let's go on a brief journey
[46:13] to israel
[46:14] and to egypt
[46:16] the purpose of the journey
[46:18] to see the hand of the lord expressing
[46:20] his grace and his love
[46:22] to realize that he's at work in the
[46:24] background when he seems invisible
[46:27] and silent when it seems that he's not
[46:29] answering your prayer that it seems like
[46:31] you're not getting through and in spite
[46:34] of appearances to the contrary
[46:36] he really is in charge
[46:39] no matter what struggles you or i might
[46:41] be enduring how well we've convinced
[46:43] ourselves that we've stepped over the
[46:45] line from which there is no return
[46:47] his grace is sufficient
[46:50] not sure
[46:51] i'm going to give you a test i'm going
[46:53] to give you a word test it's an easy one
[46:55] it's a true or false
[46:58] if we confess our sins
[47:00] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[47:03] our sins and to cleanse us
[47:06] from all unrighteousness
[47:08] true or false
[47:11] in fact not only can he cleanse us from
[47:13] all unrighteousness he can even cleanse
[47:15] us from self-righteousness
[47:18] as brother peter spoke about last sunday
[47:20] evening if we're under the covering of
[47:21] the blood of jesus christ god doesn't
[47:23] see us
[47:24] our sin
[47:26] our unrighteousness
[47:27] we're identified with our sacrifice
[47:29] which is jesus if we accept him as our
[47:32] savior
[47:34] and as our lord
[47:35] and that's the only
[47:37] is acceptable to god
[47:39] he inhabited human flesh he inhabited
[47:42] human flesh
[47:44] to offer himself for us
[47:47] so he could restore the fellowship lost
[47:50] in eden
[47:51] as we just read in ephesians it's by
[47:53] grace unmerited favor undeserving
[47:57] through faith
[47:58] which itself is a gift
[48:01] nothing we can do you can't work it up
[48:03] there's no earning it
[48:05] i think one of the books of the bible
[48:07] that is all about grace and goes into
[48:09] great length
[48:11] demonstrating god's grace and mercy
[48:14] is my favorite old testament book
[48:17] genesis
[48:19] much of genesis is about the family of
[48:21] abraham's grandson jacob
[48:26] it's actually visible now i almost need
[48:28] sunglasses here here's a chart showing
[48:31] the children of jacob
[48:33] and who birthed each one
[48:35] jacob had two wives leia
[48:38] and rachel
[48:40] he also lived with two other women
[48:42] zilpah and bilhah
[48:45] which were slaves of his wives it's
[48:47] important to understand
[48:48] that leia was his first wife
[48:51] she was given to him by a deception of
[48:54] her father
[48:56] a week later he was given rachel as the
[48:58] second wife
[48:59] and the woman he thought he was marrying
[49:00] all along
[49:02] initially
[49:04] rachel couldn't have children so she
[49:06] encouraged jacob to have children by her
[49:07] slave
[49:09] bilhah
[49:10] thus bill haas closely associated with
[49:13] rachel
[49:15] leia followed the same path if she can
[49:16] do it i can do it and encourage jacob to
[49:19] have children by her slave zilpah
[49:22] leia and bilhah
[49:24] play significant roles in our message
[49:26] this evening
[49:28] the final 14 of the 50 chapters of
[49:30] genesis center around joseph
[49:33] jacob's 11th son
[49:36] and the
[49:37] elder of
[49:38] the two children by his favorite wife
[49:40] rachel the other child being benjamin
[49:43] in fact joseph's name appears some 157
[49:47] times in 138 different verses in the
[49:50] book of genesis
[49:52] judah's name is next it only appears 28
[49:55] times in 26 verses yet the messiah
[49:58] is the lion of the tribe the line of
[50:01] judah
[50:03] not joseph
[50:05] benjamin the 12th son appears 17 times
[50:08] in 16 verses and then
[50:10] we come to reuben he's the firstborn
[50:13] thus the holder of the birthright or the
[50:15] right of the firstborn
[50:17] he's the son of leia
[50:20] his name occurs the fourth most often
[50:21] but it's only 13 times
[50:23] in 13 verses tonight
[50:26] let's focus a bit on reuben
[50:29] and the crucial role that he plays in
[50:31] this story now brother branham mentions
[50:33] reuben 50 times in the messages we have
[50:36] almost always it's in conjunction with
[50:38] either 144 000 being saved at the end
[50:41] time
[50:42] or illustrating jesus as being the alpha
[50:44] and omega beginning and end reuben and
[50:47] benjamin jasper and sardis donate the
[50:49] priestly breastplate
[50:52] when we think of birthright
[50:55] and jacob's involved we think of
[50:57] jacob and esau
[50:59] jacob was able to get esau to upsell him
[51:01] his birthright for a bowl of stew
[51:04] apparently isaac was powerless to
[51:06] restore it
[51:07] rebecca later connived with jacob to
[51:09] trick isaac into giving jacob the
[51:11] blessing intended on
[51:13] and to giving jacob with the blessing
[51:15] intended for esau
[51:16] again
[51:18] isaac was unable to reverse it yet we
[51:20] also see that jacob was able to take the
[51:23] birthright from reuben and give it to
[51:25] joseph
[51:26] skipping over nine of his brothers who
[51:28] by birth order were more entitled to it
[51:30] than joseph
[51:32] it's a very curious thing
[51:34] so i wanted to cut down reuben and ask
[51:36] him reuben
[51:37] hey what's up with all this
[51:40] i couldn't
[51:41] and of course neither can you but what
[51:43] we can do is we can turn to the bible
[51:45] and see what it tells us
[51:47] and we often need to read between the
[51:49] lines to get the bigger picture
[51:51] referring to what we call the old
[51:53] testament paul tells us in ii timothy
[51:56] all scripture
[51:57] is given by inspiration of god as
[51:59] profitable for doctrine reproof
[52:01] correction
[52:02] instruction and righteousness
[52:05] that the man of god may be perfect
[52:08] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[52:11] tonight i'd like to focus on forgiveness
[52:15] rescue
[52:16] and god's timing and something else too
[52:20] some of the story contains what we often
[52:22] call these days adult material but i'll
[52:25] tone it down for the sake of the
[52:26] children among us
[52:28] we can identify at some level with the
[52:30] family of jacob in their
[52:32] monumental struggles
[52:34] because we all struggle
[52:36] we're all at war with our flesh with our
[52:38] nature
[52:40] which we're told is an enmity actively
[52:42] working against god
[52:44] none of us think ourselves worthy of
[52:46] god's love or grace and we aren't
[52:49] but he's bigger than we are
[52:51] and his love transcends our frailty
[52:55] after all he made us the way he made us
[52:59] to serve his purposes
[53:02] paul's very first writings tell us the
[53:04] book of galatians be not deceived god's
[53:07] not mocked whatsoever man soweth that
[53:10] shall he also reap
[53:11] he that soweth to his flesh
[53:14] of the flesh reap corruption he that so
[53:16] should the spiritual of the spirit reap
[53:19] life everlasting
[53:21] so make no mistake
[53:23] we pay for our self will our fleshly
[53:25] indulgences our disobedience
[53:28] but we pay a price that's intended to
[53:31] correct and guide and teach us not a
[53:34] price of revenge or cruelty god gets no
[53:37] joy in punishing or destroying us
[53:40] he's not a sadist he's our father
[53:43] he gets joy watching us grow and mature
[53:46] moving from milk to meat
[53:49] from being taught
[53:50] to teaching
[53:51] from being helped
[53:53] to helping
[53:54] moving from the classroom to the field
[53:56] from the academy to the battle
[53:59] moving from defeat
[54:00] to victory
[54:02] from hesitation
[54:03] to confidence
[54:05] i've titled tonight's lesson
[54:08] reuben to the rescue
[54:12] you can actually see it
[54:14] we're going to be jumping back and forth
[54:16] in time perhaps a total of 40 years
[54:19] and places
[54:21] canaan
[54:23] and egypt
[54:25] this map will help plant those locations
[54:27] in your mind we we see canaan is
[54:29] separated from egypt by the sinai desert
[54:34] dothan a small town in canaan in the
[54:36] upper right is marked with the bold
[54:38] green arrow this is where joseph
[54:41] is sold to an ishmaelite spice cavern
[54:44] bound for egypt
[54:46] memphis an early capital city of egypt
[54:49] is marked with a blue arrow there this
[54:51] is near where joseph was sold into
[54:53] slavery and the area of egypt from which
[54:56] he eventually ruled
[54:57] it's where his brothers will come to buy
[54:59] grain from him during the famine
[55:02] now the distance between these two
[55:03] locations is about 300 miles that's
[55:06] about the distance from tucson to el
[55:08] paso or tucson to kingman
[55:11] goshen
[55:13] where jacob's family will eventually
[55:15] settle and be enslaved is marked with a
[55:18] purple arrow it's north of memphis in
[55:19] the nile delta region
[55:21] even today this is very fertile and
[55:23] productive farmland
[55:26] well where to start
[55:28] let's go to the last words of jacob his
[55:30] dying words to his son
[55:33] this speech
[55:34] takes place
[55:35] in goshen
[55:37] genesis 49
[55:39] reuben
[55:41] he's 137 years old so he has a little
[55:44] trouble
[55:45] projecting his voice here reuben thou
[55:47] art my firstborn
[55:49] my might
[55:50] the beginning of my strength i'm sure
[55:52] he's looking at reuben
[55:54] right in the eyes as he's saying this
[55:56] the excellency of dignity and the
[55:58] excellency of power
[56:01] but unstable as water
[56:03] thou shalt not excel because thou
[56:05] wentest up to thy father's bed
[56:08] then thou defiled us did
[56:11] he went up to my couch
[56:14] jacob reminds reuben
[56:16] of a grievous sin
[56:18] that he had committed against his father
[56:20] it cost him his birthright that
[56:22] birthright was apparently never restored
[56:24] to him it seems jacob never forgave
[56:26] reuben
[56:28] brother branham said that unstable as
[56:30] water indicated reuben was weak
[56:32] unstable other translations used the
[56:34] word turbulent
[56:36] also suggests he was passionate
[56:38] acting without thinking things through
[56:42] one tradition and it may be just that a
[56:44] tradition
[56:45] asserts that after rachel's death jacob
[56:47] promoted bilhah to be the one who slept
[56:50] in his tent
[56:51] it's certainly consistent with what
[56:53] jacob is saying here
[56:55] if we go back further back when they
[56:57] were in bananaran
[56:59] we recall from genesis 30 that is a
[57:01] little boy
[57:02] reuben found some mandrake in a field
[57:04] and brought it mommy look what i found
[57:07] gave it to leia
[57:10] rachel wanted it give me that
[57:13] leia swapped the mandrake for a night
[57:15] with her own husband
[57:18] it seems clear that jacob and rachel
[57:20] were together while leia was treated
[57:22] like bilhah and zilpah a concubine a
[57:25] slave not as his wife
[57:28] she was used
[57:29] and unloved
[57:31] the tradition further states that jacob
[57:33] promoted bilhah rachel's handmaid to his
[57:36] tent after rachel's death while giving
[57:38] birth to benjamin remember the violation
[57:42] occurred on jacob's bed
[57:45] perhaps bilhah reminded him of rachel
[57:47] regardless this arrangement would have
[57:49] been an utter humiliation to
[57:52] leia reuben's act and violating bilhah
[57:55] resulted in jacob dismissing her jacob
[57:57] would then move leia to his tent
[58:02] this is tradition but reuben it seems by
[58:06] this foolish and sinful act
[58:08] not only rescued his mother leia
[58:11] from shame and degradation at the hand
[58:14] of jacob
[58:15] but ultimately rescued jacob from his
[58:18] attitude toward leia in contrast with
[58:21] rachel as we'll see in a moment
[58:24] did this event define reuben
[58:27] does it illustrate his character
[58:30] was he just an immoral person taking
[58:32] advantage of his deceased stepmother's
[58:34] slave an angry young man reacting to his
[58:37] mother's humiliation
[58:39] whether this was planned by reuben or
[58:42] conspiracy involving lay in reuben or
[58:44] just an impulsive and thoughtless act
[58:46] we don't know
[58:49] jacob tells us reuben is impetuous
[58:51] unstable turbulent unruly
[58:54] what we do know
[58:56] is that eventually
[58:58] jacob came to love leia
[59:00] his dying words and his final wish are
[59:03] recorded for us
[59:06] and
[59:07] jacob charged his sons and said unto
[59:10] them i am to be gathered unto my people
[59:13] bury me with my fathers in the cave that
[59:17] is in the field to ephron the hittite
[59:20] in the cave that is in the field of mach
[59:22] pella which is before mom ray and the
[59:25] land of canaan which abraham bought with
[59:27] the field of ephron they hit type 4 a
[59:29] possession of a burying place
[59:32] there
[59:33] they buried abraham and sarah his wife
[59:37] there they buried isaac
[59:39] and rebecca his wife
[59:41] and there
[59:43] i
[59:44] buried leia
[59:47] what a change in heart
[59:49] he buried leia his previously unloved
[59:52] wife
[59:53] in the most hallowed and honored place
[59:55] he put her body in the family tomb with
[59:57] abraham and sarah
[59:59] with his parents isaac and rebecca he
[1:00:02] didn't move rachel's bones to that tomb
[1:00:04] she was laid to rest near bethlehem
[1:00:06] and jacob
[1:00:08] wanted to be buried
[1:00:10] next to leia
[1:00:14] what about reuben
[1:00:17] what happens to him after this sordid
[1:00:19] episode
[1:00:20] dan and naphtali must have really hated
[1:00:22] him
[1:00:23] he raped their mother see this
[1:00:25] relationship circled and read on the
[1:00:27] screen we just read that jacob didn't
[1:00:30] forgive reuben
[1:00:32] but what punishment
[1:00:34] might have been exacted on reuben
[1:00:38] when their sister dinah was defiled
[1:00:40] simeon and levi murdered all the men of
[1:00:43] the entire town
[1:00:47] when his daughter-in-law tamar was found
[1:00:49] to be pregnant long after the death of
[1:00:51] her husband judah was about to burn her
[1:00:54] alive
[1:00:56] reuben's life might well have been taken
[1:01:00] for his act
[1:01:02] ruben's brothers are not gentle people
[1:01:04] they're passionate angry sometimes
[1:01:06] violent men
[1:01:07] they're part of an extremely
[1:01:09] dysfunctional family
[1:01:11] yet
[1:01:12] they're the patriarchs the part of the
[1:01:15] chosen
[1:01:16] are we part of his chosen
[1:01:20] what does that mean
[1:01:22] paul puts us in our place first
[1:01:23] corinthians 1. god hath chosen the
[1:01:26] foolish things of the world god has
[1:01:28] chosen
[1:01:29] the foolish things of the world to
[1:01:31] confound the wise god hath chosen the
[1:01:34] weak things of the world to confound the
[1:01:37] things which are mighty and base things
[1:01:39] of the world and things which are
[1:01:41] despised hath god chosen
[1:01:44] yea and things which are not to bring to
[1:01:46] naught things that are
[1:01:49] why
[1:01:50] that no flesh should glory in his
[1:01:53] presence
[1:01:54] in other words the chosen or not picked
[1:01:56] because they're exceptional
[1:01:58] were quite ordinary and quite often
[1:02:00] looked down upon
[1:02:02] so much for bride pride
[1:02:04] back to reuben we see the consequences
[1:02:07] of his act could have cost him his life
[1:02:11] two of his brothers would hate him for
[1:02:13] violating their mother another two of
[1:02:15] his brothers are cruel
[1:02:17] violent men as we'll soon see
[1:02:19] regardless of reuben's motives jacob
[1:02:22] stripped him of his authority and rights
[1:02:24] as the firstborn
[1:02:26] and transferred them
[1:02:28] not to simeon
[1:02:29] the second born the one who would have
[1:02:31] normally received it
[1:02:32] consider the example of isaac as the
[1:02:34] second border of jacob himself
[1:02:37] but to joseph
[1:02:39] joseph
[1:02:40] the 11th born
[1:02:43] back to canaan 40 years before jacob's
[1:02:46] death joseph is 17.
[1:02:48] we're told now israel that's jacob's
[1:02:50] other name loved joseph more than all
[1:02:53] his children because he was a son of his
[1:02:55] old age jacob was 90 or 91 when joseph
[1:02:58] was born he's about 107
[1:03:01] at this point
[1:03:03] benjamin was much younger so son here
[1:03:05] implies more than biological
[1:03:06] relationship think of adoption
[1:03:13] well
[1:03:19] let me turn this off
[1:03:22] and turn this on
[1:03:25] okay
[1:03:26] so
[1:03:27] he made a coat
[1:03:29] he made him a coat of many colors can
[1:03:31] you hear me okay with this mike
[1:03:33] okay i don't know if that's good or if
[1:03:35] that's too bad but there you go
[1:03:38] and when his brethren saw or understood
[1:03:40] or realized that their father loved him
[1:03:42] more than all his brethren
[1:03:44] they hated him
[1:03:46] and could not speak peacefully to him
[1:03:48] they could not give him shalom
[1:03:52] this garment
[1:03:53] signified authority
[1:03:56] we have to be careful how we read when
[1:03:58] it says his brethren
[1:04:00] because if it means all of his brothers
[1:04:03] it has to include benjamin and
[1:04:04] benjamin's a toddler at this point it's
[1:04:06] unlikely that he hated his big brother
[1:04:08] joseph
[1:04:10] as we'll see it's also unlikely that
[1:04:13] reuben hated him even though he may have
[1:04:15] had the most reason because of the code
[1:04:17] of authority and the birthright
[1:04:20] so his brethren means some many most but
[1:04:23] not necessarily all
[1:04:27] keeping in mind the title of tonight's
[1:04:28] message
[1:04:29] reuben to the rescue
[1:04:32] let's look next
[1:04:33] at joseph's dreams and the next verse
[1:04:35] dream number one
[1:04:37] joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to
[1:04:40] his brothers
[1:04:42] and they hated him
[1:04:44] yet the more he said unto them
[1:04:47] listen up guys
[1:04:49] listen about this dream i dreamed
[1:04:52] behold we were binding sheaves in the
[1:04:56] field and lo
[1:04:58] my sheave arose above yours and and and
[1:05:02] it stood upright and behold your sheaves
[1:05:06] stood around mine and
[1:05:08] and made obeisance to my sheaf
[1:05:13] his brethren said to him
[1:05:15] shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt
[1:05:18] thou indeed have dominion over us
[1:05:21] they hated him yet the more for his
[1:05:23] dreams
[1:05:25] and for his words
[1:05:28] now we have this 17 year old boy
[1:05:30] who's just been given serious
[1:05:32] recognition by his dad at the expense of
[1:05:34] his siblings
[1:05:37] there's no indication he should have
[1:05:38] shared the dream but he does
[1:05:41] there's no indication the dream is from
[1:05:42] god he says
[1:05:44] i dreamed a dream
[1:05:47] note that jacob who must have heard
[1:05:48] about it
[1:05:50] doesn't record it as objecting to this
[1:05:52] dream
[1:05:53] maybe he thought it
[1:05:55] lent a little bit of authority or or
[1:05:57] recognition or justification to his
[1:05:59] elevation of joseph
[1:06:02] we notice the dream is about them bowing
[1:06:04] down making obeisance to him the recent
[1:06:06] recipient of that code of authority
[1:06:10] does it seem a little odd
[1:06:12] that the dream is about wheat and these
[1:06:14] guys are shepherds not farmers
[1:06:17] it seems joseph attitude when he shares
[1:06:19] it may have been prideful or
[1:06:21] condescending because we're told they
[1:06:23] hate him
[1:06:24] not only for the dream
[1:06:27] but for his words
[1:06:29] those that hate him hate him more
[1:06:32] joseph has a few lessons to learn let's
[1:06:35] continue on to dream number two in the
[1:06:37] next verse
[1:06:38] and he dreamed yet another dream
[1:06:41] and told that his brethren i'm sorry i
[1:06:42] tend to wander back and forth here
[1:06:45] and said behold
[1:06:47] i dreamed another dream
[1:06:49] behold the sun and moon
[1:06:52] and eleven stars made obedience to me
[1:06:56] and he told it to his father and to his
[1:06:59] brethren and his father jacob rebuked
[1:07:01] him and said
[1:07:02] what is this dream thou hast dreamed
[1:07:05] shall i and thy mother and thy brethren
[1:07:08] indeed come down to bow ourselves to
[1:07:10] thee to the earth
[1:07:13] his brothers envied him but his father
[1:07:16] observed the saying niv says kept the
[1:07:18] matter in mind the nlt said wondered
[1:07:21] what the dreams meant
[1:07:24] he dreams and again seems compelled to
[1:07:26] share it it's similar only in that
[1:07:28] joseph is exalted and those
[1:07:31] around him must bow down
[1:07:33] no wheat no setting this time but in
[1:07:36] this dream rather than a vague
[1:07:37] observation that his brother's wheat
[1:07:39] cheese bowed down to his we have the
[1:07:41] detail that all 11 brothers
[1:07:44] are included
[1:07:45] this time it includes his father and
[1:07:47] mother which was to must have met one of
[1:07:49] his stepmothers because his mom had
[1:07:52] passed away
[1:07:55] i think reuben was comforted by this
[1:07:57] dream
[1:07:59] what
[1:08:00] how can that be brother lyle
[1:08:03] remember reuben sinned against his
[1:08:05] father and his stepmom
[1:08:06] he could have been killed who knows in
[1:08:09] the next chapter of genesis judah is
[1:08:11] about to burn tomorrow live for a
[1:08:12] similar sin
[1:08:14] but in this dream it says that all 11 of
[1:08:17] his brothers are included
[1:08:19] for reuben that means his life is spared
[1:08:22] regarding this sin he's not going to be
[1:08:24] killed or or excommunicated or shunned
[1:08:27] or driven away or made an outcast
[1:08:29] because if that were the case he
[1:08:31] couldn't participate with his brothers
[1:08:32] in this
[1:08:34] so genesis is all about this and what is
[1:08:38] this
[1:08:38] grace
[1:08:40] and marriage and favor
[1:08:42] and notice something else here
[1:08:47] hatred has been overshadowed by what
[1:08:51] envy
[1:08:53] envy
[1:08:55] why would they suddenly envy
[1:08:58] the one they hated
[1:09:01] let's jump forward 22 years and move 300
[1:09:05] miles from jacob's tent to pharaoh's
[1:09:07] palace
[1:09:08] senior threat too the pharaoh has had a
[1:09:10] pair of dreams he's disturbed by them
[1:09:13] the court dream interpreters can't tell
[1:09:14] them what it means you may recall we
[1:09:16] went into this in some detail last year
[1:09:18] genesis 41 25 joseph said unto pharaoh
[1:09:22] the dream of pharaoh is one
[1:09:24] god has shown pharaoh what he is about
[1:09:25] to do the the seven good cows are seven
[1:09:28] years and the seven good years or seven
[1:09:30] years the dream is won
[1:09:33] the seven thin and ill-favored cows that
[1:09:35] came up after them are seven years and
[1:09:37] the seven empty ears blasted with the
[1:09:39] east wind shall be seven years of famine
[1:09:42] this is the thing which i have spoken
[1:09:44] unto pharaoh what god is about to do he
[1:09:46] shows to pharaoh behold there come seven
[1:09:49] years of great plenty throughout all the
[1:09:50] land of egypt and there shall arise
[1:09:53] after them seven years of famine and all
[1:09:55] the plenty shall be forgotten in the
[1:09:57] land of egypt and the famine shall
[1:09:59] consume the land and to plenty shall not
[1:10:01] be known by the land by reason of that
[1:10:03] famine following for it shall be very
[1:10:06] grievous
[1:10:08] well what do we have here
[1:10:10] that's like joseph's dreams
[1:10:15] the subject plenty followed by famine
[1:10:19] no
[1:10:20] what is parallel is that joseph had two
[1:10:23] different dreams about the same topic
[1:10:26] his family bowing down to him and
[1:10:28] pharaoh had two different dreams about
[1:10:30] the same topic
[1:10:32] so years of plenty followed by years of
[1:10:34] famine
[1:10:36] well so what
[1:10:37] why is that significant why would that
[1:10:39] make the brothers jealous
[1:10:42] envious of joseph
[1:10:45] well let's listen because in the next
[1:10:47] verse joseph explains why to pharaoh
[1:10:51] and for that the dream was doubled unto
[1:10:53] pharaoh twice it is because the thing is
[1:10:55] established by god and god will shortly
[1:10:58] bring it to pass
[1:11:00] so in canaan in joseph's time at least
[1:11:02] within his family a dream repeated was
[1:11:05] accepted to mean that a
[1:11:07] it's from god and be it will soon be
[1:11:11] fulfilled
[1:11:14] so the brothers are envious because not
[1:11:16] only do they hate joseph but they now
[1:11:19] believe that this is really going to
[1:11:21] happen
[1:11:22] they're going to have to bow down to him
[1:11:24] they'd rather that he bowed down to them
[1:11:27] they're envious back to jacob and the
[1:11:29] family back in canaan 22 years earlier
[1:11:35] this is this is back to genesis 37.
[1:11:40] so joseph's brethren went to feed their
[1:11:42] father's flock remember their shepherds
[1:11:44] not wheat farmers and sheckle
[1:11:47] and
[1:11:48] israel jacob said unto joseph do not thy
[1:11:52] brethren feed the flock and sheck them
[1:11:55] come i will send the unto them and
[1:11:57] joseph said to them said to him here am
[1:12:00] i
[1:12:01] and and jacob said to joseph go i pray
[1:12:04] thee see whether it be well with thy
[1:12:06] brethren and well with the flocks and
[1:12:09] bring me word again
[1:12:11] so jacob sent them out of the valley of
[1:12:13] hebron and joseph came to shechem
[1:12:17] why would jacob be worried about them
[1:12:20] they're
[1:12:20] pretty strong able-bodied young men
[1:12:23] is it just his nature
[1:12:25] or did he have a reason
[1:12:28] we read in genesis 34
[1:12:31] some months to know more than a couple
[1:12:33] of years earlier that jacob's daughter
[1:12:35] dinah went to visit the young women in
[1:12:37] the town of shechem
[1:12:39] this was near jacob's camp at that time
[1:12:42] shechem the son of hamor who ruled the
[1:12:44] town
[1:12:45] also the name of the town can be a
[1:12:47] little confusing here
[1:12:49] defiled dinah
[1:12:50] hamor tried to make amends and we read
[1:12:52] in genesis 34 the sons of jacob answered
[1:12:56] shechem and hemorrha's father
[1:12:58] deceitfully
[1:12:59] and said because he had defiled dana
[1:13:02] their sister they said unto him we
[1:13:05] cannot do this thing to give our sister
[1:13:07] to one that is uncircumcised for that
[1:13:09] were a reproach unto us
[1:13:12] but in this will we consent unto you if
[1:13:15] you will be as we be that every male of
[1:13:17] you be circumcised
[1:13:21] they're going to use
[1:13:23] a sign that god gave abraham
[1:13:26] as a weapon
[1:13:29] we aren't told which of jacob's sons
[1:13:30] said this but they had a great teacher
[1:13:32] and their father on the subject of
[1:13:34] deception
[1:13:35] the men of the town agree
[1:13:40] and it came to pass on the third day
[1:13:42] when they were sore that two of the sons
[1:13:45] of jacob simeon and levi dinah's
[1:13:48] brethren all three are children of leia
[1:13:51] each man took his sword and came upon
[1:13:52] the city boldly
[1:13:54] and slew killed all the men
[1:13:58] and they slew hamor and shechem his son
[1:14:00] with the edge of the sword and took
[1:14:02] dinah out of shechem's house and went
[1:14:04] out
[1:14:05] the sons of jacob came upon the slain
[1:14:07] and spoiled the city because they had
[1:14:09] defiled their sister
[1:14:11] they took their sheep their oxen their
[1:14:13] asses that which was in the city and
[1:14:14] that which was in the field
[1:14:16] and all their wealth and all their
[1:14:17] little ones and their wives took they
[1:14:19] captive and spoiled even all that was in
[1:14:21] the house
[1:14:24] jacob has a reason to worry
[1:14:26] what reuben did pales in comparison to
[1:14:29] what simeon levi and others of sons have
[1:14:31] done
[1:14:32] so he sends joseph wearing that code of
[1:14:34] authority
[1:14:35] to find out if they're okay
[1:14:38] young
[1:14:39] 17 year old
[1:14:41] hated by his brothers
[1:14:43] that joseph
[1:14:45] turns out the brothers had moved on from
[1:14:47] shechem to dothan a stranger at shechem
[1:14:50] informed joseph of this and joseph found
[1:14:52] him there
[1:14:53] and when they saw joseph afar off even
[1:14:56] before he came near unto them they
[1:14:58] conspired against joseph to slay him
[1:15:02] they said one to another
[1:15:04] behold this dreamer's coming
[1:15:08] come now and therefore let's kill him
[1:15:11] cast him into some pit and we'll say
[1:15:13] some evil beast has devoured him we'll
[1:15:15] see what will become of his dreams
[1:15:18] and now
[1:15:19] we have reuben coming to the rescue
[1:15:22] reuben heard of it and he delivered him
[1:15:25] joseph out of their hands and said
[1:15:27] let us not kill joseph
[1:15:30] reuben said to them shed no blood but
[1:15:33] cast him into this pit
[1:15:35] so the wilderness lay no hand upon him
[1:15:38] he said that reuben might rid joseph out
[1:15:41] of their hands and deliver joseph to
[1:15:43] jacob again
[1:15:45] the brothers are plotting here
[1:15:47] reuben persuades them not to kill joseph
[1:15:49] outright but to cast him into an empty
[1:15:52] cistern
[1:15:53] a stone pit
[1:15:55] he plans to rescue joseph from the pit
[1:15:57] and return him to jacob
[1:15:59] reuben to the rescue but he then steps
[1:16:01] out of the story for a
[1:16:03] short time
[1:16:05] and it came to pass
[1:16:08] when joseph was come unto his brethren
[1:16:10] that they stripped joseph out of his
[1:16:12] coat
[1:16:13] his coat of many colors that was on him
[1:16:15] and they took him and cast him into a
[1:16:18] pit
[1:16:19] and the pit was empty there was no water
[1:16:22] in it
[1:16:23] so part one of reuben's attempted rescue
[1:16:26] has succeeded
[1:16:28] joseph isn't killed
[1:16:30] he's imprisoned
[1:16:32] the terms used here imply violence they
[1:16:34] weren't gentle with joseph oh joe take
[1:16:36] off your coat or let me hang it up for
[1:16:38] you please step down into this uh pit
[1:16:40] here uh
[1:16:41] yeah it's a little hot it's a little dry
[1:16:43] but you know
[1:16:45] everything's okay no
[1:16:46] no they weren't gentle
[1:16:48] later in the story in egypt there's a
[1:16:50] flashback
[1:16:52] that tells us that it was in fact
[1:16:53] violent well let's flash forward to that
[1:16:55] conversation in egypt
[1:16:58] genesis 42 and joseph's brothers said
[1:17:01] one to another we are verily guilty
[1:17:04] concerning joseph and that we saw the
[1:17:07] anguish
[1:17:08] of his soul
[1:17:09] when he besought us he begged us
[1:17:12] we would not hear
[1:17:14] therefore is this distress come upon us
[1:17:17] it it seems likely that joseph was in
[1:17:21] that cistern for three days but first as
[1:17:24] a type of christ we're told that joseph
[1:17:26] was a perfect type of christ he was
[1:17:27] crucified buried in a stone tomb and
[1:17:30] rose on the third day
[1:17:32] and second because joseph later throws
[1:17:35] his brothers
[1:17:36] into a pit a prison in egypt for three
[1:17:38] days
[1:17:40] if we move back a few verses still in
[1:17:41] chapter 42 we see that joseph recognizes
[1:17:44] his brothers
[1:17:46] recalls the dreams he had when he was 17
[1:17:49] and contemplates what he will do with
[1:17:52] or to them
[1:17:55] joseph said unto them
[1:17:58] that is that i spake unto you saying
[1:18:00] your spies
[1:18:02] hereby ye shall be proved by the life of
[1:18:04] pharaoh you shall not go forth from here
[1:18:07] except your youngest brother come here
[1:18:10] send one of you let him fetch your
[1:18:12] brother you'll be kept in prison that
[1:18:14] your words may be proved whether there
[1:18:16] be any truth in you or else by the life
[1:18:19] of pharaoh surely you are spies
[1:18:22] and he put them all together into ward
[1:18:25] for three days this is a very dangerous
[1:18:27] place
[1:18:28] not only for the brothers who are now in
[1:18:30] fear for their lives
[1:18:32] what's the penalty for being a spy even
[1:18:34] today
[1:18:35] death
[1:18:37] but for joseph
[1:18:39] joseph seems here to be bent on a path
[1:18:41] of revenge
[1:18:43] he swears not one but two oaths by the
[1:18:45] only one greater in egypt than himself
[1:18:48] pharaoh
[1:18:49] he puts him in the dungeon
[1:18:52] he's contrived an accusation of spying
[1:18:54] to put them in mortal fear
[1:18:57] we usually think of joseph as a larger
[1:19:00] than life nearly perfect person perfect
[1:19:02] type of christ comes to mind jesus never
[1:19:05] sought revenge so we assume joseph never
[1:19:07] did either
[1:19:08] but joseph is capable of such thoughts
[1:19:11] and actions he's as human as we are
[1:19:14] he'd been wounded deeply he'd suffered
[1:19:17] for many years as a result of his
[1:19:19] brother's hatred and envy
[1:19:21] and after some 22 years he now has a
[1:19:24] chance to pay them back
[1:19:26] and he's taking the first steps of doing
[1:19:28] just that we'll return to this scene a
[1:19:29] little bit later but back to genesis 37
[1:19:32] when
[1:19:33] and kanan and joseph is 17
[1:19:37] we see the brothers
[1:19:39] are so very callous
[1:19:42] joseph is in a pit
[1:19:44] fearing for his life beaten bruised
[1:19:46] hungry but no food hot and thirsty but
[1:19:50] no water we're told the cistern is both
[1:19:52] empty and without water
[1:19:55] it has to be hot because the sister will
[1:19:58] only be in that case in the very late
[1:20:00] part of summer maybe september or so
[1:20:03] meanwhile
[1:20:04] his brothers his tormentors
[1:20:07] they sat down to eat bread
[1:20:10] they lifted up their eyes and looked and
[1:20:12] behold
[1:20:13] a company of ishmaelites
[1:20:16] came from gilead with their camels
[1:20:19] bearing spices and bomb and myrrh going
[1:20:21] to carry it down to egypt
[1:20:23] and judah
[1:20:24] said to his brethren
[1:20:26] come now therefore
[1:20:30] sorry what prophet is it if we slay our
[1:20:34] brother
[1:20:35] and conceal his blood come let's sell
[1:20:38] him to the ishmaelites
[1:20:40] let not our hand be upon him he is our
[1:20:42] brother in our flesh
[1:20:44] and his brethren were content
[1:20:47] and they're passed by midianites
[1:20:49] merchantments these are ishmaelites from
[1:20:51] midian
[1:20:53] and the brothers drew and lifted up
[1:20:55] joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to
[1:20:57] the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver
[1:21:00] and they
[1:21:02] brought joseph to egypt
[1:21:05] in spite of reuben's previous effort the
[1:21:07] brothers are still contemplating killing
[1:21:09] joseph then they see ishmaelites people
[1:21:12] who hate them and especially hate their
[1:21:15] grandfather isaac
[1:21:17] as having dispossessed ishmael coming
[1:21:21] the brothers decide to make joseph
[1:21:23] really suffer
[1:21:24] by selling him to their enemies who will
[1:21:26] then sell them into egypt
[1:21:29] sweet revenge for the ishmaelites
[1:21:32] a fate worse than death for joseph
[1:21:35] and they don't have to kill him
[1:21:38] there's another whole sermon in the
[1:21:40] ishmaelite midianites but that's not for
[1:21:42] tonight
[1:21:43] keep in mind that joseph didn't know of
[1:21:46] their plotting
[1:21:48] judah's influence to sell him into
[1:21:49] slavery or reuben's intervention that
[1:21:51] spared his life
[1:21:53] he only knew he was violently attacked
[1:21:55] by his brothers beaten up put into an
[1:21:57] empty cistern with no food or water
[1:22:00] after some time he's taken out of this
[1:22:02] pit and sold into slavery
[1:22:05] traveling with a band of spice not slave
[1:22:08] traders who really really hate his
[1:22:10] family
[1:22:12] really
[1:22:13] he's got a 300 mile trek to go through
[1:22:16] the desert
[1:22:20] it's a long trip they're gonna pass not
[1:22:22] far from where jacob lives but
[1:22:24] oh oh my father lives just over the hill
[1:22:27] he's a very wealthy man he'll give you
[1:22:29] so much more than you'll get from me as
[1:22:31] a slave in egypt just take me to my dad
[1:22:33] he'll reward you handsomely i know he
[1:22:35] will
[1:22:37] shut up we're taking you to egypt
[1:22:41] now reuben appears
[1:22:43] back from whatever he had to do seeking
[1:22:45] to rescue joseph but
[1:22:47] reuben returned to the pit and behold
[1:22:49] joseph was not in the pit and reuben
[1:22:52] tore his clothes he returned to his
[1:22:54] brothers and said the child is not i
[1:22:57] whither shall i go
[1:22:59] reuben comes to the pit to rescue joseph
[1:23:01] joseph isn't there the nlt puts it this
[1:23:04] way
[1:23:05] sometime later
[1:23:06] reuben returned to get joseph out of the
[1:23:08] cistern
[1:23:09] when he discovered that joseph was
[1:23:11] missing
[1:23:12] he tore his clothes in grief
[1:23:14] then he went back to his brothers and
[1:23:16] lamented the boy is gone
[1:23:18] what will i do now
[1:23:22] now
[1:23:23] the remaining nine brothers realized
[1:23:24] reuben was going to betray them to their
[1:23:26] father by rescuing joseph
[1:23:28] shaky ground for reuben
[1:23:30] but there's no indication that they told
[1:23:32] reuben that they sold joseph they let
[1:23:35] him think he was killed
[1:23:37] maybe simeon kept the two shekels that
[1:23:39] would have been rubens for the share of
[1:23:40] the sale of joseph to the traders right
[1:23:43] firstborn gets double portion
[1:23:46] he might as well get the double portion
[1:23:47] why
[1:23:48] tell reuben about this
[1:23:50] they took joseph's coat
[1:23:52] killed a kid of the goats
[1:23:54] that the coat and the blood and they
[1:23:55] sent the coat of many colors they
[1:23:57] brought it to their father and said oh
[1:23:59] we found this
[1:24:00] do you know it was this joseph
[1:24:04] they're all in on the deception of the
[1:24:06] deceiver
[1:24:09] meanwhile
[1:24:10] the last verse in chapter 37 the
[1:24:12] midianites sold him into egypt unto
[1:24:14] potiphar an officer of pharaohs
[1:24:17] captain of the guard
[1:24:20] reuben's attempt to save joseph's life
[1:24:22] succeeded
[1:24:24] but his attempt to rescue and restore
[1:24:26] him to jacob
[1:24:27] has failed
[1:24:29] but unknown to all of them
[1:24:31] unknown to joseph
[1:24:33] unknown to reuben
[1:24:35] as the fact that joseph did not need to
[1:24:37] be rescued
[1:24:39] years later
[1:24:41] when the brothers come to egypt to buy
[1:24:43] grain the first time
[1:24:45] joseph accused them of being spies and
[1:24:46] put them in prison we read that like the
[1:24:48] cistern
[1:24:50] the prison was a stone pit
[1:24:52] the penalty for being a spy is death
[1:24:55] the brothers like joseph 22 years
[1:24:57] earlier were in fear
[1:25:00] for their lives you can be sure that
[1:25:01] they were roughly treated they weren't
[1:25:03] being chaperoned to the local hilton as
[1:25:05] guests of egypt
[1:25:06] they were being treated like enemies of
[1:25:08] the state and put in a dungeon under
[1:25:10] grim circumstances
[1:25:13] well let's jump forward to that episode
[1:25:15] in egypt they'd been in prison he put
[1:25:17] them into ward for three days
[1:25:20] and joseph said unto them on the third
[1:25:22] day
[1:25:23] this dude live for for i fear god
[1:25:26] noticed what he put him in it was oaths
[1:25:29] by the life of pharaoh this and by the
[1:25:31] life of pharaoh that but now it's
[1:25:33] i fear god there's there's something
[1:25:35] happening here if you be true men let
[1:25:38] one of your brethren be bound in the
[1:25:39] house of your prison go ye carry corn
[1:25:42] for the famine of your houses so it's
[1:25:44] not send one back now it's i'm only
[1:25:47] going to keep one
[1:25:49] but bring your youngest brother unto me
[1:25:51] so that your words will be verified and
[1:25:52] you shall not die
[1:25:54] and they did so he knew they'd have to
[1:25:56] come back because he knew the famine was
[1:25:58] going to be for years
[1:26:00] they were going to starve they'd come
[1:26:01] back
[1:26:03] and they said one to another
[1:26:06] we are verily guilty concerning our
[1:26:08] brother and that we saw the anguish of
[1:26:09] his soul when he besought us and we
[1:26:11] would not hear
[1:26:12] therefore is this distress come upon us
[1:26:16] and now reuben rescues joseph
[1:26:19] a second time
[1:26:24] reuben answered them saying
[1:26:26] spake i not unto you saying do not sin
[1:26:30] against the child
[1:26:31] and you would not hear
[1:26:34] therefore behold also his blood is
[1:26:36] required his blood is required means
[1:26:38] that reuben thinks he's dead
[1:26:41] they knew not that joseph understood
[1:26:43] them for he spake unto them by an
[1:26:45] interpreter and he
[1:26:47] joseph having just heard the words of
[1:26:49] reuben just
[1:26:51] understood that things were different
[1:26:52] than what he thought
[1:26:54] turned himself about from them and wept
[1:26:58] and returned to them again
[1:27:00] and spoke with them and took from them
[1:27:02] simeon and bound him before their eyes
[1:27:05] and again bound him took him this these
[1:27:07] are
[1:27:08] these are not gentle terms
[1:27:11] so here's joseph he's been contemplating
[1:27:13] revenge
[1:27:14] making them suffer like he suffered
[1:27:17] abusing them like he'd been abused but
[1:27:20] upon hearing reuben's words joseph
[1:27:22] quickly leaves them he just learned that
[1:27:24] reuben thought that joseph had been
[1:27:26] killed and that reuben had intervened
[1:27:28] for joseph
[1:27:31] joseph weeps
[1:27:32] this certainly suggests he's repenting
[1:27:34] of at least reconsidering what he'd
[1:27:36] planned for them
[1:27:40] when joseph returns to them he has
[1:27:43] simeon bound simeon and levi were the
[1:27:45] cruel pair
[1:27:46] and simeon was the older of the two
[1:27:48] bound before their eyes is violent
[1:27:50] driving home joseph's power to do
[1:27:52] whatever he wants
[1:27:55] let's jump forward a few months later
[1:27:57] after the second trip to egypt to buy
[1:27:59] green
[1:28:01] joseph plants his cup and benjamin's
[1:28:03] sack of grain and uses this roost to
[1:28:05] keep benjamin with him and send the rest
[1:28:07] of his siblings back to canaan
[1:28:10] judah pleads with joseph
[1:28:12] joseph realizes his brother's heart has
[1:28:15] truly changed
[1:28:17] i hope someday we can look at how this
[1:28:18] happened but for tonight we're short of
[1:28:21] time so we'll skip to the last part of
[1:28:22] judah's speech
[1:28:24] genesis 44.
[1:28:26] now this is judah the one that said
[1:28:28] let's sell them to the slavers that'll
[1:28:30] really serve him right
[1:28:33] so
[1:28:34] judah is
[1:28:36] has intervened
[1:28:38] with joseph
[1:28:39] and said
[1:28:41] because joseph wants to keep benjamin he
[1:28:42] says
[1:28:43] and thy servant my father jacob said
[1:28:46] unto us you know that my wife rachel
[1:28:49] bear me two sons
[1:28:52] and the one
[1:28:53] joseph went out from me and i said
[1:28:55] surely joseph is torn in pieces and i
[1:28:57] saw him not sense
[1:28:59] and jacob says
[1:29:01] and if you take this benjamin also from
[1:29:03] me and miss you if you follow me shall
[1:29:04] bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to
[1:29:07] the grave
[1:29:09] now therefore when i come to thy servant
[1:29:12] my father this is reuben begging and
[1:29:14] pleading with joseph and benjamin be not
[1:29:17] with us seeing that jacob's life is
[1:29:20] bound up in the lad's life it shall come
[1:29:22] to pass
[1:29:24] when jacob sees that benjamin is not
[1:29:26] with us
[1:29:27] that jacob will die
[1:29:29] and thy servants shall bring down the
[1:29:31] gray hairs of thy servant our father
[1:29:34] with sorrow to the grave
[1:29:38] here comes judah to the rescue
[1:29:40] expressing his complete change of heart
[1:29:43] the patriarch of the tribe that would
[1:29:46] produce the lion
[1:29:48] for thy servant judah became surety for
[1:29:52] the lad unto my father saying
[1:29:54] if i bring him not unto thee then i
[1:29:57] shall bear the blame to my father
[1:29:59] forever
[1:30:01] i myself not myself and my siblings
[1:30:05] i
[1:30:06] now therefore i pray thee
[1:30:09] let thy servant abide instead of the lad
[1:30:12] a bondman a slave to my lord and let the
[1:30:16] lad go up with his brethren
[1:30:19] i'll be the substitutionary sacrifice
[1:30:21] for my brothers
[1:30:23] for how shall i jew to go up to my
[1:30:26] father
[1:30:27] and the lad be not with me
[1:30:30] last pear adventure i see the evil that
[1:30:32] shall come on my father
[1:30:36] this time
[1:30:37] judah has revealed his changed heart
[1:30:39] from the one that said let's sell him
[1:30:42] and really get revenge on this person
[1:30:43] that we hate and envy to
[1:30:46] my life for his
[1:30:48] as joseph is about to keep benjamin and
[1:30:50] send the other siblings home
[1:30:52] at this revelation joseph breaks down
[1:30:56] and shows himself to his brothers not as
[1:30:58] the vizier of egypt but as their brother
[1:31:00] the next
[1:31:02] verse i'm sorry i didn't
[1:31:04] keep up with this
[1:31:05] then joseph could not refrain himself
[1:31:07] from before all them that stood by him
[1:31:09] and he cried cause every man to go out
[1:31:12] from me
[1:31:14] and there stood no man with him while
[1:31:16] joseph made himself known unto his
[1:31:18] brethren
[1:31:20] and he wept aloud
[1:31:22] and the egyptians
[1:31:24] and the house of pharaoh heard
[1:31:28] and joseph said unto his brethren i am
[1:31:31] joseph does my father yet live
[1:31:35] his brethren could not answer him for
[1:31:37] they were troubled that his presence and
[1:31:38] joseph said unto his brethren come near
[1:31:40] to me i pray you
[1:31:42] and they came near and he said
[1:31:44] i am joseph your brother whom ye sold
[1:31:47] into egypt
[1:31:49] now therefore be not grieved nor angry
[1:31:52] with yourselves that she sold me hither
[1:31:54] this is after judah's impassioned plea
[1:31:58] joseph realizes that not only is he
[1:32:00] changed his brothers have as well for
[1:32:03] god did send me before you to prepare to
[1:32:06] preserve life
[1:32:08] for these two years hath the famine been
[1:32:10] in the land and yet there are five years
[1:32:12] in the which there shall neither be
[1:32:14] earring nor harvest
[1:32:16] and god sent me before you to preserve
[1:32:20] you with posterity in the earth and to
[1:32:22] save your lives by a great deliverance
[1:32:26] so now it was not you that sent me
[1:32:28] hither but god
[1:32:30] and he hath made me a father to pharaoh
[1:32:32] and lord of all his house and a ruler
[1:32:35] throughout all the land of egypt
[1:32:38] what an ironic twist
[1:32:41] if reuben's rescue back in dothan has
[1:32:43] succeeded they'd probably all be dead
[1:32:47] did ruben's rescue fail
[1:32:49] no
[1:32:50] and this time reuben coupled with judah
[1:32:53] did rescue joseph
[1:32:55] not from his brothers but from himself
[1:32:58] and joseph rescued all of them from
[1:33:01] starvation
[1:33:02] during a great famine
[1:33:04] there's something here that
[1:33:06] that we need to recognize
[1:33:09] joseph here repeats three times
[1:33:12] that his going to egypt was god
[1:33:16] sending him
[1:33:18] so we have to ask
[1:33:21] were joseph's brothers walking in the
[1:33:22] fear of the lord
[1:33:24] were they seeking god's will for joseph
[1:33:26] oh lord show us what we should do with
[1:33:28] your servant joseph
[1:33:30] were they consciously and sincerely
[1:33:32] trying to follow the will of god
[1:33:35] or were they fleshly spiteful freewill
[1:33:37] people motivated by hate and envy
[1:33:41] it's clear they were the latter
[1:33:44] the apostle paul helps us understand
[1:33:46] this dynamic we're all familiar with
[1:33:48] this verse we know
[1:33:51] that all things
[1:33:53] work together for good
[1:33:55] to them that love god
[1:33:57] to them who are the called according to
[1:33:59] his purpose
[1:34:01] have you ever considered how this verse
[1:34:03] fits so perfectly
[1:34:05] with joseph's story
[1:34:07] paul also tells us in his letter to the
[1:34:09] church at philippi
[1:34:12] but i would you should understand
[1:34:14] brethren that the things which happened
[1:34:16] unto me he's in prison have fallen out
[1:34:19] rather unto the furtherance of the
[1:34:20] gospel
[1:34:22] so that my bonds in christ
[1:34:24] are manifest to all the palace and in
[1:34:27] all other places and many of the
[1:34:29] brethren and the lord growing confident
[1:34:31] by my bonds are much more bold to speak
[1:34:34] the word without fear
[1:34:38] some indeed preach christ even of envy
[1:34:41] and strife
[1:34:43] some also of good will the one preach
[1:34:45] christ of contention not sincerely
[1:34:48] supposing to add affliction to my bonds
[1:34:50] the other of love
[1:34:52] knowing that i am successful
[1:34:55] what then
[1:34:56] notwithstanding every way whether in
[1:34:58] pretense or in truth christ is preached
[1:35:03] and i therein do rejoice and yea
[1:35:06] i will rejoice
[1:35:08] this doesn't mean that we should do bad
[1:35:10] things evil things be motivated by
[1:35:13] revenge or lust or hate or envy
[1:35:16] god will correct us if we're his and do
[1:35:18] such but the real point is that god can
[1:35:21] use the actions of free will
[1:35:24] self-indulgent wrongly motivated people
[1:35:27] to bring about his will in spite of them
[1:35:31] we might say he makes lemonade out of
[1:35:33] lemons
[1:35:35] look at the events that god used
[1:35:38] but didn't necessarily motivate or
[1:35:40] direct to get joseph to egypt
[1:35:44] and set him up to be trained how to
[1:35:47] raise wheat
[1:35:48] on potiphar's plantation how to operate
[1:35:51] within the egyptian culture and legal
[1:35:53] and government systems and on and on and
[1:35:55] on all that training
[1:35:57] we have joseph
[1:35:59] promoted by favoritism by his father in
[1:36:02] response to a wrong committed by reuben
[1:36:05] sold into slavery
[1:36:07] by jealous siblings who despised him
[1:36:11] marched to egypt by ishmaelites who
[1:36:13] hated him because of his father jacob
[1:36:16] and grandfather isaac who was still
[1:36:17] alive at that time
[1:36:19] the very one who took what they saw is
[1:36:21] rightfully theirs through ishmael
[1:36:24] isaac's older brother
[1:36:27] god was able to arrange all the details
[1:36:30] so that wickedness
[1:36:32] wickedness
[1:36:34] manifested through free will
[1:36:36] would accomplish his sovereign plan
[1:36:40] the physical through joseph the
[1:36:42] spiritual through jesus the lion of the
[1:36:44] tribe of judah
[1:36:46] consider
[1:36:47] joseph had to be sent from hebron
[1:36:50] exactly when he was
[1:36:53] to arrive in shechem exactly when he did
[1:36:57] to be directed by a stranger that he
[1:36:59] just happened to encounter while
[1:37:01] wandering in the surrounding fields the
[1:37:04] stranger having just happened to have
[1:37:06] overheard the brother's plan to go to
[1:37:08] dothan
[1:37:10] dothan which happened to be a remote
[1:37:12] place with cisterns and caves and the
[1:37:14] right setup to plot and execute a murder
[1:37:18] reuben had to persuade his brothers not
[1:37:20] to kill him
[1:37:22] and his subsequent rescue plan had to
[1:37:25] fail
[1:37:26] so that at the exact moment a caravan of
[1:37:29] spice traders headed from gilead to
[1:37:32] egypt
[1:37:33] happened to take the route through
[1:37:35] dothan at the exact time the brothers
[1:37:37] were sitting down to eat lunch while
[1:37:39] joseph was in the cistern so that this
[1:37:42] caravan could be seen
[1:37:44] and the traitors had to be
[1:37:46] ishmaelites to ensure that their hatred
[1:37:49] for isaac and jacob would dissuade them
[1:37:52] from taking a large reward from jacob
[1:37:54] for the return of his favorite son
[1:37:57] they had to get to that slave market at
[1:38:00] exactly the right day at the right time
[1:38:03] under the right circumstances in the
[1:38:05] right city in egypt 300 miles away and
[1:38:08] they had to sell them to a specific man
[1:38:12] who would happen to be in the market at
[1:38:15] that precise time
[1:38:17] and in need of a slave
[1:38:19] and the buyer had to happen to be the
[1:38:22] captain of the guard so things could
[1:38:25] eventually result in joseph being taken
[1:38:27] to pharaoh to interpret his dreams but
[1:38:30] only after several years of working in
[1:38:32] the wheat fields so he'd know exactly
[1:38:35] how to deal with the future harvest and
[1:38:37] famine
[1:38:39] joseph had to have the morocca character
[1:38:41] to resist the advantages of potiphar's
[1:38:43] wife so he could be put in the right
[1:38:45] prison at the right time to meet the
[1:38:47] right people to interpret the dreams of
[1:38:49] the butler and baker who had to offend
[1:38:52] pharaoh so that they could meet joseph
[1:38:54] though this goes on and on and on
[1:38:58] it doesn't say that god moved this
[1:39:00] person here chapter 37 of genesis god's
[1:39:03] not even mentioned
[1:39:04] he's working in the background but he's
[1:39:06] at work these are not coincidences
[1:39:09] these people were not dedicated servants
[1:39:11] of god seeking his will in their lives
[1:39:13] every day and stressing over little
[1:39:15] things
[1:39:16] no
[1:39:17] the musicians would please come
[1:39:20] god used all of these people
[1:39:22] in all of these roles in all of these
[1:39:25] places to bring about salvation and show
[1:39:28] us that even when he seems to be absent
[1:39:32] he's present
[1:39:34] and working for our benefit
[1:39:37] i will never leave you
[1:39:39] or forsake you
[1:39:41] has god called you
[1:39:43] are you his child
[1:39:46] does your my occasional or all too
[1:39:48] frequent disobedience change that
[1:39:50] relationship
[1:39:53] rest in this
[1:39:55] we know
[1:39:57] we don't guess
[1:39:58] we're not just hoping
[1:40:01] we know
[1:40:02] that all
[1:40:04] all things work together
[1:40:07] for what
[1:40:08] good
[1:40:10] for whom
[1:40:11] them that love god and are called
[1:40:13] according to
[1:40:15] whose purpose our own no
[1:40:18] his purpose
[1:40:20] be it disease death sickness
[1:40:24] pandemics
[1:40:25] economic stress
[1:40:28] doesn't matter
[1:40:30] all things
[1:40:32] like i said just pray together for a
[1:40:34] moment and sing a song of worship as

[1:41:01] you don't hear
[1:41:02] that we know you do

[1:43:12] his name again
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:22] hear him
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:41] it takes me back to another
[1:43:44] account
[1:43:47] of a taxation
[1:43:49] and they had to go back to the city
[1:43:52] that they were
[1:43:53] born in
[1:43:56] so that jesus could be called
[1:43:59] from that city
[1:44:01] there had to be romans
[1:44:04] in that time
[1:44:05] so he could be lifted up on a tree
[1:44:10] what seemed to be cruel
[1:44:12] and hard
[1:44:13] and ugly
[1:44:15] was exactly what god used
[1:44:18] to fulfill back all the way
[1:44:21] in isaiah when he said behold the virgin
[1:44:23] shall conceive
[1:44:26] oh how could that be
[1:44:28] oh when people looked down and said no
[1:44:30] way that could not be god
[1:44:33] he would have come down
[1:44:35] as brother branham very often described
[1:44:38] they were expecting them to come out of
[1:44:39] heaven and golden
[1:44:41] stairs but god has a way
[1:44:45] to bring to pass his word
[1:44:48] and sometimes we'd say oh don't that
[1:44:51] can't be the lord
[1:44:53] but i think we could all testify god has
[1:44:55] done things in our lives that we would
[1:44:57] have never said that would have been god
[1:45:01] how many knows that how many can see
[1:45:02] that in your life how many realize it
[1:45:05] that is god
[1:45:06] he knows you by name
[1:45:08] let's stand
[1:45:09] [Music]
[1:45:12] the bible teaches us all these things
[1:45:14] were recorded for us to learn
[1:45:17] to understand to see that god has it all
[1:45:21] under control
[1:45:23] to imagine moses
[1:45:25] go deliver my people
[1:45:27] from egypt
[1:45:29] go tell that pharaoh let my people go
[1:45:32] brother branham calls him the one man
[1:45:33] army
[1:45:35] yeah we would have said oh yeah whatever
[1:45:37] moses you've been out in the sun way too
[1:45:39] long
[1:45:40] but the word of god said it would be
[1:45:44] you look at your situation
[1:45:46] you look at maybe what you're going
[1:45:48] through
[1:45:49] and you say there's no hope
[1:45:51] but god says go back to what the word of
[1:45:53] god says
[1:45:55] and stand on that and i'll bring it to
[1:45:57] pass because he never fails
[1:45:59] let's pray lord we thank you
[1:46:02] that you could take of lives of men
[1:46:06] it's just not a story in the bible
[1:46:09] but things that actually happen lord and
[1:46:12] you had them written down
[1:46:14] so that we could see that you're the
[1:46:16] same yesterday today and forever
[1:46:19] and we can look back in our own lives
[1:46:21] and see how god moved
[1:46:23] maybe through the what we thought was an
[1:46:26] oppression or a jealousy or
[1:46:29] somebody taking advantage of us and
[1:46:31] caused us to go a different direction do
[1:46:33] something differently but you already
[1:46:35] had something there waiting for us lord
[1:46:38] had we tried to figure it out try to do
[1:46:40] it we would have missed it by millions
[1:46:43] of miles
[1:46:44] but you said your word would not fail
[1:46:46] lord and we're trusting in that today
[1:46:48] lord
[1:46:50] we thank you for that lord to remind us
[1:46:52] how much you care for us lord
[1:46:55] we love you in jesus christ's name
[1:46:58] amen do you imagine remember when we
[1:47:00] spoke this morning
[1:47:01] he took an airplane and brought it down
[1:47:03] in tennessee
[1:47:05] because there was a sister that needed
[1:47:07] an elijah
[1:47:08] but he didn't tell elijah he just told
[1:47:10] elijah go walking
[1:47:12] that's all he told him
[1:47:14] but the sister said god told me he was
[1:47:16] sent him so she put herself out there
[1:47:18] and said i'll wait here until god sends
[1:47:20] him along teach me lord to wait
[1:47:24] turn out to believe amen he is here
[1:47:29] hallelujah
