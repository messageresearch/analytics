to your attention um there's a brother from he's living in phoenix now but when my dad was doing the work in mexico he would stop him and visit him in a town called embodiment which is close to wymas and the brother helped my dad quite a bit but he called my father yesterday morning crying his his son the brother's name is oscar aviles and his son oscar passed away yesterday the whole family had been struck with kobets several months ago and they'd seem to recover it but his son started hanging around with the wrong crowd and yesterday he came home and he passed away so i asked dad how old brother oscar was he figured he was in his late 40s maybe early 50s his son was in his 20s so he was a very brokenhearted this morning and so we we told him we would remember him in prayer and we got a report that my uncle john we mentioned it wednesday but that his lungs were full of blood clots also got a report that at the spanish tabernacle there are very many sick with covet in the church we have two two folks that contact us that we're related to and they have actually had some pass away but they're kept very quiet about it but it has it has affected quite a few families there are some in the hospital there's some at home and some of them are still attending church so it's it's gotten very critical so there are brothers and there are sisters okay some folks have their issues and things but god be merciful to me and if i want him to be merciful to me i must be merciful to others that's that's how god works so let's remember them and this morning my sister-in-law is elizabeth is here and she's been having a lot of problems with vertigo and the doctors told her she has i think it's called menaire's disease which causes vertigo and the doctors told her it was incurable but we talked to another doctor the doctor of doctors and he has a whole different prognosis a whole different way to deal with things and i'm so glad that we can talk with him that he's mindful of us that he was wounded before the foundation of the world is that he was slain for everything that would come our way so do you feel you can come up or do you want us to go back back there if you feel it'll be okay to walk up prince if you'll come up with her we're going to anoint her with oil she asked [Music] my the oil's not up here here it is [Music] if you'll stand with me maybe a couple other you sisters would like to come up that would be fine too [Music] i'm close here if we can't believe all things are [Music] possible [Music] lord we come to you believing you've said they would anoint with oil say would lay hands lord and every part of your promise every part of your word is true lord we speak to this disease and we curse it in the name of jesus christ it has no hold in her because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world his effects lord the verdigold it causes the loss of balance and everything that goes lord i just ask starting even now lord it would begin to leave her body and she would testify of the alien power of jesus christ not only that but each one here today brother oscar abilis in the in the heaviness of their heart lord in the loss of a son lord and each one lord in every church and every part of this world lord is going through a hardship and a hard time lord father you didn't put limits you didn't say only those from this part of the world or only those in this church you said to everyone that would call on your name lord and would believe they could receive lord so we're asking now for mercy for grace for healing lord and we'll give you all honor and all glory lord and we will hear the testimonies of what you have done lord for we believe it in jesus christ's name amen amen [Music] heal me and i will be me and i will be heal me hold on and i will be for you are the one i pray [Music] thank you you may be seated just we got an update on sister angela boyd and let me read it so that i get it [Music] right this was um i believe from either sister christie or sister aunt um joy saying roy let us know last night angela is off the ventilator and her oxygen is at 100 breathing on her own i said they got on a light sedation and they'll be moving her to a normal room maybe someday blood work came back great they're thinning it so it doesn't thicken pray for her strength to return she'll be able to start moving around next week she is suffering with severe anxiety i can understand that but let's thank god for what he's done already so appreciate that god being so good to us amen so also uh just like to say happy birthday to my dad he'll be 84 tomorrow i appreciate that [Applause] and to those of you who have a father and he still calls you up and he talks to you and he advises you and he scolds you you ought to be thankful for that he still calls me up and says send him are you taking care except did you drink plenty of water today do you know what it's cause he loves me if he didn't care i wouldn't hear from him and i appreciate that so also brother matt watkins said oh we spoke with him a bit ago and they have the plans for him and sister rachel to be here this coming weekend following weekend and be here for both services and i understand that brother matt would like to share his heart also with us as as we've talked about how we're going to proceed over the next few months whether we're going to extend the time or things so we'll want to get that resolved as quick as possible because i don't know how much longer or anybody's saying let's take another year or two waiting on this i don't believe that's anybody's heart but we also want to do what god wants us to do okay that's that's priority that's first lord is this your will and if it's not then lord you show us which way we're to go and give us the heart to do it that way you know and brother branham said it that way he says you feel something to do he said start walking in that direction and see if that's what god wants you to do and and god i don't believe wants us sitting on a rocking chair just waiting for him to come and tap us on the shoulder and say okay get up and go. there are things we can be doing we can be praying we can be seeking god's god's favor we can be telling others of the grace of god and plenty to keep yourself busy with while god moves so you keep praying about that and see how the lord would would uh would answer that for us so um don't have any more details than that so i'm not going to say anymore and then give out the wrong information but so let's just trust in the lord he's kept us this far he said he would never leave us he would not forsake us and he keeps his word so let's believe that together so as brother matt continues with his service here save me and i will be saved heal me [Music] i pray [Music] we're still knee flat the spirit of the living god spirit of the living god [Music] foreign break me [Music] god [Music] god fresh on me [Music] spirit of the living

this morning and i appreciate uh this matthew there and musicians i'm excited to be here this morning and then we have um very thrilled to introduce to you an associate minister here in buford brother jason to mars and the lord put it upon my heart just to ask him to speak last week amen and so he's going to be carrying the service over uh today we trust that everything comes through as always we're we're depending on the lord and in between that is technology so we've had just a little bit of trouble this morning getting things set up on our end and getting things set up with brother jason's computer here but i think everything is well i think the video and audio from the test that we had is coming through good amen so uh so just trust that that continues uh brother jason is going to be speaking for us today whatever the lord has put upon his heart trust that you came with an expectation amen and that you have an expectation not to hear from a man who you maybe have never heard before uh although brother jason's very well known he's a uh he's a worldwide minister uh missionary uh to the middle east and so uh but don't look to a man don't look to uh a talent or the ability to articulate but uh have an expectation that the lord jesus is gonna meet your need and that whatever you have need of brother branham said he's the he's the chief shepherd and uh he feeds his sheep he feeds us and so it doesn't matter who's speaking it doesn't matter as long as your expectation is right i believe the lord has something for you today uh it's good to have brother paul amen murray sister andriana here uh this morning i was informed they were in service again so glad to know sister andrean is doing well and praise god for that i know many others today we still want to continue to remember our brother daryl ward who is feeling better today even wednesday brother aaron gave you an update on sister cheryl and she's still quite sick and her daughters and brother brother daryl's daughter so we just want to remember them in prayer and i'm sure there's many other needs the needs that were brought up today uh even we'll want to continue to remember those the only announcement i have is that there will be no evening service tonight we're just going to have this service this morning and brother aaron will come after brother jason and dismiss and close the service out lord willing if all goes well we will be there this coming weekend in tucson amen so looking forward to that greatly and then we'll be holding two services this uh coming next weekend sunday morning sunday night okay why don't we just uh if the musicians not sure if they're still playing we'll just say a word of prayer turn it over to brother jason lord jesus father we're so grateful lord that distance means nothing to you lord that father that you showed up time and time again you've poured out your grace upon us here lord and those that are gathered there at the church those that are gathered in their homes lord your grace is so great upon us father lord that in spite of lord it may be an unconventional set up lord an unconventional way to minister your word yet lord we're able to steal father take your gospel take your truth lord and it's setting people's lives free we've heard testimonies of it father even lord as recent as last sunday lord the reports i got father of even the the atmosphere and the spirit lord that you poured out upon us father your spirit we asked lord that it would come and fall fresh upon us again lord may you just lord anoint our brother jason lord with whatever you've put upon his heart lord may he just feel your spirit lord the unction of the holy ghost i pray father there would be no hindrances lord but you said wherever the spirit of the lord is there is liberty may you give our brother liberty lord may the pools from the people this morning god be felt even lord hear god in beaufort i pray for brother jason lord as we pull on the word of god we've come with an expectation lord many different needs lord with many praise reports we're thankful father for sister andreana lord and the murray family here today in church and service lord i no

name amen amen god bless you amen may god bless you thank you for this opportunity brother matt i sure appreciate that and i've greatly appreciated the brother matt's friendship and his ministry and have been greatly impacted by it and i'm uh if you don't uh know me i'm originally from minnesota and uh my nieces and nephews uh i think last year went to one of the youth meetings in phoenix and were just greatly greatly impacted by brother matt's ministry and they're they're feeling the impacts still and they always enjoy coming down here and they're hopeful that brother matt will be ministering when they come down to visit myself and and my wife sister amy um if if you uh not familiar i again originally from minnesota and the lord through many circumstances and and actions and different things that he uh spoke to us as a family led us to move down to beaufort south carolina here and uh we've been we've been blessed and very thankful for what the lord has is doing in our lives here of course we miss our our family greatly back in minnesota but we you know we take comfort knowing that it was the lord that led us down here my my parents are still in minnesota they're older but my dad was excited to hear that i would be preaching from beaufort to a church in tucson arizona he's uh he loves anything that's western and so just to hear that i was going to preach for a church in tucson he became really really excited so i'm excited as well just really thankful for this opportunity um with that said i want to go to the word i want to speak on the subject knowing god if you want to stand as we open in the word to isaiah chapter 6 i want to look go through the scriptures and look at the attributes of god uh this isn't so much dealing with the elect as his thoughts and a part of his life and thus his attributes and neither is it really looking at the doctrine of the godhead uh but we're we'll explain more what we mean by the attributes of god but before we do that i'm going to look at isaiah chapter six and we'll read one through seven in the year that king uzziah died i saw the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and the train of his robe filled the temple above him stood the seraphim each had six wings with two he covered his face and with two he covered his feet and with two he flew and one called to another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of him who called and the house was filled with smoke and i said woe is me for i am lost for i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts then one of the seraphim flew to me having his hand in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar and he touched my mouth and said behold this has touched your lips your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for let's pray heavenly father we just come to you now in the name of the lord jesus we ask that your spirit would come and enliven this word in our hearts lord take it and make it so real to us lord may be a a revelation deep within our soul we know that knowing you it's not by human understanding human reason but it's by personal revelation to the individual and so would you come to each one as an individual lord and reveal yourself a little bit more to them we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you can be seated looking at this verse when i originally studied this about a month ago uh it it so impacted me uh the the morning before i i preached for the first time i woke up and uh it was almost that there was a trembling within my heart i felt such a such a a heaviness just to be just to come and and speak on such a subject as the attributes of god is so um it just it feels so huge it's so great god is so great god is so powerful that who am i to come and speak of such great things and i think that's the thing that i love to speak about the most is the greatness of god i love to speak about who he is i love to make him the center of everything when you look at this verse king uzziah died and he was a great figure in the day of isaiah and it's interesting to see that this word that is used i saw the lord it doesn't say i saw capital l capital o capital r capital d i saw jehovah or yahweh i saw the lord it speaks of the sovereign one the the king i so in the year that king uzziah died i saw the lord sitting on a throne god didn't lose his throne when you king uzziah died we hear we have kings and they die or presidents and they are voted out and it goes to another one but god is the one that is the sovereign over everything king uzziah was an important figure he did much to restore worship he did much to make judah a more powerful kingdom and it was because of his trust in the lord but when he trusts when he when he became great [Music] he took his trust away from the lord and put his trust in his position and in his riches and his success and that's when he went into the temple and it was against god's law and he went into the temple and he offered incense and he was immediately struck with leprosy and he had to live in a separate room and rule his kingdom from a private room the rest of his life and so king uzziah died in that year they would have had a year of mourning they would have a year of sorrow even isaiah isaiah was connected to the royal family he was an important a person in society he wasn't he was he was not a lower class person he was he was in the upper class he was a he was a part of the aristocracy you would you would say connected with the royal family and and him as a prophet even he would have been in a place of mourning over the death of king uzziah but then god opened the scene to his prophet to see the true reality in the temple there's god seated upon his throne and he's so great so powerful just the train of his robe filled completely filled the temple and it speaks of the seraphim standing above him this sovereign god surrounded by angels these angels have never been in the presence of sin these angels have never sinned they themselves are are holy separated unto god there in his presence and god is so much more holy these angels have to have six wings two to cover their face two to cover their feet and with two they fly they're in the presence of god this is how great how mighty this god and they cry holy holy holy it's not speaking of a trinity of persons what is it what is it speaking of when in in the hebrew they will use that as jesus said verily verily or in aramaic he would have said amen amen i say unto you it wasn't a mistake of speech it was saying this is this is a point that's emphasized i'm saying this is complete this is a this is complete truth that i'm speaking unto you and here the angels are saying not only is it completely holy god is infinitely holy and in fact he's so great he's so powerful the whole earth is full of his glory the the earth itself cannot even contain his glory and when he begins to speak uh the foundations there's an earthquake the earth tr itself trembles and this is isaiah's response to this vision this isaiah was a prophet he was set apart to the lord he was the holiest man in israel he was the godliest man in israel this is his response in coming into the presence of the lord woe is me for i am undone this this word woe is me um in in yiddish that is actually and so we've heard that statement before sometimes said jokingly but that's what it means is woe is me it's a statement of extreme emotion a statement of extreme pain extreme devastation woe is me and then he follows that up with worth for i am undone have you ever heard the statement this person he has it all together so this is the opposite of that isaiah is saying i have completely fallen apart woe is me i am i'm in pieces my emotional being my spiritual being my whole existence is now crumbled to pieces i'm undone i'm broken that is the response of the holy prophet of god when he comes and sees god in his glory sitting there upon the throne i'm finished and he makes this confession the godliest man in israel says i'm a man i have a dirty mouth my mouth is filthy and by extension my life is filthy because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks and that creates the life that's the life that you live and and and he's saying i'm unclean i'm dirty i am filthy when it comes to being in the presence of god this is the greatness of the holiness of god it speaks of transcendent holiness this isn't just what god has set apart when we're talking about god being three times holy we're saying his holiness is transcendent it's far above any holiness that you and i have created in our life by god god alone is holy god alone is transcendently holy he's so far above and beyond different than you and i why is again why is isaiah come to this place he says because my eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts a true revelation of who god is would produce this kind of understanding about yourself how can we ever experience true salvation in christ until we've experienced this that we come to the presence of god and say i am broken i am dead i have nothing to offer you lord i'm completely sinful and isn't it beautiful that god doesn't say yeah you're right isaiah you're right and there's no hope for you no immediately the seraphim knows what to do he goes takes that burning coal what what if think of that for yourself taking a burning coal put that coal burning coal upon your lips what a pain that would be what a painful purging that speaks of though i don't believe it was something that was truly painful for isaiah the picture is there what a painful purging that took place but the answer back was this has touched your lips your guilt is taken away and your sin is atoned for god is acknowledging of course you're right isaiah that is true what you said is the truth but i have a solution for your problem that's the grace of god that's the beauty of god but we don't really come to that place of seeing the salvation of the lord until we can come to the place where you say woe is me i'm undone i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell amongst people of unclean lips jeremiah 9 23 24 jeremiah says thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which exercise loving kindness and judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight sayeth the lord isn't that beautiful if you're gonna brag if you're gonna if you're gonna glorify something don't let it be sports your city that you live in your past history and life that's nothing to glory about the thing that we need to take our greatest delight in and glory in is that we know the lord not just in a surface knowledge but knowing that in these things the the he's the lord that exercise loving kindness judgment and righteousness we know who he is because we know his attributes of who he is and i i feel so strongly that it's so critical for us you know in our walk with the lord to on a frequent basis not just think about our troubles and pray not just focus on the promises that affect us that's good there's nothing wrong with either of those things but even greater than that we should lift our hearts up and our minds up to the majestic holiness and power and greatness of god he's the center of everything he should be our focus he is our delight he's the main theme of absolutely everything the whole theme of every chapter and verse in the bible is god revealed through jesus christ and we have a dangerous tendency sometimes to focus on man centered religion that's the hour that we're living and that's laodicea people's rights and you look at all the people that are prominent not all the people that are prominent but the main ones that are prominent on places like tbn uh trinity broadcasting network and christian television you see the preachers are so focused on me me me and you you you your life and you doing this and it can be a danger danger thing that creeps into us in the message that we're so focused on us let's get away from man-centered religion and man-focused preaching let's get back to god-centered reality you know sometimes we can so focus on this is who the bride is this is her this is his her position this is her place that we lift it out of balance instead of having our focus and say who god this is who god is this is who's revealed himself to be this is this is who he is for you it's great to know who we are but if we if we only know about who we are and we don't know him we haven't known anything yet so i want to look at um the attributes of god of course this is a ever unfolding subject so there's no way in the next 30 or 40 minutes i'm going to be able to get to every one of these things and but i just want to kind of lay a foundation of that and and get some basic understanding from merriam-webster's online dictionary says that the word attribute speaks of a quality character or characteristic ascribed to someone or something so that's what i'm looking at i'm looking at the characteristics of god but before we do that i want to look i want to just differentiate between things that sometimes we blend them together and i want to just sort of separate those out to give a better understanding of of what we're talking about the first one that we look at when we talk about the lord is we look often at the godhead or what you'll call the being of god that's the first thing and we're not going to be talking about the godhead and and looking at the relationship between the father and jesus christ and differentiating and looking at the logos and all those different things that the scripture speaks about you know god's oneness we're not gonna look at that specifically um that's a separate issue from what we're talking about the next part that we we see here um is the nature or essence of god and those things are closely related to the attributes of god and some of those some of that nature or essence of who god is kind of overlaps some of them are are parts of the attributes of god um so the nature of god speaks of the essence of who he really is again closely related to his attributes but they sort of they sort of start at the top and govern everything else in other words the attributes of god flow out from his essence or nature uh here's the first one is love we look at his essence or nature first john 4 16 and we have known and believed the love that god has to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him it's not just that love is one of god's attributes it's that god is love that's who he is next one is light first john 1 5 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all that's who he is god is light darkness has no impact and effect on him because he is light that's who he is now when we look in scripture i think in i think it's in ephesians it said whatsoever makes manifest is light so if we put that together with this scripture that god is light we understand at the core of who god is is he seeks to be manifested what good is what good is being light unless there's someone to behold that light so that doesn't mean that god is relying upon us or that god needs us to fulfill himself god is complete in himself he doesn't need us we don't add anything to god he's completing himself but that's why we're here that's why this creation is here that's why you're living the life that you are that's why he's called you he's changed he's given your spirit is because at the very core of his being is light which begs the with which just leads to the fact that he's going to unfold himself and reveal himself to others who are not him but even even within light when you think of light it also speaks of holiness or purity or goodness those different attributes of god flow out from light god is the ultimate source of holiness the ultimate source of purity the ultimate source of goodness the ultimate source of justice you know his justice and his wrath those two things together are connected with light we are only light as we derive light from him we are we only possess holiness as he takes from himself and gives it to us we only possess purity as it comes from him he is the source of all of it uh hebrews 12 29 says for our god is a consuming fire that's light on one side light produces purity on the other side when light is rejected a fire reaches out and consumes that in wrath the third uh part of his nature is or essence is from john 4 24 it says god is a spirit if you notice in the king james not every version but the scofield version you'll see that it's an italics there that means that the word a is in italics that means that the translators have added this to increase understanding but what it really says if you look at the english standard version it says god is spirit not god is a spirit there's talk there's many many spirits and god is a spirit he's one of them no god is the source god is spirit and when we look at this we understand god is not limited to one particular body he's not limited to one particular place let's look at a few scriptures jeremiah 23 24 can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see him that's speaking of his omniscience saith the lord but then it goes further and says do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord brother branham in 1956 the sermon the mighty conqueror says the place cannot be too humble too little he's praying for you to come and yet you fill all space and time ii chronicles 6 18 but will god in very deed dwell with man on earth behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house which i have built first timothy 1 17 now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god be honor and glory forever and ever part of being spirit means god is invisible he cannot be seen the scripture says and yet we understand he unfolds him he unfolded himself into the logos and that became the very body the theophany of jehovah god so that he could relate to his creation and his creation could relate to him and we see him as he manifests himself but god in himself no man has seen god at any time paul says this acts 17 28 for in him that we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring so god is a spirit as the prophet said he covers all space and time the heaven and the heavens cannot contain him and and as jeremiah says he fills all heaven and earth so these are this is the essence of god from which flows all of his attributes god is spirit god is light god is love let's take a few minutes to re reflect on the awesome the words are so feeble in describing who god is but let's look at his awesome grandeur his majestic glory and this worship provoking splendor of god i believe it will do us a great deal of good to meditate upon these things not just today but literally on a daily basis if we really think and contemplate who god really is it will have a great enormous impact on our everyday life and how we walk in this evil world again it's in knowing him personally by revelation that we receive life and that life is displayed through us that we receive strength to endure everything that we pass through in this life it brings the to know him in truth brings the comfort necessary on the journey and let me just say this when we people will make these statements my god would never do such and such the bible says to not have any other gods before him the true and living god we have no right to define who god is based on the whims of a 21st century mind my god would never do that your god might not do that but the true living god is defined by this book he's not defined by joel osteen he's not defined by benny hinn the god that is preached over the charismatic pulpit very often is not the true and living god but is a creation of men and is a violation of the first commandment which says to not have any other gods before him who he who is he he says i am that i am amen god is who he says he is god is not who you say he is god does not care what you think about who he is it has no impact about who he is all you need to do is say i i believe and trust in the god that reveals himself by his word that is absolute so here's a starting list of the attributes of god the self first one is the self existence or i would say the aloneness or uniqueness of god to the councils of god three the knowledge of god for the supremacy of god five the sovereignty of god six the holiness of god seven the glory of god eight the power of god nine the faithfulness of god ten the love of god eleven the mercy of god twelve the grace of god 13 the wrath of god 14 the goodness of god and 15 i i put as the eternal revealing of god so right there shows that i'll never be able to cover everything in one sermon or a thousand sermons because we will spend all of eternity getting to know god more and more and the revealing will never ever stop the first one i start with is the aloneness of god genesis 1 1 starts this way in the beginning god god was alone he was by himself there was no no one there with him in fact the english word god means an object of worship he wasn't even god then because there was no one there to worship him before before he created the word there in the hebrew that's used for god isn't like the english word it's a little different it's the word elohim many people have believed that this means a plural form of god which it definitely can but i want to look more specifically and if we break down these two work two words that are connected in one the word el means strong one and the word in hebrew ohim means to swear or bind by an oath so in the in the very beginning of creation we see that god is the strong one bound by an oath the first one that appears in the bible is the one who's already bound himself by his word he's already bound by his own word so not only did god dwell alone before time but god is alone in excellency exodus 15 verse 11 says who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders who's like god there's no one like god there's no one that can be a parrot compared to him he alone he is alone in excellency romans 11 34 through 36 for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counselor or who has first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen god is not in need of anything that we can give everything belongs to him everything that we have belongs to him all that we are belongs to him the bible says does not the speaking of mankind does not the potter have power over the clay to do as he wishes that is the potter is god our father he has the right to do whatever he wants to do with us god is self-sufficient there's no other being in all of the universe that is self-sufficient we all derive our life and everything from him he derives nothing from from us there's no word of blasphemy that could take away from god it could never take away from who he is in his character and in his central being and there's no amount of faith that we can put in him that would add to his essential being that would add to him yes god is glorified and dishonored by us but that takes away nothing nor adds anything to him to glorify him is to merely recognize a reality of who he is and to blaspheme him is to simply fall upon an impenetrable rock that can only crush you you cannot crush it the worst blasphemy blasphemers and atheists that have spoken the most vile things in all of history take nothing away from the majesty the splendor the excellency of god isaiah 40 21 through 23 have you not known have you not heard hath it not been told to you from the beginning have you not understood from the foundation of the earth it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in that brings the princes to nothing he makes the judges of the earth as vanity god is so far above us as he looks upon us he sees us and he says you're like grasshoppers the the the sky is like just a mere curtain that we would pull over a window and he says the earth is like a chair for him he sits upon the circle of the earth um isaiah 66 says heaven is my throne earth is my footstool the the vastness of earth when we look at it i mean just start walking and try to walk and swim around the whole earth you'll find go on a go on top of a mountain 14 000 foot mountain in colorado and look down and look at yourself or stand stand at the last spot and look up towards the people that have reached the summit and see just how miniscule they are compared to that just that mountain let alone earth and god says the earth is literally a footstool i mean think about a footstool that you have in your home maybe it's like this big and you just rest your feet on it and it's a small an insignificant thing in your home and yet to god that's what the earth is it's so minuscule compared to his the greatness and majesty of his being we esteem the the earth as great and majestic and it truly is it truly is the the majesty of the earth is an expression of the one that created created it and yet it's nothing compared to who he really is he just uses things like a rock and different things to express who he is and yet even that doesn't truly grab a hold of the greatness of who he is and he says i bring the princes to nothing and make the judges of the earth is vanity every president every king every prime minister everyone everyone in power on this earth are as nothing god only has to say this one's dead i'm relieving the life from him and he's gone but god has a purpose he is sovereign and he is working and those who are in power are there for a reason and god is working something towards his plan to accomplish his purpose on the earth exodus 8 verse 10 says and he said tomorrow and he said be it according to thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord our god there's no one like him no one can even approach to be who is yet we are made in his image yet he says the inhabitants of the earth are as grasshoppers we're made in his image what a glorious thing that he tells us and reveals us to in his word that image was lost in the garden of eden but that image is being restored through jesus christ and will ultimately be restored when he gives us a new body the councils of god acts 15 verse 18 known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world god made a plan made a purpose and that plan and that purpose was made before creation ever came to be ephesians 3 11 according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord not only did god purpose and plan and counsel before the foundation of the world he did it for his plan was fixed for all eternity acts 2 23 him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god you have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain ephesians 1 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will verse 9 and ephesians 1 as well having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself as we read these verses we see that god's purpose is eternal it has no beginning and no ending it changes not god's counsel his decree is predetermined and god works everything after the council of his own will god does nothing nothing by whimsy god does nothing unplanned he's not reacting and responding to what satan is doing satan is reacting and responding to what god is doing he's trying to thwart god's plan and all the while he's fulfilling exactly what god wants him to do he wanted satan wanted to kill jesus christ what was that god by his predetermined counsel determined that by wicked hands christ would be slain god purposed everything according to his what pleased him what he desired to do that he did god's will is free and his purposes cannot be thwarted or changed by someone else's will in other words if if i decide i want to do something different i'm not actually changing anything god has already predetermined what is what would have happened isaiah 40 13 and 14 who has rejected directed the spirit of the lord or being his counselor has taught him with whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and showed him the way of understanding it begs the answer no one has god is the original god is the source of all knowledge of all understanding he is the one who's planning god has free will let's look at this in the smirnion church age brother branham says this the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal if you can see this you'll see many things god is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we've studied that and proven that already god is infinite in his abilities so therefore he is god must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he's not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that's not scriptural he is omniscient he's never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is god thus the thoughts of god are eternal they're real they're not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up which one day will be translated into some sense and form but they are already real and eternal and part of god god's counsels are absolute and unconditional unconditional isaiah 46 10 says declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure god is not subject to the will of man god not subject to the will of angels or devils he's not subject to nature all things are subject to him his counsel will stand he will do all his good pleasure no one will thwart it or stop it [Music] god's purpose is immutable and invincible immutable means incapable of change invincible means they can't be conquered or overcome i'm going to just depart from my notes for a second because often this creates several questions and when we look at this does man have free will yes of course man has free will but god is the ultimate source of free will god has free will you and i we make choices you chose to come to church today you you you chose to wear the clothes you did god was not forcing you to do that but god knew that you would do it and he planned that you would do it and those two things are not contradictory you should we we choose what we choose no one no one is thwarting us or stopping us of course we have many conditions around us we have many experiences in life that that cause us to choose a certain way we have a nature that's founded in our dna that that governs many of the choices that we make and yet we do make free free choices and yet god is not limited by our free choices i want to just give a kind of a word picture of things when we see what happens through history we see it on a timeline yeah you know in six thousand six thousand years ago the world was created and five thousand years ago this happened and on down the line we see all the history and all the details of things that took place that's how we see the past this way we see the future this way and we think of it in a linear way god is not in time god is out completely outside of time god sits above and out of time so that when he looks down he doesn't see this timeline the way we do he sees the past the present and the future all the same i know it's hard for any human mind to comprehend the past is never never the past with god the present is always it's always present and the future is not the future with god it's all the same because he's completely outside of that now we come down to this and the the thing that will be said is well god uh if god predetermines everything that's going to happen then what is the use of me praying the very same god that decreed that a certain event would take place in this timeline also decreed that it could not happen unless someone were to pray you know it's easy to speak of that regarding healing but you know talk about the salvation of people in a far away nation it took prayer how do we know what to pray for the bible says this the spirit we don't even know how to pray but the spirit prays through us with groanings which cannot be uttered god is orchestrating this whole process when we pray it's not merely to change what's happened yes humanly speaking we look at it so and so has cancer we pray and that changes what happened on a human level that's absolutely true prayer changes things but on god's level it didn't change anything god allowed the person to come to this place that they had a sickness he moved upon the heart of the man to go and lay hands on that person and pray for them and that person was healed god ordained each step and process of that but without the prayer taking place the healing doesn't take place god is in each aspect of that the very god that ordained the salvation of people in in iran or turkey or egypt ordained to send a preacher there to preach the word to them and there was many many prayers that went into all of that process of getting there perhaps thousands perhaps tens of thousands of things happened that led to that place that brought that there and god has ordained that prayer be such a huge portion of it because he wants us to be participants active parts of his plan of salvation he could have as the prophet said he could have ordained the wind to preach the gospel he could have ordained uh the moon to preach the gospel but he ordained that man be a part of his program and his process in order to bring the salvation eternal salvation of souls and so those things are critical to understand yes god has decreed everything nothing will afford his will yes he's ordained that your prayers be a part of that process they must be prayers do not change the mind of god nothing can change the mind of god because the mind the thoughts of god are eternal he's omniscient he's not learning anything he's not changing his mind now the scripture will say in different places that it repented him that he made man upon the earth well when god speaks to us in human terms he he says i'm sick of your sacrifices is god truly sick they're a stink in my nostrils do things really genuinely smell bad to god maybe so because he says it very often but the re the real thing is that's happening that's going on is god is speaking to us in human terms that we can understand he's speaking to us in that way so we know who he is we know his purpose we know his plan so god created man he had a purpose for man and man went away from that purpose hybrid everything perverted everything and it comes to that place in the days of noah and he says it repents me at my heart that i've made man i will destroy him from the face of the earth and so god knew that would happen you know we have two levels we have god as he's revealing himself to us so that we can understand what he's doing and then god in his eternal godhood he's outside of time he knew all those things were going to happen he ordained them to happen for an example and a type his hand is in all of it he was not surprised by anything and another place in the scripture it says god is not a man that he should repent or the son of man that he should lie god does not repent yet we have scriptures that we see god repents so again what does it mean it means that there's two different ways to understand that god is not actually changing his mind because his thoughts are eternal that's who he is in himself in himself in eternity but as god deals with us in time to us when we pray it changes something when man sins god repents and says i'm going to destroy him that wasn't god's original purpose and plan for man that's not what he decreed for man to be a perverted cesspool of homosexuality and and adultery and murder and racism and all these different things he didn't make man to be that so god is sorry in his heart that man would do such and such a thing but god in himself knows that knows all these things ordained them for a purpose and so it's just a matter of seeing scripture on the level that scripture is bringing it as musicians if you'd like to come forward knowing this great god whose purpose is immutable and invincible is the greatest thing that you and i experience in our lives and i'm just so thankful for the grace that he's opened my eyes he's opened your eyes to know who he is in true reality and that he sent a message to us in this day to restore a true revelation and understanding of who he is that's his grace from start to finish i'm so thankful for that let's pray heavenly father we just come to you lord and we thank you for your word i pray that you would take this lord and take this revealed truth from scripture and let it permeate our entire being our minds and our hearts lord may it penetrate deep within our soul lord and bring a continual transformation to us lord that we would be made likened to the image of the one that we're worshiping lord we thank you for that we give you honor and glory and praise lord your good your righteousness endures forever and we're so thankful lord we ask these things in the name of

taken care of because he saw he saw you and me in this hour and this day and i appreciate that i was thinking just maybe two weeks ago speaking with someone and they were talking about the scars and the wounds in life and and and how they they're showing and how we hide them and we don't want sometimes to see people that see that we're wounded and we're hurt but to realize that he knew that already and he would make a way for us so as he was ministering and i just think majesty worship his majesty king of all kings uh words whatever words we could use whatever words we could say would it be enough it might not be enough but he wants to hear from us soon worship his majesty unto jesus majesty kingdom authority flows from his throne unto his own his and stand as we sing this of jesus i

hear that you love him that you worship him because your voice speaks out the same how many appreciate that today you know you say well then i'm nothing yeah but he gave himself for you he considered you worth it all so amen we appreciate that so god bless you and be with you don't try to think of all the words but rather just live a life that would be pleasing something that would that would say
