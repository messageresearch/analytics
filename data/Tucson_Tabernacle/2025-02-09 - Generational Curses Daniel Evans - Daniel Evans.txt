you believe that I am able to do these things and then the man was healed so I ask you again do you believe that he is able do you believe he is amen he is I've seen it let's turn to Romans chapter 5 start with verse 12 a very very deep scripture Romans chapter 5 verse 12 starts like this wherefore as by one man CED sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned For unto the law for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come but not as the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense one of many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift by Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many off offenses unto justification for If by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life keep this next verse in your heart and in your mind as we continue on for as by one man's disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous Heavenly Father those words father give us the understanding of those words because I believe it affects every single person in this room today give us wisdom Lord in Jesus name amen you can be seated thank you God bless you all and good morning I want to say I'm really proud of uh Adam numer sister Jessica brother Dan that kid had a nasty break a nasty fall yesterday evening and uh yesterday afternoon late

well this is going to be I'm just going to relax brother Aaron this is going to be like a Wednesday night service we'll just we'll just go through these go through these scriptures um appreciate Daniel and Josiah's testimony earlier how they were they were really on on the same oh I forgot one she didn't raise her hand my little girl is in service with us this morning meline God bless you sweetheart sorry sweetie brother brother uh Brother David Hyde he was a pastor here in Tucson for a while he um I was out hunting with him one time he hit his head and he says he saids brother Daniel he says I'm blind in one eye and I can't see in the other sorry swee you're welcome welcome sweetie it's it's good to have my daughter in in the service today I was I was listening to Daniel and and Josiah talk back and forth and and Daniel was um talking with ji he's like dud dude wow that is so cool and Josiah's like bro yeah I'm like did they learn to talk that way because of me or do I talk that way because of them and it goes along perfect with my sermon this morning I usually don't name my sermons I just kind of I I Minister and then I'll name it after the service and um but this morning I I really felt LED on a subject earlier this week and it's on the subject of generational curses um it's something that is kind of going around lately and and as I was what gave me what kind of laid it on my heart is brother Paul Murray um with with our men's group he sent out a question believe it was earlier this week and he asked a question he said I I have a question I believe that everyone can answer and I'm gen genuinely curious about your feedback where's brother Paul there you are I'm genuinely curious about your feedback I'm asking each and every one of you to share what the top three most valuable lessons were that you learned from your dad and uh I read that and I said huh that's a really good question and people started responding and uh I was I was just pondering on that all week I was traveling this past week and and most of the comments about dads most of them were positive and um but a couple of the others alluded to bad examples that fathers have set before them and and it brought me back to a memory of a Time about maybe 10 years ago and I was telling Stephanie about it yesterday um and we were talking about how uh how the the word is so important in our lives and I was telling Stephanie the story that I'm I'm about to tell you all and she told me she said she said Dan she said the ABS absolute in in in our lives we should have this Bible as our absolute and you know I look at my Bible and it's even has the absolute written on the front of it and I said honey I said that's true to a certain extent and I said I have seen people influence on me that I have been close to I've seen people justify lying because it's in with this Bible I've seen people justify stealing from this Bible I've seen people justify polygamy in the Bible I've seen people justify adultery in the Bible wow so you have to when you read this Bible you can't just read it with ears with eyes that you want to further your own um agenda but you have to read this Bible in the Holy Spirit it was written as the Bible says by men of old how how they were led by the spirit to write these things and it says that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and good for Doctrine It Was Written in that way so when we read the Bible we must read it in the same spirit that it was given or else we can we will just use it to further our own sins so no the the Bible yes it is the absolute but just going and finding a scripture that agrees with the way that you think that is not the absolute you have to read this in the Holy Spirit and surrender yourself and then that absolute comes out I was praying about a scripture that I I really didn't quite get and I asked a pastor friend of mine even yesterday and I said hey have you ever considered this scripture with this Doctrine in mind talking with the brother last night for a long time he says you know I never I never thought about that and we went back and forth and he actually gave me another scripture that I had never thought about and we didn't get it resolved but I could see that both of us we genuinely wanted the answer and that's how we should read the Bible and it even Jeremy brother Jeremy's testimony um I don't know I don't know where brother Jeremy is but even brother Jeremy's testimony this morning that Daniel read he says with with regarding these scriptures he says I Ponder things on my heart may not understand them but I Ponder them on my heart and then he said and L let patience have her perfect work so when you're reading a scripture and you don't understand that scripture stop because it's important it's the word of God and if you don't understand what you're reading pause meditate on the word study other translations study other other stories in the Bible that you know about but don't just miss that blessing that God has for you or miss that correction that God has for you it is all important this book contains the very words of God himself so why would we want to read over something we don't understand that's what I'm here for that's what your family your dad your mom mom are here for those the deacons are here for that that's what we are here for is to try to help you understand not give our own interpretation of it but it help you to understand these things and most of all the Holy Spirit to help you understand with that in mind some time ago and thinking about Brother Paul's um note on WhatsApp and if you're not signed up for the men's WhatsApp group I I'd encourage you to to get signed up and talk to brother Paul um it brought back a memory that I have from I don't know maybe 10 years ago maybe maybe 10 to 15 years ago I'd say and I was praying about a scripture I didn't understand I was on my knees in the closet and I was really troubled by it and I'll read it to you it's the second commandment of the ten commands commments um Exodus 20 verse 4 Listen to this Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the Earth Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God we understand that part that part's not hard listen to this visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me all translations except for the more paraphrased versions all translations use that word hate the New Living Translation says the fourth generation of them that reject me so we all have and what it is is people all have their own way of thinking I don't think anyone knowingly hates God or rejects God I think that we do it on our own and we want our own way of thinking and when it's obviously against God's word then we can hate what the truth is and then we can just go to the Bible to try to justify what we're doing and he says visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children NIV says punishing the children for the sins of the parents NLT says I lay the sins of the parents upon their children I was praying about that in my closet I was sincere I said Lord I don't feel that that's fair I said look at look at the sins of of my family why do I am I punished for something that my dad did I was was on my knees and I was asking the Lord and then I quoted to the Lord and I knew this scripture because when I was going to prayer I was trying to compare this Exodus chapter 20 with e Ezekiel chapter 18 Ezekiel chapter 18 says this verse 20 the soul that sinth it shall die that soul that sins it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteous the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him so Ezekiel here is saying if you sin you will answer but your children are not responsible for your sin so as I on my knees and asking the Lord like Lord I don't understand over here in Exodus chapter 20 the second commandment it says that I will visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the children and then over here in Ezekiel it says that you're not going to Lord I don't understand and I went I was in prayer and I was genuinely seeking an answer this was important to me and then in the quietness of that room in deep prayer in the sincerity of my heart I wasn't trying to to get God to line up with my doctrines I was like Lord I don't I don't understand and in the quietness of the room there came the answer and it's a very simple sentence they are taught that way oh that makes sense so the if I sin Daniel's not responsible Daniel's not going to be punished for my sin but Daniel is going to see my sin as a dad and then if he repeats my sin then he is guilty because he did did it so I am guilty because I teach my child that Daniel doesn't have to answer for my sin but if he repeats what I do then he is guilty because according to Ezekiel he is the one that committed the the sin the the scripture is perfect and then seeing Brother Paul's email and on my mind were these generational curses that come down through the generations we teach our children our children teach their children all the way down and to see that that Generations suffer because the sins just keep going down and it's the same sin wow and it came to mind as I was praying and and thinking and meditating on on that question about about the dads mistakes that I'm seeing people making our church right now and they're making those mistakes because it is what their family has done for Generations their financial mistakes marital mistakes religious mistakes all because these mistakes run in their family in one form or another friend of mine who has troubles he's an old friend I'm talked to him a while but he's had troubles his whole life he's he's older than I am he's has troubles being a dad he's had trouble um being a husband there there's just he's at trouble in business there's been all these problems and then I just found out that his brother in the flesh was sawing was was running a a power saw and cut off his finger and his dad tells him after he cuts off his finger a young man his dad tells him my son despised not the chastening of the Lord thought wow with that harsh attitude and he had problems the dad had problems you see how those problems come right down through the family and then they repeat the the mistakes that their dad made when I when I when I talk about these things I I know that that uh it means it means a lot to me I don't want to see these I want to see these things stop these generational curses they need to stop and they can stop and I will get to how they stop as I as I go forward but I've also I've seen families I know of another family that there's such little love in that family and and i' I've seen it just through their generations and they were growing up and it was a very cold hard home to live in and the the grandfather was a pastor and he treated his his children very harshly and then their children then his children treated their children harshly and it just one thing after the other there then the grandchildren of this man completely left everything that that was important to the grandpa and became harsh critics of that and it's all because there was no love in that family wow and then they repeated the same thing to their children and then to their children to their children W I can look at my kids right now and I can see that I've made many mistakes but if there's anything that has held our family together it's because we had love we had dinner Stephanie would make dinner for us all together in the in the evenings and we would we would laugh and and we'd pray together and we'd have Bible study together and it was an every night thing and I remember when they were tiny babies they would come come up and sit on my lap because bedtime was the best time of the day because Dad was going to read stories it wasn't sticking a DVD in the television it was Dad reading those Bible stories and I to open that and we'd have the little Bible book reading to the kids and I'm sitting on my lap and and I was just loving it and and and they knew that when it was time starting time to get to to go to bed they knew it's like okay Daddy's going to quit here pretty soon soon and that little girl she was so quick I'd be reading and i' I'd get to the next story and that the story would coming to an end it would be Elijah or something and I'd always take the book and I'd do this and they knew that was in well Madeline and I tried to do it quick and she'd stick her fingerin in there and she'd say one more daddy one more and it was building this generational blessing of having these these kids together but the curses come down too I've seen churches people will have a real controlling real domineering Pastor real domineering Church families come out of this cultist church and then they go to another church and then they want that church to be like the one that they left and they start putting pressure on the pastor they start putting pressure on the people they're looking around do you see how these people are dressed do you see all the what these people are doing did you see this you just came out of that and you want to bring it here you want to bring that generational curse that has come down through there and now you want to bring it to this church no and then the other way too there's people that come in and they want to just they want no control at all they want no correction at all they want to come to church and then have a feel-good sermon and just live any way that they want to want to live that doesn't do any good either that's come down no we need to come here for correction Godly correction Lord I want to change I want to be different and there's no discipline they want to say there's they're Christians as long as Christ doesn't change their way of living and it's you get the same result you get a group that wants to be controlled and a group that wants no control at all and you end up with the same thing they go to church that allows both sides they want to go to a church that allows them to bypass their the Bible for their own desires both sides you want no correction no um Godly instruction at all over here or you want Total Control and you want a a a firm hand really neither is seeking the Holy Spirit neither is seeking God they're both seeking their own desires wow let me go back to Exodus 20 again I want to read that thou shalt not make unto thee any graven images or any likeness of anything that is in Heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the Earth Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and the fourth generation I said no one hates God but they hate the correction when the word comes and then they interpret the word to match their own doctrines and these are I'm talking about generational curses but if the Lord's willing and we can get there I will end with generational blessings that also come down so Brother Paul's question about our fathers I was meditating on this as uh during the week it really struck me you know brother Paul he had his own reason for writing it and he told me the other day he said dad he said he said brother Daniel he says it didn't have a dad and he says I just wanted to know what these other brothers what the these other brother said but then he told me he says but then the Lord has told me over and over again through the years I have been your father I have sent you these I have sent you father figures into your life and it bless me and that that's really how it is and then on Thursday I was um I called Zyra on a totally unrelated topic and I could tell her voice was a little shaky and and she sent the prayer request out last night and she um she told me she says I was um you know her and Brother Joseph just got married and they want to have a um a ceremony when they're a little bit more on their feet later on and she says I called my friend because I wanted to to be my maid of honor my best friend for ever long and she wouldn't answer the phone and she was texting her and and she wouldn't answer then finally she says hey I'm going to do a well welfare check on you I can't get in touch with you and her friend responds and she responds sorry I forgot the exact wording but she said that she said I'm just trying to break generational curses right sister Zara she said she talked about generational curses and then when I when I talked to Sister Zyra said what did you say it was the same thing that was on my mind for the for the whole week and these generational curses they come down they come down through the families and you can see many families are successful their parents were successful their grandparents were successful as far as monetary things and then other families you see they just struggle struggle struggle struggle because these things come down and they're taught that way but those those curses can stop I was driving here this morning and when we got on Stone I looked and there was a man walking down um opposite of traffic walking down on the sidewalk and I and I saw him and and I saw that he was probably a homeless man and I I looked at him and and I I saw he's been taught that way his whole life his dad was a drug addict his mom was a drug addict he comes from a generation of people that have done that type of thing what would of course you would expect him to be the same person and I looked at that I I said Lord I said do you want me to change my subject this morning I just I felt so bad and I said I would never want to hurt that man because I I know that been through so much that he's suffered because of his parents and now he is what he is because of a generational curse that came down I was I was ready to change and you know I got got in there and I prayed and felt like no just go forward those generational curses they come down but they can be broken in Psychology some of the the college students here and those that have been to college if you take psychology either 101 or or 2011 um they explain a phenomenon of nature versus nurture and nature is the way that you're born you have these two strands of DNA going down and it's got all of these different amino acids in it and everybody's are different and each each little piece of that DNA makes you who you are and each little piece of that DNA there there in that whole strand there are pieces in there that that give you a weakness for sin every one of us and it comes from as I read earlier it comes from Adam it comes from our father it comes from the first man and it goes down all the way and there are all these these different places where sin is and it makes us have weaknesses all of us have weaknesses and all of us have different weaknesses but we have the same weakness for sin there's um there's a gene I read this mc1r meline you should know this one it's the redheaded Jean and the two parents have to carry the genan Stephanie carries the Jean she has red hair in her family I carry the I have red hair in my family so Stephanie and I get together and we make a redheaded baby but if ju if just one person has that Gene then a redheaded baby can't can't be produced so you see that redheads are starting to get less and less and less because they used to be isolated in one part of Europe and everybody is redheaded so your your the wife that you married or the husband that you married was probably going to be redheaded so you're probably going to have redheaded CH children but when when the world started to spread it started to dilute that so you have to have two so if you marry somebody without that Gene you're not going to have a redheaded baby and that's how it is with us we all have genes you can't get out of it and those genes are simple I mean some sinful every one of us and it and we have to overcome that is the nature part the nurture part is what I just talked about it's how you are raised you're raised with strengths and you're raised with weaknesses your parents have strengths your parents have weaknesses grandparents all the way down you see many alcoholic children their parents were alcoholics not always but many times many divorced children their parents or grandparents parents went through that it comes down through not always but it comes down through back to Romans chapter 5 start with verse number 14 nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come so Adam was created Adam sin with his wife Eve in the Garden of Eden before before that they had eternal life that DNA strand was perfect there was no aging there was there was no problems they were perfect but somehow Satan injected that sin into that nature of a human being and the human genome just passed down those traits to Generations after them it was a generational curse that was manifested in many ways and is still manifesting itself in my life and in your life right here in Romans Paul is saying that the first Adam failed but there was coming a second Adam who was able to correct that generational curse but not as the offense so also is the free gift for though the for for if through the offense of one man many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift by Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many and not as it was by by one that sinned so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many is of many offenses un justification now here's what's going to make that clear remember Peter said I love the way that the brothers talked back then Peter in his epistle says he says hey he says listen I know Paul's hard to understand in some of the things that he writes but he said and those that are unstable wrestle with those things that Paul said as they do the other scriptures and there Peter is saying that Paul's writings are scripture even back 2,000 years ago where are we at verse number 17 for If by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men un justification of life so the sin of Adam in the Garden of Eden brought death because of the promise of God God promised if you do this you're going to die and there the human race was cursed if you eat this fruit metaphorically speaking if you eat this fruit in the garden you are rebelling against the Commandments of God and then you will die for as by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous the sin that was in that double helix can be removed D and it's when it will be removed when we receive our glorious bodies it'll be perfect the DNA will be perfect there'll be no aging it'll be just like it was in the Garden of Eden it'll be just wonderful and we'll have fellowship with God and these sins these generational curses curses that come down they're not our fault they're not your fault that you have a weakness that was passed along to you by your environment where you grew up and your bloodline it's not your fault meline was a a pediatric nurse for a while and one of the things with the babies that are abandoned or given up for adoption they got to hold the baby they got to give it love because if they don't give it Love at a very very young age that baby needs to be held against the bosom it needs to be it needs to be close and loved otherwise and this is a proven fact it will cause behavioral emotional emotional and social problems later in life a newborn they've got to be loved if they don't receive that they're going to have problems later on and they may pass on those problems look at the look at the changes in our own little church here with brother Jeremy sister Angela and those kids those kids foster kids wherever they end up they are forever changed because of the love that they've received from their parents and that the love that they've received from this church don't underestimate love it's the greatest Force love well the Bible says if you don't believe that I'll quote the Apostle John three three words God is love these generational curse are real let me give you a couple examples Abraham Isaac and Jacob we all know who they are Genesis 12 Abraham had a problem he did I know he was the father of Nations and he was he was a man that was a friend of gods he was a great man but he had a weakness listen to this Abraham chapter or um I'm sorry Genesis 12:9 and Abram journeyed going on still toward the South and there was a famine in the land and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there for the famine was Grievous in the land and it came to pass when he was come near uh to enter into Egypt that he said to Sarah his wife behold now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon she was good-looking therefore it shall come to pass when the Egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save you alive so I pray thee Thou Art my sister that was his half sister which was okay back then that was his half sister I pray thee that thou art my sister that it will be well with me I pray so I pray thee Thou Art my sister so tell them that you're my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee so he's saying Sarah lie and Abraham lied and it came to pass that when Abram was come into Egypt the Egyptians beheld the woman and she was very fair the princes of pharaoh also saw and commended her before pharaoh and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house and he entreated Abraham well for her sake and she had and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and men's servants and Maid servants and she asses and camels and the Lord plagued Pharaoh in his house with great plagues because of Sarah Abram's wife he didn't even know and he brought this woman because she's a she's a beautiful woman he brings her in and he's like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna marry this lady and Pharaoh called Abram and saidwhat is this that thou Hast done unto me why did you why didn't you tell me that she was your wife' why sayest thou that she is my sister so I might have taken her to to me to wife now therefore Behold thy wife take her and go away and Pharaoh commended his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had this is before Isaac his promised son was born Abraham was Barren his wife was Barren this is before Isaac was born now Isaac is born later on after this God gives him the promise Sarah gives birth to Isaac Isaac is born and then after and then after that Isaac grows up and he like his dad married a beautiful girl and he also married a girl that was Barren Abraham married a barren woman she couldn't have children Isaac married a Barren girl she couldn't have children Now watch how Isaac handles the same situation those generational weaknesses come down watch how Isaac handles the same situation Genesis 26 another famine in the land Isaac's dad's dead Abraham he's gone Isaac's wife's Barren she's getting old like Sarah was she's beautiful like Sarah was Isaac was desperate during the famine like Abraham was now look look what his son does look what Abraham's son does and Isaac went to G to gerar and the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say she is my wife lest said he the men of that place should kill me for Rebecca because she was fair to look upon Abraham lied his son Isaac I mean Abraham was long gone his son Isaac did the exact same thing how many times do we see our parents and we do the same thing I was just talking the other day with a couple young people here and talking about a friend and I knew this friend's parents and this and the the parents are the the the dad couldn't stand the way his dad was a major problem and then as time goes on this man has become his dad and has the same weaknesses the same outspoken the same dominating personality as his dad did that change that just went all the way through and you become your parents you don't have to you can take you know people say you have to take the good with the bad with the good I don't believe that I don't believe that at all you can take the good and get rid of the bad and that's with our parents I want you Daniel and meline to get rid of all the bad that you ever learned from Dad and just keep the good same thing happened with Judah so you have Abraham he lied Isaac he lied then Jacob he lied a lot it just came down and down and down he followed all the way through and then Jacob's son Judah he had another problem he had another weakness he had a weakness with women so his daughter-in his son died he was married to this girl and there there were some problems in the family so his daughter didn't really she didn't receive any inheritance his daughter-in-law she didn't receive any inh inheritance and she was having problems so she knew that her father-in-law had a weakness for women so she dresses up covers her face she dresses up as a prostitute why she knew that he was going to solicit her is because she knew that Judah had an issue she goes and she sits at the Gate of the city where the prostitute would sit Judah comes by she propositions him he she knows what he's going to do they they ended up having a relation there and then she leaves and he tries to cover it up he doesn't want anybody to know he was with a prostitute but obviously he'd done it before and then she comes back and she says Hey I was that prostitute you owe me and I've conceived a child and he was like watch how Judah reacted you're right you're a better person than I am the tribe of Judah on down we see somebody who is the most famous person other than the Lord Jesus from the tribe of Judah give me an answer David King David David with those same genetics with that same genome Pro genome problem there David was outside of his Palace the king he looks down and he sees a woman bathing that same Spirit manifested itself in David David goes up her names baath Sheba you know the story he goes He propositions her brings her in she conceived just like I know 700 years earlier Judah did shows that weakness then ends up having her husband killed then Nathan the prophet comes to David and he says hey this I'm want to tell you the story about this man stealing this this poor man this this rich man stealing this poor man's only lamb and this rich man had all kinds of lambs David said I'll kill that man Nathan the prophet said David you are that man man you sto this man uah's wife you know what David did exactly what Judah did he said I have sinned against the Lord he admitted it then David's son Solomon and all the women in involved in that Solomon had the same problem it came down through the line but it broke with the lion of the tribe of Judah Jesus Christ came and he took that sinful nature and Jesus made it to where that sinful nature can go away and be be gone and we have that ability as long as we accept that that nature of God if that nature will come in us then that sinful nature will go away you might always have a weakness there but you'll be able to overcome it then the lion of the tribe of Judah just go back to that Roman scripture Jesus made it to where that you don't have to sin he made it to where that you can be saved Adam made it to where that we all are lost Jesus came the second Adam and made it to where anyone that accepts him can be saved and those generational curses are destroyed where it says in Romans Again by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners but by one man's obedience many shall be made righteous not just they're forgiven the Gene's taken out the nature and the nurture are both removed and many shall be made righteous Paul is the one that wrote this Paul came years after Jesus did he didn't say that they were made righteous he said they shall be made righteous future tense talking about me talking about you and you may not be there yet but you have that opportunity to where you shall be made righteous if you accept Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins that's right you can be made righteous whatever your nature is whatever your DNA is it's not your fault it came from Adam came from the first one and it came all the way down but Jesus Christ the second Adam can make that right I'll close with a parable but you have that double helix you have that strand of DNA I'm not a doctor I have no idea but I mean I I I read an article last night um so I know more than a lot of you do but anyways um I'm a scientist I study water so I know about DNA I'm kidding that strand comes comes down everything about you is in that strand every weakness you have every strength that you have is in that DNA God is able to go in and pull that out so you teach your children you don't have to pass pass what your parents if they failed you don't have to pass on the bad you just pass on the good Matthew chapter 12 verse 43 when you pull something out there's a hole there and that hole needs to be filled Matthew 12:43 when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none then he saith I will return into my house from which I came out and when he is come he findeth it empty and swept and garnished then he goeth so what this is this is talking about an evil spirit it is talking about a generational curse and it's in you and then when you overcome that and Jesus Christ gives you strength to cast it out now there's a hole and you got to fill up that hole he saith I will return to my house the the demon talking I will return into my house living in one of these people I will return into my house from whence I came out and when he is come he findeth it empty and swept and garnished wow this is nice this is better than when I left this person gave his heart to the Lord and he swept out all the problems and everything this is great I'm going to go right back in because there's a hole there and now it's better than when I left the demon speaking and he goeth and he taketh himself and he's like ah there's room for all my friends to come in now it's not just one problem that you have maybe it's drinking maybe it's a temper maybe it was gossip it wasn't just one problem that it has now now I'm going to come back in with my original problems and I'm G to fill you I'm going to fill it up with all my friends then he goeth and he taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter and dwell in there and the last state of the man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation when the house is cleaned out that void needs to be filled you may be delivered you may come to the Altar and say Lord you delivered me you delivered me from my lying you delivered me from my temper you delivered me from whatever it is but now you have to fill that hole what fills the hole yes say it louder Jesus Christ fills that hole in the form of the Holy Spirit and then nothing can get in there by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners but by one man's obedience many shall be made righteous you can't change the Bible you can try to explain it but the doctrines won't work take it the way it says take it take this scripture don't throw it out because it doesn't match your Doctrine look at this generational blessing and I'll close with this we had all the generational curses in all of us listen if you don't see a generational curse in your life maybe you're living in that generational curse maybe you're acting out in that generational curse because you can't see it you can see everybody else's problems but maybe you can't see your own I don't feel necessarily that's the way it is with people in here but all of us have them but listen to this generational blessing second Timothy chapter 1 verse three the Apostle Paul again Paul and Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus to Timothy my dearly beloved Son grace mercy and peace from God the father in Christ Jesus our lord I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers which pure with a with pure conscience that without ceasing I have made remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly Desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I that I may be filled with joy Paul dearly loves this young man Timothy he says it's his son so I assume Tim Paul is the one that led him to the Lord verse number five when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Unice and I am persuaded that is in thee also a generational blessing that came down right here wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting out of my hands you have this gift from God it's in your genetics it's it's the way you were raised you have this because of your grandmother and you have it because of your mom now you have it Timothy what are you going to do with it take the good and throw out the bad move forward Timothy the generational curse that was brought through the Garden of Eden can be overcome with generational blessings through Jesus Christ and you see it listen think about it we see it I don't want to go to church I don't have to go to church I bet your dad said the same thing I bet you his dad his dad's dad said the same thing well the fighting that you have with your wife or with your husband you fight you you you battle and you your your children watch that I'll bet you your parents fought too and argued the generational curse can end according to Romans it was promised that it can end I think about that that Lois and Eunice and Timothy I think about my grandmother wave a Wheeler she's watching right now I assume Grandma you down to my mother meline and then down to Daniel Evans me that that Grace that gift that you showed just as Paul here is saying to Timothy the grandmother waa the mother meline on down to the Sun and I'm I am passing that on to both of my children the generational blessings just as it says here in the Bible and the generational curses brothers and sisters the generation ational curses did not start with you but they can end with you think about that the generational curses that I have that came through my my family that that went all the way up it ends with me I saw many times I saw the the gossip and the fighting and the family and all that you know what it ends with me that curse I'm done with it and I have been for a long time I remember a young man seeing the problems and saying I will not do that that curse ends with this guy I'm done with it same thing with the churches the churches want they they want to have they want to have control and they want to be they want to be dominating they want there's certain ones and then there's other ones that as I said earlier they don't want any control that ends that can end because it divides people and nothing ever comes of it Make It Stop end it and it can end with you musicians come it will end this generational curses these curses that were on me they end right here and may the ones that are in each one of you end with you they didn't start with you but they can end with you no none of these as I said none of these are your fault Romans Chapter 5 Verse 18 therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life for as by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be be made righteous self-righteousness it ends here Pride it ends here judgmental attitude it ends here lack of humility it ends here a religious spirit dominating religious spirit it ends here weakness for money ends here weakness for gossip it ends here a lack of wisdom it ends if you lack Wisdom ask and it shall be given to you chronic money problems it ends a slothful spirit a lack of zeal it can end you understand fear fear it can end am it is fear can end if you're afraid you're afraid of somebody saying something about you you're afraid of being judged you're afraid of saying the wrong things you're afraid of taking the wrong job you're afraid of this you're afraid of that you're afraid of what the church is going to think if you do something fear can end and let it end let it end with you don't let it keep going it can end and it ends when that problem is cast out and then the Holy Spirit replaces it Daniel and was a WR I remember who I was I was lost I was blind I was running out of time and sin separated the breach was far too wide but From The Far Side of the chasm you held me in in your side so you made a way across the Great Divine Left Behind Heaven's Throne to build it here

thank you Jesus you have saved my life and brought me from the darkness into glorious [Applause] life and you took my place laid inside my tomb l s you were buried for 3 days but then you walked right

this church as a young man and uh Stephanie I were dating I don't know if we're engaged and I remember criticizing because they didn't sing the same songs that I sang in my church and looking down on the church because because of the songs that they sang that Spirit ends with me I'm not passing that on that judgmental hateful Spirit it ends with me and all of you let those things let those generational curses let them end with you let's all stand what wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus and what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus and what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus in what can make me whole again oh nothing but the blood of [Music] Jesus and oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow no other found I know nothing but

generational curses that have come may have skipped Generations I mean you see with Judah all the way down to David like 700 years those things don't go away but when the lion of the tribe of Judah came they were they were they were stricken to death mortally wounded they may still be alive but they are mortally wounded and one day all of those problems in our DNA are going to be replaced one day all of those weakness that we have they're going to be replaced by strengths those generational curses that have come down it's going to be replaced by nothing but generational blessings we thank God for the blessings that we have and we overcome the curses let's bow our heads I always want to give a opportunity for [Music] someone that if there's something in your life that you that Satan has
