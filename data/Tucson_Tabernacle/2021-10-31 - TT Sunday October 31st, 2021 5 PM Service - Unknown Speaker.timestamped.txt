[41:19] it's good to be
[41:20] back in the house of the lord with you i
[41:22] thank you all for coming
[41:25] and especially you young people good to
[41:27] see some young people in the house of
[41:29] the lord on this night
[41:32] and i know it's tempting to go out and
[41:35] grab as much candy as you can grab
[41:38] and maybe when you go home this evening
[41:41] you can run over to your neighbor's
[41:42] house and
[41:43] tell them you're dressed as a christian
[41:47] and see what uh what they've got left
[41:49] over
[41:51] amen
[41:54] yeah yeah i say tell them the preacher
[41:56] told you
[41:57] to do it
[41:59] i uh
[42:01] felt like i had a lot of pressure on me
[42:04] today with uh brother
[42:06] guerra
[42:08] saying that
[42:10] the minister was gonna
[42:12] pick his thoughts and preach on the
[42:15] thoughts that he had i thought oh lord
[42:17] i don't have that gift i don't have that
[42:19] ability
[42:20] and he let me know that i didn't do it
[42:23] so
[42:25] i it lets me know that i am certainly
[42:29] don't have that gift and i just have to
[42:32] be humbled
[42:33] and
[42:34] you'll have to bear with what the lord
[42:36] has
[42:37] provided
[42:40] this evening if our brothers could
[42:43] pull up we're gonna
[42:45] go through some slides
[42:48] and maybe have a little bit of a
[42:50] visual i'm a very visual person
[42:53] or maybe i guess i should say i've got
[42:55] quite an imagination
[42:57] and so in my imagination i um
[43:01] i like to when i read the word of god
[43:04] and when i think about the things of god
[43:07] uh sometimes i'll
[43:09] i'll spend quite a bit of time um
[43:13] painting myself into the drama
[43:16] and um i don't know if there's if if i i
[43:20] i'm certain that not everybody's like
[43:23] that
[43:24] certainly not everybody's like me thank
[43:26] the lord
[43:27] um
[43:28] but tonight i wanted to minister on
[43:32] becoming as children and i thought this
[43:35] is good for the young people but it's
[43:37] also good for the older ones as well
[43:39] and so i i pray that the lord will
[43:42] bless you through this if you have your
[43:44] bibles
[43:45] you'd like to turn over into matthew the
[43:48] 18th chapter this is where we'll be
[43:50] drawing our our text
[43:52] from and this image i love this image
[43:57] that i found
[44:00] this is when
[44:01] jesus is
[44:05] explaining to his disciples suffered the
[44:07] little children to come unto me and
[44:09] forbid them not
[44:11] and
[44:12] i really like this fellow right back
[44:14] here
[44:15] is hidden
[44:17] and i just
[44:18] the comfort that you see of the children
[44:21] looking to jesus
[44:23] with the eyes of it's okay right it's
[44:26] okay that we're here
[44:28] um
[44:29] with a little bit of a debate and that
[44:31] guy hidden right in the back there tells
[44:34] me
[44:35] that he's saying
[44:36] i want to sneak into this myself i want
[44:39] to get in on this
[44:41] and i trust that that's
[44:43] how we feel
[44:45] tonight
[44:46] that
[44:47] you say lord
[44:48] if you come by tonight don't pass me by
[44:52] if you're going to touch someone you're
[44:54] going to bless somebody
[44:55] lord don't forget me let me let me get
[44:58] in on some of that too
[45:01] so in matthew chapter 18
[45:04] we'll read verses 1 through 6 and i have
[45:06] it
[45:07] here printed so that you can
[45:09] read it as well at the same time came
[45:12] the disciples unto jesus saying
[45:14] who
[45:18] yes who is the greatest in the kingdom
[45:20] of heaven and jesus called a little
[45:23] child unto him and set him in the midst
[45:25] of them and said verily i say unto you
[45:29] except ye be converted and become as
[45:31] little children you shall not enter into
[45:34] the kingdom of heaven
[45:37] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[45:39] as this little child
[45:41] the same is greatest in the kingdom of
[45:44] heaven and whoso shall receive one such
[45:48] little child in my name receiveth me
[45:52] but whoso shall offend one of these
[45:54] little ones which believe in me
[45:57] it were better for him that a millstone
[46:00] were hanged about his neck
[46:02] and that he were drowned in the depth of
[46:04] the sea
[46:06] amen let's just bow our heads
[46:10] for a word of prayer our precious
[46:11] heavenly father
[46:13] lord we read these words and
[46:16] god
[46:17] it causes us
[46:19] each one within our own hearts
[46:21] to say oh lord
[46:24] i want to become like that i i don't
[46:26] want to miss it lord i don't want to
[46:28] miss it
[46:30] i don't want to be
[46:31] too big
[46:32] that i can't receive you as a child
[46:35] would receive something from their own
[46:38] parents
[46:39] but lord
[46:41] we want to receive the good things that
[46:43] you have for us in your word
[46:45] that lord would help us
[46:47] to
[46:50] to look into the mirror of your word and
[46:53] to examine ourselves and lord where we
[46:56] come short we want to say forgive us
[46:59] would you take those things away from us
[47:02] lord so that
[47:03] our image would bear the very image
[47:06] of your son jesus christ
[47:08] lord this is our desire not just
[47:12] we don't want to just look the part but
[47:15] lord we want to be every bit
[47:19] lord the child
[47:20] that you desire
[47:23] granted heavenly father we pray you just
[47:25] be with us this evening be with all
[47:27] those lord that are out

[47:31] and children pray you be merciful god
[47:34] and watch over

[47:38] we would ask that you would just come

[47:48] lord that we could feast tonight we ask
[47:51] it in jesus christ's name amen
[47:54] thank god bless you can be seated
[47:58] i was
[48:00] telling
[48:02] our young sister
[48:03] guerra
[48:04] this afternoon as brother we were
[48:07] enjoying uh a wonderful cup of latte
[48:10] from brother lyle who's a tremendous
[48:14] barista if if you ever care to know that
[48:17] and i don't know if he ever wanted to
[48:19] let that that secret out but
[48:21] um
[48:24] we were talking about
[48:26] she had asked me
[48:27] are you okay coming out and
[48:29] fellowshipping like this or would you do
[48:32] you need your naps on sunday and
[48:35] i said well we do enjoy our sunday
[48:37] afternoon naps i said but i don't always
[48:39] get one and i said but i'll tell you
[48:41] these lattes help you know when you
[48:43] don't get your nap and
[48:45] i said but i i do
[48:47] feel that sometimes after i've after i
[48:50] have stayed up
[48:52] and
[48:55] not gotten a nap and i drink coffee to
[48:58] keep myself alert and awake
[49:02] if then i go minister in evening service
[49:05] and anybody comes up to me after the
[49:07] service and says wow i really enjoyed
[49:10] that service it was very good
[49:12] i'm always
[49:14] somewhat hesitant and a little bit leery
[49:17] to know
[49:18] lord was was that was i following
[49:21] the inspiration of the spirit or was
[49:23] that just the latte
[49:26] was that the inspiration of the caffeine
[49:28] that was bringing me along and i
[49:31] i uh
[49:33] i trust that tonight
[49:35] it will be the spirit of god that will
[49:38] be moving
[49:40] that would speak to us and
[49:42] as we discussed this subject becoming as
[49:46] children
[49:48] i say this because perhaps there's
[49:50] somebody who
[49:51] who
[49:54] has never gone through this
[49:56] subject and they've never had anybody
[49:59] walk them through the scripture
[50:02] through some of these scriptures
[50:05] like we see
[50:07] these here where jesus is saying except
[50:10] ye be converted and become as little
[50:13] children
[50:16] so many times maybe we would think what
[50:18] does that mean exactly to become as
[50:21] little children we're grown adults and
[50:24] jesus knows this jesus knows that
[50:26] that that the people that are coming and
[50:30] and and and and
[50:33] even those that that have even the
[50:36] desire who have had an experience in
[50:38] life or or or have a desire to know god
[50:42] and who have had a hard life long enough
[50:46] to know
[50:47] that
[50:48] surely this can't be everything there is
[50:50] to life and this can't just be the
[50:53] purpose of life is to just wander along
[50:56] like this there's something bigger
[50:57] usually those are adults that have those
[51:00] thoughts or certainly
[51:02] once you're
[51:03] above about
[51:05] or
[51:06] older than that age of accountability
[51:10] and so
[51:12] it's good for us to examine these
[51:14] scriptures as jesus said search the
[51:16] scripture for in them you think you have
[51:18] eternal life and they are they that
[51:19] testify of me so it's good for us
[51:22] to to search these things out
[51:26] and
[51:28] we read this and
[51:30] over in luke
[51:32] chapter 18 very similar scripture
[51:34] verse 17 says verily i say unto you
[51:37] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[51:40] of god as a little child
[51:42] shall in no wise enter therein
[51:48] and
[51:48] these are scriptures referring to
[51:53] uh
[51:55] becoming like children
[51:57] and and there's many scriptures and and
[51:59] we're gonna go through some of them
[52:01] that
[52:03] that you will
[52:04] you will recognize
[52:06] but i'm
[52:07] we look here at saint john chapter 3
[52:12] and i'll i'll read this portion for you
[52:15] uh you can turn there if you'd like st
[52:16] john chapter 3 but
[52:18] we find that nicodemus
[52:20] comes to jesus in the night
[52:23] and
[52:24] he says how can a man
[52:27] well excuse me it
[52:34] he came to jesus by night and said unto
[52:36] him rabbi we know that thou art a
[52:38] teacher come from god for no man can do
[52:40] these miracles that thou doest except
[52:42] god be with him jesus answered and said
[52:44] unto him verily verily which is
[52:47] absolutely absolutely okay so absolutely
[52:51] i say unto you this is an absolute
[52:55] except a man be born again
[52:59] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[53:02] now that is quite a statement
[53:06] no explanation just
[53:08] accept a man be born again never heard
[53:10] that term before perhaps this
[53:13] and here jesus says accept a man be born
[53:16] again
[53:19] now nicodemus being a man and and and
[53:22] and
[53:23] never i i guess not used to
[53:26] the supernatural not used to
[53:29] the word of god coming in parables
[53:33] he immediately says
[53:36] what does that mean
[53:38] how can a man be born
[53:41] again
[53:42] we're only born once
[53:44] and he asks jesus this he asks him
[53:48] is a man to go back
[53:50] you know and and go back into the womb
[53:52] of his mother and then and then come
[53:54] come again and jesus says you
[53:57] you're thinking so carnal
[54:00] you're just thinking
[54:04] he says
[54:05] i say unto you except a man be born of
[54:07] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[54:11] into the kingdom of god
[54:13] and so this idea
[54:16] of
[54:17] jesus is explaining to him that except a
[54:20] man be born of water and of the spirit
[54:25] he's expressing to a man not just being
[54:28] born into the world
[54:30] but there's a different kind of a birth
[54:33] that's got to take place
[54:35] it's a spiritual birth a birth of the
[54:39] spirit
[54:42] i'm going to move this
[54:44] just for the sake of because i want i'm
[54:46] drawn to it and i don't realize that the
[54:48] mic is on me
[54:51] and so
[54:52] he's explaining to
[54:55] nicodemus what that
[54:57] is meaning and through his ministry he
[55:00] then is expressing and explaining to all
[55:03] those around even his disciples about
[55:06] this new birth that's to take place
[55:11] and and he's talking about how that john
[55:13] has come and he's preparing the way for
[55:16] something new for a new way that we are
[55:19] on the brink of a new
[55:24] type of relationship with god
[55:29] and he's trying to
[55:30] to to lay the foundation work while
[55:34] walking with his disciples and teaching
[55:38] them
[55:39] that i'm with you now here in body form
[55:43] but one day i'll be with you in a
[55:46] greater way than this
[55:49] i'll be with you in saint john chapter
[55:51] 14 we find him saying i'll be with you
[55:55] even
[55:56] in you
[55:57] to the end of the world
[55:59] so now they're having to
[56:02] to to really stretch their minds to
[56:06] stretch
[56:07] and to to open up their hearts to say
[56:10] what exactly is he saying and he's
[56:14] talking about the new birth and even
[56:17] today
[56:18] this idea
[56:20] began
[56:21] to
[56:24] to elude men
[56:27] even people in church people who'd
[56:29] studied the bible
[56:32] and so
[56:34] some said the new birth is this and some
[56:37] said the new birth is this and some said
[56:39] that the evidence of it was this and
[56:41] some said the evidence of it was this
[56:44] and in the church age book
[56:47] through the pages 144 through 154
[56:50] brother branham takes this subject
[56:54] and he and he starts to go through it
[56:56] and he gives us multiple multiple things
[56:59] and any and he says things like this my
[57:02] pentecostal friends
[57:04] believe
[57:05] that when i call
[57:07] make an altar call and call for somebody
[57:11] to come
[57:12] and be born again
[57:15] or to receive the holy ghost
[57:18] they think that i'm calling to somebody
[57:21] who's already
[57:23] what they would
[57:24] were calling have been born again
[57:28] to come up and receive the baptism of
[57:31] the holy ghost
[57:33] brother branham has said that's not what
[57:36] i'm saying at all
[57:38] i'm i am saying
[57:41] i want
[57:42] them to come
[57:44] and receive the baptism the sinner
[57:48] the
[57:49] those that had already walked in the way
[57:51] everybody to hear the word faith cometh
[57:55] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[57:57] god
[57:58] to hear the word of god
[58:00] to
[58:02] that that justification that that
[58:04] sanctification and that that baptism
[58:08] could all take place
[58:11] right there
[58:13] and so
[58:14] brother branham says
[58:16] several things and you can find this in
[58:18] your church age book
[58:20] in other words to be born of the spirit
[58:23] is to be truly baptized with the holy
[58:27] ghost
[58:28] it is one and the same
[58:33] to receive his spirit is to be born
[58:38] again
[58:39] to receive his spirit
[58:42] is to be baptized with the holy ghost
[58:46] amen
[58:48] what is the baptism with the holy ghost
[58:51] it is the spirit baptizing you into the
[58:54] body of christ it is the new birth
[58:59] thus we are not
[59:02] born again by the spirit of life of
[59:04] jesus coming in and then subsequent to
[59:08] that the holy spirit coming in to give
[59:11] us power
[59:13] in verse 23 now he's talking about saint
[59:15] john chapter 14 verse 23 in speaking to
[59:18] the disciples he said we
[59:21] father and son
[59:23] will come unto him
[59:25] unto a person unto a man seeking
[59:28] thus it is the father son and holy ghost
[59:31] all coming in at the one time for it is
[59:35] one person comprising the godhead
[59:39] that advent took place at pentecost
[59:42] there aren't two comings of the spirit
[59:46] just one
[59:49] so when we see this when we read this
[59:52] when we hear this when we begin to
[59:54] search out and see that jesus wasn't
[59:58] speaking
[59:59] of i'll come to you
[1:00:02] and do one thing for you and then later
[1:00:04] i'm going to come again he's expressing
[1:00:07] to his disciples
[1:00:09] i want to take you all the way into this
[1:00:13] baptism i want to fill you with my
[1:00:17] spirit
[1:00:24] and this is to be born again
[1:00:28] or as you will hear it many times
[1:00:31] amongst the believers amongst people in
[1:00:33] church saying
[1:00:34] it's to receive the baptism of the holy
[1:00:38] ghost or the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:00:43] you say brother this is we've heard this
[1:00:45] for years but perhaps there's somebody
[1:00:47] who hasn't
[1:00:51] they'd like to be walked through those
[1:00:53] scriptures to say where's the foundation
[1:00:56] for this
[1:00:58] it's there
[1:01:01] now we read malachi 4
[1:01:04] verse 5 and 6 and it says behold i'll
[1:01:07] send unto you elijah the prophet before
[1:01:09] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[1:01:11] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:01:13] children to the father fathers to the
[1:01:15] children
[1:01:16] lest i come smite the earth with a curse
[1:01:19] but notice
[1:01:21] and i do this for our young people i do
[1:01:24] this for our youth
[1:01:26] we recognize in scripture
[1:01:31] the spirit of elijah
[1:01:34] five times
[1:01:36] five times so we see
[1:01:39] we see the man elijah
[1:01:42] he he was he was a hairy man and he wore
[1:01:46] camels skins and ate locusts and honey
[1:01:49] he was a real wilderness man we see him
[1:01:54] a hairy man wilderness man and we see
[1:01:57] the call on his life we see him a
[1:02:00] prophet of god and we see these miracles
[1:02:03] taking place in his life
[1:02:05] and then we see as he as the lord is
[1:02:07] calling him to phase off the scene
[1:02:10] elijah
[1:02:11] the lord tells him go find elisha
[1:02:15] now elisha was a bald-headed man
[1:02:17] remember the children made fun of him
[1:02:19] and
[1:02:20] she bears came out and ate the children
[1:02:22] because they were making fun of his bald
[1:02:23] head elisha was a bald-headed man
[1:02:26] and elisha had asked elijah elijah said
[1:02:29] before i go what would you like
[1:02:31] of me and he says i would like a double
[1:02:34] portion of your spirit to come upon me
[1:02:37] elijah said you've asked a hard thing
[1:02:39] nonetheless if you see me when i go you
[1:02:42] can have this
[1:02:43] and so we see that when elijah is caught
[1:02:47] up away in this chariot of fire his
[1:02:50] mantle
[1:02:51] goes down elisha picks up his mantle and
[1:02:54] he must die it down in order to fit
[1:02:56] elijah's
[1:02:58] elijah's mantle
[1:03:00] and we see the spirit of elijah then on
[1:03:05] elisha
[1:03:07] and not only a double uh
[1:03:10] this double portion he did with what is
[1:03:13] recorded in the bibles we see four
[1:03:15] miracles recorded of elijah
[1:03:18] we see eight miracles recorded of elisha
[1:03:21] double portion
[1:03:26] so here we've got two examples of elijah
[1:03:29] and elijah but but the spirit of elijah
[1:03:31] two of them
[1:03:33] now the third
[1:03:35] we will pick up
[1:03:38] here in
[1:03:39] in
[1:03:40] well let's just read here
[1:03:42] malachi 4 5-6 behold i will send you
[1:03:44] elijah and he shall turn the heart of
[1:03:47] the fathers to the children
[1:03:50] and i put there
[1:03:51] the third
[1:03:54] that'll be that third
[1:03:58] showing of the spirit of elijah
[1:04:01] and
[1:04:02] the heart of the children to the fathers
[1:04:05] that will be the fourth
[1:04:07] time we see the spirit of elijah
[1:04:11] to the church
[1:04:13] now in luke chapter 1 and verse 17 it's
[1:04:16] speaking about the birth of john the
[1:04:18] baptist
[1:04:19] and is speaking about his birth
[1:04:21] and his scripture records and he john
[1:04:25] shall go before him this is this is the
[1:04:28] the angel talking to his father
[1:04:31] zacharias
[1:04:32] and he john shall go before him in the
[1:04:36] spirit go go before the the lord go
[1:04:39] before the messiah
[1:04:40] in the spirit and power of elijah elias
[1:04:44] is elijah
[1:04:45] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:04:48] children
[1:04:51] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:04:53] just to make ready a people prepared for
[1:04:56] the lord you'll notice in that scripture
[1:04:58] it's it says he will turn the hearts of
[1:05:00] the fathers to the children but it
[1:05:02] doesn't mention turning the hearts of
[1:05:04] the children to the fathers
[1:05:06] that wasn't for john
[1:05:08] that was for another appearing of elijah
[1:05:14] so now in matthew chapter 17
[1:05:18] verses 10 through 13 and his disciples
[1:05:20] asked him saying why then say the
[1:05:23] scribes that elias or elijah must first
[1:05:26] come
[1:05:28] and jesus answered and said unto them
[1:05:30] elijah elias truly shall
[1:05:33] first come
[1:05:36] and restore all things
[1:05:40] so
[1:05:41] now we see that couldn't have been john
[1:05:46] that he's speaking of
[1:05:48] john didn't restore all things
[1:05:50] this restoring of all things was
[1:05:52] something that was to take place in
[1:05:54] future in the future
[1:05:58] from when jesus was speaking
[1:06:00] but i say unto you that elias or elijah
[1:06:03] is come already
[1:06:06] he has come already
[1:06:08] that spirit has come already and they
[1:06:10] knew him not but have done unto him
[1:06:13] whatsoever they listed likewise shall
[1:06:15] also the son of man suffer of of them
[1:06:19] then the disciples
[1:06:21] then the disciples understood that he
[1:06:24] spake unto them of john the baptist
[1:06:27] so
[1:06:28] when he's saying that they've already
[1:06:30] done unto him whatever whatsoever they
[1:06:32] listed they took john they they cut his
[1:06:35] head off
[1:06:37] they took him
[1:06:39] and so then they recognize oh
[1:06:42] that was john
[1:06:45] john is the one
[1:06:46] that has the spirit of elijah on him
[1:06:52] it's good
[1:06:53] it's good they were recognizing prophecy
[1:06:56] they were recognizing the word of god in
[1:06:59] their day
[1:07:01] and and
[1:07:02] and so have we in this day and age
[1:07:06] recognized
[1:07:07] god sent in elijah in this day
[1:07:12] and
[1:07:13] his job was not to turn the hearts of
[1:07:16] the fathers to the children in our day
[1:07:19] but his job was to turn the hearts
[1:07:22] of the children those who have been born
[1:07:26] again those
[1:07:28] who who have become children
[1:07:31] those who have become like babies who
[1:07:34] have been born again
[1:07:36] he is his job was to turn the hearts of
[1:07:40] those type of people
[1:07:42] back to the faith
[1:07:44] of our fathers peter james john
[1:07:48] moses elijah
[1:07:50] abraham isaac jacob
[1:07:53] our hearts are being turned back to the
[1:07:56] original word of god like it was in the
[1:07:59] beginning not believing in three gods
[1:08:02] not believing in two gods but believing
[1:08:04] that there's one true living god and
[1:08:07] that he has come and he he even has a
[1:08:10] name and he's got a person and it was
[1:08:13] the person of jesus christ
[1:08:18] so this is
[1:08:20] part of becoming
[1:08:22] like children again
[1:08:24] this is part of receiving that kingdom
[1:08:27] is being able to receive the word of god
[1:08:30] as children again
[1:08:36] so i i split this picture into three
[1:08:40] parts
[1:08:42] and on this upper right hand part this
[1:08:45] is a child in the womb
[1:08:47] before the child is born
[1:08:51] the prophet of god speaks about this
[1:08:53] situation and how that the child is warm
[1:08:57] it's in a warm comfortable place it's
[1:08:59] protected
[1:09:01] doesn't know about the harshness of the
[1:09:03] world and its environments
[1:09:06] doesn't know about that it knows comfort
[1:09:13] it knows
[1:09:14] its mother's heartbeat
[1:09:18] feels the comfort of that it's const
[1:09:21] it's in a constant temperature
[1:09:23] all the time
[1:09:25] no
[1:09:26] it's too cold it's too hot it's a
[1:09:28] constant temperature all the time
[1:09:31] very nice
[1:09:32] many of us are going oh
[1:09:34] to be a child
[1:09:36] oh
[1:09:37] the child only knew
[1:09:40] but brother branham addresses that
[1:09:42] and he says okay
[1:09:48] would you go back to that
[1:09:50] if you had the chance
[1:09:52] would you go back to that
[1:09:55] you'd never know
[1:09:58] what life has got you'd never know
[1:10:02] the grand things that are outside of the
[1:10:04] womb you'd never know
[1:10:06] how big the world is
[1:10:09] you'd never know the things that are in
[1:10:11] store
[1:10:12] you'd be so limited
[1:10:14] you'd be so limited
[1:10:19] and then a child is born and it's like
[1:10:22] this
[1:10:24] here you are standing on the edge of a
[1:10:26] precipice
[1:10:28] and there's the world
[1:10:32] and you're right on that edge
[1:10:35] and when you're born again
[1:10:38] that's what it's like
[1:10:40] you've come to a point in your life
[1:10:44] that you're at the edge and the next
[1:10:46] step
[1:10:49] is a free fall
[1:10:54] and before i get to this
[1:10:58] i want to read for you this scripture
[1:11:00] romans 6 4 speaking about the newness of
[1:11:03] life therefore
[1:11:06] we are buried with him
[1:11:08] jesus by baptism into death
[1:11:11] that like as christ was raised up from
[1:11:14] the dead by the glory of the father
[1:11:17] even
[1:11:18] so we also should walk
[1:11:21] in newness of life
[1:11:25] the newness
[1:11:27] that comes with life
[1:11:29] the newness
[1:11:31] of being
[1:11:33] born again
[1:11:34] i go back to this picture here
[1:11:37] and many of you who've had children or
[1:11:40] have been around babies maybe you're a
[1:11:42] big sister big brother or perhaps you
[1:11:44] babysit
[1:11:46] have you ever seen that look before
[1:11:50] and i'll tell you if you ever want to
[1:11:52] evoke that look there's one sure way of
[1:11:55] doing it
[1:11:56] it's a game called peek-a-boo
[1:12:00] and peek-a-boo is a such an incredible
[1:12:03] game
[1:12:04] because
[1:12:05] for the first time if you ever do it to
[1:12:08] a child
[1:12:09] you
[1:12:10] it doesn't
[1:12:11] typically end in laughter or giggles but
[1:12:15] oftentimes it starts with crying
[1:12:18] and the reason is because the
[1:12:21] we as human beings have some are very
[1:12:23] unique we can actually tell if
[1:12:26] somebody's looking our direction or not
[1:12:28] because we've got these whites around
[1:12:30] our our pupils and around our irises the
[1:12:33] white part of our eyes and so we're very
[1:12:35] keen on being able to tell even at great
[1:12:38] distances whether somebody's looking our
[1:12:40] way or not well a baby
[1:12:43] it's vision isn't really too good for
[1:12:45] its the first few months that it's born
[1:12:47] anyway but when you get real close to it
[1:12:50] it'll be fixated on your face trying to
[1:12:53] figure out what it is what's amazing is
[1:12:56] you it's like you cover your face with
[1:12:58] your hands
[1:12:59] and it's like you went away
[1:13:01] you just
[1:13:02] disappeared but as soon as you pull
[1:13:05] those hands away real fast and you say
[1:13:07] peek-a-boo to the baby
[1:13:09] it's like they've seen you for the first
[1:13:12] time in their life
[1:13:14] and then you cover your face again and
[1:13:16] it's like you went away and you never
[1:13:18] existed again
[1:13:19] but then you pull your hands away and
[1:13:22] suddenly there you are and all your
[1:13:24] splendor and glory in front of this
[1:13:27] little child and
[1:13:28] before you know it this game is probably
[1:13:31] more
[1:13:32] more thrilling for the adult than it is
[1:13:34] the child because we love to hear the
[1:13:36] giggle that comes along with it
[1:13:39] in that excited little
[1:13:42] it's a little chipmunk chatter thing
[1:13:45] that happens and you just love that and
[1:13:47] so then you do it again they like
[1:13:50] it's this little chipmunk laugh
[1:13:53] and you've got man that's good he loves
[1:13:55] it he's like well you're loving it
[1:13:57] probably more but
[1:13:58] but they that look is
[1:14:01] it's all new again
[1:14:03] you're new to them all over again
[1:14:09] and i say that
[1:14:11] for this sake
[1:14:15] we should walk in newness of life
[1:14:21] and i want to say this for the children
[1:14:34] i don't know how many of you like riding
[1:14:35] roller coasters
[1:14:38] or going in fast cars or
[1:14:41] something where it's really kind of
[1:14:43] on edge some people really don't like it
[1:14:46] and those that like it they kind of they
[1:14:48] like that that that moment
[1:14:51] where it's right on the edge
[1:14:54] i was a bit of a thrill seeker and i
[1:14:56] loved to do those things and i thought
[1:14:58] let you know you can't and i probably
[1:15:00] have shared this here before but
[1:15:03] i thought
[1:15:04] life you know i want to live life to the
[1:15:06] fullest i want to i want to
[1:15:08] ride the most exciting ride there is to
[1:15:10] ride i want to i want to see i want to
[1:15:13] do the things that are the most
[1:15:14] thrilling things to do in life while
[1:15:16] i've got it
[1:15:21] and i
[1:15:26] i don't know i grew up in church i grew
[1:15:28] up on the pews sleeping under the pews
[1:15:32] sitting on the pews and things
[1:15:35] and
[1:15:38] i don't know i guess you you kind of see
[1:15:41] church as a tradition you see it as a
[1:15:43] ritual something that you do your family
[1:15:45] does and you just are coming along
[1:15:54] but when i received that born-again
[1:15:56] experience
[1:15:58] i don't want to tell you that it was a
[1:15:59] roller coaster ride i don't want to tell
[1:16:01] you that it was a like
[1:16:03] that edge anything like that
[1:16:05] what i want to tell you is
[1:16:09] to know the lord is beyond that
[1:16:12] it's greater than that
[1:16:16] i don't mean like you get that
[1:16:18] that upside down stomach feeling i don't
[1:16:22] mean that
[1:16:24] but when god begins to make himself real
[1:16:27] to you and you meet him you really
[1:16:30] genuinely meet him and you know him and
[1:16:34] he begins revealing himself to you
[1:16:36] amongst pages you'd looked at a million
[1:16:40] times in your lifetime but you'd never
[1:16:43] seen him you never knew him you knew
[1:16:46] about him
[1:16:47] you'd heard about him you talked about
[1:16:50] him but you didn't really know him
[1:16:53] but when you know him
[1:16:56] it's newness of life
[1:17:00] it is it jesus couldn't have put it any
[1:17:04] better when he said being born again
[1:17:08] it's it's that newness of life all over
[1:17:11] again and
[1:17:12] i i found this
[1:17:14] i thought brother branham does a nice
[1:17:16] job of putting it
[1:17:18] he says
[1:17:19] this is from god's power to transform
[1:17:21] it's an old familiar text that many of
[1:17:24] our pastors has used down through your
[1:17:26] time it's been used since it was written
[1:17:29] but yet one thing about the word of god
[1:17:32] it never grows old
[1:17:35] because it's god
[1:17:38] it never grows old through every
[1:17:40] generation now for pretty near about 2
[1:17:43] 800 years or better this word of god has
[1:17:46] been read by man
[1:17:48] priests and so forth and never does it
[1:17:52] grow old
[1:17:54] i've been reading it myself for some 35
[1:17:57] years and each time i read it i find
[1:18:01] something new
[1:18:03] that i looked over the first time
[1:18:06] because it is inspired
[1:18:10] it is god in letter form
[1:18:13] see
[1:18:14] it's the attributes of god speaking
[1:18:17] forth and is placed on paper
[1:18:21] that's why we can read a text tonight
[1:18:25] that has been read
[1:18:27] hundreds and thousands and hundreds of
[1:18:30] thousands and millions of times before
[1:18:33] in in in countless churches in countless
[1:18:37] monasteries
[1:18:40] and it's still so real and alive to us
[1:18:45] because god is a spirit
[1:18:47] and when that spirit quickens the words
[1:18:51] to strike your heart it means something
[1:18:55] new
[1:18:57] it's new life
[1:19:02] i think that this is a really good
[1:19:04] illustration of it
[1:19:17] this child just opened
[1:19:20] no doubt so many gifts i don't know if
[1:19:23] this is his birthday if this is
[1:19:24] christmas or what it is
[1:19:26] maybe he got a new bike
[1:19:29] maybe he got a new lego set
[1:19:34] maybe he got i i don't know what maybe
[1:19:37] he got a playhouse
[1:19:39] i don't know what he got
[1:19:41] but now he's opening
[1:19:44] an avocado
[1:19:50] and this child is excited
[1:19:54] about an avocado
[1:19:57] he's tearing open this avocado and he's
[1:19:59] what's what could it be
[1:20:01] what could be inside this package and he
[1:20:03] opens it up and it's a avocado
[1:20:08] thanks
[1:20:11] he knows he's had an avocado sitting on
[1:20:13] his counter for
[1:20:15] weeks probably but he got his own
[1:20:19] avocado
[1:20:22] thanks
[1:20:27] it's new
[1:20:29] it's new to him
[1:20:31] and i look at that and i think oh god
[1:20:36] people look at this old
[1:20:38] wrinkled
[1:20:39] leather bound book
[1:20:41] and they think
[1:20:44] it's just an old wrinkled book
[1:20:47] and i already know what's inside of it
[1:20:51] but when the spirit of god moves upon it
[1:20:55] it's not just a wrinkled covered book
[1:20:58] anymore
[1:20:59] it's a avocado
[1:21:03] thanks
[1:21:10] and i think about that little
[1:21:13] fetus inside of that womb
[1:21:20] and what it's about to find that life
[1:21:22] has
[1:21:25] is beyond what it could even imagine
[1:21:29] it's going to see
[1:21:33] and so i want to give you a little bit
[1:21:35] of a visual for those of you perhaps
[1:21:38] who've never been able to travel
[1:21:42] those of you
[1:21:43] who have not seen
[1:21:45] the things
[1:21:48] the variety
[1:21:49] that god
[1:21:50] has put on this earth i just want to
[1:21:52] take you
[1:21:53] through a little bit of a world tour

[1:25:33] to go this is real close
[1:25:38] friends

[1:25:51] i kind of like that one
[1:25:53] myself

[1:26:35] vietnam
[1:26:40] italy
[1:26:45] china again
[1:26:50] chile
[1:26:55] and iceland again
[1:26:57] and as i visited each of these places to
[1:26:59] get these pictures
[1:27:02] no i didn't
[1:27:06] these are from google
[1:27:10] i thought wow to see the beauty of each
[1:27:13] of these places very different even some
[1:27:16] of those places that were desert sand
[1:27:18] dunes
[1:27:21] who would think sand dunes were pretty i
[1:27:24] mean you know here we live in arizona
[1:27:27] but you know we i look at places like
[1:27:29] this iceland and i think wow you know
[1:27:34] we don't see things like this all the
[1:27:36] time
[1:27:38] and you see the variety that god has got
[1:27:43] this is what it is to explore
[1:27:47] the word of god
[1:27:51] it's that newness
[1:27:52] it's that when you open
[1:27:54] that bible and you begin to get into the
[1:27:57] word of god
[1:27:58] he can take you places in your spirit
[1:28:02] from
[1:28:03] you could be in the absolute driest time
[1:28:06] of your life
[1:28:08] and instantly it's like god can turn on
[1:28:12] the the rushing fountains and he can
[1:28:15] begin to water your life and begin you
[1:28:19] you begin to see softness come out and
[1:28:22] green
[1:28:23] leaves taking place and fellowship in
[1:28:25] your life and it can happen in an
[1:28:27] instant
[1:28:29] and god can take you through these
[1:28:31] places and and he can allow you to
[1:28:33] to visit the mountaintops and then he
[1:28:35] can take you down in the valleys to
[1:28:38] experience
[1:28:39] not not to experience the loneliness of
[1:28:42] the valley but to experience
[1:28:45] him with you
[1:28:46] in those low times that while you're in
[1:28:50] those kinds of places he's there with
[1:28:53] you that he promised i'll be with you
[1:28:56] i'll never leave thee nor will i forsake
[1:28:59] thee
[1:29:01] and you can experience that for yourself
[1:29:05] this is becoming a child this is to be
[1:29:09] born again is to experience life for the
[1:29:13] first time life with god
[1:29:24] but it's not all mountaintops and
[1:29:26] waterfalls
[1:29:29] and there's a part
[1:29:34] of being a child
[1:29:43] when your child is in a dark room
[1:29:46] and they hear strange noises
[1:29:50] and maybe they've been
[1:29:53] in a
[1:29:53] pack and play or a crib next to your bed
[1:29:56] and that's where they were sleeping bef
[1:29:58] but at some point you put them in their
[1:30:00] own room
[1:30:02] and now it's their own room now they're
[1:30:04] away from mom and away from dad a little
[1:30:07] bit and they've experienced they're
[1:30:08] experiencing the darkness without the
[1:30:11] comfort of mom and dad being right there
[1:30:14] and they come running into your room
[1:30:17] i want to sleep with you and i want to
[1:30:19] sleep with you and you say why what's
[1:30:21] what's wrong
[1:30:23] there's a monster in my closet
[1:30:26] and you tell them
[1:30:28] there's no such thing as monsters
[1:30:32] now that's not true
[1:30:36] that's not true
[1:30:39] there very much is such thing as
[1:30:41] monsters
[1:30:43] we've experienced that as an adult we
[1:30:47] know very much
[1:30:48] that there are monsters
[1:30:50] now they may not be these hairy things
[1:30:53] with with
[1:30:54] razor teeth
[1:30:58] but we know that a man
[1:31:01] possessed
[1:31:03] by satan a man who knows not the life of
[1:31:07] god can very much be a monster
[1:31:13] a man who does not know
[1:31:15] the life of christ
[1:31:18] can be
[1:31:20] a monster
[1:31:22] so one
[1:31:23] when you've been born again
[1:31:27] jesus
[1:31:28] did not let the disciples and those that
[1:31:32] followed him he didn't lead them on this
[1:31:35] path of of fairy tales and unicorns and
[1:31:39] rainbows
[1:31:40] he was equipping them
[1:31:43] because he said i'm
[1:31:45] i'm going
[1:31:46] to set you out
[1:31:48] as sheep amongst wolves
[1:31:52] he but he was not going to leave them
[1:31:55] alone in doing that but he was going to
[1:31:58] equip them
[1:32:00] for the monsters that they would have to
[1:32:03] face in life
[1:32:06] and that's what we do
[1:32:08] when we come into the
[1:32:10] into this newness of life
[1:32:13] and and everything is so exciting but
[1:32:16] with time
[1:32:17] we begin to learn the realities
[1:32:21] of life and the trials and the
[1:32:23] tribulations and the powers and
[1:32:25] principalities that we've got to come
[1:32:28] against
[1:32:28] and
[1:32:29] and we can't
[1:32:32] we we can't
[1:32:34] just
[1:32:38] uh we can't just wish it away
[1:32:44] but we can be equipped
[1:32:47] we can be equipped and there's there's
[1:32:49] so many great instances in the bible
[1:32:53] that that this reminds me of when i
[1:32:56] think of when i see this immediately my
[1:32:58] mind is david and goliath
[1:33:00] a child who god brought through a bear
[1:33:05] brought through a lion to prepare him
[1:33:08] for a goliath
[1:33:12] and this is what god can do for us it's
[1:33:15] what he does for for for for a person a
[1:33:18] young person or an old person however
[1:33:20] old you are when when god when you
[1:33:22] receive that that
[1:33:25] that born-again experience god begins he
[1:33:28] doesn't leave you alone he equips you
[1:33:37] i don't know if you can read that
[1:33:41] i don't know if i can read that
[1:33:44] this is from uh revelations chapter four
[1:33:47] number two
[1:33:50] branham says then i remember
[1:33:52] right across the street here when i was
[1:33:54] just a young man billy paul
[1:33:57] was about three years old or four
[1:34:00] and we lived just across the street and
[1:34:02] one night he wanted a drink of water
[1:34:06] it was out in the kitchen
[1:34:08] the dipper and the bucket and i said
[1:34:10] oh i was so tired
[1:34:13] i'd worked hard all day and preached
[1:34:15] half the night
[1:34:17] and he said daddy i want a drink
[1:34:20] and i said billy just go right into the
[1:34:22] kitchen there it's on the little table i
[1:34:25] said
[1:34:26] he got up
[1:34:28] rubbed his eyes
[1:34:30] looked through there he said
[1:34:32] daddy
[1:34:33] i'm afraid to go
[1:34:35] see
[1:34:37] and i said well that it's all right
[1:34:39] i said just run on honey and get a drink
[1:34:42] daddy's so tired
[1:34:44] just a little distance about to that
[1:34:46] window
[1:34:48] and he said but i'm afraid to go daddy
[1:34:51] see
[1:34:52] well i got up with the little fellow and
[1:34:54] reached over and got a hold
[1:34:57] of i got a hold of my hand and it was a
[1:35:01] good thing
[1:35:02] we hadn't walked four or five steps
[1:35:06] till he hit a rug where mita had waxed
[1:35:10] the floor and on a piece of linoleum and
[1:35:12] you know how that is
[1:35:14] and he just made a scoot
[1:35:17] but i had his hand
[1:35:19] and then he just squeezed me that much
[1:35:21] tighter and then i stood there a little
[1:35:24] bit and i thought god that's right see i
[1:35:28] don't want to make one step without you
[1:35:31] hold my hand
[1:35:34] because i don't know when i'm going to
[1:35:36] slide you see
[1:35:39] and as long as i can feel your big
[1:35:42] powerful hand grip mine
[1:35:44] i know you'll hold me up in the times of
[1:35:48] my sea
[1:35:49] so i try to make a habit of that
[1:35:52] to keep my hand in his
[1:35:55] and sometimes i've done things that
[1:35:58] seemed ridiculous in my own sight such
[1:36:01] things that seem so
[1:36:03] uh so unnatural to the human mind but if
[1:36:06] we just let it alone i found out it was
[1:36:09] the only thing that could be done to be
[1:36:12] right
[1:36:13] you know
[1:36:14] the things that don't look right here if
[1:36:16] god leads you into them they'll be right
[1:36:20] out there somewhere you see
[1:36:23] because he knows how to lead
[1:36:25] so seeing that he is our all-sufficient
[1:36:29] grace and all that we have need of or
[1:36:32] care for is in him
[1:36:34] then let's lay aside everything else
[1:36:37] besides him
[1:36:38] and hold to god's unchanging hand
[1:36:50] if you
[1:36:52] have received that born-again experience
[1:36:55] and you say oh i'm just not i'm not far
[1:36:57] along i'm not as far along and and how
[1:37:00] do i know i'm not going to i hope i
[1:37:02] don't mess up
[1:37:03] you hold to god's unchanging hand
[1:37:07] i'll tell you even the the the oldest
[1:37:10] christian you know the person you know
[1:37:13] that's
[1:37:14] that's
[1:37:15] that's known god
[1:37:16] for more years than you've been alive
[1:37:18] and you think how do they do it i'll
[1:37:20] tell you they hold to god's unchanging
[1:37:24] hand
[1:37:25] and when they can't hold
[1:37:27] god holds them
[1:37:31] when you feel sometimes you feel like i
[1:37:33] really got a hold of god's hand and then
[1:37:35] there's times where you think oh god you
[1:37:37] must had a hold of mine because i don't
[1:37:40] feel like i had a very good hold on you
[1:37:44] and that's
[1:37:45] that's the grace of god
[1:37:48] and that grace of god that will cover
[1:37:51] it'll cover it'd cover a multitude of
[1:37:54] sins
[1:37:56] that's the love of god
[1:38:02] now they've created these stories for
[1:38:05] children
[1:38:08] these stories like peter pan
[1:38:12] that's
[1:38:13] davey crockett i believe who killed the
[1:38:15] bar when he was
[1:38:17] i don't know two years old or something
[1:38:19] like that with a knife
[1:38:21] then that bottom one is john henry and
[1:38:24] the story of john henry he was born with
[1:38:26] a hammer in his hand
[1:38:33] well
[1:38:36] brother branham said it like this
[1:38:38] the children in his day knew more about
[1:38:40] davy crockett than they knew about jesus
[1:38:43] christ
[1:38:46] they hear these tall tales
[1:38:48] and they hear these stories like peter
[1:38:51] pan and
[1:38:52] the deception to that story
[1:38:56] it's this story where there's a place
[1:38:58] where children can go and never have to
[1:39:02] grow up
[1:39:03] they never have to be an adult because
[1:39:05] why
[1:39:06] why would they want to be an adult the
[1:39:08] only adult that that that peter pan knew
[1:39:11] was captain hook
[1:39:13] and who wants to grow up to be a captain
[1:39:16] hook
[1:39:17] and so they see this captain hook they
[1:39:20] see this man and he's this angry
[1:39:23] uh
[1:39:24] man who's tasted that death has come and
[1:39:28] taken a part of him and he's got a clock
[1:39:31] ticking letting him know it's just a
[1:39:33] matter of time
[1:39:35] it's just a matter of time and it's this
[1:39:38] fear of time it's this fear of death
[1:39:42] coming and getting the rest of you that
[1:39:44] it's already had a taste of you you've
[1:39:46] had you've tasted sickness before and so
[1:39:49] you know that death is out there and
[1:39:52] that ticking clock is saying death is
[1:39:55] going to get you death is going to get
[1:39:57] you and it's a fear tactic to get you to
[1:40:01] fear the grave but
[1:40:04] we as believers don't have to be wrapped
[1:40:07] up in this idea of i don't want to grow
[1:40:10] up i don't want to face the harshness of
[1:40:13] life i don't want to have to face
[1:40:15] sickness i don't want to have to face
[1:40:18] death
[1:40:20] but if god
[1:40:22] who
[1:40:23] allowed you to be born again desires you
[1:40:27] to grow
[1:40:28] and to grow in his grace and to grow in
[1:40:31] his image and to let you know you don't
[1:40:34] have to fear death you don't have to
[1:40:37] fear sickness he's already conquered
[1:40:40] sickness he's already conquered hell
[1:40:43] he's already conquered the grave for you
[1:40:46] that you can grow in grace that you can
[1:40:49] grow in jesus christ
[1:40:53] then it's no longer a fairy tale
[1:40:56] it's no longer this story uh
[1:40:59] where it's it's a mockery davy crockett
[1:41:03] killing a bear at two years old is
[1:41:05] simply a mockery of god having men like
[1:41:08] david who had faith in god
[1:41:12] that he would handle the test
[1:41:17] it's not a fairy tale story it's a very
[1:41:20] real life experience
[1:41:35] yes
[1:41:37] there's hurt
[1:41:42] we fall down
[1:41:46] there's hurt there's real hurt
[1:41:50] in transitions in life
[1:41:53] there's real hurt
[1:42:00] you're depending
[1:42:03] if you're depending on a man if you're
[1:42:04] depending on
[1:42:06] on on a professor if you're depending on
[1:42:10] a boss if you're depending
[1:42:12] on a church
[1:42:14] you're going to experience hurt
[1:42:19] there's real hurt
[1:42:23] god allows it god doesn't cause it but
[1:42:26] god allows it
[1:42:29] so that you will put your total
[1:42:31] confidence in him
[1:42:39] first corinthians 13 11
[1:42:42] when i was a child i spake as a child
[1:42:46] i understood
[1:42:47] as a child
[1:42:49] i thought as a child
[1:42:51] but when i became a man
[1:42:54] i put away childish things
[1:43:13] we've come
[1:43:14] a long ways church we've come
[1:43:17] so far
[1:43:26] we've been given a word of god to equip
[1:43:28] us
[1:43:34] we've been given a proper interpretation
[1:43:37] of the word of god we had
[1:43:40] a prophet a divine interpreter of the
[1:43:43] word
[1:43:45] we're no longer relying
[1:43:47] upon somebody's idea
[1:43:50] upon the church's best guess
[1:43:53] upon what well the church says
[1:43:56] well
[1:43:58] down through the ages
[1:44:00] men
[1:44:01] tried to to manhandle the word of god
[1:44:05] to say i've got i've got this thing i've
[1:44:08] got this thing and
[1:44:10] unless you come through this channel you
[1:44:13] can't have the truth you're going to
[1:44:15] have to pay for it we have been
[1:44:18] restored back
[1:44:21] we have had the veil pulled off of the
[1:44:24] word of god we have been invited to come
[1:44:27] and take freely of the tree of life
[1:44:31] you have been given an opportunity in
[1:44:33] the day and age we live in we have we
[1:44:36] have received the word of god that will
[1:44:39] keep us it will keep us
[1:44:42] against denomination it will keep us
[1:44:44] against creeds it will keep us against
[1:44:47] dogmas it will keep us from being
[1:44:49] damaged by them by by by even
[1:44:53] one-man denominations
[1:44:56] from our own thinking
[1:44:58] well i think that this is the way to go
[1:45:00] but
[1:45:01] not
[1:45:02] my will
[1:45:04] but thy will be done o lord
[1:45:08] it equips us
[1:45:10] and these transitions in life they're
[1:45:13] they're
[1:45:17] you're you're always a child
[1:45:20] you're always a child and that's
[1:45:23] one of the most beautiful things that i
[1:45:25] believe has been given to the bride of
[1:45:28] jesus christ and especially in this last
[1:45:30] age is to see predestination
[1:45:35] to see that if you are a part of god you
[1:45:39] always were a part of god
[1:45:42] that as god is eternal if you've got
[1:45:45] that seed gene inside of you you're as
[1:45:49] eternal as god is
[1:45:52] and when that begins to to to
[1:45:55] to become real to us we say oh god
[1:46:01] this is why you've watched over me it's
[1:46:04] why you watched over my parents it's why
[1:46:06] you watched over my grandparents so that
[1:46:09] because i realize that you're a god
[1:46:12] who's interested in me
[1:46:16] it's very personal
[1:46:26] and here we see
[1:46:28] an instant
[1:46:30] of a young man who comes to a transition
[1:46:33] in life
[1:46:35] who's come to a point and
[1:46:40] brother branham
[1:46:44] preaches about those two
[1:46:46] two boys
[1:46:47] two rich young rulers and he takes this
[1:46:49] man as one and he takes moses as the
[1:46:52] other
[1:46:54] and he shows how both of them
[1:46:58] had come to a point of decision in their
[1:47:00] life
[1:47:02] and how that one
[1:47:04] when it came to that
[1:47:06] decision time when it came to that
[1:47:09] time in his life when the opportunity
[1:47:12] was presented to him he felt like to
[1:47:14] give up the things of the world was just
[1:47:18] too much to ask
[1:47:21] but we see that when moses was presented
[1:47:23] with that and he was presented with that
[1:47:26] when he
[1:47:28] was in the next in line to become
[1:47:30] pharaoh over the greatest nation on
[1:47:33] earth
[1:47:34] and he s
[1:47:36] he said i'd rather suffer
[1:47:39] the reproach of christ
[1:47:41] than to enjoy
[1:47:43] the riches of egypt
[1:47:57] i'm gonna
[1:47:58] i just want to read this
[1:48:02] scripture and
[1:48:04] i'm coming to a close here
[1:48:10] i didn't have enough ribbons in my
[1:48:14] bible here to have this immediately but
[1:48:18] oh here we go that's nice
[1:48:21] but they that wait upon the lord
[1:48:25] shall renew their strength
[1:48:27] they shall mount up with wings as eagles
[1:48:31] they shall run and not be weary and they
[1:48:33] shall walk and not faint that was my
[1:48:36] very next slide wasn't it
[1:48:42] i remember the story that was told and i
[1:48:45] i could be wrong you can cr you're free
[1:48:47] to correct me if i'm wrong but i believe
[1:48:48] it was brother dawson riley
[1:48:51] who gave his testimony and he was
[1:48:52] talking about
[1:48:54] the eagles
[1:48:56] and he and he tells the story about the
[1:48:58] eagles and
[1:49:00] we know how that brother branham talked
[1:49:02] about
[1:49:04] how that an eagle can
[1:49:06] its beak can get crusted over
[1:49:10] and how that the eagle will
[1:49:12] find its way when it's crusted over
[1:49:14] he'll find his way back to its birth
[1:49:16] rock because the eagles are born up in
[1:49:18] some of these high rocks and things some
[1:49:21] some of these eagles
[1:49:23] and they'll go back to that birth rock
[1:49:25] and they'll begin to beat their heads
[1:49:29] against
[1:49:30] the rock
[1:49:32] to get that crust off because when it
[1:49:34] crusts over it crossover so hard they
[1:49:37] can't open their beaks to eat so they
[1:49:39] essentially they starve to death
[1:49:43] and how that
[1:49:45] they beat that beak against that rock to
[1:49:48] beat all the crust off and he says quite
[1:49:52] often it's a bloody mess it's
[1:49:54] it's very violent and there's just blood
[1:49:57] everywhere and you think oh what a sad
[1:49:59] thing
[1:50:00] but that eagle
[1:50:02] begins to rejoice
[1:50:04] even in its in this mess even in this
[1:50:07] its own blood
[1:50:08] it begins to rejoice because it's free
[1:50:11] to eat again
[1:50:14] it's free to eat the good things and to
[1:50:17] begin to have life
[1:50:19] brought back to it
[1:50:21] i believe it was brother dawson in his
[1:50:23] testimony that said
[1:50:25] that there's
[1:50:27] i don't know if it's all eagles maybe he
[1:50:29] said all eagles i can't recall they go
[1:50:31] through what they call this molting
[1:50:33] stage and it's a it's a very low time in
[1:50:36] their life they're very old eagles and
[1:50:39] they go through this season in their
[1:50:40] life of depression
[1:50:42] and and they begin to lose their
[1:50:45] feathers and things and it's a very sad
[1:50:48] sad sight
[1:50:50] they go through this season in their
[1:50:53] life and if they can't get out of that
[1:50:56] they'll die
[1:50:58] if they can't overcome that period in
[1:51:00] their life they'll die they'll just give
[1:51:02] up they they lose the very
[1:51:06] purpose
[1:51:07] to be an eagle and they die
[1:51:10] but if they can
[1:51:13] when they get through that
[1:51:16] they get they
[1:51:17] they grow out these new feathers and
[1:51:20] they lose they shake out all those old
[1:51:23] ones and a lot of times they'll they'll
[1:51:24] fly to do that and to blow out the loose
[1:51:27] feathers
[1:51:29] but they'll they
[1:51:31] their beaks become
[1:51:33] shiny again and
[1:51:35] i believe his words were this i want to
[1:51:38] say it was brother dawson
[1:51:40] that when they get through it when they
[1:51:42] overcome that
[1:51:44] you can't tell the difference
[1:51:47] between that eagle
[1:51:49] and a two-year-old eagle
[1:51:51] you can't see any difference between the
[1:51:54] two of them because they've renewed
[1:51:57] their youth
[1:52:01] now we're talking about becoming as
[1:52:03] children and many of us would say well i
[1:52:06] i've received that years ago that
[1:52:08] born-again experience i received that
[1:52:10] years ago i know what you're talking
[1:52:12] about i remember those days yes brother
[1:52:14] that's fine of course i remember that
[1:52:18] but you can experience that again
[1:52:21] i i don't mean you can be born again
[1:52:24] again but what i'm saying is you can
[1:52:27] renew your youth
[1:52:29] in the lord that you don't have to when
[1:52:34] when the seasons of life and the
[1:52:36] pressures of life and the hard pressures
[1:52:39] that that that have happened to you in
[1:52:41] the trials and the tribulations it
[1:52:43] doesn't mean that you have to say well
[1:52:46] i'm just older now and i've gone through
[1:52:49] a lot and so i'll just go out and i'll
[1:52:51] just die but you can be renewed again
[1:52:55] and the prime example when i hear the
[1:52:58] message of the hour is i hear brother
[1:53:00] branham when he's praying for somebody
[1:53:02] in a prayer line and they may be over 80
[1:53:05] years old
[1:53:07] over 80 years old now all the children
[1:53:10] in here are going
[1:53:11] that's
[1:53:12] ancient
[1:53:14] and then some of us that or some of us
[1:53:17] though some of you all that are
[1:53:18] approaching 80 are going hey wait now
[1:53:20] wait hold on a second don't write me off
[1:53:22] just yet
[1:53:26] they'll come in a prayer line and
[1:53:28] brother branham will say you know
[1:53:32] for somebody this old to come and desire
[1:53:36] a touch from the lord
[1:53:38] he says i'm reminded of abraham and
[1:53:42] sarah
[1:53:43] who were given a promise when they were
[1:53:46] old that they would have a child and god
[1:53:49] turned them back young again
[1:53:52] so that they could have a child
[1:53:56] and oh my that gives me so much
[1:53:59] joy in my heart when i see
[1:54:02] uh older ones that sit in in a church
[1:54:06] and and who who are so interested in the
[1:54:09] things of god
[1:54:11] that if you could close your eyes and
[1:54:13] you could just hear the words
[1:54:16] they're rejuvenated like a young person
[1:54:19] excited about the things of god because
[1:54:22] god doesn't get old his word doesn't get
[1:54:25] old neither does the spirit that comes
[1:54:28] with the word of god
[1:54:29] and a person in their 80s can love the
[1:54:32] word of god and receive the good things
[1:54:35] of god just like a young person can
[1:54:37] receive the good things of god
[1:54:44] i was thinking about how that the story
[1:54:47] of the eagle
[1:54:48] is that when its mouth is crusted over
[1:54:51] when he beats
[1:54:52] that crust off he's too weak to fly
[1:54:56] so the story is
[1:54:58] that the other eagles
[1:55:00] will then go out and they will gather
[1:55:03] meat
[1:55:05] and they will fly over
[1:55:07] that valley where those eagles are and
[1:55:09] they'll drop the meat down to that eagle
[1:55:12] so that that eagle can eat again
[1:55:16] now
[1:55:21] i don't believe
[1:55:25] that the eagle
[1:55:26] who's down there who's hungry it hasn't
[1:55:30] eaten
[1:55:32] i don't believe that it's sending up
[1:55:34] messages
[1:55:36] now i only take filet mignon
[1:55:39] and i only like it prepared medium rare
[1:55:43] if it's anything else i just
[1:55:44] i just can't accept it
[1:55:47] no
[1:55:48] but if those eagles bring fish
[1:55:51] that eagle's got to eat the fish
[1:55:54] if that eagle brings rabbit
[1:55:57] that eagle's got to eat rabbit
[1:56:00] now those eagles
[1:56:02] might be eagles who've gone through the
[1:56:04] process before
[1:56:05] and so maybe
[1:56:07] they've
[1:56:08] understood that in a time like this
[1:56:12] rabbit's a good meal
[1:56:14] rabbit will get you through
[1:56:16] in a time like this
[1:56:18] is going to require
[1:56:20] some fish you're going to need some fish
[1:56:25] and i say i only say that to say this
[1:56:28] god knows what you have need of
[1:56:31] it might be
[1:56:33] a sermon from the pulpit it might be
[1:56:37] it might be a song
[1:56:42] it might be a phone call
[1:56:46] it might be a visit
[1:56:49] it might be an embrace
[1:56:56] it might be
[1:56:58] shedding tears together
[1:57:04] whatever it is
[1:57:06] that god knows that you need to renew
[1:57:09] your youth to become as children
[1:57:13] he will provide it
[1:57:17] are you willing
[1:57:19] to receive it
[1:57:22] and can you see
[1:57:24] this was from the lord now we know the
[1:57:26] story of the man who was stranded
[1:57:30] because of the
[1:57:31] the flood that rose up and
[1:57:33] he was on the roof of the house and
[1:57:36] was praying god save me god i need a
[1:57:39] miracle i need the supernatural to
[1:57:42] happen now
[1:57:43] i need you to get me off of this roof
[1:57:45] out of this flood and a boat came by
[1:57:48] and it was a ranger and he said hey i
[1:57:50] got a boat get in the boat he said no no
[1:57:52] no no no go ahead go on i'm waiting for
[1:57:55] god to save me
[1:57:58] then somebody else came by on a raft
[1:58:01] said hey come on i got a raft no no no
[1:58:03] no you go on you go on i'm waiting for
[1:58:06] god to save me then a helicopter came
[1:58:09] he said i got here dropped the ladder
[1:58:11] come on up at the helicopter no no no no
[1:58:13] i'm waiting for god and then the person
[1:58:15] died
[1:58:16] they drowned
[1:58:17] and when they got to
[1:58:18] heaven they said god why didn't you save
[1:58:22] me
[1:58:24] he said i sent by
[1:58:26] a motorboat a raft in a helicopter
[1:58:40] how many times have i missed it
[1:58:50] it's like brother aaron was saying to me
[1:58:52] in the back
[1:58:53] and he repeated it out here
[1:58:57] so many times we've
[1:58:59] our bodies are weary and we're tired and
[1:59:01] we think all i need is a vacation and i
[1:59:04] thought about this recently
[1:59:08] we were planning on going on vacation i
[1:59:09] thought i'm going to need it
[1:59:12] it's been very stressful very
[1:59:14] a lot going on i thought i'm going to
[1:59:16] need it so
[1:59:17] we took the family and i we went camping
[1:59:20] and i thought this is going to be so
[1:59:22] good we're going to be out in the
[1:59:23] wilderness it's going to be just
[1:59:25] i'll tell you i just
[1:59:27] it's
[1:59:31] the
[1:59:32] the the windows of heaven are gonna open
[1:59:34] and i'm gonna be caught up into it
[1:59:38] and i left that camping trip
[1:59:40] with
[1:59:41] a pain in my neck from sleeping wrong on
[1:59:44] a camping trip
[1:59:46] that didn't leave for three or four days
[1:59:48] after we were done with the camping trip
[1:59:51] and i had to laugh
[1:59:53] we were listening to a tape on our way
[1:59:55] back from the camping trip and i
[1:59:57] couldn't hardly turn my head you know
[1:59:59] how that look is when you can't and
[2:00:00] everybody knows you have a stiff neck
[2:00:02] because you're turning your body instead
[2:00:04] of
[2:00:05] yeah i'm fine
[2:00:08] and we were listening to a tape and
[2:00:09] brother branham said you know
[2:00:14] he said this life
[2:00:15] sometimes i feel like it's a nightmare
[2:00:18] and i just want to wake up from it
[2:00:20] i just want to wake up from it lord
[2:00:24] and i had to laugh i thought boy that is
[2:00:26] so right
[2:00:27] even the best of vacations
[2:00:31] can be very painful
[2:00:34] and it's just like
[2:00:35] what are we doing here
[2:00:37] this world is so temporal this body is
[2:00:42] so fallible this body can fall apart and
[2:00:44] get aches and pains but oh god i'm
[2:00:47] waiting for that day when we wake up
[2:00:50] and oh my there's no more pain there's
[2:00:53] no more suffering there's no more none
[2:00:55] of this pressure then you talk about a
[2:00:58] vacation going on a vacation god it's
[2:01:01] not out of duty but it's out of a love
[2:01:04] affair that when i when i read the word
[2:01:06] of god and when we come together around
[2:01:08] the things of god i can open this up and
[2:01:12] say oh it's an avocado
[2:01:17] thank you lord
[2:01:19] oh
[2:01:20] my very own
[2:01:22] thank you
[2:01:30] it can be
[2:01:34] it can be
[2:01:36] i pray it is for you
[2:01:40] i pray that
[2:01:44] that we all together we can all become
[2:01:46] as children to receive
[2:01:49] the word of god
[2:01:51] let's stand together
[2:01:53] sorry i've kept you this long
[2:02:11] i just wonder if
[2:02:14] while we bowed our heads for this final
[2:02:16] word of prayer
[2:02:27] if in your heart you would
[2:02:30] just search your heart just search
[2:02:32] your life and
[2:02:36] consider
[2:02:37] what it means
[2:02:41] what this word means to you and
[2:02:44] has it lost that excitement
[2:02:50] are you in a place where you're weary
[2:02:52] where you're just
[2:02:54] you're numb
[2:02:56] from the heartache and the trials
[2:02:59] you say i
[2:03:01] want to know what that is again to
[2:03:03] see the face of god
[2:03:05] like that little child
[2:03:08] and every time that he
[2:03:10] he reveals himself
[2:03:13] be like the first time i saw him
[2:03:17] be so precious
[2:03:23] say i want that again i want i want to
[2:03:25] become like that
[2:03:26] i want to become like a child
[2:03:29] [Music]
[2:03:35] i need him to hold my hand i'm going
[2:03:37] through a very dark place right now and
[2:03:46] i need him to hold my hand
[2:03:49] i can't go there alone i can't go i
[2:03:51] can't i can't keep going down this road
[2:03:54] alone i need to feel the comfort of
[2:03:57] god's hand
[2:04:00] and
[2:04:02] maybe the hand that god would
[2:04:04] [Music]
[2:04:06] would
[2:04:07] slip into yours would be
[2:04:13] would be a brother would be a sister
[2:04:15] that
[2:04:19] that can
[2:04:19] [Music]
[2:04:21] can be a god with skin on it for you
[2:04:25] i pray that
[2:04:28] god will send an angel your way
[2:04:31] i don't
[2:04:33] i mean by an angel
[2:04:35] a messenger
[2:04:37] one of his children
[2:04:39] [Music]
[2:04:40] i know what that is to go through those
[2:04:43] dark times to feel lonely
[2:04:47] [Music]
[2:04:48] i i don't know it like some
[2:04:51] some people do i've never had hard times
[2:04:53] like
[2:04:54] when you hear stories of some
[2:04:57] we've been through some things and we
[2:04:59] know
[2:05:00] we know what it is to
[2:05:03] but above all
[2:05:05] god knows
[2:05:07] when he was hanging on the cross it was
[2:05:09] his very children that were crying for
[2:05:12] his blood
[2:05:14] he knew
[2:05:15] when he was there on the cross hanging
[2:05:17] there
[2:05:18] and he was crying out before god my god
[2:05:22] my god why hast thou forsaken me
[2:05:26] he felt forsaken by all
[2:05:31] perhaps you've tasted a little bit of
[2:05:33] that in your life and you feel you've
[2:05:35] been forsaken even by god
[2:05:40] i want you to know
[2:05:45] [Music]
[2:05:47] that he went from that place
[2:05:51] and he went in power
[2:05:54] he went down to the gates of hell
[2:05:57] he took all of our sin and all of our
[2:05:59] sorrow and all of our loneliness and he
[2:06:01] carried it down there
[2:06:03] and he
[2:06:04] opened up the gates of hell and he threw
[2:06:06] him in there he said it was finished
[2:06:11] satan thought he was just a man maybe
[2:06:13] even a prophet
[2:06:15] but he had no idea
[2:06:17] [Music]
[2:06:19] that death had just struck something
[2:06:22] that was greater
[2:06:24] that was the life of god now though he
[2:06:27] went down he couldn't stay down for the
[2:06:30] power
[2:06:31] of god that was in jesus christ
[2:06:34] rose him up again and he took others
[2:06:37] with him
[2:06:38] and i want you to know that that same
[2:06:41] power of jesus christ the same life of
[2:06:44] god it's here and it can bring you from
[2:06:47] a low place it can bring you from a
[2:06:50] sickness it can bring you from a
[2:06:52] loneliness he can bring you from a place
[2:06:55] of feeling forsaken and he can you can
[2:06:57] raise up victorious again
[2:07:00] i want you to know that
[2:07:04] heavenly father
[2:07:05] lord
[2:07:07] i know lord i know
[2:07:10] that you are still a discerner of the
[2:07:12] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[2:07:16] that god you hear our very cry from our
[2:07:19] innermost parts though we would never
[2:07:22] even mutter a word you've walked the
[2:07:24] corridors of our hearts and you know the
[2:07:27] very desires in our hearts even before
[2:07:30] we ask it but oh god i pray now that as
[2:07:34] you walk those alleyways of our hearts
[2:07:37] as you open every door and as each
[2:07:40] individual would say god i'm opening
[2:07:42] these doors and i want you to come in

[2:08:05] alleyway and every
[2:08:07] every corner and crevice of each heart
[2:08:10] here that god that light would shine and
[2:08:13] cast darkness away and that god you
[2:08:16] would raise them up victorious again

[2:11:06] teach me not
[2:11:08] to rely on
[2:11:13] what others do
[2:11:16] but to wait
[2:11:19] in
[2:11:20] prayer for an answer
[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:57] teach me
[2:11:58] [Music]
[2:12:05] would lord put up psalms 23
[2:12:09] i wonder how many times this psalms has
[2:12:11] been read quoted
[2:12:13] thought of
[2:12:16] but it still has the same effective
[2:12:18] as when david wrote it amen
[2:12:21] psalms 23
[2:12:23] the lord is my shepherd
[2:12:25] i shall not want
[2:12:27] david learned this as a child
[2:12:31] i just called out mommy and daddy came
[2:12:33] and read it
[2:12:35] let's go through all the verses
[2:12:38] he maketh me to lie down in green
[2:12:40] pastures he leave me behind the still
[2:12:42] waters
[2:12:44] as he was talking i thought back of our
[2:12:46] our children how we we did our best all
[2:12:49] we could
[2:12:50] he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in
[2:12:52] the path of righteousness
[2:12:54] for his name's sake
[2:12:56] he says
[2:12:57] and then he grew up a little bit
[2:12:59] life went on yea though i walk through
[2:13:01] the valley of shadow of death
[2:13:03] [Music]
[2:13:05] he went through some hard times
[2:13:07] he went through things that turned
[2:13:09] around
[2:13:10] he wondered
[2:13:11] but something
[2:13:12] he said i will fear no evil for thou art
[2:13:15] with me
[2:13:16] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[2:13:22] and then you prepared a table in the
[2:13:23] presence of my enemies
[2:13:25] david could write this because he saw it
[2:13:27] happen
[2:13:28] stage of life
[2:13:30] he says thou anointest my head with oil
[2:13:33] and my cup runeth over
[2:13:36] sometimes i ask the lord remind me
[2:13:39] remind me just one more time and then
[2:13:42] surely goodness and mercy
[2:13:44] shall follow me
[2:13:46] all the days of my life
[2:13:48] and i will dwell
[2:13:49] in the house of the lord forever
[2:13:52] there's going to be
[2:13:54] a change
[2:13:55] and we're going home
[2:13:57] amen
[2:13:58] but there's that stage of life
[2:14:01] and everyone goes through it
[2:14:03] as he was talking about those
[2:14:06] 80 and i thought i don't know for sure
[2:14:08] but i know
[2:14:09] mom's 86 and dad's 85
[2:14:13] and i know their desire and their that
[2:14:16] that that that god placed in their heart
[2:14:18] from as young people they recognize it's
[2:14:20] it's still there
[2:14:22] how many times to talk with dad
[2:14:24] and he says just looking toward that day
[2:14:26] just drawing pulling this one it doesn't
[2:14:28] go it's eternal
[2:14:30] amen
[2:14:32] but as he was saying that i was thinking
[2:14:33] about those things in psalms 23 came how
[2:14:36] many times that that song's been read
[2:14:39] uh hundreds of thousands of times all
[2:14:41] over the whole world
[2:14:43] and it still has effective power in it
[2:14:45] it's not losses
[2:14:48] and then i thought of this song as i
[2:14:50] walk
[2:14:52] uh say let me get it jesus hold my hand
[2:14:54] as i travel
[2:14:56] through this
[2:14:58] this pilgrim land there's a friend who
[2:15:00] walks with me
[2:15:02] lead me safely through the singing sand
[2:15:05] it's the christ of calvary if we can get
[2:15:07] the words up to them
[2:15:09] this would be my prayer dear lord each
[2:15:11] day help me do the best i can
[2:15:13] for i need thy light to guide me day and
[2:15:16] night
[2:15:17] blessed jesus
[2:15:18] hold my hand
[2:15:21] as i travel through this building land
[2:15:26] there is a friend who walks there
[2:15:32] holds me safely through
[2:15:35] [Music]
[2:15:49] do oh
[2:15:50] best i can
[2:15:54] for i need thy light to guide me day and
[2:15:58] night blessed jesus hold on
[2:16:07] [Music]
[2:16:16] and
[2:16:20] [Music]
[2:16:29] my

[2:20:00] i want to reach out
[2:20:02] thinking about
[2:20:05] when brother reggie was talking about
[2:20:06] with the kids
[2:20:08] growing up i
[2:20:09] i remember
[2:20:11] when we first
[2:20:13] i told his daughters were born and we
[2:20:16] had a mobile home and
[2:20:17] one bedroom was on one side and the
[2:20:20] other bedroom was on the far side and
[2:20:22] they now slept in the other room
[2:20:25] and thank god for a good mama
[2:20:28] because daddy would fall asleep you know
[2:20:31] but it was interesting because
[2:20:33] naomi would come from that room
[2:20:35] to our room
[2:20:37] and then i would wake up with her face
[2:20:39] right here going daddy
[2:20:42] daddy wake up daddy wake up
[2:20:45] boy did daddy wake up
[2:20:48] elizabeth
[2:20:50] woke up in the neighborhood heard about
[2:20:51] her coming down
[2:20:53] the hallway
[2:20:55] and she would tell herself elizabeth
[2:20:57] walk
[2:20:58] because she'd start running
[2:21:00] and daddy would say elizabeth walk every
[2:21:02] child is different
[2:21:03] every childhood but you know what you
[2:21:05] know why they came to you and came to
[2:21:06] daddy and mama's room because daddy and
[2:21:08] mommy would take care of them
[2:21:10] they had that confidence in lord no
[2:21:12] matter how i get there let me get there
[2:21:15] no matter how i do let me go to where
[2:21:17] you're at lord and i know you'll meet
[2:21:19] with me
[2:21:20] and i appreciate that lord you enjoy the
[2:21:22] word of the lord today you appreciate
[2:21:23] brother reggie coming and sharing that
[2:21:26] amen i do
[2:21:29] but sometimes sometimes it's good to be
[2:21:31] reminded as a child
[2:21:34] to take us back home and may that
[2:21:36] experience with god be every day renewed
[2:21:38] my
[2:21:40] my it wasn't just wonderful you know i
[2:21:43] know as as parents sometimes when our
[2:21:44] kids would give us something we would
[2:21:46] purposely act surprised oh you kind of
[2:21:49] knew
[2:21:51] all the girls played in orchestra
[2:21:54] and we knew each year the new ones were
[2:21:56] going to play the same songs that the
[2:21:58] last ones played
[2:22:00] and they would come home and said we
[2:22:01] learned a new song today and it's mary
[2:22:03] had a little lamb really sing it to me
[2:22:06] i've never heard it before oh you did
