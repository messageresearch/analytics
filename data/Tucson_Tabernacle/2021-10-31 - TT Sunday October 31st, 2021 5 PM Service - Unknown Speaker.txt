we do have a request and we'll bring that to your attention sister merrily carol is requesting prayers she for her arm she had a shot over two weeks ago and is still in pain with it so we'll just ask the lord to take care of that even now so i'll also remember my son-in-law steve and my daughter nina as they're making their plans too to be moving to tucson here they're hopefully hopefully be here by december at the latest if it all works out and they've stephen's been putting in some applications and things and they would like to have a job before they get here it's what they're hoping and believing so but god knows how to take care of all those things so we'll just believe that and um i asked my are talking with my father right now and he's my sister kathy we prayed for her this morning's service and she said about halfway through the service she began to feel good and she was feeling very well so appreciate god's mercy and his grace so if you'll stand with me and i know we ask quite often how many have a need but there's always something that we have in need of sometimes there's not words to put it into maybe just a desire in your heart you're not but god knows what that is so a loved one this morning as brother reggie was ministering and and um and he's thinking think about that one maybe that's in your heart right now that the lord would would reach out to and

our brothers and sisters to join our hearts together join our faith together hear the word that's going to be coming forth from our brother reggie and these needs that have been presented have been presented in faith not in discouragement not in o me but in praise the lord because he answers prayer so let's go to our prayer answering god lord jesus we are so grateful for this opportunity that we can gather together lord a night when kids are running around in costumes and doing all sorts of things but lord it's a night that we can come and set aside lord as as another day another sunday another beginning of a week another opportunity to praise you to worship you to be with you to be with brothers and sisters lord we ask that you'd meet each one of these needs our sister merrily carroll's arm lord the the need for uh stephen and nina as they're preparing to come this way lord that you'd give them encouragement in their heart lord that regardless of whether a job opens before

afraid of but rather he says come on come on in to think that he wants it more sometimes than we do he desires that fellowship amen as a deer panteth for the water so my soul panteth after thee sometimes other things get in the way and and realize i was talking a little bit with brother reggie i said sometimes we we go and do other things and what really we wanted our heart was desiring to do that which draws us nigh to him but we get caught up in other things or the day goes by we say oh lord i'm so tired now i'm just going to go to bed now and you get up in the morning saying why i

the life around them be a life of christ a christian example and let them grow with that amen god bless [Music] i've had many tears and sorrows i've had questions for tomorrow there have been times i didn't know right from wrong [Music] but in every situation god gave blessed consolation that my trials they come to make me strong oh went through it all through it all i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned to trust in god through it all through it all i've learned to depend upon his work i've been a lot of places and i've seen so many faces there been times that i felt so all alone but in my lonely hour yes those precious and lonely hours jesus let me know i was his own [Music] and through it all yes through it all i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned to trust in god through it all through it all i've learned to depend upon his word so i thank god for the mountains i thank him for the valleys thank him for the storms he brought me through if i never had a problem wouldn't know that he could solve it i wouldn't know what faith that god could do and that's why through it all all through it all i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned to trust in god through it all through it all i've learned to depend upon his word sing it with it me through it all i've learned [Music] through it all yes through it all i've learned to depend upon oh yes i've learned to depend upon his words [Music] i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned to trust [Music] it's an experience it's a learning it's a process you know you some things you you do it once or twice and you say i'm not going to do it that way again but then there comes a day that you learn lord i'm going trust in you because he's god on the mountain he's god in the valley and he never changes let's sing that god in the mountain [Music] get the words up to god on the mountain [Music] i've just blanked on them completely right now so oh life is easy [Music] all oh [Music] when things go wrong he'll make

he said well it's reggie ben dave and plent and he said sometimes people think three brothers are going to walk in so he told me i could do this brother reggie went home and brother ben david stayed to preach today and my wife said don't you dare say but i appreciate brother reggie and the family coming down and willing to i love his attitude and i just just uh just a great attitude and just wanting to serve the people and appreciate it it's been a blessing to us so as he comes and we see what the lord has for us because um god has some for us let's let's stand lord i lift your name [Music] you're [Music] my comforter that first verse [Music] me [Music] lord i lift your name your holy [Music] halloween you're [Music] can you sing this next verse and mean it to the lord [Music] is [Music] lord i live your name your holy i am the reason [Music] amen may god grant that tonight that he'd be all those things for us it's good to be back in the house of the lord with you i thank you all for coming and especially you young people good to see some young people in the house of the lord on this night and i know it's tempting to go out and grab as much candy as you can grab and maybe when you go home this evening you can run over to your neighbor's house and tell them you're dressed as a christian and see what uh what they've got left over amen yeah yeah i say tell them the preacher told you to do it i uh felt like i had a lot of pressure on me today with uh brother guerra saying that the minister was gonna pick his thoughts and preach on the thoughts that he had i thought oh lord i don't have that gift i don't have that ability and he let me know that i didn't do it so i it lets me know that i am certainly don't have that gift and i just have to be humbled and you'll have to bear with what the lord has provided this evening if our brothers could pull up we're gonna go through some slides and maybe have a little bit of a visual i'm a very visual person or maybe i guess i should say i've got quite an imagination and so in my imagination i um i like to when i read the word of god and when i think about the things of god uh sometimes i'll i'll spend quite a bit of time um painting myself into the drama and um i don't know if there's if if i i i'm certain that not everybody's like that certainly not everybody's like me thank the lord um but tonight i wanted to minister on becoming as children and i thought this is good for the young people but it's also good for the older ones as well and so i i pray that the lord will bless you through this if you have your bibles you'd like to turn over into matthew the 18th chapter this is where we'll be drawing our our text from and this image i love this image that i found this is when jesus is explaining to his disciples suffered the little children to come unto me and forbid them not and i really like this fellow right back here is hidden and i just the comfort that you see of the children looking to jesus with the eyes of it's okay right it's okay that we're here um with a little bit of a debate and that guy hidden right in the back there tells me that he's saying i want to sneak into this myself i want to get in on this and i trust that that's how we feel tonight that you say lord if you come by tonight don't pass me by if you're going to touch someone you're going to bless somebody lord don't forget me let me let me get in on some of that too so in matthew chapter 18 we'll read verses 1 through 6 and i have it here printed so that you can read it as well at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who yes who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea amen let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer our precious heavenly father lord we read these words and god it causes us each one within our own hearts to say oh lord i want to become like that i i don't want to miss it lord i don't want to miss it i don't want to be too big that i can't receive you as a child would receive something from their own parents but lord we want to receive the good things that you have for us in your word that lord would help us to to look into the mirror of your word and to examine ourselves and lord where we come short we want to say forgive us would you take those things away from us lord so that our image would bear the very image of your son jesus christ lord this is our desire not just we don't want to just look the part but lord we want to be every bit lord the child that you desire granted heavenly father we pray you just be with us this evening be with all those lord that are out this evening lord all these young people and children pray you be merciful god and watch over lord protect keep safe lord we would ask that you would just come and lord bring for us lord the bread of life lord that we could feast tonight we ask it in jesus christ's name amen thank god bless you can be seated i was telling our young sister guerra this afternoon as brother we were enjoying uh a wonderful cup of latte from brother lyle who's a tremendous barista if if you ever care to know that and i don't know if he ever wanted to let that that secret out but um we were talking about she had asked me are you okay coming out and fellowshipping like this or would you do you need your naps on sunday and i said well we do enjoy our sunday afternoon naps i said but i don't always get one and i said but i'll tell you these lattes help you know when you don't get your nap and i said but i i do feel that sometimes after i've after i have stayed up and not gotten a nap and i drink coffee to keep myself alert and awake if then i go minister in evening service and anybody comes up to me after the service and says wow i really enjoyed that service it was very good i'm always somewhat hesitant and a little bit leery to know lord was was that was i following the inspiration of the spirit or was that just the latte was that the inspiration of the caffeine that was bringing me along and i i uh i trust that tonight it will be the spirit of god that will be moving that would speak to us and as we discussed this subject becoming as children i say this because perhaps there's somebody who who has never gone through this subject and they've never had anybody walk them through the scripture through some of these scriptures like we see these here where jesus is saying except ye be converted and become as little children so many times maybe we would think what does that mean exactly to become as little children we're grown adults and jesus knows this jesus knows that that that the people that are coming and and and and and even those that that have even the desire who have had an experience in life or or or have a desire to know god and who have had a hard life long enough to know that surely this can't be everything there is to life and this can't just be the purpose of life is to just wander along like this there's something bigger usually those are adults that have those thoughts or certainly once you're above about or older than that age of accountability and so it's good for us to examine these scriptures as jesus said search the scripture for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me so it's good for us to to search these things out and we read this and over in luke chapter 18 very similar scripture verse 17 says verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein and these are scriptures referring to uh becoming like children and and there's many scriptures and and we're gonna go through some of them that that you will you will recognize but i'm we look here at saint john chapter 3 and i'll i'll read this portion for you uh you can turn there if you'd like st john chapter 3 but we find that nicodemus comes to jesus in the night and he says how can a man well excuse me it he came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said unto him verily verily which is absolutely absolutely okay so absolutely i say unto you this is an absolute except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god now that is quite a statement no explanation just accept a man be born again never heard that term before perhaps this and here jesus says accept a man be born again now nicodemus being a man and and and and never i i guess not used to the supernatural not used to the word of god coming in parables he immediately says what does that mean how can a man be born again we're only born once and he asks jesus this he asks him is a man to go back you know and and go back into the womb of his mother and then and then come come again and jesus says you you're thinking so carnal you're just thinking he says i say unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god and so this idea of jesus is explaining to him that except a man be born of water and of the spirit he's expressing to a man not just being born into the world but there's a different kind of a birth that's got to take place it's a spiritual birth a birth of the spirit i'm going to move this just for the sake of because i want i'm drawn to it and i don't realize that the mic is on me and so he's explaining to nicodemus what that is meaning and through his ministry he then is expressing and explaining to all those around even his disciples about this new birth that's to take place and and he's talking about how that john has come and he's preparing the way for something new for a new way that we are on the brink of a new type of relationship with god and he's trying to to to lay the foundation work while walking with his disciples and teaching them that i'm with you now here in body form but one day i'll be with you in a greater way than this i'll be with you in saint john chapter 14 we find him saying i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world so now they're having to to to really stretch their minds to stretch and to to open up their hearts to say what exactly is he saying and he's talking about the new birth and even today this idea began to to elude men even people in church people who'd studied the bible and so some said the new birth is this and some said the new birth is this and some said that the evidence of it was this and some said the evidence of it was this and in the church age book through the pages 144 through 154 brother branham takes this subject and he and he starts to go through it and he gives us multiple multiple things and any and he says things like this my pentecostal friends believe that when i call make an altar call and call for somebody to come and be born again or to receive the holy ghost they think that i'm calling to somebody who's already what they would were calling have been born again to come up and receive the baptism of the holy ghost brother branham has said that's not what i'm saying at all i'm i am saying i want them to come and receive the baptism the sinner the those that had already walked in the way everybody to hear the word faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god to hear the word of god to that that justification that that sanctification and that that baptism could all take place right there and so brother branham says several things and you can find this in your church age book in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the holy ghost it is one and the same to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the holy ghost amen what is the baptism with the holy ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of christ it is the new birth thus we are not born again by the spirit of life of jesus coming in and then subsequent to that the holy spirit coming in to give us power in verse 23 now he's talking about saint john chapter 14 verse 23 in speaking to the disciples he said we father and son will come unto him unto a person unto a man seeking thus it is the father son and holy ghost all coming in at the one time for it is one person comprising the godhead that advent took place at pentecost there aren't two comings of the spirit just one so when we see this when we read this when we hear this when we begin to search out and see that jesus wasn't speaking of i'll come to you and do one thing for you and then later i'm going to come again he's expressing to his disciples i want to take you all the way into this baptism i want to fill you with my spirit and this is to be born again or as you will hear it many times amongst the believers amongst people in church saying it's to receive the baptism of the holy ghost or the baptism of the holy spirit you say brother this is we've heard this for years but perhaps there's somebody who hasn't they'd like to be walked through those scriptures to say where's the foundation for this it's there now we read malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 and it says behold i'll send unto you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the children to the father fathers to the children lest i come smite the earth with a curse but notice and i do this for our young people i do this for our youth we recognize in scripture the spirit of elijah five times five times so we see we see the man elijah he he was he was a hairy man and he wore camels skins and ate locusts and honey he was a real wilderness man we see him a hairy man wilderness man and we see the call on his life we see him a prophet of god and we see these miracles taking place in his life and then we see as he as the lord is calling him to phase off the scene elijah the lord tells him go find elisha now elisha was a bald-headed man remember the children made fun of him and she bears came out and ate the children because they were making fun of his bald head elisha was a bald-headed man and elisha had asked elijah elijah said before i go what would you like of me and he says i would like a double portion of your spirit to come upon me elijah said you've asked a hard thing nonetheless if you see me when i go you can have this and so we see that when elijah is caught up away in this chariot of fire his mantle goes down elisha picks up his mantle and he must die it down in order to fit elijah's elijah's mantle and we see the spirit of elijah then on elisha and not only a double uh this double portion he did with what is recorded in the bibles we see four miracles recorded of elijah we see eight miracles recorded of elisha double portion so here we've got two examples of elijah and elijah but but the spirit of elijah two of them now the third we will pick up here in in well let's just read here malachi 4 5-6 behold i will send you elijah and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and i put there the third that'll be that third showing of the spirit of elijah and the heart of the children to the fathers that will be the fourth time we see the spirit of elijah to the church now in luke chapter 1 and verse 17 it's speaking about the birth of john the baptist and is speaking about his birth and his scripture records and he john shall go before him this is this is the the angel talking to his father zacharias and he john shall go before him in the spirit go go before the the lord go before the messiah in the spirit and power of elijah elias is elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord you'll notice in that scripture it's it says he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children but it doesn't mention turning the hearts of the children to the fathers that wasn't for john that was for another appearing of elijah so now in matthew chapter 17 verses 10 through 13 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias or elijah must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elijah elias truly shall first come and restore all things so now we see that couldn't have been john that he's speaking of john didn't restore all things this restoring of all things was something that was to take place in future in the future from when jesus was speaking but i say unto you that elias or elijah is come already he has come already that spirit has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of of them then the disciples then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist so when he's saying that they've already done unto him whatever whatsoever they listed they took john they they cut his head off they took him and so then they recognize oh that was john john is the one that has the spirit of elijah on him it's good it's good they were recognizing prophecy they were recognizing the word of god in their day and and and so have we in this day and age recognized god sent in elijah in this day and his job was not to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children in our day but his job was to turn the hearts of the children those who have been born again those who who have become children those who have become like babies who have been born again he is his job was to turn the hearts of those type of people back to the faith of our fathers peter james john moses elijah abraham isaac jacob our hearts are being turned back to the original word of god like it was in the beginning not believing in three gods not believing in two gods but believing that there's one true living god and that he has come and he he even has a name and he's got a person and it was the person of jesus christ so this is part of becoming like children again this is part of receiving that kingdom is being able to receive the word of god as children again so i i split this picture into three parts and on this upper right hand part this is a child in the womb before the child is born the prophet of god speaks about this situation and how that the child is warm it's in a warm comfortable place it's protected doesn't know about the harshness of the world and its environments doesn't know about that it knows comfort it knows its mother's heartbeat feels the comfort of that it's const it's in a constant temperature all the time no it's too cold it's too hot it's a constant temperature all the time very nice many of us are going oh to be a child oh the child only knew but brother branham addresses that and he says okay would you go back to that if you had the chance would you go back to that you'd never know what life has got you'd never know the grand things that are outside of the womb you'd never know how big the world is you'd never know the things that are in store you'd be so limited you'd be so limited and then a child is born and it's like this here you are standing on the edge of a precipice and there's the world and you're right on that edge and when you're born again that's what it's like you've come to a point in your life that you're at the edge and the next step is a free fall and before i get to this i want to read for you this scripture romans 6 4 speaking about the newness of life therefore we are buried with him jesus by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life the newness that comes with life the newness of being born again i go back to this picture here and many of you who've had children or have been around babies maybe you're a big sister big brother or perhaps you babysit have you ever seen that look before and i'll tell you if you ever want to evoke that look there's one sure way of doing it it's a game called peek-a-boo and peek-a-boo is a such an incredible game because for the first time if you ever do it to a child you it doesn't typically end in laughter or giggles but oftentimes it starts with crying and the reason is because the we as human beings have some are very unique we can actually tell if somebody's looking our direction or not because we've got these whites around our our pupils and around our irises the white part of our eyes and so we're very keen on being able to tell even at great distances whether somebody's looking our way or not well a baby it's vision isn't really too good for its the first few months that it's born anyway but when you get real close to it it'll be fixated on your face trying to figure out what it is what's amazing is you it's like you cover your face with your hands and it's like you went away you just disappeared but as soon as you pull those hands away real fast and you say peek-a-boo to the baby it's like they've seen you for the first time in their life and then you cover your face again and it's like you went away and you never existed again but then you pull your hands away and suddenly there you are and all your splendor and glory in front of this little child and before you know it this game is probably more more thrilling for the adult than it is the child because we love to hear the giggle that comes along with it in that excited little it's a little chipmunk chatter thing that happens and you just love that and so then you do it again they like it's this little chipmunk laugh and you've got man that's good he loves it he's like well you're loving it probably more but but they that look is it's all new again you're new to them all over again and i say that for this sake we should walk in newness of life and i want to say this for the children i don't know how many of you like riding roller coasters or going in fast cars or something where it's really kind of on edge some people really don't like it and those that like it they kind of they like that that that moment where it's right on the edge i was a bit of a thrill seeker and i loved to do those things and i thought let you know you can't and i probably have shared this here before but i thought life you know i want to live life to the fullest i want to i want to ride the most exciting ride there is to ride i want to i want to see i want to do the things that are the most thrilling things to do in life while i've got it and i i don't know i grew up in church i grew up on the pews sleeping under the pews sitting on the pews and things and i don't know i guess you you kind of see church as a tradition you see it as a ritual something that you do your family does and you just are coming along but when i received that born-again experience i don't want to tell you that it was a roller coaster ride i don't want to tell you that it was a like that edge anything like that what i want to tell you is to know the lord is beyond that it's greater than that i don't mean like you get that that upside down stomach feeling i don't mean that but when god begins to make himself real to you and you meet him you really genuinely meet him and you know him and he begins revealing himself to you amongst pages you'd looked at a million times in your lifetime but you'd never seen him you never knew him you knew about him you'd heard about him you talked about him but you didn't really know him but when you know him it's newness of life it is it jesus couldn't have put it any better when he said being born again it's it's that newness of life all over again and i i found this i thought brother branham does a nice job of putting it he says this is from god's power to transform it's an old familiar text that many of our pastors has used down through your time it's been used since it was written but yet one thing about the word of god it never grows old because it's god it never grows old through every generation now for pretty near about 2 800 years or better this word of god has been read by man priests and so forth and never does it grow old i've been reading it myself for some 35 years and each time i read it i find something new that i looked over the first time because it is inspired it is god in letter form see it's the attributes of god speaking forth and is placed on paper that's why we can read a text tonight that has been read hundreds and thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of times before in in in countless churches in countless monasteries and it's still so real and alive to us because god is a spirit and when that spirit quickens the words to strike your heart it means something new it's new life i think that this is a really good illustration of it this child just opened no doubt so many gifts i don't know if this is his birthday if this is christmas or what it is maybe he got a new bike maybe he got a new lego set maybe he got i i don't know what maybe he got a playhouse i don't know what he got but now he's opening an avocado and this child is excited about an avocado he's tearing open this avocado and he's what's what could it be what could be inside this package and he opens it up and it's a avocado thanks he knows he's had an avocado sitting on his counter for weeks probably but he got his own avocado thanks it's new it's new to him and i look at that and i think oh god people look at this old wrinkled leather bound book and they think it's just an old wrinkled book and i already know what's inside of it but when the spirit of god moves upon it it's not just a wrinkled covered book anymore it's a avocado thanks and i think about that little fetus inside of that womb and what it's about to find that life has is beyond what it could even imagine it's going to see and so i want to give you a little bit of a visual for those of you perhaps who've never been able to travel those of you who have not seen the things the variety that god has put on this earth i just want to take you through a little bit of a world tour try to go through this quickly these are the shores of france china egypt india bolivia australia bhutan i don't know where bhutan is scotland st lucia india south africa yemen namibia iceland norway croatia the philippines greece greenland for those of you that like frigid weather apparently china japan it's costa rica new zealand colorado don't have to go too far for this one peru that's machu picchu the netherlands japan again brazil argentina the grand tetons portugal ireland morocco wyoming that's yellowstone right by the tetons if you if you picked the tetons that was the place you wanted to go this is real close friends myanmar thailand i kind of like that one myself canada that's lake louise i recommend it switzerland arizona or the david there it is that's antelope uh canyon turkey hawaii namibia vietnam italy china again chile and iceland again and as i visited each of these places to get these pictures no i didn't these are from google i thought wow to see the beauty of each of these places very different even some of those places that were desert sand dunes who would think sand dunes were pretty i mean you know here we live in arizona but you know we i look at places like this iceland and i think wow you know we don't see things like this all the time and you see the variety that god has got this is what it is to explore the word of god it's that newness it's that when you open that bible and you begin to get into the word of god he can take you places in your spirit from you could be in the absolute driest time of your life and instantly it's like god can turn on the the rushing fountains and he can begin to water your life and begin you you begin to see softness come out and green leaves taking place and fellowship in your life and it can happen in an instant and god can take you through these places and and he can allow you to to visit the mountaintops and then he can take you down in the valleys to experience not not to experience the loneliness of the valley but to experience him with you in those low times that while you're in those kinds of places he's there with you that he promised i'll be with you i'll never leave thee nor will i forsake thee and you can experience that for yourself this is becoming a child this is to be born again is to experience life for the first time life with god but it's not all mountaintops and waterfalls and there's a part of being a child when your child is in a dark room and they hear strange noises and maybe they've been in a pack and play or a crib next to your bed and that's where they were sleeping bef but at some point you put them in their own room and now it's their own room now they're away from mom and away from dad a little bit and they've experienced they're experiencing the darkness without the comfort of mom and dad being right there and they come running into your room i want to sleep with you and i want to sleep with you and you say why what's what's wrong there's a monster in my closet and you tell them there's no such thing as monsters now that's not true that's not true there very much is such thing as monsters we've experienced that as an adult we know very much that there are monsters now they may not be these hairy things with with razor teeth but we know that a man possessed by satan a man who knows not the life of god can very much be a monster a man who does not know the life of christ can be a monster so one when you've been born again jesus did not let the disciples and those that followed him he didn't lead them on this path of of fairy tales and unicorns and rainbows he was equipping them because he said i'm i'm going to set you out as sheep amongst wolves he but he was not going to leave them alone in doing that but he was going to equip them for the monsters that they would have to face in life and that's what we do when we come into the into this newness of life and and everything is so exciting but with time we begin to learn the realities of life and the trials and the tribulations and the powers and principalities that we've got to come against and and we can't we we can't just uh we can't just wish it away but we can be equipped we can be equipped and there's there's so many great instances in the bible that that this reminds me of when i think of when i see this immediately my mind is david and goliath a child who god brought through a bear brought through a lion to prepare him for a goliath and this is what god can do for us it's what he does for for for for a person a young person or an old person however old you are when when god when you receive that that that born-again experience god begins he doesn't leave you alone he equips you i don't know if you can read that i don't know if i can read that this is from uh revelations chapter four number two branham says then i remember right across the street here when i was just a young man billy paul was about three years old or four and we lived just across the street and one night he wanted a drink of water it was out in the kitchen the dipper and the bucket and i said oh i was so tired i'd worked hard all day and preached half the night and he said daddy i want a drink and i said billy just go right into the kitchen there it's on the little table i said he got up rubbed his eyes looked through there he said daddy i'm afraid to go see and i said well that it's all right i said just run on honey and get a drink daddy's so tired just a little distance about to that window and he said but i'm afraid to go daddy see well i got up with the little fellow and reached over and got a hold of i got a hold of my hand and it was a good thing we hadn't walked four or five steps till he hit a rug where mita had waxed the floor and on a piece of linoleum and you know how that is and he just made a scoot but i had his hand and then he just squeezed me that much tighter and then i stood there a little bit and i thought god that's right see i don't want to make one step without you hold my hand because i don't know when i'm going to slide you see and as long as i can feel your big powerful hand grip mine i know you'll hold me up in the times of my sea so i try to make a habit of that to keep my hand in his and sometimes i've done things that seemed ridiculous in my own sight such things that seem so uh so unnatural to the human mind but if we just let it alone i found out it was the only thing that could be done to be right you know the things that don't look right here if god leads you into them they'll be right out there somewhere you see because he knows how to lead so seeing that he is our all-sufficient grace and all that we have need of or care for is in him then let's lay aside everything else besides him and hold to god's unchanging hand if you have received that born-again experience and you say oh i'm just not i'm not far along i'm not as far along and and how do i know i'm not going to i hope i don't mess up you hold to god's unchanging hand i'll tell you even the the the oldest christian you know the person you know that's that's that's known god for more years than you've been alive and you think how do they do it i'll tell you they hold to god's unchanging hand and when they can't hold god holds them when you feel sometimes you feel like i really got a hold of god's hand and then there's times where you think oh god you must had a hold of mine because i don't feel like i had a very good hold on you and that's that's the grace of god and that grace of god that will cover it'll cover it'd cover a multitude of sins that's the love of god now they've created these stories for children these stories like peter pan that's davey crockett i believe who killed the bar when he was i don't know two years old or something like that with a knife then that bottom one is john henry and the story of john henry he was born with a hammer in his hand well brother branham said it like this the children in his day knew more about davy crockett than they knew about jesus christ they hear these tall tales and they hear these stories like peter pan and the deception to that story it's this story where there's a place where children can go and never have to grow up they never have to be an adult because why why would they want to be an adult the only adult that that that peter pan knew was captain hook and who wants to grow up to be a captain hook and so they see this captain hook they see this man and he's this angry uh man who's tasted that death has come and taken a part of him and he's got a clock ticking letting him know it's just a matter of time it's just a matter of time and it's this fear of time it's this fear of death coming and getting the rest of you that it's already had a taste of you you've had you've tasted sickness before and so you know that death is out there and that ticking clock is saying death is going to get you death is going to get you and it's a fear tactic to get you to fear the grave but we as believers don't have to be wrapped up in this idea of i don't want to grow up i don't want to face the harshness of life i don't want to have to face sickness i don't want to have to face death but if god who allowed you to be born again desires you to grow and to grow in his grace and to grow in his image and to let you know you don't have to fear death you don't have to fear sickness he's already conquered sickness he's already conquered hell he's already conquered the grave for you that you can grow in grace that you can grow in jesus christ then it's no longer a fairy tale it's no longer this story uh where it's it's a mockery davy crockett killing a bear at two years old is simply a mockery of god having men like david who had faith in god that he would handle the test it's not a fairy tale story it's a very real life experience yes there's hurt we fall down there's hurt there's real hurt in transitions in life there's real hurt you're depending if you're depending on a man if you're depending on on on a professor if you're depending on a boss if you're depending on a church you're going to experience hurt there's real hurt god allows it god doesn't cause it but god allows it so that you will put your total confidence in him first corinthians 13 11 when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things we've come a long ways church we've come so far we've been given a word of god to equip us we've been given a proper interpretation of the word of god we had a prophet a divine interpreter of the word we're no longer relying upon somebody's idea upon the church's best guess upon what well the church says well down through the ages men tried to to manhandle the word of god to say i've got i've got this thing i've got this thing and unless you come through this channel you can't have the truth you're going to have to pay for it we have been restored back we have had the veil pulled off of the word of god we have been invited to come and take freely of the tree of life you have been given an opportunity in the day and age we live in we have we have received the word of god that will keep us it will keep us against denomination it will keep us against creeds it will keep us against dogmas it will keep us from being damaged by them by by by even one-man denominations from our own thinking well i think that this is the way to go but not my will but thy will be done o lord it equips us and these transitions in life they're they're you're you're always a child you're always a child and that's one of the most beautiful things that i believe has been given to the bride of jesus christ and especially in this last age is to see predestination to see that if you are a part of god you always were a part of god that as god is eternal if you've got that seed gene inside of you you're as eternal as god is and when that begins to to to to become real to us we say oh god this is why you've watched over me it's why you watched over my parents it's why you watched over my grandparents so that because i realize that you're a god who's interested in me it's very personal and here we see an instant of a young man who comes to a transition in life who's come to a point and brother branham preaches about those two two boys two rich young rulers and he takes this man as one and he takes moses as the other and he shows how both of them had come to a point of decision in their life and how that one when it came to that decision time when it came to that time in his life when the opportunity was presented to him he felt like to give up the things of the world was just too much to ask but we see that when moses was presented with that and he was presented with that when he was in the next in line to become pharaoh over the greatest nation on earth and he s he said i'd rather suffer the reproach of christ than to enjoy the riches of egypt i'm gonna i just want to read this scripture and i'm coming to a close here i didn't have enough ribbons in my bible here to have this immediately but oh here we go that's nice but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint that was my very next slide wasn't it i remember the story that was told and i i could be wrong you can cr you're free to correct me if i'm wrong but i believe it was brother dawson riley who gave his testimony and he was talking about the eagles and he and he tells the story about the eagles and we know how that brother branham talked about how that an eagle can its beak can get crusted over and how that the eagle will find its way when it's crusted over he'll find his way back to its birth rock because the eagles are born up in some of these high rocks and things some some of these eagles and they'll go back to that birth rock and they'll begin to beat their heads against the rock to get that crust off because when it crusts over it crossover so hard they can't open their beaks to eat so they essentially they starve to death and how that they beat that beak against that rock to beat all the crust off and he says quite often it's a bloody mess it's it's very violent and there's just blood everywhere and you think oh what a sad thing but that eagle begins to rejoice even in its in this mess even in this its own blood it begins to rejoice because it's free to eat again it's free to eat the good things and to begin to have life brought back to it i believe it was brother dawson in his testimony that said that there's i don't know if it's all eagles maybe he said all eagles i can't recall they go through what they call this molting stage and it's a it's a very low time in their life they're very old eagles and they go through this season in their life of depression and and they begin to lose their feathers and things and it's a very sad sad sight they go through this season in their life and if they can't get out of that they'll die if they can't overcome that period in their life they'll die they'll just give up they they lose the very purpose to be an eagle and they die but if they can when they get through that they get they they grow out these new feathers and they lose they shake out all those old ones and a lot of times they'll they'll fly to do that and to blow out the loose feathers but they'll they their beaks become shiny again and i believe his words were this i want to say it was brother dawson that when they get through it when they overcome that you can't tell the difference between that eagle and a two-year-old eagle you can't see any difference between the two of them because they've renewed their youth now we're talking about becoming as children and many of us would say well i i've received that years ago that born-again experience i received that years ago i know what you're talking about i remember those days yes brother that's fine of course i remember that but you can experience that again i i don't mean you can be born again again but what i'm saying is you can renew your youth in the lord that you don't have to when when the seasons of life and the pressures of life and the hard pressures that that that have happened to you in the trials and the tribulations it doesn't mean that you have to say well i'm just older now and i've gone through a lot and so i'll just go out and i'll just die but you can be renewed again and the prime example when i hear the message of the hour is i hear brother branham when he's praying for somebody in a prayer line and they may be over 80 years old over 80 years old now all the children in here are going that's ancient and then some of us that or some of us though some of you all that are approaching 80 are going hey wait now wait hold on a second don't write me off just yet they'll come in a prayer line and brother branham will say you know for somebody this old to come and desire a touch from the lord he says i'm reminded of abraham and sarah who were given a promise when they were old that they would have a child and god turned them back young again so that they could have a child and oh my that gives me so much joy in my heart when i see uh older ones that sit in in a church and and who who are so interested in the things of god that if you could close your eyes and you could just hear the words they're rejuvenated like a young person excited about the things of god because god doesn't get old his word doesn't get old neither does the spirit that comes with the word of god and a person in their 80s can love the word of god and receive the good things of god just like a young person can receive the good things of god i was thinking about how that the story of the eagle is that when its mouth is crusted over when he beats that crust off he's too weak to fly so the story is that the other eagles will then go out and they will gather meat and they will fly over that valley where those eagles are and they'll drop the meat down to that eagle so that that eagle can eat again now i don't believe that the eagle who's down there who's hungry it hasn't eaten i don't believe that it's sending up messages now i only take filet mignon and i only like it prepared medium rare if it's anything else i just i just can't accept it no but if those eagles bring fish that eagle's got to eat the fish if that eagle brings rabbit that eagle's got to eat rabbit now those eagles might be eagles who've gone through the process before and so maybe they've understood that in a time like this rabbit's a good meal rabbit will get you through in a time like this is going to require some fish you're going to need some fish and i say i only say that to say this god knows what you have need of it might be a sermon from the pulpit it might be it might be a song it might be a phone call it might be a visit it might be an embrace it might be shedding tears together whatever it is that god knows that you need to renew your youth to become as children he will provide it are you willing to receive it and can you see this was from the lord now we know the story of the man who was stranded because of the the flood that rose up and he was on the roof of the house and was praying god save me god i need a miracle i need the supernatural to happen now i need you to get me off of this roof out of this flood and a boat came by and it was a ranger and he said hey i got a boat get in the boat he said no no no no no go ahead go on i'm waiting for god to save me then somebody else came by on a raft said hey come on i got a raft no no no no you go on you go on i'm waiting for god to save me then a helicopter came he said i got here dropped the ladder come on up at the helicopter no no no no i'm waiting for god and then the person died they drowned and when they got to heaven they said god why didn't you save me he said i sent by a motorboat a raft in a helicopter how many times have i missed it it's like brother aaron was saying to me in the back and he repeated it out here so many times we've our bodies are weary and we're tired and we think all i need is a vacation and i thought about this recently we were planning on going on vacation i thought i'm going to need it it's been very stressful very a lot going on i thought i'm going to need it so we took the family and i we went camping and i thought this is going to be so good we're going to be out in the wilderness it's going to be just i'll tell you i just it's the the the windows of heaven are gonna open and i'm gonna be caught up into it and i left that camping trip with a pain in my neck from sleeping wrong on a camping trip that didn't leave for three or four days after we were done with the camping trip and i had to laugh we were listening to a tape on our way back from the camping trip and i couldn't hardly turn my head you know how that look is when you can't and everybody knows you have a stiff neck because you're turning your body instead of yeah i'm fine and we were listening to a tape and brother branham said you know he said this life sometimes i feel like it's a nightmare and i just want to wake up from it i just want to wake up from it lord and i had to laugh i thought boy that is so right even the best of vacations can be very painful and it's just like what are we doing here this world is so temporal this body is so fallible this body can fall apart and get aches and pains but oh god i'm waiting for that day when we wake up and oh my there's no more pain there's no more suffering there's no more none of this pressure then you talk about a vacation going on a vacation god it's not out of duty but it's out of a love affair that when i when i read the word of god and when we come together around the things of god i can open this up and say oh it's an avocado thank you lord oh my very own thank you it can be it can be i pray it is for you i pray that that we all together we can all become as children to receive the word of god let's stand together sorry i've kept you this long i just wonder if while we bowed our heads for this final word of prayer if in your heart you would just search your heart just search your life and consider what it means what this word means to you and has it lost that excitement are you in a place where you're weary where you're just you're numb from the heartache and the trials you say i want to know what that is again to see the face of god like that little child and every time that he he reveals himself be like the first time i saw him be so precious say i want that again i want i want to become like that i want to become like a child [Music] i need him to hold my hand i'm going through a very dark place right now and i need him to hold my hand i can't go there alone i can't go i can't i can't keep going down this road alone i need to feel the comfort of god's hand and maybe the hand that god would [Music] would slip into yours would be would be a brother would be a sister that that can [Music] can be a god with skin on it for you i pray that god will send an angel your way i don't i mean by an angel a messenger one of his children [Music] i know what that is to go through those dark times to feel lonely [Music] i i don't know it like some some people do i've never had hard times like when you hear stories of some we've been through some things and we know we know what it is to but above all god knows when he was hanging on the cross it was his very children that were crying for his blood he knew when he was there on the cross hanging there and he was crying out before god my god my god why hast thou forsaken me he felt forsaken by all perhaps you've tasted a little bit of that in your life and you feel you've been forsaken even by god i want you to know [Music] that he went from that place and he went in power he went down to the gates of hell he took all of our sin and all of our sorrow and all of our loneliness and he carried it down there and he opened up the gates of hell and he threw him in there he said it was finished satan thought he was just a man maybe even a prophet but he had no idea [Music] that death had just struck something that was greater that was the life of god now though he went down he couldn't stay down for the power of god that was in jesus christ rose him up again and he took others with him and i want you to know that that same power of jesus christ the same life of god it's here and it can bring you from a low place it can bring you from a sickness it can bring you from a loneliness he can bring you from a place of feeling forsaken and he can you can raise up victorious again i want you to know that heavenly father lord i know lord i know that you are still a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart that god you hear our very cry from our innermost parts though we would never even mutter a word you've walked the corridors of our hearts and you know the very desires in our hearts even before we ask it but oh god i pray now that as you walk those alleyways of our hearts as you open every door and as each individual would say god i'm opening these doors and i want you to come in and i want you to be lord over all of my heart every avenue every door every room every corner i want you to take it because i can't do it alone anymore i pray lord jesus that you would go in there and that the light of god would would lighten up every room and every alleyway and every every corner and crevice of each heart here that god that light would shine and cast darkness away and that god you would raise them up victorious again that god that newness of life could come that lord your word says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles god those are your words that is your holy word and we believe it and lord we've come and we've waited and we're waiting upon you and lord jesus we believe that we can leave this place by faith we've already got the purchase power of receiving the end result and god by faith we claim it tonight we've waited upon you now lord jesus i ask with jim would you raise them up would you help them to mount up on these wings as eagles that god in these next few days as they begin to meditate upon you and upon your word and they begin to call upon your name the lord as it becomes real to them not just a sunday thing but lord through the week they say jesus i need you lord jesus would you come lord jesus become as children i pray god you grant them their hearts desires heal the sick lord god as you've always done god renew our youth we love you we ask these things we thank you lord we thank you god for for the work that's been done we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as an ego oh they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not fade teach me teach me [Music] knees [Music] [Applause] [Music] teach me not to rely on what others do but to wait in prayer for an answer [Music] teach me [Music] would lord put up psalms 23 i wonder how many times this psalms has been read quoted thought of but it still has the same effective as when david wrote it amen psalms 23 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want david learned this as a child i just called out mommy and daddy came and read it let's go through all the verses he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leave me behind the still waters as he was talking i thought back of our our children how we we did our best all we could he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake he says and then he grew up a little bit life went on yea though i walk through the valley of shadow of death [Music] he went through some hard times he went through things that turned around he wondered but something he said i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me and then you prepared a table in the presence of my enemies david could write this because he saw it happen stage of life he says thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runeth over sometimes i ask the lord remind me remind me just one more time and then surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever there's going to be a change and we're going home amen but there's that stage of life and everyone goes through it as he was talking about those 80 and i thought i don't know for sure but i know mom's 86 and dad's 85 and i know their desire and their that that that that god placed in their heart from as young people they recognize it's it's still there how many times to talk with dad and he says just looking toward that day just drawing pulling this one it doesn't go it's eternal amen but as he was saying that i was thinking about those things in psalms 23 came how many times that that song's been read uh hundreds of thousands of times all over the whole world and it still has effective power in it it's not losses and then i thought of this song as i walk uh say let me get it jesus hold my hand as i travel through this this pilgrim land there's a friend who walks with me lead me safely through the singing sand it's the christ of calvary if we can get the words up to them this would be my prayer dear lord each day help me do the best i can for i need thy light to guide me day and night blessed jesus hold my hand as i travel through this building land there is a friend who walks there holds me safely through [Music] do oh best i can for i need thy light to guide me day and night blessed jesus hold on [Music] and [Music] my oh lord look down on me when i heal in prayer i know i'll meet you there oh precious jesus [Music] oh [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] all through this pilgrimage [Music] [Applause] me when i'm i know i'll meet you there oh blessed jesus [Music] foreign [Music] this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] jesus and when you say blitz jesus hold my hand stick your hand out so you can come and take it sometimes you say hold my hand we got him in our pockets sometimes he got to hold my hand and gun behind ourselves but no lord here i want to reach out thinking about when brother reggie was talking about with the kids growing up i i remember when we first i told his daughters were born and we had a mobile home and one bedroom was on one side and the other bedroom was on the far side and they now slept in the other room and thank god for a good mama because daddy would fall asleep you know but it was interesting because naomi would come from that room to our room and then i would wake up with her face right here going daddy daddy wake up daddy wake up boy did daddy wake up elizabeth woke up in the neighborhood heard about her coming down the hallway and she would tell herself elizabeth walk because she'd start running and daddy would say elizabeth walk every child is different every childhood but you know what you know why they came to you and came to daddy and mama's room because daddy and mommy would take care of them they had that confidence in lord no matter how i get there let me get there no matter how i do let me go to where you're at lord and i know you'll meet with me and i appreciate that lord you enjoy the word of the lord today you appreciate brother reggie coming and sharing that amen i do but sometimes sometimes it's good to be reminded as a child to take us back home and may that experience with god be
