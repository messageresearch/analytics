[31:59] Flagstaff I don't know if brother Aaron
[32:01] already welcomed you and greeted you but
[32:04] consider this another one God bless you
[32:06] I met him out outside here in the um in
[32:09] the fellowship
[32:10] hall and um I don't
[32:13] see any other visitors Kurt brother Kurt
[32:17] you're not a visitor sister Olivia God
[32:19] bless you it's good it's good to have
[32:21] you with
[32:22] us special blessing as I said that we
[32:26] get to hear at
[32:28] testimony I don't know there's probably
[32:30] 50 between 50 and 60 people here in this
[32:33] room tonight every single one of us has
[32:35] a testimony and every there's no
[32:38] testimony any greater than any other one
[32:40] some testimonies might relate to my life
[32:43] some testimonies might relate to your
[32:46] life but they are all testimonies of how
[32:49] God came down and lit the fire in our
[32:52] lives there was one man that um he was
[32:56] blunt blind I believe he's born
[32:59] blind Jesus came to
[33:03] him talks to
[33:05] him he uh Jesus does a very strange
[33:08] thing he he he spits on the ground and
[33:10] he makes some mud and he takes that mud
[33:13] and he puts it over the Man's
[33:16] eyes and he says now go wash in the pool
[33:20] and the man received his sight and he
[33:22] didn't know who prayed for him so then
[33:25] he's going around and everybody seeing
[33:27] this man that they knew was blind and
[33:29] and the priests come to him and they
[33:33] knew who did it they knew it was this
[33:36] man Jesus called
[33:38] Christ so they go to the parents and
[33:42] they're like who did this what what
[33:44] happened to this man and his parents are
[33:46] like um because they were about to be
[33:48] excommunicated from the temple the
[33:50] parents was like well don't ask us he's
[33:52] old enough he was like 40 years old ask
[33:54] him so the priest go to him
[33:57] and they're like they asked who did this
[34:00] to you who healed you and and are you
[34:04] worshiping this man of be elub and all
[34:06] that and he says
[34:08] listen he says you say that he's a
[34:11] sinner he says I don't know he says I
[34:15] don't know if he's a sinner I don't know
[34:16] if he's a saint he says but what I do
[34:19] know is once I was blind and now I can
[34:24] see now that is our testimony we heard
[34:29] about the woman at the well this morning
[34:31] how she she met this man this
[34:35] Messiah and he starts telling you have
[34:38] had five husbands and the one that
[34:40] you're living with now she says
[34:43] Whoa she says I perceive that you're a
[34:46] prophet she said the
[34:48] Messiah is supposed to tell us these
[34:50] things and he says I he and then that
[34:54] sister she goes out and through through
[34:57] her testimony her testimony through her
[35:00] testimony she goes back to her town and
[35:02] she starts witnessing come see a man who
[35:06] told me what I have
[35:08] done isn't this the very
[35:11] Messiah and here they come and they
[35:13] started coming to Jesus from that
[35:16] sister's testimony so we see this book
[35:20] this book right here is full of
[35:22] testimonies and one of the one of the
[35:25] greatest things about this book
[35:27] is when Revelation chap 22 was written
[35:29] and the last verse was pinned and they
[35:31] put the period there it didn't end those
[35:34] testimonies continued and they've
[35:36] continued now for over 2,000 years and
[35:39] they're still coming and we are going to
[35:41] hear another testimony tonight of how
[35:44] the candle got lit brother Ron let's all
[35:48] stand brother Ron
[35:52] glidewell if you've been around the
[35:54] Tucson Tabernacle for very long you know
[35:57] the glidewell family they've been
[35:59] pillars in the church for a long time
[36:02] brother Ron not only has he been a
[36:05] blessing I'm sure to many people here
[36:07] he's been a blessing to me he's been a
[36:08] friend and and real encouragement to me
[36:12] over the past year and a half or so and
[36:15] I'm honored to introduce our brother
[36:20] brother Ron
[36:21] glidewell and he can tell us how that
[36:25] candle that's burning in his heart got
[36:28] lit brother
[36:34] Ron let me just pray for a minute Close
[36:38] Our
[36:39] Eyes Heavenly Father we come before you
[36:43] truly humbly searching our motives Lord
[36:46] that we bring no attention to
[36:48] ourselves but Lord that we would
[36:50] encourage those that that struggle some
[36:54] Lord that maybe have a sorted past even
[36:57] those Lord that I think they're good and
[37:00] that we all need salvation amen and Lord
[37:04] may you use me in these words that I may
[37:07] encourage those that that are
[37:10] questioning their
[37:11] salvation that know someone or
[37:15] themselves father that that just need a
[37:17] closer walk with you which we know we
[37:21] all need to draw closer to you Lord so I
[37:24] pray that you would just inspire me and
[37:27] and if not Lord just allow me to to
[37:31] encourage I thank you Lord Jesus for
[37:35] this in your wonderful and precious name
[37:38] amen you can be seated if you
[37:42] like um am I speaking loud enough into
[37:46] the
[37:47] microphone I know I've sit where you are
[37:49] so many times and we have people that
[37:51] you know they turn their head and they
[37:53] talk and you can't hear them so I
[37:56] thought well well I could criticize him
[37:59] or what if I'm up there
[38:03] someday so so you know I'm I'm very um
[38:07] cognant of the fact that those that put
[38:10] forth the effort to to to have this
[38:12] church to to take the time to to learn
[38:16] the songs to uh use their talents uh the
[38:20] pastor the musicians the everyone that
[38:23] puts forth the effort it it it didn't
[38:26] just happen you know you just don't
[38:27] drive down the street and everything is
[38:29] just there someone made the effort and I
[38:33] would just like to thank those myself
[38:35] that I appreciate that there's always
[38:39] there's always been someone there's
[38:40] always been a witness you know
[38:43] throughout the ages and the generations
[38:45] God never let the light go completely
[38:47] out um he's always been
[38:51] faithful um I have a few scriptures
[38:54] written down that I try to have have
[38:56] some kind of a theme to my
[38:58] testimony but
[39:02] uh I believe as
[39:04] I found my way back to God of course he
[39:08] never lost me I was just out of his
[39:13] will and it's it's
[39:16] so it's it's difficult where do I
[39:21] began I I was raised in a in a Christian
[39:25] home I have to excuse me here I have an
[39:28] issue with my right eye so I have these
[39:31] magnifying glasses I can
[39:34] read but
[39:37] uh if we go to se brother if we go to
[39:40] Second
[39:42] Timothy
[39:44] 3:15 i' like to just read that
[39:49] scripture if I can find
[39:55] it
[40:05] see second
[40:11] Timothy and it reads like
[40:14] this and from and from that child thou H
[40:19] has known the holy
[40:23] scriptures from that as a child that has
[40:25] known the holy SP scriptures which are
[40:28] able to make thee wise unto salvation
[40:30] through faith which is in Christ
[40:35] Jesus even
[40:38] though I many
[40:40] times did not obey God's
[40:43] word many
[40:45] times I wasn't sure if it was for
[40:49] me but my mom and my dad were faithful
[40:52] to take me to
[40:54] church and to do the best they could to
[40:56] teach me the word of God
[40:59] Amen and I encourage you that have
[41:03] families bring your kids to
[41:07] church read them the
[41:10] bible teach them the word of
[41:14] God and you know they might not show
[41:19] any any sign of anything I know my my
[41:21] three daughters I my I preached them on
[41:24] the way to church and the way to home
[41:26] and theyd sit in church you know what
[41:27] they said we don't remember any of
[41:30] it
[41:32] wow it's
[41:34] okay they're under the token now those
[41:37] of you that have heard the message you
[41:39] know what I'm talking
[41:41] about but it took a while for me to get
[41:44] there to understand
[41:48] this as a child
[41:51] I'm I'll be 70 years old my birthday in
[41:55] May
[41:57] and so many times I saywell
[41:59] Lord I've missed my opportunity to do
[42:02] anything for
[42:03] you but because I was taught the word of
[42:08] God I remember
[42:12] Moses I got 10 more years to go before
[42:15] I'm ready to serve you know he was 80
[42:17] years old when God
[42:19] finally when he went to Egypt to bring
[42:23] them out and he was preparing him to
[42:25] that point you know some of
[42:29] us start at an early
[42:32] age some of us start
[42:36] later so whatever age you are and you
[42:39] think well I've done nothing for God
[42:42] there's still
[42:44] hope because I believe we all have a
[42:48] testimony we all have a responsibility
[42:51] to share what we have that's right amen
[42:54] uh how do how do I serve God I remember
[42:57] brother green was he was trying to to
[42:59] get
[43:01] every aspect of serving God and he says
[43:05] well those of you that sing loud he says
[43:07] uh Inspire those around you to sing and
[43:10] praise God uh and he was trying to get
[43:13] everybody to inspire someone
[43:15] else uh he said if if you uh and I I'll
[43:19] share this I he said if you have a
[43:22] complex and brother brandham said this
[43:24] he says go the opposite way
[43:27] and quite frankly I
[43:30] was my I don't want you to be afraid of
[43:33] me because I was so rebellious I I um
[43:38] some of the people really didn't want to
[43:39] be around
[43:40] me and uh so I had a complex as you as
[43:44] you decide you know Lord I'm I'm going
[43:46] to serve you I'm I I can't be a sinner
[43:48] it just doesn't work for
[43:50] me and you have a complex that nobody
[43:54] likes you well
[43:56] they didn't shake my hand they didn't
[43:58] say God bless
[44:00] you and so brother green gets up and
[44:03] preaches see that's how God works is
[44:04] through
[44:05] preachers if you want to know if if
[44:08] you're having an issue you're reading
[44:09] the Bible and you're you're by yourself
[44:11] and you're praying as the Lord give go
[44:13] to church and listen to what the pastor
[44:15] has to
[44:18] say maybe talk to your brothers and
[44:20] sisters maybe a brother or sister says
[44:22] you know I had that same
[44:23] circumstance we're a family
[44:26] we're not meant to be alone I think that
[44:29] was established with with
[44:31] Adam he he didn't want to be
[44:33] alone now I I will skip around from so
[44:36] just got to bear with me but you know
[44:38] Adam didn't want to be alone I'm sure
[44:41] Adam as he was in the garden I've
[44:44] thought about this stuff many times and
[44:46] pondered
[44:47] it don't you know he saw Mr and Mrs
[44:52] bear they'd have a little cub and why
[44:56] that's so wonderful you know I had him
[44:59] had a heart you know see the Lions you
[45:02] know the Mr and Mrs lion and they have
[45:04] the little cubs oh my aren't they
[45:07] cute and kind of like job it kind of
[45:09] dawned on
[45:11] me where's my other
[45:14] half and God saw this need and said it's
[45:18] not good for him to be
[45:20] alone and I think that's that's all of
[45:23] us it's not good to be alone don't don't
[45:26] let Satan isolate
[45:28] you you know you need the
[45:31] fellowship you know because it's so easy
[45:34] for us to be alone and read our Bible
[45:37] and come off with some little idea that
[45:40] is so far-fetched that's right and it
[45:44] happens whereas I've done it where I I
[45:47] thought my this is this I think I
[45:50] understand what this
[45:51] means and uh well if I get a chance I'm
[45:54] going to tell somebody
[45:56] and then I get to search in a
[45:59] quote and as you searching quotes I end
[46:02] up reading the whole
[46:04] book
[46:06] wow he explained what I thought I knew
[46:09] and I was wrong
[46:12] wow we need to do that be be humble
[46:15] don't you know if God has revealed
[46:18] something that's the word if it's in the
[46:22] word of God put away your own
[46:24] understanding amen amen you know it'll
[46:26] get you into
[46:27] trouble like I thought nobody liked me
[46:30] nobody and if you if you put out that
[46:33] attitude then nobody will like you
[46:35] that's right you know and and those of
[46:37] you know here I'm a pest I'll walk up to
[46:40] you if you if you got your back to me
[46:42] I'll grab your arm and shake your hand
[46:45] what I'm doing is I'm I'm fighting
[46:48] that that that thing that would that
[46:50] would bother me I'm putting it
[46:52] down I'm not allowing that because I I
[46:55] was will show myself friendly that's
[46:57] good you know may maybe you just you
[46:59] were busy talking to somebody and say go
[47:02] well they they didn't want to talk to
[47:03] you I hope this helps and these are some
[47:07] of the things that that I've learned you
[47:08] know make yourself
[47:11] friendly
[47:13] uh get to know people get out of your
[47:15] little oh I'm preaching
[47:18] now get out of your click and go go
[47:21] mingle with somebody else I've done this
[47:24] for years and and uh we had a group that
[47:28] would meet on the North side after
[47:29] church and we had a group that would
[47:30] meet in here and a group would meet
[47:32] outside and some of the parking lot and
[47:34] I realized I wasn't get to fellowship
[47:36] with all my brothers and sisters so I'd
[47:38] make my
[47:40] rounds and I I I had to do that I had
[47:45] another brother that I I really held him
[47:48] in high esteem but my brother wouldn't
[47:50] give me the time of
[47:52] day and I just I thought well you know
[47:55] what he don't like
[47:57] me and I pondered this and what it does
[48:00] it puts bitterness in your
[48:04] heart and something this is where the
[48:06] Holy Ghost comes in this is how you know
[48:08] if you have the Holy Spirit or not
[48:10] something says what have you
[48:13] done what have you done to cause that
[48:16] brother to to even acknowledge you
[48:20] amen okay well I changed my
[48:24] attitude I'm going to get that brother's
[48:26] attention and I'm going to be his
[48:29] friend and I'll tell you
[48:32] what that brother I'll tell you who it
[48:35] was it was brother
[48:37] yoro and I have a 10th grade education I
[48:41] can't talk to him but you know
[48:44] what but you know when it comes to the
[48:46] word of
[48:47] God we're all the same we're all equals
[48:52] absolutely and I made an effort to make
[48:54] him my friend that's good and uh we had
[48:58] attended brother Mark's church for a
[48:59] while and he had some special meetings
[49:01] brother yoro came up and who did he seek
[49:04] out to confide in to talk
[49:08] to that's good amen you know listen to
[49:12] God it might take a
[49:15] while but his he doesn't he won't Lead
[49:17] You
[49:18] astray he will
[49:21] not so like I said from a child
[49:26] I was taught the holy
[49:29] scriptures and it never leaves you it
[49:33] never really
[49:34] does I'll try
[49:36] to condense some of this
[49:40] but we' were raised in in
[49:43] denominations and
[49:45] U I was told by my aunts and my uncles
[49:49] and different ones you have a
[49:51] gift yeah
[49:54] right I've heard this my whole
[49:58] life and I I didn't believe them I
[50:01] thought they were just being
[50:04] nice but I do remember that we would go
[50:07] to these these little special meetings
[50:09] and I
[50:10] was I was born in Los Angeles California
[50:13] and we moved soon afterwards we moved
[50:15] back to my mom and dad's Hometown in
[50:16] Arkansas so I spent several years in
[50:18] Arkansas in the small towns and that are
[50:20] not domination meetings
[50:22] and I remember we were shitari
[50:27] we were
[50:28] right if you didn't believe like we did
[50:31] you're going to
[50:32] hell and I heard this so much as a
[50:36] child my my mother's dad was a he was an
[50:39] alcoholic and he' been in prison Tucker
[50:42] Farm in Arkansas and I love that guy
[50:44] because he loved
[50:46] me my other grandpa he was a Christian
[50:49] but he gave me he didn't give me the
[50:50] time of day so who did I gravitate
[50:53] to wow very good
[50:56] who did I gravitate to so he was The
[50:59] Bootlegger of the town he used to take
[51:01] me in his a little car we go out in the
[51:03] sticks and he said I don't tell nobody
[51:05] where I'm keeping my Hooch oh sir
[51:08] Grandpa how was I he he's the first one
[51:11] that got me addicted to ice cream you
[51:14] know we had a it my Grandpa he was the
[51:17] alcoholic but he treated me so kindly
[51:19] and loving so and he hadn't treated my
[51:23] mom so nice I know she's watching this
[51:26] sorry
[51:28] Mom but he sure treated me
[51:31] nice and I love that
[51:33] man and I remember I would hear these
[51:36] people talk about yeah they drink beer
[51:37] they're going to hell they smoke
[51:39] cigarettes they're going to
[51:41] hell well here I am a six seven year old
[51:43] little boy saying I don't want my
[51:46] grandpa to go to
[51:48] hell I'm a child I hadn't even given my
[51:51] heart to the Lord yet and I'm already
[51:53] it's in my heart
[51:55] I don't want him to go to hell I love
[51:57] him he's my grandpa you see I believe
[52:00] the seat of God is in
[52:02] us if we're in the mind of God and he
[52:05] we're manifested in this time we are
[52:07] already sons of God we just don't know
[52:09] it yet and if we look back before that
[52:12] we finally say Lord I
[52:15] Surrender he was working with
[52:18] us I've heard him say that you know God
[52:21] is God was good to me
[52:24] today
[52:26] I believe that you know Revelation is
[52:28] something that God gives you
[52:31] personal it makes it personal to
[52:35] you I am persuaded God's always been
[52:38] good to
[52:39] me when I hear that I wonder well wasn't
[52:41] he good to you the other day was he good
[52:43] to you when you were born I can see he's
[52:46] had the hand on me ever since I was
[52:49] born I have issues that when I was
[52:53] born um quite frankly it was uh quite a
[52:58] quite an ordeal I won't go into details
[53:00] on it but it it it affected me most of
[53:02] my life of being
[53:04] ashamed and to be be shy I I failed many
[53:07] classes in school because I just when it
[53:10] come time to get up on the chalkboard I
[53:12] would just froze up and I wouldn't look
[53:13] at anybody and I was ashamed of who I
[53:16] was and it it it's a horrible thing to
[53:19] put that on your your children you know
[53:23] to put it on anyone that has something
[53:27] you know maybe they're not just like you
[53:29] but don't do that don't do that it it it
[53:34] caused me to to lean
[53:36] toward the devil wanted me to
[53:39] be part of his crew and so he befriended
[53:43] me and I was a little child
[53:46] and well the
[53:48] Christians I think I believe in God I
[53:51] always as as a child I'm going to
[53:53] confess I never doubted there was a God
[53:57] I just didn't believe he loved
[53:59] me I had no doubt there was a
[54:02] God he don't love
[54:04] me and I always wondered what's going to
[54:08] happen when I
[54:10] die you know because I've been taught if
[54:13] that if I don't serve God I'm going to
[54:15] hell you know they taught it pretty hard
[54:18] in
[54:18] Pentecost it is the truth but the
[54:21] hardness they had was just if you don't
[54:24] believe it just like we
[54:27] do and I remember as a child we had
[54:30] taken a trip to Oklahoma to uh visit my
[54:35] grandmother's sister wow they were
[54:38] Oneness they're totally off the
[54:43] base and trinitarians we got the
[54:47] truth see this is I'm leading up to
[54:49] something
[54:51] that so many people think they're right
[54:54] and someone else's is wrong truth is
[54:56] they were both wrong that's right that's
[54:59] good but we go we go and we get up to
[55:02] Oklahoma where my grandmother's people
[55:04] were
[55:06] from and uh they had already went to
[55:09] church so we walked in the church was
[55:11] full they were having a
[55:13] Revival I've been to revivals before I'm
[55:16] just a little boy and I remember well to
[55:19] talk about Aunt Johnny she's won this we
[55:21] she's sure a nice person but they sure
[55:22] got their doct and wrong and it went on
[55:24] and on and on I heard this the whole way
[55:26] up there oh man and I'm just a child but
[55:29] I'm listening yeah amen and we get there
[55:35] and these people are singing the same
[55:36] songs we
[55:38] sing they get the ladies had the long
[55:41] hair and they had the dresses and the
[55:42] brothers were dressed like my dad and
[55:45] like wow they look just like we do
[55:48] singing the same song and they were
[55:50] worshiping God with all their
[55:52] heart and I'll be honest with you it
[55:55] confused
[55:56] me wow how could they be so wrong
[55:59] they're doing exactly the same thing we
[56:01] do wow amen and you know as we got older
[56:07] and realized that that both them were
[56:09] wrong on their Doctrine but most of it
[56:11] was just wrong in their
[56:13] Spirit you
[56:15] know um and I've encountered people
[56:19] today and told them this story and they
[56:21] still defend the well the Oneness are
[56:23] radicals
[56:26] really if I'm not mistaken the Catholic
[56:29] Church killed people for not believing
[56:31] their
[56:33] Doctrine oh well I think that's
[56:37] radical so you know as we go
[56:42] along we need to have connection with
[56:44] God and let him lead us let him lead us
[56:46] to truth you know it it I am so
[56:52] grateful that that he led me to this
[56:54] message that's right but as a child uh
[56:59] we went my dad we went to all the
[57:01] meetings dad was looking for
[57:04] something and we went to we moved back
[57:06] to Los Angeles when I was seven and uh
[57:09] from there we moved over here when I was
[57:11] 12 you know for a child though that that
[57:14] amount of time is a
[57:16] lifetime and we went to these meetings
[57:18] and I kept hearing the same thing you
[57:21] know that we went to TL osbor meeting at
[57:25] the Cow Palace I think brother brand
[57:27] preached there also and I love going to
[57:29] his because he had films I love I was
[57:32] dicted to television from the time first
[57:34] time ever watched it and man we got he
[57:37] had this huge
[57:39] screen and they did films especially his
[57:42] uh missionary work in India wow and then
[57:44] he did a good job I mean it is like
[57:46] watching a movie and man I I like going
[57:49] to TL osburns you know it did I seen you
[57:52] know they'd show the paganism in India
[57:54] then he show you know they'd have a
[57:56] people giving their heart to the Lord
[57:57] and and uh you know he was he he was a
[58:00] good he was a good man to to get you to
[58:03] think about your salvation and your
[58:04] Eternal
[58:05] destination and as a child I guess I was
[58:08] about eight or nine I'm not sure
[58:11] which and he started talking about you
[58:14] know you continue this way you're you're
[58:17] going to end up in destruction and you
[58:20] won't have
[58:21] a when you die you won't you're GNA meet
[58:26] destruction you know he had a way of
[58:27] saying and something in my heart said oh
[58:31] my but it also is he he wanted he says
[58:35] give your heart to the Lord
[58:37] Jesus that this man died on
[58:41] calary so that you don't have to go
[58:44] through that if you give your heart to
[58:47] this Lord Jesus he'll save you that's
[58:51] pretty simple isn't it my little heart I
[58:54] listened to it and Mom and Dad had no
[58:56] idea what's going on we're standing
[58:57] there and I'd already determined well
[59:00] I've been to these Services many times
[59:03] he's going to give an alter call well
[59:05] I'm like the guy on a you're going to do
[59:07] the 50 yard dash I'm at the blocks I'm
[59:10] ready you know when he gives it I'm
[59:14] going and I remember they give the
[59:16] invitation and I had to push my mom and
[59:18] my little sister my dad I where are you
[59:20] going I'm going up front I'm going to
[59:23] give my heart to the Lord Jesus
[59:26] and I remember I ran to the to the front
[59:29] of course there's hundreds of them and
[59:31] at that time you know when we had those
[59:34] meetings people gave their heart to the
[59:36] Lord by the hundreds that's right it
[59:38] it's becoming more difficult just a sign
[59:40] of the times the men are hardened
[59:43] amen but I remember
[59:46] that just you can't put into
[59:50] words as a
[59:52] child when God
[59:55] come into my
[59:56] heart and I
[59:59] knew beyond a shadow of Doubt at that
[1:00:03] moment he had accepted my My
[1:00:08] Confession and science can they can say
[1:00:11] whatever they want to they haven't
[1:00:13] experienced it they're showing their
[1:00:15] ignorance I have been saved by the Lord
[1:00:17] Jesus
[1:00:18] Christ he saved me from my sins he
[1:00:21] lifted that guilt of sin off the this
[1:00:24] that little boy's
[1:00:26] heart and I was
[1:00:29] persuaded it was rather selfish I said
[1:00:32] Lord you need to come right now I'm
[1:00:35] ready that's how sure I
[1:00:38] was and that was the beginning of my
[1:00:40] conversion but it obviously had started
[1:00:42] years
[1:00:43] before and I like teal urn you know
[1:00:46] brother Brenham lik teal
[1:00:48] urn and he was a good
[1:00:50] man I believe he God used him many Souls
[1:00:55] were one to the kingdom of God and many
[1:00:58] Souls that through his ministry also
[1:01:01] believe the
[1:01:03] message and but here's the
[1:01:07] problem went back to
[1:01:09] school we had no youth
[1:01:13] program mom and dad
[1:01:16] didn't dad he he liked going to his room
[1:01:19] alone and reading his Bible and
[1:01:21] praying and then Mom would do her thing
[1:01:23] and
[1:01:25] uh it was you know go outside
[1:01:28] play and then of course none of my most
[1:01:30] of my friends at church were catholic I
[1:01:32] mean not church but at school we're
[1:01:34] Catholic or they were just
[1:01:37] huls so I didn't have any
[1:01:43] support I'm just a
[1:01:46] child but God had started the work in my
[1:01:51] heart and I didn't know what to do
[1:01:55] so I just went right back to the same
[1:01:58] little boy had always been you know
[1:01:59] playing rough and hard with my friends
[1:02:01] and you know we and amongst our little
[1:02:04] friends we'd swear and you know carry on
[1:02:06] and be silly and I knew God wasn't happy
[1:02:09] with
[1:02:11] that and each time though that we would
[1:02:13] go to church and as I got
[1:02:15] older I remember my aunt she was a woman
[1:02:18] preacher she says you need to receive
[1:02:19] the Holy Spirit Well I did so she tried
[1:02:23] to get me to say I forget what she tried
[1:02:25] to get me to say say it faster and
[1:02:27] faster and faster and my grandmother had
[1:02:29] her hands on me and I was just
[1:02:30] surrounded you know and they were going
[1:02:33] to get me prayed through the Holy
[1:02:35] Spirit and well you got
[1:02:39] it okay well I remembered when I got
[1:02:43] saved I didn't got
[1:02:45] it not
[1:02:48] yet and it was just
[1:02:50] a it wasn't time yet it wasn't time time
[1:02:54] I I had to go through some some hard
[1:02:58] times and so I became quite frankly
[1:03:02] disillusioned with the denominational
[1:03:04] church that we were going to and um they
[1:03:08] had a lot of the old-timers had been uh
[1:03:11] partakers of that first outpouring you
[1:03:13] know theza Street and brother Aaron the
[1:03:15] older ones knows what I'm talking
[1:03:17] about and I i' those men really really
[1:03:21] had an experience and I knew the
[1:03:23] difference
[1:03:25] uh we had a brother Thompson he was a
[1:03:27] World War I
[1:03:29] veteran and they would ask him we had a
[1:03:31] testimony service on Wednesday night and
[1:03:34] my he he was so enthused about how God
[1:03:38] had saved him through World War one and
[1:03:41] uh he still had that
[1:03:44] fire and he's the first man I've ever
[1:03:47] seen die in front of me he got up and I
[1:03:50] remember he was given one of his
[1:03:52] testimonies he was just on fire
[1:03:55] and they had a row of chairs that said
[1:03:57] on the right that' be your right and on
[1:04:01] each side we had the pastor and his wife
[1:04:03] they sat up front
[1:04:04] together and uh he sat
[1:04:08] down and we got up when we sang a song
[1:04:11] like we do it's just it's traditional
[1:04:12] I'll fly away and he
[1:04:16] did he did he sat there and took his
[1:04:20] last
[1:04:22] breath and that was it somebody said
[1:04:24] said brother Thompson's not breathing
[1:04:26] well his daughter was an RN
[1:04:28] nurse of course it didn't take long my
[1:04:31] dad's
[1:04:33] dead and I'm sitting up there watching
[1:04:37] wow I just seen my first dead
[1:04:40] person and because of the influence that
[1:04:43] television had on me about death and
[1:04:46] ghost and stuff I couldn't sleep all
[1:04:50] night I'd lay awake and I'd hear
[1:04:52] something and oh that's his ghost he's
[1:04:54] come to haunt me you know you know your
[1:04:56] you old child has these imaginations and
[1:04:59] and these fears and and S plays on that
[1:05:02] with a child and I didn't understand
[1:05:04] what had happened I should have been
[1:05:06] like my but now I have a different
[1:05:10] opinion you know if the Lord would let
[1:05:13] me get up and rattle on about my
[1:05:16] testimony and I was to sit down and
[1:05:19] die praise the Lord I'm okay with it
[1:05:27] don't no I I've had that discussion you
[1:05:30] know I've spent many times I drove a
[1:05:31] truck and I spent a lot of time
[1:05:33] alone and I I was persuaded that you
[1:05:36] know if the Lord asked me to give my
[1:05:38] life for him as a
[1:05:39] martyr I what else better thing I could
[1:05:43] do amen
[1:05:46] but as I thought on those thoughts
[1:05:49] something says that is an age we're
[1:05:51] living
[1:05:53] in I did I'm not calling my bride and
[1:05:57] the people of this age to die for
[1:06:00] me I'm calling them to live for me yes
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:05] [Applause]
[1:06:08] amen and brothers and
[1:06:11] sisters being a martyr would be so much
[1:06:14] easier
[1:06:18] true it's
[1:06:21] tough and I I Now understand how easy
[1:06:24] easy it was for those people to be a
[1:06:25] martyr remember the story about the
[1:06:28] Roman soldier they were pushing him off
[1:06:29] the
[1:06:30] cliff and uh one man went up and I'm not
[1:06:34] going to do this and that Roman soldier
[1:06:36] says I have witnessed these people
[1:06:39] gladly praising and singing as they give
[1:06:41] their life and he takes they said that
[1:06:44] he took off his armor took off his and
[1:06:46] he says I'll take your place and he
[1:06:47] jumped
[1:06:49] off that
[1:06:52] testimony is a strong
[1:06:55] testimony but that's not the age we live
[1:06:58] in we're asked to do something much
[1:07:02] harder every devil in hell is against
[1:07:06] you amen he will do every trick he knows
[1:07:11] you inside and out he mimics your own
[1:07:13] voice and your
[1:07:15] thoughts and he will lie to you he will
[1:07:20] there's it just goes and your mind gets
[1:07:24] so confused and cluttered this is why
[1:07:26] you need to read your Bible and
[1:07:31] pray I know myself I as a child I had my
[1:07:35] nightmares and I still do sometimes and
[1:07:38] it's like you're when you wake up it's
[1:07:40] like you were
[1:07:41] there but I tell you what you go into
[1:07:44] your place you kneel down and pray and
[1:07:48] when you get up you're not afraid of
[1:07:50] anything what a change huh you can
[1:07:52] change the atmosphere right it's good
[1:07:55] you
[1:07:57] can but as I
[1:07:59] got more influence from from
[1:08:03] Evil I had a most of my dad's family
[1:08:07] lived in Los Angeles because after World
[1:08:09] War I they there was a construction boom
[1:08:12] in the LA area my my uncle was a
[1:08:15] contractor so they all worked for him
[1:08:17] and my grandpa and everybody moved to
[1:08:19] Los Angeles so they still most of them
[1:08:22] were there when
[1:08:24] when I was a
[1:08:26] child and of course you know by my
[1:08:29] grandpa kind
[1:08:31] of leaning me toward
[1:08:34] the unchristian-like
[1:08:36] life I I had two older cousins of my
[1:08:40] dad's older sister and uh we stayed with
[1:08:43] them for a while till we got our own
[1:08:45] place but uh my older cousin James he
[1:08:49] was a member of the Hell's
[1:08:51] Angels and so he was the tough guy
[1:08:53] nobody mess with
[1:08:54] James and then his little brother Billy
[1:08:57] I think Billy's two or three years older
[1:08:59] me and the beevans family were big
[1:09:01] people let's Glide with we're little you
[1:09:03] know we're small people and so I I I
[1:09:08] idolized them because I wasn't being a
[1:09:12] Christian and I just honestly I didn't
[1:09:15] see anything for me as being a Christian
[1:09:17] they just did the
[1:09:18] see I didn't see anything
[1:09:22] real and the things they were teaching
[1:09:25] were just like I just shook my head like
[1:09:27] I'll be honest with you this doctrine of
[1:09:30] a Eve eating an
[1:09:32] apple anybody that has the right mind
[1:09:35] but know that's
[1:09:37] silly Eve eats an apple and she knows
[1:09:40] she's naked then she has a child and
[1:09:42] then the whole world is
[1:09:44] cursed I never bought
[1:09:46] that that's why that when I heard
[1:09:49] brother Brandon preach serpent seed oh
[1:09:51] yeah that makes sense
[1:09:54] now I see the two Natures in me I see
[1:09:57] how that we're hybrid why that we're
[1:09:59] we're fighting this carnal nature that
[1:10:01] was inbred into the human race and yet
[1:10:04] there's also the human human part that
[1:10:06] that wants to serve God and there's a
[1:10:08] battle going on Amen and I go now that I
[1:10:12] can
[1:10:13] believe virgin birth why serpent seed
[1:10:16] explains it bypasses that act which is a
[1:10:20] carnal act God didn't mean for us to
[1:10:22] procreate like that
[1:10:25] if Adam and Eve would have wanted a cute
[1:10:27] little baby all they had to do is made
[1:10:29] their desire known and they would have
[1:10:31] had
[1:10:31] one and it would come just like they did
[1:10:35] see man is is so confused in our world
[1:10:39] they don't understand mankind was made
[1:10:42] different than the
[1:10:45] animals how many monkeys have built a
[1:10:47] church like
[1:10:49] this built a jet
[1:10:51] airplane wrote a dictionary
[1:10:56] I mean that to believe the the evolution
[1:10:58] the way they teach it it's like really
[1:11:01] that don't make
[1:11:02] sense even they say there had to be some
[1:11:05] kind of a
[1:11:07] link but they don't understand man was
[1:11:10] made after
[1:11:12] God he it just for better for worse here
[1:11:16] we
[1:11:18] are and so I I I lean toward the more
[1:11:25] violent
[1:11:26] aspect and I I started as I I left
[1:11:30] Elementary School and started junior
[1:11:32] high of Los Angeles Los
[1:11:34] Angeles it's always been Wicked
[1:11:37] okay very
[1:11:39] Wicked and as I entered into Middle
[1:11:43] School it was seventh grade 8th grade
[1:11:45] and nth grade well we had a lot of ninth
[1:11:48] graders that were driving
[1:11:51] cars and here I am I'm 11 12 years old
[1:11:56] and so the mix I don't think it's good
[1:11:58] to have a mix with little children with
[1:12:01] adults like that because the the the
[1:12:04] older kids bully the little kids or the
[1:12:07] little kids admire them and follow them
[1:12:10] into their Folly which I did and of
[1:12:13] course me having my older cousin he was
[1:12:15] he was a big kid his brother older
[1:12:17] brother was in the house Angels so who
[1:12:20] do you think I went
[1:12:22] after started my life as a little Thug
[1:12:26] okay and that's all that I can't
[1:12:28] describe it any other way I learned how
[1:12:31] to defend myself I learned how to fight
[1:12:34] I learned how to to be tough I learned
[1:12:38] who to be tough with which group to hang
[1:12:40] with it's an education Satan puts you
[1:12:43] through and it is absolutely
[1:12:46] contrary to being a Son of
[1:12:49] God and
[1:12:52] so well by the time we had moved to
[1:12:55] Tucson and I'll interject
[1:12:58] this brother brandham gives his you've
[1:13:01] heard the analogy of the eagle in the
[1:13:03] chicken
[1:13:05] yard now I'm trying to be a little
[1:13:07] little hoodle and a thug but remember I
[1:13:09] got the seat of God at me and I'm still
[1:13:11] observing
[1:13:13] everything and I remember my dad had a
[1:13:15] picture of the Halo brother brandham in
[1:13:17] Houston Texas and he'd always tell me he
[1:13:20] kept it in his bedroom says now he's
[1:13:21] different than the others
[1:13:24] okay and they had a a guest speaker at
[1:13:27] the little church we went to uh Jack
[1:13:29] Brown he had got out of prison and the
[1:13:32] way that the the churches do they have
[1:13:34] someone that has
[1:13:36] a an extraordinary like you know he
[1:13:39] killed 10 people and God saved them now
[1:13:40] he's preaching the gospel you know they
[1:13:42] like doing that you know and uh yeah it
[1:13:45] was absurd they Well Jack Brown had
[1:13:47] quite a testimony he'd been in prison
[1:13:48] most of his life he he was an excon big
[1:13:51] time but God he had had a real
[1:13:54] conversion and uh so after church I'm
[1:13:57] standing around I'm W to go home it's on
[1:13:59] a Wednesday night oh man we're at church
[1:14:01] again I don't want to be here and so I'm
[1:14:04] come on dad let's go and he's talking to
[1:14:06] Jack Brown and brother bram's name comes
[1:14:10] up and Jack tells my dad he goes you
[1:14:12] know well you know he he preached
[1:14:16] sermons and they recorded them on tapes
[1:14:18] would you like to hear
[1:14:20] one my dad said yes so that Saturday my
[1:14:24] dad packed me up with him I don't know
[1:14:27] why but he took me with him anyway and
[1:14:29] we go to brother Jack Brown's
[1:14:31] apartment and in this apartment he has
[1:14:33] two chairs kind of like that with a
[1:14:35] little table in between it and he has a
[1:14:37] real to and then there's a little couch
[1:14:40] I'm sitting on the couch watching them
[1:14:43] and he starts playing brother
[1:14:45] Brenham and I seen my dad him and
[1:14:49] brother Jack Brown got closer and closer
[1:14:53] they wanted to get into that tape they
[1:14:55] enjoyed it so
[1:14:57] much and on the way home my dad was
[1:15:01] different I
[1:15:04] saw when brother brandham talks about
[1:15:06] that chicken and and the eagle in the
[1:15:10] chicken yard I saw my dad when he heard
[1:15:14] that eagle
[1:15:16] cry he
[1:15:18] responded I've seen it when brother
[1:15:21] Brandon preached the story okay I've
[1:15:23] seen that I seen my that was it Dad Dad
[1:15:27] on the way home he's talking to me and
[1:15:30] remember I'm a little Thug and he goes I
[1:15:32] found what I've been looking
[1:15:34] for and um brother Jack gives them phone
[1:15:38] numbers and they they get the we go to
[1:15:40] brother Flanigan brother Flanigan's
[1:15:42] house and uh they introduce brother
[1:15:45] Monda and then uh some man that totally
[1:15:49] opposes the message had tickets to his
[1:15:53] last sermon leadership in West
[1:15:56] Covina and dad got a got a ticket and
[1:16:00] him and another man went to the west
[1:16:03] coina and he he got to hear Brother
[1:16:06] brenham's last sermon on the west
[1:16:08] coast it was quite a blessing to
[1:16:12] him and I remember said he said we're
[1:16:14] moving the Tucson he said this place is
[1:16:17] wicked it was it still is brother
[1:16:21] brandom I don't know if you know we we
[1:16:23] preach about the the earthquake on the
[1:16:24] west coast and I've heard a lot of
[1:16:27] interpretations but I know one thing he
[1:16:29] did say if you're a preacher he said get
[1:16:33] out of Los Angeles he said it's a
[1:16:34] preacher's graveyard and I think that
[1:16:36] pretty much if there's no preachers why
[1:16:38] would there be a
[1:16:39] congregation so la is so full of evil
[1:16:43] spirits that it's it's almost impossible
[1:16:46] to have a testimony in that place not to
[1:16:49] mention a prophet of God said that it
[1:16:51] was going to sink under the ocean well
[1:16:53] we don't know when that's going to
[1:16:54] happen it's going to
[1:16:56] happen we don't
[1:16:58] know we just don't know so I've heard so
[1:17:00] many tangents on that and I'll be honest
[1:17:03] with you I'm like brother
[1:17:06] Dan I can hear the tapes and form my own
[1:17:09] opinion I don't need you to give me your
[1:17:10] opinion about it that sounds arrogant
[1:17:13] don't it but I've heard it so much that
[1:17:15] I don't want to hear it you know I know
[1:17:17] why we moved because that place was evil
[1:17:19] and God told my dad you need to go
[1:17:22] someplace where you you can hear the
[1:17:23] word of
[1:17:24] God and we came to
[1:17:27] Tucson and as we came to
[1:17:31] Tucson there were a lot of people there
[1:17:33] just like us from
[1:17:35] California and quite frankly I wasn't
[1:17:37] the only little
[1:17:39] Thug
[1:17:41] okay California has such a way of
[1:17:44] ruining children in the educational
[1:17:47] system and all these brothers and
[1:17:49] sisters children they were as honry as I
[1:17:52] was I feel right at
[1:17:54] home you
[1:17:56] know but as I I witnessed and we went to
[1:18:00] church and I'm glad that my mom and dad
[1:18:04] took me to church I'm glad that I heard
[1:18:08] brother green and he he would have
[1:18:09] others that had been in the ministry and
[1:18:11] I heard Witnesses and I listened I'm
[1:18:14] sitting there might as well I mean you
[1:18:16] know um to go back a little bit my dad
[1:18:21] had built two churches and he had also
[1:18:23] done missionary work in
[1:18:26] Mexico well as being as a preacher's
[1:18:29] kid the last thing my mom and dad wanted
[1:18:32] me to do is sleep in
[1:18:33] church so my mom had a little thing she
[1:18:36] did she would take her hand two little
[1:18:39] fingers take the little hairs on the
[1:18:41] back of my neck and she jerk on
[1:18:44] them it sounds cruel don't it I've never
[1:18:48] slept in
[1:18:51] church it had its effect
[1:18:54] I don't know you might have better kids
[1:18:55] than I was but it worked for me man had
[1:18:59] hurt wow so consequently as little
[1:19:03] rebellious Ron sits in a church with a
[1:19:06] message being preached I stayed awake
[1:19:08] and
[1:19:10] listened uh because of my parents you
[1:19:12] know bringing me upright teaching me to
[1:19:15] respect and I did respect the elders in
[1:19:17] church even though I might not have been
[1:19:19] a Christian at that time the seat of God
[1:19:22] was in me yesen and I still respected
[1:19:24] brother green I still respected all the
[1:19:27] the people in church and I I was quite
[1:19:29] amazed at how many people had known
[1:19:30] brother randam and and I was thinking
[1:19:34] man how come we didn't get to see all
[1:19:37] this you know I I have no doubt these
[1:19:40] Miracles happened in his
[1:19:43] services but you know the Bible is it
[1:19:45] covers every base you know blessed are
[1:19:47] he that has has not seen or heard but
[1:19:51] believes you know I I believe the report
[1:19:53] that's why I'm here right
[1:19:56] now but as I got older
[1:20:00] I I didn't do very well in school I just
[1:20:03] didn't pay attention and rebellious
[1:20:07] and it went on and on and it it I'm not
[1:20:10] going to go into great details I don't
[1:20:11] want you to you know have this image in
[1:20:13] your mind of who I was
[1:20:15] but it it wasn't pretty it was it was
[1:20:18] Rebellion just
[1:20:20] absolute Rebellion
[1:20:23] against the word realizing now I was
[1:20:26] rebelling against the word of God not
[1:20:28] against my
[1:20:31] parents and I had
[1:20:34] a I believe I had a good experience
[1:20:37] about the age of 14 brother green had
[1:20:40] had a a kids camp up at Mount Lemon the
[1:20:43] U at the boy scout camp up there and we
[1:20:48] had the last
[1:20:50] night it just it was I don't remember
[1:20:52] who preached what was said but I know
[1:20:55] that we moved out of the main little
[1:20:57] they had a little room like a cafeteria
[1:20:58] and they had another little off room and
[1:21:01] you could fit about 15 20 people in it
[1:21:05] and people were G had gave their heart
[1:21:08] to the Lord in that little room I'm not
[1:21:11] trying to make up any Doctrine here
[1:21:13] about the little
[1:21:15] room but in that little
[1:21:18] room God came
[1:21:21] down and every single young person in
[1:21:24] that room was
[1:21:27] touched
[1:21:29] recklessly just like in the upper room I
[1:21:31] didn't see the flames of fire come down
[1:21:34] my eyes were fogged over with like a
[1:21:36] gray it was just that it was a spirit of
[1:21:40] God in there and the love this is what I
[1:21:44] remember the most that
[1:21:47] love and people that I really didn't
[1:21:49] like I was hugging them and I was
[1:21:52] telling them I sure love you and my
[1:21:55] sister had bettered a neighbor friend
[1:21:58] she hadn't gave her heart to the Lord
[1:21:59] and she's crying and she's hugging
[1:22:01] everybody it has fallen on
[1:22:04] everybody David Williams was there he's
[1:22:06] he forgot it I tried to remind him of
[1:22:08] that davood Williams he was a hardcore
[1:22:11] Cowboy I mean two he died with his boots
[1:22:15] on I guess I don't know but he was a
[1:22:17] hardcore cowboy and I seen the spirit of
[1:22:20] God hit Dave Williams
[1:22:23] and he went on his back and hit the
[1:22:25] ground face up speaking in tongues wow
[1:22:30] praising God I reminded him brother Dan
[1:22:33] and I went visit him I he said I forgot
[1:22:35] that I
[1:22:37] didn't God didn't forget amen maybe
[1:22:42] those years of
[1:22:44] Dave abusing his mind
[1:22:47] with alcohol alcohol or whatever it was
[1:22:51] it had caused him to for forget but see
[1:22:53] God doesn't forget amen they didn't have
[1:22:55] a genuine experience with God and I
[1:22:58] think I have some of the insights of
[1:23:01] kind of why he he did like I did he he
[1:23:03] got to looking at some of those that
[1:23:05] they were put up as
[1:23:07] so spiritual and they really weren't
[1:23:10] it's a stumbling block you know don't do
[1:23:13] that be
[1:23:14] genuine be
[1:23:16] genuine don't don't do anything to show
[1:23:19] or or to right now this this is a
[1:23:22] miracle this would be there's probably
[1:23:25] three things I never wanted to be a
[1:23:27] fireman a policeman or a
[1:23:30] preacher because well you know people
[1:23:32] try to shoot policemen and firemen might
[1:23:34] get burned up and preachers they take
[1:23:37] the arrows of
[1:23:40] criticism and me being as I'm a very
[1:23:43] sensitive person it it is a gift because
[1:23:47] I I don't want to put myself as anything
[1:23:50] but I do have a little bit of
[1:23:51] discernment
[1:23:53] but you know as I have a scripture for
[1:23:56] that but it basically when you receive
[1:23:59] the gift of the Holy Spirit the Holy
[1:24:02] Spirit comes with
[1:24:05] options and sometime and but one of them
[1:24:08] is a when you buy a new
[1:24:10] car you you can get one off the showroom
[1:24:13] and it it has standard equipment if
[1:24:16] anybody bought new cars you know it is
[1:24:18] or you can get the one with leather
[1:24:20] seats Chrome whe those those are
[1:24:24] options well one of the standard options
[1:24:26] of the holy spirit is discern it to know
[1:24:28] right from wrong so anybody here says I
[1:24:31] want the gift to discernment well do you
[1:24:32] have the Holy
[1:24:35] Spirit it should tell you what's right
[1:24:37] or
[1:24:38] wrong and then it's up to you to make
[1:24:40] the decision which are you going to obey
[1:24:43] that and this is where the rubber meets
[1:24:47] the road so many of us rough shot over
[1:24:51] that unction of the Holy SP Spirit
[1:24:53] trying to gently guide us
[1:24:57] into a life that would bring us peace
[1:25:01] happiness joy that's what he wants for
[1:25:05] you brother brandham said he's a
[1:25:07] gentleman he's ain't going to make you
[1:25:08] do
[1:25:09] it sometimes he does
[1:25:12] though you know I had to learn the hard
[1:25:16] way it just seems to be it it was my my
[1:25:20] calling because of rebellion in it
[1:25:23] didn't have to be that
[1:25:25] way but there's a reason and a purpose
[1:25:28] for
[1:25:29] everything and so that experience was
[1:25:32] real to
[1:25:33] me but
[1:25:35] again this time I got to looking at
[1:25:37] people
[1:25:41] again no
[1:25:43] support all the boys my age pretty much
[1:25:47] were you know doing the world things
[1:25:51] and so I had I withered
[1:25:56] spiritually but
[1:25:58] God if you're one of his he's not
[1:26:02] done and so I withered
[1:26:06] again went into
[1:26:08] self-pity nobody loves me everybody's a
[1:26:12] hypocrite it's a lie it's just in your
[1:26:15] mind don't believe that don't believe
[1:26:19] that and so I got into some more trouble
[1:26:23] and
[1:26:25] consequently by the time I turn
[1:26:28] 15 I get to go to boy prison and I'm
[1:26:31] incarcerated for a
[1:26:34] year it was quite a quite a shock to me
[1:26:38] I'd gotten in some trouble in school and
[1:26:40] brother green and a brother from Canada
[1:26:43] they had meetings there they come and
[1:26:44] got me and took me home and we had some
[1:26:47] friends of mine we got to drink and at
[1:26:49] lunch
[1:26:50] and you know
[1:26:52] straight alcohol is not like beer you
[1:26:55] know you can drink a beer and you're
[1:26:56] okay you drink that much alcohol you're
[1:26:59] not
[1:27:00] okay and man they drug me home
[1:27:04] and things came out after that that me
[1:27:07] and some friends of mine had been
[1:27:08] involved in
[1:27:10] some some home
[1:27:13] burglaries I can't believe I did
[1:27:18] that you know people work so hard for
[1:27:22] the things they have I had no right to
[1:27:25] take
[1:27:27] them but I did and I paid for it
[1:27:30] too and I got into some other trouble
[1:27:33] and it it mounted
[1:27:34] up and so they put me in juvenile and
[1:27:37] kept me there and for a court hearing
[1:27:40] and as I went to the court hearing okay
[1:27:43] I'm 15 now I'm kind of a little smart
[1:27:46] like and I remember was Judge fry he's
[1:27:48] an old time for judge he's just old I
[1:27:52] mean he looked like he should have
[1:27:53] retired so my dad mom are there and I'm
[1:27:56] standing there
[1:27:58] and he tells me says uh you know I'm
[1:28:02] talked to your mom and dad before the
[1:28:04] court hearing said I think if you'll
[1:28:07] you'll straighten up do what your mom
[1:28:08] and dad said I think I can let you out
[1:28:10] and we'll just put you on
[1:28:13] probation and uh my dad steps in
[1:28:17] course he said basically you do what I
[1:28:21] say from now on you know well we went I
[1:28:24] was way past that
[1:28:26] okay I was way past
[1:28:29] that and I remember 15-year-old boy
[1:28:32] looking at a a judge I said your honor I
[1:28:36] can't do
[1:28:39] that that old man grab that gabble I
[1:28:41] think he's gonna break it I commit you
[1:28:44] to Arizona custody you are now a
[1:28:48] property of the state
[1:28:50] wow I had no no idea what that meant I
[1:28:52] learned later
[1:28:54] though they meant
[1:28:57] it so they shifted me to a place a
[1:28:59] halfway place up in Catalina called the
[1:29:02] U the youth
[1:29:03] center my that was an
[1:29:06] Awakening uhoh what have I got myself
[1:29:09] into and now I'm incarcerated with kids
[1:29:12] that were basically raised like little
[1:29:13] animals remember I was raised at a
[1:29:16] chrisan I was somewhat civilized these
[1:29:20] kids weren't okay
[1:29:22] they're foster kids they're illegitimate
[1:29:25] they got a grudge they hate the Mexicans
[1:29:28] hate the blacks the blacks hate the
[1:29:29] Mexicans everybody hates white people
[1:29:31] the white people hate them I was like
[1:29:33] wow what kind of zoo is
[1:29:36] this and I've never been
[1:29:39] racist and it was a shock to my
[1:29:42] system all my
[1:29:45] friends in elementary school it was an
[1:29:48] Italian a Mexican kid a white kid a
[1:29:50] Chinese kid even in junior high uh
[1:29:54] remember Big Mike he was a Wan he was My
[1:29:56] Bodyguard he liked me and he say anybody
[1:29:59] misses you they got to go through me
[1:30:01] well I already had a cousin to take care
[1:30:04] of that but Big Mike decided he's going
[1:30:05] to be in My
[1:30:06] Bodyguard and what it was is I was
[1:30:10] affiliated with one of the local little
[1:30:11] gangs in school and he wanted to be
[1:30:13] accepted but he was Hawaiian and he
[1:30:15] wasn't white so he wanted me to
[1:30:18] introduce him to them so he hung out
[1:30:21] with me
[1:30:22] and uh him and I became best
[1:30:25] friends and at an early age I remember
[1:30:28] I'm going back
[1:30:30] now we had to deal with the racist thing
[1:30:33] mom and dad are from Arkansas in a
[1:30:34] little town that
[1:30:36] my black folks didn't live in that
[1:30:38] little
[1:30:40] town and I was quite ashamed
[1:30:44] that when we go back there my dad was a
[1:30:47] good man but he'd get around his brother
[1:30:50] and their cousins and and I'd heard him
[1:30:52] use use the nword and I'll be honest
[1:30:55] with you it bothered
[1:30:57] me
[1:30:58] wow that I didn't like because I
[1:31:01] remember I'm going to school in
[1:31:02] California and it's a lot more liberal
[1:31:04] and accepting of people who are they are
[1:31:06] and and I went to Grand my grandmother
[1:31:09] and I just said Grandma they left me
[1:31:11] there with her for the day and I like my
[1:31:13] grandmother Glide well she was great she
[1:31:16] prayed oh my well that woman love
[1:31:18] praying she had Gardens and chickens and
[1:31:21] she canned and just what a
[1:31:24] lady and
[1:31:26] uh I asked grandmother about
[1:31:30] that and she just looked at me and she
[1:31:33] put her arm around me she says
[1:31:36] honey God loves all his
[1:31:41] children I'm a child but something
[1:31:44] inside of me
[1:31:46] understood the context remember brother
[1:31:49] brandom taught us the text and the
[1:31:50] context you know you can read your word
[1:31:53] but what does it
[1:31:54] mean I understood what she
[1:31:57] meant
[1:31:59] okay got
[1:32:01] it and so
[1:32:04] consequently I've never been a racist I
[1:32:06] don't understand
[1:32:08] racism I don't get it I'm I'm almost 70
[1:32:12] years old and I don't understand it why
[1:32:15] you know why because I am a Christian I
[1:32:19] believe in
[1:32:20] God
[1:32:22] God made that man born in that economic
[1:32:26] or that color or that country that was
[1:32:29] his choice who am I to have something
[1:32:33] against him who knows he might be my
[1:32:35] judge one day I've never had an issue
[1:32:39] with that and I I just I still
[1:32:42] even as I progressed and I was in the
[1:32:45] Youth
[1:32:48] Camp you know got in trouble in youth
[1:32:52] Camp me and a bunch of boys yelling out
[1:32:54] the window at some kid that he had been
[1:32:57] on a pass and he was kind of a uh he got
[1:33:01] special privileges well we were jealous
[1:33:04] so we yelled profanities at him well the
[1:33:07] secretary to the the warden was walking
[1:33:11] with him so these boys tell her they're
[1:33:15] saying that to
[1:33:16] you so Mr McFarland and he died here
[1:33:19] just some time ago he ended up being the
[1:33:21] head of all of the uh the camps and uh
[1:33:25] so he comes in
[1:33:27] there and we're on lockdown lockdown
[1:33:29] means you're in your underwear you don't
[1:33:31] eat you don't sleep and it gets us all
[1:33:34] in a big room it's okay who said
[1:33:38] that well me and about five other boys
[1:33:41] knew we had done
[1:33:43] it and why you know
[1:33:47] I I've always been a standup
[1:33:50] guy and I had two friends that I had
[1:33:53] done all these burglaries with and I
[1:33:55] didn't turn them in I went I went I was
[1:33:58] incarcerated alone they didn't go I
[1:33:59] didn't tell them I didn't read him out
[1:34:01] I'm a standup
[1:34:04] guy and so it gets pretty bad we're
[1:34:07] there it's getting later and you know
[1:34:10] some of the guys are grumbling hey man
[1:34:11] somebody better fess up you know I
[1:34:13] thought you know what I'm going to do
[1:34:15] I'm I'm going to stand
[1:34:17] up and I'm going to I'm going to take
[1:34:19] the blame for this wow
[1:34:22] So I says I did it that man grabed
[1:34:26] me and he threw picked me up off the
[1:34:29] ground and slamed Me Against the Wall as
[1:34:32] hard as he could and was screaming in my
[1:34:35] face I'm thinking wow that was a
[1:34:39] mistake but anyway I got to spend five
[1:34:42] days in lockup and uh but all the guys
[1:34:45] that uh I had stood up for they they
[1:34:48] give me some of their food and stuff
[1:34:49] because they just you know they didn't
[1:34:50] feed you very well and hey you're a good
[1:34:52] guy so I established a
[1:34:55] reputation and
[1:34:57] but they were watching me too once a
[1:35:01] week we had a bus come down from from
[1:35:04] Fort gret Arizona at that time that's
[1:35:06] where they kept all the badest it's
[1:35:07] basically it's not a reformed school
[1:35:09] it's a boy's prison okay nobody got
[1:35:12] reformed up there they just became worse
[1:35:16] criminals and so we had counselors and
[1:35:20] they sent us the
[1:35:22] different places to analyze us and they
[1:35:24] they said you know you're do pretty good
[1:35:25] you know my dad had been a carpenter I
[1:35:27] think you might you know we might have a
[1:35:30] place for you and and uh maybe in
[1:35:32] carpentry school you going to be 18 and
[1:35:36] okay and then I got into the
[1:35:39] travel and so they'd read that if the
[1:35:41] guy get out he'd read the clipboard okay
[1:35:44] I remember some of the guys
[1:35:46] names my name gets
[1:35:50] red no
[1:35:53] that's a mistake I can't go to that
[1:35:55] place that's a boy's
[1:35:58] prison no no no I told my counselor I
[1:36:01] wanted to go to a foster
[1:36:02] home and if I was in a foster home I
[1:36:05] didn't have to go to I wouldn't have to
[1:36:06] go to church and I do good in school and
[1:36:08] I i' would be
[1:36:10] okay no you're not on that list I'm on
[1:36:13] the fort Grant list so I just kept
[1:36:16] getting worse and worse and
[1:36:19] worse and so I went to for
[1:36:21] Grant
[1:36:23] wow not a nice
[1:36:26] place I witnessed them young little boys
[1:36:30] that should not have been in this place
[1:36:31] with hardened
[1:36:33] criminals you said oh how can a 16 17y
[1:36:36] old boy be hardened you had been reading
[1:36:38] the news lately
[1:36:40] then I was in boys that bragged about
[1:36:43] how they had killed people and I believe
[1:36:45] they
[1:36:47] did and I seen how they bullied and
[1:36:50] abused these young
[1:36:51] by that time I had I had spent in two
[1:36:53] years in in high school I had been on
[1:36:55] the wrestling team so I was pretty
[1:36:57] capable of taking care of myself
[1:37:00] physically but I hadn't gained I was
[1:37:01] still pretty small so I started eating
[1:37:03] and exercising
[1:37:05] and u i determined I wasn't going to be
[1:37:08] one of those
[1:37:10] victims
[1:37:12] and I got to do some issues with some
[1:37:15] bigger boys and me and another boy we
[1:37:17] decided we're going to run away we're
[1:37:18] not staying in this place I'm just
[1:37:20] constantly trouble man it just seems
[1:37:23] like it follows
[1:37:24] me so they catch us you know we're out
[1:37:27] on a farm out in Wilcox and they middle
[1:37:30] of the night they come get us and bring
[1:37:31] us back and we go they call it
[1:37:34] meditation okay well we call it the hole
[1:37:39] and it's a it's like an 8 by 10 room
[1:37:43] cement they put a one mattress on the
[1:37:46] floor and you're in your underwear and
[1:37:49] you're in there for 30 days
[1:37:52] in the morning at 8:00 you remember
[1:37:53] these routines 8 8:00 in the morning I
[1:37:55] get a little you seen those little boxes
[1:37:57] of cereal you open up pour the milk in
[1:37:59] you get one of those with a half a cup
[1:38:00] of

[1:38:04] 3:00 they bring out a paper
[1:38:07] plate one spoon of vegetable half a
[1:38:09] slice of
[1:38:11] bread and about a half ounce of
[1:38:14] protein I'm a growing
[1:38:17] boy when I went in I weighed about 170
[1:38:20] PBS
[1:38:21] after 30 days I weighed about 100
[1:38:24] pounds I remember my mom they gave it
[1:38:27] they led him to come visit afterwards my
[1:38:29] mom
[1:38:31] cried she just baled her eyes out what
[1:38:33] have they done to
[1:38:35] you I did it to
[1:38:37] myself remember I have to learn the hard
[1:38:40] way well consequently I I tried to stay
[1:38:44] out of trouble after that you know I
[1:38:45] didn't want to go back in there anymore
[1:38:48] but while I was in there we had a re
[1:38:51] Jones which was the
[1:38:53] Protestant uh chaplain and then there
[1:38:55] was father Sierra was for the Catholic I
[1:38:58] kind of like Father Sierra better
[1:38:59] because he bring his guys candy bars all
[1:39:02] Reverend Jones do is give you a track to
[1:39:03] read you
[1:39:05] know so one of my cellmates was a
[1:39:08] Catholic and say hey can my can he have
[1:39:10] a so father Sarah gave me a candy bar
[1:39:13] Catholic guy is not bad you
[1:39:15] know but we didn't have anything to read
[1:39:18] but the de Jones got permission brother
[1:39:21] and brother Nathaniel had let us send
[1:39:23] him a books and they just printed a
[1:39:25] spoken word um Daniel 70 weeks it's a a
[1:39:29] really nice book they had and so I read
[1:39:32] that book over and over and over and
[1:39:35] over you see
[1:39:37] God remember when you resist God and
[1:39:39] you're one of his he gets his
[1:39:43] way you might as well just stop
[1:39:46] resisting go ahead and say Lord here am
[1:39:49] I I surrendered
[1:39:52] that was a NAD though I didn't surrender
[1:39:55] but I read the book and I remembered it
[1:39:58] he made sure that I still got his
[1:40:01] word
[1:40:03] and I I managed
[1:40:06] to develop a reputation
[1:40:11] where I I work with a in the in the
[1:40:14] minds and we had a a little Pentecost
[1:40:16] guy was our labor for and he giv safety
[1:40:18] meetings and he loved giving safety
[1:40:20] meetings well he was a Sunday school
[1:40:22] teacher and he had a little saying he
[1:40:24] says I ain't bad but the bad don't mess
[1:40:26] with me you know and I pretty much had
[1:40:29] that
[1:40:30] reputation I when I got out of the
[1:40:33] meditation I ate twice as much food and
[1:40:36] I got a a detail at the at the dairy so
[1:40:39] I was lifting those milk cans and I was
[1:40:42] pretty stout little
[1:40:43] fell 5' 11 185 lbs and I can pick up
[1:40:48] three times my weight I can't do that
[1:40:50] now that's why my back doesn't work very
[1:40:52] well don't do
[1:40:53] that bad
[1:40:56] idea but I I experienced that and and I
[1:41:00] like I said I've never been a racist and
[1:41:02] that summer it was what fort Grant is it
[1:41:06] was an
[1:41:07] officers uh camp for World War II where
[1:41:10] they would take officers up there and
[1:41:11] train them and it was just a regular had
[1:41:14] the barracks and everything and that's
[1:41:16] what it was it was an
[1:41:17] officer so they had a pool and here's
[1:41:21] the
[1:41:22] problem none of the white boys go in the
[1:41:26] pool
[1:41:28] because I don't know what they feed
[1:41:30] these black guys but man they're
[1:41:32] big and they were intimidating and they
[1:41:35] loved they took over the pool well I I
[1:41:38] love
[1:41:39] swimming and we'd sit around and we you
[1:41:42] go in the pool I ain't going to the
[1:41:44] pool every time some guy go in the pool
[1:41:46] they grab him and hold him under the
[1:41:47] water he almost
[1:41:49] drowned
[1:41:51] and I've been one that I figure things
[1:41:55] out that's why I had not got hurt during
[1:41:59] my time of rebellion of course that's
[1:42:02] God and I looked at the situation I says
[1:42:05] you know what these guys can't
[1:42:10] swim so I thought H so I jumped in the
[1:42:14] water white boy you are crazy I went
[1:42:18] under the water and I took about three
[1:42:21] of them I grabbed their ankles and put
[1:42:22] my but see I had taken a breath of air
[1:42:25] they hadn't I grabbed their ankles and I
[1:42:27] pulled all three of them under the water
[1:42:30] and I held them and I held them and then
[1:42:32] I let them up we come up out of the
[1:42:35] water we're going to get you I did it
[1:42:38] again and the third
[1:42:41] time that was the end of it I was the
[1:42:44] only white boy got to swim that
[1:42:47] summer but I got a reputation because it
[1:42:50] was wasn't personal and I never made it
[1:42:53] personal I always respected these guys I
[1:42:57] gave them their respect and that's in in
[1:42:59] the Hispanic
[1:43:01] gangs they just want you to respect them
[1:43:04] I learned
[1:43:05] that uh I gave the Hispanic gangs their
[1:43:09] respect that's what they wanted I would
[1:43:11] not let them abuse me but I gave them
[1:43:14] respect and so I got respect you know
[1:43:17] and that's kind of a lesson here you
[1:43:20] know if you go into a place where you're
[1:43:23] uncomfortable show
[1:43:27] respect it just doesn't make any sense
[1:43:29] I'm going to go into a place whether it
[1:43:31] be another church whether you find
[1:43:33] yourself amongst gangsters whether
[1:43:36] wherever you may
[1:43:37] be I believe if you'll show respect
[1:43:40] you'll get it back and there will be
[1:43:44] there'll be so much
[1:43:46] trouble remember I remember hearing a
[1:43:48] saying that says don't start no trouble
[1:43:50] there won't be any you know a lot of
[1:43:52] times we're our worst
[1:43:54] enemy so as I learned
[1:43:57] respect brother green had brought some
[1:44:00] of the young boys up I think I don't
[1:44:01] know if Edmond had went up there that
[1:44:03] time he did and by that time i' had been
[1:44:06] there a while and I was pretty
[1:44:09] muscular
[1:44:12] and I I had earned my
[1:44:15] respect and so as we I went into the
[1:44:18] offices there there was a lot of the
[1:44:21] hey Gladwell what's up I mean it's you
[1:44:23] have to understand prison life is not
[1:44:25] like it is here it's about reputation
[1:44:29] and
[1:44:30] respect and if you don't have
[1:44:33] it you're in
[1:44:35] trouble
[1:44:37] absolutely and I learned God taught me
[1:44:39] how I didn't have to beat nobody
[1:44:42] up um I didn't have to fight
[1:44:46] anybody I just earned their
[1:44:49] respect that's godone
[1:44:51] you know he does that I didn't recognize
[1:44:54] it at the
[1:44:56] time um and so when they they brought
[1:44:59] the boys up the boys were like wow and I
[1:45:01] told them you boys don't want to be here
[1:45:04] they'll eat you
[1:45:07] up and I'm I'm sure some of the boys it
[1:45:09] had an effect on them it should have
[1:45:12] because I was telling the truth don't do
[1:45:14] like I did don't come here don't do
[1:45:18] that what happens is when you're in that
[1:45:22] atmosphere brother
[1:45:24] Dan I can't hardly see the clock brother
[1:45:26] Dan does that mean I just keep
[1:45:30] going you're an hour and 10 minutes
[1:45:35] okay I kind of lost my thought here but
[1:45:39] sorry I'm over
[1:45:42] 65 but anyway we we go through these
[1:45:45] things oh here it is
[1:45:47] it's brother Dan even now I'm still
[1:45:51] learning about what happened as I'm
[1:45:53] young by stories that are told Brother
[1:45:55] Dan tells us a story about brother
[1:45:57] brandham and Billy Paul talking about
[1:45:58] how far you get away from God that's how
[1:46:01] far you have to come back amen and I had
[1:46:04] there are still pieces to my puzzle that
[1:46:06] I'm still putting
[1:46:08] in but it's looking pretty good
[1:46:11] now and so this is why it's taken me
[1:46:16] this long to come to this place I
[1:46:19] probably should have been doing this
[1:46:20] years
[1:46:21] ago but I had a long way I picked up so
[1:46:25] many bad
[1:46:26] habits so many spirits so many
[1:46:30] attitudes one of them is defending
[1:46:34] myself I was very good at it because I
[1:46:38] don't believe in a fair fight if you're
[1:46:40] the size of Daniel Evans what kind of
[1:46:43] fair fight is that so I'm going to cheat
[1:46:47] I'm going to I'm going to kick you I'm
[1:46:49] going to scratch you I'm going to poke
[1:46:50] BR your eye out I'm going to get behind
[1:46:52] you I'm going to choke you I'm going to
[1:46:53] bite you I never believed in Fair fights
[1:46:56] and I was quite a force to be reckoned
[1:46:58] with because I realize there's no fair
[1:47:00] fight you know that's always this big
[1:47:02] guy well you well you did this and you
[1:47:04] did that you're 100 pounds heavier of me
[1:47:06] what was I supposed to
[1:47:08] do but you see that becomes a spirit and
[1:47:12] an
[1:47:15] attitude I've had a change of heart amen
[1:47:18] amen I would rather you hurt me than I
[1:47:21] hurt you I won't do that anymore I
[1:47:27] won't if you want to make me a martyr
[1:47:29] and beat me to death and praise the Lord
[1:47:32] I forgive
[1:47:33] you I will not defend myself any
[1:47:38] longer there's no future in
[1:47:41] it it becomes an attitude when somebody
[1:47:43] says something you defend yourself well
[1:47:46] what you just did you just defended that
[1:47:48] person maybe they didn't mean Nothing by
[1:47:52] it
[1:47:53] so not only do it you stop the physical
[1:47:57] aspect you stop the spiritual aspect of
[1:48:00] Defending
[1:48:01] yourself maybe the Lord had the person
[1:48:04] say maybe what they said is true and I
[1:48:06] needed that
[1:48:08] correction a change of
[1:48:10] heart it's not just a change of heart
[1:48:13] you got to change your mind how you
[1:48:15] think the Bible talks about get the mind
[1:48:17] of
[1:48:19] Christ
[1:48:21] I believe that he has revealed himself
[1:48:23] to me I really
[1:48:25] do and I believe that I have a a gift of
[1:48:32] imagination when I read my Bible I put
[1:48:35] myself there I've seen enough history
[1:48:38] and and seen enough movies about how it
[1:48:40] is so when I read the Bible I go
[1:48:44] there and when they talk about Jesus
[1:48:48] they didn't wash his feet
[1:48:51] remember these were not asphalt roads in
[1:48:54] these alleys these were
[1:48:55] dirt the they had animal power what do
[1:48:59] animals
[1:49:01] do and you walk in sandals they didn't
[1:49:04] have these really nice car heart boots
[1:49:06] you
[1:49:07] know and washing the feet M you know
[1:49:11] what you're washing off the feet of
[1:49:14] somebody and it was just it was just
[1:49:16] show of respect when someone came and
[1:49:19] you were invited to wash their feet and
[1:49:21] they didn't wash his feet I mean it what
[1:49:24] a the Lamb of God how they mistreated
[1:49:29] him and how that little that little
[1:49:32] woman she washed his feet with her
[1:49:35] tears and anointed him how
[1:49:38] precious I don't think I'd ever use that
[1:49:41] word to describe anything remember I was
[1:49:43] a tough
[1:49:44] guy how
[1:49:46] precious how special our Lord is you
[1:49:50] need to get to know him he will teach
[1:49:52] you who he was and what he did for
[1:49:56] you the greatest thing that happened in
[1:49:59] in the crucifixion was him saying on in
[1:50:02] Gethsemane I'll do
[1:50:04] it that battle was real said that his
[1:50:07] sweat was like blood that Agony he went
[1:50:10] through that man and I mentioned this to
[1:50:14] somebody the other
[1:50:15] day you know Jesus had been raised under
[1:50:19] the wrong woman
[1:50:21] foot how many crucifixions had he
[1:50:24] witnessed
[1:50:26] hundreds how many beatings they did this
[1:50:29] publicly to humiliate the people he knew
[1:50:33] what was coming he had seen these men
[1:50:36] beaten to death stomped to death
[1:50:40] crucified he knew how cruel the Romans
[1:50:43] were he had no doubt what was in store
[1:50:46] for
[1:50:48] him and so he said Lord oh Lord if this
[1:50:51] pup this cup let it
[1:50:55] pass but because he loved brother
[1:50:57] brandom said if he only died for you he
[1:51:01] would have done
[1:51:02] it that makes it personal doesn't it I
[1:51:06] feel that way I'm glad he died for you
[1:51:08] also but I'm sure glad he died for me
[1:51:11] amen but he didn't die he was he was
[1:51:14] tortured let's not sanitize the let's
[1:51:17] not sanitize this it was a horrible
[1:51:21] thing that happened you need to
[1:51:23] understand what he went
[1:51:24] through you need to have that time where
[1:51:27] you know what he did to save not just
[1:51:32] your
[1:51:33] soul every one had been born for the
[1:51:36] time of Jesus back to
[1:51:38] Adam they were counting on that day they
[1:51:42] were in prison they were they couldn't
[1:51:45] go any farther I don't believe they were
[1:51:47] in torment but they were in prison they
[1:51:49] were in a place brother brand called it
[1:51:51] Paradise but they were locked in there
[1:51:53] they couldn't leave waiting for the day
[1:51:55] of judgment and quite frankly it didn't
[1:51:58] matter how good they were if there was
[1:51:59] not a a a sacrifice
[1:52:03] of like
[1:52:05] Jesus if there was not that ultimate
[1:52:08] sacrifice those millions of souls come
[1:52:11] Judgment
[1:52:12] Day youart from me Jesus knew that this
[1:52:17] is this is real this is we sometimes we
[1:52:20] can't see it we're in our little
[1:52:21] sanitized world but it's
[1:52:24] real and Jesus knew they're depending on
[1:52:28] me and then all the generations that
[1:52:32] haven't been born yet they're
[1:52:35] doomed I have
[1:52:37] to but you know not everybody is a Son
[1:52:40] of God we know that we know there's two
[1:52:42] lines going down you know Cain's
[1:52:44] children they're the devil's children I
[1:52:47] don't know who they are I could have
[1:52:49] been one I don't believe I am now I've
[1:52:51] kind of went through that process and I
[1:52:54] I kind of detour a little bit but I've
[1:52:57] kind of went through that process there
[1:52:58] was a song by a man that he had had an
[1:53:01] issue with his girlfriend he starts out
[1:53:04] I wonder if it was my fault and then he
[1:53:05] sings another stanza you know it could
[1:53:07] have been my fault and then he sings
[1:53:09] another stanza it might have been my
[1:53:10] fault and by the end of the song he says
[1:53:13] it was my
[1:53:15] fault well I feel like that is is is in
[1:53:18] my Christian walk
[1:53:21] as a child I said I believe there are
[1:53:23] sons of God I wonder if I could be one
[1:53:25] of
[1:53:27] them and then as I get a little longer
[1:53:29] you know there's a possibility if I give
[1:53:30] my heart to the Lord I might be one of
[1:53:33] those and as I my walk grows with God
[1:53:37] you know it's possible I could be a Son
[1:53:39] of
[1:53:42] God and then you get to the point where
[1:53:44] you know Lord if I'm not a son of God
[1:53:48] why have you done all the these things
[1:53:50] to preserve me and why do you speak to
[1:53:52] my
[1:53:54] heart and I'm I'm almost
[1:53:58] there I am a Son of God Amen thank god
[1:54:03] well then once you're a Son of God you
[1:54:04] better act like
[1:54:06] it remember the story of Alexander the
[1:54:09] Great there was a young soldier that his
[1:54:12] mom had named him Alexander and he was
[1:54:14] just a cut up and he was an
[1:54:15] embarrassment and Alex they brought him
[1:54:16] to
[1:54:17] Alexander And he says you know son he
[1:54:20] says either you straighten up or change
[1:54:23] your
[1:54:25] name you know you say you're a Christian
[1:54:28] be a Christian
[1:54:30] yeah
[1:54:32] well how do I be a Christian ra your
[1:54:35] Bible and
[1:54:37] pray the Bible is going to testify it's
[1:54:40] going to show you and I I called the
[1:54:43] name of my my little testimony is find
[1:54:48] yourself in the Bible
[1:54:50] I have a lot of scriptures I've written
[1:54:51] down but I probably won't read
[1:54:54] them but I found myself in the
[1:54:58] Bible and I find situations where I did
[1:55:03] that and when when Jesus Calls the the
[1:55:08] disciples it's in John 15:16 he said I
[1:55:12] have chosen you to be my
[1:55:15] disciples well what is a disciple it's a
[1:55:19] follower of
[1:55:20] Christ he didn't just choose
[1:55:23] 12 he chose
[1:55:26] Millions but you know here
[1:55:29] is here's the kicker to it do you accept
[1:55:33] his
[1:55:35] calling many many he chose the 12
[1:55:38] disciples you know the Rich Young Ruler
[1:55:41] if you read everyone that he said follow
[1:55:43] me they did except one the Rich Young
[1:55:48] Ruler he rejected eternal
[1:55:52] life he was
[1:55:54] called all the others say oh they they
[1:55:58] dropped what they were doing they
[1:55:59] followed him whether it be tax collector
[1:56:02] or fisherman uh whoever it was whatever
[1:56:06] sta station of life he said Timothy or
[1:56:10] not Timothy but uh Phillip Matthew Peter
[1:56:17] John and he would tell and they did
[1:56:20] that they had the seed of God in
[1:56:22] them but he tells the Rick Shan rder
[1:56:26] sell all you have and follow
[1:56:28] me
[1:56:30] why he rejected eternal
[1:56:34] life it's
[1:56:37] serious Bible says God's spirit don't
[1:56:39] always strive with man I encourage those
[1:56:42] that are listening or you have friends
[1:56:44] if God is calling you to do better do
[1:56:48] better if he says you need to step up a
[1:56:51] little higher step up a little higher if
[1:56:54] you don't know how get a hold of
[1:56:56] somebody that's been a Christian for a
[1:56:57] while see I'm I I feel like I'm I'm at a
[1:57:00] I've hit a glass ceiling I can't go any
[1:57:02] farther yes you
[1:57:06] can well brother Ron we can only go so
[1:57:08] far well you ever heard the story of
[1:57:13] Enoch he pleased God so much God let him
[1:57:15] just walk off the
[1:57:17] earth so you're there weren't many on
[1:57:20] Enochs but why not
[1:57:22] try don't be sat don't be satisfied with
[1:57:25] your spiritual condition you're either
[1:57:29] advancing there is no neutrality in in
[1:57:32] for the sons of God there is no
[1:57:36] neutrality there's no I'm just going to
[1:57:38] I'm going to hold my position well there
[1:57:41] is a certain extent but as your personal
[1:57:43] I'm talking about your personal walk you
[1:57:45] should be advancing you should be going
[1:57:49] close closer to God you should be
[1:57:51] confessing you know I believe I'm a Son
[1:57:53] of God I believe God hears my prayer see
[1:57:58] that confession increases your
[1:58:01] faith and I am here to encourage
[1:58:05] you I was a renegade I'm not going to
[1:58:07] tell you all the little things I did it
[1:58:09] it it's not
[1:58:11] beneficial I don't want you to be afraid
[1:58:13] of me and have afay to have your kids
[1:58:14] shake my hand but I'm not that person
[1:58:18] anymore it breaks my heart when I
[1:58:22] think why did I do those
[1:58:25] things Satan will take you down a road
[1:58:29] and he will it he will be like someone's
[1:58:32] hooked a chain to your ankle and Drug
[1:58:33] you behind a pickup that's how he treats
[1:58:35] his people he's that vicious and that
[1:58:39] hateful have nothing to do with his
[1:58:42] Spirit dedicate your life to knowing the
[1:58:45] will of God for your life and once you
[1:58:48] know the will of God do it
[1:58:52] I honestly never envisioned myself
[1:58:54] standing here doing
[1:58:57] this but if it helps somebody I'll do
[1:59:01] it I'm no longer ashamed of who I
[1:59:05] am you know God may be who I am he put
[1:59:09] me through these for a
[1:59:11] purpose uh during this time of of
[1:59:13] Disobedience I met my
[1:59:16] wife and if I had to been in that
[1:59:18] position and that time I wouldn't have
[1:59:20] met
[1:59:21] her he made her for
[1:59:24] me and he made me for
[1:59:26] her you know it seems she's always
[1:59:28] reminded me yep you needed a wife like
[1:59:30] me well honey you needed a man like
[1:59:34] me we were a perfect
[1:59:37] match and you know brother brandom talks
[1:59:39] about numerology my wife's numerology
[1:59:42] just goes on and on and
[1:59:44] on she's a little older than I
[1:59:48] am
[1:59:49] on her sixth birthday I was conceived I
[1:59:53] told her this is you know I no way she
[1:59:56] said Google it you know how we do
[1:59:59] that okay I was born on May the
[2:00:02] 30th it says your conception was
[2:00:04] probably around September the
[2:00:06] 12th that's my wife's birthday I said
[2:00:09] what do you think of
[2:00:11] that you know and it that's just a
[2:00:14] beginning of God showing me because
[2:00:17] marriage is tough
[2:00:19] this conflict of man and woman is it
[2:00:22] it's hard it's not
[2:00:24] easy but if you're
[2:00:27] committed it's worth
[2:00:29] it it gets
[2:00:32] better uh you go through different
[2:00:34] phases first you're married and it's the
[2:00:37] honeymoon then you have your children

[2:02:11] let it
[2:02:13] go you know we have to go through these
[2:02:15] things God teaches us to endure you want
[2:02:19] endurance you want
[2:02:21] patience he'll teach you
[2:02:24] patience he'll teach you
[2:02:27] love I had one of my
[2:02:29] son-in-laws say how can you love one of
[2:02:32] our daughters she was just two of them
[2:02:34] really give us a hard
[2:02:36] time and he goes how can you love her
[2:02:38] how can you put I said I would disown
[2:02:40] her I wouldn't let her treat me like
[2:02:42] that we would move her to Phoenix then
[2:02:44] we' move her then she'd hook up with
[2:02:46] some boyfriend and he would be abusive
[2:02:48] and we we go and we'd help her out and
[2:02:50] just she'd crash a car and we buy her
[2:02:52] another one I was like how much longer
[2:02:54] can I do
[2:02:56] this and my one
[2:02:59] son-in-law he said I wouldn't have
[2:03:01] anything to do with
[2:03:03] her and I went in my truck and I
[2:03:05] pondered it all day
[2:03:07] long Lord what am I going to
[2:03:12] do and God came to me how do you know it
[2:03:15] was
[2:03:16] God he says
[2:03:20] do you love her I
[2:03:24] do are you ever going to stop loving
[2:03:26] her probably
[2:03:29] not is there anything your daughter can
[2:03:33] do
[2:03:36] ever to keep you from loving her
[2:03:41] no he says then
[2:03:45] lover that's how you know it's from God
[2:03:47] Satan don't talk to you like that
[2:03:49] see we learn the holy spirit is the
[2:03:52] discerner of right and wrong that was
[2:03:53] the right that was the counseling that
[2:03:56] was the the Holy Spirit speaking to me
[2:03:59] and I had listened to
[2:04:01] it okay and I got home and told the
[2:04:05] wife whatever it takes I'd have to say
[2:04:09] today that all three of my daughters are
[2:04:12] are good citizens of this the one that
[2:04:15] I'm talking about she is now she went to
[2:04:19] school to become an RN and now she's an
[2:04:21] FMP which is a family nurse
[2:04:24] practitioner we didn't give up on
[2:04:27] her you know God don't give up on us and
[2:04:32] when he reveals that he doesn't give up
[2:04:34] on us he shows us our past he said I
[2:04:37] didn't give up on
[2:04:39] you you did this and this and this and I
[2:04:43] still kept drawing you I still kept
[2:04:47] providing circumstances for you to serve
[2:04:51] me give her the same
[2:04:54] chance and that goes with
[2:04:57] everyone you know don't ever put anybody
[2:05:00] out don't say Well they're they're gone
[2:05:03] that's up to them and God I'm still
[2:05:06] going to treat him I'm going to treat
[2:05:08] him like I want to be
[2:05:10] treated
[2:05:11] and it it it's we need to learn to
[2:05:15] discern the spirits around us
[2:05:19] Christ is
[2:05:20] gentle he's
[2:05:22] forgiving he's
[2:05:25] enduring he's longsuffering and I'm sure
[2:05:28] glad he is just for my sake but I have a
[2:05:31] responsibility now and my testimony is I
[2:05:33] have to do that
[2:05:35] now I
[2:05:37] know at work and I worked at the mindes
[2:05:41] and I believe I lived a good a good
[2:05:45] testimony and I'll be honest with you
[2:05:47] they didn't like me
[2:05:51] I had talked to one of the brothers at
[2:05:53] church and I told him about some of the
[2:05:55] issues he saidwell just work
[2:05:57] harder well I did I was the hardest
[2:05:59] working man on our
[2:06:02] crew and you'd think that they would get
[2:06:04] positive
[2:06:05] response my foreman brought me in the
[2:06:08] office on a graveyard shift says I need
[2:06:09] to talk to you he said I'm getting some
[2:06:14] complaints and uh he said you're working
[2:06:17] too hard
[2:06:20] I so they nicknam me the preacher I
[2:06:23] thought it was pretty good I like
[2:06:26] that but as we go along
[2:06:30] here my my testimony hasn't ended
[2:06:33] here I've left out a
[2:06:36] lot but I'm
[2:06:38] continuing to
[2:06:40] grow I'm continuing to get I'm not the
[2:06:43] same person I was last year
[2:06:46] am and I don't intend I I intend to be
[2:06:49] if we're here another year I'll look
[2:06:51] back and say
[2:06:53] man we have to we're on our upward path
[2:06:57] don't be
[2:06:59] satisfied with
[2:07:02] mediocre
[2:07:04] Christianity being a Christian is great
[2:07:07] am it's
[2:07:09] exciting it's it's the even if you
[2:07:12] weren't saved it's the best way to
[2:07:15] live the way of the transgressor is hard
[2:07:21] so if you know anybody that's having
[2:07:23] issues encourage them be a good
[2:07:28] example remind them man God loves you do
[2:07:35] better and U there's so much more I
[2:07:38] could say
[2:07:40] but times running out right now but I
[2:07:44] didn't get to near all the scriptures
[2:07:45] but you
[2:07:47] know
[2:07:49] our pastor here has a burden for the
[2:07:51] lost souls
[2:07:53] am and I have a burden that when these
[2:07:55] Souls come
[2:07:58] in to let to to encourage them to
[2:08:02] grow
[2:08:04] don't you must have an
[2:08:07] experience if you know anyone and they
[2:08:10] they don't know whether they've receed
[2:08:11] the gift of the Holy Spirit or not work
[2:08:14] with them talk with them pray with
[2:08:17] them it's it's a wonderful thing to have
[2:08:20] that
[2:08:21] counselor that when you're in trouble
[2:08:24] when you're
[2:08:25] alone when you wonder did they preach
[2:08:28] the right thing well I found that every
[2:08:32] time I've been in a
[2:08:35] service I try not to disagree I try to
[2:08:37] find something that I agree
[2:08:39] with and you know when I do that I get
[2:08:42] something out of
[2:08:43] it and I go away
[2:08:47] fed so don't be so
[2:08:50] disagreeable let God lead
[2:08:52] you and love one
[2:08:55] another but most of
[2:08:58] all honor and respect this word amen
[2:09:02] believe this word amen it will lead you
[2:09:06] I know it's my time is is about
[2:09:09] up but here is a reality we're all going
[2:09:13] to do the crossover one way or the other
[2:09:16] amen I believe in the resurrection I
[2:09:19] believe in the catching
[2:09:21] away
[2:09:23] but I've watched people die in my
[2:09:27] lifetime and I've seen easy
[2:09:30] Crossovers and I've seen horrible
[2:09:34] crossovers I watched the man die he had
[2:09:36] wrecked his car behind me and was thrown
[2:09:38] out and I held him in my hands and
[2:09:41] watched him
[2:09:44] die I don't think he was ready he was
[2:09:47] struggling I watched my dad pass
[2:09:50] away brother Arie was there thank you
[2:09:53] brother Arie and he witnessed it was a
[2:09:55] very smooth Crossing see Dad was a
[2:10:00] Christian I watched a lady that I know
[2:10:04] well I watched her
[2:10:07] pass and it was not
[2:10:09] pretty she
[2:10:12] struggled and she
[2:10:15] groaned and the river Jordan was it was
[2:10:20] rough for
[2:10:21] her I hope for her
[2:10:25] sake that there will be mercy
[2:10:28] found but I know one thing she wasn't
[2:10:30] ready to
[2:10:32] die and it was a horrible thing watching
[2:10:34] her
[2:10:37] pass I just leave you with this you make
[2:10:40] sure that you've done everything you
[2:10:42] know to
[2:10:44] do and you know God will take care of
[2:10:46] the rest he will will he promised and if
[2:10:50] you're not where you need to be he will
[2:10:53] put you in a situation where you'll grow
[2:10:56] don't
[2:10:57] stop don't
[2:11:00] quit finish the
[2:11:02] race finish the
[2:11:08] race
[2:11:10] well I'm just going to pause I'm not
[2:11:13] done but I'll let you go here thank you
[2:11:16] for for listening to me and and for
[2:11:18] allowing me to pour my heart out there's
[2:11:22] so much more I thought I would say that
[2:11:23] I didn't but I hope this
[2:11:27] helped
[2:11:31] [Applause]
[2:11:37] Dan musicians can come I want to point
[2:11:41] out something about brother
[2:11:43] Ron brother Ron mentioned a couple times
[2:11:46] he said that he didn't have a support
[2:11:50] and there's only so much that parents
[2:11:52] can do and do you see how important it
[2:11:56] was only by the grace of God that
[2:11:57] brother Ron was so successful in life
[2:11:59] and and he has a family and he has a
[2:12:01] good marriage and he has all these
[2:12:03] things it's only by the grace of God
[2:12:05] brother Ron should have been a failure
[2:12:08] in life with the way that he was
[2:12:11] going he should have failed he should
[2:12:14] have stayed in prison but it was only by
[2:12:17] the grace of
[2:12:18] God the the kindness of our Lord Jesus
[2:12:22] that he got him back on the right path
[2:12:24] and do you see how important this church
[2:12:27] is brothers and sisters do you see how
[2:12:30] important it is for our children to have
[2:12:33] this support structure how important it
[2:12:35] is for the elderly how important it is
[2:12:37] for all the parents to have this support
[2:12:40] structure we can help each other we can
[2:12:43] encourage each other so that we don't
[2:12:46] see someone go down that that wrong path
[2:12:48] and if they're going down that wrong
[2:12:50] path we can reach out Heath and grab
[2:12:52] them and bring him back I think it was
[2:12:55] Jude that said that you reach into the
[2:12:58] fire for each other and pull each other
[2:13:02] out that is so important and brother
[2:13:06] Ron's testimony today is to me is a
[2:13:10] miracle that he ended up successful in
[2:13:13] life that he ended up with what he has
[2:13:16] now
[2:13:18] it was a blessing
[2:13:20] and a lot of it was was uh um I can't
[2:13:26] get the picture out of of my mind of him
[2:13:28] swimming down to the bottom of the P
[2:13:30] pulling grabbing those people's legs I
[2:13:32] bet it scared them to death let's let's
[2:13:35] all stand
[2:13:37] up again brothers and sisters this is
[2:13:40] how important it
[2:13:43] is you can look at this testimony for
[2:13:46] our from our brother
[2:13:49] and how much would it have meant to you
[2:13:50] brother Ron
[2:13:51] if if you had have had a
[2:13:54] friend if and I know you did and I know
[2:13:57] that there were those in your life and
[2:13:59] it can't always it can't just be Mom and
[2:14:02] Dad Me growing up I had
[2:14:04] a strong Believers in in my my two
[2:14:09] brothers and my sister and I had good
[2:14:11] solid friends but I can imagine where
[2:14:14] I'd be if I didn't have that and that's
[2:14:16] what I want us to provide
[2:14:18] as a
[2:14:19] church as brother Ron told us is a is a
[2:14:23] community is a family that's what we
