don't know if I see anymore oh we have a couple Robson girls here God bless you welcome good to have you welcome and uh if if I missed you welcome on brother Amos on Wednesday night we um we do a Bible study we started in the Book of Genesis and we're taking one one um service per book and we're going all the way through the Bible tonight I'm going to break the rules and um we are going to spend the month on Wednesday night studying This Book of Daniel and tonight's the first night amen looking forward to this it's uh not just because I'm named after him but I am very very I love the Book of Daniel of two people that I relate I believe the most that I admire probably the most in the whole B Bible besides our lord Jesus is this Prophet Daniel and then the Apostle Paul two people that I just I love their stand so much and that's um and then we get to dig into this book tonight um we've been through have to refresh your memory a little bit we've been through the book of Isaiah the book of Jeremiah and the Book of Ezekiel this uh this book of Jeremiah in the Book of Ezekiel are prophesying about the same time that this book Daniel that the Prophet Daniel is prophesying now I mentioned some dates before you don't have to remember so much the dates but but just this time period in in 605 BC we have the first Invasion from Babylon invad invading Judah and that's when Daniel was taking captive in in 605 BC and uh Daniel had made a name for himself already starting in the ministry and it seems obvious because Daniel is mentioned in the same context as Noah and uh job from The Book of Ezekiel and I I'll read that here in a minute and then about eight years after that first Invasion nebuchad Nebuchadnezzar comes in remember Jeremiah Was prophesying was warning War ing Judah saying that this King of the North is coming that we're going to get invaded and then they then the King of the North comes from Babylon invades and then about eight years later Ezekiel there was another Invasion that the first Invasion takes Daniel captive then the next invasion in 597 we see Ezekiel taken captive which is what we talked about last week and then about um 11 years later 10 years later 589 to 587 there was a a Siege on Jerusalem and it was a very it was a horrible horrible time that was the third Invasion from Nebuchadnezzar and then 586 Jerusalem the temple are destroyed and then we have the third wave of deportation from Judah so the first wave the first Invasion Jeremiah's prophesying he's he's saying that this is coming they invade take Daniel and many of many of his people captive and then they take another Invasion comes about eight years later they take Ezekiel captive and then there's a a Siege and things get really really rough and Ezekiel is prophesying that this is going to come when he was in Babylon it comes and um then in 586 the whole city is destroyed and burned so to lay the foundation there and then there's different Kings at this time remember the first king was Josiah he's pretty much the last good King in all of Israel and all of Judah we see Josiah there and uh he was a good King he was there for about 31 years then after him jehoahaz comes he like three months and then the two that we're going to have to remember one one of those is jeim jeim he was there for about 11 years as king and he was the king when Nebuchadnezzar first invades Judah then after him after jeho Kim then there is jeho Chen and he was there for just about three months and then after him is the very last last king of of Judah the last king of all of Israel and that's this King named zedekiah and he was uh the one that against the advice of the Prophet Jeremiah Jeremiah told him hey when this Invasion comes just go along with it don't fight it well zedekiah listened to His prophets rather than than the Prophet Jeremiah he Rebels against this King that was invading this this Nebuchadnezzar then Babylon lays Siege during his time and as I said the city is completely destroyed we get that from the books of Jeremiah the books of Ezekiel the books of second 2 Chronicles so this man that this king of this country that just seems to come out of nowhere this Nebuchadnezzar he's uh his dad was probably the founding father of Babylon so Nebuchadnezzar was raised probably a ve a very privileged life and you know when you raise a kid and you raise him and you tell him that you're special he's like and and his mom probably told told him little nebie you're going to be a great king someday and and and you're special and little nebby you're gonna be like a God and telling this kid as he's being raised for his whole life how great he's going to be and and not giving him any hardships in life and not allowing him to suffer anything you can see how a lot of times children are raised and they turn out to be just just tyrants and people that don't care about someone else that only cares about themselves and these are the type of people that turned into to be narcissists they turned into to be a very controlling people and that's what happened to this little nebbi as he grew up he turned out to be this Tyrant of a king but but what kind of breaks my heart about this whole story of Daniel is I see some character in nebuch Nezar it comes out every once in a while which we'll get through as we get through the the book you see some repentance in Nebuchadnezzar you you see some some character come out but right now this man Nebuchadnezzar he had a terrible temper and and was just a very strong dictator and we see that as this last king that was in um Judah this zedekiah do you remember what happened from the book of Jeremiah Nebuchadnezzar invades and he sees oh you going to fight me you going to take me on remember and and I'm I'm adding a lot here but it you just see the character of this man Nebuchadnezzar and he says you're going to fight me you're going to take me on as zedekiah so Nebuchadnezzar comes in and he's absolutely furious at this King for fighting against him he goes He destroys the city he sets up zedekiah the king and here's all of his sons he sets zedekiah there lines his sons up against up in front of him and he kills each one of his sons and here's how cruel this man uh Nebuchadnezzar is is he kills them and then he gouges out the eyes of zedekiah so that's the last thing that he sees rage coming up in this man Nebuchadnezzar and that is who is king during this Book of Daniel during the beginning of it and that's who Daniel has to deal with and they know all these stories so when Daniel raises up and and and is is shows this great character he's running the risk of this temper coming out of this man and you'll see it coming up remember the uh the Hebrew children and the fiery furnace and all that you see this man Nebuchadnezzar you see his temper raise up many times during this book but these Hebrews are examples and they stand up against this man this man Daniel on the other hand was a young man of great Great Character just like these these kids were singing up there just dare to be a Daniel dare to stand alone and this man Daniel he was of all the prophets he was among the greatest you could even call him a minor Prophet because his book is fairly short but it is action-packed it's got wonderful things in This Book of Daniel so here's Daniel he's he is taken out as a young man again in that original invasion of Judah he's brought out and then remember Ezekiel Ezekiel is talking to the Lord and let's turn to I believe it's Ezekiel chapter 14 yes Ezekiel uh chapter 14 and verse 13 so here's God and he's talking to his Prophet Ezekiel and he says this son of man do you remember what son of man is remember it's just the son of a human being but we're going to get to we won't get there tonight but we're going to get to Daniel where that son of man will that statement is going to be used a little little differently a lot differently Ezekiel chapter 14:3 says this son of man when the land sinth Against Me by trespassing grievously then will I stretch out mine hand upon it there we just summed up the whole Old Testament over and over and over this this happens and will break the staff of bread thereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and Beast from it now listen to this this is how great this young man Daniel is and he's he's probably very young when Ezekiel is prophesying this though these three men Noah Noah basically was the one that God sent to save the human race Noah Daniel and job and he puts Daniel in the middle of these great Servants of God though these three men Noah Daniel and job were in it they should deliver but their own Souls by their righteousness sayeth the Lord God so God's putting Daniel in the same class as these and and you know he seldom compares one Prophet to another but he's doing this here and he says if I cause a noisome if I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land and they spoil it so that it be desolate and that no man pass through it because of the Beast though these three men were in it as I live sayeth the Lord God they shall deliver neither Sons nor daughters they shall o they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolate so even though these great men were in the in the land Noah and job were long since D dead but Daniel is right here alive when Ezekiel is saying this or if I bring a sword upon the land and say sword go through the land so that I cut off a man and and Beast from it though these three men were in it as I live sayeth the Lord God they shall deliver neither Sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered so the Lord's saying he's using Daniel as an example of righteousness to to Ezekiel or if I send pestilence into the land and pour out my Fury upon it in blood to cut it off from it man and Beast though Noah Daniel and job were in it as I live sayeth the Lord God they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own Souls by their righteousness So Daniel even while he was alive fairly young was singled out by God as a great and righteous man and he's saying that these men are so great but this place is so wicked that even if these three men were here I'll still destroy it all except for these guys because they are so great and here is Daniel among two of the greatest in the whole Bible and then even in Daniel's prophecies go on even the Lord Jesus quotes Daniel Matthew chapter 24 he says Jesus referred to Daniel Daniel as a prophet and he said when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy place and then he says who so readeth let him understand so if you're reading Daniel's book understand what you're reading that's what we're here for tonight is to try to understand what we're reading now I'm not going to dig into the depths of these prophecies but hopefully by the end that we'll understand understand more about this Book of Daniel he was educated in science of the Babylonians and he was a Bible reader we know this later on because Daniel was reading the Prophecies of Jeremiah and and and then he saw he had enough Revelation to read the Bible and he believed he's like who wait a minute we supposed to be here 70 years like you were saying before brother Aaron back there there's only a couple years left until Jeremy's Jeremiah's prophecy is fulfilled so he knew Daniel was somebody that studied and and he did well and there's a lot of people brothers and sisters that take Daniel's prophecies even today and they will set a time and it's pretty easy to do because Daniel's very very specific and they'll take a time and they'll start adding up the years and applying some correction for 360 days versus 365 and and you get it all worked out and then you come up with a date Jesus said don't do that in fact he said the one that does that don't believe him but I'll tell you what you can get close and that time is right around now I did it a few years ago you know put it together and I'm smart and uh I'm GNA figure this out and I think I came up with 2019 um this is before 2019 that I came up with that date and I kept him myself of of course I knew that Jesus said hey don't listen to somebody that does that and I knew that we're not supposed to do that but I think pretty much everyone that looks into these prophecies and looks into Daniel's prophecies they come up with this time right around now that the Lord Jesus is scheduled to return and it's and the Jews he's scheduled to return the messiah's supposed to come to the Jews after this what we call the Gentile dispensation and we'll get to that in a little while um and this Daniel he was such a great man that this King Nebuchadnezzar Daniel really won his affection and Nebuchadnezzar as as narcissistic as he was and as bad of a temper as he had and gouging out the eyes and killing all these people and invading he respected Daniel and we're going to see why here when we get into the book Let's Start let's go to the Book of Daniel now the Book of Daniel is really basically in two parts the first part is basically the first half of Daniel and we learn about Daniel we learn about this man what he was what kind of a person he was we learn the stories of uh that that are just famous that we all know and then in the second half of the book we go back to the same kind of spirit that's in Isaiah and Jeremiah and Ezekiel where it's prophecies and dreams and Visions so it's really split into two parts the first part we get to know Daniel we get to know the situation and then the second part we see the prophecies that Daniel makes and they are tremendous one thing that's really neat about Daniel is some of the dreams that we see and we're gonna we're going to read one tonight Daniel actually gives an interpretation of it and it actually comes to pass part of it when he's here and then another part of it comes to pass right after a little while after Daniel passes away and then the third part of it comes to pass right when Jesus was here and we'll get into that so some of these prophecies in Daniel are very very easy to interpret and very easy to understand Daniel chapter one in the third year of the reign of jeho Kim remember I said we're going to learn we need to remember two kings this jeak Kim was there when they had the first invasion of Babylon in the third year of the reign of jeim of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon into Jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave jeim king of Judah into his hand notice who gave Judah Israel into Nebuchadnezzar's hand yeah it wasn't all Nebuchadnezzar God had given them up because of their sins and because of their Idol remember God's in charge no matter what no matter how bad things seem to be God is on the throne and he's watching this and whatever happens has to happen either at his direction or he lets it happen and here it was at his Direction yeah the lord gave jeim king of Judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of Shar to the the house of his God and he brought the vessels into the Treasure House of God and the King spake unto as panaz the master of his unic that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and the King's seed and and the princes so he invades and he says now bring a certain of the king's seed what's the king's seed Judah the tribe of Judah so which tribe did Daniel come from Judah the children in whom was no blemish but was well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning and knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's Palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the calans and the King appointed them daily provisions of the king's meat and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king so these captives they were taken out of their home and they were to under undergo a three-year assimilation into the Babylonian Society they would learn their lifestyle they would learn their food they would even I'll read it in a minute have to to let go of their old Hebrew names and be given a new Babylonian name so basically this King in his ways he says you're coming out of there and you are going to be like a Babylonian you're going to follow our rules you're going to eat our food you're going to like what we like you're going to do like we do it's like going to the University of Arizona you go there and they indoctrinate you you're going to be tolerant on of everybody tolerant it's like I hate that word tolerant of what oh you're going to be tolerant of all this sin you're going to be tolerant of all of of everything that's going on in the world but if you're a Christian no there's no we're not going to be Toler of you right you see the hatred come out when someone stands up for the Lord Jesus you see the hatred come out when somebody says no this is wrong this is sin you see the hatred come out they're not tolerant of you but you have to be tolerant of them and here is this assimilation into society that's going on right now with this Prophet Daniel and his friends as I said and the King appointed them daily provisions of the king's meat and wine which he drank so nourishing them three years and at the end thereof that they might stand before the king now among these were the children of Judah Daniel hananiah mishel and Azariah these are the three friends of Daniel looks like these are his closest friends I don't know that for sure but they're together a lot unto whom the prince of the Unix gave names for he gave unto Daniel the name belshazzar and to hananiah and Sh and and of Shadrach and to mishel of me I'm sorry the name belto Shazer for Daniel and to hananiah of Shadrach and to mishel of meach and to Azariah of Abednego so he's like you're going to come here and you're not even going to keep your Hebrew name you're not going to look like a Hebrew you're not going to act like a Hebrew you are going to be a caldan you are going to be a Babylonian unto whom the um but Daniel proposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself the the um brother Jordan and sister Martha your family me the the song that you just sang this is what it's about it's like dare to be a Daniel it's like no I'm going to stand for what I believe I'm not going to assimilate I'm not going to say something is right or something that's okay when it's not and here's Daniel he's saying wait a minute I don't want to eat this food right I don't want to drink this wine now God had brought Daniel into the favor and tender love with the Prince of the Unix and the prince of the Unix said unto Daniel I fear my Lord the king who hath appointed appointed your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces worse like than the children which are of your sord then shall you make me in danger to my head my head to the king so he's like listen if you don't eat our food that the king told me to feed you you're going to get all skinny and scrawny and you're going to look bad and then we're going to come before the king in 3 years and he's going to say these guys don't look good and I'm done Remember The Temper of the king and the fear that they had for him let's skip down to to verse 17 and of these four children God gave them knowledge Shadrach mhach and abendigo and belto shazzar you know what I don't understand I mean just how come Daniel we call Daniel Daniel right his Hebrew name but we call Shadrach mesach and their Babylonian name I don't understand that maybe because they're fun to say um but I don't know as for these four children God gave them knowledge and skill and all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding and all visions and dreams so we see this man's gifted now at the end of the days that the king had said that should bring them in then the prince of the Unix brought them before Nebuchadnezzar and he had communed with them and among them was found none like Daniel haniah Melle and Azariah therefore stood they before the king now what they what Daniel had said is he says okay you this this food that you're bringing I don't want to eat what I want to eat is pulse you know what pulse is it's vegetables and and and beans and and stuff like that and drink water so the king is like here's a longhorn T-Bone and a Dr Pepper and here is Daniel saying no no no no we want to eat what's right we want to eat well and even all the way down to his diet this man stayed with the word of God and they fed vegetables and fed them uh uh water to drink and they turned out they didn't really lose weight they looked better at the end than even all these other ones and the king communed with them and among them was found none like Daniel haniah mishael and Azariah therefore they stood before the king and in all matters in wisdom and understanding the king inquired of them and he found them 10 times better than all the musici magicians and astrologers and all that were in that his realm and Daniel continued even until the first year of King Cyrus one thing that is is really amazing one of the things that I see because I I've I've done a lot of writing and and you can see a writing style in different people and here the author of Daniel which I assume is Daniel he says and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of him he found them 10 times better than all the magicians and astrologers and all that were in his realm how do you measure 10 times better he's it's a figure of speech and that's you'll see in this Book of Daniel you'll see there's a few of those in there and Daniel's like he's writing he's like we're way better we're 10 times better than all of those other other ones and it's still the word of God then Daniel 2 and in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams wherewith his Spirit was troubled and his sleep break from him so the king couldn't sleep he had insomnia he dreams this dream he was so worried and upset about this about this dream and what does a king probably think the most most of is his kingdom and you see these men as I was saying earlier that are raised to think that they are a God and then the thing that they fear the most is somebody taking what they own somebody taking what they have somebody taking their Kingdom so the King was he's really upset here did you see in the news that another person like this this this ruler of North Korea killed like 30 of his cabinet members recently did you read that you know why he killed him because there was a flood in his country and a bunch of people died and a bunch of land was lost so he gets upset it can't be his fault it's got to be somebody's fault so he goes and he kills s executes a bunch of his cabinet members a bunch of his loyal people now think on that line he's raised to be this man as as set up as a god before the North Korean people and here is this Nebuchadnezzar he's raised to be a a god before his people and the King said unto them I have dreamed a dream and my spirit is troubled to know the dream then spake the calans to the to the king andak oh King live live live forever tell thy servants servants the dream and we will show you the interpretation yeah I'm sure they could anybody can do that you know you can make it up if you're a wise person you could say oh well you dream this and this means this and this means this and everybody goes along like nothing happened but not in this case and the King answered said unto the Cal calans the thing is gone from me I forgot it but if you will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof you shall be cut into pieces and your houses shall be made a dungill but if you show me the dream and the interpretation thereof you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof and they answered again and said let the king tell his servants the dream and we will show you the interpretation like uh just tell us the dream and we'll tell you we we promise we'll tell you what it means and the King answered and said I know of a s of a certainty that you would gain time you're just stalling because you know what's going to happen to you here comes the temper raising up in the king because you see that I've forgotten this thing the thing has gone from me but you will not make known unto me the dream but there is but one decree for you for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and I shall know that you can show me the interpretation of it tell me the dream tell me what I dreamed and then I'll Trust You the calans answered before the king and said there is not a man upon the Earth that can show the king's matter therefore there there is no King Lord nor ruler that asks such things at any M magician or astrologer or caldan and it is a rare thing that the king requires and there is none other that can show it before the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh that they're on the right track for this cause the King was angry and very Furious angry and very Furious so again there's the style of our writer here he said 10 times better and he says now you're he was angry and very Furious and commanded to destroy all of the wise men of Babylon and the decree went forth that the WIS men should be slain and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain because Daniel was part of these wise men do you know who these calans are these wise men are Daniel was the became the leader of these these are the ones that came to Jesus and Saul they were studying the the stars and they saw the star over Bethlehem these are their ancestors so their ancestors were this close to being wiped out right here and Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to aroch the captain of the King's Guard which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon and he answered and said arok the king's Captain why is the decree so Hasty from the King then arok made the thing known to Daniel then Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time and that he would show the king the interpretation that scripture right there I think is is a bit under quoted Daniel had no idea what was going on he had no idea what what this dream was but look at the trust that Daniel had in the gift that's in his life Daniel knew that he was a prophet he knew he had this gift and he said listen he said go tell the king that I'd like to talk with him and I will give him the interpretation but he had no idea what it was look at the faith that's in this young man Daniel then arok made the thing known to Daniel Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time and that he would show him the interpretation then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to haniah mishel and Azariah his companions that they would desire the mercies of God of Heaven concerning this secret that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon so what did he do here this young man he goes to his friends and he says Hey listen this is serious and he says I need your prayers he said friends he said we're all every there's a lot at stake here so please pray that the Lord will give us the interpretation so when we send out the WhatsApp please pray for Sister Anne loer please pray for this person or when we gather together as a church take it seriously amen these young men took it seriously and Daniel even though the prophet and the gifted person that he was he counted on the prayers of his friends and how much should we count on the prayers for each other from each other then was the secret re revealed unto Daniel in a night vision then Daniel blessed the god of H of Heaven Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of God forever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changes the times and the seasons he removes Kings and he sets up Kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that that know understanding he revealeth the Deep Secrets he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him he's giving praise to God I thank thee and praise thee Oh thou God of my fathers who has given me wisdom and might and has made known unto me now that we that we desired of thee for thou Hast now made known unto us the king's matter so the Lord comes to Daniel in the middle of the night and he gives him a vision and he lets him see what was happening with Nebuchadnezzar and see Nebuchadnezzar's dream therefore Daniel went into in unto arok whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon and he went went and said thus unto him destroy not the wise man of Babylon bring me in therefore bring me in before the King and I will show unto the king the interpretation and the King answered and said to Daniel whose name was belshazzar Art Thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen in the interpretation thereof imagine going before this king who is not happy who has a bad temper can't control it and he's about to kill everybody that advises him Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said the secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers the mag M magicians the sers show unto the king he's not asking a question he's making a statement but there is a God in heaven that reveals Secrets notice he even he didn't say brother Jeremiah he didn't say I can do it he said nobody can do this but there is a God in heaven that revealeth the secrets and maketh known the King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days thy dream and the Visions upon thy head visions of thy Head Upon thy bed are these as for thee Oh King thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed what should come to pass Hereafter and he that reveal Secrets make known to thee what shall come to pass so he's saying that you dream this and it's for a purpose God gave you this now he is going to show you what this means notice that God gave this dream to the most influential person really in the world and God remember when I believe it was kesis prophesied about Jesus that one man would die for many and the Bible says that he prophesied because it was his office to prophesy it wasn't because he was a great man but he held an office and here this king holds an office so God is giving him him this dream for a purpose and then he sends a prophet to interpret this dream don't you wish that our leaders United States and everywhere in the world don't you wish that they feared God don't you wish that they would put this Bible above everything else don't you wish that that if they were troubled or or they saw these things that they would seek out God and here's Daniel coming to the to the greatest leader in all the world and he has this interpretation for this dream God recognizes leadership he still does and he recognized Nebuchadnezzar as this leader I believe it was in Jeremiah even said my servant Nebuchadnezzar yeah so God can you use these men but as for me the Seeker do not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living I'm not any better look at the humility of Daniel no wonder he so beloved of the Lord later on when an angel is going to come to him it's he's going to say Daniel highly beloved and you can see why this man Daniel is so special he says he is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than anybody else but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart so the prophet saying I'm not important here in the dream that came to you I'm simply conveying God's interpretation to you a love a true prophet of God how they are able to Humble themselves and put God first first and they can say listen I'm just being used at all this and you can be used of God and if you want to be used of God get yourself out of the way use every one of these prophets as an example Ezekiel I'll tell you what that guy had it rough nobody liked him nobody listened to him but he became one of the greatest prophets in the bible after he died and his his book is preserved for us today and here is this prophet Daniel and he's saying listen I'm nothing I'm not doing this for me but that that it should be known to you this this interpretation Thou King thou oh King sawest and behold a great image now L listen to watch the king he's probably like wow as Daniel talks think about what this king is thinking oh King saw us and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible terrible means frightening or powerful this image's head was a fine gold and his breast and his arms of silver and his belly and his thighs of brass not only is Daniel telling him his dream but he's going to give him the interpretation also his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay the fine gold Daniel's going to go on and he's going to say this fine gold of the head of this image it's the most powerful of them all and the greatest of them all and this represents the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar and him and then less value and inferior to Gold his chest and his arms were made from Silver and that is prophesying of some another kingdom that's going to come in of two you have two arms the mes and the Persians Daniel or Nebuchadnezzar had already happened and they were in the middle of the the the head of gold then in the near future the mes and the Persians are soon going to come up they're going to rise up and they're going to conquer Babylon so the dream is prophetic even though it came through this seemingly evil man and he keep he continues on with the with the meaning of the dream this mes and Persians this is Cyrus and those that that come in later on in the midsection the thighs of brass this will happen decades down the road this is the Greek Empire that's going to come in you know who a great Greek that we all know part of this Kingdom Alexander the Great and then the hardest and the longest lasting of all of this is the iron his legs were of iron and this is the Roman Empire with the Caesars and all that we go down the head it becomes less Val valuable and less malleable less able to bend let's skip to verse 45 for time sake actually let's just read it I I uh he he goes through and he tells it thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smokee the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them into pieces then was the iron and the clay and the brass and silver and the gold broken in pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing for and the wind carried them away and that no place was found in them and that the stone that smot the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king now what I just said listen to Daniel say it thou oh king art king of kings or a king of kings for the god of Heaven hath delivered thee a kingdom power and strength and Glory So Daniel he's saying King God God gave you the kingdom and God gave you the power and the strength and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and of the the fowls in the heaven that hath he given into the hand hath made thee a ruler over them all thou art this head of gold God made you this Nebuchadnezzar you're the ruler you're the head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and a third Kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over the earth and the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breaks into pieces and and subdueth all things and as iron that breakthe things shall it break in pieces and Bruise whereas thou saw us the feet and the toes part of The Potter's clay and part of the iron and the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in the strength of the iron for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with myy clay and as the toes of the feet were part iron and part clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken whereas th th sawest iron mixed with Clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men and they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these Kings shall the god of heaven so he's saying that these this iron and clay and the feet that this represents different Kings we're going to hear about this in the Book of Revelation in fact we're going to hear about later on in Daniel and then we'll hear about it again in the Book of Revelation um I'll I'll pause right there the 70 weeks of Daniel the Daniel series it's a great one to listen to as we are going through this Daniel and you'll see the things that I'm saying you'll see where I get them and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break into pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands that it break in the pieces of iron the brass the clay the silver the gold the great God ha made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped Daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors into him and the King answered Daniel and said of a truth it is that your God is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of Secrets seeing that thou couldest reveal this secret then the king made Daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him a ruler over the province of Babylon and the chief of the governors over the wise men of Babylon then Daniel requested of the king remember he remembered his friends and he said Shadrach and meach and abedo over the Affairs of the province of Babylon but Daniel sat in the gate of the king and we will stop with Daniel 2 the musicians can come and I want to lay a foundation for Daniel 3 so put yourself in this king's place so you're an idolator and and and you you've been raised a certain way and then Here Comes This Man and you have this bad dream and it's tearing you up and you can't sleep and there's all these different problems and here comes this man and he tells you what's wrong with you he tells you your dream he tells you personal things he looks right into your heart and your mind and he explains what's going on and he then not only does he do that but he gives the interpretation of what's going to happen what would you do as an idolator what would you do as someone that doesn't know if this man comes and the greatness of this man something that you've never seen before in your life that the world seems like it's never seen and here it comes before you and you see this what would you do you give him gifts and stuff but there's more that happens after this and we'll get to that in chapter three there you deserve the glory and the are Lord we lift our hands in worship as we lift your Holy Name you deserve the glory and beond Lord we lift our hands and worship as we live your holy name for you are great you do me Mires so great there is no one else like you there is no one else for you are great you do mirales oh so great there is no one else like you there is no one else like brothers and sisters The Book of Daniel is really great it's it's got great it's got just incredible stories in it and it's got prophecies that we are seeing fulfilled today thousands of years later Adam did I get all the questions did you get the quiz did I did I cover all the questions I give the kids kids quiz so so they can they can read through and as I'm going that uh they can uh answer questions in there and the things that I put on the quiz are the things that are very very plainly explained in the Bible so we have a good foundation for the Book of Daniel so what I want to do is I I said it on my WhatsApp broadcast this morning what I would like to do is follow This Book of Daniel and I'll try to get done by the end of the month when we go to camp and then the theme of our camp will be standing like Daniel stood where Daniel stood up against all all the influences of the world Babylon was around him and why so many people they want to be like the world it's just natural for us we want to be like the world we don't want to be different we don't want to be weird we want to be just like everybody else but God requires a Daniel God requires us not to con form to the things of the world or the things the the um whatever it is and it might be something in church even stand your ground always no matter what it is it may be pressure from school it may be pressure from work it may be pressure even from he from Friends stand your ground be a Daniel be like this man he did not conform to the Babylonian ways he didn't conform to their idolatry he stood up against them and then God stood for him I want to be like this man Daniel wait till we get to the uh Lion's Den I'll give you a little a little foreshadowing Daniel was condemned well Daniel wasn't condemned there was a law that was passed that you shouldn't pray in uh in a in a certain way and that you had to pray to this to this [Music] statue well Daniel he um or pray to the king well Daniel he came home and he opened the windows in his house and it was right after the decree went out Daniel goes home and he opens the window so everybody can see and he gets down and he prayed to Jehovah God something that was against the law but he made a stand and his life was on the line in fact he was condemned to death great man and his friends did the same thing the king told them to bow down to the statue they said no King we ain't going to do it and then they were condemned to death and then we see Nebuchadnezzar's temper rise up in him again but then he he he comes back a little bit like like he did right here that's all stand one more you deserve the gold and the all Lord we lift our hands and worship as we lift your Holy Name you deserve the glory and the H Lord we lift our hands to worship as we LIF your holy for you are great yes you are Lord you do mirales so great there is no one else I you there is no one else like you for you are great you do mirales so great there is no else like there is no brother Amos could I get you to close my brother would you come he does Miracles so great and there's no one else like you I I love thinking this thought the same God that Daniel Prayed to is the same God that we pray to and he hasn't changed and he still does Miracles so great and he still does the same things if we would just let him be first in our [Music] life well it's good to be here tonight um I was I got a call last night to to take a flight here to Tucson we got to the plane things weren't ready flight got delayed and um so we get here to Tucson and we were supposed to fly back to Houston today they cancelled our flight back to back to Houston and I was able to be here tonight so thank the Lord for that just bow our heads dear heavenly father I'm so thankful Lord just as I was riding in the car with with Daniel and just thanking the lord how I could be here tonight Lord just to be in church Lord God I I really appreciate it that I could come to

said Daniel realized there was just two years left so I said I think he started singing bu land I'm longing for you amen I'm kind of home for a [Music] country to which [Music] I forb before no sad goodbye will there for time [Music] Willmore oh oh Beau land I am longing for you and [Music] someday on the stand there my home shall be turn you love sweet the land I was on my way well when when I was thinking about meditating on what to do yesterday on um if we should spread the Book of Daniel out or if uh we should I should just dedicate one service like we've been doing to it the thought came to my mind that well we need we need to move forward we can't we can't just stop and then I thought well why what else are we going to do we just move to another book but then I thought well if we don't get to his josea if we don't get to these these other ones and the Lord comes then you can just have them explain their book to you directly rather than me trying to get through it so brothers and sisters if if the Lord comes I look forward to sitting at Daniel's feet and listen to him give us testimonies of of Nebuchadnezzar and and of his friends and and his prophecy because he'll know and I look forward to the book The Prophecies of Daniel being fulfilled I think it's pretty obvious and that U many of them have been fulfilled Daniel even says that they have been and and the Lord says that they had been when when Jesus was talking about about him but I look forward to all of these prophecies being being finished and then our time being here on on Earth being over and then we can just rest in the presence of our Lord Jesus from now into eternity until that time stand like Daniel be strong don't conform to the things of the world stand up against it because God will honor that you can be like everybody else in the world you can just be a clone or you can be a Daniel you can be somebody that's different God bless you brothers and sisters I think what I'll do is I'll send out a um a WhatsApp um reminder for which sermons to look at to uh listen to um that are on these Daniel 70 weeks does that sound good then you'll know which dates and stuff I'll send that
