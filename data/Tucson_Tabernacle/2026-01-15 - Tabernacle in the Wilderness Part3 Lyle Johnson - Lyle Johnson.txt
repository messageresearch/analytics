TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God on the mountain. Life is easy sometimes and when when everything's going [music] well. Oh, life is easy when [music] you're up on [singing] the mountain.

I think that's all the visitors that we have. Um uh first the announcement of Harmony in the Desert is going to be in Phoenix this year. It's going to be this weekend, Saturday night at uh the Phoenix Tabernacle starts at six o'clock in the evening. I just updated updated the website earlier today. So that's there. And then I have not updated the website yet with this. There's going to be a youth meeting on Sunday night at Arizona Believers Fellowship. That's in Glendale. And uh that is Aaron McGarry's church, good friend of mine. Um so remember remember that. And then we also have our children's church this weekend. So I want you kids to be there. I think uh we're going to have at least one special speaker. Last time we had uh a young man was eight years old and he did a great job. We're looking forward to hopefully more of the more of the same this this coming weekend. I loved it last time. Man, it was a blessing to see the kids uh singing and coming up here on the altar and and uh talking, telling Bible stories and then having young Elijah preach. I was just loving it. So, I uh I think this is going to be it's just going to keep getting better. So, make sure to come this Sunday night. I I know it'll be a blessing to you. Um the uh I want to give a testimony before we start before we uh we go to prayer. And uh I was having lunch with a good friend of mine, Gerald Hughes. He's a pastor in South Carolina. And uh we're at this bagel shop on Oracle Road. And um we were just talking back and forth and there was a a group of four ladies sitting next to us and uh it was obviously a mom and her three daughters, Hispanic family. They were talking in Spanish and I was talking to Brother Gerald and I just something was just pulling on me with these three ladies over here to the left. The mom was probably around my age and uh the daughters were I don't know anywhere from Daniel and Josiah's age on down to about I don't know 15 or so. And there was three daughters and then the mom speaking in Spanish and my ear caught the word Jesus and uh then I kind of got my attention and they were literally I mean they were just a few feet away and uh I could tell there there was a bit of a contentious conversation going on in Spanish And I just felt like the Lord told me just talk to them. So I uh I turned and I scooted over a little bit closer up to their table and I said, "Are are you all Christians?" And the one young lady, the oldest young lady says, "I am." And she says, "My mom, she's Catholic. She's not." And the mom says, "Yeah, no, I'm not." And and I could tell, I could feel it. That's what they were talking about. And then the young lady says, "I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus and now I'm a Christian and I'm not I'm not Catholic anymore." And I said, "Okay." And then I I see the mom there. And I I kind of felt for the mom. I could tell she was just kind of not going to say anything. And I said, 'Listen, I said, I want to ask all of you ladies here at this table. I said, the Bible teaches us, Jesus himself said that there will be one shepherd and one flock. I said, now I want all four of you, I said, who is the shepherd? And the young lady said, "Jesus." And I looked at the mom. I said, "Is that the shepherd? Is that your shepherd, too?" She says, "Oh, yes. Yes." I said, "So, if there's one shepherd," and I said, "All of us here can agree that we believe in this one shepherd of Jesus Christ." I said, "Aren't we in the same flock?" And the mom looked at me and I could just, you know, you can tell I could just feel a a burden start to lift off of this lady. And she started smiling and she said, "Yes." And I I looked at the daughter who had just given her heart to the Lord Jesus and been baptized. I said I said, "How about you?" I said I said, "Is your shepherd Jesus Christ?" And she said she said, "Yes." I said, "Are you from a different flock than your mom?" She says, "No." And that contentious conversation when Jesus was lifted up as the supreme in all things, that contentious argument stopped and it was replaced with smiles and and happiness and and they started talking to each other and they started laughing around the table and and they got up and uh I said, "By the way, I said, "I'm a pastor." And and my my friend here's a pastor. And they're like, "Oh, this this is just so good." And and then the mom, Catholic, she said, "Oh, we want to go to your church." [laughter] And I said, I said, "Okay." I said, I I said, "It's Tucson Tabernacle." I didn't have any cards with me. And and I I felt bad, but I um they started they started just fellowshipping and what was once contention &gt;&gt; was replaced by unity. &gt;&gt; And that is what happens friends when there is division. It is never about Jesus. It's always about something else. &gt;&gt; Wow. But when you have one flock and one shepherd, then you have unity. One day there is going to be unity in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ himself prayed for it. And I pray that we will one day see that because I believe when that happens is when the Lord Jesus will return for his united body. Let's all stand. I um I'm in almost daily contact with the Oha family and uh the um the the daughter um Sabrina, she uh it's it's up and down, but she's back on the ventilator. Um and uh I had a wonderful friends. Let me tell you something. We saw a miracle last week in that hospital room. We saw the doctors were there. We saw someone who had no brain function. We prayed and then the next day I was talking to her. They took the tube out and she was conversing and she was giving praise to the Lord Jesus for his salvation and his goodness. the young lady that that uh she needed it. And I believe that not only is that going to be the miracle, I believe that we are going to see a greater miracle happen in that family. The uh the 8-year-old boy, he um he's still um struggling. The uh the two younger ones, the 2-year-old and the three-year-old are um they're doing they're doing better. So, please remember them. continue to pray for them. Um, brother, I think, uh, sister Rachel and also my wife Stephanie talked with Amber Bowman um, today and uh, Stephanie's been in touch with Amber. She lost her son David. I mean, he's about I don't know, I think he was around 18, 19 years old to colon cancer. And um, she uh, she had a hard time and she's I mean, she's still having a hard time. It hasn't been that long. But um they want to uh they want to do something, you know, for David. So just pray with pray with us about that and pray for Amber. She's uh many of you know Amber from a long time ago here. She's um she's been to our family camps and um just she's friends with Stephanie and she's just I think very highly of her and her family. um remember them and uh of course remember sister Esther Alcanter um time the old saying as time is a healer of all wounds so as time goes by she'll get stronger and stronger but these are hard times for for sister Esther and and and the family there um sister Ununice deeds write writes this she says please pray for my neighbors that the Lord Lord would intervene on their behalf. They're in a serious situation and they have three small children. God bless their heart. Sister Ununice, we would certainly pray for this family. Is anyone else? That's all the written requests I have, but if you have a request on your heart that you would like to be made known, I know that sometimes you have to do something and even if it's just raising your hand, God will see it. So if you have a request on your heart or something that you're praying about, you can lift up your hand and bring it before the Lord. Let's bow our heads. Our father, we thank you, Lord, that you are a prayer answering God. We pray, Father, for these prayer requests for Sister Ununice's neighbor, Lord, that I don't know what the situation is, but Lord, you know that you would have your way and may it work out, Lord, for the good and for a testimony. The family, Lord, the O'Hada family that has the children in the hospital, Lord, we pray for them. Give strength to mom and dad. We pray and the grandparents and Lionel and Lonnie as they help with the family and the Salazar family. Father, give them strength and bless them. Lord, Sister Amber Bowman, her husband, Lord, I pray for her that and him that you would give them strength. May they find strength, Lord, in Jesus Christ. Lord, we love you and we thank you. pray for this family that I saw today. Lord, I believe you did something in their lives. You brought peace to them. And I I pray that that your Holy Spirit, Father, would give them peace. And may they, Lord, draw closer to you every day of their life. And for the hands that are raised, Lord, bless each person that raised their hand. And Father, I pray that you would answer every request in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. And we're going to do this song yet. Not I, the Christ, the Christ in me. But I've asked brother Josiah if he would would do [music] the song. He just can get he get the tempo much better than I do on that song. What gift of grace [singing] is Jesus my redeemer? There is no more [singing] for heaven now to give. He is my [singing] joy, my righteousness [music] and freom. My steadfast [singing] love, my [music] deep and boundless peace. To this I hold. [singing] My hope is [music] only Jesus. [singing] For my life is [music] wholly bound to his. Oh, how strange [singing] and [music] divine I can sing. All is mine yet not I but through Christ [singing] [music] in me. The night is dark [singing] but I am not forsaken. [music] For by [singing] my side the Savior He [music] will stay. I labor [singing] on in weakness and rejoiceing. [music] For in my [singing] need [music] his power is displayed. [singing] To this I hold. My shepherd will [singing] [music] defend me. Through the deepest [music and singing] valley he will lead. Oh the night [singing] has been one and I shall overcome [music and singing] yet not I but through Christ in me. [singing] No fate I dread. I know I [singing] am forgi [music] the future sure [singing] the price it has been paid. Do you believe that? For Jesus [music] [singing] bled and suffered for my pardon and [music] he was raised to overthrow the grave. Do this I hold. My sin has [singing] been [music] defeated. Jesus [singing] now and ever is my [music] plea. [singing] Oh the chains are released. I can [music] sing. I am free yet not I but through [singing] Christ in [music] me. Sing this next verse as a declaration. With every [singing] breath I long to follow Jesus, for he has said that he will bring me [music and singing] home. And day by day [singing] [music] I know he will renew me until I stand [singing] with joy before the throne. To this [singing] I hold. My hope is only Jesus. All the glory [singing] ever more to him. When the race is complete, still my [singing and music] lips shall repeat. Yet not I, but [music] through [singing] Christ in me. To this I hold. To [music] this I hold. My hope is only [singing] Jesus. All the glory [singing] ever more to him. When the race is complete, [music and singing] still my lips shall repeat. Yet not I, but through Christ in me when the race when the race is complete, [music] still my lips shall repeat. [singing] Yet not I, but through Christ in me. [singing] Yet not I, but through Christ in me. Yet not I, but through Christ in me. Do &gt;&gt; you appreciate that God would do that for you? because we could never do it ourselves. [applause] &gt;&gt; We'll stand and prepare for brother Lyall this this evening. And I know the Lord is going to use him today because yesterday I reached out to him just late late afternoon early evening and I usually he has a song and he hadn't sent one out yet. So I reach out to him and he just said, "I'm struggling." And it and if you've ever ministered, it can [music] be that way. You know, you just sometimes you're pulled a hundred ways. Sometimes you feel no pull at all, but you trust in him. So when when you get into that situation, you start praying and seeking God and asking and he answers. So and if you'll draw, if you'll say, "Lord, speak to me," God will give you. So, and as I thought about that, I I said, even when things are hard, God is still good. God is so good. Amen. Oh, God is so good. God is so good. [music] God [singing] is so good. He's so good to [music] me. Oh, he [music] gave [singing] his life. He [singing] gave his life. [music] He gave [singing] his life. He's so good, [singing] too. He [music] rose again. And he [singing] rose again. [music] He rose [singing] again. [music] He [singing] rose again. And [music] he's [singing] so good, too. God is [music] so good. Oh, [singing] God [music] is so good. [music] God is so good. God [singing] [music] is so good. He's [singing] so good to [music] me. Amen. [music] It's true. It's so true. Thank you. Thank you so much. Let me uh get this part going. Thank you for joining us here tonight for part three of our exploration of the tabernacle in the wilderness. I must begin with a correction and an apology. Last time I indicated that Egypt did not have bronze or brass and stated that bronze was a combination of copper and zinc. Incorrect. Brass, not bronze, is an alloy of copper and zinc. Egypt did not have brass. Copper and tin are the normal composition of bronze. But copper alloyed with arsenic, sometimes called dirty copper, is another form of bronze. And Egypt did have that kind of bronze. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Yes. I'm sorry that I misstated these facts. And uh one other thing I like to say that uh in the third row there, I think the row that you were in, Sister Hope, uh there's envelopes. Don't touch them. A couple of envelopes here and a couple of envelopes in the back. I want you to not mess with the envelopes. But about a half hour from now, I'm going to need six volunteers to come and stand by those envelopes. So, prepare yourself, those of you that want to volunteer. Uh there'll be a minor reward if you uh choose to assist. So, moving on. The first time we met about the tabernacle in the wilderness, we observed the tabernacle in its courtyard from the perspective of a person approaching the tabernacle complex for the first time. This view is of a full-size tabernacle model located in the southern desert of Israel. What did he or she see? What questions formed in the mind of the observer? What answers might there be? What was symbolic about the things observed? Last time we entered the courtyard and saw the altar, the altar of sacrifice, the barefoot priests and their clothing. We concluded with the lav or basin where the priests washed as they performed their duties. This evening, we'll look at the tabernacle itself. But before we begin before we begin this evening's exploration, please join me once more in prayer. Lord Jesus, it's a great honor to be standing here, Lord, with your people. Lord, you are the shepherd and we are part of your flock. Lord, we just pray that you'd be with us tonight, Lord. that you guard my lips that I don't say any other misstatements any worse than brass and bronze and Lord that uh you just be with us tonight. We thank you. We we expect great things from you and we thank you for your presence in Jesus name. Amen. Recall that at the sacrificial altar there was to be a morning sacrifice of a lamb and an evening sacrifice. And just beyond the altar and the lavver, we see the dominant structure within the courtyard, a large tent or tabernacle. Let's read our topic verses for tonight before we're seated about how those tie together and their importance. Exodus chapter 29, the Lord speaking directly to Moses. Now this is that which thou shalt offer offer upon the altar. Two lambs of the first year day by day continually. The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning and the other lamb thou shalt offer it even skipping down to verse 42. This shall be a continual burnt offering. That doesn't mean it's continuously burning, but offered every day throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord, where I will meet you to speak there unto thee. This is the precise location where the Lord will speak to Moses. And not only Moses, but he goes on to say, "And there I, the Lord, will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by the offerings." No, by the sacrifices, no, by my glory or splendor. Put another way, God will be present there. And it is sanctified by the fact of his presence. And I the Lord, not Moses, not Aaron, not the priests, but I will sanctify, consecrate, hallow, declare ceremonially clean the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar. I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to minister to the congregation. No, to minister to me in the priest's office. office here is not a location where you have a desk but a set of duties and responsibilities. Where will they minister to the Lord? In the tabernacle complex. And what is the overarching purpose of all this? And I will dwell, live, have my abode among the children of Israel, and will be their God. and they shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh their God that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt that I may dwell among them. God wants to be among his people just as he was with Adam in the garden. He says he performed all the miracles that defeated Egypt for one purpose that he might dwell among them. I am the Lord their God. We'll see as we delve into the tabernacle itself that this will become or be regarded as the dwelling place of Yahweh, the invisible God of Israel. Not a dwelling place, but the dwelling place. Please be seated. To see the tabernacle, we must first come into the courtyard through its only entrance, reminding us that the way to God is through the only entrance he has provided for us, and that is Jesus Christ. He told us he was the way, the truth, and the life. The only way. As we stare in awe at this tent erected in the wilderness, what do we see? We see five tall, slender golden pillars set in copper or bronze bases. A large colorful cloth forming a curtain which is the sole entrance to whatever might be hidden inside the structure that's covered by the tent. We see a gold tinted reflection of light along what appears to be a wall enclosing the structure that is under the tent covering. a multi-layer fabric and leather covering forming the tent itself. We notice a priest standing by the entrance. This is a large structure. Questions form in our mind. Just how big is this thing? What are its dimensions? What are the layers of fabric and animal skins that comprise the tent part itself? And what do they mean? The Bible gives us a lot of information about the tabernacle, usually from the inside out, but we're observing it from the outside, seeing it for the first time. Let's see what we can learn as we gaze upon it. The covering over the structure appears to have four layers. The innermost looks like it is woven with patterns that uh look like people with wings. The next layer appears to be made from some kind of wool or animal hair. Then some kind of red leather and the outer layer seems to be yet another kind of lay leather. So let's start from the outside and let's read about the layers of the tent covering in order from the innermost to the outer as the Lord told Moses. We'll skip through some of the description trying to just hit the highlights. You can read all the details of the tabernacle in the book of Exodus. Exodus chapter 26, God is giving instructions to Moses. Moreover, thou shalt make the tabernacle with 10 curtains of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet with cherubim of cunning work shalt thou make them. Each curtain has woven into the fabric an image of or representing cherubim. This is a transliterated word sounding in English similar to the sound of the word in Hebrew. A cherub is a winged being, a kind of angel. It has two wings. The length of one curtain shall be 42 feet. And the breadth of the curtain six feet. Every one of the curtains shall have one measure. All all 10 of them are the same size and shape. So here here you see what one might have looked like. We don't know what the actual pattern was. The cherub in the inset is standing up with his wings raised like this to help you see the pattern of four of them and that horizontal stripe at the top. The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another sewn together, thus forming a large panel measuring 42 feet by 30 feet. Thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge. 50 loops thou shalt make in each curtain of five panels, that the loops may take hold of one another. The edges with the loops will be adjacent to each other. So, here we see five of the small curtains stitched together to make a large panel or curtain. I've outlined one of the small curtains in yellow to help you see the repetition of its pattern in the other four. There are two such panels of five. There are loops sewn into one edge of the combined curtain to allow for the two to be joined. This method allows the linen curtain to be broken down for transport. The tabernacle will be set up, broken down, and transported many times. And thou shalt make 50 taches, it means clasps or fasteners of gold, and couple the two curtains together with the clasps. And it shall be one tabernacle, one tent, a single covering when coupled together. The fittings are of gold that are closest to the interior of the structure. So, here we see the general plan of that linen covering. And Martha did bring her binoculars so she can she can read that even though she's in the back row. These are attached to form a single covering that's 42 feet by 60 feet. Each panel is naturally of white linen with blue, purple, and red woven threads resulting in a pattern of cherabs. If one is standing inside the tabernacle structure looking up, this pattern would be visible as the ceiling. The cherubs, these angels, remind us that though they're not visible, we are surrounded by a heavenly host and that the Lord is surrounded by and dwells in the midst of heavenly beings who reminded of Isaiah seeing the Lord with all of the saraphim there. The illustration shows a bold dashed gold line down the center. Trust me, it's there. indicating where the two halves are joined by the 50 clasps of gold. The colors in the linen we've examined before. Blue often signified the heavens and by extension the divine presence. Scarlet or bright red represented the blood of sacrifice, the penalty for sin and on a spiritual level a cleansing agent. Purple dye was rare and expensive. Purple res represented royalty and wealth. If you think about it, purple is a combination of red and blue. White represents righteousness. What does gold symbolize? Gold is a symbol of divine power, presence, favor. It also represents purity and holiness. It's costly, signifying wealth, and blessings. Gold is durable and longasting. Moving on. Thou shalt make curtains of goats hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle. In other words, to cover over that patterned linen fabric. The hair is spun into yarn woven into a heavy cloth. 11 curtains shalt thou make. There were 10 linen. There's 11 goats hair. And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. So, you're going to make two panels. One of five of these curtains and one of six. And just like the linen, thou shalt make 50 loops on the edge of each panel. And make 50 clasps of gold. No, no, of copper or brass, and put the clasps into the loops and couple the tent together that it may be one. So unlike the linen tent, the clasps here are made with copper. They're indicating uh judgment rather than uh holiness. These are not visible from the inside of the tabernacle's structure. So this gives a general plan of the cover of goat's hair. The panel on the left side will later be folded on itself, which will shorten the length from 66 to 63 feet. The clasps joining this layer again are copper, translated in King James's brass. Again, it's a metal that symbolizes judgment. In many commentaries, you'll find a statement that the goat's hair was white. Anybody seen a white goat? Yeah, there's lots of white goats. This is then tied to an observation about sanctification. However, most sources that I have found indicate that white-haired goats were not in this area of the world at the time the tabernacle was constructed. goats were dark brown or black. This makes sense in light of Solomon's song about his bride. Song of Solomon chapter 4, we read, "Behold, thou art fair, my love. Behold, thou art fair. Thou hast dove's eyes within thy locks. Thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear for Mount Gilead." Middle Eastern people have dark hair in general, sometimes red like we think Joseph, but not blonde and certainly not white, unless they're very old, of course. I doubt Solomon wrote his song about an old woman. So, this is the goat's hair curtain. It will cover the linen curtain with about an 18inch border all the way around. It's It's larger. Notice the position of the copper clasps I've extended and below the drawing to make it clear. This illustration shows how the goat's hair cover is larger on each side than the linen. It thus protects the linen cover completely. You'll notice a place where the two pieces of each cover are joined by the clasps are slightly offset. The copper clasp line is just visible. I've extended it to make it easier to find. The line of gold clasps is plain down the center of the linen curtain. This ensures that the gaps in the joining are not in the same place, protecting the tabernacle interior from dust and rain. What's next? One verse. Thou shalt make a covering for the tent of ram's skins dyed red and a covering above of badgers skins. So the outermost cover is made of leather. This badger skins thing is from an animal that in Hebrew was called a tahash. It's translated as badger skins, but there weren't badgers in that part of the world. It's sometimes called seal skin, but it's hard to imagine many seals in the desert or even in the Red Sea. Dolphins live there, not seals. Some translations say dolphin skin. Others say fine leather, leather from goats. Strong's concordance speculates it may have been a species of analopee. In other words, no one is certain what animal is meant by the word takish, translated as badger in the King James. The two outer covers of the tabernacle structure are of leather. No dimensions are given. It's generally thought they were at least as large as the goat's hair cover, perhaps a bit larger. This view shows three possibilities. The the upper left shows the badger skin leather. Here the leather covers which are flared out from the tabernacle are about the same size as the goat's hair cover which hangs down on the sides. The image at the upper right shows the red and white outer cover the same size as the goats and shows the goat's hairs being white. All three layers are flared out from the side of the structure and staked down. The bottom panel shows another concept with the red leather large and hanging down while only the top cover is staked and flared and it's not as large. There are some, however, who contend that the leather covers were smaller. They were a covering above. This image shows a tabernacle model with goat's hair cover in dark brown. The red and tackish leather just covering the very top surface of the tabernacle. The ram skin reminds us that the ram was a sacrificial animal and the red color reminds us that blood sacrifices were required. These then are the the four layers of the covering of the tabernacle. Linen the innermost goat's hair red leather and finally leather from a takish a known to us animal. The innermost linen has gold clasps reflecting the divine. And the second layer's clasps are of bronze or copper signifying judgment. The outer layers are leather representing sacrifice and redemption by blood. But what's being covered by these covers? What's being protected by these four layers? Let's look now at the structure itself which is to be covered by these four coverings. I know all of this can seem a bit tedious, but as Paul wrote to Timothy, all scripture, which the ones we like, all scripture is given by inspiration of God. Other translations say God breathed and is when only for the past, only for the future. No, for the present. All scripture is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. To what end purpose? That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. That includes the portions we're studying from Exodus about the tabernacle in the wilderness. Bear with me. I think there are lessons for us to apply daily in our lives as Christians. Back to our question. What are the curtains and skins covering? Exodus tells us, "Thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of Shatimwood standing up." Shhatim is again a transliteration of a Hebrew word. Most translators suggest that this is acacia. 10 cubits shall be the length of a board and a cubit and a half the breadth. In other words, the board's going to be 15 feet long and a little over two feet wide. There'll be two tenins, short legs or feet shall there be in each board. Thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle. We're in the desert. This is an image of an acacia growing in the desert of Saudi Arabia. It's mature, but not huge. Sort of like a mosquite that we have around here or perhaps a rather large palivvery. How can one cut a board 15 feet long and more than two feet wide from this kind of a tree? I can't do it. And these guys didn't have the tools that we have today. There's a widely agreed answer that the acacia was used to make frames. The completed frame forming a board. In the end, we don't know, but this is possible and certainly plausible explanation. You can see a frame, couple of tenins, little feet at the bottom going into sockets, the silver block at the bottom. It certainly ties in with the concept described by Paul in Ephesians chapter 2. Now therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God, one flock, and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, and now to us, in whom all the building fitly what framed together groweth unto a what? Holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are builded together for what? An habitation of God through the spirit. The New Testament tabernacle, if you will, God's dwelling place changes from being among the people to being within the people. &gt;&gt; We become the tabernacle. back to Exodus in the wilderness tabernacle. Thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle. 20 boards on the south side, southward, the south side of it. 20 boards uh is 20 is thought to represent redemption. Thou shalt make 40 sockets of silver under the 20 boards. Two sockets under one board for his two tenins and two sockets under another board for his two. So 40 representing judgment. no longer bronze or copper, but now a foundation of silver, separating the boards of the tabernacle wall from the earth. Silver, as we discussed in part one, is a symbol especially of redemption, purity, and value. And just as we read in Ephesians, Christ our redeemer as chief cornerstone in Paul's metaphor is represented here as the foundation bridging between the earth and the divine. Skipping to verse 22. It didn't hear me. Okay. And for the sides of the tabernacle westward, thou shalt make six boards, so a width of nine cubits, or about 13 1/2 ft. And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it into one ring. Huh? Got that? Yeah. Me neither. As in life, turning a corner can be complicated. Here we see a couple of possibilities. On the left, the corner board's inside the tabernacle, taking up some interior space. On the right, the corner board is on the outside. Again, we don't know. I've had people describe them as cylinders. But as with the tabernacle, we need to let the master builder put us in the right place. He knows oftenimes we're just guessing. He's the master builder. We're bricks and parts. Skipping to verse 26. Thou shalt make bars of chhatimwood, five for the boards of each side of the tabernacle. And the middle bar in the midst of the board shall reach from end to end. These bars tie together the boards that comprise the walls. Five represents grace. And it's only by his grace that we can stand and stand together. Like the middle bar, his grace in our midst extends all the way to the end. If the boards are really frames made of acacia wood, how are the frames panled? Thou shalt overlay the boards with gold and make their rings of gold for places for the bars and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold. This combination of acacia wood representing humanity overlaid with gold representing divinity illustrates the inseparable nature of Christ's humanity and divinity. Fully God, fully man. Any questions about any details? What a cherub looks like, how the acacia boards are made, or the corners. No, there's a lot of things we don't know. Thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof, which was showed thee in the mount. We don't know the details, but he does. Here we see the gold covered boards or frames sitting in the silver sockets forming three walls. It's hard to see. It's really hard to see, but the upper and lower crossarss only extend halfway. I've circled the gaps. There are total of five crossarss forming three rows. Again, we see grace and we see perfection. The entire cross the center crossbar extends the entire length of the wall. So, we have a north wall and a south wall, each 45 ft long. The west wall is nine cubits, 13 and 1/2 ft on the inside with these corners. But what about the east end, the entrance to the tabernacle itself? Thou shalt make a hanging for the door of the tent of blue and purple and scarlet and fine twined linen wrapped with needle work. This is similar to the hanging over the entrance to the courtyard. Same colors, same description. Thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of chhatimwood and overlay them with gold and their hooks shall be of gold and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them. So again we have copper bases for the end of the tabernacle facing the outer court and the sacrificial altar. Everything facing the outer court has bases of copper called brass in in the King James. This includes the basis for the support of the linen outer wall, the entry pillars of the tabernacle structure, the sacrificial altar and basin where the priest's wash are also copper. All of the tools used in the outer court are of the same metal. The tops of the wooden post in the outer court are capped in silver and the bases of the gold covered boards of the tabernacle structure are also of silver. Everything above those bases is made of are covered with gold inside the tabernacle structure. The linen covering which forms the ceiling of the tabernacle uses gold clasps. So every metallic thing visible within the metal within the tabernacle structure is or is covered in gold. The exceptions are the bases for the walls which are silver. The bases for the five pillars supporting the entry curtain which are copper or bronze are hidden from the inside by the curtain itself. There's one more part of the structure. It's not visible from the courtyard, but since we're describing the structure, we'll include it. The interior is divided into two spaces. Thou shalt make a veil of blue and purple and scarlet and fine twined linen of cunning work. With cherubim it shall be made. So like the linen cover, this theme of the weaving will be of cherubs. The four colors are the same for all the curtains. the outer door, the tabernacle proper, and this interior veil, but only the inner veil has cherubs. Thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of chhatim wood overlaid with gold. Their hooks shall be of gold upon the four sockets of silver. So that we had five gold colored wooden gold covered wooden pillars on copper bases hanging the outer curtain. The external doorway but this inner one is from four gold covered wooden pillars set on silver bases. Thou shalt hang up the veil under the clasps that thou mayest bring in thither within the veil of the ark of the testimony. We'll talk about the ark next time. And the veil shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy. This curtain is often called the inner veil. The dimensions of these curtains aren't given. We assume they fill the doorway they're protecting with sufficient slack to hang without being stretched to the sides. I need six volunteers. I'm I'm seeing some some adults raising their hands. I'd like to see some kids. Liam, I see you. Liam, if you come up up here, buddy, just for a couple minutes. It's only This is going to be really easy thing. Okay. And just stand right by this envelope. Okay. Asher, I need you to stand by this envelope. Okay. I see I see I see lots of hands out here. Suddenly, I've got lots of volunteers. Oh, here's an envelope. Okay. Okay, we're getting close. Okay, Chloe. Okay. Oh, here's another one. Oh, and it's on on purple. Wow, it's royal. Okay, I need you to stand by that envelope for just a minute. Okay, I've got two more. Where did they go? Well, here's one on the floor right here. Oh, okay. Yeah, I had a volunteer arranged before service. Yes, you can come. Okay, I need you to come over here. I just found another envelope. Okay, I want you to stand. No, come in here. Come in here. I want you to stand by this envelope. Okay, everybody can see our six volunteers. Okay, I want each volunteer to please pick up your envelope and hold it up. Hold it up. Keep holding it up. Stand where the envelope is. Yeah. Stand where the and hold it up. Okay. Now, this is the size of the tabernacle. What direction is this? [snorts] East. The door was on the east. So, you came from the altar and you come through a curtain. It's right here. Okay. There's some stuff in here. And eventually there's this second curtain that we saw. This this inner veil is right here. And and and yeah, you're still doing it. Keep it up. Keep it up. Okay. And then this is the back wall. These are the corners that we couldn't figure out. Okay. Everybody got that? size of this thing. Okay. Now, all you volunteers, you can bring the envelope down. You can come down off of here. I see something fell out of your envelope. You might want to pick that up. Okay. Each envelope has a little weighty thing inside. That's a $1 coin. That's That's payment for your service. Thank you very much. Volunteers can please be seated. [applause] So, this drawing shows the uncovered tabernacle structure from the top, the corners of it and so forth and curtains. That's where the kids were just standing. The curtains or veils are shown as squiggly lines. I was going to have them squiggle, but I decided they'd probably be too embarrassed to do that, so we didn't do that. The pillars are filled with a gold color to make them easy to locate. The dimensions are in cubits and are approximate. The length of the tabernacle is 30 cubits, 45 ft as you saw here. But is that the inside of the outside dimension? I know my background is an engineer. Yeah. You'll notice that the first space is shown as 20 cubits and the second space or most holy as 10. I continually find assertions of these dimensions, the placement of the veil that separates the spaces, but it's not specified in Exodus or anywhere else in the Bible that I could find. There's extrapolations and interpretations that people toss around to to come up with that location, but we're not going to go into that. What was inside the tabernacle? Only a priest could enter the tabernacle itself. As we discussed last time, the priest wore a white linen robe tied with a multicolored sash and wore a simple white linen cap. Because the ground inside the tabernacle is considered holy, there's no floor in the tabernacle, no wood, not stone, not carpet, just the raw desert. Just as Moses was commanded to take off his sandals when he approached the bush that burned but was not consumed, so the priests are all barefoot. Even the high priest is barefoot. They would wash their feet at the lav before entering the tabernacle. Well, let's be a let's be a priest now and enter that first big space within the tabernacle, the holy place. What do we see? Well, we step inside and close the curtain behind us. Having just come in from the bright desert sunshine, we can barely see, but [snorts] we can smell. We detect an aroma. There's a special incense being heated to produce this aroma. As our eyes begin to adjust to the gloom, we then see seven flames flickering. Our eyes get better adjusted and we see the flames are coming from ornate golden lamp with six branches. The light is reflected from the golden walls providing some illumination of the space. Opposite the lamp is a table also of gold with what looks like a dozen loaves of a flat bread, not unleavened, not particularly thick. As our vision improves, we see the small altar burning that is heating the incense. It's a very pleasant aroma. The altar, like everything else in this space, is made of or covered in gold. Our eyes are now fully adjusted. Just beyond the altar, we see the four golden pillars on silver bases supporting a cleverly woven multicolored curtain with cherabs in the pattern. This is the inner veil behind which is the most holy place. We see the size of the room we just experienced here and our feet have already told us. The floor is bare. Let's now review what the Lord told Moses about these items, what they represent. We'll start with the first item we saw, the golden lamp. And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold, of beaten work shall the candlestick be made. His shaft, his branches, his bowls, his kns, his flowers shall all be the same. The six branches shall come out the sides of it. Three branches of the candlestick out of each side. And the various features are now described. We skip down to verse 37. Thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof, and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it. And the tongs thereof, and the snuff dishes thereof shall be of pure gold. Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it with all these vessels. Sorry, I didn't advance that when I should have. and look that thou make them after their pattern which was showed thee in the mount. Again, all the details are not in the text. Here we see the manora as we often refer to the candlestick with the accessories to fill and maintain it. There are many things we could say are represented by the manora. One that comes to mind is found in revelation chapter 1. Verse nine. I, John, who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the aisle that is called Patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. Patmas is a small Greek island in the Aian Sea. It's about 30 miles off the western coast of modern day Turkey. That part of Turkey is where the church at Ephesus was located, as well as other places familiar to us from our study of the book of Acts a couple of years ago. I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet. My turn to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks, manora. And in the midst of the seven candlesticks, one like unto the Son of Man. John then goes on to describe the one speaking, skipping to verse 16. He had in his right hand seven stars. The voice of the Lord tells John, skipping to verse 20, the mystery of the seven stars which thou saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. And the seven candlesticks which thou sawst are the seven churches. If you're familiar with brother Brandham's teachings about these churches, they represent the time from that of Paul until the end and that each church represented a time period or age. Brother Brandham placed us in the last of these seven ages, that of Leodysia. If the worship team would please return, we don't have time this evening to examine the table or the incense altar or go through the inner veil to the most holy and see what is there. We'll try to cover those next time. But thinking about the manora in the holy place of the wilderness tabernacle, we can imagine ourselves, our times represented by it. And what about our actions? our lives. Jesus told us. Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, this is from John 8:12. I am the light of the world. He that followeth me, Jesus followers, his disciples, that includes us, at least it it does if we're not just believing or accepting, but following. shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life. He speaks to his followers among the crowd in the sermon on the mount. I think you're familiar with the sermon on the mount using a candlestick as a metaphor. Again, think of the monora. Matthew 5:14 Jesus says, "Ye are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your father, which is in heaven. His commandments to us are still just as true and valid as they were when he spoke them. In this age of gray and uncertainty, we need to let our lights shine or let his light shine through us. As we close this portion of the service, let's stand and worship together with a song about light. It's called Send the Light. It was written in 1890 by Charles Gabriel, a pr prolific writer of gospel songs. There's a call come ringing over the [singing] restless [music] way. Send the light. Send the light. There are souls to rescue. There are [music and singing] souls to save. Send the light. Send the light. Send the [music and singing] light. The blessed goel light. Let it shine [singing] from shore to shore. [music] Send the light, [singing] the blessed goel light. Let it shine forever more. We have heard the Macedonian [singing and music] call today. Send the light. Send [music] the light and a golden offering at [music and singing] the cross we lay. Send the light. Send the light. Send the [music] light. [singing] The blessed goel light. Let it shine from [music] shore [singing] to shore. Send the light, [music] the blessed goel light. Let it shine forever [music] more. Let us pray that grace may everywhere [music and singing] abound. Send the light. Send the light. [music] And the Christlike spirit everywhere be [singing] found. Send the light. [music] Send the light. Send the light. [singing] The [music] blessed go and shine from shore to shore. [music] Send the light, the blessed goel light. Let it shine forever [music] more. Let us not grow. Weary in the word of love. Send the light. Send the light. [music] Let us gather jewels for a crown above. [singing] Send the light. [music] Send the light. Send the light. The blessed [music and singing] goel one. Let it shine from shore to shore. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Send the light, the blessed goel, [singing] let it shine [music] forever. you know, this tabernacle in the wilderness. I loved when brother Lyall had the kids lay it out there and I was looking and I was I was thinking, well, if if you took them and you moved them over here, that we could probably almost get two of the tabernacles in the wilderness in our little congregation here in our little building here. You think that with the importance [snorts] of that building, how small it was, just this little tent, but the intricate design. And that wasn't Moses's design. That was God's design as he sent through Moses. And I love the way brother Ly even even the way that he was talking about the frame and how did the brace for the frame was it underneath the the 90° angle or was it on top? It was perfect whatever it was and it was designed exactly by God the great engineer. These things were they were they were of the utmost importance and and we look at them and we think oh you know it was a tent but it was God's tent that he provided and the perfect intricate design and how how perfectly it was laid out from the fabric to the type of wood and yet it represented a tabernacle that would be built without [music] hands. and the intricate design that is in a true Christian today and how deep we are and how how many facets we have in ourselves. And it's much greater than this tabernacle. Why? Not because of the beauty of the structure, but because God dwells in it. Amen. Mayor Mooney, I'm going to call you mayor from now on. Can you can you come up and close, my friend? Can you come up and close in prayer? Do you appreciate brother Lyall and the and and the wisdom that he has and that [applause] and uh as brother Mooney is coming up. I I'm sorry I missed this. Um brother uh praise from brother Kevin Kerry. The doctor did three nerves on the right side of my back. No pain on the right side. Praise the Lord. The doctor decided to do do it as two procedures. The next procedure will be done on the 27th at 9:30 a.m. for the left side. And then brother Kevin writes, "Please keep me in prayer." So, praise the Lord that he's he's undertaken for our our brother. And he has one more to go. By the way, that mayor thing was over about 40 years ago. Lord, thanks you tonight. Thank you for Lyall. Thank you for our pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For our song leaders and our musicians that make Wednesday evening a very special time. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. and gives us an insight into what it was like more years ago than we ever want to think about. But as we reflect upon these times, Lord, let it reflect on what we are today as Christians. &gt;&gt; We offer these things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
