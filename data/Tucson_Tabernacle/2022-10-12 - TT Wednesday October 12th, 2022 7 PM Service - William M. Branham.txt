will praise the Lord no matter what tomorrow amen I will praise him no matter what the situation sometimes we might say Lord why am I in this but I'm going to give you praise anyway so so let's let's open with a praise and a prayer request and give him praise because he's in control of everything if you have the WhatsApp we put in a request for sister Elizabeth Murray brother Robert Figueroa had had text me yesterday afternoon saying sister Elizabeth had gone into early labor her water bag had broke and she was having contractions and they took her to the hospital and it didn't look good so we asked the church to pray and he asked if we would pass it out we did and then yesterday that was uh yeah the day before yesterday and yesterday I didn't get any answers from him so I called brother Jude directly and he said all is well so brother Robert then sent me this text and I'm going to read this to you it's a Tuesday night update on Elizabeth she's doing great we had a complete turnaround late this morning praise God the contraction stopped this afternoon she was tested again this morning for amniotic fluid leaks and three tests came back negative even though the tests of previous days both confirmed that it was leaking miraculously the cervix isn't dilated even though she had contractions for nearly 24 hours every three to eight minutes the ultrasound today showed the baby as well the fluid is full as it should be concerning how wet she was yesterday and tested positive for break that's great news so this morning we were told she would stay four weeks minimum in the hospital if they could continue to hold the baby off this afternoon it changed to you can probably go home tomorrow nurses were doing the transfer of care and one nurse said to the other nurse we just don't understand it it's like a miracle so we're very so we're very happy baby gets to stay in the womb a little longer staying in the hospital tonight just for observation and we'll be heading home tomorrow morning thank you for praying for us we feel so blessed and thankful that our situation turned around so quickly and really believe that everyone's prayers helped change things no matter what the situation [Applause] sometimes sometimes it looks dark and then brother Lyle gave me this prayer request just as he came in Sister Barbara Yarborough request prayer for her granddaughter Megan and her husband Ben Gan delivered their baby this morning by cesarea's section the infant has serious birth defects and was taken by air ambulance to Phoenix Children Hospital the baby has problems breathing as and is on a ventilator in serious condition Ben and Megan are both trusting the Lord for their child in its healing and also to remember her grandson Hudson so I just read what God has done already and he's the same yesterday today and forever I wrote down Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever before I knew that we were going to get this request and I told sister Lily we're going to sing what a mighty God we serve with his testimony but we're still going to sing that same testimony for this baby here and how many can believe that say Lord I believe and

than enough more than enough more maybe one more time to convince yourself he's more than enough because he knows he is oh you are more than [Music] enough [Music] for me [Music] amen more than enough he says dig some more or fill the valley full of ditches and prepare for my blessing that's he's a mighty God he's worth I mean to to him you're worth everything that he's done I was thinking about that thief on the cross the other day just God's mercy the timing's so perfect for God to hang on the cross he couldn't do it the day before or day day after because that Thief was going to be on the cross at that time so it was all perfectly laid out in the mind because there was going to be one who at the last moment was going to say remember me when you come into your kingdom and he turns and say this day you'll be with me in Paradise everything is on perfect time with God I just appreciate that sometimes I look at it I say oh what's going on in wine how's this going to get resolved and God just says it's in my hands it's in my care so tonight we're going to listen to the message in his presence there's two sides to that being in his presence that he bids us come enter into his presence but he knows we can't come on our own so he made a way for us to enter into his presence as the congregation of Israel would stand on the outside looking towards the temple there and a high priest would go in and they would look for that smoke to know that the sacrifice had been accepted and their sins would be rolled over for another year they could live at peace again but he said for once and for all the veil was rent to and therefore we can come in but we must approach him in the right manner when you get in his presence you realize how little you are and that's perfectly fine because that's how one you want to come to him say Lord I just surrender all and let him fail so if he'll stand with me in his presence and brother Matt made quite a few references to uh the countdown and that was the message he had preached that morning and then he preached in his presence that evening but we can come into His presence in fact it behooves you to get into its presence and then not I'd rather come like I am and get into his presence and let him change me then saying I'm not good enough to get in there and nothing can happen so come on in and just and and receive of him let him correct you let him clean you let him change you and then the joy of the Lord is your strength amen amen that song that that please the angel of the Lord only believe only believe all things are possible [Music] things are possible [Music] all things are possible only now our confession is Lord I believe [Music] oh Lord I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Reach Out And Touch the Hem of His Garment for whatever you have need as he ministers to you today God bless you may be seated and now tonight God willing we're speaking on the subject of any in his presence oh how we thank God for the privilege that we can come into His presence but first I wish you all to turn in your Bibles with me to the prophet Isaiah the sixth chapter of the prophet Isaiah we all know that Isaiah was a major prophet and one of the great prophets of his day he ended his life for being solid asunder with Sauls for our testimony as a martyr to the power of almighty God in the book of Isaiah the sixth chapter I begin at the fifth verse 3. then said ah woe is me or maybe I start with the first verse let's pardon me a moment let's start at the first verse and read down until about the eighth verse in the year the king azekiah died I saw also the Lord setting upon a throne high and lifted up in his train filled the temple above it stood the serpents each one having six wings between he covered his face and between he covered his feet and between he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts and the whole earth is full of his glory I am the host of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said on woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lives and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lit for in our eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of this therapists unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the thongs from off the altar and he laid it up on my mouth and said Lord this has touched thy lips and then iniquity is taken away and now sin is purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying who shall I send and who will go for us then said I here I am send me may the Lord bless his word I think that's the most striking a scripture we find that in the presence of God man recognized themselves to be sinners we may feel pretty good when we're out in different places and feel like that we're pretty good people but when we ever come into the presence of God then we see how little we are standing up long ago with a A friend of mine and I had the privilege of leading to Christ Bert call up in New Hampshire a hunting partner we are standing by Colebrook Falls up in the Adirondack and it was such a mammoth big Falls I've taken my family last year up there to look at it way back off the road you have to hike back to get to it and when we seen that blue green water pouring with such a mighty power out of the mountains and gushing down over the Rocks Burton stood down to me and he said Gee Billy it makes a man feel just so little he measured about a quarter of an inch on his fingers I said that's right Bert now that was all he knowed of getting into the presence of God to see his creation a one of the man who wrote How Great Thou Art if he didn't look up one night look at the stars how far they are away a few months ago brother Fred brother woods and I was standing with brother mcinally out in the Arizona desert we was measuring giant one star how close it was to the other and with the millions and billions of miles away they didn't look over a quarter of an inch from each other then we begin to think according to scientific proof of that those stars are probably farther away from each other than we are from now see how it is then we realize how little we are when we realize how great he is and how close we come in coming to his presence somehow another is always stroke a great effect upon people they're coming to the presence of God I've seen the time in my Ministry when you see the presence of God coming into such a place that it would bring a person up and just reveal the life to them and call out their sins of all kinds of immoral acts and it brings such a holy hush amongst the people until they drop out of the prayer line before they ever come up to be prayed for and run to the altar get right with God before they come up into his presence there's something about coming into the presence of God it causes things to happen I've seen people laying eggs cops and stretchers that night down there at Mexico we're not a little dead baby laying under a blanket that's a little Spanish mother brought up her little Mexican mother rather brought up when they sing several thousands of those people saw maybe 50 or 75 000 at one Gathering saw that little dead baby come to life women faded people threw up their hands and screamed why they realized that a human being could not do that they were in the presence of almighty God and it caused something to happen I've been privileged to hear a godly man speak it was said one time of Charles spinning little bitty fella never weighed over about 110 pounds but he had such a forceful way of speaking until he was trying the Acoustics one day in a building they didn't have PA systems then and there was the man repairing up in the balcony or up in the roof of the place and he heard the man come in so he didn't know who they were he just kept quiet Mr Feeney was going to try the Acoustics after spending much time in prayer for that Revival that he's going to hold he tried his voice to see how it would carry he slipped up quickly to the pulpit and said repent or perish and he said it was such fourth Force after being or that only God told a man dropped out of the top of the balcony down onto the floor out of the top of the building onto the floor he preached the gospel in such way till he stood in Boston Massachusetts and a little bay window because his no church could hold his cloud and he stood there with such Mighty force and preached held such a place onto a working man with their baskets under their arms fell into the street and screamed for mercy the presence of God [Applause] great preachers who's been able by the word of God to bring the presence of God to an audience all this that man would ever be so seared in their hearts so they could never recognize the presence of God when the first man as soon as he had sinned and done something wrong and when God came into his presence or he came into the presence of God Adam he could not stand in the presence of God he run and hid himself in the bush and tried to cover himself with a figly because he knowed he was standing In The Presence of Jehovah the Creator that was the reaction of the first man actually he had sinned and tried to come into the presence of God with sent upon his soul he could not hide because he was tender yet sin and I took a hole like it has rooted into people's hearts today but he was very conscious that he was standing before his creator now he hid himself in the bushes and would not come out and could not come out until God had made a preparation for him we could go back and take in Genesis the 17th chapter and the third verse when the Great patriarch Abraham when he came into the presence of God and God spoke to him in the 17th chapter in the name of almighty God Abraham fell on his face the great patriarch servant of God could not stand in the presence of God though I had served him for 25 years Faithfully but when God moved into his presence the patriarch fell on his face because he couldn't stand in the presence of God in Exodus 3 we find that Moses the great servant and prophet of God when he was back on the back side of the desert that man was a holy man he had been born for the purpose he was born from his mother's wombs to be a prophet he had tried to get his education and do everything he could to deliver his people because he understood that he was to deliver his people but when he understood it by a theological standpoint he was trained he was well scholared he could teach the Egyptians wisdom which was the most smartest people in the world he known all the ins and outs he knows the scripture from A to Z he known the promises that God had made him he noted from an intellectual standpoint and he was a a great military man but one day on the back side of the desert when he'd come into the presence of God he jerked off his shoes and fell into his feet no leave it he was on Holy Ground amen he could not stand upon his feet when he come in the presence of God he fell to his face like Abraham did he could not stand in the presence of God in Exodus 19 19 when the chosen people of God sent the way back in the days of Abraham from Abraham come Isaac Isaac come Jacob God Jacob come the Patriarchs and years after years it developed holy man great man a chosen people a chosen race a Sanctified holy people and served God their life and one day God said Gather Israel out here I'm going to speak to them but when God came down on top of Mount Sinai amen and the whole Mountain caught a fire and the smoke was dying from the lack of furnace and the voice of God rore out Israel fell on their faces said let Moses speak and not God lest we die man you're the presence of God realizes he's a sinner yet they were everyone circumcised according to the law they had carried the Commandments and everything but when God spoke and they moved up into his presence they realized that they were out they were they were not right there was something that was likened because they were in the presence of God yes and they said let Moses speak and not God for God speaks will all die let Moses speak to us it was in Luke 5 8 that when Peter oh when he is a great stubborn man and a man of great influence great power that we understand he was like a bullying adulted fisherman but when he saw the miracle of God performed by an ordinary Man look like which he recognized at that time that that taken more than a man to throw all that fish in a net where he was all of his education his knowledge efficient had fished all night not even taken a thing but he heard someone say cast your net in and when he began to fall he had a great multitude of fishes and he realized that he was a sinful man and he said depart from the O Lord for I am a sinful man who said that Saint Peter and the presence of God ask for God to depart out of his presence because he recognized himself a sinner Abraham recognized himself wrong Adam recognized himself wrong which was the son of God recognize himself wrong Moses recognized himself from Israel as a church and Nation recognize themselves wrong depart from me for I am a sinful man he didn't try to say now I'm holy and worthy to receive this he said I am a sinful man one kind of self-style religionist with all the theology they can learn under a great teacher called romelia his name is Saul of Tarsus which we know as Paul religious to the dog you know all the ins and out of their religion he was a Pharisee of the Pharisee in a Hebrew of the Hebrews he was a noted man a scholar smart shrewd educated painted old God from vadia one day on his road down to Damascus that glorifier shine over him and he felonies off of his feet to the ground in the dust and said Lord what would you have me to do all of his great training all these great theological training of his education didn't mean a thing when he stood in the presence of God I like to stop him and he didn't say that's the same thing you might have died PhD whatever you might be you might have went to church since she was a child you might have done all the religious acts there is but once in the presence of God you feel so literally no count boy oh realized that he was wrong and he fell to the ground under the influence and power when he looked up and seen the buried God that he had been preaching and against Authority note and seen that he was wrong he fell from his feet to the ground because he was in the presence of God he's seen that Pillar of Fire what about the great Saint John of Revelations 1 7. when he was showed the vision I looked I heard a voice speaking to him and he turned to look to see the voice and he saw seven golden candlesticks and one stood in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks with hair like wool eyes like flames of fire feet like pillars of rest he was girded with the golden girdle around the past and he was called the word of God and when the Great Saint John oh had walked with Christ when you've done all these things as I said this morning Paul's Ministry exceeded alien here after John had walked with Jesus talked with him slept with him eat with him but when he's seen him standing there that glorified State he said he fell like a Deadman [Applause] think of it we could come to church and talk and praise God and so forth but oh brother when we see him coming something will be different in our hearts we might think we do our religious duty but go to church and pay our tithing we might think if we keep the laws of the churches recite all the Creeds but once let us get a look at him the whole things changed all the way around yes sure this great man Saint John a great man like that the Bible said in Revelations 1 7 that he fell as if he was a dead man after three and a half years of fellowship with Christ was one of the writers of the Epistles rolled behind him eat with him at the table slept with him at the bed and fellowship with him for everyone but when he's turned to see him he had no more life left in him he fell like a dead man to the floor or to the ground all right we see Isaiah in Isaiah 6 and 5 as we've just read this Great Mighty prophet is one of the greatest prophets there is in the Bible there are 66 books of the Bible there's 66 chapters in Isaiah Isaiah starts off in Genesis the middle of Isaiah he brings to the New Testament at the end of Isaiah he brings in the millennium just exactly Genesis the New Testament and Revelations perfect Isaiah was one of the Major Prophets but one day he had been leaning upon the arm of Hezekiah the great king Hezekiah been taken from him and he was down he was a pretty good fellow he's a good righteous man if that righteous King a good King recognized him as a holy man and kept him in his Temple Isaiah saw Visions he was a prophet Isaiah preached the word he was a minister Isaiah was a holy man but one day he fell into a trance and he saw the glory of God he saw the angels with wings over their face Wings over their feet flying with wings crying holy holy holy is the Lord God on my head that Prophet realized he was nothing he said woe is me for I am a man of unclean lips a prophet a mightiest prophet of the Bible one of them I am a man with unclean lips and I dwell among people it's unclean lips will always be because I see the glory of God and he said when that angel cried the post of the temple Shook Back and Forth not only as opposed to the temple go to shake but the whole heavens and Earths go to shape the mountains of flea and a seal fade away and extreme highness from the face of him that sets upon the throne it's going to be a terrible time I'll tell you Senator friend you better be checking it up that's right now Isaiah said we'll always be I'm a man of unclean lips and I'll dwell among unclean people and I'm these people as unclean Lids now remember if such holy man recognize themselves sinners in the presence of God what will the Sinner and ungodly do it that day what will people do who set in the meetings what will the people do that seem the power of God that's heard the count down on the word that seen God manifest himself and Beyond a shadowed doubt every scripture fulfilled and will still try to make it to heaven without being born again and receive the Holy Ghost the Bible said if a righteous man be scarcely saved where will the Sinner and ungodly appear amen what kind of a place are we going to stand in if we see God unfold himself right before us and see the glory of God just the same as that man did and that kind of man cried up prophets and Sages upon whom the word is based upon if they cried and fell to their feet and screamed on man of Unholy lips uncleanness what will it be then for that man who won't even confess his sins what will it be for that teenager that won't confess his or her sins why would it be for that hard-hearted man of face he knows more about uh God's creation God does himself why do I have for that man spent all of his life trying to disprove the Bible where will that God appear at think of it Lord this is evangelism this is a time to shape people this is the time that God said there come a time he shut Mount Sinai one time but they're coming shaken again that he will only seek Mount Sania but he'd Shake everything that could be moved but did you notice the rest of scripture but we receive a kingdom that cannot believe me Hallelujah everything that can be shuck will be shaken the heavens are safe the Earth will shake heavens and earth will pass away but that word shall never pass away for all this rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will ever pray [Applause] everything that can be shut will be shaken Kingdom which is a word of God himself and God is his word he don't shake himself hey man oh my but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved it's unshakable said Paul the Hebrew writer such a person and such a man such a time and how they felt we have also ourselves we've seen the glory of God like this man did sir we've seen him we've seen the glory of God like Abraham saw it we saw the glory of God like Moses saw him the same pillar of power the same power of God the same Christ on revealing himself showing himself keeping his word in the last day how can we come by then and walk and treat it so lightly how can we walk around and hold our Creeds and denominations and not take the word of God Amen amen what will it be for us in that day how will it happen with us when we see the glory of God some people will stand off and they make fun of it some are laughing some will call it fanaticism some call it mental telepathy some call it Beelzebub some call it one thing or another as the old Proverbs is fools the walk with hobnail shoes Where Angels pray to God Ryan the fool is set in his heart there is no God when he sees God manifested so perfectly by this own word not by a Creed but by his word and that walked right over it and make fun of it he's a fool says God is the word God's made himself plain to him fool the Bible say what would it be for him when he has to stand in that place it'll be a it'll be terrible for that man in that day the ungodly repented Sinners old doesn't have any fear oh no a sinner that will repent he knows that there's a bloody sacrifice waiting is that it is that's what gives me the consolation right I've seen the glory of God I felt his power I know the touch of his hand I know the touch of his chastisement I know that he's God and I know I'm undone but there's one standing at a farming amen I also understands where it says father lay all of his iniquity upon me because he stood for me down on the earth Hallelujah then I'll walk to the throne of God boldly Heaven Grace in my heart the Lord is not by good verse but by his mercy on your faith not what I can do what I could join what I could say but it's by his grace that he said go under the poet the cult that screen on Amazing Grace how sweet let's save the rest like me once was lost but now I'm found blind but now I see how can I ever go to heaven how could you go to heaven we cannot do it we need no way for us to do it but there's one made the way and he is the way and how do we get to him by one Spirit his Spirit we're baptized into one body which will be raised up like an organs will go out of the earth and astronauts of his last name amen sure repentance Sinners don't have to worry someone is there in their place oh then after we have come into His presence now and we are known we've been in his presence we've seen do things that he did when he was here on Earth how do you know the how do you know the vine you're looking at because of fruit it Bears how do you know the church you're going to by the fruit of man amen Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do all things the SE signs shall follow them that believe huh we see he never did our dentist to go make denominations he never did our Danish to go make Creed but he warned us against such for whosoever shall take anything from it or add anything to it the same will be taken out of their part in The Book of Life so we're not our team to do them but stay with that word and if a man is stand of God he'll stay with the word because God can only send by his words must stay by his word then when we come into His presence when a man once comes into the presence of God he's changed forever if there's any change in doing now are there are those who can walk in the presence of God and pay no attention to it he was an ordained alive but if he was predestinated of God as soon as that first move hits he knows it that catches fire look at that little prostitute down there that day uh Samaria that woman she's in a bad shape mentally and physically we know that but as soon as she's seen that sign down the Messiah she said we know messiah's coming to do this thou must be his prophet he said I'm that Messiah that was wrote to come you recognize that she never asked one more question she started right quick with the responsibility to know that if she had found that and come into the presence of God she was responsible to tell somebody else about it Hallelujah right any man that comes into the presence of God is responsible before God from that men at all you tell somebody else look at Abraham look at Moses look at Peter look at Paul the moment they come into the presence of God recognize themselves Sinners and seal their testimony with their life look at the little lady she couldn't stay no longer she went to the city and told the man come see the man who told me the things I've done is in this Messiah they could not deny because it was scriptural certainly this they've got to do it a man when we got a responsibility of telling others that as Moses did as Peter did as Paul did after these things you've seen it and come into His presence you're responsible for the message to get to somebody else yes you just cannot sit still with it you must take it to someone else I never know a sister used to be your brother grandson's mother you sit right here in the church and she would sing I've just got over I'm running running running I just got over and I can't sit down she had just found some I want you a little colored church over here and Lowell and uh all of us stand up singing I'm running up the King's Highway just found it and took up the highway there's something about it when you find Christ you cannot hold your peace any longer the rest of your days you are a changed person for when life and life comes together it may survive life true when the bulb connects with the wars if it's a correct bulb it's got to give life when the current and the above gets together there's nothing to do but scatter line it has to do it I'm on a man or a woman is predestinated to eternal life and they see the current of God catch that bomb it'll throw light everywhere it might not be over a 10 watt but she'll scatter what lies you got a 500 watt scatter 10 watt light yeah give your life let your life so shine before man that they might see your good works and glorify the Father which is in heaven yes sir when a man comes in contact with God he recognizes himself no good how can a man walk around brag about how big he is what all he's done when he's nothing it's nothing to begin with one day down in Memphis Tennessee or one I don't think Memphis is one of the places there I was with Brother Davis is having a Revival that might have been in Memphis and we was went to a Coliseum and had a in there another Coliseum is kind of a art gallery and they had the great statues that they'd got from different parts of the earth of different Hercules and so forth and great artists of painted and then they had the analysis of a man that weighed 150 pounds you know how much he's worth 84 cents that's all he is 84 cents is all it all the chemicals you can get out of him he's just got enough White Horse to sprinkle A Hen's Nest and he's got to have fun just a little bit of calcium a little potash it would all sell for 84 cents but we just take care of that 84 cents and baby it around there's two boys stand there and one looked the other and said Jim we're not worth very much Army he said no we're not John I said but wait a minute boys you got a soul in there it's worth Ten Thousand Words that's been cannot be Redeemed by the power of God if you just let it man when he sees these things he's responsible to tell others I saw it when I was just a boy I've spent the whole life at it only story I got one life we said ten thousand if I had an eternity I still want to tell people about it because it's the greatest thing I ever found if you were eating Ezekiel 33 33rd chapter of Ezekiel there was a Watchman set on a tower and this wasman was responsible for the entire city amen I'll wait wake yourselves to your spiritual conscience a minute well I get to this scripture that Watchman had to be a trained man he had to know what he was doing for At Any distance as soon as it arose the enemy he could detect it he could tell their March he could tell their color he could tell her Rank and file just as far as the human eyes could see he could see it and he was higher than the rest of them for he was trained to know the enemy and God required the whole city of his hands Watchman for the night Hallelujah that's the way God's soldiers are today they're trained to the word when anything comes up scholar Lord polished to it and got something else that's not scripture they warn their congregation amen amen anything is not viable anything it's not it's not Godlike such as having soup suppers dances and everything else to pay off the pastors those things are wrong phone call games and card parties in their churches that's wrong and the real Watchman on the wall who's once been in the presence of God ever if he isn't on the wall if he just follows to be on the wall the wall may not be any higher than the rest of the congregation but if he's a correct Watchman God raises he put up in the stairs that the rest of them never gets to but he watches the fly and God requires it of him man of God who stands in the presence of God and knows God is God and know that God keeps his word and watch God perform himself and do his duty and keep his word that no matter how many organizations he knows a rank and power of the enemy amen he knows what to tell the congregation a real Watchman ah if we have confessed and he is that we've been in this presence and we have confessed our sins they're blotted out the book of his memory now there's nobody but God could do that now you can do anything to me I'll forgive you but I'll remember if I do anything to you you forgive me but you'll remember but God can forgive and forget it amen amen think of that man don't even remember amen that makes me feel good when it started anymore nothing but God can do that he said he would blotted out of his book of memory I can't do it you can't do it because we've only got these little finite senses but he's infinite God he can absolutely forget that it ever was done Hallelujah [Music] praise God a young lady come from a country Church and her father was an old-fashioned shouting preacher or a member of the church and so she moved into the City and she got all mixed up with the women down there got to acting like they did in the Fashions and one day she was kind of Shame for her papa mama to come or a father or other her mother was dead so the old man only thing you do get up for the morning it is breakfast get the Bible and read it and cry and pray and shout all day long around and Down the Roof and she was a little embarrassed about it so then then when it all came through the night if he got all the Bible started reading he'd raised up out of benheart Glory to God hallelujah oh glory to God this stomping cry half the night so one day she's going to entertain her church members to a little tea party like they always have you know so she didn't know what she's gonna do with her dad after all it was her daddy so she decided she put him up in an attic and say daddy you don't want to be around where these women are do you oh I don't even want to do that he said well we're going to have the church women up here today and we're going to have a little meeting a little prayer meeting so I I tell you Dad why don't you just go up in the attic said I'll just breathe out do that so she said read this nice book and she gave him a geography took his Bible away from him so he keep quiet so nobody read the Bible one he would go to make a lot of noise up there so he got up over him you know where he's having their party so she'd give him the jog if he said this is nice you should read it Daddy because it tells you all the truth about the worm or said I'll be glad to read that so he said now you go up there and keep real quiet to these women leaving now you come back down and then you do whatever you want to he agreed to do it so he goes upstairs sets up there and there's all have their tea party no talking about so and so on and you know how it goes having all that big time about that time something Cut Loose upstairs all the screaming and jumping in a plaster falling the old man running up and down to the attic just as hard as he could go jumping up and down in our glory to God glory the god that women didn't know what happened after what they had upstairs so directly down the steps he come hard as he could go she said Daddy I'll give you a geography to read said yes I know it you know I said I was reading in this geography here where these places in the sea that ain't got no body man and said all right over here in the Bible yesterday he said he put my sins in the sea of forgiveness glory is a God [Applause] foreign well that's right God puts our sins in the sea of forgiveness amen blocks them out and they're as if they never did happen oh then we stand by the grace of God through Jesus Christ Our Lord pure and holy just as holy as he was amen because he doesn't see me when I come up there he sees his own son the only way he can see can't see me because I'm any son isn't that wonderful don't have to think about sins anymore it's all gone it's under the blood yes sir don't have to worry about anymore it's all out of the and out of God's memory you don't even remember it no more Isaiah that Mighty Prophet when he confessed his sins he said woe is me for I'm a man of uncle lives a prophet I'm a man of unclean lips and my congregation is unclean the people I've preached to they're unclean I'm unclean and warrants me but here comes a bunch of angels down from the glory of God Banning back to the clouds and I'll look up there and see strain fill in the whole heaven and I'll watch these angels that's never known what sin was they never even know what sin was and they're in the presence of God they've got two Wings over their faces they got two Wings over their feet and they're fine with two wings and they cry day and night holy holy holy is the Lord God that make you feel kind of Unholy wasn't it now what did he do he said woe is me I am when he confessed his sins and said will always be the angel went over and tucked the tongs picked up a pole of fire which represents the Holy Ghost and Fire and come over and laid it on the prophet's lips instead of cleanse you Hallelujah then the wings of winning their way like that moved away the curtains of time and he heard God say who will go forth but after he found out that there was a way to rid sin God wanted somebody to go for him and he said here am I send me he had been in the presence of God and had confessed his sins and then cleansed from his sins and was ready for service amen as the poet caught that said million million now in sin and shame are dying listen to their sad and bitter cry hasten brother hasten to the rescue quickly answer Master here am I and I think of Africa India and around the world millions of heathens screaming and crying for mercy and who will go not pass them attract but bring him Jesus Christ somebody in his presence thank Moses who could go down there and show them True Deliverance not make them join a church or Shake hand and have a cream but brain delivers to their soul some good godly man yes Isaiah confessed his sins and was cleansed after Jacob had wrestled all night in confessing his sins you know the place you are it's called Panther p-e-n-i-t-l Dental the word pencil in the Hebrew means the face of almighty God Jacob the little shyster had run all his name of Jacob which means supplanter that's deceiver had run all of his life away from God but when he got one time in the presence of God at pimple in the face of God he got a hold of God and wouldn't turn him loose God we need for Jacobson he held on to the face of God in the presence of God he stayed until it was sent up God said let me go because the sun's arising and he stayed in the face of God until son up but he went away Justified and saved oh what a great thing it was now to know that he had wrestled through that's he had seen signs of God he'd had dreams about God but this is one time he was in the face of God in the presence of God think of it friends now as we hurry up in the presence of God a man's changed Jacob was changed now he could walk with God yes he was a different man than what he was when he went up there the battle was now over yes sir and he began to build an altar he hadn't been used to building orders you know but I'll tell you when you come in the presence of God you want to build an altar somewhere you want to find somewhere where you can pray he built an altar he was cleansed and God had one and Jacob was changed from Jacob's supplanter to Israel of Prince having power with God that's what happened to Jacob it's a planter The Deceiver the unrighteous the Unholy the deceiver deceived his brother stole the birthright says it was from his brother took a little dirty way of doing it such a deceiver he deceived his father-in-law but popper sticks made speckled cabs when the cow has been pregnant he'd come down look at the Sheep but she has speckled stick make speckled cattle give him birthmarks deceiver deceiving his own father-in-law deceived his mother deceived his daddy deceived his brother but when he once got in the he was a shyster he was running everywhere he went always on the run from God he's on the run from his brother but when he come into the presence of God he recognized he was a sinner what did he do what did he do he seen his opportunity he hadn't met something that he didn't even think about before and he stayed there until all sins was gone oh my God got him in his own presence God manages a way to get man in their presence and to make their decision some of them run from him some run to him if they're predestinated to life they believe it they hang on to it if they're not they try to get away and says nothing to it see and that's the guy that's lost the guy that confesses his sin shall have pardon if you hide your sin you'll not Prosper no so Jacob when he it was the next day he met Esau his brother he didn't need no help from him he didn't need his armies he is this is building orders he wasn't afraid of Esau no more Psalms 16 8. David said I have set the Lord before me that's a good thing to do Psalm 16 8 I set the Lord before me so he could not be confused about it uh he wanted to be conscious of his presence so David said I have set the lord always before my face now ah David have set the Lord before my face always to be conscious conscious of God's presence wouldn't that be a good lesson for all of us tonight sent the Lord before a face so we'll be conscious of his presence put in first why but he first before you why then you won't sin when you are realizing that constantly you're in the presence of God when you realize God's around you watch what you say a man when he thinks God's gone he'll cuss he'll lust after women he'll do you steal cheat lie he'll do anything when he thinks that God don't see him but bring him into the presence of God to stop it right now and David said I have put the lord always before me that's a good thing the water of God said his man after his own heart man will do everything when he thinks that God is near but when he realizes that God's here do you ever know it's a sinner let a Godly person walk up you'll quit he's cursing yeah he's got any respects at all you won't tell the dirty jokes that he would have told see you leave off that because he knows that he's in the presence of God because God dwells in the Tabernacle of his people see after David did this he said my heart shall rejoice we should read Psalm 16. my heart will rejoice and my flesh shall rest and Hope why my heart shall rejoice because of God God before me all the time and my flesh shall Rest In Hope if I die I'll be raised up again or he'll not suffer his holy one and see corruption neither will it even Stone see when David put God before him and was conscious that constantly he was in the presence of God seek ye first the kingdom of God now listen church I love you I want you to listen to me now if brother McCullough you say I'm going to say something always put the Lord before you and don't you do nothing that you wouldn't do in his presence because he's watching over you see the Lord is encamped about those who fear Him you know he just stays right near you and he knows everything you're doing and you must recognize that when you start to tell her I don't do it remember God's listening at you if you start to do a little cheat don't you do it God's looking at you if you start to take his name in vain don't do it God's listening at you start smoking cigarette he's watching you is we used to sing a song All Along on the road to the souls to Abode there's an eye watching you every step that you take this great eye is awake there's an eye watching you remember do like David put the lord always before your face then your heart will rejoice and your flesh shall Rest In Hope for he promised it yesterday he knew that he had raised up because God had promised it all right when we come into His presence we're a change never to be the same look all down to the ages of every Walk of Life but man look at Abraham you say well the changed life is just for ministers oh no the change lies for everybody now Abraham was a farmer but when he heard God's voice speaking to him and saw that Vision he was a changed man from that time on he separated himself from his Kindred from all his associates and walked as a pilgrim in a Stranger in a Strange Land the rest of his life dwelling intense because he clearly confessed that he was seeking the city he was Builder and maker was gone he know there was a God and there was a city somewhere whose Builder and maker was gone Bruce 11 tells us that he's seeking a city as Builder and maker was God he was a changed man yet he was nothing but a mere farmer but he saw a vision and come into the presence of God and he was a changed man from then on Moses he was a shepherd but he was a changed man when he come into the presence of God he was a coward he was running from Pharaoh with the whole Army behind him but with a stick in his hand he went back and took the whole nation why he come into the presence of God he was a changed man a Shepherd Peter a fisherman know nothing about fishing or know nothing about God only thing he probably know was how to catch fish but when he'd come in the presence of God and see the great Creator who could create fish when he told him let down the net for the draw there wasn't any fish there he just pulled his Nets up but he said ask Thy word Lord I believe that you're the Son of God and if you let a violate on that you told me to do it as your word because you and your word are the same I'll let down the net and when you begin to pull he said he said depart Lord I'm a sinful man a fisherman after Peter met Christ he was never the same anymore the answer words was so true to God he was giving the keys to the kingdom yes sir Paul a self-style Pharisee educated and trained in all the religion of the that there was in the world in that day one of the highest known scholars in the land but when he come before that Pillar of Fire one day the God that he had persecuted eagerly he was the Pharisee he didn't believe that God was a man he know God was a pillar of fire he led his people out of Egypt and with them all along but when he saw this Pillar of Fire he fell on his face and he heard a voice saying so I persecuted Sal means that who are you Lord he said I'm Jesus I said how have you been baptized he had been the presence of God he was a changed man for now you've been the presence of God it changes a man Charles G Finney a lawyer a great uh Philadelphia lawyer but when he come into the presence of God he dropped his law of study and become a mightiest preacher of this nation's ever had yet he was a preacher because one day he'd come in the presence of God he thought what's the instead of Industry you know his book I got his autobiography he went out to pray he thought he was a preacher he had a desire that he wanted to preach and he had him a few sermons to try to preach he went out one day out of his office to pray went out of the woods he got down behind an old blowing down tree where he'd go every afternoon very religious but he didn't believe in that there's two women in the church kept saying Mr Finney we're praying that you received the Holy Ghost he said I got the Holy Ghost but I'm a preacher the Mississippi you're a great man and you got a great hold of the word but you need the Holy Ghost we're praying for you sweet little women so he went on oh so every day he'd go out behind his office his boss and all that married work and he'd go out of his law office to go out there to pray and one day he was out there pre and he heard a breast breed he thought his boss was coming up haunting him he jumped up real quick and said Lord God I believe you inside brush spoke raised up looked around see where it was broke the brush then he come in the presence of God he realized that breast should broke for a purpose you stood there the tears running on his sheets he said maybe that women's right I'm ashamed for somebody to see me talking to my God but I think it was an honor for somebody to see me talking to my boss how much greater is my Lord than my boss I said Lord forgive him fill me with the Holy Ghost started screaming and shouting is in the presence of God you run downtown real quick to his office he got screaming so hard he had to go behind the door said Lord I'll bring disgrace that fall to you hide me back here until get over this spell fun he'd come in the presence of God he was a changed man the sermons that he used to preach he preached them same sermons and souls came to the altar yeah but see he had been the presence of God Moody a little old shoe cover hardly noticed ABCs trying his grammar was poor somebody told him one day your grammar's off a poor Mr Moody he said but I'm winning Souls with it so one day the newspapers the editor went to as writing a newspaper he went over to

people who were out he shot the people with the gospel of preparation [Music] wow he was in the presence of God right a little woman one time come in the presence of God as guilty as she could be and a moment when she realized that she was in the presence of God every sin was forgiven and she was as pure and white as the Lily oh my how many more I could call off your of people time wouldn't permit

around to talk to me somebody else come up to leave me and I'd stand there and crying no this is so it can't be so this is wrong but one day I come into the presence of God Changed Me Maybe another kind of sound his grace brought me into his presence I've never wanted to leave it I've been here now 30 some odd years I don't want to leave it I've got this shirt so I'll always be there even death itself will never separate me from his presence no I'll be with him forever when I see his presence the first time I cried like Isaiah Wars me then he touched me with his grace on a changed person the little Renegade I carry on and everything was changed and since then I've been his child since then I've had enough for his service only wish I had ten thousand more lives to give for him this is getting pretty well wore out now 53 years has passed about 33 of those 32 of those has been in the gospel I wish I had another thousand a Pakistan why while once then to his presence and realized that there was somebody who loved the unlovable there's somebody loving when no one else did there was somebody who cared for me when no one else cared I put my arms around his cross I embraced it to me and meet him become one man and from then on I've loved him he stained my bosom in my heart with his blood by touching me and forgiving my sins and I'm happy tonight to be one of his I never desire to

parents had come down from the Anderson Church of God Campground and they'll overseer over there knowing the child the doctor said got to die right away with leukemia the little sweet little girl in her last stages now she come back here and held her little hand out to me it all swelled up with needles and things been in it blue I looked upon her I saw her Nation the parents had just been reading the book out there they know nothing about it the gentle overseer at the camp up there told him said bring the child down here they wanted to come back when we had a healing service and I said bring the child down felt led want to stand right there the Holy Spirit went right back and brought out the history of the child told all about why it happened what they'd done told the little girl's ambition was to be a piano player and that mother just almost screamed out and that Daddy said that's like God's truth sitting right there in a car now listening to it couldn't get in sitting out there listening to it now there come a big veil of a shadow hanging over the child and I said Satan you are defeated you're no respect to person God bow the power of your resurrection and as your servant I drive this devil from the child a Big Bright Light flashed over the top of her it was over amen sure he's worthy of all praise he knows all things he knows your heart and you know what you're thinking he does too if there's a little sin hanging on you tonight you wouldn't want to go in the presence of God but that on you would you once more raise up your hand and say brother Brandon pray for me I want to be in his presence at that day Guiltless God bless him many hands God sees it in his presence now I'll tell you what you do I just listen closely do like David in put the Lord before you right now put the Lord between you and that sin whatever that little besetting sin is it might be lying might be stealing it might be evil thinking it might be temper it might be drinking might be smoking might be Gammon I don't know what it might be lust it might be anything I don't know what it is whatever it is put the Lord before you then your heart will rejoice and your flesh shall Rest In Hope for you know that Christ promised he'd raise up again in the last days when he comes forth we'll come in his likeness once you do it now while we pray our heavenly father a little chopped up message by a tired weary servant but just thinking on the subject of dwelling in the presence of God and we see tonight the effect that is taken upon holy man to come into your presence what effect it had upon Him Sages great powerful Prophets ordained by God and said to preach the word and yet meeting face to face and fall to the ground like a dead man what are we going to do it that day Lord we thought it over we've been thinking it some 40 or 50 hands has been thinking it Lord for they just raised them hands or Hearts beneath the hand has been thinking about meeting him since we've been speaking what would they do if they had the meeting my hands Lords up what will I do now father I've got many things that I do wrong I've just confessed my sin this morning before the church as I confessed with you on top of the mountain the other morning when it was blowing and snowing and up there on top of the mountain the high cried out and asked you to forgive me for my stupidity and how I've dreaded to come before my brother who some of them regard me as your Prophet servant and Lord how I hated to come to for them and tell them of a stupid act that I would do a thing like that but God is good for my soul that I confess my sins and not hide them so to be honest with you and right before the people I have confessed it Lord I'm wrong I'm all together wrong I pray forgiveness and then father I've been dilatory about you serving him many times maybe I could have went longer when I Didn't Do It father I confess my sins I want the angel of God to cleanse me from that of the blood of Jesus other hands went up tonight some of them maybe has never asked forgiveness before but I'm sure of this one thing if we'll confess our sins God will blot them out put them in the sea of forgiveness and never remember him no more and fathers I confess mine about misbehaving before them people I didn't carry on myself like a servant of Christ I didn't I was afraid that man might be angry with me and think I didn't want to hurt his feelings but I didn't think for what I was doing to you Lord and I I prayed that you forgive me and now father I know that if I ask forgiveness I have forgiveness and you put him in a sea of forgiveness and you'll never remember that no more God I'm thankful for that and I pray that you'll let every person here that has sin or besetting sin of anything before them may they remove it and put the Lord before them like David did for now we'd cry out woe is me for I have seen the glory of God I'm a man of unclean lips or a woman or girl of unclean lips boy or something whatever we might be we're unclean and we ask for the blood of Jesus Christ the appropriated sacrifice that cleanse us from all sin that we might ever dwell in his presence let us go from here tonight with our hearts rejoicing and our flesh resting in Hope knowing this that when Jesus does come we'll be raised with him in his likeness and shall meet him in the air in the Rapture when the countdown is finally over we see the seventh Church ages already counted out and we're ready now to take all we pray God that you before you close the door if there be one year tonight has never come in may they hurry in real quick for we feel that the door of Mercy between mercy and judgment is being closed those who will accept Mercy will step in those who will not come in will have to suffer judgment God closes the door May there not be a door closed tonight to every one of these confessing centers may we all have pardon in Mercy in Jesus Christ's name and our father for the sick and The Afflicted for those who are needing I pray that your grace will supply all that they have need of May this step into Christ into his presence Place Christ be Christ The Promise he was wounded for my transgressions that's my sins where these Stripes I am healed then I place the Lord before my sickness he's on my right hand and I shall not be moved then I'll walk boldly on confessing that I am healed by Strife I am healed granted the Lord to every one of them and we know that if we confess with our hearts and or with our lips and believe in our hearts then we have our desire he said when you say anything believe it comes to pass you can have what you've said we believe that father and believe that you'll cleanse us from all of our sins and heal all of our sickness and give us Grace Lord to serve you be with these people many of them are going to travel the dark roads tonight many of them will travel many miles don't let nothing happen to them Lord they come across the country to sit here to listen to the countdown to see how close we was to the end time now I've asked them to go away placing God before them always before them before anything else before their trip before their move before the before they get up after they go to bed always before they sleep whatever it is put God person boy is on my right hand I shall not be moved and may their hearts Rejoice to know that they have what they've asked for because God promised it and their flesh shall Rest In Hope Credit Lord for we ask that in Jesus Christ's name amen amen [Music] save me be safe Heal Me O Lord and I will be for you you are the one I pray Lord I may sing that as a prayer to him [Music] save me and I will be saved foreign [Music] [Music] you might be careful around each other and I know this offends my wife or I know my husband doesn't like this or that but how much before God and the one that watches but but when you do confess he forgives not only he forgives but he erases it it's cleansed not even he can bring it back up as hard as that is brother Brandon hits that he says he can forgive and forget I would offend you you would forgive me but you would remember he said you would offend me I would forgive but I would remember but in him it's all clean it's all done with and he didn't say only these and only that he said just come and make it right I've always said if you owe something once you pay it there's freedom from it it no longer has a bind on you you know paid in full by the blood of the Lamb has been taken care of what a promise you don't have to live in fear in an anguish anymore but as quickly as you can say Lord I'm sorry all right let's stand [Music] you know Hebrews 13 8 hasn't changed Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen it's a truth it's the word of God Amen we sung that song In The Presence of Jehovah two things that happened in the presence Jehovah once you realize how nothing you are but how great he is what a merciful god wonderful God he is we love him for them just one more time In The Presence of Jehovah in the presence [Music] prayer [Music] and hearts are made [Music] in a presence [Music] of the king I looked over Dan Roberts and his family there made me think of my brothers what sometimes we would do to one another how mean we could be at times but I remembered one time my elder brother was causing a little bit of trouble and my dad was concerned so he prayed to the Lord he said get his attention break his arm if you need to and my brother came home with a
