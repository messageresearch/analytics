continue to play has turned to Hebrews we continue on with our study on the chapter of he Hebrew or the book of Hebrews Hebrews chapter 12 we'll start with verse one the Apostle is speaking in reference to all of these great warriors of faith that we went over last week and all of their testimony and how that they showed faith and did great Miracles and wonders wherefore seeing we also are compassed with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which that EAS easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen let's bow our heads our heavenly father we're grateful grateful that we can come together in the name above all names the name of Jesus Christ this morning and Lord as we close this book of Hebrews we pray that your spirit father would be here and Lord that you would give me the wisdom to expound upon your word and father that your spirit would be welcome to move In and Out Among the people Reveal Your word father to all of us Lord with all that is in us with everything that we know we give you praise in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you can be [Music] seated it's good to see everyone in the house of the Lord this morning see a few visitors that uh I I recognize most of you but if if you raise your hand if if you're visiting this morning I see some there my brother here I met you earlier he said our brother here said he loves the Bible I do too man it's if you come to the Tucson Tabernacle I'm going to teach out of this book Brothers good to see good to see you back there welcome good to see you again God bless you all to all the visitors welcome we're honored that you would join us this morning um a couple housekeeping things um I uh printed for our upcoming camp that we're having in September uh we need some volunteers there's different jobs to do at the camp so there's a signup sheet out in the uh in the lobby or in the um Fellowship Hall if you would if you're willing to help uh it' probably be a few hours during the camp and we're going to try to distribute it so not one person is working too much but if you would sign up that you are willing to help and that is in the on the table in the fellowship hall there and tonight um we are going to have a testimony and worship service tonight I I just love this is one of my favorite things to do I love to hear the testimonies of the of the congregation and I love to hear the talent that the Lord has given us and the praise so tonight we're going to do that service starts at 5 o'cl come ready to give a short testimony not too long I know some of us like the guy in the pulpit sometimes we'll get on a testimony and and keep going but um a testimony or if you have a song to bless the congregation with so come tonight and come tonight expecting because I think that we're going to hear some really really good things one thing that sister Amelia just shared with me um just coming in she so if you were here last week I gave the testimony about the thrift store that's down on Stone uh Avenue down here and how it was just an amazing coincidence that the one of the people that has been through the the drug abuse program the substance abuse program and was in the middle of it was actually from Jeffersonville where I was for about 17 years and I remember I was I was asking the Lord Lord is this something that that is is pleasing to you and then one more he gave me another um Vindication so then sister Amelia goes down there and uh were you shopping or dropping off stuff I think you were shopping so sister milia is in there and she uh she talks to the same brother that's behind the counter that I talked to remember there was all of these uh people in there that had been through the program and I was praying Lord give us something that we can turn people to that that we can help out the community and um so then I met the guy that was from Jeffersonville and uh so anyways it was just an amazing time so sister Amilia goes in there and she um tells the the guy behind the the counter she um uh he asked or I think he asked you where you go to church right or did you tell him first he asked sister milia where you go to church and she says well you just go up here at the Tucson Tabernacle and he and she told told him about the testimony that I gave last week and and he's like oh yeah and he remembered and he he started telling her about it was just amazing and then he he looked at sister Amilia and he said what's your name and she said Amilia Gonzalez and he goes I knew it he said you're Adam's mom so he had known sister Amelia's son previously and I don't know were they the same age about the same age maybe went through some of the same troubles together so it's just another Vindication another blessing to me so we'll the Lord's willing we hear testimonies like that um tonight and um I uh let's see I don't think I forgot anything as far as announcements the camp and then tonight I'm looking forward to the camp it was it was a real blessing to us last year and it's going to be better this year it's going to be exciting I um again I I appreciate the visitors coming I just saw brother Amos I haven't seen you in a long time he's been in Africa for a while it's good to have you back home back sitting here with us God bless you my friend and then as I said all the all the visitors we have know brothers and sisters we often separate ourselves and it doesn't please the Lord he says Jesus Christ himself said that there will be one Shepherd and one fold so how can there be all of these different groups I understand that we have to have a place to go to church and there's there's different groups that we have together but how can these these not agree with each other and I know the reason it's because our foundations are different there is only one foundation on and that is the foundation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ what is the gospel the gospel is is the good news that God sent the Messiah Jesus Christ now tell the world anything other than that is not the gospel the very definition of the Gospel is that is Jesus Christ that is our foundation that is the love that we should have for each other and and we do have for each other it is not in well I believe this way or I believe that way or I believe in this Prophet or that prophet of this way of having church or that way of having church I believe in Jesus Christ and him alone and he is the reason for every all of the love that's in the world it comes from him and he is the reason that we can gather together and you look at this church and there's many different types of people there's many people that look different ways and it should be that way brothers and sisters it should be that way you know how I know that because the man Jesus Christ came he had Mary Magdalene in his group a prostitute he had Nathaniel a well-rounded polished believer strong no gu in that man he had Peter and John rough fisherman Peter even a man that cussed I'm not right in doing it obviously but a man that had probably a foul mouth before he was with Jesus Jesus a whole different variety of people and that's who Jesus called his disciples and that's what we should have the Tucson Tabernacle as I've said many times it's a church but more important it is a Ministry if you come to this church don't come just to come and enjoy a sermon and sing songs of praise brothers and sisters there's other places that that that's four if you come here you have a Ministry you have something to do and there is a lot to do and it may be anything from helping around the church to witnessing everybody should be a witness first of all not everyone is a witness yes everyone is and it's to your family to your friends to the people on the street and I don't care what they look like I don't care their past right Jesus Christ didn't care he brought them in and then he wiped that past away he wiped those sins away and that's what this church is about it is about a Ministry in doing good and remember when you come to church it's not all about you something I say all the time you come to not only receive a blessing but more importantly you come to give a blessing you come to encourage you you come to to have a part in a great work what greater work is there than leading someone to Christ brother Mark there's no greater work and that person that that you lead to Christ maybe your daughter your son your brother your sister your neighbor someone on the street but there's no greater work that we could do and this book of Hebrews for our visitors we started a few months ago and I felt usually on Wednesday night we have a Wednesday night Bible study and that's that's our Wednesday night service and we we started in the book of Acts and we went chapter by chapter line by line all the way through the book of Acts then after that we started and we it's like well let's go through the whole Bible let's take one service and devote it to each book of the Bible so we do that on Wednesday night uh I'll be teaching on Jeremiah this coming Wednesday give an overview of of that book but I felt on my heart that this book of Hebrews is something that I would like to take for a Sunday morning and we've gone line by line word by word from Hebrews 1 all the way until now and if the Lord's willing we'll finish the book this morning it's written to Hebrews you can remember that it's written to Jewish people that had converted to Christianity so these are the the original Messianic Jews now today you see Messianic Jews and what they are is they converts to Judaism that now want to um have Jesus and Judaism together that's not that's just that that's called being a Christian if you accept Christ but these are the original ones the original Jews who accepted this man Jesus Christ and the author of this book is writing saying hey don't let these things slip you're starting to go back to your old way of thinking you're starting to go back to your legalism you're starting to go back to the what what you learned as a child but no this is something that you don't know the importance of it it is something so great this man Jesus Christ and the Very things that you want to go back to are what he fulfilled I've talked about it talks about the the high priest and how Jesus Christ is that true high priest one that doesn't have to make a sacrifice for himself because of his own sins because he was without sin he was the sacrifice and then it goes and we talk about we talked about MDC and his role this was actually this man Jesus Christ in another form way back hundreds and hundreds of years before Jesus came in the flesh and he made himself known to this man Abraham but he was different because he had no beginning of days or ending of life this man was God manifested in front of Abraham we talked about those things and we talked about in the the book of Hebrews keeps going back to the Jewish way of thinking and it keeps saying listen this man is the Fulfillment of all this all the prophets pointed to this man all of the scribes and all of the true teachers point to this man he is everything and that's what the book of Hebrews is is all about it's reminding the reader don't let these things slip you've been given a great honor and we take that all the way to today we have been given a great honor to know Jesus Christ as our savior so in Hebrews 11 Let's uh let's start let's let's dig into the word into the Bible let's go to Hebrews 11 and we'll start with verse 32 just as a review of what we just came for Hebrews 11:32 says this and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of baric and of Samson and of jeepa of David also and Samuel and of all the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms W wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scorings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were saw asunder they were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy I love that part praise the Lord because I want to be numbered with those people I want to be right there with them they lived in their day we live in this day they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise keep that in mind the author here is laying a foundation for what the close of his letter is going to be they receed not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect chapter 12 wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does EAS easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us so he he says here he says lay aside those things that weigh you down can you imagine a sprinter in the Olympics carrying a backpack and trying to run the 100 meter and that's what he's telling us he's saying you're carrying a weight that you you don't have to carry he says get off Let It Go let that weight go and that weight can be anything we always think that that weight is a sin that we're doing and it is usually it's something that hinders our walk with the lord it's something that hinders our prayers and we're carrying this and we don't want to give up this this burden that we're Laden with so we carry it and he's like you got to run the race man run faster and you can't run faster carrying this heavy burden many times that heavy burden is our church many times it's the way that we believe and we we Laden ourselves with this heavy weight and down deep we know that it's not necessary in another place Paul says he says you lay these burdens upon these believe it's in Galatians you lay these burdens upon the people who which you yourself weren't able to carry and then you ministers are trying to pack them down with this that's not the way you throw these things off and now you're free and say Lord now you use me Lord now you tell me what I need to know that's the role of every minister of every true minister of God it's not to lay down a certain theology or a certain way of thinking everything that we do every scripture that we read every story that I tell should be to get you to talk to him and the closer you are to him the more that the pastor steps out because I'm going to fail but he will never fail the holy spirit that is within you will always tell you the right thing whether it be what time you get up in the morning to what what job that you take to where you go to church if you just know him then he will lead and he will guide and he promis to do it it's not just coming to church many times we come and we are ladened with a big burden sister milia that's that's some of the in the past pass there and it hasn't got us any closer to God but what gets us closer to God is throw off that burden and run the race to the author and finisher you you have your mind set and your heart set on Jesus Christ that's the Finish Line run that way don't run off the track this way or that way focus on him where was I for consider him that endured such a contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be weary and faint in your minds you have not resisted under blood striving against sin so he's saying that listen I know you've tried and I know you've been working but you haven't resisted so much that you have shed your own blood against sin nobody set a beer in front of you and said drink it or we're going to beat you to death nobody's done that we do it we do it to ourselves nobody has has has told you that if you don't do this thing or that thing that you're going to get stabbed or you're you're going to get you're going to shed your own blood we can do it we can we can overcome sin and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son who whom he receiveth if you endure if ye endure chastening God dealth with you as Sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not if ye be without chastisement whereof all our partakers then you are bastards and not Sons Chason the dictionary says Chason is to inflict suffering upon for a purpose of moral Improvement every pretty much every other translation of the Bible says discipline we are disciplined a child without discipline will almost always go to immoral Behavior because they're taught to do do whatever when a child's growing up and you don't discipline that child he's always taught to do whatever feels good do whatever you like to do and Satan's right there and he has this attraction and he draws these children and if they don't have if they didn't grow up with parents that had rules and discipline them then they will almost always go towards sin almost always furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection under the father of spirits and live so we had all of us have dads that that gave us correction and mothers that gave us correction but shall much much more rather shall we be in subjection to the father of spirits and live so so being in subjection to God and remember when when uh tell a story about Daniel where's my boy at where's there he is so we had moved and uh we're in this this house and and Daniel I don't know he's like four or five and uh my wife reminded me of it this morning that's why I'm thinking about it so Daniel um he gets in he and his friend get into our bedroom and they get into Stephanie's jewelry box and they proceeded to flush all of her jewelry down the toilet I guess he was a step ahead the woman shall Adorn herself in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with gold or pearls or costly array I don't think that was his purpose in doing it but the but the boy needed to be chastened he needed to be corrected I wanted to kill him not kill him just maim him that that he will always remember remember what he did but it required correction what if I would have just said oh you know it's okay it's okay buddy he needed I don't remember if I spanked him or not I know I wanted to but I know that it said Daniel this is mom's stuff buddy you you you ruined it you lost it you you know how much money that cost me so then Stephanie this morning she has a little charm and she says I used to have a blue one I knew where she was going with it didn't you honey and she told me do you remember where the first one went I said yeah Jeffersonville sewer we need to correct our children we need to show them what is right we need there has to be chastisement there or they will it's human nature will go towards sin furthermore we have had Fathers as I just read of our flesh with flesh with corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection under the father of the of spirits and live for verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness I know it's difficult to understand more modern translation says this for they meaning our Earthly fathers dis disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them but he disciplines us for our good that we may share in his Holiness now no chastening for the present seem to be joyous but Grievous sure Daniel was not enjoying what happened after he flushed the jewelry but it was for his own good but he for our Prophet I'm sorry now chastening for the present seem to seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward yith the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby let me let me read another translation for the moment all discipline for the moment all discipline seems to be painful rather than pleasant but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it where therefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed so if if you break a bone and it's out of place that bone needs to be set right so it can heal and move in the right direction otherwise it's going to be deformed there's going to be a problem there but when we make mistakes we need to go back and we need to set those right so after that then we can continue on James says therefore confess your sins one to another so if we've done wrong set that bone confess your sins one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much it has great power in it's working so when we take communion and there's sin there and there's Discord Among Us the Bible says for this cause many are sick and weakly among you and many are dead and they died needlessly if we would be where we're supposed to be with the sin set aside and these these weights that we have off of us then we would see more of the blessings of God but it's our own fault that we don't see more of his blessings we're always saying brother this is going to happen and that's going to happen the earthquake is going to be over here and this is going to be over here and then we're going to just speak the word brother and then we're going to speak worlds in existence wait a minute but you're lying right now you're sinning right now how can God bless that how can God give us this if we are not doing what we should be doing follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord it means strive for peace strive for peace with everyone and for the Holiness without which no one will see the Lord so there is a Holiness associated with serving the lord there is a Holiness associated with salvation looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness spring up any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and their five therefore many be defiled so the author is saying that this root of bitterness between you this Strife this fighting it's sin you know we think of sin as as infidelity or or or lying or or doing those but but Strife between Brethren that's sin I look at the love having this cross behind me as I preach you look at that cross and you look at how many victories were won on the cross we all know Jesus conquered death hell on the grave he conquered hell death he went down after he died made atonement for those that were waiting and then he took his own life and raised it up let me give you a victory on the cross that you may not have you may not think about very much when Jesus during his ministry he was hated you know that a lot of times people will talk about us and maybe we can handle it some of us can't when somebody criticizes you or or um says maybe something false about you or maybe says something true about you that really gets to you but what about if someone criticizes your children or criticizes your mother I told Jesus that his mother slept with a Roman soldier Romans were unclean according to the Jewish beliefs they were they were filthy filthy they many times they couldn't even touch a Roman telling him his mother had an affair and he was the product of this affair imagine how that would make you feel put yourself in that situation this insults and then as time went on more insults calling him all of these lies saying that he was a worshipper of the devil and and saying that he did these Miracles by the devil and he's just going on and doing the best that he can and then finally they they bring him to the Cross they bring him to the trial condemn him to death he carries the cross through Jerusalem carries his own instrument of death they lay him down on there nail him to this cross and they put him up if I be lifted up I will draw all men to me there he was lifted up in front of the people and I want to I want to tell you a victory that he gave and I want everyone here some struggle with it more than others but I want everyone here to think of someone or something that has bothered you that you hold against someone Jesus was there none of us have been done as wrong as him and what were his words father forgive them Father forgive them for they know not what they do imagine us let me tell you something if someone does you wrong if someone hurts you talks about your children if you want Victory get on your knees and pray for that person wow that's the victory he won there as I said there were many victories on the cross but imagine he won that Victory Satan was there saying speak against them have thoughts in your mind against them hate them and if we have the spirit of Christ we pray pray for those people as Jesus said in the Beatitudes in the on The Sermon on the Mount pray for those which despitefully use you do we do it I will give you advice if you do it you will get the victory you will be amazed get on your knees enter into that person's suffering whatever that person may be that person that did you wrong and pray for that person loving that person and then you will have the victory so you think I forgive them so who got the victory do you think it was the person that Did You Wrong got the victory no you don't get the victory you get the victory because you overcame it now you raised yourself higher then the Bible says that when you do that you pour heaping coals upon their head you don't want to do that that's not why it's like well I'm going to forgive them so they have coals dumped on their head no that's not that's not that's not the right it's not the right way of thinking but God instructs us he says listen there's one thing that's for me and this is God speaking God the father he says vengeance is mine you don't do it you don't fight it out vengeance is from me I take care of that Romans 12 it says dearly beloved avenge not yourself but rather give Place unto wrath leave to wrath leave it to the wrath of God for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay sayeth the Lord therefore if thine enemy hunger thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing Thou shalt Heap coals of fire on his head but be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good sometimes it's a little bit by a little bit sometimes it's harder for some people to do it than others a little bit in a little bit and then finally you'll say oh I have victory over it back to Hebrews 12 lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau for one for who one who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright for you know how afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears another translation says verse number 16 that no one is sexually immoral or Unholy like Esau who sold his Birthright after a single meal for you know that afterward he desired to inherit the blessing he was rejected for he found no chance to repent though he s sought it with tears so we look at Esau and Jacob we know the story of them if you've been coming to our Bible studies you know in Genesis we talked about really the fathers of the faith and Jacob was that so you have Esau and Jacob they're twins they came out of the womb fighting Esau came out first he was the first born Jacob had a hold of his foot his eel and then they came out and they they didn't get along their whole lives so but Esau had the birthright he had the blessing of his father remember what we talked about last week that we can bless our children and Esau blessed his children so Esau was hungry he didn't really care necessarily about serving the lord but he was by if you outward look Esau was a better man he was a better son to his father he was maybe a harder worker he was somebody brothers and sisters he was the person that maybe we would elect as a pastor of a church or as as a leader because he looked more of the part and he maybe could talk more of the part but God chose Jacob because Jacob he had more of a reverence for God's word he had a more of a reverence for God so Esau's hungry you know the story he comes in Jacob makes this pottage this this bowl of stew and he says give me some of that I'm starving I feel like I'm going to die and he's and and Jacob says sell me the birthright and I'll give you some Esau didn't care about the birthright that really wasn't in him to have that reverence for God he says whatever didn't think much of it whatever take it yeah yeah sure just give me something to eat God was looking down at that moment and he saw that decision by Esau be careful whatever you say whatever decision you make whatever Covenant you enter into because that was that Covenant right there and it was a b it was over a bowl of soup and he didn't even think about it it wasn't important to him but God saw it it might be an engagement to a boy or a girl it might be a a a a business deal It Whatever It Is be careful with what you say be careful with what you do because God is looking down and it may be a covenant like this was so then later on Isaac their dad is ready to give the blessings and he was going to bless his firstborn prophet of God so Jacob comes and he deceives his dad Esau was a hairy guy so he put the goat the piece of goat hide on his on his arm he makes his dad some food and his dad can't see his dad's blind he comes in and he says who who are you and he says I'm I'm Esau and he's like man you sound like Jacob and he's like nope I'm Esau here feel my hairy arm said comes in and Isaac says okay and it was time for his Blessing Isaac's time was coming to an end he lays his hand on his son Esau and gives him the blessing of the firstborn he lays lays his hand on Jacob and gives him the blessing of the firstborn Esau so then Esau comes in a little bit later who was going out to get to kill a deer so he could make it for his dad his favorite meal and he comes in and the dad was like wait a minute you sound like Esau and he says yeah Dad bless me he says no I already blessed your brother he said he tricked me but God had already seen the Covenant before Isaac was in the perfect will of the Lord when he blessed Jacob he blessed Jacob because they had all God knew he they had already made that deal earlier Esau had already given up the birth right so now he blesses Jacob they call it the stolen blessing wasn't the it was it was the deal that they made Jacob Esau didn't care we should always brothers and sisters everything that we do take great care take great care in every decision that you make take great care in everything that you say because God is watching let's continue on well let me let me let me stop there for a minute you notice he puts in the same in the same sentence he puts J Esau who despised the birthright didn't care about the birthright and then immoral sexually immorally living and puts Esau right there you know Esau as I said he didn't care much about the birthright he didn't care much about about serving the lord so what he did he goes and he marries a worldly girl broke his parents' heart he marries these girls they his polygamy was back then he marries them the Canaanite women the idol worshippers and it it just destroyed him he didn't listen to Mom and Dad there's a reason for you kids there's a reason mom and dad are trying to get you to be with good Christian boys and girls it's because we see just like Isaac and Rebecca we see that your life could be ruined don't despise that Birthright don't despise what the Lord has done for you and don't run with the world don't go after the worldly things go after the things of god let's continue on verse number 18 for you're not come under the mountain for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of the trumpet and the words and the voice of Words which which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake so you know what he's talking about here he's talking about the time that Moses got the people together he said consecrate yourself because we are going to meet the Lord so they go to the foot of Mount Si and the the rule was that no not a beast not a man anything can touch this mountain and the the lights were going off and the fire was going off and the Thunder was going off and it was a it was a it was a terribly frightening experience and the people go up there and they're like whoa this is this is way more than we thought it would be we don't we don't want this because if God's going to speak and they saw all their sins they said we're going to die they said let Moses speak and not God God says okay and that fear of God was in the people but remember that fear of God will fade and the next thing we know they build a golden calf Moses leaves for a while they build a golden calf they they throw all their jewelry in there and and and Aaron Aaron builds this Idol and they're living worldly they're they're they're living like they're living terrible sinful lives and this was not too long after they had just come to that mountain and saw the power of God and were scared to death the be the fear of God as the Bible says is the beginning of wisdom that's just the start of it but there's more and here's what that more is but ye but you so they went to this other Mount Si but you are come to Mount Zion and under the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and and to God and to the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect so this is not all just Christ that's the firstborn when you are born reborn when you have that new birth and you are filled with the Holy Spirit now you are the firstborn of God you are born to him you are his son you are his daughter how many times have we heard brother brandom say that God doesn't have grandchildren and that's the same with this you are not there is no no one in between you and Christ it is you and him and when you are reborn now you come to Mount Zion now remember Abel from the last service remember when abble when his voice cried out from the blood to God there was such Faith there that even in his death and and and his blood poured out on the ground it was crying out to God but what was it crying out for he was crying out for justice but now through the cross and that blood that poured out from the cross and came out on the ground that blood is no longer crying for justice jce for us that blood now is crying out for Mercy for us is a different Covenant and to Jesus the meteor of the New Covenant and to and to the blood of the sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel remember Abel wanted Justice Christ is Grace whose voice then sh shook the Earth remember the mountain I'm coming to the mountain but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken and of the things that are made and those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire so even though that blood that was spilled out on the ground from Christ it is crying out for grace and crying out for Mercy our God is the same God and just because we have Grace and just because we have mercy doesn't mean that we can sin we're going to sin we're going to make mistakes but the author is talking about before chastising his children so we'll suffer for everything that we do every mistake that we make and I want to suffer here on Earth because I don't want to suffer on the other side Hebrews 13 now the author he's closing this letter and he wants to give instructions to the people remember he's gone through a lengthy dissertation on bringing Christ out of the Old Testament making him higher than the prophets higher than the angels and replacing that sacrificial lamb with Jesus and and he's he's told the people that there is a better way than what you have done you did the best that you could but now there is a New Covenant that's better than the old one so before it was you came to the priest you offered a sacrifice for your sins and it stayed the WRA of God that was the Old Testament the old Covenant but then when Christ came there was a New Covenant a new testament and that's why we have our separation between the two books this is after Christ has come in the book of Hebrews over and over it says it's a better way and what does he say in his closing statements he wants us he wants to leave us with something very important he says let brother Brotherly Love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unaware I have a few minutes I'll tell I'll tell a story I believe I saw an angel one time I was a young man I was a boy Adam how old are you yeah 13 I was like two years younger than you and I um was hunting with my dad and I just loved to go hunting I thought I mean it was just my mind my my heart everything was always wanting to be in the woods and and I always just longed to go elk hunting so what I did is I read the I got a hold of the sporting good store I got a hold of the the regulations and I read cover to cover and I was able to get a check from Mom and Dad and um put us in for the lottery for going elk hunting while we got drawn me and my dad and a couple others so we go up there and I'm just I'm just a kid and it's uh cold and it's snowing and we're out hunting and I got separated from my dad they had shot an elk and I wandered off and then I saw some elk running out in the distance so I go after them and now I'm this little boy in this snowstorm freezing cold and I'm not thinking of anything but killing one of those elk so one stops and I lay down as my dad had taught me and I shoot the thing and I walked up to it and I'm just smaller than Adam I'm this little guy and I go up there and I was like oh I remember dad dragging it back um with a deer so I I couldn't even lift the head of the thing I'm like man what am I going to do so I get my backpack and I get my knife out I was like okay I can do this remember watching dad do it so I'm looking at the thing pouring down snow can't see from me to you Harley Manny I just it was just a blizzard condition and I'm like okay and Out of the Woods out of a blizzard comes a man he walks up to me and he says uh he says nice one and I said I said yeah I shot it and he says he says you know what you're going to do now and I was like yep I'm GNA gut it and he said you need some help I said yes sir so he helped me get through cleaning this elk again it's snowing and cold and and then uh we got about finished he says okay he says you can finish from here on out I'll see and he walks back into the blizzard and into the forest so finally after an hour or so I get in my backpack and I had this orange Poncho and uh I set up a little Camp there and and um it clears up and then I see my dad over across the meadow a couple hundred yards away and he sees my orange Poncho and he comes and and he says wow buddy you really good job he says you did all that I said yep lied um and I felt bad but then my dad goes and tells everybody that yeah my son 11 years old he he goes out and he kills his elk he gutted it himself and cleaned it and got everything ready and I was like man I can't confess now so years went on decades actually went by I never told that but I really believe that that was an angel that came out of the woods may it may not have been I mean it may have been just another Hunter he didn't have a gun he didn't have a knife it may have been another hunter that came out of the woods in the middle of nowhere in a snowstorm and and helped me a 11-year-old boy and uh then walked back into the snowstorm and left this 11-year-old boy by himself in a blizzard it could have been that but I don't think it was we entertain Angels not knowing that they are angels let's continue on and finish remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body put yourselves brothers and sisters all of us either have family members or we know people that are in prison or there's people here that have been in prison how much does it mean to you when somebody visits how much does it mean when you get a letter how much does it mean when you have contact from the outside it's very very important don't neglect those people as if you were in prison let me let me read um Jesus said this Matthew 25 he said when the son of man comes in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then he will sit on the throne of his glory all the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate them one from another as the she Shepherd divides his sheep from the goats and he will set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on his left then the king will say to those on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was hungry and you gave me food I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in I was naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came to me and we know the story they say when did we ever do that and he says in so much as you have done it unto these the least of these you've done it to me so don't neglect those that are in need the musicians can come and we'll finish marriage is Honorable in all and the bed undefiled but hor mongers and adulterers God will judge he's saying here that keep the marital relations between a husband and a a wife God allows that but keep it holy make sure if you are married that your relations are with your spouse don't bring pornography into your home have upright with your spouse and and love your spouse and then if you are not married you live a celibate life there is no brothers and sisters it is very very plain here that there is no sex outside of marriage we don't say that enough too too much too often we are telling our children you're bride and you're special and and you're gonna do all these things and we're just waiting for the coming of the Lord and he's going to call his bride and you're different and we don't teach him about this Morality In our homes and then they go and it causes them to sin and then they fail it needs to be taught I know it's an uncomfortable subject but we need to understand that our children need to understand live a clean moral life and marriage is before God it is a wonderful thing but honor it and as he's saying here the bedroom is undefiled don't bring sin into your house you men not that of course you're not going to have an affair with a woman but don't even want to have an affair with another woman Jesus said that if you look up a if you look on a woman and you want to have that then you are guilty of that make sure that that home is undefiled that bedroom is undefiled I need five more minutes before we start let your conversation be without Covetous and be content with such things as you have said as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me remember them which have rule over over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow consider the end of their conversation another translation says remember your leaders those who spoke to you the word of God consider the outcome of their life of their way of life and imitate their faith I believe the author is talking about pastors in the ministry I believe that that's why it's so important for a pastor to live a life that is worthy of the Gospel not try to control the people not try to beat down the people people but be an example to the people so that the people want to imitate your way of life to to see that love that comes from the pulpit that's the representation but he's also I believe he's also talking about those that teach your children they should want to be like their parents our children should want to be like us because we have set that word before him and then we have acted upon that word we need to be examples a as Christians as Believers the way that we win people to the Lord is we have a good representation of Jesus Christ so that people want to be like us instead we try to separate and separate and separate and what good does that do we should live a life that is full of love full of kindness and compassion and giving so that people look to us as being someone that they want to imitate as the as the Bible says sister Priscilla was telling me um about uh I don't know if it's her brother or her brother-in-law but she said that he gave his heart to the Lord and he said that everybody just loved him so much and he was such an important part of their family and the kids just really looked up to him because he loved him so much and he would talk about the Lord they wanted to imitate him he was a very very important part in their life because they knew he loved them Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever our most common scripture that we all know brother brandom's theme scripture and it's talking about setting an example this Jesus Christ that manifested it in these Hebrew Hebrew these um Heroes of Faith in in chapter 11 should be the same Jesus Christ that's here today doing the same thing and how do you do it you live that life you you put God first in everything take off those weights and run the race be not carried about the divers and strange doctrines for it is good a good thing that the heart be established with Grace not with Meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein he's talking about legalism these doctrines the way that you will recognize a strange Doctrine brothers and sisters is when it points you to himself the man or if it points you to a special Revelation that they have instead of pointing you to Christ read your Bible everything in this book from Matthew through Revelation everything points us to Christ and if these doctrines come in whether be our church or wherever and it's something that pointing you to some new revelation or something that's different and it's not lifting up Christ before you if it's lifting up a man or or or some other Doctrine then it is false be careful we are constantly warned of false Doctrine and false teachers and they're trying to Domin at the people they're trying to control the people and it's really easy is this does this book line up does their Doctrine line up with this book or is it something new or is it something different it's got to line up there and if you know your Bible you have to to discern the truth from a lie you got to know the truth first it's important to know the book it's important to read it it's important to understand it if you have trouble with the King James get another translation it doesn't do you any good if you can't understand it and let the Holy Spirit lead you as you read it you have to know the truth before you can discern the truth from falsehood let's skip to uh verse 17 obey them that have rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch over your souls as they must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable to you brothers and sisters as I said every man every Minister will give an account of what he preaches and if he is trying to fill a church if he's trying to control the people or if he's trying to be if he's a minister for money or for popularity or for influence or whatever it will fail but if that minister is trying to point you to Christ and doing everything that he can that is the what's right but if you see that creeping in run away from it get away from that dominating Spirit there's a warning in the Book of Revelation say talking about the Nicol itans they dominate conquer the people the very name of the word the very meaning of the word is conquer the people conquer the lady and then our brother goes on he greets the people and he uh I'll just read it we'll read to the end pray for us for We Trust we have good conscience and all things willing to live honestly but I beseech you the rather to do this that I may be restored to you the sooner now that God now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen and I beseech you Brethren suffer the word of exhortation for I have written a letter unto you in a few words and then he greets and then he goes on talks about something that was going on at that time I know know ye that our brother Timothy is set at Liberty he was freed from prison with whom if he comes shortly I will see you salute all them that have rule over you and the Saints they of Italy Salute You Grace be with you all amen the book of Hebrews it's been a few months and um brothers and sisters I I pray that that you've gotten more understanding of this book it covers everything from Genesis to Revelation it covers holy living living right rightly it covers marital relations between a husband and a wife it covers the the high priest it covers mzc covers Angels It's a Wonderful it's a masterpiece of a book and um I pray that it's been a blessing brother Josiah I have been blessed God's so good to me precious are his thoughts of you and me no

children about him he taught us to live good holy lives to prefer our Brethren over ourselves to pray for those that despitefully use you I said it earlier but I promise you if you will sincerely pray for that person who has given your problems or offended you I know that you will have the victory over that over that problem Jesus said it it's not me saying it he was on the cross what a victory he
