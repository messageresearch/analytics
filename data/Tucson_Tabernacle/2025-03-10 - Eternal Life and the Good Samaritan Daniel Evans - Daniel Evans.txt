trophies At Last I lay down I will C to the old ruged cross and exchange it somay for a crown and there's something about those old songs wow they just bring such a spirit while I have your standing let's turn to Luke Chapter 2 in a familiar story familiar Parable start with verse [Music] 30 it says this Luke [Music] 10:3 and Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among Thieves which stripped him of his reignment wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a Samaritan certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an end and took care of him and on the tomorrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee which now of these three thinkest thou was a neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he that showed Mercy on him and Jesus said unto him go and do thou likewise father thank you for your word lord it's in our heart father to understand the words that were spoken by Jesus Christ I pray that we would get the meaning Lord of this Parable that you would bless us here today Lord when we leave May our thoughts be upon the scriptures and our thoughts on Jesus Christ Lord with increased faith knowing that this book called The Bible applies directly to our lives in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated thank you welcome God bless you all it's good to be in the house of the Lord Alexis good to see you God bless you welcome you're not a visitor anymore but it's good it's good to see you God bless you Heath and and Melissa God bless you welcome um sister yarro you have uh your niece Audrey pal with you God bless you there you are God bless you welcome it's good to see you Eli and Kendall and the family welcome God bless you all see any other visitors if there's visitors here we welcome you and and thanks for coming um I want to share a couple testimonies with the church this morning before we get into this parable of the Good Samaritan as I've said before we're on a we're on a series on Parables ah Kanani God bless you welcome good to see you yeah brother brother Lionel's daughter it was that little girl that brought you to this church for the first time welcome it's it's good to see you sister Canady bless you um I want to share a couple testimonies with the church before we get into The Parables the um the Lord's really good to us brother Josiah shared this with me the other day and I I thought it would be encouraging to the church to hear this he had a burden on his heart for this country music singer named Granger Smith does anybody know who Granger Smith is you're not going to get in trouble if you raise your hand um famous country music singer and uh it was on josi's heart this man really needs to get saved and he was at a prayer booth and in Lyndon in Lyndon Washington up where brother Josiah's from and they they have a they're at the fair and they have this booth that's set up that's just for people to come in and and pray for for them if you need prayer so brother Josiah and his team were there and of course praying for the people and in the big bleacher area the big big Stadium there there was a a man that was scheduled to be there and it was this Granger Smith and Josiah had it on his heart before he he just had a burden for this young man and he was performing as I said at the same venue and Josiah said he said I wanted to just meet him and shake his hand and I wanted to tell him that he should be using his influence to preach the gospel he said I wanted him to use his platform that he has and it was on my mind and that he said the thought that that came to him was to pray for these things that you want to tell him so you might not get to shake his hand but the Lord was speaking to Josiah saying well pray pray those things instead of you having you telling him in person pray those things so brother Josiah went and he got out in private and in in the booth there and no one knew and he prayed he said this platform that God has given you is not to Serve Yourself it's to serve God so then about that time they could hear in the stadium they could hear this man Granger Smith singing and the other day brother Josiah was sharing this with me he said the other day he was in his car and he was listening to the radio good music on the radio Christian music Christian radio and he was listening and they played part of a Granger Smith song and Josiah thought I wonder why they're playing country music on our gospel radio program and then the announcer came on and said this after 24 years touring as an award-winning Platinum selling country music singing songwriter Granger Smith chose to leave the music business and pursue a future in the ministry when brother Josiah told me that I said that's scriptural I said you wanted to go shake his hand and you wanted to introduce him to the Lord Jesus but scripture says you go into your closet in private and you go before the Lord in private and then God will reward you openly and now this man has a podcast I believe he said and he's preaching the gospel he's answering questions and and brother Josiah said he's just wonderful he's he's really got a wonderfully unique perspective and I I just it's like well there's a a prayer answered and then brother uh Ed this morning he was traveling to uh New Mexico to Los crusis and he was gonna visit his son he was delivering a big load of material from our church to go to Uganda Africa and when he got to about Deming New Mexico a giant dust storm brought visibility almost to zero and he was able to get off the freeway at Demming and he drove into the Walmart parking lot there and I believe brother Ed you said it was about 4:00 or so that you about 4:30 that you pulled into this Walmart parking lot and the EMS said that I 10 was closed and they would not have I 10 open until about 7 o'clock that evening so three hours or so later wasn't until I 10 wouldn't be open you can imagine I 10 when we have a traffic jam on I 10 you can imagine what it was there in New Mexico so brother Ed and sister Kathy they pull into a parking space at Walmart and brother Ed just lays his seat back and just lays back and and relaxes and he going to pass the time he he couldn't go back he he couldn't go around he couldn't go head West or Head East he had nowhere to go so there he is in the parking lot and he was just was laying there and something said to him the thought came to his mind speak to the storm brother Ed said he prayed to the Lord Jesus he said well he said Jesus spoke to the storm and it went away and he prayed Lord send the storm away and then was it on the radio brother no no no then you looked over and he looked over on the freeway and he sees the trucks and they start to move you know everything kind of cleared up and he looked and he could see the the uh the highway there and then the big semis they started to move and they started to go and he got on he says well let's give it a shot so they get they pull out of Walmart they pull up onto the freeway and they get onto the freeway and everything was wide open and the storm was gone brother Daniel do you think because of brother Ed's prayer that the storm went away and Interstate 10 started flowing again do you think because of brother Josiah's prayer that this world famous country music singer would give his heart to the Lord Jesus and start preaching the gospel brother Daniel do you really think that yes absolutely I do no I absolutely believe that yes and there is nothing wrong why pray if we don't expect to get what we what we pray for and I say we go into our closet we we sit back in our pickup truck we we go into our booth that we're witnessing to people we go to the Lord in private and then he will reward you openly he's not the Lord's not exalting you he's not exalting brother Ed he's not ex exalting brother Josiah the Lord is proving that he's God and he's blessing everyone that's around us when we truly have that relationship with the Lord Jesus I um want to talk about this parable of this Good Samaritan there's hospitals named after the Good Samaritan there's there's laws throughout the country the Good Samaritan law where if you go and you're honestly trying to help someone and you end up doing damage to that person then you are protected by this Good Samaritan law because you actually you had good motives and you were trying to to help there's the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association um the the humanitarian arm of Billy Graham Ministries is called Samaritan's Purse named after this man that we're going to talk about today this Good Samaritan so we need to understand what's going on in this Parable called the Good Samaritan it's one of those ones we've all heard it we all know it but do we understand the foundation do we understand how important it is it's like oh yeah well well if we see somebody that needs help you know we're supposed to help him that's just a little part of it it's a lot deeper than just helping somebody on the street that's just got beat up and sitting there bleeding there's a lot more to it to properly understand it I believe we need to put it into context so let's go to chap Luke chapter 10 and let's see what leads up to this Parable that I just talked about Luke chap 10: 21 we could start there Jesus had just sent out the 70 disciples and they came back and they said Lord even the devils are subject to us so the the Lord Jesus was he was happy and in in that hour Luke 10:21 and in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them to babies even so father for it so for so it seemed good in th sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knows know who is the son but who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him so you can only know God the Father through Jesus Christ friends Christianity is an exclusive thing you can only know God the Father through Jesus Christ you can't know him through the Hindu religion you can't know him through the Muslim religion you can't know him through these other other religions Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life and no man can come to the father except by me so we have to know Christ he's very very important and he turned him to his disciples and he said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see for I tell you that many prophet prophets and Kings have desired to see the things which you see and have not seen them and to hear the things which you hear and have not heard them what a statement that Jesus is saying now he's got his group of disciples around here and he's saying listen friends listen that all of the great men that you've ever heard of Moses Elijah they all wanted to be in the position that you're in right now they all wanted to see what you are seeing they all wanted to hear what you are hearing they all wanted Jesus saying they all wanted to see me they all wanted to hear me they all wanted to hear what I have to say because I am the Fulfillment of everything he is beyond all the prophets wanted to hear him all the great ones they are nothing compared to this man that was standing before these disciples and speaking to them privately he is beyond our understanding even today the stars and the skies who placed the who placed the Stars up there who put life into US Jesus the the the Lord said to I Believers to Jeremiah I formed you in your mother's womb and he did all things through Jesus Christ so we can't know the father without knowing the Lord and there's nothing brothers and sisters there's nothing simple about him he is very complex he's very deep we always want to understand something a little bit more than Jesus or something Beyond Jesus there is nothing Beyond him he is the greatest when we open up our book I was witnessing to um to these kids in the airport I don't know a couple years ago and the uh I could tell the family I could just tell they're a Christian I could tell they're a sweet family they the kids were I don't know they had three two or three kids and I just struck up a conversation with the dad and then the the kids started talking with me and and I got down on my knee and I had my Bible and I said hey I want to show you something I said do you see this book and I showed him this and I said said what color is this and they said black and I said what color is this and they said red I said why is are some why is some of it black and some of it red and the kids were like I don't know there just little kids I don't know and I said that's because do you know who Jesus is I said yeah I said that's because Jesus gets his own special color in the Bible he's special he's more special than any of the other people in the whole Bible they all talked about him so he gets his own special color and those words that are in red they are deeper than any other words there that that are all the words in Black they're pointing to the words in red wow I heard a somebody the other day that was that was visiting and they go to a um I believe they go to an Apostolic Church um where they live and uh the one of them was saying well we we go to this Apostolic church because we don't have one of our churches there and they said you know we get some crumbs where we go I heard that you get some crumbs does I didn't say this but thought came to my mind does the pastor read the words and R and you're telling me those are crumbs those are the words of eternal life and I don't care who reads it you could you could have anybody read this book they are still the words of eternal life and they as I said they are deeper than anything in the world we talk about well we want meat we want maybe the the revelation of the the Seven Seals or or the revelation of the seven Thunders or or we want to we want to know what unlocks all of these Mysteries and all of that and then we ignore the so-called simple things but we can't even we can't understand those let me tell you the Seven Seals are very simple they're very easy to understand some of the things that Jesus said read Matthew Chapter 5 6 and 7 the Beatitudes those are those are meat those are very very deep teachings and you you look at these deep teachings and you say oh well well that's good well then why can nobody do them why are they so high and so difficult that no one can G and when Jesus is telling his disciples he said they've all longed all of these Great Men they've longed to hear me speak they've longed to see me and your eyes are blessed because you see me what do we look forward to the to the second coming why is that such a thing because at my eyes long to see him my ears long to hear him that's what I long for is to see this Jesus Christ the same one that truly the same one that calm the storm same one that called in the storm and diming New Mexico is the same one that called in the storm in the Sea of Galilee the same one who raised a man from the dead who had been dead for four days with Lazarus he was there they they called for him to come come your your friend is dying he's sick Mary and Martha's brother they said would you just come and would you would you pray for him if you if you'll come he won't die and then Jesus ignored them one day two days passed three days passed now Jesus said okay let's go see Lazarus the word comes back Lazarus is dead he says no well no actually the word comes the word comes back Jesus tells his disciples he says Lazarus is dead so they get so they get to the to the Grave Lazarus is always buried he'd be in the grave for four days you know what happens to a body after four days especially in the desert what it does and here's Jesus he says roll away the stone and he says Lazarus come forth and a man that was dead for 4 days came out of the Grave that man that's who I longed to see the same one who was on Mount Transfiguration with two of the greatest prophets that were ever that had ever lived they they go up to the mountain Jesus and his and Peter James and John and here come two men that had lived hundreds of years before two of the greatest prophets stand standing next to him Moses and Elijah Peter's like whoa those are two prophets he knew who they were he's like Lord let's build three Tabernacles here let's build build these three places of worship one for Moses one for Elijah and one for you and then God's voice rang out this is my beloved Son hear ye him the greatest one that had ever lived same one who said I the same one who preached to the these disciples he said something that no man could ever say from the time that that man was created till the time now he said I Lay My Life down we can all say that but then he said and I will raise it back up again none of us can do that none of us could even say that but Jesus could say that the same one who says who said before Abraham was I am he said you think you're sons of Abraham said before Abraham was I am who could say things like that who could say something like that and then God honor it the same one he said they they they were getting on Jesus for not for eating uh for picking Grain on the Sabbath he said listen he says I am the lord of the Sabbath who could write who could say such things as this man Jesus the Apostle Paul wrote this God who had Sund drry times and in diverse manners spake in times past by The Prophet by the prophets hath in these days spoken unto us by his son whom Heath appointed heir of all things and by whom also he made the worlds he's saying that yeah God spoke in the times past by the prophets but in this man this man that he's speaking through now that's how he made the stars in the sky that's how he made the the Earth that we stand in that's how he made the Sun and the Moon he made it through this man through his son by whom also he made the world who being in the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person so the express image if you look at Jesus Christ you see God the father and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins Christ when he wiped away our sins he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high who could say that we can't say that about anyone but this man Jesus Christ Arie when he was praying he said imagine we can talk to the Creator the same one I'm talking about right now now we can talk to him we can we can speak directly to him we can go into our closet we can go into the PRI in our private room and we can speak to this one that knows all things that has done all things and we can speak to him Revelation chapter 5 talked I mentioned the Seven Seals and how important how how these Seven Seals what what they mean but we don't want to just look at the seal it's what's behind the seal that matters the seal is just a a piece of wax that that closes the book and then it's sealed with Seven Seals so you have to break them to open the book but what's important is not the seal what's important is inside the book and that's how when John was there and he's seeing these Visions in the Book of Revelation and he looks and he sees that that book that was sealed with Seven Seals they said who is worthy to open this book in John through the power and the Revelation that he had he knew that his name was in that book there was Redemption inside of that book and if no one could open it then all was lost what would you do what would you do if someone said that this is the book of redemption and it's sealed and no one is worthy to open it what so everything that I've everything that I've lived for it's all lost we're all going to hell There's No Redemption and then the angel John just starts weeping the angel says John John John don't weep for the lion of the tribe of Judah he is worthy and John looked to see a lion and he sees a lamb a bloody lamb that was slain that was killed that was slain on the cross and John I guarantee you recognized who that was it was the one that taught him that said all men desire to see what you see all men want to hear what you what you hear and there is John he was there when Jesus said that and he knows that this man that's how important this great man was this Jesus we look at the Beatitudes we look at Matthew Chapter 5 this first big sermon that Jesus preached he's up on the hill and he preached this everything that he said was a masterpiece and he preaches these things that no one had heard I could spend my whole life preaching three times a week on just the Beatitudes I could do it and it would never get old I promise and that's how Jesus's words are they are so deep they are wonderful Matthew Chapter 5 he said um Jesus said You' have heard that it was said that you shall not commit adultery but I say to you that everyone who looks upon a woman with lustful intense has committed adultery with her in his heart if your right eye causes you to sin tear it out throw it away for it is better to you to lose one of your members and your then your whole body be thrown into hell if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away for it's better for you to lose one of your members than the whole body go to hell Jesus speaking he's saying this is how important it is he said that that you heard it said an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth but I say to you do not resist the one who is evil but if any man slaps you down on the right cheek Brother G If any man slaps you down on the right cheek turn to him in the other one also and if anyone would say to you and take would take your tunic and then give him your cloak as well and if anyone forces you to go a mile with him go two miles with him give to the one who begs from you and don't refuse one that would borrow from you so this man that forces you to go a mile with him it's not like hey he you want to go for a walk let's go for a mile okay I'll go go to with you no it's put you in handcuffs and say let's walk a mile let's go buddy not against your will and then you say okay because you have told me this I'm going to go too with you someone who takes my jacket okay you took my you stole it I'm gonna give you my tie too I'm gonna give you more than you steal from me who could say these things who could do these things but Jesus lived what he said you have heard that you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy but I say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he makes his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust if you love the ones who love you what reward do you have do not even the tax collectors do the same and if you greet only your brothers what only your brothers what more are you doing than others do not even the Gentiles do the same you therefore must be perfect as your heavenly father father is perfect we say well brother Daniel perfect is kind of a high a high level I didn't say it it's in red in the book Jesus he wasn't a hypocrite the things that he said is the life that he led he said love your enemy as I just read love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you not only did Jesus love his enemy and pray for those that persecute him his his virgin mother was accused of being an immoral woman who slept with the Roman soldier the ones that spit in his face these ones that are lying about his mom a perfect lady lying about his mother spitting in his face the ones that stripped him naked in front of everybody embarrassed him and nailed him to the Cross all right those these people those are the ones he prayed for he was up there on the cross dying and he says father forgive them the ones that did this to me the ones that said that about my mom the ones that nailed me to this cross forgive them Lord for they know not what they do John 15:13 Jesus says greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends he took it a step further and he laid down his life for his enemies that's this Jesus when I say when I hear crumbs you mean like the Beatitudes no if you could ask Jesus Christ now now that I've said that if you could ask the Lord Jesus one thing if if you had a moment if you could walk up to him and have one question and say Lord I just want to ask you this one thing think about it right now what would you ask what question would you want to answer would it be Lord would you tell me about the Seven Seals would you explain that I don't really understand that seventh one it's just silence in heaven would it be to reveal would you Lord would you tell me about the seven Thunders I don't understand that would it be Lord how if you just tell me how to move mountains you said that that if you just if you just speak it then that the that the father would take this mountain and then throw it in the Sea Lord if you would just show me how to move mountains would it be that if you had a chance just to ask him would it be tell us the meaning of life why are we here maybe why did I have a child that died why did these things happen to me in my life why do so many bad things happen to good people would you ask him that maybe would you ask him a question that would lead to the answer to all the other questions and would you ask him a question that would give you wisdom so that you might help others answer those questions you would have help others receive the answers to their difficult questions like that if you just had one question for the Lord Jesus what would it be think about it somebody was given that opportunity let's go back to Luke chapter 10 ver 25 a certain lawyer and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying here's the question master what shall I do to inherit eternal life this this wasn't a lawyer this man speaking he wasn't a lawyer like we think of a lawyer where you try a case in court he was a lawyer of the law he was a lawyer of Moses's writings it was his job to interpret this law so he was very well well learned he knew Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy he knew them very very well to where he could present a case maybe against someone or for someone he had the wrong attitude towards Jesus he was seeking out an argument because it says to tempt him he was putting Jesus most translations say he was putting Jesus to the test and here's a 30-year-old man this Jesus Christ and here's this lawyer this experienced lawyer Jesus had no formal education this guy had all the formal education that that you could have so he was looking to start a discussion with Jesus to tempt him but he asked the most perfect question that you could ever ask is Lord how can I receive eternal life because if I understand how then I can help others do the same then Jesus answered he knew who he was talking to he answered and he said what's written in the law how readest thou so he's saying what's written in the law Mr lawyer how do you read what's written in the law to answer this question that you asked Man shows he's Ed educated and he showed his shows his knowledge of the scriptures and and he answering said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all my thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself so he's quoting the Old Testament he's saying here's how you receive eternal life and he and Jesus said unto him you have answered right this do and you'll live so basically you already have the answer do it Amplified Bi Bible says do this habitually all the time and you'll live and then when the lawyer starts thinking about it when he starts thinking about wow all of these things I just read the Beatitudes and I said who does it and we think oh that's so simple yeah but love your love your neighbor as yourself oh well well what if he really meant something else because maybe my life doesn't match up with that and that's what this lawyer is saying he's saying love the Lord thy God with all thy heart okay I got that part but love your neighbor like what do you mean love your neighbor like the good neighbor or the Bad Neighbor I have two in my house you mean the one over here I got to love him like I love myself he starts thinking about his own life first John says if someone says I love God and hates his brother he is a liar for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he has not seen and this commandment we have from him that he who loves God must love his brother also so Jesus is looking at the man and he and Jesus may have paused for a second after he asked that question and he's saying so love your neighbor more than your love yourself and he starts maybe thinking so the guy who drive when when I'm emerging onto the highway so the guy who drives around me in the turning lane and gets in front of me and so I gotta love him I got to give him the lane I never do that I'm just bringing it down to reality that's what he's talking about when you take a group picture you know we all do we take a group picture and and we post it it's like man I look really fat my hair is all messed up and but boy Joseph's looking good you know what I'm gonna even though I look really bad I'm gonna post a picture because man Joseph looks really sharp sharp in that suit is that how we think but Jesus says that's how you have to think you got to pref prefer your neighbor so this lawyer is probably thinking about all these things man I posted that picture on Facebook and and I looked bad and and you know I looked really good and this other guy looked really bad and and my wife she didn't look so good but you know I looked good he's probably thinking about those things he's like man I'm not living up to this so he says but willing to justify himself verse 29 but willing to justify himself he said unto Jesus well who is my neighbor here's the place where people call themselves Christians and then they read the Beatitudes as I said the Deep part they read the Beatitudes and they see the selfless way of Jesus and they make excuses why they can hold a grudge against somebody they make excuses why they don't pray well I pray all the time it's just it's just not on my knees I have a relationship with God I just don't go to church but I'm a Christian what is church anyways really Define Church do I really have to go to church when you don't go to church not only does it remove that Dedication that you have in getting ready and getting the kids ready and going to church it not only does it remove that and that that that thing that you do at least once a week that you come in and you you get prayer and and you read your Bible and you get a and you get a sermon not only do does take does that take it out you can't watch YouTube and get it but it also when you don't come to church it takes you your gift that you're supposed to bring in it takes you out of the church so I'm not blessed by you being here we always think of ourselves but you if you don't come it takes you out so this lawyer instead of asking Jesus how do I do that how do I really love my neighbor as myself he seeks to justify himself and he says really who is my neighbor what he should have done is Lord how do I really do that and Jesus but he didn't ask that he was trying to chide and Jesus answering he says well who is my my neighbor and Jesus answering said a certain man he and he answered I love the way Jesus answers many many times and this is a learned professional lawyer that knows everything and Jesus says let me tell you a story and Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among Thieves which stripped him of his reignment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead now we are assuming this man is a Jew because it doesn't say that he's not a Jew when the Bible almost always when the Bible identifies someone as not being a Jew it tells us and otherwise we just assume that it is a Jew so we assume that this man is a Jew and he's going down this road from Jerusalem to Jericho which is between 15 and 20 miles and it's actually a very dangerous road where robbers would hang out and and wait for people either going up to Jerusalem to worship and to sacrifice or coming back they would wait wait on this Jericho Road and Rob those that may not be protected well so this man certain man went down from Jer from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among Thieves which stripped him of his reignment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed on the other side so he saw the guy laying on the road and he didn't want to deal with it he sees him over here he says uh I'm I'm going to go over here this is a person of his own race a Jew and here goes the preacher and he's like you know I just don't want to deal with it today I'm gonna walk over on this side and likewise a levite now a priest is a levite but not all Levites are priests but the levite probably did work in the temple probably did work in the church and and help and and do religious things and likewise a levite when he was at that place he came and he looked on him and he passed by on the other side both of these Jews ignored the problem that was passing over there this half dead Jew on their own race and there was definitely racism back then don't forget they were very much separated and these two Jews saw one of their own laying there and they didn't help there's a story about this man named Martin of Tours he was born in 316 ad long time ago he joined the military as a young man and it was a cold winter day and Martin is there on his horse and he see looks down and he sees this beggar there half dressed dress didn't have clothes and he was shivering Martin looks down on him and he had compassion on him so Martin takes his big heavy coat and he cuts it in half and he with his with his sword and he takes his coat and he wraps the poor beggar in his coat and he takes his piece of his coat and he wraps himself with it and he says now we can both survive the night that night Martin goes to bed and he has a vision and there is the Lord Jesus came to Martin and there he is wrapped in Martin's coat and he says what you have done Martin what you have done for the least of these you have done it to me an experience LED Martin to give his heart to the Lord he got baptized quit the military and dedicated his life to serving others this man Martin brother brandham said I don't believe there was a greater man ever on the earth outside of Jesus Christ than St Martin it's pretty high compliment I'm a very important person why because Martin was one of the few people who actually put Christianity into action and it wasn't a great miracle that Martin performed he just made a sacrifice verse number 33 but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him he had compassion on this man that was there laying there half dead Samaritans and Jews didn't mix they a Jew would call a Samaritan an unclean person Samaritan would call a Jew the same thing and he went to him and he bound up his wounds pouring oil and wine pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him into the end and took care of him and on the tomorrow when he departed he took two pence and gave it to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest when I come again I will repay you he took the wine and poured it on his wounds the antiseptic and the alcohol the wine to clean the wounds so they wouldn't get in infected he took the oil and he rubbed it on there to maybe maybe soothe the pain sister Lonnie is probably like a modern day an oldfashioned meal boring where it had an antiseptic property and and it it soothed the pain and he and he helped him not only did he help the man's wounds but he also paid the money to give him proper care now I want to note that this Jew wasn't homeless he wasn't a drug addict he didn't squander his money he wasn't a person that who helping would just make him go to the nearest drug deal or a dispensary or liquor liquor store this man was attacked he was left for dead and he would have died if no one helped him so what possessed the Samaritan to do that for a complete stranger remember the question Jesus is telling the whole story he's saying the whole question was what do I need to do to get eternal life and Jesus tells the story of the Good Samaritan brother Ron told me brother Ron glidewell I don't know if he's here there he is um he told me a story last night um by the way I was very proud of our church yesterday we were there with um brother uh um we were there at uh the hospital last night uh for Brother Dan Brother Dan was was very sick he's he's dying in the hospital and we went to visit him and the family many of you know brother Dan Roberts and family they they used to come here and um he passed away this morning um early this morning and but I was I was very proud of our family I mean our church family every one of our deacons were there these were not members of our church the the Roberts family we love them dearly but they're not the ones that we see every every time we come they're not the ones that we are just a second brother John they are not the ones that we um serve normally but everyone of our deacons was there every one of us every brother Aaron Brother Lyle brother Jordan serving think about this Good Samaritan brother uh but they were there as wonderful it was it was a very very sweet thing take looking after this man and his family and the same very same spirit that is when the the Good Samaritan and and to help and it was just it was beautiful I was I was very very proud and brother brother Ron was telling me the story about he was when he was um he was driving and he uh he drove a truck and he looked in his rearview mirror and he sees a car go over the guard rail and down into a ravine brother Ron Slams on his brakes he gets out he runs down to to help this person and he um he uh goes down there and he gets he gets into the car and and the lady has a cut artery in her leg brother Ron puts his hand in pressure over the artery trying to trying to stop the bleeding and and comforting her and she asked brother Ron she says am I going to die and brother Ron says no he says I'm here everything's going to be okay and he end up saving the lady a Good Samaritan taking his time he could have just kept going and that's what the world teaches us today just keep going just keep running just keep moving keep doing yourself keep serving yourself keep keep keep don't worry about anybody else and the the world teaches us that don't put your don't put your neck on the line because you could get sued don't put your neck on the line because you could get hurt they teach most people in in the um in the in the hospitals or wherever they are don't don't fight just run away don't care about somebody else if somebody else is getting hurt just run and get away save yourself and that's what the world teaches us today there's no courage there's no love for someone else what about the pastors that walk on the other side of the road and and provide no correction to the church they just feel maybe preach it maybe a feel-good service you know you're fine because you're a Believer you're fine because of the way you dress you're fine because of where you go to church you're fine because God knows God knows you and that Pastor just let me walk on the other side of the road and you see the people that they're not where they should be don't worry about living in sin don't worry about gossiping don't worry about being a part of a part of a church you're a good person don't worry about cussing don't worry about lying don't worry about immorality don't worry about paying ties oh that's just Old Testament don't worry about not giving your time to serve others if you have a relationship with God don't worry about those things I'll just walk on the other side of the road and it is offensive many times the gospel is let me as a pastor walk on the other side of the road let me as a levite walk on the other side of the road let me as a parent walk on the other side of the road let me as a friend walk on the other side of the road let me as a Christian walk on the other side of the road back to verse 36 six which now of these thing of which now of these three thinkest thou was na was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said well the one that showed Mercy on him and Jesus said unto him go and do thou likewise remember the lawyer's origin his original question was how can I receive eternal life the answer from God in flesh was a simple story and an ended which which one of these three three people the priest the levite and the Samaritan which one was a neighbor to the Jew on the road and he answered he that showed mercy and Jesus said now you go and you do the same that's the simpleness the Simplicity of God the Simplicity of the Gospel we want to go really deep we want to really understand understand all of these things but if we would just understand what Jesus taught and the love that he showed then we'll get there and not only will we get there we will bring other people with us the musicians can come and we'll close we don't predict the outcomes of our Good Deeds but we look at the task at hand hand and we do the task because it helps someone brother Josiah when he prayed for this man he prayed in private and didn't tell anyone and then God answered the prayer when brother Ed when he prayed God answered his prayer and everybody in I 10 benefited and nothing comes without a sacrifice nothing good comes it takes our time it takes our love it takes whatever we can do it takes that to truly do something you know brother and sisters when we when it comes to this Good Samaritan we look at this story read it read why Jesus said the the the man came to Jesus and he's like hey he says and he's he's he's tempting him and he wants to get in this argument and he wants to maybe get in a theological argument or he he asks this leading question and he says well what do I have to do to inherit eternal life and that's the greatest question that anyone can have we should get on our knees and say Lord what do I need to do to inherit eternal life I want to be there on that day I want my family to be there I want my friends to be there what do I need to do so then I could help them that's the most important question and it's not meant to be a religious the theological discussion as so many times it happens and that's what this man wanted he wanted this Theology and he missed the whole thing I talked about the Seven Seals the Seven Seals inside the Seven Seals is what matters the book of redemption I want to be there I want those seals those seals are broken by the Lamb of God and there I am in that book praise God for that and we talk about this story of this Good Samaritan Jesus said this is eternal life who was who was the good who is the neighbor to this man who was the neighbor that's one what that received eternal life wasn't even a if we were all Jews je in here it wasn't even a believer we would call but it was the one that really did it it was the one that really acted on what Jesus said Amen Brother John I believe you acted on what Jesus said I believe you acted and what God laid on your heart and you did it at the perfect time you had no idea that brother Dan was going to pass away do you see how God laid it on our brother's heart to do this and now we all benefit and the family benefits from the leading of the Lord on one person one Good Samaritan brother just ah Amazing [Music] Grace How Sweet the Sound that sa a rich like me I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I was Grace [Music] that My Heart To
