mentioned it to the Musicians there's been a uh on Sunday night and Wednesday I don't know if I'm sure you've noticed it but the Lord has really been his Spirit has been present and it's just been wonderful I mean it was with brother Lyle brother Lyall was was ministering on Wednesday and I just I felt this anointing on him and and with our worship service last Sunday I mean we did pray for a long time and then and then we come and then the the beautiful worship after service on Sunday night I I've just been so blessed and I I really I expect the same tonight I always expect the Lord Lord to do something and and he always does it may not be what I expect but but he does always do something so I I do have I have high expectations for tonight a very short sermon I want to finish James chapter 3 um really James talks about he differ differentiates between the wisdom of God um Godly wisdom and Earthly WIS wisdom which is the wisdom of man and he calls this wisdom of man he calls it devilish and and sensual and this Godly wisdom is is what we're striving for before we get to our scripture I want to give a couple examples of Godly wisdom and Earthly wisdom and these for were from two brothers in the Bible they're half Brothers um one is David both of them their fathers was King David and that is is this young man Solomon Solomon sought for Godly wisdom and the other is this young man named absolum um Solomon David had passed away and he left the kingdom to uh to Solomon his son and Solomon did everything that he knew how to to do things right and do things according to God's word and he couldn't offer off sacrifice in the temple which is what God wanted because there was no Temple yet so what they did what Solomon did is is he brought his sacrifice to what we see in the Bible that's called the high places now we know from reading our Bibles that these high places are generally where idolatry took place and where um they sacrific things to Idols but this young man Solomon he really he wanted to do things right and he thought well the best way that I can do right is I can go to this high place which seems to me the most spiritual place that I know of and we can make our sacrifice there Solomon his young heart was right and what he did is he brought he went to this place and not only did he want to go to a high place he wanted to go to the highest place he wanted to go to the most spiritual place that he could find to offer this sacrifice and I believe it was a thousand animals that he was going to sacrifice so he goes he goes up to do this sacrifice and he sacrifices all all of these animals according to what he believed was the word of God and as I said Solomon's heart was right in all of this I look back at Stephanie and I and raising our children and I was a pretty hard I guess today I would call call it legalistic Dad and I uh we had the the thing that we always had in a bond in our family is we always had such love and we would we would spend each evening together and and uh just talk about things and we would have our Bible studies and we would have our devotions and and the kids would would play their instruments Daniel would play his guitar and meline would play either the piano or mandolin and they'd fight and i' I'd get on them you know it's like kids we're playing chrisan music don't be fighting daddy he's doing it wrong it's supposed to be Daddy She's Doing It Wrong supposed to be in this key and that key boy they would fight I just I would I'd always it would get so bad and they start playing really loud and and and going back and forth and I just start singing peace peace wonderful peace and they just they settle down and it would bring a calmness but we had that love as a family and I look back and on the way to church this morning my wife and I were talking and and we would probably do things differently than we did before and Stephanie said this she said but our heart was right and we did I mean I was I mean there was no TV in my house there were no movies there was no I mean there was there was Bible movies and there was there was no Halloween there was no Sports there was no other youth camps except for our sect um of the message that we were part of there was no other churches there were no other kids no other friends outside of our little group and we were doing the best there wasn't even neighbor kids the kids weren't even allowed to hang out with the neighbor kids we protected them as much as we could and if I had it to do all over I would probably do it different I might send them to more youth camps I might be um a little bit more easygoing because when the kids hit the place of um when they got old enough and they started doing the teenager thing they strayed just like any other kids and I remember it was a a roote Awakening for Stephanie and me and we were just like what did we do wrong we tried to do everything just perfectly we tried to follow every single rule we tried to do everything according to what we thought was right and yet we failed but God who is rich in mercy God saw the hearts of these young parents and he made a way and I I was just sitting in the back and tell I just broke down crying to see to see my son up here leading song serving the lord my daughter serving the lord back in Jeffersonville and I I'm just I'm so I'm I'm grateful really beyond words that even though I'm a failure and even though I'm completely inadequate to really do anything in this world God sees my heart and he he says I'll take care of you maybe like Peter Satan has sought to sift you like wheat but I prayed for you I've got control of it I saw your heart you wanted to do things right and he made a way and it's the same with this Young Solomon he he did the best that he could we um sister hope also comes from uh same place I there there's certain things that that in my past and and certain people that that I harbored some resentment for and lately it's been really strong in the people that have been attacking uh brother Brandon and I'll tell you I don't read a lot of quotes I don't go the message way but I have a fierce loyalty to that man and it's because he pointed me to a living Jesus Christ and and since I was a little boy since I since I can remember I'm talking barely able to walk that voice on those tapes has given me strength and it's it's brought me through it didn't teach me wrong it didn't it didn't send me in the wrong direction it didn't it didn't teach a self-righteous Holiness it didn't do any of that it gave me strength and it gave me Faith and it showed me that these things that that that you need that you pray for you can have those things and there are there is a miraculous there is a supernatural and it's there just to if you would just receive it those things gave me strength and and though I did I went too far I got I I went into a a a sectarian or denominational way of thinking and I fully admit it I I did wrong but my heart was right and and now I I I can see that Lord you brought me through and you've matured me into a man and now I would have never thought thought that I would be the pastor of a church and now that same anger comes up in me and say how dare you say these things that you're saying about that man and I want to go on the offensive and if that's what I was talking about this morning don't go on the offensive no matter how bad you think that person is and even even like Michael the Archangel disputing with Satan and even he didn't bring a railing accusation against him so who am I to bring an accusation against anyone I I feel very confident in playing defense but not going after someone and I thank God that that he's never haven't fallen and gone on the offensive in the past couple years and he's just it's he he's spared me and and now I see I'm grateful Lord thank you and I don't ever want to go there and this man Solomon this young man he went up not to the high place but he went up to the highest of the high places this place called giba and he was going to and he offered these a thousand um sacrifices to the Lord and he wanted wanted to please the Lord and the Lord saw Solomon's heart even though Solomon was doing something that probably wasn't right for him to do but he did it in the right Spirit Solomon's heart was right so Solomon goes up to giba and I'm sorry I uh I'm just I didn't I didn't really prepare for this but if you could go to First Kings chapter 3 and this is Solomon after he had made these sacrifices in this place that was normally reserved for sacrificing Idols but he was doing his best because he did not have this Temple to make this sacrifice yet First Kings CH 3:5 it says this in gibian yes the Lord appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night and God said ask what I shall give thee and Solomon said thou Hast showed unto thy servant David my father great Mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou has kept for him this great kindness that thou Hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day he's talking about himself it's like Lord you blessed my dad and you gave my dad me to be able to sit on my father's throne and I know it made my dad so proud and now oh Lord my God thou Hast made thy servant King instead of David my father after David and I am but a little child and I know not how to go out or come in look at look at the sweetness of Solomon he's like Lord I'm doing my best and God honors it brothers and sisters when we do our best God will honor it that's wisdom you put it before God you do your best you try and more often than not you're going to make a mistake but God will take your mistake and he will make you a better person for it and thy servant and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou H has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for the multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this so great a people and the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon had as that had asked this thing and God said to him because thou Hast asked this thing and Hast not asked for thyself a long life neither hast thou asked riches for th thyself nor hast thou nor Hast asked the life of thine enemies but H has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment behold I have done according to thy words lo I have given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there is none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee so he's saying Solomon your heart was right I said I'm going to give you anything anything that you want Solomon you just ask imagine if any of us were in that situation and we were praying and God came down and said I'm going to give you anything you just say to me what you want and Solomon and the wisdom I believe was already in him he said Lord give me wisdom that I can judge your people that I can lead your people because it wasn't about Solomon it was about the people that he was leading stark contrast to his brother who I I'll speak about in a minute verse number 12 behold I've have done according to thy words lo I have given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there is none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee and I have also given thee that which thou Hast not asked look at God he is going to he he never underd delivers I have given you something you didn't ask for fact more a lot of things you didn't ask for both riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the Kings like unto thee all thy days and if thou wil walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my Commandments as thy father David did walk then I I will lengthen thy days so here's this young man Solomon and and he goes up with a pure heart maybe doing the wrong thing but God saw that wonderfully Pure Heart pure motives in that young man and he answered and he gave him the desire of his heart which was for others now we have Solomon brother maybe 13 14 years before he wanted wisdom also but he wanted wisdom for Earthly for worldly things he wanted riches he wanted power he was the best looking of David's Sons he was the most popular he was the most well spoken and he had this great ambition I want the Kingdom my older brother I'm far I'm far better than him I'm far more capable than him so David catches wind of this they have an argument they they have problems over the years Solomon's Solomon's cut out I mean sorry absolum is cut out and then absolum comes back in and he starts waiting by the gate into the into the City and here's ABS he's the King's son great power great Authority just being David's son so he's there and there were disputes and David may have been busy and and maybe his judges were busy and solom or um absolum says I'll judge these disputes for you and he had great wisdom in judging these things and the reason that absum wanted to judge was so that he could lift himself up more and more he gained the Bible says he gained the heart of the people and it was for absolum it was not for the kingdom it was not for his father David it was not out of respect for him it was for his own Earthly selfish Ambitions and look at the difference one was an incredibly well-spoken man born with many gifts and he put himself out out there to take over the kingdom to gain more power and more power and more power and here comes his brother the the the chosen King and he said Lord give me wisdom so I can help your people look at the two differences and that's what this ending of this James chapter 3 is talking about it's talking about two different wisdoms two different desires James chapter 3 well we ended with verse 12 let's start with verse 13 James says this who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom he's going to talk about two different kinds of wisdoms here you have the Earthly wisdom and you have the Heavenly wisdom but if you have bitter envying and Str life in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descends not from above remember absum he was willing to lie he was willing to cheat and he was successful at doing it and so often we see people that it's like wow this person really has a gift and they're very good at moving up the ranks and they move up the ranks because they are thinking about themselves and they do well in the world today but that is Earthly wisdom but you have in but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descends not from above but is Earthly sensual that sensual doesn't mean like what we think it means it's unspiritual natural this wisdom that you desire is a natural wisdom like Absalon sought after Earthly sensual devilish demonic for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work so the first part he's describing Earthly wisdom and this wisdom comes from the world absolum thought he was wise and he was wise and he sat outside the gate judging the people for himself and he judged them rightly and he had great wisdom and the people were like wow man this guy's really good he can judge he has he we need to promote him to King because he has reached out to us and abson would say come here come here and he showed him such love he' give him a kiss we're buddies person after person winning the heart of the people but doing it deceptively Isaiah 5 you can keep it on James but Isaiah 5:21 says this woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight James chapter chapter 1 verse 5 says this if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and abrath not and it shall be given him so here he is we see Solomon now he's asking for wisdom and he's asking for it this is the Heavenly wisdom that was given to Solomon and he's asking this and and saying Lord help me and this is James saying ask for this wisdom but you got to ask for the right reason verse number six but let him ask in faith not wavering how could I ask for wisdom in faith if I was asking for wisdom for my own benefit I can't I can't but let him ask in faith not wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed so if you are asking for wisdom and you're asking for it wrong you're going to be tossed to and fro you're going to be you're going to make this decision or that decision because all of your decisions are you're making this decision on what benefits me and it causes confusion and it really it'll cause failure verse number 17 in James 3 but the wisdom that is from above is Fier is first pure then Peaceable and gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and of good fruits without partiality and without hypocracy the musicians can come and we close think about how David it's full of Mercy think about how David was when when he was out in the in the fields out in the in the rocks and and and Saul was seeking him to to find him and to kill him and here David Saul comes into this cave and David has the opportunity to kill him right here and his main man says I'll do it let's kill we have the chance right here you can kill this King and then you can take the kingdom David David had mercy he could have done it right there he could have killed his adversary and taken the kingdom but he had mercy and then it happened again there is Saul asleep with his men David sneaks in he cut off his the skirt of His Garment before he sneaks in and takes his weapon on the next one could have killed him again right there but wisdom is Peaceable and gentle easy to be in treated full of mercy and of good friends of good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy how beautiful and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace Jesus said blessed are the peacemakers and I believe that closes Chapter 3 of James I tell you in studying this James chapter 3 has made me examine myself say Lord where am I in your word am I like this young man Solomon or I just Lord I just want wisdom I want to be able to take care of my family I want to be able to take care of my church I want to be able to help them and then the people that come against me Lord I want to have peace with them the people that come [Music] against our church people that come against the people in our church and I'll tell you what you can come against me but you come against these people man I want to pull my sword and start swinging we can't do that either we have to live Peaceable with with those people we have to forgive and we cannot bring a railing accusation against anyone and then this wisdom and you notice how wisdom Falls right after this patience that that James talks about Falls right after that let me just read the whole thing again verse number 13 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but if you have a but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descends not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work wow for where there is envying and strife where there's fighting and when when there is Envy Envy is is different than jealousy jealousy caused Cain to kill his brother Abel but envying is coveting you want something someone else has while jealousy you hate that person and where there is envy and strife there is confusion and every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy oh I love that and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace oh don't you love the word of God oh it's so just I love reading and I say Lord I would like to just open it just step right in and just look around and say oh God I just love I love your word so much do you love the [Music] word all throughout my history faithfulness has walked beside me the winter storms Make Way
