[11:56] story this is my

[12:05] saor all the day
[12:11] long brother Jeremy Titus the book
[12:15] Titus chap 2: 11 and
[12:18] 12 it was my scripture of the day read
[12:23] it this morning and I was reading it
[12:24] again this this afternoon or evening
[12:27] before we stepped in and
[12:29] look what Paul says here and what we're
[12:32] going to be hearing in the book of of
[12:33] Judges here for the grace of God that
[12:36] bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
[12:39] men teaching us that denying ungodliness
[12:43] and worldly lust we should live soberly
[12:46] righteously and godly in this present
[12:50] world I was reading through the first
[12:53] few chapters of the Book of Judges again
[12:56] and and God you know with Moses is with
[12:59] them and all you know they're serving
[13:01] the lord they have a someone to kind of
[13:04] look to and and and and follow his
[13:08] footsteps but after Moses passes away
[13:10] and we begin to see how they turn their
[13:12] back on God and God says because you've
[13:16] done that he says now I'm going to give
[13:18] you over to them and then they would
[13:20] come back running to God and say we did
[13:22] wrong and his great mercy and his grace
[13:25] reached out to them and then they would
[13:27] turn his back on him and they would run
[13:29] but Paul tells us deny those things and
[13:32] live Godly you know and let Christ live
[13:35] in you and I I just thought that was a
[13:37] good scripture to go with with what
[13:39] we'll be hearing today so we do have
[13:42] some requests I'm going to ask brother
[13:44] Ed if he'll he'll come up in and open in
[13:49] prayer and take the
[13:54] request brother Ed says that their son
[13:57] Nate Cen has an urgent
[13:59] unspoken request for a young man so Lord
[14:03] knows who that
[14:05] is and then sister Martha said prayer
[14:09] for Dan Miller a friend from rapidly
[14:12] spreading cancer so Lord knows who this
[14:16] is Sister Mercy somano had mentioned to
[14:19] my wife that that she's been having a
[14:21] lot of pain in her arm so we'll
[14:25] remember remember her also and continue
[14:27] to remember Sister Sarah codner as she
[14:30] was had gone in possibly think she might
[14:34] have pneumonia but they found strep if I
[14:36] understand and they're still waiting on
[14:38] some results from the test so let's
[14:42] believe if you'll stand with me and
[14:43] brother Ed if you'll open in prayer and
[14:45] take these
[14:47] requests and it's it's good to have
[14:49] brother Ed here on a Wednesday night in
[14:50] case you know this is the same brother
[14:52] Ed that's here on Sunday morning work is
[14:55] done for a while so he gets to stay
[14:57] home I'm blessed to be able to be back
[15:01] home and be here at church so let's
[15:06] pray gracious Heavenly
[15:08] Father our hearts Rejoice just to be
[15:11] able to be here father this evening Lord
[15:14] we're few but that doesn't make a
[15:16] difference to you for your word says
[15:19] where two or three are
[15:20] gathered in your name that you would be
[15:23] among
[15:24] us so father would you come and just
[15:29] walk up and down the aisles
[15:32] and be with us
[15:34] and just let your spirit be made known
[15:37] once
[15:37] again these requests that have been
[15:41] read father you know the needs some are
[15:44] serious they're all serious Lord
[15:47] really but Lord there's nothing that's
[15:49] impossible for you would you reached
[15:53] down and handled each need each request
[15:56] father would you
[16:00] just move upon these requests and Lord
[16:04] we give you thanks in
[16:06] advance for the positive outcome so we
[16:09] commit them into your hands and Commit
[16:12] This service bless our brother
[16:14] Dan move them out of the way anoint them
[16:17] use them to speak to us Lord in Jesus
[16:19] Christ's name
[16:21] [Music]

[16:29] and work has been a little bit slow I
[16:31] just share a little testimony prayer
[16:35] works it's been a little slow it's a
[16:37] slow Time of the Season and and if
[16:40] you've seen the economy change and so

[16:43] wife as I left this morning at work I
[16:45] said just got very little work and she
[16:48] says well I'll pray that the Lord give
[16:50] you work so what was going to be 2 hours
[16:53] turned into 6
[16:55] hours and so the Lord still answers
[16:58] prayer

[36:09] off and brother Aaron it's also good to
[36:12] thank the Lord for when he gives us work
[36:13] you know we take it for granted and we
[36:16] should always give the Lord thanks for
[36:19] what he does for us a good job is
[36:21] something that is is precious and I I
[36:25] appreciate that brother Aon I appreciate
[36:26] given

[36:38] mouths um for the Book of
[36:41] Judges I I won't get through it today
[36:44] I'll get through the the first part of
[36:46] it and then uh we will um pick it up on
[36:51] um on the next Bible study that we have
[36:53] in the coming weeks sister Bonnie
[36:55] Marriott as I was leaving church on
[36:58] Sunday I don't know if she knew she they
[37:01] don't come usually on Wednesday night
[37:04] but I don't know if she knew that judges
[37:07] was going to be my sermon on
[37:09] Wednesday but as I was leaving church or
[37:14] as she was leaving at church church on
[37:15] Sunday
[37:16] morning I shook her
[37:19] hand and she grabbed my hand and and she
[37:24] pulled it to me and she
[37:27] said these words something on the order
[37:30] of I think this whole thing has become
[37:33] the Book of
[37:35] Judges and I knew what she meant and she
[37:38] was talking about how that we just fall
[37:42] into sin so
[37:45] easily and I think about this Book of
[37:47] Judges and boy it's a depressing book
[37:50] and it's been bothering me all week last
[37:52] night I woke up and I was repenting I
[37:55] was just feeling bad for everything that
[37:58] Israel had done in this book and and all
[38:01] the mistakes that they had made and just
[38:03] setting the Lord
[38:05] aside and I was as I was laying in bed
[38:08] this morning I was thinking about all
[38:09] the failures of Israel and then the
[38:11] thought came to my mind that how
[38:15] similar we
[38:17] are to these Israelites and what
[38:20] happened to them you know of all the
[38:23] books in the Old Testament I think the
[38:28] Book of
[38:29] Judges is the most
[38:33] applicable to not only our society that
[38:37] we live in but
[38:39] also in in the churches and the in the
[38:42] circles that we Fellowship in I look at
[38:46] look at how things have gone and and
[38:49] This Book of Judges it's just this
[38:51] continuing cycle of of the people a a
[38:54] man of God will come in and then God
[38:57] will bless Israel because the people
[38:59] will serve the Lord and then that man of
[39:01] God will be taken off the scene and then
[39:04] the people fall into sin and they do
[39:07] exactly what that man of God taught
[39:10] against and then they'll get themselves
[39:12] into this big mess and then they'll cry
[39:15] out to the Lord and then the Lord will
[39:16] send them another servant of the Lord
[39:20] and then they'll start living better and
[39:22] just over and over and over again and I
[39:26] I was laying in bed this morning I was
[39:27] thinking Lord how much have we done that
[39:32] how much has has the people that claim
[39:34] to believe that this man came back in
[39:38] the 1950s and 60s a great man by the
[39:43] name of William brandom and changed just
[39:46] changed really the whole religious
[39:49] landscape changed the world brought a
[39:52] message that people could see that God
[39:55] was alive
[39:57] alive and God he he was actually was a
[40:00] living breathing God that did things and
[40:03] wasn't a god of 2,000 years ago and how
[40:07] people would come through the prayer
[40:08] lines and and they would be healed and
[40:10] probably all of us know or have met
[40:13] people that have been
[40:14] healed and then God sends this man and
[40:18] he has a message behind it and that
[40:22] message friends I say it a lot but that
[40:26] message is not what we hear today in our
[40:31] churches it makes it just Grieves me so
[40:35] much and in reading this This Book of
[40:37] Judges I think Lord that's us we have
[40:41] fallen right back into the sin that this
[40:44] man tried to pull us out
[40:46] of and when I say the
[40:50] sin what did brother brandom preach
[40:54] almost every sermon that he
[40:58] preached the Lord Jesus and come out of
[41:03] those
[41:04] denominations we just listen to a
[41:06] Christmas message and he preached about
[41:09] denominations he preached against the
[41:12] sectarian form of worship where we draw
[41:15] a circle around ourselves and we say
[41:17] that we are better than someone
[41:20] else and brother brandham came and he
[41:22] hit that
[41:23] thing and he said this is false Doctrine
[41:26] come out of the Methodist and come out
[41:28] of the Baptist and come out of these
[41:30] things and he also said that there are
[41:32] three kinds of Believers in every in
[41:34] every Church saying very much that these
[41:37] methodists and Baptists and all and and
[41:39] all of these denominates they are
[41:41] believers there we ignore that part of
[41:44] what he said and we separate ourselves
[41:47] and draw a circle and I see that brother
[41:51] brandham hid it and then when he passed
[41:53] away what did we
[41:55] do we did exactly what he taught us
[41:59] against we formed this denomination or
[42:03] this
[42:04] cult called the
[42:07] message he did not preach that his
[42:11] message was Jesus Christ and him
[42:14] crucified and his message was come out
[42:17] of that he even called it the mark of
[42:21] the
[42:22] beast
[42:23] why why would he hit that so hard and
[42:27] and make a statement so strong as that
[42:31] it's because the people are believing
[42:33] because they're part of a religious
[42:36] system or they are part of a church or a
[42:41] part of the Catholic denomination the
[42:44] the Methodist or the Baptist or the
[42:46] message or whatever it is they think
[42:48] that that's going to save them they
[42:50] think that they're going to get to
[42:52] heaven because of
[42:54] this and it dest destroys the word of
[42:57] God and it destroys Jesus Christ in the
[43:01] person and what they do is they don't
[43:03] seek the Holy Spirit what they do is
[43:06] they seek a
[43:08] church and then they lift up this man of
[43:10] God whether it be Joshua Moses one of
[43:15] the judges they lift up this man of God
[43:18] as their
[43:19] champion and it makes it to where they
[43:21] don't have to receive this Holy Spirit
[43:24] and then the churches the min
[43:27] history lifts it up so much and says how
[43:30] great we
[43:32] are and doesn't push saying that you
[43:36] must receive the holy spirit that you
[43:39] must have that personal relationship
[43:40] with Christ that you must know him let
[43:43] me tell you if we don't know him I'm
[43:47] talking about me if I don't know Jesus
[43:49] Christ William brandom was a failure in
[43:50] my life because I can't get on I can't
[43:54] get into heaven on him or his message
[43:56] I have to get into heaven on a Jesus
[43:59] Christ and him crucified and that I know
[44:02] him and that I have received his Spirit
[44:03] into my life and it makes me friends it
[44:06] makes me so it just it's just got me so
[44:11] upset thinking that we have created as I
[44:14] said on Sunday we have created this
[44:16] image of what we think God should
[44:19] be and then this is how we're going to
[44:21] get saved and this is how our church
[44:23] should be and it's false it's in our
[44:25] minds
[44:28] and we have done exactly what I'm going
[44:31] to read about in This Book of
[44:34] Judges so as I'm reading this this
[44:37] isn't this
[44:39] isn't 3,000 years
[44:42] ago this is true today and I really
[44:45] believe more than any other book in the
[44:47] New Testament the Book of Judges The
[44:49] Book of Malachi is very similar too but
[44:51] the Book of
[44:53] Judges and how we immediately
[44:57] leave the gospel when that man leaves
[45:00] and we fall right back into idolatry or
[45:04] right back into denominations or right
[45:07] back into what it
[45:09] is exactly what he said to come out
[45:13] of I was was thinking about that today
[45:17] and I'm I'm studying and it's getting me
[45:19] all worked up and and there I am in my
[45:21] chair and and praying like Lord and then
[45:23] I start I get a text from somebody I
[45:26] haven't talked to in a year or
[45:30] two and he tells me he says brother he
[45:32] says uh I just wanted to say Happy New
[45:35] Year
[45:38] um yeah I got kicked out of my
[45:42] church Message
[45:44] Church
[45:46] Minister because he was
[45:50] preaching that no we don't we have to we
[45:53] have to have Jesus Christ and being the
[45:57] bride or whatever it
[45:59] is is not because of a
[46:02] man it's because of Christ and he
[46:06] started he was teaching almost the a
[46:09] very similar thing saying that these
[46:11] Pharisees and Sadducees had an image in
[46:13] their in their minds of how a a Believer
[46:16] should
[46:18] be and that's exactly what so-called
[46:21] message churches do today is they have
[46:24] this image and it's all about the man
[46:27] and not about
[46:30] Jesus and they said basically you can't
[46:32] preach it here
[46:34] anymore and that's what we've
[46:36] become we've become exactly what brother
[46:39] brandom said come out of
[46:42] that makes me it breaks it breaks my
[46:45] heart that people get so caught up they
[46:49] W even friends they wouldn't even go to
[46:51] church going to church is wrong remember
[46:53] I talked about the Sadducees thank God
[46:55] again that we went through the book of
[46:58] Acts the
[47:01] Sadducees right there they were too good
[47:05] they wouldn't even believe any of the
[47:06] other prophets they only had one Prophet
[47:09] his name was
[47:10] Moses that arrogant spirit and
[47:16] sinful
[47:17] people sinful I'm I'm not talking
[47:20] about drinking and smoking on the
[47:23] weekends which is sinful talking about
[47:26] worse than that I'm talking about
[47:28] self-righteous judgmental egotistical
[47:32] rotten
[47:35] Sinners we think we always think of a
[47:38] sinner we think of
[47:40] the the prostitute walking down the
[47:43] street or the homeless guy sitting on
[47:46] the
[47:47] corner smoking meth or whatever he's
[47:49] doing who is the worst center is it him
[47:52] or is it the sadducee they're both dirty
[47:55] in the sight of the Lord but one is
[47:57] willing to repent the other one's
[48:00] not I was thinking about
[48:03] that and I was thinking about all these
[48:06] different groups that we've gone into
[48:08] and how we draw our circles and we cut
[48:10] everybody else out oh but we draw our
[48:12] Circle bigger no we don't that is so
[48:15] ridiculous people that would say that we
[48:17] really don't we will draw our circle
[48:20] around somebody that believes at least
[48:22] mostly like me but somebody that doesn't
[48:25] man we'll cut them out Jesus or no Jesus
[48:28] it's sad but it's the truth it should be
[48:30] Jesus Christ and him alone and that is
[48:33] what brother Brandon preached the other
[48:35] day I was talking to somebody we were
[48:37] going through the the table the message
[48:38] search program I said do this I said go
[48:41] in there pick any tape any date any page
[48:45] any paragraph and what's it going to be
[48:47] talking about so we did it we did it
[48:49] like 10 times almost every time he was
[48:51] talking about the Lord
[48:53] Jesus try it it's awesome that was his
[48:59] everything but instead we go
[49:02] off and we don't listen to what he said
[49:05] I was thinking about that today and I
[49:07] was I was texting back and forth from
[49:10] this with his brother and I was uh
[49:12] updating the website and uh working on
[49:15] on YouTube and putting some links in
[49:16] there and uh a sermon popped up of uh
[49:22] brother Perry
[49:24] green and uh looked at it and uh I was
[49:29] like I wonder so I I scrubbed
[49:32] forward and I turned it on there's
[49:34] brother green talking about all the
[49:37] different denominations within the
[49:39] message and he was talking about the
[49:41] seven Thunders and he says they don't
[49:44] know if that's been revealed or
[49:47] not he was talking about the same thing
[49:50] like hey they're just this is just a
[49:52] division between all of us
[49:57] I
[49:59] uh let me let me read to you a quote
[50:02] from brother
[50:03] brandom and he's talking about I think
[50:05] he's talking about Gideon one of the
[50:07] judges brother BR preached this sermon
[50:09] if God be with us then where all the
[50:11] Miracles and it's about Gideon that's
[50:13] what Gideon said Gideon's like if God be
[50:16] with us and he saw all the sin in Israel
[50:19] and everybody's talking about how great
[50:20] they are and we've got the message and
[50:21] we've got all this and Joshua and Moses
[50:23] and everything but Gideon says well
[50:25] where are all the Miracles
[50:27] then he said brother bam said this few
[50:30] years before this talking about Gideon
[50:33] had been the prophetess Deborah and
[50:35] baric and how that she had prophesied
[50:38] and told them what to do and it was
[50:39] exactly right baric the great warrior
[50:42] and how they made a song of the triumph
[50:45] over the enemy but as soon as they got
[50:47] out of the twist right straight back
[50:50] into the rut they went again if that
[50:53] isn't the picture of the church today
[50:57] just as soon as it gets out of one twist
[51:00] right into another one it goes but the
[51:02] time but time had come for action and
[51:05] that's the same now the time has come
[51:09] for Action the time had come when
[51:12] playing when playing church had come to
[51:16] a halt with God there's no more playing
[51:19] church we must get down to business and
[51:23] I trust that same God will place this
[51:26] upon the heart of the people tonight
[51:28] that it's time for a halt of playing
[51:30] Church playing religious playing
[51:33] righteous and now it's time for
[51:36] Action as I was speaking this morning
[51:40] upon the subject of what the new birth
[51:42] was and how we come to it surely that
[51:46] still sinks in your heart now the time
[51:49] has come to act upon what you know to be
[51:53] the truth you cannot act with Faith
[51:55] until first you know what you're doing
[51:59] you've got to first know what you are
[52:02] doing before you can have faith to do it
[52:06] then on that same tape brother Ram's
[52:08] closing and he says this oh God let us
[52:11] see a coming year this is a New Year's
[52:15] Eve
[52:16] message let us see a coming year till
[52:20] our hearts will not be satisfied with a
[52:22] church
[52:23] denomination or Creed
[52:26] with a handshake or so-called
[52:28] religion let us not be satisfied till we
[52:31] feel the miracle working power in God in
[52:35] our own Hearts taking the world out and
[52:38] forming
[52:40] Christ now not tonight and tomorrow
[52:43] start doing something else but grow in
[52:46] him up to his stature we grow up to him
[52:50] until we meet him that was his message
[52:54] brother Lyall
[52:56] that's what he preached he preached
[52:58] Jesus Christ knowing him growing in him
[53:01] find a sermon that he didn't preach
[53:04] that and we claim to believe him with
[53:07] all of our differences and
[53:11] sectarianism and all of our
[53:12] denominational ways we claim to believe
[53:15] the man that preached that every
[53:17] service and that's what judges is the
[53:21] Book of Judges shows that the people got
[53:25] their eyes off of God and their eyes on
[53:29] the
[53:30] world Joshua's final
[53:33] statements you know this one he says
[53:36] choose this day whom you will serve as
[53:39] for me in my house will serve the
[53:42] Lord and Israel when he said that Israel
[53:47] responded saying we want to do the same
[53:49] thing we want to serve the Lord
[53:53] too friends the world
[53:57] isn't just influencers on Tik Tock
[54:00] teaching our young people to sin and to
[54:02] look and act like the world but it also
[54:05] shows in This Book of Judges that it is
[54:08] a religious
[54:10] spirit it's
[54:13] worshiping Gods worshiping gods that
[54:16] were not
[54:18] Jehovah worshiping an image created in
[54:22] their mind and that image isn't real
[54:25] those Gods weren't
[54:27] real it's the same thing with us
[54:29] sometimes we make up
[54:31] something and we
[54:33] think that this is how religion is so
[54:36] I'll do this and I'll pray this way and
[54:39] all of that it's not real you got to
[54:41] know Jesus talk to him about it and then
[54:45] when you have that relationship then
[54:48] some then God will start
[54:51] moving sin followed these the worship of
[54:54] these these other gods and that's
[54:57] exactly why
[54:59] Joshua told the people to drive out
[55:04] these
[55:06] Canaanites from the land the promised
[55:09] land over Jordan brother brother Lyle
[55:12] just finished with the Book of Joshua
[55:15] they came
[55:16] over the the river into the promised
[55:20] land that God had
[55:22] promised way back all the way to Abraham
[55:25] they come over into this promised
[55:28] land and then God says now start driving
[55:31] them out start pushing them out remember
[55:35] they go to Jericho and they find Rahab
[55:38] and and then they go to I believe it was
[55:40] Ai and then they go on and on and on and
[55:42] on and they start driving these
[55:45] inhabitants of the land
[55:49] away and the Canaanites as is going to
[55:53] be referred to in this book the that's
[55:55] just a general statement for the people
[55:58] that live there that's the hites and the
[56:01] moabites and the jebusites and and all
[56:04] the land all the IES that lived out in
[56:05] the
[56:07] land and God knew that these people were
[56:11] going to influence them the Book of
[56:14] Judges it lasts about 400 years I I read
[56:19] a lot of different commentaries on it
[56:20] anywhere from 300 to 500 years but it
[56:23] looks like it was about 4 400 years that
[56:26] that this book
[56:29] covers and the same thing happens over
[56:31] and over in these entire 400 years and
[56:36] you can just pick wherever you want to
[56:38] open the Bible in that book and it'll be
[56:40] saying the same thing Israel does evil
[56:43] in the eyes of the Lord the people are
[56:44] given into the hands of their enemies
[56:46] they cry out to God for mercy God raises
[56:49] up a leader the spirit of God comes upon
[56:51] that leader the leader defeats the enemy
[56:54] and then peace is restored as long as
[56:56] that leader lives and then the cycle
[56:58] repeats itself over and over again with
[57:02] each judge the word
[57:04] judge it doesn't mean that it's like a
[57:07] judge in a
[57:08] courtroom who uh like deciding different
[57:11] cases and interpreting the law the judge
[57:13] for the most part these are military
[57:15] leaders who rise up and conquer the
[57:18] enemy now this is as you read it on your
[57:23] own you'll see a couple times
[57:25] it says because there was no king in
[57:28] Israel Israel had never had a king
[57:31] before judges so you it goes judges is
[57:35] from Joshua it ends at uh josua begins
[57:40] Josh judges begins at
[57:43] Joshua and goes all the way to King
[57:47] about King
[57:49] Saul so this and King Saul was the very
[57:53] first king of Israel
[57:55] so judge judges spans that time again
[57:59] from Joshua all the way to King Saul the
[58:03] author I don't really know who wrote
[58:07] judges a lot of people think that it was
[58:09] the prophet Samuel because Samuel was
[58:12] there when when Saul was there and he
[58:15] would have been The Logical choice to
[58:16] have written this um Narrative of all
[58:20] these years but they really don't know
[58:23] who the author was the 12 judges
[58:25] mentioned in the book annel ahud
[58:29] shamgar Deborah Gideon toah J
[58:35] jeepa izan Elon abdden and the last one
[58:40] is Samson some other people say that
[58:44] actually um Samuel was the last judge
[58:48] but in the Book of Judges it ends at
[58:51] Samson some of them some of these judges
[58:54] like like shamgar they only have one or
[58:56] two sentences about them and then others
[58:58] like Gideon and Samson have a whole lot
[59:01] written about them um as I said the the
[59:05] author they don't know who really wrote
[59:07] that um chapters one and two in the Book
[59:12] of Judges they speak about Conquest
[59:14] God's still with the children of Israel
[59:18] in the first part of Judges it's because
[59:20] Joshua was fresh in their minds but the
[59:24] L mentioned this when he taught on the
[59:26] Book of Joshua that Joshua and those
[59:29] Elders that knew Joshua they kept
[59:33] serving the lord but it was when they
[59:37] passed away that Israel began to fall
[59:41] chapters 3- 16 talks about how the
[59:44] israels fall into sin and compromise
[59:47] with the world that surrounds them and
[59:49] then really chapters 17- 21 closing of
[59:53] the book are just very strange we talk
[59:57] about some very very odd stories and it
[1:00:01] looks like everything is just in pure
[1:00:03] chaos in Israel at that time very
[1:00:07] sinful sinful time that was going on and
[1:00:11] you'll see that this Book of
[1:00:13] Judges more than any other it is very
[1:00:19] graphic I mean violence and a lot of n
[1:00:24] nasty stuff going on um I'll try to give
[1:00:29] the uh I'll water it down a little bit
[1:00:33] but it's it's rough This Book of Judges
[1:00:36] is a it's a tough book to read the book
[1:00:39] opens with successes with the tribes
[1:00:42] settling into their inherited land
[1:00:43] remember Joshua divided up all the
[1:00:45] tribes um and and they they came to
[1:00:48] their land and as I said they were
[1:00:51] successful they were driving out these
[1:00:53] inhabitants
[1:00:55] um so then the judges really show this
[1:01:00] book shows how important good leadership
[1:01:04] is it shows that when you don't have
[1:01:07] good
[1:01:09] leadership that the children of Israel
[1:01:13] immediately went into sin and it's it's
[1:01:15] both it's leadership on the government
[1:01:17] level it's leadership in the church's
[1:01:19] level and it's leadership right in home
[1:01:22] and all of us can see all of us know
[1:01:24] people that their families have just
[1:01:26] really had trouble and a lot of times
[1:01:29] it's because of poor leadership at home
[1:01:32] we see our we see in our country right
[1:01:34] now we see the sin just being invited
[1:01:38] into our country and we see everything
[1:01:41] fails because of it and it's not just
[1:01:43] the morality that people we see the
[1:01:45] economy failing we see all kinds of big
[1:01:47] problems associated with it but we see
[1:01:50] poor leadership within within our
[1:01:53] country with all the way at at the top
[1:01:56] Judges chapter 1 we'll get into the into
[1:01:59] the text
[1:02:03] now judges 1 verse
[1:02:06] one now after the death of Joshua it
[1:02:10] came to pass that the children of Israel
[1:02:13] asked the Lord saying who shall go up
[1:02:15] for us against the Canaanites first to
[1:02:18] fight against them and the Lord said
[1:02:20] Judah shall go up behold I have
[1:02:23] delivered the land into his hand now I
[1:02:27] know it's it seems very
[1:02:30] simple but notice they asked the
[1:02:33] Lord very very important they went to
[1:02:37] the Lord first they did what Joshua did
[1:02:40] they did what Moses did they did what
[1:02:42] these Elders did that had set this
[1:02:44] example is exactly what they did and
[1:02:47] they continued winning battles here in
[1:02:49] the Book of Judges but they made a big
[1:02:52] mistake as they were going out out God
[1:02:55] had instructed them to completely drive
[1:02:57] out the inhabitants of the land but they
[1:03:00] didn't completely do it and the problem
[1:03:04] was that Joshua had
[1:03:06] died and then the degradation of Israel
[1:03:10] began and as I said before it's because
[1:03:14] they didn't have that
[1:03:16] relationship with the Lord that they
[1:03:18] should have had and
[1:03:21] today what I was saying earlier is is if
[1:03:24] you right relying on the righteousness
[1:03:27] of brother brandom or your pastor your
[1:03:28] parents or anyone else rather than you
[1:03:31] receiving the Holy Spirit then the same
[1:03:34] thing is going to happen to
[1:03:36] you as happened in This Book of Judges
[1:03:40] that I'm about to
[1:03:45] read so let's go uh let's skip to verse
[1:03:49] 21 now watch
[1:03:52] this and it may seem kind of boring in
[1:03:55] reading this but it is super important
[1:03:58] to lay a foundation to the Book of
[1:04:00] Judges and the children of
[1:04:02] Benjamin did not drive out the jebusites
[1:04:05] that inhabited Jerusalem but the
[1:04:07] jebusites dwell with the children of
[1:04:10] Benjamin in Jerusalem under this day so
[1:04:13] those Canaanites were an
[1:04:14] influence and we like to think often we
[1:04:17] like to think that we are going to
[1:04:18] influence everybody else but in this
[1:04:20] case it was them that influenced
[1:04:24] God's
[1:04:26] people and the house of Joseph they also
[1:04:29] went up against bethl and the Lord was
[1:04:31] with them and the house of Joseph sent
[1:04:33] sent a describe sent to describe bethl
[1:04:37] now the name of the city before was L
[1:04:40] and the spies saw a man come forth out
[1:04:43] of the city and they said unto him show
[1:04:45] us we pray thee the entrance into the
[1:04:48] City and we will show thee mercy and
[1:04:51] when he showed them the entrance into
[1:04:52] the city they smote the city with at the
[1:04:54] edge of the sword now they again they
[1:04:55] won another battle but watch this but
[1:04:58] they let go the man and all his
[1:05:01] family and the man went into the land of
[1:05:04] the Hittites and built a city and called
[1:05:07] the name thereof lse which is the name
[1:05:10] thereof unto this day neither did
[1:05:13] Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of
[1:05:17] bethen and her towns nor tanac and her
[1:05:21] towns nor the inhabitants of dor and her
[1:05:23] towns nor the inhabitants of IAM and her
[1:05:27] towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo and
[1:05:30] her towns but the Canaanites would dwell
[1:05:33] in that
[1:05:35] land it's important to the author here
[1:05:38] to tell us this and it came to pass when
[1:05:41] Israel was strong that they put the
[1:05:43] Canaanites to Tribute and did not
[1:05:45] utterly drive them
[1:05:47] out right here they could have driven
[1:05:51] them out but because they demanded that
[1:05:54] they would pay taxes sounds sounds like
[1:05:56] a good idea huh well we'll
[1:05:58] just we don't have the money so we'll
[1:06:01] let these people stay here because they
[1:06:02] have some money and we'll just demand
[1:06:04] that they pay tribute to us it sounds
[1:06:07] good and you think how could God want us
[1:06:10] to drive out these people this is their
[1:06:13] home how could God want us to drive them
[1:06:15] out of their home it was God's
[1:06:18] land no matter how much anybody says
[1:06:22] anything this was God's land he could
[1:06:24] give it to whoever he wanted and he gave
[1:06:27] it to the sons and the daughters of
[1:06:31] Abraham neither did Ephraim drive out
[1:06:34] the Canaanites that dwelt in gizer but
[1:06:37] the Canaanites dwelt in gizer among them
[1:06:39] neither did zebul drive out the
[1:06:41] inhabitants of kitron nor the
[1:06:43] inhabitants of noo but the Canaanites
[1:06:47] dwell among them and became tributaries
[1:06:49] neither did did Asher Drive outs drive
[1:06:52] out the inhabitants of acho nor the
[1:06:54] inhabitants of zidon nor of Hal alab nor
[1:06:59] of um aib nor of helba nor of AIC nor of
[1:07:04] reob sorry I can I can't pronounce the
[1:07:07] names but you know what I'm saying you
[1:07:09] can read them for the L I should have
[1:07:11] had you just pronounce
[1:07:13] them but but the
[1:07:16] asheritah ites the inhabitants of the
[1:07:18] land for they did not drive them out
[1:07:20] neither did Neftali drive out the
[1:07:23] inhabitants of Beth shamesh nor the
[1:07:25] inhabitants of
[1:07:27] bethan but he dwelt in the among the
[1:07:30] Canaanites I feel like when I'm talking
[1:07:32] I feel like I have a lift but I'm saying
[1:07:34] that it's hard to say nevertheless the
[1:07:38] inhabitants of Beth
[1:07:41] bees became Tri in um that that in Beth
[1:07:46] bethan became tributes unto them and the
[1:07:49] amorites forced the children of Dan I
[1:07:51] can say that one into the the mountain
[1:07:54] for they would not suffer them to come
[1:07:56] down into the into the
[1:07:58] valley so what did this Disobedience to
[1:08:01] God result
[1:08:02] in it made sense to the Israelites to do
[1:08:05] what they did but still God's word was
[1:08:09] God's word and he told them to drive
[1:08:11] them
[1:08:13] out chapter
[1:08:16] 2 verse one says
[1:08:19] this and an angel of the Lord came up
[1:08:22] from gilgal
[1:08:24] to boim and said I made you to go up out
[1:08:28] of Egypt and have brought you unto the
[1:08:31] land which I swear unto your fathers and
[1:08:33] said I will never break my commandment
[1:08:36] my Covenant with you and ye shall make
[1:08:39] no league with the inhabitants of this
[1:08:42] land you shall throw down their altars
[1:08:45] but you have not obeyed my voice why
[1:08:47] have you done this don't make a deal
[1:08:50] with them don't jump in with them don't
[1:08:53] partake of their sins do what I told you
[1:08:56] and drive them out but you didn't do
[1:08:59] that let's skip to verse
[1:09:05] 13 and what did it result in and they
[1:09:08] forsook the Lord and serve Baal and
[1:09:12] asero now this Baal and asteroth these
[1:09:14] are the gods of the inhabitants of
[1:09:17] Canaan and I want to point out again
[1:09:21] that this is still worship they thought
[1:09:24] that they were doing right they're not
[1:09:26] going to do something they don't think
[1:09:28] is right so they're still worshiping
[1:09:31] it's still religion even though it might
[1:09:33] seem like Idol idolatry to you and me to
[1:09:36] them it was
[1:09:38] real and the anger of the Lord was hot
[1:09:41] against
[1:09:42] Israel and he delivered them into the
[1:09:44] hands of the spoilers that spoiled them
[1:09:46] and he sold them into the hands of their
[1:09:48] enemies round about so that they could
[1:09:51] not any longer stand before their
[1:09:53] enemies enemies whether soever they went
[1:09:55] out the hand of the Lord was against
[1:09:58] them for evil as the Lord had said and
[1:10:02] as the Lord had sworn unto them and they
[1:10:05] were greatly
[1:10:07] distressed nevertheless the Lord raised
[1:10:10] up judges which delivered them out of
[1:10:12] the hand of those that spoiled them and
[1:10:16] yet they would not hearken under their
[1:10:18] judges but they went a whoring after
[1:10:20] other gods and bowed themselves unto
[1:10:23] them they turned quickly out of the way
[1:10:26] which their fathers walked in obeying
[1:10:28] the Commandments of the Lord but they
[1:10:31] did not so and when the Lord raised them
[1:10:34] up judges then the Lord was with the
[1:10:37] judge and delivered them out of the hand
[1:10:40] of their enemies all the days of the
[1:10:41] judge for it repented the Lord because
[1:10:44] of their groanings by reason of them
[1:10:47] that oppressed them and vexed them and
[1:10:49] it came to pass when the judge was dead
[1:10:51] that they returned and corrupted
[1:10:53] themselves more than their fathers in
[1:10:55] following other gods to serve them
[1:10:57] remember what I said at the
[1:10:59] beginning we came out of the
[1:11:02] denominations and I truly feel like we
[1:11:04] have made a worse denomination and
[1:11:07] become more sectarian and more
[1:11:09] judgmental and more um
[1:11:12] elitist than the ones that came
[1:11:16] out and it came to pass I believe that's
[1:11:20] true I really do that we have slipped
[1:11:27] into the same thing that our
[1:11:30] grandparents came out
[1:11:33] of and it came to pass when the judge
[1:11:35] was dead that they returned and
[1:11:36] corrupted themselves more than their
[1:11:38] fathers in following other gods to serve
[1:11:40] them and to bow down unto them they
[1:11:43] ceased not from their own doings nor
[1:11:45] from their stubborn way and the anger of
[1:11:48] the Lord was hot against Israel and he
[1:11:50] said because that this people hath
[1:11:52] transgressed my Covenant which I
[1:11:54] commanded their fathers and have not
[1:11:56] hearkened unto my voice I also will not
[1:11:59] henceforth drive out anymore before them
[1:12:02] of the Nations which Joshua left when he
[1:12:05] died that through them I may Pro prove
[1:12:09] Israel whether they will keep the way of
[1:12:11] the Lord to walk therein as their
[1:12:13] fathers did keep or not therefore the
[1:12:17] Lord left those Nations without driving
[1:12:19] them out hastily neither delivered he
[1:12:22] them into the hand of
[1:12:26] Joshua now chapters 3-
[1:12:30] 16 are
[1:12:32] stories about the growing
[1:12:35] corruption that is now in Israel and it
[1:12:38] just gets worse and worse and worse
[1:12:40] there's six main judges I said that
[1:12:42] there were 12 before but there's six
[1:12:44] main ones annel ahud
[1:12:49] Debra and Gideon jeepa and Samson
[1:12:54] this anneal we'll start with him and
[1:12:58] then I'll probably get through one more
[1:13:00] before we close but this
[1:13:03] anneal he was either a nephew of a
[1:13:06] brother sometimes it's hard to hard to
[1:13:08] understand in the Bible whether it's a
[1:13:10] what kind of relation it is but he was
[1:13:12] either a nephew of or a brother of Caleb
[1:13:14] and Israel's first
[1:13:16] judge after the spirit of the Lord came
[1:13:18] on him AEL freed the Israelites from
[1:13:22] this king
[1:13:25] kushen
[1:13:27] ratham who ruled over the region of
[1:13:30] Aram and part of Mesopotamia this man
[1:13:34] had oppressed the Israelites for eight
[1:13:37] years and after off and afterwards annel
[1:13:40] overpowered the forces and the Jews
[1:13:41] enjoyed peace for 40 years until AEL
[1:13:43] died so what happened was so these
[1:13:46] Israelites they got into their
[1:13:48] land and they didn't drive out these
[1:13:52] people that they should have driven out
[1:13:54] and then the oppressors they start to
[1:13:57] get more powerful these Canaanites and
[1:14:00] what they do is they come in and they
[1:14:04] take from the Israelites they take their
[1:14:07] food they take their gold and they
[1:14:10] oppress them it's the same as if you've
[1:14:13] studied some of the history of this part
[1:14:15] of the country the
[1:14:18] Apaches they would be up in the
[1:14:20] mountains and they would come down and
[1:14:23] they would raid the other Native
[1:14:26] Americans and take what they've done and
[1:14:29] that was part of the living that they
[1:14:31] would that they would make I'm not
[1:14:33] trying to take a side between any of
[1:14:35] these different tribes but that's
[1:14:36] history that's that's these raiding
[1:14:38] tribes would come in and take what these
[1:14:41] farmer tribes would have and that's
[1:14:44] that's the way it is a bit of a
[1:14:45] symbiotic relationship I guess that they
[1:14:48] would take and that's what was happening
[1:14:50] here is these Canaanites would come in
[1:14:54] and they would take from the Israelites
[1:14:58] God would raise up a judge to fight
[1:15:00] against them and he raised up this
[1:15:02] anneal to fight against
[1:15:06] these
[1:15:07] Canaanites and then for 40 years until
[1:15:12] annol died and then they started falling
[1:15:15] back into
[1:15:17] sin
[1:15:19] ahud is the
[1:15:21] second let's read uh 312
[1:15:26] here and the children of Israel did Evil
[1:15:28] again in the sight of the Lord and the
[1:15:31] Lord strengthened Egan the king of Moab
[1:15:33] against Israel because they had done
[1:15:36] evil in the sight of the Lord and He
[1:15:38] gathered unto him the children of Ammon
[1:15:41] and amalec and went and smote Israel and
[1:15:45] possessed the city of the of palm trees
[1:15:48] so the children of Israel served eglan
[1:15:50] the king of Moab 18 years
[1:15:54] years so God raises
[1:15:58] up
[1:15:59] this judge this
[1:16:02] man named
[1:16:04] ahud
[1:16:06] now eglan as I said was the king of Moab
[1:16:09] so this
[1:16:11] man ahood hope I don't get them mixed up
[1:16:14] mixed up Egan was the king I'll say the
[1:16:16] king and then ahud so ahud he raises up
[1:16:20] the spirit of the Lord comes on him
[1:16:23] and then what does he do he makes the
[1:16:28] sword it was 18 inches long you know how
[1:16:31] I know it was 18 inches long the Bible
[1:16:33] says it was 18 inches long it was a
[1:16:35] cubit and it had two edges and he makes
[1:16:39] it to where it will fit under his under
[1:16:43] his outside clothes on his right leg you
[1:16:47] know why he put it on his right leg
[1:16:49] because he was
[1:16:51] left-handed so he could go over here
[1:16:53] here and pull it out really easy you
[1:16:55] know how I know he was left-handed the
[1:16:57] Bible says he was left-handed it's
[1:16:59] really neat the
[1:17:01] detail that that is in This Book of
[1:17:03] Judges so he builds this knife he puts
[1:17:06] it in here and so he can he can pull it
[1:17:11] out when he needs it and then he goes
[1:17:14] and all of the people of Israel they
[1:17:16] give him the tribute money to bring to
[1:17:19] this
[1:17:20] King so ahud takes all the money
[1:17:24] I doubt very seriously that the children
[1:17:26] of Israel knew what he was going to do
[1:17:29] he takes all the money and he brings it
[1:17:32] and he gets an audience with this
[1:17:35] King so he takes it up there and and
[1:17:38] they're in the king's chamber and all of
[1:17:40] the guards and stuff are around and all
[1:17:42] the servants
[1:17:43] and um
[1:17:46] ahud says to Egon he says uh he says he
[1:17:51] looks at me he says hey I have a I have
[1:17:52] a private message for
[1:17:55] you has all this
[1:17:57] money so the king's like you have a
[1:17:59] private message for me he's like yeah
[1:18:02] yeah I got I have a private something I
[1:18:04] want to just tell you so he looks at all
[1:18:06] of his servants he say okay leave
[1:18:07] everybody leave everybody get out of my
[1:18:09] chamber all the guards leave all of the
[1:18:11] servants leave they go out and he's like
[1:18:13] shut the door shut the door they shut
[1:18:15] the
[1:18:18] door and ahood
[1:18:21] says
[1:18:23] I have a message from God for
[1:18:28] you and he says
[1:18:31] really and it has it gets his
[1:18:35] attention and
[1:18:37] then aood pulls
[1:18:41] out this
[1:18:42] dagger that he had
[1:18:44] made
[1:18:47] now Egan was a very fat man you know how
[1:18:53] I know he was a very fat man the Bible
[1:18:56] says he was a very fat
[1:19:00] man he pulls out this
[1:19:04] dagger
[1:19:06] and he uses
[1:19:09] it so uses it he sticks him with it and
[1:19:14] he goes in so far he can't get it out so
[1:19:17] then this this egin this guy is mortally
[1:19:20] wounded he
[1:19:21] dies
[1:19:23] so
[1:19:24] ahud he uses this chance he's like okay
[1:19:28] the king's here dying so he takes off he
[1:19:30] gets out of there and then what about
[1:19:32] the
[1:19:33] servants the servants are still
[1:19:36] outside and they're like man what is
[1:19:40] taking the king so
[1:19:42] long and they're too afraid to go
[1:19:47] in and check on the king and all the
[1:19:51] time that they're they're one wondering
[1:19:53] do we do we go in there do we not he's
[1:19:55] he's in there what's he doing in
[1:19:57] there the hero is escaping and running
[1:20:02] away so then they finally figure out the
[1:20:07] big king is
[1:20:09] dead and uh after that the Israelites
[1:20:14] attack this Moab and they
[1:20:18] overpower and they win the battle and
[1:20:21] again we had peace in
[1:20:25] Israel so that's the second judge I have
[1:20:30] I have time to
[1:20:32] go for at least one more so then the
[1:20:35] third judge is this guy named shamgar
[1:20:38] there's only like one sentence about him
[1:20:40] and in the whole Bible and it says that
[1:20:43] he took this Ox go and he killed like
[1:20:48] 600 Philistines you know what an ox
[1:20:51] codat is an ox is it's it's a it's a
[1:20:55] like a spear that has kind of a point on
[1:20:57] it that they can poke the oxes or has
[1:21:01] some sort of a tip on it and they can
[1:21:03] get them to go where they want them to
[1:21:05] go so this man shamgar takes that and
[1:21:08] kills all of of these Philistines and
[1:21:12] judges
[1:21:13] Israel one like one
[1:21:17] scripture about
[1:21:19] this but this
[1:21:21] shamgar was a uh he was a very special
[1:21:25] person he was a special person to me and
[1:21:29] probably to you because brother
[1:21:32] branam mentioned him in 16 different
[1:21:37] sermons that he preached one scripture

[1:21:57] and thought Oh here he goes again he
[1:22:00] stood there and he thought well look
[1:22:02] down at his poor little wife her little
[1:22:05] sunken face and maybe his children
[1:22:07] remember I I said how these Canaanites
[1:22:09] would do they would take the all the
[1:22:11] food and stuff from the
[1:22:13] Israelites their little sleeves are
[1:22:15] ragged their clothes were gone his poor
[1:22:18] wife was starved to death what will the
[1:22:21] winner be this time there it is now all

[1:22:32] about starved last year now they'll take
[1:22:35] what I got now what will I do just what
[1:22:39] gleanings I can get from the field he
[1:22:41] stood there he thought here here they
[1:22:45] come closer and closer Trump Trump trump
[1:22:50] these Philistines after a while
[1:22:53] There Was You don't believe in getting
[1:22:55] angry then let the righteous IND
[1:22:58] indignation arise he began to feel it
[1:23:01] coming upon him he said here I am a Jew
[1:23:04] I'm circumcised I've got a right for
[1:23:07] this land belongs to us and I tell you
[1:23:10] he wasn't a
[1:23:11] warrior he couldn't wait till he learned
[1:23:14] how to fight he was a farmer he wasn't a
[1:23:18] fighter but he knew that he had the
[1:23:20] promise of God was with him
[1:23:23] and he was circumcised And if every man
[1:23:25] here tonight would realize that the
[1:23:27] things you got Divine health and
[1:23:30] everything else God gave it to you at
[1:23:33] Calvary every born again man is
[1:23:36] circumcised by the Holy Ghost you have a
[1:23:38] right for every Redemptive blessing let
[1:23:41] the devil rob you out of none of it
[1:23:45] shamgar didn't have no
[1:23:47] sword he didn't know nothing about it if
[1:23:51] he had one he didn't have a
[1:23:53] shield but if he had a shield he
[1:23:55] wouldn't know how to use it but he
[1:23:58] reached up and got an ox go that's an
[1:24:01] old stick that's got a brass lump on the
[1:24:04] end of it and they beat the ox to the
[1:24:06] Corral with it he jumped out of that
[1:24:09] window out of the middle of the road
[1:24:11] against 600 armed Philistines and killed
[1:24:15] every one of them hallelujah what was it
[1:24:18] the Holy Spirit Come on him Hallelujah
[1:24:22] and then there was a need there was an
[1:24:24] emergency something had to be done and
[1:24:26] he couldn't wait till he got an
[1:24:28] education learn how to fight and be a
[1:24:30] warrior and trained up he had to take
[1:24:32] what was in his hand and go and do
[1:24:35] something with it and that was shamgar
[1:24:39] that
[1:24:40] judge the next one I have time for one
[1:24:43] more the next one was it's always been
[1:24:47] odd to me growing up was a woman the
[1:24:51] Bible says that she was a prophetess her
[1:24:53] name was
[1:24:54] Deborah now Deborah obviously had a
[1:24:58] gift she was
[1:25:00] born both a propheus and and she was
[1:25:03] made a
[1:25:05] judge which is she had she had
[1:25:08] leadership qualities in her and after
[1:25:11] the death of
[1:25:14] ahud again the Israelites did did evil
[1:25:17] in the sight of the Lord so God handed
[1:25:19] them over to jabin the king of Canaan
[1:25:22] with his Commander this man named cicer
[1:25:26] and an army of Chariots and they
[1:25:28] oppressed Israel for 20 years and and
[1:25:31] then Israel finally cried to the Lord
[1:25:34] for help so Deborah the prophet is she's
[1:25:38] she is encouraging the people she needs
[1:25:41] help is what she needs so she goes to
[1:25:44] this
[1:25:45] Warrior named
[1:25:47] baric and she asks him she says baric I
[1:25:51] want you to go up she she gives a
[1:25:53] prophecy and she says I want you to go
[1:25:56] up and fight this man
[1:25:58] CIS
[1:26:00] baric didn't maybe have the confidence
[1:26:03] that he should have had so he asks
[1:26:06] Deborah he says I won't go up unless you
[1:26:09] go with
[1:26:10] me now remember the separation of the
[1:26:13] Sexes here A man is called to be a man
[1:26:16] and a woman's called to be a woman
[1:26:18] Deborah even later on she says I was a
[1:26:20] mother in Israel
[1:26:23] when she sings this this Victory song
[1:26:26] well baric says I'm not going to go
[1:26:30] unless you go with
[1:26:32] me she says okay and then she prophesies
[1:26:36] remember she has the gift of of Prophecy
[1:26:39] upon her she
[1:26:41] says if I
[1:26:43] go then God is not going to give you
[1:26:47] this
[1:26:48] Victory he's going to give it to a woman
[1:26:54] wow so then they go so as I was reading
[1:27:00] this I was like oh it's going to be her
[1:27:02] she's going to win it so they go and
[1:27:05] they go to
[1:27:07] battle and baric beats this General cic
[1:27:12] and all of his chariots and everything
[1:27:14] else but ciser
[1:27:17] escapes and he goes around and he's in
[1:27:21] hiding so cisar comes to this woman
[1:27:27] named does anybody know the story what's
[1:27:30] her name jail right cisterra comes to
[1:27:34] this woman named
[1:27:36] jail and he says I'm really thirsty and
[1:27:39] you I'm running and I need some help and
[1:27:41] Jail's like sure I can help
[1:27:45] you here's some warm nice warm milk
[1:27:48] maybe it'll put you to
[1:27:49] sleep so CIS takes he takes the milk and
[1:27:53] oh thank you so much and he says here
[1:27:54] Hide me so he takes the milk and he
[1:27:56] drinks and he's so tired and he goes
[1:27:58] into the tent and he hides under the
[1:28:02] blanket and jail the little lady
[1:28:06] remember the prophecy of Deborah the
[1:28:09] little lady she goes remember he's in a
[1:28:12] tent you know what you hold down tents
[1:28:14] with you know the the the ropes that
[1:28:17] come down and there's a steak in the
[1:28:20] ground right you got it Kenneth and and
[1:28:23] you tighten that
[1:28:24] up and anyways she picked one of those
[1:28:28] Stakes as a sharp point on the end and
[1:28:31] she took the
[1:28:36] hammer he's sleeping after he took drank
[1:28:39] that nice warm milk that jail gave him
[1:28:43] she's laying down she takes the tent
[1:28:47] steak can I say it brother
[1:28:50] Jordan take takes the tent Stak gently
[1:28:54] lays it on the side of his head and he's
[1:28:59] asleep
[1:29:01] pow drove the stake right through the
[1:29:04] guy into the ground and killed him the
[1:29:08] prophecy of Deborah right there came to
[1:29:14] pass in that he gave God gave the cing
[1:29:17] God gave this General into the hands of
[1:29:20] a
[1:29:20] woman and then so Deborah she was that
[1:29:24] she was that judge but baric was the one
[1:29:27] that he took 10,000 soldiers and he's
[1:29:29] just slaughtered cis's
[1:29:31] Army and then after that there was peace
[1:29:35] another 40 years and uh if the musicians
[1:29:39] could come and we'll close and we'll
[1:29:40] pick this up at a later date we'll get
[1:29:43] to Gideon and we'll get to these other
[1:29:45] ones that also did these great things
[1:29:49] for the Lord that God chose these people
[1:29:51] p pulled them
[1:29:53] out of this sinful
[1:29:55] nation and really they delivered Israel
[1:29:59] these judges so in review we know that
[1:30:05] brother ly he preached on Joshua we know
[1:30:07] that God blessed all of Israel when they
[1:30:10] came over they drove out the inhabitants
[1:30:13] they they then Joshua died and then they
[1:30:16] stopped driving out all of them they
[1:30:19] were influenced by these worldly people
[1:30:23] they took on their worldly ways they
[1:30:26] took on their sinful
[1:30:28] ways God pulled his hand from them they
[1:30:33] fell into bondage they fell into sin
[1:30:36] they they they were oppressed then God
[1:30:39] would raise up a judge deliver them and
[1:30:43] then the cycle would repeat over and
[1:30:47] over again and that's the Book of Judges
[1:30:50] as I said it's it's um kind of a
[1:30:53] depressing book when you read it because
[1:30:56] it's just failure after failure it's
[1:30:57] great victories by these judges but then
[1:31:00] it's um it's really tough that we see
[1:31:05] that Israel had fallen so many times
[1:31:09] let's let's stand and friends when I'm
[1:31:12] talking about this I really do I mean
[1:31:17] it
[1:31:19] that these book these things aren't
[1:31:22] recorded in this Bible if we're not to
[1:31:25] apply them to our own lives and I feel
[1:31:31] that we shouldn't make the same mistakes
[1:31:34] that were made we don't have the excuses
[1:31:37] necessarily that they have because we
[1:31:38] can read about their mistakes God bless
[1:31:41] you brother
[1:31:41] [Music]
[1:31:43] Aon oh life is
