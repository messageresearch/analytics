[0:12] so I wanted to share that but let's sing
[0:14] press on
[0:19] the valley is deep
[0:25] and when the mountain is steep
[0:32] When the body is weary,
[0:38] when we stumble and fall,
[0:41] [Music]
[0:45] when the choices are hard.
[0:51] When we're battered and scarred,
[0:57] when we've spent our resource,
[1:01] [Music]

[1:10] in
[1:11] Jesus
[1:13] name,

[24:10] of my heart.

[26:51] [Music]
[27:06] If y'all know this, please sing it with
[27:07] me. I have not done this in a very long
[27:09] time. Hoping, praying that I remember
[27:12] what Kia even put this in. But when
[27:15] brother Daniel was preaching this
[27:16] morning, um just some of the stuff he
[27:20] said about hungering and thirsting,
[27:22] that's really something I've been going
[27:23] through. Um the song's just been going
[27:26] through my head, had it on my heart, and
[27:29] so
[27:33] [Music]
[27:53] I lay in bed
[27:56] [Music]
[27:59] to cry
[28:02] and my mind just fails to know
[28:08] exactly
[28:10] why
[28:11] I can't explain.
[28:15] With tongue or pin,
[28:18] the spirit's groaning
[28:21] deep within.
[28:24] It must be
[28:27] here in my soul.
[28:30] Cuz I feel the pull.
[28:35] I feel the
[28:40] I hear the call.
[28:45] And I know his spirit moving me
[28:50] to give my all.
[28:56] He speaks to me
[29:00] and I agree.
[29:04] Lord, please come and take control.
[29:10] I feel the P.
[29:16] I went to hear the word. And with each
[29:22] line and praise,
[29:26] he was drawing me to give a higher
[29:33] praise.
[29:35] There's a deep
[29:38] fall to the deep
[29:41] like a great magnet
[29:44] pulling me. I know for sure
[29:50] I'll reach, let go. Cuz I feel the poor.
[29:58] I feel the poor.
[30:02] I hear the call
[30:05] and I know his spirit moving me to give
[30:13] my hope.
[30:16] He speaks to me
[30:21] and I agree.
[30:26] Lord, please come and take control.
[30:32] I feel the
[30:38] Lord. Please come and take control.
[30:43] I feel the poor.
[30:49] [Music]
[30:54] I'll stand. How about one one more time
[30:57] with the chorus? Rebecca,
[31:04] [Music]
[31:07] &gt;&gt; I hear the call
[31:12] and I know your spirit's moving
[31:17] to him. my own.
[31:22] He speaks to me
[31:26] and I
[31:30] Lord come and take control.
[31:36] I feel the
[31:42] Our mighty heavenly father, we thank
[31:44] you. Thank you for your kindness, Lord.
[31:48] We humbly now, Lord, invite you into our
[31:52] presence.
[31:54] Surely, Lord, you were pleased with this
[31:56] these songs of worship.
[31:59] And now, Father, we ask
[32:02] that your anointing would rest upon us
[32:05] as we give you praise, Father, for what
[32:08] you have done for us. Lord, that words
[32:11] can't express what you've done for us,
[32:12] but Lord, we can just make known to each
[32:15] other.
[32:17] A few things that you have blessed us
[32:19] with in recent times. Father, we love
[32:23] you and we thank you in Jesus name.
[32:26] Amen.
[32:28] Amen. Rebecca, it feels good to sing in
[32:31] your own church, doesn't it? Bless you.
[32:33] You did a really nice job. Thank you.
[32:40] Amen. You can be seated.
[32:44] Um,
[32:47] I want to uh I want to make a couple
[32:49] announcements. First,
[32:51] the uh I want to make a video of of our
[32:55] church. I want to get some I want to get
[32:57] testimonies
[32:58] and uh for a twofold purpose. Uh, one
[33:02] will be I want to make a condensed
[33:03] version of the video and that will just
[33:06] be short 30 second to one minute clips
[33:09] and maybe a third of what we get and
[33:12] then I want to make a fulllength video
[33:14] of just testimonies from our church from
[33:17] the people in our church. Um, and uh the
[33:21] the short one will be as I said we'll
[33:24] only play probably use a third or so of
[33:25] the videos. Uh the first one will be
[33:28] used if the Lord's willing at our
[33:30] dedication in November and then I would
[33:34] like to also post the fulllength one on
[33:37] our YouTube page and on our website
[33:41] and um I want the subject to be what
[33:45] this church means to you
[33:49] and what what is a church. So you can
[33:52] give a short testimony. You can um tell
[33:57] what a church means to you. Um just say
[34:01] a few words about our church, a few
[34:04] personal words. So you can take the
[34:06] videos yourself with somebody helping
[34:08] you with an iPhone or um other type of
[34:13] phone or we can help you out. But I want
[34:17] to get started on that right away
[34:18] because there's going to be a lot of
[34:19] editing to do. So, I want to have
[34:21] everything done. I want to have all the
[34:22] videos compiled within a month and then
[34:24] that'll give us a few weeks to get these
[34:27] things ready for the um church
[34:30] dedication. So, start thinking about
[34:31] that and uh start thinking about what
[34:34] you're going to say and I think it's
[34:37] going to be a blessing. Um
[34:42] and then uh for tonight we are going to
[34:45] have a testimony service. I know
[34:48] everybody looks forward to that. I I
[34:50] certainly do. This really my This is my
[34:53] favorite time of being a pastor is when
[34:56] I get to hear what's going on. You hear
[34:59] me all the time, but when I get to hear
[35:02] what's going on with the congregation,
[35:04] it just it blesses me so much. This is
[35:06] just recharges my batteries. I I want to
[35:09] say a few words about the sermon this
[35:11] morning before we get started. And
[35:15] friends, what I'm trying to do is I shut
[35:20] it down at 11:25 when I'm ministering.
[35:23] No matter if I come if I start at
[35:26] quarter till um4 to 11 or whatever time
[35:31] I I want to shut it down at 11:25.
[35:34] Then that gives us time to worship and
[35:36] then we can get out at a reasonable time
[35:38] and I don't want to wear the people out.
[35:40] It's very very important to me. You hear
[35:42] a minister so often say, "Can I just
[35:44] have 15 more minutes?" It's like, "Yeah,
[35:46] like we're going to say no." Um,
[35:50] but
[35:52] a lot of times it's for that minister.
[35:55] And I have every time I have my sermon
[35:57] down and I always get about three
[35:59] quarters of the way done, sometimes
[36:01] half.
[36:03] And uh and and I I shut it down because
[36:05] I know that you can only take so much
[36:08] and it gets it gets tiring especially in
[36:10] today's modern world. Maybe
[36:14] uh few decades ago it was easier to sit
[36:17] through a a twoh hour, three-hour
[36:19] sermon, but today's different. We are
[36:21] we're we're made different and today's a
[36:23] different world that we live in. So I'm
[36:25] I'm trying
[36:27] just so you know I I shut it down and I
[36:30] have a hard fast rule for myself. Now,
[36:32] if you have a guest minister, then it's
[36:34] different. But I'm trying to even
[36:36] shorten it a little bit more. I don't
[36:38] want you to leave worn out. I want you
[36:41] to leave saying, you know, he he could
[36:42] have given us a little bit more. Maybe
[36:44] just leave a little bit hungry. And and
[36:47] then I think I think that's the way to
[36:49] do it. But um I didn't finish this
[36:53] morning. And if you just give me 10
[36:56] minutes,
[37:00] &gt;&gt; what a hypocrite.
[37:03] This is at the beginning of the service
[37:05] though. I I want to I want to go over
[37:07] the biatitudes a little bit more. And
[37:09] what I wanted to do this morning that I
[37:11] didn't get to because I I saw the time
[37:14] was up is I wanted to give a summary of
[37:18] Matthew chapter 5 verses one 1- 11. And
[37:22] just to go over again what I said
[37:25] earlier because I believe it's important
[37:27] that we understand these biatitudes. I
[37:30] believe it's important that we
[37:31] understand this foundation of this
[37:33] sermon on the mount. So let's turn if
[37:37] you could put up on the screen Matthew
[37:39] chapter 5 and we'll start with verse
[37:41] one. I just want to read through the
[37:43] biatitudes make a couple a couple
[37:45] comments on each scripture and then we
[37:47] will get into the testimony service.
[37:50] So, I got you here with a promise of
[37:53] testimonies and I'm going to preach to
[37:55] you a little bit. Matthew chapter 5,
[37:59] verse one. It reads like this. And
[38:01] seeing the multitude,
[38:04] he went up into a mountain. And he when
[38:06] he was set, his disciples came unto him,
[38:10] and he opened his mouth, and he taught
[38:12] them, saying, "Blessed are the poor in
[38:15] spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
[38:18] heaven.
[38:20] As I said this morning, and I want to I
[38:22] want to review this. This is when you
[38:24] are convicted for your sins that you've
[38:27] committed. This is when you realize that
[38:30] you're in a hopeless condition without
[38:32] God. It's when you realize that you also
[38:35] have a promise to receive the kingdom of
[38:38] heaven, that you can also dwell with
[38:41] God. This is the very foundation of this
[38:44] progression of being a Christian.
[38:48] Blessed are they that mourn, for they
[38:52] shall be comforted. So now is when godly
[38:55] sorrow enters into your heart. I got a
[38:58] lot of comments about this after the
[39:01] service that you know they they said,
[39:05] "Brother, I didn't I didn't consider
[39:08] that blessed are they that mourn." We
[39:11] always think of mourning as as a death.
[39:13] But no, we also mourn for for tragic
[39:16] things that happened.
[39:18] And we mourn for our sins that we've
[39:21] committed. We regret our bad decisions.
[39:23] We regret past behavior. And then you
[39:27] shall be comforted with the hope of a
[39:30] changed life.
[39:32] Jesus brings such hope.
[39:35] The worst situation you have ever been
[39:38] in can be turned around. The worst
[39:41] situation anyone has ever been in can be
[39:43] turned around with God.
[39:47] I mean, I preached on Jonah a couple
[39:49] weeks ago. Jonah was in a rough spot.
[39:53] The bottom of the ocean in the belly of
[39:55] a whale. He had it. He He was He was in
[39:58] a very difficult situation, probably
[40:00] more difficult than any of us have ever
[40:01] been in. And God turned it around from
[40:04] him for him. So, so when you mourn, you
[40:08] regret your behavior,
[40:11] then you shall be comforted because you
[40:15] have hope that God can turn things
[40:17] around. Blessed are the meek, for they
[40:20] shall inherit the earth. This is when
[40:22] you really you give your heart to the
[40:24] Lord. You receive the humility that all
[40:26] Christians should have and know that you
[40:30] really you're nothing in yourself.
[40:33] But any good thing about you comes from
[40:37] God. If you really understand that, if
[40:41] you really are meek, blessed are other
[40:44] translations says say blessed are the
[40:45] humble. When that humbility really
[40:49] really comes in and you see that there's
[40:52] the only good that's in me is is from
[40:54] God.
[40:56] So now you're a Christian. You get
[40:58] baptized. You make a commitment to the
[41:00] Lord and you have a promise that not
[41:03] only you have a promise of eternal life,
[41:07] but you also have that hope and that
[41:09] promise of healing. You have that
[41:12] promise of reconciliation,
[41:14] of restoration. A lot of things come
[41:19] with this hope of Christ. It comes in
[41:21] and it gives you, it encourages you. And
[41:24] you shall inherit the earth and now
[41:26] you're heirs of Christ. And I didn't get
[41:29] to it this morning. I really wanted to.
[41:31] You are adopted sons and daughters of
[41:36] God.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Now you have an inheritance. Brother
[41:41] Lyle, I loved what he did if you were
[41:43] there on Wednesday night when he was
[41:45] talking about brother Jeremy and he had
[41:47] the girls there and he went back there
[41:51] and he talked about their adoption
[41:55] and how these kids it doesn't matter
[41:58] what they were in the past
[42:01] now they are from the tribe of Bagot
[42:06] is what brother Lyall said and they are
[42:11] they are heirs
[42:14] to the inheritance. They are part of the
[42:16] family.
[42:18] It doesn't matter if they were born in
[42:20] or adopted in. And that's how we are. We
[42:24] are heirs to that promise that God gave
[42:27] to Abraham.
[42:29] And we are sons of Abraham. We may may
[42:32] not be his descendants, but we are
[42:34] adopted
[42:36] sons and daughters, which means we have
[42:38] the same inheritance as someone in the
[42:41] bloodline.
[42:43] Blessed are they which do hunger and
[42:45] thirst after righteousness, for they
[42:48] shall be filled. Now you've given your
[42:50] heart to the Lord, and now you have this
[42:53] hungering and thirsting after a right
[42:55] relationship with God. And you receive
[42:59] that relationship. And now it's no more
[43:01] about legalism which I talked about the
[43:03] Old Testament. Thou shalt not. Now it's
[43:07] all promises. And thou shalt
[43:11] receive.
[43:12] Now you have reached really you have
[43:14] reached perfection. Not perfection in
[43:16] yourself, but you have reached the one
[43:19] who is perfect and you have reached a
[43:22] relationship with that perfect one.
[43:26] Verse number seven, blessed are the
[43:28] merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
[43:31] Now that you're, now that you're moving
[43:34] on this Christian way, now you are
[43:36] reflecting Jesus Christ out of you. He
[43:39] gave you mercy. Now you give mercy to
[43:43] others. Like that guy driving that
[43:45] Ozemobile, he got under my skin, giving
[43:47] me the little honk when he turned. He
[43:50] wanted that little last word.
[43:55] Don't do that. You don't need the last
[43:57] word. Be merciful.
[44:00] Even if you are right, and we're always
[44:04] right
[44:06] when in our minds, forgot the part, in
[44:08] our minds,
[44:11] be merciful.
[44:13] Don't give the little honk as you're
[44:15] turning. Don't get the last word. Be
[44:19] merciful,
[44:20] for then you will obtain mercy.
[44:25] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
[44:26] shall see God.
[44:29] Now the puress
[44:31] in your heart is that desire
[44:34] for puress. So then you can stand, you
[44:36] can get on your knees or you can stand
[44:38] before the Lord and say, "Lord, you know
[44:39] my heart. I'm a sinner. I've done wrong.
[44:44] I'm constantly doing wrong. I'm
[44:45] constantly messing up. But Lord, you
[44:47] know my heart. You know that I'm trying
[44:49] to do right. You know that being right
[44:52] with you, Lord, is more important than
[44:54] anything else in the world to me. And if
[44:57] I could just find your will, Father, if
[44:59] I could just know your will, then Lord,
[45:02] I'll do it. I'll do everything I can to
[45:04] do it. And then you fail. You miss the
[45:06] Lord. But then you come back and you can
[45:09] stand with a pure heart, perfect before
[45:12] God. You can stand before him and say,
[45:15] "Lord, you know my heart. With all of
[45:17] your sins, everything that you've done,
[45:19] you can still stand perfect before God
[45:22] because you are worshiping a perfect
[45:26] God, a perfect sacrifice,
[45:29] and you have that relationship with that
[45:31] perfect one.
[45:34] Blessed are the peacemakers,
[45:36] for they shall be called the children of
[45:38] God."
[45:40] Friends, with a Christian, if we are
[45:42] truly Christians, just our presence
[45:47] brings peace. It brings Christian love
[45:50] to any situation wherever we are. If we
[45:54] walk into a room and and there's there's
[45:56] anxiety or or there's turmoil there, we
[45:59] should bring in the peace of God with us
[46:02] and make peace. Blessed are the
[46:04] peacemakers, for they shall be called
[46:06] the children of of God. You don't add to
[46:09] the gossip. You stop the gossip when
[46:12] others are saying negative. You you turn
[46:15] the congre conversation positive
[46:18] and it's and you develop a reputation
[46:21] for doing this. And this is one where I
[46:23] fail all the time and it's just like
[46:25] Lord I was negative again and then I
[46:29] have to go before him and and I I do it
[46:33] all the time more than I'm sure anyone
[46:35] else here.
[46:37] But I'll go to him. Lord, I'm sorry I
[46:39] said this. It was negative. I shouldn't
[46:42] have done it. Lord, you know my heart.
[46:43] I'm going to do better. And it's wipes
[46:47] it clean.
[46:49] Blessed are they
[46:52] which are persecuted for righteousness
[46:54] sake, for theirs is the kingdom of
[46:56] heaven. Blessed are ye when men shall
[46:58] revile you and persecute you, and shall
[47:01] shall say all manner of evil against you
[47:03] falsely for my name, for my sake. Notice
[47:06] that it says falsely.
[47:09] That doesn't mean that you suffer for
[47:11] something that you did wrong.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; You're going to suffer for what you did
[47:14] wrong and you can make the things right.
[47:16] But this right here is saying that they
[47:19] shall say all manner evil against you
[47:22] falsely
[47:24] for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding
[47:28] glad, for great is your reward in
[47:31] heaven. for so persecuted they the
[47:34] prophets which were before you. So now
[47:40] I look at these great men of old John
[47:43] Hus
[47:45] burned at the stake for trying to get
[47:48] the gospel trying to get the word of God
[47:51] into the hands of the people. William
[47:54] Tinddale burned at the stake for trying
[47:58] to get the word of God into the hands of
[48:02] the people.
[48:04] Martyrs killed. And you look at look at
[48:07] the what was celebrated today
[48:10] in this man Charlie Kirk. He was truly
[48:12] he gave his life
[48:14] to wanting to get the gospel into the
[48:18] hands of people and he didn't back down
[48:20] and he stood up for on social issues and
[48:25] it just brought out that hatred that is
[48:28] said right here that they hate you. They
[48:31] didn't hate him. They hated what he
[48:34] stood for. And they don't hate you.
[48:38] They hate you for what you stand for
[48:41] when you say no. It is wrong
[48:46] for a boy to want to be a girl or a girl
[48:48] to want to be a boy. You know, it's
[48:51] wrong to do that. I understand that you
[48:53] may be born with those weaknesses. I
[48:55] understand that that is something that
[48:57] you overcome. But I was born with sin
[49:00] that with weaknesses for sin in my life
[49:05] and I'm expected to overcome the sins in
[49:07] my life. They should be expected to
[49:10] overcome that sin in their lives. It's
[49:14] not a sin above any other sin. It's it's
[49:16] something that they can overcome. The
[49:20] Bible says that God will not tempt you
[49:23] above that which you can bear.
[49:26] So you can overcome it. I've seen it.
[49:29] I've seen people overcome that and live
[49:32] a a heterosexual life. I've seen it. So
[49:37] you can.
[49:38] But they hate it when someone stands up
[49:41] for what the word says
[49:44] and they stand they stand on values and
[49:46] they hate that so much so that they
[49:49] would kill that person or it might be
[49:52] abortion standing up for killing an
[49:54] unborn child. Standing up for
[49:59] I mean really preaching the gospel of
[50:01] Jesus Christ as a
[50:06] exclusive
[50:08] exclusive gospel, which means you cannot
[50:14] be saved.
[50:17] You can't be saved
[50:20] if you don't accept Christ. That may
[50:23] sound very harsh, but I'm quoting Jesus.
[50:27] He said, "I am the way, the truth, and
[50:32] the life." I am the way, the way to God,
[50:36] the truth. All right. The word. I am the
[50:40] way, the truth, and the life. He's the
[50:42] one that brings life. And no one can
[50:46] come to the father except by me.
[50:52] That is an exclusive gospel. We try to
[50:54] make it exclusive with denominational
[50:56] differences and all this stuff and well,
[50:57] you have to be this to be bride and you
[50:59] have to. No, no, no, no, no. There's one
[51:01] exclusive way and that is through the
[51:03] man Christ Jesus. There is one mediator
[51:06] between God and man, the man Christ
[51:08] Jesus. And when you say that, you are
[51:13] hated.
[51:15] So much so that people will
[51:21] kill as many people as they can,
[51:23] hijacking airplanes and running running
[51:25] them into buildings
[51:28] and and going into marketplaces and
[51:29] blowing themselves up because they hate
[51:32] that so much.
[51:36] And and it is not because they hate the
[51:39] person that they they are killing. They
[51:41] hate what they think that person stands
[51:43] for. And here we say that blessed are
[51:47] you when men shall revile you and
[51:49] persecute you and shall say all manner
[51:51] of evil against you falsely for my sake.
[51:53] Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[51:55] is your reward in heaven for so
[51:57] persecuted they the prophets which were
[52:00] before you. I wanted to give a little
[52:03] review on that and
[52:07] I'm looking forward to continuing on
[52:09] this sermon on the mount and it is
[52:12] tremendous and and it started out good
[52:16] in reading this first part of Matthew
[52:18] and it just gets better and better and
[52:20] deeper and you know what Jesus does
[52:21] first he says okay here's how here's how
[52:23] you come to the Lord and here's the
[52:25] blessings associated with it and then
[52:28] boy does he raise the bar. I mean, raise
[52:32] the bar almost
[52:34] to where it's impossible,
[52:37] but it is something that we should
[52:39] strive for. Be perfect. Jesus says, "As
[52:44] your father which is in heaven is
[52:46] perfect." I believe he's saying, "Have
[52:48] that perfect relationship with him."
[52:50] You'll sin, but then you'll repent of
[52:53] those sins. Amen.
[52:56] Do you have testimonies? I hope so
[52:57] because I'm going to grab the microphone
[52:59] and I will I will um I'll go into the
[53:02] audience and I'll start with brother
[53:04] Silas there. Let me let me get a
[53:06] microphone.
[53:11] I was talking about you, brother Silas
[53:14] to someone earlier today that maybe I
[53:17] forgot. Sister Shirley maybe. And uh I
[53:19] talked with Sister Shirley. She's the
[53:21] first one here. So she sits here and
[53:24] she's here like 45 minutes earlier and I
[53:26] always ask her, "What do you think? Is
[53:29] it getting better or not?" And she tells
[53:30] me, "But I was talking about you and uh
[53:35] how much your dad meant to me and the
[53:38] the encouragement he gave me when I used
[53:40] to minister, brother Brads, and he just
[53:42] always meant so much to me."
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Well, I have two short testimonies. Uh
[53:50] the first one is I fought for a long
[53:52] time to get Sundays off and Lord made
[53:56] away and I'm so grateful for that. Now
[54:00] the second one is I have well I had I
[54:04] should say I had this condition called
[54:07] diabetic neuropathy and if you don't
[54:09] know what neuropathy is it's where the
[54:12] diabetes damages the nerves in your body
[54:15] specifically
[54:17] your feet. It could be your hands but
[54:19] mostly your feet
[54:21] and it causes all kinds of pain and just
[54:23] terrible discomfort. I've had this
[54:24] condition for at least five years.
[54:28] And this year it had gotten worse.
[54:31] And I decided about a month ago that I
[54:34] was tired of it. And I put the prayer
[54:36] cloth in my wallet.
[54:39] And a couple weeks later, I had a dream.
[54:42] I dreamed that I put that prayer cloth
[54:44] in my wallet
[54:46] and the feeling returned to my feet. And
[54:49] then the pain went away.
[54:53] And it proved it was the big problem
[54:56] foot was my right foot. My wife can tell
[54:58] you that it was just horrible
[55:02] and
[55:04] the feeling is returning to it slowly
[55:06] but surely. I feel it.
[55:09] And lately, the devil's attacked me with
[55:11] a pretty serious infection in my left
[55:13] foot. Y'all pray for me. I've had tests
[55:17] done on it,
[55:19] but I don't care what those tests say
[55:20] because I'm healed anyway.
[55:23] They could cut it off and I'll still say
[55:25] I'm healed.
[55:27] Well, God bless y'all. I just want to
[55:29] tell you that.
[55:31] [Applause]
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Bless you sisters.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you brothers and sisters. I
[55:41] had two brief testimony.
[55:45] Last the past two weeks I was at work
[55:50] just busy with our job doing our work
[55:54] and I was on the hallway walking going
[55:59] to the office and one of the client was
[56:04] behind me walking and in my heart
[56:08] something told me move away that person
[56:12] to pass.
[56:14] I I I didn't do right away but again I
[56:17] can feel that and then I just backed up
[56:20] on the post of the hallway and then the
[56:24] person the client passed and he walked
[56:27] like I was going to the office. So it
[56:30] was like two doors before I reached to
[56:32] the office and on the office we normally
[56:34] put a code to go into. So when I was
[56:39] near the office to boot a code, the
[56:41] client was in front of me and he
[56:43] attacked the staff that was coming
[56:46] facing me. So I watched the scenario
[56:49] there. They were fighting, grabbing one
[56:52] another and I just want to thank God
[56:56] that he protect me and he protect us all
[56:59] the time.
[57:01] So that was my first testimony. Second
[57:04] testimony
[57:05] on last Thursday I was at work and
[57:10] I I they normally give us like we work
[57:15] with people with substance use substance
[57:18] use and people normally they normally
[57:21] give them the cigarette to smoke. So
[57:24] they told me to go like get a lighter
[57:27] and a cigarette to go give it to them.
[57:30] And I said no this is not right we
[57:33] should and then they say why and they
[57:35] say we should do these things fearing
[57:37] God because I know it's wrong we should
[57:39] help them to stop we are not here to
[57:41] encourage giving them so they say no and
[57:46] the team lead was mad with me for some
[57:49] reason he text the boss and the boss
[57:51] start sending me a text message very
[57:54] aggressive but I didn't respond it so
[57:57] why so I I didn't do it So I stand with
[58:00] my farm but on that hard situation
[58:05] I told I I should listen the word of God
[58:08] or something. So I went on WhatsApp
[58:13] in Kenya on back of my country. They
[58:17] normally pastor text uh uh messages on
[58:20] the on the WhatsApp and the the
[58:22] communication on WhatsApp. So I went to
[58:25] read. So I wanted to read to to see it
[58:29] was really comforting to me and
[58:31] encouraging for my situation that I was
[58:33] in. So this is how it went and I just
[58:37] popped up and I went on it right away.
[58:39] So they say now where's the children of
[58:42] Abraham this morning? You ministers that
[58:46] are afraid of you are afraid. You are
[58:48] afraid of your bread and water on the
[58:51] street. If you live that pablo, where's
[58:54] your faith? David said, "I was once
[58:58] young and now I'm old. I have never seen
[59:01] the Russians forsaken or his seed
[59:04] pecking bread." Don't be afraid. Stay
[59:08] true to Christ.
[59:10] But unbelief will catch reasons that
[59:14] what that is what it did. Now you get
[59:18] it. Unbelief relies reasons. present day
[59:22] things. Faith won't do it. Faith looks
[59:26] at the word but but faith places itself
[59:31] upon unmovable rock. God is eternal
[59:35] word. Amen. Faith don't look at reason.
[59:39] I don't care how much you can show it
[59:42] will be better. If the word says no,
[59:46] faith rest there. That is the sanctuary
[59:49] of faith resting place.
[59:56] [Applause]
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; I just want to talk about um how God is
[1:00:05] so mindful even when we're not asking
[1:00:07] him for help. Last Monday I came to
[1:00:10] church to pick up some three cases of
[1:00:12] bananas that were in the freezer from
[1:00:13] the church pantry. And um the freezer's
[1:00:17] kind of deep. It's a test freezer and
[1:00:18] I'm kind of short so it's kind of hard
[1:00:20] to pull them up out of the freezer. So
[1:00:23] in my own ability, trusting myself that
[1:00:25] I could do it, you know, I was like,
[1:00:26] "Oh, I'm going to take out, you know,
[1:00:28] bundles of bananas at a time and put
[1:00:29] them in the car and, you know, slowly
[1:00:31] fill up the car with bananas."
[1:00:33] And then it was really hot and my neck
[1:00:35] pain will be exacerbated by the you
[1:00:38] humidity and the heat. And here I was
[1:00:40] driving and you know just got here to
[1:00:41] church and lo and behold the Lord gave
[1:00:45] me an angel
[1:00:47] a tall dark handsome angel by the name
[1:00:49] of brother Locer. He was coming out of
[1:00:51] the church and I just said, "Brother
[1:00:54] Locer, can you help me load up the
[1:00:55] bananas?" And in less than a minute he
[1:00:58] loaded up the bananas. But you know
[1:01:00] what? When I drove away, the thing that
[1:01:02] came to my mind is not to trust my own
[1:01:04] abilities. That God is mindful even when
[1:01:08] we're not asking.
[1:01:10] He knew that I needed help with those
[1:01:12] bananas, you know. So, I want to just
[1:01:14] give God the praise and thank you,
[1:01:16] brother Locer, for putting up with me
[1:01:18] and, you know, always asking help for
[1:01:20] something and doing something or, you
[1:01:22] know, but God is so mindful and I'm so
[1:01:24] grateful and my heart was filled with
[1:01:26] gratitude, you know. Thank you, brother.
[1:01:30] [Applause]
[1:01:35] Mary Lee,
[1:01:37] tell tell when the uh when you got help
[1:01:38] with the water bottles.
[1:01:41] The water bottles when you were filling
[1:01:42] up the water bottles and you said,
[1:01:44] "Lord, I I just can't." It's the same
[1:01:46] similar to
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; I told that um but
[1:01:52] um
[1:01:54] I was, you know, it's hard to be a
[1:01:56] widow. you know, you don't really want
[1:01:58] to be, but you are. And I kind of liked
[1:02:03] having people do things for me,
[1:02:05] especially my husband. And um I had
[1:02:08] these five gallon heavy bottles. And I
[1:02:13] had, of course, four of them, you know,
[1:02:14] I just don't have one. I have four. And
[1:02:17] so I put them in the back seat and and I
[1:02:20] was just in the car driving. A lot of
[1:02:22] times I talk to the Lord that way. And
[1:02:25] uh I said, "Lord, it just would be so
[1:02:28] wonderful
[1:02:30] if I could have some tall, strong man
[1:02:33] help me when I get into this little
[1:02:35] place where I get the water."
[1:02:37] And if it didn't just happen exactly
[1:02:40] like that, I just I just told him, I
[1:02:44] said, "You're like an angel because I
[1:02:46] really need to help." And here you are,
[1:02:48] strong, tall man. And I asked for
[1:02:51] someone to help me. And I didn't even
[1:02:53] have to ask him. He said, "Can I help
[1:02:55] you?" It was just like the Lord. And you
[1:02:59] know, it's so true when it says in the
[1:03:01] Bible that he takes care of the widows
[1:03:04] and the orphans and he takes care of me
[1:03:07] all the time. And honestly, sometimes I
[1:03:10] tell him, "I'm sorry to bother you
[1:03:12] again, but I can't find my purse. Will
[1:03:15] you show me what I did with it?" And and
[1:03:19] you know, that's the last thing I was
[1:03:21] going to tell this, but I I was really
[1:03:24] in a panic. You know, when a you lose
[1:03:26] your purse and your kids think you're
[1:03:27] going a little nuts and so you try
[1:03:29] really hard to just be really
[1:03:30] responsible and everything. And so I I
[1:03:34] just thought I'm to my last wits end.
[1:03:38] And so I knelt down by my bed
[1:03:43] and I just said, "Lord, I'm sorry to
[1:03:45] bother you again, but I can't find my
[1:03:48] person. Will you help me?" And you know
[1:03:50] it was like I got up from that position.
[1:03:53] I went right over to my ammoir. I bent
[1:03:56] down, opened up the two little things,
[1:03:58] two little drawers, and there it was.
[1:04:01] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:09] Next.
[1:04:12] Which one are you gonna tell, Lydia?
[1:04:17] Okay, let me tell one. Come, come up
[1:04:19] here, come here, come here. So, we
[1:04:22] baptized a young man.
[1:04:26] Uh, is Justin is Justin here? I don't
[1:04:28] see Justin. We baptized a young man last
[1:04:30] Sunday and he gave the testimony.
[1:04:34] First of all, I'd witnessed to him up up
[1:04:36] in the front of the church and and he
[1:04:39] was uh they were just kids and not the
[1:04:44] most respectful kids, but they were they
[1:04:45] were okay. And I uh witnessed to him and
[1:04:49] and they just I didn't witness to them.
[1:04:51] I I told them they had to leave and
[1:04:54] they're like, "Okay, well, whatever."
[1:04:55] So, I turn around and I start to leave
[1:04:57] and something told me, "Go back."
[1:05:02] And I turned around and I said, "Hey
[1:05:03] boys, let me tell you a story." And I
[1:05:06] had the two young men sit down and I
[1:05:09] told him a Bible story.
[1:05:12] And Justin locked on to this Bible
[1:05:17] story. So then we stayed in touch. He
[1:05:20] started coming to church. He left for a
[1:05:22] while, moved away for a while, and then
[1:05:24] he came back and he texted me and he
[1:05:28] said, he said, "Pastor," he said, "Uh,
[1:05:31] I don't know if you remember me." He
[1:05:34] then he told me, "I'm the person that
[1:05:35] was loitering out front. You know, you
[1:05:37] were gigging us out and all this." And
[1:05:39] and and then he said, "I want to be
[1:05:42] baptized."
[1:05:44] And I said, "Okay, do you want to talk
[1:05:45] about it? You know, are you sure?" Um,
[1:05:48] and he said, "No, I don't want to talk
[1:05:51] about it." Yes, I am sure. He says, "I
[1:05:53] want to be baptized." And I said,
[1:05:54] "Okay." I said, "Well, I'll baptize you
[1:05:58] on on Sunday morning," which was a few
[1:06:00] days after this. And so then he gets up
[1:06:04] there. Now, you were all there. He gets
[1:06:06] up in the baptismal. And the title of my
[1:06:09] sermon that day was the temptation of
[1:06:12] Jesus.
[1:06:14] Well, Justin asked the Lord. He said,
[1:06:16] "Lord, if this is your will that I am to
[1:06:20] be baptized and to be here, Lord, will
[1:06:24] you have the pastor preach on the
[1:06:28] temptation of Jesus?"
[1:06:31] I mean, amazing.
[1:06:34] And I preached on the temptation of
[1:06:38] Jesus. He just knew. But there was
[1:06:40] something going on behind the scenes
[1:06:44] that none of us knew about
[1:06:47] and it was a prayer. James says the
[1:06:51] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:06:53] man avail.
[1:06:55] There was somebody praying in the
[1:06:57] background. Lydia, I want you to give
[1:06:58] your testimony.
[1:07:01] So, um, Brother Daniel had told me about
[1:07:03] the two guys on the front. And it had
[1:07:06] been months, you know, quite a while
[1:07:08] since, um, Justin had come to back to
[1:07:11] church. And I just felt led to pray for
[1:07:14] him. And I said, "Lord, would you bring
[1:07:16] Johnny back to church and save him?" And
[1:07:20] I think that was a Thursday or a Friday.
[1:07:22] And that Sunday, he walks into church.
[1:07:24] And usually when people have not been to
[1:07:25] church in a long time, takes me a moment
[1:07:27] to like, "Oh, that's them." As soon as I
[1:07:30] saw his red hair, he had changed kind of
[1:07:31] bit. And as soon as I saw his red hair,
[1:07:34] I'm like, Johnny, that's Johnny. And
[1:07:37] then he gets baptized. And I was like,
[1:07:39] wow. You know, that was kind of really
[1:07:41] cool.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:50] So, um, a few weeks ago, probably about
[1:08:52] a month ago, we were heading out on our
[1:08:54] trip to go to North Carolina and there
[1:08:57] was something I needed. I didn't have it
[1:08:59] on my previous trips, but I had finally
[1:09:01] gotten one and I tucked it in my, you
[1:09:05] know, top drawer of my dresser and I
[1:09:07] couldn't find it. I was like, "Lord, you
[1:09:09] have to help me find this." And the
[1:09:12] verse I always remember is a promise in
[1:09:15] the Bible. It says, "If you ask, you
[1:09:17] shall receive." I said, "Lord,
[1:09:20] I'm asking. I need this for my trip. I
[1:09:23] had already packed my backpack
[1:09:25] and
[1:09:27] something I think fell off my bed
[1:09:30] because I had placed stuff at the end of
[1:09:32] my bed. I was already in bed and I
[1:09:34] prayed this prayer and I had to taken it
[1:09:35] out of my backpack before getting into
[1:09:37] bed because for some reason and it fell
[1:09:40] off the bed. So I went got up and picked
[1:09:43] up the stuff and it was in the stuff. I
[1:09:47] did not pack it in the backpack. I had
[1:09:48] not touched it. I had not seen it and it
[1:09:51] was there. I was like, "Wow, thank you,
[1:09:54] Lord." And I didn't have to go digging
[1:09:56] for it the next morning.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; How many of you want long young Lydia
[1:10:05] praying for you?
[1:10:09] I see a little prayer warrior forming
[1:10:11] there. Next, Sister Sarah
[1:10:22] I meant to give this testimony quite a
[1:10:24] while ago, but I guess tonight is good
[1:10:27] for it. Um so a couple weeks back I had
[1:10:30] the church pray for my catheter my port
[1:10:32] because there had been an issue come up
[1:10:34] over the weekend and um without going
[1:10:38] into any technical details it was really
[1:10:41] looking like there was a breach in it
[1:10:42] where there would be that either the
[1:10:44] line was cut or there was a hole
[1:10:46] somewhere basically rendering the
[1:10:48] catheter useless and it meant a surgery
[1:10:51] and that was a very very very bad week
[1:10:53] to have a surgery. So that Saturday, um,
[1:10:58] I sent a prayer request to my parents
[1:11:00] for everyone to pray that that would not
[1:11:03] be the case. I know what I saw. And my
[1:11:05] nurse, uh, I have a longtime nurse
[1:11:07] that's been working with me for quite a
[1:11:09] while. She had checked it out during
[1:11:11] treatment. The treatment was just
[1:11:13] horrible. We couldn't even get a
[1:11:14] treatment that weekend. And I was pretty
[1:11:17] much kind of on pins and needles all
[1:11:19] weekend long because we both kind of
[1:11:21] knew what we were looking at. But by the
[1:11:23] next treatment to check it out,
[1:11:26] everything was completely normal. There
[1:11:28] was no problem whatsoever. And I really
[1:11:32] absolutely believe God miraculously
[1:11:35] touched that catheter because I knew
[1:11:37] what that we knew what we were looking
[1:11:39] at and we were both just going, "No, no,
[1:11:42] no, no, no, no." So, um I just want to
[1:11:45] thank the church for praying because I
[1:11:47] know there's so many people that um
[1:11:49] immediately got in contact with my
[1:11:51] family saying they were praying and
[1:11:53] there's just been so many battles this
[1:11:55] summer, this year. It's been very
[1:11:57] difficult. So, that was one thing. The
[1:12:00] second thing though was pretty
[1:12:01] remarkable to me. Um, as you guys
[1:12:04] probably have known over the years of my
[1:12:05] testimonies, I have struggled constantly
[1:12:07] with my blood pressure. And it's always
[1:12:10] very high and very uncontrolled.
[1:12:13] And I was medicated pretty heavily for
[1:12:16] many years for it with very little
[1:12:19] success. It baffled the doctors all the
[1:12:21] time. So, the other day I was going
[1:12:24] through old paperwork of mine and I came
[1:12:27] across a journal entry um on some piece
[1:12:30] of paper that I had written. And
[1:12:31] apparently I had I forgot all about
[1:12:33] this. I just found it and it was dated
[1:12:36] from June of 2017.
[1:12:39] And I started reading it kind of
[1:12:41] figuring out like what is this? And it
[1:12:44] was just um like right in the middle of
[1:12:47] a journal entry of me talking about how
[1:12:49] frustrated I was at that time with my
[1:12:53] blood pressure and these two doctors
[1:12:56] that I was being treated by. One doctor
[1:12:58] would tell me one thing and prescribe
[1:13:01] certain medication and then the other
[1:13:03] doctor would see me say the exact
[1:13:05] opposite thing and I'm recording this,
[1:13:08] you know, in this entry and then give
[1:13:10] more medication. I think I was on five
[1:13:13] different blood pressure medications at
[1:13:15] the time and it was, you know, just
[1:13:18] really out there. And the one, you know,
[1:13:20] one of those doctors, so I'm writing
[1:13:21] this down apparently about how he told
[1:13:25] me very vehemently, I would never ever
[1:13:27] ever get off of these blood pressure
[1:13:30] medications. I would always need to be
[1:13:32] adding more or changing them. And of
[1:13:35] course, the side effects are terrible.
[1:13:37] And this is never something I wanted to
[1:13:39] keep doing. I want healing. Always
[1:13:41] believing for that. So, at the end of
[1:13:44] this journal entry, I wrote like this
[1:13:47] whole paragraph
[1:13:49] of confessions of faith for healing. And
[1:13:53] I put things like my kidneys will
[1:13:56] recover their full function in Jesus
[1:13:58] name. I will not need, you know, um
[1:14:01] phosphorus binders. My phosphorus will
[1:14:03] be in a healthy normal range in Jesus
[1:14:05] name. And one of the things that's in
[1:14:07] this list was I will wean off of every
[1:14:10] one of these medications in Jesus name.
[1:14:14] Now mind you I'm sitting here in 2025
[1:14:16] reading this. It's dated from June 2017.
[1:14:20] In 2020 I weaned off of every single one
[1:14:25] of those medications
[1:14:28] for a year. And it just hit me like kind
[1:14:30] of like a lightning bolt like wait that
[1:14:32] happened. That already happened. My
[1:14:35] heart was already healed in 2014. Like
[1:14:37] there's so many things. So here I am
[1:14:40] sitting and I'll mind you I don't
[1:14:42] understand why God does things the way
[1:14:45] he does or why he allows things because
[1:14:48] I do remember in 2021
[1:14:52] when I had to go back on medication and
[1:14:55] how incredibly frustrated
[1:14:58] and angry and confused I was to have to
[1:15:02] do that and how much I fought
[1:15:04] spiritually and medically about that.
[1:15:08] and I didn't know what to do about it.
[1:15:10] But from this year back in December of
[1:15:13] 2024, things were at that crazy limit
[1:15:15] again. Only this time it was a little
[1:15:17] less medication. But I was to the point
[1:15:19] where we're out of options. I don't have
[1:15:22] anything else to do. The doctors don't
[1:15:24] know what else to do. And I started
[1:15:27] praying again. I said, "Lord, there was
[1:15:29] a time that you got me off these
[1:15:31] medications, and I'm going to start
[1:15:33] confessing that same prayer again every
[1:15:36] day I take these meds. I'm weaning off
[1:15:38] of these medications because I no longer
[1:15:40] need them because my blood pressure is
[1:15:41] in a healthy normal range because by his
[1:15:44] stripes I'm healed. Sounds like a
[1:15:45] mantra, but that's what I'm saying. So,
[1:15:48] all of this year, I'm in that process
[1:15:50] and I've gotten my meds almost to where
[1:15:53] they're completely off again. And I just
[1:15:56] want to praise God for that, for low,
[1:15:59] healthy blood pressure. And I said,
[1:16:00] Lord, let it come to stay this time. I
[1:16:02] don't want to do this again. But I just
[1:16:04] found that very miraculous. And God
[1:16:08] knows the time. He knows the when and
[1:16:10] the how. And he knows the why, you know,
[1:16:13] because I don't know the why or the how
[1:16:16] or any of these things. But I just want
[1:16:18] to give praise to God again and thank
[1:16:20] you guys always for praying for me
[1:16:22] because God is doing things. It doesn't
[1:16:24] look like it sometimes, but he really is
[1:16:26] moving and helping me through it. God
[1:16:28] bless you.
[1:16:30] [Applause]
[1:16:36] I'm gonna just I'm gonna have one more
[1:16:38] and then you give your testimony and
[1:16:40] song after that and then we'll continue
[1:16:42] on with testimonies.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you pastors. I know God bless you
[1:16:48] brothers and sisters. Um I get nervous
[1:16:51] speaking so um
[1:16:54] well there's there's many thing that the
[1:16:56] Lord has done in my life um and really
[1:17:00] changed me. Um, one thing is that I've
[1:17:04] always hearing the testimonies of the
[1:17:07] brothers and sisters. Um, I we all have
[1:17:10] individual um, experiences. Um, we each
[1:17:14] have individual souls. And I, uh, I
[1:17:17] battled a lot of anxiety. I still do.
[1:17:20] Um, you could see I'm kind of shaking
[1:17:23] even now. Um, just asking for the
[1:17:26] congregation to pray for me um, for my
[1:17:28] anxiety. Um,
[1:17:31] not depressed, just, you know, I feel
[1:17:34] that the enemy has been attacking me a
[1:17:35] lot uh lately, and if I don't have
[1:17:38] prayer, well, I need my saints and
[1:17:40] brothers and sisters to uh really pray
[1:17:43] for me. Um, and
[1:17:47] I I love my pastor. This is brother
[1:17:49] Brandham's mentions, you know, this is a
[1:17:50] place of refuge, you know. Uh, this is
[1:17:54] this is my place of refuge. And if it
[1:17:58] wasn't for our pastor, I probably be in
[1:18:01] a bad shape, probably in prison or on
[1:18:04] the streets or probably even worse, you
[1:18:07] know, to tell the truth because God
[1:18:10] demands truth, right? He demands
[1:18:13] correction, truth, and he's also kind
[1:18:16] and and he gives comfort, too. So, I've
[1:18:18] been asking the Lord just to comfort me.
[1:18:20] Um, I sing to the Lord alone in my room
[1:18:23] and read the word and and I just tell
[1:18:26] him, "Just embrace me." Sometimes we
[1:18:28] just need to Lord, just give me a hug.
[1:18:30] And I feel it. I feel I feel his
[1:18:32] presence. And believe me, it's I'll cry,
[1:18:34] but it's a it's a it's a good cry. And
[1:18:39] my sister here, you I see you off the
[1:18:41] side of my periph.
[1:18:44] And um I really uh admire that about
[1:18:48] you're a real daughter of God. And and
[1:18:50] all of my sisters and brothers here. And
[1:18:53] I just I don't know really what to say.
[1:18:54] I'm kind of nervous, but I just want to
[1:18:57] um thank everybody um and for your for
[1:19:01] your love, for your patience with me,
[1:19:03] for your kindness, and also um yeah, for
[1:19:07] having a wonderful pastor and the
[1:19:10] musicians, everybody, you know, Brother
[1:19:11] Josiah has been helping me and brother
[1:19:13] Daniel Jr. on down, brother Aaron, I can
[1:19:17] go name, but it takes it takes a body,
[1:19:20] right? It takes it takes not just one
[1:19:22] individual. That's uh we all got to come
[1:19:24] in one accord all together in in in
[1:19:27] unity with perfect love, you know,
[1:19:30] because God is love. At the end, it's
[1:19:31] love, you know, and we got to have love
[1:19:33] because without love, you know, we don't
[1:19:36] love the Lord. It's it's very simple.
[1:19:39] And if you don't love the Lord, well,
[1:19:41] and we do love the Lord, and that's why
[1:19:44] we're here. Um, God bless you, brothers
[1:19:47] and sisters.
[1:19:51] You know, I appreciate it
[1:19:54] when somebody just gives a testimony and
[1:19:56] gives thanks for what we have. And let's
[1:19:59] not ever take it for granted because we
[1:20:01] do have something special. Brother
[1:20:02] Jonathan, thank you.
[1:20:18] Before
[1:20:22] I sing, Daniel's going to figure out how
[1:20:24] to raise that up. I'm not strong enough.
[1:20:30] Well, uh, this last week,
[1:20:33] uh, dear friend and pastor, Brother
[1:20:35] Biscll, passed away. He's my pastor for
[1:20:39] almost all my life. He baptized me and
[1:20:42] my brother. Um, and I just wanted to
[1:20:44] share. I wrote a few things down I
[1:20:47] wanted to share about him.
[1:20:49] A lot of people here might not know him.
[1:20:51] You might know him, but I just wanted to
[1:20:52] share some things maybe some people
[1:20:55] didn't know. Born in 1934, died in 2025.
[1:21:00] Um, the first thing I would say about
[1:21:03] Brother Biscll is that he made time.
[1:21:09] Cloverdale Bible Way exists because
[1:21:12] Brother Biscll made time for the youth
[1:21:14] in southern British Columbia in the
[1:21:17] 1970s and 80s.
[1:21:20] It was just young people in his house
[1:21:23] talking about the Lord. And they called
[1:21:26] it the Bible Way House.
[1:21:29] And you can still drive by
[1:21:32] and see the Bible way house where a
[1:21:35] group of young people hooked on drugs,
[1:21:38] alcoholics,
[1:21:41] family trouble, every every every type
[1:21:44] of broken inside that house all coming
[1:21:48] to the Lord in his living room.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; This is this is a funny thing. Southern
[1:21:53] British Columbia is uh probably the most
[1:21:55] expensive place to live in the world.
[1:21:58] and they bought that house for $14,752.
[1:22:02] That's brother Biscll's words. He knew
[1:22:05] the exact he knew all the way to the to
[1:22:07] the scent how much they spent on that on
[1:22:09] that house. But that's how that that's
[1:22:12] how that started.
[1:22:14] And brother Biscll wasn't a pastor at
[1:22:16] that time. He sacrificed his career to
[1:22:19] become a pastor.
[1:22:22] He was very very successful and could
[1:22:24] have been even more successful had he
[1:22:26] not left his businesses to be a pastor.
[1:22:31] I I just say this. I think he could have
[1:22:33] been the prime minister. I think he
[1:22:35] would have been a good one too. He could
[1:22:38] have retired young
[1:22:40] and gone to the beach or to the
[1:22:42] mountains.
[1:22:44] Instead of that,
[1:22:46] he slept on planks of wood in third
[1:22:49] world countries.
[1:22:51] got arrested in China, went to the
[1:22:54] natives in northern and central British
[1:22:55] Columbia to give the gospel to them. As
[1:22:58] I said, he baptized me and my brother.
[1:23:01] He was a true gentleman.
[1:23:04] He was giving in wisdom, giving in his
[1:23:07] personal time, giving in resources,
[1:23:13] fantastic guitar player,
[1:23:17] preacher, missionary, songwriter,
[1:23:20] husband, father, grandfather,
[1:23:23] greatgrandfather,
[1:23:25] great greatgrandfather,
[1:23:28] giving of all of his life to the gospel.
[1:23:33] And I said I said a minute ago he was
[1:23:36] giving of his resources.
[1:23:39] I mean over six figures
[1:23:43] over the years. Six figures of his money
[1:23:45] and more just given away to people in
[1:23:49] need. People who were going to lose
[1:23:51] their homes and properties. Now let me
[1:23:53] let me clarify. He didn't buy people's
[1:23:56] houses so that they could still live in
[1:23:58] them. He would give them the money so
[1:24:00] they didn't lose their house from the
[1:24:02] bank
[1:24:03] on multiple occasions.
[1:24:06] He cared for those those uh the song I'm
[1:24:09] going to sing is called Little Ones.
[1:24:10] It's a song he wrote. He cared for he
[1:24:13] cared for the young people. He cared for
[1:24:15] the insignificant people, the people you
[1:24:19] maybe thought you didn't want to be your
[1:24:21] friend. He spoke so highly of them.
[1:24:25] He got into legal battles with the state
[1:24:28] of Washington
[1:24:30] all over making sure that the kids at
[1:24:34] the camp got to keep the playground.
[1:24:38] Some of you know the state of
[1:24:39] Washington's
[1:24:41] political views make it hard to own
[1:24:43] property. And there was a a ditch that
[1:24:47] ran water off the mountain and they had
[1:24:49] to have so many feet from this. and he
[1:24:52] fought with the government so that we
[1:24:54] didn't lose that playground. And they
[1:24:56] said, "Well, you can have a smaller
[1:24:58] playground." And he said, "No, so that
[1:25:00] the kids would still have a playground
[1:25:02] to play at."
[1:25:08] I'll tell this story.
[1:25:10] Uh, a good friend of ours of, uh, my
[1:25:14] family and Zeke's family brought his dad
[1:25:17] to church one time. His dad was a
[1:25:18] Pentecostal man and he was diabetic and
[1:25:21] he was 70 years old
[1:25:24] and he heard brother Biscll preach and
[1:25:28] he said that's a wonderful Christian
[1:25:30] man. He said I want that man to pray for
[1:25:32] me. After the service he came down to
[1:25:35] the front and he said I've got diabetes
[1:25:37] and I'd like you to pray for me and I
[1:25:39] believe if you pray for me that I'll be
[1:25:41] healed.
[1:25:43] And the service had already been
[1:25:44] dismissed. And brother Biscll got back
[1:25:46] up at the pullpit and he said, "This man
[1:25:48] down here believes that if we pray for
[1:25:51] him, he'll be healed." He said, 'D do I
[1:25:53] believe that he'll be healed?
[1:25:54] Absolutely. I believe the Lord will heal
[1:25:56] him of his diabetes. He got down there
[1:25:58] and prayed for him and it left him that
[1:26:01] day and that man died not being a
[1:26:03] diabetic.
[1:26:05] Incredible testimony.
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:14] In all his success, he did all of it
[1:26:17] without a formal education.
[1:26:20] He lost his mother when he was 5 years
[1:26:22] old.
[1:26:23] He gave his heart to the Lord as a
[1:26:25] teenager.
[1:26:27] And he told us that when he was young,
[1:26:30] he sat down in his room and he laid his
[1:26:33] watch and his wallet on his desk and he
[1:26:36] said, "Lord, whatever time and resources
[1:26:38] I have, I give it all to you."
[1:26:43] He said his lunch breaks were an hour
[1:26:45] long when he was a when he was a young
[1:26:47] man.
[1:26:49] They were an hour and the first half
[1:26:51] hour he dedicated in prayer to the Lord
[1:26:54] every day.
[1:26:58] I want to read a scripture that comes to
[1:27:00] mind
[1:27:03] when I think of brother Bisll.
[1:27:07] Wherefore,
[1:27:09] seeing we are also compassed about with
[1:27:12] so great a cloud of witnesses,
[1:27:15] let us lay aside every weight, and the
[1:27:18] sin which doth so easily beset us, and
[1:27:21] let us run with patience the race that
[1:27:24] is set before us, looking unto Jesus,
[1:27:28] the author and finish of our finisher of
[1:27:30] our faith, who for the joy that was set
[1:27:33] before him endured the cross, despising
[1:27:36] the shame came and is sat down at the
[1:27:38] right hand of the throne of God.
[1:27:41] For consider him that endured such
[1:27:44] contradiction of sinners against
[1:27:46] himself.
[1:27:48] I think about brother Bisl how he never
[1:27:52] quit all the way to the end. He was
[1:27:55] always a fighter and it was always for
[1:27:57] the Lord.
[1:27:59] So I'm going to sing this song.
[1:28:14] Brother Biscll wrote a course many years
[1:28:17] ago with no verses.
[1:28:20] And my dad, many of you know him, is a
[1:28:23] songwriter. And he wrote these verses to
[1:28:25] go with the course that Brother Biscll
[1:28:27] wrote as uh a gift, I guess, to Brother
[1:28:31] Biscll. but also uh something that's for
[1:28:36] all pastors,
[1:28:37] all pastors that
[1:28:40] take care of the flock,
[1:28:44] all pastors that have a heart for the
[1:28:46] lost, and most importantly, our Lord
[1:28:49] Jesus, who endured the cross for our
[1:28:52] sakes
[1:28:59] in the past of God's flock,
[1:29:03] The good shepherd with them walks
[1:29:07] and leads to waters still in pastor's
[1:29:12] green
[1:29:15] at the ending of the day.
[1:29:20] In the doorway he doth lay.
[1:29:24] If danger comes, his body stands
[1:29:28] between.
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:32] But sometimes he must lead them over
[1:29:36] rocky paths and deserts.
[1:29:40] The lie, the lion and the bear they lie
[1:29:44] and wait.
[1:29:48] But the shepherd's watchful eye.
[1:29:52] Keeps account and draws them nigh.
[1:29:56] not satisfied with only 99.
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:03] And we
[1:30:06] will not leave our little ones behind.
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:14] For our father has them in mind.
[1:30:21] Some are weak and some are feeble.
[1:30:25] Others may not feel they're able, will
[1:30:29] not leave a single one behind.
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:38] At the dawning of the age was recorded
[1:30:43] in the pages of the word, the shepherd
[1:30:47] leaves us but not alone.
[1:30:52] Because though to glory he did rise,
[1:30:56] still his spirit here abides
[1:31:00] to feed his flock and lead them safely
[1:31:04] home.
[1:31:07] And the men
[1:31:09] that he has led to act as shepherds in
[1:31:13] shepherds in hisstead have been faithful
[1:31:17] to feed them and to care.
[1:31:21] Though some have strayed and some have
[1:31:24] slept,
[1:31:26] still a visual has been kept by those
[1:31:30] shepherds who the Lord has charged to
[1:31:33] feed.
[1:31:36] And we will not leave our little ones
[1:31:41] behind,
[1:31:43] [Music]
[1:31:45] for our father has them in mind.
[1:31:53] Some are weak and some are feeble.
[1:31:56] Others may not feel their but will not
[1:32:01] leave a single one behind.
[1:32:06] Last verse.
[1:32:08] On a Friday dark and grim,
[1:32:11] as the penalty for sin, the great
[1:32:15] shepherd was struck a fatal blow.
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:22] And the sheep were scattered out,
[1:32:26] wandering, lost, and turned about,
[1:32:30] not knowing what to do or where to go.
[1:32:37] But in their darkest hour, he arose
[1:32:42] again in power and called them near and
[1:32:47] fed them from his hand.
[1:32:52] And as it happened in the past, God has
[1:32:56] acted in the last. And his little ones,
[1:33:02] he's calling to their home.
[1:33:07] And we will not leave those little ones
[1:33:12] behind.
[1:33:16] For our father has them in mind.
[1:33:23] Some are weak and some are feeble.
[1:33:27] Others may not feel they're able but
[1:33:31] will not leave a single one behind.
[1:33:35] Could you try to sing it with me? And we
[1:33:39] will not leave our little ones behind
[1:33:43] for our father.
[1:33:46] For our father has them in mind.
[1:33:52] Some are weak, some are weak, and some
[1:33:55] are feeble. Others may not feel they're
[1:34:00] able, but will not leave a single one
[1:34:04] behind.
[1:34:09] [Applause]
[1:34:17] Brother Brandham said this. He said,
[1:34:19] "Not long ago,
[1:34:21] I had the privilege of being with your
[1:34:23] pastor, Brother Biscll.
[1:34:26] We had a little trip trip together and
[1:34:28] afterwards a little hunting trip up in
[1:34:29] northern British Columbia and he told me
[1:34:31] that he was a missionary to the Indian
[1:34:33] people over there
[1:34:35] on the island and I've always wanted to
[1:34:38] help somebody who's trying to help the
[1:34:39] Indian people. I had a few experiences
[1:34:42] down in the states with speaking to the
[1:34:45] Indians, the Navajos, Apaches, and so
[1:34:47] many of them down there and find such a
[1:34:49] wonderful faith. And Brother Eddie, not
[1:34:51] underwritten by anyone, said, "Maybe
[1:34:54] sometime I've had the opportunity to
[1:34:55] come by and help you, Brother Eddie."
[1:34:57] And he said, "I'd be happy for you to do
[1:34:59] that."
[1:35:01] I uh I want to read this quote.
[1:35:09] Listen to this.
[1:35:11] Now I wish I had time wish we had about
[1:35:15] time for a few more nights or um in this
[1:35:19] lovely country and advertise it all
[1:35:21] around the churches for fellowship to
[1:35:22] come together but we can't do that. And
[1:35:24] now right away to Canada with the
[1:35:27] Indians way back up in the country. I
[1:35:30] very far away and I last fall was with a
[1:35:34] little missionary from over there. And I
[1:35:37] noticed he was out of a lovely home, but
[1:35:41] his arms under here and around was all
[1:35:45] red. And I asked him what it was. And it
[1:35:49] was where fleas and bed bugs had eat on
[1:35:52] him from being out with the Indians out
[1:35:54] there. You know, he just had to live
[1:35:56] with them. And I in Africa, I would eat
[1:36:00] just uh
[1:36:02] I don't see how in the world I could do
[1:36:04] it, but God had to help me. And that's
[1:36:06] that's the way it was. But you have to
[1:36:08] do it anyhow, you see. And so people who
[1:36:11] missionary go through a lot of things
[1:36:14] that's unpleasant. But we have to be all
[1:36:17] things to all people
[1:36:20] that we might win some to Christ. And I
[1:36:22] felt so sorry for Eddie and his children
[1:36:25] that way too. And little Eddie Biscoll
[1:36:28] and his wife, lovely woman out of a
[1:36:31] nice, lovely home. Her father owns a big
[1:36:34] company and president of it and
[1:36:36] everything. And then give their lives
[1:36:39] out there like that. It certainly takes
[1:36:42] God to do that.
[1:36:45] and brother Ed
[1:36:47] [Applause]
[1:36:56] while like in 2005 I I was diagnosed
[1:36:59] with diabetes and like in and I was
[1:37:03] taking a medicine but it was making me
[1:37:04] feel like not good and and then when I
[1:37:08] started working out the hospital in 2020
[1:37:10] they just one of the surgeons told me
[1:37:12] get off of that it's not good for you
[1:37:14] goes
[1:37:15] They say there's no cure. Why they
[1:37:17] giving you guys this stuff, right? So he
[1:37:19] said, "Just change your ways and the way
[1:37:22] you eat and stuff." And I just went in
[1:37:24] my closet. I said, "Lord, I just need
[1:37:27] you to heal me. If you could heal that
[1:37:29] woman that was bleeding for 12 years,
[1:37:30] you just touched your fringe or your
[1:37:32] garment could do the same for me." And
[1:37:35] it's already 2025 and I'm still here and
[1:37:38] I'm still alive. He's the ultimate
[1:37:40] healer. And I put all my trust in him
[1:37:42] and he's guiding me and he's blessing me
[1:37:46] teaching me not it's not about me since
[1:37:49] I've been putting people in front of me
[1:37:51] instead of man he been blessing me doors
[1:37:54] been open abundance blessing he's he's
[1:37:56] beautiful he's awesome
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; five years
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; all right one or one or two more someone
[1:38:10] sister.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Um, first I wanted to get something
[1:38:17] cleared up.
[1:38:19] I think it was last year I gave that
[1:38:22] testimony about getting wasps wasps
[1:38:24] stung on the head and the Lord got my
[1:38:28] attention about like not
[1:38:32] getting something right with my mom and
[1:38:36] I didn't tell everything
[1:38:38] and afterwards brother Daniel said I
[1:38:40] hope I wish that was the only thing I
[1:38:41] would have done but then I thought oh
[1:38:43] dear it was a whole thing
[1:38:46] so Um, the Lord brought it to my
[1:38:49] remembrance
[1:38:51] and I just have to get it all the way.
[1:38:53] Um, so what brought the attention to the
[1:38:56] pictures that I had borrowed from my mom
[1:38:58] to copy and get back to her. Um,
[1:39:03] was a little sewing book
[1:39:06] and I I wanted to use it to try to learn
[1:39:09] to sew better. So, I borrowed it to take
[1:39:11] pictures of it or I mean to copy it. I
[1:39:13] didn't have the phone to take pictures
[1:39:15] of it like we do now. I would have done
[1:39:17] that. But anyway, she could care less
[1:39:20] about the little book. She didn't even
[1:39:22] remember the book. She was worried about
[1:39:24] the pictures and that's what the Lord
[1:39:25] was trying to bring the attention to.
[1:39:27] But I should have told both of them. So,
[1:39:30] I'm sorry.
[1:39:32] And and
[1:39:41] I'm sorry.
[1:39:44] The Lord is just so faithful.
[1:39:48] We had family camp last year and I
[1:39:54] I was trying to get my finances
[1:39:56] straightened out and we had
[1:39:59] um
[1:40:02] a really slow season when the snowbirds
[1:40:04] went home and I I wasn't making any
[1:40:07] money hardly at Denny's and I didn't
[1:40:09] have enough houses to clean.
[1:40:11] So I was upside down on my bills. I a
[1:40:15] couple of you this and but so bear with
[1:40:19] me. Um anyway, so I was I had to cancel
[1:40:23] two houses to go to camp and I I thought
[1:40:26] like okay this is super irresponsible.
[1:40:30] So but I thought I need to go to camp.
[1:40:33] So I prayed almost all night because
[1:40:37] I had to hear from the Lord. And
[1:40:41] by the time and later in the morning, I
[1:40:44] I finally
[1:40:47] was done with my fast or whatever and I
[1:40:50] got up to get something to eat.
[1:40:54] The presence of the Lord passed by my
[1:40:55] way. I didn't feel it. I I just it was a
[1:40:59] revelation. I knew my bills were paid
[1:41:02] and I could go to camp.
[1:41:05] And I just started screaming and
[1:41:07] praising God because it was fun. It was
[1:41:09] over and I got to go to camp and the
[1:41:11] Lord supernaturally paid my bills.
[1:41:13] Brother Daniel gave me from the church
[1:41:16] like $500 and he didn't know what was
[1:41:18] going on. And my sister,
[1:41:22] she had a puppy that had a heart murmur
[1:41:24] that was really bad and the vet, you
[1:41:27] know, diagnosed it and everything. She
[1:41:30] was really heartbroken about it and she
[1:41:32] didn't have a clue what was going on
[1:41:34] either. And she told the Lord, "If you
[1:41:36] heal this puppy, I'll give the money
[1:41:38] that I make from it to Hope."
[1:41:45] He healed it completely. She It came
[1:41:47] back with a perfect bill of health and
[1:41:50] she sold it and sent me the money. And I
[1:41:52] was so shocked
[1:41:55] that the Lord is just so supernatural
[1:41:56] that just he does. And I reminded the
[1:41:59] Lord, you're the you own the cattle on a
[1:42:01] thousand hills. in the scripture that
[1:42:03] brother um Walters read tonight not to
[1:42:07] give any thought about what we shall eat
[1:42:08] or drink or at all that we shall be
[1:42:10] clothed
[1:42:12] and
[1:42:14] I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:42:16] nor his seed begging bread like sister
[1:42:19] Misty said and that and that he's the
[1:42:22] husband to the widow and he promised to
[1:42:25] be and he was so faithful and kept all
[1:42:28] of his promises and I just want to thank
[1:42:41] Praise the Lord. One more.
[1:42:58] I didn't really want to speak, but I
[1:43:00] feel like God wants me to. Um, so this
[1:43:04] happened a little bit ago,
[1:43:07] but I was uh one morning I was driving
[1:43:09] to work
[1:43:11] and
[1:43:13] I had this thought pop in my head that I
[1:43:16] needed to call one of my clients and
[1:43:18] invite her to coffee.
[1:43:20] And I thought,
[1:43:22] that's crazy. I've never had coffee.
[1:43:25] I've never taken this client out
[1:43:27] anywhere. So, I'm not going to do that.
[1:43:31] and
[1:43:33] driving a little bit. Well, also when I
[1:43:35] had that thought pop in my head, it
[1:43:38] named the coffee place. It's like, call
[1:43:41] so and so and invite her to coffee at
[1:43:42] Labuzz.
[1:43:44] And then I said, "No, I'm not doing
[1:43:45] that." So anyways, I'm still driving
[1:43:48] and the thought popped in my head again
[1:43:51] and I was like, "No, not doing that."
[1:43:54] And then the coffee shop was coming up
[1:43:58] at the shopping center. The next that I
[1:44:00] was coming to.
[1:44:02] And
[1:44:04] then the thought was, Stephanie, call so
[1:44:07] and so and invite her to coffee right
[1:44:08] now.
[1:44:10] And I was like, okay, I think this is
[1:44:11] God. So I uh was about to pass the
[1:44:15] shopping center where the coffee shop
[1:44:18] was. And right when I turn in, there's
[1:44:22] parking to the left of me, parking to
[1:44:23] the right, and there's parking straight
[1:44:24] ahead. and she's
[1:44:27] standing at the back of her car.
[1:44:31] And so I call her because I'm so I'm at
[1:44:33] this point I'm in shock. I was like,
[1:44:34] "Okay." So I call her and I can see her
[1:44:37] answering her phone. And I said, "Hey,
[1:44:40] would you like to meet me at Lab Buzz
[1:44:42] for coffee and she's just like in shock
[1:44:45] and she's like, "Oh my goodness, I'd
[1:44:47] love to. I'm actually right here."
[1:44:50] And so we go. So I, you know, pull up
[1:44:53] and we go inside and
[1:44:57] she orders a coffee and I ordered like a
[1:44:59] tea or something and
[1:45:03] um we sit down and it was kind of
[1:45:05] awkward because she has been my client
[1:45:07] for 18 years, but we've never gone
[1:45:10] anywhere together.
[1:45:12] And so I just decided to tell her
[1:45:14] everything that had just happened. And
[1:45:17] uh she broke down in tears
[1:45:20] and she told me that a week ago, a week
[1:45:24] before this, that um her son needed
[1:45:28] money. And uh so she's married, but her
[1:45:32] son is not um from that marriage. And he
[1:45:38] had been struggling with drugs. And so
[1:45:41] her husband said, "Well, you can give
[1:45:42] him some money, but he has to come and
[1:45:44] do some landscaping."
[1:45:47] So he was doing landscaping and she had
[1:45:49] went and uh got him u I think it was a
[1:45:52] Snapple beverage
[1:45:55] and um he took a drink of it and there
[1:45:57] was a bee on the top of this beverage
[1:46:01] and he was definitely allergic to bees
[1:46:03] and as he drank it, it stung him in the
[1:46:05] lip and he ended up passing away in her
[1:46:07] arms. They couldn't get him help fast
[1:46:09] enough.
[1:46:11] And so here I am even in more shock.
[1:46:13] Like I don't even know what to say at
[1:46:14] this point. And it was a moment where
[1:46:19] God uses you. And everything that I said
[1:46:23] I know was not from me. And it gave her
[1:46:25] so much comfort.
[1:46:28] And uh that's really what
[1:46:32] um triggered me to just every day just
[1:46:35] say, "God, however you need to use me.
[1:46:37] body because in that particular moment
[1:46:39] it was all about her and God wanting her
[1:46:41] to know that he was thinking of her. He
[1:46:44] was mindful of her and uh she said that
[1:46:48] she didn't know what she was going to do
[1:46:49] that morning that she just didn't know
[1:46:51] if she could live without her son and
[1:46:54] just you know the tragedy of how he
[1:46:55] ended up passing away. So just a good um
[1:47:02] testimony for all of us that every day
[1:47:04] you never know how God could use you.
[1:47:06] Like that morning I woke up, I was not
[1:47:08] expecting any of that to happen. So
[1:47:11] anyway, just praise God.
[1:47:14] [Applause]
[1:47:19] Michael, I go ahead. I think God sends
[1:47:24] angels in many different forms.
[1:47:30] I uh when sister Elizabeth said that God
[1:47:34] sent a angel in the form of a tall, dark
[1:47:38] cancer man, I thought she was talking
[1:47:39] about me.
[1:47:41] [Laughter]
[1:47:43] I'm just kidding.
[1:47:45] But he can. He sends different different
[1:47:49] angels to help and we can be that help.
[1:47:53] Sent sister Stephanie. He sent brother
[1:47:56] He sent this young man to you really to
[1:47:59] help. And how many times have we had
[1:48:03] that honor to be able to help someone
[1:48:06] else? And we can be that messenger
[1:48:09] that's sent from God to help somebody.
[1:48:12] And boy, it feels good, doesn't it,
[1:48:16] Stephanie? Doesn't it feel good to know
[1:48:18] that he used you? He picked you up and
[1:48:23] said, "I want you to help one of my
[1:48:24] children." What a what an honor, Brother
[1:48:27] Michael.
[1:48:32] [Music]
[1:48:35] Take these hands
[1:48:39] and lift them up.
[1:48:44] For I have not the strength to praise
[1:48:48] you near enough.
[1:48:52] Cuz I am nothing.
[1:48:56] Lord, I am nothing
[1:49:01] without you.
[1:49:07] Take
[1:49:09] my voice
[1:49:12] and pour it out
[1:49:16] and let it sing the songs of mercy I
[1:49:21] have found.
[1:49:24] Cuz I am nothing,
[1:49:28] Lord. I am nothing
[1:49:32] [Music]
[1:49:33] without you.
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:40] And all my soul
[1:49:46] needs
[1:49:48] is all your love
[1:49:53] to cover me.
[1:49:56] So all the world
[1:50:01] will see
[1:50:04] that I am nothing
[1:50:10] without you.
[1:50:14] [Music]
[1:50:16] and take
[1:50:18] my body
[1:50:21] and build it up.
[1:50:26] May it be broken as an offering
[1:50:30] of blood.
[1:50:34] Cuz I am nothing,
[1:50:38] Lord. I am nothing
[1:50:41] [Music]
[1:50:42] without you.
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:49] And all my soul
[1:50:55] needs
[1:50:57] is all your love
[1:51:02] to cover me.

[1:51:11] will see
[1:51:13] that I am nothing
[1:51:19] without you.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand.
[1:51:24] Brother Ron Glidewell, if you come and
[1:51:26] close one more time, Brother Michael,
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; take my time.
[1:51:35] here on this earth.
[1:51:39] And let it glorify
[1:51:42] all that you are worth
[1:51:47] cuz I am nothing.
[1:51:51] Lord, I am nothing
[1:51:56] without you.
[1:52:00] [Music]
[1:52:02] And all my soul
[1:52:09] needs
[1:52:11] is all your love
[1:52:16] to cover me.
[1:52:18] So all the world
[1:52:24] will see
[1:52:27] that I am nothing.
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:32] without you.
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:53] I would just like to read a scripture
[1:52:55] before I pray.
[1:53:06] And it's a scripture in in Galatians.
[1:53:09] Paul is uh addressing that church.
[1:53:13] And I just felt it was so pertinent.
[1:53:17] Grace be to you and peace from God the
[1:53:22] Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ. I
[1:53:26] just felt that was so personal that that
[1:53:27] could have been me saying that.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; You know, each one of us are sons and
[1:53:34] daughters of God.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Paul was no more a son of God than you
[1:53:39] are.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; This word is just as pertinent in your
[1:53:42] lips as it was in his.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:53:46] who gave himself for our sins
[1:53:51] that he might deliver us
[1:53:54] from this present world, this present
[1:53:57] evil world,
[1:53:59] according to the will of God our father.
[1:54:03] To whom be the glory forever
[1:54:07] and ever.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. If you read the rest of it, he
[1:54:12] chews him out pretty good for following
[1:54:15] false doctrines. And he says, "I marvel
[1:54:18] how soon you forget."
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; But the way he opens it, it's just
[1:54:23] amazing.
[1:54:26] And
[1:54:27] if you want to read it, you know, but I
[1:54:29] believe it's just a great a great
[1:54:32] introduction
[1:54:34] that Jesus Christ came to deliver us
[1:54:37] from the evil of this world.
[1:54:41] Can we pray?
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ, you know our
[1:54:48] insufficiencies,
[1:54:50] but oh Lord, you look upon
[1:54:52] your son that we have laid before you.
[1:54:55] We have accepted the sacrifice.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Through the shed blood of the Lord
[1:55:00] Jesus.
[1:55:01] And father, as we come to the end of
[1:55:04] this service today, for just a few
[1:55:05] moments, we'll leave each other's
[1:55:07] presence. But you will never leave our
[1:55:10] presence because we take you with us in
[1:55:12] our hearts wherever we go. Lord,
[1:55:15] it's impressed upon me that each and
[1:55:18] every one of these lovely people have
[1:55:20] recognized you in their lives and
[1:55:22] they're just giving you the glory by
[1:55:24] these testimonies. And we thank what
[1:55:26] we're supposed to do, Lord. We thank you
[1:55:28] for our lives. We thank you for this
[1:55:30] place of worship. We thank you for
[1:55:33] giving us a pastor. We thank you for
[1:55:35] giving just the wonderful people that we
[1:55:38] can
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; come together with.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; And feel comfortable, Lord, to be
[1:55:42] ourselves.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; That we can call friends,
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; that we can meet and shake their hands
[1:55:47] and and we love them and they live. They
[1:55:50] love us, Lord.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; We're so grateful for this, Father. And
[1:55:55] Lord, would you just take each and every
[1:55:57] one and just let them just find a place
[1:56:01] to where they can meet you personally
[1:56:04] and allow you Lord to change us into
[1:56:07] that which you have for us. For we know
[1:56:10] Lord that we are to be like you. And oh
[1:56:15] God, we know that it takes you to do
[1:56:17] this in our lives. So we invite you Lord
[1:56:20] to just go with each and everyone in
[1:56:22] their lives Lord that that as we go and
[1:56:26] we we see Lord the the peoples of the
[1:56:29] world and each and everyone that we
[1:56:31] would encounter that Father that we
[1:56:34] would be looking for that one precious
[1:56:36] soul. But if not Lord that we would no
[1:56:40] doubt we would project you and they
[1:56:43] would know something is different. We
[1:56:46] have we want you Lord just to we want
[1:56:48] what you want Father we want you oh God
[1:56:52] to have preeminence in our lives each
[1:56:54] and everyone. So as we go Lord we we
[1:56:58] give thanks for this time but keep each
[1:57:01] and everyone Lord and protect them
[1:57:04] Father remind them of your word. And
[1:57:08] Lord, we know that when we're in a
[1:57:10] place, Father, where there is no other
[1:57:14] place we can go, Lord, you open up a
[1:57:16] place for us, Father, and you show us
[1:57:19] your light. You show us your love and
[1:57:21] give us hope. And we are forever
[1:57:24] grateful for this, Father. We thank you
[1:57:28] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[1:57:30] Christ. Amen.
[1:57:40] Take my time
[1:57:44] here on this earth.
[1:57:49] Let it glorify
[1:57:52] all that you are worth.
[1:57:57] Cuz I am nothing.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, I am nothing.
[1:58:06] without you.
[1:58:10] [Music]
[1:58:12] Oh, all my soul
[1:58:19] needs
[1:58:21] is all your love
[1:58:26] to cover me.
[1:58:29] So all the world
[1:58:35] will see
[1:58:37] that I am nothing
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; without you.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by
[1:58:49] men, but by Jesus Christ and God the
[1:58:52] Father, who raised him from the dead,
[1:58:55] and all the brethren which are with me
[1:58:58] under the churches of Galatia.
[1:59:01] Brother Ron says personal
[1:59:04] grace be unto you and peace from God our
[1:59:08] father and from our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:59:09] who gave himself for our sins that he
[1:59:12] might deliver us from this present world
[1:59:16] according to the will of God and our
[1:59:19] father to whom be glory forever and
[1:59:22] ever. Amen. Thank you brother Ron. God

[2:07:52] This world will try to sisfy
[2:07:59] that longing
[2:08:01] in your soul. And you may search this
[2:08:08] whole world over,
[2:08:12] but you'll be just as before.
[2:08:17] And you'll never find
[2:08:21] true satisfaction.
[2:08:24] Not until you found the Lord. For only
[2:08:31] Jesus
[2:08:34] can satisfy
[2:08:37] your soul.
[2:08:38] [Music]
[2:08:41] And only Jesus
[2:08:46] can satisfy

[2:08:56] can change your heart.
[2:08:59] and make you whole.
[2:09:04] Oh, he'll give you peace
[2:09:08] you never knew.
[2:09:11] Sweet love and joy
[2:09:14] in heaven, too. For only Jesus
[2:09:21] can satisfy
[2:09:23] your soul.
[2:09:25] [Music]

[2:09:31] the fame and fortune
[2:09:34] and all the wealth you could obtain yet
[2:09:40] if you have not priced within you.
[2:09:46] Your living here would be in vain. For
[2:09:51] there'll come a time
[2:09:54] when death shall call you.
[2:09:57] Your riches cannot help you. Then so
[2:10:03] come to Jesus
[2:10:06] for only he can satisfy.
[2:10:14] And only Jesus
[2:10:18] can satisfy
[2:10:21] your soul.

[2:12:02] Something
[2:12:05] Something keeps holding me
[2:12:10] every day. I see.
[2:12:13] He's helping me faithfully
[2:12:17] to overcome my trials.
[2:12:22] He's guiding me constantly,
[2:12:27] giving me victory.
[2:12:31] Oh, he's a reality.
[2:12:34] Something keeps holding me.
[2:12:41] The trials of this life were getting
[2:12:45] closer.
[2:12:49] The pull I felt was more than I could
[2:12:53] bear.
[2:12:58] I was on the verge of giving over.
[2:13:06] The strength within myself just wasn't
[2:13:10] there.
[2:13:13] But something keeps holding me.
[2:13:18] Every day I see
[2:13:21] he's helping me faithfully
[2:13:25] to overcome my trials.

[2:13:35] giving me victory.
[2:13:39] He's a reality.
[2:13:42] Something keeps holding me.
[2:13:48] Satan laid before me this temptation
[2:13:57] his desire to steal away my faith.
[2:14:05] But I have found inside
[2:14:08] the revelation
[2:14:13] the strength I need to keep me in his
[2:14:17] grace.
[2:14:20] Something keeps holding me.
[2:14:25] Every day I see
[2:14:28] he's helping me faithfully
