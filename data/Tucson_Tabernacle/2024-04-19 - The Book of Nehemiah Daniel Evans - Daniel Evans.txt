of new folks but on Saturday Steven scar broke down and we couldn't get a mechanic we took it in and they they ran the again and it said it was this so we bought the part and found out we couldn't do

so he said after this afternoon I'll come over and we'll get your car going well find out it couldn't do that either cuz it was going to take a lot more work so we ended up staying one extra day and then they ran this scan and it was something totally different and they were able to fix it so we got home on on Monday late we had a good time getting to spend time with the Saints up there and get

decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus I won't turn back I won't turn back amen I have decided because of there was something inside me that was pulling back that way amen and I said yes Lord amen while we were up there and the services up there in Cottonwood their piano player had had left and was wasn't coming to church anymore so they used any piano player that came in so we got to hear a few different piano players and it was nice every style was different and and but you know what we worshiped and we praise the Lord anyway so and the piano players have to put up with us that's usually the the way it goes but you know as as as we've been going through the the Old Testament books and I was telling brother Lyall me and my wife were talking coming in how this study has changed my whole view of the Old Testament in a sense to me it was just a history book you know oh this happened this happened we'd pull a scripture out here and pull a scripture out but more I'm realizing how much brother brandom said if you don't find Christ in every chapter in every book he said you're reading it wrong and I'm we're both talking about how much it has has meant so much to us so appreciate the brothers doing what they're doing in a way that I still Marvel that they can do it that way but we're all different and God knows that so as brother Dan prepares to to come out as I was listening to brother Jordan's testimony on Monday and then yesterday I listened to brother Dan and I just was thanking the lord for what he's done for us

Jesus name amen God bless you all you can take your seats thank you I have a friend with us tonight I um I've never met him in person tonight is the first night I've met him but I U I got acquainted with him a few years ago a friend of mine sent me a book that he wrote and uh it was it was such a blessing to me that I reached out to him and uh found his email address somewhere and I reached out to him and um we started corresponding back and forth and he told me that he was going to be in Tucson this week him and his family brother Kyle Morton would you come forward and maybe greet the people for me now you're you're a pastor right I'm and is it on Vancouver Victoria on Victoria God bless you brother if you come forward as I said Brother Kyle is uh he's a scholar I'm going to be talking I'm going to be giv a a Bible study tonight we do Bible studies on Wednesday night um so I will try not to be intimidated my brother as you're out there God bless you bless you nice to meet you you God bless you church it's so nice to be here uh with you I'm not a scholar I'm a gardener by trade but um it's really nice to be here with you my family is with me there I came through here in 2006 I was only one year in the message then and we just popped in the bookstore sister Shan was there at the time but we've never been in a service with you so I wanted to bring my family for a little road trip and we've been to Flagstaff so brother Robson and Phoenix so brother McGary but originally um we're from Cloverdale Bible way I know jiaho and I've met some of you at camps and so forth the Petersons and so so forth and but about 14 years ago we started a little work on the island Vancouver Island and Victoria there so about six years ago we moved over there and uh a small group about 20 of us there's no website you won't find us but there's been people that have come to the Lord It's a university town it's the capital of the province they come converted maybe they go back home or they move somewhere else in Canada so we're just happy to do something for the Lord and um I'm I really want to just say I'm I'm grateful for this Tabernacle for the ministry for the people here it's been a blessing to me that the past Ministry and the present and Lord willing the future also back home I've been preaching about the will of God and I've been using Brother Perry Green's example of the three lights you lying those three lights up right no scripture against you it's got to be the desire burden from the Lord and the Lord opens the door so we've been speaking about that back home it's been a real blessing and our church is until 3:30 in the afternoon so we've streamed you a few times seen some of the baptisms up there so really appreciate what you're doing you know if you ever come to the island I would like to take you to a place called fisgard Lighthouse has anybody been there nobody Josiah has been there okay you can go up in the lighthouse and you can see the old records of the old lightkeepers and some of them only lasted a week wow cuz it's so they were so lonely and so repetitive every day you got to keep the oil and the light going you got to wash the windows and the mirrors every day you got to remove the dead seagulls that crashed into the building and so it's very repetitive and very lonely but some of them lasted a long time right and that rep repetition and that labor provided a service it provided a light to warn people of danger and sometimes you don't even you don't even see the benefits of what you're doing but some ship misses danger because of you and they give testimony somewhere else and say praise God that Lighthouse helped me void danger but sometimes the lighthous keepers don't see the benefit of what you're doing so I just want to encourage you to keeping a lighthouse and we'll keeping a lighthouse by the grace of God where we are and we're really happy just humbled to be here with you and toan for the first time uh in person so um God bless you richly and looking forward to the service with you tonight thank you brother Kyle he he did um here's a blessing I read his book and uh it um it really it was a perspective that I I really appreciated um and brothers and sisters what better thing could we be than a lighthouse to this world and and the Bible tells us that we are a light to the world but don't hide that light under a bushel Let It Shine forth to all men Let's uh let's stand and um we can get into the the book of Nehemiah here as I said for our visitors we have a Wednesday night bible study we're going through every book of the Bible we started actually in the book of Acts and we read every single word in the book of Acts we went chapter by chapter line by line and then we finished it it took us I mean a good part of a year and we finished it and I thought well you know what best place to starts Genesis let's go there so we're devoting one service per book of the Bible and as I said that's what we're doing on our Wednesday night services let's turn to the book of Nehemiah chapter 1 this is nehemiah's prayer to the Lord verse five and I said I beseech thee Oh god of Heaven the great and terrible God that keepeth Covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his Commandments let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant which I pray before thee now day and night for the children of Israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against thee both I and my father's house have sinned We have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the Commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which thou commandest thy servant Moses remember I beseech Thee the word that thou commandest thy servant Moses saying if ye transgress I will scatter you abroad among the Nations but if ye turn unto me and keep my Commandments and do them though there were of You cast out unto the uttermost parts of Heaven yet will I gather them from then and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou Hast Redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand oh Lord I beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper I pray thee thy servant this day and Grant him Mercy in the sight of this man for I was the king's cup Bearer amen God bless you all you can take your seat so then this this man who is in the line of David who is in the line of the Lord Jesus himself named zerubabel he has a burden to bring the people out of what was once Babylon now is taken over by Persia bring them back home to Jerusalem that was zerubabel he brings them back and then there was this man that brother Josiah talked about last week or two weeks ago this man's name was Ezra the Lord raised up the burden in Ezra's heart to rebuild this Temple of worship in Jerusalem so now we have the temple being rebuilt Ezra was there for about 14 years and then the Lord lays it on another man's heart and that is this man named Nehemiah Nehemiah was a very important person to the king um the king's name is Artis Xerxes Artis Xerxes is actually and brother ly will be talking about this when we get to Esther Artis Xerxes is Esther's um stepson so AR Xerxes as I said he's the King of Persia and his cup Bearer which was a very very important position back then this cup bearer was was the one who basically he you know and the you see in the movies and stuff the you see the the the person that drinks the drink or eats the food before the king eats it so it's not poisoned well that was his job and it's not like you have some Brutus over there saying yeah give me a bite of that you know and I didn't die so no this was a very very important person that the king trusted very very highly right so here's Nehemiah and he gets word that the um the temple had been rebuilt but there's a problem in Jerusalem the temple is built but there is nothing surrounding the city to protect the people in the temple for PE from invading armies just to come in and steal whatever they want so the Lord lays it on the heart of this man Nehemiah to to return to Jerusalem now he was born in captivity he'd probably never been there but he the Jews they just something about their Homeland I talked about Zionism on Sunday morning it's nothing new that these people long to be back home in their Homeland that is where they are comfortable that is where God has always dealt with Israel is in their Homeland we talked about the dispersion and how they had gone out around the world and God promised in the last days through Zachariah and through many other prophecies that he would bring them back into their Homeland and we have seen that in this day and we've seen the the their power just continue to raise and and they they're able to defend themselves now that is the Fulfillment of all these scriptures well here is Nehemiah and he has this same feeling yeah I want to be home I want to help my people so Nehemiah as I said he's the cup Bearer to the king a very very trusted probably the most trusted person in all of Persia to tell you the truth besides maybe the king's wife so let's turn to chapter one and let's read the first part of it here chapter one now Ezra let me give a little background here Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book they were written together they were probably written as brother Josiah told us by this man named Ezra this great scribe scholar named Ezra that put this together and much of Nehemiah Ezra is quoting Nehemiah so they were the the when they put the Bible together the two books were split apart chapter 1 the words of Nehemiah the son of hackelia and it came to pass in the month of shisu in the 20th year as I was in shushan the palace now that month is December and what probably happened back then is the king probably spent the summer months and the fall up higher in the mountains in the higher elevation which was this is this shushan up in Persia and then in the winter months he probably came to the lower elevations to spend the the those months in Babylon so we have these things Brother Kyle called snowbirds here in Tucson so the King of Persia was probably a snowbird and at this time he was up in British Columbia that Han that hanani one of the Brethren came he and a certain men of Judah and a and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped that had left they hadn't really escaped under duress Cyrus had let them go which were left of the Captivity concerning Jerusalem and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the Captivity there in the Prov Province are in great Affliction and reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of Heaven now Nehemiah as I said before Nehemiah understands that now this Temple is rebuilt through Ezra but the walls are broken down and the gates are burned so any invading Army can just come in and and destroy the temple again there's no protection at all and do you see brothers and sisters I'll stop right here how the Lord places different burdens on different people yeah some people may have a burden to minister the gospel other people may have a burden to to to serve or to to be a deacon to keep order in the churches and like we heard from Brother um Jordan on Sunday brother Jordan's burden is to help in any way he can so we see that different people have different callings in life and this man Nehemiah he was a governor he was a he was a great man he was a ruler he had a burden to to come and start the construction of this wall around Jerusalem verse 5 and I said oh then he goes on and I already read this this was his prayer and so Nehemiah now he starts praying he he feels this burden and he he's praying and it doesn't happen right away when God might speak to us he might lay something on our hearts and just because it doesn't happen right away brothers and sisters doesn't mean just to move on to something else and doesn't mean that is it isn't God days started to go by and our brother Nehemiah would continued to pray he continued to Fast and the burden just got greater and greater months weeks and months went by four months went by and this man just this burden to go back home and to build these these protecting walls continued to grow so we go to chapter two he prays this prayer that I read earlier so we get we go to chapter 2 verse one says this and it came to pass in the month of Nissan it's in April in the 20th year so we went from December now now we're in April and it came to pass in the month of Nissan in the 20th year of arzer the king that wine was before him and I took up the wine and gave it unto the king now I had not been Before Time sad in his presence one of the things with the cup Bears back then remember their life had nothing to do with themselves their whole life was to serve the King right now you and I might if we're kind of down if something bad happens we might you know put on a sad face and want to get a little attention from somebody or want to get a little pad on the back or something like that there was none of this with this cup Bearer because if you were had a sad countenance you didn't want to bring that countenance into the king and make him sad because at best you would probably not be cup bear anymore at worst you would be no more period so this this cup bear position was all about the king so the king notices it the king said to me why is thy countenance sad seeing that thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of the heart then I was very sore afraid you can see why he was afraid because of what I just said and said unto the king let the King live forever and ever I mean that was kind of his job eating the food making sure there's no poison there and all that let the King live for forever and ever why should not my countenance be sad when the king the place of my father's suppliers lith waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire then the king said unto me for what Dost thou make request so I prayed to the god of heaven so the king he tells the king this he says listen he says all the walls and the gates are broken down and my homeland and he lays it before the king and then he'd been praying for 4 months now he gets this little short prayer and it must have been something like Lord help me this is when all of those prayers and all of that fasting and everything all of that came to this point right here where it was either life or death and also it was life or death for his people and he said and the King said unto me for what Dost thou make his repress so I prayed to God to the god of heaven and I said unto the king if it please thee King and If thy servant have found favor in thy sight thou wouldest send me to Judah unto the city of my father's suppliers that I may build it now notice right here the wisdom of Nehemiah he he doesn't say Lord he doesn't say King if you'll let me go he says if you will send me because if he sent then he has the authority of the king as he goes it's the same thing with us Brother Kyle if we say Lord if you will let me do this it's different we're going out on our own but if you if the Lord sends us then we go on the authority of the king wow so it was nehemiah's desire to go but Watch What Happens now when the king is behind you and the King said unto me the queen also sitting by him for how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return so it pleased the king to send me and I set him a time so he tells him I'm going to I'm going to go but I will I promise I'll come back so Nehemiah made his commitment to return after he accomplished his goal moreover I said unto the king if it please the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over till I come into Judah and a letter unto ASA The Keeper of the king's Forest that he may give me Timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertain to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into and the King granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me so now he's going the king pays his way and now this King of Persia is going to pay for the materials to rebuild this wall then I came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the king's letters now the king had sent captains of the Army and the horsemen with me when sand ballot the horonite and toah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel so brothers and sisters whenever the Lord lays something on our heart to do it he will provide everything that we need but don't think that there's not going to be opposition there always will be especially if you are in the Lord's will so these three guys that are causing problems they're prominent throughout the rest of the book of Nehemiah they're always causing problems and they're even successful as we will read in a little while they're even successful in sowing some seed of Discord and CA casting doubt on the Jewish people that are going to be building the walls Nehemiah continues here he says so I came to Jerusalem and was there three days and I arose in the night I and some few men with me neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem neither was there any Beast with me me save the Beast that I rodee upon now it's important here Nehemiah kept his intentions to himself he didn't want the enemy to have any fuel for his fire he didn't want anyone to know so he goes out and he starts walking in the city and he starts inspecting the walls in the gates and this is at night so he must have been in the moonlight just him by himself and he's going along I believe the the wall around Jerusalem is a couple miles long so it doesn't take that long so he goes and he's maybe taking notes and and he sees that wow this is what I thought we are not protected in any way against an invasion he says this and I went out by Night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well and the dung port and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire then I went on to the gate of the fountain and to the king's pool but there was no place for the Beast that was that was under me to pass then when I up in the Night by the Brook and viewed all the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so I returned and the rulers knew not whether I went or what I did neither had I as yet told the Jews nor the priests nor the Nobles nor the rulers nor the rest of the the rest that did the work then I said unto them ye see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lith waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach then as I told them of of the hand of my God which was upon which was good upon me as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for this good work I love that response let's go let's do it Nehemiah we are with you let's build this wall you can see the enthusiasm of the people and brother Aon that's what I feel like that's what we're missing in many times in this last agage is that enthusiasm to serve the Lord to build and to do because we're so caught up in many other things and and our minds are are always on they're on work or they're on entertainment or they're on whatever they are and there is work to do here and I love these these people's responses let's do it let's build this wall there is one age Revelation 2 and Revelation 3 these ages that we call the seven Church ages it starts in EP Ephesus and it ends in leoa there is one age that it commands be zealous and that is this age because brother Jonathan we're lacking the Zeal wow that we should have and this is the age that we are going to see the coming of Christ and you can see how the enemy has got in there and he's taken the Zeal away from the people but when sand ballot the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite and gam the Arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that you do will you rebel against the king now watch notice nehemiah's answer the king himself sent him to build the wall the King of Persia the king sent him but Nehemiah by faith he referred to a higher King than the King of Persia then answered I them and said unto them now remember these are Persians these are men subject to The King and I said unto them the god of Heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build but you have no portion nor right nor Memorial in Jerusalem so Nehemiah was firm and he called upon the Lord knowing that Jehovah is a greater King than anyone on Earth so we look at the faith that he had how many of us would have said no the king sent me here's my here's my letter here's my orders he didn't do that he said no God has sent us so in chapter 3 they start building the wall now let's read chapter 3 verse one then eliasib the high priest rose up with his brother and the priest and they builded the Sheep gate and they Sanctified it and set up the doors of it even unto the Tower of Mia they Sanctified it unto the Tower of hanal Now watch how the people are working together here and I'll read just this next couple verses so you see you get a feeling of the rest of the chapter and next to and next unto him builded the men of Jericho and next to them builded zacher the son of emry but the fishgate did the Sons of Hassan build who who also laid the beams thereof and set up the doors thereof and the locks thereof and the bars thereof look at how people had different jobs here and next unto them repaired maroth the son of urah the son of Co and next unto them repaired mulam the son of bariah the son of mesha zabil and next un to them repa repaired zadok the son of Baya so it shows that each group and each person had a part in rebuilding the walls and they all work together in doing it I'm sure that many of them probably weren't as skilled as the other ones but they all yet they all had a burden to do this they all had a Zeal to do it and watch what they accomplished so in chapter 4 we see a lot of opposition and it starts to affect the moral of the people let's go to verse uh chter 4:1 but it came to pass that when sand ballot heard that we builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews and he spake before his Brethren and the army of Samaria and said what do these Fe what do these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day so he's saying will they finish it a day they must have been working really hard when he saw this happen and he was making fun of them saying Oh you're working really hard now you're going to finish the whole thing in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish which are burned now remember that word rubbish it comes to play a little later now tobah the ammonite was was by him and he said even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall look at them just making fun of them saying they can't build anything right if just a little fox goes up there the Wall fall down here our God here oh Our God for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity look at what this man now is praying it's it's a bit of a harsh prayer it's he's saying Lord the thing that they're saying against us let it come back upon him and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they provoke provoke thee to anger before the builders so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof for the people had a mind to worken love that part they wanted to do something they and they weren't just talking a big talk they put they put the their life behind their words amen see how important it is brothers and sisters for the church to be in one Accord and have one objective we can do amazing things remember in Acts chapter 2 the people were all in one Accord what does that mean that mean they that means they had one purpose in all of this the enemy he sees the people working together and then he gets in there to cause problems and we'll see where these problems are right now but it came to pass that when sand ballot and tobia and the Arabians and the ammonites and the asites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped they were very wroth and they con conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem and hinder it nevertheless we made our prayer unto God and set a watch against them day and night because of them so they prayed and they armed themselves and they were ready to go to battle against anyone that would hinder them so they set a guard half of them were armed with Spears and Shields and and and instruments of war and then the other half they were laying the bricks but even that half that was laying the bricks they had a sword on their side so these guys were ready to go anytime they were ready to go to battle but they just kept laying These Bricks but attitude is also very very important so the people started to lose confidence and they started to complain and Judah said the strength of the bearers of burden is decayed and there is much rubbish I wonder where he he got that remember they were saying that before so they were starting to influence these people and they started to repeat what they were hearing with the criticism so that we are not able to build the wall so the enemies planted these negative thoughts in the people's minds and they even said the same words so brothers and sisters how important are our words in our church the tson Tabernacle doesn't do any good to complain it doesn't do any good to talk behind the scenes all of us we've heard criticism you know we've heard as we're growing as a church as people are coming in we've baptized 60 people in the past year many of those people have never even been to church before I know that on Wednesday night we're just a few in number these are the pillars in the church but on Sunday morning we see those people yes and then yet I hear criticism well look at these people look at the way they look look at the way they act that doesn't make sense for a Christian come on to say those things amen it makes sense for a Christian to have a burden for these people the Pharisees and even the Disciples of John said the same thing about Jesus did you know that they said look at Jesus he's hanging out with these people that are drinking he's hanging out with these Sinners they're saying what's what's the deal with all this so here's John's John's disciples John the Baptist his disciples are saying it the Pharisees are saying it they're saying why do you have all these worldly people in your church so you know what Jesus answered it came to Jesus he said this he said I desire Mercy amen and not sacrifice amen the Lord Jesus Christ answering these same people that were giving the same criticisms that we even hear today so negative attitude brothers and sisters be careful I know that there is a time for criticism but make sure the criticism comes to the right place that's why we have positions in the church make sure that we are hearing it and and you know it could be different things it could be pews versus chairs it could be the color of the walls do you like the pink in the fellowship hall I promise it's not going to be pink somebody somebody asked I said yeah we're just going to make all of that in Nursery out there but it C it brings people down it really does I understand that there's mistakes that are made sometime I understand that there is a time for criticism but make sure it comes to the right place and it's not just going out and causing problems let's skip to verse 14 and I looked up and Rose up and said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be ye be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren fight for each other fight for the people in the congregation the ones that you love Fight for them don't fight against them and your sons and your daughters and your wives and your houses and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and God had brought their counsel T not that we returned all of us to the wall every one of us to his work so this is a leader this Nehemiah he says listen he says understand what's going on here we are in this battle for each other not against each other don't let these outside people lay this this seat of discrepancy inside of you fight for each other love one another serve each other so again I said he said he says half them men with Spears and Shields and bows and the other half they're working on the wall but they still had swords on their side and the same thing with Israel today I talked about Israel on Sunday morning it's the same thing they've got the Iron Dome and they've got the iron shield and they've got F35 and F-16 Fighters and they've got tanks and they've got all of these things that they are ready to go to battle man but they're still continuing on with their country right they're growing crops they're making software they're still working hard as a country to grow their country but they like their ancestors here they are ready to go to battle and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants rought in the work and the other half of them held both Spears and Shields and bows and the harbingers and the rulers were behind all of the house of Judah so then we go to chapter five and the people the rulers they were charging a high people are people and you can't get out of it right I mean it's it it's just people are people that's that's the best way to say it they were charging High interest rates on loans and they were using this bad situation to extort money from their uh their their brethren in the church is it on okay they're brethren in the church so Nehemiah puts a stop to it he says brothers and sisters quit extorting money quit using this situation to get money out of your brothers and sisters we are in this as I said in this battle together then chapter six the enemy tries to multiply the times he tries I'm sorry the enemy tries to enti Nehemiah out of the Camp starts sending him letters hey why don't you come out here and talk to us why don't you come outside the walls and why don't you why don't we discuss all this why don't you answer nehemiah's answer was you know I don't have time for you I'm I'm I'm busy I'm doing my work and I don't have time for your criticism I've answered the same way quite a few times I I just you're not doing this you're not preaching like you should you're not you're not and I'm not talking about people in this congregation I'm talking about the people from outside you know what I don't have time for you I'm busy with these people building these walls building this Temple serving the people chapter six as I said they they try to entice him out he doesn't do it then in chapter I mean in verse 15 he says this so the wall was finished in 20 in the 205th day of the month of elu in 52 days that's 2 and a half miles of a wall with bricks built up that could protect the city I'm building a house right now 52 days it took him to build this wall around the city so I got the estimate from my contractor and I have to I have to have this wall built my backyard and at the rate that my contractor is building the wall it would take 216 years for my contractor to build the wall around Jerusalem Nehemiah did it in less than two months not complaining 216 years it would take to build to build this this wall around Jerusalem if it was if it was the contractor that I heard not Michael not the guy that comes to church is it's the other guy it really isn't him Michael if you're streaming in I'm not talking about you brother and and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof and all the Heathen that were about us saw these things they were they were much cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was rought of our God I'll bet they were I'll bet they were amazed at that so in chapter S it list the people who returned from Persia to Jerusalem in all there were about 50,000 people 42,000 um of uh of of the Jews and then about seven or 8,000 of their servants now chapter 8 as I said before this book of Nehemiah is most certainly one of my favorite books in the Old Testament and I think that Nehemiah chapter 8 could be my favorite chapter in the entire Old Testament the first seven chapters were about building the wall they finished the wall and then now it's time brothers and sisters for Revival and this is the start of the Revival right here in Nehemiah chapter 8 now Ezra he we have he hasn't been mentioned yet he's back on the scene now remember I said that Ezra was there for 14 years about before um Nehemiah arrives now he comes back Ezra is the minister Ezra is the Scribe Nehemiah is the governor and now Ezra takes the pulpit and what does he do he brings the people back to the word we've been going through our Bible study the people always do the same thing they stray from God's word God sends a deliverer and they come back and every Revival starts with people coming back to the word remember in judges they would come back to the word and then God would send a blessing Josiah King Josiah remember we were talking about that in 2 Chronicles where Josiah they they find the Bible in the church never reading it doing something else but they get back to the word and then God sends a blessing same thing happened with John Wickliffe way back when he's he takes the Latin Vulgate they didn't have the original the original Bible he translates this into the into the common people's language then later on the Protestant Revival we see Martin Luther and and William tendale they they take these these original manuscripts and they translate them into German and into English tendale into English Luther into German and then we see the Protestant Revival come it's always get the people back to the word we leave the word and if we can just get back to the Bible this book has everything that we need and it brings Revival if we can just get back to this it's happened over and over again ISU the Street Revival the people read in the book of Acts they said that these tongues many times his tongues comes from receiving the Holy Spirit they started praying Lord we are not where we should be God sends a Revival in isua Street 1906 changes the world brother brandham comes he says listen you've left the word get back to this original word Divine Healing he says come back to it if the Bible says it it means it Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever get back to the word and get away from your weird denominations Lord sent a Revival we need to get back to the word back to this book over and over again we see it and it's just that simple turn the heart of the children back to that of the fathers brother ramam said back to the apostolic fathers the ones that believe the word the word says it and they believe it chapter 8 verse one and all the people ga GED themselves together as one man as I said before the unity of the people into the street that was before the Watergate and they spake unto Ezra The Scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had commanded to Israel read the Bible and Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seventh month and he read therein before the street that was before the Watergate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and those that could understand and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law this was a long service and he was just up there reading the Bible and and they weren't falling asleep they loved the word and they were just digesting it and they were listening to it from morning until midday Ezra reading the word and Ezra The Scribe stood up on the pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood maiah and Shima and anayah and UAH and hilaya and maasa um Masai on his right hand and on his left hand padah and mishel and malayah and hasham and has badana and Zachariah and mulam and Ezra open the book in the sight of the people for he was above all the people when he opened it he was up here and the people were were down there they had made him this pulpit and he opened the book and all the people stood up you didn't have to tell them right they had respect for this word that's why we see I believe that's why we see we see sometimes that the people will stand maybe at the beginning of service in reverence of reading the Bible look at the reverence it's just the reverence that they had in this chapter is just so beautiful and Ezra blessed the Lord the great God and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands so we can say amen and we can lift up our hands in church amen we don't have to be quiet it's in the Bible and it gets better also Joshua and bayai and sheriah and Jamon and akub and shabath and hodah and meiah and Kida and Azariah and jbad and Hannan and pah and the Levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place so these ministers they helped the people understand the word they helped them understand Deuteronomy and Leviticus and numbers exactly brothers and sisters exactly what we are trying to do in our Wednesday night bible study so they read in the book in the law of God distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading and Nehemiah which is the tatha and Ezra the priest The Scribe and the Levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is Holy unto the Lord your God moreour not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law they were just overwhelmed brother Josiah it was they were just listening to this and they just started weeping and here's the brothers are like no no don't weep this is a great day this is a glorious day we're we're hearing this word we're reading the Bible this is awesome praise the Lord then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is Holy unto our Lord neither be ye sarry for the joy of the Lord is your strength so the Levites stealed all the people saying hold your peace for the day is Holy neither be ye grieved and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make a great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared of them he said go home and relax we're going to cancel Sunday evening service enjoy each other eat and be happy because the word has been read to you this day and on the second day we're gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people the priests and the Levites unto Ezra The Scribe even to understand the words of the law and they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the Feast of the seventh month I believe brother L this is the Feast of Tabernacles and they and that they should publish and Proclaim in all the cities and in Jerusalem saying go forth under the mount and fetch Olive branches and pine branches and Myrtle branches and palm branches and the branches of thick trees to make booths as as it is written so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves booths booths and Tabernacles are the same word and made themselves booths everyone upon the roof of his house and in their courts and in the and in the courts of the house of God and in the street of the Watergate and in the streets of the Gate of Ephraim and all the congregation of them that were come again out of the Captivity made booths and they under the booth for since the days of jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so and there was a very great gladness they started again celebrating this Feast of Tabernacles they were honoring the Lord by doing his word amen also Day by Day from the first day until the last he read the book of The Law of God and they they kept the feast seven days and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according unto the manner what a glorious day this was in Jerusalem the people heard the word and they acted on the word and they thanked him for their Church they thanked him for their protection they thanked him through obeying his word then in chapter nine the Levites consecrate themselves they pray and they give a beautiful history from Abraham to that day in the end of chapter N9 they make a covenant to renew their vows to the Lord and then in chapter 10 it lists who signed that Covenant now there was a problem there weren't enough people living in the city of Jerusalem they had this beautiful Temple they had this be this beautiful wall around the city but they didn't have enough people living in the city so in chapter 11 they take a tenth of every group of those people that were living outside of Jerusalem and they relocate to live in the city then in chapter 12 it lists all the Levites and it lists their celebration let's let's read verse 27 and at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places to bring them to jerus Jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness both with Thanksgiving and with singing with symbols and sultes and with Harps and the sons of the singers gather gathered themselves together both out of the plain of the country round about Jerusalem and from The Villages of npoy also from the house of gilgal and out of all the F fields of giba and asmath for the singers had builded them Villages round about Jerusalem look how important brothers and sisters our musicians are the chapter goes on and on talking about the musicians and the singers and the worshippers it's pretty obvious in reading this chapter how important our worship service is we call them some people some Churches we call him a song leader or we call it a song service but no it's a worship leader it's a worship service it's a worship team that is what this is for is worship and this chapter is amazing how much emphasis it puts on worship yes sir amen verse 30 now let's let's skip to verse 43 for time sake also that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced for God had made them Rejoice with great joy the wives also and the children rejoiced so that the joy of Jerusalem Was Heard even a far off wow the joy was heard it wasn't just the singing it was a combination of it all it was the singing it was the instruments it was the shouts of amen and the shouts of Hallelujah brothers and sisters many we're too quiet I'm not saying that you have to be jump in the pews as some of the brothers say but you can say Amen we can say hallelujah amen we can shout out so that at least maybe the people walking along the sidewalk outside can hear the joy that's inside let's go to verse 47 and all Israel in the days of zerubabel and in and in the days of Nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters every day his portion and they Sanctified holy things unto the Levites and the Levites Sanctified them unto the children of Aaron an entire chapter devoted to worship beautiful musicians would come and we'll close um this is the Bible the Bible describes human nature and the the Bible describes the nature of God God's longsuffering with his children he pours out his Spirit when his children follow his word and he allows his children to suffer when we get away from his word and suffering is just to bring us back so Nehemiah he goes back to Persia as he had promised the king and then when he returns brothers and sisters he sees at the people as with almost every book that I've read almost every study that we've done almost every Wednesday night bible service that we've conducted we see the same thing over and over again and the book of Nehemiah is just basically part for the course it's the same thing as every other book he goes back to Persia as he promised the king then when he returns he sees that Israel had fallen into sin the three big sins that he names are the people not financially supporting the ministry dishonoring the Sabbath and then also marrying outside their faith and let's go to verse six and I'll I'll we'll close with this but in all the time was I not was not I at Jerusalem for in two and the 30th year of AR Xerxes King of Babylon came I under the king and after certain days obtained I leave of the king so now he's going to go back and I came to Jerusalem and understood of the evil that eliab did for toaya in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God and it grieved me sore therefore I cast forth all of the household stuff to deah out of the chamber then I commanded and they cleansed the chambers and there brought I again vessels of the house of God with meat offering and the frankincense and I perceived that the portion of the Levites had not been given them for the Levites and the singers that did the work were fled everyone to his field then I cont then contended I with the rulers and said why is the house of God Forsaken and I gathered them together and set them in their place verse 15 and I saw then those days I saw saw I in Judah some treading the wine press on the Sabbath talks about the Sabbath and sending there and then in verse 19 he says and it came to pass when the Gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath I commanded that the gates should be shut the people started getting lack in their worship we're going to see that when we get to the Book of Malachi which was written at about the same time as this and he goes on he tells of the sins of the people and in verse 26 and he's speaking of when when the young men were were marrying these girls that weren't Christians and when the young women were doing the same he says did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things yet among many nations was there no King like him who was beloved of his God and God made him King over all Israel nevertheless even him did outlandish women caused to sin and then in verse 31 this is something that he says often he says remember me oh my God for good so thus we have the book of Nehemiah as I said it's when they when the um Israelites came out of captivity they settled in the land zerubabel in the line of the king he had a burden to bring the people out king cus allowed him to go Ezra came Ezra rebuilt the temple and this man Nehemiah was tasked with building the wall around Jerusalem it's one of the as far as the chronology of the Bible it's one of the last books in the Bible I know that we have a lot to go until the end of Malachi but this was written some I don't know 440 450 years before the Lord Jesus came so it's it's right at one of the last books that were written in the Bible brother Aaron I have a prayer request for who find it here from Sister
