there healing right away why wasn't but God has a reason God has a reason I would say because because Dad said so and she'd asked me why and I said because Dad said so and she goes that's not a good answer why the other girls would say okay dad said so that's good enough but not Sarah but that's out allowed her to be who she is when the doctor said it's because of this and she would say why then the doctor would have to tell her why and then she would say but I'll tell you why I'm going to stand this way because I have a God that will take care of me we were sitting in the in the in the restaurant one day some time after that and she looks and she goes remember the doctor I told me that if I didn't get a heart uh kidney transplant I'd either be dead in a couple of weeks or I'd come barely crawling in that's him sitting there looking at me like is that really her and she goes yes it is me we serve a living God come on and the only real peace that I have dear lord it's in you oh

only real people that we have dear Lord is in you thank you so much good evening going to do this a little differently tonight and ask you to be seated for just a moment I want to start a little differently and by the way you're probably aware of it but in the booth in the back there's a handout for part four with the scriptures and some of the slides that uh we hope to project I realize that this study is a bit different taking several evenings to look at the life of one person in the Bible Joseph I'd like to play a short excerpt from Brother Branham a message that he titled Joseph meeting his Brethren it's the only sermon I found that referenced our topic Joseph in its title he's speaking of Genesis being the beginning and foreshadowing everything else I wish we had just about three months on this to stay right on this one subject and just dig it hide by the Holy Spirit by God's cards and just wrap it together and watch how every word just do Tails right in with the other words amen such a beautiful thing the word of God Is So inspiring no matter what age what time every man that's ever read this text through the it's been written now for many hundreds yeah for near 3,000 more years and every man that's ever read this text in every age is inspired by every ver of scripture there's nothing else can ever take its place I thought that that was a a very appropriate sort of lead in to this and to my opinion one of the most vital texts of the Old Testament Joseph we going to speak on meeting his Brethren there could be a hundred different ways that the Holy Spirit get into this and unfold it to our hearts and mind with that as background let's proceed I was excited last time we met you probably could tell but I'm even more excited tonight why because we'll see such precision and what God has preserved for us to bring astonishing Clarity to a very murky time and place in history before we resume let's stand and join together once more in prayer dear Lord Jesus it's a humbling experience to Stand Here Lord to hear the voice of brother brandom encouraging us to dig into the word and to take our time to be standing at at a Pulpit where he once spoke Lord Lord I just pray that you would help Lord that the words that are spoken tonight be words that are pleasing to you be words that are coming from you to each one of us Lord that that you'd answer questions in our minds settle doubts in our hearts Lord draw us closer to yourself and to one another help us to manifest the spirit of Jesus Christ that love that we have for you towards each other Lord we thank you for your word forgive us where we fall short Lord we commit this evening into your hands and thank you for this privilege that we have in Jesus precious name amen for our opening verses I'd like to read three short passages they reflect Joseph's Journey thus far as as well as his character and the first is found as you probably expect in First Peter First Peter chapter 5 starting in the middle of verse 5 be clothed with humility Let It Be Your garment for God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble humble yourselves there for where under the what Mighty hand of who God that he may exalt you when in due time how casting all your care upon him why because he cares for you and meanwhile in in that white space that we talked about last time be sober be vigilant always always alert paying attention because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour don't be his next meal whom resist steadfast in the faith don't let your guard down even for a moment Peter described Joseph so well in these verses the next is from a letter Paul wrote to a church never visited written at the same time he penned a letter to a person in that church regarding a slave turn to Colossians 3 verse 22 Paul says servants that's literally slaves obey in all things your Masters according to the flesh not with ey Service as men Pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing God exactly the way Joseph served potier and whatsoever you do do it heartily as to the Lord not unto men knowing that in complete confidence not hoping or wishing but knowing that of your Earthly Master no of the Lord you shall receive the reward what reward of The Inheritance how do you know no for ye serve the Lord Christ that also describes Joseph the next reading is a single verse nearby James 4 he simply says humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord he's with you everywhere you can't hide from him you're always in his sight humble yourselves therefore in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up and we'll see that exactly happening in this evening's lesson please be seated a quick recap in part one we saw Joseph who was his dad's favorite son he had two dreams his brothers had hated him it made them made him hate him even more after the first one and they became jealous after the second one his dad Jacob sent him to check on his brothers who were pastoring sheep about 50 miles away they saw Joseph coming decided to kill him but they were dissuaded first by Ruben who got them to delay things toss them in a pit and just hold off for a bit and then by Judah Who convinced the others to sell Joseph to some Israelite spice traders that were headed for Egypt they then took Joseph's coat dipped it in a young goat's blood deceiving their father to believe that Joseph had been killed by some wild animal in part two we learned why the brother brothers were confident the spice Traders would sell Joseph into slaver in Egypt Joseph was sold to potier the captain of Pharaoh's guard he he worked hard showed himself to be trustworthy and smart he was eventually promoted and became Piper's Chief Operating Officer For Better or Worse Joseph was a very handsome young man in his mid 20s attracted the attention of Mrs P She kept trying to seduce him and in her failure framed him for execution in part three we found that potier knew his wife was guilty but rather than execute Joseph potier sent him to the Royal VIP prison where he again became the number two person running the prison during his time there he interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh's Chief cup Bearer and chief Baker after that he spent two more years in the prison in the in the white space between chapters 40 and 41 and in that space he became very familiar with the protocol personalities and workings of soret 2's Royal Court we endered part three with soret having two dreams that struck him personally as they could mean bad things were going to happen to his family none of the Court magicians or wise men could help him they couldn't tell him what the dreams meant and and the dream manual used by the professional interpreters didn't help we also saw that the surviving fragment of a dream manual including uded the cup bearer's dream but its interpretation was exactly the opposite of what Joseph told him it had meant the chief cup Bearer then told Pharaoh about a Hebrew slave and Piper's Detention Center who could interpret dreams Pharaoh sent for this person we know this person as Joseph let's pick up our story as the cup Bearer is finishing recounting his experience with Joseph in the prison and The Round House in the pit in the dungeon two years prior the cup Bearer is speaking and he's speaking in the third person and he speaking to pharaoh and it came to pass as Joseph interpreted our dreams to us so it was me Pharaoh restored unto mine office as Chief cup Bearer Butler and and him the baker Pharaoh hanged then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph and they brought him hastily pharaoh anxious this can't wait an extra minute you guys can't help me go get this guy so they brought him hastily out of the dungeon can you see potier rushing back to his house shouting to the warden open the gate to the prison dungeon a flash of sunlight pierces the darkness within the prison outlined in that darkness is the imposing figure of a very nervous potier as he enters he calls for Joseph come out at once Joseph quickly emerges from the Gloom holding up his hand and blinking his eyes at all of a sudden brightness come with me Joseph Pharaoh's had two dreams no one can interpret you remember his Butler and Baker from two years ago the butler claims you correctly interpreted their dreams now Senor wants you to interpret his dreams dreams more like nightmares and uh uh uh Joe uh let's keep the matter of Mrs p and wi are serving in the prison between us okay and we readed he shaved himself and changed His Garment changed his reignment Egyptians especially nobility shaved their entire bodies every hair was gone they wore wigs appearance was very important as was cologne the smells of the spice Traders here we see yet another parallel with Jesus recall Jes Jesus was in a pit a tomb he was wrapped in spices when the door was opened the stone rolled away the Morning Light flashed within he was no longer there he had a change of reignment Peter saw his grave clothes and headscarf in the tomb where Jesus left them behind and he was not even recognized by his closest friends after his change of appearance Mary Magdalene thought he was the gner until he spoke her name and shortly after leaving his tomb his pit he ascended to sit at the right hand of the Throne of God go back to Joseph so Joseph's body was shaved scalp beard oh I don't know if I don't if I'd like that everywhere he was given proper attire and no doubt perfumed again recalling the odors of his forced march to Egypt eyeliner applied and came in under Pharaoh the Egyptian god king and Pharaoh senusret wasting no time said unto Joseph I have dreamed a dream there's none that can interpret it I've heard say of thee by my cup Bearer here that that you can understand a dream to interpret it Joseph answered Pharaoh using all the skills knowledge he had gained during his years in the white space correct demeanor tilting his head in respect speaking with humility saying it's not in me me God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace and Pharaoh said unto Joseph in my dream behold I stood upon the bank of the river and behold they came up out of the river seven cows fat fleshed well favored oh they they fed in a meadow and behold seven other cows came up after them poor and very ill-favored and lean fleshed s gets a little emotional offering a new retail he leans over looks Joseph in the such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for Badness and the lean and ill-favored cows did eat up the first seven fat cows and when they had eaten them up it could not be known they had eaten them at all they were still ill-favored is it the beginning so I awoke and then I fell asleep and dreamed again and I saw in my dream and behold seven ears of grain came up and one One stock full and good and behold seven ears withered thin blasted with the East Wind sprung up after them and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears I told this unto The Magicians but there was none that declar the meaning of it to me Joseph said unto Pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one both dreams have a common meaning God ha showed Pharaoh what he is about to do again humility Pharaoh doesn't have a clue but God is showing Joseph through Pharaoh's dreams what is about to happen Joseph could be Brash and say oh I know what this is but he doesn't he isn't like that it's always about Pharaoh he knows Court protocol he understands egos he spent two years in that white space those seven good cows are seven years uh seven good ears of grain are seven years the the dreams are one the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years and the Seven empty ears blasted with the East Wind shall be seven years of famine this is the thing which I have spoken under Pharaoh what God is about to do he showeth Pharaoh not shown to me but God has shown through me to pharaoh Joseph is humbly saying in other words thus sayeth the Lord wrong way behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the Plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt by the famine that will consume the land the Plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following it shall be very Grievous and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice it came two times in two forms is because the thing is established by God and God will shortly bring it to pass you can imagine somebody's many people's perhaps Jaws dropping a seven-year famine in Egypt what there may have been a Court historian present who could lean over and whisper in Pharaoh's ear telling about a drought in the third Dynasty this is rare about 800 years earlier so famous in fact there was a stone Stella erected on sahal Island at Aswan that recorded it it it reads in part I was in mourning on my Throne my heart was in great Affliction because happy the the river God had failed to come in time in a period of seven years grain was scant Colonels were dried up scarce was every kind of food children cried youngsters fell the hearts of the old were grieving legs drawn up they hugged the ground everyone was in distress and only 42 years before the moment Joseph speaks to Pharaoh there had been another less serious famine uncommon not unheard of but seven years disaster and now some free advice Joseph learned all about court protocol in prison during the white space so he's not intimidated by speaking to the king in this way he knows how to keep Pharaoh at the center of things he's been a good student of protocol and politics but notice what Joseph says is much more than free advice last year we went through all the books of the Minor Prophets there was a consistent theme you probably recall judgment destruction ction was coming but always with a Lifeline always with hope and the spiritual it was based on repentance taking action to turn from sin here we'll see the Lord offering the same thing it's the same Lord a Lifeline hope Pharaoh listen to The Prophet Joseph heed what he says to save yourself and your nation now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet humble knows how to handle himself and wise wiser than the wise men who couldn't interpret your dreams and set them over the land of Egypt let Pharaoh do this let him appoint officers over the land take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years now the normal tax was 10% they had a thing that called a nilometer along the Nile a whole board in the ground and calibrated depending on how high the Nile Rose during the flood time they would know that a good farmer doing a good job would get so much yield per acre they calculated the tax on that if you weren't such a good farmer well you were paying more than 10% but it was based on what you should get so Joseph is telling Pharaoh double the tax and let the new wheat officials gather all the wheat of those good years that come and lay up the grain under the hand of Pharaoh let them keep food in the city and and that wheat shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt that the land perish not through the famine and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants hey I like that double the tax and it's done as a national tax not a local tax gome by gnome or county by county so it increases my wealth and power and by reducing a supply we prop up the price of wheat during the glut huh what's not to like kind of the the debeers of wheat Pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of God is a guy who can interpret dreams not listed in the book and Pharaoh said to Joseph for as much as God has showed thee all this including your proposals about how to manage things and double the taxes there is none so discreet and wise as you I know these things I'm pharaoh and we'll see later this evening how Pharaoh takes credit for one of Joseph's most amazing accomplishments a friend I worked for for years once commented to me he said Lyle it's amazing what you can accomplish if you don't care who gets the credit very true words thou Joseph sh be over my house house and according unto Thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will I be greater than thou you'll be my right hand man and Pharaoh said to Joseph see I have set thee over all the land of Egypt oh by the way Piper yeah yeah be sure to protect Joseph you're working for him now he's a Hebrew Egyptians don't take orders from Hebrews but but we need this one and Pharaoh took off his signant ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen put a gold chain about his neck and Joseph be sure you keep your body shaved wear a wig use cologne and eyeliner and do your best to look like an Egyptian this signant ring is from King tudan common about 750 years after Joseph received Senus rett's similar ring the pharaoh's signant ring served as a modern equivalent in our society of his signature we saw about executive orders in the big signature at the bottom and this case you just stamp it with your signant Ring The Ring gave Joseph the power to do almost anything allowed of the central government recall in our study of Esther how morai used the king's Ring to seal official documents it's a big deal giving Joseph tremendous Authority not unlike his special coat indicated his preferred position and Authority when he was 17 and Pharaoh made Joseph to ride in the second Chariot which he had the Chariot for his second in command this image is is uh King tutt's ceremonial Chariot and they cried before him bow the knee and senusret made Joseph ruler over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I'm pharaoh and I decree that with without your permission or approval no man shall as much as lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh called Joseph's name zapan panea it's an Egyptian not a Hebrew name and he gave him to wife azth the daughter of pipera priest of an oh zafy have you been to my hometown own there's a new obl there you should see I used to play by it with my friends when I was a little girl oh I'm getting all tingly and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt other translations say he inspected went about his duties throughout the land of Egypt he's checking out the Farms deciding whether granard will be constructed to deal with the future famine to have storage from the years of plenty after his years working the fields on Piper's Estates where the Lord blessed the yield Joseph knows how to get the the best from the land of Egypt about the seasons and floods and irrigation all of it he's gathering information and sharing with the poorly performing Fields the best practices from the higher yielding farms and not just one and done but continually making sure the granaries will be full in preparation for the oncoming famine does that remind you of someone else Luke 3:21 we read now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that Jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice Came From Heaven which said Thou Art my beloved Son in thee I am well pleased sounds a bit like genesis 41:38 Pharaoh said to his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of God is and Jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age being as was supposed the son of Joseph and what did 30-year-old Jesus do Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues preaching the gospel of the Kingdom healing every sickness and every disease among the people back to 30-year-old Joseph who let the presence of pharaoh and went out over all the land of Egypt look zaffy there's the Obelisk I was telling you about and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls handfuls of grain and he gathered up all the food all the wheat of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt Egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which is round about every city laid up in the same and Joseph gathered corn grain as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering it for it was without number I've got microphone number two here Joseph was trying to count His blessings and he had so many blessings he finally stopped Counting he couldn't count them that probably reminds us of us now I think that there's three people out here in the audience that have question for me um I don't see anyone raising their hand but I think Adam over here just might be a fellow with a question you got a question you said this all happened 4,000 years ago yeah how can you be sure of of this particular amount of years well that's a very good question very astute I'll answer that we'll go over that I don't want you to take my word for it and and I think someone else has a question yes I oh I see somebody smiling over it must be Lydia Lydia do you have a question you keep saying that zarat the second was the king during the time of Joseph how are you sure it wasn't some other king with all the uncertainties in the history of Egypt and life of pharaohs in the periods of intermediacy and all that that's also a very very good question oh somebody in the AV Booth waving her hand I think it's Ava okay Ava how did 20% of the grain provide enough food for the people of Egypt and for the people who bought grain oh that's another tyffy how with only 20% of the Harvest can you feed everybody and feed people from the surrounding areas both your friends and those that aren't your friends what they say you know keep your friends close and your enemies closer feed your enemies do good to them that despitefully use you those are very very good questions let's try and answer them the first question was about years 4,000 years how can we be sure what that year might be well let's answer that question and and look at the calendar years now this plus the answer about the Pharaohs is to take about six or seven minutes we have to drill down a little bit please do your best to stay awake um and if you go to sleep please don't snore okay in various civilizations records are often kept by the year the reign of a king like the fifth year of King rehoboam we need to be able to synchronize these dates with our calendar so with that what's the First Resource we should use the Bible so let's turn there it doesn't know about our calendar but it gives us periods between some significant events so we'll start with those in First Kings chapter 6 we read it came to pass in the 480th year after the children of Israel would come out of the land of Egypt know W's Passover The Exodus in the fourth year of Solomon's Reign Over Israel in the month of Z which is the second month that he began to build the house of the Lord the temple so let's try and start to make a little timeline we we'll anchor it with the Exodus the Passover and we know that 480 years later there's a start of the temple construction which is in the fourth year of King Solomon that's nice but there's no surviving records of other places that tell us about either of those events to enable us to synchronize them to anything so is there another statement in the Bible we can turn to that brings us a little closer to the time of Joseph turns out there is Exodus 12 we read the sojourning of the children of Israel the arrival of Jacob and his family who dwelt in Egypt was 430 years came to pass at the end of the 430 years the S same day it came to pass that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt The Exodus so we can add that to our timeline and that's in Joseph's time we'll be seeing that in another lesson or two so we've got 430 years before the Passover is when Jacob Israel the family the enter Egypt 480 years after that Solomon starts building the Temple but we still don't have any event we can align with our calendar at least none that's been discovered yet so let's move a little closer to our time who succeeded Solomon as king of Judah right rabam in the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was 40 years Solomon slept with his fathers was buried in the city of David his father and rehoboam his son reigned in instead 40 Years of Solomon and then we get rabo from First Kings 11 I use the word Ascend there because that rather than put became king or something that takes up too much space it won't fit you can't read it the text to be too small because most of you don't have binoculars and you sit too far back so this is an event in the Bible that corresponds it turns out with both secular history and archaeological discoveries it it happens this event during the reign of rehoboam a pharaoh named shank whom the Bible calls shishak invaded Judah and Jerusalem First Kings 14 it came to pass in the fifth year of King Ray oboom that hak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem he didn't conquer it shishak took away all the Treasures of the house of the Lord and the Treasures of the King's house raob bomes he took away all he took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made so rayoo basically bribed shishak to leave so this is shak's bragging wall in the temple at Carnac in modern day Luxor that has list his conquest and very Victorious campaign into Judah when we were there in 2021 I asked our guide where is that we had some free time so he took hea andah to see it it was carved in the temple wall after the conquest and during the life of this guy so this relief this carving in the wall this brag dates to the reign of rabo and an event that we know in the Bible well let's add this event to our timeline shishak invades rabam 5 okay so the anchor event I've highlighted it in yellow in the Bible is the Exodus the Passover the anchor event in secular history will be shak's Invasion so we can figure out between Solomon's year four raob blah blah blah that we get 41 years then 480 years then 430 years now there is some controversy about whether shishak in the Bible is shank in the hog but the majority of Scholars who study these things are convinced it's the same and the year of his campaign into Judah is generally agreed to be 925 926 BC on our calendar so let's add the dates this tells us that The Exodus occurred in 1446 BC but more important for us Jacob and his family relocated to Egypt in 1876 BC that's fairly precise finally let's take what we have read or will read in Joseph's story and fill in some of the rest of the years in Joseph's life using 1876 BC as our time anchor so Jacob and the family come at the end of the second year a famine we'll read the famine lasts seven years we just read that that's what's going to happen there were seven years of bumper crops before that Joseph was promoted before that first year of Plenty and he was 30 years old at that time he was 17 when he okay we can stop L that's good we we we we get it okay so so that's a long answer Adam to your to your question about dates but it's probably a better answer than trust me that's when it was okay we had another question I Lydia was scratching her head back there a little bit how can we be sure which Pharaoh had the dreams of Joseph and interpreted them here we're really fortunate because Egypt's calendar was fairly accurate was 300 65 days but they forgot leap year so what happens is every four years things slip by a day so so spring occurs every four years at a different day than it should have and over this is an ancient Kingdom that goes on for thousands of years so it gets really confusing so everything in their life depended upon when is a Nile going to flood and they they were smart people they looked at the sky and they figured out that you know there's a star serious that's what we call it it's one of the brightest objects in the sky and they look for a certain relationship of of it to the Sun and the dawn the technical term of that is called the heliacal rising of Sirius Sirius down in the corner there well okay there's a sighting of this event recorded in an ancient document that has survived over the Millennia it's called the Papyrus Berlin 100012 there won't be a test it's okay there's only one other such sighting in surviving ancient Egyptian records which was 400 years later so this document is very very special it's very rare without boring you further with the details it tells us that year seven of the reign of seor stret III a son of and the successor to soret II was in 1871 BC so let's stick this on our timeline along with the length of the reign of soret 2 and we can see from this that seset 2 is the pharaoh that had the dreams and by the way there there's a book that was published in 2013 I'm sure you all want a copy of this radiocarbon in the chronologies of ancient Egypt um you'll go to sleep if you have problems with insomnia get this book you won't make it through the first page but there's a very interesting statement that they make in there on page 27 says the heliacal rising of Sirius would have occurred on for peret 16 that's an Egyptian calendar reference in 1871 BC dating year 7 is Senus to that year this is widely considered to be the earliest independently verified absolute date in recorded history and it's in the time of Joseph now you might say well that's just a coincidence that that this very rare document enables us to nail this down exactly I don't think that it's a coincidence as is normal in Academia there are people with different opinions there's not 100% agreement about this okay enough math and dates go ahead and poke your neighbor wake him up okay you're awake thank you for not snoring the last question that we had very insightful question from our sister Ava back there in the AV booth she said how can a 20% Harvest Feed everyone and and feed the neighboring areas as well we're not going to do any math let's look at some pictures instead okay Fastener seat bels fume in this photo you see modern Egypt from space the Nile is that little green belt moving up there you'll notice because I put a bright yellow box around it another green area this is a low-lying Oasis or lake or Marsh area that's 550 to 650 square miles in size that's if you had a one mile wide thing it would go for about 600 miles the length of the Nile that they're farming right this place is called fiume it's a little hard to see let's let's zoom in especially in ancient times it could potentially produce as much or nearly as much wheat as a cultivated part of the Nile prior to Joseph's time this was just a depression in the desert little small Oasis it may have had a little bit of seasonal water or L not very productive but brother ly we just read that Joseph traveled throughout Egypt yeah he saw fume and he must have thought you know if that place had a supply of water H you see the circle part of the picture that's how Joseph got water to fume this is one of the first major waterwork projects in the entire world the canal that ties the fiume Basin to the Nile ensuring a reliable source of water and soil replenishment dates to the reign of senusret 2 history gives him credit as the Pharaoh that developed this region he engraved it over a whole bunch of his little things that pharaohs like to brag about the canal is named after the person who really is responsible to this day it's known as baru the canal of Joseph it follows a natural path that before the canal might allow some water from the Nile into that place at Peak flooding of the Nile but with the canal much more water could be reliably diverted there by dramatically increasing the area of watered usable Farmland Joseph radically increased grain production in Egypt during the years of plenty perhaps doubled it and this probably wasn't taxed at 20% but more likely at 100% it belonged to the government to Pharaoh under Joseph's Direction the canal is 9 and 12 miles long and 16t deep dug by hand 4,000 years ago unprecedented Waterworks projects didn't exist back then remember Pharaoh's observation Pharaoh said unto Joseph for as much as God has showed thee all this there's none so discreet and wise as you this is an old photo of the canal of Joseph and the fume it's not like the little Canal you see running through Arizona it's not a narrow little ditch No 9 and a half miles long 16 feet deep you get a sense of how wide it was it's an old photo well there's one more thing before we get back to our story since we're talking about these kinds of things remember I said last time that uh there was a princess named soranet named after the goddess hator represented by a cow part of the reason that soret 2 was so upset by that first Dream the starving cows that she had a special tomb in s's funerary complex well this is a photo and a diagram of that complex he had a pyramid made for his remains its granite and linstone core was covered in mud brick not Stone so it's eroded a lot over 4,000 years but you can see it was huge a lot of mud bricks it's indicated by that royal blue arrow in the plan view it's the large pyramid you notice several small rectangular buildings which had the remains of various Nobles and family members and stuff near its northern end but there's a second pyramid smaller than his pointed by the red arrow it's the only other pyramid in that complex much grander than the other buildings this is the special tomb of s hator unet where her pectoral necklace was found and by the way Senus ru's entire funerary complex is alongside the Joseph Canal at fume what a mighty God we serve back to our text Genesis 41 and unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which azath the daughter of pipera priest of own bore unto him did you ever notice that the names of the wives of Jacob's sons the 12 Patriarchs are not in the Bible two exceptions azeneth the wife of Joseph and Tamar the the levite wife of Judah whom we'll discuss in a later part of the Joseph story both are Gentiles just like Ruth and Rahab in the genealogy of Jesus adopted father we don't know the names of any of the other wives Joseph called the name of his firstborn manasse causing to forget for he said God hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house and the name of the second he called ephriam double fruit for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my Affliction and the seven years of plenteousness was in the land of Egypt were ended and the seven years of dir of crop failures of famine began to come according as Joseph had said and AD Earth was in all the surrounding lands but in all the land of Egypt there was bread when all the land of Egypt was famished the people cried to Pharaoh for bread and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians go under Joseph what he sayth you do another type or model of Christ is playing out here starving dying in a world of sin go to Jesus what he saith to you do not just hear repeat do we're getting back to Genesis what a strange thing for the king to say in in fact he's saying don't ask me Joseph's in charge of all this ask him everybody already knew that right after all didn't Pharaoh appoint Joseph to do this very thing maybe not let me give you a couple of Clues as to what's going on recall we read from Psalm 10517 to19 and part two of the Joseph story about the Lord sent Joseph as a slave to Egypt prior to a famine well here are the next three verses and the King we know now is senusret 2 sent and loose Joseph even the ruler of the people and let him go free throughout the land of Egypt he made him Lord of his house and ruler of all his substance just like potier just like The Roundhouse Warden the number two guy the Chief Operating Officer the the vazer as they're sometimes called to bind his princes at his pleasure and and teaches Senators wisdom verse 22 I I scratched my head when I read that I don't know if you scratch your I mean maybe you scratched your hair I don't have hair I have to scratch my head the King James translation of verse 22 is strange Egypt didn't have a senate and why would you tie up or confine the pharaoh's Sons well we'll go to the NIV a different translation and it will Enlighten us on verse 22 to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his Elders wisdom in other words Joseph was responsible for educating teaching and mentoring senusret to's Sons the princes and in a future part of our story Joseph when talking to his brothers will tell them God hath made me a father to pharaoh and Lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt why would he say that that he was fathered a pharaoh what's going on my turn to ask a question do you remember the timeline I showed you a few minutes ago with the Pharaohs on it those of you that had binoculars or were sitting close no well let me display it again soret to is died and is inside his pyramid he died just just as the years of plenty ended just as the years of bad crops and subsequent famine were beginning his son Senus set 3 has ascended to the throne of Egypt and is now King but he's new at the job he's telling the people that just as his father had made Joseph the vizer the the number two guy he's doing the same continuity in the midst of Crisis don't ask me ask Joseph the new Pharaoh trusts and respects Joseph the one who predicted the very famine that began with his Ascension a good news for seset three this means he's not cursed displeasing the gods and causing the famine as some might think oh your dad died you come to the throne we're having bad Harvest we need to do something about that no no no the famine was predicted seven or eight years earlier by Joseph Egypt had been preparing for it for seven years Gathering grain building granaries to store it during the years of the bumper crop so Joseph tells his brothers that he's like a father to the new Pharaoh senior thre 3 the guy that he educated the guy that he mentored the guy that he taught who is really in charge Pharaoh Senus 3 is Lord of the famine Joseph is Lord of the feast in a future lesson if I don't forget feel free to remind me I'll share with you some additional extra biblical information not six or seven minutes worth maybe one or two minutes that reinforces the timing of the famine and the Bible Narrative of Joseph's actions by way of some details from history of s 3's Reign moving on the famine was over all the face of the Earth Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain unto the Egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt and continued and got worse and worse and all countries people from nearby regions came into Egypt to Joseph to buy Grain because the famine was so bad in all those lands it extended to the land of Canaan drought crop failure famine starvation death reading on Genesis 42 now when Jacob saw when he heard when he learned when he understood he's 120 years old he wasn't traveling around looking around much when he saw that there was grain available in Egypt Jacob said to his sons why do you look upon one another why are you just standing around around staring at each other he said behold I have heard that we're out of time but the story of my son Joseph will continue in two more weeks in it Joseph will get one of the most unsettling shocks of his entire life you won't want to miss part five listen to Jacob now that Joseph is finally out of prison no longer a Slave let's see the parallel model or type of Christ his life displays thus far the musicians would would please come Joseph was sent by his father to the sons of Israel as was Jesus they reject him abuse him betray him then try to cover their sin before their father by the blood of a substitute a sacrificial animal a kid when Jesus was being crucified and his blood was being shed it was exactly at the time that the people that were responsible for having him in that state were doing their morning sacrifice at the sacrificial lamb the third hour when Jesus finally expired six hours later the ninth hour is when they were doing another daily offering the evening offering of a sacrificial animal Joseph is sold for silver stripped of Glory made a servant sounds like Jesus Joseph is mistreated tempted falsely accused sentenced for sins he did not commit as was Jesus But ultimately Joseph is raised by command of the Divine King restored and exalted as was Jesus Joseph began his public Ministry at age 30 as did Jesus and for what purpose to offer salvation and Life to a starving and dying world a world that didn't yet realize its need when the Egyptians recognized their need they came to je to Joseph for bread when we come to recognize our need we come to Jesus who said for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world they said unto him Lord ever more give us this bread Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger if there's anyone here that has not received salvation through Jesus Christ perhaps you think you don't need it or him and part because you're living in a world of Plenty don't miss your time or your opportunity to receive him or be received by him not to avoid some future catastrophe not some sort of fire or life insurance but because you recognize the sacrifice he made on your behalf loving you while you didn't even know him or even actively against him an enemy we love him why because he first loved us our motivation should always be based on love not fear well let's worship Him in song with make me more like thee as we close the service make me more like thee Jesus make me more like thee give me a heart [Music] that's filled with love and make me more like thee make me more like the Jesus make me more like give me a heart that's filled with love and may be more like [Music] thee and
