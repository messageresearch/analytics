[2:35] You Say I Am as Brother Daniel comes.
[2:41] We'll start with verse one. Who am I
[2:43] that the highest king would welcome me?
[2:46] What a thought to think. Creator of the
[2:49] heavens and earth.
[2:51] The whole universe created each one of
[2:53] us, but not only do all that, but
[2:56] welcome us to be his sons and daughters
[2:59] to come live with him in his kingdom.
[3:01] Can you believe it? Amen.
[3:07] Who am I that the highest king would
[3:12] welcome
[3:14] me?
[3:17] I was lost but he brought me. Oh his
[3:22] love for me.
[3:27] Oh his love for me.
[3:32] who the sun sets free.
[3:37] Oh, it's free
[3:40] indeed.
[3:42] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am
[3:54] free at last. He has ransom me. His
[3:58] grace runs deep.
[4:04] While I was a sin to slave, Jesus died
[4:09] for me.
[4:12] Yes, he died for me.
[4:17] Who the sun sets free.
[4:22] Oh, is free indeed.
[4:27] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am.
[4:37] In my father's
[4:40] house,
[4:42] there's a place for me.
[4:46] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am. Sing that
[4:53] again. Who the son?
[4:56] who the sun sets free.
[5:01] Oh, is free indeed.
[5:05] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am.
[5:14] Oh, in my father's
[5:18] house
[5:19] there's a place for me.
[5:24] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am. I am
[5:32] chosen.
[5:34] I am chosen.
[5:36] Not forsaken.
[5:39] I am who you say I am.
[5:43] You are for me, not against me.
[5:49] I am who you say I am.
[5:53] I am chosen,
[5:56] not forsaken.
[5:58] I am who you say I am.
[6:03] You are for me, not against me.
[6:08] I am who you say I am.
[6:13] I am who you say I am.
[6:19] who the sun sets free.
[6:24] Oh, is free indeed.
[6:29] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am. Would you
[6:36] all stand with me this morning? In my
[6:39] father's
[6:42] house,
[6:44] there's a place for me.
[6:48] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am.
[6:58] Amen. Who is a child of God this
[7:01] morning? Raise your hand up there high
[7:03] because it's the greatest honor that you
[7:05] could have. Let's bow our heads. Father,
[7:07] we're grateful Lord that we can raise
[7:10] our hands and say that I am a child of
[7:12] God.
[7:14] Lord, we are your sons and your
[7:16] daughters. And we pray Lord that we
[7:18] could live a life that would be pleasing
[7:20] to you and that Lord that you would join
[7:24] us
[7:25] &gt;&gt; in this service. Bless us Lord with your
[7:28] presence. We pray we love you in Jesus
[7:31] name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. God
[7:35] bless you.
[7:44] God bless you all. Welcome. I I didn't
[7:46] get a list of visitors, but I heard
[7:47] brother Arie recognize a few. Welcome.
[7:50] We We appreciate you coming. God bless
[7:53] Nina back there. Is it Zeke? Welcome.
[7:56] God bless you. It's good to have you in
[7:57] service. And any other visitors we have.
[8:01] Um we're grateful. Uh we took up the
[8:03] offering this morning for uh the work
[8:07] that we are helping out with in Durban,
[8:10] South Africa. I mentioned it a few times
[8:13] and I'll mention it again. We'll see uh
[8:15] as long as the Lord leads in this
[8:17] direction, we'll continue uh supporting
[8:21] brother Steven Young and the work that
[8:23] he has there. And uh I am always willing
[8:27] to change as the Lord changes direction.
[8:29] But things are have been going very very
[8:31] well. Brother Steven sent me a letter
[8:34] yesterday and I asked him to could you
[8:37] give us a report that I could read to
[8:39] the church and he sent me this
[8:43] report from uh brother Steven Young in
[8:45] South Africa. He said, "Brother Daniel
[8:46] and the saints of Tucson Tabernacle,
[8:48] greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus.
[8:51] I have so much good news to share with
[8:54] you all. Our little church has been
[8:57] growing steadily and even our midweek
[8:59] service was full of visitors. Now, if
[9:02] you remember right, this is um this st
[9:05] this church just started up a few months
[9:08] ago. So, this is a brand new church
[9:10] here, grassroots.
[9:12] Our little church has been growing
[9:14] steadily and even our midweek service
[9:15] was full of visitors. Though we were
[9:18] we're grateful for good attendance, our
[9:20] focus and emphasis is not on numbers,
[9:23] but rather in a genuine spiritual
[9:25] transformation in the lives of the
[9:27] people that we serve. In this regard,
[9:31] I've been greatly encouraged by a recent
[9:33] interaction we had with we had with a
[9:35] new believer, brother Kubin Governor,
[9:39] who on Sunday had his baby girl
[9:41] dedicated to the Lord. We blessed her
[9:44] according to Markap 10 verse 13- 16.
[9:47] Could you put the Yeah, there's the
[9:48] picture of a family that they had the
[9:50] little baby dedicated. Uh new people in
[9:53] the church there in South Africa. Um
[9:56] there's there's a large Indian uh from
[9:59] India population there that have their
[10:01] roots from India. There are the um the
[10:04] native Africans. There are the Dutch
[10:07] whites that are there. So it's a melting
[10:09] pot of a lot of different um races
[10:11] there.
[10:13] He says, "A few days later, thank you."
[10:15] "A few days later, he asked me to to pay
[10:18] him a visit at his work." This is uh
[10:21] Brother Kubin, "Pay him a visit at his
[10:23] work." And uh there he confessed that
[10:27] he's had a problem with with smoking
[10:29] weed, smoking marijuana since the COVID
[10:32] lockdown period, and has tried quitting,
[10:34] but was finding it challenging.
[10:37] We shared a portion of scripture with
[10:39] him in James chapter 5 and verse 16. And
[10:42] I told him that he had done right the
[10:46] right thing by speaking to us. Without
[10:48] telling him of his problem, we may never
[10:51] without him telling us of his problem,
[10:53] we may never have known what he was
[10:55] struggling with. We prayed the prayer of
[10:57] faith and we know that God will deliver
[11:00] him even as he has delivered us from the
[11:03] same spirits of bondage and bad habits.
[11:06] We further encouraged him to feed on the
[11:08] word of God wherever he feels tempted
[11:10] and to speak the word in faith because
[11:13] that's what Jesus demonstrated in the
[11:15] hour of his temptation.
[11:18] He quoted, "It is written, man shall not
[11:21] live by bread alone, but by every word
[11:23] that proceeds out of the mouth of God."
[11:26] &gt;&gt; My wife and I have both resumed our
[11:28] voluntary work with two orphanages in
[11:30] our vicinity. She spends a few hours
[11:32] with the children of Ethel Ethlbert
[11:35] Children's Home, a Methodistr run
[11:37] institution where she's been reading to
[11:39] the little ones and teaching them about
[11:41] the word of about God's word. And I have
[11:43] been called upon to assist some troubled
[11:45] youth at the Malver's Children's Home
[11:49] after we reunited one of the children
[11:52] residing there with his family who are
[11:55] homeless and living on the streets at
[11:57] the Durban Beachfront. It's quite a
[12:00] testimony how we even got involved with
[12:03] them in the first place. But when the
[12:05] social worker learned about our
[12:07] involvement, he somehow found my number
[12:09] and asked me to work with their young
[12:11] people on a regular basis. I get to see
[12:15] them for an hour every Friday. We even
[12:18] managed to receive a donation of
[12:20] chocolates. And for all the youth
[12:22] residing at for all the youth residing
[12:24] at the home and my family and I were
[12:27] able to deliver it just before
[12:29] Christmas. We thank God for all the
[12:31] smiles on their little faces. However,
[12:34] our heart's desire is for God to
[12:36] transform their lives and for them to
[12:39] make the most important choice, the
[12:41] choice to follow Christ. Please keep
[12:44] these young people in your prayers. I
[12:46] also received a report from brother
[12:49] Ramlan who from whom God has opened a
[12:52] door to the prison ministries. He is
[12:55] certainly the right man for the job and
[12:57] has a heart for the many broken lives
[13:00] trapped behind bars. He reported three
[13:03] baptisms over the past few weeks.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:14] He reported three baptisms over the past
[13:16] few weeks, which is a major breakthrough
[13:19] in the section of prison that he
[13:20] ministers at. Furthermore, our Lur
[13:23] church has just received an invitation
[13:25] to join a very wellestablished and
[13:27] missionary oriented church for the
[13:29] service tomorrow morning. The
[13:31] 88-year-old pastor, also wellrespected
[13:34] evangelist, had closed his Sunday
[13:37] evening service and supported our tent
[13:39] campaign in December. And he now desires
[13:43] for us to work together on a few
[13:45] outreach campaigns he has planned in the
[13:47] months ahead months ahead. We pray that
[13:50] the Lord will guide us and that we'll be
[13:52] effective laborers in his field. My
[13:54] family and I and the believers in Durban
[13:57] are grateful for all your love, prayers,
[14:00] and support for our ministry. And he
[14:03] says, and he he has a PS here. He says,
[14:06] Cynth, Sister Cynthia Zulu, another new
[14:09] believer, is also grateful for the
[14:11] financial assistance that she received
[14:14] from Tucson Tabernacle and from my
[14:16] brother, if you remember right, last
[14:18] month. her daughter's school fees were
[14:21] paid in full for 2026
[14:24] and as a result she was able to purchase
[14:26] some new clothes and good food for for
[14:29] her family. We are so thankful to the
[14:32] Lord for using you all to bless her
[14:35] family and ours. May God bless you all,
[14:37] brother Stephen and the Saints in
[14:39] Durban, South Africa. Amen.
[14:49] I do believe it's a worthy cause and and
[14:51] uh he's a he's a young he's a brother
[14:54] that is filled with the spirit and he
[14:57] has a burden for lost souls and I know
[15:00] that many of us share that same burden.
[15:03] We're going to get into the golden rule
[15:05] this morning. And uh last week we talked
[15:08] about how praying and how God gives the
[15:11] best gifts and how Jesus instructed us
[15:14] to ask and to seek and to knock and to
[15:18] ask and to keep asking. If we have a
[15:20] need then to ask God and keep putting it
[15:22] before him to seek and then to keep
[15:25] seeking and we seek. When we seek we are
[15:28] seeking for God's will in these things,
[15:31] not our own will. This is the hard part.
[15:34] We are going before the Lord and we're
[15:36] we're laying our own desires aside. And
[15:39] we are truly saying,"Lord, I want your
[15:43] will in this this desire that I have,
[15:47] Lord, or this need that I have. Lord, I
[15:49] want your will. If you want me to suffer
[15:51] a little longer, I'll suffer, Lord. If
[15:54] because I know you have a purpose. If if
[15:57] you want to heal me or if you want to
[15:59] for me to to to leave and to go
[16:01] somewhere else, Lord, I just want your
[16:03] will. Lord, help me. That is the seeking
[16:05] part. Remember, God doesn't bow to our
[16:08] will.
[16:10] We may get what we want against his will
[16:13] because of our own desires and not
[16:15] seeking the Lord, but it never works out
[16:18] well. So, we we seek and we keep seeking
[16:22] and then once we have found the will of
[16:23] God, then we go before him in the name
[16:26] of Jesus Christ and we knock.
[16:29] And that's where our faith comes in.
[16:31] When you know that you have the mind of
[16:32] Christ, when you know what the will of
[16:35] God is for your life, then you can go
[16:37] before the Lord in confidence and with
[16:39] faith and know that you will receive
[16:42] what you are asking for in God's time.
[16:46] And earlier in Matthew 7, we learn from
[16:49] our Lord Jesus in the sermon on the
[16:51] mount. He said, "We are not to judge
[16:53] others. And now that you realize that
[16:57] you have a log in your eye,
[17:00] make sure to get that out of your eye
[17:02] before you're working on the speck
[17:03] that's in somebody else's eye.
[17:06] Judge not that you be not judged is what
[17:08] he told us. Then then in Matthew chapter
[17:11] 6, now we see that our life shouldn't be
[17:14] focused on money or on worldly
[17:16] possessions. And now that that you you
[17:19] you shouldn't be praying to get in front
[17:21] of the people and draw attention to
[17:23] yourself, but you should be praying that
[17:25] in in secret and and going before the
[17:28] Lord for other people.
[17:31] And we were given in Matthew chapter 6,
[17:34] we were given an example
[17:37] of a prayer. We call it the Lord's
[17:39] prayer. Our Father who art in heaven,
[17:41] hallowed be thy name. And then
[17:46] Jesus taught us to prever prefer others
[17:48] over ourselves and to give to the needy
[17:50] and to store up our treasures in heaven.
[17:52] This is all in this masterpiece called
[17:54] the sermon on the mount. Matthew chapter
[17:57] 5 6 and 7. Then when we get when we
[17:59] started in Matthew 5, Jesus taught that
[18:02] we should love our enemies just like you
[18:05] love your friends
[18:07] and that you can commit murder by just
[18:09] hating someone and just slandering
[18:12] someone. that you can commit adultery by
[18:15] just desiring someone that's not your
[18:17] spouse. He's working on the heart. He's
[18:20] working on the inner man because he
[18:24] knows that that inner man will be
[18:25] manifested outwardly.
[18:28] He taught that we should be honest in
[18:30] our everyday lives. So honest that we
[18:32] should never have to say I promise I I
[18:35] swear that this is the truth. No, you
[18:37] should be have such respect because of
[18:39] the honesty that you always speak that
[18:41] you just say the word and people know
[18:44] that this brother or this sister is
[18:46] telling the truth.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; And he started his sermon with the
[18:50] biatitudes, the blessings, the Christian
[18:53] progression. Blessed are the poor in
[18:56] spirit. They understand that there is
[18:58] something lacking in their life. I had
[19:01] this conversation with a young man about
[19:05] about this um when I was in
[19:06] Jeffersonville a couple days ago and
[19:09] it's just so full of wisdom
[19:12] and he he he understood he he never
[19:15] really understood what is the whole
[19:17] purpose of Jesus and Christianity and
[19:20] you bring him right back to this this
[19:22] just the very start of the sermon on the
[19:24] mount and then it just makes things make
[19:27] sense.
[19:29] Blessed are those who mourn. They feel
[19:30] bad for their sins and they regret what
[19:33] they've done.
[19:35] For they shall be comforted. Blessed are
[19:37] the meek. They humble themselves before
[19:39] the Lord and they admit that they need a
[19:41] change in their life. For they shall
[19:43] inherit the earth. Blessed are those who
[19:45] hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[19:47] Now that they've changed, now that
[19:49] there's desires have changed in their
[19:51] life, they they're going to make those
[19:53] changes. They're hungering and thirsting
[19:55] after righteousness.
[19:57] Blessed are the pure in heart. Now they
[20:00] receive a new heart. Once you become a
[20:02] Christian, you've given your heart to
[20:03] the Lord. There's a change that takes
[20:05] place in you. That old stony heart is
[20:07] gone. And now the desire in your heart
[20:10] is to serve God. And that replaces the
[20:12] the desire for sin that you used to
[20:14] have. The Christian progression is
[20:17] getting higher as Jesus is going through
[20:18] the biatitudes. And he says he says,
[20:22] "Blessed are the peacemakers. Now
[20:23] they're on the battlefield for the Lord.
[20:26] Instead of fighting and causing discord
[20:28] and causing problems, they desire peace
[20:30] and harmony in the body of Christ.
[20:34] Blessed are those, then we come to this
[20:36] last one. Blessed are those who are
[20:38] persecuted for righteousness sake, for
[20:41] theirs is the kingdom of heaven. And
[20:43] then when we finally get there, when we
[20:47] finally give our hearts to the Lord,
[20:51] when we finally make that commitment,
[20:53] when when the when the Lord fills us
[20:55] with his spirit, then we can rest
[20:57] assured that we will be persecuted for
[21:01] what we believe. It's part of it.
[21:05] Now, we understand the biatitudes. We
[21:06] understand the Christian progression.
[21:08] And
[21:10] really Jesus said in in Matthew chapter
[21:13] 5, he also said he said, ' Don't
[21:15] misunderstand why I have come. I didn't
[21:17] come to abolish the law of Moses and the
[21:19] or the writings of the prophets. These
[21:21] this Old Testament, this Bible that was
[21:23] in place at that time was very
[21:25] important. He said, I didn't come to do
[21:26] away with any of it. He said, I came to
[21:29] accomplish its purpose. I came to
[21:31] fulfill
[21:33] this law and the prophets. And now we
[21:37] get to that point. We've gone through
[21:40] all the biatitudes and we've gone
[21:41] through all the teachings on adultery
[21:42] and marriage and and and and lying and
[21:45] all of these different things and and we
[21:47] get to this point where Jesus now is
[21:51] going to bring us to the next level. And
[21:54] he says this word,
[21:57] he says, "Therefore."
[22:01] So all that I just summarized, all of
[22:03] the teaching in this first sermon that
[22:07] Jesus preached, he goes through all of
[22:08] these things and he says, "Therefore,
[22:13] or we might say, so
[22:16] why all of these things?"
[22:20] He's going to paint now. He's been very
[22:22] specific before. Now he's just going to
[22:24] paint with a broad brush in Matthew
[22:26] chapter 7.
[22:28] before. He's been very specific, but
[22:30] watch him sum it up right now. He says,
[22:33] "Therefore," Matthew chapter 7:12,
[22:38] and this is a golden scripture,
[22:41] and it's very, very important.
[22:44] Matthew chapter 7 verse 12 says this
[22:48] therefore remember he brought all the
[22:50] way up to there up to here
[22:53] and he says now
[22:55] this is why
[22:57] all things
[22:59] whatsoever you would that men should do
[23:02] to you do even so to them for this is
[23:08] the law and the prophets
[23:11] he summed it up right
[23:13] Jesus often, and you'll see as you read
[23:16] through this sermon on the mount and you
[23:18] get really familiar with it, you'll see
[23:20] later on Jesus in Matthew and and in
[23:22] Luke and and the apostles do the same
[23:24] thing. You'll see that they they go back
[23:27] to this sermon on the mount. And Jesus
[23:30] does this. He does this often in Matthew
[23:32] chapter 22. Long after he preached this
[23:35] sermon, he restates it. Matthew 22 verse
[23:38] number 34.
[23:41] But when the Pharisees had heard that he
[23:43] had put the Sadducees to silence, they
[23:45] were gathered together. Then one of
[23:47] them, which was a lawyer, asked him a
[23:49] question, tempting him and saying,
[23:51] "Master, which is the great commandment
[23:54] in the law?" So he's saying, "What is
[23:56] this all about?
[23:58] Jesus, Rabbi, what is this all about?
[24:01] What's the most important thing? If I
[24:03] really want to get it,
[24:06] what's the most important thing?"
[24:09] And Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt
[24:12] love the Lord thy God with all thy
[24:14] heart, and with all thy soul, and with
[24:15] all thy mind."
[24:17] So he's saying, "Love the Lord first.
[24:20] Above above all that you are, above all
[24:24] that that is in your heart and your soul
[24:28] and your mind, put God first in
[24:31] everything that you do. Love the Lord
[24:34] God first with everything that's in
[24:36] you."
[24:38] This is the first and the great
[24:40] commandment
[24:42] and the second is like it.
[24:46] So he's saying this second commandment
[24:49] is like to the like unto the first. Thou
[24:52] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[24:56] So these two commandments are similar.
[24:59] The amplified version of verse um the
[25:02] amplified translation of verse number 39
[25:05] says this. And the second is like it.
[25:08] You shall love your neighbor as
[25:10] yourself. That is unselfishly seek the
[25:13] best or the higher good for others.
[25:17] And on these two commandments, remember
[25:20] what I just read in Matthew chapter 7.
[25:22] Now later on he says, "And on these two
[25:25] commandments hang all the law and all
[25:27] the prophets." You know what he's
[25:28] talking about the law? That's Moses's
[25:31] writing Genesis through Deuteronomy.
[25:35] And then the prophets is everything
[25:37] outside of Moses's writing written by
[25:39] the prophets. So basically the whole
[25:41] Bible
[25:43] hangs on this
[25:46] that you love
[25:49] one another and you love the Lord God.
[25:53] Seems kind of simple, doesn't it? It's
[25:55] not.
[25:57] It's very, very important.
[26:00] So Moses's books, Joshua, Samuel, Kings
[26:03] and Chronicles, and Daniel and Jonah and
[26:05] Psalms and Proverbs and Malachi, all of
[26:07] it hangs on loving God and loving one
[26:11] another.
[26:13] Jesus is saying this. That's the most
[26:15] important thing and it's the thing
[26:16] that's so often forgot.
[26:20] This is the golden rule.
[26:23] Remember, treat others as you would have
[26:25] others treat you. The Bible doesn't call
[26:27] it the golden rule.
[26:29] It's said golden because we call it
[26:32] golden because gold is a standard of of
[26:34] the highest value. And if something,
[26:39] you know, if if something goes above and
[26:41] beyond, you just say, "Oh man, that was
[26:43] golden." You know, like that was the
[26:45] best.
[26:47] But the golden rule when Jesus was here
[26:50] was probably familiar
[26:53] to those that were around him as he was
[26:55] preaching on this this sermon on the
[26:57] mount. Sea of Galilee is over here and
[26:59] and the the disciples are down here and
[27:02] the people are gathering and when he
[27:04] talked about that this all the law and
[27:07] all the prophets hang on this to treat
[27:09] others to do unto others as you would
[27:11] have do unto you they pro it probably
[27:13] sounded a little familiar to them.
[27:16] Confucious
[27:18] in 600 BC 600 years earlier said this do
[27:24] not impose on others what you do not
[27:26] wish for yourself.
[27:29] Ancient Greece Thales
[27:32] said this about 600 BC also avoid doing
[27:36] what you would blame others for doing.
[27:41] Hinduism about 400 BC says this,
[27:46] "Do not to others
[27:49] what you do not wish done to yourself."
[27:52] This is the whole of Dharma. Heed it
[27:54] well.
[27:56] And in ancient Persia, Zorastrian
[27:59] Zorastriism
[28:02] 300 years BC,
[28:05] whatever is disagreeable to yourself, do
[28:08] not do it to others.
[28:10] Sounds familiar, huh? But it's
[28:12] different. Jesus said it different than
[28:15] all the other ones said it.
[28:18] Watch how Jesus says. Therefore, all
[28:21] things whatsoever you would that men
[28:23] should do to you, do you even so to
[28:27] them, for this is the law and the
[28:30] prophets. So everybody else is saying,
[28:31] "No, don't do don't do to those things
[28:34] that you don't like someone do to you."
[28:37] But Jesus is he puts it in the active
[28:39] sense. He puts it he he doesn't say as I
[28:41] always say it's not what you don't do
[28:43] for God that matters. You know when you
[28:46] you might go before the Lord and you
[28:48] might say Lord I quit drinking. I quit
[28:50] smoking. I quit doing this. I quit doing
[28:51] this. I didn't do this. I didn't do
[28:52] this. I didn't do that. Lord I didn't do
[28:54] anything for you.
[28:56] I know we shouldn't be doing those
[28:58] things. But we also have to do
[29:00] something. And that's how Jesus is
[29:02] saying it here. All the other ones says
[29:05] they say don't don't don't. Jesus says
[29:07] do.
[29:10] Therefore, all things whatsoever you
[29:11] would that men should do to you, even so
[29:14] do do ye even so to them. For this is
[29:18] the law and the prophets. So everything
[29:21] is summed up right here in this golden
[29:23] rule. It's important.
[29:27] Number one,
[29:29] it says to apply this in all things. And
[29:32] look up there, verse 12. Therefore, all
[29:34] things.
[29:36] And number two,
[29:38] Jesus difference from differs from the
[29:40] others because he is telling us to do
[29:42] something, not to not do something.
[29:46] So what does this have to do with you
[29:48] and me? You know, we can think, oh,
[29:50] well, I'd like it maybe if here's how I
[29:53] would want someone to treat me, so I'm
[29:56] going to treat them in the same way.
[30:00] So how can we apply this to our lives?
[30:03] One thing
[30:05] all of us have control of and words are
[30:07] more powerful now than they have ever
[30:09] been in the history of the world with
[30:11] social media and with the large
[30:12] microphone that everybody has is we have
[30:15] to be careful what we say. I was in the
[30:18] airport um two days ago coming home from
[30:23] Jeffersonville and I was sitting there
[30:25] and and um waiting for uh and waiting at
[30:29] the gate and there was these three um
[30:33] older folks that were there and uh they
[30:38] were obviously from a church and they
[30:41] were obviously some sort of officials in
[30:44] the church. And the lady that was there
[30:48] was a lady and and two men. And the lady
[30:54] kept praising Jesus and she kept talking
[30:57] about the Lord. And the other two men
[31:01] while she was there, they would they
[31:03] would kind of talk about the Lord. And
[31:05] then when she would leave,
[31:08] they would start
[31:10] and they started talking about
[31:13] the uh a deacon in the church. These two
[31:17] men talking to each other and how he was
[31:20] after power and he was on a power trip
[31:22] and they were talking they were talking
[31:23] about him. Then they said, "You remember
[31:25] when Bishop so and so came or when
[31:27] Apostle so and so came and and how he
[31:29] SET HE HE SET THAT IN ORDER AND HE they
[31:32] said the one said the brother." I was
[31:34] like, "Amen, BROTHER. YOU PREACH IT,
[31:35] BROTHER. THAT'S RIGHT." AND HE WAS HE
[31:37] WAS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT that deacon and
[31:39] that deacon was wrong and he was they
[31:41] were talking about all of this and they
[31:42] were putting down the pastor because he
[31:44] wouldn't address it and everything was
[31:45] negative. And then the lady shows back
[31:47] up and she sits down and they shut up
[31:52] and she starts
[31:55] talking about the Lord
[31:57] and one of them let a little word about
[32:01] the pastor come out.
[32:04] And I forgot what it was, but it was
[32:06] something about um not taking care of
[32:09] things in church. And this lady, the two
[32:12] men were over here, and then there was a
[32:14] little aisle and and she was sitting
[32:15] here. And this lady leaned forward in
[32:18] her her chair. And I'm I'm sitting right
[32:21] here, and I'm just digging all this.
[32:25] I have my my earbuds in, but I was
[32:28] listening. And uh and she she puts her
[32:32] hands up
[32:34] and the one that said it, she says,
[32:37] "Come here
[32:39] and he leans over to the edge of his
[32:42] edge of his chair and she puts her hands
[32:44] up and she said, "Grab my hands."
[32:47] and and he put her his hands in her
[32:50] hands. And she said, "But the pastor
[32:54] loves the Lord Jesus and he preaches the
[32:58] Lord Jesus." And she said, "And I love
[33:02] the Lord Jesus." And she said, "That's
[33:05] all that matters." And then she they
[33:07] were they talked a little bit more. Shut
[33:09] them up. She gets up and she walks away.
[33:12] And man, they started again.
[33:16] And I almost I didn't do it and I say,
[33:18] "Lord, should I or should I not?" I
[33:21] almost said, "Friends, I'm talking about
[33:25] the golden rule in a couple days in my
[33:27] church. I'm a pastor, and I just wanted
[33:29] to say, you all are not doing it. I I
[33:32] didn't say it, but maybe I should have,
[33:35] but they were just talking and running
[33:38] these these people down." But when that
[33:40] lady would come in and she would sit
[33:43] there, it stopped because she brought a
[33:46] presence. And imagine if you were that
[33:49] deacon.
[33:50] The deacon wasn't there, but they were
[33:52] running down. Imagine if you were that
[33:54] person. The golden rule, Jesus said, "Do
[33:58] unto others as you would have others do
[34:00] to you." Imagine if you were that deacon
[34:03] and you knew that this lady stood up for
[34:07] you.
[34:09] That is what Jesus is talking about. Do
[34:12] unto others. Now, what do you think that
[34:15] if these two men there and how would
[34:17] they feel if there was two other men in
[34:19] another airport in another terminal
[34:21] running them down? They wouldn't like
[34:23] it.
[34:25] But this lady was actually doing it. she
[34:28] was doing. She was sticking up and she
[34:32] was using her voice
[34:34] to help to live this golden rule.
[34:38] Ephesians 4:29 says, "Let no corrupt
[34:40] word proceed out of your mouth.
[34:43] But what is good for necessary
[34:46] edification,
[34:50] that it may
[34:52] minister grace unto the hearers." The
[34:55] New King James says, "That it may impart
[34:57] grace to the hearers." Amplified version
[35:00] says, "Do not let unh wholesome
[35:04] words ever come out of your mouth, but
[35:07] only such speech as is good for building
[35:10] up others according to the need and the
[35:14] occasion, so that it will be a blessing
[35:16] to those who hear you speak."
[35:20] Same as this lady. She was a blessing.
[35:23] She she corrected that just with her
[35:25] positive attitude that is showing that
[35:28] she is doing what she would want done to
[35:31] her.
[35:34] We talk about other good people, you
[35:37] know, and and we what things
[35:41] would you want behind your back? All of
[35:44] us all of us have had people talk about
[35:47] us. What would you what would you want
[35:49] said behind your back?
[35:52] Would would you want somebody to stick
[35:54] up for you? Would you want somebody to
[35:56] talk good about you? Would you want
[35:58] somebody to lift you up?
[36:00] Or would you want somebody to point out
[36:03] all of your faults? Would you want
[36:05] somebody to repeat the gossip that's
[36:07] going on around you? The golden rule.
[36:11] Well, do to others. Do to others what
[36:14] you would want done to you.
[36:17] Be careful of your tongue. Be careful of
[36:18] what you say.
[36:20] That's just one part of this rule.
[36:22] That's how Jesus can say it all rests on
[36:24] this. If you could just do this one
[36:27] thing, all of the law and all of the
[36:30] prophets is right here. Couple years
[36:32] ago, I was driving home from work. I was
[36:36] on I 10. And I see this lady broken down
[36:40] and I see this van behind her and I
[36:42] thought, "Oh, well, I'd better stop to
[36:45] where I can maybe I could I could offer
[36:47] some assistance." And here is
[36:51] Katie Aaho's dad, Joe Robson,
[36:54] and he's got his van and he's got a
[36:56] whole van full of kids and and they're
[36:59] all there. And here is Joe.
[37:02] And Joe is jacking up the the car that's
[37:08] sitting in front of him. And there's
[37:09] this lady, this elderly lady. And here's
[37:11] Joe getting all greasy and dirty and
[37:13] changing the tire for this for this
[37:15] woman. He didn't know her. He just
[37:18] pulled over and stopped.
[37:20] And you think what what
[37:26] moved him to stop and help.
[37:30] Imagine if that was his wife there and
[37:33] she needed help. Imagine if it was Joe's
[37:36] mom, his elderly mother, sitting beside
[37:39] the road, not knowing what to do, not
[37:41] having anyone to call. This lady, it was
[37:43] so sweet because she didn't have anybody
[37:45] to help her. And here comes an angel
[37:48] from God stops and uh Nina, were you
[37:52] there?
[37:55] Nina probably. So So you've done this
[37:57] before.
[37:59] But an angel from the Lord is sent to
[38:02] help.
[38:04] And Job was doing to this person what he
[38:08] would want done to him.
[38:12] Jesus Jesus is preaching this golden
[38:14] rule and he's saying all of it all of it
[38:16] rests on this. All of the gossip that
[38:19] you do, all of the lies that you do, all
[38:20] the murder that you commit, all of the
[38:22] adultery that that you have, if you
[38:24] would just, you wouldn't want to cheat
[38:27] on your husband or your wife if you put
[38:29] that person first
[38:32] because you wouldn't want it done to
[38:33] you.
[38:34] It all rests on this. You can see why
[38:36] Jesus would say that.
[38:39] Jesus really lived the golden rule. He
[38:41] was the one who served. He lives his
[38:42] life every day, every moment for other
[38:44] people. Why do you think it meant so
[38:47] much to Jesus?
[38:49] Jesus is he he's coming to the end of
[38:51] his life when this lady comes in
[38:56] and anoints his head with oil
[39:00] and washes his feet with her tears and
[39:03] wipes them off with her hair. Why did
[39:06] that mean so much to him?
[39:09] It meant a lot because he was always
[39:11] serving others. And I'm sure it felt
[39:14] very good to have somebody do something
[39:16] for him. Jesus's life
[39:20] was when he was praying. He said, "This
[39:22] kind," when the epileptic boy came up,
[39:24] they said, "Why couldn't we cast him
[39:25] out?" He says, "This kind only goes out
[39:27] through prayer and fasting." Jesus was
[39:29] praying and Jesus was fasting not for
[39:31] himself, but for other people. He was
[39:34] living his life so he could help others.
[39:38] And then he lays it down. He says it's
[39:41] all about this.
[39:43] Jesus said in Matthew 23:1, "But he who
[39:47] is great among you shall be your
[39:48] servant." He who is great among you
[39:52] shall be your servant. So the ones are
[39:54] being served who are being served are
[39:56] not the great ones. The ones who are the
[40:00] ones who are great are the ones who are
[40:01] doing something. They're the ones out
[40:04] there serving people.
[40:06] You know, we they treat other people as
[40:09] they would want to be treated. And Jesus
[40:11] was the perfect example of that. Verse
[40:14] number 12. And whoever exalts himself
[40:15] will be humbled. And he who humbles
[40:18] himself will be exalted.
[40:22] When a negative word is spoken about
[40:24] somebody who's not there, they stand up
[40:26] for that person and they speak something
[40:28] positive because that's what they would
[40:30] want somebody to do for them.
[40:33] There's always negative to say,
[40:37] but are you going to be the one that
[40:38] says it?
[40:40] There's always positive to say, and are
[40:42] you going to be the one that says it?
[40:45] When you gossip about somebody or put
[40:46] someone down, really, you're exalting
[40:49] yourself over that person. But when you
[40:52] speak positive about someone, you are
[40:56] humbling yourself
[40:58] and you're lifting that other person up.
[41:01] Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane
[41:05] in Matthew chapter 26.
[41:09] Jesus was there. This is he was about to
[41:11] go to a cross
[41:13] and here he is and and he knows what's
[41:17] about to happen and he was heavy
[41:21] burdened
[41:22] and he just wanted somebody to pray with
[41:24] him. How many times had he prayed for
[41:27] others? How many times had had he been
[41:30] there for others? And he just wanted
[41:32] somebody to pray with him. He knew how
[41:34] it was. That's how he could make a
[41:36] stand. So many times and and him go
[41:40] because he knew what it was to want
[41:42] somebody just to be there for him.
[41:45] Peter, James, and John are there and
[41:46] he's he's like, "Can you just pray with
[41:49] me a little bit? Can you just watch a
[41:50] little bit? I'm going to go right over
[41:52] here. Just just pray." Hey. And he goes
[41:54] up there and they fall asleep and he
[41:55] comes back and he's like, "Please, can
[41:58] you just pray with me?" He knew how it
[42:01] was. He wanted help.
[42:03] And then he goes and
[42:06] goes there and it's the dead of night
[42:08] and gets on his knees and and he's so
[42:11] tormented that even the water and the
[42:13] blood separated him inside of his body
[42:16] and and the the sweat was coming down
[42:19] like blood off of his face. And then
[42:21] what did he say? He said, "Lord," he
[42:24] said, "father," he said, "let this cup
[42:27] pass from me."
[42:29] Jesus wanted a savior.
[42:33] He wanted somebody to save him, but
[42:34] there was no one that could save him.
[42:37] But do you see what he did? Then he
[42:41] I mean, it could have. He said, "But
[42:44] Lord, I want your will first."
[42:47] He wanted help.
[42:49] But he did for others what he wanted
[42:54] done to him. He saved us. And there he
[42:58] is. He goes to the cross by his own his
[43:02] own choice.
[43:05] He goes to the cross
[43:08] and he's up there
[43:10] and they walk by and they said, "Oh,
[43:13] look at him.
[43:15] He saved others,
[43:17] but himself he couldn't save. Why is
[43:21] that? It's because he he could have
[43:23] saved himself. He could have came down
[43:24] off the cross. They told him, "Why don't
[43:26] you come down off the cross?" He could
[43:27] have,
[43:29] but he would have been serving himself.
[43:32] It would have been putting himself
[43:33] first. But no, he put us first.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; He did the golden rule.
[43:40] He said, "I will stand for them." He
[43:44] said, 'Lord, I'll give my life for them.
[43:45] I don't want to do it. This is going to
[43:47] be hard, but I will go to the cross. And
[43:49] there here he is on the cross. And what
[43:50] does he do? What would you want to do if
[43:52] you were dying?
[43:56] He did what he wanted someone to do. He
[44:00] prayed for them. He said, "Lord, forgive
[44:02] them. They don't know what they're
[44:04] doing."
[44:06] And here is the grace of Jesus Christ on
[44:08] these people. They're spitting in his
[44:09] face and and and killing him, nailing
[44:11] him to the cross. And here is Jesus
[44:13] doing exactly what he would have wanted
[44:16] someone to do for him,
[44:20] giving his life for someone else,
[44:22] doing unto others
[44:26] as he would have wanted. Lord, let this
[44:29] cup pass from me.
[44:31] No one could save him.
[44:34] But he still wanted it. He still desired
[44:36] it.
[44:41] And later
[44:43] really, it didn't matter.
[44:47] It didn't matter how they they they
[44:52] treated Jesus. They spit in his face.
[44:53] They ripped his hair out. They stuck the
[44:55] the thorns in his head. They nailed him
[44:57] to the cross. That didn't matter to him.
[45:00] It does. And it doesn't matter, friends,
[45:01] to us.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; It does not matter one bit. If someone
[45:05] treats you bad, that doesn't mean that
[45:08] Jesus's word isn't true to do under
[45:10] others as you would have them do to you.
[45:13] Doesn't matter how you're treated. It
[45:15] matters that we follow him. And he said,
[45:18] "You treat others." Well, they they've
[45:20] done this to me and that they've done
[45:21] that to me. It doesn't matter. That's
[45:24] not his commandment. His commandment is
[45:26] how do you want to be treated?
[45:29] Then you treat others that way. And then
[45:33] here is Jesus. He goes to the cross. He
[45:36] he's he's crucified there. And and what
[45:38] does he say? He says, "Now you take up
[45:42] your cross and you follow me."
[45:47] What does that mean? You don't go to the
[45:49] cross for yourself.
[45:51] You go to the cross for someone else.
[45:54] He says, "Now you take up your cross and
[45:57] you follow me. You serve others as I
[45:59] have served them. You save others as I
[46:02] have saved them." There's only salvation
[46:04] through Jesus Christ. But we can help.
[46:06] We can point people to the Lord. We can
[46:08] preach the word to them. We can stand on
[46:10] his promises and point people to a a
[46:13] risen savior. And it's hard.
[46:18] And they spit in your face. They they
[46:20] they talk about you. They they run you
[46:22] down. They might discriminate against
[46:24] you at work or wherever it might be. But
[46:26] you can still take up your cross and
[46:28] follow Jesus. for
[46:31] those people that hate you.
[46:36] Do unto others
[46:38] as you would have others do unto you.
[46:44] sad thing
[46:46] is that when Jesus says therefore in
[46:48] Matthew chapter 7, he says all of these
[46:53] beautiful things in the sermon on the
[46:54] mount and he says therefore
[46:58] people might say well you know it's just
[47:00] it's too simple.
[47:03] It's not it's not the deep things. It's
[47:07] not the mysteries. We want the we want
[47:09] the mysteries. A lot of times the
[47:10] mysteries aren't even in the Bible.
[47:11] That's why they're so intriguing. This
[47:14] is a very, very simple thing that Jesus
[47:17] is talking about. But he says all the
[47:19] Bible, all the prophets, they rest on
[47:22] this this one thing. You might say,
[47:24] "Well, that's just not important to me.
[47:28] It's just too simple."
[47:33] Back to Matthew 7.
[47:37] Verse number 12,
[47:39] back to this golden rule. Therefore, all
[47:42] things whatsoever you would that men
[47:44] should do to you, do ye even so to them,
[47:48] for this is the law and the prophets.
[47:53] Another translation says, "So then, in
[47:55] everything, treat others the same way
[47:58] you would want them to treat you, for
[48:00] this is the essence of the law
[48:03] and the writings of the prophets.
[48:07] The golden rule really shouldn't
[48:09] shouldn't be applied like I want someone
[48:11] to do that to me so I'm or I wouldn't
[48:14] want someone to do that to me so I'm not
[48:16] going to do it to them. Instead say you
[48:19] know it would really help me if someone
[48:21] would stick up for me behind my back
[48:24] or pray for me or take me to church
[48:26] sometime
[48:28] or call me and tell me how much I mean
[48:31] to them. You know it would really help
[48:32] me if somebody did that.
[48:36] and then you do it.
[48:39] You know, people you're always thinking,
[48:41] well,
[48:43] don't expect
[48:46] someone to do something for you that
[48:50] you're not willing to do to them. Do for
[48:51] them.
[48:55] Nobody cares about me. How many people
[48:57] How many people called to see how I'm
[48:58] doing? Well, how many people have you
[49:00] called today?
[49:02] Because you have a burden for them. I
[49:04] wish somebody would stick up for me. How
[49:06] many people have you stuck up for behind
[49:07] their backs?
[49:09] You know, send out a prayer request and
[49:11] we see it and we, you know, give a
[49:13] little heart, you know, a little praying
[49:14] hands. But how many people really prayed
[49:16] over the requests that we've seen go out
[49:20] and you say, you might just say, I just
[49:22] need some help. I just I just need
[49:24] something. How many times have you
[49:26] helped other people?
[49:28] I'm not saying that we do this for for a
[49:31] reciprocal thing.
[49:34] But it is important. Therefore, all
[49:36] things whatsoever you would that men
[49:38] should do to you, even so do to them.
[49:39] For this is the law and the prophets. So
[49:42] the B whole Bible hangs on this
[49:46] on these these simple things that Jesus
[49:48] said, which is basically love the Lord
[49:51] God with all of your heart and love each
[49:53] other with the same love that you have
[49:55] for God and do unto others as you would
[49:58] have do unto them or that you would have
[50:00] them do to you. And you say, "But
[50:03] brother Daniel," and I know sometimes
[50:05] I'll get criticized. Well, we want you
[50:07] to preach this or we want you to do
[50:09] that. Why do you always go back to this
[50:13] type of thing? It seems so simple.
[50:17] Listen to me. If I was in the
[50:19] congregation this morning and I was
[50:22] listening to the pastor preach, I would
[50:26] want someone who would bring out the
[50:29] word and bring correction to me and to
[50:32] point me to the words of Jesus Christ
[50:35] and to show me maybe I'm wrong.
[50:38] Maybe I'm not believing right. That's
[50:41] the pastor that I would want. I would
[50:43] want that somebody that loves me and
[50:44] that cares for me. And that is a burden
[50:47] for this. That is a burden for me. That
[50:50] has a burden for my children to see them
[50:52] grow up in the in the image of Jesus
[50:55] Christ. That's what I would want if I'm
[50:57] in the congregation. And friends, that's
[50:59] what I'm trying to do
[51:03] &gt;&gt; is point to this word.
[51:06] And you say, "Well, why is this golden
[51:09] rule so important?"
[51:11] You know, if it sounds good and we see
[51:14] that Jesus said, "Oh, well, all the law
[51:16] and all the prophets and and everything
[51:19] hinges on this."
[51:23] But why is it so important? What are the
[51:27] consequences?
[51:29] Think about this. What are the
[51:31] consequences if we don't follow the
[51:34] golden rule?
[51:36] Read the next verse.
[51:39] Verse
[51:41] number 13.
[51:44] Enter ye in at the straight gate. Most
[51:47] translations say narrow gate or small
[51:49] gate. For wide is the gate and broad is
[51:52] the way that leads to destruction and
[51:54] many there be which go in there. Because
[51:58] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[52:00] way which leadth unto life and few there
[52:03] will be that find it. Jesus is speaking
[52:06] about the golden rule right here.
[52:09] This is a sermon on the mount.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Do we do we grasp how
[52:15] important these words from the Lord
[52:17] Jesus are?
[52:19] You know, you want to hear mysteries and
[52:21] and and you want to hear all these
[52:22] things, but speaking of of treating
[52:25] others, how you would want to be treated
[52:28] is the essence of it all. Verse number
[52:32] 13, New Living Translation says this.
[52:34] Listen to this. You can enter the God's
[52:37] kingdom only through the narrow gate.
[52:40] The highway to hell is broad
[52:44] &gt;&gt; and its gate is wide for the many who
[52:47] choose that way. But the gateway to life
[52:49] is very narrow and the road is difficult
[52:52] and only a few ever find it. Jesus often
[52:56] mentions hell. It's not mentioned very
[52:59] much in modern day churches.
[53:02] Some say that he talked more, some
[53:04] scholars say that he actually mentions
[53:05] hell more than he mentions heaven.
[53:08] He wasn't afraid to mention it. And then
[53:11] a few verses later, he says this verse
[53:14] number 20.
[53:16] Wherefore, he's talking about false
[53:17] prophets, which we'll get into next week
[53:19] if the Lord's willing. Wherefore by
[53:21] their fruits you shall know them. Not
[53:22] everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,
[53:24] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven,
[53:26] but he that doeth the will of my father
[53:28] which is in heaven.
[53:30] We just learned what the will of the
[53:32] father is. And he says, "You're not
[53:34] going to go unless you do that. Many
[53:37] will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,
[53:39] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[53:42] in thy name cast out devils and in thy
[53:44] name done many wonderful works?" And
[53:46] then I will profess unto them, I never
[53:48] knew you. Depart from me, you that work
[53:51] iniquity.
[53:53] Therefore, whosoever heareth these
[53:55] sayings of mine
[53:57] and doeth them, I will liken him unto a
[54:01] wise man which built his house upon a
[54:04] rock.
[54:06] How important.
[54:09] He says, "Therefore," and he gives us
[54:12] the golden rule. And then he says in the
[54:15] very next verse, listen, this is a
[54:18] narrow path, but wide is the road to
[54:23] hell.
[54:29] Luke,
[54:32] I don't have time to read it, but
[54:35] everyone
[54:36] wants mysteries. I remember when I was
[54:38] in Jeffersonville, we found like 10 new
[54:40] sermons.
[54:43] There's 1,200 of them
[54:45] and everybody wanted these 10
[54:48] because they were just found. They were
[54:49] new. I was like kind of like, have you
[54:52] listened to all 1,200? Do you want
[54:53] these? You want these 10?
[54:56] Everybody wants something new. Everybody
[54:58] wants a mystery. Everybody wants
[54:59] something that's maybe not written in
[55:01] the Bible. It's mysterious. Some the the
[55:03] things that are written that Jesus said,
[55:06] they may seem simple, but they're hard
[55:07] to put into practice. He set this bar
[55:10] very, very high. And he says in Luke, I
[55:13] said, I talked about last week how this
[55:15] this woman came before the unjust judge
[55:17] and she kept knocking at his door and
[55:19] she kept saying,"Lord, help me or judge,
[55:21] help me. Help me. I need to be avenged
[55:22] of my adversary." And then finally this
[55:24] judge got tired of it. And he says,
[55:26] "Give her what she wants." And then the
[55:28] Lord Jesus says, "Now that's how you
[55:30] should pray, where you knock all the
[55:32] time. Lord, I need this. I need it." And
[55:34] you continue to knock and he's not a
[55:36] just judge. He loves us. But then God
[55:39] will hear your prayers and answer. And
[55:42] Jesus says this. Now you want to hear a
[55:44] mystery.
[55:45] Here's one of the greatest ones in the
[55:47] Bible.
[55:50] Unjust judge saying. He says, "I will
[55:53] tell you Jesus talking about him. He
[55:54] says that he will avenge them speedily."
[55:57] Listen to this. Luke 18:8. Nevertheless,
[56:02] when the son of man cometh,
[56:05] shall he find faith on earth.
[56:09] When Jesus returns,
[56:13] is he going to find people who are
[56:15] actually practicing what he taught? The
[56:18] musicians can come and we'll close.
[56:21] Will he find people who are not running
[56:24] each other down? Will he find people who
[56:26] are supporting each other? Will he find
[56:29] people who are saying positive things
[56:31] about each other like this lady was in
[56:33] the airport?
[56:35] Will he find people who are standing up
[56:37] for each other?
[56:40] Will he find people who are doing unto
[56:42] others as they would have others do to
[56:46] them?
[56:51] I'm not putting too much emphasis,
[56:53] friends, on these things. Jesus
[56:56] basically said we're in danger of hell
[56:58] if we don't do it. being the pastor of
[57:01] the church and trying to present the
[57:02] word in the correct way.
[57:06] I would want somebody to tell me,
[57:09] hey, here is what is important. Here is
[57:13] the priority in your life. Here is what
[57:16] it's all about.
[57:20] You say, "Well, you know, you're saying
[57:22] that all the mysteries and all the
[57:24] prophecies and all the doctrines and and
[57:26] all of these things, you know, the can
[57:29] be summed up with love the Lord your God
[57:32] with all of your heart, mind, and soul,
[57:34] and love your neighbor as yourself. Love
[57:37] with that same love and and then do unto
[57:39] others as you would have others do unto
[57:41] you." Are you saying, Brother Daniel,
[57:43] are you saying that it's that simple?
[57:46] No, I'm not saying it's that simple.
[57:48] Jesus is saying it's that simple. I'm
[57:52] just reading what he said.
[58:03] You know, there's people here
[58:06] in every churches, every church that
[58:08] they may resent the way that they were
[58:11] raised. They may resent the way that
[58:12] they grew up or they may resent how the
[58:14] church treated them. and they come back.
[58:17] And then there's others
[58:19] who want the same thing that they grew
[58:21] up with. They want to go back to those
[58:23] things. Neither of them,
[58:26] I'm not saying anything good or bad
[58:28] about either of them, but here is
[58:29] wisdom.
[58:31] So in everything,
[58:34] do to others what you would have them do
[58:37] to you. For this sums up the law and the
[58:41] prophets. Remember the mark. It's the
[58:44] truth. The words of our Lord Jesus, the
[58:48] consequences are great. The reward is
[58:51] really is beyond measure.
[58:54] Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[59:05] With our heads bowed, friends,
[59:08] I ask that each person here
[59:12] would evaluate their life.
[59:14] As the Apostle Paul said, "Let a man
[59:16] examine himself.
[59:20] Examine yourself."
[59:23] And Lord, am I
[59:25] putting the right things right? Am I
[59:28] concentrating on what you concentrated
[59:31] on?
[59:34] Or has my mind and my religion gone in a
[59:37] different direction?
[59:41] The Lord Jesus's words were very simple.
[59:47] Think on these things, brothers and
[59:49] sisters.
[59:53] Lord,
[59:55] we thank you,
[59:58] Father, for the simplicity of your word
[1:00:03] and Lord, the the wisdom that just is
[1:00:06] overflowing
[1:00:08] out of these words of Jesus and and how,
[1:00:11] Lord, he did it.
[1:00:16] He actually accomplished it.
[1:00:20] Now father
[1:00:24] was commanded
[1:00:26] by our lord to take up our cross and
[1:00:28] follow
[1:00:30] him.
[1:00:31] Lord help us
[1:00:34] to take up this cross.
[1:00:38] Lord bear it before others.
[1:00:41] Present the gospel in the way that it
[1:00:43] should be presented.
[1:00:45] Lord stand for each other and love one
[1:00:47] another.
[1:00:49] love you, Father, with all of our heart,
[1:00:51] mind, and soul.
[1:00:55] Love one another.
[1:00:58] And Lord, to really put this rule in
[1:01:00] practice.
[1:01:04] Help us, Father, we pray.
[1:01:07] We love you.
[1:01:10] We thank you
[1:01:12] in Jesus name.
[1:01:14] Amen. Amen. Let's all stand as we sing.
[1:01:28] We bow our hearts.
[1:01:32] We bend our knees.
[1:01:36] Oh spirit, come make us home.
[1:01:45] We turn our eyes
[1:01:49] from evil things,
[1:01:53] oh Lord. We cast our Can we sing that
[1:01:57] again?
[1:02:02] We bow our hearts.
[1:02:06] We bend our knees.
[1:02:10] Oh spirit come make us humble.
[1:02:18] We turn our eyes
[1:02:23] from evil things.
[1:02:27] Oh Lord we cast down our idols.
[1:02:33] Give us clean hands.
[1:02:37] Give us pure hearts.
[1:02:42] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:02:49] Give us clean hands.
[1:02:53] Give us pure hearts.
[1:02:58] Let us not lift our souls to run. We bow
[1:03:04] our hearts.
[1:03:08] We bow our hearts.
[1:03:12] We bend our knees.
[1:03:16] Oh spirit, come make us humble.
[1:03:24] We turn our eyes
[1:03:28] from evil things.
[1:03:32] Oh Lord, we cast down our idols.
[1:03:37] Give us clean hands.
[1:03:41] Give us pure hearts.
[1:03:46] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:03:53] Give us clean hands.
[1:03:57] Give us pure hearts.
[1:04:01] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:04:08] Oh God, let us be a generation
[1:04:13] that seeks
[1:04:16] seeks your face.
[1:04:19] Oh God of Jacob,
[1:04:24] oh God, let us be a generation
[1:04:28] that seeks,
[1:04:31] who seeks your face.
[1:04:34] Oh God of Jacob,
[1:04:42] give us clean hands.
[1:04:46] Give us pure hearts.
[1:04:50] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:04:58] Give us clean hands.
[1:05:02] Give us pure hearts.
[1:05:07] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:16] Amen.
[1:05:18] I uh
[1:05:22] Jesus very much set the bar very high
[1:05:27] and I thank God he did and he told us he
[1:05:31] warned us
[1:05:34] here are the consequences
[1:05:38] of not doing these things. So friends,
[1:05:40] please take this word seriously.
[1:05:45] Put these things into action.
[1:05:48] I um I think about the uh I mentioned
[1:05:51] last week or last month that uh Steven
[1:05:54] Young in South Africa, he saw this lady
[1:05:58] there at the school
[1:06:01] and uh the school where they were um
[1:06:05] going to have their um revival
[1:06:08] at the tent meeting and he saw that she
[1:06:12] needed help.
[1:06:14] Poor lady.
[1:06:16] Stephen,
[1:06:18] he is every every day he's dependent on
[1:06:22] the Lord right now with his family and
[1:06:24] and getting this church started and he's
[1:06:26] really stepping out by faith. And he
[1:06:29] walked up to up there and he paid
[1:06:33] with what money that he had by faith. He
[1:06:35] paid that lady's tuition for her her
[1:06:39] child.
[1:06:41] And
[1:06:43] then uh
[1:06:46] this past week he was able to pay for
[1:06:48] the whole year for a child.
[1:06:52] And I think I sure would have wanted
[1:06:55] somebody to do that for me for my
[1:06:57] children if I would have needed it. Boy,
[1:06:59] it would have just Can you imagine just
[1:07:03] never having a thought of God? Never
[1:07:05] having a thought that he can provide.
[1:07:07] And then this angel comes out of nowhere
[1:07:12] and provides what you need.
[1:07:15] Can you imagine doing to others as you
[1:07:19] would have them do to you? And now I I
[1:07:22] think it's it's really neat, really
[1:07:25] really cool. Our offering today for
[1:07:28] South Africa is $777.
[1:07:41] Yeah, I don't I don't I don't get weird,
[1:07:44] you know, with the with the numbers and
[1:07:45] stuff, but boy, I'm glad it wasn't 666
[1:07:50] 77.
[1:07:53] That's a good number. Brother Steven, we
[1:07:56] love you. We love your family. We love
[1:07:58] the Saints there in Durban. And uh we're
[1:08:02] honored that we can do unto you like we
[1:08:06] would want someone to do unto us. God
[1:08:09] bless you friends. No service tonight. I
[1:08:11] believe on Wednesday, if I'm not
[1:08:13] mistaken, we have our Wednesday night
[1:08:15] fireside Bible study, which I'm looking
[1:08:17] forward to. I like doing it. And um then
[1:08:21] next week, next Sunday, um I know this
[1:08:25] one was a was a pretty
[1:08:28] strong one, but next Sunday, we're going
[1:08:30] to be talking about false prophets
[1:08:33] and how we recognize a false prophet.
[1:08:36] Jesus is next. It's next year on the
[1:08:38] list, and we're getting pretty close to
[1:08:40] wrapping up this sermon on the mount.
[1:08:43] And it's
[1:08:45] it's taken me like three or four months.
[1:08:47] Um, but man, these these words in red, I
[1:08:53] know everything from cover to cover is
[1:08:55] the word of God, but those words in red,
[1:08:58] wow, they really they really get to us.
[1:09:02] God bless you, friends. I pray that the
[1:09:05] Lord will be with you. And remember,
[1:09:07] start thinking all the time,
[1:09:10] would someone what would someone want me
[1:09:14] to do in this situation? And then do it
[1:09:18] that way. God bless you. You're
[1:09:19] dismissed.
