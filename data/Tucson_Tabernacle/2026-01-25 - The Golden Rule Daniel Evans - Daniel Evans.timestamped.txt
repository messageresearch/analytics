[2:50] We'll start with verse one. Who am I
[2:52] that the highest king would welcome me?
[2:55] What a thought to think. Creator of the
[2:58] heavens and earth,
[3:00] the whole universe created each one of
[3:02] us, but not only do all that, but
[3:05] welcome us to be his sons and daughters
[3:08] to come live with him in his kingdom.
[3:10] Can you believe it? Amen.
[3:16] Who am I that the highest king would
[3:21] welcome
[3:23] me?
[3:26] I was lost but he brought me. Oh his
[3:31] love for me.
[3:36] Oh his love for me.
[3:41] who the sun sets free.
[3:46] Oh, it's free
[3:49] indeed.
[3:52] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am
[4:03] free at last. He has ransom me. His
[4:07] grace runs deep.
[4:13] While I was a sin to slave, Jesus died
[4:18] for me.
[4:21] Yes, he died for me.
[4:26] Who the sun sets free.
[4:31] Oh, is free indeed.
[4:36] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am.
[4:46] In my father's
[4:49] house,
[4:51] there's a place for me.
[4:55] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am. Sing that
[5:02] again. Who the son?
[5:05] who the sun sets free.
[5:10] Oh, is free indeed.
[5:14] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am.
[5:23] Oh, in my father's
[5:27] house
[5:28] there's a place for me.
[5:33] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am. I am
[5:41] chosen.
[5:43] I am chosen.
[5:45] Not forsaken.
[5:48] I am who you say I am.
[5:53] You are for me, not against me.
[5:58] I am who you say I am.
[6:02] I am chosen,
[6:05] not forsaken.
[6:08] I am who you say I am.
[6:12] You are for me, not against me.
[6:17] I am who you say I am.
[6:22] I am who you say I am.
[6:28] who the sun sets free.
[6:33] Oh, is free indeed.
[6:38] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am. Would you
[6:45] all stand with me this morning? In my
[6:48] father's
[6:51] house,
[6:53] there's a place for me.
[6:58] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am.
[7:07] Amen. Who is a child of God this
[7:10] morning? Raise your hand up there high
[7:12] because it's the greatest honor that you
[7:14] could have. Let's bow our heads. Father,
[7:16] we're grateful Lord that we can raise
[7:19] our hands and say that I am a child of
[7:21] God.
[7:23] Lord, we are your sons and your
[7:25] daughters. And we pray Lord that we
[7:27] could live a life that would be pleasing
[7:29] to you and that Lord that you would join
[7:33] us
[7:34] &gt;&gt; in this service. Bless us Lord with your
[7:37] presence. We pray we love you in Jesus
[7:40] name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. God
[7:44] bless you.
[7:53] God bless you all. Welcome. I I didn't
[7:55] get a list of visitors, but I heard
[7:57] brother Arie recognize a few. Welcome.
[7:59] We We appreciate you coming. God bless
[8:02] Nina back there. Is it Zeke? Welcome.
[8:05] God bless you. It's good to have you in
[8:06] service. And any other visitors we have.
[8:10] Um we're grateful. Uh we took up the
[8:13] offering this morning for uh the work
[8:16] that we are helping out with in Durban,
[8:19] South Africa. I mentioned it a few times
[8:22] and I'll mention it again. We'll see uh
[8:24] as long as the Lord leads in this
[8:26] direction, we'll continue uh supporting
[8:30] brother Steven Young and the work that
[8:32] he has there. And uh I am always willing
[8:36] to change as the Lord changes direction.
[8:38] But things are have been going very very
[8:40] well. Brother Steven sent me a letter
[8:43] yesterday and I asked him to could you
[8:46] give us a report that I could read to
[8:48] the church and he sent me this
[8:52] report from uh brother Steven Young in
[8:54] South Africa. He said, "Brother Daniel
[8:56] and the saints of Tucson Tabernacle,
[8:58] greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus.
[9:00] I have so much good news to share with
[9:03] you all. Our little church has been
[9:06] growing steadily and even our midweek
[9:08] service was full of visitors. Now, if
[9:11] you remember right, this is um this st
[9:14] this church just started up a few months
[9:17] ago. So, this is a brand new church
[9:20] here, grassroots.
[9:21] Our little church has been growing
[9:23] steadily and even our midweek service
[9:24] was full of visitors. Though we were
[9:27] we're grateful for good attendance, our
[9:29] focus and emphasis is not on numbers,
[9:32] but rather in a genuine spiritual
[9:34] transformation in the lives of the
[9:36] people that we serve. In this regard,
[9:40] I've been greatly encouraged by a recent
[9:42] interaction we had with we had with a
[9:45] new believer, brother Kubin Governor,
[9:48] who on Sunday had his baby girl
[9:50] dedicated to the Lord. We blessed her
[9:53] according to Markap 10 verse 13- 16.
[9:56] Could you put the Yeah, there's the
[9:57] picture of a family that they had the
[9:59] little baby dedicated. Uh new people in
[10:02] the church there in South Africa. Um
[10:05] there's there's a large Indian uh from
[10:08] India population there that have their
[10:10] roots from India. There are the um the
[10:13] native Africans. There are the Dutch
[10:16] whites that are there. So it's a melting
[10:18] pot of a lot of different um races
[10:21] there.
[10:22] He says, "A few days later, thank you."
[10:24] "A few days later, he asked me to to pay
[10:28] him a visit at his work." This is uh
[10:30] Brother Kubin, "Pay him a visit at his
[10:32] work." And uh there he confessed that
[10:36] he's had a problem with with smoking
[10:38] weed, smoking marijuana since the COVID
[10:41] lockdown period, and has tried quitting,
[10:44] but was finding it challenging.
[10:46] We shared a portion of scripture with
[10:48] him in James chapter 5 and verse 16. And
[10:52] I told him that he had done right the
[10:55] right thing by speaking to us. Without
[10:57] telling him of his problem, we may never
[11:00] without him telling us of his problem,
[11:02] we may never have known what he was
[11:04] struggling with. We prayed the prayer of
[11:06] faith and we know that God will deliver
[11:09] him even as he has delivered us from the
[11:12] same spirits of bondage and bad habits.
[11:15] We further encouraged him to feed on the
[11:17] word of God wherever he feels tempted
[11:19] and to speak the word in faith because
[11:22] that's what Jesus demonstrated in the
[11:24] hour of his temptation.
[11:27] He quoted, "It is written, man shall not
[11:30] live by bread alone, but by every word
[11:32] that proceeds out of the mouth of God."
[11:35] &gt;&gt; My wife and I have both resumed our
[11:37] voluntary work with two orphanages in
[11:39] our vicinity. She spends a few hours
[11:42] with the children of Ethel Ethlbert
[11:44] Children's Home, a Methodistr run
[11:46] institution where she's been reading to
[11:48] the little ones and teaching them about
[11:50] the word of about God's word. And I have
[11:52] been called upon to assist some troubled
[11:54] youth at the Malver's Children's Home
[11:58] after we reunited one of the children
[12:01] residing there with his family who are
[12:04] homeless and living on the streets at
[12:06] the Durban Beachfront. It's quite a
[12:09] testimony how we even got involved with
[12:12] them in the first place. But when the
[12:14] social worker learned about our
[12:16] involvement, he somehow found my number
[12:18] and asked me to work with their young
[12:20] people on a regular basis. I get to see
[12:24] them for an hour every Friday. We even
[12:28] managed to receive a donation of
[12:29] chocolates. And for all the youth
[12:32] residing at for all the youth residing
[12:33] at the home and my family and I were
[12:36] able to deliver it just before
[12:38] Christmas. We thank God for all the
[12:40] smiles on their little faces. However,
[12:43] our heart's desire is for God to
[12:45] transform their lives and for them to
[12:48] make the most important choice, the
[12:50] choice to follow Christ. Please keep
[12:53] these young people in your prayers. I
[12:55] also received a report from brother
[12:58] Ramlan who from whom God has opened a
[13:01] door to the prison ministries. He is
[13:04] certainly the right man for the job and
[13:06] has a heart for the many broken lives
[13:09] trapped behind bars. He reported three
[13:12] baptisms over the past few weeks.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:23] He reported three baptisms over the past
[13:26] few weeks, which is a major breakthrough
[13:28] in the section of prison that he
[13:29] ministers at. Furthermore, our Lur
[13:32] church has just received an invitation
[13:34] to join a very wellestablished and
[13:36] missionary oriented church for the
[13:38] service tomorrow morning. The
[13:40] 88-year-old pastor, also wellrespected
[13:44] evangelist, had closed his Sunday
[13:46] evening service and supported our tent
[13:48] campaign in December. And he now desires
[13:52] for us to work together on a few
[13:54] outreach campaigns he has planned in the
[13:56] months ahead months ahead. We pray that
[13:59] the Lord will guide us and that we'll be
[14:01] effective laborers in his field. My
[14:03] family and I and the believers in Durban
[14:06] are grateful for all your love, prayers,
[14:09] and support for our ministry. And he
[14:12] says, and he he has a PS here. He says,
[14:15] Cynth, Sister Cynthia Zulu, another new
[14:18] believer, is also grateful for the
[14:20] financial assistance that she received
[14:23] from Tucson Tabernacle and from my
[14:25] brother, if you remember right, last
[14:27] month. her daughter's school fees were
[14:30] paid in full for 2026
[14:33] and as a result she was able to purchase
[14:35] some new clothes and good food for for
[14:38] her family. We are so thankful to the
[14:41] Lord for using you all to bless her
[14:44] family and ours. May God bless you all,
[14:47] brother Stephen and the Saints in
[14:48] Durban, South Africa. Amen.
[14:58] I do believe it's a worthy cause and and
[15:00] uh he's a he's a young he's a brother
[15:04] that is filled with the spirit and he
[15:07] has a burden for lost souls and I know
[15:09] that many of us share that same burden.
[15:12] We're going to get into the golden rule
[15:14] this morning. And uh last week we talked
[15:17] about how praying and how God gives the
[15:20] best gifts and how Jesus instructed us
[15:24] to ask and to seek and to knock and to
[15:27] ask and to keep asking. If we have a
[15:29] need then to ask God and keep putting it
[15:31] before him to seek and then to keep
[15:34] seeking and we seek. When we seek we are
[15:38] seeking for God's will in these things,
[15:40] not our own will. This is the hard part.
[15:43] We are going before the Lord and we're
[15:45] we're laying our own desires aside. And
[15:48] we are truly saying,"Lord, I want your
[15:52] will in this this desire that I have,
[15:56] Lord, or this need that I have. Lord, I
[15:58] want your will. If you want me to suffer
[16:00] a little longer, I'll suffer, Lord. If
[16:03] because I know you have a purpose. If if
[16:06] you want to heal me or if you want to
[16:08] for me to to to leave and to go
[16:10] somewhere else, Lord, I just want your
[16:12] will. Lord, help me. That is the seeking
[16:15] part. Remember, God doesn't bow to our
[16:17] will.
[16:19] We may get what we want against his will
[16:22] because of our own desires and not
[16:24] seeking the Lord, but it never works out
[16:27] well. So, we we seek and we keep seeking
[16:31] and then once we have found the will of
[16:32] God, then we go before him in the name
[16:35] of Jesus Christ and we knock.
[16:38] And that's where our faith comes in.
[16:40] When you know that you have the mind of
[16:42] Christ, when you know what the will of
[16:44] God is for your life, then you can go
[16:46] before the Lord in confidence and with
[16:48] faith and know that you will receive
[16:52] what you are asking for in God's time.
[16:55] And earlier in Matthew 7, we learn from
[16:58] our Lord Jesus in the sermon on the
[17:00] mount. He said, "We are not to judge
[17:02] others. And now that you realize that
[17:06] you have a log in your eye,
[17:10] make sure to get that out of your eye
[17:11] before you're working on the speck
[17:13] that's in somebody else's eye.
[17:15] Judge not that you be not judged is what
[17:18] he told us. Then then in Matthew chapter
[17:20] 6, now we see that our life shouldn't be
[17:23] focused on money or on worldly
[17:25] possessions. And now that that you you
[17:28] you shouldn't be praying to get in front
[17:30] of the people and draw attention to
[17:32] yourself, but you should be praying that
[17:34] in in secret and and going before the
[17:37] Lord for other people.
[17:40] And we were given in Matthew chapter 6,
[17:43] we were given an example
[17:46] of a prayer. We call it the Lord's
[17:48] prayer. Our Father who art in heaven,
[17:50] hallowed be thy name. And then
[17:55] Jesus taught us to prever prefer others
[17:57] over ourselves and to give to the needy
[18:00] and to store up our treasures in heaven.
[18:02] This is all in this masterpiece called
[18:04] the sermon on the mount. Matthew chapter
[18:06] 5 6 and 7. Then when we get when we
[18:08] started in Matthew 5, Jesus taught that
[18:11] we should love our enemies just like you
[18:14] love your friends
[18:16] and that you can commit murder by just
[18:18] hating someone and just slandering
[18:21] someone. that you can commit adultery by
[18:24] just desiring someone that's not your
[18:26] spouse. He's working on the heart. He's
[18:29] working on the inner man because he
[18:33] knows that that inner man will be
[18:34] manifested outwardly.
[18:37] He taught that we should be honest in
[18:39] our everyday lives. So honest that we
[18:41] should never have to say I promise I I
[18:44] swear that this is the truth. No, you
[18:46] should be have such respect because of
[18:48] the honesty that you always speak that
[18:51] you just say the word and people know
[18:53] that this brother or this sister is
[18:56] telling the truth.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; And he started his sermon with the
[18:59] biatitudes, the blessings, the Christian
[19:02] progression. Blessed are the poor in
[19:05] spirit. They understand that there is
[19:08] something lacking in their life. I had
[19:10] this conversation with a young man about
[19:14] about this um when I was in
[19:16] Jeffersonville a couple days ago and
[19:18] it's just so full of wisdom
[19:22] and he he he understood he he never
[19:24] really understood what is the whole
[19:26] purpose of Jesus and Christianity and
[19:29] you bring him right back to this this
[19:32] just the very start of the sermon on the
[19:33] mount and then it just makes things make
[19:36] sense.
[19:38] Blessed are those who mourn. They feel
[19:40] bad for their sins and they regret what
[19:42] they've done.
[19:44] For they shall be comforted. Blessed are
[19:46] the meek. They humble themselves before
[19:48] the Lord and they admit that they need a
[19:50] change in their life. For they shall
[19:53] inherit the earth. Blessed are those who
[19:54] hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[19:56] Now that they've changed, now that
[19:58] there's desires have changed in their
[20:00] life, they they're going to make those
[20:03] changes. They're hungering and thirsting
[20:04] after righteousness.
[20:06] Blessed are the pure in heart. Now they
[20:09] receive a new heart. Once you become a
[20:11] Christian, you've given your heart to
[20:12] the Lord. There's a change that takes
[20:14] place in you. That old stony heart is
[20:16] gone. And now the desire in your heart
[20:19] is to serve God. And that replaces the
[20:22] the desire for sin that you used to
[20:24] have. The Christian progression is
[20:26] getting higher as Jesus is going through
[20:28] the biatitudes. And he says he says,
[20:31] "Blessed are the peacemakers. Now
[20:32] they're on the battlefield for the Lord.
[20:35] Instead of fighting and causing discord
[20:37] and causing problems, they desire peace
[20:40] and harmony in the body of Christ.
[20:43] Blessed are those, then we come to this
[20:45] last one. Blessed are those who are
[20:48] persecuted for righteousness sake, for
[20:50] theirs is the kingdom of heaven. And
[20:52] then when we finally get there, when we
[20:56] finally give our hearts to the Lord,
[21:00] when we finally make that commitment,
[21:02] when when the when the Lord fills us
[21:04] with his spirit, then we can rest
[21:07] assured that we will be persecuted for
[21:10] what we believe. It's part of it.
[21:14] Now, we understand the biatitudes. We
[21:15] understand the Christian progression.
[21:17] And
[21:19] really Jesus said in in Matthew chapter
[21:22] 5, he also said he said, ' Don't
[21:24] misunderstand why I have come. I didn't
[21:26] come to abolish the law of Moses and the
[21:28] or the writings of the prophets. These
[21:30] this Old Testament, this Bible that was
[21:32] in place at that time was very
[21:34] important. He said, I didn't come to do
[21:36] away with any of it. He said, I came to
[21:38] accomplish its purpose. I came to
[21:40] fulfill
[21:42] this law and the prophets. And now we
[21:46] get to that point. We've gone through
[21:49] all the biatitudes and we've gone
[21:50] through all the teachings on adultery
[21:52] and marriage and and and and lying and
[21:54] all of these different things and and we
[21:56] get to this point where Jesus now is
[22:00] going to bring us to the next level. And
[22:03] he says this word,
[22:06] he says, "Therefore."
[22:10] So all that I just summarized, all of
[22:12] the teaching in this first sermon that
[22:16] Jesus preached, he goes through all of
[22:17] these things and he says, "Therefore,
[22:22] or we might say, so
[22:26] why all of these things?"
[22:30] He's going to paint now. He's been very
[22:31] specific before. Now he's just going to
[22:33] paint with a broad brush in Matthew
[22:35] chapter 7.
[22:38] before. He's been very specific, but
[22:39] watch him sum it up right now. He says,
[22:42] "Therefore," Matthew chapter 7:12,
[22:47] and this is a golden scripture,
[22:50] and it's very, very important.
[22:53] Matthew chapter 7 verse 12 says this
[22:57] therefore remember he brought all the
[22:59] way up to there up to here
[23:02] and he says now
[23:04] this is why
[23:06] all things
[23:08] whatsoever you would that men should do
[23:11] to you do even so to them for this is
[23:17] the law and the prophets
[23:20] he summed it up right
[23:23] Jesus often, and you'll see as you read
[23:25] through this sermon on the mount and you
[23:27] get really familiar with it, you'll see
[23:29] later on Jesus in Matthew and and in
[23:31] Luke and and the apostles do the same
[23:34] thing. You'll see that they they go back
[23:36] to this sermon on the mount. And Jesus
[23:39] does this. He does this often in Matthew
[23:41] chapter 22. Long after he preached this
[23:44] sermon, he restates it. Matthew 22 verse
[23:48] number 34.
[23:50] But when the Pharisees had heard that he
[23:52] had put the Sadducees to silence, they
[23:54] were gathered together. Then one of
[23:56] them, which was a lawyer, asked him a
[23:58] question, tempting him and saying,
[24:00] "Master, which is the great commandment
[24:03] in the law?" So he's saying, "What is
[24:05] this all about?
[24:08] Jesus, Rabbi, what is this all about?
[24:10] What's the most important thing? If I
[24:13] really want to get it,
[24:15] what's the most important thing?"
[24:18] And Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt
[24:21] love the Lord thy God with all thy
[24:23] heart, and with all thy soul, and with
[24:24] all thy mind."
[24:26] So he's saying, "Love the Lord first.
[24:30] Above above all that you are, above all
[24:33] that that is in your heart and your soul
[24:37] and your mind, put God first in
[24:40] everything that you do. Love the Lord
[24:43] God first with everything that's in
[24:46] you."
[24:47] This is the first and the great
[24:50] commandment
[24:51] and the second is like it.
[24:56] So he's saying this second commandment
[24:58] is like to the like unto the first. Thou
[25:01] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[25:05] So these two commandments are similar.
[25:08] The amplified version of verse um the
[25:11] amplified translation of verse number 39
[25:14] says this. And the second is like it.
[25:17] You shall love your neighbor as
[25:19] yourself. That is unselfishly seek the
[25:22] best or the higher good for others.
[25:26] And on these two commandments, remember
[25:29] what I just read in Matthew chapter 7.
[25:31] Now later on he says, "And on these two
[25:34] commandments hang all the law and all
[25:36] the prophets." You know what he's
[25:37] talking about the law? That's Moses's
[25:40] writing Genesis through Deuteronomy.
[25:44] And then the prophets is everything
[25:46] outside of Moses's writing written by
[25:48] the prophets. So basically the whole
[25:50] Bible
[25:52] hangs on this
[25:55] that you love
[25:58] one another and you love the Lord God.
[26:02] Seems kind of simple, doesn't it? It's
[26:04] not.
[26:06] It's very, very important.
[26:09] So Moses's books, Joshua, Samuel, Kings
[26:12] and Chronicles, and Daniel and Jonah and
[26:14] Psalms and Proverbs and Malachi, all of
[26:17] it hangs on loving God and loving one
[26:20] another.
[26:22] Jesus is saying this. That's the most
[26:24] important thing and it's the thing
[26:26] that's so often forgot.
[26:29] This is the golden rule.
[26:32] Remember, treat others as you would have
[26:34] others treat you. The Bible doesn't call
[26:37] it the golden rule.
[26:38] It's said golden because we call it
[26:41] golden because gold is a standard of of
[26:43] the highest value. And if something,
[26:48] you know, if if something goes above and
[26:50] beyond, you just say, "Oh man, that was
[26:52] golden." You know, like that was the
[26:54] best.
[26:56] But the golden rule when Jesus was here
[26:59] was probably familiar
[27:02] to those that were around him as he was
[27:04] preaching on this this sermon on the
[27:06] mount. Sea of Galilee is over here and
[27:08] and the the disciples are down here and
[27:11] the people are gathering and when he
[27:13] talked about that this all the law and
[27:16] all the prophets hang on this to treat
[27:18] others to do unto others as you would
[27:20] have do unto you they pro it probably
[27:22] sounded a little familiar to them.
[27:25] Confucious
[27:27] in 600 BC 600 years earlier said this do
[27:33] not impose on others what you do not
[27:35] wish for yourself.
[27:38] Ancient Greece Thales
[27:41] said this about 600 BC also avoid doing
[27:45] what you would blame others for doing.
[27:50] Hinduism about 400 BC says this,
[27:55] "Do not to others
[27:58] what you do not wish done to yourself."
[28:01] This is the whole of Dharma. Heed it
[28:03] well.
[28:05] And in ancient Persia, Zorastrian
[28:08] Zorastriism
[28:11] 300 years BC,
[28:14] whatever is disagreeable to yourself, do
[28:17] not do it to others.
[28:20] Sounds familiar, huh? But it's
[28:21] different. Jesus said it different than
[28:24] all the other ones said it.
[28:27] Watch how Jesus says. Therefore, all
[28:30] things whatsoever you would that men
[28:32] should do to you, do you even so to
[28:36] them, for this is the law and the
[28:39] prophets. So everybody else is saying,
[28:40] "No, don't do don't do to those things
[28:43] that you don't like someone do to you."
[28:46] But Jesus is he puts it in the active
[28:48] sense. He puts it he he doesn't say as I
[28:50] always say it's not what you don't do
[28:52] for God that matters. You know when you
[28:55] you might go before the Lord and you
[28:57] might say Lord I quit drinking. I quit
[28:59] smoking. I quit doing this. I quit doing
[29:00] this. I didn't do this. I didn't do
[29:02] this. I didn't do that. Lord I didn't do
[29:03] anything for you.
[29:06] I know we shouldn't be doing those
[29:07] things. But we also have to do
[29:09] something. And that's how Jesus is
[29:11] saying it here. All the other ones says
[29:14] they say don't don't don't. Jesus says
[29:17] do.
[29:19] Therefore, all things whatsoever you
[29:21] would that men should do to you, even so
[29:24] do do ye even so to them. For this is
[29:28] the law and the prophets. So everything
[29:30] is summed up right here in this golden
[29:32] rule. It's important.
[29:36] Number one,
[29:38] it says to apply this in all things. And
[29:41] look up there, verse 12. Therefore, all
[29:43] things.
[29:45] And number two,
[29:47] Jesus difference from differs from the
[29:49] others because he is telling us to do
[29:51] something, not to not do something.
[29:56] So what does this have to do with you
[29:57] and me? You know, we can think, oh,
[30:00] well, I'd like it maybe if here's how I
[30:02] would want someone to treat me, so I'm
[30:05] going to treat them in the same way.
[30:09] So how can we apply this to our lives?
[30:13] One thing
[30:14] all of us have control of and words are
[30:16] more powerful now than they have ever
[30:18] been in the history of the world with
[30:20] social media and with the large
[30:21] microphone that everybody has is we have
[30:24] to be careful what we say. I was in the
[30:28] airport um two days ago coming home from
[30:32] Jeffersonville and I was sitting there
[30:35] and and um waiting for uh and waiting at
[30:38] the gate and there was these three um
[30:42] older folks that were there and uh they
[30:47] were obviously from a church and they
[30:50] were obviously some sort of officials in
[30:53] the church. And the lady that was there
[30:57] was a lady and and two men. And the lady
[31:03] kept praising Jesus and she kept talking
[31:06] about the Lord. And the other two men
[31:10] while she was there, they would they
[31:12] would kind of talk about the Lord. And
[31:14] then when she would leave,
[31:17] they would start
[31:19] and they started talking about
[31:22] the uh a deacon in the church. These two
[31:26] men talking to each other and how he was
[31:29] after power and he was on a power trip
[31:31] and they were talking they were talking
[31:33] about him. Then they said, "You remember
[31:34] when Bishop so and so came or when
[31:36] Apostle so and so came and and how he
[31:38] SET HE HE SET THAT IN ORDER AND HE they
[31:41] said the one said the brother." I was
[31:43] like, "Amen, BROTHER. YOU PREACH IT,
[31:44] BROTHER. THAT'S RIGHT." AND HE WAS HE
[31:46] WAS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT that deacon and
[31:48] that deacon was wrong and he was they
[31:50] were talking about all of this and they
[31:52] were putting down the pastor because he
[31:53] wouldn't address it and everything was
[31:54] negative. And then the lady shows back
[31:56] up and she sits down and they shut up
[32:02] and she starts
[32:04] talking about the Lord
[32:06] and one of them let a little word about
[32:10] the pastor come out.
[32:13] And I forgot what it was, but it was
[32:15] something about um not taking care of
[32:18] things in church. And this lady, the two
[32:21] men were over here, and then there was a
[32:23] little aisle and and she was sitting
[32:24] here. And this lady leaned forward in
[32:27] her her chair. And I'm I'm sitting right
[32:30] here, and I'm just digging all this.
[32:34] I have my my earbuds in, but I was
[32:37] listening. And uh and she she puts her
[32:41] hands up
[32:43] and the one that said it, she says,
[32:46] "Come here
[32:48] and he leans over to the edge of his
[32:51] edge of his chair and she puts her hands
[32:53] up and she said, "Grab my hands."
[32:56] and and he put her his hands in her
[32:59] hands. And she said, "But the pastor
[33:03] loves the Lord Jesus and he preaches the
[33:08] Lord Jesus." And she said, "And I love
[33:11] the Lord Jesus." And she said, "That's
[33:14] all that matters." And then she they
[33:17] were they talked a little bit more. Shut
[33:18] them up. She gets up and she walks away.
[33:21] And man, they started again.
[33:25] And I almost I didn't do it and I say,
[33:27] "Lord, should I or should I not?" I
[33:30] almost said, "Friends, I'm talking about
[33:34] the golden rule in a couple days in my
[33:36] church. I'm a pastor, and I just wanted
[33:38] to say, you all are not doing it. I I
[33:41] didn't say it, but maybe I should have,
[33:44] but they were just talking and running
[33:47] these these people down." But when that
[33:49] lady would come in and she would sit
[33:52] there, it stopped because she brought a
[33:55] presence. And imagine if you were that
[33:58] deacon.
[33:59] The deacon wasn't there, but they were
[34:01] running down. Imagine if you were that
[34:03] person. The golden rule, Jesus said, "Do
[34:07] unto others as you would have others do
[34:09] to you." Imagine if you were that deacon
[34:12] and you knew that this lady stood up for
[34:16] you.
[34:18] That is what Jesus is talking about. Do
[34:21] unto others. Now, what do you think that
[34:24] if these two men there and how would
[34:26] they feel if there was two other men in
[34:28] another airport in another terminal
[34:30] running them down? They wouldn't like
[34:32] it.
[34:35] But this lady was actually doing it. she
[34:37] was doing. She was sticking up and she
[34:41] was using her voice
[34:43] to help to live this golden rule.
[34:47] Ephesians 4:29 says, "Let no corrupt
[34:49] word proceed out of your mouth.
[34:52] But what is good for necessary
[34:55] edification,
[34:59] that it may
[35:01] minister grace unto the hearers." The
[35:04] New King James says, "That it may impart
[35:06] grace to the hearers." Amplified version
[35:09] says, "Do not let unh wholesome
[35:13] words ever come out of your mouth, but
[35:17] only such speech as is good for building
[35:20] up others according to the need and the
[35:23] occasion, so that it will be a blessing
[35:25] to those who hear you speak."
[35:29] Same as this lady. She was a blessing.
[35:32] She she corrected that just with her
[35:34] positive attitude that is showing that
[35:37] she is doing what she would want done to
[35:40] her.
[35:43] We talk about other good people, you
[35:46] know, and and we what things
[35:50] would you want behind your back? All of
[35:54] us all of us have had people talk about
[35:56] us. What would you what would you want
[35:58] said behind your back?
[36:01] Would would you want somebody to stick
[36:03] up for you? Would you want somebody to
[36:05] talk good about you? Would you want
[36:07] somebody to lift you up?
[36:09] Or would you want somebody to point out
[36:12] all of your faults? Would you want
[36:14] somebody to repeat the gossip that's
[36:16] going on around you? The golden rule.
[36:20] Well, do to others. Do to others what
[36:23] you would want done to you.
[36:26] Be careful of your tongue. Be careful of
[36:27] what you say.
[36:29] That's just one part of this rule.
[36:31] That's how Jesus can say it all rests on
[36:34] this. If you could just do this one
[36:36] thing, all of the law and all of the
[36:39] prophets is right here. Couple years
[36:42] ago, I was driving home from work. I was
[36:45] on I 10. And I see this lady broken down
[36:49] and I see this van behind her and I
[36:52] thought, "Oh, well, I'd better stop to
[36:54] where I can maybe I could I could offer
[36:56] some assistance." And here is
[37:00] Katie Aaho's dad, Joe Robson,
[37:03] and he's got his van and he's got a
[37:05] whole van full of kids and and they're
[37:08] all there. And here is Joe.
[37:11] And Joe is jacking up the the car that's
[37:17] sitting in front of him. And there's
[37:18] this lady, this elderly lady. And here's
[37:20] Joe getting all greasy and dirty and
[37:22] changing the tire for this for this
[37:24] woman. He didn't know her. He just
[37:27] pulled over and stopped.
[37:29] And you think what what
[37:35] moved him to stop and help.
[37:39] Imagine if that was his wife there and
[37:43] she needed help. Imagine if it was Joe's
[37:45] mom, his elderly mother, sitting beside
[37:48] the road, not knowing what to do, not
[37:50] having anyone to call. This lady, it was
[37:52] so sweet because she didn't have anybody
[37:54] to help her. And here comes an angel
[37:57] from God stops and uh Nina, were you
[38:01] there?
[38:04] Nina probably. So So you've done this
[38:06] before.
[38:08] But an angel from the Lord is sent to
[38:11] help.
[38:13] And Job was doing to this person what he
[38:17] would want done to him.
[38:21] Jesus Jesus is preaching this golden
[38:23] rule and he's saying all of it all of it
[38:25] rests on this. All of the gossip that
[38:28] you do, all of the lies that you do, all
[38:29] the murder that you commit, all of the
[38:31] adultery that that you have, if you
[38:33] would just, you wouldn't want to cheat
[38:36] on your husband or your wife if you put
[38:38] that person first
[38:41] because you wouldn't want it done to
[38:42] you.
[38:44] It all rests on this. You can see why
[38:45] Jesus would say that.
[38:48] Jesus really lived the golden rule. He
[38:50] was the one who served. He lives his
[38:51] life every day, every moment for other
[38:54] people. Why do you think it meant so
[38:56] much to Jesus?
[38:58] Jesus is he he's coming to the end of
[39:00] his life when this lady comes in
[39:06] and anoints his head with oil
[39:09] and washes his feet with her tears and
[39:12] wipes them off with her hair. Why did
[39:15] that mean so much to him?
[39:18] It meant a lot because he was always
[39:20] serving others. And I'm sure it felt
[39:23] very good to have somebody do something
[39:25] for him. Jesus's life
[39:29] was when he was praying. He said, "This
[39:31] kind," when the epileptic boy came up,
[39:33] they said, "Why couldn't we cast him
[39:34] out?" He says, "This kind only goes out
[39:36] through prayer and fasting." Jesus was
[39:38] praying and Jesus was fasting not for
[39:40] himself, but for other people. He was
[39:43] living his life so he could help others.
[39:48] And then he lays it down. He says it's
[39:50] all about this.
[39:52] Jesus said in Matthew 23:1, "But he who
[39:56] is great among you shall be your
[39:58] servant." He who is great among you
[40:02] shall be your servant. So the ones are
[40:03] being served who are being served are
[40:05] not the great ones. The ones who are the
[40:09] ones who are great are the ones who are
[40:11] doing something. They're the ones out
[40:13] there serving people.
[40:15] You know, we they treat other people as
[40:18] they would want to be treated. And Jesus
[40:20] was the perfect example of that. Verse
[40:23] number 12. And whoever exalts himself
[40:24] will be humbled. And he who humbles
[40:27] himself will be exalted.
[40:31] When a negative word is spoken about
[40:33] somebody who's not there, they stand up
[40:35] for that person and they speak something
[40:37] positive because that's what they would
[40:39] want somebody to do for them.
[40:42] There's always negative to say,
[40:46] but are you going to be the one that
[40:47] says it?
[40:49] There's always positive to say, and are
[40:52] you going to be the one that says it?
[40:54] When you gossip about somebody or put
[40:56] someone down, really, you're exalting
[40:58] yourself over that person. But when you
[41:01] speak positive about someone, you are
[41:05] humbling yourself
[41:07] and you're lifting that other person up.
[41:10] Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane
[41:14] in Matthew chapter 26.
[41:18] Jesus was there. This is he was about to
[41:20] go to a cross
[41:22] and here he is and and he knows what's
[41:26] about to happen and he was heavy
[41:30] burdened
[41:32] and he just wanted somebody to pray with
[41:33] him. How many times had he prayed for
[41:37] others? How many times had had he been
[41:39] there for others? And he just wanted
[41:41] somebody to pray with him. He knew how
[41:43] it was. That's how he could make a
[41:45] stand. So many times and and him go
[41:49] because he knew what it was to want
[41:51] somebody just to be there for him.
[41:54] Peter, James, and John are there and
[41:55] he's he's like, "Can you just pray with
[41:58] me a little bit? Can you just watch a
[42:00] little bit? I'm going to go right over
[42:01] here. Just just pray." Hey. And he goes
[42:03] up there and they fall asleep and he
[42:04] comes back and he's like, "Please, can
[42:07] you just pray with me?" He knew how it
[42:10] was. He wanted help.
[42:12] And then he goes and
[42:15] goes there and it's the dead of night
[42:17] and gets on his knees and and he's so
[42:20] tormented that even the water and the
[42:22] blood separated him inside of his body
[42:26] and and the the sweat was coming down
[42:28] like blood off of his face. And then
[42:30] what did he say? He said, "Lord," he
[42:33] said, "father," he said, "let this cup
[42:36] pass from me."
[42:38] Jesus wanted a savior.
[42:42] He wanted somebody to save him, but
[42:43] there was no one that could save him.
[42:46] But do you see what he did? Then he
[42:50] I mean, it could have. He said, "But
[42:53] Lord, I want your will first."
[42:56] He wanted help.
[42:58] But he did for others what he wanted
[43:03] done to him. He saved us. And there he
[43:07] is. He goes to the cross by his own his
[43:12] own choice.
[43:14] He goes to the cross
[43:17] and he's up there
[43:19] and they walk by and they said, "Oh,
[43:22] look at him.
[43:24] He saved others,
[43:26] but himself he couldn't save. Why is
[43:30] that? It's because he he could have
[43:32] saved himself. He could have came down
[43:34] off the cross. They told him, "Why don't
[43:35] you come down off the cross?" He could
[43:36] have,
[43:38] but he would have been serving himself.
[43:41] It would have been putting himself
[43:42] first. But no, he put us first.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; He did the golden rule.
[43:50] He said, "I will stand for them." He
[43:53] said, 'Lord, I'll give my life for them.
[43:54] I don't want to do it. This is going to
[43:56] be hard, but I will go to the cross. And
[43:58] there here he is on the cross. And what
[43:59] does he do? What would you want to do if
[44:01] you were dying?
[44:06] He did what he wanted someone to do. He
[44:09] prayed for them. He said, "Lord, forgive
[44:11] them. They don't know what they're
[44:14] doing."
[44:15] And here is the grace of Jesus Christ on
[44:17] these people. They're spitting in his
[44:18] face and and and killing him, nailing
[44:21] him to the cross. And here is Jesus
[44:22] doing exactly what he would have wanted
[44:26] someone to do for him,
[44:29] giving his life for someone else,
[44:32] doing unto others
[44:35] as he would have wanted. Lord, let this
[44:38] cup pass from me.
[44:40] No one could save him.
[44:43] But he still wanted it. He still desired
[44:45] it.
[44:50] And later
[44:52] really, it didn't matter.
[44:56] It didn't matter how they they they
[45:01] treated Jesus. They spit in his face.
[45:02] They ripped his hair out. They stuck the
[45:04] the thorns in his head. They nailed him
[45:06] to the cross. That didn't matter to him.
[45:09] It does. And it doesn't matter, friends,
[45:10] to us.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; It does not matter one bit. If someone
[45:15] treats you bad, that doesn't mean that
[45:17] Jesus's word isn't true to do under
[45:19] others as you would have them do to you.
[45:22] Doesn't matter how you're treated. It
[45:24] matters that we follow him. And he said,
[45:27] "You treat others." Well, they they've
[45:29] done this to me and that they've done
[45:30] that to me. It doesn't matter. That's
[45:33] not his commandment. His commandment is
[45:35] how do you want to be treated?
[45:38] Then you treat others that way. And then
[45:42] here is Jesus. He goes to the cross. He
[45:45] he's he's crucified there. And and what
[45:47] does he say? He says, "Now you take up
[45:51] your cross and you follow me."
[45:56] What does that mean? You don't go to the
[45:58] cross for yourself.
[46:00] You go to the cross for someone else.
[46:03] He says, "Now you take up your cross and
[46:06] you follow me. You serve others as I
[46:08] have served them. You save others as I
[46:11] have saved them." There's only salvation
[46:13] through Jesus Christ. But we can help.
[46:15] We can point people to the Lord. We can
[46:17] preach the word to them. We can stand on
[46:19] his promises and point people to a a
[46:22] risen savior. And it's hard.
[46:27] And they spit in your face. They they
[46:29] they talk about you. They they run you
[46:31] down. They might discriminate against
[46:33] you at work or wherever it might be. But
[46:35] you can still take up your cross and
[46:37] follow Jesus. for
[46:40] those people that hate you.
[46:45] Do unto others
[46:47] as you would have others do unto you.
[46:53] sad thing
[46:55] is that when Jesus says therefore in
[46:58] Matthew chapter 7, he says all of these
[47:02] beautiful things in the sermon on the
[47:03] mount and he says therefore
[47:07] people might say well you know it's just
[47:10] it's too simple.
[47:12] It's not it's not the deep things. It's
[47:16] not the mysteries. We want the we want
[47:18] the mysteries. A lot of times the
[47:19] mysteries aren't even in the Bible.
[47:20] That's why they're so intriguing. This
[47:23] is a very, very simple thing that Jesus
[47:26] is talking about. But he says all the
[47:28] Bible, all the prophets, they rest on
[47:31] this this one thing. You might say,
[47:34] "Well, that's just not important to me.
[47:37] It's just too simple."
[47:42] Back to Matthew 7.
[47:46] Verse number 12,
[47:48] back to this golden rule. Therefore, all
[47:51] things whatsoever you would that men
[47:53] should do to you, do ye even so to them,
[47:57] for this is the law and the prophets.
[48:02] Another translation says, "So then, in
[48:04] everything, treat others the same way
[48:07] you would want them to treat you, for
[48:09] this is the essence of the law
[48:13] and the writings of the prophets.
[48:16] The golden rule really shouldn't
[48:18] shouldn't be applied like I want someone
[48:20] to do that to me so I'm or I wouldn't
[48:23] want someone to do that to me so I'm not
[48:25] going to do it to them. Instead say you
[48:28] know it would really help me if someone
[48:30] would stick up for me behind my back
[48:33] or pray for me or take me to church
[48:36] sometime
[48:37] or call me and tell me how much I mean
[48:40] to them. You know it would really help
[48:41] me if somebody did that.
[48:45] and then you do it.
[48:48] You know, people you're always thinking,
[48:50] well,
[48:53] don't expect
[48:55] someone to do something for you that
[48:59] you're not willing to do to them. Do for
[49:00] them.
[49:04] Nobody cares about me. How many people
[49:06] How many people called to see how I'm
[49:07] doing? Well, how many people have you
[49:09] called today?
[49:11] Because you have a burden for them. I
[49:13] wish somebody would stick up for me. How
[49:15] many people have you stuck up for behind
[49:16] their backs?
[49:19] You know, send out a prayer request and
[49:20] we see it and we, you know, give a
[49:22] little heart, you know, a little praying
[49:23] hands. But how many people really prayed
[49:25] over the requests that we've seen go out
[49:29] and you say, you might just say, I just
[49:31] need some help. I just I just need
[49:33] something. How many times have you
[49:35] helped other people?
[49:37] I'm not saying that we do this for for a
[49:40] reciprocal thing.
[49:43] But it is important. Therefore, all
[49:45] things whatsoever you would that men
[49:47] should do to you, even so do to them.
[49:49] For this is the law and the prophets. So
[49:51] the B whole Bible hangs on this
[49:55] on these these simple things that Jesus
[49:58] said, which is basically love the Lord
[50:00] God with all of your heart and love each
[50:02] other with the same love that you have
[50:04] for God and do unto others as you would
[50:07] have do unto them or that you would have
[50:09] them do to you. And you say, "But
[50:12] brother Daniel," and I know sometimes
[50:14] I'll get criticized. Well, we want you
[50:16] to preach this or we want you to do
[50:18] that. Why do you always go back to this
[50:22] type of thing? It seems so simple.
[50:26] Listen to me. If I was in the
[50:28] congregation this morning and I was
[50:31] listening to the pastor preach, I would
[50:35] want someone who would bring out the
[50:38] word and bring correction to me and to
[50:41] point me to the words of Jesus Christ
[50:44] and to show me maybe I'm wrong.
[50:48] Maybe I'm not believing right. That's
[50:50] the pastor that I would want. I would
[50:52] want that somebody that loves me and
[50:54] that cares for me. And that is a burden
[50:56] for this. That is a burden for me. That
[50:59] has a burden for my children to see them
[51:01] grow up in the in the image of Jesus
[51:04] Christ. That's what I would want if I'm
[51:06] in the congregation. And friends, that's
[51:08] what I'm trying to do
[51:12] &gt;&gt; is point to this word.
[51:15] And you say, "Well, why is this golden
[51:18] rule so important?"
[51:20] You know, if it sounds good and we see
[51:23] that Jesus said, "Oh, well, all the law
[51:25] and all the prophets and and everything
[51:28] hinges on this."
[51:32] But why is it so important? What are the
[51:36] consequences?
[51:38] Think about this. What are the
[51:41] consequences if we don't follow the
[51:43] golden rule?
[51:45] Read the next verse.
[51:48] Verse
[51:50] number 13.
[51:53] Enter ye in at the straight gate. Most
[51:56] translations say narrow gate or small
[51:58] gate. For wide is the gate and broad is
[52:01] the way that leads to destruction and
[52:03] many there be which go in there. Because
[52:08] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[52:09] way which leadth unto life and few there
[52:12] will be that find it. Jesus is speaking
[52:15] about the golden rule right here.
[52:19] This is a sermon on the mount.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Do we do we grasp how
[52:24] important these words from the Lord
[52:26] Jesus are?
[52:28] You know, you want to hear mysteries and
[52:30] and and you want to hear all these
[52:31] things, but speaking of of treating
[52:34] others, how you would want to be treated
[52:38] is the essence of it all. Verse number
[52:41] 13, New Living Translation says this.
[52:43] Listen to this. You can enter the God's
[52:46] kingdom only through the narrow gate.
[52:49] The highway to hell is broad
[52:53] &gt;&gt; and its gate is wide for the many who
[52:56] choose that way. But the gateway to life
[52:58] is very narrow and the road is difficult
[53:01] and only a few ever find it. Jesus often
[53:05] mentions hell. It's not mentioned very
[53:08] much in modern day churches.
[53:11] Some say that he talked more, some
[53:13] scholars say that he actually mentions
[53:15] hell more than he mentions heaven.
[53:17] He wasn't afraid to mention it. And then
[53:20] a few verses later, he says this verse
[53:23] number 20.
[53:25] Wherefore, he's talking about false
[53:26] prophets, which we'll get into next week
[53:28] if the Lord's willing. Wherefore by
[53:30] their fruits you shall know them. Not
[53:32] everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,
[53:34] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven,
[53:35] but he that doeth the will of my father
[53:37] which is in heaven.
[53:39] We just learned what the will of the
[53:41] father is. And he says, "You're not
[53:43] going to go unless you do that. Many
[53:46] will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,
[53:48] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[53:51] in thy name cast out devils and in thy
[53:53] name done many wonderful works?" And
[53:55] then I will profess unto them, I never
[53:58] knew you. Depart from me, you that work
[54:00] iniquity.
[54:02] Therefore, whosoever heareth these
[54:04] sayings of mine
[54:06] and doeth them, I will liken him unto a
[54:10] wise man which built his house upon a
[54:13] rock.
[54:16] How important.
[54:18] He says, "Therefore," and he gives us
[54:21] the golden rule. And then he says in the
[54:24] very next verse, listen, this is a
[54:28] narrow path, but wide is the road to
[54:32] hell.
[54:38] Luke,
[54:41] I don't have time to read it, but
[54:44] everyone
[54:45] wants mysteries. I remember when I was
[54:47] in Jeffersonville, we found like 10 new
[54:50] sermons.
[54:52] There's 1,200 of them
[54:54] and everybody wanted these 10
[54:57] because they were just found. They were
[54:58] new. I was like kind of like, have you
[55:01] listened to all 1,200? Do you want
[55:02] these? You want these 10?
[55:05] Everybody wants something new. Everybody
[55:07] wants a mystery. Everybody wants
[55:08] something that's maybe not written in
[55:10] the Bible. It's mysterious. Some the the
[55:12] things that are written that Jesus said,
[55:15] they may seem simple, but they're hard
[55:17] to put into practice. He set this bar
[55:19] very, very high. And he says in Luke, I
[55:22] said, I talked about last week how this
[55:24] this woman came before the unjust judge
[55:26] and she kept knocking at his door and
[55:28] she kept saying,"Lord, help me or judge,
[55:30] help me. Help me. I need to be avenged
[55:32] of my adversary." And then finally this
[55:34] judge got tired of it. And he says,
[55:35] "Give her what she wants." And then the
[55:37] Lord Jesus says, "Now that's how you
[55:40] should pray, where you knock all the
[55:42] time. Lord, I need this. I need it." And
[55:43] you continue to knock and he's not a
[55:46] just judge. He loves us. But then God
[55:48] will hear your prayers and answer. And
[55:51] Jesus says this. Now you want to hear a
[55:53] mystery.
[55:55] Here's one of the greatest ones in the
[55:56] Bible.
[55:59] Unjust judge saying. He says, "I will
[56:02] tell you Jesus talking about him. He
[56:03] says that he will avenge them speedily."
[56:06] Listen to this. Luke 18:8. Nevertheless,
[56:11] when the son of man cometh,
[56:14] shall he find faith on earth.
[56:18] When Jesus returns,
[56:22] is he going to find people who are
[56:24] actually practicing what he taught? The
[56:27] musicians can come and we'll close.
[56:30] Will he find people who are not running
[56:33] each other down? Will he find people who
[56:36] are supporting each other? Will he find
[56:38] people who are saying positive things
[56:40] about each other like this lady was in
[56:42] the airport?
[56:44] Will he find people who are standing up
[56:46] for each other?
[56:49] Will he find people who are doing unto
[56:51] others as they would have others do to
[56:55] them?
[57:00] I'm not putting too much emphasis,
[57:02] friends, on these things. Jesus
[57:05] basically said we're in danger of hell
[57:07] if we don't do it. being the pastor of
[57:10] the church and trying to present the
[57:12] word in the correct way.
[57:15] I would want somebody to tell me,
[57:18] hey, here is what is important. Here is
[57:22] the priority in your life. Here is what
[57:25] it's all about.
[57:29] You say, "Well, you know, you're saying
[57:32] that all the mysteries and all the
[57:33] prophecies and all the doctrines and and
[57:36] all of these things, you know, the can
[57:38] be summed up with love the Lord your God
[57:41] with all of your heart, mind, and soul,
[57:43] and love your neighbor as yourself. Love
[57:46] with that same love and and then do unto
[57:48] others as you would have others do unto
[57:50] you." Are you saying, Brother Daniel,
[57:52] are you saying that it's that simple?
[57:55] No, I'm not saying it's that simple.
[57:58] Jesus is saying it's that simple. I'm
[58:01] just reading what he said.
[58:12] You know, there's people here
[58:15] in every churches, every church that
[58:18] they may resent the way that they were
[58:20] raised. They may resent the way that
[58:22] they grew up or they may resent how the
[58:23] church treated them. and they come back.
[58:26] And then there's others
[58:28] who want the same thing that they grew
[58:30] up with. They want to go back to those
[58:32] things. Neither of them,
[58:35] I'm not saying anything good or bad
[58:37] about either of them, but here is
[58:38] wisdom.
[58:40] So in everything,
[58:43] do to others what you would have them do
[58:46] to you. For this sums up the law and the
[58:50] prophets. Remember the mark. It's the
[58:53] truth. The words of our Lord Jesus, the
[58:57] consequences are great. The reward is
[59:00] really is beyond measure.
[59:04] Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[59:14] With our heads bowed, friends,
[59:17] I ask that each person here
[59:21] would evaluate their life.
[59:23] As the Apostle Paul said, "Let a man
[59:25] examine himself.
[59:29] Examine yourself."
[59:32] And Lord, am I
[59:34] putting the right things right? Am I
[59:37] concentrating on what you concentrated
[59:41] on?
[59:44] Or has my mind and my religion gone in a
[59:46] different direction?
[59:51] The Lord Jesus's words were very simple.
[59:56] Think on these things, brothers and
[59:58] sisters.
[1:00:02] Lord,
[1:00:04] we thank you,
[1:00:08] Father, for the simplicity of your word
[1:00:12] and Lord, the the wisdom that just is
[1:00:15] overflowing
[1:00:17] out of these words of Jesus and and how,
[1:00:20] Lord, he did it.
[1:00:25] He actually accomplished it.
[1:00:30] Now father
[1:00:33] was commanded
[1:00:35] by our lord to take up our cross and
[1:00:37] follow
[1:00:39] him.
[1:00:40] Lord help us
[1:00:43] to take up this cross.
[1:00:47] Lord bear it before others.
[1:00:50] Present the gospel in the way that it
[1:00:52] should be presented.
[1:00:54] Lord stand for each other and love one
[1:00:56] another.
[1:00:58] love you, Father, with all of our heart,
[1:01:01] mind, and soul.
[1:01:04] Love one another.
[1:01:07] And Lord, to really put this rule in
[1:01:09] practice.
[1:01:13] Help us, Father, we pray.
[1:01:16] We love you.
[1:01:19] We thank you
[1:01:21] in Jesus name.
[1:01:23] Amen. Amen. Let's all stand as we sing.
[1:01:37] We bow our hearts.
[1:01:41] We bend our knees.
[1:01:45] Oh spirit, come make us home.
[1:01:54] We turn our eyes
[1:01:58] from evil things,
[1:02:02] oh Lord. We cast our Can we sing that
[1:02:07] again?
[1:02:11] We bow our hearts.
[1:02:15] We bend our knees.
[1:02:19] Oh spirit come make us humble.
[1:02:28] We turn our eyes
[1:02:32] from evil things.
[1:02:36] Oh Lord we cast down our idols.
[1:02:42] Give us clean hands.
[1:02:46] Give us pure hearts.
[1:02:51] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:02:58] Give us clean hands.
[1:03:03] Give us pure hearts.
[1:03:07] Let us not lift our souls to run. We bow
[1:03:13] our hearts.
[1:03:17] We bow our hearts.
[1:03:21] We bend our knees.
[1:03:25] Oh spirit, come make us humble.
[1:03:33] We turn our eyes
[1:03:37] from evil things.
[1:03:41] Oh Lord, we cast down our idols.
[1:03:47] Give us clean hands.
[1:03:51] Give us pure hearts.
[1:03:55] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:04:02] Give us clean hands.
[1:04:06] Give us pure hearts.
[1:04:11] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:04:17] Oh God, let us be a generation
[1:04:23] that seeks
[1:04:25] seeks your face.
[1:04:29] Oh God of Jacob,
[1:04:33] oh God, let us be a generation
[1:04:38] that seeks,
[1:04:40] who seeks your face.
[1:04:44] Oh God of Jacob,
[1:04:51] give us clean hands.
[1:04:55] Give us pure hearts.
[1:04:59] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:05:07] Give us clean hands.
[1:05:11] Give us pure hearts.
[1:05:16] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:25] Amen.
[1:05:27] I uh
[1:05:31] Jesus very much set the bar very high
[1:05:36] and I thank God he did and he told us he
[1:05:40] warned us
[1:05:43] here are the consequences
[1:05:47] of not doing these things. So friends,
[1:05:49] please take this word seriously.
[1:05:54] Put these things into action.
[1:05:57] I um I think about the uh I mentioned
[1:06:00] last week or last month that uh Steven
[1:06:03] Young in South Africa, he saw this lady
[1:06:08] there at the school
[1:06:11] and uh the school where they were um
[1:06:14] going to have their um revival
[1:06:17] at the tent meeting and he saw that she
[1:06:21] needed help.
[1:06:23] Poor lady.
[1:06:26] Stephen,
[1:06:28] he is every every day he's dependent on
[1:06:31] the Lord right now with his family and
[1:06:34] and getting this church started and he's
[1:06:36] really stepping out by faith. And he
[1:06:38] walked up to up there and he paid
[1:06:42] with what money that he had by faith. He
[1:06:45] paid that lady's tuition for her her
[1:06:48] child.
[1:06:50] And
[1:06:52] then uh
[1:06:55] this past week he was able to pay for
[1:06:57] the whole year for a child.
[1:07:01] And I think I sure would have wanted
[1:07:04] somebody to do that for me for my
[1:07:06] children if I would have needed it. Boy,
[1:07:08] it would have just Can you imagine just
[1:07:12] never having a thought of God? Never
[1:07:14] having a thought that he can provide.
[1:07:16] And then this angel comes out of nowhere
[1:07:21] and provides what you need.
[1:07:24] Can you imagine doing to others as you
[1:07:28] would have them do to you? And now I I
[1:07:31] think it's it's really neat, really
[1:07:34] really cool. Our offering today for
[1:07:37] South Africa is $777.
[1:07:50] Yeah, I don't I don't I don't get weird,
[1:07:53] you know, with the with the numbers and
[1:07:54] stuff, but boy, I'm glad it wasn't 666
[1:07:59] 77.
[1:08:02] That's a good number. Brother Steven, we
[1:08:05] love you. We love your family. We love
[1:08:07] the Saints there in Durban. And uh we're
[1:08:11] honored that we can do unto you like we
[1:08:15] would want someone to do unto us. God
[1:08:18] bless you friends. No service tonight. I
[1:08:20] believe on Wednesday, if I'm not
[1:08:22] mistaken, we have our Wednesday night
[1:08:24] fireside Bible study, which I'm looking
[1:08:26] forward to. I like doing it. And um then
[1:08:30] next week, next Sunday, um I know this
[1:08:34] one was a was a pretty
[1:08:38] strong one, but next Sunday, we're going
[1:08:40] to be talking about false prophets
[1:08:42] and how we recognize a false prophet.
[1:08:45] Jesus is next. It's next year on the
[1:08:48] list, and we're getting pretty close to
[1:08:49] wrapping up this sermon on the mount.
[1:08:52] And it's
[1:08:54] it's taken me like three or four months.
[1:08:57] Um, but man, these these words in red, I
[1:09:03] know everything from cover to cover is
[1:09:05] the word of God, but those words in red,
[1:09:08] wow, they really they really get to us.
[1:09:11] God bless you, friends. I pray that the
[1:09:14] Lord will be with you. And remember,
[1:09:17] start thinking all the time,
[1:09:19] would someone what would someone want me
[1:09:24] to do in this situation? And then do it
[1:09:27] that way. God bless you. You're
[1:09:28] dismissed.
