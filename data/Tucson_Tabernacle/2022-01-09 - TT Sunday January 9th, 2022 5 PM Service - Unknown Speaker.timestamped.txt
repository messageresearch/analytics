[14:07] i uh
[14:09] i got
[14:10] one against my brother here
[14:13] i didn't know i was gonna i didn't know
[14:15] he gave me a little bit of warning he
[14:16] says brother dan i might call on you i
[14:19] didn't know i was gonna get to be first
[14:20] and break break the ice
[14:23] um
[14:24] there is no
[14:26] um
[14:27] brother branham said
[14:29] that there is no service that's complete
[14:32] without reading the word of god
[14:35] and
[14:37] as i think about testimonies and
[14:40] and it kind of goes along well with some
[14:42] of you were in the last service i
[14:44] preached here when i was talking about
[14:45] joshua
[14:46] and the stones that joshua excuse me the
[14:49] stones that joshua laid down on the
[14:52] jordan river and he told us he said
[14:54] bring your children back to these stones
[14:57] and when they see these stones piled up
[15:00] tell them what happened in this place
[15:02] tell them that these waters of this
[15:04] jordan river parted
[15:06] and testify of these things and i told
[15:09] some of the things about my family about
[15:11] my both of my grandfathers were on the
[15:14] on the mountain in colorado when brother
[15:16] branham spoke the storm away
[15:18] and i gave that testimony and the
[15:20] testimony of my grandfather evans and
[15:22] the snake bite and and losing the car
[15:25] and the different things
[15:27] and those things are a blessing to us
[15:29] but those things are in the past
[15:31] and those stones that joshua piled up
[15:34] they're just stones they're just rocks
[15:36] to bring our thoughts back
[15:39] to these things that have happened but
[15:41] then i went if you remember i went into
[15:44] the book of peter i believe his first
[15:46] first peter
[15:48] and peter said but you
[15:50] are living stones so we are living
[15:54] testimonies to the glory of god and
[15:56] and and the power that god has with us
[15:59] is that brother david god bless you
[16:02] brother david and sister sharon's good
[16:03] to see you i haven't seen you in a long
[16:05] time it's a nice familiar face um
[16:09] so let's uh let's read the scripture
[16:11] let's go back
[16:12] to
[16:14] the book of peter first peter
[16:16] and uh
[16:18] first first peter and he
[16:20] says and i gotta find it
[16:23] um
[16:24] he says a lot
[16:26] let me see
[16:28] first peter chapter three here we go
[16:31] first peter chapter 3 verse 15
[16:35] and remember
[16:36] brother branham said
[16:38] that no service is complete without
[16:40] reading the scripture brother abraham
[16:42] said my words were fail
[16:44] but if i can just read the scripture
[16:46] these words here these words will never
[16:49] fail
[16:51] so uh i will testify to this
[16:54] with brother aaron putting me up here
[16:56] today
[16:57] first peter chapter 3 verse 15 but
[17:00] sanctify the lord god in your hearts and
[17:02] be ready always to give an answer to
[17:04] every man that asks
[17:06] you a reason of the hope
[17:09] that is in you with meekness and fear
[17:12] so friends we should always be ready why
[17:14] are you such a happy people why is there
[17:16] such hope
[17:18] things get down things we we suffer
[17:21] things
[17:22] why are you always so happy
[17:24] well right here we have peter says be
[17:26] ready to answer that question
[17:30] not having a testimony
[17:32] prepared
[17:34] and not really
[17:36] knowing
[17:37] uh what i would say
[17:40] um i will say that the lord has blessed
[17:43] me
[17:44] he's he's blessed me richly in
[17:47] some of the experiences that i've had
[17:50] and i had
[17:52] had a good job at voice of god
[17:54] recordings
[17:56] i was able to go around the world
[17:59] and uh i was able to speak at many
[18:02] ministers meetings and and many of the
[18:04] ministers that
[18:05] were setting up churches or were
[18:07] wondering what brother branham taught
[18:09] about certain things i was able to to
[18:12] be some of the brothers that were able
[18:13] to speak to these things and
[18:16] and encourage the believers in different
[18:19] parts of the world
[18:21] so i've had and then one of the jobs
[18:24] that i had at voice of god recordings
[18:27] somebody had just been introduced to the
[18:29] message
[18:31] or if someone was
[18:34] struggling
[18:35] with with something that they they had
[18:37] on their heart maybe or if there was
[18:39] marital problems or
[18:41] or um
[18:42] everything from drugs
[18:45] to homosexuality
[18:47] to
[18:48] to
[18:49] um
[18:50] did brother branham fail
[18:52] was he not this prophet that we say he
[18:54] is to to to all of these websites that
[18:58] we see and how they attack the profit
[19:00] those questions mostly would would come
[19:03] to me
[19:04] whether it be people who are walking in
[19:06] or writing in emails or calling
[19:09] so i was able to witness a lot of things
[19:12] so
[19:14] in saying that
[19:16] i'd like to maybe
[19:18] ask the audience
[19:21] that
[19:22] maybe some things that are on your
[19:24] hearts
[19:25] a uh a testimony that that you would
[19:27] like to hear about a certain subject or
[19:29] something that that um
[19:32] maybe is happening in your life or that
[19:34] you would like to see
[19:35] and it could be
[19:37] and friends i've seen it all sometimes i
[19:39] i brother bobby i think about
[19:42] what i got to do at voice of god and i'm
[19:44] so thankful i did
[19:46] but the lord led me to leave
[19:49] and and i feel sometimes i feel like i
[19:52] had such a
[19:54] big ministry i i i was able to be part
[19:57] and it wasn't anything that i did it was
[19:59] because of who i represented it wasn't
[20:01] anything that i earned
[20:02] it was because of who i represented
[20:05] and i was able to to do a lot
[20:07] and now i feel like
[20:09] everything's just shrank down to to like
[20:13] lord i don't even have a role to play
[20:16] but if if i can witness in the grocery
[20:18] store or like i was telling about
[20:21] the gym or wherever i'm at i want to be
[20:24] a light to the world and and we do see
[20:26] fruits and i want to see the fruits i
[20:28] don't want to just witness
[20:29] i don't want to just give out a track
[20:32] i want there to be a living as brother
[20:35] branham said a god with flesh on it
[20:37] there has to be that on the other side
[20:39] of that that's why we can't just give
[20:40] someone a tape
[20:42] generally or we can't just give someone
[20:44] a track there has to be a living stone
[20:47] as i said before there has to be
[20:49] something alive there behind that
[20:51] that has that testimony so
[20:54] in in saying that i have a lot of
[20:56] experience and it's it's because of
[20:58] places that i've been and and what i've
[21:00] seen
[21:01] so
[21:02] maybe from the from the audience
[21:04] give me a subject
[21:06] that uh that maybe that that is that you
[21:09] see around or something on your heart
[21:11] tell me something and i'll uh maybe i've
[21:14] had an experience with it
[21:17] i'm going to call on you if you don't
[21:18] raise your hand
[21:21] somebody give me a
[21:23] give me a subject maybe that's on the
[21:24] heart maybe maybe that would encourage
[21:26] this church
[21:28] somebody brother jordan give me
[21:30] something what would encourage this
[21:32] church a testimony about it could be
[21:33] healing it could be about miracles it
[21:35] could be about following away loved ones
[21:37] it could be about
[21:38] about the the false prophecies that are
[21:40] going on about brother brandon what what
[21:42] would you have on your heart for the
[21:43] jordan
[21:54] i we need to testimony
[21:57] i'm gonna have to
[21:59] we'll have to preach that in another and
[22:01] another subject give me something a
[22:03] testimony that you'd like to hear
[22:04] something about
[22:06] maybe a uh an experienced
[22:12] she came and wanted to be you took her
[22:13] order over to tabernacle
[22:18] um
[22:19] i spoke the first time i spoke here
[22:21] did you share that one
[22:23] i believe about baptism
[22:29] um
[22:31] that's there's quite a few there's uh
[22:38] um there was a uh
[22:43] there was a um
[22:45] i used to
[22:47] a lot of my job like i said a voice of
[22:48] god is is there would be phone calls and
[22:51] and things coming in so
[22:53] i still had to get my normal work done
[22:55] so i would i'd work on the weekends
[22:59] and i drove up
[23:01] to uh to the building to voice of god
[23:02] recordings
[23:04] and um
[23:06] on a weekend and i saw a man and he was
[23:09] sitting by the pond in front
[23:12] and uh
[23:13] i was driving by and
[23:16] and he was just he was sitting on the
[23:17] bank and he was looking at the water and
[23:20] man about my age and i stopped and i i
[23:23] said god bless you brother i said um
[23:25] everything okay and he saw i'm just
[23:27] leaving like i was maybe kicking him out
[23:29] you know kicking him off the property
[23:31] and um i said no no no no i said enjoy
[23:34] yourself i was just wanting to make sure
[23:35] everything was okay
[23:38] and he said
[23:40] he said well brother he says i'm having
[23:41] some trouble with my wife
[23:44] and my son
[23:45] he said they're they're not believers
[23:48] and he said you know he says
[23:50] he says i decided in my heart i'm going
[23:53] to
[23:54] i'm going to serve the lord and
[23:57] i was raised in this message but i never
[23:59] lived it and now i want to live it and
[24:01] he said my wife she doesn't want to take
[24:04] off the pants and put on a dress she
[24:06] doesn't want to stop cutting her hair
[24:07] she doesn't want to stop painting her
[24:08] face
[24:09] and and she doesn't want to
[24:11] she doesn't want to live up to it
[24:14] and i said let's go inside so
[24:16] we uh we went in the building
[24:19] and um
[24:20] any of you have been to voice of god
[24:22] recordings but bobby i know you have
[24:23] many times there's a chapel inside there
[24:25] i said let's go into the chapel and talk
[24:28] so we um
[24:30] we start talking
[24:32] and he tells me basically what i just
[24:35] said
[24:37] and uh
[24:38] i said i said brother how dare you
[24:41] i said how dare you put the pressure on
[24:44] your wife
[24:46] she doesn't know anything you haven't
[24:48] lived this life
[24:49] and i went to the book of first
[24:50] corinthians and i said look it says
[24:52] right here that the unbelieving wife is
[24:55] to be sanctified by the believing
[24:57] husband i said now if we go back to
[24:58] brother braham's message we see
[25:01] that that means that she will see you
[25:04] the life that you live and she will want
[25:07] to be like you
[25:09] it's not
[25:10] first corinthians 11. you do what i say
[25:12] i'm the it says in the bible that that
[25:15] the man is the head of the woman and
[25:16] christ is the heavy man brothers we you
[25:18] know what that never works
[25:21] it's because it's done in the wrong
[25:23] spirit
[25:24] so i really got on it
[25:26] and i said what you need to do i said
[25:28] you go back to your wife
[25:29] you apologize
[25:31] you apologize for being so hard on her
[25:33] and you say i want to live my life for
[25:37] jesus christ and i want you to do it
[25:39] with me
[25:41] and um
[25:42] he did
[25:44] well i didn't hear from him and that's
[25:46] some of the the hardest things but aaron
[25:48] is you'll witness to someone and then
[25:50] you never hear back
[25:51] so and you don't know it's like what
[25:53] happened you really appreciate that
[25:54] leper that
[25:55] that jesus said came back and said thank
[25:58] you even though they all got healed you
[26:00] know a couple of them came back and said
[26:02] thanks and he said you know where the
[26:03] rest of them
[26:05] but he called back about a month later
[26:08] and he said uh
[26:10] he's broke daniel he says
[26:12] he says i want to thank you for what you
[26:14] said he says he says i was sitting on
[26:16] the bank of that lake that pond
[26:20] and he said
[26:21] i had my note written
[26:23] i had a pistol in my car
[26:25] and he said i was going to drive up to
[26:27] henryville
[26:28] and i was going to take my life because
[26:29] there was no hope
[26:31] and when he told me i was thinking man i
[26:33] was really hard on this guy if i hadn't
[26:35] known that i'd probably been a little
[26:37] bit softer but it was what the lord
[26:39] ordained
[26:40] and he said oh and he said by the way
[26:42] can you come down he lived in tennessee
[26:44] drove up to jeffersonville to do it he
[26:47] was in nashville i believe he said he
[26:49] said can you come down and baptize my
[26:50] wife and my son they want to be baptized
[26:54] so it works and then there was a there
[26:56] was another there was a woman that
[26:58] called
[26:59] and and she said
[27:03] same thing she said my husband we met in
[27:06] high school and uh you know he's
[27:08] he's never talked about this branham man
[27:12] and
[27:13] he um he's telling me now he started he
[27:16] started listening to tapes and i guess
[27:17] that he grew up with that when he was
[27:19] young he started listening to tapes and
[27:20] now he wants me
[27:22] to um
[27:23] wear a skirt
[27:25] and stop wearing makeup and he's and and
[27:28] he even read me a quote
[27:30] where this branham man said that i was
[27:33] uh um
[27:36] i can say it brother bram said he said
[27:38] that i was a
[27:39] if i did these things brother brother
[27:41] brahm said it i'm okay in saying it he
[27:44] and he was talking about a female dog in
[27:46] that
[27:48] and and she says she says this is wrong
[27:52] she says how dare you all
[27:55] preach this
[27:57] to these women
[27:58] and how dare this branham man do that
[28:02] and who does he think he is
[28:05] and i said sister i said just a minute
[28:09] i said
[28:11] let me let me give you an example
[28:14] i said you and your husband she was
[28:16] about i think she was in her 40s
[28:19] i said you and your husband
[28:21] you go to the the mall
[28:24] and i said you see this 20 year old girl
[28:28] and she's wearing something that barely
[28:30] covers anything
[28:32] strutting around in front of your
[28:34] husband
[28:35] and i said and your husband looks at her
[28:38] i said what do you think about that girl
[28:42] and she's like
[28:43] well i think that she'd be a you
[28:45] know and i said
[28:48] you think like brother brianna
[28:50] i said sister brother brown's not
[28:51] talking about you
[28:53] i said he's talking about that woman
[28:55] that puts herself out there so that men
[28:57] will look at them
[28:58] i said you just take little pieces of
[29:00] what he said and you throw out the rest
[29:03] and she uh
[29:05] it was a little it was a little bit
[29:07] contentious and i was like well i did my
[29:09] best
[29:10] and she calls back
[29:12] i don't know if it's a month or a year
[29:13] later or whatever it is she said i just
[29:15] wanted to tell you i want to say thank
[29:16] you
[29:17] for taking the time that you spent on me
[29:19] on the phone
[29:20] she said my husband and i are now
[29:23] we now go to church
[29:25] and i'm listening to brother branham and
[29:26] i understand now his spirit and it
[29:29] wasn't a spirit of condemnation it was a
[29:31] spirit of love
[29:33] i don't know where they are today but
[29:34] that was
[29:35] probably six seven years ago but i
[29:37] assume that they're serving the lord
[29:38] because she seemed different
[29:41] um
[29:42] is that the testimony was it a different
[29:43] one
[29:52] oh yeah sister tammy
[29:55] um
[29:56] she uh
[29:58] she she was standing on the street
[30:00] corner
[30:01] and
[30:02] somebody walked up to her and she was
[30:04] crying
[30:05] somebody walked up to her
[30:07] and uh
[30:09] she um
[30:11] they gave her a track and it was one of
[30:13] our tracks i think it was jesus christ
[30:14] the same yesterday than whatever one of
[30:16] the newer tracks the voice of god does
[30:18] and she turned it over and there was a
[30:19] phone number there and her husband had
[30:21] left her her son was strung out
[30:24] and she's about to be kicked out of her
[30:26] house
[30:28] and
[30:30] she um
[30:32] just called and she was so upset
[30:36] and uh bless her heart i felt so bad for
[30:39] her
[30:41] and she told me all these things and we
[30:43] prayed and and i sent her two cds
[30:47] i sent her how the angel came to me
[30:51] and life no i sent her be certain of god
[30:54] and life's story was the two cds i sent
[30:56] her
[30:58] and she listened to him she called back
[31:00] a little while later she said hey you
[31:02] got any more of those cds she says you
[31:04] know i'd like to hear some more of them
[31:06] um

[34:31] the african brother
[34:32] he was in a um refugee camp in congo
[34:37] and uh
[34:38] he was a christian
[34:40] and and he would he would pray
[34:43] and um he walked into the jungle one day
[34:46] to pray and uh
[34:49] when he walks out there was a man
[34:51] standing there
[34:53] and this man he says this and if you if
[34:56] you know congolese if you've ever dealt
[34:58] with the french africans they're very
[35:00] direct and he says this this man that

[35:20] he says okay
[35:22] um you know
[35:24] how do you know that
[35:25] so so he starts talking to him he starts
[35:27] witnessing about brother branham's
[35:28] message to him well brother willie ends
[35:31] up giving his heart to the lord and
[35:32] there was a man that ran the refugee
[35:34] camp he had a swimming pool and
[35:36] and uh the the brother that um witnessed
[35:39] to him baptized him in the swimming pool
[35:41] well he was a refugee so
[35:43] he ultimately wanted to get to the
[35:44] united states
[35:46] well
[35:48] he wanted to go to jeffersonville with
[35:51] all of his heart he wanted to be this
[35:53] place jeffersonville where the prophet
[35:55] was
[35:57] so he uh
[35:58] he finally got his visa to come to the
[36:02] united states
[36:04] he was excited boy he was he was ready
[36:07] to go and
[36:09] and but he as soon as he gets to the
[36:11] united states he's going to buy a train
[36:13] ticket or or a plane ticket or something
[36:16] and come to this little place called
[36:18] jeffersonville
[36:19] so
[36:20] he's relocated
[36:22] this unknown city by the name of
[36:25] louisville kentucky
[36:29] he arrives
[36:31] and little did he know that
[36:32] jeffersonville was right across the
[36:33] river
[36:34] from him and he he began attending the
[36:38] branham tabernacle and he is today a
[36:40] witness of god's grace he was i believe
[36:43] he was stabbed
[36:45] while he was in the refugee camp and it
[36:47] started a cancer and this man that had
[36:49] led him to the lord prayed for him and
[36:51] the cancer was healed
[36:53] brother jordan next time you go to
[36:54] louisville talk to brother willie and
[36:56] have brother willie give you his
[36:57] testimony it's tremendous
[37:00] um
[37:01] one more i'll give one more testimony
[37:02] and this is from a
[37:05] a muslim country um what's that country
[37:07] called indonesia
[37:09] um we were there and we had a minister's
[37:11] meeting
[37:13] and
[37:15] this sweet
[37:17] minister
[37:19] um
[37:20] we opened up
[37:21] the uh
[37:22] the forum to questions
[37:25] and uh this old brother
[37:27] precious old brother had the nicest
[37:29] spirit
[37:31] he um
[37:32] he asked the question
[37:35] and he said
[37:37] with what
[37:39] voice of god teaches and what i've heard
[37:43] he says you teach that we should not
[37:45] preach
[37:47] and he said you teach that
[37:50] that there's that we should just play
[37:52] tapes he said brother he said god called
[37:54] me
[37:55] to be an evangelist
[37:58] he said he called me
[38:00] to preach this gospel and he says i've
[38:02] been
[38:02] successful i've been successful in
[38:04] starting churches i've been successful
[38:06] in bringing people in
[38:08] he says
[38:09] how can i feel that same calling
[38:14] and be wrong
[38:16] and uh
[38:18] i told him
[38:20] and remember i was representing voice of
[38:22] god recordings and i believe that this
[38:23] still is the case for the bobby i really
[38:25] do
[38:27] that
[38:28] that i said i said brother i said if god
[38:31] has called you
[38:33] to do something
[38:35] then you
[38:36] do it
[38:38] if he has called you to preach the
[38:40] gospel preach the gospel we're just here
[38:42] trying to get you to listen to some of
[38:43] these tapes that mean so much to us
[38:47] but if god has called you to preach the
[38:48] gospel and preach the gospel go out and
[38:50] win souls to christ these churches that
[38:53] are listening to these tapes would not
[38:55] have people in their congregation if it
[38:57] wasn't for these evangelists going out
[38:59] and winning souls to christ
[39:01] and i told him brother do it go out
[39:04] there and and the brother was so torn
[39:06] and when he left he was almost walking
[39:08] on air
[39:09] and
[39:10] and i assume that he's still he's still
[39:13] preaching the gospel
[39:15] i could stay up here all day but i want
[39:19] i i
[39:21] we read these testimonies and i talked
[39:23] about joshua in these stones
[39:26] and
[39:27] we um we read these testimonies that are
[39:29] in the bible
[39:30] that brother branham tells us
[39:33] and they have a two-fold purpose
[39:36] we look at the woman at the well for
[39:39] evangelism how she came to know christ
[39:42] by by the lord jesus's witness we look
[39:45] at the eunuch
[39:46] out in the desert
[39:47] and how philip went out to him and he
[39:50] witnessed he said he said what are you
[39:52] reading there
[39:54] you know who what he was reading
[39:56] he's reading the book of isaiah
[39:59] and he said what are you reading there
[40:01] and he says well is he speaking is the
[40:02] prophet speaking of himself or somebody
[40:04] else
[40:05] and then
[40:07] philip knew
[40:08] this book well enough
[40:11] to witness
[40:13] you know so often we say oh you know
[40:16] reading your bible is not important it
[40:17] is important because what if you're put
[40:19] on the stand
[40:21] before a person like peter said you got
[40:23] to be ready to give a testimony
[40:26] so what if we're there so so we read
[40:28] these testimonies we read these these
[40:31] things that have happened in the bible
[40:33] and they're a blessing to us
[40:35] just like me
[40:36] here giving testimonies
[40:39] to you it's a blessing to me but
[40:43] i hope it's a blessing to you
[40:46] peter um brother branham preached a
[40:48] sermon called
[40:49] i believe his testimony on the sea
[40:52] and he said that that the disciples were
[40:55] in the boat
[40:56] and peter was there and jesus wasn't
[40:58] there and john and
[41:00] james and they put their they brought
[41:03] their oars in
[41:05] they just started testifying and it was
[41:08] i believe it was brother bram says john
[41:11] and he started giving testimonies about
[41:13] the lord jesus and then peter he
[41:15] couldn't stand it he wanted to give his
[41:16] testimony
[41:18] and these testimonies that we're here
[41:21] we want to give testimonies but they're
[41:23] also a two-fold purpose
[41:25] thank god that these testimonies are
[41:27] written in this bible and they're and
[41:29] they're recorded on tape that we can
[41:31] hear them too and we can be blessed to
[41:34] and that we can apply them to our lives
[41:38] and friends the testimonies that i give
[41:41] they're meaningless
[41:42] unless we can apply them to our own
[41:44] lives
[41:45] they're just dead stones but if we can
[41:49] apply them that makes them alive
[41:51] and i i'm looking forward to hearing
[41:53] some others the ice is now broken so i i
[41:57] want to hear some some of you also god

[49:51] he said all you that are heavy laden and
[49:53] i will give you rest amen brother john
[49:57] brother john has come down from alaska
[50:00] and
[50:01] he's been with us and the other day we
[50:03] mentioned and
[50:04] about him maybe greeting the folks
[50:06] giving a little testimony so
[50:09] he said he would
[50:12] and somebody broke the eyes so
[50:15] i know that from alaska you know have no
[50:17] idea what ice says
[50:19] bless you
[50:20] thank you
[50:22] yeah my wife and i were talking earlier
[50:23] about uh being nervous and she's like
[50:25] you're
[50:26] you're in front of god's people and
[50:28] you're
[50:29] speaking to the church you have to be
[50:30] perfect and i'm like well the
[50:32] the onus isn't on me to be perfect
[50:34] that's on the lord so that's where my
[50:36] perfection rests and it's
[50:39] a little easy and they don't have to
[50:40] break the ice or even worry about it but
[50:43] i saw the scripture on the board as we
[50:46] were coming in this evening that said
[50:49] it was the 23rd psalm the lord is my
[50:51] shepherd i shall not want and that's so
[50:54] simple
[50:55] and powerful when you're looking at it
[50:57] and you you read that and you're like
[50:59] yes and then
[51:00] the very next breath you blink and you
[51:03] look at your bills and and how
[51:05] things are stressful in your life and it
[51:07] goes away you know but if we would just
[51:08] stay focused on that
[51:10] that's
[51:11] that's
[51:12] i mean that is the truth i shall not
[51:15] want and
[51:16] and we've been in
[51:18] situations in our life we've been pretty
[51:20] poor a couple of times been homeless a
[51:22] couple of times and
[51:24] one of the neatest testimonies that i've
[51:26] enjoyed was uh
[51:28] shortly after we got married and we were
[51:32] pretty poor we were making about 18 000
[51:34] a year so that's below the poverty
[51:37] threshold and
[51:38] trying to get by and
[51:41] we were saving up money to go on a trip
[51:43] we wanted to travel through southeast
[51:45] asia and see a bunch of the countries
[51:46] there
[51:47] and we were trying to save up money for
[51:50] that making i don't know a little over a
[51:53] thousand a month maybe 1200 a month or
[51:55] something like that and
[51:57] and tracy's nephew lived in oregon at
[51:59] the time and she really wanted to go see
[52:02] him
[52:03] so she just prayed that the lord would
[52:05] get us to
[52:06] go and
[52:07] see her nephew
[52:09] and then just she actually kind of
[52:10] forgot about it and moved on but
[52:14] god is
[52:15] good and he cares about us even these
[52:18] little things you know just this i was
[52:20] 22 at the time she was 19.
[52:23] just a couple of kids from alaska and
[52:26] my dad called us up and he's been an
[52:27] airplane mechanic for his full career so
[52:29] he's got a bunch of connections and he
[52:30] said hey my buddy's flying a plane down
[52:32] here with nothing on it and then flying
[52:35] it back a week later do you guys want to
[52:37] come down
[52:38] my dad lived in a little town about
[52:40] three hours away from her nephew
[52:43] and so we're like yeah let's do that and
[52:45] this
[52:46] this plane that the guy was flying down
[52:48] is a learjet and we were the only people
[52:50] on it
[52:51] and
[52:52] so we showed up at the airport and i
[52:54] don't know if any of you have ridden a
[52:55] private jet before but there's no
[52:57] security there's no boarding time you
[53:00] just show up and shake the pilot's hand
[53:01] and you walk out onto the ramp and get
[53:04] on the plane and fly wherever you want
[53:05] to go
[53:06] so we were
[53:08] dirt poor and just a couple of kids and
[53:10] i mean on the simple prayer of man i
[53:12] want to go see my nephew the lord gave
[53:14] us a private jet
[53:16] and
[53:17] that's something that i can hold on to
[53:18] ever since then that
[53:20] i mean he's there and he provides
[53:24] a situation we're at right now in our
[53:27] life we've we've been a lot richer than
[53:29] that since then i got hired in a
[53:31] full-time fire department and
[53:34] went through the ranks i promoted i was
[53:36] pretty good at my job and
[53:40] but you know we've got to a point where
[53:42] it was well there's a lot of good things
[53:44] and a lot of bad things and in the eyes
[53:46] of the world
[53:47] working this job
[53:49] i was
[53:50] i had it made i was successful in my
[53:52] career at the apex of the career people
[53:54] all across the country doing what i did
[53:56] wanted to be where i was and
[53:58] i was driving fire trucks making 120 000
[54:02] a year and
[54:03] i worked pretty hard i got on the
[54:06] promotion list to captain and a little
[54:08] over a year ago when we left when we
[54:10] quit that job and moved down here
[54:12] i was third in line for promotion so
[54:15] within probably a month or a month and a
[54:17] half i would have promoted a captain and
[54:19] that's another two percent or ten
[54:20] percent raise so i'd be making 132 000 a
[54:23] year then and been in charge of a fire
[54:25] station running a crew i could have
[54:27] built a crew of
[54:28] the guys that i liked around me and had
[54:30] a
[54:31] pretty good life but
[54:33] i believe the lord was moving us out of
[54:35] that and
[54:37] if you go back a little further in my
[54:39] life i got saved when i was 15. so
[54:41] that's 20 years ago now i'm 35
[54:44] and
[54:45] since that time
[54:47] i mean i've always wanted to serve the
[54:50] lord i've wanted to do missionary work
[54:52] i've gone overseas
[54:54] i've sent people overseas all that stuff
[54:56] but
[54:57] there's only one soul that i know that
[55:00] i've led to christ
[55:02] and 20 years time i've got one person to
[55:05] show for it you know
[55:06] and
[55:08] i just wanted to read a scripture here
[55:10] and i'll read it off my phone because
[55:12] i'm of that generation but
[55:14] this is in luke 13
[55:17] verse 6 it says he spake also this
[55:18] parable a certain man had a fig tree
[55:21] planted in his vineyard and he came and
[55:23] sought fruit thereon and found none
[55:25] then said he unto the dresser of his
[55:27] vineyard behold these three years i come
[55:29] seeking fruit on this fig tree and find
[55:31] none cut it down white cumberth hit the
[55:33] ground
[55:34] and he answering said unto him lord let
[55:36] it alone this year also till i shall dig
[55:39] about it and dung it and if it bear
[55:41] fruit well and if not then after that
[55:43] shalt thou cut it down
[55:46] and you know that's that fruit tree or
[55:48] that fig tree is me
[55:50] um and i don't know i mean i know that
[55:52] the lord gave me my job and my career
[55:54] there and i don't know
[55:56] why i've been 20 years there without
[55:58] leading anybody to christ but
[56:01] but cut around me and put dung on me and
[56:04] make me fruitful and that's my prayer
[56:08] and
[56:09] we
[56:10] got to a kind of a low point in our
[56:12] happiness in our life and started
[56:14] reassessing things and kind of
[56:16] looking at our priorities in life and
[56:20] we're like why do we live in alaska you
[56:21] know we don't do the things that we love
[56:24] there the only thing we have there is
[56:25] the church and the people that we love
[56:28] and it was basically because i had a
[56:30] really good job there and i'm like if i
[56:32] write down my list of priorities my job
[56:34] isn't even on it
[56:36] and so we
[56:38] quit and
[56:40] right now we're just trying to build a
[56:41] life around
[56:43] serving god being together and being
[56:45] healthy
[56:46] and those are some things we didn't have
[56:48] a year and a half ago the servant god
[56:50] we've always done but
[56:52] we just want to be
[56:53] in service for the lord and be fruitful
[56:55] and
[56:56] i just encourage you guys to do that too
[56:58] and i know that the lord will provide
[57:01] the rest for us
[57:03] thank you god bless you
[57:07] [Applause]
[57:10] it's nice to hear someone just speak
[57:12] honest words isn't it amen
[57:16] you know you desire something good and
[57:17] god allows that to be amen

[1:06:02] he says come unto me all you that are
[1:06:03] heavy laden now i will give you rest
[1:06:06] amen
[1:06:08] brother jeremy has asked for time to
[1:06:10] share how the lord gave him the holy
[1:06:12] ghost
[1:06:13] how many here can say i know god has
[1:06:15] filled me with the holy ghost
[1:06:18] and if you want to be honest and say
[1:06:19] lord fill me even more
[1:06:22] hold hands stay
[1:06:24] fill me to the uttermost amen
[1:06:27] bless you brother
[1:06:36] good evening
[1:06:41] i tend to be nervous so
[1:06:45] breaking the ice didn't help
[1:06:49] but we're gonna go to second peter
[1:06:52] 1 20
[1:06:56] and i have a newer bible so it's harder
[1:06:58] to flip pages
[1:07:01] and i think i left my phone down yonder
[1:07:04] so even though i'm new age
[1:07:07] we'll stick to the reading of the word
[1:07:10] from the word
[1:07:16] or i might just read it from the screen
[1:07:18] since they have it up
[1:07:21] knowing first
[1:07:22] um first peter 1 20 and 21
[1:07:26] knowing first that no prophecy of the
[1:07:28] scripture is of any private
[1:07:30] interpretation
[1:07:34] and
[1:07:35] for the prophecy came not in the old
[1:07:37] time by the will of man
[1:07:39] but the holy men of god spake they
[1:07:42] as they were moved by the holy ghost
[1:07:46] and um
[1:07:49] i uh
[1:07:50] one of my best friends is a philip grant
[1:07:53] he's
[1:07:54] moved on to ohio back to ohio
[1:07:57] but for a time the
[1:08:00] sister grant came out here and they had
[1:08:04] a big family
[1:08:06] and we were really good friends and
[1:08:10] there came a year
[1:08:12] and i was baptized when i was 16 i gave
[1:08:15] my heart to the lord
[1:08:17] when i was 13 at louisiana camp
[1:08:20] and i was baptized in six when i was 16
[1:08:23] and then
[1:08:24] um
[1:08:26] receiving the holy ghost i kind of came
[1:08:29] to a point in my life that lord when
[1:08:32] when is it my turn
[1:08:34] i knew something was
[1:08:36] missing
[1:08:38] and i was at a camp meeting
[1:08:41] and
[1:08:43] anyways i brought philip grant in the
[1:08:45] picture because i told him in 2005 the
[1:08:48] lord was coming
[1:08:49] and he's like how do you know the lord's
[1:08:51] coming i don't know i just know
[1:08:53] and three days
[1:08:55] before
[1:08:58] 2006
[1:09:01] i received the holy ghost
[1:09:02] and i was from the sea it was a i i
[1:09:06] didn't get up and testify about it
[1:09:08] because i had never heard anyone else
[1:09:10] give a testimony of that messiah sign
[1:09:14] being done with them they just
[1:09:17] simply said i received the holy ghost
[1:09:19] and they didn't really
[1:09:20] have a
[1:09:22] explanation of it and i listened to
[1:09:24] tapes and brother branham says if you
[1:09:26] have a testimony you should find it in
[1:09:28] the word of god
[1:09:30] and
[1:09:32] so i i've told them since that you know
[1:09:35] god came from me in 2005.
[1:09:38] i didn't know it was
[1:09:40] for me
[1:09:41] but it was
[1:09:43] um brother brown also say it's in ii
[1:09:46] peter
[1:09:48] 1 10
[1:09:52] is
[1:09:54] give diligence to make your calling and
[1:09:56] election sure for if you do these things
[1:09:58] you shall never fall
[1:10:01] and
[1:10:03] um i was sitting in the back of the
[1:10:06] um
[1:10:07] in winter youth retreat in the old camp
[1:10:10] i think it was called
[1:10:12] um it was a nazarene camp before they
[1:10:14] moved it to fahallah which is faith hope
[1:10:17] and love
[1:10:19] but brother ron spencer was ministering
[1:10:23] and i don't know what he was ministering
[1:10:25] on because i was in the back and i was
[1:10:27] in this
[1:10:29] turmoil we sing that song my chains are
[1:10:32] gone i've been set free
[1:10:34] and i was having one of those moments
[1:10:36] where i was reaching out to god and i
[1:10:38] was in a moment
[1:10:41] to myself and i had said something in my
[1:10:44] mind
[1:10:45] that you know if i can see everyone else
[1:10:48] is being blessed by you lord but when is
[1:10:50] it my turn and i said
[1:10:52] simply that okay well i'll i'll go out
[1:10:55] and i'll do my own thing and do this and
[1:10:58] from the pulpit
[1:11:00] the ron was like a blood curdling
[1:11:03] no
[1:11:05] and god said through him
[1:11:08] what i said in my mind backwards he said
[1:11:11] you will live for me and serve me
[1:11:15] and so
[1:11:16] i said okay well i need a confirmation
[1:11:20] because
[1:11:22] you know i uh i was
[1:11:24] hiking up in prescott once and uh
[1:11:27] there's things that people say to you
[1:11:29] all the time
[1:11:30] um as you're walking with others that
[1:11:33] are christian-like
[1:11:34] and we came to a stream and everyone was
[1:11:36] thirsty and my cousin went down on his
[1:11:38] belly and started drinking and i thought
[1:11:41] that sound that looks really silly and i
[1:11:44] went down on one knee and i started
[1:11:46] scooping water and brother russell wall
[1:11:48] said a gideon night
[1:11:50] and soon as he said that my cousin got
[1:11:52] up and got on one knee and started
[1:11:54] drinking water
[1:11:57] and
[1:11:58] but you know
[1:12:00] and
[1:12:01] and either way wasn't any better
[1:12:05] because i tried my cousin's way but you
[1:12:07] know
[1:12:08] at the moment
[1:12:10] i was doing what a gideon night would
[1:12:12] have been doing one of the 300 that god
[1:12:15] would have called
[1:12:17] and
[1:12:19] and so i waded through the line of 45
[1:12:22] minutes and
[1:12:24] and uh
[1:12:26] and went up to brother ron and he stuck
[1:12:28] his hand on my chest
[1:12:29] like he did just recently
[1:12:32] because i i really needed i was
[1:12:34] struggling in my faith because
[1:12:38] i um i struggle at home the most
[1:12:41] because we
[1:12:43] i'm married and we've been barren for so
[1:12:46] long
[1:12:47] and
[1:12:48] we have promises
[1:12:51] and uh
[1:12:53] and i have confirmation and clouds and
[1:12:56] sky and
[1:12:58] um those are two testimonies maybe i'll
[1:13:00] get to them but
[1:13:02] um brother ron said he wants your holy
[1:13:06] ghost i said i ask for leadership
[1:13:09] and he wants your holy ghost and i
[1:13:11] closed my eyes
[1:13:13] and i was in a room of pure light
[1:13:17] and uh brother aaron mcgeary was up
[1:13:19] there and brother ron and they were both
[1:13:21] pillars of light
[1:13:24] and brother aaron like normally if you
[1:13:26] close your eyes even in
[1:13:29] any situation
[1:13:31] any time you pass over your eyes it
[1:13:33] makes a shadow
[1:13:36] and there was no shadow
[1:13:38] and
[1:13:39] so my first scripture that i found
[1:13:42] in the scripture that compared to that
[1:13:45] was uh
[1:13:46] james 1
[1:13:48] um 17
[1:13:51] and 17 18 is
[1:13:53] read together is good but in the
[1:13:55] scriptures because we're
[1:13:57] brother branham tells us that we're
[1:13:59] we're
[1:14:00] we're part of christ
[1:14:02] he gave us a portion of himself
[1:14:05] and we're many member bride
[1:14:08] and so when you take a part of the
[1:14:10] scriptures you're just
[1:14:12] taking the part that's real to you
[1:14:16] and it says with whom
[1:14:18] which is christ
[1:14:20] is no variableness neither shadow of
[1:14:23] turning
[1:14:25] um
[1:14:27] but that's
[1:14:29] that's good
[1:14:31] so i always ask for confirmation i come
[1:14:34] to church for confirmation and
[1:14:36] correction
[1:14:37] because
[1:14:39] like the bible says if you say you're
[1:14:41] not a sinner
[1:14:44] you lie
[1:14:46] and it's it's it's rough
[1:14:49] because you're
[1:14:50] you're a two-part person
[1:14:53] and
[1:14:54] the best way to explain it is in the
[1:14:56] scriptures it says that you don't let
[1:14:59] the right hand know what you're left
[1:15:00] meaning and it's not
[1:15:03] you
[1:15:04] separate your ways between your wife and
[1:15:06] your husband and all that other stuff
[1:15:08] like a lot of people say but if you're a
[1:15:10] two-part person
[1:15:12] and
[1:15:15] everyone sees this
[1:15:17] person
[1:15:18] and knows this person is going to fall
[1:15:21] all the time but this person behind you
[1:15:23] influences you is your control tower
[1:15:27] and um
[1:15:29] and
[1:15:30] and i uh
[1:15:32] i just think it's it's a wonderful thing
[1:15:35] that
[1:15:36] if i don't know if the brothers can pull
[1:15:38] up that picture
[1:15:40] of brother brown standing and
[1:15:43] the pillar of fire is
[1:15:45] behind
[1:15:49] but brother um
[1:15:52] brother uh
[1:15:55] i think it was lonnie
[1:15:57] jenkins he uh went into astute thing he
[1:16:00] used a projector
[1:16:02] with um a transforming our transparent
[1:16:06] kit and he had drawn over the image
[1:16:10] and brother branham talked to brother
[1:16:12] sydney jackson from africa
[1:16:15] and said
[1:16:16] do you see that thing
[1:16:18] behind me
[1:16:20] he said that's my influencer
[1:16:23] when
[1:16:24] in and
[1:16:26] and he says that
[1:16:28] that the um
[1:16:30] when the holy ghost comes in you
[1:16:33] the the sin that you used to
[1:16:36] not that one
[1:16:38] it's um
[1:16:40] it's it's when the holy ghost is all
[1:16:42] around the
[1:16:43] pulpit
[1:16:47] what is it dad
[1:16:51] the the lilies of the flowers
[1:17:06] i wish i had the clip i had a i had a
[1:17:08] down moment in my life and uh
[1:17:11] i deleted like
[1:17:13] 30 gigs off my phone
[1:17:15] and i started all over collecting
[1:17:17] pictures again but
[1:17:20] um it's a really neat testimony
[1:17:23] yeah that is
[1:17:25] it
[1:17:26] and
[1:17:35] yeah
[1:17:37] yeah so
[1:17:38] let's hear
[1:17:39] off on
[1:17:42] youtube
[1:17:44] all right so this little image here
[1:17:49] and how the hair comes down like this
[1:17:52] where the branham says my influencer
[1:17:54] looks like um
[1:17:57] my mom was a
[1:17:59] a riverwoman indian
[1:18:02] and that's how it was displayed
[1:18:05] the holy ghost let it
[1:18:08] take a picture of that lens
[1:18:10] and he said when you receive the holy
[1:18:12] ghost your influencer comes back here
[1:18:15] and it only can
[1:18:18] tap you and that says that's there all
[1:18:20] the time and it always tells me to do so
[1:18:23] other things
[1:18:27] it tells you to do other things but you
[1:18:29] you can choose to resist it
[1:18:33] so when you have the holy ghost that's
[1:18:35] why you have so much trouble you have
[1:18:37] thoughts going in when i was trying to
[1:18:39] prepare for this sermon i was at a
[1:18:42] at a food restaurant and every time i
[1:18:45] read a scripture some other thing popped
[1:18:47] up and i was like no we're not we're
[1:18:50] gonna stay on the testimony
[1:18:53] and um yeah it's
[1:18:56] it's
[1:18:57] it's a wonderful thing to know god
[1:19:01] um
[1:19:03] but
[1:19:05] when we were in transition me and my
[1:19:07] wife two
[1:19:08] two
[1:19:10] testimonies
[1:19:11] that you know god builds you
[1:19:14] he builds you into the perfect
[1:19:17] person of jesus christ
[1:19:20] and he adds
[1:19:21] not so much adds to you or takes from
[1:19:23] the word or adds to it but he
[1:19:27] gives you enough information to
[1:19:30] see it in a better light and make it
[1:19:32] more simple
[1:19:35] and i was just sitting at a breakfast
[1:19:38] table i was renting from my grandparents
[1:19:41] and basically i asked god a spiritual
[1:19:45] question
[1:19:46] for a physical need because
[1:19:48] he had told us that we would get the
[1:19:50] house we wanted
[1:19:52] but we were searching for a whole year
[1:19:55] and we didn't know what it is so i just
[1:19:57] simply asked him
[1:19:58] lord will you show us things
[1:20:00] and i was praying over food and i said
[1:20:02] in the name of lord jesus christ
[1:20:05] two days later someone texted me
[1:20:08] and this person she
[1:20:11] didn't know me from adam we had this
[1:20:13] conversation back and forth she thought
[1:20:14] i was her cousin jeremy and
[1:20:17] and i was like how'd you get my number
[1:20:19] all this other stuff but she said why
[1:20:21] are you caught i asked her why are you
[1:20:23] contacting me and she said jesus wants
[1:20:26] you to look up jeremiah 33 3
[1:20:30] and so two days later well god does a
[1:20:33] lot of things in two days
[1:20:35] or two two's always
[1:20:38] two witnesses
[1:20:40] two or three let things be established
[1:20:42] in two or three
[1:20:44] i believe it's matthew wrote it down
[1:20:46] matthew 18 16.
[1:20:50] and um
[1:20:52] but um
[1:20:54] said
[1:21:00] everything
[1:21:01] be established in the mouth of
[1:21:03] two or three witnesses
[1:21:06] every word may be established yeah
[1:21:08] that's good
[1:21:09] and then um
[1:21:13] so ang ange had that little visitation
[1:21:16] up in this chapel room
[1:21:18] and we all heard her testimony
[1:21:20] um of this
[1:21:22] five things
[1:21:24] there was six but we omitted one
[1:21:27] because we're told it was wisdom
[1:21:31] um
[1:21:32] but she had asked me 15 months later
[1:21:36] like what god works on both sides
[1:21:39] it's like and she wanted to hurry she
[1:21:42] wanted the children to come and
[1:21:45] and the children are coming because
[1:21:47] god's word doesn't fail
[1:21:50] and i
[1:21:54] so i asked god a simple question like
[1:21:56] that and two days later the cloud
[1:21:59] picture came up
[1:22:01] and um
[1:22:02] i don't
[1:22:03] have that i don't know if it's
[1:22:06] it's saved in the email or not
[1:22:09] but um
[1:22:12] it was just
[1:22:14] it was just
[1:22:15] present
[1:22:16] day like manna that
[1:22:18] you know we serve a god and i asked god
[1:22:22] about whatever you want to do whether
[1:22:26] it's a sign in heaven or something like
[1:22:28] that and a lot of people said oh you
[1:22:29] asked for a sign you know
[1:22:31] the
[1:22:32] scripture comes up that everyone that
[1:22:34] asked for a sign is a wicked an
[1:22:36] adulterous nation and
[1:22:38] and i said well
[1:22:40] brother brown said there's a difference
[1:22:42] in asking for a sign
[1:22:44] and recognizing your sign
[1:22:48] so
[1:22:48] we're
[1:22:51] we're in the midst of a vision
[1:22:54] and uh you just just keep us in prayer
[1:22:57] angela decided to stay home tonight
[1:23:00] and um
[1:23:03] she
[1:23:06] like brother dan said to brother aaron i
[1:23:08] got one on you
[1:23:10] she
[1:23:11] she does not like to be the center of
[1:23:13] attention
[1:23:14] so if you can keep that in your mindset
[1:23:18] you can bring me up in any sermon you
[1:23:20] want
[1:23:21] but
[1:23:22] if you could leave my wife out of it i
[1:23:24] would
[1:23:25] greatly appreciate it
[1:23:28] i trust these words are
[1:23:30] are good god bless you
[1:23:42] i love you my brother no i do i love you
[1:23:46] thank you
[1:23:52] sometimes when you get behind the pulpit
[1:23:54] you have to preach
[1:23:56] and god lays it on your heart
[1:23:59] and and you surrender and you minister
[1:24:03] but you don't know what it took to get
[1:24:05] to that point
[1:24:07] when you look at yourself and you say
[1:24:08] man i don't even match that
[1:24:11] but you have to minister it
[1:24:14] and then god will answer
[1:24:17] again today a brother walking in to the
[1:24:20] church and he said that song
[1:24:23] take david at the altar
[1:24:25] he said that minister to me today
[1:24:29] you don't know
[1:24:31] what somebody's saying what somebody's
[1:24:32] doing he's going to reach into
[1:24:33] somebody's heart
[1:24:35] and god is going to minister
[1:24:37] i just brother jeremy and sister angel
[1:24:39] is part of this congregation

[1:32:59] finish tonight okay
[1:33:02] i've got you in mind so sarah sarah
[1:33:04] makes ready
[1:33:06] yesterday we were
[1:33:09] here in the in in with the singing
[1:33:12] and um
[1:33:14] i got here a little early and
[1:33:17] i apologize if you were offended and how
[1:33:19] i was dressed when i
[1:33:21] stood up because i didn't have any plan
[1:33:23] for that
[1:33:24] so i was casually dressed and
[1:33:27] met brother jack duff outside and we got
[1:33:29] to talking a little bit sharing
[1:33:32] so he asked about the church and this
[1:33:33] and we shared he goes oh brother aaron
[1:33:35] you got to get up you got to open the
[1:33:37] service and you got to share some of
[1:33:38] those things with us
[1:33:40] and i said look how i'm dressed he says
[1:33:42] oh that's all right just go up there
[1:33:45] and so i pre i enjoyed it last night i
[1:33:48] appreciate it much and
[1:33:51] you know sometimes we get so conscious
[1:33:52] about ourselves
[1:33:54] that we miss a blessing yeah
[1:33:56] anything so
[1:33:58] worship the lord love the lord with all
[1:34:00] your heart amen
[1:34:02] i wanted to share this um quote
[1:34:06] because to be honest yesterday was a
[1:34:09] very
[1:34:10] tough day um i was grateful after the
[1:34:13] singing such a blessing to be here for
[1:34:15] the singing and i came here
[1:34:18] when i really probably should have gone
[1:34:19] home and rested but i didn't want to
[1:34:21] dwell on what had happened at treatment
[1:34:24] and
[1:34:24] so i came here instead and just said
[1:34:26] lord i'm here to
[1:34:28] be encouraged to worship you and to
[1:34:31] just believe in spite of these things
[1:34:33] that i'm going through that you're my
[1:34:35] healer
[1:34:37] and this quote is one i have on a little
[1:34:39] plaque in my home
[1:34:42] to remind me
[1:34:44] when this started
[1:34:46] so many years ago it's from the second
[1:34:49] miracle and brother branham just says
[1:34:50] refuse to sign for anything the devil
[1:34:52] brings he will have to take it back say
[1:34:55] i refuse to have it i won't have it no
[1:34:58] sir he will have to take it back in the
[1:35:00] name of the lord if you believe it and
[1:35:03] confess it and say i've accept jesus
[1:35:06] christ as my healer there's no
[1:35:08] affliction or disease that can stay on
[1:35:10] you stay right with it so today my
[1:35:13] testimony
[1:35:14] is definitely in this song
[1:35:17] when i heard it i thought you know we
[1:35:19] often ask the lord to give us courage
[1:35:22] and we're not it's kind of faith
[1:35:26] sight unseen right but this song speaks
[1:35:29] more about that confession
[1:35:31] and always my testimony has been i
[1:35:33] confess jesus christ as my healer and
[1:35:36] today i just want to be public again to
[1:35:39] stand and say
[1:35:40] i'm healed doesn't matter what it looks
[1:35:43] like i'm healed
[1:35:44] and i know that he's going to bring that
[1:35:46] full manifestation so god bless you
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:36:01] i've stood on the banks of a white
[1:36:05] raging river
[1:36:07] trust
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:17] believing i never get lost
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:31] it's through every trial each test and
[1:36:35] temptation
[1:36:36] there's
[1:36:42] over and
[1:36:43] [Music]
[1:36:49] over and over
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:37:19] you ask is why i have no hesitation
[1:37:23] god does what he
[1:37:27] [Music]
[1:37:33] there's says
[1:37:34] he won't bring me through
[1:37:38] so why should i dwell on the heartache
[1:37:48] the way this will end is in great
[1:37:51] celebration
[1:37:53] deep in my heart i believe
[1:37:58] over and
[1:38:00] over again and again god is faithful
[1:38:06] over and over
[1:38:15] [Music]
[1:38:25] but jesus is
[1:38:30] over and over again
[1:38:35] over and over
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:39:02] but jesus is with me so i'll claim the
[1:39:06] victory over and over again
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:20] i'll tell you now
[1:39:22] don't go at it with her
[1:39:25] cause she'll she'll stand her ground
[1:39:28] amen
[1:39:30] great is thy faithfulness
[1:39:32] great as i feel
[1:39:41] oh god my father
[1:39:46] there is
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:40:06] as i
[1:40:09] have forever
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:22] is thy faithfulness
[1:40:29] [Music]
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:47] is
[1:40:49] [Music]
[1:41:03] he also asked us to remember brother
[1:41:05] noel
[1:41:06] johnson
[1:41:08] in prayer he had
[1:41:10] he was doing i think he said some well
[1:41:11] i'll let him share it with you you share
[1:41:13] that about brother noah for prayer
[1:41:16] good evening god bless you and i'll be
[1:41:18] less than an hour
[1:41:21] my brother and old uh
[1:41:22] let me know he he'd had a cat scan uh
[1:41:25] about a week ago and they got the
[1:41:27] results back
[1:41:28] and there's something in his heart that
[1:41:30] they're not thrilled about so they're
[1:41:32] planning on putting a stent in
[1:41:34] doesn't know exactly when it's going to
[1:41:36] be it's not an emergency thing but he
[1:41:38] mentioned it and i want to share it with
[1:41:40] the body of christ because
[1:41:42] that's where my confidence lies is in
[1:41:44] the lord jesus that lives in each of you
[1:41:49] let's see if this is turned on because
[1:41:51] you know that i can't get up here
[1:41:52] without
[1:41:54] using one of these oh very good thank
[1:41:56] you
[1:41:58] and this is a testimony it's not a
[1:42:00] sermon and and probably some of you
[1:42:02] already know the answer to the puzzle to
[1:42:04] all of this and if you do that's okay
[1:42:07] i'm just a little slow
[1:42:08] but
[1:42:09] but i want to thank you for the
[1:42:11] opportunity this evening to share this
[1:42:13] testimony but when our family moved to
[1:42:15] tucson in late 1966
[1:42:18] following year 1967 i was 17 years old
[1:42:21] and i heard brother branham say on a
[1:42:23] tape that the aims of the lord came to
[1:42:26] him on may the 7th 1946
[1:42:29] and i also heard him say that was the
[1:42:31] same day that israel became a nation
[1:42:37] how can this be
[1:42:38] the u.n vote to partition
[1:42:40] palestine into an arab and jewish state
[1:42:42] was until november 29th 1947.
[1:42:46] the british didn't withdraw from
[1:42:47] palestine until
[1:42:49] may 14th may 15th of 1948 and that's
[1:42:52] when israel became a nation
[1:42:55] how was that the same day brother dan if
[1:42:57] you know the answer don't tell us
[1:43:00] even though i was only 17
[1:43:02] this bothered me i was confused
[1:43:05] over the years i've asked a number of
[1:43:07] people
[1:43:08] do you know what this means but what
[1:43:10] what was he talking about how was this
[1:43:12] the same day
[1:43:14] and i did
[1:43:15] always i'd get one of two answers maybe
[1:43:17] i didn't ask the right people but i'd
[1:43:18] either get the answer well
[1:43:22] israel secretly became a nation
[1:43:24] in 1946 and they signed some deal with
[1:43:26] the vatican
[1:43:28] or i'd hear
[1:43:30] i just put it on a shelf brother i don't
[1:43:31] understand it but the prophet said it
[1:43:33] and i believe it
[1:43:34] well neither one of those answers was
[1:43:36] very satisfactory to me
[1:43:39] fast forward now to november of 1970
[1:43:42] instead of being 17 now i'm 70 even
[1:43:45] though
[1:43:46] sometimes i still act like a teenager
[1:43:48] but it was still bothering me and i
[1:43:49] thought
[1:43:50] why would william brano
[1:43:52] a man i believe to be both a prophet
[1:43:55] and a messenger to the laodicean church
[1:43:57] age make this statement
[1:43:59] obviously he believed it was true
[1:44:02] and he repeated it many times
[1:44:05] did he really think modern israel came
[1:44:08] into being in 1946
[1:44:10] in spite of the internment camp for
[1:44:12] holocaust survivors who desperately
[1:44:14] sought refuge in palestine from 1945 to
[1:44:17] 1948 and were blocked by the british
[1:44:19] from coming
[1:44:21] it's inconceivable brother branham may
[1:44:23] have lacked education but he did not
[1:44:25] lack intelligence
[1:44:27] people who disparage or mock brother
[1:44:29] branham's ministry use this 1946 claim
[1:44:32] as one of their arguments against what
[1:44:34] we call in love and embrace the message
[1:44:38] well
[1:44:39] i'm a little slow sometimes so i finally
[1:44:41] stopped asking people this question and
[1:44:43] i decided i needed to ask the lord
[1:44:47] help me find the answer to this enigma
[1:44:50] maybe you already know the answer i
[1:44:51] didn't know the answer my testimony
[1:44:54] tonight is simply this
[1:44:56] he did
[1:44:58] and i want to take a very few minutes to
[1:45:00] explain
[1:45:02] the solution the explanation
[1:45:05] brother branham frequently referred to
[1:45:07] the first time
[1:45:08] that he met the angel of the lord and at
[1:45:11] different times he variously states that
[1:45:13] it was
[1:45:14] the date was may 6 or may 7th in 1947
[1:45:17] and and the earliest tape we have of
[1:45:19] april of 1947 he doesn't mention a date
[1:45:21] but he talks about it but he doesn't
[1:45:23] mention anything about israel being a
[1:45:25] nation
[1:45:26] it wasn't until 1953 that he tied the
[1:45:29] date of that encounter with the founding
[1:45:32] of the modern nation of israel
[1:45:35] now i've got a less than a minute audio
[1:45:37] clip
[1:45:38] that i'm going to try and play here if i
[1:45:40] can figure out how to use this machine
[1:45:43] it's from questions and answers on
[1:45:45] genesis
[1:45:46] july 29 1953 he'll read the question
[1:45:50] provide a little bit of background and
[1:45:52] then make the statement it appears that
[1:45:55] it's the first time he publicly made
[1:45:57] this claim
[1:45:58] and he's clearly excited about it i i
[1:46:01] personally suspect he had only recently
[1:46:04] made the connection himself
[1:46:06] so let's listen if i can do this right
[1:46:09] [Music]
[1:46:12] jews return to palestine is a
[1:46:14] fulfillment of the bible prophecy that's
[1:46:17] the question we heard you were going to
[1:46:19] palestine is that true yes
[1:46:22] yes sir let me tell you something one of
[1:46:24] the greatest if you want to see what
[1:46:26] time of year it is look on the calendar
[1:46:30] if you want to see what time of night it
[1:46:32] is look at the clock
[1:46:34] if you want to see what they were living
[1:46:36] in look where the jews are
[1:46:41] and look the very night the very day
[1:46:45] that the angel lord let me 1946
[1:46:49] on may the 7th
[1:46:51] at greensville indiana that same day the
[1:46:54] treaty of peace was signed for the jews
[1:46:56] and they were a fabulous nation for the
[1:46:58] first time for
[1:46:59] 2500 years
[1:47:02] amen hallelujah
[1:47:07] brother branham was pretty excited
[1:47:10] but what's going on
[1:47:12] we know that israel did not exist as a
[1:47:15] nation in modern times until the first
[1:47:17] moment of may 1948.
[1:47:20] israel couldn't sign a treaty or enter
[1:47:22] an agreement with any nation before then
[1:47:24] any more than i could sign a contract
[1:47:25] before i was born
[1:47:27] so what is it about these states what is
[1:47:31] brother branham sharing with us that
[1:47:33] only he could share
[1:47:35] and the other piece that we can find
[1:47:37] anywhere
[1:47:40] may 15th
[1:47:41] isn't may 7th
[1:47:44] 1948
[1:47:46] is not 1946.
[1:47:48] so i thought
[1:47:50] well maybe the dates are clues
[1:47:53] perhaps something is hidden in them
[1:47:56] and then i saw it
[1:48:00] let's look at a calendar for may 1948
[1:48:02] when israel's independence was
[1:48:04] established on the world stage
[1:48:06] the calendar on the screen includes the
[1:48:09] corresponding jewish calendar dates if
[1:48:11] you can't see it it's because you're
[1:48:13] sitting too far back too much social
[1:48:14] distancing is going on here
[1:48:17] in the jewish calendar a day begins just
[1:48:20] after sunset it's because genesis 1
[1:48:23] says for example and the evening and the
[1:48:25] morning were the first days so they
[1:48:26] don't start a day at midnight like we do
[1:48:28] they start it
[1:48:29] at around sunset well let's like take a
[1:48:32] closer look at that part of the calendar
[1:48:34] that i circled
[1:48:37] the declaration of establishment which
[1:48:39] created the modern nation of israel
[1:48:42] was to take effect at midnight on and i
[1:48:45] quote the eve of sabbath the 6 ir
[1:48:48] 5708 15th may 1948 end quote
[1:48:54] the declaration was publicly read as you
[1:48:57] see on the screen in tel aviv at 4 pm
[1:49:01] on may 14
[1:49:03] 1948.
[1:49:04] this was
[1:49:06] the fifth of ir
[1:49:09] it took effect a few hours later on the
[1:49:13] sixth of ir
[1:49:15] the year was 5708 on the jewish calendar
[1:49:17] 1948 on ours
[1:49:20] well what about 1946
[1:49:24] you're still sitting too far back here's
[1:49:26] the entire month so let's zoom in on the
[1:49:29] dates of interest may 6th and 7th
[1:49:32] we see that may 6 1946 was the fifth of
[1:49:36] ir
[1:49:38] israel's declaration of establishment
[1:49:40] occurring exactly two years later on the
[1:49:43] jewish calendar
[1:49:45] and may 7 1946 was the sixth of ir the
[1:49:50] date when israel was reborn as a nation
[1:49:53] again on the jewish calendar
[1:49:56] this inconsistency of dates between our
[1:49:59] calendar
[1:50:00] for those two years and the jewish
[1:50:02] calendar may 6 and 7 verses may 14 and
[1:50:05] 50 is due to israel using a lunar based
[1:50:09] calendar
[1:50:10] they use the moon not the sun to
[1:50:12] establish months and dates for example
[1:50:15] you've undoubtedly noticed that easter
[1:50:17] occurs no earlier than march 22nd and no
[1:50:19] later than april 25th in a given year
[1:50:22] why isn't it on the same date every year
[1:50:25] or even the same month
[1:50:28] it isn't a consistent date on our solar
[1:50:31] based calendar because it depends on the
[1:50:33] jewish lunar base calendar for passover
[1:50:37] that's when jesus was crucified
[1:50:39] that's why you need our calendar date
[1:50:42] including the year
[1:50:44] not just may 7th but may 7
[1:50:46] 1946
[1:50:48] to know the jewish calendar date
[1:50:51] so here i've put the two of them
[1:50:52] together you can see
[1:50:56] if i can get my limited number of notes
[1:50:58] together here i've put the zoomed in
[1:51:00] dates of 46 and 48 together here so you
[1:51:03] can plainly see that correlation
[1:51:05] may 6
[1:51:07] corresponds to the 14th may 7
[1:51:10] corresponds to the 16th the declaration
[1:51:12] and the birth of the nation
[1:51:15] brother branham was not claiming that
[1:51:17] israel somehow secretly became a nation
[1:51:20] and signed mysterious treaties in 1946
[1:51:25] or that he was somehow ignorant that
[1:51:27] israel's independence didn't occur until
[1:51:29] 1948.
[1:51:31] anybody here born on lincoln's birthday
[1:51:34] or know anybody that ever claimed that
[1:51:36] they were born on lincoln's birthday
[1:51:39] well i've known several people
[1:51:42] but what they're saying isn't that they
[1:51:44] were born in 1809
[1:51:46] they're saying they were born on
[1:51:47] february 12th
[1:51:49] and that's exactly what brother branham
[1:51:51] was telling us
[1:51:53] but it's jewish calendar dates which is
[1:51:55] appropriate because he's talking about
[1:51:57] israel what is more jewish than that
[1:52:01] so you can see that's exactly what
[1:52:03] happened
[1:52:04] you know the lord loves to hide things
[1:52:08] in plain sight god hidden and revealed
[1:52:11] in simplicity and didn't jesus admonish
[1:52:14] even commanded us in luke i say unto you
[1:52:18] ask
[1:52:19] and it shall be given to you seek
[1:52:22] you'll find
[1:52:24] knock
[1:52:25] it'll be open to you for everyone that
[1:52:27] asks
[1:52:28] receives he that seeks
[1:52:30] finds to him that knocks it shall be
[1:52:34] opened in my case
[1:52:36] it only took 54 years
[1:52:38] thank you god bless you
[1:52:44] [Applause]
[1:52:49] i'm glad that there are people
[1:52:51] who are interested in those things
[1:52:54] and i'll tell you why
[1:52:56] because if there wasn't people
[1:52:57] interested in saying we wouldn't have
[1:52:59] airplanes today
[1:53:00] we wouldn't have a lot of things that we
[1:53:02] have today because somebody
[1:53:04] has something in their heart
[1:53:06] to go out and look for it and
[1:53:08] i appreciate that brother lyle is that
[1:53:10] pertinent to salvation
[1:53:14] okay
[1:53:16] but do you appreciate god and brother
[1:53:17] brandon being exact
[1:53:20] that's what i appreciate
[1:53:22] brother branham and even history and
[1:53:24] even even well in in the launching of of
[1:53:27] uh
[1:53:28] the the rockets and all
[1:53:31] they can go back and look at the laws
[1:53:35] and say if we shoot it at this time at
[1:53:37] this speed to for this amount of time
[1:53:39] it'll enter here and to hit it right on
[1:53:41] it
[1:53:42] because they discovered that now because
[1:53:44] god set those laws in order
[1:53:46] so to god be all the glory and all the
[1:53:48] praise amen
[1:53:51] you know
[1:53:54] people have asked me a few times
[1:53:58] uh what was my what was my conversion
[1:54:01] how was i where did i come from and
[1:54:04] i can give praise and thanks to god that
[1:54:06] i was raised by godly parents
[1:54:08] my mom and dad sitting there towards the
[1:54:10] back
[1:54:12] became christians in their early lives
[1:54:14] and their teenage years
[1:54:16] and served the lord
[1:54:18] from then to this day
[1:54:21] and
[1:54:22] you know they were human parents like
[1:54:24] others and today we were talking with
[1:54:27] some of the folks about
[1:54:29] some of the little kids as they started
[1:54:30] growing they start running around
[1:54:32] started doing and
[1:54:34] i was sitting right about where little
[1:54:35] brother was sitting there on the very
[1:54:37] front row of church
[1:54:39] wooden bench
[1:54:41] no carpet
[1:54:42] so i was sitting on the inside corner
[1:54:44] there another young boy there and one on
[1:54:46] that in and those two boys were rolling
[1:54:48] the marble back and forth and if you
[1:54:50] roll a marble back and forth on the wood
[1:54:52] bench everybody hears it
[1:54:55] so the brother the minister he's the
[1:54:56] pastor and he's there and he goes
[1:54:58] there's some young boys playing right up
[1:55:00] here in the front row
[1:55:03] and i was watching but hey i wasn't
[1:55:05] playing
[1:55:07] and
[1:55:08] dad comes up from back there maybe or
[1:55:11] whether robert's boy sitting a little
[1:55:12] ways back there
[1:55:14] and he walks because he sees my head
[1:55:17] and he comes walking up
[1:55:19] next thing i know from right here he
[1:55:21] pulls me straight up and walks me
[1:55:23] straight back out
[1:55:25] and i got a weapon
[1:55:27] and all the way out saying dad i wasn't
[1:55:28] doing that i wasn't playing he goes yeah
[1:55:30] but you were sitting with him
[1:55:35] let not our
[1:55:36] identification just because we're
[1:55:39] sitting with them
[1:55:40] but because we are
[1:55:42] christians
[1:55:44] it's not good enough to just be there
[1:55:48] and just say hey i was there when it
[1:55:50] happened no i experienced the indwelling
[1:55:53] of the holy spirit i have met him for
[1:55:56] myself
[1:55:58] and it has kept me
[1:56:01] it has watched over me i can look back
[1:56:04] at some things in my young life
[1:56:06] and say that was god
[1:56:08] that was god
[1:56:10] that was god
[1:56:12] and you know what it encouraged me to
[1:56:13] say lord you haven't left me you're
[1:56:15] still with me
[1:56:17] he can keep from a young man you don't
[1:56:19] have to go out into the world you don't
[1:56:21] have to live in sin you can be a
[1:56:23] christian from a young man
[1:56:26] to whatever time god calls you home
[1:56:28] i'm a testimony of that have i failed
[1:56:30] yes i failed have i done wrong yes i've
[1:56:32] done wrong but he's kept me
[1:56:35] and i appreciate that i don't have uh
[1:56:38] regrets and say i wish i'd never gone
[1:56:40] that way i wish i'd never done that
[1:56:42] before
[1:56:43] but i thank the lord that he's kept us
[1:56:46] amen he is more than able more than able
[1:56:50] i believe that was everybody did i miss
[1:56:52] somebody that maybe had something that
[1:56:54] they wanted to share
[1:56:58] or should i pick on somebody that i
[1:57:00] think should have something to share
[1:57:03] i'll be nice and know so
[1:57:05] brother bobby i know you you have
[1:57:07] something to share so
[1:57:12] hi i thought you were just saying hi to
[1:57:14] dad
[1:57:15] so
[1:57:16] would you
[1:57:18] want to come up and share that
[1:57:25] i
[1:57:26] i meet
[1:57:27] young
[1:57:28] young couples with young children and we
[1:57:30] talked to him the other day i was
[1:57:31] walking out a store and there was a
[1:57:32] young man with two little boys
[1:57:35] and i i was how old are they oh he's
[1:57:37] three and four and i said oh my grandson
[1:57:39] my my granddaughter is this ager so
[1:57:42] here's a microphone here if you want
[1:57:44] okay
[1:57:46] and uh
[1:57:48] and they say
[1:57:50] they say oh he's three he's four and i
[1:57:52] thought the young lady with him was his
[1:57:53] daughter because she looked quite young
[1:57:55] herself
[1:57:56] and i said well you know i have six
[1:57:58] daughters
[1:57:59] and boy that's an attention grabber
[1:58:01] immediately really really like how did
[1:58:04] you manage that you know
[1:58:06] or
[1:58:07] how did that happen to you you know
[1:58:09] and i said but my youngest is already
[1:58:11] this age and they go my
[1:58:14] and his wife turns around and she looks
[1:58:15] 12 or 13 years old
[1:58:17] and she goes
[1:58:19] you must have been quite young when you
[1:58:21] had children
[1:58:23] i said and they say you were about 12.
[1:58:26] and i said no we waited till we're legal
[1:58:28] age i was 13.
[1:58:31] get a laugh on it but you know what it
[1:58:33] opens the door and i get to share a
[1:58:35] testimony to them
[1:58:37] how god has kept us
[1:58:38] or they'll see me with my children and
[1:58:40] they'll ask me on this side
[1:58:43] why are your girls like that and i said
[1:58:45] because they love the lord jesus and the
[1:58:47] lordly jesus loves them
[1:58:49] and it'll bring the question so
[1:58:51] thank you i'm not singing i'm just
[1:58:53] hiding behind piano
[1:58:55] um i wasn't going to
[1:58:57] say anything but i have a testimony and
[1:58:59] it's very important to testify
[1:59:02] so uh forgive me if i'm scattered
[1:59:04] i
[1:59:06] a few weeks ago when brother tim cross
[1:59:07] was here i
[1:59:09] went up i wasn't planning to be prayed
[1:59:12] for anything
[1:59:13] but something had been bothering me for
[1:59:16] maybe six months i don't even know how
[1:59:17] it lasted that long it was just this
[1:59:19] little voice in my head
[1:59:22] and it's one of those things that you
[1:59:24] don't realize how bad it is until you're
[1:59:25] out of it and looking back it was six
[1:59:28] months battling
[1:59:30] daily
[1:59:31] of this voice telling me
[1:59:35] that
[1:59:36] i was a vessel of dishonor
[1:59:40] and
[1:59:42] and you know and satan tries to put
[1:59:44] those thoughts in your head right and as
[1:59:46] christians we know
[1:59:47] cast it out cast it out and somehow i'd
[1:59:50] let this become so embedded and rooted
[1:59:52] in me
[1:59:53] that
[1:59:55] that night when
[1:59:56] um like we called for prayer i was like
[1:59:59] you know what tonight's the night like
[2:00:01] i'm done with this
[2:00:03] and
[2:00:04] i went up and i got prayed for and
[2:00:06] brother reggie and brother tim prayed
[2:00:08] for me and i i told him in this it's
[2:00:10] just all spilling out like i'm like i
[2:00:12] realize every day
[2:00:13] every almost every moment every day just
[2:00:16] these voices
[2:00:17] saying you're judas you're pretending
[2:00:20] you're
[2:00:22] you know there's vessels of honor and
[2:00:24] dishonor and you've been made a vessel
[2:00:25] and dishonored
[2:00:27] and someday you'll
[2:00:28] he'll fail and you're just gonna
[2:00:31] you know it's gonna manifest who you are
[2:00:35] and i'm like
[2:00:36] i have received the holy ghost i
[2:00:38] received it at the altar right there
[2:00:41] you know
[2:00:43] sometimes i'll i'll go back to that spot
[2:00:45] just to remind myself this is where
[2:00:48] this is my pathel this is my rock this
[2:00:50] is
[2:00:51] that the spot is special to me
[2:00:54] and uh
[2:00:55] so i'm like i know i'm you know but it
[2:00:58] got to the point it sounds so ridiculous
[2:00:59] but i was like lord
[2:01:01] if you chose to make me a vessel as
[2:01:02] honor i'll be the i'll be what you want
[2:01:04] me to be like how can i be that but that
[2:01:09] i went up to get prayed for and they
[2:01:11] prayed for me
[2:01:12] and i woke up the next morning and my
[2:01:14] head was clear
[2:01:15] and i didn't realize how much
[2:01:18] all that wait
[2:01:19] six months
[2:01:21] or maybe roughly
[2:01:23] just this pressure that i didn't even
[2:01:24] realize they're just over like you're
[2:01:27] not you're not it you're just playing
[2:01:28] you're just
[2:01:29] and that night i was delivered i woke up
[2:01:31] the next day
[2:01:32] nothing like my head was clear and
[2:01:35] like thank you lord and like just how
[2:01:37] small it started just these thoughts
[2:01:39] over and over
[2:01:41] and then i was delivered that night and
[2:01:43] i realized and it's so ridiculous you're
[2:01:44] just like
[2:01:45] and then brother ready told me you know
[2:01:47] that the devil's only telling you that
[2:01:48] because you're a child of god and i know
[2:01:50] that but just how much he had just
[2:01:53] gotten into my head
[2:01:54] but from that moment on not even
[2:01:57] it i call it out i know what it is and
[2:01:59] it's not bothering me is it so i just
[2:02:01] wanted to thank the lord for that
[2:02:07] [Applause]
[2:02:13] reminds me when
[2:02:15] i asked the lord
[2:02:16] after that song got stuck in my head and
[2:02:18] i just couldn't get it out
[2:02:21] i said lord what can you how can you
[2:02:22] help me
[2:02:23] and that song that says
[2:02:28] now i forgot him
[2:02:32] think about his love
[2:02:34] think about his goodness just begin to
[2:02:36] sing just begin to sing and you know
[2:02:39] what
[2:02:40] those other sounds were gone that's all
[2:02:42] and it works any time something comes at
[2:02:44] me i said no think about his love and i
[2:02:47] just began to sing it and sing that
[2:02:52] think about his love

[2:04:45] that
[2:04:47] at that time
[2:04:49] i just turned to ask you to start
[2:04:51] playing a song but someone said now
[2:04:52] let's pray for her
[2:04:55] there was a sister who had been sick for
[2:04:57] a few few weeks
[2:05:00] and she had come up not knowing why we
[2:05:02] were praying for you
[2:05:04] but in praying for you she received your
[2:05:06] healing right there too
[2:05:10] sister martha we love you and your

[2:05:19] god and they live you and your family
[2:05:21] [Music]
[2:05:32] well the first testimony service that i
[2:05:34] was in
[2:05:36] was in tucson tabernacle about 50 some
[2:05:38] years ago
[2:05:40] it was
[2:05:42] wednesday evening
[2:05:43] i believe it was december
[2:05:46] my brother green was young pastor
[2:05:49] and brother green was here that night i
[2:05:51] mean brother branham was there that
[2:05:52] night
[2:05:54] and brother green says i'd like a
[2:05:55] testimony
[2:05:56] and brother branham shot up like that he
[2:05:58] was about to
[2:05:59] come right in the middle there and he
[2:06:01] shot him he said i want to be the first
[2:06:02] i always want to be the first to give a
[2:06:04] testimony about the lord
[2:06:05] and he shocked brother greene and
[2:06:06] brother green jumped back when brother
[2:06:08] green did when brother branham did that
[2:06:12] uh
[2:06:17] i don't want to be anybody
[2:06:20] but i was around brother branham
[2:06:23] quite a bit
[2:06:25] when i was younger
[2:06:27] he lived a block and a half from our
[2:06:28] house where we lived
[2:06:30] on tyndall down where he lived in park
[2:06:35] and i don't want to be anybody i'm just
[2:06:36] going to tell you my testimony
[2:06:39] where i come from and
[2:06:42] uh
[2:06:44] i was in brother brown blast meeting in
[2:06:46] tucson tabernacle union
[2:06:50] and i was probably the last one to see
[2:06:51] him before he left that first trip i
[2:06:54] took a bag of lemons over to him
[2:06:56] because kids all like lemons
[2:06:59] if you know the apartments probably
[2:07:01] don't you probably don't know the
[2:07:02] apartments but there's
[2:07:03] there's two sides one side was the
[2:07:06] where the family lived and brother
[2:07:07] branham and sister brown lived on the
[2:07:09] other side the bedroom was there and
[2:07:10] that's where his office was
[2:07:13] and it was christmas
[2:07:16] and we got bibles that year
[2:07:23] brother brahms sidelined
[2:07:26] 524 st john st john
[2:07:31] and he signed their bible to other kids
[2:07:34] but
[2:07:39] he told me i had polio
[2:07:42] when i was younger
[2:07:44] 13 months
[2:07:46] so i've been hurting all my life it's
[2:07:47] not a big deal don't don't ever hold
[2:07:49] that if you guessed me
[2:07:51] because this brother brandon told me
[2:07:53] we were going fishing one time with him
[2:07:55] with my uncle gene norman
[2:07:57] on the patagonia
[2:07:59] and my brother said ask him
[2:08:02] so we were riding it was 6th avenue and
[2:08:04] speedway
[2:08:06] and he said bobby there's a reason you
[2:08:08] had polio to slow you down
[2:08:11] because otherwise you would slow down
[2:08:13] you would not slow down
[2:08:16] and he's right
[2:08:18] because when my leg hurts i got to slow
[2:08:20] down but he was
[2:08:24] and he said you have a calling in your
[2:08:25] life down the road
[2:08:28] and i'm not a minister
[2:08:31] i'm not a preacher
[2:08:33] i can't even i can't sing i can't do
[2:08:35] nothing so i don't know
[2:08:37] but the lord's been very good to me and
[2:08:38] my family
[2:08:40] uh
[2:08:42] the other thing
[2:08:44] my
[2:08:46] i've got a lot of history
[2:08:48] with different things through the life
[2:08:50] with brother branham
[2:08:52] i was riding my bike on a saturday
[2:08:54] morning with brother joseph him and i
[2:08:55] were good we're good still good friends
[2:08:58] to this day
[2:09:01] and uh
[2:09:03] he if you see that picture
[2:09:05] where brandon brother random has the
[2:09:06] heads where he went coming back from
[2:09:08] hunting
[2:09:09] he was out in front there just got him
[2:09:10] in and he said come here boys i want to
[2:09:12] show you something
[2:09:13] my uncle gene brought over the
[2:09:15] the magazine
[2:09:17] and showed the hofmann head of christ or
[2:09:19] the the picture on the mirror and he
[2:09:20] said i'll show you and he turned it like
[2:09:22] that and showed us how it was
[2:09:24] now that that's a memory to me i can
[2:09:26] still remember as a saturday morning
[2:09:29] that brother branham showed us that
[2:09:31] now if you don't think that if you don't
[2:09:32] think that you i'm 13 years old and i
[2:09:34] still i still think like it was a
[2:09:36] beautiful day it was he called us over
[2:09:39] he said boys i want to show you
[2:09:40] something
[2:09:42] that still touches me to this day
[2:09:46] but uh you know but he was a humble man
[2:09:48] brother branham was very humble
[2:09:50] he was very good to my family and he
[2:09:52] called my dad little
[2:09:54] little donny
[2:09:56] my dad was six three six four
[2:09:58] hands
[2:09:59] double the size of mine
[2:10:02] and uh
[2:10:03] calling the quickening power
[2:10:06] that was my dad and us our family
[2:10:09] but i got a quote i want to read you
[2:10:12] that i sent out to the brothers the
[2:10:13] other day
[2:10:15] that a brother sent me
[2:10:19] and this is how i look i look at
[2:10:20] everything happen for a reason i'm just
[2:10:22] going to tell you that's the way i
[2:10:23] believe because brother brown said
[2:10:24] that's the reason i had polio there's a
[2:10:26] reason for it and i believe that and
[2:10:28] somebody says how can you believe that
[2:10:29] when i lost my son
[2:10:33] i said there's a reason
[2:10:34] he said how in the world can you say
[2:10:36] that
[2:10:37] how can you say that
[2:10:39] and i said everything i don't care what
[2:10:42] it is it don't matter there's a reason
[2:10:44] for everything
[2:10:46] and this is i got a quote the other day
[2:10:48] on this i said brother aaron
[2:10:51] and a man take a butt and this is what
[2:10:53] it says
[2:10:54] and the main thing above everything is
[2:10:56] to keep the church in harmony
[2:10:58] and in love of god and moving on
[2:11:01] if we can be if we all can believe that
[2:11:03] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us
[2:11:05] from all sin and unrighteousness if the
[2:11:08] woman sitting next to you or the man
[2:11:10] sitting next to you
[2:11:12] if he doesn't believe that jesus will
[2:11:14] come actually come visible again
[2:11:16] let's just agree and go right ahead
[2:11:18] anyhow we don't agree with him on the
[2:11:20] scripture but let's make the church move
[2:11:22] on for harmony because in there there's
[2:11:25] going to be a catch some more people but
[2:11:27] when the church is out of harmony
[2:11:29] out of harmony
[2:11:31] not in agreement
[2:11:33] then you hurt the church
[2:11:36] and you can hurt the cause
[2:11:38] you it's just or just you can't do it
[2:11:40] but when we can't agree upon one thing
[2:11:43] with that the blood of jesus christ
[2:11:45] cleanses us from all sins
[2:11:47] and that's what i call about harmony i'm
[2:11:49] just telling you
[2:11:50] i don't care where you go to church or
[2:11:52] how you do this
[2:11:53] but just go to church and if you can't
[2:11:55] shake the brother's hand
[2:11:56] we're in trouble
[2:11:58] or sister i'm just telling you we're in
[2:12:00] trouble
[2:12:02] i'm just telling you right from my heart
[2:12:04] and that's the way i believe i might
[2:12:06] have some enemies but i don't care i
[2:12:07] love them anyway
[2:12:09] and
[2:12:10] but i just wanted to let you know a
[2:12:11] little few things like that
[2:12:13] and uh
[2:12:16] i thank god for all he's done for me and
[2:12:17] with harmony and everything has brought
[2:12:19] up
[2:12:21] we've got some good friends out of it
[2:12:22] wouldn't you see brother aaron i mean
[2:12:24] like a big family

[2:12:31] telling me a testimony with the one
[2:12:32] little girl that lived with this house

[2:12:35] but i mean it's just little things like
[2:12:37] that and everything matches and it's
