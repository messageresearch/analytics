with [Music] Thanksgiving I'll be a [Music] living Sanctuary for you amen how many wants to prepare you this morning to me it's not just a song it's not just lyrics written it's by cry to the Lord this morning Lord whatever it takes to get me ready whatever it takes to to prepare me Lord would you do it this morning Lord I I just I don't want to play games anymore I don't want to mess around I just want to be surrendered to him I want to be prepared by him how many feel the same this morning how many feels like they just need the Lord to just come in and do just a little bit more preparation this morning [Music] you know I think that's what he wants to see I think he wants to see believers who not just believe him but need him and I think that's the god that we serve this morning and I just appreciated I just appreciate the spirit here this morning the spirit with the people and the music and just the direction that God takes and you know it's just at this point I think we could say it's it's been good to be in the house of the Lord amen you you know to come into His presence like maybe I just walked out the door and just felt the presence from the worship of the people and there's there's there's healing like we just saying in that presence there's Deliverance just in the presence of God um you can be free you can not only be free but he can take you up just a little higher than where you're at right now if we really just surrender to him this morning I I just ask would would you want to do that this morning yes would you want to just be taken a little bit higher by him to a place maybe you've never been before and and I I want to ask you something maybe just a little bit different this morning would you would you just do me a favor would you if you have a need if you have just something that's on your heart maybe it's for yourself maybe it's Deliverance maybe it's healing maybe it's it's for a little more of God maybe it's not for you maybe it's for someone else maybe your family member somebody that you have in your mind and I know we all have needs we all have things and sometimes we put them to the side and we go on with our day but we feel them there we hear them we it affects us when we try to go to sleep I I would ask that you would just have that need before you this morning whatever that might be for you just hold it in your heart hold it in your mind and just put it right before you this morning because we serve a God Amen who can meet that need this morning and I don't want you and I don't want to walk out of this building still holding on to a need that's unfulfilled and I believe we serve a god I believe he's real he's just as real today as the Bible that I read him about him he's he's that same God today and if you have something and you put it before the Lord I believe he wants to do that for you and I believe he wants it more than you want it I believe he's just waiting for us this morning to take our need even though he knows it and to say Lord here's what I have need of this morning and Lord not tomorrow but I need it today amen it's life and death I need it today Lord and watch him come on the scene this morning I want to read the scripture real quick and then I'll let you be seated it's Psalms 46 it says God is our refuge and strength how many's found him to be your Refuge yes how many has had no strength and somehow God got you through yes it wasn't wasn't your strength that did it right when you were the weakest is when he came along God is our refuge and strength and he's a very present help in trouble amen let's just bow our heads Lord we want to just surrender to you fully this morning Lord not just have Lord Another Sunday morning service it's good Lord that we gather together Lord it's good that we sit we sing Lord we hear somebody speak but Lord can this just be a different service this morning Lord Lord could there be someone Lord that's just so desperate for you this morning that Lord they could come back to this day and say that was the day the Lord did something for me that was the day the Lord made a difference in my life that was the day I had a need on my heart that only he knew and only he could fulfill and he did it for me that day Lord may it be just different than another Sunday in and Sunday out service Lord May there be a stake driven down in the ground today Lord by somebody in here Lord by some believer who is Lord despite our weakness and our failures not afraid to take you out your word Lord would you just come and Lord speak to us this morning set aside all of our thoughts our distractions Lord maybe before church and after set those aside Lord Lord the the incompetence Lord of myself Lord as a speaker set that to the side Lord would you just come and speak lip to ear to your people this morning in Jesus name amen you may be seated and I just want to say it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning it's good to be with you here in Tucson this morning I talked just briefly with brother Dan yesterday over text and he said to make sure that I greeted the people there for him isn't it good that uh the Lord allows you know sometimes our our leaders get a little bit tired isn't it good that the Lord allows them to get a little bit of rest I pray that he comes back invigorated refilled energized and it's good that there's a church that is still here Sunday morning when the pastor's not here amen amen it's a good thing I'm sure he uh I don't know if he's going to watch it but I'm sure it'll be good for him to look out and see the Believers that that aren't coming because brother Dan's here they're coming because they need something from the Lord you're coming because you you're coming because you want to be here I hope amen and and and I I I wasn't real sure what to speak on this morning but um we're just going to surrender to the Lord and and and surrender our thoughts and our hearts to the Lord and and I really do pray that you would keep your need before you this morning and if you're somebody that doesn't have needs first of all I I'll be a little bit envious of you I'll admit but if you don't have a need for yourself certainly you know somebody that has a need of something and if you could just keep them before you this morning I want to just approach a subject that's well you've if you've heard me before it's real simple it doesn't get very complicated brother Aaron I don't know the the how to to preach a a deep and complicated message I just know the simple word of God and I just like to talk to you about that this morning there's a scripture I was going to have you turn to a scripture but if we could maybe without the the slides or maybe without our bibles if we could just say this scripture I I think I learned this back in Sunday School uh how many knows the scripture Hebrews 138 okay without looking at it without opening your Bibles maybe let's not put on the screen probably the most preached message and brother brandom's uh messages Hebrews 138 would you just say that with me this morning Jesus Christ the same go ahead one more time Jesus Christ amen amen that's the truth that's the truth it's not just us reciting scripture it's a truth but I I'd like to talk to you about now I I it was a little bit of a trick I tricked you just a little bit I want to talk to you about the most forgotten word in the Bible and it's in Hebrews 138 and if you turn to it you may say brother you're just like grasping at straws for a message but I believe every single word in the Bible is relevant I don't believe that God just put words in there to put words in there it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever and when I say it and I think almost every time I've heard brother brandom say it he says it's exactly like we just said it a minute ago so I'm not saying this wrong I'm just saying there's significance to this word and I I I know you might be thinking it's just a word what difference does it make but I think it makes a huge difference in the scripture because it's in there for a reason in fact it's it's in there and I'm not an English teacher uh if there's any in here you'll probably be ashamed of my English but I know that's not even how you form a sentence the way we say it was the right way Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's how it should be grammatically correct and yet the Bible puts another word in there it says and today and I I believe that the that it's that way because it's trying to draw our attention to what that scripture is trying to say it's trying to draw our attention to uh something about the scriptures different than just the way we would just say it and and I want to read you something that brother brandom says throughout all the message if you wanted to go look it up maybe you look up the words looking forward and as soon as I start to tell you this if you if you're at all familiar with the message you you'll know what I'm going to say because brother Ram says it many many times says man is always praising God for what he has done and looking forward for what he will do and ignoring what he's doing come on and this is tied directly to Hebrews 138 that's and now I want you to just listen he say I think that's the condition our church is getting into God shook every gift that he promised in the Bible have we not seen every gift in this Bible come to pass now if you haven't seen every gift let's stop right there and I want you to know that that God has brought every gift that's in this Bible to pass whether it be here locally in the church whether it be in a in in a Ministry maybe in another church maybe it be in the ministry of William brandham but God has brought every single gift in this Bible to pass and it's not just I I got news maybe you know this but it's not just for yesterday you know the god of William brandom is the god of today I I know that's big news right everybody knows that but sometimes we sometimes I act as though the god of William brandom is the god of yesterday and I forget that he exists today and the same exact thing he did back then he'll do today and brother says God shook every gift he promised in the Bible before us and we still stare into space anybody ever done that in church yeah I'm not going to say anybody's doing it now but and we still stare into space as we're looking for something else you ever come to church with a need on your heart and you leave with that same need unfulfilled and sometimes you don't even remember what was said in that service you just what what was it just staring into space dwelling on the problem or thinking about tomorrow or thinking about work or thinking about stress he says it's seems to be a spiritual condition of the church that they fail to see the hour that they're living they're looking for some sensation or something way off in the future man is forever doing that he always blesses God for what he has done looking forward for what he will do and ignoring what he is doing you fail to see the hour that we're living in and this scripture that God is the same yesterday and and today and forever to me draws attention to what he is doing today and and and I know this is just it's just about a basic as it gets but just if you just stay with me this morning brother M says this that's as good as the devil wants them to be now you could say Okay I I misunderstood the scripture maybe I didn't read it that way but I'm going to be good now but I want let's just take it another level deeper that the devil has he has a strategy yeah amen anybody ever come across his strategy he has a plan to try to get you away from God okay here's his strategy it's not my words it's the words of the prophet he says that's as good as the devil wants them to be very religious Scholars and Educators watch what the devil's strategy is you would think the devil's strategy to tell you God's not real but that's not his strategy well that that he's a good God but you know he doesn't care about you that's that's not his strategy why because we've come a little bit farther than that right maybe the devil would try that and we would say I I know that God's real so he's going to he's going to update his strategy here's his strategy coming from a prophet says he'll prove to you what he has done he's talking about God now and prove what God is going to do and have you ignore what he's is doing so Satan will come to you and tell you yes that is the god you serve that's the god you serve see what he did back there you know I always thought about this uh anybody ever hear Brother random say so much about the days of Miracles are passed right days of Miracles passed I never brother Aaron ever heard anybody in my life say the days of Miracles are passed so I thought okay well that maybe that was a battle that was going on back then but really what Satan is doing is saying that the days of Miracles listen to me now that the god that you serve that has done what he's done in the Bible is for yesterday yes it was true yes I can't prove to you that that those thoughts were not discerned that those people that they weren't healed that they weren't delivered I can't prove to you that but as long as he can get you to say that was the god of yesterday he's got you wow he's got you he can't maybe prove to you that God's Not A Healer but if he could just say you know what that was great back then when God healed you and get you to ignore what God is doing today or if he can say you know what you just keep praying you keep praying and you know what one day God will bring you that Deliverance I'm so tired of that devil that is a devil that is saying that you say oh no we need to be patient I I'll have a quote for you that says you can have you can have patience you can have all these things and yet the devil can still tell you that tomorrow is when you'll be delivered that tomorrow is what is when you'll get what you need God is a good god he's a faithful God he'll deliver you he'll heal you as long as you can just wait for him to do it and that's not what God says God says call upon my name call upon my name and I a very present help in time of trouble a very present help is not tomorrow it's not yesterday it's right now and this it doesn't get more simple than this but I think sometimes we forget these things because I I I know I forget them because sometimes I just let the devil tell me that God is a good god and that God will lead me God will deliver me and God is trying to do it right now and I put it off for tomorrow on it says in Matthew take therefore no thought for the tomorrow this is right out of the scripture you could say I don't know I need to think about tomorrow Matthew says do not think about tomorrow for the tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself looking to yesterday and I think it's perfectly fine I think it's perfectly fine to read our Bible this is this is a book of things that happened yesterday that happened in our past when I put on a tape or I listen to a I listen to a message or I read a message it's talking about things that happened yesterday and I think that's perfectly fine to go back in the word and see what happened yesterday but if you doing that to just view what happened yesterday you've lost the point of why we have a Bible you've lost the point of why God allowed a messenger to be recorded onto tapes and onto CDs and whatever it might be he didn't do that so you could you could just read about a god of history and say well that was a great God I wish I was in those prayer lines that same God that was in those prayer lines is present before you today and and and and he doesn't need to have I'm going to tell you this he doesn't need to have a prayer line to do exactly the same thing that he's done that's the God that I serve I don't I don't know what the god you serve is but the God that I serve doesn't need to have a prayer line he could just with the Bible says with his finger cast out the devil you could have a a a need on your heart and not ever voice and God could say I hear you and I'm going to give you what you have need of and I know this not from reading about it I know it from experience I know it the few times I I'm not preaching to you something that I've I I've conquered I'm preaching to you something that I struggle with is to take a God out of history and make him a present day God and the few times that I have done it the few times I've surrendered my thoughts he has come on the scene and he's done exactly the same same thing that he's done in the Bible it it's not just the god of William brandham it's my God it's it should be your God a lot of times looking to the Past though what happens Satan can he always wants us to try to look at the past to look at and to distract us from what's going on today he'll make you look to the past I don't know maybe this doesn't apply to you but it applies to me and it applies to a lot of people I've spoken to he'll make you look to the past to yesterday and look at all the hurt that you've gone through now maybe somebody hurt you maybe your mom hurt you maybe your father hurt you maybe a a close friend hurt you maybe a church hurt you and and and heaven forbid but it happens maybe even somebody in the name of the message hurt you wow does it happen amen I I know I know I'm speaking to real people I know I'm speaking to people that go through this have gone through this and will go through this that's what he wants you to focus onow carry the hurt over and when you're so hurt you can't see the god of today and and the hurt is real the hurt is real it's not made up he's not reminding you of some fake thing that you didn't feel no the hurt's real the Betrayal is real and you can't see God today because your heart and your mind and your focus and your feelings are all on things that happened yesterday maybe it's a life that God pulled you out of anybody been pulled out of a life Amen brother somebody been pulled out of a life right here right there and he'll remind you of that life that you've been pulled out That's what Satan does remind you oh you haven't really been pulled out of that life I know what I'm talking about this morning that's what he does you haven't really been pulled out of that life you are still that same person what do he do and he's keeping your heart in yesterday to try to get you to ignore and not see what God is wanting to do for you today and he's quick and he's good at what he does and as soon as something happens anybody anybody make a mistake there should be some amens right all right amen anybody make a mistake the moment you make one where does s Satan take you back he takes you back oh you made a mistake and you said you were delivered you said you were through that you said you were past that you said you gave that over to God the moment you fall he does that why he's trying to take you back to yesterday and he'll tell you oh that's that's the god of yesterday well maybe you just didn't pray to that God CU he's a good God the problem must be with you and he's trying to get your focus off of today wow and look at yesterday why are we still allowing him to do this to take us to the past to take us to a god that certainly was a good god yesterday but if he can keep our minds there if he keep our Focus there and and and keep us in the hurt that happened to us and I want to tell you this not planning to say this but maybe the hurt is still there because you haven't forgiven somebody and so Satan takes you back to a hurt that still lives in you that's a real hurt because that hasn't been made right yet and you know God will take that same opportunity to say oh yeah you know why that hurt is still there because you haven't forgiven somebody I I know this the I know it's the truth because I've lived it I've held on to things I've held on to hurts I want to tell you this morning I there was a certain situation I won't go into details there was a situation where I was 100% wronged you know sometimes you but sometimes you can go I was like I was like 5050 right nobody's nobody's ever been there 5050 I know there's some married couples in here come on now well that fight was about 60% my wife and 40% me so you know she needs I this is just truth right she needs to come and apologize first you don't have to say Amen but it's the truth sometimes right right and and if somebody isn't married don't worry you'll get there and and and sometimes we do that even and I'm just trying I'm not trying to make light of our problems but you know sometimes we just get an attitude of well that person has never come to me and made it right and as soon as they do I'll forgive them who's carrying around the hurt they aren't they aren't carrying around the hurt you are and from something that someone else might have done to you and no forgiveness happening you will fail to see a god of today that's just really what it boils down to you will not be able to see you might feel good in service I'm not saying that I'm not saying you won't feel his presence but I'm talking about a God who makes changes to you I'm talking about a Difference Maker that's who I'm talking about that is the kind of God that will say well I saw so and so being blessed and I saw this and I heard about this meeting over here where this is happening why isn't that happening in my life and you can't let go of the past because you can't let go of the hurt and I want to tell you that there are this this this situation that I was in I was sitting there trying to study I might have told you this testimony but I'll I'll just tell you again I was sitting there trying to study on a Sunday afternoon and and H it was like it was just like I was hitting a wall and this this hurt that somebody had hurt me was like years and years passed and the Lord brought it up right before me right when I was sitting there like Lord why can't why can't I why won't you open your Bible to me why is this just like a a blank slate you everybody feel like that when you prayed amen amen it's real you ever feel like your your your prayers just go and bounce right off the sky and come right back down and sometimes you don't even want to pray anymore because that feeling is a good feeling Lord why aren't you hearing me and then the Lord brought up right before me brought up oh there's a situation you have to make right and right before the Lord I said Lord that person has not apologized to me I was I was wronged and the Lord spoke to me as clear as day in my heart he said you have something to make right and right then it was one of the hardest things I've ever done I picked up the phone and I called this person I said hey we had a conversation a few years ago and they remembered it and you know you said this and it I'm just being real with you this morning I hope it's okay uh I didn't plan on telling you this but I told in my heart you know what I wanted to say you hurt me and I responded this way because then I could let that person know I was still hurt and it was like the words were not permitted to come out of my mouth to say that I said I said this to you and I shouldn't have said that and I'm sorry would you forgive me me and they said yes I forgive you and I'm just I'm being I'm being real in my heart I thought okay brother Aaron now they're going to make right what they did I've opened up the communication I made that first step I made the really hard step of saying I'm sorry when I really didn't think I did anything but the Lord revealed to me I had this is the opportunity now for them to say sorry and they said okay thank you have a good day and that was it and I I left there I just was looking at the phone like wait a minute that was that was the moment of healing that was the moment of reconciliation that was the moment that the Lord was going to make this thing right it still to this day has never been made right but I have a peace that I didn't have before I have an Avenue to the Lord that I didn't have before maybe that person will never come and say you know what but you know what I have from my heart forgiven them am I've forgiven them in fact I'm to the point where I don't I don't care if they ever say sorry for it because I've genuinely from my heart forgiven it and that took years years and years and years and I'm telling you I tell you that one testimony because it's the good one but for that one there's probably five other ones where I'm still holding on to stuff no really I I I I struggle sometimes to just wow you know Lord help me forgive that person you can't you can't fake it you can't fake forgiving somebody you can't do it you can't Bluff anybody tried to do that and then that person comes in and you you you know that thing and your heart Rises up right you know that little thing that comes up and it's like oh there they are Lord I've forgiven them but you you haven't right if you can't go up to them like they're your brother or your sister and talk to them and hug them you you haven't forgiven them and and I wonder if that little thing which is actually a big thing keeps you in the past and you were probably undoubtedly undoubtedly you were wronged but you have to let it go it's hindering not that person it's hindering you I heard it saying that that that bitterness which is what that causes is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die and it's true it's it's the the the unforgiveness doesn't poison them it poisons you and it's in and it's it's I would you if you have something like that would you let it go this morning I know you can't just go okay I'll let it go I know it takes some I know it takes some heart cleaning out but would you be willing to do that this morning on it's hard it's hard and and I want to tell you that God is a present help which means you can't really do that but if you if you ask God God would you go with me I got to make a phone call right now God would you be with me in that phone call you know he'll be there with you another thing I I I just don't really know where to go but another thing that Satan does for for you know we have a lot of new Christians we have a lot of Christians that have been in Christians maybe for a couple years we have a lot of people that have been Christians a long time I don't want to put years to it but there's some people been been I I I grew up in the message I haven't been a Christian my whole life because I didn't give my heart to the Lord but I grew up in this message and a and and another thing Satan likes to do he likes to take those those Warriors those those veterans the people that have been around for a while and he likes to keep you in the past where your experience happened because no doubt you've had an experience with the Lord no doubt you've had an experience with the Lord no doubt you can say this day I gave my heart to the Lord and this day he filled me with his Holy Ghost and if Satan can just keep you in that day you miss what's going on today if he can just keep your mind in your experience with God he's not going to try to tell you you didn't have an experience with God he can't he can't because you have something inside that says no no I had an experience so what he'll try to do is he'll just try to take that you're filling with the Holy Ghost that happened at a place in the past and that was a good God just concentrate on that and miss out on a filling of the Holy Ghost today yeah you can get quiet but it's but it's exactly what he does I raise my hand 10 years you know sometimes a preacher will come or or the pastor will come and you know anybody want to raise their hands and I found that the people who rais their hands the least are the people that have been in the message the longest that's what I found not all the time not with every single one but I found that the most I I would say I'm you know what I can put myself in that crowd would that be okay I I've been I I think I've been a a Believer for a long time the hardest people to get to get a response out of are the people that have been there the longest oh it's not about a response brother once you mature in the word you come on now that's not even that's not the Bible that we that's not the Bible and that's not the message we got to take all of the message yes there are quotes that say you know it's not about sensation it's not about jumping it's not about shouting right but you can't just take those quotes and then throw away the other ones that says when the Holy Spirit comes through the building and if it passes over you and there's no response if you can't stand up he says you're dead you can't raise your hand he says you're dead oh you can't tell me I'm dead I've had an experience yes but you're still back in the past when that experience happened and not and not today in an everpresent God who says that was great I did that for you but I want to do something new for you today I want to make you a new Christian I don't care if you've been a Christian 10 years 20 years 30 years I want to do something new for you today and he is not only wanting to do that he's here to do it wow he's not coming he's here why because we've invited him we've made him welcome he's here you feel his presence and then leave in fact you can't leave the same way sometimes we leave worse because we don't let him come in and make a change are you still eating off the Mana from yesterday that's a question for for maybe those of us have been around are you still living off the experience of yesterday are you still are you still trying to eat what the Lord did for you in a day gone past or has he done it for you new this morning or do you know all the word do you know all the word and it's just so hard to hear anything I I I'm just going to say this I might not make friends but this is the truth I know because I battle this are is it so hard to hear something new that you're like oh I never heard heard that before or do we just know it allow do we just know it all oh I heard a message preach like this 10 years ago yeah but what if it's the Lord today saying I need to bring into remembrance something to your mind because you're living in the past or you're living in the future and I'm a present God today who wants to do something for you today has your experience started to dry up oh that doesn't happen to me brother it happened to David David killed Goliath slew Goliath as a as a teenager became king with stood Saul defeated armies and got to a point in his life he said Lord renew my heart Lord I've lost the joy of the Salvation that you gave me so long ago restored unto me Lord David and here I think I'm exempt from it here I think I'm so special sometimes that I can't lose sight not of What the Lord Has Done I lose sight of what he's doing thinking about what he did does that make sense I lose sight of what he's doing today this morning right now because I'm thinking about oh you did this for me back then the church at Ephesus we want talk about we want to talk about maybe you say you know what I I I'm I'm into deeper things than this brother the church at Ephesus this is in the message now Paul took them into the deep things of the word he says I took that church I I I could preach to that church things I could never preach to the Corinthians amen that's what William Bram said he says oh Paul taught them things they he he couldn't teach those things to the Corinthian Church but he taught it to the Ephesus Church he brought them so deep into the word he says but there was a problem he says the Ephesus Church in fact God says I have something against you because you left or lost your first love and what was that first love he says that first love was a present day giving control to the Holy Ghost that's what it was it what what love did they they they knew about God they knew about the word they knew about deep things but they lost the ability to give God what was happening today instead they had control of it they had control over uh I'm just going to preach now how long the service should go oh how long the minister oh he's been over he's been 46 minutes oh we've sang eight songs and still seven songs I've heard this from I've heard this from people so I know it's true so much control over the service that God has none and not doing it out of maliciousness or bad intent oh we're doing exactly what's in the word yes but maybe God wants to do something for you today that you will have to set aside not the word but your thoughts of the the word your way of doing what the word says and and if you can't do that I wonder if we've left our first love of giving Over Control I'm I'm tell you right now I'm a I am a control freak we don't have any of those right amen I see I saw a couple hands of some honest people I got to have control over things it is so hard for me to surrender control it just is and God needs the control and then I wonder sometimes why I'm not being uh delivered why I'm not getting uh not just saying it getting what I what I'm praying for because sometimes God doesn't give you what you pray for and it's for your benefit but sometimes I don't feel him I don't see him working in my life and here I am with all the control in my hand Lord you need to come I've prayed I've done this I have all the control and God just saying I just want you to let go of that and watch me show up let go of control watch me show up don't worry about how long it's been don't look at your watch and I'm not going to be too much longer but but but but just a routine we have a routine well I'm going to go to church this day and this other day I'm going to go to church and then Monday turns into I got to think about work and I it's it's a routine and somewhere in that God is lost well I I didn't receive him today but you know what church is Wednesday May I'll get him Church there's a a refilling of the the Holy Ghost Monday and Tuesday and Thursday and Friday and Saturday when there are no church days there's a God who wants to refill you those days too because it's so easy to just put God off into the future or put him into the past oh that was a great service how many went to the C me I know there's a couple people went to the camp meetings last weekend couple of the sisters it's I'm still rejoicing from those camp meetings but if I have the mentality that whoa I got to go to one of can't mean to get the Lord I've missed the point of the Lord I've missed it all right we got to have a special speaker come and speak for us we got to have some weekend meetings no we do not you don't even have to go to church you could sit down with them in your house in your car I don't care where you at and he can be an everpresent help at that moment as long as amen that's what he does as long as you're not a go thinking of oh God what you did last time and those meetings was so great yes but what about today he's that same exact today oh we got meetings coming up in a week I'm just making up a date you may not have meetings but oh we got these meetings come I'm going to get such a feeling God said I'm here right now to fill you right now right but the devil's trick is to get us to put him into tomorrow or put him into yesterday he says this in the Ephesian Church agus says there's something I've got against you and that is you've left your first love you've left that love that you you once had for those good oldfashioned Holy Ghost meetings and you begin to kind of slide backwards into that formal and he says nonsense I got a long quote I'm going to read it if it's okay I'll try to go through he says see they lost their first love that's what's the matter with the first church too formal they can't say Amen no more oh I said it from my heart brother yeah but sometimes God just wants to hear you if you'll Surrender Your will and accept his will it's not about shouting amen that doesn't make you a better Christian but if you're not doing it because you're in control there's a problem oh my goodness it breaks some of the makeup up see they don't have it no more that's Pentecost they never had it to begin with he says I'm talking about Pentecost it's sickening brother but we want a birth out of this thing got to bring death before you can have a birth see it's the truth if God had that against that church he'll have it against this one too oh it's good to read the Bible oh man that was Ephesus right oh the Ephesus that's putting God in the past that we got to read that as though that's us we have to read it as though it's a current day this to me is not a history book this is not a history book although it talks about things thaten happened before me this is a this is literally a blueprint of what's going on with me today the good and the bad watch this he says you left your first love I've got it against you I have something against you that's my complaint this is he's saying this is what God Said you once had a great time but you let the world begin to creep in and you started acting a little formal it's funny how he says that we start acting formal because we let the world creep in when I think sometimes we start acting formal because we think we're in control we think it's proper we think it's the right thing to do we think it's respectful we think it's reverent and he says you're formal because you let the world creep in and acting a little formal you still holding my hand watch this you're still holding my hand and I'm not saying this to anybody who's saying that you're you've forgotten God you've turned your back on God watch what he says you're still holding my name and you're still doing the things that's right that makes you feel good you've got a lot of patience and so forth and you labor but you're like a mule you labor and you work see my my you've left Grace faith and power and swapped it for labor and works well I tell you brother brandom I help every widow woman I can well that's a good thing I commend you for that but where's that first love you used to have mhm he says where's that that Joy you used to have as David once cried oh Lord restore to me the joy of my salvation where is them all night prayer meetings on and tears on your cheeks my goodness the Bible's even Dusty and got cobwebs on it you read old love stories and news and things and you might say oh I don't I don't I don't even have any of those books on on right you don't have to have a book on your shelf about a love story or news right right here you put it right in your hand yeah come on on I don't have time to read my Bible I'm preaching to myself now I don't have time to pray now if you're not swiping like that that's probably a good thing but but if you know what I'm talking about you know what I'm talking about you read old love stories and news and things and things that oughtn't even to be allowed published put out for a trash can and we Pentecostal people he put himself in that we Pentecostal people pick them up and just Loft over them like a bunch of flies on a garbage can what we need is to get back to our first love a love and a hunger for God of today that's what it is it's it's not that you've lost your love for God it's that you lost you I'm not telling you what you've lost now but if you struggle with this if you if you see what I'm talking about I think we've love we've lost our love for him today it it it takes a desperation a a desperation that says God if you don't come right now I won't make it till tomorrow tomorrow doesn't matter because I won't live to see tomorrow unless you come right now and watch God honor Faith like that we've lost sight of them though we've taken control of the church service with our ideas of how it should go we we've talked about this um and if you hear this and you say and you believe me and you say okay I've done that I want to give God preeminence I I don't want to I don't want to do that then you're going to face the next tactic of the devil you might have gotten over one you're going to face the next one and that is let the Holy Spirit have control of you starting tomorrow that's what the devil will do you know what that's a good thing you're trying to do that's a beautiful thing you're trying to do you're going to give God control that's good he's a good god let's start that tomorrow you want to start having prayer in your house start that tomorrow anybody ever I know you have but I I I just it came to me recently anybody ever been talking with somebody and somebody says you know I just really need prayer for this and you say I'll pray for you anybody you know what I'll pray for you and how many has forgotten to pray for that person I I I wonder if I could just challenge myself and challenge you this morning if you're talking to somebody and you know they need prayer or they ask you for prayer why don't you pray right then with them why do we have to say you know what I'll pray for you I I've been on the phone with somebody and it was the it was one of the best things ever done to me I just said you know you know what pray for me brother I I I I'm I'm battling this I'm going through this and here's what I expected him to say say all right I'll pray for you no problem he says well let's just pray right now over the phone and you know the Lord's delivered me of that battle I was going through right then on the phone because somebody not me but somebody else refused to put God into later on today or tomorrow or the next day they said no he's he's not a god of those things he's a God today right now let tomorrow take care of itself and if you want change if you want to give control over to the Holy Spirit maybe you've been keeping it don't wait till tomorrow to do it that's the next tactic of the devil oh that's a good thing that the the Pharisees and the Jews we know this they were looking for a messiah but they were looking ahead for him to come and he was right there with him and they missed out on him not because they weren't looking for him they weren't looking for him today it's not enough to believe that the the problem isn't looking forward it's looking forward and placing the things that God has for you in tomorrow and that's why I said maybe keep that need before you today oh God will you know what I believe he'll give me this I believe he'll do this that's okay but what about today what about changing the way that we think about uh God wants to do these things for you more than you want them how many want how many want a fresh not yesterday's Mana a fresh anointing of the Holy Ghost then God is here to do that for you today maybe there's somebody who doesn't want that that's fine but if you want it and you surrender and you don't put it off till tomorrow he'll do that for you today he says this you can talk of the comfort of Christ give ones and say that a comfort he will give in the ages to come and you can refuse the comfort that he has for you right now see it's on the same basis that we find that it'll become a great thing he says that's even become in Pentecost in the churches it's become into our Realms that they're always promising something that they never get to it's always every fellow has a different sensation and whether it's scripture or not and they're promising something that they never go get until it seems like they get to a place where there doesn't seem to be any sincerity the people don't get down to the real kernel of sincerity the very English word of sincerity has lost its value to the people and I I just want to say this I don't know what you've heard but I I I lost the value of sincerity because I listen to Somebody preach only part of the message and the part of the message that they picked out is where brother Braham says oh you can be sincere and been sincerely lost and go to hell and what was it was used for it was used to preach against sincerity because this particular person struggled with sincerity and I listened to it and for years and years I thought oh being sincere is okay but but you can be sincere and be lost and go to hell that was what was plugged plugged into my mind and what I lost was sincerity yeah and sincerity is the ability to take God and make him a god of today because you can't be you can't be sincere about tomorrow and you can't be sincere about yesterday sincerity comes from right now if somebody's talking to you you know whether being sincere or not because you know if they're really really present in what they're saying to you if they really believe what they're telling you right then you can sense sincerity from somebody but if if if they sound like oh yeah you know what you're you'll be healed no you'll be okay you'll be healed that doesn't sound very sincere right because they're putting God off into the future but if somebody says you know what I know what you're going through let's stop what we're doing right now and I'm going to kneel down with you and we're going to pray right now and I won't get up and you won't get up until God comes right now that's sincerity and you know what that gets res results it's not just about faith he says it's about being sincere with your faith and Faith the Bible says calls those things which are not which means it takes things that are in the future they haven't happened yet let's just list off some of them I I don't want to be cliche but let's list off some of the one healing Deliverance Holy Ghost those things that the devil would like to put into the future faith calls those things and says that they are it takes things that are not because they will be down the road oh I'm going to get that Deliverance down the road I believe for my healing down the road but faith says no that's now that's what real Faith does it takes things that that are not and says they are present tense faith is not satisfied that God will bring something to pass one day faith is only satisfied when it calls the things that God has for you into a present day situation and it connects you Faith connects you to a god of tomorrow and makes him an everpresent God of today and I I think and if he can just the devil can just get you to believe that God will heal you tomorrow he's one I don't I hope you can catch that if he can just get you to believe that he'll deliver you tomorrow he's got you how many wants the Holy Ghost if he can get you to believe that the Holy Ghost will come to you tomorrow or the next service or when you get good enough or when you get cleaned up or when the right preacher comes or when the right atmosphere is here he's one because God has the Holy Ghost according to this word for you today in your present condition he has the Holy Ghost for you today I do not I I do not want to be caught looking forward to a Rapture come on now if you're looking forward to a Rapture you won't realize it when it comes and and I want to be seeking I want to be expecting a Rapture today today because if we're really doing that if we expect and desire and want a Rapture I'm just going to say this a lot of people don't want a Rapture today and we know why because we're not ready is that the truth or no maybe if you don't want a Rapture today it might be because you're not ready for it but if you're seeking one expecting one today then your life will fall in line to be ready for a Rapture today as long as we can put it off for tomorrow I believe we live in the last days I believe we live in the last days it's according to the word but today could be the last day and how many times have we heard that over the years all the time right and one day it will be the last day there will be no tomorrow for me to prepare to be ready to go into a Rapture it will be gone and I will have missed it and the Bible says it comes as a thief in the night if you're not looking for it to happen today if you're not expecting it today if God is a good god who will Rapture you tomorrow you will miss the Rapture that's blunt but that's the truth he says man is always giving God praise for what he did do always looking forward to what he do and ignoring what he is doing that's the way they miss it they look back and see the great thing that he has done but they fail to see what a simple thing he used to do it with and then they look forward and see a great thing coming that's going to happen and nine times out of 10 it's already happening around them that's not my word that's his word god hiding himself in Simplicity revealing himself in the same 63 nine times out of 10 it's already happening right around them and it's so simple that they don't know it you might say it's not that simple uh the word of God tells us differently it is simple but we complicate it we make it mysterious we make it a thing and you know why I think we do this I I'm not telling you we're bad people I'm just telling you it's a nature that we have to fight you know why we make it complicated and we make it mysterious because then we can put it off to another day this is something so great that I hope one day to attain it you see what the devil has caused us to do to take the greatest thing and put it off for another day and God standing there with every Redemptive promise for you wanting to give you every single thing that he has in this Bible and might put them off until tomorrow is he a god of yesterday yes yes he's the same God that's that scripture he's the same God is he a god of tomorrow yes I'm not telling you he's not those things but he's a god of right now and I I don't want to be convinced any longer by a whisper in my ear that the thing that I desire is good just wait for it it's good that you want that now just wait for it I'll close with this he says in this he says brother brandom and God will you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you you say he puts this in quotations and I I I had to laugh at it when I heard it because I think I've literally said this in prayer he says well I hate to bother you so much father anybody ever feel like they prayed to God a little bit and asking for too much or or Lord I'm so sorry to come to you again and ask for forgiveness I know you just forgave me I I know I told you that I wouldn't do it and here I am again asking forgiveness again for the same exact thing and devil will tell you oh again well he already forgave you for that I think you're you're good to go take you to a god of the past you know what he's a good God just do well re you know do well and he'll forgive you down the road well I hate to bother you so much father he wants to be bothered that way that's brother brandom's words he does don't ever think that you could ever ask too much of God I believe the scripture said you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our Joys would be full he wants you to ask abundantly he says ask for big things don't limit your faith to some listen now do we believe in faith the size of a mustard seed Faith the size of a mustard seed the Bible says can move mountains that will do you no good if you think about oh eventually that Mountain's going to move no I'm looking for a mountain to move today he says don't limit your faith to some little Mustard Seed get on out here to some other kind of faith and move out in big things big things is just as easy to receive as little things and big things for God are just as easy to do as little things why because he's the same God you just have to believe that's all and you've got to have faith and know exactly how to use it and it'll be all right you can put it right to work don't put it to work tomorrow put it right to work and it'll be just fine could you imagine talking about God exhausting God's love and power and benefits for you could you imagine a little bitty fish about that long way out here in the middle of the ocean say now wait a minute I better consider this thing I better drink of this water sparingly cuz I might run out someday a little fish about that big in the middle of the ocean out there well that could easily be done more easy than you could ask too much of god wow he's the inexhaustable Fountain of Life whatever you have need of ask him and believe it he provided it in the Redemptive blessings when he died at Calvary and gave a promise to you for everything you have need of while you're in the journey and it's yours how many could say that it's mine it's mine when is it yours now now right now don't don't let that devil sneak in oh that's yours that's yours wait till the Lord brings that to you right now amen I I I just want anybody in here have a need before you you have a need before you that you listen so desperately that you can't live another day unless that comes to pass do you have that need I see there's hands I see a few hands you know that the it's the same God of this Bible that you believe in the same God of of brother brandham is the same God here to do the same exact Works what does it take it takes somebody to take them as a present day God take him out of history and take him to today and let's just bow our heads if we could and I just want to ask if you have I don't care what the need is I it doesn't matter what it is it could be for a family it could be for deliverance it could be for healing it could be it could be for the Holy Ghost right now in your present condition you say Lord I want you to come inside and I want you to live if you could raise your hand and put that knee before him do not wait for tomorrow don't say Lord I I I believe that you'll do this for me tell them Lord I'm desperate and I need I need you now I need you right now Lord I

Lord I would just pray you see every single hand that's in here Lord Lord they've not been they've not been Lord convinced to raise their hand by some man Lord but I believe it's your Holy Spirit drawing them to you lord lord I I I've heard in your message Lord that even to raise our hand first Lord you would have to be there drawing us Lord Lord we never have sought you one time Lord but you've you've sought us Lord Lord I pray you would see a hand I see you pray you see a heart behind that hand Lord and a need maybe maybe Lord that heart that person behind that hand maybe this morning they had that need and they were they had put it off Lord believing that one day you'll do it for them but Lord I believe your word can change our minds it can change our hearts it can change our Focus Lord to our present day [Music] God I pray you would not let them lose that Lord if you have your hand up hold on to that don't be satisfied with just raising your hand don't be satisfied with a god of tomorrow be satisfied by him today let him come in let him touch you let him give you what you want Lord you see that heart you see that brother that sister Lord with her hand up you see the need Lord may your spirit just go to them right now now I see you working Lord I see your I see your deliverance Lord I see you to a tenderhearted person Lord I see you working this is not a this

do and I don't want to ignore this morning what you're doing right now Lord now I pray there would be testimonies from today Lord testimonies about a stake driven down into the ground today Lord maybe somebody who thought there's no way he can change that about me and Lord you come to this morning and you change that Lord if there needs to be a release if there needs to be a release of forgiveness Lord I pray you give them the strength to do it this morning right now Lord in their hearts Lord maybe a physical manifestation later on maybe a conversation later on but Lord in the heart of somebody who's holding back forgiveness right now Lord would you just cause their heart to say Lord I I release that I let that go I let that hurt go like you did for me Lord you forgave Lord I pray that you would get all the honor and the glory Lord Lord I pray you just speak to these Hearts this morning Lord may you just give them a peace Lord a peace that passes all understanding Lord a peace that

delivered us out of Egypt Lord Lord you'll continue to deliver us but Lord I need a touch from you today Lord I need something from you today Lord right now I'm not I'm not satisfied my faith is not satisfied waiting for a filling down the road Lord I want your Holy Ghost right [Music] now Lord if there's someone that's sick and they're just tired of being sick Lord would you deliver them now Lord addictions are nothing for you Lord why would there's no reason to wait to be delivered you can be delivered right [Music] now Lord I don't want to be in a hurry Lord I don't want to rush you I

me into tomorrow do what you want with me Lord but today Lord I Want A Closer Walk with You Lord [Music] amen just keep them before you this [Music] morning I'm not trying to work up emotions that that won't work make you feel good for a while but I know there's a God here that can make real change I know that if you're desperate if you're in a life and death situation he he'll show up right now he'll show up right now and give to you what you have need of he'll show up right now and change what needs to be changed he'll take out cut out what needs to be cut out and he'll heal what needs to be healed that's the god that we serve he's not he's the same God the same God that you've read about that you've heard about that you love that you trust in the future but he's right here today and I just want to know if you if you can just surrender to him Surrender Your will surrender control control and watch him take control I believe I believe there's sincere hearts that are doing that at this [Music] moment let's just stay with our heads bowed if you could [Music] I want pray of [Music] course ha in me a [Music] clean oh God and renew a right Spirit Within [Music] create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me Pass Me Not away from your presence oh Lord take not your Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy Jo of your salvation and renew a right SP cast me not away and cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of th salvation and renew our right SP Within Me [Music] would you share the testimonies of the two healings that you shared with us last night is a present day God I think there was some here at that camp they could witness to some of these you can continue playing s Lou we had a meeting last week there in Ohio they had a prayer line and uh the first I think uh those that that were there know there was a young man that that was uh they were kind of wrestling messing around and broke his ankle fractured it in two places just completely bent over his ankle sideways and this happened Thursday or Wednesday night or Thursday morning and they took him to the hospital sure enough scan show broken put him in a cast he was for 2 three days just walking around um with crutches we had a prayer line Saturday night and it's it's it's not it's not because there's any Minister there or any certain person there it's because God was there and it's because there was an expectation of people that Lord I need you right now and that young man went through that prayer line and he got to the end of the prayer line and he sat down and he took his cast off and he started jumping up and down he started walking around and for the rest of that week and never never even limped God literally healed a bone like that that's a God that's a God that I serve I think that's the god that you serve and the other one is is personal to me and is uh my daughter and she gave this testimony Wednesday night at our church but my daughter had had a she had a cyst on her hand a a a large painful lump for about five months on her hand and we had taken to the doctor and the doctor said you know you're going to have to have an operation it's it's it's hardened it's it's calcified I can't just take this liquid out of there you have to go in for more scans and you have to schedule a surgery my daughter went through that same prayer line she tell me she's like I didn't think about the pain in my hand she's like I've lived with it for four five six months it's it hurts it hurts to the touch she's like I never even thought about it she came through the prayer line and Something Told her look down at your hand and she looked down and it was completely gone [Applause] there was no bruise there was no blemish there was you couldn't even tell where it was at before and I was a witness on Friday I saw it because she came up to me and said it was just it was in pain more than normal I saw it on Friday and Saturday it was gone and she said I never even went through the prayer line with that on my mind and and I just told her that's the benefits of being a child of God that even things that you don't ask for even maybe even something you don't even know that you need not only will he answer your prayers he'll give you on top of that and originally she didn't you know she was a little hesitant maybe to go through the prayer line but she gave control to God she gave control to him and just said I'm going to I'm going to go get hands laid on we believe in it and that's what God did for her and that's the God that I serve today and I know he's just as real today as he is a week ago as he was then in that meeting as he was 50 years ago in brother bram's meetings I I I I if I didn't believe that I couldn't get up here and I couldn't talk to you if I don't believe that same God and I know you do too let's just keep them before us today I know you believe in the same God I do let's not be tricked into putting it off till tomorrow that's all I'm saying let's not be tricked in just God you were good yesterday you're going to be good tomorrow but I need you today amen those are those two testimonies I told them last night I hope that's okay to share [Music] [Applause] so he's the same yesterday today and forever I never looked at that and today it's easy to look at the god of the past and think of the god of the future I'm not guaranteed tomorrow I have today that's right let him be present today I know if I say raise your hand if you have a need there'd be very few hands that wouldn't get raised oh brother the need is so small it's still in need if you can believe [Music] stand you've already done something to claim that promise that's right if you can believe God to touch you right now raise both hands and see if God won't won't begin and you know what the thing to do is begin to thank him yes that's right you've already done it that's right it was already taken care of by his stripes you were healed he's not saying hold on I've got to go see if I still have the remedy it's already been done amen you can have what you have need of if you can believe it's already done done it's already done the Battle Is Over the victory is one it's already done one more time it's already done it's already done the Battle Is Over the victory is won and it's already done and and I'll give him praise yes I'll give him [Music] praise the Battle Is Over the victory is one it's already done maybe for some of you this is the first time and you're wondering can I believe and sometimes just being able to be prayed for somebody to reach out and touch you makes a [Music] difference I believe I know God is the same yesterday today and forever I ask brother Ryan if if you needed prayer he would pray for you and I'm going to ask brother Jordan come on up brother Ryan would you just come here and if you need and and I'm not going to ask for the brothers just to pray a a 10-minute prayer over them but just come through the line and say Lord I believe and let our brothers just lay their hands on you and receive what you have need of today just
