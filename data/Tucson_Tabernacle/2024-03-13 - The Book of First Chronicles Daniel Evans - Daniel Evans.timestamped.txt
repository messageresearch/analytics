[32:52] Jonathan if we could just hear that when
[32:54] we cross over it it would mean just we
[32:58] could say well Lord my life was worth
[33:02] living um I
[33:04] announced I think it was last Wednesday
[33:06] that to uh think about these first books
[33:10] of the Bible that we've gone through
[33:11] from
[33:12] Genesis all the way now and we're
[33:15] starting in the
[33:16] Chronicles and when we F finish 2
[33:19] Chronicles I'd like to answer some
[33:22] questions if you have any questions
[33:24] about anything from as long as it's
[33:27] start in Genesis and and goes through 2
[33:30] Chronicles and you'll see today that 2
[33:32] Chronicles covers a whole lot of ground
[33:36] actually over 3,000 years of ground so
[33:40] if you have any questions about any of
[33:42] the sermons that brother Lyle and I have
[33:46] brought
[33:47] forth um write them down and give them
[33:50] to to us and we'll have a questions and
[33:52] answers session on the Bible I mentioned
[33:53] last time I said just not like any
[33:56] doctrinal questions I didn't mean I mean
[33:58] the whole Bible's doctrinal I I
[34:00] shouldn't have said that what I meant
[34:02] was let's not talk about um the things
[34:04] like the seven Thunders and the Seven
[34:06] Seals been revealed and all that let's
[34:08] let's just keep it to what we've gone
[34:10] through in the first part of our Bible
[34:13] study clear I'm I'm looking forward to
[34:17] that actually I think I've got brother
[34:19] ly got some good ones for
[34:21] you so so uh let's make sure that we
[34:25] have we have some questions um I'm
[34:28] looking I'm going to look forward to
[34:29] that service I think it'll be a lot of
[34:31] fun um so now we are in this book of
[34:36] First
[34:38] Chronicles and you can kind of get an
[34:41] understanding of the book just by the
[34:44] title The the book of Chronicles now the
[34:47] original when it was written it was
[34:49] written in one book but it was really
[34:51] long so they split it into first and
[34:54] second chronicles the the book of
[34:57] Chronicles it's like a it's like a a
[35:00] newspaper or it's it's something that
[35:03] has set things in order and and brought
[35:07] forth a history and that's where the
[35:09] book uh gets its name and you'll see why
[35:13] it's named that it's very very aptly
[35:15] named in um the book of Chronicles um
[35:19] there are writing styles that you can
[35:22] see throughout the whole Bible you can
[35:26] see in from
[35:29] Genesis through Deuteronomy you can see
[35:32] a very very distinct writing style from
[35:36] the prophet Moses and that goes on and
[35:39] you'll see here in 1 Chronicles it also
[35:43] has a very very distinct style now it
[35:46] doesn't say who the author is but this
[35:50] author was you can tell he's a very
[35:52] educated person he was It was obviously
[35:55] written by a historian as you're going
[35:58] to see and this this man had really a
[36:02] Divine
[36:03] interpretation of the word and it's it's
[36:07] something that isn't really present in 1
[36:09] and 2
[36:11] Samuel this
[36:14] author most Scholars think it was Ezra
[36:19] The Scribe and Ezra we're not to Ezra
[36:22] yet but Ezra is the man who led the
[36:25] rebuilding of the walls around Jerusalem
[36:27] and rebuilding of of the the temple area
[36:30] there he was a scribe and he was a
[36:33] priest and he was a a just a great
[36:36] leader and it's written
[36:39] also after the return of the Babylonian
[36:43] exile so you know what the Babylonian
[36:46] exile is we're not there yet but that's
[36:48] when Nebuchadnezzar comes in so we have
[36:52] we have if you remember what we've gone
[36:54] through we have now we have two
[36:55] different countries
[36:58] we have Israel in the north we have
[36:59] Judah in the South Israel in the north
[37:02] is is invaded by the syrians they're
[37:05] dispersed all over the place that was
[37:07] pretty much the end of of that country's
[37:10] Rule and then you go down to the South
[37:14] and Judah lasted like I think it was 400
[37:16] years longer than Israel did and Judah
[37:21] in turn later on Nebuchadnezzar came in
[37:24] from Babylon he attacked and conquered
[37:27] Judah took all of the the most
[37:31] prosperous and the most promising young
[37:34] people out brought them back home to
[37:37] Babylon and that is called the Captivity
[37:41] or the Exile this book was written after
[37:46] that so so that goes on and then the uh
[37:50] the king then the the Persians
[37:52] invade um Babylon Nebuchadnezzar's
[37:56] family they out
[37:58] and this King Cyrus allows the um Jews
[38:03] to go back home and that's where
[38:05] zerubabel and Nehemiah and Ezra and all
[38:09] of them them come into play and this
[38:11] it's it's just a it's a wonderful story
[38:14] this book was written after they go back
[38:18] home to Jerusalem we know that because
[38:22] the
[38:23] genealogies the um the first nine
[38:26] chapters
[38:28] of First Chronicles are
[38:31] genealogies and they cover about 3,000
[38:36] years and then chapters 10 through 29 10
[38:40] through the end they cover about 30
[38:43] years and that is just about King
[38:46] David and you'll see the author when
[38:50] he's talking about David he leaves out
[38:54] most of the negative things most most of
[38:57] the negative stories about David he
[38:59] leaves out Saul chasing David all all
[39:02] around the Wilderness he leaves out the
[39:04] adulterous Affair that David has with
[39:07] basba he leaves out David killing
[39:11] Uriah and he leaves out the story of
[39:14] absolum and his Rebellion all of that is
[39:20] left out and it's just replaced with
[39:23] almost primarily the good stuff about
[39:26] David and it's WR like that for a
[39:28] reason shows that David's a man after
[39:31] God's Own Heart and 1 Chronicles really
[39:34] brings that out and it's very important
[39:38] that something that's present in 1
[39:41] Chronicles when we get to the end that's
[39:43] not present in 2 Samuel is David calls
[39:47] for Solomon and gives him directions on
[39:50] how to build the first temple and these
[39:55] directions are amazingly in depth and
[39:58] precise so we'll we'll get to that here
[40:01] coming so again I'm going to go through
[40:04] 3,000 years of history with Ezra's
[40:06] genealogy and there's when we start with
[40:10] 1 First Chronicles I think it's Ezra
[40:12] that's I'm going to assume it's Ezra
[40:14] there's no introduction there's no claim
[40:17] of authorship it just goes right into
[40:20] the
[40:21] genealogy so let's turn to uh 1
[40:25] Chronicles chapter 1 and watch how this
[40:35] begins 1 Chronicles chapter
[40:39] 1
[40:41] Adam
[40:43] Seth
[40:44] enosh
[40:46] now the first born to Adam so we're
[40:50] starting right at the beginning here
[40:52] we're starting right at right at Adam
[40:54] and Eve the firstborn son
[40:58] here remember is
[41:00] Cain but notice that Cain is not listed
[41:03] in anywhere in the lineage of Adam
[41:06] anywhere in the bible really and it's
[41:09] not
[41:11] listed because he didn't have children
[41:14] oh and then and then it goes
[41:16] from Adam you have Adam and um Abel and
[41:20] Abel's not listen in the genealogy
[41:22] because Abel didn't have any children
[41:24] before he was murdered by Cain
[41:27] so the lineage comes through
[41:31] Seth so let's go brother Jeremy I'm
[41:33] sorry I'm going to take you back to
[41:35] Genesis chapter 5 and then I promise
[41:38] after that we'll stay in 1 Chronicles
[41:41] but I want to I want to show how 1
[41:43] Chronicles and Genesis chapter 5 how how
[41:47] they mirror each other it says here
[41:49] Genesis 51 it says this is the book of
[41:52] the generations of Adam in the day that
[41:54] God created man in the likeness of
[41:58] God made he him male and female created
[42:01] he them and blessed them and called
[42:04] their name Adam in the day when they
[42:07] were created and Adam lived 130 years
[42:11] and begat a son in his own
[42:14] likeness and after his image and called
[42:18] his name Seth image and likeness are
[42:21] pretty definitive that this child is
[42:23] from Adam it doesn't say that about Cain
[42:26] and in the days of Adam after he had
[42:29] begotten Seth were 800 years and he
[42:31] begat Sons and Daughters all the days
[42:34] that Adam lived were 930 years and he
[42:37] died and Seth lived 105 years and begat
[42:41] enus we can go back to uh 1 Chronicles
[42:44] chapter 1 so the narrative from the
[42:46] author Moses goes on in that genealogy
[42:50] it goes on to Abraham in the Book of
[42:52] Genesis and then pass that and then back
[42:56] to
[42:58] it goes through Abraham and then Abraham
[43:00] we got Isaac and Isaac Jacob and then
[43:03] the 12 Patriarchs so that is what is
[43:07] going to be explained here in 1
[43:10] Chronicles in great
[43:12] depth we're not going to read it all I
[43:15] promise so verse two let's just get a
[43:18] feeling of how this book
[43:20] starts Kenan
[43:24] Mahalo Jared hoch
[43:27] Methuselah lamech Noah Shem ham and
[43:33] japeth now instead of just Noah the
[43:35] Arthur records his three sons and he
[43:37] Chronicles these three sons of Noah now
[43:40] this isn't in the Book of Genesis here
[43:43] in 1 Chronicles he is going to tell us
[43:45] where that all of these sons of Noah
[43:49] ended up and their
[43:51] lineage the sons of japeth Goomer and
[43:54] Magog and midi and DAV and tubal and
[43:59] mesik and Tyrus and the sons of goer
[44:03] ainaz and Rath and toar and
[44:09] toara and the sons of Javin Elisha and
[44:13] Tarsus and kidum and dodanim the sons of
[44:18] ham Kush and misam and put and Canan the
[44:22] sons of kush siba and havala and sabta
[44:26] and Rama and SAA and the sons of Rama
[44:30] Sheba and danan and Kush begat Nimrod
[44:35] and he began to be Mighty on the earth
[44:37] now this man Nimrod he is usually
[44:39] credited he's from the lineage of ham
[44:42] and he's usually credited with building
[44:44] the Tower of Babel and the Bible doesn't
[44:48] directly say that he built it but he was
[44:50] the leader of that time and most
[44:52] theologians think that that was in fact
[44:54] Nimrod that built that now let's skip to
[44:56] verse 17
[44:59] I'm laying a foundation here the sons of
[45:01] Shem Elum and Asher and arfad and ludd
[45:06] and Aram and O and hul and gether and
[45:10] meach let's skip to verse
[45:15] 26
[45:16] serg nahor terara Abram the same as
[45:24] Abraham the sons of Abraham Isaac
[45:27] and ishmail now the author goes through
[45:29] the generations not just of Isaac but of
[45:32] also of ishmail who was born from
[45:34] Sarah's slave and also he also goes
[45:36] through the children born to coutura the
[45:39] woman that Abraham married after Sarah
[45:43] died so in Chronicles coutura is not
[45:47] basically he's not she's not listed as
[45:48] his wife she's listed as his
[45:51] concubine we skip to verse 40
[45:55] 34 and then we'll follow the line of
[45:57] Abraham and
[45:59] Sarah and Abraham begat Isaac the sons
[46:03] of Isaac Esau and Israel again another
[46:07] lineage that's not mentioned very much
[46:10] and that's the lineage of Esau usually
[46:12] we just go to Isaac and Jacob but the
[46:14] sons of Isaac Esau and Israel and notice
[46:18] that the author lists Jacob's name his
[46:20] change name which is Israel and not
[46:24] Isaac remember he wrestled with the
[46:26] angel Angel and didn't and and he fought
[46:29] him all night and then the angel blessed
[46:31] him and changed his name to Israel it
[46:34] also list the as I said list the lineage
[46:37] of Esau which again is rare now I said
[46:41] that because it goes through all of
[46:44] these different genealogies all the way
[46:48] through chapter nine let's read um 1
[46:52] Chronicles
[46:53] 9:1 so all Israel were reckoned by gen
[46:57] ologies and behold they were written in
[46:58] the book of kings of the Kings of Israel
[47:01] and Judah which we just went through who
[47:05] were carried away to Babylon for their
[47:10] transgression so why is it so important
[47:14] that this author would take all of that
[47:18] time and all of that space to record all
[47:21] of these
[47:22] genealogies and we might think well we
[47:25] might think more on a spirit spiritual
[47:27] sense but if you put
[47:31] yourself back in Israel back in Judah at
[47:35] this time imagine if you wanted to be a
[47:39] priest you would have to be able to
[47:42] prove that you're from the tribe of Levi
[47:45] so you have all of these different
[47:47] genealogies coming down so you would
[47:49] have to say well my dad is this my
[47:51] grandpa is this and then I am over here
[47:55] and and here is my great great grandpa
[47:57] right here in the lineage of
[48:00] Levi and it's written like that to be a
[48:05] useful tool for Israel for years to come
[48:10] all the way to this
[48:12] day and then also if you wanted to own
[48:15] land in
[48:17] Judah then you would need to prove your
[48:19] heritage remember the story of Boaz and
[48:21] Ruth and how he was a kinsman redeemer
[48:24] so you would use what but Ezra wrote
[48:28] here to prove that you were a rightful
[48:30] heir to this land or that you could buy
[48:32] land in this area and then probably the
[48:35] most important is the line of the
[48:39] Messiah and it comes through a certain
[48:43] line which do you know which line that
[48:45] is Judah Judah comes to the tribe of
[48:49] Judah the first words in the New
[48:51] Testament in Matthew they're a lineage
[48:54] from the tribe of Judah so these
[48:57] lineages are
[48:58] important and then when when so Matthew
[49:02] goes from Abraham all the way to Joseph
[49:06] Mary's
[49:07] husband and he may have used some of
[49:10] these lineages in his in Matthew's
[49:13] research so imagine if these these
[49:15] genealogies weren't recorded obviously
[49:18] as I said I'm not going to go through
[49:20] them because it's just its name after
[49:22] name after name and after name but you
[49:24] might think of what significance are
[49:27] these and I it's it's of tremendous
[49:31] value and tremendous
[49:33] significance so this book of 1
[49:37] Chronicles is kind of like a law book
[49:39] it's meant to be a reference quoted
[49:42] before by not only the priests but also
[49:44] the judges and and really in everyday
[49:48] life so it had to be perfectly accurate
[49:50] written by probably the greatest scribe
[49:54] that had ever
[49:55] lived
[49:57] and it's also important and and whether
[50:00] Ezra knew it or not he was inspired by
[50:04] God for this lineage of Jesus Christ so
[50:09] the author starts with Adam he goes
[50:11] through Noah and Abraham and Jacob he
[50:13] calls Israel all the 12 Patriarchs and
[50:15] their their lineage and all the way down
[50:17] through past the Babylonian captivity so
[50:21] that is our first nine chapters of First
[50:25] Chronicles
[50:27] there's no one sitting on the edge of
[50:29] their
[50:31] seat right now it's awesome though it
[50:35] really is good and it ties in a lot of
[50:40] things and you can look at the different
[50:42] names it's like oh well that name
[50:43] doesn't match and and you re you
[50:45] research these different things and it's
[50:47] like oh enosh oh that's Enoch or um
[50:50] sheth oh that's
[50:52] Seth so then we get to 1 Chronicles 10
[50:57] and I'm not saying it's more exciting
[50:59] now
[51:01] but it's it is more exciting
[51:04] now maybe not as useful but more more
[51:07] very very much more exciting so we see
[51:10] the end of King Saul in 1 Chronicles 10
[51:13] and we see the beginning now of King
[51:15] David and it tells the same story as the
[51:18] end of 1 Samuel where Saul Falls kills
[51:21] himself he falls on his own Sword and
[51:23] the Philistines desecrate his body and
[51:25] then some Valiant men they bravely go
[51:28] and they recover the bodies of Saul and
[51:30] his sons and they bring them back and
[51:33] bury them but watch this the writer and
[51:36] you can see how this writer is a gifted
[51:39] man of God and there's little things
[51:41] like this that are in 1 Chronicles that
[51:44] aren't necessarily present in the other
[51:46] books 1 Chronicles 10: 13 watch how this
[51:52] author interprets what happened it's a
[51:56] very simple
[51:57] statement but he says this so Saul died
[52:01] for his
[52:03] transgression which he committed against
[52:04] the Lord even against the word of the
[52:07] Lord which he kept not and also for
[52:09] asking counsel of one that had a
[52:12] familiar Spirit to inquire of it and
[52:15] inquired not of the
[52:18] Lord therefore he slew him and turn the
[52:21] kingdom unto David the son of Jesse now
[52:26] you won't won't
[52:27] hear anything said like that about this
[52:31] King David and the
[52:33] reason is because this author whether he
[52:36] was knew it or whether it was just the
[52:39] Holy Spirit on him knew that this
[52:42] Messiah coming was going to be of the
[52:46] tribe of Judah was going to be the son
[52:49] of
[52:51] David and that comes right down through
[52:54] here with this book of Chronicles
[52:58] and the more prevalent theme is not that
[53:00] David ever made mistakes or David did
[53:01] anything wrong the more prevalent theme
[53:04] in this book of First Chronicles is that
[53:06] if you are on David's side then you're
[53:08] on God's side go to chapter
[53:12] 11 and it reads like this chapter 11
[53:15] verse one then all Israel gathered
[53:18] themselves unto to David unto Hein
[53:21] saying behold we are thy bone and thy
[53:24] flesh so before we go any further does
[53:27] everybody understand now it's Bible
[53:29] study does everybody understand that
[53:32] this book of First Chronicles and 2
[53:35] Chronicles is covers about the same
[53:39] information as 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and
[53:42] second
[53:43] Kings all right so it's not it's it
[53:47] repeats a lot of the
[53:49] stories but it's it's almost a shame
[53:52] sometime that it comes after 1 and 2
[53:55] Samuel 1 and second Second Kings because
[53:58] really this Chronicles is just
[54:00] absolutely incredible and people will
[54:02] read it's like oh I've already read this
[54:04] and then they might go on to the next
[54:06] book but it shouldn't be that way
[54:08] there's a whole lot this is rich rich
[54:13] book then all Israel gathered themselves
[54:15] to David unto Hein saying behold we are
[54:18] thy bone and thy flesh look at the love
[54:22] and the unity the people had with David
[54:25] the king
[54:27] and moreover in time passed even when
[54:29] Saul was King thou was he that lest out
[54:32] and broughtest in Israel NIV translation
[54:36] said that they LED Israel that David LED
[54:39] Israel on their military
[54:41] campaigns and the Lord thy God said unto
[54:44] thee Thou shalt Feed My People Israel so
[54:47] this is the people talking to David Thou
[54:49] shalt Feed My People Israel and thou
[54:51] shalt be a ruler Over My People Israel
[54:57] therefore came all the Elders of Israel
[54:59] under to the king in Hein and David made
[55:03] a covenant with them in Hein before the
[55:05] Lord and they anointed David King over
[55:08] Israel according to the word of the Lord
[55:11] by
[55:12] Samuel and David and all Israel went to
[55:15] Jerusalem which is jabus there the
[55:19] jebusites were the inhabitants of the
[55:22] land so they went to
[55:25] Jerusalem and and the inhabitants of
[55:27] jabus said to David Thou shalt not come
[55:30] hither nevertheless David took the
[55:33] castle of Zion which is the city of
[55:36] David as brother Lyall pointed out last
[55:38] week that the city of David is just
[55:41] outside of Jerusalem they're right there
[55:43] next to each
[55:45] other so David conquered this city
[55:50] Jerusalem and the author of This Book 1
[55:55] Chronicles tells us
[55:57] about and remember it's all about names
[56:00] here it's a reference book so the author
[56:04] tells us about these there's about 37 or
[56:07] so men that he describes as David's
[56:10] Mighty
[56:11] Men now there's
[56:14] three 1 Chronicles lists two 2 Samuel
[56:19] lists another one so we'll say that
[56:21] there are
[56:23] three these three
[56:26] were
[56:28] as the book says the mightiest of the
[56:32] mighties now there was one of these men
[56:37] that he went to battle against the
[56:39] Philistines and second and 1 Samuel says
[56:42] that that he killed 800
[56:45] men he was the chief among the Mighty
[56:48] Men because he commanded a troop of
[56:51] 24,000
[56:53] soldiers and then there was another of
[56:55] the three
[56:58] this mighty man stood for David when the
[57:01] Philistines tried to take a
[57:03] field
[57:05] and so he's
[57:08] there and the Philistines come and they
[57:10] invade the land and all the Israelites
[57:14] they all run away because remember the
[57:15] pH Philistines these big guys you know
[57:17] like Goliath these all the Israelites
[57:19] they run away so one of David's Mighty
[57:22] Men he stands up I believe his name is
[57:24] elaser and he stands he walks out into
[57:27] the middle of the field and he stands
[57:30] there and he pulls out his sword all of
[57:33] his army had run away and he says bring
[57:37] it
[57:38] on and he stands there with his sword
[57:42] and here comes all these Philistines and
[57:44] he just starts laying them down with
[57:47] this sword one after the other after
[57:50] they killing them until he got tired of
[57:53] swinging and his hand was cleaving to a
[57:56] sword and it was just one after the
[57:58] other and they're all dying and then all
[58:01] the Israelites they look and they're
[58:03] like oh wow the Philistines are all dead
[58:06] let's go
[58:08] back so so they go back and they start
[58:11] taking the spoil like taking all their
[58:13] gold and stuff all the dead people so
[58:15] that's the other mighty man so the third
[58:17] mighty man I believe his name is shama
[58:20] he does the same thing so there's this
[58:22] this field of
[58:23] lentils and here come the philis
[58:27] and he does the same thing he walks out
[58:30] there Israelites run away and he says
[58:33] bring it on and he does the same thing
[58:37] that Eleazar does just starts whacking
[58:39] and killing and and destroys all of the
[58:42] Philistines these Great Men great
[58:46] warriors of the
[58:48] Lord with David three his three most
[58:52] Mighty Men so these men David
[58:57] is out and
[59:00] he's losing not losing the battles but
[59:04] he's been he's up in the rocks and he's
[59:07] in this Cave of ailum the Philistines
[59:10] had invaded and the Philistines were
[59:12] winning and they had taken David's
[59:15] Hometown where he was born does anyone
[59:17] know where he was
[59:19] born he's
[59:21] this remember Jesus is the son of
[59:24] David Bethlehem
[59:27] so David's in this cave in
[59:30] ailum and he's just
[59:33] down I mean life is just not good for
[59:37] David and his men in the country and and
[59:41] David's
[59:42] hot and he probably I don't know there
[59:46] miles away he starts thinking of his
[59:50] upbringing and he starts thinking he's
[59:53] thirsty he starts thinking
[59:57] I would love to have a drink from this
[1:00:00] well that was by the gate of Bethlehem I
[1:00:04] used to go there when I was a kid and
[1:00:06] and drop the water and it was always so
[1:00:09] cold and just tasted so good and and he
[1:00:12] says I would just I just long to have a
[1:00:16] drink of that water well there was a
[1:00:19] Garrison of Philistines that had taken
[1:00:21] over Bethlehem and they were in charge
[1:00:24] of that there was no way that David
[1:00:26] could even go down there because he
[1:00:27] would have lost the battle so these
[1:00:29] three mighty men that I just mentioned
[1:00:31] they heard David say
[1:00:33] that I said all right now look at the
[1:00:36] Loyalty look at the love and look at The
[1:00:38] Bravery that these men had look at how
[1:00:41] the the unity of the people was so they
[1:00:45] hear David say that they say
[1:00:48] okay we'll do it so they sneak away from
[1:00:53] David David has no idea they they go
[1:00:56] down off the mountain they start
[1:00:59] battling the Philistines one after the
[1:01:02] other and they're fighting their way all
[1:01:03] the way to Bethlehem they get to that
[1:01:06] well that David mentioned at Bethlehem
[1:01:09] two probably stood guard fighting off
[1:01:12] the goliaths and everything else that
[1:01:14] was coming in thinking about how much
[1:01:16] they love their
[1:01:17] King draws up the bucket they take it
[1:01:22] and then they fight their way all the
[1:01:24] way back to to David and there's David
[1:01:28] still up in his cave still down and
[1:01:31] imagine how he felt they came before
[1:01:34] him they bring the bucket of water say
[1:01:39] King here's the water that you desired
[1:01:43] from your well where you were
[1:01:47] born David
[1:01:49] looks at that
[1:01:53] water
[1:01:54] and
[1:01:56] you saw that the men were probably
[1:02:00] bloody they had been
[1:02:02] fighting they had just battle they they
[1:02:04] put their whole lives in danger just to
[1:02:06] give this man David a
[1:02:08] drink and he said something on the order
[1:02:12] of he said you did that for
[1:02:16] me he said you spilled your own blood to
[1:02:21] just to get me a drink of water that I
[1:02:23] desired he said I'm not worthy of this
[1:02:28] look at the humility in David how much
[1:02:30] he wanted that but he he has this bucket
[1:02:33] he sees his buddies right here that risk
[1:02:35] their life they're bleeding they're
[1:02:37] tired and he takes it and he gives this
[1:02:42] water to the Lord doesn't even take a
[1:02:44] sip of it he pours it out on the ground
[1:02:49] for an offering to
[1:02:52] God I wonder if Jesus
[1:02:57] may have been thinking of that remember
[1:03:01] David this whole book of First
[1:03:03] Chronicles it is making David almost
[1:03:06] like a type of the
[1:03:08] Messiah because he's so
[1:03:10] great I wonder if Jesus may have been
[1:03:15] thinking of that story when he said this
[1:03:18] in Mark he said for whosoever shall give
[1:03:22] you a cup of water to drink in my name
[1:03:25] because you belong to Christ verily I
[1:03:29] say unto you he shall not lose his
[1:03:31] reward think about how those men gave so
[1:03:34] much to give that to King David 1
[1:03:38] Chronicles CH 12 the author continues to
[1:03:42] document the names to
[1:03:44] show um that all those who were loyal to
[1:03:48] David and how they were right in being
[1:03:50] loyal to the king I'll read it 1 1st
[1:03:54] Chronicles 12:17 and this is just
[1:03:56] typical of the book of 1 Chronicles and
[1:03:59] David went out to meet them and answered
[1:04:03] and said unto them if ye become
[1:04:05] peaceably unto me to Help Me Mine Heart
[1:04:08] shall be knit unto you but if you come
[1:04:11] out if you become come to betray me to
[1:04:13] my enemies seeing there is no wrong in
[1:04:16] mine hands the god of our fathers look
[1:04:18] thereon and rebuke it then the spirit
[1:04:22] Came Upon amsi who was was the chief of
[1:04:26] the captains and he said thine are we
[1:04:31] David and on thy side thy side thou son
[1:04:35] of Jesse peace peace be unto thee and
[1:04:38] peace be unto thy helpers for thine God
[1:04:41] help for thy God helpeth thee then David
[1:04:45] received them and made them captains of
[1:04:47] the
[1:04:48] band one thing to point out that the
[1:04:53] primary adversity the primary enemy in 1
[1:04:57] Chronicles as you probably gathered by
[1:05:00] now is the Philistines and for the next
[1:05:02] few chapters we see David fight the
[1:05:04] battles which of of which most of these
[1:05:07] battles many of them are also recorded
[1:05:08] in 2 Samuel so let's go to chapter
[1:05:12] 15 so David brings the Ark of the Lord
[1:05:15] up to Jerusalem now remember instead of
[1:05:19] he makes a mistake here and it's also
[1:05:21] recorded in 1
[1:05:23] Chronicles instead of the ark being
[1:05:26] carried with staves through the there
[1:05:28] were these Rings the Bible talks about
[1:05:30] them these rings that they put these
[1:05:31] long poles in and then the Levites would
[1:05:35] pick up the ark and carry these staves
[1:05:39] on their shoulders and they would walk
[1:05:41] they would bring the ark wherever it
[1:05:42] needed to go well David makes a mistake
[1:05:45] and that was commanded by the Lord so
[1:05:46] David makes a mistake and he puts this
[1:05:50] this arc on a
[1:05:54] cart which see seems like the easier way
[1:05:56] to go but it wasn't God's commandment so
[1:06:00] he puts this this cart in order and and
[1:06:04] it's going along and the ox stumbles and
[1:06:08] the man
[1:06:10] walking beside the ark puts his hand on
[1:06:15] on the ark to to help to keep it from
[1:06:18] falling and the man is immediately
[1:06:20] struck dead so David's fault because he
[1:06:26] did it wrong and a man lost his life so
[1:06:30] then in chapter so David finally brings
[1:06:32] the ark he does it right they puts it
[1:06:35] they put the staves in and they they
[1:06:36] bring the ark up up to Jerusalem and
[1:06:41] chapter 16 talks about bringing the ark
[1:06:43] into the City and David dancing in front
[1:06:45] of it and the worship leaders uh going
[1:06:49] and and very specific names and in
[1:06:51] instruments are being played in
[1:06:52] celebration of bringing the ark and
[1:06:55] David places The Ark in a tent now
[1:06:58] remember that in a few minutes I'm going
[1:07:00] to talk about that
[1:07:02] tent so in 16 so they set so they
[1:07:06] brought the Ark of God and set it in the
[1:07:08] midst of the tent that David had pitched
[1:07:10] for it and they offered burnt sacrifices
[1:07:13] I verse one brother Jeremy they offered
[1:07:15] burnt sacrifices and peace offerings
[1:07:18] before God now the next verses are very
[1:07:22] interesting because they me mention a
[1:07:24] very special person that I guarantee it
[1:07:27] every one of us probably in this room
[1:07:31] have read have read his name but you
[1:07:35] probably don't remember why you read his
[1:07:38] name or who he
[1:07:40] is and David made an end of offering the
[1:07:44] burnt offerings and peace offerings and
[1:07:46] he blessed the people in the name of the
[1:07:48] Lord and He dealt to every one of Israel
[1:07:51] both man and woman to everyone a loaf of
[1:07:53] bread and a good piece of FL flesh and a
[1:07:56] flagen of wine and he appointed certain
[1:07:59] of the
[1:08:00] Levites to minister before the Ark of
[1:08:03] the Lord and to record and to thank and
[1:08:07] praise the Lord God of Israel so these
[1:08:11] are worship leaders these are great men
[1:08:16] and they are they are there just to
[1:08:19] worship
[1:08:22] Levites this next person is going to be
[1:08:25] familiar name if you read the book of
[1:08:27] Psalms this man's name is
[1:08:31] Asaf and it's probably he was probably
[1:08:33] one of these worship leaders and he's
[1:08:35] mentioned over and over in the Book of
[1:08:38] Psalms his sons are mentioned later on
[1:08:41] in the book of First Chronicles and he's
[1:08:43] even he's even mentioned in the book of
[1:08:45] Ezra now I got this as I was researching
[1:08:48] this I got this from um gotquestions.org
[1:08:52] which is a Bible website that I often
[1:08:54] read and I I check a lot of I I'll think
[1:08:58] that that I have it right but I'll check
[1:08:59] it on this website and and this website
[1:09:02] says this if we examine the Psalms
[1:09:05] written by Asaf we can see that all of
[1:09:07] them have to do with the Judgment of God
[1:09:10] and many involve the prayers of the
[1:09:13] people at the prospect or moment of a
[1:09:16] particular event Asaf was a was a gifted
[1:09:19] individual he understood where the gift
[1:09:22] came from and he used his music to
[1:09:25] praise the Lord and communicate his word
[1:09:29] to a needy
[1:09:31] World verse 5 Asaf the chief and next to
[1:09:36] him
[1:09:37] Zachariah
[1:09:39] jel and Shimmer moth and J
[1:09:44] J and
[1:09:47] matayah and eliab and bayah and Obed
[1:09:51] Edom and jail with sues
[1:09:55] and with Harps but Asaf made a sound
[1:09:59] with
[1:10:00] symbols I love I love I love the Bible
[1:10:03] it's it it may not seem like much but
[1:10:06] here's who this guy is it says a Psalm
[1:10:08] of Asaf and then you read it it's like
[1:10:10] oh there's a Psalm of Asaf who's
[1:10:13] Asaf well here he is he's this guy he
[1:10:16] played the symbols I'm sure he played a
[1:10:18] lot of other stuff too but
[1:10:22] so we know who this man is and the book
[1:10:26] of Chronicles continues to Chronicle
[1:10:28] these names of these people so
[1:10:33] David chapter
[1:10:37] 17 David's in his house and remember I
[1:10:41] talked about the tent that the Ark of
[1:10:43] the Covenant was put in this tent
[1:10:46] David's in his house and he looks down
[1:10:50] and he sees this big beautiful home that
[1:10:53] he's in and he looks down he sees this
[1:10:55] little tent where the Ark of the
[1:10:57] Covenant was being stored so he calls
[1:11:00] Nathan the
[1:11:02] prophet and he tells Nathan something
[1:11:05] that's on his
[1:11:06] heart 17 verse one and now it came to
[1:11:10] pass as David sat in his house that
[1:11:13] David said to Nathan the prophet lo I
[1:11:16] dwell in a house of Cedars but the Ark
[1:11:18] of the Covenant of the Lord remaineth
[1:11:20] under curtains then Nathan said unto
[1:11:23] David do all that is in thine heart for
[1:11:26] God is with thee so David tells Nathan
[1:11:29] the prophet I'm living in this big
[1:11:31] beautiful house but the ark where God's
[1:11:33] strength has been manifested is in a
[1:11:35] tent so what is David's motive here he
[1:11:38] obviously wants to build a big place to
[1:11:42] hold the
[1:11:43] ark but David's main motive now I've
[1:11:47] heard Scholars say I've Heard lots of
[1:11:49] people say that that Nathan initially
[1:11:52] said yeah do what's in your heart David
[1:11:53] go ahead and do it but then then the
[1:11:55] Lord spoke to Nathan that night which
[1:11:57] I'll read here in a minute and then he
[1:11:59] comes back and he says oh I was wrong
[1:12:01] Nathan or David don't do it you can't do
[1:12:04] it but the prophet said do what's in
[1:12:08] your heart so what was in what was
[1:12:10] really in David's heart what was in
[1:12:12] David's heart was to serve God was to
[1:12:15] have the perfect will of God he had an
[1:12:18] idea and he was obviously inspired by
[1:12:21] this idea and he wanted to do it right
[1:12:25] Nathan wanted to do things right so here
[1:12:27] you have two great men a prophet and a
[1:12:30] king prophet and they are wanting to be
[1:12:34] in God's
[1:12:35] Will and then God tells them how to do
[1:12:40] it remember David was a man after God's
[1:12:44] Own Heart so his greatest desire was to
[1:12:46] do what God
[1:12:48] wanted so friends if our heart is
[1:12:52] sincere and you like David are willing
[1:12:58] to take no for an
[1:12:59] answer then God will give you exactly
[1:13:02] what you want which is to be in his
[1:13:04] perfect will and we'll do best like
[1:13:07] David did to be in his
[1:13:09] will so and that's exactly what happens
[1:13:12] here so we'll read the rest of the
[1:13:14] chapter and uh watch the
[1:13:17] comparisons in the word that that God
[1:13:20] that the word makes between
[1:13:22] Solomon and the Lord Jesus
[1:13:26] uh verse
[1:13:28] three
[1:13:31] 173 it says
[1:13:35] this and it came to pass that same night
[1:13:37] that the word of God came to Nathan
[1:13:39] saying go and tell David my servant thus
[1:13:41] sayeth the Lord Thou shalt not build me
[1:13:43] a house to dwell in for I have not dwelt
[1:13:45] in in a house since the day that I
[1:13:48] brought up
[1:13:49] Israel unto this day but have gone from
[1:13:53] tent to tent and from t one Tabernacle
[1:13:57] to another don't you love how God will
[1:14:00] move from person to person from church
[1:14:04] to church and there's no church there's
[1:14:06] no denomination there's no group that
[1:14:09] has an exclusive right to God God's like
[1:14:12] right here he's like no no no listen I
[1:14:15] go where I want to go I go from person
[1:14:20] to person from church to
[1:14:24] church
[1:14:27] whosoever God's still speaking whosoever
[1:14:30] I have walked with all Israel whosoever
[1:14:34] I have walked with all Israel spake i a
[1:14:37] word to any of the judges of Israel when
[1:14:40] I commanded to Feed My People saying
[1:14:42] what have you not why have you not built
[1:14:45] me a house of Cedars like I've never
[1:14:47] said to them why have you not build me a
[1:14:50] house now therefore thus shalt thou say
[1:14:53] unto my servant David th thus sayith the
[1:14:55] Lord of hosts I took thee from the Sheep
[1:14:57] coat even from following the sheep that
[1:14:59] thou should us be a ruler Over My People
[1:15:02] Israel and I have been with thee
[1:15:04] wheresoever thou Hast walked and I have
[1:15:05] cut off all thine enemies from before
[1:15:07] thee and I have made thee a name like
[1:15:10] the name of of the great men that are in
[1:15:12] the earth also I will ordain a place for
[1:15:16] My People Israel and will plant them and
[1:15:19] they shall dwell in their place and
[1:15:21] shall be moved no more neither neither
[1:15:25] shall the children of wickedness waste
[1:15:27] them anymore as at the
[1:15:30] beginning and since the time that I
[1:15:32] commanded the judges to be over My
[1:15:34] People Israel moreover I will subdue all
[1:15:37] thine enemies furthermore I tell thee
[1:15:41] that the Lord will build thee a
[1:15:44] house I think the Lord is making it
[1:15:46] clear here that David I did all of these
[1:15:50] things you didn't do nothing I am the
[1:15:54] one from the beginning beginning that
[1:15:55] has done it all and it shall come to
[1:15:57] pass when thy days be expired that thou
[1:16:00] must go to be with thy fathers that I
[1:16:02] will raise up thy seed after thee which
[1:16:05] shall be of thy sons and I will
[1:16:08] establish his kingdom now as brother
[1:16:11] Lyall has pointed out a few times when
[1:16:14] he has ministered on these sons does not
[1:16:17] necessarily mean your immediate
[1:16:20] Offspring it can be in your
[1:16:23] lineage
[1:16:25] and he shall build me a house now he's
[1:16:28] going to be typing remember the
[1:16:31] scriptures often have a two-fold
[1:16:36] meaning and he shall build me a house
[1:16:39] and I will establish his throne
[1:16:42] forever look at the type here Solomon
[1:16:44] will build a temple but his throne
[1:16:46] wasn't established
[1:16:49] forever I will be his
[1:16:52] father and he shall be my son for God
[1:16:57] gave for God so loved the world that he
[1:16:59] gave his only begotten son his only
[1:17:02] begotten
[1:17:03] son and I will not take my Mercy away
[1:17:06] from him as I took it from him that was
[1:17:09] before thee but I will settle him in
[1:17:11] mine house and my kingdom
[1:17:14] forever and his throne shall be
[1:17:16] established forever more who's God
[1:17:18] talking about here he's talking about
[1:17:20] Solomon but he's also talking about the
[1:17:22] great son of David that was to come
[1:17:25] according to all these words and
[1:17:27] according to all this Vision did Nathan
[1:17:29] speak unto David it is
[1:17:32] all about Christ this entire book every
[1:17:38] word 66 books is about one
[1:17:41] man every word in the Bible lifts up
[1:17:46] that one man it's all about him it's all
[1:17:48] about Jesus so in chapter 18 David goes
[1:17:52] back to battle with the Philistines so
[1:17:54] let's skip
[1:17:55] and and it's recorded and we've gone
[1:17:57] through these in in 1 and 2
[1:18:01] Samuel and let's go to 1st Chronicles
[1:18:04] chapter 22 now remember Nathan the
[1:18:06] prophet told David to do all that is in
[1:18:08] thine heart for God is with you David
[1:18:10] had a desire to build this Temple and
[1:18:13] God told him that his son would do it
[1:18:15] but Watch What Happens here in 22
[1:18:18] chapter
[1:18:21] 22:5 and David said Solomon my son is
[1:18:24] Young and tender and the house that is
[1:18:26] to be builded for the Lord must be
[1:18:28] exceeding magnifical I like that name
[1:18:31] that word I like King James sometimes
[1:18:35] that's just great exceeding
[1:18:38] magnifical of Fame and of Glory
[1:18:41] throughout all the countries I will
[1:18:43] therefore now make preparation for it so
[1:18:45] David prepared abundantly before his
[1:18:48] death then he called for Solomon his son
[1:18:51] and charged him to build a house for the
[1:18:54] Lord God of Israel and David said to
[1:18:56] Solomon my son as for me it was in my
[1:19:00] mind to build a house unto the name of
[1:19:03] the Lord my God but the word of the Lord
[1:19:06] came to me saying thou Hast shed blood
[1:19:09] abundantly and has made great Wars Thou
[1:19:13] shalt not build a house unto my name
[1:19:15] because thou has shed much blood upon
[1:19:17] the Earth in my sight Behold a son shall
[1:19:20] be born to thee who shall be a man of
[1:19:23] rest and I will give him rest from all
[1:19:26] his enemies roundabout for his name
[1:19:28] shall be Solomon and I will give peace
[1:19:30] and quietness unto Israel in his days he
[1:19:34] shall build a house for my name and he
[1:19:36] shall be my son and I will be his father
[1:19:38] and I will establish the Throne of his
[1:19:41] kingdom over Israel forever now my son
[1:19:45] the Lord be with thee and prosper thou
[1:19:48] and build the house of the Lord thy God
[1:19:50] as he hath said of thee only give only
[1:19:54] the Lord give thee wisdom and
[1:19:57] understanding and give thee charge
[1:19:58] concerning Israel that thou mayest keep
[1:20:01] the law of the Lord thy God then shalt
[1:20:05] thou Prosper if thou takest heed to
[1:20:08] fulfill the statutes and judgments which
[1:20:11] the Lord charged charged Moses
[1:20:13] concerning Israel be strong and be of
[1:20:16] good courage and Dread not neither be
[1:20:18] dismayed so then David goes on with his
[1:20:21] instruction for the building of the
[1:20:22] temple it's called Solomon's
[1:20:26] Temple but really it was all David's
[1:20:30] inspiration it was David's plan it was
[1:20:32] every David got everything from the Lord
[1:20:34] he just didn't put it together it was
[1:20:38] Solomon's job to put it together verse
[1:20:42] 19 Now set your heart and your soul to
[1:20:46] seek the Lord your God Arise therefore
[1:20:48] and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord
[1:20:51] God to bring the Ark of the Covenant of
[1:20:53] the Lord and and and the holy vessels of
[1:20:55] God into the house that God built to the
[1:20:59] name of the
[1:21:00] Lord so then in the in the subsequent
[1:21:03] chapters the following
[1:21:05] chapters David sets up the priesthood in
[1:21:08] chapter 25 he talks about the musicians
[1:21:10] and the singers again in great detail
[1:21:13] chapter 28 he has this public meeting
[1:21:17] with the leadership to announce the
[1:21:19] plans just like I've been talking about

[1:21:29] chapter 29 David takes up an offering to
[1:21:32] raise the money to build the temple and
[1:21:35] then Solomon is anointed king a second
[1:21:41] time let's
[1:21:44] um everything as I said is in great
[1:21:48] detail because this is going to be used
[1:21:50] for the ages to come and this record
[1:21:53] provided the priest and the leadership
[1:21:55] the leaders with a template on how to
[1:21:58] conduct Church order and many other

[1:22:21] furthermore David the king said un all
[1:22:23] the congregation Solomon my son whom
[1:22:26] alone God hath chosen is yet young and
[1:22:29] tender and the work is great for the
[1:22:31] palace is not for man but for the Lord
[1:22:35] God now I have prepared with all my
[1:22:38] might for the house of my God the gold
[1:22:40] for things to be made of gold the silver
[1:22:43] for things of silver and the brass for
[1:22:45] things of brass and the iron for things
[1:22:46] of iron and the wood for things of wood

[1:22:54] colors and all manner of precious stones
[1:22:58] marble and stones in abundant and he
[1:23:02] goes on he talks about more of the
[1:23:04] details verse six then the chief of the
[1:23:08] fathers and the princes of the tribes of
[1:23:09] Israel and the captains of the thousands
[1:23:12] of hundreds with the rulers of the
[1:23:14] king's work offered willingly and gave

[1:23:35] stones were found gave them to The
[1:23:38] Treasure of the house of the Lord by the
[1:23:40] hand of JAL the ganite then the people
[1:23:44] rejoiced for that they had offered
[1:23:46] willingly because the perfect because
[1:23:49] with a perfect heart they offered
[1:23:50] willingly to the Lord and David the king
[1:23:53] also rejoiced with great joy wherefore
[1:23:57] David blessed the Lord before all the
[1:23:59] congregation and David said blessed be
[1:24:02] thou Lord God of Israel Our Father
[1:24:04] forever and
[1:24:08] ever thine O Lord is the greatness and
[1:24:11] the power and the glory and the Victory
[1:24:12] and the Majesty for all that is in
[1:24:14] heaven and and Earth is thine thine is
[1:24:17] the kingdom O Lord and thou art exalted
[1:24:20] as head above all both riches and honor
[1:24:23] come from thee and thou reignest over
[1:24:25] all and in thine hand is power and might
[1:24:29] and in thine hand it it is to make great
[1:24:32] and to give strength unto all but now
[1:24:35] therefore Our God we thank thee and
[1:24:38] praise thy glorious name amen but who am
[1:24:41] I and what is my people that we should
[1:24:44] be able to offer so willingly after this
[1:24:47] sword for all things come from thee and
[1:24:50] of thine own hand and thine own have we
[1:24:54] given in thee so David is saying here
[1:24:56] that all the gifts that are coming from
[1:24:59] the congregation here to help build this
[1:25:01] Temple it all comes from God in the
[1:25:03] first place for we are strangers before
[1:25:06] thee and Souljers as as we're all of our
[1:25:11] fathers our days on the Earth are as a
[1:25:13] shadow and there is none abiding oh Lord
[1:25:17] Our God all this store that we have
[1:25:21] prepared to build thee a house for thine
[1:25:23] holy name name cometh of thy hand and is
[1:25:27] all thine own I know also my God that
[1:25:31] thou triest the heart and has pleasure
[1:25:33] in the upright in uprightness as for me
[1:25:36] in uprightness of my of mine heart I
[1:25:39] have willingly offered all these things
[1:25:42] and now I have seen with joy thy people
[1:25:46] which are present here to offer
[1:25:48] willingly unto
[1:25:53] thee
[1:25:57] look at the the joy that they
[1:26:01] had they're honored to be able to give
[1:26:04] they were honored to be able to to
[1:26:06] contribute to this there's other places
[1:26:09] that that I didn't mention that God
[1:26:13] provided and maybe
[1:26:15] it's maybe it's when Solomon's putting
[1:26:17] this together but God provided every
[1:26:21] skill that was needed to build
[1:26:24] that
[1:26:26] Temple and I think even now in our in
[1:26:29] our church I thank God that we have I
[1:26:32] look at brother Ed and all that he's
[1:26:34] doing and putting in so much time
[1:26:36] brother Ed what if we didn't have you
[1:26:39] but God
[1:26:40] provided brother Ed there someone who's
[1:26:44] willing to give his time he was out he's
[1:26:47] out doing the work
[1:26:49] himself and God here records in this
[1:26:53] chronic chrles these people that came
[1:26:56] forth that freely gave their skills to
[1:27:00] help oh Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of
[1:27:03] Israel our fathers keep this forever in
[1:27:06] the imagination of the thoughts of the
[1:27:09] heart of thy people and prepare their
[1:27:12] heart unto
[1:27:13] thee and give unto Solomon my son a
[1:27:17] perfect
[1:27:18] heart to keep thy Commandments thy
[1:27:21] testimonies and thy statutes and to do
[1:27:23] all these things and to build the the
[1:27:26] palace for the which I have made
[1:27:31] provision and David said to all the
[1:27:33] congregation now bless the Lord your
[1:27:37] God and all the congregation blessed the
[1:27:40] Lord God of their fathers and bowed down
[1:27:42] their heads and worshiped the Lord and
[1:27:46] the
[1:27:47] king the new King James says they bowed
[1:27:51] themselves before the Lord and the King
[1:27:55] and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the
[1:27:57] Lord and offered burnt offerings unto
[1:27:59] the Lord on the tomorrow after that day
[1:28:02] even a thousand Bullocks and a thousand
[1:28:04] Rams and a thousand Lambs with their
[1:28:06] drink offering and sacrifices in
[1:28:08] abundance of Israel look at how honored
[1:28:10] they were to be able to
[1:28:12] give and did eat and drink before the
[1:28:15] Lord on the day with great G gladness
[1:28:18] and they made Solomon the son of David
[1:28:20] King the second time remember the first
[1:28:24] first time it was done in private just
[1:28:27] with
[1:28:28] David and Nathan and the priests and a
[1:28:32] couple people now they were anointing
[1:28:36] Solomon King in front of everyone and
[1:28:39] anointed him unto the Lord to be the
[1:28:41] chief governor and zadok to be the
[1:28:45] priest then Solomon sat on the throne of
[1:28:48] the of the Lord as King instead of David
[1:28:51] his father and prospered and all Israel
[1:28:54] obeyed him and all the princes and the
[1:28:56] Mighty Men and all the sons likewise of
[1:29:00] King David submitted themselves unto
[1:29:02] Solomon the
[1:29:04] king and the Lord magnified Solomon what
[1:29:07] a beautiful type I know David's a type
[1:29:10] of Solomon's also a beautiful type of
[1:29:11] the Lord Jesus as I said it's all about
[1:29:14] Jesus and the Lord magnified Solomon
[1:29:17] exceedingly in the sight of Israel and
[1:29:19] bestowed upon Him such a royal majestry
[1:29:22] as had not been on any King before him
[1:29:24] in Israel thus David the son of Jesse
[1:29:28] reigned over Israel Over All isra Israel
[1:29:32] and the time that he reigned over Israel
[1:29:34] was 40 years seven years reigned he in
[1:29:36] Hein and 30 years and 30 and3 years
[1:29:39] reigned he in Jerusalem and he died in a
[1:29:41] good old age full of
[1:29:44] days you remember how many years that
[1:29:47] was 70 years old David died and he died
[1:29:51] in a good old age full of days riches
[1:29:53] and in honor and Solomon his son reigned
[1:29:56] in his stead now the acts of David the
[1:29:58] king first and the last behold they are
[1:30:01] written in the book of Samuel the sear
[1:30:03] which we just went through and in the
[1:30:05] book of Nathan the prophet and in the
[1:30:08] book of GAD the sear with all his Reign
[1:30:11] and his might and the times that went
[1:30:14] over him and over Israel and over all
[1:30:18] the kingdoms of the
[1:30:20] countries and thus we have the close of
[1:30:24] the book of 1
[1:30:26] Chronicles let's let's
[1:30:31] stand 1

[1:30:45] David that Chronicles very much focuses
[1:30:49] on because he is in the line of the
[1:30:52] coming Messiah
[1:30:55] I would like to be one of those mighty
[1:30:56] men that David had
[1:31:00] whatever David wanted they were willing
[1:31:03] to do it all the way to risking their
[1:31:05] lives brothers and sisters whatever the
[1:31:07] Lord Jesus wants from
