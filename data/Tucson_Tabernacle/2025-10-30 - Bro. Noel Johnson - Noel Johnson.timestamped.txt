[6:48] God reigns.
[6:51] [Music]
[6:53] Our God reigns.
[6:57] It was our sin
[7:01] and guilt that bruised and wounded him.
[7:07] It was our sin
[7:12] that brought him down.
[7:17] When we like sheep

[10:28] Give him praise. He's so worthy.
[10:34] Amen.
[10:36] Amen. When she started, we were playing
[10:38] that song and I was going to come out
[10:40] and then brother Dan called me over and
[10:42] I go, "Well, we'll sing the other one
[10:44] and then we'll sing." Was it just it's
[10:46] an atmosphere that it creates when you
[10:48] sing about him and you worship him and
[10:50] you give him glory because there's
[10:52] nothing nothing more than he wants to do
[10:54] is just come and be with us. So, amen.
[10:57] Amen.
[10:59] You know, sometimes we worry about
[11:01] tomorrow, but remember, he holds
[11:03] tomorrow. He's already been there. He's
[11:06] already sent in, and he said it's okay.
[11:09] Amen.
[11:10] [Music]
[11:14] Oh, I don't know
[11:19] about tomorrow.
[11:23] [Music]
[11:25] I just lay
[11:29] from day to day.
[11:35] I don't mind
[11:40] from its sunshine
[11:44] for its skies
[11:49] may turn to gray.
[11:54] I don't worry
[11:58] over the future
[12:01] [Music]
[12:04] for I know
[12:07] [Music]
[12:08] what Jesus said.
[12:12] [Music]
[12:13] And today
[12:18] I'll walk beside
[12:21] you.
[12:23] before he knows
[12:25] [Music]
[12:27] what lies ahead.
[12:33] many things
[12:37] about tomorrow.
[12:40] [Music]
[12:42] I don't seem
[12:46] to understand
[12:49] [Music]
[12:52] but I know
[12:56] who holds tomorrow.
[13:02] And I know
[13:05] who holds my hand.
[13:09] [Music]
[13:11] Every step
[13:15] is getting brighter.
[13:20] As the golden
[13:25] stairs I climb,
[13:30] every birdenance
[13:35] getting lighter,
[13:40] every cloud
[13:44] is silver light.
[13:49] There the sun
[13:53] is always shining
[13:58] there. No tear.
[14:02] Well, dim the eyes. Just tears of joy
[14:07] at the end
[14:12] of the rainbow
[14:17] where the mountain
[14:21] tongs touch the sky.
[14:26] and many things
[14:30] about tomorrow.
[14:35] I don't seem
[14:39] to understand,
[14:44] but I know
[14:49] who holds tomorrow.
[14:52] [Music]
[14:54] And I know
[14:58] who holds my hand.
[15:03] You have him by the hand. He has you by
[15:05] the hand. He'll never let go. Amen.
[15:09] Praise God. You may be seated.
[15:13] I don't know, but I'm just enjoying this
[15:15] atmosphere.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; I know it's good out there, too. I just
[15:19] see the rejoicing. But when you talk
[15:21] about him and when you invite him, he
[15:23] comes
[15:24] and and he goes down and he talks to you
[15:26] where he needs to talk to you. Sometimes
[15:30] say, "Lord, this is what I would like
[15:32] and this is I think what you should do."
[15:33] And the Lord says, "Really? Why don't
[15:35] you let me do what?" Kind of like
[15:38] sometimes our children, daddy, I think I
[15:40] would I would need this. Like my
[15:41] grandson at 7 years old thinks he should
[15:43] be able to drive a car already, you
[15:45] know. But grandpa and dad saying it's
[15:48] it's coming but wait on the Lord. Amen.
[15:52] Amen.
[15:54] And into all this, it's not I but Christ
[15:57] in me. And just you just let it let it
[16:00] go to him and say, "Lord, here it is."
[16:03] [Music]
[16:06] What gift of grace
[16:09] is Jesus my redeemer
[16:14] [Music]
[16:18] heaven now to give.
[16:22] He is my joy,
[16:25] my righteousness and freedom.
[16:30] My steadfast love,
[16:33] my deep and boundless peace.
[16:38] To this I hold. My hope is only Jesus.
[16:47] For my life
[16:49] is wholly bound to him.
[16:55] Oh, how strange and divine. I can sing.
[17:01] All is mine, yet not
[17:05] but through Christ.
[17:07] [Music]
[17:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going let brother Josiah sang it
[17:16] last time and he kept the temple a lot
[17:18] better than I did. So, thank you,
[17:20] brother. The night is dawn,
[17:24] but I am not yours.
[17:28] For by my side,
[17:31] the Savior, he will stay.
[17:35] [Music]
[17:36] I labor on in weakness and rejoiceing,
[17:44] for in my need
[17:47] his power is displayed.
[17:51] To this I hold. My shepherd will defend
[17:57] me.
[17:59] Through the deepest
[18:02] valley he will lead.
[18:07] Oh, the night has been won. And I shall
[18:13] overcome
[18:14] yet not I, but through Christ
[18:19] in me.
[18:22] No fate I dread.
[18:24] I know I am forgi.
[18:29] The future sure
[18:32] the price it has been paid.
[18:36] For Jesus bled and suffered for my
[18:42] pardon
[18:44] and he was raised to overthrow the
[18:49] grave.
[18:51] Oh, to this I hold. My sin has been
[18:56] defeated.
[18:59] Jesus now
[19:01] and ever is my plea.
[19:06] Oh the chains are released I can sing. I
[19:12] am free yet not I. But through Christ
[19:18] in me, with every breath,
[19:23] with every breath,
[19:25] I long to follow Jesus.
[19:30] For he has said
[19:33] that he will bring me home.
[19:38] And day by day,
[19:41] I know he will renew me.
[19:46] until I stand with joy before the
[19:50] throne.
[19:53] To this I hold. My hope is only Jesus.
[20:00] [Music]
[20:01] All the glory
[20:04] ever more to him.
[20:08] When the race is complete, still my lips
[20:14] shall repeat. Yet not I, but through
[20:18] Christ. Into this I hold.
[20:23] To this I hold. My hope is only Jesus.
[20:30] All the gloryy
[20:33] ever more to him.
[20:38] When the race is complete, still my lips
[20:43] shall repeat. Yet not I, but through
[20:48] Christ
[20:50] in me. When the race When the race is
[20:55] complete, still my lips shall repeat.
[21:00] Yet not I, but through Christ
[21:05] in me.
[21:09] [Music]
[21:11] Amen.
[21:14] It's um it's nice to have him there.
[21:16] It's also intimidating sometimes.
[21:20] Haven't found anything that he can't
[21:21] sing yet.
[21:23] Maybe maybe in Spanish, but his brother
[21:25] did a really good job singing in
[21:27] Spanish, so he might catch us all by
[21:29] surprise.
[21:31] But every song should be a praise to
[21:33] God.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; It should lift him up. should give him
[21:36] glory.
[21:38] But then you should receive the blessing
[21:40] when you give it. And that's why you
[21:41] give it to him. Not because Lord, if I
[21:44] give you this, you're going to you give
[21:45] me a blessing. Lord, I just want to
[21:47] praise you. I just want to worship you.
[21:49] I just want to say thank you. And just
[21:52] like a mother and a father, when the
[21:54] children are that way, it's our hearts
[21:56] are to help them too. Now, even when
[21:59] they're disobedient, we still love them.
[22:02] But it does take some correction
[22:03] sometimes. Amen.
[22:05] So, we'll sing that. Um, have your way.
[22:10] Brother Daniel will be coming out here
[22:12] in a minute. So,
[22:17] have your way.
[22:23] Have your way.
[22:27] [Music]
[22:29] Holy Spirit,
[22:33] fill our hearts and have your way.
[22:42] As we pray
[22:48] and as we pray,
[22:54] speak your word into our hearts and have
[23:01] your way.
[23:04] Would you ask him that right now?
[23:07] Have your way.
[23:13] Have your way.
[23:15] [Music]
[23:18] Holy Spirit,
[23:21] fill our hearts and have your way.
[23:31] As we wait
[23:34] [Music]
[23:36] and as we pray,
[23:39] [Music]
[23:42] speak your word into our hearts and have
[23:49] your way.
[23:54] Have your way.
[23:57] [Music]
[24:00] Have your way.
[24:06] Holy Spirit,
[24:09] fill our hearts and have your way.
[24:16] [Music]
[24:18] As we wait
[24:20] [Music]
[24:23] and as we pray,
[24:29] speak your word.
[24:32] [Music]
[24:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you, friends.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; It's a It's a good evening. It's it's a
[24:45] wonderful day that the Lord has given
[24:48] us. I appreciate our brother here,
[24:51] brother Null. Um last minute I asked
[24:56] Brother Aaron, Brother Lyle, I said, "I
[24:58] don't know if I can I can do it this
[25:01] Wednesday night and uh Brother Aaron
[25:03] said, "Oh, Brother Null's in town." I
[25:05] thought, "Yes, he is." So, he he saved
[25:08] me. Um as you can see, we made a little
[25:10] bit of a mess outside. I promise we'll
[25:13] clean it up and it's going to be a lot
[25:15] neater than before it was. So, what's
[25:18] going to happen out there is the um
[25:22] we are going to repour the all the
[25:24] concrete. So, all the cracks and
[25:26] everything and big puddles are going to
[25:28] be gone. We're going to repour the
[25:30] concrete there. The area where the kids
[25:34] area is, it's just a little sidewalk
[25:37] right now that's going to come out uh
[25:39] quite a ways. So that'll be the area of
[25:42] fellowship. We're going to put some
[25:44] planters there on uh on the front of
[25:47] that that face that will face Hento here
[25:51] and um we'll have power. We'll have
[25:54] irrigation to the planters and um and a
[25:58] big structure, a big shelter that's
[26:00] going to go over the whole thing. So I
[26:02] know that seems like the top of my head
[26:05] just gets cooked after Sunday service.
[26:09] So, we'll have a place that we can stand
[26:11] under the shade and fellowship. I think
[26:12] it's going to be really, really nice.
[26:15] Special thanks as always to our trustees
[26:19] and the work that they do. Brother Dan
[26:21] Numer there, brother John Ler, he's been
[26:24] heading up this project with these um
[26:27] the changes to the courtyard there, and
[26:30] brother Ed Dooall always always here and
[26:35] working.
[26:40] don't want to forget the one that is
[26:42] literally almost always here and he's
[26:45] out getting some stuff done back east
[26:47] right now and that's brother Arie
[26:49] Peterson and brother Arie he may not be
[26:51] here right now but he that brother
[26:54] whenever there's a problem at the church
[26:56] brother Arie is the first one on the
[26:58] scene so special thanks to the trustees
[27:01] they do just such a great job friends
[27:03] we're blessed
[27:05] &gt;&gt; we're blessed to have the deacons and
[27:06] trustees that we
[27:08] just um
[27:11] I prayed
[27:13] the Lord gave us a good foundation
[27:17] when I started a couple years ago and
[27:21] one of the first things I asked for I
[27:23] said Lord you've given us you've given
[27:24] us some good deacons and you've given us
[27:27] a couple good trustees but I need I need
[27:30] two more trustees
[27:32] and the Lord answered that prayer with
[27:35] Dan Numer and John Loker
[27:37] So these those two brothers are they're
[27:39] really they are the manifestation of a
[27:41] prayer that I ask the Lord for.
[27:47] Um we're we are blessed. We are blessed.
[27:52] Sister Shirley, God bless you. Welcome.
[27:55] Sister Shirley's brother Null Johnson's
[27:57] wife. Everybody knows Brother Null.
[27:59] Brother Lyall Johnson's brother and a
[28:03] wonderful teacher. It runs in their
[28:05] family, I guess, with the two Johnson's
[28:08] that I know are very, very good teachers
[28:10] of the word. Let's all stand. Um, where
[28:13] is Brother Aaron? Did Could you help me?
[28:16] Let's sing. Let's sing the Amazing Grace
[28:18] the traditional way. Can we sing that?
[28:21] Thank you. I'll be introducing our dear
[28:23] brother from North Carolina, minister of
[28:26] the gospel, Brother Null Johnson.
[28:33] Amazing
[28:36] grace,
[28:38] how sweet
[28:41] the sound
[28:44] that saved
[28:47] a wretch
[28:49] like me.
[28:54] I once
[28:57] was lost,
[29:00] but now
[29:02] I'm found.
[29:05] I was blind,
[29:07] but now
[29:10] I see. Let's do that last verse.
[29:14] Oh, when we've
[29:17] been there
[29:20] 10,000
[29:23] years,
[29:25] bright shineing
[29:28] as
[29:29] the sun
[29:34] with no
[29:37] less days
[29:40] to sing
[29:42] God's praise.
[29:44] [Music]
[29:58] I want to greet you in the name of the
[29:59] Lord Jesus Christ
[30:01] and it's always my privilege to come and
[30:04] to be with you. I was listening to the
[30:07] songs that you were singing as beginning
[30:09] of the service. One of them was our god
[30:12] reigns.
[30:13] I ask you, do you believe it? The other
[30:17] ones I don't know about tomorrow.
[30:19] No, but who's leading you?
[30:22] &gt;&gt; And those are that's basically the
[30:24] subject matter of what I'm going into.
[30:26] While you're standing, if you'd open
[30:28] your Bibles to Hebrews, the 4th chapter,
[30:30] we'll read two verses.
[30:33] When I was asked to minister, I had a
[30:35] thought in my mind.
[30:38] I just didn't know how to I didn't know
[30:40] how to come come about it to present
[30:43] what I have a desire in my heart to
[30:45] present to you. So we started off in
[30:48] Hebrews 4th chapter in verse one it says
[30:51] but let us therefore fear lest a promise
[30:53] being left us of entering into his rest
[30:56] any of you should seem to come short of
[30:58] it. For unto us was the gospel preached
[31:00] as well as unto them. But the word
[31:03] preached did not profit them, not being
[31:05] mixed with faith in them that heard it.
[31:08] And let's just pray.
[31:11] Our most gracious, loving heavenly
[31:13] father,
[31:14] we've gathered together that we might
[31:16] worship you, that we might adore you,
[31:19] that we might give unto you the gift of
[31:21] praise, Lord, that it comes from our
[31:22] heart. But then, Lord, it comes a part
[31:25] of the service where, Lord, we sit back
[31:27] and we sit at your feet and receive what
[31:29] you'd have for us. You've chosen to
[31:32] speak through men. It's been my my lot,
[31:34] Lord, to stand before the purchase of
[31:36] your blood this evening. But Lord, I
[31:39] want you to take my thoughts and guide
[31:41] them. Let the words that are spoken,
[31:42] Lord, I want them to come from you. For
[31:45] I ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[31:48] You can be seated.
[31:51] I had a thought couple days ago
[31:55] that may not make much sense to you, but
[31:57] I says, "Life is a journey into an
[31:58] unknown."
[32:01] Now, who do you want to lead you?
[32:03] I don't know about tomorrow. I don't
[32:05] know what our government's going to do.
[32:07] I don't know anything and anything about
[32:08] anything. I know the sun is scheduled to
[32:11] rise. God ordains that. Well, if it
[32:14] rises and I get to raise with it, that
[32:16] means God's given me another day. What
[32:19] he wants me to do during the day. Um, he
[32:22] doesn't tell me normally until I get out
[32:24] of bed. But one of the things that when
[32:27] it says, "Let us therefore fear. Let's
[32:29] be fearful. Let let's let's be aware
[32:31] that there is something there is a
[32:33] promise that God has given to us which
[32:35] will allow us to enter into a into a
[32:38] condition of rest.
[32:41] But we have to have faith to believe
[32:43] that.
[32:45] And and the rest that it's talking about
[32:47] there is not, you know, after you've
[32:48] been out in the yard and you're working
[32:50] hard and stuff and like that and you go
[32:51] back, sit in your recliner, have a cup
[32:53] of have a cup of tea or whatever it is.
[32:56] And yeah, we we we let our body rest.
[33:00] But but the rest here, the rest that I
[33:03] want to try and portray is is not just
[33:06] coming in and putting up our feet or
[33:08] going to bed and getting rest. know
[33:09] there there's something there's a deeper
[33:11] there's a deeper thought that I would
[33:13] like like to try and present to you.
[33:17] I've been under the impression
[33:18] especially since coming into the
[33:20] message. I believe Christians should be
[33:23] able to to so place their faith in God
[33:26] that we can be at a state of rest. a
[33:30] state where we no longer fear tomorrow
[33:32] or what what it may bring because we
[33:35] know we have faith that God is the one
[33:37] in control and believe he's directing my
[33:40] life.
[33:41] It's taken me years to come to this
[33:43] conclusion to come to this awareness.
[33:46] But once I began to realize I have no
[33:48] control of tomorrow, I have I have no
[33:51] control over my life. I mean, yeah, I'm
[33:54] I'm standing here. I'm 81 years old.
[33:57] I've already had my my I'm I'm you know
[34:00] since I'm 81 I'm in borrowed time so so
[34:02] to speak your promise three score and 10
[34:04] if if you make it to 80 by for whatever
[34:07] reason great but after that you're on
[34:10] your own boy you know but you have but I
[34:13] I have come to the understanding
[34:16] especially and I'll get to this later on
[34:18] but I've come to the understanding there
[34:20] is a place we can get to in God where we
[34:23] can so believe him that we no longer
[34:27] longer fear tomorrow.
[34:29] We no longer worry about tomorrow. We no
[34:31] longer can that doesn't matter what
[34:33] tomorrow brings because God has already
[34:34] been there. He's already knows what
[34:36] problems we're going to face and he's
[34:38] already taken care of it if we'll let
[34:40] him. Brother Randomman says, "Why are
[34:43] people all tossed about?" Brother
[34:44] Brandham makes a statement. He said,
[34:46] "The Christian faith is based solidly
[34:49] upon rest." That's right. A Christian is
[34:52] not tossed about. A Christian doesn't
[34:54] run from place to place. A prison
[34:56] doesn't fuss and fume and worry about
[34:58] things. A Christian rests. It's all
[35:01] over. It's all finished for the
[35:04] believers at Calvary. That's right. Oh,
[35:06] sickness may come and disappointments,
[35:08] but the Christians at rest knowing this,
[35:11] that God is able to keep that which he
[35:13] has performed, knowing that no matter
[35:15] what the thing is, how it looks, neither
[35:18] there's sickness or sorrow or death.
[35:19] There's neither starvation or anything
[35:21] that can separate us from the love of
[35:23] God that's in Christ Jesus. We're at
[35:25] rest. Just let the old ship tossed on
[35:28] your way once to the anchor holds. And
[35:31] so when I began to look at that and I
[35:33] began to study that and and began to
[35:35] dwell upon it in hab in Hebrews 4 and3 u
[35:40] going on brother in Paul writing he says
[35:44] for we which have believed to enter into
[35:46] rest as he said as I have sworn in my
[35:48] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[35:50] though the works were finished from the
[35:52] foundation of the world. In one of the
[35:55] commentaries I have at Vincent's word
[35:56] studies, he takes this verse three and
[35:58] he breaks it down. He says, I he says, I
[36:03] say by faith, for we believers who
[36:06] embrace the Christian faith when it was
[36:09] offered to us do enter into the rest.
[36:13] Not our entering or on the way to, but
[36:16] entering into the rest is a fact which
[36:19] is characteristic of us as believers.
[36:22] We actually have we actually when we
[36:24] believe if when you cannot when you
[36:26] grasp the magnitude of the love that God
[36:31] portrayed to us at the cross. When you
[36:34] can begin to understand how God came
[36:36] from the came from glory. He came and
[36:38] dwelt in a human frame and that frame
[36:42] was willing to go to the cross to save
[36:45] us.
[36:47] One of the things I studied the life of
[36:49] Christ relationally somebody challenged
[36:50] me with something else and I didn't I
[36:52] didn't like their concept you know they
[36:54] they said oh yeah Jesus Christ was hum
[36:56] was was all of humanity and he was
[37:00] but he was all of humanity but also God
[37:02] dwelt in him and and I and I I always
[37:05] wonder how is it that God dwelt how that
[37:09] God dealt with living in flesh.
[37:13] Adam when he was in theophony he didn't
[37:15] have a care in the world when he came
[37:17] into flesh that's when the troubles all
[37:19] started but I ran across in my study
[37:22] brother Brandon makes a statement he
[37:23] said what happened with Jesus Christ
[37:26] because he had free will
[37:28] he had to choose every day what he was
[37:31] going to do
[37:33] but he was willing to take his free will
[37:36] and give it to God
[37:39] he only did as God directed him. The
[37:43] real struggle came when he when he got
[37:45] to Gethsemane. He already knew that the
[37:48] cross was there. He already knew that
[37:50] was what God had ordained for him to go
[37:51] and to do. But yet he he began to cry
[37:54] out in agony. Is there any other way?
[37:58] Can I avoid this cross?
[38:01] But he says, "Not what I will, but I'll
[38:04] do as you will." He chose to go to the
[38:08] cross.
[38:10] I I when when I began to concentrate on
[38:13] that, I began to realize this is huge.
[38:16] He did not have to go. He could have
[38:19] said, "No, I like it here. I'm enjoying
[38:21] myself. I like my disciples and and
[38:24] we're having a great time. I I think
[38:25] I'll just bypass this." He could have. I
[38:29] think one day, don't you know, I could
[38:30] have called 10,000 angels and he could
[38:32] have cleaned this place up. He willingly
[38:35] gave his life for us. And to me, that's
[38:40] huge. I don't I don't know how it
[38:41] strikes you, but but to me, this this
[38:43] this is I I have never thought of it in
[38:46] in in that way for for a long time.
[38:49] But but what I wanted to do is I I I was
[38:52] trying to think, well, what type of
[38:54] examples can I use
[38:56] in order to express the point that I'm
[38:58] trying to make? And the first one I I
[39:01] thought about David. And David's an
[39:04] interesting character. You guys have
[39:05] already studied him quite extensively.
[39:08] David was out there minding his own
[39:10] business, feeding his dad sheep. U God
[39:14] had told Samuel, he says, "Go down.
[39:16] You're going to anoint the next king of
[39:17] Israel." So Samuel obedient, he took the
[39:20] horn of oil. He went into David's
[39:22] father's house. And then he says, "Where
[39:25] put all your sons? Let them let me see
[39:27] them." So oh, here nice, strong,
[39:29] handsome young man. And he was he's
[39:31] going to anoint him. And God says, I
[39:33] rejected him. And he went through all of
[39:35] them until finally Samuel looked at
[39:38] David's dad and says, "Don't you have
[39:40] another one?" Oh, yeah. I forgot about
[39:44] him. Yeah. Yeah. He's someplace out in
[39:46] the field taking care of a bunch of
[39:48] sheep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He He's out
[39:50] there. We'll call him in. So So David
[39:54] walks in and all of a sudden God says,
[39:55] "He's the one."
[39:57] So here this old man, gray bearded, he
[40:00] takes his horn of oil and dumps it all
[40:01] over the top of David's head and says,
[40:03] "David, you are the next king of
[40:05] Israel."
[40:07] Oh, interesting. What was David's thing?
[40:12] Did he run to S and say, "Hey, I'm going
[40:13] to be the next king. I I need to be some
[40:15] I need some training. I need you to sit
[40:17] there and direct me how to do." No, he
[40:19] went back to the sheep.
[40:21] From that point on, we can follow in
[40:24] David's life, God prepared him to be
[40:28] what God had ordained him to be from the
[40:31] beginning of time.
[40:33] So he went there, all of a sudden Saul
[40:35] was having bad moods because of an evil
[40:37] spirit God had put on him. And so that
[40:40] why did they choose David?
[40:43] Because God ordained for David to go
[40:46] there and to play before him. And then
[40:49] that's when David became got to observe
[40:52] how the court of a king takes care of
[40:55] business so to speak.
[40:58] But then there was a battle with Goliath
[41:02] and the Philistines. And so all of a
[41:04] sudden David went back taking care of
[41:06] the sheep. His sons went out there to
[41:08] the battle and his father was concerned
[41:11] about how his sons were doing. And so he
[41:14] takes David, gives him some food and
[41:16] stuff and says, "Here, take them see how
[41:19] the see how your sons are doing. your
[41:20] brothers are doing.
[41:23] So, so David arrives about the same time
[41:25] that Goliath's making this huge boast.
[41:29] And David listens to this guy
[41:32] and says, "Aren't any of you guys going
[41:34] to fight this guy?
[41:37] We have a promise from God. We are God's
[41:41] children. We have a covenant but from
[41:44] God and he promised to be with us. He
[41:47] promised to help us overcome. He
[41:49] promised to defeat the enemy. He
[41:51] promised to take care of all of these
[41:52] things. So what are you afraid of this
[41:53] guy for?
[41:55] So David says, "I'll go fight him." But
[41:58] see, God had prepared David for the f
[42:01] battle with Goliath because a lion came
[42:03] in once and a lion comes in, I normally
[42:05] find the exit, you know. No, he fought
[42:07] the lion. He killed it. A bear came out,
[42:11] he killed the bear.
[42:14] And so when he stood before Goliath, he
[42:16] realized this guy, this guy's nothing.
[42:18] I've already done a lion. I've already
[42:20] done a bear. What's this uncircumcised
[42:21] Philistine? And it's interesting when
[42:23] when you look at David, Saul tried to
[42:26] put his his theological understanding on
[42:28] him and he just got rid of that really
[42:30] quick. He went down and chose five
[42:33] smooth stones, put it in the bag the
[42:36] shepherds have, and then he ran toward
[42:41] Goliath.
[42:42] He didn't just kind of tippy toe, you
[42:44] know. No, he ran toward and put a stone
[42:47] in the sling and got out of one and let
[42:49] it rip. God directed the stone.
[42:53] It slew Goliath.
[42:57] God had prepared David for that battle.
[43:00] He had faith in God because he had seen
[43:03] how God worked in his life in protecting
[43:06] the sheep and taking care of him. And
[43:08] and David had a relationship with God
[43:10] where he would sit and God would inspire
[43:13] him with songs. And so we have a lot of
[43:15] them written in in in the Psalms. David
[43:18] had a relationship with God. He knew God
[43:21] was not God was not a God of history.
[43:24] God was a God of reality to David. When
[43:27] he went out to battle, what did he do?
[43:29] He consulted God. Where should we go?
[43:31] How should we approach this? How should
[43:32] we do this? And God directed and he
[43:34] followed everything God said to achieve.
[43:38] But it came to but but when we begin to
[43:40] hear again when we begin to look at
[43:42] David when David was in the court of
[43:45] Saul Saul got jealous of David and so
[43:48] David had to run for his life and there
[43:51] was opportunities that David had
[43:53] periodically to have killed Saul.
[43:56] One time he was hid up in a cave and all
[43:59] of a sudden Saul went in there to to do
[44:02] his business so to speak and David and
[44:04] and and his men were in that cave and
[44:07] David could have very easily just gone
[44:09] ahead and smitten Saul. But he didn't do
[44:12] it and he some of his his men said,
[44:15] "Hey, let us go. You know, we'll strike
[44:17] him once. We don't have to strike him
[44:18] twice. I mean, he's sitting there as a
[44:20] sitting duck. We'll just take care of
[44:21] it." But but see, David had a David had
[44:24] an attitude. In 1st Samuel 26, we we
[44:28] read, "David said unto Abashai,"
[44:31] "Destroy him not, for who can stretch
[44:33] forth his hand against the Lord's
[44:35] anointed and be guiltless?" David said,
[44:38] "Therefore, as the Lord liveth, the Lord
[44:40] shall smite him, or his day shall come
[44:42] to die, or he shall descend into battle
[44:44] and perish. The Lord forbid that I
[44:47] should stretch forth my hand against the
[44:49] Lord's anointed, but I pray thee, take
[44:52] another spear and and his bolster and
[44:55] and his water.
[44:57] David could have killed him.
[45:00] David could have He said, "I have the
[45:02] anointing oil on me. Saul had anointed
[45:06] me to be king. To be king is my
[45:09] position. To be king is my calling." He
[45:12] could have gotten rid of Saul, but he
[45:15] said, "No, I want God to bring it to
[45:17] pass. I want God to direct my life. I
[45:22] want God to make it so that when I
[45:23] ascend unto the throne, I want it to be
[45:25] in God's will and God's timing." And so,
[45:29] he waited until God brought that to
[45:32] pass. So, this was the attitude we find
[45:34] of David.
[45:36] Another story, another person came to
[45:38] mind was was Joseph. Now, Joseph's
[45:41] another interesting person. We find that
[45:45] that Joseph he was a spiritual man. He
[45:47] his dad loved him. He he loved him more
[45:51] than he loved his other sons. Which made
[45:53] jealousy which made all kinds of
[45:54] conflict within the family. And so all
[45:57] of a sudden, Joseph was given a dream.
[46:00] He said he said, "Hear you the dream
[46:02] which I have dreamed." This is in
[46:04] Genesis 37. For send him, hear me, I
[46:07] pray you the dream that I have dreamed.
[46:08] For behold, we were build binding
[46:10] sheavves in the field. And lo, my sheep
[46:12] rose, and also stood upright. And
[46:14] behold, your sheep stood round about and
[46:16] did obedience to my sheep. They bowed.
[46:20] And his brethren said to him, "Shall you
[46:22] thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou
[46:25] indeed have dominion over us?" And they
[46:27] hated him yet the more for his dreams.
[46:30] And he dreamed yet another dream and
[46:31] told his brethren. He said, "Behold, I
[46:33] have dreamed another dream and behold
[46:35] the sun and the moon and the 11 stars
[46:37] made obed obedience to me." And he told
[46:40] it to his father and to his brethren.
[46:43] And his father even rebuked him.
[46:47] Now God had given Joseph dreams.
[46:51] How were these dreams going to be
[46:54] fulfilled?
[46:57] His brothers hated him. His father
[47:00] rebuked him.
[47:02] How was David going to come to a place
[47:05] in his life where everybody was going to
[47:07] bow to him?
[47:10] Joseph had no idea what lay ahead of
[47:13] him. For in order for God to fulfill
[47:16] what the dreams God had given to him, um
[47:20] Joseph went out and and his brother his
[47:22] brothers took him, threw him in a pit.
[47:23] They were going to kill him, but one of
[47:25] his other brothers said, "No, let's
[47:26] let's not kill him. they' sold him into
[47:28] slavery instead.
[47:30] So he went into slavery and there he
[47:32] potterer uh bought him as a slave, gave
[47:35] him rulership over the house and he was
[47:37] obedient to that. He was obedient to
[47:39] obey his master and then then potterer's
[47:43] wife decided she wanted a relationship
[47:45] with Joseph and so that created issues
[47:47] and from and because she accused him
[47:49] falsely he was then thrown into prison.
[47:53] So he was sitting there in prison and
[47:55] for after a while all of a sudden
[47:57] there's two of of Pharaoh's servants
[47:59] came into the same prison
[48:02] and and and uh he was checking on the
[48:04] prisoners and he noticed these two
[48:06] servants. He says why are you two so sad
[48:09] today? Well, we've dreamed a dream and
[48:12] we don't know what they mean.
[48:14] So just well let me tell me them. Maybe
[48:16] maybe God will tell me the
[48:18] understanding. Give me the
[48:19] understanding.
[48:20] So one of them the butler he says yeah.
[48:22] He says you're going to go and after so
[48:24] many so many days I have to paraphrase I
[48:27] don't have it in front of me but he but
[48:29] he says in three days he says you're
[48:30] going to be restored back to your your
[48:32] position with Pharaoh. He said oh that
[48:35] sounds great. So the baker he gave his
[48:37] dream and and and so the interpretation
[48:41] of that was yeah in three days your
[48:42] head's going to be removed from the rest
[48:44] of your body. And so that wasn't as nice
[48:47] to hear as as the butler. But when but
[48:50] when they were restored back to their
[48:52] position or at least the butler was
[48:56] Joseph says remember me before Pharaoh.
[48:58] I've been I have not I've done nothing
[49:00] to warrant me being in this prison.
[49:03] Nothing.
[49:05] And so when when the butler was there
[49:08] and he was all excited and stuff and he
[49:10] forgot all about Joseph.
[49:13] But then uh a little while later,
[49:15] however long it was, all of a sudden
[49:17] Pharaoh had a dream
[49:19] and he I think there was two dreams. One
[49:22] of them I think it was corn. The other
[49:23] one I think was of cattle and there was
[49:25] seven of them good and and when those
[49:28] the seven years that followed were going
[49:30] to be extremely bad. And so when when
[49:33] when Pharaoh told the dreams to Joseph,
[49:35] Joseph interpreted them and says there's
[49:38] going to be seven years of plenty, seven
[49:41] years of great harvest, seven years,
[49:43] everybody's going to just just relish in
[49:45] in the volume of food which is
[49:47] available. But then there's going to
[49:49] come seven years of total famine.
[49:52] And so you you you know, it's wise for
[49:54] you to start taking during the good
[49:55] years, stock it up so there'll be what?
[49:57] There'll be food to carry you through
[49:59] the famine. And so Pharaoh took Joseph
[50:03] and elevated him to a position
[50:06] where he was next where he was the only
[50:09] one above Joseph happened to be Pharaoh.
[50:14] It was during this famine that that that
[50:17] um
[50:19] I I that the Abraham Abra Isaac I guess
[50:22] it was Abra Abraham. Anyway, I don't
[50:25] have it written out. Anyway, he sent his
[50:27] sons in there to go and and to and to uh
[50:30] go to Egypt, get some food. So, they
[50:33] went there and and as they as his
[50:36] brothers came in, Joseph knew who they
[50:38] were.
[50:40] They didn't know who he was because he
[50:42] had his head all shaved because that's
[50:44] he was that was his position. He was a
[50:46] priest there with within Pharaoh's h
[50:50] domain, if you will.
[50:53] And at that time, the dreams that Joseph
[50:56] had had, he remembered them.
[51:00] He had to go through hell to get to
[51:02] where God wanted him to fulfill the
[51:05] dreams that God had given to him.
[51:10] God has a purpose for all of our lives.
[51:14] He didn't save you just so you can go to
[51:16] a nice place of retirement called
[51:18] heaven. No, he has a purpose for your
[51:20] existence. He has a purpose for you
[51:23] being born. He has a purpose for you
[51:25] living the lives that you live. He has a
[51:27] purpose for the jobs that you hold. He
[51:29] has a purpose as he has guided and
[51:30] directed every single one of you to
[51:33] bring you to the place where you sit
[51:34] today. And if you can go back and you
[51:37] can look at your life, you can begin to
[51:39] understand, you can begin to see the
[51:41] hand of God as it has led you, as it has
[51:44] guided you, as it as it has taken care
[51:46] of you all during a time of your life.
[51:50] If you could look back and you can see
[51:52] God's hand in your life, it should give
[51:53] you courage
[51:55] to place your trust in him.
[52:08] So this is the concept of rest that I
[52:10] that I'm trying to to to to bring to the
[52:13] forefront of our minds
[52:16] because this is something that I I have
[52:18] had to learn in my life.
[52:20] I have, you know, I thought I was in
[52:22] control of my life and I found out as I
[52:24] look back at my life. No, I never was.
[52:28] But I can see how the hand of God I
[52:30] want, I wanted to join with I wanted to
[52:32] become a soil conservationist and I
[52:34] wanted to go out and live, you know, be
[52:35] outside. I wanted to, you know, do do
[52:37] that kind of stuff. Well, I ended up
[52:40] being drafted into the army and they
[52:41] taught me how to be a lab tech. I had
[52:44] never thought of ever becoming a lab
[52:46] tech, but that's what I ended up doing.
[52:49] But I can see how God with my
[52:52] occupation, he has led me and he has
[52:54] helped provide for my family all the way
[52:56] through our life. When we went to
[52:58] Israel, I became the head of head of the
[53:00] lab. I I hired the people. I designed
[53:04] the I I well I wrote out all the
[53:06] procedures for the test which we were
[53:08] going to do. I interacted with them. I
[53:10] encouraged them and we had a good lab.
[53:13] But then when it came time for us to
[53:15] come back to the states, well, I didn't
[53:18] have the degree necessary, but I so for
[53:21] the for the to work in a lab in the
[53:23] regular hospital. So, I ended up at at
[53:25] Tucson General. They there was an
[53:27] osteopathic hospital. That probably
[53:29] doesn't mean anything anymore, but they
[53:31] would take me at a lower uh level, so to
[53:34] speak. I was still a lab tech. I still
[53:36] performed all the stuff, but I had to go
[53:38] back to college and I had to get a
[53:39] degree in order to be able to have a
[53:41] bachelor's degree so I could I could
[53:43] retain my position. Okay. After I got
[53:46] the degree, I found out it doesn't mean
[53:48] anything anyway, but I had to go through
[53:50] it anyway. But we but here but I can see
[53:53] how God led
[53:55] I can see how by me by him leading me
[53:57] into that occupation, I was able to
[54:00] provide for my family whereas before I
[54:02] never would have been able to manage
[54:04] that. And and but but when it comes down
[54:07] to when when when we begin to look at
[54:09] our lives, when we be when we begin to
[54:11] understand
[54:12] h how God will take us and how God will
[54:15] mold us and make us, how how God has his
[54:19] hand upon each and every single one of
[54:21] us, but we don't know about tomorrow.
[54:25] You sang the song, our God reigns. He
[54:27] does, but if you don't believe it, it
[54:30] doesn't mean anything. You sing the
[54:32] song, I don't know about tomorrow. You
[54:34] know, and you talk about trusting in
[54:36] him. No, I don't know about tomorrow
[54:38] either, but all I know is God's the one
[54:40] who's already been there because time
[54:41] has no meaning to him. So, he's already
[54:43] been there. He knows all the struggles
[54:45] I'm going to face. So, if I trust him,
[54:47] he'll lead me through tomorrow and the
[54:50] tomorrows that come.
[54:54] Joseph didn't know what he had to go
[54:56] through for that dream to be fulfilled.
[55:00] We don't know what we have to go
[55:02] through. So that God can bring us into
[55:06] so that God can so dwell in us until he
[55:08] can bring his manifest. So he can so
[55:10] live in us until we become the living
[55:12] manifestation of God himself. You know
[55:15] the Bible makes an interesting statement
[55:18] says we are predestined to be conformed
[55:20] to the very image of Jesus Christ.
[55:24] I keep looking at myself and says good
[55:27] luck. You know there's still a lot of me
[55:30] around.
[55:32] But I also can look back in my life and
[55:34] I can begin to see that he has a process
[55:36] that I have been going through over the
[55:38] years
[55:40] where I have learned not to rely upon my
[55:42] own abilities because the more I find
[55:44] out I don't have any and I can turn my
[55:46] abilities or my I can turn my projects
[55:49] whatever it is over to him. And I find
[55:51] that if I leave if I let him guide and
[55:53] direct he does a better job than if I
[55:55] take over. And so I have learned in in
[55:58] in a lot of ways I've learned to just
[56:00] rest in him. I've learned to take I come
[56:03] up with a situation that I don't know
[56:04] what to do. I says, "Well, Lord, I'm at
[56:07] my wit's end. Lord, you take over from
[56:10] here because I can't do this." And then
[56:12] he does. I mean, you you look at
[56:15] Abraham. Abraham had said, "You're going
[56:17] to be a father of many nations."
[56:20] Um his wife was barren.
[56:23] It got to the place where he was. I
[56:25] think she was 90 or something like that.
[56:27] I'm here. Again, I don't have my notes,
[56:29] so you'd have to take it for a while.
[56:30] You know the meaning.
[56:34] Abraham in his life had reached to the
[56:36] point
[56:37] where Abraham could not perform
[56:41] what God had said you were going to
[56:43] have.
[56:44] It got to the place he said, he he says,
[56:48] you know, I am barren. You know, she's
[56:50] barren. We we aren't we have no ability
[56:52] to have any children at this age and all
[56:53] of the other things which go along with
[56:55] it.
[56:57] But he goes on,
[57:10] Romans 4:16,
[57:12] talking about Moses, there is a faith
[57:14] that that that it might be by grace to
[57:16] the end the promise might be sure to all
[57:18] the all of the seed, not to that only
[57:21] which is of the law, but to also that
[57:22] which is the faith of Abraham, who's the
[57:24] father of us all. As it is written, I
[57:27] have made thee a father of many nations
[57:30] before him who be before him who
[57:33] believed, even God, who quickenth the
[57:35] dead, and calleth those things which be
[57:36] not as though they were. So Abraham, who
[57:39] against hope believed in hope, that he
[57:41] might become the father of many nations,
[57:43] according to that which was spoken, so
[57:45] shall thy seed be. And being not weak in
[57:48] faith, he considered not his own body
[57:50] now dead, as as he was about a hundred
[57:52] years old, neither yet the deadness of
[57:54] Sarah's womb. It says, "He staggered not
[57:56] at the promise of God through unbelief,
[57:58] but was strong in faith, giving glory to
[58:01] God, and being fully persuaded that what
[58:04] he had promised, he was able to
[58:08] perform."
[58:11] And and and and it's in this concept
[58:13] with Abraham.
[58:15] Abraham in Abraham, God had taken
[58:18] Abraham. He went into the promised land.
[58:20] He was in a part of a famine. He didn't
[58:22] like it. So, he journeyed on to Egypt.
[58:24] And God says, "No, this isn't what I
[58:26] promised you. I didn't promise you
[58:27] Egypt. I promised you Palestine." So God
[58:30] forced him back into Palestine. And then
[58:32] God put Abraham Abraham through lots of
[58:35] different trials and tribulations until
[58:37] Abraham came to the place in his life
[58:39] where he began to trust God for
[58:42] everything.
[58:44] He had to trust him for the rain to
[58:46] come. He had to trust him for the food
[58:47] that he ate. He had to trust him when he
[58:49] went out to save Lot, his his his his
[58:52] nephew. He had and he had to come to the
[58:55] place where where he had he came to the
[58:57] place where he so trusted God where it
[58:59] didn't matter what the problems were
[59:01] didn't matter the circumstances he said
[59:03] God had made a promise to me and God is
[59:07] obligated to that promise
[59:10] finally when the promised son was born
[59:14] we find that God told Abraham he says
[59:16] now take your son your only son
[59:19] and take him up to the mountain and give
[59:22] and and and sacrifice him as a sacrifice
[59:25] to me. All the promises to all of the
[59:29] promises to Abraham rested in Isaac. If
[59:33] Isaac did was not alive, all the
[59:36] promises to Abraham were gone.
[59:40] But Abraham took two of his servants and
[59:42] they went and they they into the place
[59:43] where God had showed him the mountain to
[59:45] go up to. And Abraham makes an
[59:48] interesting statement. I and my son were
[59:51] going to go up to the mountain. We're
[59:52] going to worship. I and my son were
[59:55] going to return.
[59:58] But he knew he was going to take his
[1:00:00] son. He was going to put him on a bl on
[1:00:02] a bunch of wood and he was going to
[1:00:03] light a fire under it. He was going to
[1:00:04] reduce him to ashes.
[1:00:08] I and my son were going to go to the
[1:00:10] mountain. We're going to worship God. I
[1:00:13] and my son, we're going to come back.
[1:00:17] How was God going to do this?
[1:00:20] that
[1:00:22] a Abraham did not worry about how God
[1:00:25] was going to do. All he knew was that
[1:00:28] God could and God would.
[1:00:31] And as as Abraham was ready to to kill
[1:00:34] Isaac, God says, "Stay your hand." He
[1:00:37] says, "I know now you trust me."
[1:00:40] But see, this is the this is the place
[1:00:42] we have to come in our relationship with
[1:00:44] God. We have to come in, in my opinion,
[1:00:48] we have to come to a position in God. We
[1:00:50] have to come to a rest in him where we
[1:00:53] sang the song, I don't know about
[1:00:54] tomorrow. I don't know what it's going
[1:00:56] to bring, but but I know who holds
[1:00:57] tomorrow and my God reigns. And we and
[1:01:00] if we can ever if we can ever cross the
[1:01:03] barrier where we look outside of
[1:01:05] ourselves
[1:01:06] and begin to trust in the God that has
[1:01:09] called us. When we begin to realize God
[1:01:13] the God that we serve, the God that has
[1:01:15] called us, he said he he he says our God
[1:01:18] can do anything that there there's no
[1:01:20] limitations to him.
[1:01:23] But we have to believe that.
[1:01:26] Um
[1:01:28] I mean my wife and I I mean we've we've
[1:01:30] gone through things in our lives. I I
[1:01:33] know there was one time we had gone back
[1:01:35] when we come back from India. I mean
[1:01:37] Shirley was she was just death warmed
[1:01:40] over almost. I mean I was in much better
[1:01:43] shape when I asked the other brothers.
[1:01:44] We were in Switzerland for their Easter
[1:01:46] meetings. I told her brother we got to
[1:01:48] pray for Shirley. I says she's really
[1:01:50] really bad sick. They looked at me and
[1:01:52] said you don't look too good yourself. I
[1:01:55] wasn't worried about me. me. I was
[1:01:56] worried about her. So I that's the first
[1:01:59] time I really ever went down before the
[1:02:01] service was and I poured out my heart to
[1:02:03] God
[1:02:05] like I have never done in my life. I
[1:02:08] cried out to God. I says you play you
[1:02:11] have to spare surely if you pull her
[1:02:13] card you might as well pull mine.
[1:02:16] And then God undertook and then she went
[1:02:19] she then and she got well.
[1:02:22] But I but it and there was another
[1:02:24] incident where and I might have been the
[1:02:27] same meeting or a different one. There
[1:02:29] was this lady which was there and she
[1:02:31] had had a problem and I don't know what
[1:02:32] the problem was.
[1:02:34] She'd gone up for prayer and everybody
[1:02:37] prayed for her. And then when the
[1:02:39] service was over, all of a sudden as we
[1:02:41] were exiting the the the auditorium, I
[1:02:45] exited one door which was I don't know
[1:02:47] 20 ft from where she exited. And all of
[1:02:50] a sudden this lady had a spell episode,
[1:02:52] what whatever it was.
[1:02:55] And all the brothers were around her
[1:02:56] praying for her and stuff. And I looked
[1:02:58] at her, I says,
[1:03:00] "What can I do for this sister?
[1:03:03] Can I pray for her? Yeah, that's what
[1:03:06] we're obligated to do. Can I give her
[1:03:09] faith?
[1:03:11] No,
[1:03:12] I cannot give her faith. Faith is
[1:03:15] something that comes from inside.
[1:03:18] Faith is something, Brother Bam says,
[1:03:20] you faith is something you possess.
[1:03:23] But it it and and and it's having this
[1:03:26] faith in God to be able to accept the
[1:03:28] promise of God regardless of the
[1:03:30] circumstances.
[1:03:32] And I looked at could I heal this lady?
[1:03:34] No, I couldn't do it. I realized I was
[1:03:36] helpless. The something inside of her
[1:03:39] had to respond and be able to grasp hold
[1:03:42] of the promise of God to her. And until
[1:03:46] she was willing to grab hold of that
[1:03:48] promise. Didn't matter who prayed.
[1:03:50] Didn't matter how much oil you poured
[1:03:51] over her. Didn't matter nothing. It had
[1:03:54] to come from inside her.
[1:03:57] And within all of us, I I find this as
[1:03:59] as we in different places I've
[1:04:01] ministered, I've come to the same
[1:04:03] conclusion. When you it's like, okay,
[1:04:05] brother Brandham, in one place, he he he
[1:04:07] sent out these prayer claws.
[1:04:10] It's interesting. He gets this letter
[1:04:12] back from this lady, an elderly lady.
[1:04:14] From what I gather, she got the prayer
[1:04:17] cloth. She says, "Fine, now I have the
[1:04:19] prayer cloth. Brother Brandon prayed
[1:04:21] over this. Satan, I'm healed. Now you
[1:04:23] have to leave." And then she got up and
[1:04:26] healing was instantaneous.
[1:04:28] She accepted it. There's something
[1:04:31] inside of her that responded to what
[1:04:34] brother what brother Brandham had sent
[1:04:35] to her. I'm not trying to elevate
[1:04:37] brother Brandon, but he's the closest
[1:04:39] thing to Jesus Christ that I've ever
[1:04:41] seen in my life. So you excuse me if I
[1:04:43] reference him, but I I've come to the
[1:04:46] realization everything the battles that
[1:04:48] I fight. There has to be something
[1:04:51] inside of me that'll grab hold of the
[1:04:53] promise of God to me. And when I grab
[1:04:56] hold of that and I begin to cry out unto
[1:04:59] God, I have to believe he will hear my
[1:05:01] prayers and he will answer that. And he
[1:05:04] has never failed. It isn't always
[1:05:07] instantaneous.
[1:05:09] That's fine. But I know once he has
[1:05:11] heard me, I rest.
[1:05:14] It's not up to me to bring it to pass.
[1:05:17] It's up to him to fulfill the promise.
[1:05:21] And if I take if if we if we pray, oh
[1:05:23] yeah, I believe God heals. Yeah, he
[1:05:25] does. But until you take that prayer and
[1:05:28] make it personal to you,
[1:05:31] it doesn't mean anything. But when you
[1:05:34] begin to say, God, you have in your
[1:05:37] word, those stripes laid on your back,
[1:05:39] you purchased my healing.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; It's a promise you have given to me. And
[1:05:45] now I am claiming that promise. And now
[1:05:48] God is obligated to you for to fulfill
[1:05:52] the promise that he had made. It was
[1:05:55] just a general thing. Yeah. Okay. But
[1:05:58] when you begin to take and make it
[1:05:59] personal, when when you begin to have an
[1:06:01] intimate personal relationship with God
[1:06:04] where God is not something of the past,
[1:06:06] but God is a reality in your life. I was
[1:06:10] raised in a Baptist church. Yeah. Sunday
[1:06:13] school, they taught me all the stories.
[1:06:15] It was great. The preacher was a good
[1:06:17] preacher. Nothing wrong with that. But
[1:06:20] God was history.
[1:06:22] God I you read about him in this book.
[1:06:26] Okay. He seemed like he's a real nice
[1:06:28] person. Yeah, he did a lot of wonderful
[1:06:31] though. God was in here. Yeah, he he did
[1:06:33] a lot of miracles. He did a lot of
[1:06:35] wonderful things.
[1:06:38] When I saw brother Bradom,
[1:06:42] God became a reality to me because God
[1:06:46] was no longer a god of history. He was
[1:06:48] alive. He does live. I've seen him
[1:06:52] manifested in not only his life but in
[1:06:55] the lives of others.
[1:06:57] And I' and as and as I' I've ministered
[1:06:59] to different places, I've seen where God
[1:07:01] by in his sovereignty, he honors my
[1:07:04] prayers at times, not all of the times,
[1:07:07] is praying for others.
[1:07:10] I I know there's been a few times and
[1:07:13] you know, church, they have yeah, we
[1:07:15] have a prayer request and so they read
[1:07:17] off a list of 20 30 people or whatever.
[1:07:20] And so I get up there, but I God
[1:07:22] cautioned me. He says, "If you accord
[1:07:25] pray according to my will, I hear you."
[1:07:30] But if you just pray, it's not that God
[1:07:33] won't hear, but if we know the will of
[1:07:36] God and we pray according to that will,
[1:07:39] God I know will intervene.
[1:07:42] And there's been a few times that that
[1:07:43] we've been praying for somebody and all
[1:07:45] of a sudden the anointing hits, right?
[1:07:48] Take the bull by the horn and casts out
[1:07:50] Satan.
[1:07:52] And from that point on, I looked for the
[1:07:54] manifestation.
[1:07:55] And another in a humorous kind of an
[1:07:58] example is
[1:08:00] um Shirley was uh coughing severely,
[1:08:05] keeping me awake. I mean, it's bedtime.
[1:08:08] We're supposed to go to bed, get some
[1:08:10] sleep. Okay. She was nice enough. She
[1:08:12] went in the front room and she'd gotten
[1:08:14] her lazy Susan and but she was still
[1:08:17] coughing and just keeping me awake. I
[1:08:20] got mad. Not at her.
[1:08:22] I got mad at Satan harassing her and I
[1:08:26] wasn't even nice. I got in there and I
[1:08:28] told Satan, "I am tired of you harassing
[1:08:30] my wife. Get out now."
[1:08:34] She quit coughing.
[1:08:36] She got some sleep. I got some sleep.
[1:08:40] But see, that's the power we possess.
[1:08:44] That is that is the authority that God
[1:08:46] has. When Jesus sent out his disciples,
[1:08:49] he gave them power over unclean spirits
[1:08:51] and all the other things that has never
[1:08:53] been rescended.
[1:08:55] That is still in effect today. But you
[1:08:58] have to believe.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Everything with God is based on our
[1:09:03] ability to have faith in him. And if we
[1:09:06] have faith in him, we know he will do
[1:09:09] what he has promised to do.
[1:09:12] Brother, brother brother Mana makes is
[1:09:14] make he makes this statement says faith
[1:09:16] is unconscious. You got faith and you
[1:09:19] don't even know it. Jesus Christ, no
[1:09:22] matter if he was in a storm and a gales
[1:09:24] knocking the boat from one side to the
[1:09:26] other or he was standing in the face of
[1:09:28] a mess of demons, if he was hanging
[1:09:30] anywhere, never moved him. He walked
[1:09:33] right on just as calm and quiet as he
[1:09:35] could be. Why? He was simply unconscious
[1:09:39] of fear of anything around him. That's
[1:09:42] right. Whether it was going to happen or
[1:09:44] whether it wasn't going to happen. He
[1:09:46] knowed it was going to happen because
[1:09:48] God said so. He didn't say, "I wonder if
[1:09:50] I prayed through. I wonder if I fasted
[1:09:52] long enough. I wonder if I did this." He
[1:09:54] just walked right on unconscious. That's
[1:09:56] right. He believed what God had said was
[1:09:59] true. The words must be fulfilled and he
[1:10:03] knowed that his life was to fulfill
[1:10:04] them. That's right. We say, "Oh, yeah,
[1:10:08] that's Jesus Christ." Do you realize God
[1:10:11] has called you?
[1:10:13] Why did you accept Jesus Christ?
[1:10:17] Because you were a part of God from the
[1:10:18] beginning. I mean, there's lots of
[1:10:20] references I can give you that, but we
[1:10:22] we'll bypass that. But you are a part of
[1:10:25] God from the beginning. God went out
[1:10:27] looking for his children.
[1:10:29] You are his child. I am a child of God.
[1:10:34] I may not look like it. I may not even
[1:10:36] act like it, but still I am his child.
[1:10:39] My parents brought me into the world,
[1:10:41] I'm a Johnson. Good, bad, or
[1:10:44] indifferent, I am still a Johnson. There
[1:10:47] are times that I pestered my mother to
[1:10:49] the point of frustration and I got to
[1:10:52] stand up when I had dinner that night.
[1:10:54] My dad wore my backside out. Okay? But I
[1:10:58] was still his son. That never has
[1:11:00] changed.
[1:11:02] I am a son of God. Do I live perfect?
[1:11:05] No. Do I have faults? Yeah. Biggest
[1:11:09] fault I have generally speaking is when
[1:11:11] I get out of bed in the morning. That's
[1:11:12] when all the trouble starts. Okay. But
[1:11:15] still, I'm his child. That will never
[1:11:19] change.
[1:11:20] He knew what I was like when I was in
[1:11:22] the world. He knew the mistakes I've
[1:11:25] made as I've been a Christian. And he
[1:11:26] know the mistakes I'll make tomorrow.
[1:11:28] But he loves me.
[1:11:30] He proved his love to me at the cross.
[1:11:34] Anytime I need something from him, I
[1:11:37] always go back to Calvary. Calvary
[1:11:39] possesses everything I will ever want
[1:11:43] because that's where I met him and
[1:11:45] that's where I still meet him. I still
[1:11:48] meet him at the cross because there at
[1:11:50] the cross, God has made a statement. He
[1:11:53] says, "I am the very righteousness of
[1:11:55] God himself by being in Christ.
[1:11:59] He became sin for me who knew no sin
[1:12:02] that I might be made the righteousness
[1:12:04] of God in him. He became my sin
[1:12:07] sacrifice that I might become over a
[1:12:10] period of time but through training or
[1:12:11] whatever else that I might become the
[1:12:13] very righteousness of God in him. And
[1:12:15] there's a change that's been going on in
[1:12:17] my life over the years where I can see
[1:12:19] his righteousness every now and then
[1:12:21] actually beginning to be able to show to
[1:12:23] shine through. I'm in a process because
[1:12:26] he was the sacrifice. And so whatever I
[1:12:29] have need of, it's all at the cross.
[1:12:33] Everything is there.
[1:12:41] You guys have heard this before, but
[1:12:42] I'll reiterate it again. It's on
[1:12:44] Habacook. When I studied Habacook, that
[1:12:47] changed my whole concept of faith in
[1:12:49] God.
[1:12:51] Habacook was at a time when God had had
[1:12:54] told Habac, he showed him all the sins
[1:12:56] of the hypocrisy of the priests and
[1:12:58] people
[1:12:59] and God and Habacook got frustrated,
[1:13:02] righteous indignation, whatever you want
[1:13:04] to call it. And he says, "God, why don't
[1:13:06] you bring judgment?"
[1:13:08] I'll paraphrase if you don't, you know,
[1:13:10] I do it anyway.
[1:13:13] He God says, "You know, that's a good
[1:13:15] idea. I think I'll take you up on that
[1:13:17] one. I I think I'll send in the
[1:13:18] Chaldans."
[1:13:20] Oh, no. No. They're not nice people.
[1:13:22] They kill because they like to kill.
[1:13:25] They're going to come in here and
[1:13:26] they're going to make I mean the blood's
[1:13:28] going to flow through the streets.
[1:13:31] But then God came and but then in
[1:13:34] Habacook 2 and 4,
[1:13:38] God
[1:13:40] began to talk back to Habacook.
[1:13:43] And the Lord answered me and said,
[1:13:44] "Write the vision and make it plain upon
[1:13:46] tablets that he may run that readeth it.
[1:13:48] For the vision is yet for an appointed
[1:13:51] time. God has a time for everything.
[1:13:55] I personally believe we're at the end
[1:13:57] time. What end time means, I can't
[1:14:00] define that. When the rapture will take,
[1:14:03] I cannot give you a date. All I know is
[1:14:06] I honestly believe because of what
[1:14:08] brother God had spoken through the
[1:14:09] prophet, I believe we're at the door for
[1:14:11] all things to be fulfilled. When that
[1:14:14] doors will open, I don't know this. I
[1:14:16] mean, I can't give you dates and times.
[1:14:18] All I in myself I feel we're we're it's
[1:14:21] eminent. Okay. But God has an appointed
[1:14:24] time for every he had an appointed time
[1:14:26] for Joseph to become second in line to
[1:14:28] Pharaoh. He had a time for Moses to be
[1:14:30] the deliverer for the children of
[1:14:32] Israel. He had a time for David to
[1:14:33] become the king. And but they all had to
[1:14:35] go through a process to bring them to
[1:14:37] the place where it was in God's timing
[1:14:39] where God began to fulfill the promise
[1:14:40] he had given to them. Okay.
[1:14:44] So he said put in a vision but at the
[1:14:46] end he'll speak and not lie. He said the
[1:14:49] in verse four he said behold his soul is
[1:14:51] lifted up is not upright in him but the
[1:14:54] just shall live by his faith. And as I
[1:14:57] studied that out because this is where
[1:14:59] Paul says the just shall live by faith.
[1:15:01] This is where he refers back to. And in
[1:15:03] the one of the commentaries I says he he
[1:15:06] says he he whose soul is not right in
[1:15:08] him, he places himself in a fortress or
[1:15:11] a tower to set himself on high from
[1:15:13] where the enemy and does not return to
[1:15:16] God nor seek deliverance of him. But the
[1:15:19] righteous has no need to place himself
[1:15:21] on high in a fortress, for he shall live
[1:15:23] by his faith. So some people have are of
[1:15:26] the opinion, yeah, I can do this by
[1:15:27] myself. I don't need God's help.
[1:15:30] God says, "Fine, I'll take my hands off.
[1:15:32] I wish you luck."
[1:15:35] And that's where that's where the
[1:15:37] world's at today. And and I won't go
[1:15:39] into politics, but what is spelled out
[1:15:41] in in in in uh in vers God speaks to
[1:15:45] Habacook and makes him a promise. A man
[1:15:48] by his faith in God shall live. Without
[1:15:52] faith, Paul says it's says at the
[1:15:54] commandments of the Old Testament
[1:15:56] pictures of the great faith in Hebrews
[1:15:58] 11, it's impossible to please God. Faith
[1:16:01] is faith in the creature which does not
[1:16:04] yet see God as one and the same
[1:16:07] principle, a trustful relying belief in
[1:16:10] its creator. This was the characterist
[1:16:12] of Abraham their father unshaken
[1:16:15] unwavering belief in God who called him.
[1:16:20] I saw this in the life of the prophet.
[1:16:24] I see this in the lives of other men who
[1:16:26] have come to this place where they are
[1:16:28] at rest. Nothing moves them because
[1:16:32] they're no longer relying upon
[1:16:34] themselves. They're no longer trying to
[1:16:36] attain it by themselves. I don't
[1:16:37] struggle in my Christian walk. I don't
[1:16:40] struggle to try and become something.
[1:16:43] What I'm doing is I'm trying to die out
[1:16:45] to myself so that the God that is in me
[1:16:48] can live his life out through me. And
[1:16:51] this is the thing. This is what I have
[1:16:52] been been trying to concentrate on for
[1:16:54] the last few years because I c I know
[1:16:57] where I am in Christ. I know where the
[1:17:00] Bible says I should be. I have no way of
[1:17:03] getting from A to B.
[1:17:06] God is the only one that can bring me
[1:17:07] there.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; And I understand that. What will I have
[1:17:12] to go through? Will I have to go through
[1:17:13] like Joseph? Will I have to go through
[1:17:14] like David? Will I have to go through? I
[1:17:16] I don't know. I don't know tomorrow. But
[1:17:19] all I know is I have taken and taken my
[1:17:21] my utmost confidence in God that I have
[1:17:25] committed my life to you and I want you
[1:17:28] to lead and guide the rest of my life so
[1:17:31] that you will get me to where I know
[1:17:33] you're wanting me to be.
[1:17:38] when goes in Habacook when when Habacook
[1:17:40] finally came to the realization of what
[1:17:43] God was requiring of him and he accepted
[1:17:45] that and this is what I had done with
[1:17:46] God. I says you ask Habacook to have
[1:17:49] total confidence in you, total trust in
[1:17:52] you
[1:17:54] where you would give him he that
[1:17:57] Habacook would give you the total
[1:17:58] preeminence in his life regardless of
[1:18:02] what happened. And Habacook, it goes on
[1:18:04] in Habacook 3:16, "When I heard, my
[1:18:07] belly trembled, my lips quivered at the
[1:18:10] voice, rottness entered into my bones,
[1:18:12] and I trembled in myself that I might
[1:18:13] rest in the day of trouble when he
[1:18:15] cometh up into the people. He will
[1:18:18] invade them with his troops." Then he
[1:18:21] goes on, he says, "Though the fig tree
[1:18:22] shall not blossom, neither shall they be
[1:18:24] fruit in the vines. The labor of the
[1:18:26] olive shall fall and the field shall
[1:18:28] yield no meat. The flock shall be cut
[1:18:30] off from the fold and there shall be no
[1:18:32] herd in the stall. Though there be total
[1:18:35] devastation, though he possesses
[1:18:37] nothing, he said, "Yet I will rejoice in
[1:18:40] the Lord, I will joy in the God of my
[1:18:43] salvation."
[1:18:45] And when you read that last verse in the
[1:18:48] Hebrew
[1:18:50] in the King James, it kind of misses
[1:18:52] something, but he Habacook is saying, "I
[1:18:55] will rejoice with everything that's
[1:18:57] within me. I will dance. I will shout. I
[1:18:59] will scream. I I I will I will I will
[1:19:02] worship God with everything that is
[1:19:04] within me because because I've put my
[1:19:07] trust and my trust in him.
[1:19:12] And as I began to look at this and I
[1:19:14] began to realize the different things
[1:19:16] you know in my life and I'm not perfect,
[1:19:19] not by any stretch, but yet I began to
[1:19:21] think about that
[1:19:24] when I look at me, I find an imperfect
[1:19:26] individual.
[1:19:27] I find myself with faults, failures,
[1:19:30] shortcomings. I find myself that I I
[1:19:33] don't always live up to the standards I
[1:19:35] know that God has said. I don't I'm not
[1:19:37] talking about going out in sin, but I'm
[1:19:40] I I'm not living like I know that I
[1:19:43] should all of the time. But yet, I've
[1:19:46] come to a place in my life, Brother
[1:19:49] Brandham says, "It's better for you to
[1:19:50] believe what God says you are than what
[1:19:53] you think you are." And so I make the
[1:19:55] declaration, I'm righteous because he
[1:19:59] said I was. I'm holy because he said
[1:20:03] that I was. I've been redeemed back to
[1:20:06] being a son of God because he said that
[1:20:09] I was. I'm healed because he said that I
[1:20:12] was. I will be conformed to the image of
[1:20:15] his son. Why? Because he said that is my
[1:20:18] goal. That is the goal he has set before
[1:20:21] me in my life. I am to come into the
[1:20:24] very image and character of Jesus
[1:20:26] Christ. I cannot do that. It'll take me
[1:20:31] yielding to the God that is in me to be
[1:20:34] able to allow that God in me to express
[1:20:36] himself fully through me. Brother
[1:20:39] Branderman makes a statement or Jesus
[1:20:42] Christ makes a statement. Jesus Christ
[1:20:45] never healed anybody. You know that
[1:20:48] Jesus Christ never did any miracles.
[1:20:51] He says it's not me who does these. It's
[1:20:53] the father who dwells in me. Brother
[1:20:57] Brandham in his in his life he says you
[1:20:59] know I didn't perform miracles. I don't
[1:21:01] have dreams. I don't have visions. I
[1:21:03] don't have I am merely standing there
[1:21:06] when God does this.
[1:21:10] But he had learned the brother Bam says
[1:21:12] the gift I have is learning to get
[1:21:14] myself out of the way so that he can use
[1:21:17] me
[1:21:19] at brother in at brother Brandham
[1:21:21] another place he says there's three
[1:21:23] things God wanted to accomplish he says
[1:21:25] ones he wants total preeminence in a man
[1:21:28] he gained that in Jesus Christ
[1:21:32] he wants the same preeminence he had in
[1:21:34] Jesus Christ now in his bride
[1:21:38] that is where we have to come total
[1:21:42] preeminence means he has total absolute
[1:21:45] control he is the one leading he is the
[1:21:48] one guiding he is the one that'll will
[1:21:50] provide. He is the one who will protect.
[1:21:52] He will be he is the one who is who he
[1:21:54] is the one who will take us from where
[1:21:56] we are to where he says we are going to
[1:21:58] be. We cannot get there. It'll take him
[1:22:02] to get us there. But we have to rest in
[1:22:06] him. We have to come to the place where
[1:22:08] where where we are willing to to so
[1:22:10] yield ourselves to God until it's no
[1:22:13] longer I who live but it's Christ who
[1:22:16] lives in me. If the musicians would
[1:22:18] come,
[1:22:19] I want us to sing a song. It's called
[1:22:22] blessed assurance.
[1:22:25] To me, blessed assurance, a song is a
[1:22:27] declaration.
[1:22:29] You may not think so, uh, but as you
[1:22:32] listen to what I'm going to do. Yeah,
[1:22:34] it's a declaration
[1:22:36] because I am declaring something
[1:22:39] that I have a relationship with Jesus
[1:22:42] Christ. And it's that relationship with
[1:22:45] Jesus Christ that enables me to do the
[1:22:49] things we're doing.
[1:22:51] I ask God's permission to go back to
[1:22:54] India one more time. We will have been
[1:22:58] ministering in India for 20 years. To
[1:23:01] me, it's a milestone. To me, it's an
[1:23:03] anniversary. To me, it's something that
[1:23:04] I look at and says, "Wow, I want to see
[1:23:07] what he has allowed me to be a part of.
[1:23:10] It's not what I did. He allowed me to be
[1:23:13] a part of something greater than myself.
[1:23:16] And it's in that I and I asked his
[1:23:18] permission. Lord, just one more time.
[1:23:21] Just let me go back. So we could pull up
[1:23:24] the I don't remember all the words.
[1:23:26] Blessed. There we go.
[1:23:30] Blessed
[1:23:34] Jesus is mine.
[1:23:38] Oh, what a forasteast.
[1:23:42] our glory divine.
[1:23:46] I'm the heir of salvation.
[1:23:50] I'm the purchase of God.
[1:23:55] I've been born of his spirit
[1:23:59] and I'm washed in his blood. Stand with
[1:24:01] me.
[1:24:03] This is my story.
[1:24:07] Yes, this is my song.
[1:24:11] I'm praising my savior
[1:24:16] all day long
[1:24:19] because this is my story
[1:24:24] and this is my song.
[1:24:28] For I'm praising my savior
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:32] all the day long.
[1:24:36] Perfect submission,
[1:24:41] perfect delight.
[1:24:44] All visions of rapure
[1:24:48] now burst on my side.
[1:24:52] I see angels descending
[1:24:56] and they bring from above.
[1:25:01] echoes of mercy
[1:25:05] and whispers of love.
[1:25:09] So this is my story.
[1:25:13] This is my song.
[1:25:17] I'm praising my savior
[1:25:21] all the day long.
[1:25:25] For this is my story.
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:29] This is my song
[1:25:33] for I'm praising my Savior
[1:25:37] all the day long.
[1:25:41] Perfect submission.
[1:25:45] I am at rest.
[1:25:49] I in my Savior
[1:25:53] am happy and blessed.
[1:25:57] I am watching and waiting.
[1:26:01] I am looking above
[1:26:05] for I'm filled with his goodness
[1:26:09] and I'm lost in his love.
[1:26:13] This is my story.
[1:26:17] This is my song.
[1:26:21] For I'm praising my Savior
[1:26:25] all the day long.
[1:26:29] For this is my story.
[1:26:33] This is my song.
[1:26:37] I am praising my Savior
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:42] all the day long.
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:46] God bless you.
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:27:01] yet not I but Christ in me. And I'm
[1:27:03] going to ask brother Josiah to do that.
[1:27:06] I think that will fit exactly what
[1:27:07] brother Bose is speaking. Yet not I but
[1:27:10] Christ in me.
[1:27:15] What gift of grace
[1:27:19] is Jesus my redeemer?
[1:27:24] There is no more
[1:27:27] for heaven now to give.
[1:27:32] He is my joy,
[1:27:35] my righteousness and freedom,
[1:27:40] my steadfast love,
[1:27:43] my deep and boundless fear.
[1:27:48] To this I hold.
[1:27:52] My hope is only Jesus.
[1:27:57] For my life
[1:28:00] is wholly bound to his.
[1:28:05] Oh, how strange and divine I can sing.
[1:28:11] All is mine yet not I, but through
[1:28:16] Christ
[1:28:18] in me.
[1:28:20] The night is dark,
[1:28:23] but I am not forsaken.
[1:28:28] For by my side,
[1:28:31] the Savior, he will stay.
[1:28:36] I labor on
[1:28:39] in weakness and rejoicing,
[1:28:44] for in my need
[1:28:47] his power is displayed.
[1:28:52] To this I hold.
[1:28:55] My shepherd will defend me
[1:29:00] through the deepest
[1:29:03] valley he will lead.
[1:29:08] Oh the night has been one and I shall
[1:29:14] overcome
[1:29:16] yet not I.
[1:29:18] Christ in me. No fate I dread. No fate I
[1:29:24] dread.
[1:29:26] I know I am forgi.
[1:29:31] The future sure
[1:29:33] the price it has been paid.
[1:29:38] For Jesus bled
[1:29:41] and suffered for my pardon.
[1:29:46] And he was raised to overthrow the
[1:29:51] grave.
[1:29:54] Oh, to this I hold. My sin has been
[1:29:59] defeated.
[1:30:02] Jesus now
[1:30:05] and ever is my plea.
[1:30:10] All the chains are east. I can sing. I
[1:30:16] am free yet not I but through Christ
[1:30:22] in me.
[1:30:25] With every breath
[1:30:27] I long to follow Jesus.
[1:30:32] For he has said
[1:30:35] that he will bring me home.
[1:30:40] And day by day
[1:30:43] I know he will renew me
[1:30:48] until I stand
[1:30:51] with joy before the throne.
[1:30:56] To this I hold.
[1:30:59] My hope is only Jesus.
[1:31:04] All the glory
[1:31:07] ever more to him.
[1:31:12] When the race is complete, still my lips
[1:31:18] shall repeat. Yet not I, but through
[1:31:23] Christ
[1:31:24] in me.
[1:31:27] When the race is complete, still my lips
[1:31:33] shall repeat. Yet not I, but through
[1:31:38] Christ
[1:31:40] in me.
[1:31:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:46] [Applause]
[1:31:51] Do you appreciate brother null?
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:31:58] I love it when a minister
[1:32:01] can come up here and tell stories
[1:32:06] throughout the Bible and then can
[1:32:10] encourage us to apply those stories to
[1:32:12] our own lives. My brother did that this
[1:32:15] evening. I really really appreciate what
[1:32:17] he said about Joseph, about David, about
[1:32:20] Habacook, and even even about himself. I
[1:32:23] really appreciate our brother
[1:32:26] just opening up and telling us some
[1:32:28] personal things too. Let's bow our
[1:32:30] heads.
[1:32:32] Our father, we thank you.
[1:32:35] Thank you for your goodness, Lord. We
[1:32:37] thank you for the your word,
[1:32:40] Lord, that all these things were written
[1:32:42] down
[1:32:44] so that not so much that we could, Lord,
[1:32:47] look back on them as history and and
[1:32:50] things that you did in the past and you
[1:32:52] did and they were great things, Lord,
[1:32:53] but but Lord, we we appreciate being
[1:32:55] able to apply them into our own lives
[1:32:58] and see as our brother said, the trials
[1:33:02] that Joseph went through,
[1:33:05] not knowing
[1:33:07] Lord, how these things would be
[1:33:08] fulfilled. And he went through a hard
[1:33:10] time, but then Father, you brought the
[1:33:14] dream to pass and they bowed down before
[1:33:16] him.
[1:33:18] Lord, we're grateful. We're grateful
[1:33:19] that you've given us this word of God.
[1:33:23] Thank you for Brother Null, Sister
[1:33:25] Shirley for bringing them to fellowship
[1:33:27] with us for this time.
[1:33:30] Now, Lord, I pray that you'd go with us
[1:33:32] the remainder of this week. Guide us,
[1:33:34] Lord. Protect us so we can come back,
[1:33:38] Lord, at the right time and worship you
[1:33:40] and Father, come together and congregate
[1:33:44] and with those that we love so much. We
[1:33:47] thank you for this opportunity in Jesus
[1:33:49] name. Amen.
[1:33:52] The Lord's willing, I'll give a report
[1:33:54] on Sunday morning about our trip. Very
[1:33:56] successful trip. I was very, very happy
[1:33:59] with how everything turned out. I'll
[1:34:02] give uh I'll give that report on Sunday
[1:34:04] morning and then if we have time then
[1:34:06] we'll continue on with the sermon on the
[1:34:07] mount. God bless you friends. May the
[1:34:10] Lord guide you and protect you, be with
[1:34:12] you
[1:34:14] and I hope to see you Sunday morning.
[1:34:16] God bless. You're dismissed.
[1:34:19] Amazing
[1:34:23] grace,
[1:34:25] how sweet
[1:34:31] that saved
[1:34:33] a wretch
[1:34:36] like me.
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:42] I once
[1:34:44] was lost,
[1:34:47] but now
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:52] I was my
[1:34:56] dad.
[1:34:58] I see
[1:35:00] it.
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:03] The strength
[1:35:06] that taught
[1:35:08] my heart
[1:35:11] to him
[1:35:13] and grace
[1:35:16] my fears
[1:35:19] reveal.
[1:35:24] How precious
[1:35:29] that grace
[1:35:34] be
[1:35:37] I first
[1:35:39] believe.
[1:35:45] All through many
[1:35:48] dangerous
[1:35:51] songs
[1:35:53] and
[1:35:55] I have
[1:35:58] already
[1:36:01] come.
[1:36:05] His grace
[1:36:08] has brought
[1:36:10] me safe.
[1:36:16] Oh, and grace
[1:36:18] will lead
[1:36:21] me home.
[1:36:26] And we've
[1:36:29] been there
[1:36:31] 10,000.
[1:36:36] Christ shineing
[1:36:40] as
[1:36:42] the sun.
[1:36:47] gave no
[1:36:49] less days
[1:36:52] to sing
[1:36:54] God's praise
[1:36:57] than when
[1:37:00] we first
[1:37:02] began.
[1:37:07] Praise God.
[1:37:10] Praise God.
[1:37:13] Praise God.
[1:37:15] Praise God.
[1:37:18] Praise God.
[1:37:20] Praise God.
[1:37:23] Praise God.
[1:37:28] Praise God.
[1:37:31] Praise God.
[1:37:33] Praise God.
[1:37:36] Praise God.
[1:37:38] Praise God.
[1:37:41] Praise God.
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:44] God.
[1:37:49] Oh, amazing
[1:37:52] grace,
[1:37:54] how sweet
[1:37:57] the sound.
[1:37:59] Oh, it saved
[1:38:02] a rich
[1:38:04] like me.
[1:38:08] [Music]
[1:38:09] I once
[1:38:12] was lost,
[1:38:14] but now
[1:38:17] I'm
