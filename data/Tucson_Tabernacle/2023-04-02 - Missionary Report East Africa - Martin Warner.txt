[Applause] [Music] [Applause] come on [Music] foreign God bless you I wanted to share the quick background of the song that we're gonna sing tonight I was watching some video footage from the um Asbury Revival that just happened last month at Kentucky among the college students and it was really encouraged to see so many young people praising God looking for God loving on each other praying at the altar praying for each other and that's a generation younger than myself and I was so impressed by that and it just showed the need for people they want to know the Lord they see the chaos about them well they were singing I heard them sing the song and I knew it it's one we sing and it put me in mind of the Revival of the 70s known as the Jesus movement when a lot of the hippies were saved and out of that movement came a lot of worship songs a lot of uh people that got saved as young people and they began to write songs and music that we still sing today and I was hearing the man that wrote this song tell his testimony of how God had saved him as a young person during that 70s Revival and begin to work in his life delivered him from all kinds of things and he gave him this song and it was the song that the kids at the Asbury Revival were singing and to me I thought that was such a wonderful thing that this generational difference you had this young people in the 70s write the song worshiping God song about spreading the love of Jesus in song and praise and then here all these years later you have another generation worshiping to that same song so I'd like to sing it and of course you can sing it with us if you'd like sometimes [Music] sometimes gently singing [Music] our hearts in one Accord sometimes [Music] sometimes praise the Lord sometimes gently singing [Music] oh let us live our voices [Music] oh let us now return his love and let our voices [Music] let the sound of praise is [Music] sometimes praise the Lord sometimes [Music] outside these walls as we are filled from head to toe [Music] and we want this [Music] sometimes praise the Lord sometimes gently singing our hearts in one core sometimes sometimes sometimes [Music] singing our hearts in one Accord Hallelujah [Music] our hearts in one Accord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we are one in the spirit we are one in the Lord and pray that our Unity may want the peace [Music] we will walk with each other we will walk hand in hand we will walk with each other [Music] we are on the spirit Beyond in the world and we pray that our unity and baby [Music] was on all your Christians by Allah we will walk with each other we will walk [Music] in ahead and never will spread the news that God is in our land and they'll know we are Christians by all my love we are Christians [Music] by our love we [Music] with each other we will rock with each other [Music] we'll spread the news that God is in our land and they'll know this is [Music] we are one in the spirit [Music] thank you [Music] one more time [Music] and we pray that our Unity is [Music] but Mercy Saints are we alive can you hear me good to be in the house of the Lord good to be in the Tucson Tabernacle for my second time in in our in my life and just it's always it's always been you know as far as I can remember something that was connected to Tucson Tabernacle from where I was raised and and I'd like to bring greetings from our pastor brother Ed hammermeister he said to make sure to greet all the the church is the saints that that we'll be visiting and we're happy to do that and brother red is taken over the pastorship since the season brother Hildebrand and we appreciate him and he just wanted to extend his greetings to to brother Dan do the Saints here Brother Martin asked me to send you a song brother Dan preaching this morning and I had mentioned that one of our associate ministers had preached very much the same thing at the home Church it seems that sometimes we'll we'll archive a service from somewhere else and they're preaching to me prison to us so just a simple song I think the key of Siege just called remind me O Lord the things that I love and hold dear to my heart they're just they're not mine at all Jesus holy let me use them to brighten my life so remind me remind me [Music] roll back the curtain of memories show me where you brought me from and where I could have been [Music] remembered I'm human and humans forget so remind me remind me dear Lord nothing good have I done to deserve God's own son I'm not worthy of the scars in his hands yet he chose the road to Calvary to die in my state why he loved me I can't understand roll back the curtain of memory now and then show me where you brought me from and where I could be blue I'm human and humorous forget so remind me remind me so remind me remind me dear Lord thank you [Music] song brother you're a leader to it in the songs my sins are gone and sometimes we think well I've I've been so bad sinned and this there's no forgiveness but trust this will be a blessing to you [Music] let's try to gain my composure sorry [Music] I was sitting alone and wandering about what I'm supposed to do I can't deny the fact I make mistakes [Music] sorry yet I know that they deep within my heart I felt sorry honest I do so I just cried and said forgive me Lord forgive me again so often I'm discouraged when I count the times I fall before he said I'd be victorious when I knew I know at all then I heard an eagle scream his voice quickened my soul you didn't do it in the first place you're Justified justify justify you didn't do it in the first place you just give up justify Justified [Music] you didn't do it in the first place you're Justified thank you he looked at your perfect picture without blame spot or wrinkles he didn't look at you where you are now he said you're just trapped in that body if I passed you with the author knee it in the first place you're Justified sing it with me justify [Applause] you didn't do it in the first place justify [Music] Justified you didn't do it in the first place you Justified one more time justify Justified [Music] [Applause] [Music] he didn't have done it in the first place amen thank God sometimes we talk we talk about reaching out and we talk about winning others to Christ and we forgot that he justified us to let's not forget what our lord Jesus did for us we should always be thanking him for that I have a prayer request here let me make sure I got this right sister Amelia had a prayer request about her grandson and um he he had been in the hospital for a few days and is he out now Sister Amelia is that correct great-grandson praise the Lord I will thank the Lord and and is he kind of out of the woods now so it was a serious time for this infant a little boy and they didn't know if he was going to make it or not right and now he's now he's back home breathing on his own well thank god let's give the Lord a hand you think we thank God for that let's all stand let's continue to remember that little baby in prayer that's the only prayer request I have let's bow our heads and if you would have something on your heart whatever it might be between you and the Lord if you'd raise your hand the Lord knows what's underneath that hand Heavenly Father we approach you in the name of your son Jesus Christ and ask Lord that that this baby Lord that it would be made completely whole you'd continue its recovery and we give you praise for what you've done to this point we thank you father it's good to know that this Baby's got a great grandmother that's praying church that praise to Lord the hands that were raised we pray that you would meet every need Lord where else would we go to lift up our hands to you and say we love you Lord hear our prayers we place these things in the hands of the Almighty in Jesus Christ's name amen we have a special blessing tonight our dear brother martin Warner I've traveled overseas but I'll tell you friends I've never traveled like this brother's travel he goes in as I said this morning into the highways and the hedges our brother goes in and he he does the hard part and I appreciate his testimony I'd like to read one scripture before I turn the service to Brother Martin that is proverbs chapter 25 I believe it's 25 yes Proverbs chapter 25 verse 25 as cold Waters to a thirsty Soul so is good news from a far country I think that's fitting for our brother here God bless you brother martin [Music] thank you amen praise the Lord good to be in the house of the Lord again Amen to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you might forget my name I might forget yours but that's the important one amen there's no other name that's the greatest name there's power in that name there's salvation in that name there's healing in that name there's Deliverance in that name amen and I I just want to thank the Lord for the opportunity of to be here and speak with for the Tabernacle and put my shoulder to the wheel here a little bit if I could help just push this load up this hill amen we're all facing challenges we're all facing you know this age is an age of Insanity pressure stress the prophet said not fit to live in that's what we're fighting and you know it's a privilege to be able to come together like this have Believers of like Precious faith amen and know that there's people praying for you around the world that you don't know of people praying for a Tucson Tabernacle so something's something you know it's it's all a body it's a body move amen amen I think that's all the singing will do thank you we just want to go right to the scripture tonight I wanted to bring you greetings also from the Saints in Edmonton and Spruce Grove where brother Jerry Fury pastors and I'm working out of that church in missions right now and he said to send his greetings and of course you know also from overseas I said I'd like to get down here and see the Saints we tried earlier in the year and just things came up and it just wasn't the right time but you know I had a brother pass away um had some other saints that I knew passed away there was funerals there was travel so you know that it just it just wasn't possible but uh God's time is the best time amen I've learned that you know we can try to force things but when God's timing is right everything's right amen that you can expect a blessing amen so we wanted to uh just bring those greetings also uh we just want to say that I want to thank again brother Daniel just having confidence to to let us share some word and some of the testimonies some of the mission work that's we're doing I know there's other churches doing Mission work around the world they're doing great work you know and but we've just got to do our part if we just do our little part then it's all just one big family amen so let's take our Bibles tonight's turn to Psalms 32. amen I really enjoy it as you're turning to Psalms 32 really enjoyed the message this morning did you enjoy the message for your pastor this morning amen I I just I was just thanking God for conviction that God still convicts my heart when I hear the word not condemns me but convicts me amen so that that it it pushes me it it challenges me to strive to be more sincere with what we have amen so I want to thank brother Daniel for that this morning my heart was just stirred this morning just I thought it was just a great a great message a great you know a great conviction there a burden everything starts with a burden you got to have the burden or you go nowhere right you got to have a burden a passion amen a passion for God a passion for Souls a passion for the church a passion for your brother and sisters amen so that's where it starts and if that's there amen there's going to be progress there's going to be success amen let's read from Psalms 32 and just before we do I want to just ask the Lord to bless his word father as we stand here tonight father we're of course we're Lord humans Lord and as our brothers saying humans forget and we ask you forgive us of our forgetfulness Lord or when we forget you or when we leave you Lord just hanging in the shadows thinking that we have more important things to do father forgive us for our transgressions our iniquities and our failures Lord help us Lord to be Lord more in love with you father help us Lord Jesus to to just draw near to you as we draw near to you Lord we pray you'll draw near to us tonight take the word Lord anointed to our hearts and father may it not just be a a mission report but may it be something that stirs our hearts to serve you more and serve you better walk closer to you in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen Psalms 32 and I want to read from the book of Acts also so Psalms 32 verse 5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee my iniquity have I not hid I said I will not I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgivest the iniquity of my sin for this shall everyone that is Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him Thou Art my Hiding Place thou shall preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me about with songs of Deliverance I will instruct Thee I will teach thee in the way which Thou shalt go I will guide thee with my eye and and the word guide thee means counsel I will counsel you I will guide you be not as the horse or the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held with a bit and Bridal lest they come near unto thee amen we'll just stop right there uh David's speaking there Acts chapter 15. and I just I'll tie these two scriptures together in the report but they just seem to have a connection with me Acts chapter chapter 16 or 15. we'll start 15 verse 36. Paul now an apostle speaking here we'll pick it up in verse 36 and some days after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do and Barnabas determined to take with them John whose surname was Mark but Paul thought it not good to take him with them who departed from them in famphilia and went not with them to the work and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder and from one another and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed unto Cyprus amen so these missionary Journeys there was not always perfect agreement amen now this is after the day of Pentecost right this is after they had the Holy Ghost so we're going to have disagreements we're going to see things a little bit different amen but God works it all out and then God uses each one in their own way that he's determined to use them so I just wanted to bring that out and uh also verse on chapter 16 we'll pick it up at verse 6. now when they had gone through that's a hard one that's a Greek word maybe our brother Lyle could pronounce that one I should add okay well that's easy for that's easy for you to say maybe I should get you off here forget okay you speak it loud Enrique and uh and the region of galatia and were forbidden by the Holy Ghost of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia after they were come now I want to I want to emphasize that they were forbidden to preach the Holy Ghost of the Holy Ghost to preach the word I thought when you're doing Mission work with the word you're always in the will of God well you are but sometimes God wants you at a different place right and so now when they had gone through yes after they were come to Messiah good enough okay and see we spoke uh Hebrew this morning tonight we're speaking Greek and they assayed to go unto bethenia but the spirit suffered them not and they passing through this Messiah came down to troas and a vision appeared unto Paul in the night there stood a man from Macedonia and prayed unto him saying come over unto Macedonia and help us may the Lord bless his word that's that's uh you may be seated that's what I wanted to share as a basis for the report and uh so uh we took this last trip I think it was in uh January February boy I'm forgetting my dates now there's a way a month anyway so uh we got back in the late February the 24th about the 24th so you know we went uh we went in the in the uh in the hopes of visiting three to four countries wanted to wanted to go into Kenya to Uganda also uh into Sudan which is in in the southern Sudan is not as violent as Northern Sudan but there is still chances that you could get kidnapped or taken or ransomed or something but uh so we had these plans there was a brother in Ethiopia taking a minister from Ethiopia into Kenya to to expose them to some of the message churches and he was uh he was introducing him to the message so he had a large Pentecostal Ethiopian Church in Addis Ababa which is the capital of Ethiopia so they were they were coming so we were meeting in Kenya and so uh just prior to us meeting I went through Europe and uh my brother could next slide or next picture this is the continent of Africa can you see that yeah the USA is in there China's in there India's in there amen parts of Europe Germany France Italy um all these nations Great Britain Japan's a small country but all these nations now I can see it here I'm sorry so you know I don't know what the statistics are but I I believe brother Dan you mentioned it one time there's more Believers in the continent of Africa than all North America do you hear that one and a half million in the in the Congo amen so I've been in the Congo and uh yes big churches and uh and some you know some small churches some missionary works and Villages and things like that but you know that that that's you can get lost here for years you you could be in the these these countries for years and never touch it hardly touch it so you know we say you know we're at the end and we know we're close but you know there's there's still people coming in there's still Souls being saved you know if we had just given up years ago then they wouldn't be here now you know like the prophet said when he went past the curtain of time they said thank you for going if you hadn't went we wouldn't be here so they're still Souls being saved there's still work to do you know if if the Lord's coming tomorrow and you're Building a Church build a church you know plan like it's a hundred years live like it's tomorrow so that's why we're still doing Mission work and still still seeing the results still seeing people get saved still people seeing people get healed still seeing people get delivered amen still seeing God do the miraculous amen he's still God God is still God Amen and I just like that you know that gives me a passion for the mission field um uh maybe next next slide we went through Europe and and this is a pastor's two daughters that uh you know they they have a burden for Ethiopia too and are praying with us about that uh next slide brother Olaf rents his wife and two daughters this is a brother my Andreas Mai his wife and his son and and his wife uh also we visited their church and spoke for them um next slide we also spoke for Andreas moringen which uh which is from northern uh I shouldn't say Northern Germany oh it's West Germany instead of the other two brothers were East Germany he was from West Germany and we took the three services there so by the time I've got to Africa I'd already taken quite a few services so you know it just it's just kind of the a springboard for me to go to Africa and I know these churches for many years now over 10 years and we've been speaking and going in to see them and seeing their little Works grow amen and uh we had some really uh move of God here in these in these services that we were with them in um next slide this brother here in one of the services I I really didn't expect the Lord to move the way he moved in those services and just the whole church responded and uh you know I I I wasn't making pulls for alter calls or or prayer or anything but just a whole church responded and everyone came for prayer for one thing or another this brother came up and I've known him for quite a few years I stayed in his home that's where I took the picture when I when I flew into Germany and uh he uh he has he has Parkinson's and when he went through the line uh I didn't know actually I didn't know he he didn't say what it was he just wanted prayer so we were sitting down afterwards having a bowl of soup at lunch and he says yeah he's talking to me and another brother martin Schindler which brotherly sister Shelly no we're sitting together having a bowl of soup and he says you know I just thank God he said you know he's very straight and as a matter of fact he said yeah I have I I don't have any pain now at all he said it's all gone amen so he's he's 70 70 plus years old and he's you know it so age doesn't matter age does not matter God changed Abraham's body when he was an old man amen so uh it's just nice to have his fellowship and some of the other ones that came were touched and next slide Maybe so we left uh we left uh Germany headed for Kenya and um we got there and begin to meet this brother now I don't have a pinpointer but the brother Leon your it would be on your left or no sorry you're right be on your right this one right on this end this is the Ethiopian Pastor that has a large Ethiopian Church in the disaba so he came with the brother on on my right there that's kefa and he's from Ethiopia he's originally from Kenya and uh do you have a marker brother I was looking at that I was wondering if that was right there okay oh okay wonderful so that's brother kefa there uh brother his name is uh it's hard to pronounce uh he calls him humble it's actually humble brother humble so uh so brother humble came to this brother uh Wycliffe and he's the pastor in Kenya one of the pastors there in Nairobi and has a has a large Church there about 700 to a thousand people in his church it works with brother Obadiah and so brother kefir brought him along and we had Fellowship together so a lot of sometimes a lot of the mission work is one on one it's it's sometimes it's just ministering and and and explaining or or you know uh telling them what the message is about so we had some time to sit down with this brother and uh and talk about the message and talk about things that he didn't he didn't really have time to before this meeting to really run him through but now he he has all the message and he's listening to it on the on the on his phone he has all the message so it's just like uh is this like a volcano to him like he's saying where did this come from how did how did this how did we ever miss this you know and he so we talked about his uh you know his ideas and we talked about uh his experience and we let him talk a little bit and no I asked him I said how how do you baptize in your church and he said well we baptized I said do you baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said yes he said we baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost which is the Lord Jesus Christ and I said yes okay that's that's interesting I said so you see the difference between baptism right and he said yes I see it so I I I thought about it and I thought you know he he's very getting very close because in that you know baptism you know it doesn't save you but it's also it's also important because Paul said how how since you believed how were you baptized that is important it is I explained to him I used to live in this in the Strait of cancer so the straight is is a narrow body of water connecting one part of the Atlantic Ocean to the another so I said that that's the gate I said and the revelation of the godhead is in that the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost uh brother Daniel and I were talking about it you know baptism is there's a name associated with it see it's not a title it's a name so I said why don't you just do it the way they did it in the scripture you'll get the same result they didn't add in the name of the father son Holy Ghost because they had the Revelation who the father son to go Holy Ghost was amen so we talked on that a little bit and uh he's studying the message and he's text me since I've been back and he's excited when are you coming back like I can just turn around and go back you know like uh money when we be here we want you to come to our church Ethiopians are very suspicious people have you ever been to Ethiopia brother no very suspicious people and to get into their churches is very hard especially the Pentecostal churches and uh so now there's an open door now there's an open door so once once they get the Revelation is and his brother kefa was preaching uh some of the Revelation to his church in his church and he was talking about uh just Holiness standards and things and you know uh the the sisters were all they had lipstick and makeup and they had I forget what else they had they had pants or whatever and he was he was just preaching you know about the Jezebel spirit of this age and you know his wife the pastor's wife she wipes off all her lipstick she wipes it all off she wears a dress like sir if that's what it is see that's that's that's not condemnation that's not legalism that's that's conviction if God said it then I want to do it amen when I when I came to the Lord my hair was down to here someone said you know about a man having long hair it's a shame unto him well when I heard that I said well if that's what the Lord wants you know if that's what the Lord wants not this preacher but if that's in the Bible if you can show it to me in the Bible then I want to do it I said I don't care if I look like a monkey because I thought anyone with short hair looked like monkey and I I didn't want to look I want to look cool you know like and so uh that was conviction they just started to line right up praise the Lord praise God for that that's a big move in Ethiopia that's something that happened there this time and it was just brother kefa had it on his heart to invite him so we went uh from there let's see I try to stay with my notes um we had good good fellowship with him and uh we got to um we got to share quite a bit with him we went to Brother wycliffe's church I spoke in the morning so he he was able to hear a message minister speak about the word so and how we handle the word how we teach the word how we place the word and so he he came to that service he he said he was really impressed with uh with the church and just with the the the the the spirit of Holiness in the church and the and the response from the church the night before the two nights before when I got to Kenya they put me in a room in a hotel downtown it was a really a shady place I'm always in the hood brother they almost put me and put me in every time you know I didn't even have a fan and all I want is a fan you know if I can have a fan I don't need the air conditioning if I can have a fan I'm happy so there was no fan and I had picked up something from Germany and it was uh maybe on the plane because a lot of people you know coughing and things and I I got a little chilled over there after the meetings and I picked something up I started to cough a little bit and when I got in that room I'll tell you it was just so hot and uh they had a sound system outside it was a weekend and they started to play their music and they like music they were like loud music so it was coming up through the cement walls and up into my room in the in the in the hotel or whatever you call it there so they uh I asked them you know can you move me can you do something it went through all the night like it was five in the morning when they stopped that was a Friday night so then they put me in another room Saturday I went went through the same thing you know and I was getting it was harder and harder no sleep I was getting run down and uh so it was just as it was just such a dumb demonic presence like like you you just all the old songs see one thing for me that I have trouble with is music because of my background the 60s and 70s those years of of the that rock and roll and things like that so I I knew all the songs like as they were going I was like oh no not that one you know like and I knew how it was going to go and all that stuff and I said oh I started to think about it you know I was thinking oh Lord deliver me why don't you why don't you just curse those speakers if you just blow them up Lord just or just send a win do something like I was really trying to pray that God you know just fighting that battle and finally I just thought well I'll just put on my phone I'll put on my phone I'll play my music that that dulling it a little bit but it was just tormenting and so I got to church on Sunday morning they stopped at probably five or six a.m Sunday morning and I and I'm awake through the night and you know what I preached on music I said I'm gonna give that devil a black eye so I I've preached on music I preached on technology I preached on that and you know I just I just and so you know they the the strange thing was because Satan knows you know how he knows how to torment you he knows your past he knows your weakness he he he's got a Punch Coming the prophet said right so he at the end of their evening they started to sing uh I wrote it down here they played all my life you have been faithful all my life you have been so so good you know in a in a fast rock and roll upbeat you know songs you hear in message churches demonic songs all night and then and then towards the end they're playing religious songs and I knew that's a devil that's just a devil and he's so religious they know all those Satan knows all the music you know so I I talked about music and uh you know and how how cunning he is and how he started in Ezekiel amen that the the you know the artificer or Genesis the artificer of brass and musical instruments and Ezekiel where he walked up and down in the fire and the stones he created this as his phone this is Satan's smartphone this is the knowledge of Good and Evil so I kind of really hit that and because I was just I was just ready for a fight you know I just wanted to you know if that was bothering anybody else I was gonna I was gonna preach deliverance and you know people got delivered people got delivered there was two souls two young people came forward give their hearts to Christ were baptized right there hey man maybe next slide I don't know if it's in that in that next slide that's his church and then uh it's a big church next slide that's our brother Wycliffe the musicians next slide there's one of the young people getting baptized amen so two Souls twenty thousand worlds amen twenty thousand morals and you're part of it amen when you send someone when you when you support Mission work it's important amen because we're not going anywhere without them and what if you were that last one wouldn't you like to hear amen and so praise God for that I just thank God for that we had a couple baptisms there a great move of God there too and we were able to share share the word with them there so after the service right after the service I lost my voice it's a funny thing when you lose your voice you know you're just Whispering like a baby and and you know you sound like a someone that's you know in between voice changes when you're becoming a man you think you're a man but you're not and you're like you know it was just really embarrassing I was trying to talk to the ministers and they were hardly understanding me but I said I you know I I don't think you know we were supposed to leave the next day uh by bus to Uganda and uh you know because you know you can't you can't always afford to fly around the continent you know you just those brothers are rugged Brothers they can take a lot of a lot of rough roads and uh but I'm getting older and I I kind of thought with my condition so I talked to brother uh Stephen and Bali in Uganda and Stephen was willing to accept me there he wanted me to come but he said I would not go with these brothers on a bus it was a four to five hour supposedly five-hour bus ride the two Kampala and uh it it turned out also brother Wycliffe he said don't no don't go on that bus not in your condition So I listened to the I listened to their counsel see I will guide Thee I will teach thee sometimes we need to listen to somebody else you know and I said you know what you Brothers know the country you know what's going on here it took them 16 hours by bus with no air conditioning and it was hot Kenya was hot and you know it's it's like here in the summertime right so it's uh I just and they were and brother KF told me he said we were just wore out you imagine me coughing like I was coughing and no voice and and sit in that bus for 16 hours it just it just wasn't happening you know so God forbid me God forbid me how do you forbid me he changed my circumstances and and I and I I got up the next morning there when I sent them off I said you Brothers go ahead I gave them an offering good offering to cover all their expenses and you know that that have something when they got home for their families and you know they were they were they were encouraged they were you know they were just let's go and they went and they did some ministering with uh brother humble's family over there in Ethiopia or in uh uh Uganda and some of the message churches in Kenya so they went ahead we went we separated we went different ways and I I didn't know what to do so I just I was praying about it I get up in the morning and I read that scripture in in Psalms 32 be not like the horse or the mule you know we we don't we don't want to be just work horses you know we want to be thoroughbreds thoroughbreds you know they're they're a different breed right they're a different breed of horse and I think I spoke to you about Secretariat here did I speak to you about Secretariat here how Secretariat won that triple crown you know I was I was sharing that with the Saints in Phoenix you know it just the horse knew how to run his own race the Holy Ghost knows how to run it but we're trying to force it and we're trying to steer the Holy Ghost the prophet said you don't use the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost uses you if we can just get out of the way he knows how to run the race amen and so I just thought I'm just going to step back here maybe God is just wanting some fellowship this is not the way I thought it was going to go our thoughts are not his thoughts you know our ways are not his ways and we're writing Saints we're writing another book of Acts this is our book of Acts now we're writing a book of Acts we're hearing testimonies here amen you're hearing testimonies in your churches just just God is doing things and we just have to be aware and sensitive to turn to yield to step back amen and not not want our way you know the songwriter say I want your ways to be my ways along this road so I just stepped back and I didn't know what to do I text brother Daniel when I was there I was just I was just texting brother I was talking to brother Stephen and Bally I just needed some help I mean I was down you know Paul left one of the missionaries sick and he went on his missionary journey he said I left him sick and not that he not that he didn't pray for him but you know sickness sometimes there was a reason for that by the way too if you look up that that disciples name he was a Greek and and there was a lot of trouble because he was Greek and he was going into some of the synagogues with Paul and that starts a riot Paul had some trouble let's see God for some reason didn't want him to go so uh we're we find the same thing in the mission field today like it's it's fraught with uh disappointment and and and troubles and you know uh sorrows and you know sometimes sickness it's not it's not it's not Hollywood it's not Hollywood it's not it's not a vacation amen when you're sick in in Africa like I didn't want to go to a hospital I did not want to go to a hospital not there no I wasn't going there I just had Brothers pray with me and I was just going to tough it out and that was that was God too that was Supernatural the way that happened and how I recovered from that but you know um you know after we after I'd prayed and I just thought you know I just need some I just need some help I'm I'm down and out I'm here alone and on the brothers I've gone on so I thought you know I just came to me I'm gonna I'm gonna call my best friend so I call my best friend and I said you know this is my situation I could hardly talk which what what do you think I should do you think I should cut the trip short just come home and she said [Laughter] why don't you go to Malawi why don't you go to Malawi and why don't you call Brother Harrison up you're just two hours by playing call them up so I did and he was overjoyed he was just saying we were praying he told me before he left for Africa he said remember Brother Martin Malawi is your home he said don't forget us now you're going over to Kenya you're going over to these places you don't forget us it was like a warning you know and then I called them up he says Oh Brother Martin yeah you come over we're waiting for you and you know so I was able to go to see brother Harrison in in Malawi he met me at the Capitol um and uh you know he took care of me he you know he just nursed me nursed me back I mean I've been on the mission field with brothers that were so sick they should have been in the hospital and God miraculously with a little sugar and water just a little prayer and a little you know keep them out of the hospitals if you can and and don't leave their side if you can't if you can so we we went to Monkey Bay and I was sharing that with brother Daniel went to Monkey Bay monkey Bay is is on Lake Malawi and uh so he was gonna we're just gonna stay by the by the lake for a few days just to recover see you know um healing is not always miracles amen healing is a process it's little by little I I was the last time I was here I don't know if I was telling you about my arm I had an operation in July when I was here I had an operation when I went back I was going back for an operation I think I shared brother Aaron father and I shared with you on text and I I was scheduled for that operation so there was some waiting period so I thought well I'll just come down and we wanted to come down that time ourselves so we just came down and and we spoke here at that time I think did we speak in July anyway I went back ready for the operation and uh because you know I had separated the ligament from the from the the bicep onto the bone on the main bone and it had snapped it was very painful I picked up a load that was too heavy and it just snapped and I couldn't hardly use my arm so they said no you the surgeons the specialist said you need an operation and if you wait eight weeks we can't do it so I just thought well within the six weeks I'd still had that time I could come down here so I came down here and uh we went back and then they asked me the question for the operation D have you been out of the country what do you say yes yes I've been out of the country I've been in the U.S and they said well now you've got to wait another two weeks for a coved so that put me over the eight weeks and the surgeon said this is going to be tricky it's going to be deeper a deeper cut and and it's going to be tricky I got to take you got to take a ligament off your leg or or they Supply one and he said it's going to be a lot trickier a lot longer operation and so I got you know he said I'll do it and so I thought you know I wasn't afraid of it but uh I was I was just I didn't have any other direction you know and and sometimes we have to let the Lord work these things out anyway I'm giving you this testimony because you know God is the same yesterday today and forever if it's in Africa or if it's here amen and I I just said well you know I'm going to take it anyway and uh you know you got family and you got pressure they all you know want to want to kind of yeah you better do this and I wasn't afraid of it so I I just went in and uh they prepped me for the operation they painted your arm you know they know you know so they don't cut the right one right I'll cut off the right one so they paint you up and then they put the IV in you for the anesthetic and so I was laying there and I watched this other guy come out and he he had all his fingers cut off and and they had wrapped it but it was bleeding from the thing and I was just looking at that guy going but I was thinking I'm going in there and I'm thinking oh Lord deliver me so I thought you know this this this Believers from uh Grand Prairie had called me and it's one believer said uh you know brother martin we're praying for that operation and you know but God could touch you before the surgeon touches you and I said brother you know I said if you got that face I'm with you you know because I don't have it but I'm with you see you know brother Branham said you know you won't stop anyone from believing something that I can't believe see that's what we do we can't believe it then they can't believe it no they could believe it they could believe it for you and so I just said thank you you know I believe it too I said I believe he can do that I said but it's just the way it right now it's I'm going to take the operation so I got in there and a surgeon of an intern came out just as they're going to wheel me in and he said oh can I look at your arm again and he looked at the arm and he examined it he dug in there real good with his thumbs and he said do this do this do this do this he said you already got healing he said you don't need an operation Hallelujah you don't even need us he said I'll call the head surgeon and you want to talk to him I said sure and they agreed the two surgeons agreed so he said no there's a change Hallelujah healing is a process don't get discouraged and I mean it can feel worse but it's a process and if you can do that for my arm he can do it for my hip brother he's the same God amen and so I don't know how to get on that but it just you know I don't know how that happened but just uh healing Deliverance the same God is doing those things in Africa is doing them here and when we we serve the same God of the Prophet amen the same with the god of Elijah we serve amen and and we can believe for all things so um anyway we we got to Malawi maybe we'll go ahead on the uh oh I can do it right here right yes yeah this is Brother uh wycliffe's Church some of the Saints there and brother humble and brother kefa again that's the grace of God Hardware isn't that nice yeah yeah everything is grace of God or you know and uh that's now we got to we got to uh monkey Bay and we're down it's down time it's it's recover time as you can see I need it so uh this man this brother here this young man his name is lucky his name is lucky and he was the nicest young man he ran kind of a bar at the at the along the lake there where we were and we got talking to him and uh we're dealing with him and he gave me his he just started to open up and share things you know he's uh now I'm listening to him he knows the Bible like and he's a clean young man he didn't even drink but they just need work so um we got to share in the word with him a little bit and uh he wants to be baptized amen amen amen really nice young man his wife is a Christian probably denominational Christian but she you know she'll say he said she tells me when I go out and I spend some money with my friends and I go and have a drink or something and she'll tell me you know what can I pray for you today how can I pray for you and and and just convey he said just convict me convict me convict me amen thank God for that amen so when he ran into us and then we we give him the word amen he he just really responded so I think brother Harrison's going to be baptizing him so you know Paul went on a journey one time he went down by the river and he met one sister Lydia seller of purple and that one convert had house meanings that's where the church started so Mission work is sometimes one on one but I never would have been there if God hadn't turned me around and said no you're not going where you thought you were going and and you know who knows what we were saved from what what violence you know we we don't know we don't we don't anticipate that but there's always challenges so brother I call him brother lucky amen so we had a storm there on the lake and some trees came down by our huts and but we were spared and uh my Hut was spared anyway I had a I had a boat I get up in the morning it was about half an inch to an inch of water on the floor just where the wind and the rains come across the lake it's like an ocean and and it just those Huts are not waterproof the roofs are but the windows it just comes right in and the Thunder is sold those tropical storms it just shakes the Earth and uh so we get up that morning that that next morning well we're not going nowhere you know so we just we just had to stay there and witness to Lucky and eat good African food amen those are the huts that's what they look like and they're well constructed it's just it's just some of it's old so I just want to give you a kind of a flavor and that's what happened and we get up the next day going to drive and that was those are the roads those are the highways and these people are you know lost a lot of people lost their homes but by the way before I forget this was prior to the cyclone in in uh March 12th the Cyclones hit Malawi just after I left here and they had devastated it was horrific it was just they you know I think there was 11 brother Harrison said they were they counted 11 Believers that lost their lives and uh you know a lot of other people lost their children if you saw the the mudslides in in blend tire that the the whole side of the mountains come down and the houses are gone and and of course we did that we were in that in 2019 and we did some relief in that then so it's just a constant you know it's just a constant challenge for them and they've you know they've devalued their currency so they're just you know even the Believers they're just crying out you know come Lord Jesus come they're they're crying out you know Saints we got it too good sometimes what I wonder if we don't need a little more of a squeeze you know and and then when that starts to happen then they they're just they're just crying out it's just like it's too hard to to even imagine like I had the pictures and I think I sent some pictures to some friends and some ministers and things but it's I didn't bring them here it's just too hard to look at it just it's too hard and uh but you know they're Believers and you know we can help in word and deed we can do something you know anything we can do so um we're trying to do that some of the stores and places that were flooded then this is not the cyclone this is just a monsoon kind of heavy rain and that's what they that's what they deal with so we we went to uh while we're in Monkey Bay we went to this church and when we were young people in in Edmonton with brother hillebrandt as young people we packed books and we sent them off to far away countries and we didn't know who they were going to or any anywhere they were going to but some of them were going to Monkey Bay and when I got to Monkey Bay I said there's a church here I want to go there so we went to Monkey Bay and uh uh I had his name written down but I forgot its name now the pastor anyway we met the pastor his wife we came in I was still a little bit hoarse but they you know they they put pressure on you you want us we want you to say something we want you to speak so I you know God give me back my voice at that service give me back my voice so I was able to get going a little bit there and encourage them that's their little that's their little church in Monkey Bay that's the pastor in his wife and they greet you in the name of the Lord they greet you and then you have family over there I told them I said you didn't know you had a white brother in your family I said you didn't know that said that I we we as young people we we did something we we went over we we did something you can do something young people you do something for God not know what the church is going to do for you or what are you going to do for the church what are you going to do for God you can do something you can help here in the church anything so anything we we could do we wanted to do so these are books that were sent from uh South Africa brother Gideon retief I don't know if you know you'd rather get in yeah brother Gideon and I've met brother Gideon I've been in Johannesburg and uh he sent 2400 Church age books free of charge Transportation the whole thing you know the transportation from Durbin is like 2000 U.S just the transportation and he just before he passed now brother Gideon had passed in a heart attack just just about a month now and we were on a road actually brother Ringin who I met in Germany who's taking brother Ron Peterson's meetings here at the anniversary he went to help with the funeral and we were talking about brother Gideon and how good a friend he was and you know how how much Mission work they had done him and his father Willie retief and uh here we go here we here's here he's gone just gone just just like that none of us none of us have a mortgage on life none of us have next week Saints let's wake up let's shake ourselves Let's Make It Count now if we can do something tomorrow if we could if we could smile if we could give a kind word if we can you know find an opportunity for a soul let's do it amen we might not be here next week next month next year amen so we uh just really appreciated that brother Harrison was just just heartbroken when he heard you know he had gone but you know he just he just flew away he just beat us all there amen and he had a had a great testimony for the Gideon and uh I just loved his ministry so they they they received those I wanted to take a picture of those at brother Harrison's place this is another brother we he uh wanted me to see his name is Julius and he came out of the Pentecostal Church some maybe five years now and he's his church is growing this church was destroyed in 2019 and we had a meeting there the roof was caved in and we were kind of just with the walls and and so brother Jerry had sent some help the pastor in Spruce Grove by the Jerry Fury and uh we put a new roof on it amen so now they got a new roof he was so happy and you know he was just thanking us and he wanted us to see the church and so we did and and that's him there that's brother Julius and uh I call him Julius Caesar and I I always got a name for everybody you know like when I get there like John the Baptist or this is John the Baptist this is Julius Caesar and he's he's a he's a fireball and uh he he's he's really loves the word he loves the message and his church is growing so he said you know what I need he said you know I need a sound system because the Muslim down the street the Muslim Church they got these big speakers and then they you know yeah you know six o'clock in the morning is it is it six and five or something like every day like okay now I know what time it is you know he said they have theirs if I had a little sound system he said and a brother in brother Jerry's Church he's he's good with technology he said I can get that I know what to give so there you go you know he's going to have his sound system and he wants some cement on the walls so that water see the trouble is there with their buildings the water washes the mud away you know if it's bricks and mud it's going to wash away but if you've got some purging on it then that keeps keeps it from so he's kind of now he's proactive right and he's just putting those little things in you know but if we could just have this you know so we were trying to help him out in his church this is a brother Dixon's condojis original Church in blantire so we want to have some meetings there my voice came back and so we were taking meetings of brother brother Dixon's old church which is now owned by the Salvation Army um we had good meetings there and a lot of people responded now I I just thought this trip had turned out different so it turned out different than I thought I thought I was going to be in Kenya I was going to be in Uganda I was going to be in Ethiopian churches I was going to be and it turned out I was in local churches in Malawi just local meanings not a convention not but it was just a special special time and the church really responded there was many Souls gave their heart to God here and the rededications and people standing for their loved ones standing for backsliders you know coming in and I found that my whole trip there was people coming for prayer standing for someone else and I just said this is a this is like a theme you know this is like that you know we're getting close Saints it's time for them to come in it's time for the backsliders to come back amen and I just thought wow God is doing something and uh you know in Germany also see the same the same thing happening in Germany people standing for for brothers and people in prison and lost children and uh just it just was so good to see the response here we had a wonderful meetings here in in blanter and uh it just this is where the last time we were there and they had the tent meetings outside and then there was about 5 000 people and the tents blew away you know I shared that didn't I with you amen and God stopped that storm and it went right around blantar because we spoke it I said you know and and so you know the expectation just expectation Saints we need expectation it's not all for them it's for us we need expectation God you know when I come here Sunday morning listen to brother Daniel I want expectation you know I I just don't want to be you know well what's he going to say now you know or you know I want expectation God you're going to speak to me you're going to give me directions I will guide you with mine I ministering spirits to them that'll be heirs to eternal life and that's that's what we have so we had wonderful meetings there again in blantar uh you know I just I just kind of heard that voice you know the reason why this has happened he said God said I want fellowship with you I want I want to walk I want you to walk with me remember the prophet was up on the mountain and that voice spoke who who who who would not say that brother Brandon walked with God the the life he had the Supernatural and he saw all these things happen and visitation and angels and and yet God says now I want you to walk with me in in the power of the Resurrection in a body body change that's what happened to brother Branham on that mountain he had a body change amen he saw himself young again right so that's how God wants us to see you know he he looked at your perfect picture right he looked at it and he said he still it's still beholding the face of the father that's what I wanted to speak to you that really opened up to me in Africa and it's time for these things now it's time for it's time for a body change it's you know if you're satisfied with a good church then brother Rand just said stay there but if you believe there's more I'm not looking for just a good church I'm looking for a new body amen I am brother Daniel I'm I'm tired of this pest house amen I want to change and so we uh we left we left there we had meetings there and I emphasized God wants your fellowship amen God wants your fellowship every one of you he wants your fellowship you know not just the pastor's fellowship or you know some other other person's Fellowship he wants your fellowship and that really came real to me that God said no matter how I got to stop you how I got to slow you down I'm gonna get your ear I'm going to get you listening to me and I I heard things and things opened up to me that never opened up to me all my life and the message since I come in the message I had some questions that just one after the other just done done done oh that's how that fits that's how that fits I don't need to go around preaching it as Doctrine but I know myself there's you know we have the answer to the devil's questions this message it's laying in the message rapturing faith is there amen so uh you know we're getting so close to that now to that body changing you know so we had we went to melange and that was my heart's desire when I got there I thought it's just like my home Church there it's right below the mountain there and it's a small it's not a big church it's a smaller church but everyone comes from different places from it's close to Mozambique and so they all come in there and that's one of my favorite places to go and we had meetings there is that a is that a video brother is there a video on there I don't know if there's a video that might not be it but anyway we were in this little church and had meetings there it was hot I mean they are from there and it's like the oven you know I know I'm in for a bake a bake house like really this is going to be a hot one my tie brother Daniel I've never thought my tie was dripping water like it was and I was just a blotch you know but I thought you know after God had healed me I wanted to say Satan you're not stopping me amen nothing will stop me now and uh we we had a great service there in that in that little church and again we had maybe 12 15 Souls amen praise God praise God amen and the deacons would baptize him later so you know it's rot sometimes with difficulty and obstacles but you know the last one is going to be an expensive one amen it's going to be a lot of effort and it might not be we're not looking for crowds we're looking for the last predestinated seed that's what we're looking for and we were able to share with that share the share the word here this is a little school this is an old school building two school buildings that brother Harrison just put a down payment on and he's going to connect those roofs and he's going to make a church for that area so he's a go-getter brother and he's like he's a contractor he's like he sees potential and you know and uh you know I was telling brother Dan a little bit bro brother Harrison he's you know he's been he's been robbed he's been cheated by even even believers Take the Money and Run and you know and put his own livelihood in there a place that he could have bought his own house he put it for a church to build a church and it was taken from him taken right out from under so you know this kind of guy he is and uh you know that's why it's good to be to be there they still need apostles you know a missionary the prophet said is an apostle and and the prophet said an apostle is a Setter in order so you need things sometimes set in order and uh in in blantire when I got there there was a Minister's meeting on printing books in lantire there was some confusion some issues on translation and books that were being already printed shipped in from other countries that were that were not saying what the prophet said or it was Lost in Translation we were speaking about that today how easy they told me the ministers told me one word Brother Martin and tachiwa can change the whole meaning of the context and he said that's what it's doing so we need to tell these brothers you know to to change that so they were trying to you know get some ideas and we worked together and we had some we had some constructive uh meetings there and some issues were settled and I just told them you know you know don't don't try to go and correct other people's mistakes and waste time and energy you do what God tells you to do you do what God puts on your heart to do and if God puts on your heart to print them here not in China don't freedom and shine friend I'm here put them right here in your own country and that's what they're doing amen they're gonna they're gonna do more I mean uh there's a lot of people getting behind it because it's then they have oversight all the elders they they know what the message says right they know English but you know 50 percent no chichiwa in Malawi so it's a 50 50. so they need they need the correct translation and so brother Harrison is working with the brother from voice of God Saeed he's working with Syed he's he's got all the templates and uh you know I said why not do it here just do it here so they've been doing it now the last year and a half two years so they got the church age if they got the seals printed there they've been interpreted already but they're redoing them because there's more and more people coming in there's more and more churches that when the last left the last time in 19 after I'd left there was 17 more churches started now try to Pastor them try to send pastors out try to try to support them try to help them with books try to it's just the beginning so you know there's there's so much to do amen and uh so brother Harrison's doing that we went to the long way on the way home just before I went home I was flying out of the Capitol spoke for brother uh Wilton mccandawar and he's been a he's been a stalwart and steady brother he's just a he's just a big teddy bear is what he is he's just he's got a real soft nature although he's intimidating too and uh he he was just so Overjoyed we spoke there on some things I'd like to share with you and I never seen him so excited so he's he's planning on some meetings in December some some bigger meetings in December so we want to pray about that and go back to his congregation there he took me to this place that's that's the monument they just put up in the last five years or so to uh Banda and I forget his first name now Dr Banda they call him he was their first president in Malawi And he as a young man he he left Malawi walking to South Africa he walked from Malawi you you drove it so you imagine walking he walked from Malawi to to South Africa as a young man he got on a boat I don't know how he got on that boat but he got on that boat and he sailed to America and he sailed to America he started working as a laborer in America and you know what he had a he had a vision that he could do something great you know Saints we need a vision without a vision the people perish we need a vision that God God wants to do something great God wants to do something great in my life he does he wants to do something great in your life and I was just telling that to a young man in Phoenix amen and you know it I think there's two people going to be baptized there in Phoenix so I mean you know I said God wants and and Satan's just trying to suppress you and press you down and give you complexes and I said you know you you have you ever been baptized in the name of no I haven't I heard it all my life my mother told me I said you need to get baptized that's it that's that was a key you don't you don't go any further until you take a step you got to take a step and and and that came up but uh he when he walked to South Africa he got on that boat he came to America he started working as a laborer shoveling labor work and his boss saw his work ethic remember the the the slave that was the King's son he saw his his work ethic and he said you know what he said you need to go to school so he he said I'm going to pay for you to go to school and he paid for him to go to school to become a doctor he got into medicine and he finished up in the UK he finished his studies in the UK came back to Malawi and ran against the the government that time was more a dictatorship but it was it was used to be Swaziland and anyway he ran to become president and he became president he was he was he was educated in Indiana Jeffersonville Indiana he was he was he went to University in Indiana so then he could becomes president and then uh all of a sudden needs these people in politics you know wherever the president goes they have like a celebration and they have the women dance for the president and the Believers wouldn't dance and they said you got to dance and so they were back and forth they hauled them into into into jail and intimidated them and then they start putting them in jail and separating the mothers and and the children and you know and these are believers they're all in jail they're going to jail and brother Dixon he was one of them he said well I'm going to jail too if you take my flock I'm going to go with with them so he was in jail and they were getting converted in jail even with the lice and all the rest of it you know and and so this president got wind of this these people that were believing uh the teachings of William Branham he got wind that they were in jail he said let those people go said don't bother those people those are real Christians because he knew brother Branham he knew about brother rand's message amen so you know as a young man God used him in the secular World in politics but he used him to deliver God's people Timothy said first of all there should be prayer supplication intercession for all men and those in authority that we might lead a Peaceable and Godly life amen so because God want that all men be saved so what he did there for the Believers and I just I knew that history and I said I want to see I want to see that and so he took me down there and we enjoyed that Fellowship so we emphasized uh like I said we emphasized God wants your fellowship that was kind of the theme during the during those meetings and he that is within you amen so other issues came up um you know like there's always issues and I was able to ordain certain elders and I think I ordained 12 Deacons and ministers and trustees and treasurers and you know they just all want to come and and get get ordained and so it just was everything just the just everything hit at the right time see and I didn't have any of that planned I like that when God leads then it's the right time dedicated a lot of babies and things like that at those meetings in in milanji so after this we traveled from the long way back to Kenya for our flight home and then there was Brothers realized I got my boys back so they wanted me to speak down there and I said no I don't I'm going home it's been a month now and I'm I'm going home and uh so I just I I saw the hand of the Lord all the way through but the brother Wonder Brothers that were in Kenya he got to uh he had a small uh Uber business and I wanted to support him so I hired him for a day and and we had breakfast and dinner and he drove this around uh kind of the it's not the Safari but it's just it opens up to to uh it opens up in uh Kenya in Nairobi the Safari opens up to the city actually the Lions can actually get in there and there's been a few get in there there's no fences right but they'll they'll stay keep their distance but we were just driving in his Uber thing or through the through that area and uh we saw these beautiful animals and I just thought I'd show that for the for the children if there's any here but uh you know we had a guy with us and and I read the scripture I will guide you Saints thank God for a guide you know how the prophet preached the guide when he touched that line oh I'm saved my wife is saved my family's saved amen because I got a hold of the line amen and this little guy he was oh Abu was his name and uh he was just terrific young guy exuberant and loved animals and he was telling me you know they they all the older stripes are all different you know that how many knew that a zebra stripes every one of them is like a fingerprint he said every one or different I said no he said well yeah you should know that he said I probably should but we don't see no too many zebras around around Northern Canada so uh anyway I just start looking at their stripes and I was thinking yeah yeah they all are different you know and we're all different we're all different striped we're all different Natures we have our quirks and our quarks and you know and this God loves us just the way we are and uh so I got to see some zebras just you know I was God was just giving me some down time after the meetings and I just I just so appreciate it see the prophet said in things that are to be God has everything prepared when you came to the Earth he had everything prepared now now it's the same in our lives he has everything prepared we just need to follow in the channel and prayer is the key to get into the program of God right so he we just need to wait on God wait on our ministry some beautiful animals there and uh we just saw them like right up close too this one here was killed right as we were there two lions and we we didn't see them then we looked in the ditch and we saw them hiding in the ditch they had just killed him see them hiding up there and they were just resting from the the guys that know they're resting now from the kill because they're young lions and they had to be when they're young Lions they're pushed out of the of the herd right there were two siblings a brother and a sister and they're pushed out so now you go hunt on your own so they they went out and they they got this uh this wildebeest I think it was and see they're hiding there and we're only like 50 feet and and the windows are down and I told her brother I said I'm not really that comfortable with the windows down like what if this thing fails right and and they're they're actually looking at some other animals on the other side of us something if they come charging and you know your imagination goes and they're going to be in the car with us you know it could get messy you know like I don't know if I have enough Faith sometimes I just said let's err on the side of caution and roll the windows up because there's no air conditioning right so anyway they're watching and see he just sees his mouth is all bloody and he's just he's just resting from that kill amen the Lord God has spoken amen the lion has roared amen surely the Lord will do nothing but he Reveals His secrets to the servants the prophets amen so I was just kind of we came up on that they were eating as they as we were there they were eating one of these they just caught one of these and they were flipping it over and eating it as we were watching so that was the that was just the appetizer and then he said no they wait till the evening then they get the wildebeest then they go to him but they're just just just kind of having an appetizer here so I thought and this one they try to pull down but he got away he was so strong see the other ones the ribs were showing so he was weak but this one this one they couldn't get him down see they were too young so this one was powerful and that just happened when we were there so then we were just driving by and all these animals you know like I never got to see this before and it was kind of nice like I don't go on the mission field for safaris but God gave me a little Safari and a in an old uh Toyota small little Toyota and I just thought thank you Lord you know you got to see this is the Undertaker and he's waiting for the kill and when they're done he just kind of just walks around you know looks around he's like and he said no he's the Undertaker so he cleans things up so and this guy the guy told us this uh this an ostrich for any of you that don't know little children at the back that's an ostrich and that's a that's a male ostrich and he's dancing for the female ostrich and the male that can dance the best he's the one that gets the female so they put on a real show man like you talk about dance wow they can dance I thought wow he said no that's what they're doing that's how they win you know no dance no wife so so he you know he told us things that we didn't know they would sit down in the bottom and then get their wings and then just put all dust over themselves it's so they're just waiting for the rain see how dry it is and when they do that he said they're cooling themselves off so I just started to appreciate this guide you know the things he was saying and he made us laugh and you know he just he just he just knew so much that I thought you know a guide is important you know you can you know and you pay him 20 bucks and he's so happy 20 bucks I said let's buy him lunch let's do this for him let's do that for him you know it it was just a blessing to have him in the car talking to us and you know we wouldn't have picked out some of these things I thought they were rocks he said no they're they're that's hippos there let's look a little closer so you zoomed in sure enough they're just and the alligators um alligators there the when I was in Monkey Bay I did get into Lake Malawi once just to cool off in my clothes and I almost drowned but when I saw the sign this time that said swim at your own risk and there's a big alligator there I thought no not this time no I'm not no matter how hot it is I'm not going in that water and uh so they know how to do it but that's that's Nairobi and and this and that's open to open to the animals also this one here I saw just before I left that is a mamba snake and he is you know I expected him to be an ugly really ugly he's a he's a he's a Slicker he he looks good like when he moves and stuff like he's so subtle and uh you know that the mama snake brother Brown talked about you know it was on that Highway and that's what I preached on I preached on in Kenya I said the information Highway that's what he was on that's what he's on today he's smart the children of this world are much wiser in their generation than the children of light amen so I thought I want to see one up close so they they they had these and then they had other snakes that you could put on you and and they wrap around you sort of thing and everybody was oh let's try it let's try it I said no thanks and they say oh you're scared and everything no I'm not scared I just don't like those guys you know I don't want to be associated with them so I didn't put on any snakes but he was he actually that was only a different angle but he's actually good looking sin is beautiful sin is beautiful and that's the deception it can be so beautiful you know the way of a snake on a rock right the way of a man with a maid you know so so many things are so wonderful for me and Satan is worshiped in Beauty and I just thought in the animal kingdom you know you can see all these things and being in Africa but I'll just end with that scripture Isaiah 6 and 8. you know who who will I send who will go for me my brothers mentioned this morning you don't need to go to Africa you can go downtown we can go downtown we can be like brother Marshall have have a day where you can feed some poor people right get together do something young people you can do something and it's right here you know America needs missionaries leaning missionaries here yeah we're so Heathen now we you know you talk about church people don't even go to church now you know so I just thought uh you know that's that's how it ended but I wanted to bring something on that uh I just had a little experience coming down and I know I've been long coming down we've passed through Montana and the Idaho border and we saw we saw the Seven Peaks that brother Branham talked about when he came from Canada hunting and and he he mentions it in standing in the gap you ever read that message standing in the Gap how many read that message amen and I just I never thought of that and I thought this somewhere along here honey I said this is where uh brother Branham saw those Peaks oh yeah so just the last Ridge before you come into Idaho last mountain range so sister Shelley she said they they look like ghost mountains and they were just pristine in the snow beautiful and sure enough my wife did I take the picture you I took the picture and I took the picture of that mountain range just in case we came down and we compared it it was exactly the same Mountain amen and you know you know what what God is speaking to me all the way down is you know you had a prophet we had a prophet that stood in the gap and he wanted to go do his own thing up in Canada and be a be a guide but you know he had to give that up he wanted to hunt president Daniel he loved hunting and he loved those things and he had to give that up that was his desire and he said you've got to let that go and uh so you know I was thinking I wasn't thinking about it really and then as I thought about it I said I'm going to listen to that message and and sure enough when we were driving then we were driving down the road after we saw that and I didn't tell my wife but my heart was jumping I I could scream I could shout I just felt the Holy Spirit like he said brother Daniel this morning when you came in here and you looked at the lights just that presence came and I couldn't tell her I couldn't tell her but I told her later something happened I said we you know we're on the right Road God said you're on the right road I don't have to push you now I don't have to push you through a pipe you'll just listen and you say go down here and speak these meetings and then go back then I can go and do that amen and I I didn't tell anyone else but I I just it was so strong it was just I I just hardly contain it just crying under my sunglasses and trying not to show anybody but you know that presence we had someone Saints in this generation that stood in the gap and that's what you know we all have complexes we all have our own desires our own plans but his our ways are not his ways our plans are not his plans sometimes amen so if we're just sensitive like that thorough bread amen then God can lead us and we'll let him lead us and and souls will come to the kingdom and when we let him do it amen I wouldn't have any success over there they wouldn't have even received my testimony those I wouldn't even got into those Ethiopian churches but in Malawi I did so you know God has a reason and I just want to thank my wife for coming with me this time amen without her there'd be no Ministry she is part of my Ministry and uh if it wasn't for her I wouldn't be here tonight I can tell you that amen let's stand and musicians come I'm sorry I kept you so long and uh we'll we'll see what the Lord does on the weekend or during the week share some things with you if the Lord is willing whatever the Lord wants amen um do you know that song I want what you want dear Lord no I want

he said it's not in God's mind it's not there he's beholding your theophany tonight and your theophany your word body has never sinned just think of that Saints as we surrender Our Lives tonight to Christ and just thought about this morning it was so beautiful and I believe God wanted a surrender there was conviction here this morning and it's not shouting it's not a loud service but when it's quiet that's when God is dealing well you were dealing with us this morning you're dealing with me Lord I my big thing was I was selfish with my time I wanted my own time I was selfish in my life you dealt with me about that being selfish father I just I give it all to you Lord and the Saints tonight whatever you have to give to God Just Surrender it as we sing that again Pastor comes prays with us to whatever he feels led to do and you surrender that thing as we sing that make it a dedication tonight in your heart let God move in your life and be under expectation that God's going to do something God's going to do something great God has a great plan for you for each one of us for this church God has a great plan we just need to fall in line with it God help us Lord help the Saints
