TRANSCRIPT
========================================
He's a winner. &gt;&gt; He's never lost a battle. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that he's I don't know if I should say I'm on his side or he's on my side. I think it'd be better maybe to say he's on my side because there's been been many times I wasn't on his side. &gt;&gt; But he's always been on my side. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Our Father, Lord, you're in heaven now and we pray that your will would be done here on earth as it is [music] in heaven. Lord, we love you and we thank you for the opportunity once again to gather together. And Lord, pray that as I answer these questions, Lord, that the wisdom of the Holy Spirit would be upon me. And father that we would leave here more knowledgeable and more understanding of your word in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. God bless you. Brother Joe, which one is this? &gt;&gt; That's my handsome one. Stephen, &gt;&gt; look at you with the haircut. Brother Stephen, you look good. God bless you. Good to see you. Haven't seen you in a little while. Good to see you. God bless you. [applause] I got my haircut and uh everybody laughs when I talk about anything on my hair. Um &gt;&gt; yeah, [laughter] right. Uh it feels good. It feels good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Um I wanted to continue on a little bit with the sermon this morning. And I mentioned um about social media and I mentioned about saying things on social media and then sharing those things and even commenting on those things on YouTube. And I I mentioned this one pastor was I I heard him commenting about some things that were being said um about um just about the pastor of the Bram Tabernacle, Joseph Brandom, and uh calling him names. And you know, you may not agree and we may not agree, but what in the world are we doing insulting each other on either side? That is nothing but childish. &gt;&gt; And yet we lift ourselves up to be the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; And we say things on both sides that are demeaning and really just ridiculous. And friends, I say that we never we should never insult each other. And sometimes it there is place for rebuke. Paul publicly rebuked certain people. You can still read it in your Bible where Paul called out people by name. There's nothing wrong with that. But when we call when we insult or when we call names or when we say someone has an antichrist spirit, even if it's like I said this morning, even if it's the pope, come on. Don't do it. That is lowering ourselves to a place that is beneath us. So friends, I don't think that we should ever do that. Never. I think we should uplift uplift people. There is a place for correction. I mean, I brought a lot of correction this morning about how we need to be careful in sharing posts and saying things. I said that and and I I mean it. So there is a place for correction. And there's a place for correcting error, but there is no place for insults. Jesus said, "Call no man Raqqa." The word raqa, I've heard a different a few different translations for it, but it's an insult. And Jesus said, "Don't do it or you're in danger of hell, really." So, we should be careful. Social media is a it's a scary thing. Uh, Sister Andreana shared with me a a post that uh has happened over the is it the past few weeks, past couple weeks? P started Friday night and it was so it was shared Friday night and it's Olivia, your children's school district and uh it's it started in a small Facebook community. If uh um Abby, could you put that picture up there? This picture right here. And what it is is um it's some some teachers and they have this shirt on that's obviously meant to look like blood stain on the left side of their shirt. And the first thing that we think of is what many education related professions are taking a stand against this man Charlie Kirk. He was shot on the left side. He bled out on the left side. And here we have a bunch of teachers up there with a shirt that has blood poured down on the left side and it says problem solved. Wow. &gt;&gt; Absolutely horrible. Horrible. Am I right? And this starts being shared and it started in a small Facebook community and then it went viral on Tik Tok, went viral on YouTube, went viral on Instagram, different social media platforms. If you go to the next picture, already and quickly rebuked by even the Arizona House of Representatives. They write a letter rebuking what this was, saying, "We do not stand for this and telling the people basically that these people making fun of the death of Charlie Kirk is an absolute, my words, an apostasy." However, however, go back to the previous picture. The picture of that one. Let me read what was said to sister Andreana. Dear Veil, parents and families, remember this is this is ten, thousand th thousands and thousands tens of thousands of of shares and and comments about this death threats to the school district for them making this stand. Here's a letter Sister Andrea re received when when did you receive it? Yesterday. Dear Veil parents and families, we're writing you to inform you about a situation that has been circulating on social media involving members of Sienna High School math department. A photo showing teachers wearing shirts that say problem solved has caused confusion and concern. We want to clarify that these shirts were part of a math themed Halloween costume meant to represent solving tough math math problems. The shirts were never intended to target any person, event, or political issue. Unfortunately, the image is being shared online with false claims that they were intended as a statement of recent events in our country, referring to Charlie Kirk. This is unequivocally untrue. The shirts were purchased online and were also worn last year as part of the same math themed costume long before the recent events. For anyone questioning the validity of those shirts were questioning questioning the validity that these shirts were worn last year, I'm happy to provide you with a with a photo. We understand how this image could be misunderstood and taken out of context, especially by people who are not associated with the teachers or school. We are truly sorry for the hurt or upset it is it has caused it has caused. The teachers involved care deeply about their students and community. Many have served Veil Veil family for years and many of them and all of them are committed to our children and none of them would and then it cuts off but none of them would do anything like this. Do you see taking a a picture like this? I mean, it's Halloween, so it's like I mean, it's a bit ill- advised as far as having a bloody shirt, but it was referring to a math problem. Problem solved. And it's a Halloween costume, so they have blood. Last year, people saw this and they made the jump to saying that they're making fun of Charlie Kirk. Death threats. I mean, this right here, this post, uh, at the bottom of that one, I Yeah, right at the top, it says, "Fire them all." Taken out of context and misconstrued. Do you see how powerful our words are? It could ruin these people's lives. And that's um that's the dangers right there. So I I wanted to wanted to continue on with that. I wanted to mention that. Thank you. You can take it down. Not the best choice in shirts, you know, but certainly not didn't have the wrong intentions there. Um, I wanted to I want to talk about tithing and I want to talk about a one question that I received and this one will be a short answer and uh this one I just got um a few days ago. It says why don't we stand for the word of God? I assume that the question means why don't we um when I am ministering I probably about 70% of the time I will pray and then have the congregation seated. The reason I do that is because it's just my style of ministry is I want to greet the people that are here and I want to say a few words. And my ministry is a whole lot of reading the Bible. So, I'm not going to have you stand through my whole sermon. It just it wouldn't it wouldn't work. Um many churches have the tradition of the pastor taking the pulpit and then remain standing and reading a scripture and then going into the sermon which is a great tradition. I think it's very respectful in standing for the word. I I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I can there's there's places in the Bible like in I think it's Ezra where when Ezra opened up the book of Moses all the people stood &gt;&gt; for the in respect of the word and I think it's very very it's very respectful thing to do but then there's other places in the Bible when they sat so it's with and then I think with a message mentality many People may remember the quote that brother Brandham said, "We stand for the flag being raised. We stand for other things. We can stand for the word." However, very rarely did Brother Brandham have people stand for reading the Bible. And I'd say, I just did a quick search. Maybe 10% of the time, maybe he did that. Most of the time he did it like I do it. He prayed and then had them seated and then he talked for a little while before he got into his sermon and didn't have them stand again. So, um, and I think we have to be careful with tradition. If we get too involved in tradition, even if it's a good tradition, in standing in reverence and and and doing um doing the same thing over and over, there is nothing wrong with me taking the platform, praying, opening my Bible, and reading a scripture and then saying, uh, be seated. Nothing wrong at all with it. However, if we do that every time and you know kids, the people grow up in this church and you go to another church that doesn't do that. It's human nature because it's different. You're going to think it's wrong just because that's the that's your tradition. That's the way you've done it. And I think we have to be careful in doing that. Just because we do it over and over does not make it right. It just is what we do. It's just a tradition. It doesn't make it wrong. But we have to be careful in that mindset of thinking that because I grew up a certain way or like I said this morning about just because we hear something over and over again, it makes it to where we think that that's what's what's the right way in our minds and it might not be the right way. With me, it's and it's just it's my personality. It's the way that I am. I don't like to do the same thing over and over again. I like change and and I see everybody's faces. It's like, hey, we're going to start doing a construction project over here. Like, oh, what is he going to do next? Messing up everything again. [laughter] It's just friends, change is part of it. And I know that most people are not comfortable with change. I understand that. But sometimes we have to change to grow in the Lord. Okay. So, I wanted to uh so why don't we stand for the word of God? Um it's just not the way I do it. I do it sometimes. Um but it's just not the way I minister. It is the way brother Lyall ministers. He usually does that. Um Brother Null did that the other night and I like it. It's good. But it's not a must. We don't have to do it that way. Okay. So, that's that's uh my answer to that question. So, now tithing. Uh there's three things. I'm going to go through a bunch of scriptures. There's three things that uh by the way um for the visitors, I've been going through uh the um some questions that the congregation asks. And um one of the questions that I've received multiple um notes on is how do we tithe? What is the proper way to tithe? And as I read these scriptures, as always, I want to get every all my answers from the Bible. As I read these scriptures, I want you to remember three things. The first thing is God is first. That goes for tithing and that goes for every aspect of our lives. God is first. The second is tithing is not a business contract with God. You don't tithe so you can receive. All right? You you don't tithe as in prosperity gospel that you can become rich. &gt;&gt; You laugh. That's a very very common thing. Brother Joe says you're sure. I'm going to look how much and see how much you tie. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'm just kidding. By the way, I have no I have no idea how much anyone does. [laughter] I'm not privy to that information, nor do I want to be. There's there is one time that I will ask if someone tithes, and that is if there's a problem in the church and someone needs help, I will ask the trustees, does this person pay tithe? I don't care how much but if they do then I I feel like the church they are part of the church and the church has more responsibility for them as I said I could care I don't know how much anyone does and I don't know who does the only time I will ask is in that certain situation um so so the first thing is God is first the second thing is you don't tithe so you can receive listen Jesus Christ died on the cross and he gave you something that you could never repay. Tithing is just honoring his word to provide a place for uh to serve God here in this church. With that said, that there there are blessings with tithing. And then tithing, the third thing is tithing is an honor and it should be something that we want to do. &gt;&gt; All right. So the the the first thing as I was putting this together this afternoon, God is first. Tithing is not a business contract with God. And tithing is an honor and it's something that we should want to do. First, let's define tithing. We we use that word so often u but it has a very um it has a very specific meaning. There are places in the Bible where uh that where portion was given to God was 10%. There's other places in the Bible where that portion was 20%. That I found. And then there's one place that I found that it seems that that portion was 30%. However, the definition of tithing is 10%. Is a tenth. That's what the word means. All right, let's go to Genesis. I'm sorry I didn't give you any scripture verses. There's a lot of them. So, just Is it you, Abby? Just try to keep up. Genesis chapter 14, verse 19. I'm going to read the New King James Version. Then Melzdc Genesis 14:19 Then Melzdc king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was the priest of the most high and he blessed them and said, "Blessed be Abram of God most high, possessor of heaven and earth. And blessed be God most high who has delivered your enemies into your hands." Now Abraham is coming from the the slaughter of the kings and he he had he had taken the bounty and he gave him a tithe of all is the next verse. Uh verse number 20. And he gave them tithes of all is what the King James says. Many translations I'd say about half of them say one10enth of all. Both translations are correct. The word tithing simply means a tenth. All right? So when you say that I tithe 20%, no tithing is 10%. So you tithe 10% and then you give another 10% extra. But the very word tithing means 10 means one/tenth. And the uh one of the questions that probably the most common question received that I've received over the years on tithing is do I do I pay on gross or net as far as my income? And [sighs] basically, do I pay after my taxes have been taken out or before? I always lean towards paying on the gross because I think that we put God's God first. But really, I always want to make those type of things up to the individual. You know, your own personal situation. You know what you're capable of doing and what you're not capable of doing. But as a minister, I would encourage I encourage you to study it, but it looks very much to me like the gross number is the proper tithing number. But again, I I leave that to you and to for you to pray about it and you to make your decision on that. God first. All right, that's our first. We want to put God first. Let's go to Malachi 3:8. You know, it's really neat. We talked about divorce and we went into the book of Malachi and it really gave us our answer. And now we're going to go to tithing and it's going to give us our answer again. Do you remember the book of Malachi? It's a really really interesting book and it's a dialogue between God and man. And what was happening were was the people of Israel, they were putting God last. So maybe in their tithing, they were saying that, "Oh, I have uh it takes me $50,000 a year to live. I make $52,000. So, I will uh let's see, we have $2,000 extra. We'll pay tithing on that because that's what I have extra. Or, and this was specifically mentioned, they have a flock of sheep and they say, "Okay, well, these uh I I see this sheep over here. It's kind of deformed. It's not a very good-looking one. I couldn't sell this one for very much at the market. I'm gonna take that lamb and I'm going to give that one to God because I can spare that one. And the book of Malachi is just back and forth with this dialogue and they're saying, "Well, how have we cheated you? How have we done these things?" And he's pointing out that, "Hey, you listen, you're giving me the worst. You should be giving God the best." So Malachi chapter 3 verse number eight it says this will a man rob God here's the dialogue yet you have robbed me but you say in what way have we robbed you in tithes and offerings two things remember tithing is 10% offering is also there you are cursed with the curse, for you have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Now, into the storehouse, friends, we when you bring tithes in and when you pay your tithes here to the church, it comes in into um the fund that pays for everything. It pays for if there's renovations that need to be done. It It pays for the electricity. It It pays for any type of rent. It It pays for the instrument in instruments. It pays for everything that we do. All of that doesn't just come out of thin air. It comes from us giving. And that's how a church functions. And that's why it says here, "Bring these tiths that that there may be food in my house." It's saying that support the church with your tithes so then that church can in turn support you and support others. And try me now on this, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you such blessings that there will not be room enough to receive it. Now, I want to stop there for a moment. This is not, as I said, this isn't a deal with God. You don't pay tithe so you can get rich. Prosperity gospel says if you give, if somebody will give a $100, you'll get $1,000 with a certain return. If somebody gives a,000, it'll be 10,000 and all of that. That's notice he's not talking about, he doesn't say money. He says you're bringing your tithes in, but he says that you are going to receive blessings from this. And I'll get to that in a little bit later. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, so that he will not destroy the fruit of your ground, nor shall the vine, nor shall the vine to bear fruit for you in the field, says the Lord of Hosts. and all nations will call you blessed for you will be a delight land says the Lord of hosts sayaeth the Lord of hosts. So he's saying that you're going to be blessed. God's saying to put him first and he always says this. This isn't just in tithing. The scripture isn't just about just giving tithes. The scriptur is about everything in our lives. If we will put God's first, God first in our decisions, &gt;&gt; we'll be blessed by it. &gt;&gt; Last week, we talked about Malachi and how God listens to our conversations with our wives in our private rooms. Put God first in your relationships and he'll bless you. Put God first in your job and he will bless you. Put God first in your tithing and he will open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you such a blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it. All right? He might not be talking about money, but put God first in your tithing and you your life will be better. All right? I mentioned about working out your finances. Don't work out your finances and say, "Okay, we have this much to give to the church." All right? Maybe with offerings you do that, but with tithing, put him first. &gt;&gt; All right? Take that out first. Genesis chapter 28 verse 20. Let's read this. This is really good. This is Jacob. And he had this vision. Then Jacob rose early in the morning. And Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put at his head and set it set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethl. And he called the name of that place Bethl. But the name of that city had become had had been loosed previously. Then Jacob made a vow, saying, 'If God will be with me and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on so that I come back to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God." Now, Jacob isn't making a deal with God right here. He's saying, "If God will give me a job to support myself, then I'll be able to return it." Then then the Lord shall be my God. And this stone which I have set which have set as a pillar shall be God's house shall be God's house. And all and of all that you give me I will surely give a tenth to you. Very very important thing says here and of all that thou shalt give me. So Jacob is saying that everything that I have, my job, my money, my donkeys, everything that I have, you gave me. It was yours in the first place and you gave it to me. And everything that I have that you gave me, now I will give a tenth to you. So basically paying tithes, paying a tenth on everything that God has given. Notice that the the vow he's not making a deal with God. He's saying that like you young people when you get a job, Justin, when when you when you get a career and you get set, you say, "Lord, if you give me a job, I'll pay my tithes. But if you don't have a job, you can't pay your tithe because you don't have any money coming in. All right? This isn't like a um some sort of a deal where if you give me more, I I'll I'll um if I give more, then I'll get more. And then one of the questions that we often get is that tithing is not mentioned in the New Testament. So therefore, we shouldn't tithe. And that that question has come quite a bit or you should give. But tithing is not necessarily ne that not necessary. And really some things don't need to be said. Some things Jesus didn't have to say because it's said so much in the Old Testament and tithing is all through the Old Testament and we should know that we're supposed to do this. Just common sense tells us that we're supposed to. But with tithing, it actually is in the New Testament. And I'll give you a place. Matthew chapter 23:23. Now listen to this. Matthew 23:23. This is for the people that say that tithing is not in the New Testament. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. For Jesus was straight. These were selfrighteous people. And and he's like, "Listen, you guys are hypocrites." And I was talking with somebody the other day about how Jesus, he was he was very kind and he loved the self-righteous people. He loved them just as much as he did the the woman that washed his feet with her hair. He loved them all. And he loved these proud, egotistical, self-righteous people. He loved them. And it looks like the way the only way that he could get through them is to really hit them and say, "Listen, you think you're all that, but you're a hypocrite. Wo you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites." He's trying to lead them to the Lord here. He's trying to lead him to himself. For you pay tithe of mint and annis and coming and cumin and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, justice and mercy and faith. All right, here's the key. These you ought to have done without leaving the others undone. So he's saying you're paying tithe. You should have done that. So he's agreeing with paying tithe, but he's saying, "But you're leaving the other stuff undone, the the bigger, more important things. You're leaving that undone, and you're just going through the rituals. So let's let's get now let's go to the prosperity gospel." And there are blessings associated with giving, just as there's blessings associated with prayer, blessings associated with going to church, blessings associated with repentance. But there is nothing that we can do. There's nothing that we can bring to the table to barter barter with God. John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but shall have life, everlasting life, eternal life." There's no, we could never pay for that. We could never enter an agreement enter into an agreement with God saying that well if I give this then you'll give this listen he gave everything and we have nothing to give. So, you hear pastors, you hear preachers, and I've heard them over the years calling on the people. He said, "The Lord," many of they've said, "The Lord is is telling me that somebody is supposed to give a $1,000 or or brother, if you give $1,000 and God's going to reward your business, or he's going to double the size of your income next year." That's not right. &gt;&gt; When you give tithing or a gift, then you no longer have that gift. you no longer have that tithing. It was given as a sacrifice to the Lord, not as a business deal with God, not to not to promote yourself or prosper yourself. It's got to be a sacrifice. It's got to be something that hurts a little bit. It's got to be something that like in Malachi, don't give the lamb that's not worth anything. Give him your very best lamb. And that's that's with this ting. And I've seen the mistake over and over through the years. And even I've had family members say that, you know, I want to be rich or I want to prosper. So they'll give everything that they have to the church with the expectation that they're going to be even more have even more later on. Or they they'll they'll sell their house and they'll give the the the money to the church. While that might show a lot of faith, it doesn't show any wisdom. Now, you don't have a house and you've given all your wealth away for really for personal gain because you think you're going to get more. It's like buying a lottery ticket. That's not right. But I've seen people I have seen people do this make these foolish decisions in giving everything that they have because oh maybe 1977 is coming selling all that they have and preparing for that like I said has a lot of faith but no wisdom or that uh they might have some financial trouble. So, I think that I'm just going to give everything that I have and then the Lord will get me out of that financial trouble. The Lord didn't he did not require you to give everything. He requires you to give 10%. And offerings on top of that. So, when you give to God really, you no longer have what you gave or it wouldn't be a gift. It wouldn't be a sacrifice. And friends, for those who haven't paid tithe in years or or never have paid tithe and are just coming to church and you can't make ends meet now, start giving now. That would be my best advice is you say, "Well, I've never done this and and I don't have the money." Start with something. Start giving. G give what you can. Start today. really work your way up to 10% if you have to, but it's better than not doing anything. So try and then instead of making tithing your last priority, now make it your first priority. Proverbs 3:9 says this, "Honor the Lord with your possessions and with the first fruits of all your increase. So, your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will overflow with new wine. The key word there is um the uh barn shall be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with with new wine. Go to verse nine. Could you go to the previous verse? Yeah, there we go. Honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase. The first fruits. You know what the first fruits are? It's the first things that come ripe in your crops. So you take the first that you have and you give that to God. Right there it says honor him with the first verse. Go first. Put him first. Take what you have first and ma and make make that what you give make that your offering to the Lord your tithing to the Lord initially and then he'll bless you. He promised don't worry about it. How many I mean especially the older folks you know that you've paid your tithes all these years and you've always had what you needed. &gt;&gt; Am I right? You have the Lord's always provided. We have done all our small part and he does his big part. &gt;&gt; Now in closing the last part, it's a blessing to pay tithes. And really it should be something that you want to do. Let's go to 2 Chronicles 31:4. 2 Chronicles 31 verse4. Again, I'm reading the New King James version. We have the Old King James up there. 2 Chronicles 31:4 says this. Moreover, he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to contribute support for the priests and the Levites that they might devote themselves to the law of the Lord. As soon as the commandment was circulated, the children of Israel brought in abundance the first fruits of grain and wine, oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field. And they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything. Tithe is 10% of everything. And the children of Israel and Judah who dwelt in the cities of Judah brought the tithe of the oxen and sheep also the tithe of the holy things which were consecrated to the to the Lord their God. They laid in heaps. So the people gave willingly here and it was a blessing to give. So much so that that really that many times throughout the Bible, one of them I believe was with this priest named Jehoida. They needed money to renovate the church, to renovate the temple. So he took a box and he bored a hole in it and put it in the back. And he said, "That's going to be used for the renovation of the church." And the people gave freely so much so that he was constantly dumping the money out of it and putting it back. And the people wanted to give. And that was the spirit of the people. They it was an honor for them to give. They gave. They gave freely. In Matthew chapter 25 or chapter 5, we went through this either last week or the week before. Matthew Matthew chapter 5 verse 23. Listen to this. Jesus is says this. Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar and there and there remember that your brother has something against you that your brother hath ought against thee, leave your gift there before the altar. Right? He's talking about bringing a gift into the church in giving. Leave your gift there before the altar and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother and then come and offer your gift. So people wanted to give to the church. They thought it was an honor to give, but Jesus forbade it until they made things right with a person that they had offended. It also shows this scripture, brother null, shows that tithing is holy. &gt;&gt; That Jesus is saying don't even give your tithing if you have if someone has ought against you. It shows how holy and important this honor of giving is. I'll close with this. 2 Corinthians 96. The Apostle Paul speaking, he says this, "But this say I." 2 Corinthians 9:6. Thank you. But this say I. He who sws sparingly will also reap sparingly. And he who sws bountifully will also reap bountifully. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart. Very important. That's why a pastor should never get up and try to pull on the people for money. Shouldn't do it. It's not right. Let each one give as he feels to give. Let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudging grudgingly or of necessity. Again, not right for the pastor to get up there and say, "You've got to pay your tithe. I'm checking the ledger." No. You present the word to the people and now say, as I as I love to say, it's like, I read it here. Now you take it and apply it to your life &gt;&gt; as the Holy Spirit leads you. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity. For God loves a cheerful giver. And it is it is an honor to be able to give. It's an honor to be able to pay tithes. It's an honor to be able to give an offering on top of our tithes. And one other thing that I would like to address is with our tithes, you don't have control over your tithing. All right? An offering. You might you might come to me and say, "Uh, pastor, I want to sponsor a food program. I want to sponsor the food program next week or something like that." Fine. That's an offering. But when you pay tithing, you don't have control over it. you give it and then you you trust in the leadership of the church and the trustees and you trust in me to spend it in the right way. So I wanted to tell the story quickly about this boy that gave his lunch to Jesus when they didn't have food. He had this lunch. He had some fish and some some crackers and maybe as a bag and he offered this offering. You'll notice he didn't have he had to give it up. He took it and he had to give it to the disciples and say here you take it. And then the disciples brought it to Jesus and it was multiplied. But the key with that story is he had to give it up. It wasn't him that multiplied it. He was the one that provided it, but then the disciples took it and then God gave the increase to it. So again, you're tithing, you're offering, sure, you can direct that. No problem. But you're tithing. No, that comes in to the storehouse and it goes really as the Lord leads there. We together.
