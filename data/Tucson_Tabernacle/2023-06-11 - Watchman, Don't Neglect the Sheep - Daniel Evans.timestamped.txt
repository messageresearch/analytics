[36:32] that song all day
[36:34] God bless you you can take your seats
[36:40] thank you
[36:42] I am
[36:44] had a good day yesterday we
[36:46] brother brother Lyle and brother Arnie
[36:49] and I went to a Minister's meeting up in
[36:51] Phoenix
[36:53] and it was uh to me
[36:57] it was the best one that I've been to
[37:00] it was uh
[37:02] see the numbers have dwindled a little
[37:05] bit but we still had probably 20 or 30
[37:08] maybe more
[37:10] of the pastors and ministers from around
[37:13] the state
[37:14] but felt
[37:17] a real Unity
[37:20] among the brethren
[37:22] and and I felt something that I felt
[37:25] like it's it's been just building
[37:28] over
[37:30] the past couple years and that that's
[37:33] getting away from
[37:37] these doctrines and these these things
[37:40] that separate us
[37:43] and and coming together
[37:46] in the love of Jesus Christ
[37:49] and it just yesterday
[37:52] it struck me that that uh
[37:56] it didn't strike I had the feeling that
[38:00] this is the direction that we're going
[38:01] and I I really believe that it pleases
[38:04] the Lord
[38:05] and moving towards one common goal and
[38:10] that common goal is getting the people
[38:12] ready for the coming of our Lord Jesus
[38:16] that's what brother Branham came here to
[38:18] do it's what every true Minister comes
[38:20] to do every servant of the Lord every
[38:23] Prophet that's come from
[38:25] from Adam all the way to now has been to
[38:29] prepare the people for the coming
[38:31] judgment
[38:32] and I just felt good yesterday I felt
[38:36] like like there was a Unity among the
[38:39] brethren
[38:41] Hey Brother Wilson good to see you next
[38:43] time I want you to go it'd be good to
[38:45] have you to go
[38:47] um
[38:50] I uh
[38:51] I see some walls just coming down
[38:55] bless me brother Caleb Duran reached out
[38:57] to me this morning I really just
[38:59] appreciate him and what what he's what
[39:03] he and brother Steve Robson have done in
[39:06] organizing this having the vision for it
[39:08] and it's been just a real success and
[39:11] I've been to many of them around the
[39:13] world this has been a very successful
[39:16] appreciate brother McGarry opening up
[39:18] his church yesterday and and just
[39:21] as I said I come home with just a good
[39:24] feeling
[39:25] brother Lyle mentioned to me yesterday
[39:30] that today we don't know the exact date
[39:33] it's it's either June June 11th or June
[39:35] 18th that brother Branham
[39:40] was baptizing on the Ohio River
[39:43] and there's a series of events that led
[39:46] up to this that you might not know about
[39:49] brother Branham was helping
[39:52] a a man a Baptist Minister named Roy E
[39:55] Davis Dr Davis well-educated man uh very
[39:59] popular
[40:00] among the Baptist circles way back then
[40:03] brother Branham as a very very young
[40:05] Minister was helping him
[40:08] and the church burned down
[40:12] and brother Branham in his gracious and
[40:16] sweet way
[40:17] he never mentioned
[40:19] really this he hadn't mentioned through
[40:21] just
[40:23] in passing that that the church had
[40:25] burned down but but what happened was
[40:28] when this church burned down
[40:30] this pastor just up and left
[40:35] and he moved to Texas
[40:37] and left the congregation there
[40:40] so brother Branham this young man with
[40:43] very very little experience and and
[40:45] pastoring a church he sets up a tent
[40:50] on Spring Street in Jeffersonville I
[40:52] think it was on Spring Street I could be
[40:54] wrong but I think it was
[40:56] starts having Church
[40:58] starts having a Revival
[41:01] and for two weeks this revival goes on
[41:06] and there there there's new converts
[41:08] coming there's people coming so on this
[41:10] day that this this Sunday
[41:13] 90 years ago
[41:17] as I said it's either June 11th or June
[41:19] 18th 90 years ago this day marks he was
[41:23] there baptizing
[41:25] on the Ohio River a man name I believe
[41:28] his name was Calvin
[41:31] brother Branham a young man brother
[41:32] Branham
[41:33] was baptizing him the 17th person that
[41:36] he was baptizing
[41:39] and we know the story that a
[41:41] supernatural like
[41:43] came down in a voice spoke whether the
[41:47] people heard it we don't know
[41:49] but brother Branham heard it
[41:52] and it said this as John the Baptist was
[41:54] sent the forerun the first coming
[41:58] of the Lord
[42:00] your message will forerun the second
[42:03] it always struck me that that
[42:06] The Voice didn't say you
[42:10] it said your message we know that God
[42:13] has taken that that messenger home
[42:16] but
[42:17] we see in brother Branham this message
[42:20] that he brought this message of
[42:23] reconciliation he said one time
[42:26] this message of love this message of
[42:30] introducing Jesus Christ to the world
[42:35] the same message that John the Baptist
[42:37] preached that he introduced Jesus Christ
[42:41] to the world
[42:44] and we need to get back
[42:47] to that message of introducing Christ
[42:51] and we see what happened what followed
[42:53] brother branham's Ministry and the
[42:55] Miracles and all the great things that
[42:57] happened all too introduce Christ
[43:01] to a Dying World
[43:04] as I was thinking about that
[43:06] brother Lyle after you told me that I
[43:09] was thinking about that last night I was
[43:10] thinking what if he wouldn't have
[43:13] what if he wouldn't have set up that
[43:15] tent
[43:16] what if he would have just threw his
[43:18] hands up in the air and said the church
[43:19] building's gone
[43:21] I'm just going to go to work and I'm
[43:22] going to make a living what if he
[43:23] wouldn't have done it
[43:25] what would have happened to those people
[43:27] that were there
[43:29] at that time they didn't have a place to
[43:31] congregate
[43:32] it didn't have a pastor
[43:34] that didn't have
[43:36] a group that we we have today and that
[43:40] group that he had was much smaller than
[43:42] this
[43:44] so they a little while later
[43:47] a few months later maybe a couple months
[43:48] later they laid the Cornerstone on the
[43:50] Branham Tabernacle at 8th and Penn
[43:52] Street
[43:54] and
[43:55] I think wow that was it's a great thing
[43:59] that happened but what if he wouldn't
[44:00] have done it
[44:02] I am
[44:04] Daniel and I
[44:06] we had
[44:07] as I've mentioned it a few times we we
[44:10] started a Ministry in Jeffersonville
[44:14] this ministry was was to um
[44:17] some of the more downtrodden folks
[44:20] downtown
[44:21] and around the Louisville area and in
[44:24] Jeffersonville and and um
[44:28] what happened was
[44:30] my brother Adam and I we had we had our
[44:33] kids and and uh
[44:35] we saw that I felt like
[44:39] they weren't they weren't there was they
[44:42] were missing something in their life
[44:45] we kept them at home and and we did our
[44:47] best to to shelter them from the world
[44:49] we Stephanie she did a wonderful job in
[44:53] homeschooling our children and and we
[44:55] tried to just keep them around the best
[44:57] of kids and and just did our best but
[44:59] there was something missing
[45:01] in our kids lives
[45:04] and
[45:05] my brothers was was talking to his his
[45:09] son was just playing video games all day
[45:11] and and didn't have much to do and he he
[45:13] told me he said then I got I got to do
[45:15] something
[45:16] so
[45:18] we he brought his his kids to this
[45:21] boxing gym
[45:23] and I said well I'd like Daniel too
[45:25] Daniel needs it I saw the kid out there
[45:28] riding his bike every day and and
[45:30] jumping on the trampoline and and trying
[45:32] and he just he was a gifted athlete and
[45:34] trying to get that out of him and and I
[45:36] just felt like it would be good for him
[45:38] to to get out and to do some more
[45:41] so we we signed him up for this boxing
[45:43] gym and
[45:44] and downtown New Albany and and of
[45:48] course being the athletes that they are
[45:50] they just shot to the top and quickly
[45:54] outgrew that that Jim so then we brought
[45:58] him to a real boxing gym these were
[46:00] these had professional fighters in it
[46:02] and it was just it was a terrible
[46:06] atmosphere
[46:07] just cussing and and the the way the
[46:11] women looked that were always in there
[46:13] it was just and and the drugs and
[46:16] everything about it was just like Lord
[46:17] we're putting our our kids in this Lord
[46:20] help us out
[46:22] so one day the coach
[46:25] he comes to my brother
[46:29] and his name's Jeremy
[46:32] and he said
[46:34] he says you know he says your kids
[46:38] Daniel and Benjamin and Joel are two are
[46:41] his two my brother's two kids he says
[46:43] they're really gifted they're really
[46:44] good
[46:45] he said I want to break off
[46:48] from this gym
[46:51] and he said I want to form
[46:53] a a gym with with just this other this
[46:56] other young man named Deshawn who is a
[46:58] professional heavyweight boxer and
[47:00] tremendously gifted
[47:02] young man he says I want to take DeSean
[47:04] and I want to take your three kids and I
[47:07] want to form a boxing gym with them
[47:09] being the foundation and he said I want
[47:12] to make it a Ministry
[47:14] he says I want to get these kids closer
[47:16] to the Lord it was an answer to our
[47:18] prayer we were doing our best we were
[47:22] trying to be the best parents that we
[47:23] could trying to protect our kids but we
[47:25] saw that that we were going too far on
[47:28] this side
[47:29] they needed they needed that interaction
[47:32] they had to have that so so then the
[47:34] Lord knew our hearts and he placed this
[47:36] in front of us
[47:39] and we started this gym
[47:42] in downtown Jeffersonville started to
[47:45] grow
[47:47] and then it kept growing
[47:50] then
[47:52] um this this Jeremy he he asked me or
[47:55] Adam my brother said well talk to Dan
[47:57] about the ministry thing
[48:00] so
[48:01] so we started I said well let's have a
[48:03] Bible study
[48:04] so we started out with just a handful of
[48:07] kids
[48:08] not they're not kids I mean DeSean was
[48:11] 30 years old or so
[48:13] and uh we started doing this Bible study
[48:17] and it started to grow
[48:19] and it kept growing
[48:21] more people started hearing about it and
[48:24] it kept it kept growing and we saw
[48:27] parents start to come and and pretty
[48:29] soon we see one of the mega churches
[48:31] around they said we believe in what
[48:33] you're doing we want to support it they
[48:35] donated an 800 000 building and two
[48:38] hundred thousand dollars to renovate it
[48:41] hundreds over a hundred boxers
[48:46] best record
[48:48] in the tri-states too
[48:50] not I'm
[48:52] not talking about the worldly things but
[48:53] we were the best
[48:55] we had the best record of any gym in in
[49:00] Southern Indiana and Northern Kentucky
[49:02] we were the best
[49:04] because we put
[49:06] the Lord first
[49:08] and we kept on with this Bible study
[49:12] and
[49:13] even after I moved to Tucson
[49:17] I hired a um a young lady she was a
[49:20] she was in the army and she wanted to
[49:23] move from Indianapolis to Tucson so she
[49:25] contacted me saying within the USGS
[49:28] contacted me and said hey my husband's
[49:30] moving I would like to I would like to
[49:32] go there
[49:33] we so I interviewed her and I and she
[49:36] says I said well what do you like to do
[49:37] on your on your spare time she says I'm
[49:39] a boxer
[49:40] I was like oh okay well she's an army
[49:43] person and a boxer
[49:45] um
[49:45] feel bad for a husband
[49:49] so they don't want to get I'm
[49:52] going to get in the middle there if they
[49:53] ever get crossed but
[49:55] but
[49:57] I said oh yeah I said we started a gym
[50:00] in Southern Southern Indiana
[50:03] and she said what's his name I said JC
[50:05] boxing Jesus Christ boxing
[50:09] JC boxing it's all it's uh what is it
[50:12] really
[50:13] Jeff Jeff city boxing but we always
[50:16] called it Jesus Christ boxing so
[50:20] so she said oh
[50:23] she said you guys are the best
[50:26] she said my she said everybody knows
[50:28] about your gym
[50:30] and how good you all are
[50:32] so we kept getting better and better and
[50:35] and and this gym just kept kept
[50:38] expanding
[50:41] based with the foundation of this Bible
[50:43] study
[50:45] and many not only the kids not and there
[50:49] were no kids like I said they were these
[50:51] were professional boxers many of them
[50:52] but their parents their moms gave their
[50:55] hearts to the Lord their dads and it's
[50:58] still happening now
[50:59] my brother told me he did bible study on
[51:02] Wednesday night he said Dan we had 70
[51:05] people
[51:07] in our in our Bible study teaching these
[51:10] kids well this past week
[51:13] that heavyweight I was talking about
[51:16] tremendous boxer died in his sleep
[51:19] his name's DeShawn
[51:22] and I don't know if it's a braid brain
[51:23] bleed from the boxing or whatever it was
[51:27] died his son he left two children two
[51:29] boys behind two young boys
[51:32] he died
[51:34] and Adam
[51:37] told me about it and he said on this
[51:40] this past Wednesday he said
[51:44] he was he was torn up about it as
[51:46] everybody as everybody was and he said
[51:49] he says I'm gonna I'm gonna tell him
[51:52] tell the boxers
[51:54] the fighters about this
[51:56] and they already knew but he says I'm
[51:58] gonna he said Dan I'm gonna tell him you
[52:01] gotta get right
[52:03] so my brother
[52:05] he uh
[52:07] he talks about
[52:10] about the Lord Jesus and he says why do
[52:12] you think we're even here
[52:15] and and I thought the same thing and
[52:18] Adam Adam asked me he says he says did I
[52:21] say enough to him
[52:24] and I thought to myself did I say enough
[52:26] to DeSean
[52:28] where is that young man today
[52:31] I don't know
[52:33] I don't I hope you're right
[52:36] but when we when we present this did we
[52:39] do enough
[52:42] did in in presenting the gospel to these
[52:45] kids was I firm enough
[52:49] in my sermons that I preached to them
[52:52] was Adam was he firm enough was he
[52:54] reaching out enough
[52:57] that young man there's no more
[52:59] repentance in his life
[53:01] his time is over
[53:03] he met the judge when he died or whether
[53:06] he will meet the judge in the future he
[53:08] will meet that judge
[53:10] and where does he stand
[53:13] and I think the same as me standing in
[53:15] this pulpit
[53:19] here
[53:21] it's hard for me I I
[53:24] I don't know why I do that but
[53:28] what's coming forth
[53:31] am I giving enough am I being am I being
[53:35] good enough in saying what this word
[53:37] means or is this is just a watered-down
[53:40] religion in a place you go to church on
[53:42] Sunday
[53:44] is it making any difference in your life
[53:47] did it make any difference in that young
[53:50] man's life he was a Christian
[53:53] he confessed it and he spoke many times
[53:55] he was the most respected guy in the gym
[53:59] and
[54:00] I think did did it make
[54:03] didn't make enough of a difference
[54:07] and I stand here this morning and and
[54:09] I'm going to read a scripture if I can
[54:11] get enough nerve to read it I'll read it
[54:13] towards the end of the of the service
[54:17] that's very sobering
[54:20] I was talking with a brother
[54:22] as a friend the other
[54:23] with a friend about when he was young
[54:27] just a kid in junior high
[54:30] and he said there's these two kids that
[54:32] that got new dirt bikes
[54:36] and they were
[54:37] they got on the dirt bikes and they were
[54:39] riding and and he knew that that down
[54:42] down the road there there was a wire
[54:44] that went across
[54:46] a cable that went across it was
[54:48] dangerous
[54:49] the young man he's just a little boy and
[54:52] maybe didn't think to say anything and
[54:54] he was in his house
[54:57] and he looked out the window
[54:59] just in time to see the boy in the dirt
[55:02] bike going down and hit the cable
[55:05] kill them instantly
[55:08] saw it
[55:10] as a brother was telling
[55:12] just tears in his eyes and said what
[55:15] couldn't I have just done more
[55:18] soon I'm just say I wish I would have
[55:20] just said something and this is a regret
[55:22] that he's had his whole life there's
[55:24] nothing he could have done of course not
[55:27] he was a kid
[55:29] but that regret is still there
[55:33] even today
[55:37] I look at
[55:39] I look at my own life and I see how many
[55:42] times I've regretted not doing something
[55:45] how many times have I regretted reaching
[55:48] out it's very rare
[55:50] but I've regretted many times not
[55:53] I was walking I was traveling for work
[55:55] like 20 years ago
[55:57] and I was in the city of Portland I was
[55:59] by myself I was in meetings there and I
[56:01] and I would get out of the meetings and
[56:03] go back to the hotel and and I got I
[56:06] went back to hotel and I and I walked
[56:08] out and I was going into the Rose Garden
[56:10] in Portland and there was a there was a
[56:12] mall there and I was walking
[56:15] towards the mall to get something to eat
[56:18] and this obviously sick
[56:22] Young
[56:24] I'd say 25 Maybe
[56:27] your old man
[56:30] long hair
[56:32] thin
[56:34] was walking like this
[56:37] obviously in a lot of pain
[56:40] back then 20 years ago I knew exactly
[56:42] what it was
[56:45] I was walking this way
[56:48] he was walking this way
[56:51] I took a breath and I held my breath
[56:55] and I walked by him
[56:57] he says can you help me
[56:59] I said I said no
[57:02] and I kept walking and he said I'm dying
[57:04] of AIDS
[57:06] he says there's anything you could do
[57:08] I just kept walking
[57:11] deep regret why did I not turn around
[57:13] and pray for that man
[57:15] why didn't I turn around and say brother
[57:18] the Lord Jesus
[57:21] this life is fleeting this life just
[57:25] lasts for a little bit of time but if
[57:26] you know the Lord Jesus
[57:29] you'll have eternity
[57:31] in in a wonderful place I has not seen
[57:35] the joy that you will have
[57:38] I look back at that time 20 years ago
[57:41] why didn't I say something
[57:44] I regret it
[57:46] to this day I got back I got back to my
[57:48] hotel and I remember I I repented and I
[57:51] went out and I tried to find the man I
[57:54] couldn't find him
[57:56] failed
[57:58] I never I never want to fail
[58:02] I never want to be in that
[58:04] that position again not for my own good
[58:09] what about DeSean The Boxer
[58:12] where is he where is that man that I
[58:15] walked by
[58:16] both of them I prayed for
[58:18] but where are they today I don't know
[58:21] but it wasn't because
[58:24] that I didn't do enough
[58:27] Maybe
[58:29] there's a story in your Bible you all
[58:30] know it in Luke chapter 10
[58:33] there was a a lawyer an expert in the
[58:36] law
[58:38] and he asked Jesus
[58:40] he says what do I need to do
[58:42] to inherit eternal life
[58:45] Jesus said responds he said love the
[58:47] Lord God with all of your heart
[58:50] and he says love your neighbor as
[58:52] yourself
[58:54] and this man
[58:55] probably didn't he probably didn't
[58:58] appreciate what Jesus said he probably
[58:59] wanted to maybe trap him or try to bait
[59:02] him into making a mistake
[59:04] and he says what is loving your brother
[59:06] or loving your neighbor
[59:08] he says what does that even mean and
[59:09] this man was an expert in the law
[59:13] Jesus as was his way and his I love let
[59:18] me tell you Jesus Christ is everything
[59:21] if you take this whole world
[59:24] it's a song but give me Jesus
[59:27] he is just
[59:29] if we can just get to him
[59:32] Jesus tells the story he says
[59:35] sorry he says
[59:37] there was a man
[59:40] that was beaten and robbed
[59:43] they stole everything from them they
[59:44] even stole his clothes
[59:46] beat him to the point of his death
[59:49] and there's the man laying on the ground
[59:54] and here comes a priest walking by sees
[59:57] the man goes to the other side of the
[59:59] road
[1:00:01] walks by
[1:00:03] doesn't even want to be around him
[1:00:06] what did I do
[1:00:09] priest goes by a priest should know
[1:00:11] better
[1:00:13] then here comes a temple worker a levite
[1:00:16] he sees the man laying there he looks on
[1:00:19] him
[1:00:21] walks over the other side of the road
[1:00:26] walks on
[1:00:28] leaves him there to die doesn't care
[1:00:33] then here comes a man not even from that
[1:00:36] town
[1:00:38] a man from Samaria this Samaritan he
[1:00:41] comes in
[1:00:42] and he takes the man
[1:00:45] picks him up he goes to the end he gets
[1:00:47] a room
[1:00:49] he takes wine
[1:00:51] to to to
[1:00:53] um
[1:00:54] for antiseptic for his wounds
[1:00:58] washes him up cleans his wounds takes
[1:01:01] oil
[1:01:03] rubs it on his wounds
[1:01:06] so that he might not be in as much pain
[1:01:11] there's not even a dialogue between the
[1:01:14] Samaritan and the man
[1:01:18] we don't even know what they said we
[1:01:20] don't even know if the man was conscious
[1:01:23] takes him in tells The Innkeeper
[1:01:26] he says listen
[1:01:28] the next morning he spends the night
[1:01:29] with the man taking care of him
[1:01:32] the next morning
[1:01:34] he says
[1:01:36] he goes to the Innkeeper and he says he
[1:01:38] says listen he says whatever he needs
[1:01:42] he says here's two days wages
[1:01:47] if you make fifty thousand dollars a
[1:01:48] year it's like 400 bucks
[1:01:52] he says here's two days wages he says
[1:01:55] give him whatever he needs
[1:01:57] he says then if he needs more give it to
[1:02:01] him and the next time I come
[1:02:04] I'll pay you for it
[1:02:07] didn't even know the man
[1:02:10] who was more
[1:02:12] of a servant of God
[1:02:14] was it the priest was it the pastor that
[1:02:17] walked by that said I don't want
[1:02:19] anything to do with him was it the
[1:02:21] temple worker
[1:02:24] today be a trustee or a deacon or
[1:02:26] whatever it is was it one of those
[1:02:29] or was it this man that we don't even
[1:02:31] know where he's from not even from the
[1:02:33] Jewish religion a Samaritan coming and
[1:02:37] helping this man and who was right
[1:02:41] Jesus asked him the the lawyer the
[1:02:45] expert in the law he said who was the
[1:02:48] neighbor
[1:02:49] to answer your question
[1:02:51] the lawyer says well
[1:02:54] it was
[1:02:56] the Samaritan
[1:02:57] he says right
[1:02:59] and he says you do the same
[1:03:05] we heard that story but put yourself
[1:03:09] in there
[1:03:13] I think about
[1:03:16] all that we're doing
[1:03:18] and I think about this this young man
[1:03:20] DeSean that
[1:03:22] that died Daniel used to box with him
[1:03:26] Daniel was a sparring partner
[1:03:29] and uh
[1:03:30] lighten it up a little bit
[1:03:33] he didn't want a box Daniel very much
[1:03:35] anymore because Daniel was tearing him
[1:03:38] up
[1:03:39] Daniel got good
[1:03:41] and uh
[1:03:44] he um
[1:03:46] I think about
[1:03:48] think about him
[1:03:50] this kid I loved him
[1:03:52] how many how many conversations have I
[1:03:54] had with him talking about the Lord
[1:03:57] his kids coming in
[1:03:59] and and and
[1:04:01] talking with us and he had this little
[1:04:03] Bulldog that was the cutest dog I've
[1:04:05] ever seen those slobbery little dog and
[1:04:08] it was just it was so cute and and we
[1:04:11] just we just loved him but I think where
[1:04:13] is he
[1:04:14] what have I done
[1:04:18] did we plant enough of a seed
[1:04:21] in his life
[1:04:25] what did he know Jesus
[1:04:29] that's everything
[1:04:31] did he have that relationship with
[1:04:34] Christ
[1:04:36] you can come to church
[1:04:40] you can you can be part of a group
[1:04:45] but do you know Christ it doesn't do any
[1:04:47] good
[1:04:49] the priest that walked by the the man on
[1:04:52] the street
[1:04:55] who was more right
[1:04:58] did he know
[1:05:00] did he know God himself
[1:05:03] are we introducing people to the Lord
[1:05:07] Jesus he is everything
[1:05:11] let's turn to John
[1:05:13] chapter 4 I'll read a scripture just
[1:05:16] just once one scripture and I'll have a
[1:05:19] few more John 14 6
[1:05:23] Jesus says this
[1:05:26] he says I am the way
[1:05:30] the truth
[1:05:32] and the life
[1:05:34] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:05:38] I am the way the truth and the life no
[1:05:41] man comes to the father except by me I
[1:05:44] hear I hear so much in today's religious
[1:05:46] societies
[1:05:48] I hear so much oh
[1:05:50] it's it's just between you and the Lord
[1:05:52] you have your own way you have your own
[1:05:55] religion you have your own way of
[1:05:58] contacting God that's a lie that is
[1:06:00] false
[1:06:02] there is only one way to come to the
[1:06:04] father that scripture I just read is it
[1:06:07] only through Jesus Christ
[1:06:09] it wasn't through Moses
[1:06:12] it wasn't through the law it wasn't
[1:06:14] through Elijah it wasn't through John
[1:06:16] the Baptist it wasn't through brother
[1:06:17] Branham it wasn't through it wasn't
[1:06:19] through any of that it was through
[1:06:20] Christ and him alone and all of that was
[1:06:23] to point us to Christ
[1:06:26] he is the only way
[1:06:30] and if you're Mormon or Jehovah Witness
[1:06:31] or Muslim or Hindu or whatever it is you
[1:06:35] have to come to the same Christ that we
[1:06:37] have to come to
[1:06:39] and if you're going trying to go some
[1:06:41] other way you're not going to get there
[1:06:45] only through Christ
[1:06:49] there is one mediator let's let's Farm
[1:06:52] to turn to First Timothy chapter two
[1:07:01] I exhort therefore
[1:07:06] let's we'll start with verse 5.
[1:07:09] for there is one God
[1:07:12] and one mediator between God and Men the
[1:07:15] man Christ Jesus
[1:07:18] not Abraham as I said not Moses not
[1:07:20] Elijah not anyone else Jesus Christ and
[1:07:23] him alone
[1:07:25] who gave himself
[1:07:27] a ransom for all
[1:07:30] to be testified in due time
[1:07:33] none of those men that I said could give
[1:07:35] their life
[1:07:37] none of those men was Worthy
[1:07:40] to be that sacrificial lamb Christ gave
[1:07:45] himself
[1:07:46] a ransom for all
[1:07:48] to be testified
[1:07:50] in due time
[1:07:52] to be testified at the proper time and
[1:07:55] that time is now
[1:07:58] it's now for all of us
[1:08:01] wherein to
[1:08:03] I am ordained a preacher the Apostle
[1:08:06] Paul's speaking where unto I am ordained
[1:08:08] a preacher and an apostle I speak the
[1:08:11] truth in Christ and I lie not
[1:08:13] a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
[1:08:17] Verity and faith and Truth
[1:08:22] he is as I said he is everything every
[1:08:26] sermon I said it on Wednesday night
[1:08:27] every sermon
[1:08:30] in every epistle from Acts
[1:08:33] all the way through revelation
[1:08:35] every sermon is about one man
[1:08:39] and all the prophets pointed to that one
[1:08:41] man
[1:08:42] and that man is Christ and we have to
[1:08:45] know him personally
[1:08:47] everyone in this room
[1:08:50] we have to know him
[1:08:53] a friend of mine a dear friend someone
[1:08:56] who I I rely on a lot
[1:08:59] his name is Caleb Caleb Perez from he's
[1:09:03] a pastor
[1:09:04] in Las Cruces
[1:09:06] dear brother his brother preached will
[1:09:09] will Perez the other day here
[1:09:12] and
[1:09:13] he's just been he's been a
[1:09:16] just a good friend to me he's been a
[1:09:18] pastor for a long time
[1:09:21] and
[1:09:22] in talking with him
[1:09:26] he and and just fellowshipping as
[1:09:29] Brethren and and there's certain things
[1:09:31] that we don't want to do
[1:09:34] I didn't want to in Portland I didn't
[1:09:36] want to talk to that man
[1:09:38] walking by me
[1:09:40] there are certain things that we don't
[1:09:42] want to do in life and brother Caleb
[1:09:43] answered this he says if not you then
[1:09:46] who
[1:09:49] if not you then who
[1:09:54] and then you think well I will sometime
[1:09:57] and he says if not now then when
[1:10:03] those words ring in my mind
[1:10:06] all the time I think about them
[1:10:09] it is our job
[1:10:12] to cast this net
[1:10:15] as in the Bible the parable he said You
[1:10:17] cast the net and it goes out and it goes
[1:10:19] down and it it lays down upon the floor
[1:10:24] of the the creek or the the
[1:10:27] Pond or whatever it is my cousin used to
[1:10:30] do it on the Ohio River he had this big
[1:10:31] cast net and he'd throw it out and it
[1:10:34] would go down and he'd pull that thing
[1:10:35] in and you never knew what was going to
[1:10:37] come in
[1:10:39] there were snakes there was these eels
[1:10:42] these nasty looking slimy little eels
[1:10:44] that would come up there was Turtles
[1:10:46] snapping turtles come up and sticks
[1:10:50] rocks it just things would come in but
[1:10:53] there was some fish
[1:10:55] and that's what Jesus said he says when
[1:10:57] you cast The Net you you pull in Turtles
[1:10:59] and these different things but there are
[1:11:01] some fish in there
[1:11:03] and those fish
[1:11:05] Jesus said to Peter I will make you a
[1:11:07] fisher of men
[1:11:09] and I I think that there's there's also
[1:11:13] the parable of of the sowing the
[1:11:17] planting the seed I believe it's in
[1:11:19] Matthew 13 where
[1:11:21] where this man was
[1:11:24] was
[1:11:25] seeding his field
[1:11:28] and he has all these seeds and and he's
[1:11:30] going out and he's he's sowing these
[1:11:32] seeds and some of those seeds they fall
[1:11:34] on the trail
[1:11:36] on the road
[1:11:37] and the birds come and the birds eat
[1:11:40] them
[1:11:41] and then other seeds he throws them out
[1:11:43] and they fall in the in the bushes and
[1:11:45] the thorns and and those those Thorns
[1:11:47] they just they they cover them up
[1:11:51] when the seed sprouts and don't let it
[1:11:53] grow
[1:11:54] and then there's other places if he
[1:11:57] throws it on the side that it lands in
[1:11:59] the rocks and the rain comes and some of
[1:12:01] these seeds and the thorns and these
[1:12:03] seeds and the Rocks they'll pop up but
[1:12:05] then when it dries out a little bit they
[1:12:07] wither and they die and they just blow
[1:12:09] away
[1:12:11] but then there are other seeds that fall
[1:12:14] out on this fertile ground
[1:12:18] and when the rain comes they sprout up
[1:12:22] and they grow
[1:12:24] and those seeds that that are in that
[1:12:26] are come in in the thorns and the bushes
[1:12:28] many times that's that's our environment
[1:12:31] that we're in
[1:12:33] and we're just like when I was trying to
[1:12:36] put Daniel in these this boxing gym it
[1:12:39] was just a bad environment how can you
[1:12:41] grow in a bad environment
[1:12:44] how can how can that that sunlight hit
[1:12:48] you when you're covered with thorns and
[1:12:50] thistles
[1:12:52] you can't and it just it just dies or
[1:12:55] just it never grows but then there is a
[1:12:59] crop in that sun light comes down and it
[1:13:02] it grows and then Jesus said and it
[1:13:05] multiplies a hundred fold
[1:13:09] so you have one grain of corn
[1:13:13] you put it in there and all of a sudden
[1:13:15] when the Harvest is you have 100 grain
[1:13:17] you have a hundred of these grains or
[1:13:18] more
[1:13:20] and it multiplies but it has to we have
[1:13:23] to be as as we as Believers we have to
[1:13:26] be sowing these seeds and throwing these
[1:13:28] out
[1:13:29] and we don't know sometimes it'll fall
[1:13:31] on the road it's okay sometimes it'll
[1:13:34] fall out in the bushes it's okay
[1:13:36] but if we keep doing it it's going to
[1:13:38] grow it's going to take root
[1:13:41] the same thing throw the net
[1:13:43] just keep doing it you'll get fish
[1:13:50] think about
[1:13:54] and planting these seeds let's let's
[1:13:56] read some of the word Romans chapter 10.
[1:14:00] verse 12.
[1:14:03] for there is no difference
[1:14:08] between the Jew and the Greek
[1:14:10] for the same Lord over all is Rich unto
[1:14:14] all that call upon him
[1:14:15] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[1:14:18] of the Lord shall be saved what is the
[1:14:20] name of the Lord
[1:14:24] uh what is the name of the Lord
[1:14:27] Jesus
[1:14:32] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[1:14:33] of the Lord shall be saved
[1:14:35] how then shall they call on him who they
[1:14:38] have not believed
[1:14:41] and how shall they believe in him who
[1:14:44] they have not heard
[1:14:46] how many
[1:14:47] people have not heard about a Christian
[1:14:51] Life
[1:14:52] how many people have not heard that
[1:14:54] Jesus Christ died for their sins
[1:14:57] and how shall they hear without a
[1:14:59] preacher
[1:15:01] I'm not talking about the guy in this
[1:15:03] Pulpit all the time
[1:15:05] I'm talking about all of us
[1:15:09] we are ministers to this world in
[1:15:11] whatever capacity the lord has laid out
[1:15:16] and how shall they preach except they be
[1:15:19] sent that is as it is written how
[1:15:21] beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:15:22] preach the gospel of peace
[1:15:25] and bring Glad Tidings of good things
[1:15:28] it's all with our lord Jesus it is all
[1:15:31] positive
[1:15:34] but they have not obeyed the gospel for
[1:15:36] Isaiah said Lord who hath believed our
[1:15:39] report
[1:15:42] and he's talking about he says they have
[1:15:44] not all believed to have heard and he's
[1:15:47] quoting back to Isaiah chapter 53.
[1:15:51] the Apostle hears is quoting Isaiah 53
[1:15:54] Isaiah 53 is a prophecy of Jesus Christ
[1:15:58] coming
[1:16:00] so then faith
[1:16:03] so we know that this is about the Lord
[1:16:04] Jesus so then Faith cometh by hearing
[1:16:08] and hearing by the word of God that's
[1:16:10] that's old English
[1:16:15] the the Amplified Bible says this so
[1:16:18] faith comes from hearing what is told
[1:16:21] and what is heard comes by the preaching
[1:16:24] of the message concerning Christ
[1:16:27] so Faith cometh by hearing hearing the
[1:16:30] word of God
[1:16:36] you know what how important
[1:16:39] as I said that this isn't how shall they
[1:16:43] hear without a preacher I'm not just
[1:16:45] talking about me standing in this pulpit
[1:16:50] all of us
[1:16:53] we go out into this world there should
[1:16:56] be an atmosphere
[1:16:58] around us
[1:16:59] all the time
[1:17:02] Jesus had an atmosphere
[1:17:05] such a strong atmosphere that if someone
[1:17:08] would just touch His Garment they would
[1:17:10] be healed
[1:17:11] they said no one of them said no you
[1:17:13] don't have to come into my house you
[1:17:14] just say the word
[1:17:16] my servant will be healed
[1:17:19] that's such an atmosphere around him
[1:17:22] Peter when he received that Spirit of
[1:17:24] Christ he had that same atmosphere to
[1:17:27] where he would walk by and just his
[1:17:29] shadow
[1:17:31] if the people could just get in his
[1:17:32] shadow they would be healed
[1:17:35] such an atmosphere
[1:17:38] and that's how we should be
[1:17:41] brother Branham said this
[1:17:44] think about as I read this quote think
[1:17:47] about yourself
[1:17:50] brother Brown says this and did you know
[1:17:55] you are a little Creator yourself
[1:17:58] did you know that certainly
[1:18:00] you've seen people that you just love to
[1:18:03] be around
[1:18:05] you don't know why
[1:18:06] just that loving type of person
[1:18:09] have you seen that just as kind there
[1:18:12] you like being around him
[1:18:15] they created that Atmosphere by the life
[1:18:18] they live the way they talk their
[1:18:22] conversation
[1:18:25] how many want to be like that
[1:18:29] then you've seen those
[1:18:31] every time you shun them
[1:18:35] all time
[1:18:37] they want to talk about something evil
[1:18:40] and talk about somebody
[1:18:43] say oh my
[1:18:45] there they come they're going to
[1:18:46] criticize somebody there
[1:18:50] he's in here now he's going to talk
[1:18:52] about this man
[1:18:54] all they're going to do is tell dirty
[1:18:56] jokes or something about women or or say
[1:18:57] something like that you just hate to get
[1:18:59] around them
[1:19:01] see they create seemingly pretty nice
[1:19:04] people but they create that atmosphere
[1:19:08] and the things that you think on
[1:19:11] the things that you do the actions
[1:19:15] the things you talk about creates an
[1:19:19] atmosphere
[1:19:22] so what atmosphere do you create
[1:19:25] in your life
[1:19:28] when you walk into a room when you talk
[1:19:30] to somebody What atmosphere are you
[1:19:33] creating What Spirit are you bringing
[1:19:35] into that room
[1:19:36] What Spirit are you bringing into that
[1:19:38] conversation
[1:19:44] friends I when I say this
[1:19:48] I'm thinking about what's on the other
[1:19:50] side
[1:19:52] what's on the other side for each person
[1:19:53] in this room
[1:19:55] what's on the other side of the river
[1:19:57] for DeSean what's on the other side of
[1:19:59] that River for that man in Portland that
[1:20:01] I talked to what's on the other side of
[1:20:03] the river for our children
[1:20:04] for husbands for wives
[1:20:07] what's on the other side
[1:20:10] it's important that we we talk about
[1:20:12] these things
[1:20:16] oh Ezekiel chapter 33 Lord give me
[1:20:20] strength to read this
[1:20:28] when I when I look at this word
[1:20:37] I think
[1:20:40] this is judgment
[1:20:42] here
[1:20:46] for communion it says let a man examine
[1:20:48] himself
[1:20:49] so let us judge ourselves concerning
[1:20:52] this
[1:20:56] again the word of the Lord Ezekiel
[1:20:58] speaking
[1:21:00] again the word of the Lord came unto me
[1:21:02] saying son of man speak to the children
[1:21:04] of thy people and say unto them when I
[1:21:06] bring the sword upon the land
[1:21:08] if the people of the land
[1:21:11] take a man of their coasts
[1:21:15] and set him for their Watchmen
[1:21:18] if when he seeth the sword come upon the
[1:21:20] land he blow a trumpet and warn the
[1:21:22] people then whosoever Hearth the sound
[1:21:24] of the trumpet and taketh not warning if
[1:21:27] the sword come and take him away his
[1:21:29] blood shall be upon his own head
[1:21:33] he heard the sound of the trumpet and
[1:21:35] took not warning
[1:21:38] his blood shall be upon him
[1:21:41] that he that taketh warning shall
[1:21:43] deliver his soul
[1:21:46] so you hear
[1:21:48] Brethren be careful
[1:21:51] watch yourself
[1:21:53] watch your life
[1:21:56] examine yourself
[1:21:59] because the enemy is coming
[1:22:03] but if the Watchman
[1:22:06] see the sword come and blow not the
[1:22:08] trumpet and the people be not warned
[1:22:11] if the sword come and take any person
[1:22:13] from among them
[1:22:15] he is taken away in his iniquity but his
[1:22:18] blood will I require at the watchman's
[1:22:21] hands
[1:22:23] so thou no son of man
[1:22:26] I have set thee and Watchmen under the
[1:22:28] house of Israel
[1:22:30] therefore Thou shalt hear the word of my
[1:22:33] mouth
[1:22:34] and warn them from me
[1:22:38] when I say unto the wicked old Wicked
[1:22:40] Man Thou shalt surely die if thou Dost
[1:22:43] not speak to warn the Wicked Man from
[1:22:46] his way
[1:22:47] that Wicked man shall die in his
[1:22:49] iniquity
[1:22:50] but his blood will I require at thy hand
[1:22:56] so who dies the man the sinner dies
[1:22:59] and this one
[1:23:01] the one that doesn't warn
[1:23:04] nevertheless
[1:23:06] if thou warn the wicked of his way to
[1:23:08] turn from it
[1:23:10] if he do not turn from his way he shall
[1:23:13] die in his iniquity but thou has
[1:23:14] delivered thy soul
[1:23:16] therefore o son of man speak unto the
[1:23:19] house of Israel thus ye speaks saying if
[1:23:22] our transgressions and our sins be upon
[1:23:24] us and we Pine away in them how shall we
[1:23:27] then live
[1:23:29] say unto them as I live
[1:23:32] saith the Lord God
[1:23:34] I have no pleasure in the death of the
[1:23:36] wicked
[1:23:36] God doesn't want anyone to die
[1:23:39] God wants everyone to come to the Lord
[1:23:42] but that the wicked man turned from his
[1:23:46] way and live turn ye turn ye from your
[1:23:49] evil ways for why will you die O ye
[1:23:53] House of Israel
[1:24:01] you know
[1:24:02] we move there's a move in the in
[1:24:05] in message ranks just stay home just
[1:24:09] separate yourselves just stay in your
[1:24:11] home don't go outside stay away from
[1:24:13] this wicked world just protect yourself
[1:24:16] don't worry about anybody that that's in
[1:24:19] the grocery store or Walmart they're
[1:24:20] heathens anyways they're just Sinners
[1:24:22] just protect yourself and and and don't
[1:24:26] mix with them
[1:24:28] how does that line up with this
[1:24:30] scripture
[1:24:32] what about that soul of that person that
[1:24:35] you come into contact with
[1:24:38] what about that person
[1:24:40] you will be guilty
[1:24:43] of not saying not telling them about the
[1:24:46] Lord Jesus
[1:24:50] skip to verse 30.
[1:24:53] also thou son of man
[1:24:56] the children of thy people still are
[1:24:58] talking against thee by the walls and in
[1:25:00] the doors of the houses and speak one to
[1:25:02] another everyone to his brother saying
[1:25:04] come
[1:25:05] I pray you and hear
[1:25:07] what is the word that cometh forth from
[1:25:09] the from the Lord
[1:25:12] and they come unto thee as the people
[1:25:14] cometh and they sit before thee as my
[1:25:17] people they're sitting there they're
[1:25:18] listening and they hear thy words but
[1:25:21] they will not do them
[1:25:25] for with their mouth
[1:25:27] they show much love
[1:25:29] but their heart goeth after their
[1:25:31] covetousness
[1:25:32] and lo Thou Art unto them
[1:25:35] as a very long very lovely song of one
[1:25:38] that hath a pleasant voice and can play
[1:25:40] well in an instrument for they hear thy
[1:25:42] words but they do not they do them not
[1:25:47] and when this cometh to pass
[1:25:52] Lo it will come
[1:25:55] then shall they know that a prophet has
[1:25:58] become been among them
[1:26:02] let's go to chapter 34.
[1:26:06] verse 1. and the word of the Lord came
[1:26:09] unto me saying Ezekiel again speaking
[1:26:12] son of man prophesy against the
[1:26:13] Shepherds of Israel prophesy and say
[1:26:15] unto them thus saith the Lord God unto
[1:26:17] the Shepherds woe be to the Shepherds of
[1:26:20] the flock to the Shepherds of Israel
[1:26:22] that do feed themselves should not the
[1:26:24] Shepherds feed the flock
[1:26:29] you eat the fat and you clothe you with
[1:26:33] wool you kill them
[1:26:35] that are fed
[1:26:37] but you feed not the flock
[1:26:39] the diseased have you not strengthened
[1:26:43] neither have you healed that which was
[1:26:44] sick look at the Samaritan
[1:26:47] look at what he did
[1:26:50] he he cared for the wounds
[1:26:55] neither have you bound up that which was
[1:26:56] broken
[1:26:58] he set the the injuries on the man
[1:27:05] neither have ye brought again that's
[1:27:07] which was driven away neither have you
[1:27:09] sought that which was lost but with
[1:27:12] force and with cruelty you have ruled
[1:27:14] them
[1:27:16] and they were scattered because there
[1:27:17] was no Shepherd
[1:27:19] and they became meat pray
[1:27:22] to all the beasts of the field when they
[1:27:25] were scattered my sheep wandered through
[1:27:27] all the mountains
[1:27:28] and upon every high heel yea my flock
[1:27:31] was scattered upon all the face of the
[1:27:32] Earth
[1:27:33] and none did search after them
[1:27:36] none did search or seek after them
[1:27:39] where are we
[1:27:42] are we searching out for that lost soul
[1:27:45] that lost sheep
[1:27:49] therefore ye Shepherds hear the word of
[1:27:51] the Lord
[1:27:52] and I know he's hitting the pastors
[1:27:56] as I live saith the Lord God surely
[1:27:58] because my flock became prey and my
[1:28:01] flock became meat to every beast of the
[1:28:03] field
[1:28:04] because there was no Shepherd
[1:28:08] neither did my shepherd search for my
[1:28:10] flock
[1:28:12] but the Shepherds fed themselves
[1:28:14] and fed not my flock
[1:28:17] therefore all you Shepherds hear the
[1:28:19] word of the Lord
[1:28:20] thus saith the Lord God behold I am
[1:28:22] against the Shepherds and I will require
[1:28:24] my flock at their hand
[1:28:26] and cause them to cease from feeding the
[1:28:29] flock neither shall the Shepherds feed
[1:28:31] themselves anymore if I will deliver my
[1:28:33] flock from their mouth
[1:28:35] and they shall not be meat for them
[1:28:38] then the Lord goes on in Ezekiel and he
[1:28:41] as always the Lord is so encouraging
[1:28:45] breaks us down
[1:28:47] but then
[1:28:49] he says I'm going to be their Shepherd
[1:28:52] I'm still they're mine
[1:28:55] they are God's predestinated before the
[1:28:58] foundation of the world I'm gonna take
[1:29:00] care of them but for you who didn't do
[1:29:03] it
[1:29:04] you're going to answer
[1:29:09] brother Ernie that's why one of the
[1:29:10] phone number for the brother
[1:29:12] I want to do my part
[1:29:15] if we if there's anything that we can do
[1:29:20] I wanna
[1:29:22] I Wanna Be There
[1:29:24] I want to reach out
[1:29:27] if someone needs something
[1:29:29] Lord as Isaiah said he said Lord send me
[1:29:34] I'm not worthy
[1:29:36] but send me
[1:29:42] think about
[1:29:44] again in closing
[1:29:48] back to DeShawn
[1:29:53] and obviously it's been heavy on my
[1:29:55] heart
[1:29:56] did I do everything that I I could have
[1:29:59] done no
[1:30:00] I could have done more and we will
[1:30:02] always say that I understand
[1:30:05] but
[1:30:07] in our lives
[1:30:10] those start with those that are around
[1:30:14] us
[1:30:15] what more can I do
[1:30:18] for the mothers and the dads for the
[1:30:20] children
[1:30:21] raise them
[1:30:23] so that they know this word
[1:30:27] admonish them
[1:30:30] be careful son be careful daughter
[1:30:33] because if you get too far into this
[1:30:37] you're gonna you might not make it all
[1:30:39] the way out
[1:30:42] think about think about that person
[1:30:45] the musicians can come
[1:30:49] and I think about
[1:30:56] Jesus came
[1:30:59] he died on the cross
[1:31:03] he was there he was spread out nail
[1:31:05] nails hammered in his hands Nails in his
[1:31:08] feet the son of God
[1:31:12] there and here he is up on the cross
[1:31:16] died
[1:31:18] for people that don't really care
[1:31:21] us
[1:31:23] how much do we really care
[1:31:25] how much do we really think about that
[1:31:27] man
[1:31:28] that was raised up
[1:31:30] that died for us
[1:31:32] do we really care about what he did
[1:31:38] there's a
[1:31:39] story that I tell
[1:31:41] about
[1:31:45] a judge
[1:31:47] about how
[1:31:49] a sinner
[1:31:52] person that
[1:31:55] that committed a crime
[1:31:58] committed a sin
[1:32:00] let's say that this person
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:05] did something dirty
[1:32:07] filthy
[1:32:09] got arrested for it maybe on a computer
[1:32:12] or something like that
[1:32:14] got arrested for it
[1:32:18] and that person
[1:32:20] goes before the judge
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:24] say in the arraignment
[1:32:27] goes before the judge and the judge
[1:32:29] reads
[1:32:31] the judge reads the the charges
[1:32:35] he says you did this and you did this
[1:32:38] and you did this and you did this and it
[1:32:40] was on your computer
[1:32:43] maybe you stole a bunch of money
[1:32:44] embezzled money or did something worse
[1:32:47] or whatever it is you did this here it
[1:32:49] was it was on your computer and you're
[1:32:51] and you're standing there
[1:32:53] and then
[1:32:55] someone else
[1:32:57] comes
[1:32:58] and says walks into the courtroom
[1:33:02] says no judge
[1:33:04] actually
[1:33:05] I gone to his computer computer and I
[1:33:08] did that
[1:33:10] I'm the one that's guilty
[1:33:13] and you look
[1:33:14] and you know what you did
[1:33:16] you know you committed the crime and you
[1:33:20] look and here is someone that that has
[1:33:22] never committed a crime in their life
[1:33:23] that's never done anything wrong and
[1:33:25] this man is saying no I'm the one that
[1:33:28] committed this crime and you say but you
[1:33:30] didn't
[1:33:31] I did
[1:33:32] and he stands before the judge and he
[1:33:34] says no judge I did it
[1:33:36] I'm the one that's guilty of this filthy
[1:33:39] crime
[1:33:41] I will suffer
[1:33:44] I will stand before the world and I will
[1:33:48] will be ridiculed made fun of
[1:33:52] I will do it because judge I committed
[1:33:57] that crime
[1:33:59] you look at him
[1:34:03] judge looks at you
[1:34:06] and he looks at this other person here
[1:34:08] that's taken your place
[1:34:11] you know what the judge said
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:16] the judge said okay
[1:34:18] he said Joe you're not guilty
[1:34:22] killed him
[1:34:24] this one that took your place
[1:34:26] this one that took my place kill him
[1:34:29] the Father the judge said that
[1:34:34] you can see why why Jesus then they put
[1:34:37] him up on the cross and nailed him up
[1:34:38] there's blood spilling out on the ground
[1:34:40] because of me because of my sins there
[1:34:43] it is piled up on the ground the
[1:34:45] sacrificial lamb that never did anything
[1:34:47] wrong up there for me Daniel Evans if
[1:34:51] it's not for any of you
[1:34:53] is for me that he was there how many
[1:34:56] things have I done wrong
[1:35:00] and here he is
[1:35:02] hung out on the cross
[1:35:04] and he says this he said you can see why
[1:35:07] he said
[1:35:08] his father why have you forsaken me
[1:35:12] the father's there you did it
[1:35:15] you will answer for every sin
[1:35:19] and here the guilty one
[1:35:22] me I just get to walk free
[1:35:26] it happened
[1:35:28] that's what it crosses for it happened
[1:35:30] for me
[1:35:31] every sin that you've created that
[1:35:33] you've done
[1:35:35] it lays on him if you will just accept
[1:35:37] him
[1:35:39] and I think about these people that have
[1:35:41] gone Lord did they really accept him
[1:35:44] [Music]
[1:35:46] did they accept that sacrifice
[1:35:52] do you understand what it means
[1:35:56] and he's up there on the cross and
[1:35:59] even to this day
[1:36:02] do people really care
[1:36:03] [Music]
[1:36:05] do we really know what he did for the
[1:36:08] individual
[1:36:10] not for someone else but for me
[1:36:13] do I understand what the Lord did for me
[1:36:16] to understand what Christ did for me
[1:36:20] and yet
[1:36:24] maybe I'll go to church today you know
[1:36:28] maybe I'll make a big effort
[1:36:31] get out of bed this morning and go to
[1:36:33] church
[1:36:35] maybe I'll witness to someone
[1:36:37] you know tell them tell them about Jesus
[1:36:39] oh yeah I'm a Christian
[1:36:42] but do you have that atmosphere do you
[1:36:44] have that Holy Spirit that same Spirit
[1:36:46] of Christ do you
[1:36:50] friends I would be not doing my job
[1:36:56] think about it
[1:36:57] what separates us What Separates Me from
[1:36:59] the world
[1:37:01] when I go somewhere do I look like the
[1:37:04] world
[1:37:06] do I act like the world so there's no
[1:37:08] difference in me than than this world
[1:37:12] do I take on the the
[1:37:15] look and the actions and the talk
[1:37:20] do I look like this world that's around
[1:37:24] or is there something special about me
[1:37:28] that people want to come to
[1:37:32] look at my little sweetheart there she
[1:37:34] she goes and she's a nurse and people
[1:37:37] they don't know her but why would they
[1:37:40] ask her to pray for them
[1:37:42] fault
[1:37:44] because she doesn't
[1:37:46] she looks like a Christian
[1:37:50] she looks different
[1:37:53] but Andy when you and I when we go to
[1:37:55] work there should be something about
[1:37:57] different about us
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:00] that atmosphere that we create
[1:38:04] it should be representing Christ
[1:38:07] does it does it in your life
[1:38:11] the stakes as I read in Ezekiel the
[1:38:14] stakes are very high they're high for
[1:38:16] all of us
[1:38:20] these are perilous times
[1:38:23] this is the end
[1:38:25] I told the story
[1:38:28] beginning
[1:38:30] about fore running the second coming of
[1:38:32] Christ and look at all the signs that we
[1:38:36] see
[1:38:38] all the filth in the world
[1:38:40] it's never been this film
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:44] look at
[1:38:45] I mean the obvious things
[1:38:48] you know we see that we try to
[1:38:52] we might talk about
[1:38:55] the
[1:38:57] I mean
[1:38:58] filth but are we reaching out to people
[1:39:03] brother Arnie was
[1:39:05] we were talking yesterday and there was
[1:39:07] a there was a young man that came in his
[1:39:09] name's Alex and he came in he sat in the
[1:39:11] back brother Arnie had witnessed to him
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:15] he listened to the sermon I walked back
[1:39:19] there he says brother I need to talk to
[1:39:20] you he says what you said in your sermon
[1:39:22] is exactly what I've gone through
[1:39:25] he said he said already over there he
[1:39:28] said he witnessed to me he says I was
[1:39:30] just walking by and he invited me in and
[1:39:32] he said here I am
[1:39:35] everybody left the the congregation but
[1:39:38] Arnie and I came up here we knelt down
[1:39:40] right here on this platform
[1:39:43] we prayed for the young man
[1:39:46] when it was a couple months ago brother
[1:39:51] Hardy was in the back seat we were
[1:39:54] driving yesterday and brother Arnie's
[1:39:56] weeping and he says well where did he go
[1:39:58] he's not he hasn't come back
[1:40:01] since we prayed for him
[1:40:03] see the burden of the holy spirit in
[1:40:07] brother Arnie calling out to that to
[1:40:10] that other person that just needed it
[1:40:13] he wanted so bad that burning desire
[1:40:19] brother Arnie we placed it in the hands
[1:40:21] of the almighty God
[1:40:24] these hands will fail
[1:40:26] just because he hasn't shown up it
[1:40:27] doesn't mean that we didn't go before
[1:40:29] the father
[1:40:30] and bring this young man to the Lord
[1:40:33] God heard those prayers
[1:40:36] God's watching that man wherever he is
[1:40:39] whatever he's doing he came through the
[1:40:41] Teen Challenge
[1:40:43] then he slipped back somehow he's
[1:40:47] walking by the church and he met a man
[1:40:48] of God
[1:40:50] came in here
[1:40:52] not done with this altar prayed for him
[1:40:55] praise God that we have that opportunity
[1:41:02] [Music]
[1:41:04] this is the end time
[1:41:05] [Music]
[1:41:07] who knows how long we'll be here
[1:41:10] we have to
[1:41:12] friends we if we look like the world if
[1:41:16] we act like the world if the world is
[1:41:18] our desire let me tell you as a minister
[1:41:22] of the Gospel there is something wrong
[1:41:24] in your life
[1:41:28] but then there is that tender heart
[1:41:31] says Lord
[1:41:33] what that man said
[1:41:37] I need the Lord
[1:41:40] I'd rather have that tender heart than I
[1:41:43] would
[1:41:44] to be that Pharisee
[1:41:46] or that that priest that walked by
[1:41:49] that man
[1:41:50] laying on the
[1:41:53] on the side of the road
[1:41:55] and I look and I'm guilty I've done the
[1:41:57] same thing
[1:41:57] [Music]
[1:42:00] but that cold Stony heart
[1:42:05] I would rather be brother Arnie I would
[1:42:08] rather be that street walker drug addict
[1:42:11] whatever it is and have a desire to
[1:42:13] serve God
[1:42:16] than I would
[1:42:17] to be that priest
[1:42:19] that didn't care
[1:42:24] and when I say when I'm talking about
[1:42:26] this I I hear that
[1:42:28] well it would be nice if you preach more
[1:42:30] about this or more about that I'm
[1:42:32] preaching I'm doing my best for this
[1:42:34] congregation what this congregation
[1:42:35] needs
[1:42:36] [Music]
[1:42:38] we need more of a desire to serve God
[1:42:42] we need to talk to him
[1:42:45] all these other things these rules and
[1:42:47] regulations are good that's fine
[1:42:49] but we need Christ
[1:42:52] let me tell you if there's a desire in
[1:42:54] your heart
[1:42:55] to serve him and you act on that desire
[1:42:58] he will answer I promise you amen
[1:43:04] is there a desire
[1:43:06] friends is there a desire in anyone here
[1:43:10] let me tell you
[1:43:13] there's a desire in my heart
[1:43:16] I think about how I short I come
[1:43:19] think about one of us what a sinner I am
[1:43:22] and all the things that I do wrong
[1:43:24] and I think about that man on the cross
[1:43:27] I think about what he did for me
[1:43:30] think about that judge that judge that
[1:43:32] looked down
[1:43:34] looking down at me
[1:43:36] all of these sins
[1:43:39] every single one of them will send me to
[1:43:41] hell
[1:43:44] eternal separation from God torment
[1:43:49] demons awful
[1:43:53] there he is
[1:43:55] man on this cross and he said I did it
[1:44:00] he said Daniel Evans isn't guilty
[1:44:03] he says in fact he never sinned
[1:44:08] he said this guy right here has never
[1:44:10] done anything wrong
[1:44:12] he said I'm the filthy one
[1:44:15] Jesus Christ
[1:44:16] the Lamb of God said I'm the filthy one
[1:44:20] taken taking my nails taking my torment
[1:44:27] going before the father going up on the
[1:44:29] cross
[1:44:30] saying I did it
[1:44:33] but thank God he did
[1:44:37] I'm not worthy but I'm thankful
[1:44:41] Lord
[1:44:42] I lay my sins freely upon the Lamb of
[1:44:46] God
[1:44:48] thank you all I can say is thank you
[1:44:51] Lord I can't I can't do anything to
[1:44:54] deserve it
[1:44:55] the only thing I can do is I can say
[1:44:57] Lord I'll serve you the rest of my life
[1:45:00] thing that I can
[1:45:08] I ask you insincerity
[1:45:12] if you are not where you should be with
[1:45:14] the Lord
[1:45:16] then you need
[1:45:18] to make a move
[1:45:20] DeSean was a young man
[1:45:23] the Lord took him like that
[1:45:25] who knows how many of us are going to be
[1:45:27] here tomorrow
[1:45:30] and then that time is up that time of
[1:45:31] repentance you'll never get it again
[1:45:35] you think where will I go
[1:45:38] when I come before that judge
[1:45:41] and I don't have the blood his blood on
[1:45:45] me
[1:45:47] the only time I have to do it is now
[1:45:50] if I don't have his blood on me
[1:45:53] if he didn't stand for me because I
[1:45:55] didn't just make this simple the simple
[1:45:58] move
[1:46:00] of saying Lord I'll serve you I'm going
[1:46:01] to do my best from here on out
[1:46:05] the time is coming
[1:46:08] I pray that every one of us here knows
[1:46:17] and you're welcome to
[1:46:19] come to the altar you're welcome to
[1:46:23] pray in your seats
[1:46:26] I'm just telling you
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:32] as a warning the Lord laid it on my
[1:46:34] heart
[1:46:37] we need to be careful
[1:46:41] because it's time
[1:46:45] the Lord may come for me today tomorrow
[1:46:47] it may come for you today
[1:46:51] may come for you tomorrow and then the
[1:46:52] time of repentance is over
[1:46:57] when I come before the judge
[1:46:59] the man on the cross stood for me and I
[1:47:02] thank God for him
[1:47:04] he took the filth that is Daniel Evans
[1:47:09] Amazing Grace says he's saved a Wretch
[1:47:12] like Me
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:16] their heads bowed
[1:47:21] praying
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:25] sinner I prayed
[1:47:27] you come to Christ
[1:47:30] and every one of us we dedicate Our
[1:47:33] Lives to the Lord today
[1:47:35] open up our hearts to his gospel
[1:47:39] don't be like the world
[1:47:42] separate yourself from the world don't
[1:47:43] look like the world don't act like the
[1:47:45] world it's not worth it
[1:47:49] come to Christ
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:57] Lord Jesus
[1:48:01] Lord I even have trouble saying your
[1:48:04] name
[1:48:08] how good you are Lord
[1:48:12] not worthy
[1:48:14] I'm not worthy to say it
[1:48:18] no dear Lord I love you so much
[1:48:23] you give my heart to you Lord
[1:48:26] I pray that each person in this audience
