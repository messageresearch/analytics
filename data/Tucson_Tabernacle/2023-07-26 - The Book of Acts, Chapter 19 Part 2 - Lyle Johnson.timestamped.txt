[16:52] it all
[16:54] if he would put up the scriptures there
[16:56] Isaiah chapter 53 Verses 4 and 5.
[17:01] just something to share here with you
[17:04] well-known verse
[17:07] you know and we know Jesus Christ is the
[17:10] same yesterday today and forever
[17:12] doesn't change
[17:14] Isaiah 53 4-5
[17:18] surely he have borne our griefs and
[17:21] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[17:24] him stricken Smit of God and afflicted
[17:28] but he was wounded for our
[17:29] transgressions he was bruised for our
[17:32] iniquities
[17:33] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[17:36] him
[17:37] and with his stripes we are healed
[17:40] and I just like to share some with you
[17:43] just something I heard and it spoke to
[17:45] my heart
[17:47] and they were talking about a confession
[17:49] a verbal confession
[17:51] and he was saying you hear a promise of
[17:54] God you hear the word of God and you nod
[17:56] your head and you go
[17:57] you maybe raise your hand
[17:59] but God likes to hear you speak his word
[18:03] and and so it just brought that
[18:05] scripture to me he was wounded for my
[18:08] transgressions he was bruised for my
[18:11] iniquities
[18:13] and you confess it back to him and he
[18:15] says amen and he puts it to work
[18:18] and I I just even in the singing of
[18:20] songs and in the praise as you're
[18:22] confessing God's word confessing your
[18:25] love to him as you confess his love to
[18:27] you amen so
[18:29] the battle is the Lord's
[18:35] remember him

[18:39] source in time of need that gives me
[18:41] hope

[33:30] that we have from Christ but but we
[33:34] labor for each other
[33:36] and and we love each other and and it
[33:39] means so much in talking with this

[33:46] was asking she said she said how much do

[40:10] rejected
[40:12] going into the land and they spent 40
[40:15] years wandering in the wilderness till
[40:16] that generation passed away

[40:59] Jews were expelled from England in 1306
[41:03] on this day the Jews were expelled from
[41:07] France in 1492 on this day the Jews were
[41:12] expelled from Spain in 1914
[41:16] Germany and World War One
[41:19] in 1941 Heinrich Himmler received the
[41:22] formal approval from the Nazi party for
[41:24] the final solution the extermination of
[41:27] the Jewish people
[41:28] in 1942
[41:30] began the mass deportation of the Jews
[41:33] from the Warsaw Ghetto to the death camp
[41:36] at Treblinka
[41:39] brother Jeremy if you could put up those
[41:40] two verses from Ecclesiastes that that
[41:43] come to mind
[41:45] Ecclesiastes 3 1.
[41:48] to everything there's a season there's a
[41:51] time to every purpose under Heaven verse
[41:55] 4 a time to weep
[41:58] A Time To Laugh A Time a Time mourn
[42:01] a time to dance this is a very sad day a
[42:05] very heavy day for the Jewish people
[42:09] I just thought I'd share that with you
[42:11] since I'm not sure how many of you knew
[42:13] that today tonight is that anniversary
[42:16] the destruction of the temples the the
[42:19] rejection of the promise to enter the
[42:22] land so many things happened on that day
[42:28] tonight
[42:31] we'll be continuing our study in the
[42:33] book of Acts we started four months ago
[42:35] on March 22nd with brother Daniel
[42:38] teaching Acts 1.
[42:40] I'd plan to finish chapter 19 last
[42:43] Wednesday on the 19th but that didn't
[42:45] work out so we'll conclude it tonight
[42:48] uh there's much more here than you might
[42:51] suspect from a from a book burning and
[42:53] some disgruntled silversmiths
[42:55] I always wonder about that word
[42:56] disgruntled if you're not disgruntled
[42:58] does that mean you're gruntled
[43:01] I I don't know it's never made a lot of
[43:03] sense to me but anyway let's get started
[43:05] I'll have you here all night but before
[43:07] we open the Bible if we could stand
[43:10] please
[43:12] and approach the author
[43:16] Lord Jesus
[43:17] we have friends
[43:20] that are very sad tonight
[43:22] some of those friends
[43:25] are your children some of those friends
[43:27] have been called by your name some of
[43:30] those friends have embraced the gospel
[43:32] Lord Jesus we pray that you'd be with
[43:34] them and comfort them at this time as
[43:36] they reflect
[43:38] and Lord I pray that you be with us
[43:39] tonight help me Lord Jesus that they're
[43:41] not be loyal thoughts that there not be
[43:44] anything coming from any direction but
[43:46] from you Lord guard my lips Lord that I
[43:49] might not speak anything that would
[43:51] cause anyone difficulty or stumbling or
[43:54] hurt or harm but Lord that the words of
[43:56] life might flow forth and that we might
[43:58] all draw closer to you as we study your
[44:01] word and we thank you we thank you for
[44:04] this record that Luke provided for us
[44:06] that you inspired him to do so many
[44:09] years ago that we can draw blessings
[44:11] from it even today in Jesus name we pray
[44:15] amen
[44:17] Acts 19 relates the first portion of
[44:22] what we call Paul's third missionary
[44:24] journey
[44:25] this part of the Evangelistic effort
[44:27] takes place entirely within the city of
[44:30] Ephesus chapter 19 is only in the city
[44:34] of Ephesus and it covers a span of about
[44:36] three years
[44:38] the overall theme of this chapter is
[44:40] there's no substitute for the Holy
[44:43] Spirit
[44:43] I've subtitled this latter portion of it
[44:47] consider the context the context of this
[44:50] account was understood by first century
[44:52] believers
[44:53] but it's much less apparent to us after
[44:55] 20 centuries just as teshav is not
[44:58] something that we think about but it's
[45:00] the context that shows us how powerful
[45:04] and how different
[45:07] if Paul's Ministry was
[45:09] an Ephesus
[45:11] to help set the stage of tonight's
[45:13] section of Acts 19 let's turn in our
[45:14] Bibles first through the book of Exodus
[45:16] the 20th chapter and then we'll read a
[45:18] short segment from Acts 19.
[45:20] The Exodus setting
[45:22] is Mount Sinai during the third calendar
[45:25] month after Moses led the enslaved
[45:26] Israelite Nation out of bondage in Egypt
[45:29] recall Passover began in the middle of
[45:32] the first month Jewish tradition says
[45:35] that it was 50 days after Passover on
[45:37] the day otherwise celebrated as a Feast
[45:39] of Weeks the day we call Pentecost that
[45:42] God gave the law to Moses
[45:44] now when you found Exodus 20 raise your
[45:47] hand say Amen let me know we're there
[45:48] some of you were there okay enough of
[45:51] you were there I'll put some more of it
[45:53] up here for you okay
[45:55] and God spake all these words this
[45:58] wasn't some guy
[46:00] this was God God spake these words
[46:03] saying I am the Lord thy God
[46:06] which have brought thee out of the land
[46:07] of Egypt out of the house of bondage
[46:09] Moses didn't bring you out I brought you
[46:11] out
[46:12] Thou shalt have no other gods before me
[46:15] no other gods none
[46:18] Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven
[46:21] image or any likeness of anything that's
[46:23] in Heaven above or the Earth beneath or
[46:26] that's in the water under the Earth Thou
[46:28] shalt not bow down themselves to them
[46:30] nor serve them
[46:31] for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God
[46:34] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[46:36] upon the children under the third and
[46:38] fourth generation of them that hate me
[46:40] and showing Mercy unto thousands of them
[46:43] that love me and that's just not
[46:45] everybody loves me I'm picking thousands
[46:47] no there are thousands that love him and
[46:49] he's showing Mercy to every one of them
[46:51] that love me and keep my Commandments
[46:54] and now if you'll turn to acts 18 just 3
[46:57] verses 19 to 21 that's a flashback
[47:00] to the end of Paul's second Journey he
[47:03] had just left Corinth after 18 months
[47:06] sailing for Ephesus accompanied by his
[47:09] friends Aquila
[47:10] and Priscilla
[47:13] and he that's Paul came to Ephesus and
[47:16] left them that's Akila and Priscilla
[47:18] there but he himself entered into the
[47:20] synagogue and reasoned his method of
[47:23] teaching which we described last time he
[47:26] reasoned with the Jews
[47:28] I picked up on that word reason it's
[47:31] such harmony with Isaiah 1 18 come now
[47:34] and let us reason together
[47:36] saith the Lord why why a purpose to what
[47:41] end though your sins be as Scarlet they
[47:44] shall be white as snow though they'd be
[47:46] red like crimson
[47:49] they shall be his wool
[47:51] as precisely the message that Paul's
[47:53] bringing the good news of the Gospel
[47:54] forgiveness for those sins purification
[47:58] and when they the Jewish people of the
[48:01] sunniac desired him to Cherry longer
[48:03] with them he said nope and send it not
[48:06] when he paid them for a will he said I
[48:08] must by all means keep this Feast that's
[48:10] coming in Jerusalem but I will return
[48:13] again unto you God willing
[48:15] and you sailed from Ephesus
[48:18] please be seated
[48:21] by way of quick review Paul's first
[48:23] journey with Barnabas was in Cyprus
[48:26] phrygia and galatia the second Journey
[48:29] with Silas started in galatia and frigia
[48:32] then went on to Europe through Philippi
[48:35] thessalonica and Berea three cities of
[48:38] Macedonia they continued to Ikea that's
[48:41] Greece including Athens and especially
[48:44] Corinth
[48:45] Paul stayed for more than a year and a
[48:48] half in Corinth
[48:50] Sin City is brother Daniel pointed out
[48:53] to us before returning home to Antioch
[48:56] of Syria by way of Ephesus and Jerusalem
[49:00] the third Journey that we're now
[49:01] following started yet again in galatia
[49:04] and forget but Luke simply mentions
[49:06] these districts with no details that
[49:08] ball went through there Acts 19 begins
[49:10] with Paul's arrival in Ephesus now in
[49:13] the first portion of Acts 19 which we
[49:16] studied a fortnight ago that's an
[49:18] English word it means two weeks
[49:21] Paul began his ministry in Ephesus with
[49:24] baptism and the necessity of receiving
[49:27] the Holy Spirit
[49:29] we saw how Paul gently respectfully led
[49:33] a group of 12 disciples of Apollos who
[49:36] had since traveled onto Corinth further
[49:38] into the truth until they received the
[49:41] gift of the indwelling Holy Spirit and
[49:44] their lives
[49:45] Paul then went to the synagogue and
[49:47] after three months of teaching and then
[49:51] being pretty well rejected he decided to
[49:53] continue his teaching and the school of
[49:55] a person named tyrannus
[49:57] he taught there for at least two more
[50:00] years
[50:01] during this time we read that Miracles
[50:03] occurred in the form of healings and
[50:05] exorcisms to the mechanism of towels and
[50:08] aprons which Paul had touched
[50:10] we ended part one of chapter 19.
[50:13] with an incident
[50:15] or seven men
[50:17] sons of a Jewish priest attempted
[50:19] exorcism to cast out demons using the
[50:22] name of Jesus whom Paul preaches
[50:25] but they lacked the life behind the name
[50:30] the possessed man Paul I know Jesus I
[50:33] know who are you
[50:35] he attacked these seven guys overpowered
[50:38] them they fled from that building
[50:39] injured and naked
[50:42] word of all this spread new Believers
[50:45] had real fear of God
[50:48] came confessing
[50:49] their past sins
[50:53] I thought I'd bring up this map where
[50:55] I've circled in in yellow where Ephesus
[50:58] is located in and what they called Asia
[51:00] we think of it as a western part of
[51:02] turkey the the red circles are around
[51:05] Antioch of facidia troas Philippi
[51:08] thessalonica Berea Athens Corinth these
[51:12] are cities where Paul's ministered as
[51:13] we've previously read in Acts
[51:15] you can see they're almost all cities
[51:18] around the Aegean Sea
[51:22] note many islands in the Aegean
[51:25] especially you can see there in the
[51:27] southern part between Ephesus and going
[51:29] across to to Athens hazards to
[51:32] navigation in a world with no GPS they
[51:36] didn't even have compasses that didn't
[51:37] come until about 1270 A.D
[51:40] they had no accurate Maps
[51:43] just fragile wooden boots
[51:46] Paul's Ministry in Asia Minor part of
[51:48] what we call turkey in Europe largely
[51:50] took place in the coastal cities around
[51:53] the Aegean
[51:55] well I'm sure you're asking yourself so
[51:58] what's all this was cities why did Paul
[52:01] go to cities and not rural areas you
[52:03] know where the salt of the earth are not
[52:04] cities right
[52:07] Paul generally started his evangelism
[52:09] and Jewish synagogues
[52:12] such synagogues only existed in cities
[52:15] that have been in existence for a few
[52:17] centuries as we discovered in Philippi
[52:20] that was a new city only some 80 years
[52:22] old and had no history of settlement
[52:24] before that as a result when the Jewish
[52:26] people were scattered over the previous
[52:28] 500 years tejab 586 BC
[52:33] they had no reason to settle in the area
[52:36] that became Philippi but they could
[52:38] settle and make a living and establish
[52:41] themselves in the then existing cities
[52:43] Jeremiah for example wrote and told
[52:46] those carried to Babylon to settle and
[52:48] to prosper there Jeremiah 29 verses 4-7
[52:53] and can't you just see the hand of the
[52:56] Lord in all of this
[52:58] consider
[53:00] the Lord knew exactly when he would come
[53:03] in the flesh of Jesus Christ he knew the
[53:06] minimum state of required civilization
[53:09] before his coming would be able to
[53:11] accomplish its goal
[53:14] he knew the Kingdom of Israel would fail
[53:16] and fall
[53:17] so the scattering of the Jewish people
[53:19] took place at just the right time in
[53:21] history
[53:22] so there would be settlements scattered
[53:23] throughout the Mediterranean world with
[53:25] the Jewish presence
[53:28] why
[53:29] well this was in part so an evangelist
[53:32] known as Paul of Tarsus could spread the
[53:35] good news
[53:36] and that the newly minted Christians
[53:38] would have a place to go where the word
[53:40] of God could be heard on a regular basis
[53:42] through the preaching and reading and
[53:45] the synagogues
[53:48] synagogues only came into being after
[53:50] the Babylonian captivity the destruction
[53:52] of Jerusalem when there was neither
[53:54] Tabernacle nor Temple the entire
[53:57] infrastructure needed for Effective
[53:59] early evangelism was thus brought about
[54:03] patiently over a period of some 500 or
[54:06] 600 years
[54:08] and just as soon as it was ready
[54:11] Jesus appeared
[54:14] Christians shared the same sacred texts
[54:17] as the Jewish people there was no new
[54:19] testament
[54:21] Testament we're told that faith comes by
[54:24] hearing the word of God Galatians 3
[54:26] Romans 10. synagogues were the places
[54:29] where that occurred
[54:31] in those days people were generally
[54:33] non-literate they couldn't read
[54:35] manuscripts Scrolls and the like were
[54:38] incredibly expensive far beyond the
[54:40] means that most people to acquire even
[54:42] if they did have the skill to read
[54:44] but in synagogues portions of scripture
[54:47] were read aloud every Sabbath
[54:51] as you study history
[54:53] even geography
[54:55] you can find God's fingerprints
[54:57] everywhere
[55:00] but you have to look
[55:01] just like police detectives applied
[55:03] powders to reveal potential fingerprints
[55:06] if they find any they lift or otherwise
[55:08] record them compare them to a vast
[55:10] database of fingerprints to find out
[55:12] whose they are
[55:13] this process is not instant can be quite
[55:16] time consuming it requires effort
[55:19] diligence dedication
[55:22] and care
[55:23] and that's how we need to approach the
[55:25] word this evening last time we ended
[55:27] with Acts 19 Verse 18 we'll pick up
[55:29] there and continue now with our study
[55:33] and many that believed came and
[55:36] confessed
[55:37] and showed their deeds the Amplified
[55:39] Bible puts it this way many also of
[55:42] those who were now Believers came making
[55:44] full confession as brother Aaron
[55:47] mentioned Isaiah 53 confess with your
[55:50] mouth full confession and thoroughly
[55:52] exposing their former deceptive and evil
[55:55] practices in other words
[55:57] the fear of God came on those professing
[55:59] Christ
[56:00] they saw there were consequences to
[56:02] pretending
[56:03] to lacking the life behind the name
[56:07] and not only that but verse 19 many of
[56:10] them also which used curious Arts
[56:12] practitioners of the occult sorcery
[56:16] Magic
[56:17] they brought their books it says books
[56:19] but we're talking about Scrolls perhaps
[56:22] including codices which is kind of the
[56:24] earliest form of a book there are books
[56:26] of spells and incantations and Magic
[56:30] they brought them together and burned
[56:32] them before all men
[56:34] this was done in public in full View
[56:37] of the entire city
[56:39] and they counted the price of them these
[56:41] books and they found it to be 50 000
[56:44] pieces of silver
[56:46] what's 50 000 pieces of silver mean if
[56:49] you convert it to Modern monetary value
[56:51] it's it's difficult I'm sure you've all
[56:53] noticed grocery store prices this year a
[56:55] lot different than they were two years
[56:56] ago
[56:58] so
[56:59] we're told that that a a drachma is is
[57:03] kind of a unit of currency 50 000 of
[57:06] those as it was represented here
[57:08] but books and Scrolls were very very
[57:11] expensive they were all made by hand and
[57:14] these sorts of books would have been
[57:16] extremely rare rare protected by the
[57:19] practitioners of the incantation zone so
[57:22] oh the secret stuff we can't share that
[57:24] with you
[57:26] and through this
[57:28] verse 20 so mightily grew the word of
[57:31] God
[57:32] and prevailed continued in a powerful
[57:34] way it grew an influence now to prevail
[57:38] means there's resistance there's
[57:40] opposition there's a struggle something
[57:43] has to be overcome
[57:45] they don't Prevail if there's nothing
[57:46] that you're fighting against
[57:49] verse 19 here it's a little bit nuanced
[57:51] the ones who practice these arts and
[57:53] burned their books
[57:55] were like those of Verse 18 converts to
[57:58] Christ these are new Christians
[58:01] they didn't want to sell their books
[58:04] they easily could have
[58:06] they were worth a lot but they were
[58:09] denouncing the contents of the books
[58:11] they didn't want to spread those
[58:13] practices
[58:14] that were described in them
[58:16] any further
[58:18] I don't know if you realize it if you
[58:20] think about it these people were
[58:23] destroying their means of livelihood
[58:27] no turning back
[58:29] they'd made a full commitment
[58:32] and consider the impact
[58:35] this is a very large collection of these
[58:38] Scrolls books
[58:39] that that drachma the unit of coinage
[58:42] it's represented was a day's wage for
[58:44] one who worked for wages
[58:47] at six days a week
[58:49] that would work out to a little over 160
[58:51] man years
[58:54] at an equivalent today of say fifty
[58:56] thousand dollars a year that's a bit
[58:58] over eight million dollars equivalent
[59:01] so we have to ask ourselves
[59:07] was it important
[59:09] that this public book burning took place
[59:12] in Ephesus
[59:14] if so
[59:16] in what way is that significant
[59:19] would it have had the same effect or be
[59:21] so important that Luke would record it
[59:23] and ask for us if if it were in a
[59:25] neighboring town or maybe even a
[59:26] different city say thyatira or
[59:28] Philadelphia or laodicea
[59:31] how does this event support the
[59:34] assertion of verse 20 so mightily grew
[59:36] the word of God
[59:37] and prevailed
[59:42] we've looked at maps to see the cities
[59:44] where the gospels spread the message of
[59:46] Grace and salvation to the Roman world
[59:49] we've talked a bit about cities
[59:50] Jerusalem the significance of the
[59:52] location where Peter preached on
[59:54] Pentecost caesarea its significance as
[59:58] Cornelius household came to know the
[1:00:00] Lord Philippi what it meant to be a
[1:00:03] Roman Colony Corinth the hedonistic
[1:00:06] debauchery of its lifestyle in fact even
[1:00:09] of its religious practice
[1:00:11] Athens its multitude of Idols it was
[1:00:13] said it's easier to find an idol in
[1:00:16] Athens than another human being
[1:00:18] by this time
[1:00:20] Paul has spent about three years in
[1:00:24] Ephesus
[1:00:25] so let's take a closer look at this city
[1:00:29] this time not from a perspective of
[1:00:31] geography
[1:00:33] but from a perspective of history and
[1:00:35] archeology
[1:00:38] rather than just being a port city on
[1:00:40] the Turkish Coast
[1:00:42] Ephesus
[1:00:45] well here's a drawing of what Ephesus
[1:00:47] might have looked like Ephesus was
[1:00:49] founded about the 10th or 11th century
[1:00:52] BC
[1:00:53] that's around the time that David ruled
[1:00:55] in Israel
[1:00:57] if we skip down to about a thousand
[1:00:58] years to the time of Caesar Augustus
[1:01:01] he made it the capital of the province
[1:01:03] of Asia this region of Western turkey it
[1:01:06] was an important cultural trade
[1:01:08] commercial and political Center
[1:01:11] it's also an important port it was a
[1:01:13] major city in Paul's day
[1:01:15] since its destruction and abandonment
[1:01:17] around 263 A.D the Lagoon Harbor is
[1:01:21] silted up the Mediterranean is now a
[1:01:23] couple of miles away from the ancient
[1:01:25] city location
[1:01:27] at its height
[1:01:28] its population had long been estimated
[1:01:30] to have been as many as a quarter
[1:01:32] million but estimates now based on
[1:01:35] archaeological findings suggests it was
[1:01:37] closer to about fifty thousand
[1:01:39] that's still a large city
[1:01:41] either way
[1:01:43] but it turns out
[1:01:45] that there were three key features
[1:01:49] of Ephesus
[1:01:51] that are related to Acts chapter 19.
[1:01:55] and why
[1:01:57] these things come together and make it
[1:01:59] important let's look at the first one
[1:02:01] now we've just read of a very public a
[1:02:04] huge book burning now they weren't
[1:02:07] e-books they didn't just delete files or
[1:02:10] apps from their eye stones
[1:02:14] nowaday we search for information on the
[1:02:16] world wide web via the Internet
[1:02:19] when I was in school we used
[1:02:20] encyclopedias for a quick look up and
[1:02:22] went to a library for further research
[1:02:25] and the world of the first century
[1:02:27] there was no internet
[1:02:30] there were no encyclopedias
[1:02:32] books were expensive most people
[1:02:34] couldn't read anyway
[1:02:35] but if you were literate libraries were
[1:02:39] rare
[1:02:40] the volumes they contained almost
[1:02:42] priceless
[1:02:45] but Ephesus contained a library
[1:02:50] unlike America today libraries were not
[1:02:53] common in the world of the first century
[1:02:55] in fact they were extremely rare
[1:03:00] Ephesus contained what some report is
[1:03:02] the third largest library in the ancient
[1:03:05] Mediterranean world after Alexandria and
[1:03:08] pergamum it much smaller than those two
[1:03:11] but it nevertheless housed more than
[1:03:13] twelve thousand schools
[1:03:17] the little inset there is a is a a seven
[1:03:20] Branch Menorah that was carved into the
[1:03:22] steps of the library that's still
[1:03:24] visible again confirming a Jewish
[1:03:26] presence
[1:03:28] so a book burning
[1:03:30] in front of such a large and rare
[1:03:33] Library
[1:03:35] took on a special significance
[1:03:37] I'm sure the Librarians or whatever they
[1:03:39] called the officers in charge of
[1:03:41] preserving to protecting the documents
[1:03:43] would have been a gasp hey don't burn
[1:03:46] those are valuable if you will gladly
[1:03:49] purchase them for our collection we're
[1:03:51] known for our magnificent Library how
[1:03:53] can you do this please stop the
[1:03:55] sacrilege please let us place valuable
[1:03:59] and rare items in our collection for
[1:04:01] others to learn enhance the glory of
[1:04:04] Ephesus
[1:04:07] above all
[1:04:08] it showed the powerful influence that
[1:04:10] Paul's preaching was having
[1:04:13] and isn't it interesting
[1:04:16] that one of the most impressive remains
[1:04:20] and restorations in ancient Ephesus one
[1:04:22] of only a few major remains which are
[1:04:24] even restorable
[1:04:26] is the Magnificent Stone facade
[1:04:30] the library
[1:04:33] even the rocks cry out in testimony and
[1:04:36] witness of the truth of the Gospel
[1:04:39] I mentioned three aspects of ancient
[1:04:41] Ephesus that tie into acts 19's
[1:04:43] narrative providing context to Luke's
[1:04:47] account
[1:04:48] this Library
[1:04:50] is the first one I will get to the other
[1:04:52] two shortly so don't go away
[1:04:54] let's get back to Acts 19 and continue
[1:04:56] on
[1:04:58] after these things were ended
[1:05:00] that is after the more than two-year
[1:05:03] sojourn in Ephesus the ministry of
[1:05:06] Miracles through prayer Clause the
[1:05:08] attack by the possessed on those who
[1:05:11] tried to use the name of Jesus without
[1:05:13] possessing The Life of Christ
[1:05:15] the conversion of practitioners of the
[1:05:17] occult
[1:05:18] now the massive book burning Paul
[1:05:21] purposed in the spirit
[1:05:24] when he had passed through Macedonia and
[1:05:26] Ikea to go to Jerusalem and saying after
[1:05:30] I've been there
[1:05:31] I must also see Rome
[1:05:34] in other words after Ephesus Paul
[1:05:37] planned to go to Macedonia
[1:05:39] then okay yeah Greece and then on to
[1:05:42] Jerusalem much as he had done on his
[1:05:43] previous Journey after that he intended
[1:05:46] to go to Rome it's the first mention of
[1:05:49] Paul's desire
[1:05:51] to go to Rome
[1:05:53] so he sent ahead of him into Macedonia
[1:05:56] two of them that ministered unto him to
[1:05:58] mothius the fellow we know is Timothy
[1:06:00] and erastus but he himself stayed in
[1:06:03] Asia for a season while they prepared
[1:06:05] things for his arrival in Macedonia
[1:06:09] unlike Luke's narrative about the
[1:06:11] previous missionary Journeys he's not
[1:06:13] told
[1:06:14] companions or on this third epic journey
[1:06:16] of evangelism
[1:06:18] he hasn't told us about a Barnabas or a
[1:06:20] Silas We Now find out Timothy was with
[1:06:22] him as well as a person we have
[1:06:25] previously met erastus he was later with
[1:06:28] Paul and Corinth later on this third
[1:06:30] Journey from which city later it is
[1:06:33] generally thought that Paul would write
[1:06:34] the epistle to the Romans
[1:06:37] Romans 16 1-2 suggests Phoebe of kentria
[1:06:42] at the other end of the Port Road of
[1:06:43] Corinth that we think we talked about
[1:06:46] that 6.8 kilometers because it's in
[1:06:48] Europe right instead of four miles
[1:06:50] because it's not in America
[1:06:51] carried that letter from Corinth to Rome
[1:06:55] Paul wrote Romans to introduce himself
[1:06:57] and help prepare for his anticipated
[1:06:59] arrival
[1:07:00] a letter of great depth
[1:07:02] in the basic doctor
[1:07:05] do you recall which cities were in
[1:07:07] Macedonia that Paul would be wanting to
[1:07:10] revisit
[1:07:11] cities with churches he had started
[1:07:15] Philippi we recall the conversion of
[1:07:17] Lydia the Uproar the beating the jailing
[1:07:20] in stocks the conversion of the Jailer
[1:07:23] in his household the apology of the
[1:07:25] magistrates
[1:07:26] later during Paul's imprisonment in Rome
[1:07:29] we would get the epistle to the
[1:07:30] Philippians as part of our very Bible
[1:07:33] thessalonica a brief ministry here he's
[1:07:36] only there about three weeks recorded in
[1:07:38] Acts 17. yet enough was accomplished in
[1:07:41] that brief space of time that we get two
[1:07:43] Epistles in our Bible helping that
[1:07:46] church deal with such questions as must
[1:07:48] I be alive when the Lord returns to not
[1:07:51] miss the blessing of eternal life
[1:07:54] for real
[1:07:55] here are the people that heard Paul and
[1:07:57] Silas search the scriptures they didn't
[1:07:59] want to just take their word for
[1:08:00] something
[1:08:01] either do they choose to dismiss it out
[1:08:04] of hand because it was a different
[1:08:05] perspective than that with which they
[1:08:08] were familiar
[1:08:09] Luke
[1:08:10] says that they were more noble
[1:08:13] there were other cities you probably
[1:08:14] visited Luke mentioned they passed their
[1:08:16] amphipholus and the Polonia which lie
[1:08:18] along the road between Philippi and
[1:08:20] thessalonica they're not otherwise
[1:08:22] mentioned in the book of Acts but let's
[1:08:24] get back to Ephesus
[1:08:26] it's generally accepted that Paul wrote
[1:08:29] first and second Corinthians during this
[1:08:31] three-year stay in Ephesus
[1:08:34] it's likely that he sent Timothy and
[1:08:36] erastus by Cedar Corinth to deliver the
[1:08:39] Second Epistle help the church there
[1:08:41] then head up to Macedonia to meet Paul
[1:08:43] when he arrived
[1:08:46] another Point worth mentioning
[1:08:48] is that Paul's Ministry in Ephesus was
[1:08:50] long and had huge impact as Luke relates
[1:08:53] to us throughout acts 19. tremendous
[1:08:55] impact
[1:08:56] but what Luke does not mention
[1:09:00] is that it was by no means easy he talks
[1:09:04] about the people after three months in
[1:09:07] the synagogue that
[1:09:09] pushed back and so he went to a
[1:09:10] different place but in fact
[1:09:13] it was arduous
[1:09:15] and it was dangerous
[1:09:19] Paul did not for example have the
[1:09:21] Assurance from the Lord that he would
[1:09:22] not face persecution in Ephesus remember
[1:09:25] that he received this in Corinth on his
[1:09:27] previous Journey
[1:09:29] acts 18 we read then as he started his
[1:09:31] ministry in Corinth spake the Lord to
[1:09:33] Paul in the Night by a vision be not
[1:09:35] afraid
[1:09:37] speak
[1:09:39] don't hold your peace for I am with thee
[1:09:42] no man shall set on thee to hurt thee
[1:09:45] for I have much people in this city
[1:09:48] and Paul continued there a year and six
[1:09:51] months teaching the word of God among
[1:09:54] them
[1:09:55] 18 months
[1:09:56] free of physical persecution
[1:10:00] no wonder he stayed
[1:10:02] we'll see a bit later this evening why
[1:10:04] this was such a tremendous comfort for
[1:10:06] Paul
[1:10:07] in First Corinthians 15.
[1:10:10] as Paul is pleading with the Corinthians
[1:10:13] regarding their way of life he refers to
[1:10:15] his work in Ephesus and alludes to the
[1:10:18] dangers he constantly faces there and in
[1:10:21] verse 31
[1:10:23] King James version says I protest by
[1:10:26] your rejoicing which I have in Christ
[1:10:27] Jesus our lord
[1:10:29] I Die daily
[1:10:31] if after the manner of men I have fought
[1:10:33] with beasts at Ephesus
[1:10:35] what advantage is it to me if the dead
[1:10:38] rise not let us eat and drink tomorrow
[1:10:40] we die
[1:10:42] the NLT expresses it this way
[1:10:45] I swear to your brothers and sisters
[1:10:47] that I face death daily
[1:10:51] this is as certain as my pride in with
[1:10:53] Christ Jesus our lord has done in you
[1:10:54] what value was there in fighting wild
[1:10:57] beasts those people of Ephesus
[1:11:00] if there will be no Resurrection from
[1:11:02] the dead if there's no Resurrection
[1:11:04] let's feast and drink tomorrow we die
[1:11:06] he Compares reaching the people of
[1:11:09] Ephesus
[1:11:10] fighting wild beasts and I don't think
[1:11:14] he met squirrels and rabbits
[1:11:17] consider what he says
[1:11:19] about this ongoing work in Ephesus in
[1:11:22] the opening chapter of second
[1:11:25] Corinthians would have been written
[1:11:27] towards the end of his day in Ephesus
[1:11:29] you will note that
[1:11:31] we when we read it Paul refers to
[1:11:34] troubles while he was in Asia
[1:11:37] well remember the first journey
[1:11:39] he never went there he didn't go to Asia
[1:11:41] the second Journey he was forbidden to
[1:11:43] go there at the beginning and just stop
[1:11:44] briefly in Ephesus to drop off Priscilla
[1:11:47] and Aquila on his way home
[1:11:49] in his third Journey he's spending three
[1:11:51] years in Ephesus and it's only stop in
[1:11:54] all of Asia
[1:11:55] for any significant time so the
[1:11:57] reference in second Corinthians to Asia
[1:11:59] is a reference to this third Journey's
[1:12:02] major stop it's a reference to Acts 19.
[1:12:06] Don't You Love
[1:12:08] how the New Testament ties us all
[1:12:09] together so perfectly
[1:12:11] let's read second Corinthians 1 and 8.
[1:12:16] for we would not Brethren of Corinth
[1:12:19] have you ignorant uh you to know of our
[1:12:23] trouble which came to us in Asia in
[1:12:26] Ephesus that we were pressed out of
[1:12:29] measure
[1:12:30] above strength our strength unable to
[1:12:34] bear in so much that we despaired even
[1:12:36] of life
[1:12:38] of living through these pressures
[1:12:40] opposition
[1:12:42] persecution
[1:12:44] but we had the sentence of death in
[1:12:46] ourselves that we should not trust in
[1:12:49] ourselves but in God which raises the
[1:12:52] Dead the complete Jewish Bible puts it
[1:12:54] and our hearts we felt we were under
[1:12:56] sentence of death
[1:12:58] however this was to get us to rely not
[1:13:00] on ourselves but on God who raises the
[1:13:04] Dead
[1:13:05] verse 10.
[1:13:07] who delivered us from so great a death
[1:13:09] and death deliver in whom we trust he
[1:13:11] will yet Deliver Us
[1:13:14] again the complete Jewish Bible says he
[1:13:16] rescued us from such deadly Peril and he
[1:13:19] will rescue us again
[1:13:20] the one in whom we have placed Our Hope
[1:13:22] will indeed continue to rescue us
[1:13:25] why would he need continual rescue
[1:13:28] because he's in continual Danger
[1:13:31] you also helping together by prayer for
[1:13:34] us for that the gift bestowed upon us by
[1:13:37] the means of many persons thanks may be
[1:13:40] given by many on our behalf
[1:13:43] the other version says You must add your
[1:13:45] help by praying for us for the more
[1:13:48] people there are praying the more people
[1:13:51] there will be to give thanks when their
[1:13:53] prayer for us is answered
[1:13:56] this last part reminds me of brother
[1:13:58] branham's instructions on the prayer
[1:14:00] Clause that we read last time praise day
[1:14:03] three times a day resulting in a
[1:14:05] worldwide band of prayer for the needs
[1:14:07] of each one
[1:14:09] here's yet another indication of the
[1:14:12] troubles Paul had an Ephesus this time
[1:14:14] it's found in the closing remarks of his
[1:14:17] letter to the Romans believed to have
[1:14:19] been written in Corinth after he left
[1:14:21] Ephesus during the time of Acts chapter
[1:14:23] 20.
[1:14:25] Romans 16 it it
[1:14:27] reads so you know you read and think
[1:14:30] yeah that's nice right greet Priscilla
[1:14:33] to Killa my helpers in Christ Jesus
[1:14:36] who have for my life
[1:14:38] laid down their own necks
[1:14:41] unto whom not only I give thanks but
[1:14:43] also all the churches of the Gentiles
[1:14:46] what's he saying
[1:14:48] we see that by the time Paul wrote this
[1:14:49] letter to the Romans the kill and
[1:14:51] Priscilla were no longer in Ephesus
[1:14:53] they'd either already returned to Rome
[1:14:55] from Ephesus or were accompanying Phoebe
[1:14:58] as she carried the letter to Rome
[1:15:00] Paul is telling the recipients of this
[1:15:02] epistle to the Romans that these two
[1:15:05] have risked their lives risked death by
[1:15:08] beheading
[1:15:10] on his behalf
[1:15:12] in conjunction with these other
[1:15:14] references it's pretty clear that Paul
[1:15:16] is referring to events in Ephesus During
[1:15:18] the period covered in Acts 19.
[1:15:23] knowledge of this ever present danger to
[1:15:26] Paul and the effect it had on him and
[1:15:27] observed by others will help us better
[1:15:30] understand Acts 19 verses 30 and 31.
[1:15:34] we'll get to those verses in just a few
[1:15:35] minutes I will keep you here all night I
[1:15:37] promise
[1:15:38] a final recall this time from Acts 19.
[1:15:42] verses 8 and 9.
[1:15:48] and he Paul went into the synagogue and
[1:15:50] Ephesus and spoke boldly for the space
[1:15:53] of three months
[1:15:55] disputing and persuading a method of
[1:15:58] teaching as we discussed last time the
[1:16:00] things concerning the kingdom of God
[1:16:05] but when divers would some of the
[1:16:07] participants in these discussions were
[1:16:10] hardened
[1:16:11] they couldn't defend their stance or
[1:16:13] defeat Paul's
[1:16:15] or unwilling to change
[1:16:18] and believe not what Paul was saying but
[1:16:22] spake evil of that way of Christianity
[1:16:25] before the multitude
[1:16:27] they verbally attacked Paul
[1:16:29] attacked his teaching speaking evil
[1:16:32] indicates this became personal
[1:16:34] it's no longer a method of teaching and
[1:16:36] learning they reviled
[1:16:39] discredited publicly maligned the way
[1:16:42] Christianity that Jesus was a messiah
[1:16:46] then he Paul departed from them
[1:16:49] he left their synagogue separated the
[1:16:51] disciples the students the Believers the
[1:16:53] followers of Christ that came with him
[1:16:55] from that synagogue disputing daily no
[1:16:58] longer in the synagogue but instead
[1:17:00] teaching using this method of dialogue
[1:17:02] and persuasion in the school of one
[1:17:03] taranis
[1:17:07] when we get to acts 21
[1:17:10] and verse 27 for those of you that look
[1:17:13] ahead sometimes you'll again meet some
[1:17:16] of these people from Ephesus
[1:17:18] who rejected the gospel
[1:17:20] these guys are relentless
[1:17:23] and their pursuit of Paul
[1:17:25] much as Saul of Tarsus
[1:17:28] was relentless at his pursuit of the
[1:17:31] earliest Christians
[1:17:33] when we see what transpires in Acts 21
[1:17:35] it will help us realize how real the
[1:17:37] danger was to Paul while he was in
[1:17:40] Ephesus you'll see what these guys
[1:17:42] accomplish yet he remained there just
[1:17:45] sparing of life itself
[1:17:47] for three long years
[1:17:52] stay tuned
[1:17:53] moving on now with Luke's narrative and
[1:17:56] Acts 19 moving on to verse 23.
[1:17:59] at the same time that he made his
[1:18:02] decision to go to Jerusalem in Rome
[1:18:05] and sent the two brothers on ahead to
[1:18:07] Macedonia
[1:18:08] there arose no small stir in Ephesus
[1:18:11] about that way that is the spread of
[1:18:14] Christianity
[1:18:16] for a certain man named Demetrius
[1:18:19] a silversmith
[1:18:21] which made silver shrines for Diana
[1:18:24] brought no small gain under the
[1:18:27] Craftsman
[1:18:28] Demetrius
[1:18:30] you're going to be on here in a minute
[1:18:31] buddy
[1:18:34] whom he called together with workmen of
[1:18:37] like occupation
[1:18:40] this Demetrius is apparently a very
[1:18:42] skilled silversmith
[1:18:44] he keeps a number of workers
[1:18:47] Craftsman employed the whole group of
[1:18:50] people working this Trader doing well
[1:18:52] financially by this arrangement
[1:18:54] the product line consists of Idols
[1:18:56] shrines and so forth focused on worship
[1:18:58] of this Goddess Diana
[1:19:00] not unlike selling crucifixes to
[1:19:02] Catholics or icons to Orthodox
[1:19:05] Christians Demetrius has called together
[1:19:07] this group
[1:19:09] later centuries the equivalent of a
[1:19:11] guild or or a union
[1:19:13] and along with other Smiths and
[1:19:16] Craftsmen engaged in this business of
[1:19:18] their livelihood and said
[1:19:21] seriously he knows that's by this craft
[1:19:24] we ever love
[1:19:26] point one
[1:19:28] we make our living by fabricating items
[1:19:31] of worship for Diana
[1:19:35] this is a statue of Diana also known as
[1:19:38] Artemis goddess of the hunt and
[1:19:40] fertility it's about nine feet tall
[1:19:42] Demetrius and his fellow silversmiths
[1:19:44] were making smaller silver idols and
[1:19:46] such for tourists and pilgrims
[1:19:49] worshipers of Diana
[1:19:51] but wait there's more
[1:20:00] almost throughout all Asia this call
[1:20:06] had persuaded and turned away much
[1:20:15] would show that not only this our craft
[1:20:18] is in danger to be said to not but also
[1:20:22] that the Temple of the Great
[1:20:31] Warrior
[1:20:32] Asian
[1:20:34] Asia and the world worship Asia and the
[1:20:37] whole world worship Diana can you
[1:20:41] imagine
[1:20:42] and when they heard these sayings they
[1:20:45] were full of Wrath it's now an angry mob
[1:20:48] and they cried out saying
[1:20:59] hey
[1:21:01] I
[1:21:02] smells like a riot might be coming on
[1:21:04] here but that wow that's a very you made
[1:21:07] that that silver whoa that'll make a
[1:21:09] great breastplate would well I don't
[1:21:11] know what this is worth but with this
[1:21:12] Riot and stuff you think I can get a
[1:21:15] discount hey take two bucks for it
[1:21:18] thanks Demetrius
[1:21:22] [Applause]
[1:21:30] question
[1:21:32] why would they say Diana of the
[1:21:34] Ephesians why not Diana of Mount Olympus
[1:21:37] or just say greatest Diana
[1:21:41] what makes this goddess one that they
[1:21:43] seem so possessive of in Ephesus
[1:21:49] I've highlighted here the location of
[1:21:52] the Temple of Diana that Demetrius
[1:21:53] refers to
[1:21:56] let's take a closer look
[1:21:59] this is the second of the three features
[1:22:02] of Ephesus
[1:22:03] that I mentioned that are applicable to
[1:22:06] Acts 19. Ephesus was known throughout
[1:22:09] the ancient world not even so much for
[1:22:12] its library but primarily for its Temple
[1:22:15] of Artemis also called Diana
[1:22:17] in fact
[1:22:19] this
[1:22:21] if it's a temple
[1:22:22] Temple this building
[1:22:24] was one of the Seven Wonders
[1:22:27] of the ancient world when you hear of
[1:22:30] the Seven Wonders of the World Ephesus
[1:22:32] was a city this was a temple the other
[1:22:36] six were the Colossus of Rhodes the
[1:22:39] Hanging Gardens of Babylon a certain
[1:22:41] statue of zuza a tomb of some guy named
[1:22:44] masalos
[1:22:46] the great pyramid at Giza and the
[1:22:48] Lighthouse at Alexandria
[1:22:51] this Temple
[1:22:52] was a big deal
[1:22:55] by the way of those seven wonders of the
[1:22:58] ancient world it's only the Great
[1:22:59] Pyramid of Giza that still stands today
[1:23:02] I had to sneak in a personal photo from
[1:23:04] our 50th wedding anniversary trip to
[1:23:06] Egypt it was at the height of covert
[1:23:09] restrictions so there were very few
[1:23:10] other tourists but back to the Temple of
[1:23:12] Diana
[1:23:14] quoting from National Geographic
[1:23:17] and Ephesus
[1:23:19] the ancient city in what is now Western
[1:23:21] turkey a temple was constructed that was
[1:23:24] reportedly so magnificent it caused
[1:23:26] Philo of Byzantium
[1:23:28] all right she's not my neighbor I don't
[1:23:30] know him either but whoever he was he
[1:23:32] said I've seen the walls and hanging
[1:23:34] gardens of ancient Babylon been there
[1:23:37] the statue of Olympian Zeus
[1:23:40] the Colossus of Rhodes the mighty work
[1:23:43] of the high pyramids the tomb of masalus
[1:23:46] but when I saw the temple at Ephesus
[1:23:48] rising to the clouds
[1:23:51] all these other wonders were put in the
[1:23:53] shade
[1:23:56] of course it would attract pilgrims to
[1:23:59] see its magnificence and then purchase
[1:24:01] the Diana souvenir or Idol to worship or
[1:24:04] something but if you go to Ephesus now
[1:24:07] unlike those Pyramids of Giza here's
[1:24:10] what you'll see of this Great temple
[1:24:12] this wonder of the ancient world
[1:24:15] one partially restored column
[1:24:19] that's it
[1:24:20] just one
[1:24:22] a few Foundation Stones here and there I
[1:24:24] think the inset at the bottom of the
[1:24:26] picture is a is a model of the temple on
[1:24:28] the grounds of a museum in Istanbul
[1:24:30] Istanbul Turkey just to give you an idea
[1:24:32] of the contrast here
[1:24:35] can you begin to see the scale
[1:24:38] of the success
[1:24:40] of the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:42] through Paul
[1:24:43] in Ephesus
[1:24:45] let's get back to that angry mob
[1:24:48] inspired by Demetrius
[1:24:53] the whole city
[1:24:55] was filled with confusion why are these
[1:24:57] guys stirred up what's going on I don't
[1:25:00] know let's go find out
[1:25:01] and having caught Gaius and aristarchus
[1:25:05] men of Macedonia Outsiders not Ephesians
[1:25:09] not worshipers of Diana but rather they
[1:25:12] are Paul's Companions and travel
[1:25:14] they the mob rushed with one Accord into
[1:25:18] the theater
[1:25:20] the amphitheater a place of public
[1:25:22] assembly and when Paul would have
[1:25:25] entered in to the amphitheater to help
[1:25:27] his companions
[1:25:29] Gaius and aristarchus he would have
[1:25:31] entered in unto the people the disciples
[1:25:33] the Believers his followers suffered him
[1:25:36] not they prevented him from getting in I
[1:25:39] don't know if they talked him out of it
[1:25:40] they hugged him out of it I don't know
[1:25:43] but they kept him out of it
[1:25:45] and certain of the chief of Asia some of
[1:25:48] the bigwigs in Ephesus
[1:25:50] powerful leaders are influential men
[1:25:52] maybe they were converts and maybe they
[1:25:54] weren't but regardless says they were
[1:25:56] his friends
[1:25:57] senator Paul Desiring him that he would
[1:26:00] not Adventure himself into the theater
[1:26:04] these Chief men along with the various
[1:26:06] disciples convinced Paul or restrained
[1:26:09] him from entering the amphitheater
[1:26:12] was dangerous recall the dangers and
[1:26:15] troubles Paul faced in Ephesus that he
[1:26:17] shared with the Corinthians in both of
[1:26:18] his letters which we read earlier
[1:26:21] meanwhile
[1:26:22] in the amphitheater some therefore cried
[1:26:25] one thing and some another for the
[1:26:27] assembly was confused
[1:26:29] the more apart knew not wherefore they
[1:26:31] were come together well I just saw those
[1:26:33] guys running and I'm running into
[1:26:35] I was driving down the freeway and
[1:26:37] everybody slowed down and I looked too
[1:26:40] most of the people were gawkers
[1:26:42] I saw a crowd Gathering went along to
[1:26:44] see what's going on what's causing this
[1:26:45] big disturbance a flash mob without
[1:26:48] social media
[1:26:51] it's time to take a look at the third
[1:26:53] feature of Ephesus that plays a role in
[1:26:57] Acts 19.
[1:26:59] the amphitheater
[1:27:01] this shows its relative location
[1:27:05] but this is the amphitheater it's a huge
[1:27:08] place of public gathering remember they
[1:27:10] had no PA systems no microphones
[1:27:12] loudspeakers the structure was designed
[1:27:15] so that if a person stood in the right
[1:27:17] place
[1:27:18] and the crowd was still that person
[1:27:20] could be heard by everyone
[1:27:24] everyone it looks pretty big right
[1:27:27] that's not just big it's gigantic
[1:27:30] by the standards of the day even by the
[1:27:33] San Jose it could seat 24
[1:27:36] 000 people
[1:27:39] that's like half the population of
[1:27:41] Ephesus
[1:27:43] if you've ever been in a stadium for a
[1:27:45] football or a baseball game or even
[1:27:47] indoors or basketball you know how hard
[1:27:49] it is
[1:27:51] to hear the announcer and that's with
[1:27:53] modern electronic systems
[1:27:55] and the Capitol building in Washington
[1:27:57] DC have you ever been in the Rotunda if
[1:28:00] a person stands in a certain spot and
[1:28:02] you stand another certain spot and that
[1:28:04] person Whispers
[1:28:06] that person Whispers
[1:28:08] you can hear that person they can't keep
[1:28:10] a secret
[1:28:13] the amphitheater of Ephesus was a Marvel
[1:28:16] of acoustic engineering Applied
[1:28:19] Mathematics and physics Stone
[1:28:21] construction and excavation
[1:28:24] it had to be deceit 24
[1:28:28] 000 people and everyone be able to hear
[1:28:32] the speaker
[1:28:34] and the majority of its construction is
[1:28:36] marble
[1:28:38] marble rich
[1:28:41] elegant
[1:28:42] even in in this small Auditorium of
[1:28:45] juice on Tabernacle with our excellent
[1:28:47] sound system I often speak too soft
[1:28:50] speak too Softly
[1:28:51] I need to be reminded to speak up
[1:28:55] with that said
[1:28:57] let's go back to Acts 19.
[1:28:59] let's enter that Ephesian Amphitheater
[1:29:02] let's listen let's see what's going on
[1:29:06] and they drew Alexander out of the
[1:29:09] multitude the Jews putting him forward
[1:29:11] so there's this big crowd and the Jewish
[1:29:13] people there say Alexander
[1:29:16] why Alexander
[1:29:19] a Jewish man was he a follower of Jesus
[1:29:21] Paul mentions a couple of Alexanders but
[1:29:24] they don't appear to be him
[1:29:27] it's probably not a Christian but at
[1:29:28] this time
[1:29:30] Christianity was considered to be a
[1:29:33] branch of Judaism
[1:29:35] Christians went to the synagogic Jews
[1:29:37] went to the synagogue they're Jews
[1:29:39] the crowd has riled up about anyone who
[1:29:42] is opposed to Diana the silversmiths
[1:29:45] right
[1:29:47] so
[1:29:49] Alexander beckoned with a hand
[1:29:52] silence so he could be heard he would
[1:29:55] have made his defense unto the people
[1:29:56] but when the flash mob knew that he was
[1:30:00] a Jew all with one voice about the space
[1:30:03] of two hours crying out great is Diana
[1:30:06] of the Ephesians
[1:30:08] great is Diana of the Ephesians
[1:30:11] that repeated it like a chant
[1:30:15] when the town clerk at the translation
[1:30:18] say mayor a figure with some Authority
[1:30:21] had appease he quieted the people it's
[1:30:24] apparently took two hours
[1:30:26] he said
[1:30:28] you men of Ephesus
[1:30:30] what man is there that knoweth not how
[1:30:32] that the city of the Ephesians is a
[1:30:35] worshiper of the Great Goddess Diana and
[1:30:38] of the image which fell down from
[1:30:39] Jupiter I'm on your side just keep
[1:30:42] listening
[1:30:44] seeing that these things cannot be
[1:30:46] spoken against you ought to be quiet do
[1:30:49] nothing rashly it's ridiculous to think
[1:30:52] otherwise think this through
[1:30:54] you've brought hither these men which
[1:30:57] are neither robbers of our temples or
[1:30:59] blasphemers of your goddess
[1:31:02] so if Demetrius and the Craftsman that
[1:31:06] are with him this guy in front row right
[1:31:08] over here if Demetrius or the Craftsman
[1:31:11] that are with him
[1:31:12] he's letting them know that he knows who
[1:31:15] the instigators of this are
[1:31:18] have a matter against any man the law is
[1:31:21] open the courts are available we have
[1:31:24] deputies judges let them bring charges
[1:31:27] against one another and plead means to
[1:31:29] bring charges
[1:31:31] but if you inquire anything concerning
[1:31:33] other matters it shall be determined in
[1:31:36] a lawful assembly and the courts not
[1:31:39] here
[1:31:40] for
[1:31:41] we are in danger to be called in
[1:31:44] question for this day's uproar there
[1:31:47] being no cause whereby we may give an
[1:31:49] account of this Concourse this
[1:31:51] disturbance this disorderly Gathering
[1:31:54] Rome was always fearful and always
[1:31:57] trying to appease
[1:31:59] the mob
[1:32:00] a riot like this could result in the
[1:32:03] downfall of many civil officials
[1:32:05] suppression of certain rights and so
[1:32:07] forth remember Pilots fear of
[1:32:10] repercussions of a mob right in
[1:32:11] Jerusalem
[1:32:13] was the final pressure that caused him
[1:32:15] to order the crucifixion of Jesus to
[1:32:18] satisfy the mob
[1:32:20] and when he the town clerk had thus
[1:32:23] spoken
[1:32:24] he dismissed the assembly
[1:32:30] when Paul was traveling
[1:32:32] he spent considerable time in certain
[1:32:34] locations 18 months in Corinth on his
[1:32:37] second Journey
[1:32:39] a few years in Ephesus on his third
[1:32:41] during these days he wrote some of the
[1:32:44] Epistles that are now part of our new
[1:32:46] testament
[1:32:50] I've already mentioned the two letters
[1:32:52] to the Corinthians he wrote from Ephesus
[1:32:54] as well as a letter to the Romans is
[1:32:57] believed to have been written from
[1:32:58] Corinth towards the end of this journey
[1:33:01] while there's some controversy over what
[1:33:02] he did or did not write or uncertainty
[1:33:04] about when this journey occurred or what
[1:33:06] year that was and so forth there's
[1:33:08] General agreement on many of his letters
[1:33:11] for example the two letters to the
[1:33:13] Thessalonians were written during his
[1:33:15] long stay in Corinth and acts 18 during
[1:33:18] the second Journey
[1:33:19] Galatians is believed to have been
[1:33:21] written during that second Journey as
[1:33:22] well
[1:33:24] as brother Daniel mentioned II Timothy
[1:33:26] the very last letter we know of that
[1:33:27] Paul wrote was just prior to his
[1:33:29] execution in Rome
[1:33:32] well since Paul is still in Ephesus at
[1:33:34] the end of tonight's chapter let's
[1:33:37] consider for a moment another passage in
[1:33:39] First Corinthians
[1:33:42] recall from acts 18 which you read
[1:33:45] earlier this evening that Paul had
[1:33:47] Assurance from the Lord that no evil
[1:33:48] would be fallen in Corinth and he stayed
[1:33:51] at least a year and a half
[1:33:53] in the past
[1:33:54] before this acts study I didn't give a
[1:33:57] lot of thought as to when Paul might
[1:33:59] have written the Epistles to the
[1:34:01] Corinthians or the context of his and
[1:34:04] their situation
[1:34:06] but context
[1:34:08] is so important
[1:34:11] now I know that the Corinthian letters
[1:34:13] were written while Paul was in Ephesus
[1:34:14] during Acts 19.
[1:34:17] we just read about the difficulties he
[1:34:19] was having at Ephesus that he shared
[1:34:21] with the Corinthians
[1:34:24] let's listen as Paul recounts some of
[1:34:27] the trials and sufferings he has
[1:34:28] sustained up to that point in time in
[1:34:31] order to bring the good news to the
[1:34:33] Corinthians and others
[1:34:36] Paul's reacting to news from corn things
[1:34:38] he's spending a considerable part of
[1:34:40] this letter defending his ministry
[1:34:42] and it's part of a warning against false
[1:34:45] teaching and false apostles
[1:34:48] but he relates some startling facts some
[1:34:51] things that have occurred during this
[1:34:53] time that we've been up to this point
[1:34:55] and asked
[1:34:57] he says in second Corinthians chapter 11
[1:35:00] and verse 24. of the Jews five times
[1:35:05] received by 40 Stripes save one
[1:35:09] 39 lashes with whips
[1:35:12] five times
[1:35:16] why was it limited to that number
[1:35:18] Deuteronomy 25 1-3 Moses says never more
[1:35:22] than 40. Luke tells us nothing of this
[1:35:24] in Acts
[1:35:26] false back must have been a sight
[1:35:29] with so many scars
[1:35:32] he says three times Thrice
[1:35:35] was I beaten with rods
[1:35:38] we read of one time in Philippi
[1:35:41] but now we learned there were two other
[1:35:43] times that weren't recorded in Acts
[1:35:46] once I was stoned
[1:35:48] that was in lystra during the first
[1:35:50] journey and we know that he was killed
[1:35:52] then
[1:35:53] Thrice three times I suffered shipwreck
[1:35:57] a night and a day I've been in the Deep
[1:36:00] drifting hanging on to something to
[1:36:03] float we know nothing of these incidents
[1:36:05] except they must have occurred
[1:36:08] during the times that we've covered so
[1:36:09] far in Acts
[1:36:12] do you recall I pointed out on that map
[1:36:15] the many tiny islands and rocks that are
[1:36:17] in that part of the Aegean Sea
[1:36:20] so
[1:36:21] this had to have been when he was
[1:36:23] crossing through there I used to think
[1:36:25] when I read this that oh the shipwrecks
[1:36:27] and that bad stuff that happened on his
[1:36:30] journey to Rome we read all about the
[1:36:31] big shipwreck there
[1:36:33] this is before he ever got to Rome
[1:36:37] so that would come years later
[1:36:40] he goes along
[1:36:42] and journeyings often and perils dangers
[1:36:46] of waters
[1:36:47] in Perils of robbers
[1:36:50] and perils by my own countrymen
[1:36:53] five times 39 stripes in perils by the
[1:36:58] heathen stoned lystra and perils in this
[1:37:01] city
[1:37:02] and perils in the wilderness perils in
[1:37:05] the sea
[1:37:07] in perils among false brethren
[1:37:12] this was hard
[1:37:14] this was long
[1:37:15] this was difficult not flying commercial
[1:37:18] staying in nice hotel speaking to
[1:37:21] receptive people and comfortable
[1:37:22] churches
[1:37:24] in weariness
[1:37:26] sheer physical exhaustion
[1:37:29] painfulness
[1:37:32] in watchings that's sleepless nights
[1:37:35] often in hunger and thirst and fastings
[1:37:39] involuntarily without food
[1:37:41] often shivering and cold and nakedness
[1:37:45] exposure inadequate clothing
[1:37:49] Paul was continually In Harm's Way
[1:37:53] he must have often thought about what
[1:37:55] the Lord showed him in Damascus at the
[1:37:58] time of his own conversion which brother
[1:37:59] Daniel shared with us in Acts 9.
[1:38:02] verse 13.
[1:38:05] the Lord has told ananias to go to the
[1:38:08] street called straight and you'll find
[1:38:09] this guy Paul and pray for him because
[1:38:11] he's had this vision and his sight to be
[1:38:13] restored ananias answered Lord
[1:38:16] I have heard by many of this man how
[1:38:19] much evil he has done to thy Saints at
[1:38:22] Jerusalem and here he has Authority from
[1:38:26] the chief priests to bind all that call
[1:38:28] on your name
[1:38:29] in other words Lord I'd rather not go
[1:38:33] pray for this guy
[1:38:36] but the Lord said unto ananias go thy
[1:38:40] way
[1:38:41] go to Saul do what I've told you to do
[1:38:43] he's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my
[1:38:46] name before the Gentiles and kings
[1:38:50] and the children of Israel
[1:38:53] for I will show him how great things he
[1:38:56] must suffer how much he will suffer for
[1:38:59] my name's sake
[1:39:02] Paul endured many hard physical
[1:39:05] sufferings and torments
[1:39:08] we were talking about this one evening
[1:39:10] and Heather suggested me it was no
[1:39:12] wonder he had Luke with him so often
[1:39:14] maybe not only is a fellow evangelist
[1:39:16] but also is a trusted personal physician
[1:39:20] to help attend to the physical care of
[1:39:22] his damaged broken hurting body
[1:39:26] remember we read where he
[1:39:29] asked the Lord three different times to
[1:39:31] take away this one particular thing and
[1:39:33] the Lord said Paul
[1:39:34] I'm not going to do it
[1:39:42] I'm aware of it and I care my grace is
[1:39:45] sufficient
[1:39:47] but something weighed
[1:39:49] even more heavily on Paul
[1:39:52] than all of these
[1:39:54] back to Second Corinthians 11 verse 28.
[1:39:58] beside all those things that are without
[1:40:01] those things I just listed beatings and
[1:40:04] hunger and shipwreck
[1:40:05] physical danger my greatest burden is
[1:40:09] that which cometh upon me daily
[1:40:12] the care of all the churches right when
[1:40:15] I read that I my mind flashed back to
[1:40:17] when I was 13 years old and the the day
[1:40:21] that President Kennedy was shot
[1:40:24] and the plane flew back to Andrews Air
[1:40:27] Force Base and Lyndon Johnson came out
[1:40:30] of the plane and he stood by the
[1:40:32] microphones there and he said
[1:40:35] his his last phrase of a very short
[1:40:38] speech
[1:40:40] I will do my best
[1:40:42] that's all I can do
[1:40:44] I ask for your help and gods
[1:40:49] my brothers and my sisters
[1:40:52] please remember
[1:40:54] thinking of this verse
[1:40:56] to pray for our Pastor Daniel
[1:40:58] every single day the burden of caring
[1:41:03] for this Fellowship weighs heavily on
[1:41:06] him
[1:41:06] we should help bear one another's
[1:41:09] burdens
[1:41:10] this is how we fulfill the law of Christ
[1:41:12] to love one another and not just with
[1:41:15] words
[1:41:17] as we progress through the rest of Acts
[1:41:19] consider the circumstances the context
[1:41:22] of Paul's life and experiences and the
[1:41:26] context of the lives of the people he
[1:41:27] ministered to
[1:41:29] and of the cities where the Believers
[1:41:31] lived who receive his letters when you
[1:41:33] read his Epistles ask yourself
[1:41:35] why is Paul addressing this topic with
[1:41:38] this group
[1:41:39] at this time
[1:41:41] nothing is random here
[1:41:44] it's all in God's control
[1:41:46] and in his hands
[1:41:49] as are we
[1:41:51] if we'll accept his love and grace
[1:41:54] through Jesus Christ if you have not
[1:41:57] done so anyone here I urge you do not
[1:42:00] leave tonight
[1:42:02] until you know that you've met him
[1:42:06] and he has met you establish that
[1:42:09] connection a relationship so that on
[1:42:13] that final day
[1:42:14] he won't turn to you and say
[1:42:17] depart from me
[1:42:19] because I never knew you
[1:42:22] oops I'd like to close this evening
[1:42:26] with the song I learned back in 1965
[1:42:29] when I was 15 years old if the musicians
[1:42:32] would please return
[1:42:35] no it's not all night yet okay my family
[1:42:38] lived in San Jose California at that
[1:42:41] time
[1:42:42] we attended Saint Timothy's Lutheran
[1:42:44] Church
[1:42:45] pastored by brother lynhart this is
[1:42:48] before we'd ever heard of the ministry
[1:42:49] of brother Branham
[1:42:51] brother lynhart later became an
[1:42:52] associate pastor here at Tucson
[1:42:54] Tabernacle he serves as a congregation
[1:42:56] for about 35 years
[1:42:58] anyway
[1:43:00] I was elected president of the Luther
[1:43:01] League the church's young people's group
[1:43:05] brother Lenhart suggested to me that the
[1:43:07] young people of the church should attend
[1:43:09] a singspiration
[1:43:11] one evening I don't recall how many of
[1:43:13] us went I did I remember two of my best
[1:43:16] friends were there at the time
[1:43:18] the event was free of admission charge
[1:43:21] it was in a large local church
[1:43:24] the person leading it
[1:43:26] was none other
[1:43:28] than Audrey Meyer
[1:43:30] she was a gifted Christian musician who
[1:43:33] was inspired to write many gospel songs
[1:43:36] she grew up in La I think 1916 to 1996
[1:43:41] that Forest Lawn Cemetery where Amy
[1:43:43] sepel McPherson is buried she's buried
[1:43:46] there as well she was part of Amy sample
[1:43:48] McPherson's Church experience there in
[1:43:51] the 20s and 30s but she wrote most if
[1:43:54] not all the songs that we sang that
[1:43:57] evening
[1:43:57] and I'd like us to sing one of the songs

[1:46:55] amen let's stand
[1:46:58] I want to ask you a question
[1:47:00] but the Lyle touched on it
[1:47:04] think about those great wonders those
[1:47:07] great man-built Wonders that we see we
[1:47:11] see the one pillar standing which one
[1:47:13] was that
[1:47:14] the Temple of Diane and Corinth right
[1:47:18] in Ephesus the the Temple of Diana
[1:47:21] one of the greatest wonders look what
[1:47:23] stands today nothing
[1:47:25] one pillar you wouldn't know what was
[1:47:27] there
[1:47:28] you know there's a few there's a few
[1:47:30] pyramids left all of these other things
[1:47:32] have been destroyed but let me tell you
[1:47:34] something every single one of those
[1:47:37] people that were led to the Lord Jesus
[1:47:40] Christ are alive today 2 000 years later
[1:47:45] because a man took it upon himself to
[1:47:49] follow the leading of the Lord and lead
[1:47:53] these people to everlasting life to the
[1:47:56] Son of God Jesus Christ to the point
[1:47:58] where they would they would burn these
[1:48:01] books these most the most valuable
[1:48:03] things in the world they'd throw them
[1:48:05] down and burn them they mean nothing
[1:48:08] to me
[1:48:09] I think that just blessed me I thought
[1:48:12] Lord nothing is left
[1:48:15] nothing that man can build is eternal
[1:48:17] but what God builds is eternal but allow
[1:48:22] mentioned but allow mentioned a youth
[1:48:24] meeting we're having a youth meeting on
[1:48:26] August the 26th I mentioned it before
[1:48:30] and let me tell you
[1:48:31] the Lord is going to move
[1:48:34] and he's going to do something powerful
[1:48:37] in those meetings I guarantee it
[1:48:42] so you kids I want you to be there I
[1:48:45] want you to come prepared and I believe
[1:48:48] that the Lord will I believe he's going
[1:48:50] to do something very very special in
[1:48:53] those youth meetings coming up
[1:48:56] the loud bless me read that second
[1:48:58] Corinthians
[1:48:59] how Paul the greatest burden that he had
[1:49:02] was for those people these people in
[1:49:04] those churches he loved them he loved
[1:49:08] him so much that
[1:49:09] [Music]
[1:49:10] that he would risk his life and and he
[1:49:13] would be beaten
[1:49:15] stoned and everything else
[1:49:18] but those people meant something to the
[1:49:20] Apostle Brother David if you would if
[1:49:22] you'd come up and close my brother
[1:49:25] let's sing that song again brother Aaron
[1:49:28] his name is wonderful

[1:50:52] brother said tonight
[1:50:54] and all the wisdom that he brought and
[1:50:56] all the history that he showed us
[1:50:58] was don't leave tonight until you know
[1:51:01] that you have met Jesus face to face and
[1:51:05] that's what was important to Paul and
[1:51:07] that's how they could burn those books
[1:51:09] that's how they could forsake all of
[1:51:11] these idols and that is why brother
[1:51:14] Jonathan that they are alive today
[1:51:18] in glory waiting for us
