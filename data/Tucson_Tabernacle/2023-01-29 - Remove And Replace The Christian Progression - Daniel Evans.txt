sometimes a path seems rough and see see his Footprints all the way Jesus Jesus Jesus sweetest name I know fills my every longing keeps me saying as I go and soon he's coming back to welcome far beyond the Starry Sky I shall Wing my flight to Worlds unknown I shall reign with him on Highland stampley's us Jesus sweetest name I know fills my every long keeps me singing As I go amen amen he is our source our hope our reason for living today amen brother Russ all the field make your way up we have one request asking from sister Shirley Moore asking to keep our sister Mercy somewhere on prayer she's still not doing very well I know my wife has spoke to her several times she's had not had much appetite not wanting to eat she was suffering with covid but our God is more than able so he's the same yesterday today and forever in fact David says in Psalms 91 we'll read those verses one through seven [Music] Psalms 91 is just it's an encouragement because it was it's it's still the same it still has the same effect it still has the same power he the dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings Thou shalt trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth that Noonday A thousand shall fall at Thai side and ten thousand at that right hand but it shall not come nigh thee amen it shall not come nigh thee what a protection we have so if you have a need you'd raise your hand and say Lord remember me as a as our brother Russell would pray and then I believe he's he's going to sing a song special for us thank you brother amen let's breathe in Lord how thankful we are for scripture we just heard here Lord what promises we have as your children Lord we're so thankful to belong to you and to be sheep of your pasture Lord and

that if brother Aaron sees me and he spotted me when I came in and I really didn't have don't have a song special for you but I have a song that I actually was singing this morning and I hope it's not

none he saith I will return unto my house once I came and when he cometh he findeth that swept and garnished then gothy and taketh to him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first and came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bear thee and the paps which thou has sucked and he said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it amen thank you sister Katie God bless you all you can take your seats it's good to see you all again I feel like we haven't seen each other in a long time we had a we had a church meeting last night and uh I was so blessed friends I felt so good after our meeting last night and talking about these things and talking about some of the direction that the church is going we're never going to agree on everything in fact we'll probably never agree on any one thing except that we are all to serve this body in the best way that we can and I was just I was very encouraged last night got some really pertinent comments um I thought the spirit was good and um I just I wanted to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart I think we got a good thing going and I think that we are going to continue on and I have never been so excited as I am especially after last night let's let's keep her moving greetings to the visitors brother Cedric it's good to see you again my friend God bless you and all the other visitors I see a couple faces that don't readily recognize but welcome and brother Russell you and your family good to see you enjoyed the song before um I'll be in Mexico next week I have to go down for work I'll be there Monday through Friday so if people are if you're trying to text me I'll still get my text but I won't get them until the evening I'll check my emails during the week also um again I thought the meeting last night was really positive I wasn't trying to get the commitment on anything I was just trying to feel the congregation's spirit and I get a general direction on how the congregation was feeling and I was watching everybody as we were talking about things the things that I want to move forward immediately on are I want to get started on the upstairs room for the Youth sister Elizabeth Guerra I wanted to make sure she is getting all of the information for everyone with the birthdays and uh special how we contact you contact you phone numbers emails your birthdays and any other special dates that you might have so please get with sister Elizabeth and getting that information in um and uh then brother Jeremy and sister Angela moving forward on we're going to go ahead and book the the Family Camp for September I'm really excited thank you all for the all the work that you're doing on that I think it's going to be a real blessing to all of us to be able to get together for that camp so those are the immediate things in the next month or so we have communion on March 5th and um then you keep praying about it but that's probably that morning communion obviously is a supper so that's an evening service that morning is probably if we continue if I continue to pray that way I continue to feel led to move in that direction we'll probably take our first church offering uh on that morning I will be as I promised last night I'll be meeting with in the next couple weeks I'll be meeting with the officers in the church to talk about some of the finances like we discussed last night and uh I will uh Brother Andy had a good idea that I put together a document on some of the things what the word says about the the finances in the church and um do some research on it and put together that document so I'll I'll be working on that uh before one of the things that's very important and that we haven't discussed and that are is the church bylaws and we've uh but the Lyle has been helping me with that he's given me some ideas on that and I've taken but the why I was written I've written some stuff and then the Branham Tabernacle bylaws also so one we don't have to vote on everything but the things that we do have to vote on I really believe we have to vote on Church bylaws I think that needs to be a congregational decision so I'll put together a document I will get that out to the people that's going to be a couple months from now and not not right away and um that's uh so that's the direction we're moving I'm excited as as you can tell I was I was very encouraged after last night um we had a great service on Wednesday night uh Cedric was here with us um first is that's the first time you've come to this church right it was to me I was just blessed I was blessed beyond measure we just had a few people in here I think I counted 32 people that we had in church but it was uh there was a spirit I felt that was with us what we did is it turned into it kind of the Lord I believe led to making it a little bit of a testimony service where we heard um I gave a couple testimonies which I'll be talking about a little bit this morning I'll be rehearsing those and uh and then we played the sermon where brother Branham gave his testimony about how he got his commission to go out and pray for the sick and then at the end um we we had a special another special testimony from Brother Arnie back there let me read you a quote it says here brother Branham said this in that sermon that we listened to brother Brown said do you all believe you all believe with all of your heart both of you he was looking at somebody out in the audience he's he said you accept it sir I tell you you too I see with your hand up the habit of smoking he said remember he never met any of these people he said quit doing that you smoke cigars you shouldn't do that makes you sick isn't that right if it is wave your hand like this that's what's upsetting you it's bad on your nerves throw nasty thing away and the TR and don't do it no more and you'll get over that and be all right and you're and your wife's heart trouble will leave her how do you know about that you believe that isn't that right I can't see you from here you know that but you're carrying cigars in your pocket in the front brother Amos where did Amos go um bro they must come up here for a second um I'm going to finish this quote in a sec go give that to brother uh Arnie in the back so he says this he says you believe that isn't that right I can't see you from here and you know that but you're carrying cigars in your pocket in the front that's right lay the things out and put your hand over on your wife tell God that you are through with that kind of stuff you'll go home well you and your wife will get well blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus so we heard that at the prayer line at the end of that service or the the discernment service and then brother Arnie raised his hand and he had something to say brother Arnie's dad was in this service and he grew up hearing that story brother Arnie if you could give that testimony yeah we buried my dad last Saturday not yesterday but so he can't verify this I'm sorry wish my sisters were here but my dad told us this story since I can remember about this man with the cigars in his vest because he was sitting close to him and saw the expression on his face when brother Bradham was talking to him and the surprise look you know you I I've heard a lot of negative about brother Benham I've never gone on those websites to see the negative but um I was really happy to see brother Cedric Cedric if I said it Elizabeth you could tell me your dog's name Cedric or Cedric but anyway he brought another person here and I said if I find this paper in my Bible I'm going to say this if you have one penny and you get one penny today and then tomorrow you get two pennies and the next day you get four pennies we're talking about money now if you're interested in money and then the next day you get eight pennies you know at the end of the month if you have a 32 month how many pennies you get I could have did the arithmetic wrong it's been a long time since I took arithmetic but I got two billion pennies in 31 days God's going to do a quick work he brought another penny with him Amen brother Cedric and so I just want him to be he was excited I played uh brother Brown talking to my mom and I could see the expression on his face he was excited to hear a prophet revealing the secrets of the heart because brother uh Paul talks about that that um and brother Branham quotes it in the two movies the the colored one in Chicago the bow tie remember and then the deep cause deep in Washington DC the black and white one he quotes the scripture where they'll an unbeliever comes among you they'll they'll say surely God's within you God's in your midst right so I I want to stop and just say that that was a true testimony from my dad because we and I we didn't actually listen to tapes till about the middle 70s and when that was in the middle 50s 55 and we didn't start listening to if I remember right about the middle and then we got to hear Brother by Adam for the first time talking to my mom talking to my friend Ozzy talking to this man that had the cigars in his vest coat pocket sorry I hope I didn't take too much time no I appreciate appreciate that it's and the Bible says and they could say nothing because the man was standing among them so we see that testimony I want to talk about this brother here brother Cedric is a minister of the gospel and his dad is a pastor am I right brother raise your hand God bless you he's a servant of the Lord and it's really nice to have him brother Arnie if you could give that to brother Amos oh do you have something Okay so we heard about that and then hang on to it Amos for a minute and then I gave the testimony of a man named Marvin that I had met in Jeffersonville that he used to um walk to school here he is he used to walk to school way back when in the 1940s brother Branham would be dressed up in his um in his game and fish outfit driving his car and he would pick up this young man who was segregated back then he went to a segregate he went to an all-black school brother Brandon would pick him up and bring him to school and didn't make him feel like such a big guy you know and he said you know and the one thing that is important that everything's important about these testimonies but one thing that struck me he says you know I didn't even know he was a preacher he said he was so nice to me he wasn't like any other preacher I ever met he wasn't always trying to tell me how to live my life and everything he said the only thing that he told me he said stay in school he said get an education because you won't regret it in the future that's what Marvin told me so he was he was talking about brother Branham and he said he said I didn't even know he said then he came up missing for a couple months and he said when he came back to our little town of Jeffersonville he said he was famous he said people were coming all from all over the world to come in and to get prayed for at the Tabernacle he said that little church at 8th and Penn Street he said they'd be lined up trying to get in there to get their healing and he said everybody throughout the country knew about that and he said I knew him right before it happened he said what happened and we heard that testimony on Wednesday night how the angel came to me in his commission that's what happened he got that commission and the Lord led him to go out he would he would have the the angel talked to him and he would he the angel told him you'll have these signs as Moses had and one of those signs sister Roberta I'm going to put you on the spot one of those signs was brother Amos if you could get the microphone was that his hand he would see some sort of a sickness in his hand and Moses had a similar sign right back there Amos right back there and then my sister talked about this she told me about this after service okay that's testimony um she was sick with a female trouble and they had done an operation and and they'd given her medications and it hadn't worked and she was still having you know would leave and then come again so they had been uh going to Jeffersonville they lived in Chicago and she went down to Jeffersonville and they were able to get an interview with brother Branham and um it was my mom and dad and then I believed Leo Mercer was there and brother Branham and then brother Gerald chance was there he's a brother out of the uh up in the Flagstaff Church and um so my mom tells it I'll do the best I can they were at Brother branham's house in a room she said it was off of the porch and they it was his little Den in his house and uh they all went in there and brother Branham sat in the chair and my mom and dad were on a little sofa and she said that brother Branham just sat there and he sort of talked to them and was uh uh expressing the importance of doing everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then after a little bit he came and sat on the um the coffee table knees to knees with my my parents and um and then he asked her you know what was the problem and she told them what the problem was and um and uh then he said so he talked with them and then he says let's all stand and get in a circle and brother Gerald chance was there because he he wanted brother Branham to pray that he would receive the Holy Spirit that's what he was that's what he wanted and um and so they all stood in a circle and my mom said that brother Branham uh he said have you ever seen the the sign that the lord gave me in my hand and they said no and so he he showed his hand I don't know which hand it was but in the you know the thumb and the this part he took my mom's hand and um and he it started making little bumps and getting read like it was that's what she said it was it was getting like there was something wrong with brother branham's hand and he told her this won't this that you have will not take your life and he said um if it was something bad he goes my hand gets worse and worse and it'll look like leprosy and then um so then he had asked my dad something and my dad had always had asthma and um so he took my dad's hand and it that did and anyway brother when they said my dad said I have trouble with asthma brother Branham goes oh that's just the devil and he took my dad's hand and it did not show in his hand wow Ministry and then uh and then my dad had asked further Branham because um my dad worked in an office in Chicago he was an accountant and he worked it and it was a big room and uh and people were very um worldly and talk bad and there was things and my dad was a a Christian person and and then they would say and do things and my dad just he asked for the random to please pray he would get a different job and um so I'll finish that part um but when brother Brown prayed he did not pray for my dad to have a new job he he said please make him content until you have something else for him and so then when my dad went back he um he said the Lord had done something for him because it didn't bother him he was able to do his work ignore and and and he was there until a long time I don't know how long it was but he never got an another job in Chicago of course we moved to they moved us to Arizona and um and another little thing with that was you know on the tape brother Branham says that in the offices the people would throw their keys in a basket and then you grab the keys and went home with whoever owned the keys my dad said that they did that in that office wow and um so anyway so back to my mom and the prayer so brother they get in a circle and brother Branham um prayed and she said it was a simple prayer but he told them that I want you to watch my hand you know his so he still has my mom's hand and and he goes I want you all to watch my hand and um and he prayed and the thing that Mom said stood out to her was brother Branham when he was done he said he said several but the ones she remembers was he said in the name of the home and uh and the Holy Roman Church and then he said in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and he said of she thinks he said more than that but she can't remember it but then he said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in his hand immediately went uh cleaned back to normal again whatever you do in order deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus amen so and then he did tell brother Gerald that he would receive the holy spirit that that week so and then my mom went over the men were talking so she went over to the door and then brother Branham came over by her and he says now Sister you can either take that medicine and he she said that he told her the two medications that they had given her and she said my dad didn't even know what they had given her and and he says now you can either take them or you cannot take them but you've been healed and then mom always says of course I didn't take them thank the Lord thank you for the Arnie and sister Roberta thank you very much I I also mentioned now remember friends as we're telling these testimonies we are glorifying our lord Jesus and we we read our Bibles and we see that these were commonplace from Moses putting his hand in his bosom and then pulling it out and pulling it out in his leprous and then putting it back in and then it was clean you know we see that in the Bible we see discernment in the in the Bible as I said with ananias and Sapphira how Peter showed that sign when he was when when they came before him and he told them what they had done about about keeping the money back so these things that we're talking about they're not new they are attributes of God and he doesn't change there was I told the story about a man named Robert E Lee an old man that I met and um he uh he knew I used to get the stories about brother Branham he knew brother Branham and he said the same thing he said you know he was just an ordinary guy he used to walk the high lines the power lines and he would stay with him and his family overnight because he was doing his who doing his run and he said like I said he said he was just an ordinary guy here he is in his in his shop that's where I talked to him and he uh he told the story to me about they were having a baptismal service and this young woman got out in a boat and she went out in the boat next to where they were baptizing all of these people and she started making fun of what was going on and she started heckling the um the the service there and she was warned to stop yet she kept on and then Mr Lee said he said I witnessed it he said I witnessed the woman lose her mind and be committed and he never saw her again be committed into this insane institution how careful we should be about condemning even if it doesn't line up with the way that we think condemning the things of God he told me he told me about his um niece and he was telling about his niece he said he said yeah she's he she had all these problems she said she was she was schizophini I said really he said yeah she still she struggled with schizophrenia and and she was she would just get so bad and I was like yeah bad and what she struggle with he says sis Vinnie did she take medicine no yeah she took medicine didn't do any good and I was like okay and and he said I said what's sisyphenic and he said you know she she'd lose her mind she had two like different personalities I said oh schizophrenia he said that's what I said schizophrenic I said I said okay I don't know we're on the same page now so he started telling this this testimony she got committed to a place anybody that's been um in Jeffersonville there was a big insane asylum which was north of Jeffersonville about an hour in a place called Madison they shipped her off to Madison because they couldn't do anything with her she was she had had lost her mind she would lose control and then come back and lose control with schizophrenia and the family asked brother Branham to go and pray for her brother Brandon made the trip to the hospital and he prayed for the young lady and she was delivered and Mr Lee told me he said she never struggled with it again which is that leads me to my sermon today which is we have to remove and replace so what happened was he had prayed for this woman this young lady she was delivered of the sickness and then she became a Christian she replaced that void that was in her when that Spirit came out of her she replaced it with serving the lord she replaced it with Christianity and you know let me let me read that scripture again quickly Luke 11 24-28 it says when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man it walketh through Dry places dry places that's places without water seeking rest and findeth none he saith I will return unto my house my house once I came out and when he cometh and findeth it swept and garnished then goeth thee and take it to him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there in the last state of that man is worse than the first so we we see this Parable that Jesus gave and this is in the Book of Luke The Book of Luke has the most Parables of any of the Gospels so Jesus is telling this story and these parables are they're meant to Spur our thinking and they're meant to teach us a lesson so we have this story of of the spirit and it's in this house and then it takes up residence maybe and then it's cast out it's evicted from the house so it knows it can't come in so this Spirit goes through the neighborhood and he's walking along and he goes up to other houses maybe he tries the door maybe he knocks on the window or maybe he he tries to raise the window and it's locked and he's he's going through and he's he's trying to find a place to live maybe this spirit is holding a grudge maybe the spirit is gossiping maybe it's a negative Spirit about always talking negative about someone and then it goes It goes and it's trying to find a place that it can rest remember Spirits want Fellowship just like we want they want somewhere to feel comfortable so this spirit's going along through the neighborhood and it's trying the door and it might it might come in and it might set the table get it ready it might set the situation and try to open the door for him to come in and take residence it might be like last night in our meeting I thought it went really well but there are obviously things that meant a lot to a lot of us and we see even then and always where we're at we see the spirit and it's right there and it's trying to come in and say oh this person lied oh where this person wants something that's off the word or or to come in and say oh well well this person um they just hate me they don't want anything to do with me and there's the spirit and he's trying to get in the window he's trying to open the door and then you just put him out no no they didn't want they didn't want that you can't help those thoughts from coming in your mind you can't help that the enemy he's knocking on the door he's trying to get in the house but you just put your hand up no I don't want it so then he goes to the next house and this one may be drinking and maybe smoking it may be something that these this someone was delivered of or that has a weakness there and he is trying to get in I know of a man That I Used to Know he gave his heart to the Lord started going to church serving God the best that he knew how to do he got the whole house all cleaned out but there was one thing that he just couldn't get rid of and it was an adulterous spirit so then we see that here's here's the spirit going in and then it finds a residence and if it's not cast out then it takes up takes up this home this residence so now this Spirit he's going through and he's he's walking around and he comes back to the original House that he had been to and he looks and wow this place is different he got the outside the hedges are all trimmed the grass looks nice the windows are all fixed this house looks brand new and he's the spirit's looking at the place this person had given his heart to the Lord he had he had changed his way of doing things and here comes the spirit and he pulls out the keys and he says it couldn't be sticks it in the keyhole and turns and it unlocked the door and he looks in is there anybody in this house this isn't like I remember it it's all renovated the walls are all painted he walks in and you know is there anybody here he goes in he goes down the hallway careful he's not going to get kicked out again goes through every room the bedroom and he goes to the living room and the bathrooms everything's all redone and it's all beautiful but there's no one living there and he says this is better than when I left sits down puts his feet up on the couch calls up his buddies and says come on over this house is is welcome now this man had given his heart to the Lord but that void that was created when he got rid of his sin wasn't replaced with anything so this man that I know of he didn't completely get rid of that Spirit ends up running around on his wife leaving his wife his wife left him getting another girlfriend he ended up started drinking another Spirit came in he started going to bars another Spirit came in he started showing up late for work another Spirit came in lost his job and turned out to have a complete failure in life because he had not replaced what he had cast out he didn't replace it with something else and I'm talking about when we replace something when we lose something we may come to the Altar and say Lord I'm not going to do this anymore but you can't just leave it there that void that's created in you and what Jesus is talking about here it's got to have another Spirit come in and replace that the Holy Spirit and other things I'm not just talking about spiritual things here I preached the sermon I don't know a month ago or so on the talents and how that these three men they were given one was given five talents which was like five million dollars one was given two talents one was given one Talent and each of the the the master left and when he came back the one with five talents I doubled it to ten talents the one with two had doubled it to four the one with one had just buried it and not done anything to multiply the Master's money so the point of the story was you've been given something but don't just leave it there don't bury it and what I said is it's not what you don't do for God I quit smoking I quit drinking I quit cussing I quit lying I quit watching TV I quit watching movies I quit driving I quit uh doing this and I quit doing that that's not serving God that is not doing something for God and those things will hinder your service of God but when you take something out it needs to be replaced with something else so if I'm not if if I'm if I'm not going to eat any sweets anymore you know I got to replace the Twinkies with carrots it's a bit drastic but I couldn't think of anything else but but you have to replace it with something else there's a void created in US and when we don't replace that it's like taking a shovel and shoveling water into a net which is just go and go you're not accomplishing anything nothing's going to happen you know when people I've counseled so many people they come to me and say well I just keep doing it you know I'll go and I'll give my heart to the Lord I'll rededicate my life and then I fall into the same sin of course you do you're a human being of course you fall into the same thing but what you have to do is you have to replace that that was taken out that house was swept and that house was garnished if the owner of that house would have filled it with something good when that guy came up to turn that key to open that door that house has been full and that Spirit wouldn't have won wanted to fellowship with what was in that house already so when we're doing when we're making changes in our lives or changes in church or changes in our family and we try to cut stuff out it's got to be replaced with something else you may say Well I'm Lord I'm trying to stop watching so much television I'm trying Lord forgive me for going to to bad websites I shouldn't be doing that I'm going to stop okay good you're on the right you're on the right track now replace it with something else because if you don't you might have swept the house but something's going to come back in and what do you replace it with replace it with something that should be done replace it if if you're bored get out and do something that you need to do if you're a student study you know if you're at home go out and do something in the yard fix something that needs to be done clean your car get something done because that idle time is the Devil's Playground you you replace those things when Jesus he was walking along and all the people were around him and they were they were touching him and and he's going along and there was a little lady that nobody knew anything about she was suffering with female trouble she's bleeding and she had it for long years and years and she came up and she snuck up behind Jesus and she knew in her mind if I can just touch the very Hem of this man's garment she had a revelation of who this Jesus was that he was powerful he could do anything if I can just touch His Garment then I will be healed so she goes and she sneaks up behind him and she touches it and immediately she's healed by her own face she was healed so what did Jesus do Jesus stops and he says who touched me the disciples are like hey everybody's touching you you know don't don't say that and he's like no virtue has gone from me so it came out of Jesus and it went into this woman that needed it so what did Jesus have to do he had to refill that virtue somehow and I will I will get to that scripture in a little bit now I look at look at the Dead Sea and we're familiar about with the Dead Sea and the Border there of Israel water you know why it's called Dead is because it's dead nothing lives there so water comes down the uh Jordan right the Jordan River and it goes into this big lake and nothing comes out the water comes in but nothing comes out of the lake so the water sits there and it stagnates it's in a desert area it evaporates up and everything that's impure in the water sinks down to the bottom this this water is evaporating and it concentrates all of the bad things there all of the salts and the minerals and it makes it to where nothing can live so we see the water it comes in and it doesn't come out and that's so many of us get that way the water can come in but if it's not flowing out like it did from Jesus that virtue came into Jesus and that virtue flowed out of Jesus if it doesn't do that then we get to a very low place the Dead Sea is the lowest place on Earth if some if stuff comes in and it doesn't come out we become dead and we see the Lord Jesus there The Virtue is coming in it's constantly coming in and then it's constantly going out there the um I have a friend had a friend who passed away a couple years ago I wanted to talk about him this morning he was he lived the worst life that I have ever seen his name Daniel and Stephanie gnome his name is Don Marsh Don was when he was a child his dad ran brothels in Louisville his mom was an absolutely horrible woman they were obviously divorced he gets to be about I think he was 14 years old there he is right there you got to be about 14 years old and his mom just didn't want him take care of him anymore him and his brother she takes him to the orphanage and just drops him off he goes up to the second store and he told me I got I went to the Second Story I looked out the window and there was mom getting in the car leaving and me and my brother stayed there and he he was just born to be doomed really so Don grows up his brother shoots himself in the head sitting right next to him I mean how could this young man live so he goes through his life and his dad his first memories as a child was his dad beating his mom I can't say how bad his life was he joins the army and he gets into um What's called the jumping they called him the jumping junkies because they were all heroin users and they jumped out of airplanes so he was he was jumping out of airplanes he was using drugs and just just had a just an awful awful way he jumps in this ditch and he says this let me quote him he says Lord he says I'm so tired of doing drugs and I'm so confused he says I'm losing my mind he said help me Jesus didn't know Jesus didn't know anything and he said he said help me so he took that and he started getting better and he started getting rid of some of the drugs and and a real he had a real problem with with women and and he got married and and then that started to fail and and he didn't replace all of the things that he was getting rid of he didn't replace them with anything and then finally he committed a horrible crime and ended up in prison and he's he's 30 years old and he's he's in prison as a lengthy sentence and he walks up to the bookshelf in the prison one of the first days he was there and he sees this book called footprints on the sands of time he picks it he picks it up and and he reads a little bit and doesn't think doesn't think much of it but he had remembered oh after I got out of the army I went to a Pentecostal Church and they mentioned this man named William Branham and about all these Miracles that followed his ministry and he said you know it always struck me I always I always liked that and I I picked that I picked that book out and I looked at it and oh there's that's him that's what he's is he's about didn't wasn't real serious about it gets does his time comes out of um jail because back to the church again there's a void started backsliding again started sinning again started doing the same things he told me he said everywhere I'd go every billboard I'd see it was women and alcohol he said I'd watch TV everything I saw advertised was women and alcohol he said I was focused I couldn't get away from it and then he would fall again found himself back in jail again got out again back in jail again more than 20 years he spent in prison back and forth and back and forth then he gets out of prison he says well I'll go to this Branham Tabernacle um because I think he was in prison in in Indiana so he he's he's going to live there so he um he goes and he starts going to church nobody would give him the time of day this guy first of all he was huge he was like six four six five he's built like Daniel except giant bigger and people knew his past they wouldn't reach out to him and I noticed he would stand up against the wall outside a church and lean up against the bricks and I just wondered why does he stand there by himself and I started to hear a couple rumors about him so I walked up to him and I said I said Hey brother I said I'm Daniel Evans I said what's what's your name he says brother his words he didn't give me his name he said brother nobody talks to me and I said why he says because I've done time hard time and I said I don't care I said tell me about yourself so we started talking don't ever cut anybody out friends no matter what they've done never set them aside because God might want to use you to bring that person in so I started talking to Don started fellowshipping with them after after church I introduced him to a couple of my friends one day he comes in I get a call from the receptionist uh there's a man here to see you I said okay so I go down and it's Dawn and he's upset and um I said yes sir I said I know him very well I knew it was past he would grow his fingernails so he could scratch this man didn't fight to fight he fought to live and he fought to kill that's what kind of a person he was so he's standing there and I come down I said what can I do for you he said my nephew just attacked my son and put him in the hospital and he said I'm going to kill him he said I need prayer and I said gets better I said okay um he said he says he says he said and he told me what everything that he did and I said let me tell you something I got right up in his face and I said don't waste my time and I was thinking in my mind in in my secret voice I was thinking this guy's huge this guy's mean this guy's a he's he's a killer and I just told him that and I was thinking okay I got to get ready because there's probably going to be a straight right coming right aimed at my nose and I got to be able to dodge and grab a hold of him long enough to where the secretary can call the police and if I can just hold on for a few minutes I won't die so I'm there and I'm I'm thinking all this in my mind and he looks at me I said don't waste my time if I pray for you you'd better receive what I pray for I said I don't have time for you I don't know why I said that he looked at me his eyes narrowed you saw the picture of him his eyes narrowed he said that's good counsel so I brought him into the chapel and we prayed and the spirit left him there in that Chapel that temper that hatred left Brother Don and we started corresponding with each other and I mean he was in the same town so poor and I'd always I try to give him something for Christmas you know so he could he could have food for um for a Christmas dinner and and Daniel and I would take him out sometime and spend some time with him but he turned into one of the finest people you have ever met loved the Lord Jesus absolutely just what he did is he started writing songs that void that was in him that came out that day that hatred he turned it into serving God's people through psalms I I got to do it one he uh he told Brother David Phillips one time what I did is I wrote an article about him in our in our magazine and uh I um David Phillips later on a few years later David he was talking with David and he says you know he says I'm this and he said he said you know he says I've never done anything for the Lord ever nobody even likes me and David tells him he said he said Brother Don that article that came out about you it's gone around the world he said your testimony has blessed hundreds of thousands of people David told them that may be the reason you were sent on Earth so you could give somebody else strength and Don said he says is that true my testimony yeah it's gone around everywhere so Brother Don I wanted to play something for he used to call me and and sing songs for me and leave it on my voicemail but I wanted to tell you I don't know if you can hear it I'll put it up next to my microphone um but uh here's here's a song that he wrote and he sang [Music] these days [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] beyond the Milky Way that's where we shall stay surrounding the throne of Jesus Jesus that he turned [Music] to think about that Serena I made himself to you have a good night I have no seriously I really need to talk to you [Applause] God bless his heart you know he took he had a terrible terrible life and I want to play one more this one's short um this is a um a message that he gave me right before he died he was in the hospital he had liver disease from all of his abuse of his body and he gave me I hope you can understand it I'll tell you what he said if you can't ah you never know what I want to call you yeah I don't know [Music] how you should come to me when I had a problem with part of the telling you about my nephew that one time out anyway I was with that boy anyway me and Abel Smith have bonding brother that's really great and I came to you one time about it I was like God I never went down that kind of route oh anyway I kind of laughed at myself sometimes those people whom I love the most now the ones I used to I always find software that's something don't worry God bless you got some songs coming at you soon God bless you for everything bye that makes me sad he said the ones that I used to hate the most are the ones that I love is that not the spirit of Christ did our brother Don not replace what the evil spirits and you think you have a bad you think that you struggle with things you got it easy compared to Brother Don and compared to a lot of other people but we have an obligation friends as we are working on these things in our lives that these we struggle and and we we toil and we try to get rid of all these things it has to be replaced with something it could be something so simple as going for a walk it could be something so simple as as cleaning your car or you could take 30 minutes in a day that you were doing something else and get on your knees it's the most important thing that we can do anywhere in life it's more important than reading this Bible it's more important than serving each other it's more important than anything is getting on our knees or standing or sitting in your chair or whatever it is and giving God time and talking to him praying to him Lord speak to me Lord I love you you created all of this you put me on this Earth Lord I am going to do my part now you replaced that void that's in in my heart in my body Lord you replace it and then he will you see a success story in the the worst of the worst right here and I witnessed it I saw it he went from a man that would tear your head off with temper that kept going prison and out in prison and out and fighting and all of these things but God got a hold of him and he opened himself up and he replaced that void of that evil spirit that left that day in the chapel and he replaced it with the Holy Spirit did he fail after that sure he did did he sin after that of course he did but there was something different about him there was something different about my friend and we go through I haven't I've all I have a lot of different examples let me um let me just say let me just say one and this is at the pool of Bethesda if we could uh quickly in closing turn to Saint John chapter 5. and well I'll read verse 14 and what had happened was we had this man he was by this pool and there that an angel would come and it seems superstitious just like sister Roberta Maybe a sign in a hand might see seems superstitious but these things are of God and what would happen is people would be laying around this pool in the town and every once in a while the water would start to churn and the first person that could get in the water this is in the Bible the first person that could get in the water would be healed of whatever ailment they had so we see all of these sick people laying around this pool just waiting for the churning of the water and as soon as that water would churn they'd all Rush In And they would cut in front of each other and this man was sick he had some sort of illness that made him slow other people would beat him to the water and he was laying there trying to trying to get in hopefully and who knows when it would happen once a year or whenever it was and Jesus who he didn't know walked up to this man and he says this Jesus saw him live let's turn to verse 6. and the man at verse 7 the man answered verse six I'm sorry and he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole and the impotent man answered sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me in the into the pool but while I am coming another steps down in front of me and Jesus saith unto him rise and take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked on the same day was the Sabbath and the Jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the Sabbath day and is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed and he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk so he was breaking the rules and carrying this bed on the Sabbath he was doing work but he said hey the man that healed me he told me to do this they asked him what man said that which is said unto thee take up thy bed and walk and he that was healed was not who it was he didn't know who it was first Jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place now here's the what I wanted to get to and sisters if if um if you want to come and close here's what I want to get to afterward Jesus finding him in the temple and said unto him behold Thou Art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee so this man had done sin this man had been a sinner we don't know anything else about him other than Jesus said don't do it anymore so he had to replace what had come out of him with something else that's wonderful thing about Divine Healing it's a wonderful thing when we're sick we're going to get sick again if the Lord doesn't come and all of us will walk that way of the Grave if we don't see the rapture but one of the wonderful thing about Divine Healing isn't necessarily so much that we get healed and we do and it's a blessing but it's that we can take that void that was created by that sickness and we can replace it with the Holy Spirit we can replace it with God we can replace it with serving his people we can replace those things else Divine Healing we're all going to die anyways like I said unless the Rapture happens but replace those things and friends that's what I want you to get out of my sermon is when you make a commitment to the Lord when you get healed when whatever it is those things come out make sure that that house gets filled back up or they'll come right back and it could be worse than the first amen God bless you let's stand brother Aaron if you could come and sing for us [Music] God removed two thousand years ago God removed something that had been in place for four thousand years and that was a blood sacrifice [Music] these animals whether it be goats or bulls or Lambs these animals would be sacrificed because of our sin [Music] that was taken out and it was replaced by the blood of Jesus Christ and that atonement will last from here until eternity through eternity it was Jesus Christ that died that took that sin away replaced the blood of bulls and ghosts the Bloods of animals that was not pure anyways and replaced it with the pure blood of the Lamb of God and today we have that the ultimate removal and replacement of something that's right let's bow our heads just think about his goodness and as we meditate on him just just for a minute think about the things that are in your lives each one think about something that needs to come out of my life something I need to change and all of us have a lot of things but something that's in my life that I need to change Lord as I make that effort to change it I ask by Your Word that you would replace that void [Music] let that house that has been made clean let it be filled but the holy spirit of God [Music] think about him friends think about what he's done for us think about yourself think about what you need to do [Music] Lord it is written in your word about a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and Lord as you look down upon this audience and you look down upon me Lord I ask that these voids that are created in our lives Lord may they be replaced things of God [Music] these houses that we do our best to make clean these vessels Lord may they be filled with the one Spirit the spirit of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit granted Lord we pray we love you thank you and Lord help us to do our part in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you friends I pray that you've gotten something this morning that'll help you through the week that you make a commitment to the Lord that not just getting rid of stuff filling that void back in remove those things and replace them and we have a special blessing tonight our brother Josiah is going to be ministering for us come expecting I think a lot of the young man and his wife and her sister the Robson family

message today every verse you know are there things you can do you learn [Music] some of you older folks can share with some of the younger ones learning experiences of life [Music] would get angry and upset and frustrated at home at work rather than take it out on someone [Music] I'd go outside in the yard and I'd clean it I'd go wash the car I'd go do something and burn all that energy away and then I could come back in and say I'm sorry and not reach act in anger in harshness but rather and then it's just the fellowship is so much better that way you say Lord I'm sorry I made a mess again I'm sorry but rather than just forgiving me Lord help me to fill it with something good something that that will be beneficial something that somebody else can receive from that would be our you said Brother Andy Brother Andy to come up and pray okay this mission in prayer but just just think of those things today look at it because we do get frustrated say Lord why did I react that way why
