saying when you've been going through something for a long time the devil starts telling you it's your fault it's your sin it's your failure the lord doesn't love you and he was just talking to me and he said you believe in the atonement you believe in your sacrifice you have confessed you are forgiven you are made perfect you stand there and i just lost it it was like the lord was speaking so directly to me and he said if you're going something the lord has found favor with you and i actually went back and i've listened to it several times since then and i just want to remind the devil it's not my fault he is my sacrifice he's paid the price and one day you're going to be burning in hell for what you've put us through and i'm going to be in heaven rejoicing and i just want to remind

he's the king of kings and lord of lords praise the lord don't you love the lord jesus it's good to be in his house on a wednesday night amen i'd rather be here than in the best bar in tucson some of y'all aren't sure well i tell you you just haven't drank enough of this kind of wine amen on the day of pentecost the bible says they these are not drunk as you suppose showing that the intoxication of the spirit of god is almost just like the intoxication of the world your troubles seem so far away that's what happens by christians they just don't drink enough they just get social drinkers and they just drink a little bit amen but the bible says be not drunk with wine but be full of the holy spirit amen i want to be full of the holy spirit amen i don't want to be half full i want to be full of the holy spirit amen thank you musicians god bless you all i appreciate each one of the specials that were sung or aaron's uh daughters the gyarados garris i i i got to learn to roll my r's we're going to have to spend time together so i can learn to roll my r's better amen in the johnson family we sure have grown to love them and their children each one we spent some time together last night some of the young people got together kind of quickly i do things kind of on the spur of the moment sometimes like in the instant end season and out of season but it was uh good to be together the young people we all were together and and played some music and read the bible and prayed together it was kind of a late notice maybe we can do a little better at planning that kind of going forward but i appreciate each one we spent some time doing the food bank there the other day was that tuesday my days are all running together six o'clock in the morning and did that until about noon and it was good to help the some people that are less fortunate you know just help us and and man we're all sharing what we have we share it together so it was a a good thing people have asked about emailing me and i give brother jordan my email address and my phone number that's okay if you text me most of the time i'm working at something in the kingdom of the lord or working somehow so if i don't get back with you the instant you uh text me then just please understand that but i'll try to respond to those things the best that i i can or if you need me call me on my cell phone and leave a message and we'll try to work through some things i want to greet everyone that's streaming tonight may god bless them those that can be here physically and those that are joining us virtu we want to reach out to them and and make available the streaming as we said we want to try to do some things as a church together and maybe not try to help the whole world right now i believe there'll be a time that we can do that but right now we just need to regroup a little bit and get through some things amen and i know brother jordan if you are a part of the church and want the link heap brother jordan can get that to you but we just want each one to respect that is that okay respect that that it's used among we as as the church body here if you have your bibles i want to go right to the word of god don't know how this is going to come out tonight but i've got it all in not sure how it's going to come out but the lord knows i let's go to psalms chapter 91 psalms chapter 91 i want to preach a message i had on my heart and i think i even mentioned it sunday that i was wanting to preach on submitting to god and we were together with some of the young people and the holy spirit redirected my thoughts i want to preach about traps and snares traps and snares and i don't think this is just limited to young people because i think their snares along in every one of our lives amen psalms chapter 91 let's just pray together first heavenly father we just pray that you would bless us tonight lord as we've sung the songs of zion lord i'm not a great preacher but i pray that you would help me to get myself out of the way lord that we could look at this subject of traps and snares of the enemy you would help us to avoid those traps and snares and lord if you're in a trap we believe you'll deliver us out of it father help us tonight we pray in jesus name amen amen i need a little bit more out of this monitors i can hear myself up there but i can't hear myself down here i'll end up screaming if i can't hear myself psalms chapter 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will save the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and that's where i want to take my text the bible it's a promise surely he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and that comes from the hunter brother aaron somebody is a fowler and they hunt foul and so the bible is saying here he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler isn't that a great promise of god my goodness there's traps all around us i've been in my share of my life but the bible says god would deliver us from the snares of the hunter that's good isn't it brother johnson back there you know why it's good because it's out of the bible that's where inspiration come people get inspiration out here and over here and that's okay but if we get our inspiration ever opened our bibles up the word of god is quick and it's powerful and it's inspiring amen he goes on to say and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and thy buckler thou shall not be afraid with me thou shall not be afraid thou shall not be afraid i say we take the word of god and say lord i'm tired of being afraid and i'm not going to be afraid anymore because the word says thou shall not be afraid amen for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyeth by day north for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wastes at noon day a thousand shall fall at thy sad and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh unto thee only with thine eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague came nigh thy dwelling and he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways amen may god add his blessing to the word you may be seated i was just thinking about this subject and it came back to me i was with some of the young people and i thought you know that's i want to just speak a little bit about traps and snares and i was looking up the definition it's good to see these young men on the front row amen god bless you young men amen i'd like to see all the young people up on the front row close to me are you matthew god bless you matthew i had breakfast with your dad this morning amen he's a good man amen and so i was thinking about this a trap is listen to me really close here a trap is a device or an enclosure designed to catch and retain animals a trap is a device or an enclosure designed i want you to notice it's designed to catch and retain animals and boy hasn't the devil designed some some devices to capture the souls of men's and women can you say amen to that the devil's got some devices he's designed a snare is a trap for catching birds and animals it's a little bit too loud right there back at me a trap for catching birds and animals typically a noose or a wire or a cord and i thought about that boy how many people have got their neck in a noose when i wear an old tucson out here it wasn't just the cowboys but the devils built some nooses and got people's necks and those nooses and my we see it all around us people that can't move from those traps and i was i was i pulled up and did a little research on some of the traps and i just want to go through a few of these and maybe there's many many traps but i just thought we'd go through a couple of them is that okay is everybody with me so i was thinking of one trap is called they call it the leg trap a leg trap uh is uh they also call it a foot trap and it's uh it's uh by proponents they use it in the fur trade and it's a leg hold and comprised of a a metal foot plate and and and and curved jaws powered by hefty spring and i i haven't worked with our audio video enough team enough to get our pictures and things like that but you how many have ever seen a foot trap it's one that's got a little thing and it closes and it holds it kind of right in there and it's it's powered by hefty springs and i was thinking about this and while i was thinking about the holy spirit was dealing with me it said it usually is anchored into the ground by a short chain and a metal spike and it is secured to a tree and a large branch and i thought about this how these traps you don't just get caught in a trap brother aaron and then run off with the trap but usually the trap is it's anchored to the ground and somewhere you just you get uh instead of being mobile you become immobile we're talking about your journey from earth to glory and you get caught in that trap and somehow that trap that traps you it traps you and usually it's not the trap that kills you but the trap is attached to the ground to where you can't move on in your journey in your life oh blessed be the name of the lord amen it's a trap to the ground so you can't go in a rapture you become an earth-bound creature and it traps you to the ground i thought boy how many people are are just anchored maybe to their job so deeply they can't move on with a god some people are anchored to a boyfriend or a girlfriend and they can't move on with god when god's saying hey you need to move on closer to me and they're so anchored to the ground and the the world and the earth and and those things and they can't move on some people are they're they're uh how could i say they're in a trap and they're they're bound to hatred maybe bitterness and it's got them all held and for years and years and you come back and talk to them their testimony is the same and bitterness and hatred it's a it's a trap i was thinking about that it's a it's a trap and it's a leg trap it holds on to your leg and and it holds you and i was thinking about this because the the little definition says once triggered a trap immortal immobilizes the animal and prevents them from eating oh this is really amazing it is that people stop reading their bible and praying and a church and they stopped caring for their babies and staying hydrated and fending off predators and sheltering themselves from the from the elements now we can see a little uh maybe a coyote or a little prairie dog in that stage but what about people who get in that and they they they get caught in a trap it prevents them from eating spiritually they stop reading their bible they stop praying they stop listening to the voice of god's prophet which is spiritual food and due season stored up for this day we get caught in a trap it might be a trap of world in us and we just don't have time to listen to god's problem if you don't if you don't have time to listen to god's prophets you're too busy you're just too busy you might be in a trap somewhere and i was thinking about that how many mothers we see get caught in a trap of worldliness or social media or the the the movement of the modern woman and seeing them abandon their their children their own need natural affection for their children and they'll abandon it to run off there and chase some fictitious mirage in the world can you say amen to that you probably know people like that maybe abandon their husband abandon their their children and just run off somewhere they're in a trap in their mind the devil has trapped them somewhere i thought about leg traps are designed to hold a wild animal who does not want to be caught as such and what many animals become so desperate they resort to chewing or ringing off their own trapped limb in order to escape and breaking their teeth and bones in the process and i there really has to come a desperation to live it takes the desperation say i'm going to live i thought jesus in matthew 18 9 said if thine eye offend thee pluck it out cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than with two eyes to be cast into hell fire so jesus is telling us a priority the priority we've got to be free we've got to be journeying on with the lord we've got to get away from these traps i was thinking about an animal endures a painful and panic-filled weight oh listen can you just see people spiritually they're caught in a trap brother aaron and they're in this pitiful and they're waiting for because it's not the trap that closes on your leg that kills you it just holds you it just keeps you from going on with the lord it just keeps you from being able to go and eat the the animal endures a painful panic field weight until they're either die from exhaustion blood loss dehydration or hyperthermia or a clubbed or choked or stomped by the trapper so as not to damage the pelt because remember the devil he what the predator is doing he's trying to trap you because he wants your life he wants to take your life remember job i'd like to preach job right here remember the devil come to him said yeah you got a hedge around him so god said take the hedge around but you can't have his life there's something about the life of a christian and i thought about that because the devil wants to take every one of us and make us a trophy on his wall some of the brothers i don't know if you all hunt or whatever you go and you shoot the game and then you bring it back and you and you put it up on your wall and you say hey this was this and then you usually always have a story that you tell behind that and how the devil would love amen to take your soul and take your testimony and all that god's done for you like samson they brought him out to make sport and put him up on the wall and say hey this is a great trophy remember brother brandt said usually it's money women are popularity they're able to trap these people well i got this one this way and i got this one this way and i got and he sits there with his little imps in hell and tells them these little stories is everybody you've probably got people that are going through your mind right now traps the devil threw a trap out there and and trapped them into it i was thinking about this brother random says this in the message mark of the beast in 1956 he said you know yonder in hell the tag is hanging on the door expecting you there one of these mornings the devil is so confident in his trap the prophet of god tells us that he's already got a tag in hell with every one of your names on it you see how confident he is in lady josiah and satan's eden he says well oh i know they went up to the altar now they made a start for god but i've got traps for them i'm re you know it's a lot of times the devil doesn't mind he'll stay outside the door say hey go have a good service i'll be here for you when you get out we need a power of the holy ghost that doesn't just keep us in church but he keeps us when we go outside of the church amen something begins to move and that's the god i need i mean it's all right when we're in here we're all brothers and sisters and man if the devil comes in brother the deacons will get him brother aaron will get him her brother arnie back there we'll get but when we go outside man sometimes we get alone it's just you and the devil in the car and say lord i need you to be with me i'm no match for the traps of the devil can you say amen to that i'm no match for the mental traps of the devil i'm no match for the fiery darts oh but hallelujah he said greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so my confidence is in christ brother rahm said you go to you better go let somebody who can go there and take it from you take it off there's only one that can do that that's the son of god i have overcome death and hell and i'm he that was dead and alive forevermore all other grounds are sinking sand that's good advice from a prophet when he i don't know if he took a journey to hell and saw the name tags there but he said there's one that's ordained to go and take that name take off and said not that one not that one i've got their name in the lamb's book of life or do you believe it today amen we should believe the word of god revelations 13 8 revelation 17 8 we all remember hebrews 13 8 or hebrews yeah hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and forever it's up there on the back but what can we remember revelations 13 8 and revelation 17 8 their names were written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world that was going to be a little bit just you know surprised when christ comes and takes my name off i want him to take your name off today amen if you haven't dedicated your heart to god amen give with the program amen because we're not going to everyone whose names are on the lamb's book of life amen have been redeemed brother brahm said that i believe it was the breach he said every one of those redeemable sons and daughters of god have to be dipped in that clorox amen that washes away our sins i'm so glad for clarks hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i was thinking about this and i made some notes here and i was thinking about it and some of you all may be hunters and trappers but traps are placed where animals are passing through they're just not out in the desert somewhere they they hunters they pattern those animals my my boys you know we just go out and just sit in the woods and now they got trail cameras they put out there my boy i think he went about 20 of them put them everywhere out there and then he had to go back and drive and collect them all and it's got an app that shows right where they all are and then they got this other technology with the radio ones where you don't even have to go out and check it man you're sitting at your office man and boom hey there's a deer and and wow that's the way the devil is he's patterning you he knows you better than yourself hey man the devil watches you even when you're sleeping he's steady and they're back in hell like ah what do you think what do you think i don't know he's watching us and and where the animals pass through and where the souls pass through you know he's had six thousand years to perfect his techniques you know you're not the first young brother or young sister to come through here he's had six thousand years to to perfect his techniques and i i gotta say we got a worthy adversary amen it's like an atomic bomb you know you know you you you know that the damage and the destruction that can come from it i don't fear the devil but i acknowledge his power i acknowledge that if i get away from the greater my big brother christ i'm no match for him i mean let that settle in somewhere because a lot of times people become christian like oh i got this and god's going to say no you don't have this i've got this you don't and then he allows you to fall down so he can prove to you you don't have this without me you can do nothing and i was thinking about that because there's a season of trapping there's a season it just doesn't and so a lot of times with the souls it's like friday night or saturday and the devil realized there's a season and work's over and there's a lot of times i found with people and even young people i know when i was going to school you're in the grind you got to get to school and there's deadlines but it's in between that when that and then you got that little time in there that you can have that time and then the devil reaches to your through your friends or through this or that can you say amen to that you watch on friday night those spirits of loneliness and depression and things start out through there and amen the bible says we're not ignorant of his devices by this time we should understand hey that's where the predator that's where i got caught in that trap before i've said it before i say it again you go around the corner and you fall down and then you go around that same corner again and you fall down you know what you do you stop going around that corner you stop going around that corner the devil got you that remember brother around says that i think it's greatest battle ever fought little nelly sanders remember god deliverer of the music and things like that she got up there and and she said well that really doesn't bother me anymore brother graham said that right there is where the devil's got you he said if it got you the first time it'll get you the second time and every one of us have a weakness and we need to know where that weakness is and if you're a christian for very long you know where that weakness is and brother man says cover that weakness with prayer pray amen you might have a temper you got from your great great grandfather brother ram says sweeten that temper with prayer amen i was thinking about that a lot of times it happens in a change of life and we were talking to young people last night about the change of life and you see these deer hunting and they always do the elk hunts and the deer hunts right in the rut time amen because uh they there's chemicals changing in the and so what that animal wouldn't do under are you listening to me what that animal wouldn't do under certain circumstances chemicals have changed in their body and now they're going and doing things and they're they're how could i say it they're they're oblivious to the to the danger that's around them i wish every young person in tucson is in this room right now when those chemicals come into their body and pretty soon they become oblivious to the danger around them as they were talking about drinking alcohol they know that the the alcohol diminishes your ability to reason and that's where the devil comes he comes through that little depression a little bit and a little bit of blues and somebody's taking their some alcohol and then it diminishes their their ability to reason and their cognitive skills and then pretty soon the devil has pretty got him in another trap and another trap he's got a lot of traps out there i was thinking about that if you have your bibles i want to go to a couple scriptures first corinthians chapter 12 chapter 6. you can put those up i'm sorry i i some of this women helping with the babies they said well we can't turn our bibles so if it'll help them if you all understand that for women children holding they're holding the babies it's not for we young men that need to know where our sword some of us don't have our sword sharp we need to sharpen them up so we'll let them have that and they can the brothers want to put those up first corinthians chapter 6 verse 18. we're going to talk some of the traps so the bible says flee fornication talking about traps tonight the bible tells us look there's a trap right there you need to flee that for every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god you are not your own you don't have the uh you're not your own i probably said this if i i preached here before but you you don't you you can't tattoo your own body you don't have the right to pierce your own body because it's not your body the bible says you are the temple of the holy ghost how many understand what i'm saying today yeah so the devil will tempt you and get you down a thing and i've probably said you've heard me say before and people go out and they get under an illusion get in a trap and they tattoo mama on their shoulder and then they wish i wish i hadn't tattooed mama on that when i was inebriated and they come back and so the devil has all kinds of traps that he traps people in that's why we see these markings it actually comes from an insecurity someone is not securing themselves so they have to get an identity that proves they are somebody because they're identifying with a higher power that's why you see all these sports figures and all this and they're just totally tatted up and down their arms and tattooed and it's just like you know those are gods and whatever those gods do that's what their followers start doing way way back you probably use somebody remember that mr t the guy had an earring in his ear and way way back there and then you see those waves and they come and it's just worldliness whatever the world does we want to get away from it we see those trends you know that come through and and i was thinking about this you know you're not you're bought with a price verse 20. therefore glorify god in your body sometimes that's where we stop but the bible says also glorify him in your spirit i don't feel like smiling today guess what you don't have the right to make that choice you're not your own you're bought with the price and you went up here and got baptized some of you in that own pool up there and you took on the name of jesus christ which is hey you watch me i'm a christian christ isn't here but i'm hearing instead you don't have the right to go around with a frown in your face but some of us get trapped thinking like i got the right to do this and we're caught in this gloom and doom no you need to smile a little bit people are looking at you when you got baptized they're looking at you lord help us as christians amen we're for the cause of christ i was thinking about while we're here we'll just go to the next chapter verse one now therefore concerning the things you wrote under me so paul was doing questions and answers and they were writing hey paul what about this what about this what about this he said it is good thing for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband are we all can we think like adults tonight is that okay is it okay just to look at the scripture so they're writing him about things that are happening previous to this he says hey look you need to flee fornication and his next part is hey you wrote me about a couple things and it's good for a man not to touch a woman oh well no but the next verse says nevertheless to avoid fornication which is unclean living before marriage let every man have his own wife and be married so there's a time and place for those things i think we ought to be a bible-believing church don't you and i think it's good among our young people that there's not a lot of that going on because it's the bible amen because i was thinking about how the devil he sets a lot of traps for people my mother told me one time she said i trust you but i don't trust the devil he's got a lot of traps out there a lot of traps i was thinking we were reading so there's 31 proverbs and we read a proverb there's for every day whatever the day of the month is we try to read that proverb in the day so i was reading that yesterday if you want to turn back with me proverbs chapter 2 is this just good old home cooking it's something you can take home and chew on tomorrow something that'll help you when the devil comes when that trap gets there you say oh but our brother daniel he came from indiana was screaming about traps proverbs chapter 2 verse number 11. the bible's talking about discretion shall preserve the understanding shall keep thee i believe in another problem that says with all thy getting get understanding that's why i was so slow in school because they just wanted you to get it and do a score and i'm like no i want to understand this i have to understand because the bible says with all that getting get understanding if you're a young person you want to go somewhere in life just try to understand i don't understand that some things you don't understand it's just the way it is i can't understand why god uh told us to have foot washing he's like wait a minute we all got showers we all do this but jesus said if you don't do it peter you have no part with me so after i was like i don't care if you understand or not that's the word of god i don't know why the bible says it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair but that's what the bible says i don't have to understand it i just believe it and i just obey it but as far as life is the bible says get understanding why because understanding shall keep thee i was thinking about this go down to verse 15 understanding he goes on to say in 16 to deliver thee from the strange woman even from the stranger with flatterist with her words who forsaketh the guide of her youth and forgetteth the covenant of her god for her house inclineth unto death and her paths unto the dead none that go unto her return again neither take they hold of the paths of life so now the bible is talking about some of these traps that can get a hold and we were talking to some of the young people how the devil puts perverted thoughts in your minds and it used to be and i used to say this years ago there'll be a time that you'll be thankful that your boy likes a girl there'll come a time to be thankful that your girl likes a boy because the world has brought all kinds of perversion they come and says i don't know if i'm i'm straight or i'm bisexual transgender i don't know and so you see all this experimentation we were talking last night to the young people how the suicide rate among the transgender is twice what the normal suicide rate is so people go out and the devil says look i know you got the plumbing and the hardware for a man but you're really a woman and so he puts those thoughts and those traps in their mind they get caught in this trap and they go and they have come is this okay i know this is just kind of really plain but you know what the devil is really playing and so if the devil's going to be how they say fight fire with fire if he's going to be playing let the word of god teach us i learned more about the things of life in the house of god listening to the prophet of god preached serpent seed and and marriage and divorce and understanding life and i was thinking about that how that he sets all these traps and will keep us from the evil woman amen and god help us to have a sound mind i don't want to be caught in those traps i've seen my friends get caught in those traps and i've got a couple hear how the lord delivered me out of i thought about last night let me go back to that other because those people they train they they go across and maybe they have the surgery and then they can't get back to the other side where they were they're trapped over here in some type of perverted and the suicide rate those people are twice as high as the normal suicide rate hey let's just not go there there's one thing better than learning from your mistake is learn from somebody else's mistake and say i'm not going down a path that i don't know if i'm a man or a woman god made me what i am and i am what i am amen the devil comes in those people's minds they puts this experimentation thoughts in their mind and i've said it before but i'll say it again for the sake of our young people there maybe before they go through a change and those chemicals come in a girl they're like oh boy's got cooties and they come in like oh yeah yeah yeah see you don't like boys so see you like girls and you like to hang around the girls so see you're a lesbian or a young boy say see you don't like girls like that see you're homosexual you you just need to love boys and and they come in those people's minds and my friend john sanger is talking about i think your cousins are they were talking about how they give them those injections that don't allow them to go into those changes of life so so they can get older and then they can decide what they are can you imagine the insanity that to me it's the utmost form of rebellion when god says you're this and you say i don't want to be that i want to be something else but they tell me that you can do whatever you want to do to change what you are but they take one extraction of your dna and it tells the whole story you are what you are what god made you there's all kinds of traps there's music traps we had a did a little survey at camp one time about music and i think it was about 80 percent or higher of the young people struggled with music and and bad music and had such an influence on them and even some of this contemporary music that i'm not big on we were talking about the other day the contemporary music they can sing to their boyfriend or their girlfriend and then bring the same song into church and sing it and there's nothing about jesus christ or calvary or the blood of jesus christ i tell you what i like to know who i'm singing to i like to know it's jesus christ i like to hear the blood of jesus christ and what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus i love him well i don't know i love him because he first loved me and died on calvary's tree there's no question what that song's about i was telling him the other day i got had a cd and somebody said you know those that cd or that singer uh he did a whole cd and jesus isn't even on there i'm like no way i went back and listened to cd and twice in the whole album two times they mentioned the name jesus yeah i don't know if they're singing to jesus or lucifer and that i get a sermon called called the kingdom of god and how there's two kingdoms of god and the kingdom of the devil and the devil's wanting to blend them together the bible says god of this evil age he sits in the temple of god worshiped as god and people think they're worshiping jesus christ and they might be giving glory to another another venue there so i pray god will help us to not get like the world and the things of the world and it all yeah i tell you you can hear a little bit of that stuff and then you hear the christian stuff and it's it's funny how the christian people are listening to the worldly people to get their saying and they sound like everybody's about to die and die of a fixation and you know and and you know it's just really funny and it's all sad and it's like wait why don't you just sing your song you know it's really amazing though when you hear the christian people and it matches the worldly people we shouldn't be going to the world to get our inspiration amen our inspiration comes from christ i'll tell you another trap is a time trap how many time traps somebody was the other day said hey i got this mower i'll give to you i said i don't want your mower because i know i got to tune it up and i gotta winterize it i gotta sharpen the blades and i gotta do all that stuff it's a time trap we need to realize what our priorities in life and the things that you can shed away from here just get rid of it i ask you man hey i'll give you a 66 mustang a 1966 mustang okay what are you going to do it's going to take your time you have to grind that and sand it all down and buy a new upholstery and get on the internet and get this and get a paint booth and get all this stuff and this and this pretty soon you're not going to church because you got this may god help us to realize where the time traps off say hey get rid of this stuff and pretty soon you can't read your bible can't pray can't go to church where you're trapped in a trap of time how many say amen to that right now the holy spirit may be dealing with you you need to get rid of all implants brother daniel are you preaching against plants no i'm not preaching against plants i'm talking about traps that trap you away from god blessed be the name of the lord i sat on an airplane it's good to laugh once a while like we said sunday it's like a medicine sat on an airplane lady had her tablet and she's playing this game matching the donuts and donuts and danishes and dude she's doing like lady what in the world why don't you do something productive i'm sitting there with my headphones on you know writing my sermon down on a thing and you know she's playing the donut thing and it's like lady and you see these video games you see growing men with careers trapped in a video game and it's totally waste of time and they're trapped in hours and hours into the night and you get all done and shut it down like hey what have you accomplished well i feel better and you know what it is a lot of times those videos games men cannot achieve something in the real world so they go to the virtual world and try to become great and they feel like they're empowered i say we need to get back into the real world jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel and accomplish something for the kingdom of god there's a couple verses i want to talk about maybe i don't want to get ahead of myself here but another trap is a body trap body trap it's it's something that instantly comes and it just crushes your whole body it's an instant like the and so it just crushes you and how many people you see get caught in a trap maybe a situation at church and it just crushes their spiritual life i've seen sometimes things that happen to a minister and the minister maybe take a a bad road and it just crushes and the church just all goes to the world like hey wait a minute were you tied to christ and the cross of christ or were you tied to a man my goal is to tie people to jesus christ so tight that something would happen to brother daniel they'd just walk right on with christ say he's not my salvation he was nothing but a sign pointing me to the rapture and trying to keep me on the path blessed be the name of the lord people lose their job and they you know and or maybe they they uh um they go through a divorce and it just crushes their desire for god may god help us to run from those traps amen i'm watching the time back there let's go through a couple more one is a i'm going to call them a live trap you know the devil loves this live trap probably some of you all have them i don't know if you boys have them but they're little square traps about this square and they're they're metal wire and they're about that maybe that longer they have the big one my nephew got one it was a coyote one about that big and you go pull the door up have you anybody ever seen those and you pull the door up it has a little tray going or you put some food in there cat food and this little animal sniffs all around it then they go in the door and the door falls down on them and he's still alive the animal is very much alive inside but they're trapped they're trapped they're no more free and it's just a matter of time till they die of starvation because they can't eat and then they they die of they don't have any water so they become dehydrated this is more than just a sermon how many people you see that are just dying out there and they don't have the spirit of god remember brother em talks about arizona those little leaves that twist up and they become prickly and they just like criticize this and this and this and and this is wrong that's wrong that's wrong and that's wrong like are you in a trap somewhere you just need a good old dose of the holy ghost you need to water the holy ghost just to come down on you you become soft and pliable and we see people like that there they're dying of starvation maybe they've got all the books and the tapes and and they can they they have it all right there but they're in a trap somewhere and they start eating they start getting that water of the holy ghost oh blessed be the name of the lord i want to stay hydrated in god's spirit it's important you know here a couple months ago i don't know how long ago i had a trouble i couldn't read i was like why can't i and i have contacts i don't know if it's just my age and i realize i'm not drinking enough water to keep my body hydrated so when my eyes blink i'm not putting moisture on my eyes and because i are you listening to me because i wasn't getting enough water and in the spirit you're not getting enough water you see things a little blurry so you know what i did about it i fixed the problem i have a daytime every day i go into work and i have this day timer the first thing on it i do is drink 20 ounces of water so i have a cup of water get a water a gallon jug dump in 20 ounces chug it down set it down boom done with that mark it off my day time and it'd do us all good for us to have a little spiritual thing of hydration when i wake up this morning i need to spend some time with jesus christ and read my bible and get down and pray and say lord i need you today lord i need the holy ghost i need the love of god like we had lunch with sister heather yesterday and she said you know i was growing up as a nominal christian i just said lord i love you so much if there's anything else you want me to do i'll do it lord and then god began to reveal more to her and more to her and just we sing that little song let me fall in love with you all over again we fall in love and just become hydrated and we get out of those traps if you have your bibles luke chapter 21 talking about the trap so these are some good ones here and they're written in the bible so i'm just going to preach through this one luke chapter 21 verse 34. the bible says take heed to yourselves or take attention now this is really good we're going to get the internet here in the bible lest at any time your heart should be overwhelmed with surfing ah that's good right there brother daniel it says surfing yeah i know i looked it up surfing an excess of amount of something an excessive amount of something might as well put surfing in there right brother ram talks about these young people being caught in the devil's web and they can't get out of the devil's web years before the www i don't know if any of you all google anything or put anything on the internet but it's always it used to be www they've made the browser smarter now so you don't have to put www in there the browser puts it in and you don't even see it but it's called the world wide web that people are entangled in and they can't he said lest your heart be overcharged with surfeiting an excessive amount of something and drunkenness what is drunkenness it's an intoxication and we see people are being become intoxicated with the things of the world hobbies and sports and they become so intoxicated with their the things of the world they don't even care about the thing that's why that's how you can tell somebody that's intoxicated they they're not they're distant from reality the things that should mean something don't mean anything they get really drunk and they're driving down the road and they don't even care that they've crossed the center line how many people can you look at today and say that person is drunk they're drunk on lady osea and the intoxication of our world whether it's the pleasures of world and the love of the world and the things of the world jesus said the love of god's name not even in you lord help us today he goes on to say and the cares of this life so that that day come upon you unawares for as a snare there it is again as a trap jesus is saying it's going to come like a trap it's just going to bite you as a trap as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of the earth so he tells us the the way to uh to to get out of this trap of missing the rapture he said watch ye therefore and pray always it's so important that you pray i don't know i'm what do they call it a compulsive ex thing whatever that is you know when i was young they never had a name for all those disorders because if i had got tested for them i'd probably had a bunch of them and so you know you just live your life and that what is it attention deficit disorder and some of those and i've got friends that they diagnose them with that and they're running million dollar companies today the devil wants you to give a little something there maybe you're not like everybody else he wants to give you a little tag and you sit in the corner and do don't do anything i say i don't i don't know i was born and lord here i am on the earth and i might have a handicap here i got a lot of handicaps but i'm doing my best that i can with my handicaps for the lord jesus christ i want to do all that i can when i get there and he said i know daniel i gave you this handicap and this handicap and this handicap but my look what you did for god's kingdom with all those handicapped there was paul he's sitting there he said lord i've asked you to take away this blinded i could write better letters and be a better messengers and god said my grace is sufficient for you because my strength is made perfect in the fact that you have a handicap paul oh my god help us to release ourselves from the trap your trap the devil might tell you hey you're getting old you're not useless you're not useful in the kingdom oh it's a trap of the devil i mean you become more powerful in your ministry i think i said this here before but i'll say it again i was on that plane and that lady said hey merry christmas to you all and i'm too old to care if i offend anybody and she realized she had a mission to proclaim christmas or or whatever christ's birth in her way but you also have it to say whatever there comes an age i'll just say this there comes an age i don't know what that age is where you can say anything and people can't do anything about it and i say as i get older i don't know what that is i know it'll come but you say i believe jesus christ is the son of god that died on the cross to take away my sins and you're sitting in the doctor's office what are they going to do to you just say it praise god hallelujah jesus is my savior there's only one true god his name is jesus christ what are they going to do to you i say we start each one of us go into our world and preach the gospel of jesus christ you can go do things that i could never ever do william branham could never go into your world but you have an opportunity only god releases from the traps that the devil's got us in so many other ones i was thinking about the parable matthew 13 we don't have time to to to to the bible says that the word of god was sown and the persecution the cares of this life oh here's one the deceitfulness of riches and people get trapped i gotta have so much money i've got to have so and pretty soon they start laying aside the things of god to get this money and the bible says there's a deceitfulness with riches i tell you when it starts taking you out of church and getting your priorities wrong i say it's time to lay aside those things i've got another i you know i don't know it's there's somewhere in these notes but i was thinking about that because the devil will put you in a trap i almost got trapped in that one time i somebody came to me i'm gonna find it in these things if i have to it's the last thing i do oh it's it's a it's a free trap here's one called a free trap some of you all really get caught in these free traps i got news for you nothing's free you gotta love my wife but i give her an email address and with just a little bit of time it's just overflowing with all this stuff well i signed up for this and signed up for this since i all said you know they have the devil has an agenda what you thought was free and they're data mining all your demographics and your age and your your all that stuff so they can send you the right kind of advertisement from this place and i don't even know all the places she gets their emails and stuff from and you thought it was free and the devil's got a i remember when we were young we just got married we were poor's job's turkey we were really poor and somebody came along and said look hey we'll offer you free rent in this house okay great great what's the catch oh you just have to work off the the rent you got to work it off on the weekends every day you got to work when you come home from work you got to go work and then i realized you know what that ain't free that ain't free it's going to cost me a lot probably cost my marriage cost my walk with the lord i can't go to church because i'm trying to you know get this free house you know and i tell you what the bible says you'll know the truth and the truth will make you free and i learned there was a verse in the bible it was over in matthew chapter 6 verse 33 it said seek ye first the kingdom of god and all these things will be added unto you and i took the the escape and you'll know the truth that will set you free and it set me free hey i don't need your free house because it's really going to put me in bondage as a trap oh i could have more money in this world but what about my soul what would a prosperous man if he gained the whole world and he lost his soul what about our children hey we'll make our children they'll be a way of that but what if they lose their soul we need to get our priorities right is jesus christ amen our number one priority is a parent to lead our children to jesus christ i was thinking about those traps i heard the story about these wild boars and you know they were wild they run around they just wanted food and it was free food and so what the people did is they put a trap they put a bucket of food down and then they put up one fence right here and the boars all come in at night and ate it and they ran off and next day they brought more food and put it up there and they put a gate here and every day they did that and they put another gate and they never even noticed the gates because they were getting free food oh listen to me now they put another gate up and they put another gate up and put the food out then they had another one they went up and they all went in and they dropped it and they're trapped and you know what they didn't even care because they started getting free food and they weren't free anymore oh my goodness i'd rather be free in the holy ghost amen where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty lord i want to be free in the holy spirit blessed be the name of the lord i want to be free to love him you know we got some experience with these traps my boys they homeschooled and one day they caught a skunk one of these live traps and they had this bright idea and skunk's got to raise his tail to spray brother matt and they said well i don't think he can raise his tail well he could raise his tail and i sprayed my boy william they sprayed it all over and they actually were homeschooling the top of our business they come in and the whole place just stunk and my son you know he's brilliant he's like oh i think i can mask this he had to go to work a little after i think so he goes in the bathroom and gets his febreze spray sprays it all over like and we laugh oh that's funny but sometimes we do that with sin and we get the skunk of the devil all over us and we try to get this spray and try to mask it i mean it's like a leopard trying to lick his spots off he just wipes everything off so that those spots are more blatant amen and we just need the blood of jesus christ to cleanse us from our sins and cleanse us from all the effects of that old skunk of the devil if i ever knew a skunk it was the devil sometimes we don't think he's going to get us but he gets us may we come to the cross of christ and let god cleanse us i don't know how to preach but sometimes the devil comes and say well god's children don't get in traps well i think brother branham was probably a child of god he got caught in a trap he went over to africa over there his missionary trip to africa brother billy's with him 16 year old to get in the car and they said the angel of the lord told me to go to here and they they had this agenda said well you're going here you're going here and you're going here billy paul if you listen he said he said that's not what the angel lord he said well that's what you're doing he didn't have a cell phone he gave didn't car he didn't have any money he had nothing so he went with the brothers and he stopped the car he got them all out he lined them all up on the road brother billy said he took dirt and threw it all up on their feet he said i'm going with you because i don't have any choice but god's going to make us all pay for it he was caught in a trap you come back home you've probably read it and brother ram tells it on tape he said i was sick for a month had the amoebas in my stomach and he said he was just thought he was going to die he said i learned a lesson he said i'll never listen to ministers or anything that takes me away from the angel the lord and the word of god there's something better than learning from our own mistakes that's learning from somebody else's mistakes a trap that the prophet said i'm not going to get in that trap oh blessed be the name of the lord sometimes ministers get caught in traps you know i was thinking about that how that you know as this coronavirus it's it's it's it's real it's not a it's a real virus and and you know it's many of you maybe had it and god's healed you and the bible didn't say we'd get sick he said many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord will deliver them out of them all so many of us have had it and god's healed i think the recovery rate is 99.7 recovery rate so we were talking about it as a minister because we're not running a medical institution we're running a sin institution and so i was thinking about there's a coronavirus but there's a sin virus that is much more deadly than the coronavirus listen to me now jesus said fear not him that is able to destroy the body but him that is able to destroy the soul and the body and listen to me because jesus said this thing is highly contagious it's just not contact and we're in a mass jesus said whosoever looketh upon a woman that's committed you mean you can get this virus by just look yes and you know what the fatality rate is a hundred percent of people that don't get the vaccine people that get the sin virus 100 fatality rate i was reading over there thinking about the scripture over in in romans the wages of sin the end of sin is death eternal separation from god oh but thanks be to god that he created a virus amen uh uh uh how did brother ham say an inoculation from the virus amen and not just didn't pick a human himself amen jesus christ took the inoculation he said i no man takes my life from me i lay my life down and i'll take it up again and see if this inoculation that's in me amen will bring me out of the death bring it bring me out of the grave oh blessed be the name of the lord how does it say it over in romans amen how jesus say in revelation he said i am he that was alive was dead and i am alive forevermore and have the keys of death hell in the grave romans 80 said and if the same spirit that raised me from the dead dwell in you oh blessed be the name of the lord it will quicken your mortal body oh i'm so thankful if you're talking about death and you know age is kind of creeping up on me a little bit there i see i see it out there i want to know in whom i have believed and be persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day i want somebody that has some experience with maybe will write books and like life after death live are they like oh i ain't seen a big break light oh my goodness i want to talk to the man that created life the man that is life who died and rose again and said daniel if my spirit dwells in you it'll quicken your body oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah i was thinking about that my i've got something here but i'm i'm just going to skip that we'll skip that trap how's that sound but i was thinking about that sometimes people they get caught in traps and they take detours i just get take detours i was thinking about that we call them back home we call them one man denominations and somebody will come in and say look that thing's wrong right there i take a little detour and they don't just go themselves they take their whole family with them and they go on a detour and it's just really it's sad and i was dealing with situation here some time back and actually somebody used to go to this church 20 25 years ago and they just got something in the church and boom they went off and then i'd end up with their family way off later and the mother sits down with me and said man we took a 20-year detour 20 you dear in their family motorcycles and leather and all kinds of bars and drinking all and you know what i was thinking we don't have 20 years to go on a detour we don't have 20 years on it to go on a detour i say lord don't let me get caught in a trap i'll say this when you see traps and you know you're in treacherous time you walk slower you walk really slow and you move start moving slow you don't rush and because somebody maybe somebody were in the military and they had minds and you start walking really slow in a minefield and you start and we start praying more we don't make rash decisions we say lord let me pray let me be you know i'm going to skip over some more of this stuff but we need to pray more i'm big on prayer if you're around me we're going to be praying because that's the way jesus said pray pray watch and pray i'm going to talk about another trap just a couple more and then we're going to close another trap is not a box it's a poison trap and maybe you have rats somewhere and you put out that decon and it poison that rat in just the poison it doesn't kill him it just slows him down listen to me that he doesn't perform like he used to before it just slows in and how many people have allowed the devil something to be added to their to their spiritual person and they don't function like a real son of god should or a real daughter of god and they've become poisoned i was reading something you know i don't like i don't like go hey i'm gonna study this and then go search everywhere brother ram said traps and just come back with a whole list of quotes that's just not me i get down and pray and spend hours in that room today down on my knees pray and say lord what do you want to say the holy spirit says what about this and what about this and what about this and i was thinking about this and i when i was just thinking about this poisoning how that those are traps we see so many people they're not dead maybe even still come to church but they're poisoned in their spirit and they just don't function they can't raise their hands they can't worship god they don't have a testimony and they've just got poison in their system and i was thinking about this brother man says listen god's provided way in 1965 he said and now we've come right straight back again here we sit this afternoon on the west coast he said where the sin barrier of all the powers of darkness heaps in here and and these movies listen to me we're talking about poison in a christian's life and these movies and television cast and these men kissing women on there and poisoning the minds of little girls and now the prophet is saying yeah there's these traps and there's this poison you put in your mind how's it get in there through your eyes the eyes are the gate to the soul and the prophet god said you're looking at that and it's putting poison down in your soul he said did you know that a man that potentially he's all right if i just read it you know if i read it it's not me it's him that was my friend the other day they were talking about him being a racist he said hey i was just quoting the prophet you know if you want to call the prophet a racist you know i was just reading him he said did you know any man that kisses a woman is morally obligated to marry her potentially it's a sex sex act sure it is yes it is what is it it's male glands and a in a man's lip and a female glands when a male and female glands comes together it's sex he said look on hollywood and look at these little girls laying out here in the parks and boys wallering around over here and these girls and things like that and even singing in the choirs now the problem of god is talking about the kissing and all this wallering around and then they want to get up on the stage and they want to sing oh my we can't let that happen the prophet of god is condemning that but then you can't let that happen that's right we can't let that happen we gotta hey man let right be right and let wrong be wrong is that okay i'm just reading it right here out and he said and look at hollywood and these little girls laying out here in the parks and boys walking around looking like and these elvis presleys and so far that we have today it's a disgrace to the name of of america to what our forefathers fought and bled and died for and so i say that to say now the prophet is talking about poisoning social media wasn't even around facebook and twitter and instagram and all the other uh things you know it's like they were talking about the jebusites and the hittites and the amorites and all those when they forgot one more that's real big in our day is the websites the websites those are some giants are probably greater than the hittites and the amorites and the jebusites is the websites amen we need to take the word of god and destroy those enemies before they destroy us destroy our family brother ram said the television sent our women to the dogs and men go off to work and then they let their wife sit home and just watch all these things where they minimize the man make him nothing but a mouse and he's a no good thing you know and hey you're the rule of the house and like what man would let his wife sit home with that nonsense knowing that that could tear the very heart of his marriage out may god help us to apply the token and we see those poisons and sports and gossip and and shooting and killing one another and and hollywood and music and poisoning the minds and we've dealt with with young people like hey brother dan you need to get a grip you know brother ramsay i know he said the kisses at the first kisses at the altar but hey man this is 20 21 that doesn't happen well you're right in your world it maybe doesn't happen when you're poisoning your mind listen to the love songs and the music and i remember the one day i was in a bathroom and they were playing i heard that song come over i kissed the girl and i liked it it was a girl said i kissed a girl and i liked it i thought yeah what filth no you'll never attain to what the prophet of god said when we're living in that poison in our mind but i tell you what we need to get in with the holy ghost because there's something about poison if you take poison if you ingest enough good things are you listening to me it pushes all the bad things out and how paul say let the mind that was in christ let it be inside of you say brother daniel i've gone down that road the devil's got me trapped and i went over that's okay now let the mind that was in christ let it be in you say lord i want your mind i want true holiness i want righteousness blessed be the name of the lord amen brother ram got in a trap with his mother-in-law that's a good trap family trap remember he went up to mishawaka and he heard him and they had him preach and he went back got all these invitations here's malachi 4 and the pentecostals goes back to his mother and you know mother-in-law says look billy i'm just paraphrasing so he said look billy you need to get back down there and get some sense and pastor your church so you can get enough money to get a parsonage for my daughter brother graham said i listened to her and i went back down and went back to work and it was god calling him to start his ministry because and you know in 1933 the angel of the lord appeared on the river and said it's john the baptist for when my first coming you will forerun my second coming so now here's this great gateway and now his mother-in-law says don't do it and she traps him how many of us are trapped a family member put you in the trap why it was her mother-in-law's expectations oh i wanted this my point grandma i don't want to just i tell you what there's one we gotta please and that's the lord jesus christ i have my office at work and i got a little office beside it and i got a little thing that's on the wall it says there's one man that i got to please and that's jesus christ i want to hear those words enter thou into the joy faith you've been faithful over a few things i'll make you a ruler over many things i want to hear that from my savior i was just thinking today we were listening a little story on the tape of brother branham brother random when he went to cincinnati and he went to the zoo and he saw that eagle in there he loved eagles and he saw that eagle who was trapped in that cage a man-made cage and somebody had trapped this eagle and they put him in there brother rams looking at it and it's running and hitting the bars and falling down and he said all the feathers were gone off its head and he was rolling its big eyes up to the heavens like this looking around i was listening to it tonight brother and i said if i had a hacksaw i'd hack sawed all the bars off that thing and let the eagle out and he said there was that eagle that once flew in the heavens and now he's in this trap and he's beating his brains out trying to get back to where he was brother ham said the holy spirit began to deal with him and said well that was a very pitiful sight but what about sons and daughters of god that were made in the image of god once roamed the heavenly and come to church and raised their wings and loved god and the tears run down their cheeks and they were free to love god and the devil somewhere trapped them in a trap and got them bound somewhere maybe some people are bound by cigarettes or drugs or alcohol see a man made in the image of god to to be a son of god to have dominion god created man that have dominion over the earth and now they're bound by some little habit they can't even couldn't get away from it it's like sometimes even we get addicted to different things like i'm not addicted i just can't live without it you're addicted to it if it takes you away from your real purpose then get away from that thing move away from that say lord let me be a real christian and love you and serve you with all of my heart and see people that and you know them and i know them and here they are their life once had a testimony for the lord sing a special and had a testimony like our sisters up there and testify tonight about the grace of god and now they're wallowing out somewhere in the world it's a shame isn't it that god never wanted us to be like that he wanted us to be free i was thinking about the story of johnny crow and that little crow and they had somewhere they caught this crow and they put a little tether on his leg so every year the crows would fly south in the winter they'd fly and he said johnny crow come with us come with us he tried to fly and his leg was tethered to the thing he said i can't come i'm tethered up tell her every year same thing johnny crow come on we're flying south no i can't go i'm tethered to this one day there was a farmer came by and he clipped the tether off of him johnny crow just sit there for a little bit all the crows go johnny crow come on come on let's fly south let's fly so i said no no i'm tethered i'm tyler he was loose but in his mind he was always bound he couldn't get past his bondage and i tell you that's what's happened to a lot of people i was thinking about the verses john 8 36 that he that the son sets free he's free when christ cried it is finished on calvary he paid for every one of the freedoms of your soul you could no longer didn't have to be bound by the the devil and his his hold on your life you don't i remember as a young boy going to bed and just laying and filling my pillow up with tears because i was so lost and i wanted to be saved there was something inside of me brother aaron i wanted to love god i wanted to serve god but the devil had me in a trap i think brother bam said that i don't know what messages it is he said when i was a 12 year old boy he said the reason i didn't receive the holy spirit there was a little devil that hung over me a little dark cloud that said don't do it now just wait a little longer he talks about the preaching of the gospel it casts that little dark cloud away from you maybe you've never been baptized in jesus name the devil said i'll just wave that's a bunch of hocus pocus but tonight when a preaching gospel it casts that little cloud away from you go back and read matthew or mark chapter 16 the bible says he that believeth and is baptized will be saved and he that believeth not will be damned and then you sit there and we stop being kids and we start growing up and being adults and realize you know if i'm baptized the bible says and i believe i'm going to be saved but if i don't he that believeth not is damned and there's only one place for the damned and that's to go to the devil's hell what's john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him would not perish but had everlasting life for the son of man came not into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and this is the condemnation good verses isn't it brother john johnson amen this is the condemnation that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil they're evil in their heart but i'm so thankful that he came to save i'm one i want to be saved how do you tell timothy he said you how'd he say you you'll know the scriptures which are able to bring salvation to you somewhere we've got to have the gospel of jesus christ in every sermon that we preach we've got to have the death burial and resurrection jesus walked that road to calvary and every one of us every young boy every adult we have to have that day on calvary we realize we're a sinner lord i don't want to be a sinner i got my sins lord jesus forgive me and christ comes and forgives us of our sin and not just a profession but a quickening of the holy spirit that gives you power to live a life above sin that's what's lacking around our message we've got too many people that are professing i was listening to brother branham because i listen to him in the morning when i'm getting ready getting getting up and before i fill my mind with all the garbage of the world and just stuff of the world in business fill your mind with the prophet he's speaking he said billy graham and oral roberts they come to our city specifically he's talking about billy graham he said he has his conversion he said only 10 of them last only 10 because it's just a confession he said every confession is a stone he said but it takes a real stone mason to cut that confession out and say this is what you should be confessing jesus christ and the power of the holy spirit of the word to make you live and overcoming life that's what's lacking around our message it's the holy spirit to fill our lives that somebody have a real experience with god some of you know what i'm talking about say i've had an experience with god i know it's held me through the years obviously i don't know i'm just pushed from this way and i go from this trap to this trap amen how do what jesus said when he the holy spirit has come he'll lead and guide you into all truth say lord i don't want to get caught in traps i tell you we sit with young people we sat with him last night man beautiful young people eyes crystal clear and talents and abilities and i know sister heather's worked with young people through the years and and helping and sister elizabeth help him at the sunday school and and you know you sit with them and and then the devil comes and he throws these traps and pretty soon the devil throws his trap and makes someone less than the intended position that god has for that young lady god help us john 8 32 you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and one of my favorite verses john 10 10 you know we always rate things by 10 i was about a 2 but you remember this when jesus rates it like 10 10 john 10 10 that's a 10 and that's a 10. and he said the thief cometh not but for to steal kill and destroy and jesus said but i have come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly and that's what i believe john 10 10 it's abundant life it's just not i got eternal life and it's a terrible thing i ever wish i'd never even dropped in that church it's terrible but i get to go to that's not what jesus wanted you to have he said i come that you might have life and you can have it more abundantly it's better than any life the world can give you out there blessed be the name of the lord it's life and you know i was thinking about that with those traps if you're in a trap and you want to be free the first thing you got to have a desire and want to be free brother talks about that people having cigarettes and smoking cigarettes and say they oh they want to be but they don't have a they really don't want to be free i find that without like a pity spirit sometimes you see people they're going through deep things in their life and they really but they really don't want to be delivered because their pity spirit is what gives them value and they can tell that story and then everybody rather than just saying hey god deliver me and look at the power of god and the testimony that i have where he's brought me from the pithy and hallelujah look at me today loving god and laying my hands on the sick and recovering and ministering to anybody but they want to stay back and in 20 years you meet them later and they're back at that i say god let us move out of that trap and let god fill us with the holy ghost and let's grow i want to grow i want to move on with god from wherever i am today as i said the other day i'm not the man i used to be i made some mistakes yesterday but i'm not that man can you say amen to that or maybe you need to say lord forgive me i'm not that woman that i used to be i made mistakes back there blessed be the name of the lord amen a few musicians will come jesus had the solution he said watch and pray that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things i say all these traps are trying to get you off that off that path to the rapture we were talking about the other day and i want to go back to our original text because in psalms 91 it says and he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler oh it's such an anchor brother aaron and i know i've been in traps in my life but i have a promise psalms 91 that he said he would deliver me from the snare of the hunter there's something about a son and daughter of god and say lord i'm going through this life i'm doing the best that i can if the devil traps me in a snare god you'll send that screaming preacher from indiana you'll go up there and scream and holler and scream and i'll realize yes i'm in a trap but the bible says there's a promise that he would deliver us from the hunter say brother daniel i haven't moved in a long time but i want to move tonight maybe it's just something in your mind you say you know i'm just i love comedy said and lord all those little knots up in those people's minds i pray that you would just unravel them sometimes we get those little knots in our mind i do and you start and you get well that maybe somebody tells you about somebody and you just like it destroys their character you know you can murder somebody without shooting them with the gun brother ram said you just destroy their character well hey yeah i know them but i i don't you know back they they did this way back and you destroy you murdered that person's character they can't help you and we get these little knots in our mind say lord just unravel that knot just pull it pull it right out lord and let it be straight we need that in our minds i remember one time i was praying just really going through a lot of ministries and this brother and this brother and his brother i was kneeling down and praying and i thought about peter when peter he said to jesus about johnny said what about this man and i was asking the lord lord what about this ministry what about this man i don't understand this lord and the lord spoke to me the same thing he spoke to peter he said what is that to you follow thou me maybe that's the only thing you get out of this message tonight the holy spirit would speak to you like you spoken to peter said what is that to you follow thou me i tell you what i was a changed man i got up from that chair i said lord i can't explain that i can't explain that but what is that to me i'm gonna follow you i'm gonna follow the voice of god that's speaking to me i mean maybe you're sitting here today and the holy spirit's you know speaking to you and the devil's had you bound and he you realize you know what he that the son sets free is free indeed and the lord says what is that to you why don't you just follow me christ the calvary cried his finish he cut the tether off and johnny crow just has to fly away i say we just fly away tonight amen let's pray together heavenly father lord i pray you take this thought that you changed my sermon and brought this thought of traps and snares i pray that you would help us tonight lord each one of us maybe a little pastoral lord to get down where we live and maybe somebody caught off the path and down in a snare that little sheep down in the briar somewhere lord the holy spirit just come down and straighten all those little knots in our minds and unravel it lord we just get back up on the trail and say what is that to you what does it really matter that situation to you why don't you just move on with god may you help us today lord you know what you're speaking lord you said your word would not return void i pray that you would help us today father maybe you're here tonight and the holy spirit's speaking you you'd like to just raise your hand say god's speaking to me today god bless you god bless you god bless you my look at the hands the holy spirit's never wrong god bless you god bless you my brother god bless you god bless you oh my look at the holy spirit traps and snares lord pull me out of this trap lord maybe you're in a trap of sin say lord forgive me pull me out of this trap lord i want to move on and be a christian god bless you god bless you yes amen god hidden and revealed in simplicity lord it's just a little simple sermon but lord let me be lord delivered from this trap of the enemy yes hallelujah lord you see the hands that have been raised responding to the word of god i pray as a church lord that you'd help us to move away from the traps of the devil lord your word psalms 91 says ye would deliver them from the snare of the hunter the snare of the fowler lord deliver us tonight lord we raise our hands to you pray you would help us lord even out streaming lord maybe there's a brother or sister in their home or wherever they are that'll watch this and i pray god lord not as a fancy sermon but the holy spirit is speaking and reaching lord you said the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost maybe we've lost our freedom and the holy ghost we've got a little grudge and we get this little thought in our mind and we're not free anymore lord help us just come away from that trap of the devil lord this little uh definition say those animals will bite their their their limb off so they can be free again lord let us take whatever it takes maybe we got to go back and humble our pride and say i'm sorry i was wrong i did wrong i want you to forgive me and bury our pride that we can be free from that trap lord the other trap is unforgiveness lord it says if you won't forgive your brother his trespasses you're going to be trapped in a trap where your heavenly father doesn't forgive you may you help us tonight lord speak to our hearts let us move closer father as the word says the bride hath made herself ready help us father to make ourselves ready lord i've preached the word now it's in the people's lab father maybe there's someone that's not been baptized we're once little kids and mom and dad made decisions for us but now we're older we're adults we want them to treat us like adults but now we're laid with the responsibility of our own soul we have to make a choice to be baptized or not be baptized we've come to that age where the chemicals have kicked into our bodies and we're not a boy anymore we're becoming a man we're not a little girl anymore we're becoming a woman and with that change of our bodies comes in an age of accountability that we've got to give an account for our soul of right and wrong and our eternal destination i pray holy spirit that you would speak to every heart lord bring your sheep into the place they ought to be lord i pray god fill us with the holy spirit i pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen turn your eyes upon jesus can you i think it's f maybe your eyes upon oh let's stand together just worship him before we
