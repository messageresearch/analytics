[34:46] [Music]

[35:08] scripture ha said out of his belly shall
[35:11] flow rivers of Living Water but this
[35:15] spake he of the spirit which they that
[35:17] believe on him should receive for the
[35:20] Holy Ghost was not yet given because

[35:32] words Lord we pray that this scripture
[35:36] would be
[35:38] manifested in us that are here tonight I
[35:40] ask and father may you be pleased with
[35:43] our service tonight as we move to
[35:46] towards taking the body and the blood of
[35:51] our
[35:52] savior father confess our faults to you

[36:00] father ask for your guidance in Jesus
[36:03] name
[36:04] amen God bless you you can be
[36:09] seated
[36:13] appreciate appreciate the word and the
[36:15] promises that are in the
[36:17] Bible appreciate our service this
[36:20] morning I um I can't say it enough that
[36:24] we've got some really talented musicians
[36:28] we've uh got some
[36:30] great leaders in the church and uh we've
[36:33] got the absolute best people in the
[36:37] church I just love you all I appreciate
[36:40] you all so much one of the
[36:44] questions that always comes to me it
[36:46] seems like I think it's come every
[36:48] time is
[36:51] asking should I take communion or should
[36:54] I not take
[36:55] communion and just a testimony from
[37:00] me is when I
[37:02] was I don't know I I gave my heart to
[37:05] the Lord as was on my 21st
[37:07] birthday
[37:09] and I started I started Living living
[37:12] right but I um I could always see sin in
[37:16] my
[37:17] life and I wouldn't take
[37:21] communion and month would go by and year
[37:25] years would go by and
[37:28] and I would always get down and pray and
[37:30] I'd always see that that there was
[37:32] always something more that I could do or
[37:34] something more than I could make right
[37:36] and what it was is it was the enemy the
[37:40] accuser as I say so often that was there
[37:44] and he was telling me that you've done
[37:47] this wrong and you've done that wrong
[37:50] and what I would fail to do is put those
[37:54] things under the blood of Jesus Christ
[37:57] and when you read these
[37:59] scriptures you see that if we don't
[38:03] partake of this communion then we have
[38:05] no part with Christ but if we take it
[38:08] unworthily then we're guilty of his
[38:14] blood
[38:16] but the Lord knows our heart and we want
[38:19] to serve God we want we want to be a
[38:23] Christian and when it's talking about
[38:25] that person that is guilty of the body
[38:29] and the blood of Christ it's not talking
[38:32] about that person that really has a
[38:33] genuine desire to serve God it's talking
[38:36] about that person that is living two
[38:39] lives and one life is outside of this
[38:43] Gathering here in the world and having
[38:47] no desire to serve God and then showing
[38:50] up here in the church and standing at
[38:53] the communion table and making it an
[38:55] Abomination before God that is the one
[38:58] that should not be taking
[39:01] communion but that person that has a
[39:03] genuine desire in their heart that
[39:06] repents of their
[39:08] sins that's the person that should be
[39:11] standing here and should be taking this
[39:14] bread and taking this
[39:16] wine all of us should be able to look at
[39:20] our lives and see that we have sin in
[39:23] our lives because we
[39:24] do the Apostle Paul I talk about a lot
[39:28] because he is was such a wonderful
[39:32] servant of
[39:33] God he even said I died
[39:36] daily and he even said that I am the
[39:39] chiefest of
[39:41] Sinners so taking this communion no we
[39:45] should be here if there is a desire Upon
[39:49] Our Hearts to serve God there will be
[39:51] sin in our lives and and we're human
[39:54] beings I'm not condoning the sin
[40:00] but the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[40:03] us from those sins so brothers and
[40:06] sisters if there is a desire to come and
[40:09] to take of this body and not just to be
[40:12] part of a group of
[40:14] people but to actually come and make
[40:17] your life right and and to be a part of
[40:21] this then yes you should be
[40:23] coming this communion is a wonderful
[40:26] thing
[40:28] it's it's a
[40:30] fellowship the the
[40:32] unity of the body of Christ I
[40:35] think it is so
[40:38] underestimated we look back in in
[40:40] Genesis
[40:42] 11 when the story of the Tower of
[40:46] Babel the the people they got together
[40:50] let's let's read it brother um brother
[40:52] Jordan if you would put on there um
[40:55] Genesis chapter 11 let's just start with
[40:58] verse
[41:00] one now these are
[41:02] sinners take that into into account
[41:05] these are not people that had a
[41:07] relationship with God and the whole
[41:09] earth was of one language is and of one
[41:12] speech and it came to pass as they
[41:14] journeyed from the East that they found
[41:15] a plane in the land of
[41:18] shinar and they dwelt
[41:21] there and they said one to another go
[41:24] and let us make brick and burn them
[41:26] thoroughly and they had brick for stone
[41:28] and slime they had for Mortar and they
[41:30] said go to let us build us a city and a
[41:34] tower whose top May reach into
[41:38] heaven and let us make us a name lest we
[41:42] be scattered upon the face of the whole
[41:45] earth notice that they're saying that we
[41:47] need to make something that we can stay
[41:50] together because they saw there was such
[41:51] power in
[41:53] unity that they could build this tower
[41:56] that could all go all the way up into
[41:58] heaven and almost reach God and they saw
[42:02] that they were able to do this because
[42:05] they had
[42:08] unity and the earth and the Lord came
[42:11] down to see the city and the tower which
[42:14] the children of men builded and the Lord
[42:17] said behold the people is one they were
[42:20] operating in one unit they could do
[42:25] anything with their unit even as
[42:30] Sinners and they have all one language
[42:33] and this they begin to do and now
[42:35] nothing will be restrained from them
[42:38] which they have imagined to do even God
[42:40] was acknowledging these people were in
[42:43] such Unity that they could do anything
[42:45] that they set their mind
[42:47] to go to let us go down and confound
[42:50] their language that they may not
[42:52] understand one another's speech so the
[42:54] Lord scattered them abroad from then
[42:56] upon the face of the Earth of all the
[42:58] Earth face upon of all the Earth and
[43:00] they left off to build the
[43:04] city therefore is the name of it called
[43:07] Babel because the Lord did there
[43:10] confound the language of all the Earth
[43:12] and from then did the Lord scatter them
[43:15] upon the face of all the Earth what an
[43:18] amazing story they were in such
[43:22] Unity that they could do as the Bible
[43:25] says they could do whatever they said
[43:27] set their mind to and then God comes
[43:29] down I love the way God does things he
[43:32] comes down and he says I'm just G to
[43:35] make it to where they can't
[43:37] communicate I'm G to take I won't say it
[43:41] Facebook away from
[43:44] them as I was saying this morning I'm
[43:47] gonna make it to where they can't talk
[43:49] to each
[43:50] other and then they will fail because
[43:54] they won't work together
[43:57] the old saying United We Stand and
[43:59] divided we fall here is a very very good
[44:04] example of this right at the beginning
[44:05] of the
[44:06] Bible how important Unity is and
[44:11] communion is a very very part very
[44:14] important part of
[44:16] unity
[44:19] Jesus when he had this last
[44:23] supper it's such a such a tragic story
[44:26] that there he was with his with his
[44:28] disciples and and they were all gathered
[44:31] around and and we know the story how
[44:36] Judas he was there and he just couldn't
[44:41] accept this Jesus he didn't like certain
[44:44] things that he was doing
[44:47] so Judas goes Jesus sends him away Judas
[44:51] goes to to betray Jesus and then Jesus
[44:54] has all of his disciples around him and
[44:58] and there was just such a sadness upon
[45:02] him and he washes their feet and and and
[45:05] he breaks the bread and he he he uh he
[45:10] gives it to them while Judas is there
[45:12] and then they take the wine and and it
[45:15] was just such a solemn
[45:17] time and he says do this in remembrance
[45:20] of me he knew he was going what a what a
[45:23] sweet thing to say imagine if a love one
[45:27] a dear loved one told you that I'm
[45:31] leaving but would you do
[45:34] something that will make you remember me
[45:38] and this is this is the god of Heaven
[45:40] that was made flesh and he said that to
[45:43] these these beloved his best friends the
[45:46] people that he loved the
[45:48] most so they he says well let let's get
[45:52] up and and let's
[45:53] go Jesus knew what was going to happen
[45:56] so they go and they walk
[45:58] down the side of the mountain there and
[46:00] they're they're going down to the foot
[46:02] of the Mountain at the the Mount of
[46:04] Olives and Jesus preaches them a message
[46:06] and he he keeps telling them love one
[46:09] another this is right after
[46:11] communion he's saying love one another
[46:14] serve one another he says by this all
[46:17] men will know that you are my disciples
[46:20] that you're my people because of how
[46:22] much you love one
[46:24] another he gets down to the bottom
[46:26] bottom of the mountain after this sermon
[46:29] and they get to this famous place called
[46:31] The Garden of
[46:33] Gethsemane and
[46:36] Jesus you know how we close in prayer
[46:39] when we have a service Jesus closes in
[46:42] prayer in John chapter
[46:45] 17 and he says this John chapter
[46:49] 17:9 he says I pray for
[46:52] them he says I pray not for the world
[46:55] but for them which thou Hast given me
[46:57] for they are mine they are thine and all
[47:01] mine are thine and thine are mine and I
[47:04] am glorified in them and now I am come
[47:07] no more in the world but these are in
[47:10] the world and I come to thee Holy Father
[47:14] keep through thine own name Those whom
[47:17] thou Hast given me that they may be one
[47:20] as we are one he is
[47:22] leaving his dear friends right there and
[47:26] he's praying for them and he says while
[47:28] I was with them in the world I kept them
[47:31] in thy name those that thou gavest me I
[47:34] have kept and none of them is lost but
[47:36] the son of predition that the scripture
[47:38] might be fulfilled he had just left to
[47:41] go to get the authorities to betray
[47:44] Jesus and now come I to thee and these
[47:48] things I speak in the world that they
[47:51] might have my joy fulfilled in
[47:54] themselves they had no idea going to
[47:57] just say what that Joy
[47:59] was I have given them Thy word and the
[48:03] word hath hated them and the world hath
[48:06] hated them because they are not of the
[48:09] world even as I am not of the world I
[48:12] pray not that thou should us take them
[48:15] out of the world but that thou should us
[48:18] keep them from Evil if he would have
[48:21] taken them out of the world brother
[48:23] Aaron then the gospel wouldn't have
[48:26] spread
[48:27] he didn't want to take them out of that
[48:29] that awful place he wanted to leave them
[48:32] there so that they might spread the
[48:35] gospel to
[48:37] others they are not of the world even as
[48:41] I am not of the world sanctify them
[48:45] through thy truth Thy word is
[48:48] truth as thou Hast sent me into the
[48:51] world even so have I also sent them into
[48:54] the world and for their s sakes I
[48:57] sanctify
[48:59] myself that they also might be
[49:01] Sanctified through the through the
[49:04] truth neither pray I think about that
[49:08] right just what he said that I sanctify
[49:11] myself for their sakes he lived this
[49:13] perfect
[49:15] life for them he could have had a wife
[49:19] he could have had children he could have
[49:21] had a
[49:22] career there was one time he said the
[49:24] fox have have dens and the birds have n
[49:27] but the son of man doesn't even have a
[49:29] place to lay his head tonight I don't
[49:31] even have a
[49:32] home and he did it for his
[49:37] friends as thou Hast sent me into the
[49:39] world even so I send them into the world
[49:41] and for their sakes I sanctify myself
[49:44] that they also might be Sanctified
[49:46] through the truth neither pray I for
[49:47] these alone but for them also which
[49:50] Shall Believe on me through their word
[49:55] this is the disciples word word this is
[49:58] Matthew Mark Luke and John this is acts
[50:01] this is all of Paul's writings this is
[50:03] Jude this is James this these are the
[50:07] writings that have been recorded and
[50:10] then we read those and we give our
[50:13] hearts to the Lord and we are the
[50:15] Fulfillment of this scripture right
[50:19] here that
[50:24] they he's very
[50:29] important he's not just praying for
[50:31] these 11 men with him he's also praying
[50:35] for all of us that will hear as he said
[50:40] the gospel through them that they may
[50:43] that they all may be one as thou father
[50:46] art in me and I in thee that they also
[50:50] may be one in us that the world may
[50:54] believe that thou has sent me and the
[50:57] glory which thou gavest me I have given
[51:00] them that they may be one even as we are
[51:04] one what a statement there so there is
[51:07] Jesus and he's praying all of his
[51:09] disciples are around him and he's
[51:10] praying he's saying Lord let these
[51:13] disciples that are here let them be one
[51:17] perfectly one just like you father and I
[51:21] am are
[51:22] one that's
[51:25] close that's us we're coming to the
[51:28] communion table
[51:30] tonight he was praying let's just narrow
[51:33] this all the way down to
[51:35] 2024 Cinco
[51:38] Mayo narrow it down right
[51:42] now this room he prayed that we would be
[51:47] so
[51:49] close just as he and the father are that
[51:52] close think about that do you know
[51:56] brother Rome can you tell the difference
[51:59] between the father and the son it's
[52:00] pretty hard huh yeah the the the godhead
[52:04] is something that it's very hard to
[52:06] separate the father and the son they're
[52:08] just so perfectly one that when we pray
[52:12] we say Lord Jesus or we say heavenly
[52:14] father they are that
[52:17] close to where we can't even hardly
[52:19] distinguish them and he said he wants us
[52:23] to be that close wow that's close close
[52:27] that's
[52:28] loving that's a closeit group and it's
[52:32] for a
[52:37] purpose i in
[52:40] them and thou in me that they may be
[52:45] made perfect in
[52:48] one and that the world may know that
[52:51] thou Hast sent me and Hast loved me as
[52:53] thou Hast loved me he's saying again
[52:56] he's saying that this Perfection this
[52:58] this perfectness will come through their
[53:02] Oneness and not only
[53:04] that he says that they will love so each
[53:08] other so much they will be so close that
[53:10] the very world will know that I am the
[53:13] Messiah that I am the savior because the
[53:16] Tucson Tabernacle loves each other so
[53:18] much WoW put it right down
[53:23] here that there should be converts
[53:27] coming here because they see how much we
[53:31] love each other it's written in the
[53:34] book that's how close we should
[53:37] be
[53:39] father I will that they also whom thou
[53:42] Hast given me be with me where I
[53:47] am how sweet Lord my my my
[53:52] desire is that my people these people
[53:54] that I love Lord I know where where I'm
[53:57] going and I want them to be with me
[54:00] heaven just wouldn't be the same maybe
[54:02] without him I want to take these people
[54:05] with
[54:06] me that they may be with me where I am
[54:09] that they may behold my glory which thou
[54:13] Hast given me for thou lovest me before
[54:15] the foundation of the world this is
[54:17] Christ's prayer for us that we would be
[54:20] with him wherever he is it's a beautiful
[54:23] love
[54:24] story between a bridegroom and a bride
[54:29] and how much this bridegroom loves his
[54:32] sweetheart no matter where he goes he
[54:35] wants her to be there with
[54:38] him oh righteous father the world hath
[54:42] not known thee but I have known thee and
[54:44] these have known that thou Hast sent me
[54:46] and I have declared unto them thy name
[54:49] and will declare
[54:51] it that the love wherewith thou Hast
[54:54] loved me May may be in
[54:58] them and I in
[55:02] them so this
[55:05] love that the father has placed here
[55:09] Lord let that love be in the Tucson
[55:14] Tabernacle not just a group of people
[55:16] not just Christians throughout the ages
[55:18] but right
[55:20] here let that love be in us it was
[55:23] Jesus's
[55:24] desire and you know what what I don't
[55:26] think he would have prayed it if it
[55:28] couldn't be
[55:30] true I don't believe that I believe that
[55:33] it can
[55:37] be Jesus prayed that for his
[55:41] disciples and then he went he was
[55:44] crucified rose from the
[55:47] dead came
[55:49] back a little bit
[55:52] later and at the day of Pentecost this
[55:56] prayer was about to manifest
[55:59] itself it was about to come true they
[56:01] were all in one Accord they were in one
[56:04] place trouble had driven them together
[56:06] because they were being persecuted as
[56:08] I've said before it's sad but trouble is
[56:12] a good thing persecution is a good thing
[56:16] God wouldn't send it to us if it wasn't
[56:18] for our good if things are always going
[56:21] so great and and everything's so
[56:23] wonderful we see that we don't give God
[56:25] the time
[56:26] and the importance that we should but
[56:28] let me tell you you get sick one
[56:30] time or your son or your daughter gets
[56:34] sick or you have a catastrophe happen
[56:37] like job did you you go to your knees
[56:40] and you cry out to God so many times
[56:45] these trials they come or every time
[56:48] these trials when they come they are for
[56:49] our own good and that's what was
[56:51] happening here with these disciples they
[56:53] were in one place 120 of them in one
[56:55] room
[56:58] and they were
[57:01] praying together with one Accord they
[57:04] had one
[57:06] purpose and that purpose brought that
[57:10] Unity now these are God's people we saw
[57:13] in the Tower of Babel just now those
[57:16] were worldly people that didn't weren't
[57:18] seeking God here we have God's people
[57:21] and watch what the unity present
[57:23] represents what it what it um comes to
[57:26] before it came to a big tower that got
[57:29] that fell down when they couldn't talk
[57:31] to each other
[57:32] here it comes to a great purpose they're
[57:36] together they're in one mind in one
[57:38] Accord they they're praying and then the
[57:41] promise of the Holy Spirit what Jesus
[57:43] told them would happen it comes down
[57:45] upon them and it fills them with the
[57:47] Holy Spirit and it's looking around like
[57:50] like in this room I would look at you
[57:52] sister Debbie and I'd see there's a
[57:53] light over your head
[57:57] like a tongue of fire oh it's over
[57:59] sister hope look at over here it's
[58:00] brother John it's all it's all over
[58:02] there was all of these lights these
[58:04] pillars of fire all through the room and
[58:07] then come down through this room the
[58:10] sound of a wind and rushing through and
[58:13] the power of God was felt and they came
[58:16] up and they started speaking in unknown
[58:19] tongues just just crazy things were
[58:23] happening they went out there and they
[58:25] were no more afraid what brought them
[58:29] together is fear but there was no more
[58:31] fear anymore they had the power of God
[58:34] with them they went out and they started
[58:36] preaching and they were preaching in
[58:37] different dialects and in different
[58:39] languages stuff that they never knew but
[58:42] be like me preaching in Spanish to
[58:43] somebody that didn't that that didn't
[58:45] understand English and people were
[58:48] hearing them in their own dialects in
[58:49] their own
[58:50] tongues Peter and John they're going
[58:52] forth in the power of the Holy Spirit
[58:55] Peter preaches about
[58:57] baptism and they said how do we the
[58:59] people said how do we get this and
[59:01] Peter's like repent and be
[59:04] baptized that's how you go forward so
[59:07] then Peter and John they're walking in
[59:11] to the to the city and they come to the
[59:13] to the gate called beautiful and there
[59:15] is a man that had been lame that had
[59:17] been crippled since he was
[59:21] born they had
[59:23] never this hadn't happened before Jesus
[59:26] Jesus had done
[59:28] it Peter John walking by the man was
[59:33] crippled he's laying there he put out
[59:35] his hand like will you give me a coin so
[59:39] I I make a living I'm crippled I can't I
[59:41] can't do it Peter the Bible says they
[59:45] fastened their eyes on him looked down
[59:48] said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[59:51] what I have I have to you I I give to
[59:54] you right rise up and walk in the name
[59:57] of Jesus Christ and the man jumped
[1:00:00] up started running around and he he he
[1:00:03] was completely healed there was the
[1:00:05] power this is what Jesus was talking
[1:00:08] about and what did it do all these
[1:00:11] people saw it and they started coming to
[1:00:16] Christ because of this miracle and
[1:00:19] because of the tongues and because of
[1:00:21] all of the gifts all of the gifts for
[1:00:23] one thing brothers and sisters they're
[1:00:24] not to glorify us
[1:00:26] right it's to glorify Jesus Christ it's
[1:00:29] to lift up Jesus Christ whether it's
[1:00:31] discernment whether it's prophecy
[1:00:33] whether it's healing whatever it is it
[1:00:36] is to get people to Christ because these
[1:00:39] mortal bodies will get sick again but
[1:00:42] I'll tell you what there is an immortal
[1:00:44] body waiting there is an eternal body
[1:00:46] waiting there's a glorified body waiting
[1:00:49] and that's what we are trying to get
[1:00:52] people to and that's when you get them
[1:00:54] to Christ
[1:00:56] that's the most important and the people
[1:00:58] saw this more and more people were
[1:01:02] coming they saw the disciples going out
[1:01:04] and preaching the
[1:01:07] gospel and the high
[1:01:10] priest always the
[1:01:12] enemy the high priest called them
[1:01:15] in and commanded that they shouldn't
[1:01:18] preach Christ
[1:01:19] anymore this wasn't lining up with their
[1:01:23] way and the man who was healed was
[1:01:25] standing right right there with
[1:01:27] them and they couldn't say anything
[1:01:29] about it everybody knew that guy he was
[1:01:32] born like that he always stayed there
[1:01:34] the the Pharisees walked by him the
[1:01:36] Sadducees walked by him every morning on
[1:01:38] the way to the temple it's like oh
[1:01:39] that's
[1:01:42] Jose and give him some money and you
[1:01:45] know get some money but now he's walking
[1:01:50] around because they now they couldn't
[1:01:53] say anything about it all they knew was
[1:01:56] that this man was born that way and now
[1:01:58] he's different acts 4:
[1:02:03] 7 Sanhedrin brings them together and
[1:02:05] when they had set them in the midst they
[1:02:07] asked by what power or by what name have
[1:02:09] you done this then Peter filled with the
[1:02:11] Holy Ghost said unto them you rulers of
[1:02:13] the people and Elders of Israel if we
[1:02:15] this day be examined of the good deed
[1:02:17] done to the impotent Man by what means
[1:02:19] he is made whole be it known unto you
[1:02:22] all and to all the people of Israel that
[1:02:25] by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:02:27] whom you crucified whom God raised from
[1:02:30] the dead even by him doth this man stand
[1:02:34] here before you whole amen that's bold
[1:02:38] before he was cutting people's ear ears
[1:02:41] off and running away and cussing and
[1:02:43] trying to separate him from Jesus now
[1:02:45] things change when you receive the holy
[1:02:50] spirit this is the stone which was set
[1:02:53] at not of you Builders which is become
[1:02:56] the head of the corner neither is there
[1:02:58] salvation in any other for there is none
[1:03:01] other name under Heaven given among men
[1:03:04] whereby we must be
[1:03:05] saved the priests and the rulers they
[1:03:07] got
[1:03:09] together and they admitted that there
[1:03:12] was a genuine miracle
[1:03:15] done but they held to
[1:03:19] their
[1:03:20] religion more than when God was
[1:03:24] manifested right in their eyes
[1:03:27] the best that they could do was they
[1:03:28] commanded them not to preach Christ
[1:03:30] anymore and they threatened them and
[1:03:32] they let let them go but Peter and John
[1:03:35] answered them they said what's
[1:03:38] right they said should we listen to
[1:03:41] God or should we listen to
[1:03:43] you you
[1:03:47] judge
[1:03:49] well and then he says we can't
[1:03:53] speak but the we can't speak the things
[1:03:57] we cannot but speak the things which we
[1:03:59] have seen and
[1:04:00] heard down to verse
[1:04:03] 23 and being let go they went to their
[1:04:06] own company and reported all that the
[1:04:09] chief priests and Elders had said unto
[1:04:11] them look at the unity
[1:04:13] now and when they heard that they lifted
[1:04:16] up their voice to God with one Accord
[1:04:19] and said Lord Thou Art God which H has
[1:04:21] made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and
[1:04:24] all that that in them is look at the
[1:04:27] unity we don't even know who's
[1:04:30] talking it doesn't say it's Peter it
[1:04:33] doesn't say it's John it says they said
[1:04:38] they were in such Unity that we don't
[1:04:41] even know who's speaking right here
[1:04:44] let's skip to verse
[1:04:46] 29 and they're praying and now Lord
[1:04:49] behold their threatenings and Grant unto
[1:04:51] thy servants that with all boldness they
[1:04:54] may speak Thy Word by stretching forth
[1:04:56] thy hand to heal and that signs and
[1:04:59] wonders may be done by the name of the
[1:05:01] holy of thy H holy Child Jesus and when
[1:05:04] they had prayed the place was shaken
[1:05:07] where they were assembled together and
[1:05:09] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:13] and they spake the word of God with
[1:05:16] boldness and the multitude of them that
[1:05:18] believed were of one heart and of one
[1:05:23] Soul that's exactly what what the Lord
[1:05:26] prayed
[1:05:27] for they were of one heart they were of
[1:05:30] one Soul neither said any of them ought
[1:05:33] of the things which he possessed was his
[1:05:34] own but they had all things in common
[1:05:37] and with great power gave the apostles
[1:05:39] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[1:05:41] Jesus and great grace was upon them all
[1:05:44] why because they loved one
[1:05:46] another because they were in unity with
[1:05:49] one another they were fulfilling what
[1:05:52] Jesus prayed for and that prayer was was
[1:05:56] not just for them Jesus said it's to all
[1:05:59] the
[1:05:59] people that have received the witness
[1:06:03] even through them it wasn't just for
[1:06:07] them this is the unity brothers and
[1:06:09] sisters this is what communion
[1:06:13] represents is a unified Body of
[1:06:18] Christ that we are
[1:06:20] together that we love one
[1:06:23] another the age John
[1:06:26] in his Epistles 1 John 2 John third John
[1:06:29] he says over and over little children
[1:06:31] love one
[1:06:33] another he wasn't going into all these
[1:06:35] deep doctrines and all all of these
[1:06:37] Grand things he was just saying just
[1:06:39] love one another because look what love
[1:06:42] produces it produces
[1:06:45] healing it produces power it produces
[1:06:50] Unity that these disciples would love
[1:06:53] one another and I believe brothers and
[1:06:56] sisters I believe he was talking to the
[1:06:57] Tucson
[1:06:59] Tabernacle I really
[1:07:03] do remember don't look
[1:07:06] back don't look at a time that's gone
[1:07:09] past don't say oh well this was just
[1:07:11] fulfilled at the day of Acts and the and
[1:07:14] and the day of Miracles is over and God
[1:07:16] doesn't do those things anymore yes he
[1:07:20] does this was not just for yesterday
[1:07:23] this is for now amen we can't look
[1:07:27] back look to right now and say Lord what
[1:07:30] do you require of me I want love I want
[1:07:34] Unity I want what they had and if we
[1:07:37] have it here in Acts chapter 4 the whole
[1:07:39] church was shaken by the power of God
[1:07:43] because they are of one heart and one
[1:07:46] Soul how beautiful and that's
[1:07:50] communion they were breaking bread when
[1:07:52] they came
[1:07:54] together and it
[1:07:56] represents the body and the blood of
[1:08:00] Jesus
[1:08:02] Christ you're too
[1:08:05] quiet that was a good story and it's the
[1:08:08] best part about it is it's
[1:08:11] real it's written in the Bible yes how
[1:08:15] much does the Lord love us and how good
[1:08:17] is he to us and it was his prayer before
[1:08:19] he left it was his prayer Lord let them
[1:08:22] be one as we are one seem
[1:08:27] loving a group of people that love one
[1:08:31] another that serve one another that pray
[1:08:33] for one another remember when Peter when
[1:08:36] he was
[1:08:37] arrested prayer was made without
[1:08:40] ceasing there was always someone praying
[1:08:42] for Peter and the Lord sent an
[1:08:45] angel and brought him out of prison and
[1:08:48] brought him
[1:08:49] home and that's the kind of church that
[1:08:52] we
[1:08:53] need I want it
[1:08:56] yeah and it's a promise it's a prayer
[1:09:00] from Jesus Christ himself so I can take
[1:09:03] it as a
[1:09:04] promise and if we keep moving towards
[1:09:07] that if we keep looking towards that
[1:09:09] then I believe that God will honor it
[1:09:12] but there's a reason that he says pray
[1:09:14] for one another love one another you
[1:09:17] know what that
[1:09:19] means it means pray for one
[1:09:22] another it doesn't mean talking about it
[1:09:25] w it doesn't mean saying oh I'll pray
[1:09:27] for you and then not
[1:09:30] praying it doesn't mean the preacher up
[1:09:33] there talking about it and then it not
[1:09:38] happening it means that we have to do
[1:09:41] it get on our knees and pray for one
[1:09:47] another and have patience with one
[1:09:49] another we all make
[1:09:52] mistakes let it go it's all right amen
[1:09:56] when the person that doesn't make
[1:09:59] mistakes when you condemn somebody I'll
[1:10:02] say it's okay no I won't even say then
[1:10:04] but there's none of us that don't make
[1:10:06] mistakes the one that never did make
[1:10:09] mistakes is the one that doesn't condemn
[1:10:11] wow he's the one that is an advocate and
[1:10:15] all of us that make mistakes we're the
[1:10:17] ones that condemn so let's not do it
[1:10:21] let's not do it let's pray one for
[1:10:24] another and when when we come up here
[1:10:27] for this communion
[1:10:29] service let's go on behalf of each
[1:10:32] other the Bible says that there is
[1:10:34] healing in the cup or I don't know if
[1:10:37] the Bible said that I think brother
[1:10:38] brandom said that that there is healing
[1:10:40] in the cup there's healing there because
[1:10:43] it's people it's Believers coming
[1:10:46] together why would there not be
[1:10:48] healing if Believers come together there
[1:10:51] should always be healing there should
[1:10:53] always be the supernatural when
[1:10:55] Believers come together and when we come
[1:10:57] together and take this bread and take
[1:11:00] this wine it should be a super natural
[1:11:05] experience and not just going through
[1:11:07] the
[1:11:10] motions so now brothers and sisters as
[1:11:15] as we approach the communion
[1:11:18] service if the musicians would would
[1:11:22] come maybe we could play um
[1:11:26] sister who's playing sister Martha um if
[1:11:30] we could just maybe play some soft
[1:11:34] music
[1:11:36] and as you were preparing to come and
[1:11:41] take this
[1:11:42] communion brothers and sisters don't
[1:11:44] always worry about
[1:11:46] yourself there's going to be sin in your
[1:11:50] life all of us have it it's not right
[1:11:54] but we should be make a commitment to to
[1:11:57] get rid of it but as you come for this
[1:12:00] communion do as the Lord Jesus said and
[1:12:02] carry one for another pray one for
[1:12:07] another so now if we could just have
[1:12:11] maybe a couple
[1:12:12] minutes of silent meditation and
[1:12:17] prayer that we each are
[1:12:22] ready and then pray brother and sisters
[1:12:25] for your brothers and
[1:12:27] sisters pray for those that are in this
[1:12:29] building right now pray for those that
[1:12:30] aren't in this building that are members
[1:12:32] of this body go before the Lord for them
[1:12:36] for just these next few minutes

[1:15:47] amen the brothers would come
[1:15:51] forward to serve the communion
[1:15:55] remember I
[1:15:57] forgot
[1:15:59] okay and
[1:16:04] remember that as this bread is passed
[1:16:09] before you brothers and sisters remember
[1:16:11] what it
[1:16:13] represents it represents a broken body
[1:16:16] that was broken that was beaten that was
[1:16:20] nailed to the cross for
[1:16:23] me for you personally and individually
[1:16:28] as you take that broken P piece of bread
[1:16:32] think about that body that was broken
[1:16:35] for you and as you take that wine think
[1:16:38] about that blood that was shed on this
[1:16:41] cross that dripped down onto the ground
[1:16:45] for you and for
[1:16:49] me let those thoughts go through your
[1:16:52] mind
[1:16:55] 1 Corinthians chap
[1:16:56] [Music]
[1:16:58] 11 verse 23 reads like
[1:17:01] this for I have received of the Lord
[1:17:04] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:17:06] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:17:08] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:17:10] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:17:13] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:17:16] broken for you do this in remembrance of
[1:17:19] me after the same manner also he took
[1:17:21] the cup and when he had SED saying this
[1:17:24] cup is the new Testament in my blood
[1:17:27] this do ye as off as you drink it in
[1:17:29] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:17:33] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:17:35] now show the Lord's you do show the
[1:17:37] Lord's death until he
[1:17:41] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:17:44] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:17:46] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:17:49] and the blood of the
[1:17:50] Lord but let a man examine himself
[1:17:55] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:17:57] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:18:00] drinketh unworth worthily eateth and
[1:18:02] drinking drinketh damnation to himself
[1:18:04] not Discerning the Lord's body but
[1:18:06] notice in chapter in verse 28 it says
[1:18:10] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:18:12] eat of that
[1:18:13] bread and drink of that
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:17] cup he is telling us that we need to do
[1:18:23] this I'll read it again for he that
[1:18:25] eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth
[1:18:27] and drinketh Damnation to himself not
[1:18:29] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:18:31] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:18:33] and many
[1:18:34] sleep for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:18:37] should not be
[1:18:40] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:18:43] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:18:45] be condemned with the world
[1:18:49] [Music]
[1:19:01] [Music]

[1:30:00] brothers and sisters the the rest of

[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:30] tonight
[1:30:33] because of the
[1:30:35] construction we are not going to have
[1:30:37] feet
[1:30:39] washing but I would like to encourage
[1:30:41] the
[1:30:42] congregation to remember that feet
[1:30:45] washing is an act of
[1:30:47] service and let's not
[1:30:50] just we won't do it tonight but
[1:30:54] let's
[1:30:56] make
[1:30:58] this our
[1:31:00] lives that we are constantly washing the
[1:31:03] feet of the saints that we are
[1:31:05] constantly serving each other and I
[1:31:07] think it's it was on my heart to to
[1:31:10] preach on on Unity of the body and I
[1:31:13] think it's it's the Lord's will that
[1:31:16] we're not able to have feet washing
[1:31:17] because of the construction
[1:31:19] tonight but let the Lord magnify it in
[1:31:22] our lives let it be more
[1:31:26] service than it would normally be in in
[1:31:30] just washing feet brother Ron Glide well
[1:31:32] if you come and
[1:31:33] close let's serve one
[1:31:38] another I will go ahead and I will read
[1:31:41] the read the scriptures St John 13:2 it
[1:31:44] says this and supper being ended the
[1:31:46] devil having now put into the heart of
[1:31:48] Judas is Carrot Simon's son to betray
[1:31:50] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:31:52] given all things into his hands and that
[1:31:55] he was come from God and went to God he
[1:31:58] riseth from supper and laid aside his
[1:32:00] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:32:02] himself and after that he poured water
[1:32:05] into a basin and began to wash the
[1:32:07] disciples feet and to wipe them with a
[1:32:09] towel wherewith he was girded then
[1:32:12] cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith
[1:32:15] unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet
[1:32:18] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:32:20] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[1:32:23] know
[1:32:25] Hereafter Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt
[1:32:28] never wash my feet Jesus answered him if
[1:32:31] I wash thee not thou H has no part with
[1:32:34] me I love Peter's response Simon Peter
[1:32:39] saith unto him Lord not my feet only but
[1:32:42] also my hands and my head Jesus saith to
[1:32:46] him he that is washed neth not save to
[1:32:50] wash his feet but is clean every wit and
[1:32:53] ye are clean clean but not all for he
[1:32:55] knew who should betray him therefore
[1:32:58] said he ye are not all clean so after he
[1:33:01] had washed their feet and had taken his
[1:33:04] garments and was set down
[1:33:08] again he said unto them know ye what I
[1:33:13] have done to
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:19] you you call me master and Lord and you
[1:33:23] say well for so am so I am if I then
[1:33:27] your Lord and Master have washed your
[1:33:29] feet ye also ought to wash one another's
[1:33:33] feet for I have given you an example
[1:33:36] that you should do as I have done to you
[1:33:39] verily verily I say unto you the servant
[1:33:42] is not greater than his Lord neither he
[1:33:46] that is sent greater than he that sent
[1:33:49] him if ye know these things happy are ye
[1:33:53] if you do that how many people brothers
[1:33:57] and sisters tonight are happy that we're
[1:33:59] able to take
[1:34:02] communion I'm happy I think once again
[1:34:05] we have fulfilled another scripture
[1:34:07] another prophecy that our lord Jesus had
[1:34:10] set before us brother Ron if you would
[1:34:13] come
[1:34:15] [Music]
[1:34:29] could we all just
[1:34:30] pray oh God we're so grateful that we
[1:34:34] can obey your word father is in the Old
[1:34:37] Testament they they found a a place
[1:34:39] where they had not been obeying and they
[1:34:41] were so glad Lord so father this is just
[1:34:44] one thing we do but we come
[1:34:47] sincerely and oh God you know my heart
[1:34:49] I'm trembling for Lord this is a a Time
[1:34:53] of of seriousness before you but Lord
[1:34:57] there's such blessing in all all of this
[1:35:00] Lord I remember when I was about 14
[1:35:03] father that I truly there was a group
[1:35:06] that that you fell in love Lord that it
[1:35:09] was just it's unspeakable your love and
[1:35:12] I would pray that my heart Lord that
[1:35:15] each and every one of these lovely
[1:35:16] saints of God that they have not
[1:35:19] experienced that infilling of your love
[1:35:22] that they would that Lord they would not
[1:35:24] sleep night or day until they have
[1:35:27] satisfied their souls that they know
[1:35:29] they have met you amen oh God if there's
[1:35:31] one here Lord that would have any
[1:35:33] contempt in their heart against another
[1:35:35] maybe confess that but I believe they
[1:35:37] have oh Lord there's no big eyes and
[1:35:41] little you Lord but I pray Lord that
[1:35:43] each and everyone here tonight would
[1:35:46] just take advantage of this time to lay
[1:35:48] aside Lord to put investments in their
