[27:13] Lord God we thank you for another
[27:14] opportunity
[27:16] to come together
[27:18] in the name above all names the name of
[27:20] Jesus Christ
[27:22] and Lord as we open this Bible tonight
[27:24] in this Bible study we pray that
[27:27] that you'd be with us
[27:29] and father that we would leave here
[27:31] tonight better people than when we came
[27:34] Lord that the Holy Spirit would be here
[27:39] among this small group of people but
[27:42] Lord I know it's comforting to know that
[27:45] in
[27:46] this Bible in the book of Acts that the
[27:48] Ephesians
[27:50] there were just a handful of people
[27:52] there and father you bless them so
[27:54] richly may it be a blessing the same
[27:57] blessing for us tonight
[27:59] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[28:01] amen
[28:03] God bless you all you can take your
[28:05] seeds thank you sister hope
[28:07] it's good to have my boy back
[28:10] [Applause]
[28:16] it's nice to give you an Applause
[28:18] [Laughter]
[28:21] I
[28:23] friends going through this book of Acts
[28:26] has been just such such a blessing
[28:30] to me and learning about it and
[28:33] that's devoting these Wednesday nights
[28:35] to learning this
[28:38] how the holy spirit moves among his
[28:41] people
[28:42] and knowing that these are just normal
[28:44] people and that they are very similar to
[28:49] us
[28:50] and I got to tell you
[28:52] reading about the Apostle Paul
[28:56] has been such an encouragement to me
[29:00] he that man
[29:02] if I've ever read to these scriptures
[29:05] and if I've ever seen a Christian aside
[29:08] from the Lord Jesus himself this man
[29:11] Paul was a true Christian and I think in
[29:15] in tonight's lesson that we're gonna
[29:18] see that how
[29:20] dedicated this man was
[29:23] and um
[29:25] if I could be like anybody in the world
[29:27] I think it'd be like him he was just he
[29:30] was a great man sisters it's good to
[29:32] have you and church thank you for
[29:34] joining us on Wednesday our Bible study
[29:37] in the book of Acts
[29:39] um
[29:41] a found
[29:43] in uh I found in a description
[29:47] of the Apostle Paul
[29:49] I remembered I heard brother Branham do
[29:52] it say it one time and I couldn't find
[29:54] it and and there is an Apocrypha book
[29:58] that was written just after Paul's time
[30:01] it's called the acts of Paul and thecla
[30:04] what it is is it's a uh it's an old
[30:07] story it's probably a fictional story
[30:09] about Paul and this young lady who Paul
[30:14] had influenced to give her heart to the
[30:17] Lord
[30:18] and in this book
[30:22] and like I said it's it's an apocryphal
[30:24] book so it's not considered uh New
[30:28] Testament Canon it's not considered by
[30:31] the scholars as being inspired because
[30:33] there are some things that don't
[30:34] necessarily line up with the scriptures
[30:36] but it still is in fact that old and it
[30:40] was the way that it was written
[30:43] it was it's probably a good description
[30:46] of the apostle
[30:48] and it's pretty much all that we have
[30:52] as far as a description of how this how
[30:55] this man looked
[30:57] it's called as I said it's called the
[31:00] acts of Paul and thecla
[31:03] and it says this
[31:06] it says and it was originally written in
[31:09] Greek and like I said it's written about
[31:11] 2000 years ago it says this he was a man
[31:14] of middling size
[31:16] and depending on the translation that
[31:19] you get uh the other translations also
[31:21] call them short
[31:23] so he was a man not a tall stature but
[31:26] but short
[31:27] bald or shaved head that's my favorite
[31:30] part about his description
[31:34] his legs were a little crooked or bowed
[31:38] his knees were projecting
[31:40] and he had large eyes and his eyebrows
[31:43] met
[31:45] and his nose was somewhat long
[31:49] and listen to this he
[31:52] and he was full of grace and mercy at
[31:55] one time he seemed like a man and at
[31:57] another time he seemed like an angel
[32:00] yeah
[32:03] I believe it was probably an accurate
[32:05] rendition like I said it was probably
[32:07] written by at least Consulting P the
[32:10] people that probably actually actually
[32:12] knew Paul
[32:14] um
[32:15] and there are a little bit of hints in
[32:17] the scripture
[32:19] about the Apostle just the the manner of
[32:22] man that he was in second Corinthians
[32:25] Paul is addressing some things that
[32:28] people had said about him and he says
[32:31] this for some say Paul Paul is quoting
[32:34] others he said for some say quote his
[32:37] letters are weighty and forceful
[32:40] but in person now this is scripture but
[32:43] in person he is unimpressive and his
[32:47] speaking amounts to nothing
[32:49] that's what they said about Paul and
[32:51] Paul is addressing that and then Paul
[32:53] says this and you get a little hint of
[32:54] Paul's personality
[32:56] he said such people should realize that
[33:00] what we are in our letters when we are
[33:02] absent we will be in our actions when we
[33:05] are present
[33:07] he was a man
[33:09] and and Paul would address these things
[33:12] and Paul in Acts chapter 23
[33:16] he uh
[33:17] he says this
[33:19] he says Paul
[33:21] well acts 23 what's happening is Paul's
[33:24] on trial here and he comes before the
[33:26] high priest
[33:28] and this high priest
[33:31] Paul probably knew who probably knew the
[33:34] man it was caiaphasis but he probably
[33:37] didn't know that he was high priest at
[33:39] the time and had that that rank
[33:41] and he says it says this Paul looked
[33:43] straight at the Sanhedrin and said my
[33:45] brothers I have fulfilled my duty to God
[33:47] in all good conscience to this day and
[33:51] the high priest ananias I'm sorry it was
[33:53] ananias not cafes and the high priest
[33:56] ananias ordered those standing near Paul
[34:00] to strike him on the mouth
[34:04] now watch The Temper raise up
[34:09] then Paul said to him God will strike
[34:12] you you whitewashed wall
[34:14] you sit there to judge me according to
[34:17] the law yet you yourself violate the
[34:19] wall the law by commanding that I'd be
[34:22] struck
[34:25] he got up now listen to this
[34:27] then those were standing near Paul
[34:29] remember Paul didn't know he was the
[34:31] high priest at the time then those
[34:33] standing near Paul said how dare you
[34:35] insult God's high priest
[34:38] Paul replied replied Brothers
[34:41] I didn't realize that he was the high
[34:43] priest
[34:45] for it is written do not speak evil
[34:47] about the ruler of your people
[34:50] show us Paul do you see he got smacked
[34:52] and he lashed out but then
[34:56] he knew the word and he backed off and
[35:00] he said no I know it's not right to say
[35:02] something against against our rulers so
[35:05] Paul had a personality
[35:06] it seems that he was quick to battle he
[35:10] was quick to draw those guns on some but
[35:13] then with others he just seemed to have
[35:15] endless patience
[35:17] he had humility when he said I'm the
[35:20] chiefest of sinners
[35:22] but then he also had Supreme confidence
[35:26] when he said this in second correct
[35:28] second Corinthians he said unless I
[35:31] should be exalted above measure through
[35:34] the abundance of Revelation there was
[35:36] given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[35:39] messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I
[35:41] should be exalted above measure
[35:44] so Paul was he was actually very
[35:46] confident also in in his beliefs and and
[35:50] his uh his understanding of the word
[35:53] now in this Acts chapter 20
[35:56] . Paul had been traveling
[35:59] all around
[36:01] and and he'd be he'd been visiting all
[36:04] of these churches do you remember what
[36:05] he was doing
[36:07] when he was visiting all these churches
[36:10] he was taking up an offering
[36:12] he was going from church to church and
[36:15] he was taking up this money
[36:19] so he could bring it back to the
[36:21] Believers in Jerusalem because there was
[36:24] a very hard time going there
[36:27] so Paul
[36:29] it blessed me so much when I read that
[36:33] and I really understood what was going
[36:34] on that these are the people that really
[36:37] gave him problems and yet he loved them
[36:39] and he did everything he could for him
[36:41] he went to all these new churches that
[36:43] he probably started
[36:45] took up these offerings and then it was
[36:48] in his mind to go back to Jerusalem
[36:52] so
[36:53] where we ended up in Acts chapter 20
[36:55] Paul was with
[36:58] this doctor named Luke
[37:01] who actually also wrote the whole book
[37:03] of Acts
[37:04] so we know that Luke was an eyewitness
[37:07] here he was also a physician and we have
[37:11] this this boy named eudicus and he's up
[37:13] in the third story of the the building
[37:16] and he falls asleep in church
[37:21] and that's the reason don't do it
[37:24] so I'll be watching so I'm just kidding
[37:28] so he he fought he's watching you Daniel
[37:31] so he he falls asleep in church
[37:35] and he lands and he dies this young boy
[37:39] so Luke's Luke's here he's the doctor
[37:41] he's on the scene and then Paul comes
[37:44] out and he lays his body over this young
[37:46] man and the young man is revived and I
[37:49] played last on the last study that we
[37:52] had I played a video that I actually
[37:55] took
[37:56] of a resurrection that happened in
[37:59] church when a man that I'm very good
[38:01] friends with I've known him ever since I
[38:03] was born a man named James Jackson died
[38:07] in church while I was there in the
[38:11] Branham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville
[38:13] Indiana
[38:15] I saw him
[38:17] dead
[38:19] there was a doctor present there was my
[38:22] brother who was a paramedic was present
[38:24] this man was dead they couldn't get any
[38:27] type of vital signs on him and he was
[38:30] actually dead after we did the math he
[38:32] was dead between 30 minutes and an hour
[38:35] and um
[38:37] the Lord brought him back to life
[38:40] and that was I don't know five years ago
[38:43] five or six years ago Daniel was there
[38:45] five or six years ago and he's still
[38:48] alive and doing well in this very day
[38:51] James James Jackson as I said a good
[38:53] friend of my family
[38:55] so we see that that this happened and
[38:58] then we ended our study there in Acts
[39:01] chapter 20 verse 12. so let's start with
[39:04] Acts chapter 20 verse 13. so then it was
[39:09] so sweet so Paul just loves the people
[39:11] so much
[39:12] so he actually after this happened with
[39:15] uticus and he preached so long at night
[39:17] he just decides this is the last time
[39:19] he's going to see these people he just
[39:20] decides to stay up all night with him
[39:22] fellowshipping and talking about the
[39:24] Lord so they stayed up all night
[39:27] verse 13
[39:29] and we went
[39:32] before to ship we
[39:35] it's very very important here because it
[39:37] says that the author of this book
[39:40] the book of Acts is a long for the ride
[39:43] now
[39:44] so Luke is writing he says I was there
[39:46] and Luke as I'll show in a little bit
[39:49] Luke gives these little hints in the
[39:51] book of Acts and and he's just he's a
[39:54] beautiful writer he gives doctrinal
[39:56] hints and then he's also giving a hint
[39:58] that's saying hey I wasn't doing the
[40:00] research like I was for my gospel of
[40:03] Luke
[40:04] he says I wasn't doing the research like
[40:06] that I was actually there when this
[40:09] happened and we went before the ship and
[40:12] sailed to Asos they're intending to take
[40:15] Paul for so he had appointed minding
[40:18] himself to go afoot
[40:21] so he walked these guys rode in the boat
[40:24] and they met and when we met and when he
[40:27] met with us at Asos we took him in and
[40:30] came to middling
[40:32] and we sailed thence and came the next
[40:35] day over to chios
[40:38] and the next day we arrived at Samos and
[40:41] tarried at trojulum and the next day we
[40:44] came to my lead us for Paul had
[40:46] determined to Sail by Ephesus because he
[40:49] would not spend the time in Asia for he
[40:52] had he hasted if it were possible for
[40:55] him to be at Jerusalem the day of
[40:58] Pentecost
[40:59] so this day of Pentecost as you as you
[41:02] probably already know what we've we've
[41:04] heard brother Lyle he's he's very
[41:06] learned in in these different feast days
[41:08] Pentecost was basically a holiday for
[41:11] the Jewish people and he wanted to be in
[41:14] Jerusalem for this holiday or this feast
[41:18] day and um
[41:20] his we see the remainder of the book of
[41:24] Acts
[41:25] is that Paul
[41:29] had it on his heart to go to Jerusalem
[41:31] and then from Jerusalem Paul wanted to
[41:33] go to Rome
[41:35] and that is basically the rest of the
[41:38] book of Acts is his desire to eventually
[41:41] get to Rome
[41:44] and from malidas
[41:46] he sent to Ephesus and called the Elders
[41:49] of the church
[41:51] now so they they came to my leadest
[41:55] which was on the coast and Ephesus was
[41:58] about 50 miles away
[42:01] so what is going on here is Paul
[42:05] sends to the brethren in Ephesus the
[42:08] Elders of the church and he says hey I'm
[42:10] not going to come to Ephesus but I want
[42:12] you to come to my lead us over here so
[42:16] we can have this meeting and this sermon
[42:19] is different than any other of the
[42:20] sermons given in the book of Acts it's
[42:22] addressed to Christian leadership
[42:27] so this one is an anomaly in pretty much
[42:30] in this whole Testament New Testament
[42:32] this is it's ministers meeting
[42:36] basically what it is it's Paul getting
[42:38] the elders together and he says Hey
[42:40] travel over here and I want to talk
[42:43] about some of these things and we're
[42:45] going to see why that he wants to talk
[42:47] about these things it's actually it's a
[42:49] very sad story
[42:52] and when they were come to him
[42:54] he said unto them ye know from the first
[42:57] day that I came into Asia after what
[43:00] Manner I have been with you at all
[43:03] seasons now he's talking about Asia he's
[43:04] talking about Asia Minor Ephesus was
[43:08] located in this Asian Minor it was the
[43:10] big city there
[43:12] now these people he says this he says
[43:15] after what Manner I have been with you
[43:18] at all seasons so these people knew Paul
[43:21] he was there for a long time he's there
[43:23] for over three years they knew Paul
[43:26] and they had seen the way that this man
[43:28] Paul lived they saw his personal life
[43:31] and he's saying he's saying hey look at
[43:33] me
[43:34] you've seen me in All Seasons you've
[43:36] seen the kind of person that I am
[43:39] and it made me think as I read that it's
[43:42] it's made me think that how important is
[43:46] the life that we live
[43:47] to other everyone else we hear so much
[43:51] that you
[43:53] it's not so important that you preach me
[43:55] a sermon but live me a sermon that life
[44:00] that we live is so much more powerful
[44:02] than the words that we say and that's
[44:05] what Paul is saying he's saying hey he's
[44:06] saying look at me I'm backing up what I
[44:09] preach I'm backing this up with my life
[44:13] verse 19 he says serving the Lord with
[44:15] all humility of mind and with many tears
[44:17] and temptations which befell me by the
[44:20] lying in weight of the Jews key word
[44:23] here
[44:24] is humility
[44:28] Paul says here he says serving the Lord
[44:31] with all humility of mind
[44:34] and remember he's speaking to ministers
[44:38] he's speaking to leaders in the times
[44:40] when someone gets a position of
[44:43] authority
[44:45] there you see their character come out a
[44:49] lot of times you see some people will
[44:51] sit back and want everyone else to do
[44:53] the work
[44:54] you'll see others that Jesus said he
[44:57] said that they want the high places in
[44:58] the synagogues and when people pass them
[45:01] on the street they want people to say
[45:02] hello Pastor they want they want that
[45:04] recognition they want to be recognized
[45:06] at weddings or at Social functions and
[45:09] then there's others that that we've seen
[45:13] that they want to paycheck you know they
[45:15] they like the word maybe and they've got
[45:17] a good Revelation but then they decide
[45:19] that that hey I want to just make a
[45:22] living off of the church
[45:24] and then there's others
[45:26] they have a spirit once they get in
[45:28] there they have a spirit of control
[45:32] and as time goes by they want to start
[45:34] to control your personal life not
[45:37] encourage you not say Daniel you
[45:41] shouldn't be doing this or doing that
[45:43] but they want control and we see that so
[45:47] often from the pulpit and and then when
[45:51] you don't do what they say many times
[45:54] they will attack you from the pulpit
[45:58] and I got to tell you
[46:01] as far as as a Minister doing that it's
[46:04] easier to do that than it is to go to
[46:07] that person one-on-one because they
[46:09] can't fight back
[46:10] and they're out there in the audience
[46:12] and you can preach this and they know
[46:15] that you're preaching against them but
[46:17] they can't respond they can't fight back
[46:20] and that's many of the ministers
[46:23] do that
[46:25] but Paul says this he says with all
[46:27] humility of mind with tears and
[46:29] temptations that came really from the
[46:32] traps of his own people of his own
[46:34] brethren from the people that he knew
[46:37] that stabbed him in the back these
[46:39] Jewish people that came against him and
[46:42] Peter says
[46:43] in in his epistle Peter says that these
[46:46] trials are like pure gold
[46:48] because they build these trials these
[46:51] suffering that we have they build our
[46:52] character Revelation Chapter 3 Verse 18
[46:55] it says I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[46:58] tried in the fire
[47:01] and that's building that Christian
[47:03] character that thou mayest be rich in
[47:06] white Raymond and that thou mayest be
[47:08] clothed and the shame of thy nakedness
[47:11] do not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[47:13] isav that I may as see as many as I love
[47:17] Jesus speaking as many as I love I
[47:20] rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore
[47:23] and repent
[47:25] so these trials that we have it's
[47:28] building our character and you're going
[47:31] to see that as as Paul goes on with this
[47:33] with this sermon
[47:35] Paul goes on he says how I kept back
[47:37] nothing that was profitable unto you but
[47:40] I've showed you and have taught you
[47:42] publicly and from house to house
[47:45] testifying both to the Jews and also to
[47:47] the Greeks repentance towards God and
[47:50] Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:53] remember again he's talking to Elders
[47:55] here he's talking to ministers and it
[47:59] makes me go back he says I haven't held
[48:00] anything back from you it makes me think
[48:03] about this book of of the of First
[48:05] Corinthians where he writes this letter
[48:08] to the Corinthians church and it was
[48:13] addressing problems
[48:15] it was telling it was the the women were
[48:19] causing problems in the church the men
[48:21] were divorcing their wives the young
[48:23] people were sleeping around and they had
[48:26] gifts operating in the church but the
[48:27] gifts were all out of order and it was
[48:30] it was like emotion was starting to
[48:32] replace the Holy Spirit and Paul says to
[48:34] the official Ephesians here he said I
[48:36] held nothing back from you
[48:39] so
[48:41] Paul many times
[48:44] most of the time
[48:46] it's hard to make a stand
[48:49] it's very very difficult especially
[48:52] maybe for a minister and these are
[48:54] ministers here it's hard to make a
[48:57] decision because you want to please
[48:59] everyone but if you if you go through
[49:01] and you try to please everyone you're
[49:03] going to end up pleasing no one and
[49:06] everyone is going to start fighting and
[49:08] and there's going to be all these
[49:09] problems and Paul here he's saying I
[49:11] didn't do that I didn't hold anything
[49:14] back I told you the truth
[49:17] and we're gaining
[49:19] knowledge
[49:21] here in this book of Acts and and
[49:24] remember we need to always Place
[49:26] ourselves
[49:28] in this book we need to always place in
[49:30] the scriptures they're just not for
[49:32] history
[49:33] they're to place ourselves there and to
[49:36] make us better better people
[49:40] Paul
[49:41] as I said in our last bible study on
[49:45] this Acts chapter 20 on part one I said
[49:48] that that there's different callings in
[49:51] the church and there's different types
[49:53] of worship sometimes that that worship
[49:56] is is very Lively and sometimes it's
[49:59] it's loud and it's and it's it's active
[50:03] and then other times it's quiet and it's
[50:07] it's peaceful and then other times it's
[50:09] like this where it's learning
[50:13] everyone it's it's all equal
[50:15] we have to have all of it we need that
[50:19] power we need that emotion in the church
[50:21] but we don't have to have it every
[50:23] single time
[50:24] we need that teaching and that deep
[50:26] understanding but we can also have
[50:29] worship at other times the even even to
[50:32] where God even separates
[50:35] the ministry
[50:37] and he said I gave some apostles
[50:41] and I gave some Prophets
[50:44] and I gave some evangelists and some
[50:47] pastors and some teachers
[50:50] all of these different gifts operating
[50:52] in the church and all very very
[50:54] different different ways
[50:58] so Paul and then Paul says here he says
[51:01] I taught both publicly
[51:04] like Sunday morning
[51:07] and then from house to house he's
[51:09] showing a variety in the ministry
[51:13] Ministry and then he talks about
[51:15] repentance and the ministry brings
[51:17] correction and that results in
[51:20] Repentance
[51:21] verse number 22. and now behold I go
[51:25] Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not
[51:29] knowing the things that shall befall me
[51:31] there
[51:32] save that the Holy Ghost Witnesses in
[51:35] every city saying that bonds and
[51:38] afflictions abide me another translation
[51:41] says the Holy Ghost Witnesses in every
[51:43] city saying that bonds and tribulations
[51:45] await me
[51:48] so we think
[51:50] and we're going to get on as as we get
[51:54] to chapter 21 and Beyond we're gonna
[51:56] we're gonna see that
[51:58] people he said the Holy Spirit gave
[52:00] witness that I'm going to suffer not
[52:03] only did that Holy Spirit reveal it to
[52:05] Paul
[52:06] but it also spoke through a prophetic
[52:09] Ministry in other places where they said
[52:12] Paul if you leave here if you go to
[52:15] Jerusalem like you're planning on going
[52:17] you're going to suffer
[52:18] you're going to be bound
[52:21] you might be going to your death
[52:23] we see that the brothers that were
[52:26] gifted telling Paul that and then we see
[52:28] the Holy Spirit revealing and also to
[52:29] Paul saying saying you're going to
[52:32] suffer
[52:33] but just because you suffer doesn't mean
[52:36] you're out of God's will
[52:38] you know so often we think we think that
[52:40] well because
[52:42] I am I I'm suffering I may have lost my
[52:45] job or am I I might have had this bad
[52:47] thing happen or my children might be
[52:49] going astray or something like that like
[52:51] I did something wrong but it's not
[52:53] always the case
[52:56] suffering is part of being a Christian
[52:59] and Paul says that he says I'm going
[53:04] and I'm going Bound in the spirit
[53:08] so he knows that he's going over here to
[53:11] Jerusalem to suffer but then he says
[53:13] that I am bound I have to do what the
[53:16] Holy Spirit leads where you say well
[53:18] Paul he told you you're gonna you're
[53:19] gonna you're gonna get arrested and all
[53:21] these things you're gonna suffer over
[53:22] there but he didn't tell him not to go
[53:26] Paul through the Holy Spirit also knew
[53:28] that he was supposed to go to suffer
[53:30] these things
[53:31] in another place Paul calls himself a
[53:34] prisoner of Christ
[53:36] I I think about that and I think about
[53:40] how I would love
[53:43] Lord if you would Grant something to me
[53:45] let that be me
[53:46] whatever the Lord has whatever would
[53:50] please the Lord let me let me fall right
[53:52] into that Lord bind my hands and my feet
[53:57] Lord let me be bound by your Holy Spirit
[54:00] just guide me Lord I don't have to I
[54:03] don't have to win in this world I don't
[54:05] have to be successful I don't have to I
[54:07] don't even have to be happy
[54:09] Lord let me just be in your will
[54:13] and Paul he he had the goods
[54:17] and the old saying he put his money
[54:19] where his mouth is he really did
[54:23] so he knows he's going
[54:25] he knows he's going to Jerusalem he
[54:27] knows he's going to suffer and he says
[54:28] this but none of these things move me
[54:31] neither count I my my life dear unto
[54:34] myself so that I might finish my course
[54:37] with joy and the ministry which I have
[54:39] received of the Lord Jesus to testify
[54:41] the gospel of the grace of God
[54:47] look at the dedication of the apostle
[54:50] why was this all so important to him
[54:53] because he loved the people
[54:56] he genuinely had a love for these people
[55:00] that he was preaching to
[55:03] in fact
[55:05] it was more important to Paul
[55:09] that these people came to the Lord
[55:13] than even for himself
[55:16] I'm going to say something that's not
[55:18] going to make sense but I'm going to
[55:20] read it right out of the Bible
[55:23] Paul
[55:24] in Romans chapter 9.
[55:27] verse 1.
[55:28] Paul says this
[55:31] I say the truth in Christ I lie not so
[55:37] Paul is laying a foundation here saying
[55:39] listen I'm not kidding around
[55:41] when I say this I really mean it I'm not
[55:44] just saying it because it sounds good
[55:48] he says I lie not my conscience also
[55:50] bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost
[55:54] that I have great heaviness and
[55:58] continual sorrow in my heart
[56:01] for I could wish that myself
[56:07] were cursed from Christ for my brethren
[56:10] my Kinsmen according to the flesh who
[56:13] are Israelites to whom pertaineth the
[56:15] adoption and the and the glory and
[56:18] Covenants and the giving of the law and
[56:20] the service of God and the promises
[56:26] let that sink in
[56:29] he said that I would rather me
[56:33] not not just suffer
[56:35] not not just go to the cross
[56:39] he says I would rather me be cursed from
[56:44] Christ
[56:46] than them
[56:49] I can almost it almost doesn't even I
[56:52] don't know how someone could be so
[56:55] sincere
[56:56] and Paul says I lie not and he says my
[56:59] my conscience also bearing Bears me
[57:01] witness he said I would rather me suffer
[57:04] I would rather be me condemned than
[57:06] these people my brethren in Jerusalem
[57:09] and do you remember what they did to him
[57:11] those brothers from Jerusalem
[57:13] they came down
[57:15] and all these all these churches that
[57:17] Paul had started in galatia and all
[57:20] these places they came down from
[57:21] Jerusalem and started preaching their
[57:23] legalistic Doctrine
[57:25] starting causing all these problems
[57:28] and yet Paul said I would rather me
[57:32] be cursed from Christ than these people
[57:35] these legalistic
[57:39] self-consumed Jews
[57:42] I would rather that have given him so
[57:45] much problem I would rather me be cursed
[57:47] than them
[57:50] almost
[57:53] talk about the spirit of Christ
[57:56] so Paul is he he says I would rather me
[57:59] be cursed and then I think about the
[58:01] Lord Jesus Not only was Jesus cursed for
[58:06] the sins of the people Jesus became the
[58:09] chiefest of sinners
[58:12] for
[58:13] all of us for those people that hated
[58:15] him for the people that spit in his face
[58:18] and look at that Spirit of Christ it
[58:20] comes right down here into this man Paul
[58:24] I think how tremendous how tremendous to
[58:29] have that spirit
[58:31] that is what can change the world
[58:34] that is what can start a Revival is that
[58:36] Spirit right there
[58:39] and now behold
[58:41] verse number 25 in in Acts 20. and now
[58:44] behold
[58:46] I know
[58:48] that ye all among whom I have gone
[58:50] preaching the kingdom of God shall see
[58:53] my face no more
[58:55] Paul doesn't know what's going to happen
[58:57] if he leaves and goes to Jerusalem but
[59:00] he knows it isn't going to be easy
[59:02] wherefore I take you to record this day
[59:06] that I am pure from the blood of all men
[59:09] for I have not shunned to declare unto
[59:12] you all the counsel of God what a
[59:15] scripture I want a scripture to say
[59:18] and look what happened to Paul when he
[59:20] did this his own people the Jews they
[59:23] hated him because he didn't preach the
[59:25] prophet
[59:26] Moses's Doctrine
[59:29] he didn't he didn't preach circumcision
[59:31] he didn't preach a certain way of
[59:32] dressing he didn't preach a certain way
[59:34] of eating he didn't preach certain days
[59:36] to worship how to wash your hands how to
[59:38] how to wash your dishes and everything
[59:39] else yet Paul said he didn't preach what
[59:43] Moses preached
[59:45] yet Paul said I have not shunned to
[59:49] declare unto you the whole counsel of
[59:50] God
[59:52] wow
[59:55] I think as a
[59:57] as a minister I I when I die I want to
[59:59] be able to say the same thing
[1:00:01] and I didn't I didn't hold anything back
[1:00:04] that whatever the Lord laid on my heart
[1:00:07] no matter if it gets you it gets me in
[1:00:10] trouble no matter if it sends me as Paul
[1:00:13] sends me to this place
[1:00:15] where I'm going to suffer
[1:00:18] Lord let me say it
[1:00:20] you know I
[1:00:22] you think about the country think about
[1:00:24] not standing up for what's right
[1:00:27] they got this whole thing with uh with
[1:00:29] Disney you seen this with Snow White and
[1:00:32] the Seven Dwarfs
[1:00:35] have you seen what's going on
[1:00:38] they're not dwarfs anymore
[1:00:41] because they were afraid of offending
[1:00:44] little people so they make this new
[1:00:47] movie and they got no Dwarfs
[1:00:51] what kind of a snow white story is that
[1:00:54] but they were afraid of offending
[1:00:58] the the little people so they didn't
[1:01:01] make them dwarf so you know what they
[1:01:02] did they got all of the uh the little
[1:01:06] actors they got them all mad at them
[1:01:08] because they're saying like this is Snow
[1:01:10] White we should be given the job now
[1:01:12] you're giving the job to the normal size
[1:01:14] people
[1:01:15] they don't they they were trying not to
[1:01:18] offend everybody and they offended they
[1:01:20] end up offending everybody
[1:01:22] and if you don't make a decision if
[1:01:25] you're worried about what everybody
[1:01:26] thinks then you'll fail and you just
[1:01:29] cause a bunch of fighting
[1:01:31] and then you mess up the whole fairy
[1:01:33] tale
[1:01:34] of Snow White
[1:01:37] and you'll mess up the word too
[1:01:41] it's a type I'm trying to make a type of
[1:01:44] not standing up for what is right
[1:01:47] that you'll ruin everything
[1:01:51] look about
[1:01:53] the leadership in this this country and
[1:01:56] all you all know what I'm not even going
[1:01:59] to talk about the uh the Beer Company
[1:02:04] sin
[1:02:06] wrong
[1:02:08] wrong and they don't want to offend
[1:02:09] anybody so they get this weirdo
[1:02:12] and then most of the country is offended
[1:02:16] because they're afraid of offending
[1:02:18] someone
[1:02:19] and it just causes all kinds of trouble
[1:02:21] that was not the Apostle yet he did
[1:02:24] everything in love
[1:02:25] he loved these people he didn't want to
[1:02:27] see them lost he didn't want to see them
[1:02:29] suffer
[1:02:31] I'm sure he spent countless hours on his
[1:02:34] knees praying for him and he said yet
[1:02:36] they they come against me and they've
[1:02:39] done all these things against me yet I
[1:02:40] love them and I would rather me be
[1:02:42] cursed instead of them
[1:02:45] foreign
[1:03:02] you know it's not
[1:03:04] it's not what we don't do for God
[1:03:07] that matters
[1:03:09] you know you say you say I don't drink I
[1:03:12] don't smoke I don't look like the world
[1:03:13] I don't dress like the world I don't go
[1:03:15] to movies I don't watch TV I don't I
[1:03:17] don't I don't go outside my house I
[1:03:19] don't do this I don't do that that's
[1:03:20] great
[1:03:21] I don't witness to anyone I don't reach
[1:03:23] out to the lost I don't spend more than
[1:03:25] 20 minutes in prayer
[1:03:27] I don't give offerings to the Lord
[1:03:29] outside my ties I don't read my Bible I
[1:03:31] don't do I don't reach out to the
[1:03:33] Sinners I don't teach my children to
[1:03:34] reach out to Sinners I don't I don't
[1:03:36] stay I don't stay in my little church
[1:03:38] group I stay in my little church group
[1:03:41] and I do nothing for God
[1:03:44] how many of us fall into that same thing
[1:03:47] I don't do it I don't do this I don't do
[1:03:49] that I don't do that it's not what you
[1:03:52] don't do for God that matters it's what
[1:03:55] you do for him you don't sin because you
[1:03:59] love him
[1:04:00] but you also serve him
[1:04:03] serve him is not not doing something
[1:04:05] serving him is doing something
[1:04:10] take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[1:04:12] to all the flock over which the Holy
[1:04:14] Ghost has made you overseers to feed the
[1:04:17] Church of God which hath which he hath
[1:04:20] purchased with his own blood
[1:04:24] now let me quickly go through each thing
[1:04:26] that he says here take heed therefore
[1:04:28] unto yourselves
[1:04:30] he said because I'm leaving
[1:04:33] therefore you pastors you leaders you
[1:04:35] elders
[1:04:36] you need to be right in the eyes of the
[1:04:39] Lord before you can lead the church
[1:04:42] and if if your air conditioner goes out
[1:04:45] in your car at this time of year you
[1:04:47] don't want to go to the mechanic and and
[1:04:49] a boy come out and say yeah you know my
[1:04:52] dad taught me how to change the oil one
[1:04:54] time I think I can fix your air
[1:04:56] conditioner
[1:04:57] you don't want somebody like that you
[1:04:59] want somebody that knows how to do it
[1:05:02] and it's and that's what Paul's trying
[1:05:03] to teach these these ministers here
[1:05:06] these Elders he's saying that take heed
[1:05:08] unto yourselves
[1:05:10] like I've told the story about flying
[1:05:12] you get the you get in the airplane and
[1:05:15] you sit there you know and you you're
[1:05:17] you're getting ready and you're squeezed
[1:05:19] in there and here comes here comes the
[1:05:21] flight attendant out and they give you
[1:05:22] this little play
[1:05:24] before you take off
[1:05:26] and they tell you about the oxygen mask
[1:05:27] and how you're supposed to put the
[1:05:29] oxygen mask on yourself before you put
[1:05:32] the oxygen mask on your kids
[1:05:34] it's because you need to have that
[1:05:37] oxygen flowing first because if you
[1:05:39] don't have that oxygen flowing you're
[1:05:41] going to pass out and you're not going
[1:05:42] to be able to save anyone and that's the
[1:05:45] same thing with the ministry we need to
[1:05:48] make sure that we have the Holy Spirit
[1:05:50] that we know this Bible that we can
[1:05:52] explain
[1:05:53] the Bible when someone has a problem
[1:05:57] when a couple is is thinking about
[1:05:59] divorce
[1:06:01] we need to be able to take it back to
[1:06:03] the word
[1:06:06] all from the gifts of the Spirit
[1:06:10] to Adam and Eve and The Serpent and the
[1:06:14] relationship there and and how they're
[1:06:17] there were all Jewish prophets and can
[1:06:21] you explain how God could send a gentile
[1:06:23] prophet and and all of these things we
[1:06:26] need to be able to explain these things
[1:06:28] we need to have that oxygen flowing or
[1:06:31] we're not doing good do a good job and
[1:06:33] that's what Paul is saying here
[1:06:36] all the way to the deepest of all the
[1:06:38] doctrines in the Bible the one that the
[1:06:40] apostles taught about the most every
[1:06:43] Apostolic sermon and that is salvation
[1:06:45] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:47] it's the most important part of the book
[1:06:52] is that everything else pales in
[1:06:55] comparison to it
[1:06:58] and he says there he says take heed to
[1:07:01] yourselves and to all the flock
[1:07:03] so make sure you've received the baptism
[1:07:06] of the Holy Ghost and then you teach
[1:07:07] others
[1:07:09] to to receive that baptism also over the
[1:07:12] which the Holy Ghost has made you
[1:07:14] overseers
[1:07:16] who made you the overseer
[1:07:18] the holy the Holy Ghost did
[1:07:25] and he tells the elders to feed the
[1:07:27] Church of God
[1:07:30] Paul tells these Elders from Ephesus he
[1:07:33] said to feed the Church of God which God
[1:07:36] hath purchased
[1:07:38] with his own blood
[1:07:42] now remember I said Luke and how he
[1:07:45] slips in a little Doctrine here and
[1:07:47] there
[1:07:48] this is one of those times Luke puts in
[1:07:51] this Doctrine and he says which he has
[1:07:54] purchased with his own blood
[1:07:58] so
[1:07:59] why is that so important God
[1:08:03] purchased with his own blood so what
[1:08:07] does that tell you
[1:08:10] so Jesus and God are the same one
[1:08:13] because it was Jesus right that bled on
[1:08:16] the cross
[1:08:17] so if God purchased our salvation with
[1:08:21] his own blood
[1:08:23] it's doctrine of the godhead that Jesus
[1:08:26] is divine
[1:08:28] now let me read you something let me
[1:08:30] read you another translation of the
[1:08:32] Bible
[1:08:33] the new world translation of the Bible
[1:08:35] says this
[1:08:37] to the shepherd
[1:08:38] the congregate to to Shepherd the
[1:08:41] congregation of God which he purchased
[1:08:44] with the blood of his own son
[1:08:47] why would you change that
[1:08:49] why would you change it from God with
[1:08:52] his own blood to the blood of his own
[1:08:53] son
[1:08:55] it's because you don't believe
[1:08:57] that that Jesus is God
[1:09:00] that translation is a New World
[1:09:02] Translation it's Jehovah Witness
[1:09:06] so they're just changing
[1:09:07] they said no it's literally translated
[1:09:11] that that uh which he had purchased with
[1:09:13] his own blood but they didn't actually
[1:09:15] mean that
[1:09:18] you know you find a hireling translator
[1:09:20] translator and you can make it say
[1:09:22] anything that you want
[1:09:24] verse number 29 for I know this that
[1:09:27] after my departing shall Grievous wolves
[1:09:29] enter in among you not sparing the flock
[1:09:32] also of your own selves shall men arise
[1:09:35] speaking perverse things to draw away
[1:09:38] disciples after them
[1:09:40] so these wolves will come from outside
[1:09:43] and they will also come from inside
[1:09:47] they'll come from right inside the
[1:09:48] church and then they'll come from
[1:09:50] evangelists or whatever whatever it is
[1:09:52] coming in and causing problems but
[1:09:55] remember the wolf kills the Sheep it
[1:09:58] never builds Unity it never builds love
[1:10:01] it's these you have to look at these and
[1:10:05] you you judge as Jesus said you judge
[1:10:08] these wolves by the fruits uh what they
[1:10:12] produce
[1:10:14] Deuteronomy 18.
[1:10:17] verse 21 says this if thou say in thine
[1:10:20] heart how shall we know the word which
[1:10:22] the Lord hath not spoken
[1:10:24] when a prophet speaketh in the name of
[1:10:26] the Lord if the thing follow not nor
[1:10:28] come nor come to pass
[1:10:31] that thing which the Lord hath not that
[1:10:34] is that is the thing which the Lord hath
[1:10:36] not spoken but the prophet hath spoken
[1:10:38] it presumptuously Thou shalt not be
[1:10:41] afraid of him
[1:10:43] so many times you'll hear these
[1:10:45] prophecies and you hear oh the Lord's
[1:10:47] telling me this
[1:10:49] be careful of that
[1:10:52] I wish I had time I think maybe I'll
[1:10:55] I'll preach on this on another on
[1:10:58] another service
[1:11:02] but I will say this
[1:11:04] they use Christ as a reference
[1:11:07] these wolves that come in it's always
[1:11:10] Jesus Jesus Jesus
[1:11:13] but it's always something more than
[1:11:16] Jesus that they teach you need something
[1:11:18] more
[1:11:20] you need you need something other than
[1:11:23] Jesus in addition to Jesus and it ends
[1:11:26] up that it's always about them
[1:11:29] it's always about well I am special I
[1:11:34] have this gift I have that gift rather
[1:11:37] than pointing the people to Christ they
[1:11:39] begin to point the people to themselves
[1:11:41] and that's these wolves
[1:11:43] therefore watch
[1:11:45] and remember that by the space of three
[1:11:48] years I cease not to warn everyone night
[1:11:51] and day with tears
[1:11:54] so he's saying I warned you you know me
[1:11:56] I was with you for three years you know
[1:11:59] my Ministry you know that I'm sincere
[1:12:01] and I'm warning you and now Brethren I
[1:12:05] commend you to God and to the word of
[1:12:07] his grace which is able to build you up
[1:12:10] and to give you an inheritance among all
[1:12:13] them which are Sanctified I have coveted
[1:12:16] no man's silver or gold or apparel this
[1:12:19] doesn't need any commentary listen to
[1:12:21] him ye
[1:12:23] yay ye yourselves know that with thee
[1:12:27] that these hands have ministered under
[1:12:30] my necessities and to them that were
[1:12:33] with me I have showed you all things how
[1:12:36] that's so laboring ye ought to support
[1:12:38] the weak
[1:12:40] and to remember the words of the Lord
[1:12:43] Jesus how he said it is more blessed to
[1:12:45] give than to receive when I was driving
[1:12:48] up today I saw outside there was um this
[1:12:54] young lady and she was tripping on
[1:12:57] something bad
[1:12:58] and I saw brother Ben
[1:13:02] he opened the door
[1:13:04] and he had
[1:13:06] and I was driving by and he had two
[1:13:09] bottles of water
[1:13:11] and and he had compassion on the young
[1:13:14] lady and I watched me to know I was
[1:13:16] watching and I and I watched him go up
[1:13:19] and and he that he gave her this water
[1:13:23] and and she was all over the place and
[1:13:27] and I watched it for a little bit and
[1:13:30] then she went over on the on the side
[1:13:31] over here
[1:13:32] obviously strung out on drugs and I
[1:13:35] thought wow
[1:13:36] that uh
[1:13:38] very kind
[1:13:40] man laboring you ought to support the
[1:13:42] weak as what Paul said here so I walked
[1:13:46] up
[1:13:47] and
[1:13:48] she uh
[1:13:50] she walked by and she was she was going
[1:13:52] crazy and and I said I said sister I
[1:13:56] said you need to settle down
[1:13:59] took off running and then she comes back
[1:14:01] and she basically said I really like
[1:14:04] that man but not you
[1:14:09] so she liked brother Ben
[1:14:12] oh
[1:14:13] um
[1:14:14] God bless him you know he had compassion
[1:14:16] it says here how that's soul laboring
[1:14:20] you ought to support the weak and to
[1:14:21] remember the words of our Lord Jesus how
[1:14:23] he said it is more blessed to give
[1:14:25] than to receive you know it's one of the
[1:14:28] most famously quoted things brother
[1:14:30] Silas I'm going to tell you something
[1:14:31] you didn't know
[1:14:32] that's one of the most famously quoted
[1:14:36] scriptures that Jesus said it is more
[1:14:39] blessed to give
[1:14:41] than to receive
[1:14:44] did you know
[1:14:45] that there is no record of Jesus saying
[1:14:47] that anywhere in the Gospels
[1:14:49] we have all the record of what Jesus
[1:14:51] said it's not there
[1:14:54] this is the only place and it's in red
[1:14:57] right here this is the only place that
[1:14:59] it is in the whole Bible
[1:15:02] and Paul who never knew Jesus
[1:15:06] somehow
[1:15:08] got this quote from the Lord even though
[1:15:13] it's not written in the four Gospels
[1:15:16] Bible study
[1:15:22] and when he had thus spoken he kneeled
[1:15:25] down and prayed with them all
[1:15:27] and they all wept sore and fell on
[1:15:30] Paul's neck and kissed him
[1:15:32] souring most of all for The Words which
[1:15:34] he spake that they should see his face
[1:15:37] no more and they accompanied him under
[1:15:40] the ship
[1:15:42] sister hope you can come Daniel
[1:15:44] musicians brother Aaron if you can make
[1:15:46] ready
[1:15:48] the closing statements
[1:15:50] of the Apostle Paul to the Brethren at
[1:15:52] Ephesus
[1:15:54] and he says he says
[1:15:57] he says
[1:15:58] they kneel down the Apostle Luke the
[1:16:02] author he says they kneel down
[1:16:05] and they prayed with them all
[1:16:07] and I thought it was so sweet that they
[1:16:09] wept
[1:16:10] these dear friends these dear Elders
[1:16:13] these brothers got together all together
[1:16:17] and I could just see them
[1:16:20] all around each other and weeping
[1:16:23] because they knew
[1:16:25] what was going to happen to their dear
[1:16:27] friend Paul
[1:16:29] then they they knew that he was going to
[1:16:31] go to Jerusalem they knew that he was
[1:16:32] going to suffer
[1:16:34] they didn't know what was going to be
[1:16:35] the end but they one thing that they did
[1:16:37] know is they were never going to see
[1:16:38] this man again
[1:16:40] and how much they meant how much Paul
[1:16:43] meant to them
[1:16:44] and in his closing statements
[1:16:47] I really appreciate that in verse 26
[1:16:50] Paul said wherefore I take you to record
[1:16:52] this day
[1:16:54] that I am pure from the blood of all men
[1:16:58] for I have not shunned to declare unto
[1:17:01] you all the Council of God
[1:17:06] I wish I could have been there
[1:17:09] I wish I could have been there I gave
[1:17:11] this
[1:17:12] description of Paul
[1:17:16] what he looked like
[1:17:18] I think
[1:17:20] of him saying he says I lie not
[1:17:24] and he says my conscience Bears me
[1:17:27] witness that I would rather me be cursed
[1:17:32] Christ than you
[1:17:35] even though
[1:17:36] you've done me all these problems even

[1:17:54] saying that to the Ephesians he was
[1:17:58] saying that back to those people in
[1:18:00] Jerusalem
[1:18:02] that that had done them so wrong
[1:18:05] I think Lord what kind of a Christian
[1:18:09] was this man Paul
[1:18:11] he to me

[1:18:39] looking forward to let me give you a
[1:18:41] little taste of what's coming in in
[1:18:43] chapter 21. all of these people I said
[1:18:46] it earlier all of these people start
[1:18:47] prophesying and they start telling that
[1:18:50] Paul not to go
[1:18:53] but even with all of the prophecies even
[1:18:56] with all of the spirit moving even with
[1:18:58] everything that was happening Paul still
[1:19:02] followed the leading of the Lord for
[1:19:04] himself
[1:19:06] and went to Jerusalem and you know what
[1:19:08] brother Lyle they were both right
[1:19:11] the prophets that prophesied that tried
[1:19:14] to not tried to get him not to go they
[1:19:17] were right they were prophesying unto
[1:19:19] the Holy Spirit
[1:19:20] they were writing what they said and
[1:19:22] Paul was right in going
[1:19:25] he was writing and going to Jerusalem
[1:19:27] and bringing that money and trying to
[1:19:30] win these Souls
