the house of the lord this morning this evening amen and that's brother john's unbrewing if you just come and open the service in a word of prayer here in a moment let's just stand this evening had only one request brought mentioned brother aaron mentioned before service that brother david savala's wife sister naomi has covered and it's been going through maybe their church a little bit of people back there so let's just remember them in prayer this evening i'm sure each one of us have a need in our hearts amen i know sometimes i say when we invite the brothers to come up to pray may they speak to the lord on our behalf but tonight maybe just a little differently as brother john prays maybe just each one of you just praying your way to the lord as well and i know we do that but maybe make that more intentional tonight and just not just let the brother up here that's praying but let's just each speak to the lord in our own way amen god bless you brother john [Music] be before we go to the lord and i've talked to a few of you of a project that i want to do and it kind of goes along with the number of holocaust victims world war ii soldiers who who fought for our freedom as time goes on many of the testimonies that we do have and this is you know i i didn't see the service today i usually put that off to monday my project that i would like to do and i don't know if it's of the lord you know i didn't get a voice or a sign but it's something on my heart that everybody here has a testimony some have great testimonies and this is only how we as humans judge things you know there's a little white sin and there's a you know a big big black sin okay but it's all sin testimony no matter how small or how big is a testimony to somebody [Music] you know even if it's just somebody came up to you and said god bless i'd like to get testimonies from all of you i'll need some help and the help is how do i take these testimonies that i get and i hear and distribute them out to all of you okay um so pray about it if you have an idea no matter how old you are i'm open uh for that we can even have it here a couple copies of this and it would be easy for me that if you wrote it down you just have to write it down that i would type it up okay that's my project that's my project and i hope it is of god and gives us uplifting no matter how small the testimony that you know is so i've talked to a few people brothers and sisters about that and just this week it's really gotten more on my heart so pray about it um i'll type it up exactly as you want it i can put your name in it i can give it a title so that's okay so let's go to the lord pereira dear heavenly father lord god we just thank you for all that you've given us again a place to to worship you a place that we can worship you in freedom from hostilities lord just not enough praises that we can give you for all the things that you've done for us and lord forgive us when we have been slow when we have diverted out of the path that you wanted us to go forgive us the things that have have made you sad concerning us lord lord just cover anything that we have done wrong with your blood that you shed at calvary lord and we just praise you for that and lord we humbly come to you humbly come to you in one accord for these requests that was given out and for those that have a prayer request in their heart be it here or be it on the on the stream for those who weren't able to to make it here lord we just grant these requests lord so that we can have more testimonies of your love in what you've done for us we praise you lord we give you all the honor and glory [Music] in christ jesus we we pray these things amen amen i don't know if you knew brother john did you know we were going to have a testimony service tonight lord is mindful of everything amen amen you may be seated this evening sing a couple songs here maybe and i had it on my heart to ask the congregation if you all had any songs you wanted to sing as a congregation as well but aaron it felt led on his heart to have just a testimony and singing tonight song specials and just whatever you all have laid on your heart we have a few that have mentioned things to us but if you have something as well maybe just um just be prepared and we'll call as we feel led and if you have something maybe just either mention it to one of the brothers or give give brother ed a note or something and we'll we'll fit it in if you've not mentioned it to somebody already our brother aaron doesn't feel led to call you so amen let's just sing the song i stand amazed in the present or my savior's love is what i know it as how marvelous how wonderful my song shall ever be [Music] i stand amazed in the presence of jesus the nazarene and wonder how he could love me a center condemned unclean how marvelous how wonderful and my song shall ever be how marvelous how wonderful is my savior's love for me for me it was in the garden he

[Music] he promised her to leave me never to leave me alone no never alone no never alone he promised never to live me never to leave me alone amen brother lyle would you just come and share what's on your heart this evening amen i remember growing up that song many times brother neil johnson would ask if anybody has a song they'd like to sing that song was brought up no never alone must be a favorite for 30 years 30 plus years i've remembered that song so many people in the congregation has asked for it amen he will never leave us amen amen sister bully yep yep god bless you good evening i promise i'll be less than an hour i don't have so many notes but i do have a couple but before i share the notes i was just thinking that this is july 31st okay so little puzzle 31st 3-1 what's 3-1 2 okay so that brings us to july 2nd and heather how old are you how old am i 72 so july 272 what happened anybody was here on july 2nd 1972 i thought we're running out of july 50 years ago july 2nd 1972 brother greene was here and brother ewald frank and they dedicated this sanctuary as tucson tabernacle that very morning and the reason that i remember that so well is because heather and i were in that service and we had our firstborn little boy with us he was 21 days old at that point he was born in new zealand but we brought him all the way here and he was dedicated that same morning so i just i just wanted to share that that little testimony but it's it's that we've had this place of worship for half a century and this building in addition to the years we spent in the other building but but one of the songs that we sing i remember brother fred barker was here and he had a song of course hallelujah we've all sung the hallelujah chorus right so but where does this word hallelujah come from and that's what got me to thinking dangerous okay so uh brother if you put up the revelation 19 scripture revelation 19 6-7 it says because this is relating to us today tonight he says i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters that's people right that's a lot of people right and as the voice of mighty thunderings they weren't soft-spoken saying hallelujah hallelujah that's that's a a greek um phonetic expression of a hebrew word alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice that's why we're here tonight and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and that's what we're doing is making ourselves ready this word alleluia what does it mean we say that what does it actually mean so i i had to look it up and and halal is praise it's it's a hebrew word halal's praise and when there's an ooh in something in hebrew like that is a suffix hebrew it's a very compact language both written and spoken so alai halalu the the makes it as an us or a we so it could be we praise or it could be praise hour okay but what is the yah and we say well that's an abbreviation for the yudhi vaave the jehovah it's americans use abbreviations in english we use abbreviations a lot of languages don't use abbreviations for things so what what what's going on here so that brought us to psalm 68 verses 3 and 4. david says let the righteous by his blood be sad and no be glad and let them mourn and rejoice before god yay let them exceedingly rejoice not just a little bit sing unto god sing praises to his name extol that means to raise up put him on a pedestal extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name yeah by his it's not an abbreviation so alleluia is praise our god we praise god it's not a con so if you ever hear the word hallelujah now you know it's derivation you know what it means you know where it came from by his name yah and rejoice before him and that brings me to the psalm that i want to share with you less than an hour less than an hour brother my friends maybe even less than a half hour and it's psalm 150. i i was sitting in the pew there this morning and i was reading that and i shared with you sister grace a little bit after service about it because i saw you in it and and i saw you in it and i saw you in it and so let's this this is a psalm that's about praise it's a last psalm it's the closing psalm in the book of psalms and it answers four key questions if you read a book sometimes you think well what's the plot the who what where why and how well this deals with the where the what the how and the who so it answers four questions about praise first verse praise ye the lord that sounds like a commandment to me not even a suggestion praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power so where where is the firmament of his power that's another way of saying everywhere there's no place you can be that it's inappropriate to praise the lord praise him everywhere everywhere like you said brother never lose your enthusiasm for the coming of the lord praise him everywhere for what verse two praise him for his mighty acts okay praise him according to his excellent greatness not just for the acts not just for what he's done but according to his excellent greatness in other words praise should be enthusiastic not pulling it should be enthusiastic well how let's go to verse 3 praise him with the sound of the trumpet i think the sax also qualifies here brother as does the clarinet not just the trumpet but uh your son plays the trumpet i remember in the mariachi and you do too then my brother noel once upon a time played the trumpet but anyway and anyway praise it with the psaltery what's the psaltery it's it's it's the liar if you've seen these little string things from ancient drawings way back yeah and the harp okay first four praise him with the timbrel that's i look that up that's tambourine sometimes we do that and dance well we haven't gotten there yet i've been to some churches where they've gotten there someday we'll get there one of these days i'll fall flat on my face in front of you and i'll get there too okay but we should praise him with stringed instruments sister liliana you're in that psalm you're fulfilling that psalm every service that you're here sister martha sister lydia all of you that share in that way where's brother matthew with guitar okay praise and whispering instruments and organs again sister grace and brother matthew and brother arnie the harmonica qualifies too that's a mouth organ right verse 5 praise him upon the loud symbols that might be a little enthusiastic for some of us praise them on the high sounding symbols but if we lack the symbols we've got these right and we can praise the lord verse six and brother lyle will get quiet and sit down who who are the ones that should praise the lord that should praise him everywhere that should praise him with enthusiasm who are the ones let everything that hath breath praise the lord praise ye the lord is anyone here breathing okay we talk about the promises of god there's also the commandments of god it's not a suggestion it's a commandment praise the lord [Applause] amen amen brother matthew mcfadden do you have a song special i just realized that you did and i wasn't thinking through that so let's i wrote that down so let's have you come up this right this time brother peter if you could help out there in the booth that would be great let's stand and sing this song i am blessed i am blessed every day that i live i am blessed i was thinking of this before he said anything so we should be able to sing this amen i am blessed i am blessed i am blessed every day that i live i am blessed when i wake up in the morning till i lay my head to rest i am blessed i am blessed i am blessed i am blessed every day that i live i am blessed when i wake up in the morning till i lay my head to rest i am blessed i am blessed one more time i am blessed i am blessed every day that i live i am blessed when i wake up in the morning till i lay my head to rest i am blessed i am blessed amen you may be seated a flat just a quick testimony i was sort of i wasn't sure what to say or sometimes you're just sitting there thinking about what's god done for me and i i realized i i hadn't i couldn't think of anything in particular and then so i was putting some thoughts down in the back but the last few weeks at work have been kind of um stressful i took a new position i've started new hours you i don't know when i'll be back on wednesday night but we'll just put it up to god because i was talking to jordan earlier it's not that you notice on wednesday that you need to be there but when you get the next sunday you start to realize that you're just you're just feeling pretty dry so i just want to put that before the lord and and so i realized the last few weeks i just i'd had a lot of worries and just stress from dealing with the new position just the work is it's different you know now i'm dealing with supervising so it's less about me being able to accomplish my job quickly and it's more about managing people to get their job done quickly and correctly and it's just a totally different way of [Music] of trying to to get things done and you know you can't be a dictator you gotta you know you gotta be real positive and i already had one incident where i if you know me personally you know i can be pretty quick with people and i i was not i had a very light touch with someone and there was tears and i was like so it was just a funny just different everything was different and then i was um so there's this one night i get home and i'm just thinking about all the problems at work and just it seemed insurmountable and just difficult and then i would just it was one of those moments where i just had this thought that i was just when was the last time i was this worried about walking with god and praying and reading my bible and so it was just this beautiful moment where god was showing me you know how to you know you let this you know you've been just kind of winging it or just letting things go by for how long and when was the last time you were worried about getting you know coming correctly to church and different things and i was just it was a it was a good moment this song is one i'd heard a couple years ago and i don't know if i ever sang it for you guys um but it just came back to mind and i have really enjoyed it so i hope this is a good song for you to sing [Music] out of the desks i cried here [Music] we'll get it sorry [Music] alright out of the depths i cry to you in darkest places i will call incline your ear to me anew and hear my cry for mercy lord [Music] were you to count my sinful ways how could i come before your throne yet for forgiveness meets my gaze i stand redeemed by grace alone i will wait for you i will wait for you on your word i will rely i will wait for you surely wait for you until my soul is satisfied so put your hope in god alone take courage in his power to save completely and forever one by christ emerging from the grave i will wait for you i will wait for you on your word i will rely i will wait for you surely wait for you until my soul is satisfied now he has come to make way and god himself has paid the price that all who trust in him today find healing in his sacrifice well i will wait for you i will wait for you all your word i will rely i i will wait for you surely wait for you until my soul is satisfied well i will wait for you i will wait for you on your words i will rely on i will wait for you surely wait for you till my soul is satisfied [Music] amen amen wherever i go i'll praise him sister sarah do you have a song tonight did you prepare if you want to maybe in a little while if you've got something we'll ask you brother peter does your wife's sister lydia have a song this evening she does okay brother peter if you want to make your way up and share what's on your heart this evening then maybe after billy peter will have sister lydia mcfadden sing a song here in a little while wherever i go i'll praise him wherever i go i'll praise him wherever i can i'll praise him for his love surrounds me like the sea [Applause] i'll praise the name of jesus lift up the name of jesus for the name of jesus lifted me wherever i go i'll praise him wherever i can i'll praise him for his love surrounds me like i see i'll praise the name of jesus lift up the name of jesus for the name of jesus lifted me wherever i go i'll praise him wherever i can i'll praise him [Music] i'll praise the name of jesus lift up the name of jesus for the name of jesus lifted me it's good to be here amen it's good to be where he is it's good to have his promises i really enjoy services like this but it's also a little bit nerve-racking when you try to think well what do i say what do i what do i sing but the problem isn't that we don't have anything to sing about or anything to say the problem is we've got so much that you know how we're going to have eternity to praise him and to share testimonies and and it's it's gonna be wonderful but just uh i've got kind of a couple testimonies ones a little bit longer one two are kind of short and then my wife and i did practice a song uh together so once the testimonies are done we'll we'll end with the song but um a couple of testimonies they're really related to this trip we just got back from and it was a long trip so i couldn't say everything but three three things that i'd like to say one of them i was thinking and um tomorrow is zion's 11 month birthday and so it's just about a year ago that lydia was very pregnant and very sore in her back and very unable to walk and you know when you're in the middle of those things and you're in the middle of those valleys it just seems like it could go on forever you know is is this the rest of our life is this the way it's gonna be um but i know so many of you prayed and so many showed your care in so many ways but then just looking where we've come since then we were able to take this trip that you know if you don't have your health you can have all the money in the world which we don't but you could have all the money in the world and you wouldn't be able to enjoy a trip like we were able to do you know and by god's grace we're able to take this trip for a long time through many countries and lydia was able to walk she was able to walk everywhere we we rarely had a car mostly we were taking the buses and we were walking and we're we we just carried what we could carry on our back and so on travel days lydia would have zion uh she would be holding him and then on her back she'd have two backpacks and i'd have two backpacks and i'd be carrying jonas and abel would be walking with his backpack and it's a lot but by god's grace she was able to do it and that's a miracle to me that's you know the trip was good but the fact that she's healed that her back is strong i couldn't thank the lord enough for that and so i just want to thank him for that and so here's that was one of the short ones there's another real short one when i'm calling lydia up i'll tell you that one but here's the longer one and it's one that i believe is still ongoing i don't know the end of this testimony but i was so excited and encouraged by it and basically what happened i'll try to make it short but we're on our way to israel we're going to dallas which is a very busy airport many people very busy and we caught we were just passing by these people you passed by so many people but they looked like us it was a man and a woman probably in their 50s or so but you know you can you can tell a christian a lot of times when you pass them and so lydia smiled and said hello and we passed by and that could have been it that's often the way it is it's just past them but they came around and found us and they said hey where are you going and and so we got to talking and it was really nice we said we're going to israel and they said well we've got if you're going to israel and you're a christian which we'd established there were both christians they said you've got to look this guy up he's our friend he said yeah sure that's that would be great and so we were able to get his contact information and we didn't know anything about him but that he was a christian and he lived in israel and we had his name and then later we didn't get his contact information right away but eventually we were able to get his contact information and so didn't really know anything about him but just believed that there was a reason that the lord had us run into him and then we're in israel for a while and uh one one little testimony we got to visit the church in tel aviv and a beautiful little church just a good spirit and we didn't know you know what to if we should sing or not but we ended up singing that song that i sing sometimes may the blood of jesus speak for me and i almost didn't but then i just we ended up doing it and then the brother the pastor gets up to speak and he's speaking on the voice of the blood can you imagine we had no idea and so we just felt that the lord was with us and was mindful of us and that he had allowed this and that they were there for a reason and so talking to our brother the pastor there in israel he said that it's it's a difficult place spiritually because of course you've got all the the people that are holding to the jewish faith as they understand it and the other people holding to the islamic faith and and so there's this kind of battle there but then even among the people that should be christians and should be you know very different from everyone else a lot of the christians there in they call the messianic communities they'll be friendly and everything to you until the point that they find out that you don't believe the trinity like they do and at that point there's actually a great division that not not from our side but from other groups that's that's kind of a non-negotiable thing if you want to be their friend and so it was interesting to hear that because i didn't know that and so finally towards the end of our trip we got we got in contact with this man that we got the number from the houston airport we said well can we meet up for coffee he said come on over to my house i thought okay this is could be really good or could be really awkward and lydia's like well you know we've got the kids and he could be really old and maybe it's not a great place for kids and that's we just went we just felt to go and and so you know you have the nervousness when you go someplace you've never been especially to meet somebody you've never met but what was amazing is how quickly when we got to his house all that was gone it was amazing how quickly we felt at home in a way that we had not felt at home in a long while except for with our brother there the pastor and we could just there was a sweetness about them there was an atmosphere about them i thought wow this is this is pretty good just from somebody you meet at an airport and so we got to talk with him and we talked a long time and so i can't tell everything but just to tell his testimony a little bit which was such a blessing to me is that this man that we met was just raised a kind of secular semi-religious jew and he ended up becoming interested in this woman that's now his wife and he didn't know that she believed in jesus he just thought she was a jew too and so he's trying to get to know her and she says well you know you've got to you've got to come to church you know i believe in jesus and so he he didn't want that but it was for him and she got him to um to look at the bible and he said when he opened the bible he could see the words and moving on the page and he said i think her name's christina he said this book is a lie and she said yeah that's what i've been trying to tell you and so he became a christian he felt the lord lead him and he he wanted to be baptized then and so he was baptized and he said he nobody really told him this but he had this this witness in himself that he felt that when he would be baptized everything would be changed that he would be different and he said he was baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost the way that they baptized in in these messianic groups and he said everything was the same he had no change and so he he was still seeking and he saw through different churches for 10 years until finally he came to somebody that could explain to him baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and he said when he was baptized this was his third time to be baptized because he had been he tried it again in the titles finally on his third time 10 years later he was baptized in the name of the lord jesus and he said he received the holy ghost and they believe they believe in one god we explain to them what we believe about the godhead and they said that's how we believe it and and it was such a confirmation because it would have been so sad to feel like we were brothers and then to get to the trinity and have that separation that i was kind of expecting but no we were able to just rejoice in in the fulfillment of that promise that if you're baptized in the name of the lord jesus shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and there was such a fellowship there and he said he's got a group there that he fellowships with about 120 people that that's how they believe they're many of them are jewish they're over there they believe baptism of the holy ghost they believe baptism in the name of the lord jesus but here's the funny thing is they live about half an hour from our brother that's a pastor over there and they've never known about each other so maybe two takeaways from this testimony god is doing great things and the second a lot of times we don't know about it it can be just half an hour away but see we only know about the things that we need to know about a lot of times and i believe that things are happening and i believe salvation will quickly turn to the jews and i don't know if this how this plays into that but just because you don't see things going on doesn't mean they're not going on that's true god's moving he he has people and and what was really cool is um we had just before we got to meet this brother we just driven through mount carmel where you've got the the mount carmel showdown and you've got elijah and then right after that elijah says well you know i'm the only one lord and then it says if you read there it says there's seven thousand that have not bowed their knees to baal right and i believe god's still doing that he's still reserving a people to himself that are not bowing to the doctrines of man the thoughts of man but he's keeping a people true to himself and nobody needs to know who those people are but god himself and just let us be part of that number but it was a real encouragement to us just to know that the lord was doing that and he didn't have to show us but he just let us experience that amen that if we were to have a list of things that we'd like to see in christian israel of course we want to see the places but if we could see real christians in israel that would be the thing that we'd want to see the most and we got to see it by god's grace just by what you could call a chance encounter in the houston airport but i believe there was a reason for it and so that was a real blessing so if my wife would come as i tell the third testimony was that we were in oslo which is in norway and they say that it's kind of the the most crooked greedy place in norway and lydia has her phone with her credit cards and everything all in the phone case her driver's license and she left this phone in the in the bathroom at the main train station in oslo and with some people from around there and we said well we lost this we left it there and the one was not a believer right now he said it's gone you'll never see that again but the other was a believer he said oh i do that all the time and let's go look for it you know he was he had a good the two had two totally different reactions to it the one these were brothers one brother said it's gone sorry for use thinks to be you the other said oh it's it's okay and by god's grace we went and found it and everything was there and it was a small thing but god's mindful despair that falls he's mindful of the little details it was such a blessing and encouragement to us so uh we're gonna try to sing the song lydia says i have to tell you we didn't get a chance to really practice it so i guess we're supposed to blame it on that if if i mess up here but god bless you yes [Music] we were wandering in the desert with our souls so starved and weak we were hungry for a homeland we did not know how to see it but we lifted up our voices to the only one who hears and the god of mercy came brought us we near locked out of the garden our backs bent down in pain in the shadow of death's darkness we were slaves to sin and blame and we cried out in our labor to the only one who hears and the god of mercy wiped away our tears oh give thanks to the lord for his love endures forever we were wandering and lost and our father brought us home to our safe dwelling place to a feast of joy and laughter o give thanks to the lord for he is good we were fools in our rebellion in a hunger strike of pride we were sick and growing closer to the death we should have died then he heard of our rebellion and he called us all by names and the god of glory took away our shame oh give thanks to the lord for his love endures forever we were wandering and lost and our father brought us home to our safe dwelling place to a feast of joy and laughter or give thanks to the lord for he is good we were far out on the ocean making wealth and chasing dreams but the waves of great destruction brought us trembling to our knees then we cried like drunken sailors to the only one who hears and the god of comfort took away our tears so give thanks to the lord for his love endures forever we were wandering and lost and our father brought us home to a safe dwelling place to a feast of joy and laughter o give thanks to the lord he is good o give thanks to the lord for his love endures forever we were wandering and lost and our father brought us home to a safe dwelling place to a feast of joy and laughter o give thanks to the lord for he is good amen amen does anyone have a testimony they would like to share sister nina you want to come up here or you want us to bring a mic to you okay well if you want to come up front this is such a nice service just to hear what the lord is doing and how he leads his people and just shows his kindness i just wanted to share this um as quickly as i could about stephen and i'm moving here um so about a year ago we knew we were going to come well before that but about a year ago in january we thought we're going to move to arizona we were praying and we just had certain things that needed to be met obviously and um so last january i believe it was we're like we're going to move we're going to move and then we're like we don't have any money how are we going to move and i remember calling my mom and saying and i the lord is helping me a lot but i tend to worry and you know just forget what i'm gonna do and i called mom and i remember her telling me why don't you just take five dollars put it in savings or put it somewhere in the name of the lord so i did that and i said well okay five dollars i mean what's that gonna do but i did it and within three months that had gone up to i believe almost five thousand dollars just through some things that worked out and covid was a blessing in financial ways just different things that but there was different things that uh happened while we were still searching for the lord's will and one of them i wanted stephen it to be you know coming from different churches coming from different backgrounds i wanted to be sure that he would be happy and i in my heart i prayed and said lord i know he's not going to come if he's not going to be truly happy and i don't want him to come if he's truly going to be happy if it's not your will so i prayed and i really had it on my heart and one day we were driving home from church and just quiet not saying anything and then he just was driving he's looking straight ahead and he says i'm ready when i go you're ready he's like i'm ready to move and i had just been praying that and i was of course so excited right now right now and he was like well no not right now and i ruined the moment but just things like that there's other things that are a little more personal where i would just go to the room shut the door and pray and say lord here's something else if we're supposed to move this has to be answered and every time it was met so he couldn't find a job couldn't find a job geek squad was where he was working nothing was open nothing's open so the year went by and i was like we're going to be moved by the fall we're going to be moved by this time and this time and stephen and my mom was when my dad too was like we're gonna move when the lord it's time for the lord to to let you move so anyway we get to the end of the year and suddenly bam he hasn't he we have a job he has a job with geek squad over here he just had been looking online nothing was coming up and the lord one day just told him go look online go look online and he didn't the next day he went there was an opening he applied he got the job so we get here he has a job well then we couldn't we're like oh my gosh we have i think it was three weeks two and a half to three weeks to find a place to live and we've moved over there five years ago so we the economy was different everything was different we cannot find a place to live and we have a dog who is part pitbull and i didn't know arizona has a pit bull law couldn't find a place and we were getting really stressed because we loved that dog and we were like what are we gonna do what are we gonna do i called my dad and he kept telling me because i was like dad can we just live in the shed like i will live in the shed and he always the same answer the lord will provide weight on the lord so it was two and a half weeks so we needed to move and i had a lot of anxiety like a lot of anxiety and i was laying in bed one day after work and i was just talking to a friend and i was like hey i know you have a trip a tree house in your yard can we live in the tree house just joking because she's always had this dream and she texts me she's nina i'm trying to write my place out and i go what and she's like i'm moving and i need to rent my place out so i call her and like are you joking and she goes no this is the answer to prayer for me i don't know who to give it to i don't trust anybody she goes but i trust you we've worked together for years we were friends and we had a place she had everything moved out within two weeks we had a place to live no security deposit she didn't care about the dog because she had a pitbull and we had a place to live so we get here and he's well i had extreme anxiety like to the point where i i couldn't do anything i couldn't work i couldn't just couldn't do anything and he was working but he was only getting about 30 hours a week it was hard and um then the anxiety became so strong that um i just couldn't handle it i couldn't handle it and my sister one of my sisters told me she said you know i think the devil's trying to steal your joy this has been something you've been wanting you've both been wanting and now the devil's trying to steal it away from you so we just kept praying holding on and holding on to where we living in catalina it's really beautiful and at first i was like oh my gosh i don't want to live all the way over there and it's so much dirt and just like i don't want to be there but behind where we live is the most beautiful place and there's trails and the mountains are right there and the sunshine sunrise it's just beautiful and i had so much anxiety and i would just go out and walk and pray and walk and pray and walk and pray and cry to the lord and i walked miles and miles and then it hit me one day the lord gave this to you he knew that you were going to go through this he knew you know you you pray for this blessing and then all sudden it comes and this trial comes with it and you're like well i don't want that i just want the blessing but the lord has used this move to work something in my life that i've been trying to conquer since i was a child and the anxiety came so strong and i'm almost done but one night it was so strong and i don't know i always want to share testimony about anxiety just because i know that sometimes it can still be a taboo thing and sometimes people don't quite understand it but sometimes it just comes so strong you don't know what to do and i had it to the point where my body was convulsing and it was like it was trying to come out of me and i was walking with my dog one day and uh i noticed my chest started itching and it was red and my aunt had just had shingles too and i got back to the house and i told my my husband and my mother-in-law and my father-in-law is like she's like you have she i bet you you have shingles just from this dress and i said no no i'm not i'm not gonna take that so i went to the room and i laid on the bed and this for me was a huge i guess step in my spiritual journey because i've never been to a place where i said like brother green used to say though god slay me yet i'll trust him i remember him crying one day up here because he had lost his voice and he was saying though god slayed me yet i'll trust him so i had i was breaking out and i had so much anxiety like i said my body was just convulsing and i lay on the bed and i said lord i can't handle it i can't but if you see fit for me to go through this then i'll take it and i laid on the bed i turned on a sermon and right then brother branham was saying something along i don't remember exactly but it was along that line so i turned off the what i was listening to and i raised my hand and i started singing though god slayed me and i'll trust him and i found into the most beautiful sleep i just slept so calmly and the whole time stephen was like i don't know why you worry you don't have shingles you know option goes way bird and the next morning i woke up and i go it's gone it's gone and i had texted my friend too and she's like you have jingles because i had jingles you have shingles so i texted i just told that stephen it's gone it's gone the redness was gone and the day after that the burning was gone and it was gone completely so anyway so through all that then stephen was able to get the gig squad job just kept going lower and lower with hours messing up everything and then he got the job with my dad and now he's like overflowing with work and then the last thing um was i had so much anxiety i couldn't work and then i got went and applied at a place and i was like lord how am i gonna work how am i gonna work my very first day of work i drove up to work and i had no anxiety i was able to work through the day and had a wonderful day and i'm still there and the lord has just been helping me overcome and overcome to a place where i believe believing for my complete healing but the one thing that i was going to share real quick in catalina when i was walking around walking around just crying out to the lord i just looked up in the mountains and the sunrise and it was like the lord gave this to you i don't know if i said sorry the lord gave this to you he knew you were going to go through this he knew you needed a way of escape and he knows you love nature this is just for you so if you live in catalina it's not for you it's just for me all of that is just for me because the lord gave it to me [Applause] amen amen someone else have one sister sarah you want to come and prepare to sing who else has a testimony sister elizabeth sister beth sister naomi too sometimes we just think well it's just a little thing the lord has done for me but what brother john said you know even if it's little just if it can encourage somebody and i just wanted to share what i was going to ask that we sing a song because the other night i was the lord has helped me so much with anxiety depression i really know that he has touched me i gave a testimony what happened to me in february when brother joe adams was here and just the difference it's been but sometimes i just get in my own head too much and i just got discouraged the other night like last week and i was just like i'm done i give up and immediately and i know it wasn't me immediately the lord's the lord has been so good to me i feel like traveling on and i was like i can't complain he's been so good to me and so i just started singing that and just thanking him and pretty soon i wasn't thinking about all the things that were discouraging or upsetting he's been so good to me and just another quick little thing i wanted to share just what brother peter was saying i was like i don't know if i should share this because it feels like i don't want to glory in myself it's nothing to do with me but what he's saying is sometimes we don't know what is happening in my little sunday school room my sunday school class we've been reading the book of acts we've been going through the book of acts for almost a year and it has been so good and so the other day we did a lesson on um them taking the cloth from and and using it as prayer cloths um you know the power of god with was with paul so mightily and so i just felt to make the kids little prayer cloths and i'm a terrible sower i'm not good at it so i was trying and i was like i give up i this must not be of god because i can't even sew these little things so i put it aside well that evening it just came back so strong to make these little prayer cloths and i was like okay i'm going to do it i'm just going to figure it out and kids aren't going to care that they're sloppy i'm going to do my best so i made these little prayer cloths and we had our lesson and then i had my lesson that night with chloe and asher and chloe and ash when i gave them to them chloe has a little bit of anxiety at times of or bad dreams and she got it and she said as soon as i gave it to her she said this is going to help me so much help me with my thoughts and my dreams and asher got his and he said god is never going to leave me and i was just so overjoyed i mean it was just that's what i wanted them to see that's what i want them to experience and so i had given them to my nieces my other nieces and so the kids had a sleepover and my sister sent me a picture and she said all the kids have their prayer cloth to sleep with tonight they had taken him to the sleepover i went to my niece's house and i looked under her pillow and there was her little prayer cloth tucked and she asked me for another one she wanted to put it in her dad's traveling bag because we're believing he's going to come in and he travels a lot and she wanted to put one in his back for wherever he goes and i just think sometimes we just think we're doing a little thing we're just doing our little part but god can take it and use it and i just i'm so thankful what he's doing in their little lives go ahead sister sarah sing a song for us yeah then we'll have sister naomi give her testimony sister hope do you have a song for us tonight okay god bless you um i just wanted to say a quick testimony for something kind of along the lines of what peter was talking about the godhead and also what brother matthew said about the lord just speaking to him in his own life and quiet time and i was home the other day there's a little while ago and i was on youtube watching different videos and sometimes i'll look up kind of some apologetic things about defending christian faith in our doctrine and we already know of course that godhead is one of the big divisions and what separates us very clearly from a lot of other christian beliefs and i came across this video thing was like two hours long i did not even get halfway through this and i was just wanting to see what people say what they believe about the godhead and it was the most convoluted conflicting confusing thing i think i've ever heard on it and i've heard a lot so i was i got off of that i just got discouraged to turn it off and i said lord i want the truth i want to be able to share the truth what's the truth about the godhead you know and as i was sitting there i hadn't thought of this song for years we used to sing it way back when with brother nail i remember and the words just immediately started to play in my mind just so softly so gently the lord just answered me right in that moment and it was oh who do you say that i am and whence do you say i came do you know the father and can you tell his name and jesus dwells the fullness of the godhead don't you see jesus is the great i am and the great i am is he and i say thank you lord that's all it's that simple and of course we know that's a revelation i just thank the lord in that moment he answered me right then and there and just the quietness of even in my own heart and mind i need to send that song right to my mind so i just want to give him praise that he he answers those questions that you have in your heart and i'm grateful for that i'm actually going to sing this a cappella so it's just called children of the living god so i've never done this acapella but we'll try it children of the living god come and sing sing out loud children of the living god sing to the living god sing of the wonders he has made burden flight falling raining of the wonders he has made sing to the living god

ed could you bring that mike to sister naomi here sister hope if you want to make ready to sing a song while sister naomi's giving a testimony here sweetheart did you have a song tonight did you prepare okay anyone else have a testimony this evening all righty brother go ahead sister hammy mine's another testimony of the little things but more in the natural and the spiritual my dad talked about this morning sometimes to go back to your childhood just remind yourself of things um this story goes back about 15 years maybe um i drink pepsi i love pepsi after covid i can't drink it because it tastes like chemicals which is probably healthier for me but i used to get it from circle k and um where i worked there was two circle k's and close to cincinnali went to one of them because of how easy it was to get in and out of so i was going to go at lunch time and for some reason the thought came to me i should go to the other one and i'm like why would i go to the other one it's very hard i have to make a u-turn just not the flow of traffic like why so i went to the one i normally would and i walk in and the pepsi machine is out of order and i'm so upset so i'm like well i guess i'm going to the other one well back then pepsi circle k started redoing their fountain machines and not only do they have cubed ice but they added crushed ice which to me makes the soda taste that much better so i walk in and i had just installed this brand new machine double-sided cubed and crushed ice and i was like lord it truly is the little thing sometimes and i think of this story often as silly as it sounds but it means a great deal to me [Applause] sister hope we'll have her sing a song and then sister martha you can give your testimony [Music] there's a lie down on the hill that overlooks [Music] life safe and when i'm tossed it sins out a light that i might clearly see and the light that shines in darkness [Music] [Laughter] [Music] if it wasn't for [Music] and i thank god for the lighthouse [Music] jesus is the lighthouse i've seen he has shown his light around i might clearly see if it wasn't for the lighthouse tell me where [Music] everybody that was about us the big ships don't sell this way anymore there's [Music] [Music] when just [Music] that stands [Music] to him [Music] he has [Music] if it wasn't [Music] i think [Music] is [Music] might clearly see if it wasn't for the lighthouse [Music] sister martha um i thought i was just going to share the um i know that i'd put in a prayer request for my dad because he'd had the cancer this spot on his nose that originally the dermatologist was like you know looks fine it looks fine then it was it doesn't look fine um and uh he went and took a closer look at it and he says you're going to need some plastic surgery afterwards this is deeper than i thought um but it's you know it's it does not look like this is a the bad kind this looks like it's you know this is kind of normal you know it should be easy to get and i know that my dad was just he's like this just right after dealing with everything um and on monday he had the surgery they were able to get everything not a problem went straight into the plastic surgery and just everything is seems like it should be perfectly fine so i definitely appreciate the prayers i wasn't thinking about this at all but when she talked about the lord being mindful over something as small as soda on the night that my mom passed away i had spent the whole day there at the house and i didn't want to leave until she was gone and so after she was gone i told jordan i said i need some time to myself and i was doing okay and and i made the mistake of looking up some photos and some stuff and i ran across a project that i was supposed to get done for her that she'd asked me to do and i just just came from nowhere you know you just sit there and you're just agony and um after a little bit of time i just kind of was able to calm down and i was like that's kind of rough on the throat i need something cold to drink you know that would feel really good and i had seen a sonic so i went to the sonic and i sat there for probably 20 or 30 minutes with the window down in december in flagstaff it actually felt really good but i never got to the point of being able to get in order because like they were closing down or whatever and i guess i'd come there after that point so i was like you know what there's a little gas station just at the bottom of the hill from where my parents are generally those i think my mom would go and get slushies there and i went there and i looked around and they had slushies and i just got a little slushy and i was looking should i get a little snack whatever now i just want the slushie and um took it up to the counter and the guy looks at me he goes is this all i said he goes you're all good merry christmas and that just just meant so much to me just that little gesture and i just drove around the neighborhood because i still wasn't ready to go back and i went to go up into the neighborhood where my parents had first moved when they came to flagstaff and as i drove up into the neighborhood about where they lived my mom would always tell us there's this herd of elk that would come through the neighborhood and they would call it the continental elk herd because they couldn't be touched and there in the middle of the road was the herd of elk just they owned the road and so i just sat there and i watched them a bit before i went back to the house and just you know i don't think i really slept that well but you know it was just that little bit and then after mom's memorial service i was like you know i would really love to be able to thank the clerk but that little gesture meant so much to me and i think we stopped there to get gas and i was like i'm just going to run in i'm just going to run in and i took i went to the clerk and i said i was here on christmas eve i don't know who was working the evening shift he goes that was me i said you have no idea that little gesture meant so much to me and i just told him i said that just my mom had passed away and that meant just the world to me and he he came around the counter and just gave me a hug and i just i don't know i i guess i think of those little things like those are maybe those little moments of that cold cup of water that the lord will reward him for later but that just when you told the soda story i'm like great i got my own and i'm not sure i want to share this but i'm just thankful that the lord was just so mindful of me of just that little bit in the moment where i just didn't know i needed it as brother peter said it's sometimes difficult to have services like this because there's so many testimonies you think of as people are talking and i mean just as she was sharing in others i've thought of three or four you know and we're up here all the time as brothers and so sometimes i feel like what the congregation is share but brother ed would you take it to the brother there in the back brother i'm sorry you we met a few weeks ago and i forgot your name but you just feel free to introduce yourself again to the whole congregation it's really great to have you be attending with us and it's good to have you brother thank you my name is dominique baker and i give honor to god and for all you his saints and i'd try to keep it the short version your witness is very effective i thought i thought i was found but like nina said about her husband you know getting so religiously confused and everything i was very lost for about 30 years and a message believer decided to share this message with me at a public library here in tucson and so i didn't know i was so lost and i had so many things to repent of and i've seen the lord changing a lot of things around in my life and um so keep keep this witness because uh i wanted to say also brother one of your brother chico's relatives tried to share it with me after high school uh long story short one of our parents brought us to this church when we were teenagers and but we didn't know the message um i'm not trying to be funny we thought it was the foot wash church because every time they brought us my parent brought us it was put wash time and everything so that was when i was a teenager but then um i don't know if you all remember brother uh brother dennis uh ballard you if you guys remember brother dennis ballard he used to drive uh brother branham's books to my house and and i never did get to read all of them i couldn't understand it that good but this message believer made it pretty easy for me and they provided some tapes or something to listen to and i had no idea i was that lost and i got found in those tapes about two years ago back in april and uh then i just uh i decided to make lots of changes and i'm really trying to bring my family into this message and so don't stop your witness every time i see a message believer i can spot him out like pepper and salt and i'm like i know you and i'm trying to be down with you okay so thank you god bless you amen [Applause] amen amen let's just stand we'll turn the surface over to brother aaron and however he feels led to close let's sing he is able he is able i know he is able i know the lord is capable to carry me through it's an f i believe he is able he is able i know my lord is able i know my lord is able to carry me through oh he is able he is able i know my lord is able i know my lord is able to carry me through oh he healed the brokenhearted came to walk again and cause the blind to see he's able he's able i know my lord is able i know my lord is there to carry me through how do you know he's able because he's done it that's the greatest testimony of yours because the lord has been good to me amen brother john yeah so i've wanted to say this for a long time and here i am you know with this project and if each of you who gave a testimony tonight would write it down because it's easier for you to write it down and i can translate it easier okay just just write it down it doesn't because i got what they call natural dragon and i can i can read what you have have written and it makes a lot easier than trying to hear it but i have a testimony about you know every once in a while and we haven't had one for a long time that we've had a prayer line okay and about three or four months ago i was a little hesitant to get one the prayer lines and i did and my condition was if if some of you might know some medical terms but it was hematuria and hematuria hema means blood tyrion means in the urine so i had blood in the urine and you can have two types you can have micro imagery which is you can't see they have these little dipsticks you put in and you know it shows that you have blood cells in your urine which is not normal and not good i had macro imagery it means i could see it and i had it for about a week know and i prayed about it and it got worse i mean it was to the point that i was almost about to go to the emergency room and there's all kinds of reasons why that happens and a majority of them were not good so i went through the prayer line next day still had hematuria it seemed like it was getting worse second date still had hematuria insane was saying you know nope you got to go to the emergency room well i was a little stubborn i said no by his stripes i'm healed and within three days after a week of hemi material going to the prayer line three days later i was cured amen this has been probably about i don't know four or five months now so yeah praise god i give you glory to god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he changes now as you listen to testimonies they bring memories and things of of what you've gone through what you've done but you never know what a simple gesture a simple uh acknowledgement will do for somebody that you carry you know and i always think of that scripture well you gave me a cold cup of water when i was in pr you know and they asked him when did we do this to you and he said when you did this to one of my little ones you were doing it to me so you're not doing it uh in the sense to bring honor and glory or to yourself or anything like that you're just doing what god has asked you to do and he gets the glory for it and someone reaps the benefits of it and that's us when you when you give god honor and glory and you praise him it pleases him and he draws an eye to you i think of that sister had he right when she told brother branham that is nothing but the truth it pleased god so much as someone took him at his word and he said give her whatever she wants he doesn't change he's never changed he's the same yesterday today and forever brother joel your boys are back there i don't know if you noticed that so it was good to see them come in today you love the lord jesus you love the lord jesus amen has he been good to you you know sometimes um the girls will tell me everybody's gonna think that brother aaron's daughters have all kinds of problems or something we're always given testimony i said well thank the lord you know and i appreciate that but it goes back to how we were raised my father my mother always shared with us the goodness of god the ability of god he's a healer he's a keeper you know and and some people say how do you know this because i've seen it it works and i can testify of it about where sister holius is standing right there brother bobby rourke was here one night and i had some real hard pain on my left foot it hurt to walk and the doctor said you got gout well i really didn't know what it was but i know it hurt and brother bobby was speaking brother bobby words and a rourke i'm sorry there and he said if you have something that hurts you stand up right now claim your healing and move that part that hurts i stood right about where she said i stuck my leg out and i started moving the ankle like this and it has never hurt again because god is able you take him at his word and those are the things that we share to one another those how we encourage one another he is more than able amen brother arne i had felt in my heart to call you up to close the service in prayer and i know that brother arnie's been dealing with with brother l peterson and if someone holds a special place in this church that's brother al peterson for the many years that he has served and done done what he did and and how he treats people and how he treated us in in even myself when i first came to the tabernacle we were just a young family coming i i think rachel had my youngest had just been born and and i was just remembering having a a warm uh a greeting from brother l peterson and them just making you feel right at home and i always thought i did nothing to deserve this to be you know but he treated me like i could almost say like a a nephew you know just somebody that and to sit under his his mentoring and all i think back about it god was good to us and allowed that to see him and i know that brother arne's been taking care of dad and sister rachel and the family and i've wondered what that's going to be the time if we're here long enough well i will be doing that same thing because if time goes on we'll all come to that place but to have a testimony like that that others speak well that others have received from it's been a blessing and i'll say this and i don't mean it to raise brother ornie or the peterson family up in a way but i thank god for the peterson family in this church they they have given of themselves over over and over and it's it's you get you get tired you get frustrated it all happens but i appreciate and it comes from brother arne and ancestor peterson from the brother l i'm sorry sister peter sister minnie who taught it to them and now and i do appreciate each one of them sister grace sister lily coming up and doing what they do brother jordan coming up and and working with the sound as much as he's done and um each one of them and i know sister rachel they do a lot of in the office and when we have a fellowship here they're very involved and it takes a lot of time and again i just want to say thank you to the peterson family god bless them thank you very much we have a wonderful heavenly father and he just doesn't fail like brother brown says he cannot fail so that's what i'm trying to do is i love brother dominique's testimony i remember brother dennis ballard getting after us up here does anybody remember that we're all probably different now i remember one time brother green says who's here from day one and sister green was the only one that raised her i know there were others but at that time and and he said what are you doing here so thank you for all being here and um you know it's something to be alive at this time and i enjoyed your sermon about the sand and the silica and the because my dream has been to build a mud house before i lived here in arizona they call this the old adobe you know dirt cheap so anybody could afford a house anybody could afford a wife have their own business their own house their own garden but so far i am i say i am i've got a helper building but my first building and i've been wanting i've been dreaming about this for decades and when i was a kid i built house little forts we called them underground fort on the ground for in the tree fort forts and we just i just enjoyed building things but i should have probably did that instead of fooling around for all these years but here we are so thank you all for coming it's really nice to be here and i'm supposed to pray not talk god bless you lord god we're just so thankful that you're so mindful of every little thing that we think and we ought to look at some things you did i thought how did you do that it should give us confidence lord but we could kind of carnal or the animal in us lord we just wanna we're looking for that day of redemption when our bodies are changed we'll have to deal with ourselves in that respect anymore but we can love you and have everything

ideas is i'll love you if you love me i'll love you if you'll do this but god took care of it all well we didn't even know about it he did it anyways because he first loved us and you know before you go greet one another say god bless you tell him i love you tell them you're my brother you're my sister some of you like to take off right away i'm going to ask you to stay in at least shake somebody's hand today and say goody so brother lyle and sister heather you start first going down that way [Music] and everybody kind of just follow them out and shake one another's hands and i think
