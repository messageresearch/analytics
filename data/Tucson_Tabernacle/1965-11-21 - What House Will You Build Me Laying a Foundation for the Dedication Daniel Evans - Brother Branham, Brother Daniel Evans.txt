Are you staying in Tucson &gt;&gt; for two days? &gt;&gt; For two days. &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you. It's an honor to have you with us tonight. Welcome. We're going to tonight we are going to listen to our original church dedication. And this happened 60 years ago almost to the day. Brother Brandham and brother Green dedicated this this church not in this building, another building, but we claim it. It's the same Tucson Tabernacle that was dedicated way back then. for um for some of the I don't see any new people James maybe uh maybe maybe you some of the history here is uh the founder of our church brother Perry Green uh he was very close with a wonderful man named William Brandham prophet of God and tremendous ministry way back in the 50s and 60s and this church was founded in a very very special way. Tonight we're going to hear the dedication of the church and then we are going to have our 60-y year anniversary and and rededication of the church Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We'll have those meetings looking really I'm really really looking forward to those. I want to give a little bit of a background to what's going on for this sermon that we're going to listen to tonight. Brother Brandham, uh, I'll start with my grandfather. I was very, very close to Brother Brandon, my dad and my family, and he lived down in Georgia. And he always wanted to move up to Jeffersonville. and he would ask, "Brother Brandham, I'd like to come up and and be there with you in Jeffersonville." And brother Brandham would always say, "No, Brother Evans, I want you to stay in Georgia right now. I feel that that's that's the best thing for you to do." And Brother Brandon would come down and stay with my family really since like around 1950 or early 50s. They're very, very close. And he would every once in a while he'd say, "Brother Brandham, you know, I'd like to be close to you. I'd like to drive all of this way every weekend from Georgia all the way to southern Indiana." And brother Brandham would just kind of say, "Well, you know, I do whatever you want, but I would wait." And then in 1962, Brother Brandham called up my grandpa and he said, "Brother Evans," he said, "you still want to move to Jeffersonville." and he says, "Yeah, I'd like to." And he says, "Well, if it was me," he said, "I'd move to Tucson." He said, "Because I'm moving to Tucson." So, my grandpa and the family, they uh sold the business in Georgia. And Brother Brandham found a station, a service station on Park Avenue, not too far from here. And he said, he told my grandpa, he said, "This would be a nice place for the brothers to come together and be able to fellowship with each other during the day and whatever time they want to come together." He said, "I wish I had a place that was just kind of a meeting place for all the brethren to come together and just enjoy themselves." And he found that station over on Park Avenue. And so my grandfather bought the station and he ran that station for a while. And you're going to hear brother Brandham in this sermon. I've listened to the sermon, I don't know, four or five times in the past few weeks. You're going to hear brother Brandham talk about this church giving the people a place to go to church, a place to fellowship. And it's people from really from all over the country. It's brother Green is from Bumont, Texas. Then um my uh my grandpa was from Georgia. My my mom's family did the same thing. They they moved out here. My my other grandfather was a deacon for brother Brandham. And uh they started uh grandpa told me that they started a lot of the leaders in the church started having dreams that they should also move to Tucson. So that there was many of them that made the decision also to move here. and uh this church provided them a place to go. And you'll hear at the end towards the end of the sermon, brother Brandham says that or um during the sermon a couple times he says that, you know, it gives the people a place to go so they're not the kids aren't out riding their bikes on Sunday and they they don't basically disrespect Sunday. He wanted them to be in church. And this place provided that provided that for my family, from my ancestors, and for many of yours. And and um maybe even I don't I doubt anyone was there when brother Random dedicated this church many years ago, but it provided a place for the people to go and fellowship just like my grandpa's station gave the brothers a chance. have have a nice place of fellowship. Friends, fellowship's important. It's important that that we are together. It's important that we come together as many times as we can to come to church. And it's important that we are also together when we're not in church. It's important to just see each other and encourage each other. Go to lunch with each other. Have have dinner. Do do the things. Go hiking. Enjoy Tucson. En enjoy each other's fellowship. It gives us strength. The Bible tells us, it says, don't neglect that the assembling together. Um especially as you see the day approaching. And that's not just going to church. Going to church is is the the the biggest part of it, but it's also being together. And how many times did the brethren get together at that service station and just laugh and talk about give each other's testimonies and how important that was. And then the most important place really was this place that brother Green had it on his heart to move here and to start this church. And it was tremendous. Really was. You're gonna hear Brother Brandham talk about a man named Jack Moore. Jack Moore was a pastor in Shreveport, Louisiana. He was a longtime friend of brother Brandon. Very long time. Do you remember the story in I believe it was around the mid40s, maybe around 1947 around there where Brother Brandham was in Oregon and there was a man that came in that wanted to disrupt the service and was going to take a swing at Brother Brandham in the pull pit. And the man came running down the aisle to take him out and brother Brandham called upon the name of the Lord and the man fell down right at his feet. You remember that story? Jack Moore saw that he was there and another man that you might know his name TL Osborne. Both of them, these are James, these are great evangelists back in the 1950s. Both of them saw this happen. Jack Moore got on the phone to this other man that you might know his name named Gordon Lindsay and he said, "Hey, you gotta get up here because this is something special. This is a big deal. This man is praying for the sick and all these people are getting healed. This just happened." So Gordon Lindsay came into the picture and he eventually became Brother Bram's campaign manager and Jack Moore a close friend. And this was uh Brother Green knew all of those people. He was friends with them because of the Christian businessman. I wish I could have I wish I could have talked with brother Green about about these men and about all that he knew in dealing with these these brothers they um so after this sermon that we're going to hear tonight when brother Green brother Brandham dedicated this church then brother Brandham and I think he mentions it in the sermon he drives to Shrivefeport Louisiana to um have a series of meetings there and while he was there he pre I mean he preached some of the really that series in shreport is just wonderful one of the sermons that he preached I believe was preached by prophecy and uh sister hope that song in the wings of a snow white dove I've told this story before you all know it but I'm going to tell it again um because I like it brother Brandham and my dad and my grandfather were together in Georgia, I believe it was, and brother Brandham said, "Have you heard that new song on the radio by Ferland Husky called On the Wings of a Snow White Dove?" It was a popular um the country music uh radio radio would play it and uh it's just a well you heard the song that Sister Hope sang and my grandpa and my dad said yeah you know we've heard it and brother Brandham said I have a message I'm going to preach and he said I'm going to title it on the wings of a snow white dove and he says when you hear me preach that sermon he said you know it's my time to go and that was in I think it was in 1961 one is when that song came out as a brand new song. Then fast forward to the dedication of our church in 1965. November 21st, 1965. Brother Brandham says that I'm about to go to Shreveport. And he goes to Shreveport and he preaches a sermon called On the Wings of a Snow White Dove. My dad was there. My grandpa was there. and they didn't remember when they were there that he had told them this years before that it was his time to to go when when the sermon was preached. Then brother Brandham preaches those sermons and he even says in that sermon he says this is a memorial service [snorts] and he had a prayer line and Jack Moore came up the one that he's going to mention all of his old many of brother Bram's old friends came up and they had a prayer line and they prayed for the people that was that was again that was just a few days after the sermon we're going to hear tonight brother Brandham came back to Tucson uh he went to uh he went to California and went to Yuma's always gone. Came back to Tucson and within a month of when he preached this sermon uh the on the wings of a snow white dove sermon and then within a month and a few days of this sermon he was in a tragic car wreck and died. And I believe this church was very very important to brother you're going to hear it tonight how important it was to brother Brad. He preached the series in Shreport preached a a sermon in um Yuma a wonderful sermon called the rapture. came back, preached um ministered with brother Green communion on December 12th, 1965 and then was few days later was driving back home back to Jeffersonville and was in a car wreck and then died on Christmas Eve in 1965. sermon we're going to listen to tonight was leading up to to that um Jack Moore, Brother Brandham, he mentions this twice in this sermon about brother Green and it to me is just striking what brother Brandham says. He says this, I mean, right when he gets going, second the second paragraph, he says this. I don't want to take brother Green's time here because I heard brother Green several times speak and I will and I certainly was influenced and as he brought the word of the Lord to us and so humble about it. Listen to this. Yesterday, brother Brand speaking about brother Green yesterday. He said, "I don't get the word from the Lord as maybe it would come in Revelation as it's been sent, but said, I like to stress on what has been said." He said, "Like when Paul wrote something in the Bible, I come here to stress on what he said." Said, "I have no message only to stress on what's been what's already been said from the Lord." Brother Brandham says, "Now, that was really remarkable. a young fellow like that and say and make a remark like that. Then later on, brother Brandham comes back to it. It made such an impression on brother Random and as his word brother Randman later on he says this and as his word said the message doesn't come to me through the giving of of the inspiration as it does maybe to some of us but he said I am here to back up what God has given. What a statement, Brother Brandham said. And I was listening, I've been listening to this, like I said, over over and over for the past month. And I mentioned that I had that experience with it was almost like brother Green was in front of me and I knew that he was suffering. I knew that he was hurt because some of the things that he was saying and it was a time that of just horrible turmoil that there there was these fights with the copyright and and all of these problems and he was brother Green was just being hit. He was being attacked. And as I was I had that experience with brother Green and I just wanted to tell him that I really just appreciated it. I really appreciated what he was trying to do. And from what I've heard brother Green speak and it's something that really hits me um hard and and sometimes I I get I almost resent some people doing this and I've never heard brother Green do it in in the sermons that I've listened to. I don't feel like brother Green ever took, at least I've never heard him take what brother Brandham said and then tried to tell you what brother Brandham meant when he said it. I just feel like he had too much respect to do that. He always pointed to him. He always pointed to what he said and he used his own experiences to point people to the prophet. And I think that's a good legacy to have. And brother Brandham said it on this tape. He said that he he said that what brother Green was doing. And then for the next 50 years after that, Brother Green would go all over the world and point back to Brother Brown. And he did it better than anyone else did in my opinion. He lifted he lifted brother Bram's ministry up. He pointed back to him. He gave his the testimonies that he had. He used them to promote this man's ministry. And I think he did an absolutely outstanding job. And in fact, in fact, I think he did not just an outstanding job. I don't think anyone could compare to what he did. in and what brother Green again using what he had learned using his own experiences and doing exactly what brother Brandham said in the tape that we're going to hear tonight for 50 years he did it. man has my respect very much so and I will give I'll give as I was praying about this and as I was studying on these things really over the past month um one one experience that I have kept coming to mind and really it has to do with this church and I used to come to this church every once in a while when I dating Stephanie and um then of course we moved to Jeffersonville when we got married. But uh this one hits me and it's something that this church and especially Brother Green is responsible for. And that is in 2000 I believe it was 2012 that a Jewish man I was working in the ministry in Jeffersonville and a Jewish man called And his conversation with me really shook me up because basically he was telling me that I was wrong in everything that I thought I was right in. But he was right. What happened was this man, he was introduced miraculously to the Lord Jesus. He was a practicing Jew and as a young man he was introduced to the Lord Jesus. Somebody came by and gave him a Gideon Bible. And he says, "I don't want it. I'm not uh I'm not Catholic. That's Catholic. It's about Mary and all that." And the man said, "No, just read it." And he they argued back and forth. Well, finally he he took the little New Testament Bible and he said, "I couldn't take it and not read it." So then he read it and he saw that this wasn't about Mary and the Pope and all of that. This New Testament was as Jewish as the Old Testament was. Everybody in the New Testament was Jewish. Peter and James and John and Paul and all of them, these were Jews. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Jesus was within, of course, we know he was God's son, but the lineage is from the the the um lineage of David. And so he saw this and it just really struck him. And then he he was praying about it. He gave his heart to the Lord Jesus. And his family kind of disowned him for doing it. And he ended up um he ended up uh having a vision and in that vision the Lord came to him and among other things he said that someone within a week someone is going to bring you a further a um I forgot his exact words but someone's going to bring you something that's very important. So with about three or four days later, he gets a knock on his door and it's this man, a tall thin man, and he says, "Can I talk to you about the Lord?" And my this Jewish man, he says, he says, "Oh, I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus." He says, "I was Jew." He says, "Now now and now I know the Bible and and now I understand that they're all Jewish and this is a Jewish book and it's really not for the Gentiles. I mean, you guys get it, but but it's really for us, you know, and he starts telling about how the the New Testament is actually for the Jews and the Gentiles. It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys are good, but but kind of stay out of our way. So, he and then this man says, "I want to tell you that God sent a prophet." And he says, "Oh." He says, "I had a vision, you know, a few days ago." And uh this man introduces them to the same ministry that brother Green fell in love with many many years ago and he um gives him contact information for the Tucson Tabernacle. Now he's living in San Diego. He drives to Tucson, comes to this church, and he he he bought the full volume of those red books that Brother Green published. You know which ones I'm talking about. Those red books are just basically the transcribed sermons. And he because he bought those, he didn't have enough money to get back home to San Diego. So he gets to Yuma and he runs out of money and he goes and works in the fields picking onions to get enough gas to drive back all the way to San Diego. So when he gets back and he starts reading these books and starts studying this and his longtime girlfriend who he was engaged to marry his her parents said that he wasn't a high enough class Jew to marry their daughter. So they forced her to marry another Jewish boy. It broke Ram's heart. Ram left. He went back home back to Jerusalem where he lived for a long time. And for like 20 years, all that man knew of William Brandham was those volumes of books. He never heard another message preacher. He never heard anyone else give witness. He never heard anything. All that he ever knew was those volumes of books. He was at the I knew another man. remember um Frier Tuck [laughter] um what was his name? Steve Goldberg. Steve Goldberg was a Jew and he was uh he would fellowship with us. The tape's short, so [laughter] that's the highlight. I'm just trying to build up to it. So Steve Goldberg, who I knew in Jeffersonville at the Brandon Tabernacle, he would sit and the guy he would sit in the front and brother Joe, he was like twice your size, but built like you, but the guy was just a a fire plug, you know, and and he was he would sit in the front and he would fall asleep and snore every service and it's like, "Brother Steve, sit in the back." But anyways, he uh he he was he was just a really neat guy. And he told me, I knew he was Jewish. And I said, "Hey, give me your testimony." And Steve says, he says, "Well," he says, "It's it's an angel came to me." He says, "I was at the Whailing Wall in Jerusalem." And he said, "I was praying at the Wailing Wall." He says, "I was from the United States." And and but I was going there. It was kind of a pilgrimage. And I was praying at the Wailing Wall. And he said, "This little man came up to me." And he starts witnessing to me about the Lord Jesus. And he said, "He was so compelling in what he said that I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus right there at the wailing wall." And he said he was just one of the he said he said, "Brother, this man was an absolute angel." And he said he told me when I get back to go to Jeffersonville, Indiana, and there I would find more information. And he said, I went and he he said, I went back and I prayed and I looked back and he was gone. He said, "Brother, there was an angel." And I was like, "Wow." You know, that's that was one of the coolest testimonies I've ever heard in my life. Here's this Jew at the Wailing Wall and an angel comes down and introduced into the Lord Jesus and now he's in Jeffersonville and I know him and I'm friends with him and and after I met Ram, my friend from San Diego who had who had gone and and just been studying those books, he asked me, he said, "Oh, yeah." He goes, "Brother Daniel," he says, "I forgot to ask you." He says, "I met a man at the Whailing Wall one time named Steve Goldberg." He said, "Did you ever hear of him?" I was like, "You're the angel?" He goes, "What?" I said, "Brother Ram, he gave his heart to the Lord Jesus at that moment that you witnessed to him and he did exactly what you said." and he is still here this day. And he he was happy about that. It put him in a in touch with each other. And then the thing that meant the most to me about this man was he was a complete virgin to brother Brandham's message. He didn't have all of these different doctrines that we have today. And you can see maybe why I minister the way that I do. And he told me that his first words to me, one of his first words to to me that very first conver conversation, he said, "You ruined William Brandham's message." The Holy Spirit spoke to me and said, "Listen to him." And all of this was because Brother Green had it on his heart to publish these books and to get them into the hands of the people. got them into the hands of a Jewish man and ram rashover. That man brought these books all the way to Israel and studied them for 20 years before he got Crohn's disease and had to come back to Phoenix to have a a surgery done and then he lived out his days in Hawaii, no less. But I was friends with him for a year and he was a tremendous impact on me. really because it comes back to this place and the burden that Perry Green had on his heart to do exactly what brother Brandham said in this sermon, quoting Brother Green and and saying that Brother Green, he wanted to just build on on what other men had done, what their revelation, which he dedicated his life to doing that and I think many of us are here today because of that. So I was just blessed beyond measure to listen to this sermon because it comes right down to me. Not not just because my family on both sides was really close to William Brandon. Not because of that and not because of um that I'm now trying to fill very very big shoes. And brother Green, a great man of God and and and one of the um somebody everyone knows around the world. I could never fill those shoes. But because of those red books that he felt on his heart, they they have a huge impact on me and and my ministry and my direction that the Lord has placed me. So, we're going to hear some we'll hear that. We will um I said he talks about Jack Moore and explain I've been to Jack Moore's church. I I didn't go to a service, but it's still there in Shreveport. I don't know if it's the exact same place, but still they they followed his um his lead. And brother Brandham, you'll hear brother Brandham say, and as I said, brother Moore was a close friend of him. Brother Brandham was like, "Yeah, but he just never really believed me, you know, and and I think it was on a couple of the doctrines that Brother Brandham had." And you could see that he really appreciated brother Green because he stood right there and said, "I believe it." [laughter] So, let's um let's all stand and let's sing the battle hymn that Brother Brandham would always have sung when he would take the pulpit. This great old tune called Only Believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things [singing] are possible. Only be seated. &gt;&gt; November the 21st. What house will you you build me? Really appreciate it. I appreciate the whole thing. Brother Brandon prayed that this place would be a place that we can invite people to place that we could invite our our neighbors and our friends and I hope that this place grows again. It was really big and then it didn't it's the the Tucson Tabernacle was really really big and then it got small. But you know what? It didn't get small. What happened was all these other churches around formed and they flourished. So it's been a blessing. I remember brother Brandham said when um when uh Junior Jackson and Don Ruddle when they left the Brandom Tabernacle and then Brother Bram said great. He says he says this is good. He says we'll just fill it back up again and then we'll just dump it out again. That's the attitude that we should have. So let's fill this place up. Let's let's make this place that same thing that brother Brandon prayed that it would be. Let this place be a strength and a lighthouse to this city called Tucson. We together. Let's all stand. Daniel, my boat alive sails on a troubled sea wherever there's a wind in my sail. that I have a friend who watches over me when the breeze turns into a girl. I know the master of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. And he can calm the storm, make the sun shine again. I know the master of the wind. Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the sky. Among the peaks my [music] soul can be found. An unexpected storm may [music] drive me from the heights, may bring me low, but can never bring me down. I know the master of the wind and I know the maker of the rain. And he can calm the storm. [music] Make the sun shine again. I know the master of the real. Sorry. I know the master of the wind. [music] I know [singing] the maker of the rain. And he can calm the storm, make the sun shine again. I know the master of the wind. Please this week pray. Pray for our church. We went through a at least I did went through a really hard time the past few weeks. And those hard times make us better. They make us stronger. They shake the foundations a little bit. that that old tree that's planted by the water, that wind comes and and that and it shakes that tree and it just loosens up those roots a little bit so they can grow. The the the the ground gets really hard and the roots have a tough time penetrating that ground, but when that tree is shaken, then that ground loosens up and and then out goes those new roots to allow that tree to continue to grow. Brother Aaron Garrett, would you come and close as brother Aaron's coming? I want to read this again. Says here, and I believe by that that almighty God will bless you if you will just stand by this church now, this group of people. Not only that, but let's go out and see if we can't get others to come in. See, let's speak to others everywhere. Speak to them about our church. What it means we're here. We want you to come bring strangers. And I'm sure it will be good for all of us. We have a building which we're thankful for. We're thankful for this place to gather together. I really believe that's the spirit that's in our church now. And there are many people, you see them on Sunday morning. There are many people that have found a place. They found a home. I know I'm looking at one of them right now. Raise your hand, James. Bless you, my friend. We're glad to have you. That's what we stand for. We love the Lord and we serve the Lord and the only way that we have to serve the Lord. He's God. We can't do anything for him. We can sure do things for his people. Amen. This December will be 50 years since we first came visited for the December meetings. 50 years have passed. A lot has happened, but he has never failed and he he will not fail. So, let's just just believe that. Lord, as we listen to your servant, Brother Brand speak and and pray over the brother Green that would be the pastor of this place for a long time. But greater than that is your promise to never leave us. &gt;&gt; Amen. to watch over us, Lord. And though we might fail, and though we might do something wrong, and you still love us, we're your children, Lord. So, we want to go forward first of all in you. Let Christ be made known through us to others. The scripture says that we are the light of the world, Lord, and that's Christ in us. May this church always be a place where we weary pilgrims can come and find rest. &gt;&gt; The rest is not necessarily so much physical but a resting of the heart and the spirit Lord. And then to continue on the journey Lord. May we pray for one another. May we support one another Lord. May we encourage one another always. Sometimes it seems like somebody has a greater part. But if you begin to take out the foundation, all of it will come down, Lord. Strengthen us more today. We pray, Lord, as we commit this weekend, Lord, to you. May we give our all for it, Lord, as you gave your all, Lord. Bless each one as they go home, Lord, and as the next few days that come forward. Lord, we just anticipating that you, Lord, would meet with us in Jesus Christ's name we ask. Amen. I know the master [singing] of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. And he can [music and singing] calm the storm and make the sun shine again. I know the master of the wind. I'm excited. I feel good. There's good spirit here tonight. We're not too many people, but it doesn't matter. God can he can take one man and he can part the Red Sea. And I know that he promised us that if we would be here, the same one that parted the Red Sea, the same one that um multiplied the fishes and the loaves is the same one maybe with us here tonight. I just I feel I feel that he's pleased. God bless you, friends. Remember These meetings this weekend are very very important. So please invite invite whoever you think would benefit from uh from these meetings. Friday night really looking forward. We're going to have um some testimonies from some of the maybe the newer people that came have come over the past couple years. And then if we have time, brother Steve Personne will say a few words.
