alive not just asking him some questions many years ago and it's been quite some time now back there brother Lyle is in that Corners where I used to sit and and as a deacon there and I had lost some good friends and they had just moved away brothers and families that have moved seemed like every time I got a real close friend they went elsewhere for whatever reason it was I told the Lord I'm not making friends with anybody anymore I'm not going to get close friends because I keep losing them I was alien down there at that that chair and um in the message Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever that Sunday that brother Brandon preached here the evening message 61. he prays over this this building he says may this little house here that we're in tonight be open till Jesus comes if

your friend but vote for him because that's the way you feel God has led you to vote so I just want to go over the [Music] the qualifications to vote and and the first one is going to be for those of you that considered the Tabernacle your home Church [Music] secondly for those of you that support the church with your tithes and offerings [Music] those of you that are able to attend on a regular basis or as much as you possibly can and through your prayers and then we have it as those of you who are 18 or older the exception to this is are those who are 16 or older have a regular job and have met the criteria previously listed so if you're 17 don't feel that your voice don't count this is if this is your church and you call it your home [Music] your voice is important so be mindful be be prayerful this morning as we prepare to to place the vote for brother Dan I'm not going to say anything you know this way anyone one way or another but just be prayerful concerning this vote the Lord

brother Jordan [Music] I see brother is there any way we can get rid of Larry to come forth no okay brother Wilson would you mind coming up I don't see brother Jonathan please come up brother Dan would like to be prayed for and anointed ordained as pastor of Tucson Tabernacle so if the brothers would make their way we'll do we'll do it oh [Music] [Music] God bless you brothers and sisters in the message indictment that was priesthood and 1963 July in the morning at Branham Tabernacle the prophet he carried some ordination and I want to read this quotation before we lay hands on our brother and I stand here as an ordained minister and Prophet says when we ordain these ministers by laying on of hands now we realize that scripture way of ordaining a minister is laying on of hands I think that's where our letter Reign Brethren or the battlefield people and so forth God mixed up and when they sin that laying on of hands to impart spiritual gifts now we do not believe that gifts come by laying of hands we believe that laying on of hands is sanction to what we've already seen see it's Amen now when they laid ends upon Timothy and upon those Brethren they had noticed in thee their man was the gift remember stir up that gift which was in you come from Grandmother Lois and they seen this in Timothy and therefore the elders laid hands upon him and ordained him not putting hands upon a man that nothing has ever been shown forth you see and they just ask the blessings and we all believe that so we don't impart spiritual gifts we only recognize them and lay hands upon them to sanction them that we believe that God has done such things for the people was faster than just to nail before us here and if all the elders we can come around him and as I'm saying I stand with our brothers here as an ordained minister and as an ordained pastor I was ordained as a minister as a pastor 18 years ago and with this blessing today we want to ordain our brother as he takes lead to lead this Tabernacle [Music] [Music] Heavenly Father God of William Brenham the god the same yesterday today and forever today The Hours come that has your servants in this place laying our hands upon the man that you have chosen the man in whom you have seen the gift after the going away of your servant the father Ministry Pastor Green resting somewhere in your Holy Land we bring our brother Dan today and ordain him as a pastor of Tucson Tabernacle by the thought of your children this is your will We Believe this is your desire We Believe father and as your servant I remember 18 years ago in the Republic of Botswana I was ordained as a minister and as a pastor in that town the same blessing today together with the Elders of this church we ordain our precious brother Daniel Evans as pastor of Tucson Tabernacle may you endure him with power and wisdom as he leads your people it has never been easy to lead your children the enemy is not happy he who is loose now upon him upon his family upon his children and upon this church but we have the anchor we have the god who can stand with him and granting the wisdom the same way you killed Solomon when he asked a favor from you Lord we pray bless our brother bless his wife bless his children bless the leaders that will stand with him in carrying out this order father as we have done it according to Moses according to Paul and according to the prophet of this end time we sanction the gift in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] receive his Blessing from this church and all the elders today in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we shall say amen [Music] sister Stephanie you're the pastor's wife the Daniel [Music] when God calls a man he calls his wife he calls us children brother Daniel and his wife they're all called doing this together so let's take a moment as a church to pray for them as a family Lord I it's a great step but as one as a man and as a family lord they're trusting in you so as a church a congregation we pray not only for brother Daniel but for sister Stephanie and Daniel his son Lord they will be watched everybody will have their eyes on them but Lord you said you'd be with them Lord so let there be a great example Lord and let us understand that they are human also Lord they need our prayers they need our encouragement Lord so we'll keep them that way before you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign God bless you all well there's not much to say but I can promise you one thing is I'll be praying for you all every day and I'm here to serve each one of you the Bible teaches us that a minister is a servant I think the pastor is he's the lowest of the low he's the one that comes up underneath everybody tries to hold him up that's going to be my Mission from here on out God bless you all and thank you very much thank you the um the enemy he does not like this he he hates us I knew I knew the enemy was going to come against us I didn't know didn't know how um but he if he came in the front door you see last night the enemy broke our window vandalized our church and uh he's a you know he's an adversary he hates us he gets upset he throws a fit he knows what's going to happen but let me tell you something he is a loser he lost the battle when our champion went to this cross [Applause] and he gets to punch at us all he wants but let me tell you something never be afraid of the devil he has no power over us only what the Lord allows him to have the Lord allowed that back window to be broken but you know what they couldn't even get in because there was another pane of glass that wouldn't break and that's how we are we may look like we're broken but there's another there's another Solid Rock right here and it's called the Holy Spirit and that will never break so Satan you can leave keep doing your thing whatever you want to do but you will not win and you have no place here not only that but I got a call this morning and uh Daniel his car broke down broke down on the car wash and it was like every single thing that could happen did and Daniel stuck he's like Dad I don't know what to do my car's here and and and I'm a nervous wreck anyways I always want to get to church early and and this kind of thing really really gets to me but let me tell you what happened this morning God knew what was going to happen he knew Daniel was going to get broken down in that in that car wash and and he knew that we were going to have to that I was going to have to go pick him up remember I'm Dad too and he knew I was going to have to go pick him up so you know what happened this morning before all this I think it's something I have searched the ancient texts and I have never seen it happen until this day my wife was an hour and a half early getting ready for church we had no idea I'm not kidding she was ready an hour when is that has Brothers has that ever happened to you an hour and a half no prompting I was sitting I was sitting studying this morning at 5 30. and I was sitting in my chair Stephanie walked in and uh she said did you go to sleep last night and I said yeah honey everything's good what are you doing she said I'm getting up I'm going to make coffee wow the Lord knew the Lord knew just this little thing he knew that we had to get out early to help my son it really when when does this ever happen Stephanie was done and ready an hour and a half early and then I got the phone call oh you know it's it's nice when the Lord gives us Little Blessings like that he gave he gave us just me personally my family he gave us a little blessing this morning to tell you I love you I'm with you and I was just I was so so blessed to have seen that this morning um another thing the enemy can come against us all he wants you know he broke the window and with the car and all of that but our word says that Jesus has keys to death hell in the grave my friend Daniel Martinez said you know that scripture and I said yeah he says Jesus has keys to death hell on the grave he says Satan doesn't even have keys to his own house amen that's that's the truth my uh my grandpa brother Welch Evans he um he was with brother Branham one time and someone had stolen my grandpa's car and he got the family they got to Brother bram's house they got the family together and they prayed and brother Branham said that they sent an angel of the Lord after that man to bring him back to bring him back and and to so the family would have something well I've been praying for a long time and I think that I might have that same gift because I've been praying for a long time in this morning the angel of the Lord had succeeded in bringing my friend back to us brother Jonathan all right he brought you back my friend it is so good it's so good to have you in service cousin Jonathan God bless you um you know friends it's it's important it's important that uh that we serve others and that's what I want this Church to be about I want that to be our foundation I really appreciate it but Aaron that quote you read the quote right this morning yeah that brother Aaron read earlier this morning that from Brother Branham about making this place I forgot the exact words was a place of Refuge that's what we need to be so even with all of the Satan going against us this morning and and all the adversary he also brought to us a brother that's had on his heart to serve the Lord and and he's he's new to us brother Edward God bless you my brother it's good to have you back there in the back raise your hand my brother good to have you my friend is it's been a long time since you've been a church somebody witnessed to you and invited you to come brother it's good to have you in church um as far as the church so now we have a pastor and we need to move forward on some things and one of the things that we need to have I believe as a church is we need to have church bylaws so I'll be praying about those and I didn't feel qualified until now to put a set of bylaws together so now I do so what we'll do is over the next few weeks I'm going to be praying about the bylaws I want to I want to put a set of church bylaws together and this is how we govern ourselves and once I get a draft of these bylaws I'll run it by the brethren I'll open it up for comments and suggestions on the bylaws we will put the bylaws up for a vote for the congregation I want it to be ratified by the congregation by a simple majority so we will be doing that fairly soon the next thing as far as the offices in the church will be separating the deacons and the trustees and the church right now these brothers have have been pillars in the church and holding this place up and keeping these doors open and and being a blessing to us so what we will do in the near future is we will have deacons and trustees and those will also be confirmed by the church by by a simple majority vote of the church I'd like to get all of this done within a month of today and have those those positions officially in place um another thing that I haven't felt comfortable in doing yet is um is the church finances what we will do in the near future also is we will be posting some side of some sort of a financial statement maybe quarterly for the church so you know what's going on so you know um the basics as far as the church finances um a brother suggested to me recently that we also have board meeting notes and make sure that those notes are also available to the congregation so we will also be doing I think that's a good idea I think it's according to the word so we will also be doing that um we'll we'll make um our meeting notes when we have board meetings available to the congregation in some shape or fashion I don't know how we will do it either um we can send it out through WhatsApp I don't necessarily feel to put it on the public website so we'll we'll figure out some way to get that information to you so you you're staying up with that um in in the near future I'd like to get this room done back here there's room for the um for the Youth for the younger years I think it's going to be real blessing it's really in my heart to um to have that for not only for the little ones but also for the mothers so the kids when they can come outside that they have a place to fellowship and enjoy themselves that's out of the Heat and the mothers don't have to sit um out in the and fathers and all of us don't have have to have a have to sit out in the heat so I want to do that I'm going to need some help from the brothers I'll pray about uh also I would like to have another men's meeting I really enjoyed the one that we had before so I'll tentatively try to schedule that for next Friday but I'm not sure I'll send it out on WhatsApp and what we'll talk about there is we'll talk about um some some things I have on my heart for outreach and I'd also like to ask the brothers to help me with some projects number one being this room in the lower level in the in the school room out there um I'm really friends I'm I am humbled and I am excited about what the Lord's doing I am not only in the work of the church on the outward in in getting these things done but also what the Lord's doing spiritually and how I believe that he has his hand on us and even with that broken window this morning I can see that Satan hates this that didn't come from God that broken window that came from the Devil Himself and we need to understand that he is going to come against us in every way that he can I've said often that that God's hands to do his work God's hands are these hands right here the hands that you have and the hands that I have those are God's hands but let me tell you something else Satan's hands also are the hands of human beings there's two Spirits at War here and they've been at War since the dawn of time and these two spirits will be at War Until the End one day soon the losing spirit that of Satan will be cast into this Lake of Fire and it will be destroyed in the hands of God that the anointing upon the hands of God will prevail and introduce eternal life to all of us but in the in the meantime while we are here remember there's two Spirits working back and forth and make sure that our hands and our mouths and everything that about about us are working for God and not and not for the enemy I wanted before I won't I have a sermon prepared but um I'll put it off to another time but I did want to talk about about the church and the unity and for everyone to understand that how the vote took place I think it was wonderful I think it was it was it was a decisive word from the church and I had told the brothers that if it was anywhere close what I would do is I would accept the position but I would immediately start working to try to get someone else here that could get a vote like we got today but the vote was decisive and I believe the congregation put me into this position I believe not only congregation I believe the Lord Jesus put me here and I have confidence that he did it there are there were the far more votes for than there were against but I want to I want everyone to do me a favor don't say one word about who do you think voted against him don't do that that will do no good don't even let it come up in your conversations because I am here to serve everyone in this building and whoever couldn't make it no matter no matter if you like me or you don't like me it doesn't matter I am at your service I am here to serve you because I believe that is the role of a minister and we don't know who voted two and and four I'll probably get with brother Jordan afterwards to see if we can see who voted against on the cameras I'm glad you laughed there was a pause [Laughter] I'm just kidding but don't don't say anything against any any of your brothers or sisters friends there is there's no reason to do it we are together in this no matter if we have an opinion about I like this Minister I don't like that Minister I don't agree with his Doctrine I don't I don't I like his Doctrine it doesn't matter because we are together in this battle and we have a common enemy and that enemy hates us and we need to stand together against that enemy and only through unity and I'll read a scripture here in a little bit only through Unity where we be able to get through this it's something that Christ himself prayed for Brothers I'm sorry uh we don't I don't have any notes for you um but I would like to I would like to read a scripture let's all stand if you could foreign and let's go to let's read John chapter 17. I'm going to start with verse 14. it says this I have given them Thy word this is by the way this is our Lord and savior pray for his people this is Jesus Christ In The Garden of Gethsemane and he is praying for his people and the next day he was going to be on the cross here his closing words as he prays for us I have given them Thy Word and the word and the world have hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou should has keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I Jesus speaking am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou Hast sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sakes listen to this very sad statement he's about to make speaking to the Lord speaking to his father says this and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth Jesus gave everything a young man 33 years old lived his life perfect before God which none of us no one has ever done in the history of the world lived a life perfect before God for our sakes I'll read it again and and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word he's praying for Tucson Tabernacle right there he's praying for each of us the people in this room that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou Hast sent me look at the importance of that prayer that Jesus says that they may be one that the world might believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as We Are One i in them thou in me that they may be PR may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou Hast loved me may the Lord add the blessings to the reading of his word you can take your seeds and what Jesus just said and those blessed scriptures in our Bible and read our Unity in this church our love for each other will be our greatest witness of Christ to the world there Jesus is praying and he says Lord I pray that they may be one that they may be United that they may love each other that they may stand together so that all the world might know that I am the Messiah because of our love one for another sister Heather or sister Heather sister Heather sister Heather showed me a a text she opened up her home and and and welcomed someone in as a Christian would do and she showed me this morning this young lady's response and she talked about how warm the spirit is and how much of a blessing it was to see a church like this a witness of Jesus Christ himself because of the kindness of a person and we see how as Jesus was down there praying the Bible says he was suffering so bad that as he was praying the the blood came out of his skin and praying I don't know what suffering like that is I've never I could never even think about how bad he was suffering this wasn't going to his death the next day this was carrying the sins of the whole world on his shoulders and there he is praying in this Garden knowing exactly what was going to happen his his close friend betrayed him thinking about that thinking about Lord these disciples that I've I've taught and I've taught him in this direction these Lord take care of them he was worried about other people the spirit of Jesus Christ Lord let them love one another and then he says in another place he says that the world will know that God will know that you're my disciples by your loved one for another and coming in to this church and now we have a new beginning it's strange that sister green passed away just a few days ago and taking communion with her and and fellowshipping with sister Karen sister Karen sent me the nicest text this morning saying she was praying for me how much that meant brother Green's daughter saying that to me and and going and seeing sister green there in the bed and taking communion with with the brothers and sisters and how we win and how sweet sister Rachel she was so sweet wasn't she just it was just precious and then she goes and then we make this move as a church I think maybe the Lord was giving her peace that this was going to be okay and everything that she had worked for all the labors that that sister had put in brother green had put into building this church and building this ministry not just here but worldwide in all how many people know what they did and now we are tasked with carrying this on and I want to do my best I want to continue this church and I wanted to move forward and I wanted to grow not necessarily not with people from coming from the different message churches prosely lighting but I wanted to grow from people that need a church people that love one another people who need it for their children people that need it for their brothers and their sisters people that may have left a long time ago that may have been hurt I want to see a church that welcomes them with open arms say no we're not we're not going to hold anything against we're not going to judge you We're Not Gonna We're Not Gonna critique the way you look we're not going to attack you in certain ways you come here and because you're going to find Jesus Christ Among Us you're going to find the spirit that was prophesied to come you're gonna find it here and you're and that spirit is based on love and that's what I want people to see when they come to this church do you have that quote do you have it with you I'd like to read it again if you could brother Aaron brother and read that quote I just feel that it's it's a good one to read I love I love peace I love unity you know when when I live my life I want to be happy I want to thank you brother I think I think I want to enjoy life and God wants us to also but you know what's going to take that Joy away from us is sin if we make mistakes and we go down the wrong road it's going to make our lives miserable so we need to to be doing everything that we can working for the Lord seeking the Lord and understanding what he wants us to do and that is the role of a church it's the role of a pastor not to dictate the people how to live how to live their life you're not going to find me telling you don't do this and do this you're not going to find me pulling out the measuring stick and in a in a series of rules you're not going to find me doing that what you're going to find me doing is saying you got to get to Christ because I'll fail I've failed so many times in my life and you know what I'm going to continue to fail but he's never failed if we could just get people to Jesus Christ if we can get them to him and they can start communicating with Christ then that joy that we have will be in them and that's what I want that's the desire and I pray oh God give it to us that way if there's a sickness if you have a relationship with Christ you can go and pray for that person and there will be healing if there's someone that's that's lost or someone that that needs counsel you can do it if you are communicating with him but if if you're just waiting for someone to dictate in your life what to do you're not going to get it from me I am going to tell you get to Christ I'll tell you what the word says believe me I'll tell you what the word says about any subject that that I see that's in here I'm not afraid of anything that this book says and I will present it the best that I know how but this whole book is pointed there's one purpose in this whole book and that is to introduce us to our Savior from Genesis to Revelation the whole thing is to introduce us to Christ and he is our savior else it's just a book but it's meant to get us to the Lord I want to read a quote from Brother Branham it's a lengthy quote Brothers It's Christ is the mystery of God revealed I gave you I gave you that um it should be on my email brother Branham says this he says love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and set him down and cause him to fellowship with you under quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman or ever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so now you remember that the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't ever Clan among one or talk or make yourself clannish We Are One I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you and I'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of of my finger I want to stay there every little part of my body to stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another and now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church how do we behave ourselves in the Church of God how we got to come together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get he in here to fellowship with your brothers I want that love friends oh if you don't don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to praying because we're in the last days where the Bible exalted or exhorted us to quote much more as we see that day approaching he's quoting Hebrews the love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places and Christ Jesus and love one another this will all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for another that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will take that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything so don't you do that you just wax that much closer together draw up the take the Buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing it in a vision just that buckles on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten her up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you amen look at the Holy Spirit operating right there in brother Brandon The Same Spirit as Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane Lord let them be one let them love one another warned us as Jesus warned them that Satan's going to come in he warned Peter that Satan sought to sift you like wheat but I prayed for you Peter and the same with us he wants every one of us he hates us he ultimately wants to take our lives but we should stand one for another praying one for another all together in this gospel loving one another so we voted and we set a path to move forward and I'm going to do the best that I can as I said some of the things I want to do that are on my heart I ask you to support me help me not just same but Daniel behind you but help me we need to have a church that is working together and and pushing forward not serving ourselves but serving others and that's when we'll see the church grow and it has been growing I mean look at look at how many more people are here now than there were a little while ago and it'll continue to grow but only if we have that love I would rather have that right spirit that right love and the wrong Doctrine and you know what I'm saying then have the right Doctrine and have that wrong spirit that wrong way about me be wrong in my heart think the prophet said this he he said I would rather be right in my heart and wrong in my Doctrine then right in my Doctrine and wrong in my heart or his I believe his exact words yes and that's where we need to be right in our hearts loving one another um I'm so grateful I want to feel that excitement friends I feel I feel good but sometimes when you're up here it's nice when I hear that you're feeling good too so so you can say Amen every once in a while and I like brother Jonathan every once in a while he'll give a clap offering before the Lord let's friends let's let's be enthusiastic because not fake not work it up you know I've seen you know I don't have to get up here and do jumping jacks in front of you and you don't have to do them in the Pew that's not real but something that's real and saying in in agreeing and and putting your shoulder to the stone to push and to work I wanna the next time I minister I want to minister if the Lord's willing on and this is what I prepared for this morning but if the musicians could come and we'll close but I want to minister on this book of Galatians and in the first two chapters in the book Paul is addressing a very serious problem that problem is it's manifested itself Paul is writing this letter back to the brethren in that part of the world and it ties in perfectly with this study on the book of Acts that we've been talking about and especially about my sermon on Wednesday and what it is the enemy had because he always does he always will he got in there and he started causing problems he started causing people to look down on each other because he caused people to be critical of one another and friends it's pretty amazing what those those uh criticisms are about [Music] he'll be you'll be um probably surprised and when Paul said and I think of of this man he said though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than that which we have already preached to you let him be accursed I think that was only an apostle of God that could say something like that but he was addressing a conflict in the church murmuring in the church fighting in the church confusion in the church about something that you would never imagine what it was and it was taking God's word and attacking each other with it very serious I don't have time to minister on it today but I will if the Lord's willing if he wants me to preach it I will I'll preach about that next Sunday [Music] but for now let's just enjoy each other's company friends just love one another I know all of these disciples when when they got old when uh when they wrote their Epistles love was the main thing read first second and third John oh little children love one another love love love love love love wasn't all these we love the Deep doctrines and and we should study them if God gave them to us we should study them we should understand them but when it comes down to it love is the Capstone First Corinthians chapter 13. it says though I have all of these things and all these Revelations and all these these this great faith and if I don't have love I am nothing that's what we need to have I want you and ordained me as pastor but now I want each of you say okay Lord we've we've done this step but now it's up to me I have a role in this and we can't until every piece is in place we can't there's no perfection I told the story about a puzzle and how you take all of the there's this big pile you take the box and you open it up and you pile and there's this big pile of these puzzle pieces and they all look the same it's like what in the world how am I gonna put this together and then you go and you look at them the picture that's on the box and you start getting the the ones with the straight edge you know it's like oh they're all they're different this one has a different color where's the color on here and here's the master and the master is he's taking this puzzle and he's putting each one in place oh this one has part of the sunshine in it this one has part of a foot this one has part the top of the mountain and he's placing them and it pretty soon it becomes it's no more this pile of pieces now it's forming this masterpiece of God and that's how we are and we need to be willing to be placed wherever he wants us to be placed I feel like I just got placed this morning [Applause] but no one piece is any more important than any other but God places us and let's complete this puzzle will you friends let's bow our heads let's not stand yet let's bow our heads [Music] as we think on the future [Music] now we've made this decision [Music] but that's just that's just one piece and there may have there may be pieces already placed already in operation but there are still many many pieces that need to be placed in this puzzle in this masterpiece so friends think about your place where God wants you to be placed and don't neglect his leading in your life he loves you he loves me he knows Satan hates us and he's protecting us Satan the thing that he does not want to do is he does not want you in that place that God's God has ordained for you to be so I ask if you're willing to be placed wherever God wants you to be not where you want to be not where I want to be but if you're willing to be placed where God wants you to be would you make an offering to God today and just raise your hand before him say Lord I surrender to you wherever you want me to be I want you to place me in that position thank you [Music] Lord God I had my head bowed and my eyes closed so Lord I don't know how many hands were raised but I know my hand was raised [Music] I pray father that that each hand that was raised that you would honor that and Lord that you would Place us and that we could be a blessing Lord a blessing to each other a blessing to those that are outside a blessing to the neighborhood a blessing to our neighborhoods a blessing to everyone that we come into contact everyone that walks by this church Lord may it be a blessing to them may we stand for our Lord Jesus Christ Lord we commit it to you and ask Lord that you would lead us leave as Joshua said let this ark go before you because you've you haven't been this way before so Lord we pray that your Ark our the word today would go before us keep us in your will Lord may your will be done and Lord we pray that the manifestation of your spirit would also be known in our congregation in Jesus name God bless you Brothers and Sisters Let's stand [Music] he
