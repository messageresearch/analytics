[12:04] with one another lord the
[12:06] purchase of your blood

[12:09] midst lord because you promised and
[12:12] your word has never failed lord that
[12:14] never can fail
[12:15] and we're trusting on that lord that you
[12:17] said you'd be here and
[12:20] father what a
[12:23] what a thing it would be to come into
[12:24] your presence and leave the same way
[12:26] lord

[12:38] reach out in faith and

[12:54] better off than when we came lord more
[12:56] in love with you more in love with each
[12:57] other
[12:58] but you'd have your way lord and

[13:03] aside that we could
[13:05] learn of your thoughts and your words
[13:07] lord you know that your ways are higher

[13:10] above the earth

[13:14] not come to hear from man though we we
[13:16] love each other dearly but we've come to

[13:22] worship you father
[13:23] and just pray father that you would
[13:26] help us for we need your help
[13:28] but we know that if we ask you for your
[13:30] help that you'll grant it father if we
[13:32] believe that that's your desire

[38:06] that
[38:07] brother
[38:08] matthew mcfadden expressed that
[38:11] that's what they used to do to punish
[38:13] the soldiers i guess
[38:16] in the military and i certainly was not
[38:18] intending for that to be
[38:20] the situation lord knows my heart but if
[38:23] that little girl
[38:25] is here

[41:43] uh let's start at verse six
[41:46] before the throne
[41:48] there was a sea of glass like unto
[41:50] crystal and in the midst of the throne
[41:53] and round about the throne were four
[41:55] beasts full of eyes before and behind
[41:58] and the first beast was like a lion and
[42:00] the second beast like a calf and the
[42:02] third beast had a face as a man and the
[42:05] fourth beast was like a flying eagle and
[42:08] the four beasts had each of them six
[42:11] wings about him and they were full of
[42:14] eyes within
[42:17] that margin there
[42:18] says around and within
[42:22] if you'll run that margin there
[42:24] there
[42:24] they were full of eyes around and within
[42:27] and they rest not day and night saying
[42:30] holy holy holy
[42:33] lord god almighty which was and is and
[42:37] is to come
[42:39] amen let's just bow our heads
[42:42] one more time precious heavenly father
[42:44] lord we
[42:46] thank you lord for
[42:48] this
[42:49] resurrection day lord for us to come and
[42:52] to honor you
[42:53] lord a risen savior a god
[42:57] that is alive and working
[43:00] lord full of power and full of grace
[43:03] full of love
[43:04] lord full of all those fruits of the
[43:06] spirit and lord we're thankful for
[43:09] everything lord that you have provided
[43:12] for your church
[43:13] lord we
[43:15] would ask that now you would come again
[43:17] lord that you would allow us to
[43:19] do as they did when you were walking the
[43:22] shores of galilee let us sit at your
[43:24] feet and learn of you lord that is our
[43:27] desire
[43:28] something lord that would
[43:30] sustain us lord would be enough
[43:33] lord to
[43:34] give us strength and encouragement lord
[43:37] to press the battle in whatever capacity
[43:40] that would be man woman boy or girl
[43:43] lord we want to commit this service to
[43:45] you lord
[43:46] we ask that you would have the
[43:48] preeminence we ask these things in jesus
[43:50] christ's name amen
[43:52] and god bless you can be seated
[44:02] i'd like to read this from by faith
[44:04] moses preached in 1958
[44:08] before we begin
[44:12] there is no way to ever please god only
[44:15] by faith
[44:18] the scripture plainly states it that way
[44:20] and it's by faith and without faith says
[44:23] the scripture it is impossible to please
[44:26] god
[44:28] so if faith disagrees with science
[44:31] and science disagrees with faith that
[44:34] puts them at edge at each other
[44:36] then
[44:37] we must take a choice
[44:39] as moses did
[44:41] by faith
[44:42] we believe
[44:45] now if we lose faith
[44:47] then we will never get a prayer answered
[44:49] by god
[44:50] for he that cometh to god
[44:52] must first believe that he is
[44:56] and
[44:57] a rewarder of those that diligently seek
[45:00] after him
[45:02] so if we lose faith
[45:04] our prayers are annulled we get nowhere
[45:08] so it's all that we can think of this
[45:10] morning is to hold on to faith then if
[45:12] we lose faith all our hopes is gone
[45:16] and if we lose faith all our spiritual
[45:18] reality is gone
[45:21] for you cannot have faith in things that
[45:23] you see for the things that you see are
[45:26] all perishable if we look at some great
[45:28] person a great minister or a great
[45:30] congregation
[45:32] they will all perish someday
[45:35] and if we look at a great nation or a
[45:36] great weapon
[45:38] they'll all perish someday
[45:41] and then we must live by faith of those
[45:44] things that science does not declare
[45:47] it's by faith that we believe
[45:51] now we lose our glory if we lose faith
[45:54] now if we get away from faith then we
[45:55] take the church into an intellectual
[45:58] realm and many times it's been thought
[46:00] amongst people that because a
[46:02] congregation was large and they had
[46:04] great churches great steeples and a
[46:06] great lot of well-dressed and groomed
[46:09] people and a lot of finances that they
[46:11] could afford such things we many times
[46:14] thought that was inspiring
[46:17] that this certain church must be
[46:19] inspired
[46:21] or we've often
[46:22] referred to different ministers who get
[46:24] out on the field and have great
[46:26] gatherings of crowds and we think
[46:28] sometimes that they are the signs of
[46:30] inspiration but that's not altogether
[46:32] the truth
[46:33] that's human inspiration
[46:36] but the real inspiration comes by doing
[46:39] the will of god see
[46:42] whether it is one or just a handful
[46:46] whether it is a big church or a small
[46:48] church it matters not
[46:50] whether he is a great eloquent speaker
[46:53] or just a man that hardly knows his abcs
[46:56] it doesn't matter it depends on the
[46:59] message that he's bringing whether it is
[47:02] inspired by the word of god or is it
[47:05] inspired by intellectual conceptions of
[47:08] human inspiration some people can be
[47:10] inspired because of an eloquent speaker
[47:13] that doesn't make it right
[47:15] sometimes they're inspired because the
[47:17] man is so trained that he could put his
[47:20] point over that doesn't mean that it's
[47:22] of god see
[47:24] it's only through god's everlasting
[47:27] eternal blessed word
[47:30] can we receive inspiration
[47:32] and that's given by the holy ghost
[47:35] by faith we receive it
[47:42] i wanted to read that to you
[47:44] right off the bat this morning and i i
[47:46] got ahead of myself and i apologize for
[47:48] that so i thought i'd read that to you
[47:50] this evening because i think that our
[47:53] minds
[47:54] and our hearts when we come to a service
[48:00] should
[48:02] should be with the intention of our
[48:04] faith in god to do something for us
[48:10] not i want to hear something new i want
[48:13] to hear something inspiring
[48:15] but
[48:17] i want to see god as those greeks that
[48:21] approached the disciples they came to
[48:23] him those disciples and they said you
[48:26] know
[48:27] we would see jesus
[48:31] that's how we feel
[48:33] as believers
[48:34] when we come to the house of god we want
[48:37] to see jesus
[48:39] when we
[48:40] talk
[48:41] amongst one another as believers
[48:44] we want to see
[48:46] jesus
[48:48] when we're sick or we have a loved one
[48:50] who has a great need whether that's a
[48:53] sickness
[48:54] even unto death
[48:57] it's at those moments we would really
[49:00] see jesus
[49:02] we'd really like to see jesus moving
[49:13] and church
[49:21] i was going to say we're not exempt from
[49:23] trials
[49:24] but that's an understatement
[49:27] we're the ones who are
[49:28] especially keenly aware of the trials
[49:32] and tribulations that are placed upon a
[49:35] son or daughter of god
[49:38] the great news is we are we have an
[49:40] understanding why those trials are
[49:44] happening
[49:46] what they're meant to do for us
[49:48] without that understanding
[49:51] that's why men and women turn to the
[49:53] bottle that's why they turn to the pills
[49:55] that's why they they they go
[49:58] they try to gather up as much money so
[50:01] they can try to find comfort and
[50:02] vacations or whatever it is
[50:04] because they don't understand why the
[50:07] hard times i like the good times
[50:11] why the hard times
[50:13] but we understand that those are the
[50:16] that's the fire that brings out the pure
[50:19] gold
[50:21] and so we're willing to it
[50:24] during the heat of the trial and believe
[50:27] me i know about the heat of the trial
[50:31] but during the heat of the trial when
[50:34] when you feel like you are
[50:37] you're in a war zone
[50:41] that's the time we have a place of
[50:45] refuge
[50:46] a place that even while things are loud
[50:49] and noisy and chaotic we can go before
[50:52] our father and say lord
[50:57] i'm trusting in you
[50:59] that whether you bring me over this
[51:01] under this around this or through this
[51:05] it's you doing it
[51:06] and lord
[51:09] not my will but thy will be done in my
[51:11] life
[51:14] this morning
[51:16] we were
[51:18] speaking about
[51:22] the day of atonement
[51:23] and we were we had
[51:26] given a good i don't know how good we
[51:28] gave an illustration about the
[51:31] tabernacle in the wilderness
[51:34] and we showed uh the altar of fire
[51:39] for sacrifice we showed the brazen altar
[51:42] uh for the the laver for washing the
[51:45] sacrifice
[51:47] we the waters of separation we showed
[51:50] the candle sticks within
[51:53] the
[51:54] the holy place the shoe bread the table
[51:57] of shoe bread the altar of ins for
[51:59] incense
[52:01] then we showed in the holiest of holies
[52:05] the mercy seat and the ark
[52:08] that carried
[52:09] the
[52:11] tablets of the laws of god
[52:13] the manna
[52:15] and the rod of aaron
[52:18] we talked about that mercy seat
[52:20] how that the high priest on the day of
[52:22] atonement and the importance of the day
[52:24] of atonement
[52:26] and the
[52:27] the
[52:28] sprinkling of the blood seven times
[52:30] representing the blood of jesus christ
[52:32] through the seven church ages
[52:34] we showed those things
[52:37] we were specifically talking about that
[52:39] mercy seton without blood it's a
[52:42] judgment seat but with blood it's a
[52:44] mercy seat and that's what we're
[52:45] thankful for that the blood of jesus is
[52:48] still
[52:48] on the mercy seat of our heart now
[52:51] that's where it is
[52:55] and we showed that not only the act of
[52:58] jesus doing the propitiation but him
[53:00] actually being the place of propitiation
[53:03] and him being the one who's who is that
[53:06] mercy seat who sits on your heart
[53:11] tonight if i had a title and i i want
[53:14] you to know i preached this message
[53:17] i want to say at least 15 years ago
[53:20] brother david may have even heard this
[53:22] sermon
[53:23] um
[53:25] years ago i preached this and it i
[53:29] i don't have the notes from that sermon
[53:31] so this could be totally different
[53:33] but i kept the same title and that title
[53:37] is homeland security
[53:39] and tonight i want to talk about
[53:41] homeland security
[53:43] and i'll show you why
[53:45] i took this from the department of
[53:48] homeland security's website
[53:50] and it says our duties are wide-ranging
[53:54] and our goal is clear
[53:57] keeping
[53:58] america safe
[54:02] and so that's the
[54:03] they i believe it was george w bush who
[54:06] started homeland the homeland security
[54:08] in 2003 i believe
[54:12] and
[54:14] because of the events that took place in
[54:16] 2001
[54:18] the terrorist attack at the trade towers
[54:22] this homeland security became a very
[54:25] popular
[54:27] title around the u.s
[54:30] we all if i would have asked
[54:32] you know in the early 2000s
[54:36] uh you know about homeland security i
[54:38] think we probably would all say oh yes
[54:40] very much i know what homeland security
[54:42] is
[54:44] and they're still active it's still an
[54:46] active department today in the
[54:48] government
[54:49] um
[54:52] but it i just i thought that that was
[54:56] just a nice synopsis our goal is clear
[54:58] keeping america safe
[55:01] so i think that that's a good
[55:03] idea in the natural when you when we're
[55:06] talking about homeland security we
[55:08] understand it amongst our nation here
[55:11] what homeland security is is to do it's
[55:14] to protect
[55:16] america and the american citizens
[55:19] uh to protect us from from well i would
[55:22] say
[55:24] definitely foreign
[55:25] attacks but perhaps even domestic as
[55:28] well
[55:30] i don't want to get into the government
[55:32] because i it's not something i'm
[55:34] interested in
[55:40] but
[55:40] i want to talk about homeland security
[55:42] tonight
[55:44] because i believe that god
[55:46] as
[55:47] in the spiritual realm also has a
[55:49] homeland security
[55:52] and when we
[55:53] look here
[55:55] and i said it this morning when john
[55:58] is
[56:00] is told to to to write the things that
[56:03] he sees when he's caught up on the
[56:04] lord's day there on the isle of patmos
[56:06] and he writes the book of revelation
[56:08] over a period of two years through a
[56:10] series of visions
[56:11] that god gives him in a trans in in in
[56:14] god translating him to the the day of
[56:16] the lord as brother branham puts it
[56:18] uh
[56:19] john begins to write the things that he
[56:21] sees and as i said this morning we we we
[56:24] heard brother branham say that john and
[56:26] ezekiel saw the same thing
[56:29] they what what john is seeing with that
[56:32] ark uh or what ezekiel saw with that ark
[56:35] and the wheels and it moving uh with the
[56:38] wheel and the wheel with the hub and and
[56:40] the ark and the being the word of god
[56:43] moving here on earth john sees it in its
[56:46] resting place in heaven
[56:48] but it's the same thing and you'll see
[56:51] these recurring
[56:53] uh
[56:54] creatures and and these recurring
[56:57] themes you'll see it recurring through
[56:59] the scripture
[57:01] and it's
[57:02] i believe that it is just a testament of
[57:06] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[57:09] and forever it's it's an assurance that
[57:13] god i am the lord thy god i change not
[57:20] and sometimes we just need to be
[57:23] reminded of that
[57:25] we see the children of israel needed
[57:27] that reminder constantly time and time
[57:30] again god would they they that children
[57:32] of israel had heard to hear the word of
[57:34] god they would turn towards god say god
[57:36] we want to serve you god would give them
[57:39] a direction they would go that way for a
[57:40] while and then after a while
[57:43] they'd begin to drift away and god would
[57:45] send a prophet on the scene and a
[57:47] prophet would come along and and say
[57:51] heed the word of god listen thus say it
[57:53] to lord you're you're wandering you're
[57:55] straying church you're the children of
[57:58] god and you've gone after the strange
[57:59] gods and get back to the word of god get
[58:02] back get rid of those idols get rid of
[58:05] of of these things that you've drifted
[58:06] away from and get back to serving god
[58:09] and they would put ashes upon their head
[58:11] and they would tear their clothes and
[58:13] they would repent to god and say what
[58:16] have we done
[58:19] they were constantly needing a reminder
[58:21] and we are no different
[58:23] we need a reminder
[58:26] and and and that's why i'm so thankful
[58:30] we have this
[58:31] glorious message of this hour on
[58:34] recording
[58:35] because
[58:36] when you begin to get anxious when you
[58:38] begin to work get worked up or riled
[58:40] i'll tell you i'll give you uh
[58:43] something that
[58:45] that that
[58:46] helps me
[58:48] put on a tape and just listen to a
[58:50] prayer line
[58:53] just just listen
[58:55] to god
[58:57] speaking through that prophet and saying
[59:00] your name is so and so you come from
[59:02] this place you're not here for you
[59:04] you're here for a loved one and they've
[59:06] got this disease and if you'll just
[59:08] believe thus saith the lord go home find
[59:10] them well or you've got this this tumor
[59:13] and and it's gone is that right and and
[59:16] you hear these things and you go oh god
[59:18] that's my god
[59:21] that's my god
[59:28] so tonight
[59:30] when we look at that mercy seat there's
[59:32] something that was specifically that was
[59:35] placed on that mercy seat
[59:37] that if you go and you'll read exodus
[59:39] chapter 25 i'll give you these scripture
[59:41] references and and and i encourage you
[59:44] go and and read these scriptures
[59:46] moses
[59:48] when he's given the pattern of the
[59:49] tabernacle and then he's given the
[59:51] pattern of each of the pieces of
[59:53] furniture to be placed within the
[59:55] tabernacle
[59:56] one of the things is that that mercy
[59:58] seat that's to be made of gold but on
[1:00:01] top of that was to be molded
[1:00:04] to cherubims
[1:00:06] those two cherubims
[1:00:09] are
[1:00:10] what we're
[1:00:11] reading about right here in revelations
[1:00:14] chapter four they're living creatures
[1:00:17] now in your english in your old
[1:00:20] uh king king james version it says it
[1:00:24] calls them uh
[1:00:27] living for beasts but if you'll go and
[1:00:30] again you'll you'll run your margins and
[1:00:33] you'll look at your hebrew and greek
[1:00:36] lexicons
[1:00:38] brother branham points out that this
[1:00:40] word beast in the i want to say the
[1:00:43] hebrew is zun
[1:00:45] z-o-o-n
[1:00:47] which means living creature
[1:00:50] whereas the beast that you read about in
[1:00:53] revelations chapter 11 and 13 and 17
[1:00:57] this is therion which is an untamed
[1:01:00] beast
[1:01:02] so there's a difference and you should
[1:01:05] know that and i i say that for the sake
[1:01:06] of maybe our young people
[1:01:09] don't take one word and then just splash
[1:01:12] it across your whole bible there they
[1:01:15] mean different things in different
[1:01:17] places you need to understand context
[1:01:21] it's very important
[1:01:23] and so these beasts are living creatures
[1:01:26] now
[1:01:29] john here describes these beasts
[1:01:32] and
[1:01:33] these living creatures and he says that
[1:01:36] the the first was like a lion the second
[1:01:39] was like um
[1:01:40] uh the face of a man
[1:01:43] oh excuse me the first a lion the second
[1:01:45] a calf the third the face of a man
[1:01:48] and the fourth was a flying eagle
[1:01:51] and if you'll go and you'll you'll read
[1:01:54] uh
[1:01:55] in exodus it says the same thing now
[1:01:58] those two cherubims had those
[1:02:00] four faces each of them had
[1:02:03] uh those four faces
[1:02:07] ezekiel you'll find the same thing you
[1:02:10] want to go and read ezekiel chapter one
[1:02:12] you'll see the same thing four living
[1:02:15] creatures with these
[1:02:16] different faces same faces
[1:02:19] a lion
[1:02:21] an ox a man and an eagle
[1:02:27] now
[1:02:29] i want to try to hurry through this so
[1:02:31] bear with me
[1:02:33] this is from revelations chapter four
[1:02:35] number three let's not leave that for a
[1:02:36] minute let's just
[1:02:38] hold it there a minute living creatures
[1:02:42] what are they
[1:02:43] if they're not angels
[1:02:46] they're not redeemed men
[1:02:48] what are they
[1:02:49] would you like to know
[1:02:51] here's my interpretation i hope it's
[1:02:54] right i believe it is
[1:02:56] they are
[1:02:57] god's guards of his throne
[1:03:03] now we're going to erase this just in a
[1:03:06] little bit now you see there they're not
[1:03:08] angels nor man they're not wild beasts
[1:03:11] they're creatures
[1:03:12] living creatures
[1:03:16] now brother brahma says
[1:03:19] the interpretation i hope it's right i
[1:03:20] believe it is they are god's guards of
[1:03:24] his throne
[1:03:26] now
[1:03:31] it's a again it's nice imagery when you
[1:03:34] imagine the ark you imagine the mercy
[1:03:37] seat you imagine these cherubs and their
[1:03:40] wings and their
[1:03:42] faces and we we realize that that mercy
[1:03:46] seat or judgment seat depending on if
[1:03:49] there's blood or if there's not blood
[1:03:54] is now represented over here in
[1:03:56] revelation
[1:03:58] as a throne
[1:04:00] before the throne
[1:04:03] there was a sea of glass like unto
[1:04:05] crystal
[1:04:09] and so again this sea of glass we we
[1:04:12] understand
[1:04:14] the brazen altar
[1:04:15] to clean and we understand this throne
[1:04:19] or this mercy seat by where the presence
[1:04:22] of god abides
[1:04:32] jumping down
[1:04:34] here to
[1:04:36] yes perfect
[1:04:38] and these cherubims first mentioned
[1:04:42] was placed at the east gate of the
[1:04:45] garden
[1:04:46] going four ways now i want to read that
[1:04:48] for you i could just give you that
[1:04:50] scripture but i'd like to read it for
[1:04:52] you would that be all right
[1:04:54] in revelation excuse me genesis
[1:04:57] chapter
[1:04:58] uh
[1:04:59] chapter 3
[1:05:02] and verse 24
[1:05:05] so he drove out the man
[1:05:15] let me start at verse 22
[1:05:17] so we can understand who the he is and
[1:05:20] and the lord god said behold the man has
[1:05:23] become as one of us to know good and
[1:05:25] evil and now lest he put forth his hand
[1:05:27] and take also of the tree of life and
[1:05:30] eat and live forever
[1:05:31] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[1:05:34] from the garden of eden to till the
[1:05:36] ground from whence he was taken so he
[1:05:38] drove out the man
[1:05:40] and he placed at the east of the garden
[1:05:44] of eden cherubims
[1:05:46] cherubums plural
[1:05:49] and a flaming sword
[1:05:51] which turned every way
[1:05:54] to keep the way of the tree of life
[1:05:58] now they turned
[1:06:00] every way
[1:06:02] and if you'll go and you'll read in
[1:06:03] ezekiel
[1:06:05] ezekiel sees them and he says everywhere
[1:06:07] they turned they went straight forward
[1:06:11] because one was
[1:06:13] one face was facing east one was facing
[1:06:16] west one was facing south one was facing
[1:06:18] north
[1:06:20] and so no matter which way
[1:06:23] they turned there was a face to go that
[1:06:25] direction
[1:06:27] they were they were able to go straight
[1:06:29] forward
[1:06:30] because they faced north south east and
[1:06:32] west in all directions
[1:06:37] and these cherubims now going back to
[1:06:41] the message here
[1:06:42] first mentioned was placed at the east
[1:06:45] gate of the garden
[1:06:47] going four ways i should have made that
[1:06:49] a little different from that i can i
[1:06:51] can't do justly to god now brother rams
[1:06:53] drawing
[1:06:54] here
[1:06:55] i can't do justly to god's orders and
[1:06:58] things like that but i just so that
[1:06:59] you'll know what i mean
[1:07:01] there's the garden of eden and this is
[1:07:03] the gate right here opens up here swings
[1:07:06] out and at this gate there was cherubims
[1:07:12] cherubims and remember it doesn't say a
[1:07:15] cherubim it said cherubims
[1:07:17] cherubums was placed there to guard what
[1:07:20] the tree of life
[1:07:22] that's what they was to guard
[1:07:24] the way of the tree of life the way
[1:07:28] who is the way
[1:07:31] jesus jesus says i am the way the truth
[1:07:34] and the life
[1:07:37] where is it reflected from
[1:07:40] here is the holy place here are the
[1:07:43] cherubims
[1:07:45] now watch put all this down now
[1:07:48] while he's saying this you have to
[1:07:50] imagine
[1:07:51] like we did this morning you have to
[1:07:54] imagine this
[1:07:55] this
[1:07:56] old testament
[1:08:00] tabernacle
[1:08:07] where is it reflected from
[1:08:09] here is the holy place
[1:08:11] here are the cherubims
[1:08:14] now watch put all this down here is the
[1:08:17] holy this holiest of holies holy of
[1:08:21] holies
[1:08:22] this is the holy place and here is the
[1:08:25] sea so he's saying
[1:08:27] holiest of holies
[1:08:30] holy place
[1:08:32] the sea
[1:08:33] we understand that
[1:08:38] and here is the sea and here is the
[1:08:40] light candles the seven that's reflect
[1:08:44] the light from here in here in here in
[1:08:47] here in here in here so he's showing
[1:08:50] those seven candles
[1:08:53] see
[1:08:54] what are they reflect
[1:08:56] they are guarding and reflecting
[1:09:00] with the fire of god
[1:09:02] the way to the tree of life
[1:09:07] these golden cherubims are reflecting
[1:09:12] and guarding the way to the tree of life
[1:09:16] now you can see it if you're imagining
[1:09:19] the old testament
[1:09:21] tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:09:23] but but then you can see it when you
[1:09:26] begin to think of a garden
[1:09:28] and you think of of this garden of eden
[1:09:30] and this gate
[1:09:32] and you can see these four
[1:09:34] cherubims
[1:09:35] two cherubims four cherubims
[1:09:38] guarding the way of the tree of life
[1:09:41] with flaming swords
[1:09:46] all right now hold on
[1:09:50] guarding and reflecting with the fire of
[1:09:52] god the way to the tree of life see it
[1:09:56] can't come from over here presbyterian
[1:09:59] seminary or a pentecostal seminary
[1:10:02] it's got to come from here reflecting
[1:10:06] the light
[1:10:07] all right
[1:10:08] you notice
[1:10:10] these cherubims that john saw here must
[1:10:13] have been interested
[1:10:15] in keeping the tree of life
[1:10:18] so they must be interested in human
[1:10:21] beings
[1:10:22] or read genesis getting back to genesis
[1:10:24] again they kept
[1:10:27] the tree of life guarded it the way of
[1:10:29] life the way of life how is the way
[1:10:33] jesus said i am that way i am that bread
[1:10:37] come down from god out of heaven if a
[1:10:39] man eats this bread he'll live forever
[1:10:42] now there is a way back to that tree of
[1:10:45] life you get it
[1:10:48] oh my
[1:10:50] oh
[1:10:52] there is a way back to that tree of life
[1:10:55] jesus said i am that way
[1:10:58] oh thank god it wasn't just an
[1:11:00] open thing of
[1:11:02] you fell at the garden now they've got
[1:11:05] cherubims with flaming swords
[1:11:07] no more way to the tree of life no he
[1:11:09] says there is a way jesus said
[1:11:12] i am that way.
[1:11:15] oh my
[1:11:20] now at this i want to show
[1:11:23] now and make this sure it's
[1:11:27] i love this
[1:11:30] it's an altar
[1:11:34] now this must have been an altar
[1:11:37] at the garden of eden
[1:11:39] i'll tell you why
[1:11:41] do you remember both cain and abel came
[1:11:43] up here to worship
[1:11:46] so that shows
[1:11:48] that god's altar was moved and set here
[1:11:51] at the garden of eden
[1:11:52] and the only way back to eden
[1:11:55] is by the altar
[1:11:58] here you are again see
[1:12:00] back to eden through the altar
[1:12:03] and they were to keep that way there
[1:12:07] guard it
[1:12:08] they couldn't get back there
[1:12:10] until this altar was covered with blood
[1:12:19] oh god can't people see it see nothing
[1:12:22] but the blood
[1:12:24] there has to be an atonement a mercy
[1:12:27] seat there
[1:12:28] this altar of judgment must become a
[1:12:31] mercy seat and when this altar if the
[1:12:34] blood's lifted there will stand on that
[1:12:37] judgment day the fire of god's wrath to
[1:12:41] guard that tree again
[1:12:43] oh
[1:12:45] church i promise you
[1:12:47] if you go and listen to this tape you'll
[1:12:48] be so blessed i i was simply having to
[1:12:51] pull
[1:12:52] pieces out
[1:12:54] because we would just be here all night
[1:12:58] ah it's so good
[1:13:00] it talks about how that john
[1:13:03] there at the beginning of
[1:13:04] chapter 4
[1:13:06] he's saying when he saw this throne
[1:13:11] oh here i'm in genesis i'm going that
[1:13:13] doesn't make sense
[1:13:16] john says
[1:13:19] ah
[1:13:19] there was a throne in heaven
[1:13:21] i meant chapter four and verse two and
[1:13:23] on one sat the throne and he that sat
[1:13:25] was to look as jasper a sardine stone
[1:13:27] there was a rainbow round about the
[1:13:29] throne in sight round about the throne
[1:13:31] were four and 20 seats and upon the
[1:13:32] seats i saw four and twenty elders
[1:13:34] sitting clothed in white raiment they
[1:13:36] had on their heads crowns of gold and
[1:13:37] out of the throne proceeded lightnings
[1:13:39] and thunderings and voices brother said
[1:13:43] that's judgment that shows the bride has
[1:13:45] been is gone
[1:13:47] the bride's been
[1:13:48] she's been raptured at this point and
[1:13:51] now thunderings and lightnings is
[1:13:53] judgment it's speaking of judgment now
[1:13:58] oh my it's tremendous
[1:14:00] because it it it helps you to see the
[1:14:03] order and the process of the way god is
[1:14:06] moving things we're not
[1:14:08] over here and then over here and then
[1:14:09] over here and then over here no
[1:14:13] through that after the seven church ages
[1:14:16] once that bride is lifted there's it's
[1:14:19] not a mercy seat anymore there's
[1:14:22] judgment taking place
[1:14:33] and when this altar if the blood is
[1:14:34] lifted there will stand on that judgment
[1:14:37] day the fire of god's wrath to guard
[1:14:39] that tree again
[1:14:41] only one thing will enter into this gate
[1:14:45] to eden again will be through the blood
[1:14:48] of jesus christ you see it
[1:14:52] and i i just
[1:14:54] i put a note here
[1:14:58] speaking of those cherubims
[1:15:00] guarding the way of the tree of life
[1:15:02] with flaming swords
[1:15:04] and and and i i put this note of
[1:15:07] ephesians chapter six and verse 17
[1:15:13] it starts off take
[1:15:15] the the
[1:15:17] helmet of salvation it says and the
[1:15:19] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:15:22] god
[1:15:24] and so we see
[1:15:26] that
[1:15:27] if you would look at this in a type that
[1:15:29] those four creatures guarding the way of
[1:15:32] the tree of life guarding the throne of
[1:15:35] god guarding the altar
[1:15:38] they were guarding with the sword of the
[1:15:41] spirit of god
[1:15:43] which is the word of god
[1:15:49] and i didn't i didn't uh
[1:15:53] put this into my notes but later in the
[1:15:55] message brother brandon says i want to
[1:15:57] show you something he says notice those
[1:16:00] cherubims at the garden of eden were
[1:16:02] keeping
[1:16:05] keeping adam and eve and cain and abel
[1:16:07] keeping them out from keeping them from
[1:16:11] the the tree of life he says but now
[1:16:15] these creatures are driving us back
[1:16:19] toward that tree of life
[1:16:21] now they're not trying to keep anybody
[1:16:24] from it they're pointing us to
[1:16:26] the tree of life
[1:16:30] oh my we're so blessed
[1:16:35] god so good to me
[1:16:39] i love that how that song was just sung
[1:16:42] like that we are so blessed
[1:16:45] now notice
[1:16:47] now they guard the mercy seat
[1:16:50] when god is in his shekinah glory
[1:16:54] where
[1:16:55] where was the cut the shekinah glory
[1:16:58] at the mercy seat
[1:17:00] is that right they guard that shekinah
[1:17:03] glory hmm
[1:17:06] listen friends
[1:17:08] then it goes to show
[1:17:10] that every scallywag
[1:17:12] can't come there and take of that
[1:17:16] you've got to be prepared
[1:17:19] before you come
[1:17:21] into the presence of it
[1:17:30] you begin to think about that high
[1:17:32] priest
[1:17:33] and again you go and you read in exodus
[1:17:36] chapter 24 and 25 and 26
[1:17:39] and god is giving very specific
[1:17:42] instructions
[1:17:44] not only how to build the tabernacle
[1:17:48] but also the furniture that's to go into
[1:17:51] that tabernacle
[1:17:53] and
[1:17:54] how the
[1:17:56] high priests and the priests are to
[1:17:58] dress themselves
[1:18:01] they're to come in a very specific type
[1:18:04] of clothing they're to come
[1:18:07] and and not just offer for the
[1:18:09] congregation they've got to come and
[1:18:11] offer for themselves as well
[1:18:15] and when they walk they've got
[1:18:17] pomegranates and bells on their dress
[1:18:19] and when they walk it's to make a noise
[1:18:22] that sounds holy
[1:18:24] holy holy before god
[1:18:27] holy and if and if if they just came in
[1:18:30] any old way dressed in any old thing
[1:18:32] without the blood
[1:18:36] they could die
[1:18:39] and that example is given in this in
[1:18:41] this message brother branham says
[1:18:43] remember aaron's sons or eli's sons came
[1:18:46] in with strange fire and they tried to
[1:18:49] light those candles with strange fire
[1:18:51] strange fire was a fire that was not
[1:18:54] lit from god was not lit from that altar
[1:18:57] it was their own lighting it was some
[1:18:59] other
[1:19:00] type of lighting but if they came in
[1:19:02] there and they did they tried it and
[1:19:04] they died
[1:19:08] and it's and it's easy to think of the
[1:19:11] priest the priest but you are have
[1:19:14] become that priest
[1:19:16] you have become that now i would say
[1:19:19] if i could back up a little bit before
[1:19:22] you were that priest
[1:19:24] this is why when i was reading in
[1:19:26] hebrews when paul is expressing to the
[1:19:29] believer
[1:19:30] that
[1:19:31] christ jesus christ
[1:19:35] has come after the order of melchizedek
[1:19:39] the high priest
[1:19:41] he came after that order not after the
[1:19:44] aaronic priest that had to be through
[1:19:46] its certain lineage jesus was even born
[1:19:48] of the tribe of judah not not the tribe
[1:19:51] of levi
[1:19:53] but paul's saying he's a high priest not
[1:19:55] after the levitical order but after a
[1:19:58] higher order than that
[1:20:01] he came after the order of melchizedek
[1:20:04] who was without father without mother
[1:20:07] with no no days no beginning of days and
[1:20:09] no ending of life this is jesus christ
[1:20:15] and when you can get that you could say
[1:20:18] my jesus christ the supreme deity of god
[1:20:22] lies within jesus christ and then you
[1:20:26] realize that the promise that the life
[1:20:29] that was in jesus christ has been
[1:20:32] promised to them who would be who would
[1:20:35] repent be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:20:38] christ for the remission of sins you
[1:20:40] shall also
[1:20:42] receive this
[1:20:44] life now that sounds bold but peter on
[1:20:50] the day of pentecost had the keys and
[1:20:52] the question was what are you going to
[1:20:55] do with that key
[1:20:57] you know what that key means peter do
[1:21:00] you have a real revelation of what
[1:21:02] you're talking about if he didn't then
[1:21:05] he presumptuously
[1:21:06] said what he said on the day of
[1:21:08] pentecost
[1:21:10] i don't believe peter just
[1:21:11] presumptuously said it because
[1:21:14] the gifts
[1:21:16] and manifestations of god followed
[1:21:20] what he said
[1:21:26] 3 000 and then five thousand were added
[1:21:29] and then it just kept going
[1:21:32] that very life that high priest and now
[1:21:36] you have become
[1:21:38] kings and priests
[1:21:58] now they guard the mercy seat
[1:22:00] when god is in his shekinah glory where
[1:22:02] was the shekinah glory
[1:22:04] at the mercy seat is that right
[1:22:06] they guard that shekinah glory hmm
[1:22:10] listen friends
[1:22:11] then it goes to show that every
[1:22:13] scallywag can't come there and take of
[1:22:16] that
[1:22:18] you've got to be prepared before you
[1:22:22] come into the presence of it
[1:22:26] now
[1:22:28] it's
[1:22:29] it it's in in between here where brother
[1:22:32] branham is using that scripture in
[1:22:34] ephesians ephesians that we read this
[1:22:36] morning that we've been washed by the
[1:22:39] water of the word
[1:22:41] that you've got to be washed by that
[1:22:44] water first that's the waters of
[1:22:47] separation
[1:22:49] it separates you the the the word of god
[1:22:53] is what cleans your life
[1:22:56] and even makes you
[1:23:07] how can i say
[1:23:10] gives you the desire g
[1:23:13] gives you a
[1:23:17] gives you a clear
[1:23:19] clean
[1:23:21] approach
[1:23:22] even in your mind
[1:23:25] to come
[1:23:26] to god
[1:23:29] and say god
[1:23:32] would you receive
[1:23:34] my offering
[1:23:37] i want to give to you
[1:23:39] this
[1:23:40] living sacrifice which is our reasonable
[1:23:43] service
[1:23:45] is to present
[1:23:46] ourselves a living sacrifice to him
[1:23:56] now he goes into this
[1:24:01] speaking of judah and i i didn't back up
[1:24:03] enough here
[1:24:04] but he says now he was the lion of the
[1:24:08] tribe of judah
[1:24:14] now anybody that's ever read the bible
[1:24:17] know what dan's number was or what that
[1:24:20] what dan oh i mean what yeah what dan
[1:24:22] was he was a eagle
[1:24:25] that's right he was an eagle somebody's
[1:24:28] been reading the bible he was an eagle
[1:24:36] let me just stop here for a moment just
[1:24:38] so i can explain this
[1:24:42] at the tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:24:45] you had the 12 tribes of israel
[1:24:49] and each of those tribes
[1:24:53] had banners
[1:24:55] representing
[1:24:57] representing their tribe
[1:24:59] that we belong to
[1:25:01] the tribe of dan we belong to the tribe
[1:25:03] of judah we belong to the tribe of ruben
[1:25:06] we belong to this tribe and what they
[1:25:08] had was banners
[1:25:11] with a symbol that represented their
[1:25:14] tribe now
[1:25:16] you can read this in your bible when
[1:25:18] they camped around that tabernacle in
[1:25:21] the wilderness they camped three tribes
[1:25:24] on every side north south east and west
[1:25:28] and
[1:25:29] the and with
[1:25:31] in those three tribes one of those
[1:25:34] tribes was to be a representative for
[1:25:37] the three tribes
[1:25:38] and they would hold their banner
[1:25:41] now the
[1:25:42] the
[1:25:43] symbol
[1:25:45] banner for the tribe of judah was a lion
[1:25:50] the tribe of judah the lion of the tribe
[1:25:53] of judah
[1:25:55] the symbol
[1:25:58] to represent dan
[1:26:01] was an eagle and that's what random is
[1:26:04] talking about right here is these banner
[1:26:07] representations
[1:26:08] of these tribes
[1:26:10] as they camped around
[1:26:13] all the way around
[1:26:15] four sides around the tabernacle
[1:26:20] i hope that you're understanding these
[1:26:23] four
[1:26:24] camping around guarding around the
[1:26:27] throne of god
[1:26:29] now the reuben i'm continuing on now the
[1:26:32] reuben was the man he was the first one
[1:26:36] the weakest one of the bunch didn't
[1:26:38] jacob say so in genesis 49 reuben thou
[1:26:42] art the first of my strength but like
[1:26:45] water you went up on my couch and
[1:26:47] defiled my couch and lived with his
[1:26:49] father's concubine see that's the
[1:26:52] immorals of the human being you see the
[1:26:55] animal don't have them immorals the lion
[1:26:57] none of these has that but the man does
[1:27:01] run with the next man's wife and so
[1:27:03] forth just like just the same thing
[1:27:05] everything's completed
[1:27:08] now this down here this dan was an eagle
[1:27:11] this reuben was the man's face and
[1:27:13] ephraim is the ox
[1:27:16] now you get the picture there ephraim
[1:27:18] there's the way they camped in the bible
[1:27:22] so now you see
[1:27:24] that there was four representations
[1:27:27] around even that tabernacle in the
[1:27:29] wilderness a banner of the lion a banner
[1:27:32] of the ox a banner of the man and a
[1:27:35] banner of the eagle
[1:27:37] you see the same thing
[1:27:39] this same pattern
[1:27:43] then not only do you see it on that camp
[1:27:46] around the camp but now you go inside
[1:27:50] into the holiest of holies and you've
[1:27:52] got two cherubims on the mercy seat and
[1:27:55] those cherubims have got the face of a
[1:27:57] lion an ox a man and an eagle
[1:28:04] then you look
[1:28:06] back
[1:28:07] at
[1:28:08] the garden of eden when the man is put
[1:28:11] out of the garden you see these same
[1:28:14] cherubims guarding the tree of life
[1:28:25] now
[1:28:26] we're living in another age glory
[1:28:30] oh i love this age don't you
[1:28:33] now god has a mercy seat today to be
[1:28:36] guarded
[1:28:38] you believe that
[1:28:40] where's the mercy seat found
[1:28:44] in the heart of man
[1:28:47] where did it come
[1:28:49] in the heart of man
[1:28:51] at the day of pentecost when the holy
[1:28:54] ghost which is god
[1:28:57] come into the human heart is that right
[1:29:03] oh my
[1:29:05] so now we're seeing
[1:29:07] what
[1:29:09] moses saw
[1:29:11] when he's writing about
[1:29:13] genus in genesis about the garden these
[1:29:15] cherubims
[1:29:17] then we see moses shown this pattern
[1:29:19] again in the old testament for that for
[1:29:22] the pattern of the tabernacle we see it
[1:29:24] again
[1:29:25] then ezekiel sees the same thing again
[1:29:29] the word of god uh the ark moving on a
[1:29:33] cart and everywhere it went it went
[1:29:35] straight forward and it was lifted up
[1:29:38] then we see john showing it again in its
[1:29:42] resting place in heaven
[1:29:44] but today it's still here
[1:29:48] that mercy seat is still here
[1:29:52] on earth
[1:29:53] in the hearts of men and women
[1:29:59] well
[1:30:02] if the mercy seat is here
[1:30:05] and if that altar
[1:30:08] at the garden of eden had guards
[1:30:10] protecting it
[1:30:12] and if the mercy seat here at the in the
[1:30:16] old testament
[1:30:17] tabernacle in the wilderness had guards
[1:30:20] protecting it
[1:30:22] and we see over in glory
[1:30:24] over in that throne
[1:30:27] god is resting
[1:30:29] in
[1:30:30] that john is seeing when judgment comes
[1:30:33] and we see these four
[1:30:34] creatures what about today
[1:30:38] is there still a guard for the word of
[1:30:41] god
[1:30:43] now let's read on now remember
[1:30:46] god has got some guards
[1:30:49] for that for that mercy seat
[1:30:52] what is that mercy seat they guard
[1:30:55] all right
[1:30:57] matthew on the east
[1:30:59] luke
[1:31:00] mark
[1:31:01] and john
[1:31:03] all of their four gospels
[1:31:06] vindicate
[1:31:08] the book of acts to come
[1:31:11] they guard it anywhere you want to look
[1:31:14] at it
[1:31:16] oh my
[1:31:19] now
[1:31:21] that was paragraph 326
[1:31:25] the next is that quote that i have comes
[1:31:28] in paragraph 340 but in between there
[1:31:30] brother branham begins to show
[1:31:33] how that god down through the gospels
[1:31:38] that those four gospels were the
[1:31:40] framework
[1:31:42] to protect to guard
[1:31:45] what was going to come to manifest in
[1:31:48] the book of acts
[1:31:50] that when jesus was walking the shores
[1:31:53] of galilee when he's
[1:31:55] teaching his disciples when he's living
[1:31:57] his life the the very life of god is in
[1:32:00] flesh and he's demonstrating the will of
[1:32:04] god in a man
[1:32:06] so when we now can look back
[1:32:09] retrospectively
[1:32:10] and say what would what would be an
[1:32:13] example who's the example i want to
[1:32:17] pattern my life after
[1:32:19] after we would all say
[1:32:21] jesus christ
[1:32:23] jesus christ is the perfect pattern we
[1:32:27] we
[1:32:28] we liked the pattern of moses but moses
[1:32:30] lost his temper struck the rock we liked
[1:32:33] the pattern of of of uh
[1:32:37] let's say jacob but jacob lied we liked
[1:32:40] the pattern
[1:32:42] of abraham but abraham lied as well
[1:32:45] we liked the pattern of these men but
[1:32:47] they
[1:32:48] had imperfections
[1:32:50] but when we look at the life of christ
[1:32:54] it's a perfect pattern
[1:32:57] of what god desired in men and women
[1:33:01] and we say god that's what i want to be
[1:33:03] and so when we fall short we say oh i
[1:33:06] feel so dirty i feel so dirty but that's
[1:33:08] what he lets us know but that's why i
[1:33:11] gave jesus christ that's when i came in
[1:33:13] in flesh was to
[1:33:15] to to be that propitiation for you
[1:33:25] we say thank you lord and he says
[1:33:28] it's it's over we as we talked about
[1:33:30] this morning i don't even remember it i
[1:33:32] see you righteous
[1:33:34] i see it a finished work it's a finished
[1:33:37] work you're perfect you're perfect you
[1:33:39] go oh lord
[1:33:40] give me that vision
[1:33:42] give me that revelation
[1:33:45] but he goes and he says what is it that
[1:33:47] they're guarding and he and he talks
[1:33:49] about uh the holy ghost and the baptism
[1:33:52] of the holy ghost and how that uh when
[1:33:54] you read in the books of matthew mark
[1:33:57] luke and john
[1:33:59] that these gospels
[1:34:02] are are when you read the words of jesus
[1:34:05] christ
[1:34:07] saying
[1:34:08] i will
[1:34:08] i
[1:34:09] i will not leave you
[1:34:12] comfortless
[1:34:14] but i'll be with you
[1:34:16] even in you to the end of the world
[1:34:19] i'll send you a comforter and that
[1:34:21] comforter won't only be with you he'll
[1:34:23] be in you you'll be a teacher
[1:34:26] what is it it's a promise
[1:34:29] of the holy ghost to come a promise that
[1:34:33] there is an infilling that there is an
[1:34:35] indwelling of god
[1:34:38] for a man and a woman
[1:34:41] he goes on and he says what about divine
[1:34:44] healing and he reads uh i think mark
[1:34:48] uh mark 16 and and these signs shall
[1:34:51] follow them that belief
[1:34:54] and he's
[1:34:55] showing that these these gospels guard
[1:34:59] those precious promises of god for the
[1:35:02] believer
[1:35:04] so you're it's not just a i hope well
[1:35:07] that was good for so and so but what
[1:35:09] about me
[1:35:10] no
[1:35:11] those guards are there to let you know
[1:35:14] it's for you and the proof of it is the
[1:35:16] book of acts
[1:35:19] you notice it's not jesus christ himself
[1:35:22] doing these anymore you see these acts
[1:35:24] of the holy ghost in the apostles
[1:35:28] now you see
[1:35:29] uh men like peter and john going
[1:35:32] by the gay beautiful and a man who's
[1:35:34] crippled
[1:35:35] it's this isn't where's
[1:35:38] you know or is this jesus that you talk
[1:35:40] about and they said look look on us
[1:35:43] not that they had that healing virtue
[1:35:45] but they said silver and gold i don't
[1:35:47] have but such as i do have
[1:35:50] i give unto you in the name of jesus
[1:35:53] christ of nazareth rise up and walk and
[1:35:56] there was demonstrated right there the
[1:35:59] life of god in an in in a man and woman
[1:36:03] or those were both men there but
[1:36:06] but it was to whosoever
[1:36:08] will so we say praise god the baptism of
[1:36:12] the holy ghost is for me
[1:36:14] praise god divine healing is for me
[1:36:18] praise god these pentecostal blessings
[1:36:20] are for me
[1:36:23] and he takes you through matthew mark
[1:36:25] luke and john showing you that those
[1:36:28] words of god that those gospels were
[1:36:31] written they were given as guards to
[1:36:34] protect to guard the book of acts to
[1:36:37] show you that this book of acts wasn't a
[1:36:39] fluke it wasn't a a once-over thing and
[1:36:42] then it was it was done but this was
[1:36:44] promises to you to your children and to
[1:36:47] them as far off even as many as the lord
[1:36:50] our god shall call
[1:36:52] oh my
[1:37:05] now
[1:37:07] this is where i say i'm closing
[1:37:10] and you all know what that means
[1:37:15] it could be another hour
[1:37:17] but i hope not
[1:37:20] did you think that god don't put a guard
[1:37:23] around his word
[1:37:27] see
[1:37:28] if that ox lion man eagle isn't still
[1:37:32] setting
[1:37:33] at those gates right here on earth right
[1:37:35] now
[1:37:39] here's the gospels the four gospels see
[1:37:42] and you notice
[1:37:44] everywhere they went
[1:37:47] they went straight forward
[1:37:50] they don't contradict one another
[1:37:53] oh my
[1:37:55] amen
[1:37:57] praise the lord for that
[1:38:03] they stay with one another oh thank you
[1:38:06] lord see
[1:38:08] one goes with the shrewdness of a man
[1:38:12] the other one goes with the swiftness of
[1:38:15] an eagle
[1:38:17] the other one's a pastor
[1:38:19] one's evangelist to fly like evangelist
[1:38:22] see the other one's pastor the one other
[1:38:25] one's sturdy
[1:38:27] the other one's shrewd
[1:38:29] see
[1:38:30] guarded on every side
[1:38:33] god guarding this holy ghost gospel
[1:38:37] believe it brother
[1:38:38] all
[1:38:42] right i think that's just
[1:38:46] so beautifully put
[1:38:48] if you catch what he's saying there is
[1:38:50] that look
[1:38:55] god hath set in the church
[1:38:58] some apostles
[1:39:00] some prophets
[1:39:02] some pastors teachers and evangelists
[1:39:05] that's
[1:39:06] god has done that
[1:39:10] god has called men put calls in their
[1:39:13] life to be that now you say yeah well
[1:39:15] i've seen a lot of us a lot of men that
[1:39:17] think they are and i we had we we i
[1:39:20] didn't understand that
[1:39:25] you say there sure is a lot of
[1:39:26] counterfeit money out there i know that
[1:39:30] but that
[1:39:31] means that there's got to be a real
[1:39:36] somewhere there's got to be a real
[1:39:39] and it's said that god has done that
[1:39:42] that's what we as believers we say god
[1:39:46] i'm resting in that
[1:39:48] i'm trusting that you will put in the
[1:39:51] church
[1:39:52] a pastor that you will put
[1:39:55] you will give the evangelists to some
[1:39:57] you'll give you'll give
[1:39:59] an apostle missionaries to others you'll
[1:40:01] give teachers to some
[1:40:04] for the for the for the building of the
[1:40:06] body of christ you know what each body
[1:40:09] has need of
[1:40:10] we're trusting in you god to bring that
[1:40:15] and oh look how he does it it's so
[1:40:17] beautiful sometimes
[1:40:20] sometimes we need the swiftness of an
[1:40:23] evangelist to come in with the fire of
[1:40:25] god to shake us up to say
[1:40:27] children of god
[1:40:29] get on your knees repent before god
[1:40:32] clean your lives up
[1:40:35] say my that evangelist he sure is so
[1:40:38] fiery why is he preached like that
[1:40:41] then you got the teacher and he says
[1:40:43] let's walk through this
[1:40:46] let's take a look at this
[1:40:48] closer
[1:40:49] let's pull this scripture apart word by
[1:40:52] word and see the meaning of this you say
[1:40:55] oh
[1:40:56] my thank god for the teacher who helps
[1:40:59] us to be grooted and grounded in the
[1:41:02] word of god so we have a clear
[1:41:04] understanding of what it means
[1:41:07] then you've got the pastor and he's a ox
[1:41:10] he's a burden bearer he's a man who can
[1:41:13] bear the burdens who can who can take
[1:41:16] the weight of you know pastor we need to
[1:41:18] have a talk and two hour counseling
[1:41:20] session and you know i got to tell you
[1:41:22] about my troubles and i got a real
[1:41:23] problem with this brother and this
[1:41:25] sister over here and then you got that
[1:41:27] same brother and sister over there that
[1:41:28] say pastor we need to talk i got a real
[1:41:30] problem with this brother and this and
[1:41:32] that man is able to be to bear the
[1:41:35] burden as brother branham say not take
[1:41:37] sides
[1:41:39] but to hear both of them out and to
[1:41:42] bring them into the truth
[1:41:46] i thank god for these things god has
[1:41:49] protected this word
[1:41:51] god down through time has protected this
[1:41:57] he hasn't left us without guards we're
[1:41:59] not without a homeland security
[1:42:02] believers
[1:42:04] we don't have to look at the governments
[1:42:06] and say oh what is this world coming to
[1:42:08] oh what is going to happen to the us
[1:42:10] we're pilgrims and strangers here
[1:42:14] we're seeking a city to come
[1:42:17] who's builder and maker is god
[1:42:20] where we need to look where's our
[1:42:22] security where's our protection where's
[1:42:26] the guards that will guard my children
[1:42:28] that will guard my daughters from the
[1:42:30] predators of this world that will guard
[1:42:32] my daughters from the fashions that try
[1:42:35] to suck them into the world system
[1:42:39] where is the protection for our sons to
[1:42:42] become men of god
[1:42:46] to become real husbands to become real
[1:42:49] fathers
[1:42:50] where's our protection as believers it's
[1:42:53] in the word of god
[1:42:58] god's got it in here and if if if you
[1:43:01] can
[1:43:02] if you can get into your bible you can
[1:43:04] read these things and not read it as a
[1:43:06] history book but say you know that it's
[1:43:08] good for me i believe that
[1:43:11] not only will you start now listen and
[1:43:14] this is where i believe that brother
[1:43:16] billy graham did such a fantastic job
[1:43:20] at getting people to understand that do
[1:43:23] you understand who
[1:43:26] that god sent his son jesus
[1:43:29] to die for you and the world says
[1:43:32] we see it you you preached it such a
[1:43:35] nice way and then brother branham would
[1:43:37] would even uh acknowledge and say and
[1:43:39] i'm so thankful for a man like oral
[1:43:41] roberts with bulldog faith
[1:43:44] who could say if you can just believe
[1:43:47] you can have what you ask for put your
[1:43:49] hand even upon your radios
[1:43:54] this is true
[1:43:58] and god used those men and i'm so
[1:44:00] thankful for that
[1:44:03] but church
[1:44:05] i i i'm not belittling that and saying
[1:44:08] but to that
[1:44:10] i'm just saying this
[1:44:12] we have been given a word to let us know
[1:44:15] that
[1:44:16] when god came
[1:44:18] in the days of sodom and gomorrah and i
[1:44:20] believe we're living in a day just like
[1:44:22] that
[1:44:24] that when he came and was calling for
[1:44:27] people to come out of that come out of
[1:44:30] that
[1:44:31] he also
[1:44:33] met with abraham and his people
[1:44:38] and we've been given a a a a word that
[1:44:41] is more than than just uh
[1:44:44] a joseph speaking to his brethren we've
[1:44:47] been given
[1:44:49] a honeymoon
[1:44:51] type of talk
[1:44:53] that look
[1:44:55] i enjoy the fellowship in the kitchen
[1:44:58] it was real good around the food and
[1:45:00] a nice talk
[1:45:02] and i enjoyed going into the living room
[1:45:05] and kicking my feet up and maybe getting
[1:45:07] to know you a little bit more
[1:45:09] but
[1:45:10] to say
[1:45:12] no this i've got
[1:45:14] personal secrets
[1:45:18] personal things
[1:45:20] i've got a letter about predestination
[1:45:22] for you
[1:45:27] i say yeah but i mean
[1:45:29] it's right there in the bible
[1:45:30] predestination that's for everybody oh
[1:45:32] but not everybody can accept it
[1:45:37] not all will receive
[1:45:39] the truth of
[1:45:41] before the foundation of the world the
[1:45:43] lamb being slain
[1:45:45] and you being predestinated and your
[1:45:47] name on a lamb's book of life that
[1:45:49] cannot be blotted out
[1:45:52] not all will receive that
[1:45:55] but for those that can receive that
[1:45:59] those
[1:46:01] they can go on
[1:46:02] and they can say
[1:46:06] the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:46:08] receiving the life of jesus christ
[1:46:11] and the evidence
[1:46:13] knoweth it's not speaking in tongues
[1:46:16] it's not shouting
[1:46:18] it's being able to receive the word of
[1:46:22] god
[1:46:27] and believe it and say amen
[1:46:30] to every word of it
[1:46:32] and not just say it with their lips say
[1:46:35] like no i'm not saying just say the word
[1:46:36] amen but their life
[1:46:39] says amen to that
[1:46:40] so so be it
[1:46:45] well but you know but you're sick i mean
[1:46:47] you're sick i know but god said by his
[1:46:50] stripes i'm healed
[1:46:51] and i'm gonna walk like that
[1:46:54] you mean you actually are going to walk
[1:46:56] even though you're you're hobbling
[1:46:58] you're still going to believe that god
[1:47:00] finished the healing for you i do
[1:47:03] i do i just believe it i believe it i
[1:47:05] believe he'll what he started he will
[1:47:07] finish
[1:47:09] that sounds like divine healing you know
[1:47:11] isn't that what those old-time
[1:47:13] pentecostals believe yeah i guess that's
[1:47:15] what those old-time pentecostals believe
[1:47:17] i guess i'm an old-time pentecostal
[1:47:25] well
[1:47:26] i believe that if if god saved me and
[1:47:28] god filled my heart he can keep me clean
[1:47:33] not just from one revival to the next i
[1:47:36] believe that tomorrow come monday
[1:47:38] morning i can
[1:47:40] i don't have to worry about falling off
[1:47:42] the wagon
[1:47:45] i believe god if god brought me here
[1:47:48] he'll keep me here
[1:47:50] and he'll keep me clean
[1:47:53] and
[1:47:56] and i guess i believe in sanctification
[1:47:58] well man isn't that what those old-time
[1:48:01] methodists believed yeah i guess i'm an
[1:48:03] old-time methodist
[1:48:06] oh what why do you want
[1:48:08] what do you want
[1:48:09] you want a title bro brandon said i'm a
[1:48:12] i'm a
[1:48:14] baptist nazarene pentecostal
[1:48:18] is that what you wanna you wanna pin
[1:48:20] that one i'll take it
[1:48:32] later in the book of revelation we see
[1:48:34] these creatures again
[1:48:36] in the opening of the seals
[1:48:39] we see this
[1:48:41] lion
[1:48:44] this ox this man and this flying eagle
[1:48:53] and with the revelation of the seven
[1:48:55] seals
[1:48:58] we see that it dovetails perfectly
[1:49:01] with the seven church ages
[1:49:04] and we see how that in those
[1:49:07] first four seals
[1:49:10] those anointings
[1:49:12] both both anointings this the anointing
[1:49:15] of the spirit of christ and the
[1:49:17] anointing of the spirit of antichrist
[1:49:18] both riding through those ages through
[1:49:20] history
[1:49:22] from the day of pentecost until the
[1:49:24] rapture takes place we see those spirits
[1:49:27] and they're intertwined brother talks
[1:49:29] about them being intertwined those
[1:49:30] spirits
[1:49:32] we can see it in the framework of the
[1:49:33] church
[1:49:36] the so-called church
[1:49:38] system
[1:49:39] we see it
[1:49:41] we see god pleading to the church
[1:49:44] to the churches
[1:49:45] come out come out
[1:49:47] don't be partakers come out of that and
[1:49:49] we see the spirit of antichrist who
[1:49:52] who's who's
[1:49:53] bringing in uh
[1:49:56] false doctrine false teachings
[1:49:59] uh love of money greed
[1:50:02] trying to to to to to rob the
[1:50:05] relationship between a a man and god
[1:50:09] we see that through those seals and as
[1:50:12] we see those
[1:50:14] horse riders we see satan trying to
[1:50:16] extinguish the light of god through
[1:50:18] those
[1:50:19] horse that horse rider on those four
[1:50:21] horses
[1:50:22] and we see that god had servants
[1:50:26] with the spirit of god and the anointing
[1:50:29] of those four guards
[1:50:34] and god protected
[1:50:36] his word
[1:50:49] and i said it like that for a purpose
[1:50:57] god protected his word
[1:51:01] so many times we want god to protect our
[1:51:04] feelings
[1:51:06] for god to protect our intentions
[1:51:17] but i read for you at the beginning of
[1:51:18] the service how that we
[1:51:20] brother branham says we
[1:51:23] we sometimes
[1:51:25] look at ministers
[1:51:26] and if they can bring their thought
[1:51:28] across so eloquently we think that had
[1:51:30] to be inspiration of god well it could
[1:51:32] have been but it might not have been
[1:51:36] or we think well you know that church is
[1:51:38] packed to the gills there's got to be
[1:51:41] god moving there
[1:51:42] well maybe maybe not
[1:51:50] god put those guards around his word
[1:51:54] those guards are guarding the way of the
[1:51:57] tree of life
[1:51:59] they're guarding
[1:52:04] the law
[1:52:06] the word of god
[1:52:07] they're guarding the manna the hidden
[1:52:09] manna they're guarding
[1:52:12] they're guarding those things
[1:52:21] and for the believer
[1:52:24] if the word of god
[1:52:27] lies within your heart
[1:52:29] the spirit of god which is the word of
[1:52:32] god
[1:52:36] if that dwells within your heart you
[1:52:39] don't have to worry
[1:52:41] about keeping it
[1:52:46] he's
[1:52:47] got guards
[1:52:49] to guard that word
[1:52:52] say but my feelings
[1:52:55] yeah well
[1:52:56] our feelings have led us astray time at
[1:52:59] times
[1:53:00] but my intentions brother branham said
[1:53:02] the road to hell is paved with good
[1:53:05] intentions
[1:53:11] but his word
[1:53:13] heaven and earth will pass away but his
[1:53:15] word
[1:53:16] will never pass away
[1:53:18] if that word lies in your heart
[1:53:22] if that word is what you're lining your
[1:53:24] life up with and when i say that word so
[1:53:27] many times we get this image of the
[1:53:29] bible the bible you know the bible and
[1:53:31] it's true this this is the thoughts of
[1:53:34] god become words put on here but it's
[1:53:37] even the the the spirit of god the holy
[1:53:41] spirit of god that spoke that word
[1:53:45] when that
[1:53:47] is what dwells in your heart he's not
[1:53:50] leaving that unprotected
[1:53:52] for some man to come manhandle
[1:53:55] in your life he's got guards and if per
[1:53:59] chance
[1:54:00] some men would try
[1:54:02] to come and bring strange fire
[1:54:05] into their
[1:54:07] god has got something that you can go
[1:54:11] back to
[1:54:13] and say that's real fire
[1:54:16] that's god lit fire
[1:54:19] and not only do we have it here but
[1:54:21] when you go and put those tapes on
[1:54:24] and you say my
[1:54:26] that's nothing but the truth that lines
[1:54:29] up with the bible and that's what we've
[1:54:32] discovered
[1:54:34] we've discovered a message that lines up
[1:54:38] perfectly with this word
[1:54:42] that the life
[1:54:44] represented the same life it did the
[1:54:46] same thing that the that those apostles
[1:54:48] did when they received this precious
[1:54:50] word
[1:54:51] it did the same thing that those
[1:54:53] prophets did when they were walking this
[1:54:55] earth or any other believer who stayed
[1:54:58] true to god's word to god's plan to
[1:55:02] god's moving those that stayed true to
[1:55:05] that god had a word to protect that
[1:55:09] to bring them back to to say that's thus
[1:55:12] saith the lord that's thus saith the
[1:55:14] lord that is thus saith the lord and
[1:55:17] when when jesus was here as brother
[1:55:19] branham said he didn't have to say thus
[1:55:21] saith the lord he said but i say unto
[1:55:23] you
[1:55:24] because he was the lord
[1:55:26] today we've been pointed back to that
[1:55:29] with thus saith the lord that what jesus
[1:55:32] said is the same yesterday today and
[1:55:35] will be forever
[1:55:40] not only was it protected in the garden
[1:55:43] not only was it protected in the days of
[1:55:46] moses in the days of ezekiel in the days
[1:55:48] of jesus christ and in this day but we
[1:55:51] can see we can look forward and we can
[1:55:54] see that same word will also
[1:55:57] as we read this morning will also be the
[1:56:00] same word that washes the tribulation
[1:56:02] saints who have a testimony of moses
[1:56:05] that said lord your word was true and
[1:56:08] the messengers that you sent down
[1:56:10] through those ages their word was true
[1:56:12] and those people that believed you
[1:56:15] before
[1:56:17] before the tribulation hit those people
[1:56:20] believed you that this word was true and
[1:56:23] it is true and we're a witness that it's
[1:56:26] true
[1:56:29] we don't follow fables and cunning
[1:56:31] devices of men
[1:56:34] oh my
[1:56:38] it's the word of god it's the pure word
[1:56:40] of god and it will bring you through and
[1:56:42] it's
[1:56:43] it's a homeland security for you
[1:56:50] you say i found it i found my homeland
[1:56:58] it's this
[1:57:00] it's not just the word of god
[1:57:04] it's god himself
[1:57:09] and you can have so much security
[1:57:12] you can feel so secured in god
[1:57:15] the brother branham said it like this
[1:57:18] if god sent me to hell
[1:57:22] i'd still love him
[1:57:28] you got that kind of an experience
[1:57:32] yeah
[1:57:34] what i found
[1:57:36] in the word of god and what i've seen in
[1:57:38] the children of god
[1:57:42] is enough
[1:57:43] for me
[1:57:44] to say this is true
[1:57:49] i believe it
[1:57:51] and god i love you
[1:57:53] i love you lord
[1:57:57] i love your word
[1:57:59] god i love your moving i love
[1:58:01] i love when you come and you can speak
[1:58:03] to me in a song
[1:58:04] i love when you can speak to me
[1:58:07] in a conversation
[1:58:09] with a brother or sister over the phone
[1:58:13] over the kitchen counter
[1:58:16] god you're so real you're so true i love
[1:58:20] it when you can speak to me in the
[1:58:22] hospital
[1:58:24] i love it when you can speak to me god
[1:58:26] when i'm on my knees with my bills on
[1:58:28] the bed and the tears dropping from my
[1:58:30] eyes
[1:58:31] god when you can come and you can
[1:58:34] when you can
[1:58:36] give me comfort
[1:58:40] that the money doesn't give me
[1:58:46] that the medicine doesn't give me
[1:58:54] i love you god
[1:58:56] and lord
[1:58:59] i'm so
[1:59:00] secured by this word
[1:59:03] that lord
[1:59:05] whatever you would have for me whatever
[1:59:07] wherever you would send me i love you
[1:59:15] now that's some security right there
[1:59:19] that's eternal security
[1:59:26] we believe in eternal security of the
[1:59:28] soul
[1:59:31] not to disgrace but we believe in that
[1:59:33] as believers
[1:59:35] the eternal security
[1:59:38] amen let's stand together
[1:59:57] i just want to
[1:59:58] close in a word of prayer and
[2:00:01] our musicians could play softly
[2:00:08] with our heads bowed
[2:00:10] before god just looking to the dust from
[2:00:13] where we came from
[2:00:20] i would just
[2:00:24] [Music]
[2:00:26] i would just ask you
[2:00:28] in this time of turmoil in our
[2:00:31] country and in the world
[2:00:35] even this pandemic and it's a very real
[2:00:38] thing
[2:00:40] i don't make any light of it
[2:00:43] it's got this world shook
[2:00:49] and if if you're
[2:00:53] [Music]
[2:00:54] if you're looking to the news
[2:00:57] even if you have a direct line into
[2:00:59] [Music]
[2:01:01] the white house or
[2:01:03] some
[2:01:06] some great official building and you had
[2:01:08] direct contact with the leaders of our
[2:01:11] countries
[2:01:16] things like a virus
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:21] things like
[2:01:22] unrest in a man's heart
[2:01:26] prejudice or hatred toward
[2:01:29] another country
[2:01:31] fear
[2:01:32] perhaps of
[2:01:33] what they could do to us
[2:01:39] i can assure you you will not find rest
[2:01:43] in a diplomat
[2:01:48] you can't a diplomat can't take a virus
[2:01:51] away from you
[2:01:56] we've been so privileged to understand
[2:02:01] [Music]
[2:02:06] unseen realms
[2:02:08] demonic realms and how that
[2:02:10] demons are involved in sickness
[2:02:15] lord
[2:02:16] knows that
[2:02:19] we've been privileged we've we've been
[2:02:21] given insight into these things
[2:02:23] to understand these things that the
[2:02:25] world is
[2:02:26] they're shook about
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:30] and they just
[2:02:32] even though we may live in
[2:02:35] a first world country we say we're in
[2:02:38] the great u.s of a
[2:02:40] we've got the greatest military might
[2:02:43] but you know maybe we're starting to
[2:02:45] question that with
[2:02:46] maybe china or russia well we're not so
[2:02:50] sure
[2:02:51] where we're at as far as
[2:02:53] militarily or
[2:02:56] maybe even with
[2:02:57] what's going on within the decisions
[2:02:59] made within our own country and it
[2:03:01] begins to bring unrest in your heart
[2:03:04] begins to maybe even
[2:03:07] scratch at the
[2:03:09] fear
[2:03:14] and you start to wonder who is guarding
[2:03:16] us
[2:03:19] who will protect us
[2:03:21] [Music]
[2:03:23] it makes you wonder if not only am i not
[2:03:25] protected maybe i might even be sold
[2:03:28] into bondage
[2:03:30] and given over freely
[2:03:32] to harm's way
[2:03:36] you can only find unrest in those things
[2:03:39] and only find fear
[2:03:42] but church
[2:03:44] when we look into the word of god
[2:03:47] this is what we want to be concerned
[2:03:49] about it's the things of god
[2:03:53] what
[2:03:54] where are we
[2:03:56] what pertains to us as believers
[2:04:00] we're not just looking at the
[2:04:05] possible 90 years or so that we might
[2:04:08] live here
[2:04:09] we're looking beyond that
[2:04:11] we're looking from the very beginning of
[2:04:15] time
[2:04:16] down through all these ages
[2:04:19] through all these
[2:04:21] nations and governments that have
[2:04:24] and we can look down through time and
[2:04:26] we've been given
[2:04:29] [Music]
[2:04:31] we've been given insight through men of
[2:04:34] god who had
[2:04:35] the ability to look beyond the curtain
[2:04:38] of time
[2:04:39] to
[2:04:40] to see things pertaining not only to the
[2:04:43] past or the present but also the future
[2:04:47] [Music]
[2:04:51] church i
[2:04:52] i want you to
[2:04:54] feel protected i want you to know that
[2:04:57] god has got a guard
[2:04:59] around his word that will bring such
[2:05:02] security to you
[2:05:04] and such security to your heart and to
[2:05:07] your mind
[2:05:09] that even if your body falls apart if
[2:05:12] you're if
[2:05:15] if your economic life begins to
[2:05:18] deteriorate there is a sure
[2:05:22] rest
[2:05:23] in the word of god
[2:05:26] and if we can strengthen that if that
[2:05:29] could be strong in our heart
[2:05:31] then it won't matter so much what we
[2:05:34] come up against
[2:05:38] because we'll know how to overcome
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:44] and i want to give you
[2:05:46] comfort i want to exhort you the bible
[2:05:51] it tells us to exhort one another
[2:05:54] it says
[2:05:55] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[2:05:58] together as the manner of some is
[2:06:04] but exhort one another
[2:06:07] [Music]
[2:06:12] and the more
[2:06:14] so even as we see the day approaching
[2:06:16] that exhorting one another is
[2:06:18] encouraging one another
[2:06:21] and i want to encourage you church
[2:06:23] god has given us a word that is so alive
[2:06:26] today it's so true it's so working that
[2:06:30] it didn't stop at the garden it didn't
[2:06:33] stop at that gate
[2:06:35] didn't stop with moses it didn't stop
[2:06:37] with ezekiel it's still moving on
[2:06:40] [Music]
[2:06:42] and you can take security in it that it
[2:06:45] has stood the test of time
[2:06:49] that it has stood trials it has stood
[2:06:51] governments it has withstood all of the
[2:06:55] all of the things that the world could
[2:06:57] throw at it the word of god still stands
[2:07:00] sure
[2:07:05] and we need to encourage one another in
[2:07:07] the word of god
[2:07:09] when a situation comes up that looks so
[2:07:12] dire that looks so helpless
[2:07:15] not to immediately jump to a conclusion
[2:07:21] where it's the end this is the end
[2:07:24] and this is
[2:07:27] where we draw the worst of conclusions
[2:07:30] but that's when we need to draw strength
[2:07:32] from the word of god that's where we
[2:07:34] need to look inside and we need to say
[2:07:37] lord jesus if you did it once you'll do
[2:07:39] it again
[2:07:41] that god if you help my situation you
[2:07:43] can help my brother's situation you can
[2:07:46] help my sister's situation lord you can
[2:07:48] help this one who who doesn't know you
[2:07:51] yet god if if you'll just meet them
[2:07:54] their lives will be transformed and
[2:07:57] everything will be all right
[2:08:00] [Music]

[2:14:57] the effort
[2:15:02] i had a
[2:15:04] little different interpretation or
[2:15:07] revelation of the bag of candy
[2:15:11] i saw his daughter bring in the bag of
[2:15:13] candy and said well i didn't know i just
[2:15:14] saw the bag
[2:15:16] and when i came walking around there was
[2:15:17] an open
[2:15:18] bag of candy
[2:15:20] and i said well i know he's going to be
[2:15:23] pretty wired up
[2:15:25] because i thought he ate him
[2:15:27] open his teeth
[2:15:28] we were sitting at lunch and you know
[2:15:30] brother red you came in right ahead of
[2:15:32] me when that lady stopped us
[2:15:35] and she said
[2:15:36] are you pentecostals
[2:15:39] that's what she asked and brother reggie
[2:15:41] stopped and he said yeah
[2:15:43] the original ones
[2:15:45] and that caught her totally off guard
[2:15:49] but you know who had walked in first
[2:15:52] all the sisters
[2:15:54] and that caught her attention
[2:15:57] she goes you're the
[2:15:59] old-time pentecostals
[2:16:02] you're marked but it's a testimony
[2:16:05] and i appreciate that did you catch that
[2:16:08] yes
[2:16:08] she
[2:16:09] she saw them
[2:16:11] you and i might not have got that same
[2:16:13] attention that'd be gone first
[2:16:16] but she saw her sisters and she said hey
[2:16:18] you must be true pentecostals and i
[2:16:20] appreciate that so
[2:16:22] thank the lord for his word and
[2:16:24] he's mindful of and when you get afraid
[2:16:27] and you said i can't and when you say
[2:16:29] i'm not capable i know
[2:16:32] our f-16 private here
[2:16:35] uh you still do that
[2:16:37] yeah
[2:16:38] and
[2:16:40] some people are courageous enough to get
[2:16:42] in something like that and fly it around
[2:16:44] i like to look at them as they fly by
[2:16:47] but
[2:16:48] he's been taught
[2:16:50] he's been said and he knows what it can
[2:16:52] do
[2:16:53] what limits he can take it to
[2:16:56] it's got its its own protection it's
[2:16:58] army there's so much that the government
[2:17:00] and scientists have done
[2:17:02] to make it advanced to do it you know to
[2:17:04] compete in all
[2:17:08] but he's got to fly it
[2:17:10] it doesn't fly itself
[2:17:12] he's got to get in there he has to be
[2:17:13] trained
[2:17:15] now
[2:17:16] this god
[2:17:19] the advanced one the trained one the
[2:17:21] pilot one

[2:17:25] beginning lives in you it's not up to
[2:17:29] you you just say god i'll take you at
[2:17:32] your word

[2:17:38] taken off without him or no pilot he has
[2:17:40] to be in it
