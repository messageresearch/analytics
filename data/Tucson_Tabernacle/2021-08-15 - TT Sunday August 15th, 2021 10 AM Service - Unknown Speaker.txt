that we sing that it's written in the word and you are faithful you keep your word that is our hope that is our trust that is our expectation that you keep your word and you're the unfailing god and lord you said ask what you will and it shall be done so lord we come with that attitude that approach lord we're here to to hear from you to receive from you lord but not because we're worthy not because we deserve it but lord because you said if we would ask and we would leave we could have so we come with that attitude lord today we come believing lord you keep your word and we thank you for that in jesus christ's day amen thank you musicians god bless you may be seated for a few moments just a few a few things to inform you of and remind you and i know the number one question in a lot of people is where where are we at with brother matt and the church we had a meeting with him on this past friday phone conference and probably for half an hour to 45 minutes just going over things and a lot of questions with few answers let's just be honest about that spoke with the brothers and say how do we brother matt's words was you tell the congregation what i've said to you and uh oh four of us heard it four of us probably heard it a little different so i'll uh we spoke and i just said we'll just say it as best we can in the honest way brother matt told us there are things that have cleared up for them things that they had questions on and the lord has made them clear but there are still some things that they're asking about and he asked us to give him one more week the question was asked why don't we go elsewhere now the honest truth we don't have an elsewhere to go right now we haven't don't have a list or a line of brothers waiting and the few brothers that and let me just say it this way have come up and said i want to be your pastor generally those aren't the ones that you're looking for um i had this sitting in the office with brother green over the years and if if you were here at that time brother greene called us the pastors myself brother dale smith brother newton bennett brother caleb duran he called us the pastors all the time and um him being the senior pastor and it's a responsibility that until you've actually been there you realize how much how heavy it is but if god has called you to do it you can bear the burden and we we would look at at brother green and we would say big shoulders big big man could carry but i've seen some little pastors and did they do the same thing so it's not in the stature of the man but it's in god taking care of that so you know we were talking myself and the brothers we haven't gone out quote unquote looking for another brother right now but we also know that god is in charge and we must rest in that so brother matthew in speaking to us he asked us if we would give him about another week there is something personal that him and sister rachel are asking the lord to answer for them um but some things were made clearer some things we i we as he as he told it to us some of the in the words he used the clouds and sometimes it is there's just there's not a clear vision do i go this way do we go that way so um i would love to say we have all the answers we don't but there is one that knows exactly and he's the one that we should be talking to every day sometimes we talk to each other more than we talk to him but we should be talking to him every day so um i know that didn't answer a whole lot but i can't tell you a whole lot more because i don't know any more than that and it's not that we're we're not trying we are praying we are asking the lord um and every day but god is mindful i shared with you something the lord did for me a couple of weeks ago in that one house where the painter had the music on and it was playing over and over and it was music that goes way back as a younger man i remembered i never sang those songs i never listened to those songs and never had those those stations on but you remember them and when i left that that house after working in there for a couple hours i couldn't get one of those songs out of my head and i don't know if you've done it but there's one line of the song that you remember and it just goes over and over and over and you wish you could unplug that thing and it can't so as i was driving down the road i asked the lord how do i get rid of this in my mind and as soon as i said that that song he began and i said he began because it's it's the lord that does these things think about his love think about his goodness just begin to sing in my mind i told my wife this morning it has been different from that day this way because god did it i tried a lot of different ways i've shared with you the time that i unplugged his radio i cut his cord he fixed and started it back again and i finally asked the lord what can you do about this and he kind of said well why didn't you ask me a long time ago instead of trying to do this yourself i didn't ask for the young man to be fired but they fired him right after that and his radio went with him i didn't ask that but that's how god arranged it let's leave it in god's hands let's tell him lord we're going to pray we're going to ask we're going to trust in you or we're going to leave it in your hands so and i know that that it is a great concern for this church and it is for all of us but today there are things that other families are going having a hard time with right now the ramirez gaxiola family if you saw in the whatsapp are sister olga brother zion the youngest son was supposed to be coming into town today there's a decision on what would have to be done with our sister the doctors give her no hope she was part of this congregation part of the family for many years here brother if you saw the what's up brother edugal's son-in-law matt sanger lost his father yesterday now it's a loss in the flesh but if the father goes home to the lord there is a comfort in that and of course we know sister pruitt passing on and and the effect of that as a mother as a wife as a grandmother as a as part of a church for many years it's a hard time and then the rojas family it was part of our congregation for quite some time both the father and son were in the hospital at the same time with covid one at banner south which is the old keno and one is the old u of a hospital and the son i believe he was in his early 30s passed away several weeks ago and yesterday the day before dad rojas passed away so today they're making plans to bury the dad and the son and it's part of life if god doesn't come tomorrow somebody else will cross over but my expectation is lord if you don't come tomorrow and i go home tomorrow i'm just going to go be with you i'm trusting that everything is written but again sometimes we get caught up close to what's affecting us and forget that are others that are that are suffering and going through a hard time so let's remember those and in no way am i saying you're not having a hard time but sometimes we just have to stop for a minute and say lord you've been good to me but remember my brother remember my sister so sometimes it's oh it's it's all of us there's not one of us that's that hasn't gone through this you just you can't get past that that you're going through and as i was kneeling down praying as the service started in there i've i've come in some of the brothers leave the door open some close the door i walked in and one brother had his arms just walking back and forth worshiping the lord back there other brothers kneeling down one brother i thought he was asleep he was just deeply concentrating everybody said right now down to pray i began to thank the god for his mercy for listening to us for hearing us for for for being part of us and willing and it just just how he speaks to me what he does for me and and to each one as an individual you know how god deals with you i begin to think about him being able to be touched by the feeling of our infirmities by our feelings by our hurts by the things we're going through by our questions you know maybe the robert's family looking there with with sister sarah and if sister sarah could run up and take care of everything she would she's a mom but sometimes you can't and you go through these things and i just felt that the lord showed me he goes that's why i took on flesh or else i'd just be like a god of stone to you could not be touched by the filling of your infirmities i don't know maybe all of you have seen that before but it just spoke so much i took on flesh i robed myself in flesh i hurt i cried i suffered so that when you talk to me i would understand it became so real or else i would just be a god on a piece of stone that you were worshiping a picture a figure something but no i'm the lord god that healeth thee i'm the lord god that can be touched by your anxieties your worries your nervousness he knew those disciples going across on the boat after he had just fed five thousand he knew what they were going to go through but he had to get on the other side and he had to get spent some time talking to the lord himself and as he comes walking down over the over the water right over the water you would think peter and all them said that has to be the lord he's the only one that can do those things well what was their question is that you lord that would give you the impression that peter had seen a lot of people walking on the water didn't know for sure who it was huh no i think it was the first time peter ever saw somebody walk on the water yet he still questioned he still asked is that you lord and he said is it i i wonder sometimes if come on peter if you if you could have been there with the lord peter who else would it be you know but he says come peter and i'm glad that he does that for all of us every time and and maybe you today you're strong in faith tomorrow you have a hard time but god says come on brother eddie come on it's all right i just i just just understand the lord is with us he's not left us you know it's it's it's he said i'll be with you even in you i'm gonna take him at his word over what i'm thinking and what i'm feeling because my thoughts and my feelings will fail me but god's word never fails and that's our hope so and it's more than a hope it's an experience that you've had with god and he's faithful so you may be seated we'll read the first scripture there and then if i was going to say we'll continue from last sunday our hope our expectation our desire but i trust that we've had enough experiences with god that we know he fulfills we're not hoping he does but you have to have a hope you can't be a hopeless people you can't be in despair but hope becomes a reality in god it's more than just walking with a hope but there is a hope trying to find that right balance psalms 119 well three three verses of psalms 119. brother lyle i might have been a little bit like you were up to yesterday afternoon how's this gonna go i thought maybe i'll call brother lyles that you're preaching in the morning no i wouldn't do that i wouldn't do that but then god just if you just surrender yourself and yield yourself okay lord you do that so david said thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against see if if you know you can look at that literally have i hid in my heart you know we kind of say right here but it's it's it's also an attitude you take it's also an uh a a a spirit could i say it's the holy spirit that does that for you i've put it in there and i check what i'm doing against the word of god it's the checkpoint that i have it's that that says is that what god would want it does is it what the word of god says it is is it what we've been taught or is it just my feeling is it just something david went through a lot of things in life as a young man being told you are being anointed king over israel as a young man could you imagine let me let me find a young man here i have to go with brother eddie because i can remember his name what if i told you brother eddie the lord told me to tell you you're the pastor starting tomorrow that door would provide me wide open you'd be going out there but but put yourself in in in david's place he's not tending the sheep he's not even aware that samuel has come to his father's house the other brothers have samuel hass i mean jesse has they know when the prophet comes he's coming for a reason they prepare and he says the lord the salmon times the lord has sent me here to anoint your son as king over israel he has refused saul well of course the oldest son comes first and as they go down the line they started with peter too bad you don't have six or seven brothers you should go down the line until there was but one left and samuel knew god had told him go to jesse's house and anoint his son as king over israel so when jesse says that's all of them samuel says there's got to be another one god doesn't god doesn't make mistakes and then jesse goes yeah but he's my youngest and he's out tending the sheep really jesse is saying it can't be him and samuel says go bring him and he comes and samuel says this is the one it does not tell us immediately how david reacted but david it had to be quite a shock i'm sure me king he probably looked at his brother's he's more capable he's he's he's older than me he has more experience but david had a heart before god and that's what god was looking he told samuel he says you look at the outward you look at the outward appearance of man but i look down into the heart i look what to see what's motivating i look to see what's causing that to happen now sometimes we look at our heart and you say oh lord help me because i know some of the thoughts and some of the intentions that have gone through my heart gone through my mind i have to say lord let me get rid of that quickly you know brother brown when he says that brother green reminded us many times you can't keep the birds from flying over your head but you can keep them from making a nest because getting rid of the nest is the hardest part it's easier to let the thoughts go through as quick as they can say lord forgive me and help me to go on and david just says i have hid thy word in my heart and against that will i check every motive every spirit and every desire is this acceptable to you lord and then in verse 14 this is a scripture that caught my attention i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches and then maybe i have taken as much delight in the way of your unchanging word as in all wealth when you find something that doesn't fail it's consistent it works every time without fail then you can anchor right down on that but if sometimes dad says yes and dad says no the next time or as naomi got a good laugh today i'm wearing my tie and asking my wife where is it because this button was a little tight so she was trying to adjust it didn't realize the tie got pulled down and i'm saying okay now what did you do with my tie and she goes you're wearing it i looked down guess what i was wearing it mama told her and i walk into the kitchen and she is laughing over there things happen to us okay but he's the faithful one david says i have rejoiced in the way of thy test the keeping of your word the pro everything that is said about you is so true and faithful and i rejoice in that more than all that i have acquired he says and then verse 24 thy testimonies also are my delight and my counselors your unchanging word is my delight and the guide of my footsteps lord i need to go forward i need this what is your word what do you how would you lead me how would you direct me now i pray that if you're a faithful worker you don't get up in the morning and ask the lord if you should go to work today i think you already know that there are things that we know to do be kind to your neighbor love one another we should not be asking the lord do i need to love my neighbor today or it might excuse it those are givens but there's things in our lives that we get down we say lord i need some direction in life i need to know which way i need to go here and david said thy testimonies thy word thy unchanging word are also mighty light and the director of my footsteps so again just taking that and saying what is our expectation he tells us in his word what you can expect of him and he never fails so let's read the first there's just two quotes that i pulled up here i'd like to let's read those together and how many appreciate now being able to see and and i got up here and brother ed says can you stand over the pulpit before service and let's adjust the lights so it's not too bright and i was like wow i can see up here that's good and i appreciate all those things the simple things that that help us do we're where we might be working with a candlelight today or we might be working outside or i see some of the the uh pictures that our brother the elano brothers that sang for us here part of wmo the work they do in africa and other place and they're they're in in buildings that are just of mud and straw and they're but they're worshiping and loving the lord anyways but i appreciate that he allows us brother branham it just took the word expectation and he says and now last evening we were speaking on discipline in the church and i think if we could just get the church in a real spiritual attitude then there will be a revival really in it and it'll be so much better for our prayers for the sick as long as our conditions are slumping then we just don't seem to pick it up like we should but when everybody is just prayed up and keep high and a great expectation i've walked to the platform and many times be five six seven thousand people and not be one feeble person left just as soon as you walked out on the platform everyone gets up out of wheelchairs and cots and stretchers and everything walk right away because he says they just you're under such expectations now that was in the days of the early beginning of the ministry before there was anyone else in the field and it it had been kind of a letdown for a while so thou now everybody it it was new and the people were just expecting anything now watch what he says and now if you had the same expect expectations you'd get the same results god has not lessened there's not less of god today and and i've heard this and and there it's true we have the full word of god today but he's still the same yesterday today and forever when somebody and i've had people tell me brother i'm so in the word i don't need any of that i'm sorry i need all of god but through the unveiling of the word he just made it more real to me than it's ever been i am the lord god that healeth all thy diseases and i want to stand on that i want to believe on that i want to take that the next quote there's just two of them today dear heavenly father i am so grateful to know that there's still faith moving in the earth oh the great hour just now when we're expecting some great something to take place a believing people they believe because you've told them these things and you said to nathanael you shall see greater things than this grant it now lord may they be conscious that christ keeps every word in every promise may the holy spirit come powerfully upon this audience just now and that there would then and if there would be a shadow of doubt anywhere i think we could finish it let that be done with let it be cast away he didn't say that was only for that time and of course we know when brother branham first gets out in the field something had to draw the people to him something to say hey this is different just like when philip goes and meets nathanael nathanael says what's different nothing's good ever come out of there city let's just that's just kind of what he's thinking nothing good has ever come from there tell me what's different and philip says come see a man just come and find out for yourself you know we we we shared this testimony with when brother frank lopez they had the memorial here a friend of my father's i asked him after his when did he meet brother frank in 1953 they met back in california i asked my dad do you remember there in southern california when brother branham came through and he said yeah but they told us not to go because he was a false teacher so we didn't go brother tony ramirez i didn't know this he shared with me that he did go to under brother matt brown's meetings in in up in the fresno area somewhere up there in california but they got there late and it was so crowded they were way in the back and never really got to see him we just heard them from a long distance but brother frank's pastor told them let's go just don't listen to what he's got to say but he's a great healer there's great miracles let's go see what god does so brother frank told me or the they told me his testimony was he took his bible because he was going to go prove brother brahm wrong he was going to show brethren i'll show him where he's wrong in the scriptures i trust that we would have enough confidence that we could take the scriptures and say i'm going to show you by the scripture not by my opinion and if i'm seeing it wrong and i will approach that god will allow me to see it right he's not going to allow me to teach somebody wrong so brother branham made a statement and brother frank opened the bible and said well it says that in the bible brother brown said all things he opened the scripture it says that too but frank said when it was all said and done everything brother brahm said was in the scriptures didn't find anything that wasn't so they got together as a congregation or the with the pastor after he said what do you think so brother frank began to share with the pastor well everything he said is in here pastor got upset and threw him out of church dad said i didn't see him anymore he disappeared we moved to tucson brother franken come to tucson to follow this message because it was in the word of god and if you're a child of god the word of god draws you to him and if he's proven himself to be faithful unfailing then such a confidence can be built you can't always keep my word i can't always keep your word because we happen to be human we make a promise and something comes up we can't you know maybe you're feeling really good in the morning and in the evening you're not feeling well a situation comes up and you have to say sorry i can't make it but jesus never fails he keeps every one of his appointments now understand he keeps his appointments i don't set my appointments for him he sets them for me i don't dictate to what god is going to do i just get on my knees and say lord i need your help and let him come and he doesn't always come the way i think because if i'm looking at this and he's doing that i'm going to miss it but open my eyes lord i want to see jesus now the scriptures i'm going to go start with the old testament here and i i trust i i like i said i have my wife usually it's her i said i'm going to read you the scripture you verify that i got the right scripture that i didn't tran so i asked her i said does this have a continuity how are you hearing it you know she's the first one usually the one that gets to hear it first i don't know that she wants to but she does and i appreciate having a good wife that will sit there and do that and encourage brothers how many appreciate your wife how many honestly know that brother brother arnie has both hands and standing up is it to rachel but it is you know sometimes we get but god god has given us the one that we the one that we needed and i believe the one we desired to because when we ask god give us the desire my heart he does that and i know that and i asked her five times before she said yes and uh but she did say yes and every once in a while she said something says something to me i said but you said yes i thank the lord for for god giving us that which we have need of i appreciate that so jeremiah 33 these scriptures are all well-known scriptures and if you read your bible you should they should all be well known scriptures he says call unto me and i will answer thee immediately exactly what you want to hear right then and there no he didn't say that he just said i will answer thee and show the great and mighty things which thou knowest not and i appreciate that because he knows the end from the beginning everything in between and you're saying lord this is what i need and he says really you think so huh no i know what you need and i know how to get it there and we have to have that confidence one of my favorite scriptures jeremiah 29 11 for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord and if we stopped it right there some of us would say but look thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end and what is expected and what he promised what he said because you're his children you're part of him so you know david david could write these scriptures because god was influenced and david this is what it is you shall be like a tree planted by living waters you shall root you shall grow you shall give fruit in a timely season that was god's thoughts an expected end it's not going to fail isaiah 45 verses 5 and 6. just want to establish this something that should be well established but let's maybe anchor it down a little more i am the lord and there is none else we've got to be careful because we put other things in the way but god said he realized that we do that but they're nothing to him he's not having to stop saying oh no i got to deal with that guy boy he was a battle last time no he says there is none else there is no god beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me while i did not even realize it was god he was already working it's not like he had to modify a plan or make up a difference or write another chapter for me it was already there you have to see yourself in god's plan if you were the only one he would still come and give his life to redeem you that they may know from the rising of the sun in the morning when i rise and from the west and then you know rise themselves the east but it just made me think in the morning when it rise mary realized i understand right off that your god and from the west and there is none beside me i am the lord and there is none else and period it's done there's no question in his mind there's nobody like me even the stone that you took or the goal that you took or the wood or whatever you did to build that god i made it you didn't create that it was created by me there is no other god but me and he's the only one that can say that now there's nobody else but me because i'm the only he may like this and all of you can say thank god that's a little different but he has his reasons why but him the unfailing god the unchanging god not having to adjust to different seasons not having to adjust to different moods i wasn't expecting that i wasn't prepared for that now my trip has to no god has a way israel comes he says in 400 years you shall sojourn down there in the land of egypt 400 years and then he says moses go down because i keep my word and they're rejoicing not only that but egypt gives them all the gold everything they need they brother lyle you know when you when you were getting ready to move to this new place did your neighbor come over and give you everything before you left no in fact maybe the neighbor came or you're leaving that i'll take it it might be the other way around but egypt gives israel all their wealth that's the god you serve he can take one and make a million out of it when we take a million and make one out of it we're not careful but he's god there is none else he says deuteronomy the book of two laws the law of death and the law of life and here god says hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might that doesn't leave room for much else to sir and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart let it be first let it be uh above everything else no there are other things that in life i'm not questioning that but all that should come underneath uh under that hear o israel oh thou spiritual seed of israel hear o israel the lord thy god is one god one lord and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sitteth in thine house and when they'll walk is by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and if you go look at the new translation thou shalt teach them and talk about them when you're in church he says all the time daily continue should be the meditation of your heart and i know troubles come and i know thoughts happen and things happen and we're all guilty brother bradman was as quick as you can make it right get a hold of yourself make it he said you should do this and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand there shall be as a frontlets between thine eyes and thou shall write them upon the post of thy house and on thy gates and i was reading this to my wife or just making sure these are the scriptures that that i had put down and i remembered in in high school back in california i took a world religions class because i thought that was going to be a class that was going to teach me about what the baptists believed and well world religions if you read the title pay attention you realize it wasn't going to be that but that's what i thought and i wanted to know what the lutherans believed in the baptist no this was talking about world religions but they had two young men they were twins i remember one of them was steve i can't remember the other name and they brought the things the the frontlet and the things and they demonstrated to us i had never seen that before how they literally would tie them and put them and and that but that's not what he's talking about right here for us to literally do that it should be in our hearts he says and thou sh then and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house on thy gates remembering when brother branham when when he any the lord stops the airplane in tennessee and puts down and says get up and walk when he's in the hotels to start walking brother branham prophet of god following the leadership of the lord and knew when god was talking to him is still questioning god while he's walking but my plane but my plane but my airplane lord but he was doing what god told him let's just be honest let's be honest about ourselves i'm doing what god told me to do but sometimes i'm still questioning i happen to be a little bit human still a lot sometimes too much but he's walking down there and there's a sister standing by and he's going to walk right past because god hasn't said anything to him you're going to this address this person he didn't describe he just said walk brother branham was obedient enough and understood at this time that that's what he had to do so he begins to walk and this sister whenever god told her um because she asked him where is your elijah god said oh he's right down the street i'll send him your way strange how elijah happened to be there like god whoa boy that worked out perfect man i'm glad i planned that no that's how god works okay puts a plane down for whatever reason the plane had to go down delayed it for whatever reason it was maybe something minor they just couldn't find it i don't know why the plane stopped i know why the plane stopped but i don't know what he caused in the plane to stop let me say it that way because there was a sister down there that needed elijah to come by and god will stop everything for you if you can believe it you should believe it for yourself you should have come enough experience in your life that you know god will stop to come and meet you he does it so she's out there whatever time it was she put herself at that front gate and said he's coming i'll wait for him here brother branham just says morning auntie and she says morning parson and that catches his attention and he turns he goes how'd you know i was a parson god told me you were coming could you imagine being a prophet and a sister says the lord told me you were coming already i'm the prophet i'm the man sister you have no he said oh my this is god working immediately he realized god is working if we could just be sensitive hey god this is you let me let me pay attention he walks into her house and he says oh you could tell she was a christian in her home god bless our home thou shalt write them upon the post of the house in thy case that's what god showed me right there there should be a physical evidence around you that you love the lord there should be things that people would say hey you're a christian aren't you you sisters especially you sisters the way you dress the way you come the way you act and it shouldn't be something honestly it shouldn't be something you say well i have to it should be the desire of our hearts you know there's things that brothers could do too sometimes you'll see the and it's maybe it's to the shame of the parents i don't know i didn't have any boys so i can't tell you but some of the boys don't look any different than the world sometimes yet they come to church there should be something about us that is different there should be i'm not saying you have to be so weird so different i'm just saying let christ shine here let him tell you what's good what he appreciates you know be like david and stan before and they said let me tell you let us four eat this meal and see if in 10 days there's not a difference the the the only thing that i've seen in in the barber shops is the young men that come in and they get all these haircuts and i'm going to be 62. i don't want a haircut like that but these young men they want to look they want to look you know this one getting it this way and this one doing that and these three years old four-year-old dad there and they're shaping their hair and everything so they can look like somebody else that has a hair like that and my heart says make me more like you rather than i want to be like that lord let our hearts desire be that someone say now that's a christian i'd rather suffer persecution for that a life lived and satan hates it and he'll have him come after you then because i can't control my mouth because i bring that upon myself but a life lived satan hates he walks sorry he he approaches god there the bible tells us he comes and and say god asked him where have you been oh walk into it from and he says have you considered my servant job and satan goes well of course you got him so protected you don't even let me near his house give me a chance and i'll get him to turn his back on you god says okay go because job was perfect the bible says i'll tell you why job was perfect because the scripture says he laid a sacrifice every morning and god said i look at the sacrifice therefore job is perfect let let your life be a sacrificial life before god lord i'm willing to give up i'm willing to let this go i'm willing to turn my back on that and let you be magnified let that be written on the post of thy house and on thy gates psalms 62. did we finish that i'm sorry we did that tenant let's go back where i missed two scriptures there 10 and 11 and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he swear unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou build us not and houses full of good things which shall fill us not and wells digged which thou s dignant vineyards and olive trees which thou plan is not when thou shalt have eaten and be full every need supplied they're all god's in the first place he says you're going to go into a land and these people think they've taken this land and they said but they're doing it for you you ever looked at it this way god allowed those people and they dig the wealthy because my children are going to come in and it's going to be theirs it all belonged to them in the first place god has a way of meeting needs and he doesn't have to meet him the way i think he should do i want him to do them the way he knows it's best it's it's it's nice to work and out of the of the the fruit of thine own labor but it's also nice to come and god has already had it already i appreciate that psalm 62 5-7 my soul wipe thou only upon god for my expectation is from him i didn't put god and say god you have to do this he said i will do this and if i think by telling him i'm going to and for him no he's way ahead of that already he's already made provision you're going to go into a land and all this is already going to be there you're not even going to have to dig you're not even going to have to plant it's going to be there already he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved the god in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god that is david david had learned now understand in god do i have everything i have need of not just because i'm king today i have it all he's he spent half of his life running while he was a king hiding but god he was still king you're still a child of god you were a child of god in god's mind you didn't know until later in life but you were always a child of god and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god now let's go over to the new testament and read some scriptures here matthew again god just puts it straight out heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away they'll not come to an end they'll not fail they'll not be forgotten they will be doing as the sun rises every morning he said when the sun neither will i forget my promises now he gave us things that we could see we could understand maybe maybe some folks would have a greater understanding on on the atmosphere than i would have i just know that there's air to breathe and i breathe it every day but i can't tell you how it works doctors and scientists could have a great explanation but they breathe the same way i do they still have to where's that right those are some of the things that i know brother lyle has shared that they got to do but they still had to grab it do it with their hands they still had to see it with these eyes that you know god is in charge of all of this heavens and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away and then matthew 11 25 and 26 and i just i like this and at that time the disciples asked him why do you show these things in mysteries and then he goes look and he's talking to them and he shares these things and at that time jesus answered and said i thank the o father lord of heaven and earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed unto them them unto babes and why even so father for it seemed good in thy sight it's what god chose to do you know if god came down and interviewed each one of us today you know sat right here and said brother lyle how would you like it down sister heather out brother robert and he would go down the line his book would be about this thick with each one of our ideas how we think it should be done but he says even so father because it seemed good in thy sight and he's eternal he's pure what he said the first time brother branham teaches this so strongly how he did it the first time he's faithful to continue because he did it perfect the first time i'd love to say that every invention every time they did it there was no testing no it just hit it on no why do you think that they put no lawsuits against certain vaccines and all because they know there's a lot of testing and trying and guessing and hoping but in god it was perfect the first time matthew 13 10 and 11. and this is the disciples came and said unto him why speak us thou unto them in parables he says why why do you show it this way why do you kind of make a story a drawing and then yes this and the answer to them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given god had a let's just be honest god had a people go ahead of thought there were people that god said they're going to be part of it they're going to receive it they're my children it's given to them i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of god i we just sent out my wife and rachel i believe did the ancestry thing and they just sent out mine because they really want to know about dad i hope i hope it's not that disappointing but you know they're going to look and say you know your percentage of that there's a part of this there's a little bit of this in you there's a little bit of this and that but i did a checkup the other day and i used this dna testing right here and said i'm his did you find your name in here have you found your name in here then you go back to god you always were you always will be and his dna is pure it's not affected by anything else you have to believe that you have to stand on that i don't know what mine's going to say i know listening to the girls we're all kind of guessing there's a good chance i'm going to have indian in me there's such a good stuff i'm probably going to have some from europe because the spaniards came across with the indians and that's where the mexican came from basically so there's that possibility one of my daughters wanted french she says there has to be french in me well i don't know she didn't do the dna yet did she so she doesn't know yet that's okay i just want to be sure of this dna above all that my lineage throws back to him the unfailing one the eternal one i i think sometimes what might be in there and good lord help us i don't know if being bad is found in there but they might find mine some of the things we do like looking for our tie that we're wearing you know oh my so again he tells us we were just reading matthew 13 10 11 because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of him but to them it's not given i appreciate that god is so mindful of us that he opens these doors and says look i know you've got a question here's the answer this is how it goes this is and there's just a peace that comes when god settles in your heart romans 8 18 and 19 paul is saying this for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall reveal be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god i i just it it's it's for another way to say for the anxious looking out an anxious a desire a drive the trees the plants the the atmosphere used to be pure no sin involved no nothing it was natural it was healthy look what has happened here in the last month with all the rain that has hit southern arizona doesn't even look much like a desert in some places brother branham made it made a comment he said when the water gets to it those those cactus thorns will turn into blooms watch what begins to happen when the things that should be happening are there there's a change about it the the wolf and it shall lay with the lamb and the bear you know because that was in the beginning but it's changed but they're waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god that's me and you wait until we come into that place and i'm under that expectation that soon and very soon i was talking to a brother the other day and i asked him a question and he said brother aaron i think it's so close i think it's very close i just can't see uh that being i'm talking close i'm not talking about two years from i'm talking close we'll be going home it's just falling apart so fast it's just things are happening so quick you know and my answer to him was lift up your head your redemption draweth nigh and he says oh i hope you're being so prophetic it's going to be tomorrow let that be our expectation let that be our desire lord that it would be now but until then my heart will go on singing but until then with joy i'll carry on this world is not my home i'm just a passing through but while i'm in passing through here let me be a christian let me be a light let me be example let there be enough that i would want to reach out to one more say come go with me the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestations of the sons of god i think brother branham said many times we should be further along down the road but god knows why second corinthians 4 7. but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that's you and me you have this treasure in your vessel that the excellency of the power of may be of god and not of us because no one in their earth and vessel has been able to produce this you have a mother teresa and thank god for people like them who've done all they could to help i'm surely not opposed anybody doing some good to help somebody but when you do that good thinking you're going to merit heaven you've missed the reason why you do that good because the good god lives in you and you're sharing him see we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us he said we have the wealth of vessels in the vessels of earth so that it may be seen that the power comes from god not from us but from god you're too human to be able to do that they're going to say no it's the god that lives in me ephesians chapter 3 or verses 9 to 12. and to make all men see what is a fellowship of the mystery paul is speaking the unveiling of god in this day what used to be the law if you go back and see where ephesians what used to be all the law and all the way that god brought it but he said today god has unveiled this mystery and the fellowship we have in this unveiling of god he says which from the beginning of the world has been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ he's explaining in the unveiling jesus christ becomes here and begins to unveil god before us it's god walking in flesh it's god he said i and my father are one brother peter spoke um here wednesday night the true place of worship god's chosen place of worship and if you read it over time as brother brahms speaking on those things and you get there to the end and he begins to put it out plainly there is only one place it's not varied you can't have a little bit there a little bit it is or it isn't well god accepts because it had to come through the sacrifice and until he said this is my son in who i am well please until he said it is accepted and then you and i can come in through that if you go read that one in 65 he said if you're coming in any other name your worship is not being accepted to god and i don't know if you've done this but i have i've gone on youtube and looked at what people call worship today and i have a cousin her mother is my mom's sister and her dad is my father's brother and she's quite a little preacher oh they won't use the word as a preacher they'll go all the way around it but she's preaching the services but because she says she's not a preacher i guess it makes it right and i watch them and i listen because sometimes they'll say it was really good listen to this and i can last about five minutes of it and i can't take it anymore it and just to watch what they call worship what they call giving god honor and glory it's not there it's it's it's exalting themselves it's in one moment they're they're talking about jesus in the next moment they're lifting up what they're doing they're talking about how the bishop of the church is here and one of the brothers they believe in speaking tongues is the evidence of the holy ghost so the bishop got up and for the next 10 minutes 15 minutes he had them stammering and stammering just trying to get him to speak speak in tongues that's not god that's another man another church's way of worship not acceptable unto god because it's not coming through the proper way there is a way to approach god an accepted way and he says it's been unveiled it's been the veil was rent into from top to bottom they tried to sow it back up to keep him bound in that religion but god said no the way has been made to the intent that now unto the unto the principalities and power in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god how god chose to do it it's perfect according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him not in my works not in my abilities i should kneel down and pray but if i think god owes me an answer because i knelt down to pray i'm missing it god i'm going to pray for 30 days and you better have an answer for me on the end of that day that's not how we lord i'm going to get on my my knees and kneel down before you and i'm going to ask you lord be merciful to me and i'll wait on you i'll worship you i'll praise you i'll give you honor i'll give you glory obama wait on your answer now what it what did what do you tell daniel god heard your prayer god heard your prayer from day one but i was withstood he said because there satan's doing everything he can to make sure god that answer does it from god doesn't get to you but it's going to get to you because god's going to get it there and he has his reasons why and then we go to colossians wherever i am made a minister paul says according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you it was not for paul it was for us to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hid from ages and generations but now is made manifest to a saints at a time you know it was not but god said in this day i'm going to open it up to whom god would make known what is the riches of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory not christ and the prophet not christ in the preacher not christ just in this church or this group or this tangent christ in you so that wherever you are god is you ever realize that christ in you brother matt god is there he said oh got to be careful no understand god goes with you it's christ in you the hope of glory how do i know because his word says so and his word never fails and as you begin to surrender and yield and let god you begin to see it's him he manifests himself through his word and he brings things to pass god's word says so so therefore it happens brother branham says i'm just waiting on him i'm helpless without him although brother branham had done it thousands of times already you would have thought okay i know how to work this now no he would take the word of god and he would minister the word god and then he would wait on the angel of the lord to come but once the angel of the lord was there he says okay he's here now and everything now was under my control who was speaking in brother brahm the man no the the one that realized that's god he's the same yesterday today and forever you stand over a situation he said i'll be with you even in you and you can stand and say i take everything under my control why because he's there with you that's not you speaking that's god saying i'm in charge here i've got in my hand brother that was for the prophet only don't let satan get to that he's done that for so long that was for brother and money that was for the brother green only that was for that brother because he's good and you're being robbed of your blessings it's christ in you the hope of glory you better put your or in there maybe maybe write it right there right under there so when you read it it'll remind you it's christ and eddie the hope of glory it's christ in amanda the hope of glory it's each one of us is this it's it's when you get god you get everything he's all in all he's there's no limit to him there's there there's no resources that he can't tap into there is in the first i own the cattle in a thousand hills he said so what what could you say well he's not capable of doing in first peter 1 3 and 4 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead take a couple of minutes right now and think a bit about had you been there and watched him die and you had been one of those that had walked with him three and a half years and watched from day one when he called you by name told you who you were unveiled the secrets of your heart and began to land you had to realize this is god and you watch things like feeding five thousand with three loaves of bread and two fish telling peter go over and take the gold out of the mouth of that fish and go pay the taxes take another one of it says rise up daughter and life is given back call out lazarus come forth and he did you you got to the point where what is impossible for god nothing but peter realized i said by his resurrection from the dead we have this hope not just the scene and the watching of the three and a half years but because he resurrected from the dead it makes it all real and true because had he not that it would have said he's just another man that god used there are many that would go now they still do on easter and wait there at the temple or the the tomb of brother branham where he's buried and they wait for his resurrection there talked to different folks who said they were there they seen it people come waiting for brother branham to resurrect he's coming up in the general resurrection of all the saints but the one that needed to resurrect already did he's the one and that's what peter says here to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you because he lives i can face tomorrow i'm not a fear afraid of there's no fear in it peter says of all the people peter the one who denied him the one who said i'll go with you let me come across and he he's he was uh boisterous enough bold enough to say those things maybe some of the other ones wanted to but they didn't but peter did let me come up if that's you lord let me walk on the water and the lord says come on peter do you think the lord didn't know what peter was going to do of course he knew but he still invited him he didn't say no peter don't you dare you're gonna drown okay now understand peter you know you're gonna deny me three times no way lord there is no i've seen too much of you i've had too many experiences with there is no way i'm going to deny you peter's saying he said you're going to hear that rooster crow after he denied me the third time and it says peter's heart just broke apart when that rooster crowed peter says let's go back to fishing as one brother said they went back to fishing and couldn't even remember how to fish god had to tell them where the fish were you ever thought about that i thought that was interesting peter had done it all his life but they're fishing they can't catch anything god said cast it on the other side peter you still need me peter no matter what i'm so glad that he reached down his hand for me and then to finish in ephesians the musicians want to make their way up brother matt why don't you go ahead and play the organ you know i'll finish here ephesians now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us it's christ in you the hope of glory to do above and beyond anything you could ima ask of him and he says unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus through all ages world without end and he said amen so beat that settles it god's word never fails open my eyes lord i want to see jesus you love him has he been faithful to you even when he didn't answer it the way you think he should have answered him he knows best are you willing to say father you know best you have the answer i cried and i asked the lord and it all it seemed like he said was no and then i got on this side looked back and said oh thank you lord for saying no what i thought was for my good would have been a problem thank you for bringing this answer today because then i wouldn't have been ready for it god knows exactly what and why open my eyes i want to see jesus [Music] open [Music] eyes lord help us [Music] i want to see jesus [Music] we've opened our eyes to many things and so many times we've been disappointed not because not necessarily because it was a bad image maybe it just wasn't the time but you have everything under your control lord if we take you first and put you first in the situation and that you have your way lord we would find a peace there that passes our own understanding lord i know many times in my own life i've tried to say if i do this this and this this is a result i'll get and it didn't work out that way [Music] help us all lord to understand that to put our confidence and our trust in you even more so as we see the day approaching we're waiting for that expected end that you spoke through in jeremiah for you know the thoughts i know the thoughts that i have towards you i know how i'm going to accomplish this i know how i'm going to do it therefore rest in me wait upon me you tell us lord it's our hope it's our desire lord many many have crossed over now there are many witnesses on the other side if they could tell us today they would tell us to continue to to be under that expectation to god is not going to disappoint us lord we're just trusting in that today lord thank you for your word we appreciate it in jesus christ amen open our eyes we want to see jesus [Music] to reach out and touch say that we love him open our ears help us [Music] open our eyes [Music] i'm going to live the way he wants me to live to make that promise lord i'm gonna i'm gonna do all i can to live the way you want me to live [Music] not to satisfy myself but to bring honor to your lord i'm going to live the way he wants me to be i'm going to give until there's just no more to give i'm going to [Music] just i could never [Music] i'm going to live the way he wants me to get [Music] till there's just [Music] and make me like jesus [Music] that's filled with [Music] me [Music] jesus make me give me [Music] and make me [Music] thank you god bless you this morning may your faith your hope rest completely on him you know there's there's something about having somebody have confidence and somebody you can go to i know that after brother green's passing and things we began to go through some good friends brothers that we got to know brother ray erickson brother jim ed dalton brother robert figaro brothers that had more experience than myself in this that said hey brother aaron if we can help you we'll help you and it was good it was good to be able to share something or pass something along what would you do in this situation have you dealt with this before and sometimes they left and they weren't laughing at me they were just laughing because they realized brother ray asked me one day so so what does a pastor need to know what does what is it oh i said he understands everything he has an answer for it all he can solve everybody's problems he never gets frustrated he's on top of it all and brother ray started laughing i said i know you're laughing i know why you're laughing because i know what i'm saying is but that's just what i think i should be able to do to help the people but it's god that helps the people what we each one of us have to do is yield and surrender father of the home mother of the home say lord help me with my children teenagers young people saying lord help me as part of the family god knows he went through all of it believe it or not he was a teenager that's how he can understand because he went through it yeah i was a teenager a long time ago and i realized it was different in my life than what someone go through but we went through it but he went through it purposely so that when you and i talk to him he says i understand. this is how we go through and i appreciate the god of mercy and the god of grace for all of us lord we thank you for today's word and we appreciate it lord how you're mindful of us and how you don't get tired of us lord sometimes we would think well i just wouldn't put up with that anymore but you love us lord you care for us you take us back through some of the same lessons again so we will learn them so we could hear on that day well done though good and faithful servant enter that one of the joys of the lord [Music] thank you lord for being so mindful of
