[15:08] things. And Lord,
[15:11] you blessed us by lowering yourself down
[15:14] to becoming a man here on earth to
[15:16] become our savior, a kinsman redeemer.
[15:19] Lord, we are grateful.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And pray that you would
[15:23] be, Father, with us in this service this
[15:27] morning. I already feel Lord that that
[15:30] you're here.
[15:32] Lord, I pray that
[15:35] we would leave this morning as [music]
[15:38] the disciples did on their road to Emmas
[15:40] and say, "Didn't not our hearts burn
[15:43] with us within us as he talked with us."
[15:45] By the way,
[15:46] bless our service, Father. We pray in
[15:49] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can be
[15:52] seated. God bless you.
[15:59] First,
[16:01] I'll mention a few of the ones that um
[16:03] in a little bit I'll mention a few of
[16:05] the ones that aren't with us this
[16:06] morning. Uh because of some of the
[16:09] prayer requests we talked about earlier.

[17:31] visitors, friend. [applause]
[17:37] Benjamin, my friend, good to see you.
[17:40] God bless you. I um
[17:43] appreciate I appreciate our visitors. I
[17:46] appreciate our congregation, all that we
[17:48] stand for. We have a joyous
[17:52] um
[17:54] dedication this morning. We get to
[17:56] dedicate a new little baby. We've done
[17:59] quite a few over the past few years and
[18:01] really looking forward to this uh
[18:04] dedicating Josiah and Katie's new little
[18:06] boy, Baniah. Before um brother Mark Ao,
[18:11] he uh would like to give a blessing to
[18:14] the child and and take it back to the
[18:16] word. So, brother Mark, if you would
[18:18] come up.
[18:22] There you go.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you, Tucson
[18:26] Tabernacle.
[18:27] Such a privilege to be here. And it's my
[18:30] uh my first grandson.
[18:32] Um my father was a minister. He passed
[18:36] away last year. He would have loved to
[18:37] have been here. Um but I'm wearing one
[18:39] of his ties in honor of that. So, he
[18:42] would preach in this tie sometimes.
[18:44] So, uh, and then I'm in the ministry and
[18:47] then my son Josiah, you know, so we've
[18:50] got a lineage going here and, uh, I
[18:52] looked up the name that his parents
[18:54] chose, Baniah. And what do you know that
[18:58] the father and the grandfather are also
[19:00] mentioned in the context with that boy
[19:04] Baniah, who is one of David's mighty
[19:06] men. And it calls the grandfather a
[19:08] mighty man. So, that's a good start
[19:10] right there.
[19:11] That goes for brother Joe, too.
[19:15] So names have meaning. So I had to of
[19:17] course look up what the name means. And
[19:20] I'm sure there'll be some more talk
[19:21] about that. But these mighty men uh were
[19:25] warriors and they were like the special
[19:28] forces in David's time in David's
[19:30] kingdom. The best of the best. But
[19:33] before they ever got to that, they had
[19:37] to do something even more special. They
[19:40] had to go against the majority and
[19:43] switch sides from the majority, which
[19:46] was the kingdom and the administration
[19:48] of Saul, and follow this renegade David
[19:52] out there in the wilderness who could
[19:54] offer them nothing. No material rewards,
[19:56] didn't have a kingdom, didn't even
[19:58] really have a home, but he had the
[20:00] anointing that he would one day be king.
[20:03] So one outstanding trait that Banayiah
[20:07] in the Bible had is he was an early
[20:09] adopter. He was one of the first ones to
[20:12] get out there and be on David's side and
[20:15] leave everything and follow that. So
[20:18] that's something rare.
[20:20] But he as things go on, we find out that
[20:24] it's the same uh God, but the anointing
[20:28] changes a little bit. And the people of
[20:30] God can get a little bit confused as the
[20:32] anointing changes even though it's all
[20:34] God.
[20:36] And this type of person is a minority in
[20:40] the in the aspect that they can also
[20:43] change the anointings within the
[20:45] anointing. So that's a very uh more
[20:49] refined kind of discernment.
[20:52] And as the more I read about this story
[20:55] of what Baniah actually did and all the
[20:58] little hiccups that even the people of
[21:00] God stumble over, he went through all of
[21:03] them.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Amazing. So he made the corner. We even
[21:07] see that in sometimes in the New
[21:09] Testament when you think about the fact
[21:11] that John the Baptist had disciples, a
[21:13] lot of them, but only a couple of them
[21:16] followed Jesus. They continued following
[21:19] John. And they even questioned some of
[21:21] the ways that why don't they behave the
[21:24] way John's disciples behave the same
[21:26] anointing on John and on Jesus but the
[21:29] practice changes a little bit as time
[21:31] goes on.
[21:33] So following God, the early adopters.
[21:35] Well, Banayiah was one of those. He was
[21:38] the son of a priest. Jehoeda, this is a
[21:42] pretty powerful name stacking up here.
[21:45] Son of a priest, a mighty man, quick to
[21:47] follow David. Caught the anointing very
[21:50] quickly. But when David got old, the
[21:53] anointing was going to change again. And
[21:56] it was going to go to Solomon. And it
[21:58] was another time of confusion. All
[22:01] around the country of Israel, there was
[22:03] confusion. Who's going to be the next
[22:05] king? And the majority went after
[22:08] another son,
[22:10] Adonijah.
[22:12] They had the big crowd with them. And of
[22:16] all of David's mighty men, the only one
[22:19] that's mentioned that made the corner
[22:21] from David to Solomon was Baniah. Amen.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing?
[22:29] &gt;&gt; And they were all mighty men. They
[22:31] earned their stripes. They bore the
[22:34] reproach. They were the old fighters.
[22:36] They were with David through thick and
[22:38] thin. But when the anointing changed a
[22:40] little bit, it's a minority within a
[22:45] minority that can make that second
[22:48] corner. This little youngster Solomon
[22:50] that didn't look like that's the way the
[22:52] anointing would go. But it was only the
[22:55] prophet Zadok
[22:57] or the priest Zadok, the prophet uh
[23:01] Nathan and the mighty man Baniah
[23:04] that made it to the kingdom of Solomon
[23:08] and became the general
[23:10] of the army with no battles to fight
[23:15] because it went from the time of war to
[23:18] the time of peace. So he had to actually
[23:21] switch his whole everything he was
[23:23] trained to do to now function in a
[23:26] kingdom of peace. So I was just amazed
[23:29] when I saw all this. That's you know if
[23:33] you're going to pray for a child
[23:35] to be have that kind of gift on it on
[23:38] his life only God can give that
[23:42] raise a person through all that. And so
[23:43] he makes a a wonderful uh person to take
[23:46] into life your name Banaya. Let's look
[23:50] in the scripture and see what that name
[23:52] means. I thank the congregation. I thank
[23:55] all the family and everyone who has
[23:57] supported and been with our family and
[24:00] Josiah and my son William who sang here
[24:02] today. We've got a lot of family today
[24:04] here and my wife and now the newest
[24:07] member we're going to dedicate, my
[24:09] grandson. God bless you, Baniah. This is
[24:12] a blessing on your life.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[24:23] Can I keep you up on the platform?
[24:25] Brother Joe, would I get you to come up
[24:27] to and let's let's dedicate this little
[24:29] guy. Um Josiah and Katie, I um
[24:34] I'm due to be a grandpa any day now. And
[24:37] the thing that I've been most worried
[24:39] about is I don't know if it's gonna be
[24:40] as cute as that.
[24:43] I feel so inadequate. It's such a
[24:46] beautiful little baby.
[24:49] Come on up here so that everybody can
[24:52] see us.
[24:56] Katie, congratulations. Bless you.
[25:00] Thank you.
[25:03] This is little Banayiah David. Am I
[25:06] right? By David,
[25:09] bring him here to dedicate him and give
[25:13] him back to the one that gave him. I'm
[25:16] going to hold you tight.
[25:18] I know how to do it.
[25:21] Little Joe, Mark, lay your hands on the
[25:24] baby, please.
[25:27] Lord God,
[25:29] what a wonderful day that we have that
[25:31] we can dedicate a new life to you.
[25:34] Father, this little boy, we don't know
[25:37] what you have in store for him, but but
[25:39] Lord, we pray for great things upon his
[25:42] life.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, may he live like Baniah of old
[25:46] lived. Father, may he be fearless,
[25:48] whether it be in the face of a lion or
[25:51] in the face of a Philistine or Lord,
[25:53] today in the face of sin standing for
[25:55] you. May he be strong
[25:58] &gt;&gt; as his name's sake. We pray. May he
[26:00] stand as Baniah stood for David. Lord,
[26:03] may he stand for the king of this day,
[26:05] our king, our lord Jesus Christ.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; May he stand, Lord. And I pray your
[26:13] blessings upon his life and upon the
[26:15] life of his parents
[26:16] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Jesus name.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:22] [applause]
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.
[26:34] Little guy's like everybody else. When I
[26:36] start to get long-winded, he starts to
[26:38] complain.
[26:41] [laughter]
[26:44] What a what a blessing. What a blessing
[26:46] that we have to we can dedicate
[26:50] a little guy
[26:52] back to the Lord and then we look
[26:55] forward to seeing and grow up if the
[26:56] Lord would terry and and be a real
[26:58] servant to God
[27:01] and dedicating this baby.
[27:04] And this past week,
[27:06] I've seen the importance of a church,
[27:10] just a local body. We talk a lot about
[27:13] the bride of Christ and and we talk a
[27:16] lot about the second coming and these
[27:19] things are are very they're great and
[27:20] they're very important. But one of the
[27:22] gifts that God has given us while we're
[27:25] here is a local congregation that can
[27:28] stand by each other and support each
[27:30] other and and love each other.
[27:33] Scripture is on my heart. I'm going to
[27:35] um my sermon today is going to be on
[27:37] Romans chapter 12 but um 1 Corinthians
[27:42] chapter 12 is very similar and it says
[27:46] when one member of the body suffers all
[27:49] the members suffer with it or when one
[27:51] member be honored all the members
[27:52] rejoice with it. Most other translations
[27:56] they um
[27:58] they they give us an understanding of of
[28:01] this in saying that we should be patient
[28:03] with one another in our weaknesses
[28:07] and we should take on the suffering of
[28:11] other people.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; And that's what a church does.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; That's what I've seen in this past week.
[28:16] We we celebrate the life of of young
[28:20] Banayiah. Praise God for that. But we've
[28:23] also pulled together
[28:25] in uh very very difficult ways. And we
[28:28] have suffered with sister Esther. Is
[28:31] sister Esther here?
[28:33] Bless her heart. We've suffered with
[28:35] sister Esther losing her son. I think he
[28:38] was in his mid30s. Am I right? Ununice
[28:40] was about that.
[28:42] 31 32 31
[28:45] unexpected.
[28:47] And the mom
[28:49] mourned, of course, the loss of her son
[28:54] and the church gathered around her and
[28:57] suffered with her really fulfilling this
[29:00] this scripture.
[29:02] And then we see uh brother Juan and
[29:05] sister Lima O'Hada and they see how
[29:10] what happened with them this week. And
[29:12] I've been keeping the church informed.
[29:14] This is all in one week. They were in uh
[29:17] their daughter was in a tragic accident.
[29:20] A four-year-old little boy
[29:23] um died and then the three other boys
[29:29] are in the in the vehicle with them.
[29:31] Little boys, they're in critical
[29:33] condition now. Their lives just hanging
[29:36] on the balance and hanging on if um
[29:41] God's choice, what what is he going to
[29:43] choose? Is he going to choose to bring
[29:45] them out or is he going to choose to
[29:47] take them? And I know we as parents, we
[29:51] would be crying out to God, Lord,
[29:55] heal my child. But we should really be
[29:58] praying, Lord, what is your will in this
[30:01] because you know better. You know better
[30:02] than than anyone else.
[30:05] He um as I was in the hospital with
[30:07] them,
[30:09] uh it was late at night, I it was one or
[30:11] two in the morning and um they showed me
[30:15] a video of the little guy and they they
[30:18] sit over in this area here
[30:21] and the little guy had his hands up and
[30:25] he was singing a four-year-old boy. He
[30:28] was singing I give myself away.
[30:31] and just think how how beautiful and how
[30:34] wonderful it is
[30:35] &gt;&gt; that the church would provide a place
[30:39] for these people to worship and and I
[30:42] talked with brother Juan and he didn't
[30:44] have a place really that that
[30:47] really loved him and really really
[30:49] respected him and then he found this
[30:51] church and he sees the the love that we
[30:53] have given him and his family
[30:55] &gt;&gt; and and the support that we've given him
[30:57] and the and the support that brother
[30:59] Lionel Sister Lonnie have have showed
[31:02] and and it's it's it's vital.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; I mean, I I think about just something
[31:07] as simple as as brother Josiah choosing
[31:10] that song that day.
[31:13] I give myself away.
[31:15] The choice of the song, having a place
[31:17] to come together, having a place to
[31:20] fellowship, to shake hands, people that
[31:22] that love them and welcome them. How
[31:24] important is that? And I I think Lord,
[31:27] even the song I give myself away,
[31:29] there's a four-year-old boy singing that
[31:31] he wants to surrender his life to the
[31:33] Lord.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; He probably didn't fully know what it
[31:35] meant.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; But he did.
[31:38] And then
[31:40] not too long later,
[31:42] the Lord took the little boy home.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; And as I was talking with the family, I
[31:47] was
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. I was saying that you
[31:53] &gt;&gt; that everybody was weeping around when
[31:55] they found out that the child had passed
[31:57] and and
[32:00] my words were this boy,
[32:04] he's never going to have to go through
[32:06] what you're going through right now.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; He's never going to suffer.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; He's never going to go through a
[32:12] hardship.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; He's made it.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; He's passed that. He's not mourning us.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; We're mourning him.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't have to He doesn't have
[32:23] to lose a loved one. He doesn't have to
[32:25] weep. He doesn't have to cry. He is in
[32:27] the arms of Jesus Christ, a sinless
[32:29] little fouryear-old boy.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; And I think raising his hands. I give
[32:35] myself away. How important.
[32:39] been talking with Sister Esther this
[32:40] past week and losing her son and and she
[32:43] was she's so strong
[32:46] and she found joy in this not in joy of
[32:50] loss but in joy that there is a promise
[32:54] &gt;&gt; there's something greater that she has
[32:56] that she knows that her son is he is not
[32:59] struggling there there's nothing there's
[33:01] nothing wrong with him anymore she has a
[33:03] promise that she is going to see him
[33:04] again
[33:06] &gt;&gt; and now she has support in a church that
[33:09] loves her
[33:11] &gt;&gt; and everyone that everyone that that
[33:14] came into the hospital or talking with
[33:16] Sister Esther, they all see they all
[33:17] seem to say the same thing. He's in a
[33:19] better place
[33:22] or you're going to see him again.
[33:26] And that's why we're here.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; We have a we have a hope. We have a hope
[33:31] that Christ that we will see them again.
[33:35] And soon friends that hope that we have
[33:38] is going to become a reality
[33:42] &gt;&gt; and we have to struggle through this
[33:44] day.
[33:45] You know I we we mourn with each other
[33:52] and then brother Manny when we're
[33:53] dedicating your grandbabies man it's
[33:55] just we we're blessed with each other.
[33:58] We just rejoice that God has brought
[34:01] children into the world that we can that
[34:03] we can enjoy and raise and have and
[34:09] we rejoice when we baptize. Friends,
[34:12] when when we come up into the baptismal
[34:14] and and and people come in there and and
[34:17] they want to give their hearts to the
[34:19] Lord, they want to make this outward
[34:21] expression
[34:22] of of this is what the Lord has done in
[34:25] my heart. Now I want to show everyone
[34:26] that I am a Christian and I am going to
[34:29] serve him all the days of my life. And
[34:31] they come up and and they show the
[34:33] congregation. We baptized over the past
[34:35] couple years over 90 people.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; And and most of those new converts. Most
[34:40] of those aren't children. They're adults
[34:43] that that want to make a change in their
[34:45] life. And we're not baptizing them into
[34:47] the Tucson Tabernacle. We're not
[34:48] baptizing them into this church. We are
[34:50] baptizing them into the body of Jesus
[34:52] Christ. Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; And they are taking on that name.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; And it's it's a blessing. And the thing
[35:00] that I see in our church that I'm so
[35:02] blessed with is that we have patience
[35:04] with each other.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; You know, it's a place really for the
[35:09] sick to come and they can be healed.
[35:11] It's it's a place for the sinner to come
[35:13] and repent. It's a place really for the
[35:15] kindhearted
[35:17] to help someone know that that you're
[35:21] loved
[35:22] and that we'll give you a right hand of
[35:25] fellowship. We'll give you love. And
[35:27] it's just friends, a church is so it's
[35:30] so important.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 15 says, "Then that we
[35:35] that are strong ought to bear the
[35:37] infirmities of the weak and not to
[35:40] please ourselves."
[35:43] English Standard version of that says,
[35:45] "We who are strong have an obligation to
[35:48] bear with the feelings of the weak, the
[35:51] failings of the weak."
[35:53] We who are strong have an obligation to
[35:57] bear with other people's failures and
[36:01] not please ourselves.
[36:04] We have a long way to go, friends. In
[36:06] many ways, we have a long way to go. But
[36:08] our successes have been largely because
[36:11] we have borne the feeling the failings
[36:14] of the weak.
[36:16] And the foundation of this to be able to
[36:20] do that, we haven't pleased ourselves.
[36:24] It's we've served others. And that's
[36:26] what a church is. I say it many times
[36:29] and I say it again. Don't come to this
[36:32] church. And I hear so many people say,
[36:35] "Well, I don't get fed at that church.
[36:38] You don't get fed at that church. Well,
[36:40] then how about you start feeding someone
[36:42] then?
[36:44] &gt;&gt; You know, you start doing something. If
[36:46] you're put out with your church, it's
[36:48] like, well, maybe you need to make more
[36:51] of an effort.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Maybe you need to do more. That's
[36:55] Christianity.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; We serve one another. And that's what a
[36:59] church does. We're here for one another.
[37:01] And I'm going to be talking about
[37:02] there's gifts there. Every congregation,
[37:05] including ours, every person in the
[37:07] building today has a gift to bring to
[37:10] this church. Or if you're part of
[37:12] another church, to bring to that church.
[37:16] That's why we have church.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; It's to bring our gift to the altar.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, here's what I have to off to
[37:26] to offer." And then you'll find, you
[37:28] know what you'll find?
[37:29] &gt;&gt; You'll find that you'll receive
[37:30] everything that you need.
[37:32] You will find you'll find that your
[37:34] attitude changes.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; You'll find that you have more love. You
[37:37] have more compassion when you stop
[37:39] thinking about number one
[37:41] &gt;&gt; and you start thinking about other
[37:42] people.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; The there's two chapters in the Bible
[37:47] that I see describe really the church
[37:52] that God wants us to have. That's 1
[37:55] Corinthians chapter 12 and then Romans
[37:59] chapter 12. Both are speaking to largely
[38:02] gentile audiences,
[38:05] but there is a mixture of some of the
[38:08] Jews in there. And sometimes that
[38:11] mixture is is a little bit hard to deal
[38:13] with. And there's an underlying theme in
[38:17] both chapters. And it's especially made
[38:19] plain in Romans, but it's also it closes
[38:24] that chapter in First Corinthians.
[38:27] And
[38:29] 1 Corinthians, I'll I'll I'll read that
[38:31] last statement. 1 Corinthians
[38:34] 12:31. Now, this is he he lays out how
[38:36] the churches should be. And he talks
[38:39] about the gifts in the church. He talks
[38:41] about prophecy and healing. And he talks
[38:43] about gifts of faith and and serving one
[38:46] another. And then he closes this portion
[38:48] of letter. He said, "But covet earnestly
[38:50] the best gifts." and and talking about
[38:52] the gifts. And they said, "But yet I
[38:54] show you a more excellent way,
[38:59] though I speak with tongue of men and
[39:00] angels and have not charity, which is
[39:02] love, and become a sounding brass and a
[39:05] tinkling symbol." Now, Romans 12, which
[39:08] we're going to read, I want to read the
[39:09] whole chapter, and uh I can cut my word
[39:12] short, but I want I want everyone to
[39:15] just take on this Romans chapter 12. it
[39:19] this this theme of love can be seen
[39:22] throughout this chapter.
[39:27] Romans chapter 12 verse one. Let's just
[39:29] read it. We read it together.
[39:32] Thank you. I beseech you therefore,
[39:34] brethren, by the mercies of God, that
[39:36] you present your bodies a living
[39:38] sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God,
[39:41] which is your reasonable service. and be
[39:44] not conformed to this world, but be ye
[39:47] transformed by the renewing of your
[39:49] mind, that you may prove what is that
[39:51] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[39:54] God. I see that scripture every time I
[39:57] walk into my office, I have it plastered
[39:58] on the wall.
[40:01] For I say through the grace given unto
[40:05] me to every man that is among you, not
[40:07] to think of himself more highly than he
[40:10] ought to think, but to think soberly
[40:12] according as the grace
[40:15] according as God hath dealt to every man
[40:19] the measure of faith. For as we have
[40:23] many members in one body and not and all
[40:26] members have not the same office,
[40:30] so we being many are one body in Christ
[40:33] and everyone members of one another.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; This is a profound statement. When Jesus
[40:39] was walking the earth, all of the gifts
[40:43] were in sight of him.
[40:46] You notice throughout the gospels, they
[40:47] had to get to Jesus.
[40:50] He would he would give part of a spirit
[40:52] and they would go out and they would
[40:53] heal and they'd come back. But all the
[40:55] time salvation rest in rested in Jesus
[40:57] Christ. Healing rested in Jesus Christ.
[41:00] All salvation it everything rested in
[41:04] this man Jesus Christ. Then when he died
[41:08] on the cross, died for our sins, was in
[41:10] the tomb for three days, rose on Sunday
[41:13] morning, went up and then sent down,
[41:17] broke himself apart, tore himself apart,
[41:21] and placed those gifts into his church
[41:24] &gt;&gt; at the day of Pentecost when we received
[41:26] the Holy Spirit. And now
[41:30] all of us have a portion of those gifts.
[41:35] And I say to you is what what Paul is
[41:37] saying here that we all have a role to
[41:41] play in the work of God. Everyone has a
[41:45] role to play.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Now Paul's going to go through with the
[41:48] different gifts in the ministry.
[41:50] [snorts] Having then gifts offering
[41:52] according to the grace that is given us
[41:54] whether prophecy let us prophesy
[41:56] according to the proportion of faith or
[41:58] ministry let us wait on our ministering.
[42:00] Or he that teaching teacheth on
[42:02] teaching.
[42:07] I uh I have to go against my nature. I
[42:09] always want to stop and talk. I get so
[42:11] excited when I read the scriptures. I
[42:12] want to talk and I want to stop and talk
[42:13] about them, but I'm going to try to read
[42:15] through the whole um through the whole
[42:17] chapter. Or he that exhortth on
[42:20] exhortation. Those are encouraging
[42:21] words. Or he that liveth or he that
[42:24] giveth, let him do it with simplicity.
[42:26] That's generosity.
[42:28] He that ruleth with diligence. He that
[42:30] showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.
[42:33] Let love be without dissimulation. Let
[42:36] love be dis let let love love be sincere
[42:39] without hypocrisy.
[42:41] Abore that which is evil and cleave to
[42:43] that which is good. Be kindly
[42:45] affectionate one to another with
[42:46] brotherly love and honoring preferring
[42:49] one another. Now these next three verses
[42:51] are really the theme for my sermon this
[42:54] morning. Not slothful in business,
[42:57] fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.
[43:00] English Standard Version says, "Don't be
[43:01] slothful in zeal.
[43:04] Be fervent in spirit. Serve the Lord,
[43:07] rejoicing in hope, patient in
[43:10] tribulation,
[43:12] continuing instant in prayer." That is
[43:16] the theme that I want our church I want
[43:19] our church to have for this upcoming
[43:21] 2026.
[43:23] rejoicing in hope, patient in
[43:26] tribulation, and continuing instant in
[43:30] prayer. The amplified version, it's a
[43:32] little easier to understand. It says,
[43:33] "Constantly rejoicing in hope because of
[43:36] our confidence in Christ, steadfast and
[43:40] patient in distress,
[43:43] devoted to prayer,
[43:47] distributing to the necessity of the
[43:49] saints, giving given to hospitality."
[43:52] I'll read the rest of the chapter. Bless
[43:54] them which persecute you. Bless and
[43:56] curse not. Rejoice with them that do
[43:58] rejoice and weep with them that do weep.
[44:02] Be of the same mind one to another. Mind
[44:05] not high things, but condescend to men
[44:08] of low estate. Be not wise in your own
[44:11] conceits.
[44:13] Recompense to no man evil for evil.
[44:16] Prove things honest in the sight of all
[44:19] men. And if it be possible, as much as
[44:21] lith in you, live peaceibly with all
[44:24] men. Dearly beloved,
[44:28] avenge not yourselves, but rather give
[44:30] place under wrath. For it is written,
[44:33] vengeance is mine, I will repay, sayeth
[44:36] the Lord. Therefore, if thine anger, if
[44:38] thine enemy hunger, feed him. Thine
[44:40] enemy hunger, feed him.
[44:44] If he thirst, give him drink.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; For in doing so, you shall heap coals of
[44:48] fire on his head.
[44:50] Be not overcome of evil, but overcome
[44:54] evil with good. It's my New Year's
[44:57] message this morning. Rejoicing in hope.
[45:01] Verse number 12. Rejoicing in hope,
[45:05] patient in tribulation,
[45:07] continuing instant in prayer.
[45:13] Another translation in Romans 12 says,
[45:15] "Let your hope, let your hope keep you
[45:18] joyful,
[45:23] &gt;&gt; know just going through this past week,
[45:26] as I was saying,
[45:29] there wasn't a time there was weeping in
[45:32] the week and in all all the all the
[45:34] things that were going on. There was a
[45:36] lot of weeping. There was a lot of
[45:37] crying out to God. But one thing I
[45:39] didn't see, I I didn't see any
[45:41] complaining. What I saw was it was it
[45:43] was it was thanksgiving
[45:45] that when something like this hap
[45:47] happens, there was hope there saying
[45:49] that I'm going to see this person again.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; He's going to be there.
[45:56] And hope lies. It It resides in Jesus
[45:59] Christ. That's the only place that we
[46:01] can have hope. That's right.
[46:04] and thinking
[46:06] and talking about these losses that have
[46:09] happened.
[46:11] We have promises that we all look to.
[46:14] Listen to this. 1 Thessalonians 4:13.
[46:20] You can put it up if you can. 1
[46:21] Thessalonians 4:13.
[46:24] But I would not have you ignorant,
[46:25] brethren,
[46:27] concerning them which are asleep, that
[46:30] you sorrow not even as others which have
[46:32] no hope. For if we believe that Jesus
[46:34] died and rose again, even so them also
[46:37] which sleep, Jesus will bring with him.
[46:40] Of course, they're rejoicing over that.
[46:42] Of course, Juan and Leman are rejoicing
[46:44] over the loss of their their grandchild
[46:47] is because they have this promise.
[46:50] For this we say unto you by the word of
[46:52] the Lord, that we which are alive and
[46:54] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[46:56] not prevent them which are asleep. For
[46:58] the Lord himself shall descend from
[47:01] heaven with a shout, with the voice of
[47:03] with the voice of an archangel, with the
[47:06] trump of God, and the dead in Christ
[47:08] shall rise first. Who is the dead in
[47:10] Christ? They're the ones that have gone
[47:12] before us. So if the Lord Jesus comes
[47:15] today, those that are dead in Christ,
[47:18] those that we have lost, they are going
[47:20] to come up and we're going to go
[47:21] together. If the Lord carries until we
[47:23] die, we're going to be the ones
[47:25] &gt;&gt; that come up out of the grave. There's
[47:27] going to be a generation one day that
[47:29] sees the second coming of Christ. And
[47:31] you know what? If you are a Christian,
[47:32] you're going to be in that generation.
[47:34] No matter if you passed a hundred years
[47:36] ago or 200 years ago, you are going to
[47:39] see it. If you are resting
[47:42] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ,
[47:48] &gt;&gt; then we which are alive and remain shall
[47:49] be caught up
[47:52] together with them in the clouds to meet
[47:54] the Lord in the air. and so shall we be
[47:56] ever with the Lord.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Wherefore,
[47:59] &gt;&gt; listen to this. Wherefore, comfort one
[48:02] another with these words.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Brother, that's awesome, man.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; It's what we we're doing. We might not
[48:08] They might not even know that they're
[48:09] quoting that scripture.
[48:11] You're going to see them again.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; And where does this hope come from?
[48:18] Where do we get where do we get the
[48:20] hope? A messenger from God carries this
[48:23] hope with him. or her and gives it to
[48:27] the ones that need it.
[48:31] How many times have people told me I've
[48:33] messed up my life
[48:36] and they're they're thinking that
[48:37] they're beyond happiness that that they
[48:39] can't ever come back because of the
[48:41] mistakes that we we made. Yes, we suffer
[48:43] for our mistakes. But don't you think
[48:45] that Jesus can fix our mistakes?
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; And return joy to our lives.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; But sometimes you need a messenger of
[48:53] hope. You need an angel of hope to come
[48:56] and tell you, "Listen, it's not all that
[48:58] bad. You can recover from this. I know
[49:00] it seems bad, but there's the the night
[49:05] is going to end and the the sun's going
[49:07] to rise."
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; There was a woman in the Bible, one of
[49:11] my favorite stories from Jesus.
[49:15] She had sinned. There is no doubt that
[49:18] she had sinned and ruined her life and
[49:21] ruined the life of another family. She
[49:24] had committed an adultery with a married
[49:26] man.
[49:28] And the punishment for this back then
[49:32] the punishment was death by stoning.
[49:36] That is what you did.
[49:39] Today you may kick somebody out of
[49:41] church or something like that. And it
[49:43] was as common back then as doing
[49:45] something like that today is stoning.
[49:50] And they come to Jesus and and they knew
[49:53] there were these Pharisees knew they
[49:55] hated him, but they knew that he had a
[49:57] burden for the lost. They knew that this
[50:00] man Jesus Christ had a burden for the
[50:02] sinner.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Those are who he surrounded himself
[50:05] with. They're like, "Oh, he's around
[50:06] with drunkards and publicans and and
[50:09] dishonest tax collectors. That's who he
[50:11] hangs out with."
[50:13] &gt;&gt; They knew that he had a burden for those
[50:15] people.
[50:17] So they said, "Hey Jesus, let's show
[50:20] your let's show who you really are
[50:22] again. What do you think about this
[50:25] woman?" Maybe she was tied up. Maybe she
[50:28] was on her knees on the ground.
[50:30] They said, "What do you think about this
[50:32] woman?"
[50:34] Jesus,
[50:36] he didn't answer them.
[50:39] I wonder if he was wonder if he was
[50:42] thinking.
[50:45] They knew that the Bible
[50:49] taught very plainly from the books of
[50:51] Moses, this woman should be stoned. They
[50:54] could open up their Bible and they can
[50:55] point. Here's what the word says. Now,
[50:57] you're going to live up to it, Jesus.
[51:00] Jesus bent down,
[51:04] started drawing
[51:06] in the sand,
[51:10] stood up,
[51:13] and he said, "All right." Basically, he
[51:17] said, "All right, go ahead and stone
[51:18] her." He said, "But let you that is
[51:21] without sin,
[51:23] you that has never sinned, you cast the
[51:27] first stone."
[51:28] They're all standing there with their
[51:30] stones.
[51:33] Jesus basically said, "Go ahead and do
[51:34] it."
[51:36] But you that's without without sin, you
[51:38] start the mob.
[51:40] You start you start attacking people.
[51:43] You start you start condemning people.
[51:45] You start judging people. You do it
[51:48] first. You that is without sin. Let me
[51:51] hear you start talking. You start
[51:53] putting people down because you think
[51:54] that they don't live up to your Pharisee
[51:56] religion. Let me see you do it is what
[51:58] Jesus was saying. And then the wise
[52:01] ones, who were the older ones, the wise
[52:04] ones had the stone in their hand,
[52:09] they threw it down.
[52:11] They started walking away. And from the
[52:13] oldest, I assume the more wisest to the
[52:16] young more zealous and maybe more
[52:18] fullheartedly
[52:21] until there was no one left but just
[52:23] Jesus and this woman.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; And Jesus
[52:27] is standing there maybe all the stones
[52:29] laying around her. Can you imagine this
[52:31] woman? I'm talking about hope today.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; There was no hope for her. She had
[52:38] sinned. She was she was finished. She
[52:40] was caught in the act. She had probably
[52:42] ruined another family. She was a lowly
[52:46] person. And now the law said you are to
[52:50] be stoned. There was no hope for her.
[52:52] She was she was gone. But you know what?
[52:54] this voice. When she heard that voice, I
[52:57] wonder if she's heard if she felt a
[53:00] little bit of hope in this man.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ brings hope to our lives.
[53:08] No matter what you have done, no matter
[53:10] what you have gone through, no matter
[53:12] your sins or no matter your loss, Jesus
[53:15] will always bring hope. And there he is.
[53:17] She hears that voice. Jesus says,
[53:20] "Sister, where uh where are your
[53:22] accusers?
[53:23] They're all gone.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus stood up again and said to the
[53:34] woman, "Where are your accusers?
[53:36] Didn't even one of them condemn you,
[53:40] sis?
[53:41] They're all gone. Didn't just one of
[53:44] them condemn you?"
[53:46] And there she is, and she's seeing the
[53:48] manifestation of the hope that's in
[53:49] Jesus Christ. And she says, "No, Lord.
[53:52] They're all gone. And Jesus said, listen
[53:56] to this.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus had there is no condemnation in
[54:00] Jesus Christ. You know what Jesus says?
[54:02] He says, "Neither do I.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no
[54:08] more." The spirit of Christ is not
[54:10] condemnation.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; It tells us that there's a way out. It
[54:14] tells us that there is redemption for
[54:16] our sins. It does not say
[54:20] necessarily you are a sinner.
[54:24] Usually friends they know that
[54:28] it does say that there is hope.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; How important is hope in our lives?
[54:34] There was a woman that
[54:37] had a question
[54:40] torn up maybe maybe feeling the same as
[54:42] this woman did in the when she was going
[54:45] to be stoned and she had she had messed
[54:47] up.
[54:49] She asked brother Brandham a question.
[54:50] She said, "I've sinned many years. I
[54:53] have lived many years and sinned until I
[54:55] found the Lord."
[54:58] Please, Brother Brandham, I have sinned
[55:00] again and I'm not worthy to come before
[55:03] you in this holy place.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Please tell me if I can be restored
[55:07] whole again.
[55:10] The condemnation of the enemy beating
[55:13] this woman down.
[55:16] The answer says, "You have not sinned,
[55:20] my friend, so far in God, but what you
[55:23] could not be restored. If you had sinned
[55:26] so far that you could not be restored,
[55:28] you would have never wanted to be
[55:30] restored.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; But as long as there is something
[55:33] dealing with your heart, you're still in
[55:36] line of re of restoration.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Guilty of the least is guilty of the
[55:42] whole. Brother Bram continues, "I have
[55:44] sinned many times. Every one of us do
[55:48] things that we don't want to do. Every
[55:51] day, every one of us do things that we
[55:54] don't want to do.
[55:59] That's a messenger of hope. That's an
[56:02] angel of hope that could come. And
[56:04] friends, all of us should be those
[56:07] angels.
[56:09] And that's the spirit I want to present
[56:12] &gt;&gt; from this church in 2026 that there is
[56:15] hope. There's hope for our families.
[56:17] There's hope for a a a sinner. There's
[56:19] hope for our neighborhood around this
[56:21] area. There's hope and there's hope for
[56:25] anyone. No matter how bad that they
[56:27] look, no matter how bad the situation
[56:29] is, there is a hope in Jesus Christ. It
[56:32] was not worth It was not worse. There's
[56:34] no situation worse than this woman who
[56:36] is about to be stoned to death.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; There's no situation that's that bad.
[56:42] You could be on your deathbed. The Lord
[56:44] can raise you up. Right.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; You could have sin.
[56:48] I have messed up so bad. Yeah, but
[56:50] you're throwing out hope.
[56:53] You're throwing out Jesus Christ when
[56:54] you do that.
[56:57] The one who ascended up on high, friends
[57:01] and led captivity captive. He gave gifts
[57:06] to men and women. us in this church.
[57:11] Everyone in this church has a gift to
[57:14] bring. You have something that God has
[57:17] called you to do. If you are not
[57:19] operating in in that gift, then
[57:22] the church is incomplete.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; In 2024,
[57:29] we
[57:31] met each other and and the church was
[57:33] growing and and we got to know each
[57:36] other. It was really the the year
[57:40] of of um getting acquainted.
[57:44] Then in 2025,
[57:46] we built,
[57:48] brother Pat, it was a year of
[57:50] construction. You notice everything's
[57:51] changed, man. It's we we built a
[57:54] facility that we can use. The facility
[57:56] doesn't matter, but it's what the what
[57:58] is the facility is used for. And now in
[58:02] 2026,
[58:05] I want to this to be
[58:08] our theme where we go out and we become
[58:10] angels of hope to the world to our ne
[58:14] and let's start in our neighborhood
[58:16] that no that everything's going to be
[58:19] okay that God is on the throne and I am
[58:22] that messenger to tell you that Jesus
[58:25] Christ saves that Jesus Christ heals
[58:28] that Jesus Christ can change the
[58:30] situation.
[58:36] Every person has a gift. Paul's talking
[58:39] about in 1 Corinthians 12, he talks
[58:41] about tongues and interpretation of
[58:42] tongues. He c he talks about
[58:44] administrations. He talks about
[58:46] leadership. He and and we talk about
[58:48] outreach and we talk about the ministry.
[58:50] We talk about gifts of faith, gifts of
[58:52] prayer. But there's also, you know what?
[58:53] There's also gifts of doing the sound in
[58:55] the back.
[58:57] There's also gifts of taking care of the
[59:01] church. There's also gifts of of
[59:03] gardening somewhere where we can help to
[59:05] make this place nice so so everyone can
[59:07] enjoy it. We all have a part to play
[59:12] and we should do the best that we we
[59:14] know how to do the best that we can do
[59:16] in doing that part. And then you watch
[59:18] how God blesses it.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; He will bless you. You you'll be
[59:24] surprised. It's like, "Oh, well, I just
[59:26] I just sweep the floor."
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron and I Brother Aaron and I
[59:31] were here one time and uh we were moving
[59:33] stuff around, moving furniture around.
[59:34] We're moving the pulpit around. We're
[59:37] standing there and
[59:40] church is dark. There's nobody here.
[59:42] We're just laboring. We're just working.
[59:45] All right. You never think God could use
[59:47] that, do you? Here we are. And man, we
[59:50] turn around and there is a man sitting
[59:53] on the front row covered in blood.
[59:58] It scared Aaron to death [laughter]
[1:00:01] and turned around.
[1:00:04] We're able to witness to that man. We're
[1:00:07] able to pray for that man. He had just
[1:00:10] gotten beat up on the street.
[1:00:12] And why were we able to do it? It was
[1:00:15] because we were here working. Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; We were operating in the calling that
[1:00:20] God had placed before us that day.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; You have no idea if you are operating in
[1:00:25] that calling. You have no idea how great
[1:00:27] it can be. If it's sweeping the floor,
[1:00:30] if it's moving furniture, if it's
[1:00:32] standing in the pulpit, whatever it is,
[1:00:34] God can use it.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Let me just
[1:00:44] let me read the let me read the
[1:00:46] scripture again.
[1:00:47] I got way too much going on.
[1:00:51] I uh I don't I don't want to I always,
[1:00:54] friends, when when I'm ministering,
[1:00:58] I I don't want it to be about me and I
[1:01:01] don't want it to be about me trying to
[1:01:03] get out what I want to say. I want to I
[1:01:06] want it to be the Lord using me, using
[1:01:08] the congregation. And
[1:01:12] just because I want I want to say
[1:01:14] something, it doesn't necessarily mean
[1:01:15] that the Lord wants me to say it. But I
[1:01:18] do believe he wants me to encourage the
[1:01:20] congregation today. This is
[1:01:24] a year and just in the past week, it has
[1:01:28] shown this is a year that we can be
[1:01:30] angels of hope that we can give hope to
[1:01:32] other people. I want to I want to have a
[1:01:35] um a gathering for the the neighborhood.
[1:01:38] I want to make it nice for them out here
[1:01:42] and just say, "Come on in.
[1:01:45] Oh, we're Christians.
[1:01:47] We love the Lord and we love you." And
[1:01:48] that's what Christians do. Brother
[1:01:50] Josiah and the worship team can come.
[1:01:53] Romans chapter 12 again, verse 12.
[1:01:57] Rejoicing in hope, patient in
[1:02:00] tribulation,
[1:02:02] continuing instant in prayer.
[1:02:06] We rejoice because we have the hope. But
[1:02:10] we are patient in tribulation. Things
[1:02:14] happen.
[1:02:15] Hard things happen in our lives. And we
[1:02:18] shouldn't always be saying, "Lord, what
[1:02:20] did I do to deserve this? What did I do
[1:02:22] to cause this to happen?" Maybe it's not
[1:02:24] that. Maybe it's just that he wants to
[1:02:26] give us a tribulation. Give us a trial
[1:02:29] so that we will draw closer to the to
[1:02:32] him and rest in him and have comfort in
[1:02:35] him
[1:02:37] and continuing instant in prayer. That
[1:02:41] word instant continuously
[1:02:44] praying all the time. That is how
[1:02:50] that we find joy in tribulation. That is
[1:02:53] how that we can encourage others. That
[1:02:57] is how that that we can take our place
[1:03:00] in God's perfect plan is if we're
[1:03:04] praying and we're putting this before
[1:03:05] the Lord.
[1:03:07] I can't
[1:03:10] that story
[1:03:12] of that little lady
[1:03:15] and how that
[1:03:18] that she's she's there and her life was
[1:03:22] ruined.
[1:03:23] It was over. It was done.
[1:03:28] And yet,
[1:03:30] I'm sure there was so much shame. I'm
[1:03:32] sure she was just dying to herself. And
[1:03:34] I'm sure there was all of this regret.
[1:03:36] And then here here comes the thought of
[1:03:38] I'm I'm going to be publicly executed.
[1:03:41] This shame is going to be on my family.
[1:03:43] This is just this is the worst thing in
[1:03:45] the world. And plus, you know what? I
[1:03:47] would just rather die.
[1:03:50] I would just rather that these stones
[1:03:52] come down upon my head.
[1:03:55] And then Jesus, he shows up. He says,
[1:03:58] "Listen."
[1:04:01] He says, "Everybody has sinned.
[1:04:05] These men over here, they showed a
[1:04:07] little bit of wisdom in not condemning
[1:04:09] this little lady."
[1:04:12] Jesus says, "Listen." He makes a way. He
[1:04:15] says, "Where are your accusers?"
[1:04:18] And friends, when people come to this
[1:04:20] church in 2026, that's what I want them
[1:04:22] to find
[1:04:24] is they come in
[1:04:27] and they say, "You know what? I don't
[1:04:29] have any accusers here.
[1:04:31] These people have the spirit of Christ.
[1:04:33] There's no condemnation
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; in there." And then they have hope and
[1:04:37] that hope starts to build and then the
[1:04:40] joy starts to come in and then their
[1:04:43] families start to come in and then then
[1:04:45] there's more joy and more joy and then
[1:04:47] then the hardship when the hardship
[1:04:49] comes they're more able to handle it.
[1:04:51] When one of their children dies in a car
[1:04:53] accident or or their son their young son
[1:04:56] dies of a heart attack, they have the
[1:04:58] ability now to get through it because
[1:05:01] they have hope. and who brought him hope
[1:05:03] is a messenger of hope which should be
[1:05:05] us.
[1:05:08] Love one another.
[1:05:10] Help one another. The Apostle John, the
[1:05:13] one that was closest to Jesus. Really,
[1:05:15] if Jesus had a best friend, it was John.
[1:05:20] Read his epistles. Just love one
[1:05:22] another, friends. Just love each other.
[1:05:25] Be there for each other. Don't judge one
[1:05:27] another. Just just encourage one
[1:05:30] another. And then that's how the body of
[1:05:31] Christ grows. It grows. It grows through
[1:05:34] reaching out a hand of fellowship,
[1:05:37] not condemnation,
[1:05:39] but justification through Christ.
[1:05:43] You with me,
[1:05:46] friends? None of us I love the way
[1:05:48] Brother Bram said it. None of us have
[1:05:51] sinned so far
[1:05:53] that there's no that that you can't come
[1:05:56] back to God. That's the devil in your
[1:05:59] head.
[1:06:00] He's in there and he's he's pointing out
[1:06:02] all of your failures. And then you know
[1:06:04] what? You can just point him
[1:06:07] to that woman that was about to be
[1:06:09] stoned and said and say, "Satan,
[1:06:13] there's all kinds of stories like that
[1:06:15] in the Bible. I'm one of those.
[1:06:19] I'm one of them.
[1:06:22] I'm a Jesus person. I'm a Christian."
[1:06:24] And [music] you know what? this this
[1:06:26] blessing, this lack of condemnation that
[1:06:29] that Jesus had with me, this this spirit
[1:06:33] of salvation that Jesus had, I'm going
[1:06:35] to spread it. I'm going to spread it to
[1:06:38] others in this year 2026.
[1:06:43] Let's get to work.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; We need help,
[1:06:49] right? We need help in this church.
[1:06:52] Let's get to work, friends.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bring your bring your sacrifice
[1:06:57] before the Lord.
[1:06:59] If it may be
[1:07:02] that you sacrifice an extra 20 minutes,
[1:07:06] 30 minutes a day praying for the ones
[1:07:09] that you see in church.
[1:07:11] Maybe that's your calling as a prayer
[1:07:13] warrior. Maybe your calling is to get
[1:07:16] out and win souls, win souls to Christ.
[1:07:18] Or maybe your calling is to win your
[1:07:20] children to Christ. Maybe your calling
[1:07:23] is to like me and brother Aaron moving
[1:07:26] the furniture.
[1:07:28] But you watch what God can do with it.
[1:07:30] What is the man named Shamgar
[1:07:33] in the book of Judges?
[1:07:35] You know what his calling was? He's a
[1:07:37] farmer.
[1:07:40] Just a farmer. Not anything special.
[1:07:42] This man Shamgar, he was nothing.
[1:07:47] And then he took here comes the
[1:07:50] Philistine horde coming to destroy him
[1:07:54] and destroy his his family to destroy
[1:07:56] his village to rape the women and steal
[1:08:00] them and and steal their livelihoods and
[1:08:02] kill all the men. And you know what Sham
[1:08:04] Shamgar did? He had a he had an ox coat.
[1:08:07] He had a poker that he would poke the
[1:08:09] cattle with.
[1:08:11] The spirit of the Lord came on him and
[1:08:14] he took that and he killed hundreds of
[1:08:19] Philistines
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; and all his calling was was to be a
[1:08:22] farmer. He judged Israel.
[1:08:27] So whatever that calling is, God can
[1:08:28] make it great if we humble [music]
[1:08:30] ourselves, love one another, put him
[1:08:34] first.
[1:08:36] The way we serve God, I say it many
[1:08:39] times. It's not what you don't do for
[1:08:41] God that matters. Well, I quit smoking.
[1:08:44] I quit drinking. I quit wearing these
[1:08:45] clothes. I quit doing this. I quit doing
[1:08:47] that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. I'm
[1:08:48] glad. That kind of stuff just kind of
[1:08:50] falls off when you have a focus
[1:08:54] when you're doing something for God
[1:08:56] instead of instead of not doing
[1:08:59] something for God.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Josiah,
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; thank you.
[1:09:06] Let's sing that song again. I give
[1:09:07] myself away. I give myself [singing]
[1:09:11] away.
[1:09:17] I give myself away
[1:09:21] so you
[1:09:23] can use [music] me. Give myself
[1:09:26] [singing]
[1:09:27] away.
[1:09:33] I give myself away.
[1:09:36] So [music] you
[1:09:38] can use me.
[1:09:41] Here I am. [music]
[1:09:45] Here I stand.
[1:09:48] Lord, my [singing]
[1:09:50] life
[1:09:52] is in your hands.
[1:09:56] Lord, I'm [music] longing
[1:10:01] to see
[1:10:04] your desires [singing]
[1:10:07] revealed [music]
[1:10:09] in me.
[1:10:11] I give myself away. [music]
[1:10:19] I give myself [singing]
[1:10:21] away [music]
[1:10:22] so you
[1:10:24] can use me. I give [music] myself away.
[1:10:28] [singing]
[1:10:32] [music]
[1:10:34] Give myself away
[1:10:38] so you
[1:10:40] can use me. Take my heart. [music]
[1:10:46] Take my [singing] life
[1:10:50] as a [music] living
[1:10:54] sacriice.
[1:10:57] Lord, all [singing] my dreams,
[1:11:01] oh [music]
[1:11:02] my plans,
[1:11:05] Lord, I place
[1:11:08] them in your hands. [music]
[1:11:12] I give myself away.
[1:11:17] Oh,
[1:11:19] give myself away
[1:11:23] so you can use me. [music] I give myself
[1:11:28] away.
[1:11:34] I give myself [music]
[1:11:36] away
[1:11:37] so you can use me. My life is not my
[1:11:42] own.
[1:11:43] My life is not my [singing] own.
[1:11:47] [music] To you I belong.
[1:11:51] I give myself I give myself to you.
[1:11:58] My life is not my own. [singing]
[1:12:02] Lord to you I belong.
[1:12:06] Give myself [music] give myself
[1:12:08] [singing]
[1:12:09] to you.
[1:12:14] I was just looking for it. There's a
[1:12:15] scripture and believe it's in Isaiah.
[1:12:20] It says when the enemy comes in like a
[1:12:23] flood
[1:12:25] that God will raise a standard against
[1:12:27] them.
[1:12:29] When the enemy comes in
[1:12:32] like a flood to to all of these these
[1:12:36] hardships and trials. It could be drugs
[1:12:39] with a loved one. It could be someone
[1:12:42] that's just questioning their very
[1:12:43] salvation. When that enemy comes in like
[1:12:46] a flood, God sends us as a standard
[1:12:50] against it.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; That we might be an angel of hope to
[1:12:56] people who need they genuinely need
[1:12:59] something.
[1:13:01] Do you want to be that standard that God
[1:13:03] raises up against the enemy that you can
[1:13:07] go to battle?
[1:13:11] The way that you battle him is you love
[1:13:14] that person that needs you.
[1:13:17] And then let me tell you something.
[1:13:18] Nothing could ever stand before your
[1:13:20] prayer. Let's all stand.
[1:13:29] when he reached
[1:13:31] down his hand
[1:13:34] for me. [music and singing]
[1:13:40] When he [music] reached
[1:13:43] down his hand [singing]
[1:13:46] for me.
[1:13:51] [music]
[1:13:52] I was [singing] lost
[1:13:55] and undone
[1:13:58] without God
[1:14:00] [singing] or his son.
[1:14:04] When he reached [music]
[1:14:06] down his hand
[1:14:09] for me. Once my soul was astray. [music]
[1:14:15] Once my soul
[1:14:18] was a stray.
[1:14:21] of [music] the head
[1:14:23] and leave the flame
[1:14:26] and was red [singing]
[1:14:29] [music]
[1:14:29] and vile
[1:14:31] as could be.
[1:14:36] Oh, but [music] my savior
[1:14:40] [singing] above
[1:14:42] he gave me peace,
[1:14:45] joy and love. Hallelujah. when [music]
[1:14:48] he reached
[1:14:51] down his bed.
[1:14:54] Oh. Oh, sing it now. When he reached
[1:14:58] Oh, when he reached
[1:15:01] down his hand [music and singing]
[1:15:04] for me.
[1:15:09] Oh, and he reached [music] down his hand
[1:15:15] for me.
[1:15:19] Oh,
[1:15:20] I [singing and music] was lost
[1:15:23] and undone
[1:15:26] without God [singing]
[1:15:29] for his son
[1:15:31] when [music] he reached
[1:15:34] down his hand
[1:15:37] for [music] me.
[1:15:40] Can you imagine Peter?
[1:15:43] He was serving God. He was doing really
[1:15:45] good.
[1:15:47] He walked out on the ocean, walked out
[1:15:49] on the sea,
[1:15:51] and there he is. He's saying, "I'm being
[1:15:53] a Christian. I'm doing it. I'm
[1:15:55] performing well."
[1:15:57] And then
[1:16:00] like that question that came in,
[1:16:03] Lord, I failed.
[1:16:06] I messed up. Is there any redemption for
[1:16:08] me? And there is Peter. He loses faith
[1:16:11] and he begins to sink. He starts looking
[1:16:13] at all the storms. He starts looking at
[1:16:15] all the problems and the lightning and
[1:16:16] the thunder and the waves and he begins
[1:16:18] to go down and there was no salvation
[1:16:21] for Peter. There's no way that his his
[1:16:23] friends could have thrown him a line.
[1:16:24] They couldn't see him. It was dark
[1:16:26] outside. All kinds of problems. And then
[1:16:29] a hand reaches down.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; And grabs Peter and pulls him back up.
[1:16:37] Can you imagine?
[1:16:40] Let's be that hand, friends.
[1:16:43] Let's be the hand that God uses. One
[1:16:45] more time.
[1:16:47] I was nearing [singing]
[1:16:50] despair [music]
[1:16:52] when he came [singing]
[1:16:55] to me [music] then.
[1:16:58] And he showed [singing]
[1:17:01] me [music] that I
[1:17:03] could be free.
[1:17:09] Then he lifted
[1:17:12] my feet [music]
[1:17:14] and gave me glory [singing]
[1:17:18] complete.
[1:17:20] when [music] he reached
[1:17:23] down his hand
[1:17:26] for me.
[1:17:28] [music]
[1:17:30] Oh, when he reached
[1:17:34] out his [music] hand
[1:17:36] for [singing] me.
[1:17:41] Oh, when he reached
[1:17:44] down [music and singing] his hand
[1:17:47] for me.
[1:17:50] [music]
[1:17:52] I was [singing] lost
[1:17:55] and undone
[1:17:58] without God [music and singing]
[1:18:01] or his son.
[1:18:04] And he reached
[1:18:06] down his hand
[1:18:09] for just one more time. When he reached
[1:18:11] down his [music] hand.
[1:18:14] When he reached
[1:18:17] down his hand [music]
[1:18:20] for me. [singing]
[1:18:25] When he reached
[1:18:27] down [music and singing] his hand
[1:18:30] for me.
[1:18:36] I was [music and singing] lost
[1:18:38] and undone.
[1:18:41] without [music and singing] God
[1:18:44] or his son
[1:18:46] when he reached
[1:18:49] down.
[1:18:53] Let's bow our heads.
[1:18:58] What a beautiful song,
[1:19:03] friends. Is every one of us here
[1:19:06] with your heads bowed and thinking on
[1:19:08] these things?
[1:19:10] Be that angel of hope.
[1:19:13] Every one of us is called to that.
[1:19:16] Reach out your hand to someone that
[1:19:18] needs you. Let this be the year.
[1:19:21] And we call many to our savior and our
[1:19:24] lord Jesus Christ. Jude said, "Pull them
[1:19:28] out of the fire."
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus reached down and pulled Peter up
[1:19:32] out of the water.
[1:19:35] The Lord Jesus,
[1:19:37] he did it by just a few words.
[1:19:40] Let him that is without without sin cast
[1:19:42] the first stone.
[1:19:46] Compassion, forgiveness, and love in
[1:19:48] that man, Jesus Christ. I pray that all
[1:19:51] of us have that.
[1:19:55] Now I ask each one of you to be
[1:19:59] that angel
[1:20:01] to those that need you.
[1:20:04] Father,
[1:20:07] Lord, we're grateful that
[1:20:10] you've given us a work to do. Every one
[1:20:12] of us, Lord.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that we could be good
[1:20:17] stewards
[1:20:19] of what you have given us. And as the
[1:20:22] parable goes that we wouldn't bury our
[1:20:24] coin in the ground, bury our talent in
[1:20:27] the ground. But Lord, let us take it and
[1:20:31] multiply it. Take what you have given us
[1:20:34] and build upon it. Father,
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, may our lives
[1:20:43] be focused on you and upon your
[1:20:45] children. and help us, Father, to look
[1:20:48] back, look past our own faults and past
[1:20:50] our own past our own lives and past our
[1:20:52] own selves
[1:20:54] and start looking to the needs of
[1:20:56] others.
[1:20:58] Lord, I thank you for a church
[1:21:02] that I've been very proud of this week
[1:21:06] and have reached out.
[1:21:10] Lord, thank you for testimony that
[1:21:12] Josiah gave me
[1:21:16] about how many people in this church
[1:21:17] have reached out to him and Katie with
[1:21:19] their love and
[1:21:21] good wishes.
[1:21:24] Lord, I'm thankful.
[1:21:27] Lord, I never want to neglect to say
[1:21:29] thank you for what you've given us.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, I pray that you would give us
[1:21:36] our commission and help us to move
[1:21:38] forward into this new year.
[1:21:42] Father, with patience and spreading
[1:21:45] hope, the hope of Jesus Christ, that
[1:21:48] others may rejoice like we do in that
[1:21:51] hope of Christ.
[1:21:54] Lord, we thank you and
[1:21:57] and ask that you would look past,
[1:21:59] Father, our shortcomings
[1:22:01] and our weaknesses.
[1:22:04] Lord, we thank you for each other. And
[1:22:08] now father we want to do our part in
[1:22:12] serving you and serving your people in
[1:22:14] Jesus name. Amen.
