to me so great of Salvation so rich and so free thank you so much good evening you've never heard me say that before have you somebody's little child one time said oh I know that's the one that always says good evening well I I really appreciated the word this morning um brother Aaron didn't know it but it was a perfect lead into some of the things that were on my heart to share this evening and even some of the verses he used at first I thought oh and then I thought yes so uh but I've got a couple of things I want to say please please be seated and and I just want to talk to you for just a moment and then and then we'll get started because because tonight's a little bit shorter than usual so I've got a little extra time to just chat with you but uh you you may um you may be aware that uh 100 years ago this week and 100 years ago this month there was a there was a guy that was digging around in uh in Egypt in in Luxor and the Valley of the Kings and he was looking for something he was looking and looking he'd been looking for years for something that he thought it's there but no one had ever found it and it was a bit of a mystery and so they started digging on November 1st 1922 and they were digging in an area that's just kind of a pathway in this Valley of the Kings in an area where the workman's Huts ruins or those used to be and they one of the guys dug a little bit and they found a step under the dirt oh they got a little excited and over the next couple of days that was November 3rd when they found that step by November 4th they didn't cover 12 steps in a landing and thought Oh this might be it so this fellow Harvard Carter he sent back to England to Lord carnivan the fellow that was financing this Expedition and said come I think we found it so they got their like on November 23rd this guy and his daughter and and his wife and so forth and they finished digging down the 16 steps and they found this this door this passageway and it had been broken through into the past and they dug a little further and and on on November the 26th some accounts say November 25th but on November 26th they came to a door that had been sealed and it looked like it hadn't been broken and they punched a little hole on a corner of the door and stood back in case it was any bad air in there and they got this iron bar and poked it through to see if there was a bunch of rubble or something and they didn't contact anything without iron bar so it made the hole a little bit bigger they got a candle and they held it up in case any bad stuff came out right and no bad stuff and he got the candle through there and it was dim and his eyes took a little while to adjust and when they adjusted he saw a treasure he saw a gold and he was asked do you see anything and he said yes I see wonderful things and that's why we're here tonight because if God Will Open the Eyes of our heart then in the dim flickering light of the candle that will be holding up this evening looking through that little peephole of the word we'll be able to see wonderful things I'm here tonight because I'm expecting wonderful things and I trust you are too last time I spoke with you We examined some highlights from the Epistle of Paul the letter to the Ephesians we explored some of the promises how they applied to each of us personally and individually we put our names in there we learned how to not grieve the Holy Spirit what to avoid and what to practice tonight I want to share another lesson from this writing of Paul but first if I could ask you to please stand I'd like us to approach the Lord before we approach the word Lord Jesus our hearts are full we've sung songs of worship and praise and it's not just the musicians and it's not just brother Peter but it's each person that is here tonight lifting their heart and worship and praise and thankfulness and adoration to you Lord the lover and savior of our souls Lord Jesus we pray tonight that you'd speak to us through your word Lord that that these thoughts Lord that I I believe that are from you Lord that they would be a blessing Lord that whatever mistakes I might make in in saying things that people will hear and they'll hear from you help me to be out of the way to just step aside Lord that we can behold wonderful things and we thank you in Jesus precious name tonight we'll explore a bit more from that letter what it means and what it does not mean to be an imitator of Christ this works better Lyle if you turn it on yeah before we turn to Ephesians I'd like us first to turn to the book of beginnings Genesis it may seem like a strange introduction to a major theme of Ephesians but you're accustomed to that sort of thing by now from me right this is nobody's counting but this is the 80th time that I've stood behind her to talk to you for context God has created Abraham Adam excuse me and subsequently formed Eve they were a couple they're charged with filling and managing the Earth they're living in the Garden of Eden they have fellowship with God they are directly his creation his children made in His image Even Adam they're not always at the same place at the same time Satan seizes this opportunity when they're not together to communicate with Eve and to try to interfere with the plans of his arch enemy Yahweh he speaks to a creature known as the serpent the Serpent's not yet a reptilian snake the serpent is a what we think of as a hominid at this time a human-like creature capable of intelligent thought genetically very similar to humans think of Neanderthals to to get an idea of this sort of relationship I'm not claiming neanderthals were the creature called The Serpent I'm just using them to illustrate when you think of this person this this creature communicating with Eve it wasn't a snake hissing through a tree it's quite possible that Adam and Eve had conversations with this class of creature in the past Adam named him so Eve isn't shocked that this particular individual is able to communicate or even carry on a conversation Genesis 3 1 tells us the creature was subtle and the King James English and this means it was crafty it was shrewd it was cunning The Serpent and Eva are talking about God's admonition to not partake of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that's in the midst of the garden he says she's not to eat or even touch it or she would die let's pick up their interaction in chapter 3 verses 4 and 5. and and the serpent said and now we know of course it was Satan it entered into the creature referred to as a serpent he's speaking through the serpent and he said unto the woman unto Eve no you won't you shall not surely die that was Lie number one and he goes on to explain why he's making this statement God knows that in the day you eat thereof then rather than death eyes will be oh this is true based on verse 7 the eyes of them both are open he was appealing to vanity he was appealing to curiosity letting her in on what appeared to be a secret and you shall be as gods and the Hebrew it says you will become Elohim that's the same word that's translated Lord that was Lie number two knowing Good and Evil God called the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil in Genesis 2 17. so this assertion rang true so it's mixing things that are true things that sound true and contradicting the truth all in the same general appeal please be seated let's take a closer look at what we just read the first lie ye shall not surely die we see that Satan was disarming a defense that the Lord had put up to protect Humanity let's look at Genesis 2 verses 15 to 18 to get the context of this warning from God the Lord God took the man which he had created in His image and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it Man was created to work not relax Ed Sly and the Lord God suggested hinted he commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat and we assume this includes the tree of life because he says in the very next verse but of the tree of knowledge the sole exception the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die not I'll kill you but you'll die and the Lord God said it's not good that the man should be alone I'll make him and help meet for him a suitable companion to help him we see that God told Adam to avoid the tree of knowledge of good and evil before Eve was created before Eve was taken from the man God said don't do this there's a penalty that penalty's death you'll be committing suicide if you disobey so and Eve's conversation with the serpent she's repeating what her husband told her God had said now maybe it's some subsequent time God spoke to even told her the same thing we don't know there's no record of that oh that was your husband that told you that so the serpent said listen to me there's no penalty God's not protecting you he's trying to protect himself from you he's trying to use you keep you under his thumb he didn't argue that God had not really said to not eat the fruit he argued about why God had put this restriction in place he denied that there'd be a bad result the stated consequence was just a smoke screen for God to protect the secret of his own power from the humans hey maybe Adam was misquitting the warning it's just hearsay right he went on to appeal to her Pride her intellectual curiosity and the day you partake of the Forbidden thing not only will you not die rather your eyes will be opened your husband's out doing gardening you're here having a conversation about the things of God Adam will love you even more trust me on this I know here when I was a senior in high school in one of our classes we had a discussion about the Bible and religion one member of the class was an atheist he summed up and updated the Serpent's argument when he got up and said no no God didn't make Man In His Image man made God In His Image many people believe this today and in many cases it's true people make their own Gods Satan couldn't make that statement to Eve she along with Adam had fellowship with God and the cool of the evening she knew by experience that God was real and powerful and kind and loving she knew that but the appeal of the Serpent's argument you'll be just like him he'll be equal to him was enough to persuade Eve faced with her disobedient act Adam loved her enough to follow suit you shall be his gods Divine beings this is literally the oldest Temptation in the book well let's move on to Ephesians chapter 4 that's what we left off last time but this time we'll start at verse 20. Paul has appealed to his readers to be kind to be thoughtful and so forth he's decried the wicked nature of man giving examples of common Behavior among the Pagan practices that his readers once followed and he's and he says but ye have not so learned Christ to do these carnal things is not the lessons you learned from the anointed one from the Messiah if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him if you've paid attention to what you've been instructed by and about him as the truth is in Jesus that she put off remove step out of concerning the former conversation the former way of life the old man the old sinful nature which is corrupt the word there's actually rotten according to the deceitful lusts the deceptive desires the way the serpent appealed to Eve Paul goes on be renewed in the spirit of your mind made new in your thoughts and attitudes and that she put on clothe yourselves with step into the new man The Godly nature which after God which like God is created in righteousness and true holiness let's look at that verse 24 and uh and the NIV and in the Amplified Bible and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness put on the new nature the regenerated self created in God's image god-like and true righteousness and holiness to all three translations tell us it by putting on the new man being dead to self we are to become god-like in His image so was the Serpent's appeal wrong are we to become as gods well we're created in the image of god let's look at some some commonalities of these two Natures of God's nature in man's nature we're created in His image we have similarities like like God we're spiritual we have potentially Everlasting Souls we see this in both the Old and New Testament in the Bible let's look at Daniel 12 for example Daniel says and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake some to everlasting life some to shame an everlasting contempt we see that a portion of humanity will have eternal life and therefore they already have it if it's Eternal that's why I said we are potentially like God in this regard sadly not everyone will receive this benefit of faith Jesus said in John 5 verily verily I say unto you he that hears my word and believes on him that sent me has present tense already has everlasting life and shall not come into it speaking of the future and not come into condemnation but is present tense is already passed from Death where he once was unto life which he now possesses so here Jesus is clarifying who they are that will have life Everlasting those that believe in God through Christ thus if we're in Christ we possess life Everlasting eternal life the life of the life in God now today tomorrow ever life a second characteristic we share with God we have Minds we think and we reason again from both old and new and Isaiah 1 God is making a case against the wickedness of Judah but he holds out hope to the surviving Remnant we read in verse 17 learn to do well judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless for the Widow come now and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be a Scarlet they'll be white as snow though there'd be red like Crimson they shall be as wool to reason together is to discuss to share to learn we see God's willing to meet with us on this level to reason with us to answer our questions and there's a benefit to us if we do this in Philippians chapter 2 Paul tells us let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought of not robbery to be equal with God because we know he was God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made and the likeness of men Paul's not saying we should exalt ourselves to be equal with God we know Jesus was God himself veiled in human flesh rather Paul's saying if we have the mind of Christ will humble ourselves and serve one another in our day we're taught the greatest battle we'll fight will be the internal struggle right here within our mind faith that Sixth Sense fighting with what we experience in the physical world through our five natural senses filtered through our internal processes of Reason emotion imagination and so forth Eve's battle submitting to God's Authority versus becoming independent of that Authority continuing our short list we saw the potential of eternal life of a mind that can reason moving on a third attribute that we share with the Divine is that we're relational we give and receive love from the Old Testament let's look first at examples of God's love to his people from David we read in Psalm 36 verse 7. how excellent is thy loving kindness oh God therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings we see the love of God coupled with his kindness and our response to that combination is Trust faith in Jeremiah 31 we read verse 2. thus saith the Lord the people which were left of the sword found Grace in the wilderness even Israel when I went to cause him to rest the Lord hath appeared of old to me saying yay I have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee at the period of old in other words this is a consistently displayed attribute of God towards his people and In this passage we see that his love to us is Everlasting it's an ending we can depend on it being there always it's not fickle it's not of the moment similarly the people's love towards God this time from Moses the basic tenet of Judaism it's called the Shema in Hebrew it's an imperative it's a command it says listen give ear understand pay attention here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and her most being with all thy Soul the nephesh the life and with all thy might vehemently notice something here the first verse the command to Israel the nation collectively is to pay attention recognize the Lord our God is one our God recognition of him as a nation and as a people but the next verse is to each individual in that nation in our case each member of the body of Christ that group of the chosen that called out and and and the King James English Dakota Jacobian prose the language of the court of James 400 years ago the word you or ye is a plural it's a second person plural but thee thy thine is the second person singular so while the nation is collectively called on to recognize the Oneness the unity of God himself each individual is called on to love the Lord with the heart soul and strength Jesus quoted this in in Mark 12 we read in verse 28 one of the scribes came in Matthew 27 we understand he was a lawyer so okay brother Peter lawyers are good people and having heard them Jesus in a group of Sadducees reasoning together and perceiving that Jesus had answered them well he asked Jesus which is the first commandment of all which is the top which is the most important and Jesus answered him with that fundamental tenet of Judaism with the Shema he said the first of all the Commandments is here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and it continues Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and he adds with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment Jesus added with all thy mind as he was conversing with the Scribe who echoeded back to him and said yes Lord with all the understanding so this isn't just rote memorization oh I've got to recite Deuteronomy 6 4 5. no no it's not memorization or words to recite it it's not like children in a classroom that that might stand as they're very little and don't really understand what they're saying and put their hand over their heart and say I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all teacher it's recess time can we go out and play no no but it's like those of us who have served in the military making a pledge and putting our lives on the line our bodies In Harm's Way to defend and protect the nation our homes and families our values with understanding of the potential cost with all my mind means to understand to grasp and to mean it to truly and completely love the Lord now I'm sure it's clear to each of us our love towards God isn't some arbitrary burden you better love me or else it's a correct response to his love for us the command in Deuteronomy was issued after God through Moses had rescued the nation from slavery bondage in Egypt he destroyed Pharaoh's Army Before Their Eyes Moses lift up your stick and destroy the army of the superpower he provided he guided them supernaturally through a lifeless Wilderness if you've ever seen a place like the Sinai they're nothing there but gray rock there's not even dead things providing food when there was no food water in the New Testament we have many examples of Love relating to God and to each other here's a very familiar section of the Gospel of John Jesus is communing with Nicodemus one evening a Pharisee from the Sanhedrin notice that these aren't the words of John the narrator the words of Jesus they're in red letters Jesus is telling Nicodemus for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son to the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved now this is how John has recorded these words for us I think in context with Nicodemus it might have gone a little bit like this Nicodemus take it deepest God loves you so much he prepared and sent me so you could have faith in him through me and my friend by that Faith you won't be destroyed indeed you'll possess life eternal Nicodemus God didn't send me to condemn you sent me to save you I wonder how Nicodemus looked back on that evening a one-on-one session with the very Messiah God and flesh we have the responsive love of his people back towards God again Jesus speaking to his disciples in John 13 verse 34 he says a new commandment I give you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another we look at this sometimes and say I wonder what he's really saying here loving each other isn't a new commandment love your neighbors yourself what's he what's new what's new is the degree as I have loved you you must love each this kind of love is the testimony to the world around you that your followers of me well let's see it in the Old Testament a familiar passage from Leviticus 19 Verse 18 Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor is thyself I'm the Lord that's telling you this we're very familiar with this verse as it applies with the nation of the chosen bearing the grudge against the children of your people but a few verses later verses we don't often read it's expanded it's emphasized it becomes the basis for what we call the Golden Rule treat others as you wish to be treated it's not a pair of verses we often hear a reference but Leviticus 19 verses 33 and 34. if a stranger not one of your own not one of Jacob's descendants a gentile sojourn with thee in your land you shall not Vex him you shall not oppress him don't give the home of this guy on the street corner a hard time but the stranger that dwelleth with you dicks around makes us home among you shall be unto you as one born among you and thou shalt love him as myself there's not one set of laws for the citizens in a different set of laws for people that aren't citizens which was quite A New Concept at that time but the same laws and attitudes are to apply to everyone and he tells them why For You Were Strangers in the land of Egypt remember how you were Outsiders mistreated pressed into slavery remember this don't treat others as you were treated but treat them as you wish to be treated and remember who is it this telling you to do this I am the Lord your God Jesus said as much to that scribe that we read about in Mark 12 go back to verse 30 when he's replying he says Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment but Jesus went on he said the second is light the second is similar the second is the same in effect it's namely this Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor as thyself there's none other commandment greater than these and Matthew's account in chapter 27 he has in verse 40. um these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets and we know later when Jesus was asked well love your neighbor so who's my neighbor Jesus tells the parable of the Good Samaritan remember Samaritans were living under segregation they had nothing to do with the Jewish people and the Jewish people had nothing to do with them the woman at Jacob's Well challenged Jesus about this when he simply asked for a drink of water and she was not only a Samaritan but was an outcast among the Samaritans life intelligence relationship let's look at a fourth the last characteristic we'll look at or moral able to discern right from wrong an example of this is found in Solomon's Prayer to the Lord when he became king over Israel First Kings 3 verse 7. Solomon's praying he says and now oh Lord my God thou has made thy servant in other words he's talking about himself King instead of David my father in the place of my father but God I am but a little child I don't even know how to go out or come in Solomon's humbling himself he's the king he's humbling himself before God he said and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered or counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad for who's able to judge this thy so greater people this is a heavy response responsibility lord I can't do it enable me to carry it the way that only you can enable and we read the speech please the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing Solomon desired to rightly judge when judgment was required his prayer indicates that such discernment between right and wrong was possible that it was an attribute of God that God could bestow strengthened and Rich we know the result Solomon's wisdom his ability to judge and discern was unmatched in the ancient world in the New Testament example Paul wrote to the Hebrews now in this case he's scolding them for their lack of spiritual growth Hebrews 5 12. for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness he's a babe who's talking about nursing here they didn't have dairies and milk bottles and all the rest of that but strong meat belonged to them that are of full age mature even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil Paul indicates this sort of discernment comes with exercise I I don't know how many of you exercise regularly I don't know how many of you don't but uh but but I know that uh sometimes when you do that you make a mistake you slip you fall you pull a muscle you you dislocate something so if we're exercising in order to develop this discernment we're going to make mistakes which is yet another reason that we should be kind and forgiving to each other as we grow in Grace and Truth so let's take a look at these we have just some shared attributes that we sort of picked here that spiritual Everlasting Souls intellectual ability to think and reason relational we can give and receive love moral discern right from wrong we see we have attributes in the human character that mirror or at least resemble attributes of the Divine we were after all created in His image so we're back to the question was the statement made to even the garden correct are we to become gods I think there's a huge difference between the appeal of the serpent and the assertion of Paul once again from Ephesians 4 from the NIV to put on the new self created to be like God and true righteousness and holiness this verse tells us to be god-like and righteousness and holiness Paul's telling us to put on the new man is saying that we're to take on God's nature by submitting to his authority the enemy of our souls tempts us to take on God's Authority by rebelling against his nature complete opposites let me repeat that Paul in telling us to put on the new man is saying we're to take on God's nature by submitting to his authority Satan tempts us to take on to replace God's Authority in our lives by rebelling against his nature we're not called to be a God we are called to be Godly there's a huge difference David tells us in this Psalm Psalm 4 3 we know that the Lord has set apart chosen selected him that is Godly for what for himself therefore David says the Lord will hear when I call unto him Paul tells Titus in verse 2 I'm sorry chapter 2 verse 11. for the grace of God that bringeth salvation has appeared to all men that denying ungodliness and worldly lust taking off the old man we should live soberly righteously and godly that word means piously devoutly reverently in this present world here again we see we are to fight that portion of our nature which is ungodly Wicked not god-like that we should live a Godly life a life that reflects as brother Aaron told us this morning I know the sun somewhere because I See the Light reflecting off the moon we're to have a life that reflects the nature of God we sometimes sing a worship song to be like Jesus this is not claiming that we want to replace Jesus to become God and rule the universe That's what Satan wants to do it's saying we want to take it on Jesus nature to reflect his attributes in our lives Paul talks about this in Ephesians 5. he says be therefore followers other translations say imitators of God copy him follow his example is dear children imitate their father I'm sure that Asher imitates Amos quite a lot and walk in live a life filled with love as in the way that Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for us so that it became a sweet smelling Savor of fragrance were to be imitators but not imitations allow me to explain an imitator is one who studies and mirrors someone else a disciple if you will we should mirror we should reflect Christ for example when I bake bread I try to imitate the work of the master Baker whose instructions I try to follow so my product will be as good as it can be I don't claim to be a good Baker of bread but I try to imitate someone who is I try to understand his methods and follow his lead I try to imitate not replace him we should be an imitator of Jesus but we are not to be imitation Jesus's an imitation to something artificial or fake an imposter 30 years ago I frequently traveled to Japan as part of my work while there I often need to go to a restaurant and the typical restaurants of Japan in the 1990s the windows face industry would have displays of delicious looking foods yum but they weren't Foods they were made of plastic they looked real but they lacked that sweet smelling saver they had no nutrition probably toxic imitation fake and no I never tried to taste one either the menus were often laminated with colorful pictures of various Foods nothing written in English to order I'd point to the picture that represented the food I wanted perhaps tempura or sushi no no tempura I wasn't indicating that I wanted to eat a photo of tempura nor did I want the plastic tempura that was in the window I wanted a real meal of what that image represented just as we should represent Christ not that anyone would want to be like me but that they would want to follow the Christ they see represented in me I'm just the picture in the menu illustrating Christ not the plastic display in the window pretending to be him let me tell you a story on myself excuse me in February 1972 Heather and I traveled to New Zealand to attend the Willing wedding of Philip Searle that's Howard searle's next older brother you that know Howard that's been here Philip was marrying Margot Hill we spent several weeks in that beautiful country one time we were visiting with brother red Cyril that's Howard's dad a man that brother green called his pastor we were visiting with brother swirl in his home and he admonished me he said when you see a rose you want to step close to it okay inhale its fragrance but not all roses have a fragrance those that don't disappoint he said Heather's life had a fragrance but he looked at me and said brother Lyle yours has no perfume he was kindly but pointedly telling me that I was a poor example of a Christian if I was in that Japanese menu you should black out that picture he was right we had prayer together as I recall I pray things have improved in my life in that regard in the 50 years since that meeting that I have become an imitator and not an imitation uh I had more that I thought to share with you but I kept hitting a brick wall and I take that as the Lord telling me stop it's enough to digest and apply for one meeting so we'll close by reading a few more verses from Ephesians 5 if the musicians would kindly come he therefore followers of God as dear children walk in love as Christ hath also loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling Savor skipping down to verse 15. see then that you walk circumspectly examining things from all angles not as fools but is wise redeeming not wasting but profitably employing the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but in other words be wise understanding what the will of the Lord is be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit lose your self-control by being full of the Holy Spirit like those in the upper room on the day of Pentecost these are not full of new wine as you suppose but they were full of the spirit speaking to yourselves not bickering arguing accusing offending but speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks from time to time giving thanks always for the pleasant things for all things unto God and the father and the name of the church and the name of the prophet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ here's a huff tough one a hard one submitting yourselves to one another and the fear of reverence toward God and so brother Aaron comes to closest service to conclude let's sing to be like Jesus to be imitators of Christ with understanding [Music] to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth long to be like him all through life's journey from Earth to Glory I only I asked to be like him to be like Jesus to be like to be like him all through life's journey from Earth to Glory I only hear to be life you'll stand with me let's sing it as a prayer to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I long to be like [Music] all through life's journey from Earth [Music] to be like him God bailed himself in flesh and he walked on this Earth and he gave [Music] that body that wanted himself the same responsibility that he gave that gives us I believe to show us that it can be done you know sometimes in the Scripture it shows where Jesus got angry [Music] he chased him out of the temple with a with a rope and and there were times that he got angry or got upset with his disciples because he wore flesh so he could understand that but in the greatest decision that ever came that he had to make was not my will but thy will be done and we see in the scriptures we read in the scriptures and and even more than reading in the scriptures we see in a life that is lived what the scriptures mean what they should be everybody that has read the scriptures now for many years since they've been written and how many different groups and organizations and and beliefs have come out of it but if you take him the spirit of Christ in you and you say mold me make me more like you he will always take you back to his word because that's what he gave us to to to listen to to hear and all and never once did he think you couldn't do it he said all that the father has given me will come I will not lose a one of them he's already seen you there how many knows that he has seen you how many knows he has called you you have to know that for yourself no matter what your age is and what you're part of him and he has already seen you and today he's just going over the lesson one more time saying this these are my children let's just yield to that Lord [Music] the the best teachers maybe we ever had in school or in a training program or going through a work program were those not only those who just spoke and pointed to a book but those who would take the time to share with you their experiences how they learned take the work take the whatever is going to be and let you get Hands-On and work with it Lord and that's what you've done for us Lord you've you've invited us to come and share this very life these very experiences to grow to be more like you Lord we're not just plug-in robots Lord that are programmed to do something Lord but rather it's it's us willing to submit and say Lord make me more like you Lord it's your desire Lord and let it be our desire Lord to be that which you want us to be Lord in Jesus Christ's name with the love that he has that is perfect that is real that is true what a wonderful thing oh love of God how rich and pure foreign [Music] [Applause] it will just beyond the highest foreign [Music] [Applause] bow down with kids God gave his son [Music] to win foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] were every song on Earth the queen and every man ascribe by truth to write the love of God above [Music] nor could the scroll [Music] contain the home go stretched from Skies to [Music] hold the love of God how rich and pure how measure lands [Music] and strong it shall foreign [Music] Joe song how many would say Lord I want more of that love I want less of me and more of you how many are willing then to be put to the test and not just be a display but rather the product that God wants say Lord that's what I want can we sing that song blessed be the tide of mine [Music] hearts and Christian love it's the very it's a very love of God that binds us together that ties us [Music] love before our father's Throne we pour our Lord and prayers our fears our aims are one our Comforts and our care [Music] we share our mutual world our mutual burden's bear and often fall for each other flow the sympathizing tears [Music] and gives us but we shall still be joined in her and hope to me the first verse one more time our house in Christian love The Fellowship of Kindred my his life to them above something did I do when I pray for all of you most of you always sit in a similar place and I can usually go and I just can go down the benches because a lot of you sit in the same places and I'll Call Your Name by bench that's about the easiest way to remember is I don't have a list of everybody's name but I say sister Shirley Moore is sitting there when brother Eddie's usually there and the musicians are usually here and but the Jeremy and sister Angela are you sitting there and just go down the line and I said Lord be with him today Lord watch over them today and then I remember those that are widows and those that have lost loved ones and just go down and sometimes I get a long drive from one work spot to another and I'll use that time to pray I'll keep my eyes open when I pray just for the safety of everybody else but it's just something that we do because we are part of the family of God and God's family is bound together in that love and that bless that blessed man and I appreciate that God bless each one of you God go with you this week and you go with God this week as my prayer amen Wednesday night I haven't talked to brother Dan Evans but if he's able I would like brother Dan Evans to minister on Wednesday night the next Sunday morning brother Matt walked consistently in town for Sunday morning and then Lord willing brother Israel has invited us and has made us welcome for Sunday evening service if you're able to go so love one another and when we say make me more like you Jesus make me more like you remember he's work on us blessed be the time that binds the first verse [Music] I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God as you go tonight part of the family of God I'm so glad I'm a I'm apart of the family of God Plans by his blood join us with Jesus as we travel this arms for I'm part of the fan the family of God I'm so glad I'm apart of the family of God I've been washed in the fountain cleansed by his blood join us with Jesus as we travel
