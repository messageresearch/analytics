[14:26] turned in this morning but was after and
[14:29] so we didn't see it and they didn't sign

[14:34] weeks ago I had some blood work done
[14:38] last Tuesday says last Tuesday I got the
[14:40] results my A1C was down from 7 to
[14:44] 6.9 my cholesterol was high and I'll try
[14:47] to get it more healthy thank you for
[14:50] your prayers for
[14:52] everything you know God is more than
[14:55] able God is more than able yeah and we
[14:59] appreciate that his goodness to us a
[15:00] little update on
[15:02] mom mom and dad cuz it's hard on Dad too
[15:07] but you know if you've been around my
[15:10] mom my mom we moved here in 76 my mom
[15:15] was still driving but she didn't know
[15:18] Tucson very well she was getting nervous
[15:21] about her eyesight she stopped driving
[15:23] and eventually she couldn't see well
[15:26] enough to drive so it's been about 46 47
[15:29] years ago that she stopped
[15:31] driving and you know but she but if you
[15:33] watched her and every and a lot of
[15:35] people didn't know she was blind cuz she
[15:36] didn't act like it around the house she
[15:39] still cooked she wanted to know if the
[15:42] water was hot enough she stuck her
[15:43] finger in it that's how she knew it was
[15:46] hot enough she did her own laundry she's
[15:48] done everything she's been able to do
[15:50] that so she had gone into the room on
[15:53] Wednesday and there's she steep into the
[15:55] in her bedroom there's a chest of
[15:57] drawers here a chest of drawers in the
[15:58] bed and she fell right between the three
[16:01] of them without touching any of
[16:04] those and Dad couldn't pick her up so he
[16:07] called me to call 911 to get some help
[16:11] over and they they didn't take long to
[16:13] get there and they took her into the
[16:16] hospital and that's when she was x-rayed
[16:18] and they found that her hip had been
[16:20] fractured but a a a clean
[16:23] break and it wasn't shattered or broken
[16:26] apart and you know when we were there at
[16:29] the hospital I asked Mom I said I don't
[16:32] remember you being in the hospital ever
[16:34] for having to have some type of
[16:37] surgery I said when was the last time
[16:40] you were in the hospital and she thought
[16:41] for a moment she said when your brother
[16:43] was born 64 years ago was the last time
[16:46] I had to be in the hospital to have some
[16:47] surgery done so God's been good to Mom
[16:50] and
[16:51] Dad and uh they weren't able to move her
[16:54] over to rehab because the internet at
[16:56] the rehab place went down so they
[16:58] couldn't make the con connections but
[17:01] she was able to get up and walk her a
[17:03] little bit and sit down and get up the
[17:05] day after
[17:07] surgery and so if if you had a chance to
[17:10] go see her she didn't want to have her
[17:13] hearing aid on so it wouldn't get lost
[17:15] and you would think that the nurses were
[17:17] mad at her because they were yelling at
[17:18] her the whole time cuz she can't hear
[17:21] without hearing anything so I had to
[17:24] remember that but you know I was hot
[17:27] talking about with my mom one day and I
[17:29] said H how did you know that God what
[17:32] was it she said I was in prayer as a
[17:34] young teenage girl and I was baptized in
[17:39] a ball of fire and those around her
[17:42] witnessed it and God gave her the Holy
[17:44] Ghost as a teenager and she has served
[17:47] God the rest of her
[17:48] life we we had Godly Parents who taught
[17:52] us to love the Lord to go to church uh
[17:56] to be a Christian and I thank God God
[17:58] for that today but you know Christians
[18:00] suffer too Christians have hard times
[18:04] but they have a God that watches over
[18:05] them and they lean on that promise so
[18:08] you know and and so he walks with us he

[39:27] amen and amen praise the Lord so you may
[39:30] be
[39:31] seated it's really a a a privileged to
[39:34] be here with you
[39:36] all and I counted a great
[39:39] highlight and um I just want to look at
[39:42] you for a few minutes look at your
[39:44] beautiful faces so really happy to see
[39:47] all the smiling faces amen somebody's
[39:49] happy to be a Christian praise the Lord
[39:52] amen you're happy about your religion
[39:54] you have a a lifegiving religion
[39:57] amen oh praise the Lord so I was happy
[40:00] to I was certainly happy to come in the
[40:02] back door see all the all the folks that
[40:04] were in the back there enthusiastic you
[40:07] know like I said happy nobody was sad or
[40:10] disappointed that they had to come to
[40:12] church out of maybe some kind of a Duty
[40:14] or so forth so uh so God bless you
[40:17] brother Dan so that's a a sign that the
[40:20] people are wellfed spiritually happy and
[40:23] uh spiritually healthy amen praise the
[40:26] Lord and so and so as brother Dan
[40:29] mentioned we uh just really kind of been
[40:31] getting to know each other over the last
[40:33] month or so and I think we shook hands
[40:35] or so maybe about a year or two ago and
[40:39] um here maybe like six or so months ago
[40:42] somebody asked if I knew brother Dan had
[40:45] a chance to talk with him yet and
[40:46] anyways trying to make a long story
[40:48] short um I just felt like it was the
[40:50] Lord kind of keep uh kept bringing
[40:52] bringing it up you know so in other
[40:54] words there was something there just
[40:55] wasn't human Compassion or it wasn't you
[40:58] know some human desire it was actually I
[41:01] can say from the bottom of the heart it
[41:03] was the Lord that brought us together
[41:06] and even just one of the more more uh uh
[41:08] just if you all allow me a few minutes
[41:10] here but one of the more recent events
[41:12] my daughter Eliana back there we um
[41:14] happened to just kind of at the last
[41:16] minute we got a craving for a particular
[41:20] restaurant and normally we go in and we
[41:22] eat at that restaurant and it was just
[41:24] her and I so we said well this just
[41:26] order out and we'll take uh take it back
[41:29] home to to to everybody and so we try to
[41:33] make a longer story short just to show
[41:34] you how in in all of our walks of life a
[41:36] mean God has ordained every footstep
[41:39] every every path and I believe the
[41:41] prophet of God even said even our
[41:43] mistakes he works out to our good in his
[41:47] glory amen so no matter what you do if
[41:50] you've made a mistake if if you've done
[41:52] this that or the other God has got it
[41:54] all under control amen that's the kind
[41:56] of God that we serve amen praise the
[41:58] Lord so there's nothing that we could
[42:00] say or do amen we do our best we're
[42:02] going to fall we're going to make
[42:03] mistakes but even in our mistakes just
[42:06] repent and move on don't worry about him
[42:09] because he already took care of them
[42:11] before the foundation of the world
[42:12] praise the Lord before the foundation of
[42:14] the world he PR he
[42:17] predestinated everything to work for
[42:20] your good praise the Lord even to your
[42:23] mistake so as we are going
[42:27] we ordered the food and of course they
[42:29] got the order kind of me mixed up we
[42:31] thought it was a mixed up but we said
[42:33] well praise the Lord something uh
[42:35] happens for a reason whatever so we were
[42:37] held up a little bit and they were of
[42:39] course scrambling back in the kitchen
[42:40] trying to hurry up to get our order
[42:42] prepared and so finally they come
[42:44] rushing to the front they give us our
[42:45] order we P we pay for it and as we're
[42:48] walking out of the restaurant a brother
[42:50] comes walking right by and he happened
[42:53] to be uh there with us this morning and
[42:55] we shake hand hands and and just out of
[42:58] the blue he says have you met brother
[42:59] Dan yet
[43:01] so so he began talking about just some
[43:04] some stuff that they were talking about
[43:05] and so on and so forth but amen so I
[43:08] counted a great privilege and we don't
[43:10] know what what God will do we know it's
[43:12] for a purpose and we just want to be
[43:14] obedient to him
[43:16] and and as I've gotten to know brother
[43:18] Dan over the past couple of month or
[43:20] past month or so we were kind of shocked
[43:23] about how much we have in common you
[43:25] know we I think we were married by the
[43:27] same Pastor went to the same same church
[43:30] for a while have some very similar
[43:33] background and uh we left the state of
[43:35] Arizona at the same time not knowing
[43:38] each other of course we moved back to
[43:40] the State of Arizona at the same time
[43:42] and uh we even comb our hair the same
[43:46] so praise the Lord but uh so amen so
[43:49] we're looking forward to just more more
[43:51] friendship you know we're all part of
[43:53] the family of God Amen brothers and
[43:55] sisters of like Precious faith and so um
[43:58] and so I'm certainly happy to be here I
[44:00] I really appreciate the offer the and
[44:03] the opportunity to be here I don't take
[44:05] it
[44:06] lightly and uh praise the Lord so we're
[44:09] all we're all unique amen not a single
[44:11] one of us can take the other person's
[44:13] place so you all bear with me if I get a
[44:15] little excited if I say Amen too much if
[44:18] I say hallelujah if I do whatever it is
[44:21] sometimes it's just bubbling over and we
[44:22] can't help it amen so you do the same
[44:25] praise the Lord amen so amen if it's
[44:27] bubbling over don't be don't be afraid
[44:29] you no uh uh you're perfectly in order
[44:32] amen when when when you're when you're
[44:34] praising the Lord is that right because
[44:36] the Bible says God inhabits the Praises
[44:38] of his people praise the Lord so I'm
[44:42] happy to have my wife and children here
[44:43] with us uh they're on the back row but
[44:46] they'll just keep the back row uh that
[44:47] much more on fire praise the
[44:50] Lord so praise the Lord amen so we'll um
[44:54] I believe that's it so we want to just
[44:56] greet uh brother Dan sister Stephanie
[44:58] and where's uh 2.0 brother Dan 2.0 is he
[45:04] he's
[45:05] busy okay all right so uh we'll try not
[45:10] to be too long again just my first time
[45:12] here so this this will just be uh maybe
[45:15] a reacquaintance we'll get to know one
[45:17] another and um we'll see what the Lord
[45:19] would do for us but I certainly
[45:21] appreciate being here tonight and let's
[45:23] uh let's go ahead and stand to our feet
[45:27] and we will take the scripture for 2
[45:30] Chronicles 2 Chronicles
[45:34] 29:27 can everybody hear me okay yes sir
[45:37] all right praise the
[45:42] Lord and so we'll just talk a little bit
[45:44] tonight we'll see how the Lord will lead
[45:47] us 2 Chronicles
[45:49] 29:27 and as I was telling brother Dan
[45:52] this has been a scripture that I believe
[45:53] the Lord quickened to me gave to me
[45:55] years and years years ago and it just
[45:57] really affected me in a very special way
[46:00] and so I thought you know someday I'll
[46:02] preach on that well that was
[46:04] approximately eight or so years ago and
[46:07] I never preached on it and just
[46:10] yesterday
[46:11] morning uh I was just thinking in my
[46:13] mind you know as ministers dude I had
[46:15] just ministered on something uh last
[46:17] week and then this morning and so I
[46:19] thought well I just kind of bring the
[46:21] same thing like uh no worries but then
[46:24] the just immediately when I went down to
[46:26] prayer yesterday morning real early the
[46:28] Holy Spirit brought this scripture back
[46:30] to me and I just kind of settled on it
[46:33] for a little bit and and then everything
[46:35] just kind of fell right into place so we
[46:36] just trust the Lord that it'll be a
[46:38] blessing to somebody this evening so
[46:40] this uh this is uh um our first time
[46:44] going into this so 2 Chronicles 29: 27
[46:48] and then we'll also turn to Revelations
[46:50] 5 and then Romans 12 so just three short
[46:53] readings 2 Chronicles 29 and
[46:57] 27 and the word of the Lord
[46:59] says and
[47:02] Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt
[47:05] offering upon the
[47:08] Altar and when the burnt offering
[47:11] began the song of the Lord began also
[47:15] with the trumpets and with the
[47:18] instruments ordained by David king of
[47:22] Israel so let's go to the New Testament
[47:25] Revelations
[47:29] 5 and when the burnt offering began the
[47:33] song of the Lord
[47:37] began praise the
[47:40] Lord Revelations 5 verse5 we'll try to
[47:44] bring this present tense if the Lord
[47:45] will help us tonight amen because we
[47:47] don't serve a historical God we serve a
[47:49] present tense
[47:50] God Revelations 5 verse5 this should be
[47:53] a very familiar scripture
[47:56] and when one of the
[47:58] elders saith unto
[48:01] me weep not behold in other words
[48:06] look amen he was weeping but there he
[48:09] needed his attention to be turned Behold
[48:12] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[48:15] and uh the root of David hath prevailed
[48:19] to open the book and to loose the seals
[48:22] thereof amen and I behold and lo in the
[48:25] midst of the
[48:27] throne and of the midst of the Beast and
[48:30] in the midst of the elders stood a
[48:33] lamb as it had been slain amen a
[48:36] bleeding bloody lamb amen as it had been
[48:40] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[48:43] which are the seven spirits of which are
[48:44] the seven spirits of God sent forth into
[48:46] all the Earth and he came and took the
[48:49] book out of the right hand of him that
[48:51] sat upon the throne and when he had
[48:53] taken the book The Four beasts and 4 and
[48:56] 20 Elders fell down before the lamb
[48:59] having every one of them Harps and
[49:02] golden vials full of oders which are the
[49:06] prayers of saints and they sang verse n
[49:09] and they sung a new song saying Thou Art
[49:14] Worthy to take the book and to open the
[49:17] seals thereof for thou was slain and ha
[49:19] redeemed us amen do you see yourself in
[49:22] the vision tonight praise the Lord and
[49:24] they and has
[49:26] redeemed
[49:28] us un to God by thy blood out of every
[49:33] Kindred and tongue and people and Nation
[49:36] praise the Lord let's turn to Romans uh
[49:38] verse 12 for the last reading but you
[49:41] know we sing that song many of times I'm
[49:42] so glad I can say that I'm one of
[49:48] them and that's because we are we are we
[49:50] feel that we're identified in the
[49:53] scripture so Romans 12: vers one and
[49:56] brother Dan said this was his favorite
[49:57] scripture so here we are
[50:00] amen Romans
[50:03] 12:1 I beseech you therefore
[50:07] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[50:10] present your bodies a Living
[50:13] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[50:18] is your reasonable service and be not
[50:21] conformed to this world but be ye trans
[50:25] formed by the renewing of your mind that
[50:28] you may
[50:29] prove what is that good and acceptable
[50:32] and perfect will of God Amen may the
[50:34] Lord add His blessings to the reading of
[50:36] his word you may be
[50:39] seated and so the scripture says we be
[50:41] not
[50:42] conformed to the world but be ye
[50:45] transformed how so by the renewing of
[50:49] your mind
[50:50] amen and as that scripture that we just
[50:53] read in the Book of Revelations and they
[50:56] sang a new song unto the Lord saying
[50:59] Thou Art Worthy for thou Hast redeemed
[51:02] us and so we we we sing that song I'm so
[51:06] glad I can say I'm one of them and many
[51:08] times we're pointing backwards we're
[51:10] saying I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[51:12] them one of them that was in the upper
[51:14] room I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[51:16] them but tonight let's change our Focus
[51:19] to a present tense Vision amen the lamb
[51:24] coming into your Vision into our vision
[51:27] and oh praise God and as the offering
[51:31] amen comes forth May the song of the
[51:33] Lord come forth amen and they sang a new
[51:37] song saying Thou Art Worthy in for thou
[51:41] Hast redeemed us oh are you part of them
[51:45] tonight are you can you say I'm one of
[51:47] them Hallelujah I'm one of them that has
[51:50] been a partaker of this
[51:53] Redemption oh my praise God and so for a
[51:57] little title tonight it might sound a
[52:00] little strange but for a title the open
[52:03] vision of your burnt
[52:06] offering and so when we speak of burnt
[52:09] offering of course we know that's in the
[52:10] Old Testament and we know that was one
[52:12] of the main sacrificial offerings that
[52:14] they had to offer as a part of their
[52:16] worship they had to present the the
[52:18] burnt offering before they could enter
[52:20] into the congregation of Israel amen and
[52:23] so we know that the reason why I said
[52:26] your burnt offering because it's
[52:28] personal tonight you must be identified
[52:31] with it it's it's not so much you know
[52:35] your neighbor burnt offering or your
[52:36] neighbor sacrifice we know that the Lord
[52:39] Jesus Christ died upon the cross for all
[52:41] the sins of the world but until you
[52:43] accept it it's not going to do you any
[52:46] good you might sympathize with it you
[52:49] might have compassion on it maybe the
[52:51] Lord has been calling you but until you
[52:54] take that next step
[52:55] it's not your sacrifice it's not your
[52:58] offering you're not identified with it
[53:01] amen and so it's personal to you tonight
[53:06] so may this be an open vision of your
[53:10] sacrifice of your
[53:12] identification of where you fit in the
[53:15] program of God because one of the things
[53:18] I share with brother Dan is I I'm
[53:20] focusing on perfect Faith that's my aim
[53:23] that's my goal I believe that should be
[53:25] all of our goals as Christians in this
[53:26] hour amen the faith that's required for
[53:30] this hour and perfect faith is
[53:32] recognizing your place in the scripture
[53:36] perfect faith is recognizing the word of
[53:39] God that has been spoken concerning you
[53:42] amen he knew you before the foundation
[53:45] of the world how many can testify of
[53:47] that he knew you hujjah he knew you he
[53:52] was just you were just as much a part of
[53:55] him
[53:55] him as as as as anything else as he was
[53:59] a part of himself if I can say it like
[54:00] that and man just think before you were
[54:04] born and given your Earthly
[54:07] name of Josiah or whatever it is brother
[54:11] Aaron before you were born where were
[54:14] you before your natural life was
[54:18] born you were your DNA could be traced
[54:22] back to your father is that right so
[54:25] your DNA your human makeup your human
[54:28] genetics that makes you up was already
[54:31] in existence before you were born it
[54:35] just took the betting ground of your
[54:37] mother and your father to come together
[54:39] to bring that DNA strand together that
[54:42] makes you who you are amen but that
[54:45] person I got news for you as much as you
[54:47] love that person that person must die
[54:50] that person must die that person must
[54:52] become a Perpetual offering is is that
[54:55] right you must you must crucify to
[54:58] yourself amen that person must
[55:01] die and so just in the in the spiritual
[55:04] just as you were in existence as far as
[55:07] your DNA and your human makeup goes you
[55:10] were in existence in the spiritual your
[55:13] eternal life before the foundation of
[55:15] the world so whether you realize it
[55:18] tonight or not there was an eternal part
[55:20] of you that always was and always is and
[55:27] always will
[55:29] be that's the person that I am
[55:33] interested in amen this person right
[55:35] here has given me plenty of trouble but
[55:38] I want to crucify this guy and find out
[55:40] where that other person is that person
[55:43] that God thought of from before the
[55:44] foundation of the world he had a picture
[55:48] of you he knew you intimately amen you
[55:51] were a part of him in his very thinking
[55:53] and his very loins and sometimes when we
[55:56] when we when we when we try to uh you
[55:58] know uh think of that you know we were
[56:01] in his thinking sometimes we think oh as
[56:03] some kind of a secondary thought or some
[56:05] kind of an abstract thought but you are
[56:07] just as much a part of him in his DNA if
[56:11] we can say it like that as you were in
[56:13] your father he knew you he had an
[56:16] intimate knowledge of you and he's seen
[56:20] you already glorified he's seen you in
[56:24] this condition
[56:25] so so it doesn't really matter what goes
[56:28] on down here he's bringing you to this
[56:30] condition praise the
[56:32] Lord oh
[56:35] my and so uh when we speak of an open
[56:38] Vision we know that the word of God is a
[56:41] vision is that right God gives Gave To
[56:45] His prophets and his Apostles and so
[56:46] forth visions and those Visions became
[56:50] the word of
[56:52] God am amen and and if we were to go
[56:56] just help me as as we go through this
[56:57] for a few more
[56:59] minutes but if we were to go back to 1st
[57:02] Samuel chapter 3:1 you don't have to
[57:04] turn to it but I'll just quote it the
[57:06] Bible says and the word of the Lord was
[57:08] precious in those days for there was no
[57:12] open
[57:13] Vision so there they were the the people
[57:16] of God called of God circumcised on the
[57:19] Eighth Day identified as the chosen holy
[57:23] people of God are
[57:25] uh uh have escaped the damnation of the
[57:27] world have escaped Egypt and come into
[57:30] the promised land they had the word of
[57:33] their Prophet they had the word of the
[57:36] Lord but there was no open
[57:40] Vision can you imagine that as
[57:42] Christians as as church members you know
[57:45] we go to church we have the Bible we we
[57:47] have our experiences and and sometimes
[57:49] it just seems as if we're drifting from
[57:52] church service to church service
[57:55] uh we're drifting maybe from from maybe
[57:58] the Lord will give us a victory but we
[58:00] we drift from that Victory from into
[58:02] another Victory and it just seems like
[58:04] it's still too much of an an up and down
[58:07] and in and out how many has been there
[58:09] before am I am I the only one praise the
[58:12] Lord but anyway can you imagine a
[58:15] Christian experience a Christian Life
[58:17] without an open
[58:19] vision and so they had that's how the
[58:21] children of Israel were they had the
[58:23] word of the Lord they had the Bible as
[58:25] it were to them they had the words of
[58:28] their Prophet amen they but it was just
[58:31] it might as well have just been ink on a
[58:34] paper it was literally etched on a stone
[58:36] it had not come to fruition it had not
[58:39] come uh to life in the sense of of
[58:41] coming up before them and be made and
[58:44] being made manifest so they can
[58:46] recognize the hour that they are
[58:48] in and so they had the word of the Lord
[58:51] but they they were drifting from defeat
[58:53] from to defeat from Victory to Victory
[58:56] up and down in and out and so there was
[58:58] no open Vision in those days and so
[59:02] we'll get into it in a minute and
[59:04] explain what an open vision
[59:09] is and so if we take the Amplified for
[59:12] that it basically says there was no
[59:13] vision that was proclaimed or
[59:16] declared as the expression of God's will
[59:20] so they had the the word as it were but
[59:23] they didn't they they the word had not
[59:24] been put together in a way to where they
[59:27] could understand the present tense will
[59:29] of God for their life maybe they drifted
[59:32] in into maybe it was a legalistic affair
[59:35] they knew the law they kept the
[59:37] Commandments they did all these things
[59:38] but they were still in a defeated
[59:41] condition they were still Bound by the
[59:44] things of the world they were still
[59:45] drugg into temptation and so on and so
[59:48] forth because there was no open Vision
[59:51] amen and we know the Bible says that
[59:53] where there is no vision the people will
[59:55] fail I'll read that in a minute but
[59:57] there was no without an open Vision they
[59:59] had no real purpose they had the law
[1:00:02] they had the Commandments they they had
[1:00:04] their land but yet there was still no
[1:00:07] real purpose for their life because
[1:00:10] that's what the word of God does and it
[1:00:12] brings to you a
[1:00:14] vision a vision of the will of God for
[1:00:19] your life amen because we have the word
[1:00:21] of God and we have the will of God and
[1:00:24] and the word of God for today becomes
[1:00:27] the will of God when it's revealed to
[1:00:29] you amen we have the word of God for
[1:00:32] Noah but today to go build an ark that's
[1:00:35] not the will of God Amen that's not the
[1:00:37] will of God but in the Noah's day that
[1:00:40] word that that was spoken to him became
[1:00:44] an open Vision it became a vision that
[1:00:47] he was walking in he was talking in he
[1:00:50] was he was he was manifesting that word
[1:00:54] and that was the will of God for his
[1:00:57] life so God is very
[1:01:00] specific he he he brought to Noah the
[1:01:03] word for that hour amen and that word of
[1:01:06] course was to build an ark but he gave
[1:01:09] him Specific Instructions what kind of
[1:01:12] pitch to use what kind of wood to use
[1:01:14] what kind of what kind of what kind of
[1:01:16] grain uh to to use perhaps to sand the
[1:01:18] wood down all of these minute
[1:01:21] instructions was the word of God Noah
[1:01:25] word upon word precept upon precept and
[1:01:29] that word just didn't if Noah just left
[1:01:31] that word there it would not do any good
[1:01:34] to them it would not serve the purpose
[1:01:36] amen but Noah by faith the Bible says by
[1:01:41] faith he moved with fear and prepared an
[1:01:44] ark for the saving of his household so
[1:01:47] the Bible says that without faith it is
[1:01:49] impossible to please God and so we must
[1:01:52] walk and act in everything we do must be
[1:01:55] by faith and it's impossible to live and
[1:01:58] and to worship by faith without a
[1:02:01] revelation of the will of God for your
[1:02:03] life because that's what the will of God
[1:02:05] brings is it brings to you faith and so
[1:02:09] now you know your purpose now you know
[1:02:11] your calling you've made your calling an
[1:02:13] election sure you know where you're at
[1:02:17] glory
[1:02:19] hallelujah amen and so that was the word
[1:02:21] of God to Noah and the word of God
[1:02:23] properly
[1:02:25] constructed took Noah and his family
[1:02:28] from the Earth to the sky amen and
[1:02:31] escaped the judgments of that world and
[1:02:34] all those that would believe that
[1:02:37] fanatical message of entering into that
[1:02:40] funnyl looking thing that they had never
[1:02:41] seen before amen they did not perish
[1:02:44] with the unbelieving
[1:02:48] world Amen and so again as we go on Amen
[1:02:52] we can see examples all throughout the
[1:02:54] scripture where where the people of God
[1:02:56] had the word of God but no open Vision
[1:02:59] or no direct expression of the present
[1:03:02] tense will of God for their
[1:03:05] life oh I wonder if God can help us
[1:03:07] tonight amen to to look a
[1:03:10] past our our difficulties amen look a
[1:03:13] past this this frail uh human life our
[1:03:16] our difficulties if it's financial
[1:03:19] troubles if it's some emotional
[1:03:20] something or another if God can just
[1:03:23] help us to to turn away from that long
[1:03:25] enough to catch the vision for today the
[1:03:29] open vision for the hour amen how many
[1:03:31] would like that in your life and then no
[1:03:34] matter the the difficulties no matter
[1:03:36] the circumstances you are walking with a
[1:03:40] purpose and then that's how we can walk
[1:03:42] like Enoch walked amen walked before God
[1:03:45] Walking with God with a testimony that
[1:03:48] he pleased God because the word of God
[1:03:50] for that hour had become an open Vision
[1:03:53] to him Hallelujah and he put it into
[1:03:56] action glory to God and today it's a
[1:03:59] living Monument for all of us to see
[1:04:02] hallelujah oh my praise the
[1:04:05] Lord and so Proverbs 29:18 we know a
[1:04:08] very familiar scripture where there is
[1:04:09] no vision the people what perish where
[1:04:14] there is no vision the people
[1:04:16] perish amen so the word must become your
[1:04:21] vision the word must become your
[1:04:24] Vision not your next or neighbor's
[1:04:27] Vision your vision because no matter
[1:04:29] what you're going to make it oh I love
[1:04:33] that song though all though I I have
[1:04:35] decided to follow Jesus though none go
[1:04:38] with me still will I follow amen but uh
[1:04:42] I'm not going to be very happy if nobody
[1:04:43] goes with me so we're we're everybody uh
[1:04:46] as many as will come come on Amen praise
[1:04:49] the Lord we're going together amen and I
[1:04:52] like that quote where brother says about
[1:04:54] two together we'll make it by the grace
[1:04:56] of
[1:05:01] God so where there is no vision the
[1:05:05] people perish where there is no
[1:05:08] expression of God's will for your life
[1:05:11] the people
[1:05:12] perish and in the Amplified where there
[1:05:15] is no revelation of God and his word
[1:05:19] where there is no vision or where there
[1:05:21] is no revelation of God and his word the
[1:05:25] people
[1:05:26] perish so you can have the word but has
[1:05:29] the word come off the pages and has it
[1:05:32] been revealed to you in a personal way
[1:05:35] to where you see yourself in the
[1:05:37] scripture and understand the perfect
[1:05:41] will of God for your
[1:05:48] life and I love this prayer the prophet
[1:05:51] prays in December 31st 1962 on the the
[1:05:54] closing of that New Year's service he
[1:05:56] says
[1:05:57] father open to us the rock beneath the
[1:06:00] rock that we might see Jesus in his
[1:06:04] program amen Jesus in his program so the
[1:06:09] prophet is praying open the rock beneath
[1:06:11] the rock that we might see Jesus and his
[1:06:15] program in other words that we might
[1:06:17] catch a vision of where we are at in the
[1:06:20] program of God praise the Lord Jesus and
[1:06:23] his program that's what I'm interested
[1:06:24] in amen not some other not somebody
[1:06:27] else's program not my program but Jesus
[1:06:30] and his
[1:06:31] program oh my
[1:06:33] Hallelujah and so just to step through
[1:06:36] this thought a little bit more on an
[1:06:37] open
[1:06:38] vision and then we'll get into the burnt
[1:06:41] offering and I want to show a little
[1:06:42] types A few types from the Old Testament
[1:06:45] just to show how
[1:06:46] tremendous this thought is on the burnt
[1:06:49] offering and all the the major things
[1:06:51] that God accomplished throughout the day
[1:06:53] throughout all all of history when these
[1:06:55] burnt offerings went up and then Lord
[1:06:58] willing if we have enough time we'll
[1:07:00] bring it uh we'll bring it present tense
[1:07:03] here but uh you know an open Vision we
[1:07:06] know as I mentioned the word of God is a
[1:07:08] vision when uh we can say as an example
[1:07:12] the prophet Isaiah he seen the Lord
[1:07:15] Jesus amen uh upon the cross and he and
[1:07:18] so on and so forth and he says uh you
[1:07:20] know he was stricken smitten of God
[1:07:22] Afflicted and so on and so forth that
[1:07:24] was a vision he seen that and then years
[1:07:28] later when we come into the New
[1:07:29] Testament in the book of Acts it was the
[1:07:32] Ethiopian unic I believe uh in Acts 8 he
[1:07:36] was reading that scripture so in other
[1:07:39] words in other words the prophet had a
[1:07:41] vision foretold an event would take
[1:07:45] place the Ethiopian unic had the Scrolls
[1:07:49] of the prophet he had the the quotes of
[1:07:52] the Prophet if it were but it was sealed
[1:07:55] off to him he couldn't see it and he and
[1:07:59] he said and of course we know by
[1:08:02] predestination that God had that
[1:08:05] Ethiopian unic in his thinking amen he
[1:08:08] had a seed over there he had a son that
[1:08:11] he needed to get he had a son that he
[1:08:14] needed to Quicken to his program for
[1:08:16] that hour amen and so it was so
[1:08:19] important amen one person can have the
[1:08:23] majority for God Amen there was a great
[1:08:26] Revival taking place in Samaria demons
[1:08:28] were cast out Mark 16 in Action a great
[1:08:31] manifestations of the Holy Ghost taking
[1:08:34] place um who knows how many thousands or
[1:08:36] whatever were there but amen God sent oh
[1:08:40] philli with that quickening power and
[1:08:43] translated him to come speak to this one
[1:08:46] man glory to God there's one man over
[1:08:50] there that doesn't have my vision yet go
[1:08:52] and speak to him him and so when he was
[1:08:55] there reading the
[1:08:57] Scrolls amen he had the word but it
[1:09:00] might as well been a newspaper because
[1:09:03] it it benefited him nothing I mean
[1:09:06] because the Bible says the letter
[1:09:08] kth but the spirit giveth
[1:09:12] life amen so may we break into it into
[1:09:15] the word of God and may it break open
[1:09:18] and bring life to us tonight not just
[1:09:20] tonight but each and every day amen amen
[1:09:23] and so there was the Ethiopian unic and
[1:09:26] we know the story and how philli was
[1:09:28] translated there and he came upon the
[1:09:29] Chariot and and the Holy Spirit said
[1:09:32] draw near to him he drew near to him and
[1:09:34] he says what read understandest thou
[1:09:36] what thou readest and he said how can I
[1:09:38] unless some man interpret it for me I
[1:09:41] know that's a bad word these days but he
[1:09:43] had the word of the prophet and it was
[1:09:46] blinded to
[1:09:48] him and he was lacking a vision he would
[1:09:52] have been like a sad Christian in in
[1:09:53] other words he's got the word he's got
[1:09:56] all these Commandments all these
[1:09:57] legalistic ideas oh I got to go to
[1:09:59] church uh I hope brother Dan's not going
[1:10:01] to be preaching too long I hope brother
[1:10:03] Aaron's going to sing my favorite songs
[1:10:05] you know you're waiting what are you
[1:10:07] waiting for like a pep rally or you see
[1:10:09] that's how it is when you don't have a
[1:10:11] vision when you don't have a vision of
[1:10:14] the word of God for your life hallelujah
[1:10:18] amen amen no matter if all Hell Comes
[1:10:20] against you glory to God you'll stand
[1:10:23] because you've got the word of the Lord
[1:10:26] personally revealed to you Hallelujah
[1:10:31] that word can never fail in the mouth of
[1:10:33] a believing child amen glory to God
[1:10:37] hallelujah and so we know the story the
[1:10:40] Ethiopian unic was reading the scripture
[1:10:43] the quotes of the prophet and he said of
[1:10:45] whom speaketh the prophet of himself or
[1:10:48] of some other man hallelujah amen and so
[1:10:51] of course that was a vision that had
[1:10:54] been put on paper but Phillip to Phillip
[1:10:58] it had become an open Vision because
[1:11:01] there the prophet seen the vision and
[1:11:05] but there philli the prophet seen the
[1:11:07] vision and foretold it that it would
[1:11:09] take place and we know that the story
[1:11:11] all the scribes everybody had their
[1:11:13] interpretation but once upon a time
[1:11:15] Phillip was called to follow This Man
[1:11:18] Called Jesus and that scripture in
[1:11:21] Isaiah became an open Vision to him
[1:11:23] Hallelujah he seen it fulfilled before
[1:11:26] his eyes the word of the Lord made
[1:11:29] manifest amen and so then philli had the
[1:11:32] will of God for that hour the word of
[1:11:36] God had become the will of God to fill
[1:11:38] up because now he was walking in the
[1:11:41] vision glory to
[1:11:46] God praise the Lord and let me tell a
[1:11:48] little a little story here of the
[1:11:50] prophet he sees a
[1:11:52] vision and
[1:11:54] uh and you know let me just say this
[1:11:56] real quick I was sharing with brother
[1:11:57] Dan back in the back you know when we
[1:12:00] talk of the message of the
[1:12:02] hour we're not talking of some kind of a
[1:12:04] cliche or some kind of a something or
[1:12:07] another it's the scriptures that have
[1:12:10] that have been prophesied to be
[1:12:12] fulfilled for this hour that's Jehovah's
[1:12:15] message that's God's message for this
[1:12:18] hour and I pray that it will become a
[1:12:21] vision to you am and you'll find your
[1:12:24] place in the
[1:12:26] vision oh my and so it's the word for
[1:12:29] this hour friends and so here the
[1:12:31] prophet was on the on the platform and
[1:12:33] and and of course he's having a prayer
[1:12:34] line and there comes up a sister uh with
[1:12:37] her little baby and the little baby was
[1:12:40] afflicted was sick of some kind of uh H
[1:12:42] something and there the prophet seen a
[1:12:45] vision and he seen a vision of the
[1:12:48] little girl a few years later going
[1:12:50] along skipping along perfectly normal
[1:12:53] and well like a little child and so he
[1:12:56] said thus sayith the Lord she's healed
[1:12:59] in other words is that right so he's
[1:13:00] seen a vision of the will of God for her
[1:13:04] life for that little child's life that
[1:13:06] child was afflicted by Satan and and and
[1:13:09] and may may have lost his life it was if
[1:13:11] it wasn't for the will of God being made
[1:13:13] manifest in that hour and so the prophet
[1:13:16] goes on to says he says now that's the
[1:13:18] word of the Lord made
[1:13:21] manifest no matter what what would to
[1:13:24] take place all the forces of Hell could
[1:13:27] move against
[1:13:28] that and this is challenging here but he
[1:13:31] says the the woman don't even have to
[1:13:34] have faith it's already been declared
[1:13:38] and I know we we have to have faith Amen
[1:13:41] to because we because without faith it
[1:13:43] is impossible to please God everything
[1:13:45] we do is by faith but as I said earlier
[1:13:48] you have nothing to do with it it's
[1:13:51] already been declared and we just apply
[1:13:54] the blood apply the word by faith
[1:13:58] amen and so it's already been declared
[1:14:02] he says all forces of hell can move
[1:14:04] against that the woman don't even have
[1:14:07] to have faith she don't have to have
[1:14:10] anything because God has said
[1:14:13] so and that's the word of God
[1:14:16] materialized he says then I had thus
[1:14:19] saith the Lord so the vision of the will
[1:14:22] of God brings to you thus sayeth the
[1:14:26] Lord and no demon in hell can shake you
[1:14:29] from that because amen it's a vision
[1:14:32] it's a declaration of the word will of
[1:14:36] God for your
[1:14:41] life and if you can just pardon a
[1:14:44] personal testimony here so this brought
[1:14:46] back something brother Dan uh several
[1:14:49] years ago my uh sister she wasn't
[1:14:52] serving the lord back then she she's
[1:14:53] serving the lord now by the grace of God
[1:14:56] and at that particular time she was
[1:14:58] struggling you know she was in and out
[1:15:00] up and
[1:15:00] down and uh she was in a car accident
[1:15:05] and her four-year-old daughter at the
[1:15:07] time which of course was my
[1:15:09] niece uh went through the
[1:15:13] windshield and landed up uh 20 30 yards
[1:15:16] in the ditch she didn't have her buckled
[1:15:17] in these things because like I said she
[1:15:19] was not serving the lord she wasn't
[1:15:20] thinking right and I can say that cuz
[1:15:22] she's my sister amen
[1:15:25] but this little just imagine
[1:15:27] four-year-old girl flying through the
[1:15:29] windshield of an F-150 pickup Landing in
[1:15:31] the ditch and way out in the middle of
[1:15:34] nowhere the air VOR over to Phoenix
[1:15:36] Children's Hospital or St Joseph's or
[1:15:38] something up there and anyway she had a
[1:15:40] long story short it was brain damage and
[1:15:43] I never seen anything so hideous in my
[1:15:46] my my personal life when I walked into
[1:15:49] the hospital there was you know this
[1:15:52] four-year-old girl with a with a head
[1:15:54] like twice the size you know from the
[1:15:57] injury and solid
[1:16:00] purple and uh and so she was there in
[1:16:02] the hospital for a few days and try to
[1:16:04] make a long story
[1:16:06] short of course with the with the brain
[1:16:08] damage she she just wasn't there and
[1:16:11] like I said that was one of the saddest
[1:16:12] sites that I I've ever seen personally
[1:16:15] where she could be a normal human being
[1:16:17] she could be a normal four-year-old
[1:16:19] daughter and her name's Haley but you
[1:16:21] you could call her name Haley and she
[1:16:23] would just sit there in the bed staring
[1:16:25] out staring out the
[1:16:27] window and no matter
[1:16:30] what it was like there was nobody home
[1:16:34] of course physically she looked okay but
[1:16:37] mentally you know there was nobody home
[1:16:40] you could call her name but yet she
[1:16:43] might as well not even have been there
[1:16:44] you see what I'm saying and so I think
[1:16:46] you know that reminds me a lot of times
[1:16:48] of Christians a lot of times you know
[1:16:52] they they're in a pew but they're more
[1:16:54] or less spiritually numb they haven't
[1:16:57] received the intelligence of Christ they
[1:16:59] haven't received the word of God for
[1:17:01] their life to bring them in intelligence
[1:17:04] you could call their name you could you
[1:17:07] could bring to them the faith in the
[1:17:09] reality that this word has for
[1:17:12] them and and there's that Blank
[1:17:15] Stare but uh uh again to go on with this
[1:17:18] testimony and trying to make a long
[1:17:19] story
[1:17:21] short uh there was a vision that was
[1:17:23] declared amen and that Vision was was a
[1:17:26] dream and the dream showed her sitting
[1:17:29] in that same hospital bed perfectly well
[1:17:32] and normal and after the dream I said
[1:17:35] Satan and again that's the word of the
[1:17:37] Lord being made manifest no demon in
[1:17:40] hell can break that and and and and and
[1:17:43] after that was declared I said Satan you
[1:17:46] are
[1:17:47] defeated Hallelujah so I ran to the
[1:17:49] hospital of course laid hands on her
[1:17:51] prayed for it the very next next day she
[1:17:54] was sitting in bed normal perfectly
[1:17:57] normal perfectly healed and up to that
[1:18:00] time praise the
[1:18:05] Lord and up to that time all the nurses
[1:18:07] all the doctors said if she if she makes
[1:18:10] it out of this she'll have to relearn
[1:18:12] how to talk relearn how to walk relearn
[1:18:14] everything all over again if she makes
[1:18:17] it out of that but when Jesus came on
[1:18:20] the scene amen when the word of God was
[1:18:24] proclaimed when the vision broke forth
[1:18:27] no I don't care what any doctor said
[1:18:30] what any diagnosis was amen that was
[1:18:33] perfect faith on the scene and no matter
[1:18:36] how many demons said it wouldn't
[1:18:38] happened it was going to happen and it
[1:18:41] happened Hallelujah the very next day
[1:18:44] she was up talking like a normal child
[1:18:46] and she was released a day later praise
[1:18:48] the Lord and so now today she's a
[1:18:51] healthy normal uh child of God praise
[1:18:53] the Lord so I just want to share that a
[1:18:55] personal testimony how when the Lord
[1:18:58] brings to you a
[1:19:00] reality nothing can shake you from it me
[1:19:04] and and as I mentioned you know we drift
[1:19:06] in and we drift out of those positions
[1:19:08] at times but there's coming an hour that
[1:19:10] is very near and even upon us where
[1:19:13] there will be no more
[1:19:15] drifting we'll be in that Vision perfect
[1:19:19] Faith hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:19:23] and so the prophet if I can use this
[1:19:24] illustration again he gives an example
[1:19:27] of three different
[1:19:29] spheres that Christians live in how many
[1:19:32] has heard this before three different
[1:19:34] spheres so up here we would say is
[1:19:36] heaven the kingdom of God or however you
[1:19:38] want to illustrate it and then there's
[1:19:40] three spares the the top sphere he said
[1:19:42] is is the sublime right next to heaven
[1:19:46] the second sphere and then then there's
[1:19:49] the first the bottom sphere he said the
[1:19:50] bottom sphere is basically Bally the
[1:19:53] formal church member that would just
[1:19:55] drift in drift out they with all their
[1:19:58] ritualistic Affairs he says in one place
[1:20:01] and let me just go ahead and read it I
[1:20:02] have it right
[1:20:03] here he says uh and there's another
[1:20:06] sphere he says right next to heaven
[1:20:07] where the powers of God is leaking down
[1:20:09] so the powers of God is leaking down
[1:20:11] through all these spheres and by the
[1:20:13] time it gets to gets to the nominal
[1:20:15] church member they just go on in cold
[1:20:18] professions in a little r ritualistic
[1:20:21] affair he says that is the nominal
[1:20:25] Church they just get the very slight
[1:20:29] drippings so they just go on with their
[1:20:32] little ritualistic Affairs to to help
[1:20:34] them to feel religious and like they're
[1:20:36] doing their Duty that's the nominal
[1:20:38] church member but God has more for you
[1:20:42] amen God has a better plan for you so
[1:20:45] the next sphere above that is the sphere
[1:20:49] as he called the Full Gospel Fe sphere
[1:20:51] think about that the the Full Gospel
[1:20:53] sphere amen we would say oh praise the
[1:20:56] lord we want to be there but he said
[1:20:57] they go off into isms it reminds me of
[1:21:01] if I can just deviate for a second when
[1:21:03] Elijah called Elisha if you remember he
[1:21:07] said I'm going to gilgal I believe it
[1:21:09] was right I'm going to gilgal and that
[1:21:12] is the place of Christian Beginnings in
[1:21:15] other words as a Christian that is the
[1:21:17] beginning of your journey we could say
[1:21:19] would be gilgal then he moved from there
[1:21:21] to the school of the prophets and then
[1:21:24] he moved from there and across Jordan
[1:21:26] but Elijah Elijah was called to follow
[1:21:29] him and not to stop in gilgal not to
[1:21:31] stop in the school of the prophets but
[1:21:33] to go all the way across Jordan to an
[1:21:37] open Vision where the word of the Lord
[1:21:39] was made
[1:21:40] manifest amen and so so it is with these
[1:21:43] spheres the bottom sphere is the n
[1:21:45] nominal fundamental church member the
[1:21:47] next one would be like the Full Gospel
[1:21:48] where the Prophet said they run off into
[1:21:50] isms they run off into their own ideas
[1:21:54] their own doctrines their own this their
[1:21:55] own that but the next sphere is the
[1:21:58] sublime the next sphere is perfect Faith
[1:22:02] the next fear is the word of the Lord
[1:22:04] made manifest for your
[1:22:08] life and that is the that is what every
[1:22:10] one of us has in this hour is the
[1:22:12] opportunity to live in that in to live
[1:22:14] in that place
[1:22:16] amen and so that's God's word
[1:22:19] materialized and the Bride of Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ is just just as much of the word
[1:22:24] as he is the
[1:22:25] word amen the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:22:28] just as much the word as he is the
[1:22:31] word but what if that word concerning
[1:22:35] you could be
[1:22:38] materialized you would live in a realm
[1:22:41] of perfect Faith
[1:22:43] amen and so let's just go
[1:22:48] to a few examples of this real
[1:22:51] quick
[1:22:58] praise the
[1:23:02] Lord how much more time do we have
[1:23:04] brother
[1:23:06] Dan all right praise the Lord amen but I
[1:23:10] just trust this will be a blessing to
[1:23:13] you and in in in in other words like I
[1:23:16] said May the word of God become a vision
[1:23:19] to us become an open Vision to us
[1:23:26] and as I mentioned the burnt sacrifice
[1:23:28] or the burnt offering we know uh was a
[1:23:31] part of of their Old Testament worship
[1:23:35] every worshipper that would come to God
[1:23:37] that would come to the Tabernacle they
[1:23:39] had to uh offer an offering is that
[1:23:42] right they had to place their hand upon
[1:23:44] the lamb or whatever type of offering
[1:23:47] they're offering and the Bible said that
[1:23:49] they had to place it not upon the foot
[1:23:51] or upon the back back or upon the
[1:23:53] shoulder but they had to place their
[1:23:55] hand upon the head upon the head of the
[1:23:59] lamb and that's the word that's being
[1:24:01] revealed in this hour is not the foot
[1:24:03] part not the not the shoulder part but
[1:24:06] the head part so that's what we're
[1:24:08] called to be identified is the head part
[1:24:10] of our sacrifice the head part of the
[1:24:13] word the head part of the
[1:24:15] lamb and if we were to go back and look
[1:24:17] at all of the Old Testament examples if
[1:24:20] we can just look at a few of them for a
[1:24:21] second so maybe the Lord will help us to
[1:24:24] catch a reality of this burnt offering
[1:24:27] and how important it is amen so it was
[1:24:30] essential in Every Act of Christian
[1:24:32] worship or every act of worship
[1:24:33] throughout the Old
[1:24:36] Testament and I believe if I'm not
[1:24:38] mistaken the word burnt
[1:24:40] offering uh is a Hebrew word that means
[1:24:43] to ascend in other words offer an
[1:24:46] offering that will Ascend offer an
[1:24:48] offering that will cause Ascension and
[1:24:51] and and and and and and it was one of
[1:24:53] the very few offerings where they would
[1:24:56] uh not just kill it but they had to
[1:24:58] actually uh they had to actually tear it
[1:25:01] apart they had to tear the insides out
[1:25:04] they had to it had to be everything had
[1:25:07] to be
[1:25:08] consumed not just a not just a hand not
[1:25:11] just a a leg and that's what God wants
[1:25:13] of you tonight amen he doesn't want just
[1:25:15] your just your hand you know to do some
[1:25:17] work around the church or your foot to
[1:25:19] go walk and testify to somebody he wants
[1:25:22] every aspect of your being amen a
[1:25:26] complete sacrifice holy and acceptable
[1:25:29] to God which is your reasonable service
[1:25:33] something that will help you overcome
[1:25:35] The Temptations of this hour something
[1:25:37] that'll help you overcome all the
[1:25:38] complexes and all of the all of the
[1:25:41] attacks and anxiety and so forth that
[1:25:43] Satan is bringing against us in this
[1:25:45] hour because he's doing all he can to
[1:25:48] stop us from coming to the realization
[1:25:51] of this open Vision being made known to
[1:25:54] you and I
[1:25:57] Hallelujah because when that happens his
[1:26:00] accusing is
[1:26:02] over his accusing as the scripture says
[1:26:05] that he is the accuser of the Brethren
[1:26:07] is it okay if I just bounce back and
[1:26:08] forth for a little bit praise the Lord
[1:26:11] he is the accuser of the Brethren and we
[1:26:13] know that your name if you're if you're
[1:26:16] predestinated as a son or daughter of
[1:26:17] God your name was written in the Lamb's
[1:26:20] Book of Life before the foundation in
[1:26:22] the world Amen so it's not just don't
[1:26:25] think of it as a natural book here like
[1:26:27] this but it's something that is so
[1:26:29] special to God like I said he knew of
[1:26:31] you intimately knew you not your natural
[1:26:36] you but the you that you're supposed to
[1:26:38] be because God foresaw and predestinated
[1:26:43] a world of Sons and Daughters of God
[1:26:45] Amen he predestinated a world of perfect
[1:26:49] Faith he predestinated a world of of no
[1:26:52] sickness of no sorrow he predestinated a
[1:26:56] world of of sub of of of sublime
[1:27:01] Joy praise the Lord and so he foresaw
[1:27:04] you he had a knowing of you of your
[1:27:07] characteristics of your potential and so
[1:27:09] on and so forth before the foundation of
[1:27:11] the world and he placed your name in a
[1:27:13] book if would you say like that called
[1:27:15] the Lamb's Book of Life and the Bible
[1:27:17] refers to the Book of Life and the
[1:27:19] Lamb's Book of Life and the book of life
[1:27:22] is a record of your natural life all of
[1:27:26] your Deeds that was done in the book
[1:27:28] amen maybe when you told that lie or you
[1:27:32] uh you you stole something or you you
[1:27:34] hit a home run it doesn't have to all be
[1:27:36] negative right but you hit a home run or
[1:27:38] you did this or you did that that's all
[1:27:41] record in your natural life and see
[1:27:44] Satan has access to that he can he can
[1:27:48] see oh Dan you did this last week you
[1:27:51] did this over there seeing as long as we
[1:27:55] are walking by that book we're blinding
[1:27:58] ourselves from our true
[1:28:00] identity is that right because our true
[1:28:03] identity the open Vision that we should
[1:28:05] be walking by is the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:28:09] yes sir amen not our natural life but
[1:28:12] the life of the Lamb we must be
[1:28:14] identified with our sacrifice place your
[1:28:17] head on your sacrifice or place your
[1:28:19] hand on the head of your sacrifice
[1:28:22] it's your sacrifice it's your identity
[1:28:26] you're identified with this lamb oh as
[1:28:29] the worshiper amen would would raise
[1:28:31] this lamb think about that and it and it
[1:28:34] was a lamb without blemish he would know
[1:28:37] that it met the qualifications
[1:28:40] Hallelujah it met the requirements of
[1:28:42] Jehovah God this holy God this righteous
[1:28:45] God this lamb that I had been feeding
[1:28:48] that I had been raising day in and day
[1:28:50] out glory to to God Amen that's what
[1:28:53] you're doing amen every time you come to
[1:28:55] church every time you hear the word of
[1:28:56] the Lord you're feeding the real you
[1:29:00] you're feeding that perfect lamb glory
[1:29:02] to God hallelujah amen so let's offer an
[1:29:06] offering acceptable to God which is your
[1:29:09] reasonable service being not conformed
[1:29:12] to the things of the world but being
[1:29:15] transformed being
[1:29:17] transformed from your old nature from
[1:29:20] the your nature in the book of life
[1:29:22] being transformed to an open Vision to
[1:29:27] the nature in the Lamb's work of Life
[1:29:30] your original nature the nature that you
[1:29:34] would have been born with had there been
[1:29:37] no fall Hallelujah glory to God just's
[1:29:41] think about that amen let's catch a
[1:29:42] vision may God help us and so Satan has
[1:29:46] access to that book of life he can say
[1:29:49] you did this you thought that you did
[1:29:51] this you did did that but by the grace
[1:29:54] of God that book if we read the Bible in
[1:29:57] Romans 7 go home and read it when you
[1:29:59] get home it talks about it seems like
[1:30:01] marriage and divorce that that you can't
[1:30:03] be married while you have a living mate
[1:30:05] and so on and so forth but it's a
[1:30:07] prophecy for this hour it's a prophecy
[1:30:10] for the last day that your first nature
[1:30:14] that you were born with from The Book of
[1:30:16] Life must be
[1:30:18] dead must be dead
[1:30:22] and if we go to the burnt offering must
[1:30:24] be totally
[1:30:26] consumed no remembrance of it
[1:30:29] left
[1:30:31] dead no more complexes amen no more
[1:30:35] frustrations no none of these things
[1:30:38] because that is all in the natural
[1:30:41] book but by the grace of God you're
[1:30:44] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:30:47] in other words not anything that you can
[1:30:48] do we we we can no more save oursel then
[1:30:51] we can take our our our shoes and jump
[1:30:53] over the Moon I mean we can't do that
[1:30:55] but it's simply abiding in his shakina
[1:30:58] glory the word of the Lord made manifest
[1:31:02] walking in the light as he is in the
[1:31:04] light and the blood of Jesus Christ what
[1:31:07] cleanses you from all
[1:31:11] unrighteousness there is therefore now
[1:31:13] no condemnation to them that walk after
[1:31:17] this open Vision amen that walk not
[1:31:19] after the flesh after the book of life
[1:31:22] but after the Lamb's Book of Life that
[1:31:26] has become your
[1:31:29] identity praise the Lord amen so Satan
[1:31:32] has access to that book of life amen but
[1:31:35] one thing he doesn't have access to is
[1:31:37] the Lamb's Book of Life because it was
[1:31:40] written before he ever came into
[1:31:42] existence
[1:31:44] hallelujah amen so so the worshipper was
[1:31:46] Raising this lamb raising this lamb and
[1:31:50] and he would examine examine it examine
[1:31:52] it examine it does it have a blemish and
[1:31:55] no I don't think it has a blemish he
[1:31:56] brings it to the priest the priest
[1:31:59] examines it and they don't do just like
[1:32:01] we do you know like some kind of H
[1:32:03] Hazard like oh I think I'll be okay you
[1:32:06] know I'll just go to church and I'll
[1:32:08] I'll fake it this time or whatever they
[1:32:10] get a magnifying glass and they're
[1:32:13] examining every
[1:32:16] detail and and and and is wonderful
[1:32:19] though when we can lay before his
[1:32:21] presence and let our heart open up and
[1:32:23] let every detail of our life be consumed
[1:32:27] by his holy fire Hallelujah and so that
[1:32:30] lamb that that uh worshipper would offer
[1:32:34] his perfect lamb and before that lamb
[1:32:37] was to be slaughtered he would place his
[1:32:40] hand upon the head of that lamb and we
[1:32:44] know we know the story and we know the
[1:32:46] the symbology of it it was in essence
[1:32:48] transferring his sins to the lamb in
[1:32:51] other words it was was making a
[1:32:52] sacrifice and that sacrifice would be
[1:32:54] consumed would be would be hacked to
[1:32:57] Pieces amen because this is a bloody
[1:32:59] religion amen this is a lifegiving
[1:33:02] religion this is a religion that's got
[1:33:05] blood in it
[1:33:07] Hallelujah I'm not much for a bloodless
[1:33:10] religion I'm not much for a lifeless Rel
[1:33:13] religion but the worshipper would take
[1:33:16] that perfect lamb and and offer it as a
[1:33:19] sacrifice and it was accepted before God
[1:33:23] as an atonement Hallelujah we know that
[1:33:25] was a temporary atonement he had to do
[1:33:27] it day in and day out year in and year
[1:33:29] out and so on and so forth until the
[1:33:31] real Lamb of God has come on the scene
[1:33:34] until the real Lamb of God Has
[1:33:37] Come amen the perfect one without sin
[1:33:41] from before the foundation of the world
[1:33:43] came on the scene amen and purchased our
[1:33:46] Redemption for us
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:54] and so the burnt
[1:33:56] offering amen is something that has been
[1:33:58] all throughout life all throughout
[1:34:00] history I should say and let's do look
[1:34:02] at these Old Testament types and may the
[1:34:04] Lord help us to apply it to today and
[1:34:06] hopefully you can see the living reality
[1:34:09] of what we have before us today Amen in
[1:34:11] all the Old Testament types we know the
[1:34:13] first example they say and it's commonly
[1:34:15] believe that Abel offered a burnt
[1:34:18] offering with his sacrifice we know the
[1:34:20] Bible says that in process of time the
[1:34:23] Cain and Abel brought it was it was time
[1:34:25] for them to bring an offering Cain
[1:34:27] worshiped by intellect Cain worshiped by
[1:34:31] uh maybe the works of his hands right
[1:34:33] bringing his fruits and things that he
[1:34:35] had toiled for but Abel offered a more
[1:34:38] excellent
[1:34:40] sacrifice because it was revealed to
[1:34:43] Abel he offered that burnt offering and
[1:34:45] it was accepted to God Amen
[1:34:48] Noah think about that when Noah had came
[1:34:51] from from the old world as we were
[1:34:53] saying earlier that world was
[1:34:56] destroyed and he had stepped into the
[1:34:59] ark and and and and was lifted above the
[1:35:01] judgment and was transferred into the
[1:35:04] new world praise the Lord the second
[1:35:07] Earth if we can say it like that and so
[1:35:10] there we know the story as God showed
[1:35:12] him the rainbow and said it was going to
[1:35:14] be a covenant and I I'll send my my
[1:35:17] rainbow my bow in the cloud which will
[1:35:19] be a covenant for you and there Noah
[1:35:22] offered a burnt offering and God's
[1:35:25] covenant was confirmed to Noah by the
[1:35:28] acceptance of the burnt
[1:35:31] offering Abraham we know in his final
[1:35:34] test Abraham Abraham had been tested
[1:35:37] many many times many many years
[1:35:38] throughout his life as the word of God
[1:35:41] was being unfolded to him as it was
[1:35:44] being unfolded to him more and more and
[1:35:46] more until he got to the spot of
[1:35:49] complete
[1:35:50] surrender think about that how
[1:35:53] surrendered this man must have been how
[1:35:57] how pure how perfect the word of God was
[1:36:01] for his life to where when God said this
[1:36:05] son of yours that you've waited on for
[1:36:08] 25 years he's now at the ripe age of a
[1:36:11] 12-year-old healthy young man amen that
[1:36:15] when God told him go and sacrifice him
[1:36:19] go and make him a burnt offer offing to
[1:36:21] me oh my what how what a surrender what
[1:36:26] a consecration amen how many can can
[1:36:29] aspire to live to that kind of a
[1:36:31] consecration amen No Matter What God
[1:36:34] Says I I'll I'll surrender every aspect
[1:36:38] of my life and it's not an overnight
[1:36:40] thing you know Abraham wouldn't have
[1:36:41] done that as soon as he came out of out
[1:36:43] of Babel he wouldn't have done that he
[1:36:45] would have said no way Lord I must be
[1:36:48] hallucinating or something amen so and
[1:36:51] but it was a but God knows and it was a
[1:36:53] a continual walk a continual unfolding
[1:36:56] surrender after surrender mistake after
[1:36:59] mistake trial after trial to where he
[1:37:02] got to a spot where he was completely
[1:37:05] surrendered a complete prisoner to the
[1:37:08] will of almighty God and almighty God
[1:37:11] said take him and offering a offer him
[1:37:14] as a burnt offering and we know the
[1:37:16] story he took him three days journey to
[1:37:18] mount Mariah and there uh when he was
[1:37:21] about to offer him God said stay your
[1:37:23] hand Abraham for now I know that thou
[1:37:26] lovest me with all thine heart in
[1:37:28] blessing I Will Bless thee in
[1:37:30] multiplying I will multiply thee and thy
[1:37:33] seed shall possess the Gate of their
[1:37:36] enemy Hallelujah glory to God so as that
[1:37:39] offering was accepted that's where
[1:37:41] Jehovah Gyra was made manifest amen he
[1:37:46] God's Provisions God Abraham did not
[1:37:49] know Jehovah
[1:37:52] as Jehovah Gyra before Hallelujah
[1:37:55] Abraham did not know God as Jehovah Gyra
[1:37:58] before so think about that through your
[1:38:00] tests through your trials amen God is
[1:38:04] wanting to reveal himself to you in a
[1:38:06] more intimate way Hallelujah he only
[1:38:10] knew him as the strength giver and so on
[1:38:12] and so forth but now after he had been
[1:38:14] put to his final test he could call him
[1:38:18] Jehovah Gyra he had come to the spot
[1:38:22] where he knew God as a Creator he knew
[1:38:25] God in the Capstone revelation of what
[1:38:28] he was to be known in that hour and the
[1:38:31] promise came thy seed shall possess the
[1:38:34] Gate of his enemy
[1:38:36] amen and the Book of Samuel as we
[1:38:38] referred to earlier where there were
[1:38:40] before him there was no open Vision the
[1:38:43] people did whatever was right in their
[1:38:45] eyes the priests did whatever was right
[1:38:47] in their eyes everybody had their own
[1:38:49] Doctrine their own idea all of these
[1:38:52] things and so much where the lamp of God
[1:38:54] had gone out in the
[1:38:57] sanctuary oh my and so there was no open
[1:38:59] Vision but Samuel brought an open Vision
[1:39:02] back and up to that time you know the
[1:39:04] enemies had defeated Israel the
[1:39:06] Philistines and so forth had defeated
[1:39:08] them they even had took the ark away
[1:39:12] from
[1:39:13] Israel and here we come to or defeat
[1:39:16] after defeat and they and they come to
[1:39:18] such a spot in second 1st Samuel 7 where
[1:39:21] the Philistines were now coming upon
[1:39:24] Israel and Israel was scared to death
[1:39:27] they ran like a bunch of cowards because
[1:39:29] they didn't have the word of God in
[1:39:31] their midst but yet the Bible says that
[1:39:34] Samuel offered a burnt
[1:39:37] offering amen and when the and when the
[1:39:39] burnt offering was offered up anden
[1:39:42] Jehovah God thundered out of heaven and
[1:39:45] confuse the enemy the burnt offering was
[1:39:49] offered up and the V open Vision to
[1:39:52] Israel was
[1:39:55] restored amen and we know the 2
[1:39:58] kings8 Elijah same thing amen Israel had
[1:40:02] been T taken over excuse me in idolatry
[1:40:05] and and Ahab and Jezebel and all these
[1:40:07] things the prophets of bell and all this
[1:40:09] kind of idol worship and so on and so
[1:40:11] forth all this confusion is this idea
[1:40:13] right is that idea right is is this God
[1:40:16] right is that God right but God had a
[1:40:19] prophet on the scene he was going to
[1:40:21] bring a
[1:40:22] showdown a showdown an open Vision
[1:40:26] before
[1:40:27] them and we know the we know the story
[1:40:31] he brought God gave Elijah a
[1:40:34] vision and when it came time for Elijah
[1:40:38] he said he he called the prophets of
[1:40:39] bell and said let the god that answers
[1:40:41] by fire let him be God Amen and so
[1:40:45] Elijah did everything according to the
[1:40:49] vision that God had given given
[1:40:51] him according to the vision that God had
[1:40:55] given him and after it was precise
[1:40:58] everything was in order it was not no
[1:41:01] halfway circumstance everything was in
[1:41:05] order amen just like when they dedicated
[1:41:07] the temple and everything was in order
[1:41:10] and finally when they set the Ark in its
[1:41:13] place the shakina glory came rushing in
[1:41:17] but here they are in Second Kings in the
[1:41:19] Mount Carmel Showdown everything was in
[1:41:21] its place all the Bullocks everything
[1:41:23] was done according to the word of the
[1:41:26] Lord that had been revealed to Elijah
[1:41:29] and we know the story he offered the
[1:41:31] burnt offering or he put everything down
[1:41:33] and God answered by fire and brought a
[1:41:36] restoration brought a restoration that
[1:41:38] hour by a burnt offering by an open
[1:41:42] vision of that burnt offering the word
[1:41:45] of the Lord being made manifest amen
[1:41:48] praise the
[1:41:49] Lord
[1:41:52] and we won't have time to read it but if
[1:41:54] you can go back and you want to read the
[1:41:55] whole second uh the whole chapter of 2
[1:41:57] Chronicles chapter 29 verse
[1:42:01] 23 let me just read a little bit for a
[1:42:03] few seconds we'll start with verse 20
[1:42:06] you don't have to turn there but let me
[1:42:07] just quote it then Hezekiah the king
[1:42:10] Rose early and gathered the rulers of
[1:42:12] the city and went up to the house of the
[1:42:14] Lord so before
[1:42:15] Hezekiah the temple was was destroyed
[1:42:18] the the lamp of God had went out the
[1:42:20] seven golden candlesticks which you know
[1:42:22] represent the seven spirits of God and
[1:42:24] so on and so forth they had went out
[1:42:27] there was idolatry everywhere the the
[1:42:29] everything that was consecrated to God
[1:42:31] was in a mess and they even closed the
[1:42:34] doors of the temple and that was their
[1:42:37] way of worship back then there was no
[1:42:38] access to God the priests had backslid
[1:42:42] and went in their own imaginations and
[1:42:44] in their own ways and their own
[1:42:45] doctrines and their own ideas and so
[1:42:47] much to where the lamp of God had went
[1:42:50] out the the doors to the temple were
[1:42:52] closed there was no access to
[1:42:55] God but God dealt with the King Hezekiah
[1:42:58] and it's a beautiful story uh you can go
[1:43:00] back and read it it would be it be a
[1:43:02] real blessing but here Temple worship
[1:43:05] was
[1:43:06] restored Temple worship was
[1:43:10] restored and it was only after the word
[1:43:14] of the Lord has been brought back into
[1:43:15] its proper place the the temple had been
[1:43:18] cleansed this the the the lamps had been
[1:43:20] turned back on everything had been
[1:43:22] brought to its proper place and here we
[1:43:24] come to the first day of the first month
[1:43:27] of the new year and that's a good time
[1:43:29] to start worshiping God I mean you can
[1:43:31] turn the calendar in your life tonight
[1:43:34] and this can be a different night for
[1:43:36] you from this day forward you can walk
[1:43:38] in an open Vision then Hezekiah the king
[1:43:41] Rose early and gathered the rulers of
[1:43:43] the city and went up to the house of the
[1:43:44] Lord and they brought seven Bullocks and
[1:43:48] seven Rams and seven lambs and and seven
[1:43:51] he goats for a sin offering for the
[1:43:53] kingdom and for the sanctuary and for
[1:43:56] Judah and he commanded the priest the
[1:43:59] sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar
[1:44:02] of the Lord so they killed the Bullocks
[1:44:04] and the priest received the blood and
[1:44:06] sprinkled it on the altar likewise when
[1:44:09] they had killed the Rams they sprinkled
[1:44:12] the blood upon the altar they killed
[1:44:15] also the Lambs and they sprinkled the
[1:44:18] blood upon the altar amen like I said a
[1:44:20] bloody religion they were having a holy
[1:44:22] ghost Revival in other words they were
[1:44:24] being identified with all of this word
[1:44:27] of the all of this word had had had been
[1:44:29] opened up and was now being placed
[1:44:31] before them all right let me just try to
[1:44:34] hurry
[1:44:36] up so he's talking about the priest
[1:44:38] killing them I want to get down to this
[1:44:39] spot here which is just so
[1:44:43] beautiful and he set the Levites in the
[1:44:46] house of the Lord with symbols with
[1:44:48] posteries with harps according to the
[1:44:51] Commandment of David and of GAD the king
[1:44:54] Seer and Nathan the prophet and so was
[1:44:57] the and and so and for so was the
[1:44:59] Commandment of the Lord by the prophets
[1:45:01] and the Levites stood with the
[1:45:03] instruments of David and the priests
[1:45:05] with the
[1:45:06] trumpets and Hezekiah commanded to offer
[1:45:10] the burnt offering upon the Altar and
[1:45:13] when the burnt offering began the song
[1:45:17] of the Lord began
[1:45:19] also with the trumpets and with the
[1:45:22] instruments ordained by David king of
[1:45:24] Israel and all the congregation
[1:45:28] worshiped and the singer sang and the
[1:45:31] trumpeters sounded why because they're
[1:45:34] all catching a vision Hallelujah they
[1:45:37] were all in harmony under this burnt
[1:45:40] offering and the song of the
[1:45:43] Lord hallelujah not just any song but
[1:45:47] the song of the Lord and the
[1:45:48] congregation worship and the the singer
[1:45:50] sang and the trumeter sounded and all
[1:45:53] this continued until the burnt offering
[1:45:56] was
[1:45:57] finished now when I first read this I'm
[1:45:59] thinking you know 10 15 20 minutes you
[1:46:02] know but let's go
[1:46:04] on and when they had made a end of the
[1:46:06] offering the king and all them that were
[1:46:08] present with him bowed themselves and
[1:46:12] worshiped let's just read and the number
[1:46:15] of the burnt offerings which the
[1:46:16] congregation brought was three score
[1:46:19] verse 32 thank you
[1:46:21] and the number of the burnt offerings
[1:46:23] which the congregations brought was
[1:46:25] three score and 10 Bullocks
[1:46:29] 70 100 Rams 200 lambs and these were for
[1:46:34] a burnt offering wow amen so amen what
[1:46:38] is that 70 uh 100 and 200 so
[1:46:43] 370 amen burnt offerings and while the
[1:46:46] burnt off and when the burnt offering
[1:46:48] began think about the anointing think
[1:46:51] about the the vision everyone in harmony
[1:46:54] the word of God in its place nothing out
[1:46:56] of place no complexes no no no no
[1:47:00] hiccups from some past experience or
[1:47:02] something you know like I'm I'm I'm hurt
[1:47:04] because of what this other Prophet did
[1:47:06] or what this other priest did to me over
[1:47:08] there all of that was gone the sacrifice
[1:47:11] had been offered they were entering into
[1:47:14] the vision the word of the Lord made
[1:47:16] manifest for temple worship Temple
[1:47:20] worship ship had been restored glory to
[1:47:22] God thank God for that King hallelujah
[1:47:25] thank God that he applied the word to
[1:47:28] his life he brought everything in order
[1:47:33] and there the congregation brought amen
[1:47:36] 370 burnt offerings amen and as they
[1:47:39] laid them on there as they excuse me but
[1:47:42] as they were hacked as they were skinned
[1:47:45] as they were cut open as the blood was
[1:47:47] flying as all this was happening the
[1:47:49] trumpet ERS were trumpeting the singers
[1:47:52] were singing the ju the worshippers were
[1:47:55] worshiping they were all brought in
[1:47:58] harmony Hallelujah they were all brought
[1:48:02] in unity into the vision into perfect
[1:48:06] harmony with the word of the Lord for
[1:48:08] that hour glory to God Amen May the
[1:48:10] trumpeters come praise the Lord May the
[1:48:12] musicians come amen we'll wind it up so
[1:48:15] let me try to wind it up real quick May
[1:48:16] the musicians come amen but they were
[1:48:19] all brought in Harmony they lay aside
[1:48:22] their their ideas their doubts their
[1:48:24] selfish Ambitions they had crucified to
[1:48:28] themselves their desires and so on and
[1:48:31] so forth they in other words they did
[1:48:34] what Romans 12 does us to do Amen to
[1:48:36] offer a burnt offering of our ideas of
[1:48:39] our life of all these things and be not
[1:48:41] conformed to this world but being
[1:48:43] transformed by the re renewing our mind
[1:48:46] that we may prove what is that good and
[1:48:49] perfect perfect and
[1:48:52] acceptable will of God for our
[1:48:56] life and so they were all there in one
[1:48:59] Accord worshiping just play something
[1:49:01] softly and and and and
[1:49:04] trumpeting and uh and playing out the
[1:49:08] vision playing out the word of the Lord
[1:49:10] for their life
[1:49:13] amen and let me just read that I was
[1:49:16] trying to quote it but Paul says I
[1:49:18] beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[1:49:20] mercies of God that you present your
[1:49:22] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and
[1:49:24] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:49:27] reasonable service and be not conformed
[1:49:29] to this world but be transformed by the
[1:49:33] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:49:35] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:49:36] perfect will of God so being transformed
[1:49:39] am mean it's not an overlight thing like
[1:49:40] I said it's a day byday consecration
[1:49:43] that you may prove what is the
[1:49:45] acceptable and perfect will of God for
[1:49:47] your life and as I mentioned you've got
[1:49:49] to move from The Book of Life to your
[1:49:53] identification in the Lamb's Book of
[1:49:55] Life I hope that doesn't sound too
[1:49:57] strange but the Bible says let me just
[1:49:59] read this real quick in Colossians
[1:50:02] 3 Colossians
[1:50:04] 3:3 go ahead and put that up if you have
[1:50:06] a second Colossians
[1:50:09] 3:3 for you are
[1:50:13] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[1:50:17] God so you are dead but you're life is
[1:50:20] hid with Christ in
[1:50:24] God so there's two
[1:50:27] 's in other words there's two use
[1:50:30] there's two Natures inside of you if you
[1:50:32] are predestinated son or daughter of God
[1:50:35] there's two Natures that old nature is
[1:50:37] identified in The Book of Life which
[1:50:39] Satan has access to that but you must be
[1:50:42] transformed into the Lamb's work of life
[1:50:46] and this must become your
[1:50:48] identification and therefore there is no
[1:50:50] condemnation to them that walk after
[1:50:52] this because this becomes your open
[1:50:55] Vision this becomes your mind the mind
[1:50:59] of Christ this becomes and the way that
[1:51:03] you prove the perfect and acceptable
[1:51:05] will of God for your life and and and
[1:51:08] until then you're you're a church member
[1:51:11] until then you're you're you're that's
[1:51:14] okay but keep going on don't stop there
[1:51:17] don't stop for nothing keep going on
[1:51:21] until you can
[1:51:26] prove not guess not Wonder but prove
[1:51:32] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:51:34] perfect will of God for your life and so
[1:51:36] again as the Bible says in Colossians 3
[1:51:39] for you are dead and your life is hid
[1:51:43] with Christ in God so when Paul wrote
[1:51:47] this nearly 2,000 years ago he's saying
[1:51:50] your life is
[1:51:51] hid but there's going to come a time
[1:51:55] when your life is no longer
[1:51:58] hid your life is hid with Christ in
[1:52:03] God so there comes a time when your life
[1:52:06] comes forth from the Eternal realm your
[1:52:10] life which is Christ comes forth and is
[1:52:13] made manifest before you as an open
[1:52:17] Vision amen because Paul went on to
[1:52:21] prophesy and say when
[1:52:24] Christ who is our life we are identified
[1:52:29] with our sacrifice tonight amen when
[1:52:32] Christ who is our life shall
[1:52:36] appear shall be
[1:52:39] revealed when Christ who is our life
[1:52:42] shall be
[1:52:43] revealed then shall we also appear with
[1:52:47] him in glory amen when Christ who is our
[1:52:51] life shall come
[1:52:53] forth from eternity he shall come forth
[1:52:58] and make himself
[1:52:59] known just like he did after the
[1:53:01] resurrection amen by the breaking of the
[1:53:03] bread is that right when he shall come
[1:53:05] forth that word appearing means
[1:53:08] Revelation
[1:53:09] amen at the
[1:53:12] Apocalypse at the
[1:53:14] unveiling at the revelation of Jesus
[1:53:18] Christ
[1:53:20] your life was hid with Christ in
[1:53:26] God but there was coming a Time
[1:53:29] according to Paul that your life comes
[1:53:32] forth when Christ comes forth to reveal
[1:53:36] himself so in other words this is the
[1:53:38] word of the Lord Paul seen this by
[1:53:42] Vision but now we have the
[1:53:45] opportunity to walk into the
[1:53:48] vision to step into the vision the word
[1:53:52] of the Lord has a vision for every one
[1:53:54] of us in our lives
[1:53:56] amen and let's just stand to our feet
[1:54:07] tonight and let me let me read this
[1:54:10] quote here the prophet says again
[1:54:13] speaking of Revelations FL
[1:54:16] five and the lamb proceeded out in into
[1:54:20] this Vision now as it had been
[1:54:24] slain Notice come from the father's
[1:54:28] Throne oh
[1:54:30] think where did he advance from to this
[1:54:35] Vision he come from Glory where he is
[1:54:39] Seated on the right hand of God he
[1:54:41] Advanced forth to
[1:54:46] John put your name in there amen because
[1:54:48] John represents the bride
[1:54:50] he Advanced forth to you why because he
[1:54:54] died for you he died to redeem you to
[1:54:59] bring you back to
[1:55:02] God he died for you you must be
[1:55:05] identified with your sacrifice you must
[1:55:07] step in and become a part of this vision
[1:55:11] and he will advance forth forward
[1:55:13] tonight to make himself known to you in
[1:55:16] the power of his resurrection in the
[1:55:19] power of the the word of the Lord made
[1:55:20] manifest for your life and you'll then
[1:55:23] move from that sphere to this sphere to
[1:55:25] the next sphere as the word of the Lord
[1:55:27] because the Bible says that the
[1:55:29] righteousness of God is revealed from
[1:55:32] Faith to Faith
[1:55:37] amen and so let us just bow our heads
[1:55:39] and close our eyes and meditate upon him
[1:55:41] as I as as I finish reading
[1:55:44] this may the Lord help us and give us
[1:55:48] strength for the journey that lays ahead
[1:55:51] amen so where did he advance from to
[1:55:54] this Vision he came from Glory where he
[1:55:58] is seated at the right hand of God he
[1:56:01] advaned
[1:56:03] forth to Nathaniel Barrett he Advanced
[1:56:06] forth to you out of Glory oh would it
[1:56:10] not be a glorious thing if our sinful
[1:56:13] thoughts tonight could be laid aside
[1:56:14] long enough to accept him and he would
[1:56:17] Advance all the way from Glory tonight
[1:56:21] to make himself known to any of you
[1:56:24] whatever your need is if it's salvation
[1:56:26] if if it's more of the perfect will of
[1:56:28] God being made manifest in your life he
[1:56:31] can advance forth to you not to you
[1:56:33] tonight you must be identified with your
[1:56:36] sacrifice and he can identify himself
[1:56:39] with you so whatever you have need of if
[1:56:42] it's strength for the journey strength
[1:56:44] for service a fresh vision of the
[1:56:47] perfect will of God in your life where
[1:56:49] you no more more walking by your own
[1:56:51] human
[1:56:52] strength day in and day out but you can
[1:56:55] now be renewed as the as as the as the
[1:56:58] eagle would renew its youth you can be
[1:57:00] renewed and receive the strength of the
[1:57:03] word of the Lord amen let us just bow
[1:57:06] our heads and close our eyes for a word
[1:57:07] of prayer and we'll be happy if anybody
[1:57:10] would like prayer we'll be happy to pray
[1:57:12] for you we' be happy to do whatever we
[1:57:15] can to help you along your journey in
[1:57:17] this
[1:57:18] hour just open up your heart before him
[1:57:21] you've got to be identified with your
[1:57:23] sacrifice you've got to be identified
[1:57:25] with the word of the Lord that was
[1:57:27] spoken for you spoken for
[1:57:30] you may it become your vision tonight
[1:57:33] and from and from tonight forward may
[1:57:36] you walk by this vision and ask God to
[1:57:38] remove the scales from your eyes that
[1:57:41] you could see with a Clear Vision this
[1:57:44] one that has stepped forward from
[1:57:46] eternity to reveal himself to you you
