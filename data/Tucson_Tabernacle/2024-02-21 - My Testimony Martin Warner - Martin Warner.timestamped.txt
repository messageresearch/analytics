[31:20] [Music]
[31:25] s brother the s Marzulli I don't think
[31:28] we properly introduced him and his his
[31:30] wife I lost her where'd she go oh there
[31:33] you are God bless you sis welcome thank
[31:37] you for coming down and visiting us we
[31:39] appreciate it and then
[31:42] um brother Gabriel Murray bless you my
[31:45] friend it's nice to meet you yesterday
[31:48] brother Gabriel and I were
[31:51] fellowshipping and
[31:53] um just talking about how life sometimes
[31:57] times is hard and uh brother Gabriel was
[32:00] sell was sharing some of his testimony
[32:03] with me and it was just a real blessing
[32:05] and then our brother martin Warner came
[32:08] and and he started fellowshipping with
[32:10] us and then I got up and I left and I I
[32:13] went around and I came back and brother
[32:16] Gabriel had big tears in his eyes and
[32:19] and I heard the last part of brother
[32:21] Martin's
[32:23] testimony and it just blessed me so much
[32:26] I asked him I said brother why don't you
[32:28] just share it you're about to leave and
[32:30] go back home why don't you just share it
[32:31] with the people and I really believe it
[32:34] would be a blessing to them and and of
[32:36] course Brother Martin
[32:38] agreed you know I've met quite a few
[32:40] people over the past couple days that
[32:44] haven't known God that don't know
[32:47] him and I want to encourage I know
[32:50] brother martin that this is this is his
[32:52] life and it's my life but I want to
[32:54] encourage us all that if we meet meet
[32:58] someone to introduce them that gives you
[33:01] the joy in your life and let me tell you
[33:05] if with brother Ed here I can't
[33:07] introduce you to Ed dugall if I don't
[33:10] know Ed dugall
[33:12] myself so same thing with the Lord Jesus
[33:15] I can't int introduce you to Jesus
[33:17] Christ if I don't know Jesus Christ
[33:20] myself so we need to get to know the
[33:22] Lord we need to spend time with him we
[33:25] need to understand his ways we need to
[33:28] get before him and pray so that he knows
[33:31] us and that we know him and then we'll
[33:33] be able to introduce them to Jesus we'll
[33:35] be able to tell people more about the
[33:37] Lord Jesus the better we know so the
[33:41] more time we spend in his presence the
[33:43] more time we spend in his word the more
[33:46] we will be able to introduce someone
[33:49] else to this living Jesus Christ that
[33:53] means so much to all of us that's all
[34:01] Stan I wanted to also mention that
[34:03] sister Amelia called me today our dear
[34:07] little sister that sits here in the
[34:09] front she was very very upset she went
[34:12] to visit her um her mother who um or no
[34:16] it's her sister her older sister
[34:18] that's 90 years old I believe and she's

[45:11] express our love for the fellowship and
[45:14] thank brother Daniel sister
[45:16] Stephanie and you know I wanted to say
[45:19] it's you know it's it's a burden pray
[45:21] for your pastor um you know I've been
[45:23] around a little while so
[45:26] uh as you hear in my testimony uh it's
[45:28] easy to tear things
[45:31] down you know it's easy to tear building
[45:34] down but it's hard to build it it takes
[45:37] a lot of love and and dedication and all
[45:42] those things you know and we we need to
[45:45] support one another and we need to have
[45:48] and I appreciate brother Dan for the
[45:49] vision he has amen without a vision the
[45:52] people
[45:53] perish and and you you need to and we
[45:57] need to fall in line like uh brother
[45:59] hillbrand was my pastor for 38 years and
[46:03] you know he had a vision for Missions he
[46:05] had a vision for for Souls overseas and
[46:07] that's the way God L him and printing
[46:09] books and getting the message out and
[46:12] and we just fell in line with that
[46:14] sister Angela we just fell in line with
[46:17] that as young people we just fell in
[46:18] line we packed books we did this we did
[46:20] that you know we just fell in line with
[46:22] that vision and then God blessed it and
[46:26] you know we had our ups and downs we had
[46:28] our troubles and the prophet said any
[46:30] church that's not having trouble is not
[46:32] making it with
[46:33] God every church has troubles every
[46:36] church has problems amen and and that's
[46:38] how you know you know you're in the will
[46:40] of God sometimes because Satan's
[46:42] fighting you amen so I encourage you
[46:45] tonight to do that get behind the vision
[46:48] of your pastor and uh you know he asked
[46:51] me to take the service tonight and just
[46:53] give my testimony and and I just thought
[46:55] yeah well that's that's the Holy Spirit
[46:58] anything I can do anything I can do to
[47:01] help you know we just want to be a help
[47:03] and and uh I'd encourage you older ones
[47:06] too you know you have a you have a
[47:09] testimony and uh I was quite surprised
[47:12] in Edmonton when I heard some of the
[47:13] older brothers and their testimony it
[47:16] just really encouraged me because they
[47:18] were young people too they came to the
[47:21] Lord and it was miraculous and you know
[47:23] it was it was special and you know it
[47:25] just encouraged me to hear th to hear
[47:27] their testimony so I encourage you older
[47:30] ones too your older Saints you're
[47:32] appreciated and you're loved amen and
[47:35] and you know it's sometimes you don't
[47:37] think you're you're doing much but when
[47:39] you're here amen people are leaning on
[47:41] you they're they're looking at you and
[47:43] leaning on you amen you don't realize it
[47:47] and I remember the ones in in our church
[47:49] and how many years you know and there a
[47:52] lot of them are gone now and I remember
[47:54] just seeing them there just say a few
[47:56] words here hear some wisdom you know
[47:59] it's we've all got something to give
[48:03] amen so I encourage you to do that and
[48:05] uh you know uh do that and pray for one
[48:08] another uh you know the widows that are
[48:11] widows indeed I remember being uh
[48:13] staying at a a Widow's house for three
[48:15] years when I got saved and I learned the
[48:16] importance of prayer and and being a
[48:19] prayer Warrior so there's prayer
[48:21] warriors here you get you get on your
[48:24] knees and pray for the service pray for
[48:26] your pastor amen pray for one another
[48:29] and that's the strength of the church
[48:31] that's how we're strong Saints we can't
[48:33] do it by ourselves brother said we're in
[48:36] this together think if it was your
[48:38] daughter now that passed or my daughter
[48:42] how our hearts would break amen God help
[48:45] us Saints to to feel that love for one
[48:48] another and and put our shoulders to the
[48:50] wheel amen and just just press this
[48:53] battle we're we're on the last stage now
[48:55] Saints we're we're so close now so I
[48:59] wanted to ask you just keep us in prayer
[49:01] for the upcoming travel to Europe and
[49:03] then on to Africa for Easter and a lot
[49:06] of people be coming for those meetings
[49:09] from from many villages and small areas
[49:11] and you know we just just keep that in
[49:13] prayer I'll I'll send D brother Dan a
[49:15] text to remember us uh before the
[49:17] services amen so uh I just wanted to

[49:55] Revelations if you want to stand in
[49:57] chapter 3 we'll just read us a scripture
[49:59] there familiar to all of us I'll try
[50:02] to summarize my my testimony it's it's
[50:07] been a a while since I give my complete
[50:10] testimony but I'll I'll try
[50:12] to give you important parts and uh
[50:16] Revelations chapter 3 verse
[50:19] 14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[50:22] the lat ofans write these things sayith
[50:23] the amen the faithful the true Witness
[50:25] the beginning of the creation of God I
[50:27] Know Thy works that thou are neither
[50:29] cold nor hot but I would that thou were
[50:31] cold or hot so then because Thou Art
[50:34] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[50:36] spew thee out of my mouth amen and we
[50:39] know the prophet talked about that is
[50:43] God would rather see us cold than in a
[50:45] lukewarm
[50:47] condition and he said if we fail to
[50:51] testify and give God glory we'll find
[50:54] ourselves cold old formal and
[50:58] backsliding testify testify to the to
[51:02] the store clerk testify to your
[51:04] schoolmates testify to you know when you
[51:07] get a
[51:08] chance when you get a chance when
[51:10] there's an
[51:11] opportunity take them aside the prophet
[51:14] said there's a better way or you know
[51:16] just as the Lord leads you but
[51:19] testify and and you know all we have to
[51:22] do is pray Lord just give me someone to
[51:24] testify I put some soul in my path amen
[51:29] and he'll do it it's just having the
[51:31] desire so he doesn't want us lukewarm
[51:34] because thou sayest I am rich increase
[51:36] with Goods have need of nothing knowest
[51:38] not that thou are wretched miserable
[51:40] poor blind and naked I counsel thee to
[51:42] buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[51:45] thou mayest be rich and white rment that
[51:48] thou mayest be clothed and the shame of
[51:50] thy nakedness does not appear anoint thy
[51:53] eyes with is have that thou mayest see
[51:56] as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be
[51:58] zealous therefore and repent that's the
[52:01] Zeal of this hour is to repent how many
[52:05] repented to
[52:07] today amen yeah I had to repent today
[52:11] amen that's the Zeal there's nothing you
[52:13] know there's no shame in that that's the
[52:15] Zeal of the
[52:17] Bride behold I stand at the door and
[52:19] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[52:21] the door I will come into him and will
[52:23] Su with him and he with me
[52:25] and the prophet said see it's it's to
[52:27] the
[52:28] individual it's now an individual thing
[52:31] we're a body but it's
[52:33] individual to him that overcometh will I
[52:36] grant to sit in my throne even as I over
[52:38] overcame and sat down with my father in
[52:40] his throne he that has an ear to hear
[52:42] Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto
[52:44] the churches may the Lord bless his word
[52:46] you may be seated I'll just
[52:48] uh just uh go into uh my testimony um as
[52:54] I was was saying we were sharing a
[52:56] little bit yesterday uh at the reception
[52:59] here and uh you know I told the brother
[53:02] I was speaking to it it just always
[53:04] humbles me you know and the prophet
[53:07] preached a message humble
[53:09] yourself and it always humbles me
[53:11] because there's things I'm not not proud
[53:13] of there's things I'm ashamed of and uh
[53:17] there's mistakes I've made and we've all
[53:19] made mistakes but not that we want to
[53:22] give go uh the devil the glory but just
[53:25] you know David said Look Back to the pit
[53:27] where you come
[53:29] from and the hole in the rock where God
[53:32] brought you from and sometimes it's good
[53:34] to look back you know and as I thought
[53:37] about it today brother Dan I was just
[53:39] you know putting putting some of the
[53:41] highlights together here and you know
[53:43] this came to my mind and that came to my
[53:45] mind and God did that and God did that
[53:48] and and I thought wow God's done a lot
[53:50] for me you know we all got something God
[53:54] a testimony is is what is it you said
[53:57] you got to know the person to have a
[53:59] testimony there there has to be uh you
[54:02] know uh an experience there so we all
[54:05] have got that amen and we we need to
[54:07] share if you can't do anything else tell
[54:09] somebody your
[54:10] testimony tell them how the fire got lit
[54:14] am mean you don't need to explain the
[54:15] message or Malachi 4 or Revelations 10
[54:19] you could just say you know God saved me
[54:21] I was a drunker I was a I was an
[54:24] adulterer I was this that and the other
[54:26] I was a
[54:27] thief the Bible said such were some of
[54:30] us amen we we're we're not Angels the
[54:34] prophet said he never made us Angels
[54:37] Angels don't know what it's like to be
[54:39] redeemed but we know Hallelujah I'm so
[54:43] glad I know that tonight I was I was
[54:45] born in 1960 so you know that makes me
[54:48] 64 amen and uh uh I don't feel 64 but my
[54:53] body tells me I'm 64
[54:56] my dad was born in Hartford Connecticut
[54:58] and uh his dad my granddad moved up to
[55:02] uh Eastern Canada Nova Scotia he he met
[55:05] my dad met my mom uh Scottish descent
[55:09] immigrants from Scotland and they
[55:10] married and uh had a had our family
[55:14] there in Nova Scotia which was New
[55:16] Scotland it if you go if you travel to
[55:18] Nova Scotia you'll see it's a lot like
[55:21] Scotland on the ocean there and uh so uh
[55:25] I was uh raised there my parents were
[55:28] heavy
[55:29] Drinkers and uh that's a large part of
[55:31] my testimony they they drank heavily so
[55:34] we we as children were exposed from that
[55:36] to that from our youth and you know we
[55:39] saw you know we saw a lot of the
[55:41] uncertainties in the home financially
[55:43] and and emotionally we we weren't you
[55:46] know we were kind of twisted or or you
[55:49] know bent a little bit because of that
[55:52] when you grow up in a home like that and
[55:55] uh I'm a little bit of a nervous person
[55:57] brother Dan I know you know that I I'm
[56:00] I'm a little bit neurotic I think
[56:02] sometimes I I don't you know I heard the
[56:05] prophet say don't don't let me try to uh
[56:08] explain the type of person I'm in I I am
[56:11] because he said I can't even explain
[56:13] myself you know I don't I don't know why
[56:16] but and I don't know why sometimes we're
[56:18] allowed God allows things to happen uh
[56:22] for a certain
[56:23] reason and it it brings out something
[56:27] also that nothing else can bring out and
[56:31] uh you know I was uh I I was like I said
[56:35] Till I was probably 19 when I left home
[56:38] 1819 I was exposed to that and even
[56:41] though uh you know I hated that I want
[56:43] to say to you young people if you have
[56:46] parents that are believers you pre you
[56:48] should appreciate them you should honor
[56:51] them you should pray for them like the
[56:53] scripture said it'll will give you long
[56:55] days and and goodness of life and
[56:59] blessings even just the natural
[57:01] blessings that'll come on you for doing
[57:04] that amen I I you know I look back and I
[57:07] said wow what if my parents had have
[57:09] been messaged Believers you know and had
[57:12] had the Bible out and you know the only
[57:14] time we took the Bible was when we were
[57:16] lying then then Dad would say put your
[57:18] hand on that Bible and swear to
[57:21] me
[57:23] whoa you know and then we knew we were
[57:25] going to die that we're going to die if
[57:27] we we lie this time and you know that
[57:30] but that's the only thing the only thing
[57:32] we I remember looking at the pictures in
[57:34] the Bible but well this looks Holy
[57:37] Angels and all that but didn't know
[57:40] anything about it just went to church
[57:43] just went to mass did the Stations of
[57:45] the Cross but there was a thirst in my
[57:48] heart all the time there was a thirst
[57:51] there but I didn't know how to fill it I
[57:53] didn't know what it was so anyway we we
[57:56] we were raised in that and uh I hated it
[57:59] but I fell into the same cycle of coping
[58:01] you know that's what people do it for
[58:03] you know the prophet preached a message
[58:05] letting off the pressure and that's what
[58:07] my mom and dad would do they let off the
[58:09] pressure on the weekends and sometimes
[58:11] for a week and fights and everything
[58:14] else like just terrible terrible the
[58:17] things I've saw as a kid it just it just
[58:20] emotionally it it it scarred me
[58:23] emotionally and and and and you know I
[58:25] didn't know how to cope with it and I
[58:27] fell into the same thing because it's a
[58:30] spirit isn't it common yeah and I didn't
[58:33] know the psychology of it or anything I
[58:35] just knew I was UN I was bound by the
[58:37] same thing that I
[58:38] hated I remember I remember going to bed
[58:41] crying at night just you know see my my
[58:44] mom and dad fighting and physical abuse
[58:46] and all those things I just I just hated
[58:49] it you know and I I I would just cry
[58:52] myself to sleep sometimes and uh just
[58:55] and yet you know I fell under that same
[58:57] thing because that's all I
[58:59] knew that's how I knew but they were
[59:03] they were Catholics they went to church
[59:06] you know and they they thought salvation
[59:07] was coming in the church being part of
[59:10] the church is salvation it's not I know
[59:13] coming here is not amen it's not
[59:16] salvation it's a personal revelation of
[59:19] Jesus Christ to you and me amen and
[59:22] meeting meeting that person
[59:25] like I told my sister I just got saved
[59:28] and I told her two weeks before she died
[59:31] I just told her I said Kathy I said I
[59:34] met Jesus Christ the man he's
[59:37] real it's you know all this Born Again
[59:40] stuff we heard about I said Kathy it's
[59:42] real she said Martin I'm so happy for
[59:45] you I think you found what you were
[59:48] looking for amen and and two weeks later
[59:50] she went off to scene and that's her
[59:53] testimony to me amen so I I believe I'll
[59:56] see her there brother Dan she'll be
[59:58] there amen so I started to get so
[1:00:01] depressed as a teenager in high school
[1:00:04] you know there was one time there was a
[1:00:05] man visiting my home and he was from the
[1:00:08] country and those old Scots you know
[1:00:09] they get together and and drink even uh
[1:00:12] moonshine and stuff like that you know
[1:00:14] it was uh and I just you know he'd been
[1:00:16] in he'd been in our house and and my mom
[1:00:19] was there my dad was away and I I just
[1:00:21] felt real bad you know that he was there
[1:00:23] and I out behind the house and I was
[1:00:26] just sawing some wood and all of a
[1:00:28] sudden I felt a
[1:00:31] presence and I can't I couldn't explain
[1:00:34] it to you if if I tried with a thousand
[1:00:36] words but it was like there was there
[1:00:39] was something here watching me someone
[1:00:42] here watching me a being and I couldn't
[1:00:44] I just kept looking around I thought
[1:00:46] someone was spying on me but I just felt
[1:00:48] this presence come down brother Dan all
[1:00:51] around me just like arms and I just felt
[1:00:55] oh my what is what is that and I so I
[1:00:58] then I quickly walked in the house and
[1:01:00] this man that was there he looked at me
[1:01:02] and he kind of like looked at me he said
[1:01:05] that boy will be a preacher
[1:01:09] someday a
[1:01:12] drunk he said that boy will be a a
[1:01:14] priest or a preacher
[1:01:17] someday and I didn't I didn't know what
[1:01:19] to do with that I just you know there's
[1:01:21] things in your life you remember and you
[1:01:23] think that was something I'd forgot and
[1:01:27] and and you think that was at the time
[1:01:29] that was very odd and so God has a plan
[1:01:33] that's all I want to say God has a plan
[1:01:36] and it might not be preaching it might
[1:01:39] might be this might be that you know but
[1:01:41] God has a plan to use you Amen to to to
[1:01:45] spread the the Gospel of Jesus Christ to
[1:01:49] win souls Amen to encourage the body to
[1:01:53] be a part of the body of Christ if we're
[1:01:55] just a fingernail or a toenail or
[1:01:58] whatever we are a prayer
[1:02:00] Warrior amen that's so important amen
[1:02:03] and so I I I just put that you know in
[1:02:05] the back of my mind but uh you know the
[1:02:08] drinking went on and I drank as a
[1:02:10] teenager at a high school but the
[1:02:12] scripture warns against it said W wine
[1:02:15] is a mocker Proverbs 20 strong drink is
[1:02:18] Raging and whoever who whosoever is
[1:02:21] deceived thereby is not
[1:02:23] wise
[1:02:26] it is it is not for Kings o limo it is
[1:02:29] not for Kings to drink wine nor princes
[1:02:31] to drink strong drink lest they drink
[1:02:33] and forget the law and pervert the
[1:02:36] Judgment give strong drink to them that
[1:02:38] are ready to perish and whine to those
[1:02:40] that are heavy hearts let him drink and
[1:02:42] forget his poverty and remember his
[1:02:44] misery no
[1:02:46] more you know so uh it can be a deceiver
[1:02:51] and and you know Satan with alcohol it's
[1:02:54] it's a
[1:02:55] counterfeit it's just a counterfeit for
[1:02:57] the stimulation of Revelation the wine
[1:03:01] of the word amen it's only a counterfeit
[1:03:04] and you know Satan makes you feel like
[1:03:05] oh you're with with the crowd you're in
[1:03:07] The In Crowd you're going to the same
[1:03:09] parties and and you know you you you got
[1:03:11] no worries no troubles and you forget
[1:03:13] all your problems and you forget all the
[1:03:16] dysfunction at home you know and that's
[1:03:19] that's the Trap that he sets and he's
[1:03:22] he's a master at it and young people
[1:03:24] today he's he's doing it maybe a
[1:03:26] different way he's doing on social media
[1:03:29] there's peer pressure there's all those
[1:03:32] kinds of things you know people get
[1:03:34] hooked on addicted to and I I I I just
[1:03:36] read recently a young man here in the
[1:03:38] states he uh he got on Facebook and
[1:03:41] posted some stuff about himself that he
[1:03:43] shouldn't have posted some pictures and
[1:03:45] then some some man from
[1:03:47] Nigeria blackmailed him and he ended up
[1:03:50] committing
[1:03:51] suicide you know Satan's got traps and
[1:03:54] if it's not one way it's another he
[1:03:56] wants to destroy young people in their
[1:03:59] youth and he's out to destroy you too
[1:04:02] young people I hope this helps you I
[1:04:05] hope you feel warned tonight that Satan
[1:04:07] has a trap but God has a
[1:04:09] plan amen Satan has a trap but God has a
[1:04:13] plan amen so I I just kept uh going on
[1:04:16] you know and uh after those experiences
[1:04:19] I you know I did get very dep depressed
[1:04:23] so depressed that I I felt like I wanted
[1:04:25] to die I wanted to get out of it and uh
[1:04:29] one night I I thought I decided to do
[1:04:31] that and and I was drinking and you know
[1:04:35] uh there's been several people in my
[1:04:36] community had died in in the straight of
[1:04:39] Cano which is a body of water that goes
[1:04:42] from the island to the mainland that
[1:04:44] people try to swim and they don't make
[1:04:46] it because of the currents and and I
[1:04:48] just decided to that I was going to try
[1:04:51] that and before I went though I thought
[1:04:53] I'm going to see my my best friend
[1:04:55] because I only had one friend that I
[1:04:57] really considered a friend and I wanted
[1:04:59] to see him for some reason I just wanted
[1:05:01] to see his face and I went to his house
[1:05:03] where his sister lived and she said no
[1:05:06] he's not here and uh I I'm here by
[1:05:08] myself but uh she said you look terrible
[1:05:11] what's what's the problem what's wrong
[1:05:13] with you I said nothing I was hiding it
[1:05:16] and uh she said come in come in come in
[1:05:18] for a minute so we sat down and she
[1:05:21] could see there was there was something
[1:05:23] definitely wrong wrong and uh I was
[1:05:25] determined what I was going to do and
[1:05:28] she said you know Martin she was a she
[1:05:30] was not a person that You' uh she didn't
[1:05:33] have a good reputation in town I'll put
[1:05:35] it that way and and she uh you know
[1:05:38] you'd maybe you'd call her a Rahab or
[1:05:40] something like that but you know here I
[1:05:42] am sitting with her and in in the house
[1:05:44] and she said you know Martin she said
[1:05:46] when I get I get feeling like you do
[1:05:48] said I I read this and she pulled out a
[1:05:52] little bible
[1:05:54] and she you know Catholics don't do that
[1:05:58] and she pulled out a little Bible and
[1:05:59] she read me something and I forget what
[1:06:02] it was but when she read that Bible that
[1:06:06] spirit of suicide just lifted right off
[1:06:08] of
[1:06:08] me it was gone and I thought that was
[1:06:12] stupid what would I do that for what
[1:06:15] would I end my life for and it was just
[1:06:18] it's it's like a cloud and and an
[1:06:20] oppression that comes and you know you
[1:06:23] just you can't you you have no way out
[1:06:25] there seems to be no way out so anyway
[1:06:28] God delivered me there after I got saved
[1:06:30] I went back to her brother Dan and I I
[1:06:33] bought her a Bible a real Bible and I
[1:06:37] put her name on it to Kathy McDougle my
[1:06:42] friend amen I thought you know God used
[1:06:45] her you know God puts people in your
[1:06:48] life and I I I I really believe that
[1:06:51] she'll have a reward on on the other
[1:06:54] side and and I I know she's been
[1:06:56] rewarded since then
[1:06:58] too but things like that would you know
[1:07:01] just I tried a few times but it failed
[1:07:04] and and just Satan is like a roaring
[1:07:07] lion seeking he whom he may devour and
[1:07:11] to take you out before God can use you
[1:07:15] so I ran away amen I I I finished trade
[1:07:17] school I uh got my trade in power
[1:07:20] engineering and uh got in trouble few
[1:07:24] times with the law and it was just my
[1:07:26] marks in school and and my parents that
[1:07:29] just I I didn't go to reform school or
[1:07:32] whatever because I hung with the wrong
[1:07:34] crowd and uh so you know like I said
[1:07:37] Saints there some of these things that
[1:07:39] humble me uh I'm not proud of them but
[1:07:42] you know we look back to where we come
[1:07:46] from and give God the glory amen and uh
[1:07:50] you know he he's used me around the
[1:07:52] world to give this same testimony and
[1:07:55] souls have gotten saved people have come
[1:07:58] to the Lord amen so I promise the Lord I
[1:08:02] would make it
[1:08:04] somehow and I've traveled too far to
[1:08:06] turn back now amen so God has a plan and
[1:08:10] you know we can never stop it I ran away
[1:08:12] from home 31 about 3,100 miles from
[1:08:15] Eastern Canada to western Canada and as
[1:08:17] I was driving into the city in western
[1:08:19] Canada on a bus I saw a sign on a green
[1:08:22] elevator that said what shall I profit a
[1:08:24] man if he gain the whole world and lose
[1:08:27] his
[1:08:28] soul I'd never seen that before I'd
[1:08:31] never knew that scripture and here it is
[1:08:34] just staring at me when I'm going by and
[1:08:36] I'm looking at it thinking well that
[1:08:39] must mean something you know people are
[1:08:41] going to have to
[1:08:42] answer for those Witnesses those
[1:08:45] Billboards and those signs you see along
[1:08:47] the road they'll have to answer for
[1:08:49] those things amen they'll have to answer
[1:08:51] for seeing God in nature
[1:08:54] death burial and Resurrection everything
[1:08:57] preaches the gospel amen and you know
[1:08:59] it's hard to fight your way to
[1:09:02] hell it's hard it's A Hard Road and you
[1:09:06] have to fight your way to hell because
[1:09:07] heaven made a
[1:09:09] barricade amen and we have to climb over
[1:09:11] the cross trampled of blood you know and
[1:09:15] I I just thought boy all these things
[1:09:17] you know I ended up just working there
[1:09:20] in western Canada for a while and you
[1:09:23] know um my brother had a friend that
[1:09:26] asked me if if I if I could stay with
[1:09:29] him and I ended up working in the in the
[1:09:31] power plants of of Big Oil industrial
[1:09:34] companies and uh you know for power
[1:09:37] generation that was my trade and and but
[1:09:40] still I was thirsting see alcohol is a
[1:09:44] thirst and you feel it because your soul
[1:09:48] is
[1:09:48] thirsting and and we we didn't know that
[1:09:51] the prophet preached a message thirst
[1:09:54] a our brother Ed saying As the
[1:09:57] deer panth for the water so my soul
[1:10:00] panth after thee Oh God and I didn't
[1:10:04] realize that and I don't think people
[1:10:06] out there today realize that but uh the
[1:10:09] brother let me my brother's friend let
[1:10:11] me stay with him and I was working in a
[1:10:13] in the industry and uh I I I ended up at
[1:10:17] his place and I had a dream and my
[1:10:20] families are my family is is Dre I would
[1:10:25] say dreamers but they dream a lot and I
[1:10:28] had this dream and it was so vivid that
[1:10:30] I saw this great huge Beast like a
[1:10:34] dragon and he was on a sea of glass and
[1:10:37] he was and people were running for their
[1:10:39] lives and he was scooping them up and
[1:10:41] squashing them and killing them and uh
[1:10:44] you know it was just chaos and murder
[1:10:47] and and uh it was so visive that it just
[1:10:49] repeated and repeated and repeated all
[1:10:52] night I woke up the next day and I said
[1:10:53] said wow what a nightmare and all of a
[1:10:56] sudden I just felt that's something told
[1:10:58] me that's the end of the world that'll
[1:11:01] be what the end of the world would be
[1:11:03] like and I thought I wanted to I didn't
[1:11:06] want to tell my brother's friend because
[1:11:08] I thought well he'd think I was crazy
[1:11:11] you know I just I just thought that that
[1:11:13] was and I felt like that was going to
[1:11:16] happen in my lifetime and and what came
[1:11:18] to me was I need to be ready for that
[1:11:21] you know nothing knowing nothing about
[1:11:23] the scripture nothing about a prophet
[1:11:24] nothing about the end time you know I
[1:11:27] thought life was going to go on it was
[1:11:28] one big party but you know what when I
[1:11:31] when that happened that was I need to be
[1:11:35] ready and I just that thirst got how do
[1:11:38] I find that where do I go you know I
[1:11:41] didn't think I could find it in religion
[1:11:43] so I just I just left that job and and
[1:11:47] uh went running away again and you know
[1:11:51] but that did shake me and I met some
[1:11:53] people in Edmonton that were with Youth
[1:11:55] for Christ at the YMCA and they asked me
[1:11:58] about you know if I'd like to stay on a
[1:11:59] farm for young people I was about 20
[1:12:02] years old and and that uh for Youth and
[1:12:06] they were Christians and they were good
[1:12:07] people and you know they they they did a
[1:12:10] lot for me and but it was a stepping
[1:12:12] stone for me but still that organized
[1:12:14] religion and that religion they they had
[1:12:17] and all the good works they did and I I
[1:12:19] thought you know that's not it that's
[1:12:21] not what I need that's not what I'm
[1:12:23] looking for you know you can't make it
[1:12:25] to heaven on good works and so I knew
[1:12:28] that and they had brought us to some
[1:12:30] different churches and I was exposed to
[1:12:32] maybe they go to a Baptist Church one
[1:12:34] week and and a Pentecostal in the next
[1:12:35] and and the Pentecostal one there was a
[1:12:38] preacher there and uh he was praying for
[1:12:40] people uh in the front at the altar and
[1:12:43] and uh he he he just came by me and he
[1:12:46] and he put his hand over me and he never
[1:12:49] touched me but he put his hand over me
[1:12:51] and it was like brother Dan the first
[1:12:52] time I experienced anything like that it
[1:12:54] was like a 10,000 volts just I just
[1:12:58] about went down you know I just it was
[1:13:01] it was a some kind of Supernatural
[1:13:04] anointing that was
[1:13:06] there and you know and and then what he
[1:13:09] was what they were wanting is that then
[1:13:11] speak in tongues and then you're filled
[1:13:12] with the Holy Ghost well it didn't come
[1:13:14] into me I didn't open myself up to to it
[1:13:17] but I knew there was a power there and
[1:13:20] so that that's another thing I put kind
[1:13:23] of in my pocket but I was still
[1:13:25] thirsting that didn't satisfy so you
[1:13:28] know I I continued my my drinking and uh
[1:13:31] the life of you know pleasure and sin
[1:13:34] for a season at 20 years old and uh I
[1:13:37] went I went into this weekend I went
[1:13:40] into a bar a club and the the the club's
[1:13:44] name was

[1:14:00] this music and and drinking and rry and
[1:14:04] you know and and that was on a Friday

[1:14:50] night yes it was that Friday night after
[1:14:53] after or Saturday that I was in
[1:14:56] Lucifer's that I was so sick I was
[1:14:59] laying on a bed in the YMCA and with had
[1:15:02] nothing to eat for three days and I I
[1:15:05] was I basically had alcohol poisoning
[1:15:10] and uh I fell into a trance what they
[1:15:12] call DTS but to me it was different than
[1:15:15] that I felt like I left my body and I
[1:15:18] went into this darkness and I knew I was
[1:15:21] going down down down sinking down and I
[1:15:25] and and I it just felt like the bottom
[1:15:27] was never there and finally I came to
[1:15:30] this place and there was a bright light
[1:15:33] and it was a fire a literal fire I can
[1:15:36] still see the flames in that fire and I
[1:15:39] was on and I was like on a on a on a
[1:15:43] rotisserie thing and I was going over
[1:15:46] that fire and the fire was just intense
[1:15:50] but you couldn't die you couldn't die
[1:15:53] die from it you just were tortured and
[1:15:55] that's what Satan is young people that's
[1:15:57] what he's got the the wages of sin is
[1:16:00] death but the gift of God is eternal
[1:16:03] life amen and I I I was going over and
[1:16:06] over in that thing and and then I saw
[1:16:08] women come to me they had no clothes on
[1:16:10] and they would just
[1:16:11] Decay when they come up to me they would
[1:16:14] decay in front of me and and it was like
[1:16:17] the smell of death all around me and and
[1:16:21] and and I couldn't communicate with no
[1:16:23] one and no one could communicate with me
[1:16:25] you know when you go to that place
[1:16:27] you're
[1:16:28] alone you can't
[1:16:30] communicate and and the worm doesn't die
[1:16:33] and the fire is never
[1:16:34] extinguished it's a real place people
[1:16:37] think you know nobody goes to hell these
[1:16:39] days everybody preaches everybody into
[1:16:41] heaven no there's a literal hell there's
[1:16:44] a literal burning fire there's a
[1:16:46] demension of the lost and we know that
[1:16:49] better than anyone
[1:16:50] else you know uh
[1:16:54] those women I remember seeing a woman
[1:16:57] out here on the street and the and the
[1:17:00] and the look of Terror and fear on their
[1:17:04] faces and I just saw a woman on the
[1:17:06] street there yesterday was just
[1:17:08] yesterday and I felt so bad for her she
[1:17:11] looked at me and she had this Terror on
[1:17:14] her face like a just like I saw just
[1:17:17] just before I give this testimony now
[1:17:19] just like I'd saw back there you know
[1:17:22] where we at Saints we are so close we
[1:17:26] are preaching to the souls that are in
[1:17:28] prison
[1:17:29] now amen and you know we we got to do if
[1:17:32] there's one
[1:17:33] Lord you know Abraham said if there's 10
[1:17:36] but if there's one Lord Lord save that
[1:17:39] one send out a send someone to to get
[1:17:43] them amen and uh so I I was in that
[1:17:47] place and I I cried out for God and I
[1:17:49] think some of you know that part of my
[1:17:51] testimony I cried out for God
[1:17:53] no I didn't cry out for God excuse me I
[1:17:55] cried out for my
[1:17:57] parents see I cried out for my mom and
[1:17:59] my dad but they weren't there I cried
[1:18:02] out to my one of my best friends and he
[1:18:05] wasn't there you I was alone there was
[1:18:09] no one to cry out to and I I I you know
[1:18:12] it didn't it didn't even dawn on me in
[1:18:14] in that state to to ask God until I
[1:18:18] realized I'm not getting out of here and
[1:18:21] I I had an awareness Saints
[1:18:24] and God is my judge I had an awareness
[1:18:26] that my body was there but I couldn't
[1:18:28] get
[1:18:30] back What a Feeling what a terrible
[1:18:33] feeling and the prophet screamed out
[1:18:35] what a terrible thing to be lost heading
[1:18:38] for the Falls what a terrible place what
[1:18:42] a dreadful place to be in and you know
[1:18:45] and and so I cried out finally I said oh
[1:18:49] God oh God if you'll help me' I'll
[1:18:53] change
[1:18:55] tomorrow I promise you I vow I promise
[1:18:58] you I'll change tomorrow well I started
[1:19:00] to feel that I was coming back and I
[1:19:03] remember just waking up really like not
[1:19:07] even realizing like oh I I'm not in that
[1:19:09] place that was a nightmare that was that
[1:19:12] was something really different like that
[1:19:14] was so real so
[1:19:17] vivid and uh my bed was soaked with
[1:19:21] sweat like I had sweat so profusely from
[1:19:25] the alcohol was probably alcohol
[1:19:27] poisoning so I didn't realize that but
[1:19:30] my heart was there was such a pain in my
[1:19:32] heart a sharp pain that I thought I was
[1:19:35] going to take a heart attack and you
[1:19:37] know I I just I just said oh God thank
[1:19:40] God I'm
[1:19:41] alive I'm not in that place so I I I I
[1:19:45] quickly got up got dressed and no sooner
[1:19:48] I get
[1:19:51] dressed I heard to knock on the door and
[1:19:54] I always say Jesus knocked on my
[1:19:57] door A young man that was a backslid

[1:22:32] salvation and uh you know I went to
[1:22:34] dinner with some Believers that day that
[1:22:37] were uh in the church sister Angel you
[1:22:39] might know brother gun brother Gideon's
[1:22:42] father who uh witnessed to me a Chinese

[1:23:04] words were just jumping in my heart this
[1:23:07] is the truth this is what I need to do
[1:23:10] so I said yeah I said yeah I I'd like
[1:23:12] I'd like to get baptized he said okay I
[1:23:15] I tell I tell the preacher so they
[1:23:18] brother Harold was aware of it he was
[1:23:19] preaching that night and uh the whole
[1:23:22] time he was preaching he was preaching
[1:23:24] on The Crow and the dove the nature and
[1:23:27] and and I felt like I was the crow
[1:23:30] sitting in with all of the doves like
[1:23:32] these people are holy you know like
[1:23:34] they're they're good people like what am
[1:23:37] I doing here and and and this devil sat
[1:23:39] on one side and said you better get out
[1:23:40] of
[1:23:41] here you you don't belong here and and
[1:23:45] this the angel on this side said no stay
[1:23:47] there this is the truth and so it was
[1:23:49] yes no yes no I was numb after a while I
[1:23:53] was like what do I do and then all of a
[1:23:56] sudden the sermon ends and brother
[1:23:57] hillbrand I never forget it brother
[1:24:00] Dan uh he said does anyone have anything
[1:24:04] to
[1:24:05] say like he never ever opened it up for
[1:24:08] testimonies after the service never one
[1:24:12] time in 38 years do I ever see him do
[1:24:14] that again but he said does anyone have
[1:24:17] anything to say before I knew it I was
[1:24:19] on my feet I said listen I'm I'm the guy
[1:24:21] that was supposed to get baptized but
[1:24:22] said you know I can't I can't go through
[1:24:24] with this you know there's there's 100
[1:24:26] 200 people and I'm
[1:24:29] thinking why why am I standing up
[1:24:31] talking to all these people just this is
[1:24:35] you know I was numb and and he said well
[1:24:38] brother he said we don't force anyone to
[1:24:40] get baptized here we don't pressure
[1:24:43] anyone but he said you can go with the
[1:24:46] deacons and they can read the scripture
[1:24:48] to you if you decide you want to get
[1:24:50] baptized the tank is here so they
[1:24:52] they they brought me to uh Romans
[1:24:55] chapter 6 as we're buried with him in
[1:24:59] baptism as we are buried with Christ and
[1:25:01] baptism do you know that when you got
[1:25:03] baptized you were buried with Jesus
[1:25:07] Christ you know that's so
[1:25:09] profound and the prophet said because
[1:25:13] you were in him when he rose you Rose
[1:25:17] and the power of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:25:18] in you will raise yourself up he said in
[1:25:22] the resurrection if you go by the way of
[1:25:24] the Grave so when they said that that
[1:25:27] just put the nail in it you know I put
[1:25:30] the nail in Satan's coffin Hallelujah it
[1:25:34] put the nail in Satan's coffin because I
[1:25:36] knew two is a witness right so I knew so
[1:25:39] anyway I uh I I I was baptized that
[1:25:43] night in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:46] Christ and uh uh had a had a wonderful
[1:25:50] experience it took some time you know uh
[1:25:53] the prophet
[1:25:54] priest uh justification sanctification
[1:25:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost and uh I
[1:25:59] wasn't I wasn't quite clean yet that God
[1:26:03] had to do some some work on me and clean
[1:26:07] out some things and I might have sat in
[1:26:09] the church for maybe three four weeks
[1:26:13] and you know I I I I I just was faith
[1:26:17] comes by hearing hearing by the word and
[1:26:20] uh you know I I one day they were
[1:26:22] preaching on uh Holiness brother
[1:26:25] hillbrand and he was talking about 1
[1:26:27] Corinthians 11 and he said if a man have
[1:26:30] short hair you know if a man have long
[1:26:33] hair it's a shame to him and I had sat
[1:26:35] there for a while with long hair and I
[1:26:37] never thought nothing of it I never
[1:26:38] thought the Bible said anything about it
[1:26:41] it wasn't like legalism I just thought
[1:26:43] and then I looked around oh yeah I'm
[1:26:45] kind of the only one around here like
[1:26:48] like I'm I'm kind of a standing out and
[1:26:50] then I had these corduroy pant pants on
[1:26:53] that were uh designer pants and they
[1:26:55] were real tight on the back with no
[1:26:58] pockets and and and when when the
[1:27:01] preacher was preaching he said and these
[1:27:03] these designers these homosexual
[1:27:05] designers he said they they make these
[1:27:07] pants with no pockets in the back I knew
[1:27:10] he couldn't see my
[1:27:12] pockets but I I just kind of felt back
[1:27:15] from my pocket no it's not there so I
[1:27:18] thought well I'm getting rid of these
[1:27:20] that's for sure and you know what next
[1:27:22] next week I'm going to get a I'm going
[1:27:23] to get a
[1:27:24] haircut and I said if I look like a
[1:27:27] monkey which I look like a monkey with
[1:27:30] the long
[1:27:31] hair but I said if I look like a monkey
[1:27:33] I'm G to get my if that's what the Bible
[1:27:35] says you see the message is not legalism
[1:27:38] Saints the message just is just obeying
[1:27:41] full obedience to every word of God
[1:27:44] entitles you to the Token so take those
[1:27:47] steps and as I took those
[1:27:50] steps God then came with the baptism of
[1:27:54] the Holy Ghost but it was a
[1:27:57] process and uh I'd like to say you know
[1:28:00] I think it's 8:30 is it now we start at
[1:28:02] 7
[1:28:04] 8 I'd like to say my testimony ended
[1:28:07] there and but you know I open that door
[1:28:11] and you're the only one that can open
[1:28:14] that door my experience will be
[1:28:15] different from you but you remember when
[1:28:17] God knocks on your door sometimes he'll
[1:28:20] knock on your door you you don't have to
[1:28:22] be an
[1:28:23] alcoholic it might be it might be
[1:28:26] another pressure it might be another
[1:28:28] oppression or it might be something else
[1:28:30] that you need to answer that door and
[1:28:33] let Jesus Christ into your heart it's so
[1:28:36] simple isn't it salvation it's so simple
[1:28:40] you know I didn't knew nothing about a
[1:28:42] prophet nothing about Malachi 4 The
[1:28:44] Prophet's name was being mentioned but I
[1:28:46] never even heard
[1:28:47] it it was just like I walked into the
[1:28:49] Bible and these people had the holy
[1:28:52] ghost that's why I say you older ones

[1:31:00] to get me to to actually do that but uh

[1:33:08] and I and I read I was reading in the
[1:33:10] message perfect faith and the prophet
[1:33:12] was talking about a guy testifying to
[1:33:15] his his friends at in the boiler room he
[1:33:17] said about his wife because he was a new
[1:33:20] Christian his wife said honey it must be
[1:33:22] hard you you were in an alcoholic family

[1:33:56] Spirit you'll become a bum you'll be a
[1:33:59] homeless person and you'll be among the

[1:42:25] shared when it came down to life and
[1:42:29] death before a
[1:42:32] grippa Paul stood
