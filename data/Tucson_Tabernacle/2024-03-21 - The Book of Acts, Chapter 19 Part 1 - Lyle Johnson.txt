soul cast now God's Mercy River of my life brother Daniel's gonna take the prayer request my brother took my father to to the doctors for a checkup and this was the report and I just want to read that he had an EKG which shows he has afib or atrial celebration I said the condition is an irregular often rapid heart rate that causes poor blood flow heart thinners can be prescribed but if he falls or Cuts himself the cause of excessive bleeding so there is a it's a procedure which implants a device but it doesn't always work so the option is to continue just watching how many scheduled for an echo on August 2nd and then see the car cardiologist again show my dad my dad when you see him he's happy and all but I know it's frustrating too to be not be able to do all the things he he wished and the other day he was getting out of the bed he fell he mom can't help him get up sometimes so but I saw him today for just a few minutes and he was more himself today but our hearts say even so come quickly Lord Jesus so feel Stan brother Daniel will take the request timing [Music] God bless you all it feels good to be in the house of the Lord as always for the Eli and family God bless you my friends good it's good to see you again I have a little testimony I was um Sunday night after service I was uh as I was ministering I I felt I felt something kind of funny as as I was preaching and and uh kind of bothered me and then after service as always I love The Fellowship of the kids so we had a we had a bunch of the kids around us and Brother Andy was there and the kids were asking these questions and I'll tell you what I'm so proud of our young people and how advanced they are and the questions that they were asking were just they were really Andy they were adult questions weren't they just really good questions so I left um I left service that night and I I was still feeling funny and I prayed about it and and I thought I knew what it was and and then the next morning I I went to my office and I was praying about in my office and and I said Lord there's there's something there's something wrong and um I was so I went to acts and uh I read acts 18 and I said Lord is there did I say something wrong so I was going through acts 18 and I got down to um verse number eight and it says this and Christmas the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptized and as I was researching and ministering on this I said that this Christmas I said he probably wasn't a Jew he was probably someone that was just in charge of the synagogue and I felt like the Lord said you were wrong and uh so I found some of the the research that I did and I went a little bit more and and I did I said something wrong that Crispus was in fact I believe he was very much a Greek Jew believer that was in charge of that synagogue so I just friends I always want to be sensitive to the spirit and if I say something wrong it may not seem like it's that important but this is God's word that we are handling up here and I always want to make sure that I'm handling it with the most reverence and and I never never want to make a mistake I'll make mistakes but I never want to so I wanted wanted to give the church that little testimony how the the Lord did and I felt something remember when I said it and I kept ministering and then afterwards the uh some of the kids were talking and and one of them asked a question and uh she said something on the order of no this isn't Verbatim what if the pastor is preaching something that's not true and I said I told her I said well my message this morning was that you have to have a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and you cannot rely on anyone to take that place between you and him there is one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus and it is so important it's the most important thing in the world that we have our own relationship and if you get anything from my Ministry I pray to God that it will be that you need to meet him because if you're relying on someone else it's going to be sub par it's it's not going to be good enough it has to be Jesus Christ um so this Sunday I asked the church to uh sister we can we'll get to the prayer request now go ahead thank you um ask the church that uh I mentioned on the WhatsApp that I'm going to be ministering on Friday in um in Las Cruces or in I'm sorry in Silver City New Mexico so on Friday so please pray for me that the Lord will give me the right things to say and that I can be an encouragement to the people in those meetings that they could see a Jesus Christ they could see Jesus Christ in me and that that if they don't have that relationship with Christ that I will say something to encourage it sister Amelia texted me that her and her daughter are suffering with pain in their legs and she asked if we would pray for her brother Elijah Murray brother Paul texted me and he asked if we would pray for little Elijah that he has a fever he's not feeling well so if we pray for the little boy and then um sister Rachel Guerra writes please remember my daughter Rachel in prayer she has not been feeling well for a few days and then brother Silas Lindsey he's not feeling well and his feet are bad tonight if we could pray for him and I think that is all the prayer requests I have so it's Bauer heads God bless you brothers and sisters I pray that if you would have a request that you would have that relationship with the Lord Jesus and you would be able to to let him know but I also know that the Prophet Daniel in the Bible when there was a great problem in the land of Babylon and Nebuchadnezzar was about to kill all of all of these men that Daniel asked his friends Shadrach Meshach and have been to go to pray [Music] so we can ask each other to pray and as we have our heads bowed if you would ever request on your heart and if you would raise your hand in the Living God that's in heaven now will look down and see these raised hands and knows what's under those hands Lord God Almighty Lord we raise our hands is in obedience and father humbly request that you would answer every prayer and every every need that we would have and Lord the requests that I brought before you tonight that you would answer them as brother Aaron pray his brother Aaron asked also a prayer for his dad I want to pray for him sister Amelia and her daughter brother Elijah sister Rachel brother Silas [Music] Lord each one I pray that you would touch them Lord God that Lord that your will would be done father that your healing hand would come down please I pray Lord may we just lift our prayers up before you in Thanksgiving also and in love and appreciation for the breath that you've given us today in the life Lord the the homes that you've given us the families that you've given us the children the parents the brothers and sisters Lord we never want to neglect the things that we see every day we never want to neglect to thank you we love you Lord again we approach you and we bring these requests before you in the name above all names the name of Jesus Christ God bless you all [Music] I came to sing I came to love you [Music] oh Hallelujah [Music] hallelujah oh how I worship you you are my Lord I Came To Worship You I came to sing your praise I Came To Love You Lord your Holy Name to reign Hallelujah [Music] hallelujah oh how I worship you you are my Lord I Came To Worship you I came to sing your praise I came to love you your Holy Name to Reigns Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah oh how I worship you you are my Lord [Music] good evening before we let our musicians rest I'd like us to also sing it's the life behind the name as a Prelude to our lesson tonight [Music] it's the life behind the name that makes the demons trouble if the life behind the land that makes the proud heart Uncle it was God who devised the flag that in all things as a man he would live so he could give give us the light behind the name it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind the name that makes a proud heart humble it was God who divides the plan that in all things as a man he would live so he could give give us the life behind the name thank you so much I I was a little slow up here I wanted to be sure you saw my title slide and now we'll advance past that okay so please be seated tonight it's our privilege to continue our study the book of Acts this time we'll be considering Acts chapter 19. there are so many topics included in this chapter we could probably spend every service this month maybe every night this month digging into one after the other baptism adversity being a faithful witness bringing people from acknowledgment of Christ to the infilling of the spirit patience idol worship insincerity in our faith in fact there's too much here to cover in one Wednesday evening service but brother Daniel is graciously indicated I could take more than one service to share Acts 19 with you and this morning I realized that's what I needed to do so with your patient acceptance this is part one I hope you're not in a hurry to get through the book of Acts while you're seated and before we start there's an item I want to address before we dig into Acts 19. after acts 16 your brother came up and asked me after service what's this big deal about Roman citizenship so he was a Roman so what and he wanted to know what was going on there and I looked at him and I said brother I don't have a clue I don't know I'm not going to pretend if I don't know I'm not going to try and vent myself look at it and say oh well it's probably this or maybe it's that I don't know but a question that's asked deserves an answer so I spent some time researching it a quick summary is that Roman citizens had special rights under Roman law they could not be punished without a trial which was the problem which Paul pointed out for the magistrates and Philippi in Acts 16. certain punishments were pro-scribed were forbidden a Roman could not be crucified for example if a Roman was assessed a penalty of death he could in theory choose to go into Exile rather than be executed a Roman could not be whipped or tortured as part of an examination or interrogation this was a common occurrence and therefore a valuable protection we'll see Paul raise this point towards the end of Acts 22. Roman citizens could vote and hold certain offices a female Roman citizen could own property and run a business this suggests that Lydia may have been a Roman citizen since she apparently did both in Philippi which was a Roman colony oh those are the main relevant points that I found before we stand to pray and read our topic first I want to share one more thing with you I I was reading this the other day while I was thinking and praying about tonight's service these are the opening lines from a sermon of brother branham's titled bomb and Gilead preached in July 1959. brother Brandon says and I've often wondered what I would do if I held in a charger a cup a glass as we would call it two drops of the literal blood of the Lord Jesus I've often thought if I would be granted that privilege of packing two drops of the literal blood of the Lord how I would hold that to my heart walk so humbly and slowly watching every step that I would not drop it or spill it in anyway but then as I was thinking that tonight I have before me in the sight of the Lord a greater price than the two drops of the literal blood of Our Lord I have the purchase of his blood his people that he gave his blood that this people might live so he thought more of the people than he did of his own life he gave his life that his people without realization the realization of who I'm standing for this evening with the weight of responsibility to bring you it I believe the lord has laid on my heart to share with you from the book of Acts I ask you to please stand with me let's raise our hearts and our face together in prayer to our Lord Lord Jesus we are so grateful We Are So Unworthy but you've made us Worthy by your blood that covers our sin Lord that you've allowed us to come together this evening Lord blood brought children of yours Lord that we could gather around your word that we could sing and worship you and Lord that you could speak to us Lord I pray that you would anoint my lips Lord prevent me from saying something that's wrong prevent me from saying something that would cause difficulty or cause someone to stumble or cause someone to err and Lord if I somehow do that I pray that you'd anoint the ears that hear that they hear what's behind the words Lord that they hear the intent Lord and that above all we hear from you this evening we commit the remainder of this service to you now and we thank you we are so grateful in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen Acts 19 is the early part of Paul's third missionary journey it began in acts 18. so for our topic verse we'll read from acts 18 the 23rd verse Paul had just returned from his second missionary journey coming home to Antioch of Syria via Jerusalem he'd gone there to worship at one of the feasts we don't know which one Paul was certainly a great Christian he was also an observant Jewel trained as a Pharisee acts 18 23 and after completing his second missionary journey he Paul had spent some time there in Antioch of Syria probably several months perhaps a year or two we don't know how long he stayed there pick a number go to the web you'll find somebody that agrees with your number anyway after Paul sent some time in Antioch of Syria he Departed yet again on what we know as his third missionary journey and went over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order strengthening all the disciples it's the exact same route he started traveling on the second Journey with Silas please be seated just as a quick reminder that you should sit close to the front so you can see the detail on these little maps that I put up that this map shows the overall route which Paul and Silas traveled during the second missionary journey you'll notice they skipped Cyprus Barnabas was helping the work there this journey was covered in Acts starting in chapter 15 verse 40 and ending in chapter 18 verse 22. they covered well over 2 000 miles and took at least two years and probably three or perhaps more this is an overview of the third missionary journey which will be starting to study this evening it begins in Acts 18 23 that we just read you'll notice the cities where the Believers were gathered you really have to squint sorry are much the same as those of the second Journey I've labeled a few countries surrounding the area they traveled with modern names so you can get orientation here we'll use more maps as we progress through this journey and they won't be quite as uh small as this I wanted to have an overall idea of the territory Paul would be covering so on to Acts chapter 19. it came to pass while Apollos was at Corinth a call from our opening verse that Paul was traveling throughout galatia in frigida chapter 18 Ends by telling of Apollos a Jewish Believer from Alexandria who would come to Ephesus then went on to Corinth meanwhile Paul having passed through the upper coasts upper coasts simply means an Overland route having come through galatia and friesia it came to Ephesus so this should be a little easier to see acts 18 23 I've show down here we started in Antioch he went through these places he'd been and then Acts 19 1 he goes from there through Asia down to Ephesus on the coast of what is modern-day Western turkey now you may recall that in the second missionary journey the Holy Spirit prevented them from going to Asia they were headed that way they were right on the border and the Lord said no this time the Holy Spirit doesn't prevent him from traveling through Asia and he returns to Ephesus where he had briefly stopped on his previous mission trip he left from Corinth with a kill and Priscilla drop them off on Ephesus and sailed on to uh to Palestine and to Israel to Jerusalem to observe the feasts so here again I've circled deficits this is who apologists arrived it's where Apollos had been and then Apollos went on to Corinth and Paul arrived in Ephesus well so who's this Apollo's guy what what's up why why is this reference here well let's go back to acts 18 24 and we'll just quickly go through that to so that we have the the stage set the context we read that a certain Jew named Apollos born at Alexandria Alexandria was one of the largest cities in the world at that time it's in Egypt on the northern coast of Egypt on the Mediterranean Apollos we're told was an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures and he came to Ephesus this man Apollos was instructed in the way of the Lord the way in other words in Christianity and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of John and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Akila and Priscilla had heard they took him unto them they hosted him Apollos you've traveled a long way you've come here to share with us come to our home come to our home and while he was there they expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly gently carefully respectfully not for themselves no hint of bride Pride we know this what are you preaching that for you don't you know this uh and sometime later when Apollos was disposed to pass into Ikea that is Greece the brethren in emphasis wrote a letter of introduction on Apollo's behalf exhorting the disciples in Greece to receive him who when Apollos came helped them much which had believed in Jesus Through Grace for he Apollo mightily convinced the Jews and that publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ he was the Messiah we learned from this that Apollos was eloquent he was mighty in the scriptures fervent and Spirits boldly knew of John's baptism mightily convinced the Jews that Jesus was a crisis man had a powerful Ministry Peter on the day of Pentecost had results of three thousand converts we're told in many places in Acts that the number of Believers was growing daily watch closely now it may be a little it's 19. 19 or on to Acts 19 the next verse after 18 28. again it came to pass it while Apollos was in Corinth Paul having passed through the Overland route came to Ephesus and finding in Ephesus certain disciples and observing interacting with them knowing something about Apollo's Ministry Paul said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed they said unto him we have not so much just heard whether there be any Holy Ghost we have no idea what you're talking about Paul Enlighten us and with that answer Paul further inquired and said unto them unto what then or how were you baptized and they said born to John's baptism baptized the same way Jesus was baptized now some sources suggest that these were Jewish people who'd been baptized many years earlier by John the Baptist somehow made their way to Ephesus and never came in contact with Christians until Paul Came Upon them some 20 years later however with the evidence Luke gives us in chapter 18 about Apollos being an Ephesus and preaching the gospel knowing only John's baptism this conjecture seems unlikely to me I personally believe it were converts of Apollos prior to his Enlightenment from Priscilla unakula as recorded in Acts 18 as we just read if you search the sermon as a brother Branham you'll find he referenced this verse more than a hundred times and he presented both cases sometimes he says John baptized them usually he says Apollos baptized them the point isn't that he was confused the point is not who baptized them or being dogmatic in one perspective the other is that they were baptized to repentance according to the way that John the Baptist taught and the important teaching that Paul had to bring to them is that they had to receive the infilling of the Holy Spirit that there's nothing more essential than that in fact if you looked at the title slide which I backed up and showed you it said Acts 19 part 1 and was subtitled there is no substitute for the Holy Spirit I found that this is a central theme of this entire chapter of Acts every instance every interaction that you find every major thing points to this fact that there is no substitute for the Holy Spirit well let's see how Paul approached this topic of baptism with these disciples so then Paul said John verily baptized with a baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus notice Paul didn't berate Apollos he didn't say I'm the messenger to this age don't listen to Apollos he only had a partial truth he did not downplay John's ministry as the Forerunner of the Messiah no he took with these brothers knew and what they had been taught and he built upon it he said about adding light not deflecting not pointing to himself but pointing to Jesus this is a good lesson for us where's a mirror this is a good lesson for me if you take home nothing else from Acts 19 this evening but that you'll have something worth holding on to and worth applying in your daily life in this 21st century after the coming it's all about Jesus Christ it reminds me brother branham's story about the Hereford Association controlling grazing on a federal pasture near the Troublesome River in Colorado you're familiar with the story The Ranger guarding the gate to the entry to the pasture made sure that all the cattle coming in were yet herefords he didn't look for the brand oh this this one is from the Baptist Ranch and this one's from the Pentecostal Ranch and this is from the Catholic Ranch and this is from the message Ranch no no forget the brand he was looking for the blood tag what does the blood represent to us as Christians the life we must possess the Life of Christ his life must possess us and that means the infilling of the Holy Spirit it's not optional it's essential verse 4 was just the opening line of Paul's instruction to these people it wasn't a one sentence presentation or an encapsulation well let's continue on to verse 5. one day these disciples heard this all that Paul had to say to them about baptism they were baptized again but this time they were baptized and the name of the Lord Jesus it shall be light in the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find through the Waterway is the life today buried in the precious name of Jesus speaking of baptism and after having taken this step when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied young and old repent of all your sin the Holy Ghost will surely enter in the evening light has come it is a fact that God and Christ are one I hear it comes the results of this Mighty Ministry this powerful evangelist Apollos and all the men were about 12. 12. Paul wasn't worried about the size of the crowd he was helping he was one on one with Lydia and Philippi it isn't about numbers it isn't about the one who brings you the message of life it isn't about this preacher or that teacher it's about God's grace and his election another song comes to mind Keep Your Eyes Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful face and the things of Earth will grow strangely dim and the light of his glory and grace well let's pause for a moment consider baptism not from our perspective as Christians of the 21st century or or our doctrines but from the perspective of Judaism in the first century have you ever asked yourself the question why was John baptizing in the Jordan why did Jesus disciples join in that practice early on why were people so willing to experience this right why were these disciples so willing to be baptized again did Moses command people to be baptized for that matter here in the 21st century did you know that converts to Judaism are immersed in water as part of their conversion process that's a different form of immersion from Christian baptism to be sure but it shows the roots in John chapter 3 we read verse 22 after these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea they'd been up in the Galilee they're moving south and there he carried with them and baptized anticipating your questions we don't know any more details about how they baptized it wasn't in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they didn't have that Revelation at that time John was also baptizing in and on near to Salim because there was much water there must have been the time of year when the Jordan was full and day the people came and were baptized for John was not yet cast into prison then there were Rose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying purifying this is key we often use the term sanctification and in John 4 we get clarification that Jesus was not baptizing people and also that this early in his ministry he was attracting large crowds John 4 1 when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John though Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left Judea and departed again and to Galilee and on the way he meets the woman at the well in Samaria well under the law of Moses various things can make a person ritually unclean purification required washing one's clothes and once Flash in water there might also be other requirements for perhaps an animal sacrifices well depending upon what it was that made the person unclean they might have just come in contact with something that they shouldn't so they would go through this particular ritual of purification not just washing their hands by the time of the late Temple period which is some 15 centuries after Moses this practice of ritual purification had been greatly extended through tradition and practice let me read a bit about the Jewish perspective on purification that the Hebrew word used is Mikvah it means collection and it refers to any Gathering of water for ritual purposes now I'm going to read you a little excerpt from a a website from chabad.org and Chabad I'm not choking that's how you say it it's an Orthodox Jewish site there's actually a Hebrew letter that makes a sound and if you have a cold it's a lot easier so I I show here images of a modern Mikvah and one from the second temple period a Mikvah we're told is a pool of water in which Jewish people immerse note that one must immerse not be sprinkled or splashed or showered why to affect purity it is most commonly used by women as part of the Nida cycle before she's reunited with her husband the Mikvah is also used by converts as they become Jewish in Temple Times this is especially true in the late second temple period at the time of Jesus and Paul it was used by anyone wishing to enter the Holy Temple complex remember that for the next few minutes one had to in effect be baptized whenever one wanted to enter the temple precincts or partake of sacred Foods the Mikvah is surprisingly nondescript a humble structure the modern one in the image is pretty ornate mcvote it's a plural of Mikvah Mikvah one mcvote many are usually not in a room so decorated and elaborate its ordinary appearance however belies its primary place in Jewish life and law the Mikvah offers the individual the community and the nation of Israel the remarkable gift of purity and holiness no other religious establishment structure or right can affect the Jew in this way and indeed on such an essential level than as you would expect it's extraordinary power however is contingent on its construction in accordance with the numerous and complex specifications as outlined in holoca Jewish law however the world's natural bodies of water its oceans rivers Wells and spring-fed lakes are mikvahs and their most Primal form they contain Waters of divine source and thus tradition teaches the power to purify no wonder that the woman at the well wanted the water Jesus spoke of well the Mikvah must be fed by moving water and Hebrew that's maim which lives literally Living Waters not a stagnant pool and it's not simply bathing tradition required one to be physically clean if possible before immersing in a Mikvah you don't want to be dirty and get in there and there's 300 other people going behind you and yeah no no no thanks and that's why the water's got to be moving right so we can see that a Jewish person in the first century would be happy to be immersed in the Jordan River for a right of purification and one like John the Baptist telling him telling them outward isn't good enough one must be intentional modern Judaism also teaches about being intentional prepared in the heart not just an outward Act when we lived in Israel back in the 70s we were in it's outskirts of Netanya there was a a Orthodox Community there called koreat songs they were building a hospital and my brother Noel was a trained lab technician so he and his wife Shirley and their girls lived in a wing of the hospital that was still under construction my brother was meanwhile buying all the equipment and setting up the lab and getting things ready for the hospital to go but he had another job between the hospital and what we call a Yeshiva which is a school where Jewish boys are learning the Torah the Bible there was a big vote and if you're if you're a Jewish boy student and you're learning these things and you're writing out the text of the of the Bible that's part of your training whenever you come to the four letters what we call the tetragrammaton the yuenheit but we sometimes say Yahweh or Jehovah they never pronounce that they'll say Hashem the name or Adonai whenever the person was writing that and they come to those letters that they had to copy put down their pen and go to the Mikvah and immerse themselves become ritually clean go back and write those four letters and as and if if it was a verse where the name of the Lord was two or three times they'd be making a lot of trips back and forth to the Mikvah because it was so important to them so important the name of God so they really liked my brother Noel because he learned how to fire up the steam boiler in the morning and get the temperature just right and scrub the place and make it clean and they were just delighted because people they'd had before him it was too hot it was too cold it wasn't clean so when we left Israel several years later they were really sad to see my brother go I don't know if they were sad to see Migo but they were sad to see my brother go and I don't know if it was because they needed to find somebody else to run the lab in the hospital or they needed to find somebody and they were concerned about finding somebody to keep that Mikvah clean and at the right temperature well a big difference as you may have picked up from what I just described going on when we lived in Israel is that in the Mikvah in Judaism one immerses oneself there isn't a second person to to perform some sort of a right so in this respect John the Baptist was doing something new and unusual let's briefly now turn to the Gospels Saint John 5 1 and then Saint John 9 5. because after this it was a feast of the Jews Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is a Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water we're familiar with the story why were they there so they could be both healed and cleansed purified both conditions of which had to be satisfied to enter the temple area now that was a pretty small Mikvah you've got how many thousand pilgrims coming into Jerusalem how long does that line go John 9 Jesus is speaking he says as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground made clay of the spittle and Anointed The Eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto him go wash in the pool of Siloam which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing this photo is believed to be the sight of the pool of Siloam it's been on I think this one was uncovered in 2004. and a drawing of what it might have looked like in the first century Herod the Great as part of his expansion of the Temple Mount and Jerusalem in general had these spring-fed pools built near the temple so that people could immerse themselves and become ritually clean on their way to the temple the number in size were to accommodate the large number of pilgrims and other worshipers that wanted to go to the temple well back to Paul and the 12 disciples they'd been baptized but Paul knew that the baptismal practice of John predated the sacrifice of Jesus giving his life for our Salvation it was no longer a right symbolic of purification but it was now a right symbolic of death to self and being brought from Death to life in Christ so he told them and they were baptized again this time in the name of Jesus Christ just as Peter had proclaimed on the day of Pentecost after Jesus resurrection Paul then prayed for them to receive the indwelling of the Holy Spirit indicating God's acceptance of their faith we talk about being sealed talking about a token sometimes there is no substitute for the Holy Spirit back to Acts 19 and Paul having just baptized and prayed for these 12 believers and he Paul went into the synagogue at Ephesus and spoke boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God don't be misled by that word disputing in Modern English we think of this as an argument or a fight it's the normal method of pharisaic and now rabbinic learning other translations use words like dialogue discussing reasoning the way this works is that one takes a position on a point of scripture others then attack that position probe for weakness if it holds up to such scrutiny good if not figure out what the weakness of the error is and correct it not correct the scripture but correct your understanding your revelation of its meaning the scripture is the absolute there can be heated discussions and disagreements but participants are still friends and brothers brother random talks about standing toe-to-toe with your brother and vehemently disagreeing but still loving him it it's a method of instruction that they used in that day a method of teaching it's not getting into it pugilism going to a gym and and working out it's a method or an approach of learning and this is how Paul was going about it that's what his training was as a Pharisee when diverse some of the participants in these discussions were hardened they couldn't defend their stances or defeat Paul's but they were unwilling to change and believe not they didn't believe what Paul was saying but space evil of that way the way Christianity spake evil that way before the multitude they verbally attacked Paul they attacked his teaching speaking evil indicates this became personal no longer a method of teaching and learning they reviled discredited publicly maligned the way Christianity or that Jesus was the Messiah so when that happened Paul departed from them he left the synagogue and separated the disciples the the students the Believers the followers of Christ from that synagogue disputing daily no longer in the synagogue but instead teaching using this method of dialogue and persuasion and the school of one torontus this continued by the space of two he had already been in Ephesus for three months at least now he's there for two years just in this one school Paul stayed and taught an Ephesus in this part of his journey we later find out thinking Acts 20 will discover that he was there for three years so that all they which dwelt in that part of Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus both Jews and Greeks recall in Acts 16. Paul tried to go to Asia but was forbidden by the spirit to go at that time now he's being detained in Asia for considerable length of time by the same Holy Spirit God wasn't confused and neither was Paul we must be careful as our brother just Illustrated with uh with what he said before the prayer request to always be sensitive to the Lord's guidance never forget the comma in our theology or in our experience God is alive and well and cannot be put in a box now God was about to use Paul's Ministry to do something remarkable we read and God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul not just ordinary miracles special Miracles unusual miracles what does this mean so that from his body from Paul's body not from his dead body his not grave clothes but things he had touched were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs literally the Greek it's a towel for wiping perspiration or a napkin or aprons the word translated aprons only occurs once in the entire Bible that's right here it means a half girding or a narrow covering not quite sure what that is but maybe it's something you wore as he worked we're told he was a tent maker and the King James version the word translated Tent Maker also means leather worker regardless of the particular craft things Paul had touched were brought to the sick and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out from them in our day this is the basis for what we call prayer cloths we sometimes take things that brother Branham prayed over for healing and give them to people who are sick brother Branham said the scriptural basis for this was when Elisha sent gehazi with his staff to lay on the dead child of the shinomite woman in Second Kings 4. well this is a Bible study so let's turn to the account Second Kings Four starting at verse 27. the back story is a woman of shooting provided a room for Elisha to stay in when he was in the area she and her husband had no child Elisha promised her that she would conceive and she did and bore a son some years later out in the field the child cried out my head my head was taken to his mother and died a few hours later in her lap she took the child to Elisha's bed laid him there and got a donkey saddled up and went to find Elisha and when she did she came to the man of God to the hill she caught him by the feet but gehazi that's Elisha's servant came here to push her away the man of God said let her alone her soul is vexed within her the Lord's hid it from me I don't know why she's here I don't know what's going on and she said did I desire a son of my Lord did I not say Do not deceive me then Elisha said to you guys he gird up thy loins take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not if any man salute thee don't say hello back lay my staff on the face of that child the mother child said as the Lord liveth in his thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so Elisha arose in follower okay hazy passed on before them laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore he went again to meet him Elisha and told him saying the child is not awake when Elisha was coming to the house behold the child was dead and laid upon Elisha's bed you went in therefore shut the door upon them Twain and prayed unto the Lord and he went up lay upon the child put his mouth upon his mouth his eyes upon his eyes his hands upon his hands he stretched himself upon the child in the flesh of the child waxed warm of course touching a dead body makes you ritually unclean and requires purification as we have just talked about then he returned walked in the house to and fro went up and stretched himself upon him the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes and he called Ghazi and said call this shunamite so he called her and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy son then she went in and fell at his feet bowed herself to the ground took up her son and went out this is a seemingly strange reference since nothing happened when gehazi did as a prophet directed it required Elisha to physically come and for the Lord to bring the child back from death the shinomite mother would accept nothing less there's an important principle here something about which we need to be very careful recall in Acts 5 15 people laid in the streets that perhaps Peter's Shadow my my ass over them there's no spiritual power in Peter's shadow or an Elisha's staff nor frankly and prayer clause God does not live in handkerchiefs he doesn't live in rocks he doesn't live in sticks he doesn't live in church buildings understand I am not saying anything against the use of prayer cloths far from it these are mechanisms to inspire faith when brother Branham would send out a prayer cloth he'd send out this letter or not this one this is a copy obviously but he sent those with perk loss or handkerchiefs and it directed people to pray and believe and have faith in God not in the handkerchief of the cloth let me let me read a copy to you I'll read it I'm sure that that prints a little small for you greetings in the name of our Lord we received your request for prayer and are happy that you are a Believer and want to assure you that the Lord still heals all manner of disease Psalms 103 3 the Lord that healeth thee your request has received the personal attention of brother Branham and he has had special prayer for you and prayed over the enclosed cloth or handkerchief according to Acts 19 11 and 12. just read and request that you wear it over your heart and believe God for the healing of your body please wear it and stand fast on the word and promise of God be simple be natural be open-hearted before God remember God knows your heart ask God to Search Your Heart and then to remedy everything that may be contrary to his will and say Lord I commit all my troubles and myself to thee and I believe thy promise that if we commit and Trust thee thou would work Lord I believe thee and praise thee we are not to be occupied with our feelings or symptoms or our faith or lack of faith but only what God has said the simple way is to begin calling the things we have prayed for hours and to thank God for them before we feel or see the answer God is faithful he cannot deny himself the word of God tells us when you pray believe Mark 11 24. we must believe that we have the answer even though we neither see nor feel that we have see first John 5 14 and 15. well let's just read those two and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will here's us and we know if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him go back to the letter God says now Faith is Hebrews 11 1. not faith shall be for that would only be hoping for and not present tense believing in having Faith begins now pray each day at 9 00 a.m 12 noon and 3 P.M also praying for others is a worldwide prayer band we'll be praying for you at this time we will appreciate your sending us a testimony of your healing for it is by your testimony and the blood of the Lamb that you overcome Revelation 12 11. may God richly bless you and yours sincerely yours and his service brother William Branham I want to go back and read two lines from from this letter but I hope you can see that this isn't some this is an Apple Air tag that you clip and forget you have a huge part to play but what struck me the most perhaps about this pray each day at 9 00 A.M 12 noon and 3 P.M also praying for others as a worldwide prayer band will be praying for you at this time I wonder how many of us do this pray for our brothers and sisters their needs their healing that God would respond to their faith each and every day at these three times there's nothing magic about these times but it ensures that we're praying together and because of time zones it means that there's prayer every hour of every day but only if we do it in the summer of 2000 I and a few colleagues were invited to Saudi Arabia by one of the princes only time I've ever been in a Royal house that had a royal meal in a princess house but while there certain protocols were explained when Muslims went to prayer they would face Mecca and kneel and bow and if I weren't 73 years old I I'd show you that but but I am 73 and I won't I and the very small group I was with were warned not to stand in front of a Muslim who was praying this would be an insult as they were bowing to Mecca not to one of us infidels they prayed five times a day Sunrise halfway between sunrise and noon noon halfway between noon and Sunset and at sunset one afternoon we were out in the desert it was actually a if thinking in America in terms of like thoroughbred horse racing or something we were at the Racing Stable of the camels that won the race every year in Saudi Arabia and so we're out in the desert there and and seeing these camels and whatnot there's a picture of me on one of those camels but he was hobbled so it was okay and these guys got out there Matt ruled them out right there in the desert aimed towards Mecca as the sun was setting and they prayed stopped what they were doing a Christian friend of mine who was with us a few days in the trip he said words to me something along these lines he said Lyle what would this world be like if Christians everywhere regardless of denomination would sincerely go to their knees in prayer five times a day like these Muslims my brothers and my sisters I believe this world would be a different place maybe that's what will bring what we call the Rapture not some doctrinal dispute not building walls of Separation over disagreements about what this verse means or what that quote's all about or whatever but Christians filled with the Holy Spirit praying for one another and the burdens on our hearts regularly sincerely together sighing and crying for the sins done in our city for the sins done in my life not waiting for some sort of pressure to bring us together that this guy that turns his back when he sees you in Walmart will suddenly hug you as his brother because of pressure that's not maybe my opinion takes not pressure to drive us together takes love to bring us together to draw us together if we could love one another and freely and willingly and in love do this what's your prayer life like I'm looking in the mirror I can tell you right now a confession mine is nowhere near what brother Brenner requested of anyone who wanted a prayer cloth 60 years ago you accept that prayer cloth you're accepting this obligation to pray three times a day to pray for others not just for yourself there's an obligation I wonder if the people who received for our clause and may still be alive are still following this request pray each day at 9 00 a.m 12 noon 3 P.M also praying for others as a worldwide prayer band we'll be praying for you at this time I wonder if there is still a worldwide prayer band praying every day at those hours when brother Brannon would call out a person tell them their name their address their problem the purpose was to inspire faith in that person to reach out and obtain their healing or whatever their need was telling a person their name didn't change their name didn't tell them something they didn't already know but it gave them confidence and what they were being told so that their faith would rise in that moment to demonstrate that Jesus Christ really is the same yesterday and today and forever these prayer clause in Acts 19 or in our day are not icons or not to be treated as relics they're a way to inspire faith prayer prayer and when you pray believe and be thankful that he's answering but we must be careful or such things can become idols objects of worship a substitute for the holy spirit in our lives that's not what they're about much of Acts 19 deals with this topic of Idols substitutes for the Holy Spirit the life just like saying in the name of Jesus it's not an incantation let's read on Acts 19. verse 13 then certain of the Vagabond Jews now we might think of a vagabond as a as a negative thing it simply means wandering there was people that traveled they were exorcists persons who cast out demons and they took upon themselves in their incantations or spells of exorcism ever how they approach this to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we endure You by Jesus whom Paul preacheth and there were seven seven tons of one skiva a Jew and chief of the priests which did so they did this very thing they attempted exorcism using the name of Jesus as part of an incantation or a spell people who didn't understand it isn't the name it's the life behind the name that's the reason I opened with that song this evening and another lesson for us today they treated God like a tool at their disposal we are his to use not the opposite he is Sovereign we are bought with a price like that quote I read from Brother Branham at the beginning blood and the evil spirit answered through the possessed man and said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you and the man and whom the evil spirit was leaped on the seven of them and overcame them and prevailed against them so they fled out of the house naked and wounded they should have gone to your gym brother contrast this with Jesus dealing with Legions it is indeed indeed the life behind the name not the name itself and and this was no this event this became known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified extolled held in high regard a little different than how it started out with those Jews in the synagogue saying bad things and look what happened next the combined effect of Paul's Ministry the special miracles of healing and and the exorcism that backfired and many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds other translations make this perhaps a little clearer the Amplified Bible puts it this way many also of those who were now Believers came making full confession and thoroughly exposing their former deceptive and evil practices in other words the fear of God came on those professing Christ they saw there were consequences to pretending to lacking the life behind the name it's a good thing for us to do too to come together to confess our sins to draw close to our Lord and to one another I'll stop here for this evening God willing will continue to include chapter 19 next Wednesday night if the musicians could please come as we progress through the rest of the book of Acts consider the circumstances the context of Paul's life and experiences the context of the Cities where the Believers lived who received these teachings and eventually letters and realize there is no substitute for the Holy Spirit he is real he is alive and more than ever we need to have the life behind the name as we sang at the opening nothing is random here it's all in God's control it's in his hands as are we if we'll accept his love and grace through Christ Jesus if you have not done so I urge you to not leave tonight until you know you've met him and he's met you so that on that final day he won't turn to you and say depart from me not for what you've done or not done but because I never knew you I'd like to close this portion of tonight's service with a song from a Billy Graham film of 1965. the Restless ones brother Francois taught me this song when he lived in Tucson as my roommate in the summer of 1970. it's a song about salvation coming to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ the song is titled he's everything to me you know that I'm no singer I'm always in the cracks between the keys if you know the song help me if you don't know the song Pray For Me in the stars is Handy work I sing on the Wind he speaks with Majesty though he ruleth over land and sea what is that to me I will celebrate Nativity for it has a place in history sure he came to set his people free what is that to me till my faith I met him face to face and I felt The Wonder of his grace that I knew that he was more than just our God who didn't care that lived away out there and now he walks beside me Day by Day Ever watching or me last I Stray helping me to find that narrow way is everything to me [Music] and now he walks beside me Day by Day Ever watching or me last my strength helping me to find that narrow way foreign and now he walks beside me day by day ever watching Norman helping me to find that never amen I gotta take two minutes and give a testimony that most of you have heard but I think that there's brother Jonathan brother Eli salazars you probably haven't heard this testimony a friend of mine was in Salem Indiana you guys know where Salem is right Salem Indiana it's north of Jeffersonville a little ways and he was talking to a um a lady and this he said have you ever heard the name William Branham before and uh this lady said oh yes I have she said and I'm pretty sure it was her mother she said my mother was in the hospital and she had cancer and she had friends that had heard that this man William Branham he had a Healing Ministry and and they had heard that he was going to be in his hometown of Jeffersonville and so these two sisters of the two friends of this lady that was dying in the hospital of cancer they went to Brother Brown's meetings brother Branham at the end of the service he looks out in the congregation and he sees these two ladies and he says you're praying for a friend of yours he said you have a she has cancer he says you have a handkerchief take that handkerchief lay it on this lady and he I believe he gave instructions on her to forward a pennant on her undergarment and that she would receive her healing so they brought the um the handkerchief back and they told the lady that was in the hospital they told told her the story and uh back then in the in the hospital rooms I still even today that there's a curtain and you may be in with another patient so there was another patient that was on the other side of the curtain and these two ladies are telling telling their friend they're saying hey we went to we went to the Tabernacle and we went heard this man William Branham and he he told us to take this handkerchief and end up and to take it and to pin it on your garment and that you'd be healed and she said of course she didn't think that that made sense that's a very odd thing to do and she got embarrassed and her friends were like well you should do it she says no I I don't I don't think so so the lady on the other side of the curtain she reaches over opens up the curtain she says I'll take that and so she took the prayer cloth and she did as instructed and the lady told my friend she said that was my mother and she was dying of cancer and she is living today and that other lady died so so we can see these these prayer cloth testimonies they um they're the truth let's all stand [Music] I appreciate it brother Lyle I don't know if I have ever met anyone that has ever been invited to Saudi Arabia by a prince that was good he uh and I also appreciate it brother I appreciate the whole thing but when brother Lyle was talking about that we shouldn't have to have pressure to drive us together that it should be love that we have for each other but I will tell you our Lord God loves us so much that if we don't have that love he will put on that pressure and drive us together and it's sad that God has to do that to people that we we should have that love for one another without having to be driven together Amen brother Jeremy if you come up and close prayer a prayer request came in during service that brother Joe Miller asked if we would pray for his wife she has she has covet and she's in a high risk situation so if brother Jeremy as you close in prayer if you would also pray for her [Music] that's great [Music] gracious Heavenly Father we're just kind of an honor and privilege to be here in your presence for three of us believe on you you're here

Arnie said we do so if you would like to have a prayer cloth that brother Brown prayed over we have one for you if you'd see brother Arnie on your way out and brother Lyle appreciated tonight and going in the background on baptism that's what mental whole the whole thing always is brother Lyle teaches us it means a lot but going back into seeing the purpose and baptism is a cleansing and something that is done as as to show that you're cleansed before the Lord before you go on to the next step beautiful thank you brother Lyle very very nicely done God bless you all you're dismissed in the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] for you [Applause] heavenly father I appreciate energy Holy Spirit jumping comfort [Music] ers Holy Spirit your [Music] job oh my name is [Music] I am machine happy
