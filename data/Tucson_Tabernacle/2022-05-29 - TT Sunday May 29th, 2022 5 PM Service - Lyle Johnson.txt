together and all and we did and at the end she said can i order a strawberry shortcake and i said sure it's just me and you anyways you know and nobody's gonna see that i ate some too but uh so they brought us the bill and he said um we're just billing you for this strawberry shortcake i stopped and said i mean we're nobody special why would you do that he said because there were some folks

so let's stand my heart into my heart come into my heart lord jesus [Music] come into my heart lord jesus [Music] into my heart [Music] lord jesus come into today come in to stay come into my heart lord jesus thank you good evening it's a wonderful time to gather to share to worship that's what he created us for it's to worship him to love him to serve him we're grateful for the freedom we have in america to worship god gather like this without fear tomorrow's memorial day it honors those who have served our nation in defense of our freedoms and values but never came home those who lost their lives in defense of our nation so we could be here tonight and our family my father's youngest brother is one of those that never came home he was drafted in the army went to iwo jima as a marine and at the age of 26 on march 2nd 1945 he gave his life i saw how that affected our family and so if there's anyone here if you know anyone who has a family member a close family member that never came home you might think tomorrow to reach out to them and just let them know that that you appreciate that sacrifice and that you care our freedoms come with a terrible cost but we must never forget the price that jesus paid to secure ours he makes us free to serve by the way that if you're streaming brother al yesterday was brother al peterson's 93rd birthday brother al is a true servant of the lord a wonderful brother and if you're screaming brother if you see this or whatever i just want you to know that i value as a friend and a brother well with each other in our minds and our hearts let's approach our lord our savior our maker our redeemer and unity as individuals as a local body and as part of the great body of believers of christ lord jesus we counted such a privilege lord and it's not just empty hollow words we do counted such a privilege lord that we can gather together this evening not in fear but lord in worship and thanksgiving with grateful hearts lord we ask that you forgive us where we have fallen short lord we thank you for the spirit of worship that's here this evening lord for the musicians our brother aaron leading worship and now lord has become to this part of the service lord i pray that you would speak lord that you would somehow channel your thoughts into words that will be spoken and that will be heard in that spirit lord and that it be of help lord that it encourages us that it strengthens us that it bring us closer to you as we were just singing lord more of thee and that's our desire lord we commit this service now into your hands and we thank you in jesus name amen you you may notice the title here is not all that different from the title this morning um but uh when i discovered that brother aaron was going to be talking about what he was going to be talking about i thought i hope it's not the same verses in the same excerpts that i've got um well we'll find out if it is or not if you were here this morning then you can track along and see if this is a repeater if it's part two so while we're standing let's read our topic verse from his love letter to us first corinthians the third chapter and the 16th verse paul says know ye not that ye are the temple of god i'm reminded when i read that verse of solomon's temple in jerusalem built some 3000 years ago a temple it was just a structure a beautiful structure but just stone and wood but there was a second part that occurred at that dedication just as there's a second part to this verse it says and that the spirit of god dwells in you recall at that dedication the spirit of the lord filled the sanctuary we were just talking before the musicians came out this evening in the in the uh portion of it and in kings where it talks about the dedication it says they brought in the ark and the spirit filled the temple but if you read in ii chronicles chapter 5 verse 12 it says after they brought the ark in and before all that happened that the musicians were there the singers and they were in unity raising their voices and that's when the spirit of the lord filled the temple that's the transformation god's presence that makes all the difference i'd like to read this same verse usually i read several verses i've only got one to start tonight but i'd like to read it to you again but from the amplified bible do you not con discern and understand that you the whole church at corinth the whole church at tucson tabernacle are god's temple his sanctuary a sanctuary is a place of refuge it's a place of safety his sanctuary and that god's spirit has his permanent not temporary not like solomon's temple his permanent dwelling in you to be at home in you collectively as a church and also individually please be seated we must never lose sight of the fact that we are a local body we need one another not to forsake to give up assembling together but our walk with christ is also an intensely personal and individual walk the indwelling holy spirit is a consistent theme in paul's epistles the life of christ living and working through us tonight we'll be looking more closely at this tonight's title is living tabernacles our bodies being a temple where the spirit of the almighty is pleased to dwell we'll be reading a lot of scriptures and many excerpts from the sermon of brother branham dealing with this topic what brother lyle says is of little or perhaps even no value but what the scriptures say in them lie the keys to the kingdom to life eternal brother branham sermons also help us better understand those keys how to apply them in our lives paul called this tabernacling of god within humans a great mystery when he wrote to the colossians he says even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but is now made manifest it's become visible it's come into fruition we can see it to his saints and we include ourselves in that number to whom to who to us god would god willed god desired to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles the heathens the non-jewish peoples which is christ in you the hope of glory the hope of life eternal the holy spirit the earnest of the promise of our redemption whom we preach that is we proclaim the indwelling christ warning every man teaching every man and all wisdom that we may present every man perfect that means complete fully mature full-grown and right relationship in christ jesus perfect in the king james version is often a synonym for complete but reading this it raises many questions how does one become perfected how does one become made complete in christ jesus is this the work of the spirit we just sort of sit back and pray and desire it and it happens or do we have an active role to play and if an active rule what is that rule all too often i tend to put my walk with christ is more passive than active that he'll do the work in me but our life in christ is active not passive jesus said to take his yoke that his yoke is easy and his burden is light okay but easy and light are relative they're not absolute terms it's not so many pounds of this or so much pressure or so much strain on a on a yoke but yolk means that you're harnessed you are expected to pull to work to put in effort in tandem with another part of a team burden means you're carrying something and you're expected to carry it not just stand there and hold it or put it down and sit on it we were reminded last week that the bride makes herself ready the groom doesn't make her ready the attendants don't make her ready there's a context of that statement in revelation is first century not 21st century paul wrote one of his last letters to timothy now he was instructing timothy how to be a good minister of jesus christ these admonitions of paul are not just for timothy they're not just for one that's called to ministry they're for each of us we'll just read two verses here first timothy 6 verse 11 he says but thou thou is a singular form of second person so it's a personal note it's to each individual thou o man of god place yourself in these words but thou fill in your name child of god flee don't stroll don't look back run from these things in the previous verses paul was lamenting and warning about false teaching seeking wealth and reputation instead seek and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith one who fights is not one who's sitting down this isn't some sort of a computer game set in a virtual make-believe alternate reality lay hold on eternal life to lay hold means grasping hanging onto it once it's in your grip not letting go not releasing it once you've got it hang on to it don't lose it possess it where unto thou art also called you're called to eternal life value it cleave to it don't let it slip away and has professed a good profession before many witnesses these are resounding words of encouragement but what do they mean what is godliness what does paul mean by the terms patience or faith or love is faith of necessity a fight how does one grasp eternal life peter once wrote that paul's not always so easy to understand i'm going to read what peter said about that and i'm going to read it in the niv so it'll be even easier to understand ii peter 3 15 he says bear in mind that our lord's patience his patience with us is what's implied the lord's patience with us means salvation just as our dear brother paul also wrote you with the wisdom that god gave him he writes the same way consistently and all his letters speaking in them of these matters his letters contain some things that are hard to understand which ignorant and unstable people distort as they do other scriptures to their own destruction the other scriptures peter here is equating paul's then current letters his then current ministry as being equivalent to the hebrew bible to the tanakh other scriptures i imagine peter took some flack for that well let's turn to peter he's presumably easier to understand than paul and his words should align with paul's since the holy spirit was directing the thoughts of both apostles now we're going to be reading from second peter chapter one this was the text that brother branham used in a sermon that he titled the stature of a perfect man he preached that sermon october 14 of 1962 and we'll take several brief excerpts from that to any of you remember october 1962 uh now some of you probably are too young for that um i remember it i was 12 years old it was a cuban missile crisis the united states and russia on the brink of nuclear war at the very moment that brother branham was preaching the statue of a perfect man the morning of october 14 1962 we read got this from wikipedia the u.s first obtained u2 photographic evidence of the missiles on october 14 when a u2 flight took 928 pictures on a path selected by defense intelligence agency analysts capturing images of where town turned out to be ss4 construction site at san cristobal and western cuba the very moment that brother branham was speaking this was the very moment that we were discovering that we were on the path to possible destruction the films were developed within two days they were presented to president kennedy within a few days he put up a naval blockade around cuba to interdict any ships going in verify they don't have offensive weapons and let them pass if they have offensive weapons turn them back it brought america and russia the closest we've ever been to nuclear war i remember that october i was in the seventh grade i had just started the seventh grade and uh my best friend fred steinert and i were walking down the the hallways and the school there between classes and we looked at each other and asked each other we're 12 years old are we ready to die is there going to be nuclear war remember this was a time when kids when they went to school they were taught how to hide under the desks for when the bombs fell and all the rest of it this this was the cold war this was a very serious time to us it's it's chillingly similar in some ways to what we see happening now in ukraine well let's read now from ii peter ii peter chapter one first verse simon peter a servant literally a slave and an apostle a sent one an ambassador a representative of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith obtained you you weren't born with it you had to get it you had to go out and get it to receive and accept it this letters to us if we've obtained that faith it's been preserved for 20 centuries so we can read it tonight may 29th 2022 in tucson arizona obtained like precious faith with us peter had to obtain it too through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ he's the only source of it grace and peace be multiplied unto you continuing more and more unmerited favor from god and the confidence of faith that brings peace in the midst of tumult and turmoil how through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord not only our savior our personal lord and he's also the capital lord the creator and source of everything according as his who's jesus divine power hath given unto us we didn't buy it we didn't earn it it was gifted hath given to us all things not a partial set not an incomplete fulfillment but everything we need that pertains associated required unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him through knowing him that hath called us to glory and virtue his glory not ours we'll talk about virtue just a bit later whereby that whereby means in accordance with which are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises very great valuable extremely precious commitments a promise is a commitment and this is his commitment to us that by these these promises that ye this is a plural form now is addressed to all of us that you might be partakers of participate in share the divine nature can you begin to grasp what that means the awesome overwhelming gift that this is to partake of the divine nature the one who created all things and by whom all things consist having escaped escaped its past tense our state our condition is that of an escapee to escape is to break free from confinement but not by the will of the one that's confining you somebody escapes from prison there whoever had them under confinement is usually chasing them to put them back into confinement that's our state it's not like paul being released by the philippian authorities it's more like peter being in jail and the angel comes in and breaks the chains that has him chained to the guards and opens the doors and escorts them out the guards didn't want him to go and what is the confinement that we've escaped from but is still pursuing us to trap us again the corruption the rottenness the moral decay that is in the world through lust through covetousness through greed various human desires and beside this for this very reason and view of all this giving all diligence add to your faith employing every effort in exercising your faith peter now this additional qualities necessary to become complete in christ add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and your temperance patience and to patience godliness to godliness brotherly kindness to brotherly kindness charity love peter now continues by explaining why these characteristics are necessary to produce in the life of a christian he says for if these things that's a condition be in you and abound you possess these qualities in great measure they make that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in other words you will be fruitful and the knowledge of our lord jesus christ and he had just explained the value of that but he that lacks these things is blind can't see afar off has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins his life has not been transformed we're for the rather instead of lacking these things brethren give diligence make continued sincere effort self-examination to make your calling get election sure to be certain anchored for if you do these things being diligent you shall never fall that's quite a promise for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly in other words you'll be joyfully welcomed into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore to make sure you don't fall i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance i'll be constantly reminding you of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth yeah i i think it's me it's appropriate as long as i'm living in this tabernacle of flesh to stir you up get your attention shake you how by putting you in remembrance by reminding you again and again and again peter concludes this portion of his letter by explaining that though these are not new things he's telling us it's necessary to be reminded of them well let's go back and work through that list that's what brother branham did in 1962 and it's what i had in my heart to do tonight in 2022. paul tells us in ephesians 4 some goals of christian ministry he says he gave that is jesus provided some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers why for what purpose for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ how long will such ministry be necessary how long will it continue how long do you got to put up with me till we come to the unity of faith and the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ the stature of a perfect man that's what brother branham called that with that background let's examine more closely the list that peter provided us he said beside this giving all diligence add to your faith the foundation the beginning the basis on which all will be added is that of faith a faith is more than hope it's the substance and evidence of our hope it's our assurance in the face of apparent physical evidence to the contrary we're all familiar with hebrews 11th chapter abraham and sarah were too old to have children yet they persisted in their insistence that god had promised them a son together after 25 years god brought that promise to pass in their lives we often focus on abraham's side of this but paul makes it very clear in hebrews 11 that sarah was also a hero of faith once isaac was born they didn't need faith for having a son they had him but until they did they had to have faith noah had faith that god had told him to build a big wooden boat to survive a massive flood whatever that is noah labored for 120 years constructing it telling people about the judgment that was to come by and through his faith he and his family survived that flood without not just his faith but his tireless action based on that faith none of us would be here human life would have been extinguished i sometimes remind you about god healing my heart faith trusted that he would once he did i didn't need that faith i had the testimony of the result now my faith is god will continue to keep my heart strong until his purpose for my life is fulfilled until then you might have to put up with this old man for a while but faith is the foundation jesus told nicodemus he must be born again it was necessary it was not optional our faith must be based on his word frankly i think it takes less faith to accept the authority of the bible today than it did in previous generations how can you say that brother lyle the bible claims for example in its opening line that there was a beginning to our universe and to time itself but as a kid i was taught in school that the universe was infinite and it was always there if you have a basic understanding of newtonian physics that has to be the case that has to be if not if it weren't infinite in dimension it would collapse on itself due to gravity but for all of that to be in balance there has to be graph there has to be objects going out literally to infinity so it seemed that that evidence science at that time as they interpreted based on the laws of physics that newton had proclaimed that that science in the bible we're not in agreement but in the 20th century and the faith of skepticism and face of skepticism man's rapidly growing understanding of the physical universe we had minds like that of albert einstein showing us through relativity that newtonian physics was just a subset of the laws that govern the universe he also delved into the properties of light we have a much better understanding now of why god compared himself to light instruments like the hubble space telescope help us observe that in fact the universe is not infinite and it did have a beginning the web space telescope will enable us to see almost to that very beginning we've had physicists like stephen hawkings essentially proving the universe came into being by a force or source that transcends space and time god is not limited to this universe he's much greater than it he created it science our attempt to observe and explain the physical universe that we inhabit on the one hand and the biblical narrative on the other are not in conflict it's our incomplete and imperfect understanding of each that leads us to suppose that they're not in agreement but the more we understand both the clearer it becomes that they're in complete harmony job tells us speaking of the lord which do with great things past finding out yea and wonders without number the psalmist wrote some three millennia ago the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament chose his handiwork day and to day utter speech and night unto tonight shows knowledge there's no speech nor language where their voice is not heard the heavens are visible from anywhere on earth in plain sight just look up so our foundation is that of faith and the word of god the authority of the scriptures from them we learn the very first step is in fact faith we must be born again accepting jesus christ as our god and savior the lord who created our universe including ourselves but that's just the first step and beside this peter says giving all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue we're all familiar with the story from the gospels about one aspect of virtue jairus an official in a local synagogue had come to jesus asked him to come and heal his daughter his only child who lay at the point of death jesus agreed to come with him let's examine this story from mark's account it's also found in luke jesus went with jairus and much people followed him and thronged him he's being jostled by the crowd the curious and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many physicians had spent all that she had it was nothing bettered but grew worse when she heard of jesus came in the press behind and touched his garment she's declared unclean she's violating the religious law you can read it in leviticus 15. by coming into the crowd she had to isolate herself it's like coveted 19 right she had to be in isolation but she broke that rule of isolation perhaps she's known by some people oh don't get close to her because then we become unclean and maybe by them stepping back from her that created a means for her to approach jesus but she didn't come from the front she came from behind she came stealthily through the jostling crowd she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole not maybe i'll be okay or perhaps if i tug on his robe he'll turn around and then he'll be able to lay hands on me heal me no no no if i can just touch his garment i shall be made whole that was her faith faith in action violating the rules the law risking everything to approach jesus not openly she's unclean stealthily from behind and straightway instantly the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague her faith is answered her healing secured not just healing but miraculous healing instant and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue in this case healing power that strength had gone out of him to the extent that he could feel it he turned him about in the press in the press mind you and said who touched my clothes not who touched me not who grabbed me not who yanked not who pestered or pulled or punched who touched my clothes many no doubt were touching and jostling him with his clothing to the extent the disciples were perplexed by this question but this was an intentional deliberate act that he detected not just jostling by the curious in a crowd and his disciples said to him you see the multitude that's thronging you and how can you say who touched me but he didn't say who touched me he said who touched my clothes so jesus ignoring them looked around about to see her that had done this thing not being contacted by the merely curious but a desperate person quietly reaching out and determined faith but the woman fearing because she was violating god's laws of isolation would she be sternly rebuked humiliated punished and trembling perhaps also enjoying excitement due to her miraculous healing whatever happens i'm healed knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth her healing led to her testimony in front of a crowd of witnesses a crowd of witnesses that were following him for the healing of jairus daughter and he didn't scold her for coming but said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and behold of thy plague you're not only healed you're safe from any penalty associated with coming into a crowd in your former condition when the fringe of jesus garment was touched by a woman of faith who in faith reached out to him jesus stopped and asked who touched not grasped but simply touched my clothes now she had reached out to physicians to no avail she had faith in them why else would she reach out to them why else would she pay them but nothing helped her until she reached out to jesus what was the difference he had the virtue the strength to respond to her faith and to her plight that virtue that power that strength can only flow out if it's there to flow i'm not going to flow this out it's okay we must have it so it can flow out from us we can't just hold it and contain it that's not the purpose but we're to be a channel or to be an outlet to help others and it isn't just something that god plops on our lap we must exercise our faith to build up this sort of strength brother branham talked about exercising faith muscles muscles not exercised atrophy and lose the strength they once had a few years ago i had a a blood vessel a couple of them burst in my leg and i wound up having to stay in bed for a few weeks and and i don't have a very muscular thigh but you can see that my thumbs are about four inches apart well my thumbs overlap by about four inches after about three weeks in bed just from simply not being able to exercise that leg atrophy it doesn't take long it takes a while to build it back up trust me but it goes away very very quickly so you have to exercise your faith and not just on sunday and not just on wednesday you have to exercise that faith go to the spiritual gym every day right brother branham speaking about this attribute of virtue said live like a christian act like a christian be a christian beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue add to your virtue not that you're exercising your faith and knowledge knowledge isn't just reasoning you measure things by the word second timothy 2 15 paul admonishes or encourages timothy he says study to show yourself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth rightly dividing paul till timothy dividing what too often we see people busy dividing fellowships dividing the body of christ no we're supposed to be able to rightly divide the word of truth we need to spend time in the bible and the sermons are brother branham knowledge must be acquired you don't swallow a pill or have a prayer and suddenly you're filled with knowledge it requires time in study and as one acquires knowledge of god one must seek and use wisdom to apply it to rightly divide it here's what brother branham said about this kind of knowledge from statue of a perfect man he says i believe in genuine holy ghost knowledge holy ghost knowledge will always punctuate the word with amen when you get these things that seem to contradict themselves in the bible you sit down study it prayerfully like that and the first thing you know the holy spirit begins to move in after a while you see it ties together and there you got it see that's knowledge that's the kind of knowledge we need in our christian walk and that's how we acquire it that's how we can confess that jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever faith virtue knowledge what's next in peter's list faith virtue knowledge add to knowledge temperance temperance control your tongue and your temper is how brother branham defined temperance let's read his comments about this temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here either no no temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case remember we're talking from 1916 he grew up during prohibition and so forth in america the temperance societies and so forth so he says this isn't that this is bible temperance this holy spirit temperance that's just one of the lusts of the flesh but we're talking about holy spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue not be a tattler that was me it's not in the text not fly off every time anybody speaks crossed you oh my boy a lot of us are going to fall off before we get started aren't we see then we wonder why god is not in his church doing miracles and things that they used to do yes sir see add these things add temperance to it oh temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath has spoke to you somebody say are you a bunch of holy rollers down there don't jump up and roll up your sleeves now no not that talk with godly love temperance kindness is that the way you want to be when you're riled upon rile not back let him be your example now remember before his conversion brother branham was a fighter and he said that as a young man he had a temper that would fight a buzz saw so when he says somebody says means rile don't rile back he's talking about a changed life james wrote about temperance too in particular the part about controlling our tongue remember we're talking about being living tabernacles houses for the holy spirit to dwell temples james 3 for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in word the same as a perfect man our topic a tabernacle for the holy spirit and able also to bridle the whole body behold we put bits in the horse's mouth that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet they're turned about with a very small helm weathers whoever the governor listeth even so the tonga is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body set up on fire the course of nature and is set on fire of hell for every kind of beast and birds serpents things in the sea is tamed has been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it requires the holy spirit it's an unruly evil full of deadly poison being tortured and crucified jesus tongue uttered father forgive them they don't know what they're doing he's our example moving on faith virtue knowledge temperance add to temperance patience the bible speaks a lot about patience you know i when i realized i was going to be most likely speaking tonight a few days ago i started working on things and praying and asking the lord and i was taking notes and i just couldn't get any traction and it wasn't until thursday i think that i indicated that something is finally clicking here patience look it up in a concordance do a search with ease or or a similar tool i'll just touch on it here and let brother branham expand on this attribute james tells us my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations of various tests knowing this that the trying of your faith the testing of your faith works patience but allow let allow patients have her perfect work or complete work through the testings of your faith that she may be perfect and entire wanting lacking nothing being made perfect whole complete a temple for the spirit of god abraham had patience for 25 years noah 420 isaiah tells us they that wait upon the lord will renew their strength how long are we willing to wait again from statue of a perfect man we find god come this far waiting for the church too but it'll be there don't you worry he promised it waited all this time for a resurrection they'll be one don't worry god promised it just wait patiently you fall asleep that will you might take a little nap before it happens but you'll wake up at that time he promised it see a nap like what we call a nap of death you know what we call death just a little nap sleeping in christ no such thing as dying in christ life and death don't exist together see we just take a nap an app our friends can't call us from he's the only one can call he'll call and i'll answer him said job job has been sleeping now for 4 000 years don't worry he'll wake up don't worry he's still waiting a little bit further he's talking about moses and the deliverance from the captivity of egypt he says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength see just wait on the lord have patience see yes sir then israel was going to be taken out the great contrast came and moses waited then he got in the wilderness it's only about a three or four days journey it's only about 40 miles from where he crossed there right across where they crossed again but moses in the wilderness waited 40 years patience amen that's right he waited 40 years oh yes sir and we should have patience with one another too see one time we get so much impatient with one another well later in this sermon he speaks of the day of pentecost recorded in the book of acts how about the pentecostal people he's not talking about a denomination he's talking about the day of pentecost as long as they got the commission wait until see wait until you're imbued with power how long they didn't have the question how long will it be they just got the answer wait until they went up there now this is the ascension jesus is left and i said wait until so that was 40 days after easter right it's still 10 days until pentecost said all right boys maybe 15 minutes from now the holy spirit's going to be on us we're going to have our ministry oh 15 minutes passed nobody a day passed no two three four five six seven some of them might have said hey don't you think we already got it oh no no no no no that's right you better come on out boys devil said you know you've already got what you want go on start your ministry no no we ain't got it yet because he said there will come what would take place in the last days with stammering lips and other tongues will i speak to this people and this is the rest that i said see isaiah 28 19. said this is it you you'll you'll get it when we'll know when it comes we'll know when it comes we'll know it promise of the father very waited nine days and then on the tenth day we were there they had patience to wait now if you've got that kind of patience after god gives you a promise and you see it in the bible it's mine then wait then if you've got that kind of patience add it to your faith well peter has a few more attributes to consider so don't get impatient with me i know the clock is ticking beside this add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness godliness that that's quite simply to be like god easy to say as his sons and his daughters we should reflect his nature godliness is listed after patience which james said should be allowed to have its complete work on our lives through the trying and testing of our faith it's all a process it's not a miraculous gift of instantaneous transformation jesus said we'd be known by our fruits our actions what our lives produce jesus also gave us this command matthew 5 48 be ye there for perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect remember perfect and king james often means complete when you achieve that that's what this is all about to be a temple of his spirit and another place jesus says john 8 29 he that sent me is with me the father hasn't left me alone why because i always do those things that please him he's our example we must strive to do the same to be found in his will doing what pleases him accepting correction when we stray ongoing dying daily to self to be like jesus what's next faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness add brotherly kindness this isn't just being nice to those who are nice to you or those who share your views whether it's of our faith or or your politics or your taste and clothes or the way you like your coffee brotherly kindness brother branham said is to wear the other guy's shoes he gave a great illustration of this same sermon somebody said not long ago talking to brother branham how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the assemblies of god the oneness and the rest you're going and ministering amongst people that don't agree with you they don't see things the way you do then put see brotherly kindness see see hoping someday see patient with him see temperate enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday god will bring him in see we should strive to always be reaching out in kindness to those who disagree or understand things differently sincerely not faking it not putting it on well let's go to the last one you've done all these things faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity love we're all familiar with first corinthians 13 the chapter that deals with charity or love i'm not going to read first corinthians 13 tonight for this capstone this top layer or final item of peter's list let's read from first john 4. it'll be our final scripture selection this evening and understand that john's not speaking of human love one of those greek words we seem to be expected to know filio versus agapo right love is a term we see so often in our society today but it's so often twisted and perverted we're not talking about rainbows here we're not talking about the love in sodom or gay pride that's not at all what this is about first john 4. starting at verse 7 he says beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loves is born of god and knows god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love god is love and this was manifested was shown was displayed the love of god toward us god showed us his love for us because that god sent his only begotten son only in this case means uniquely we're also sons into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we love god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved john says if god so loved us we ought also to love one another beyond brotherly kindness not browbeating because oh love is corrective but in gentleness and meekness in love serving and forgiving one another father forgive them they know not what they do loving each other as christ loved us no man has seen god at any time if we love one another god dwells in us and his love is perfected it's made complete in us hereby we know that we dwell in him and as temples he in us because he's given us of his spirit and will bear its fruit not manufacturing it but bear it like a sheep bears wool by this will all men know you're my disciples jesus said by your love for one another john goes on we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world god came in human flesh to pay the price he himself demanded for our forgiveness our salvation to make it possible for us to escape ultimate destruction and death whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwells in him and he and god become his tabernacles we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love he repeats that and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him charity love god is love christ himself is the capstone we are reminded a change no stronger than its weakest link reviewing this material tonight is important for us to remind us brother branham at the end of his sermon that we've been abserting from tells us why it is important he says so this church has got to come to perfection to complete this right in order to bring the resurrection looking for the resurrection we have to look to ourselves to become this body of christ to have these attributes in our lives growing to have them in abundance as peter said we have to come to that state of perfection completeness and maturity it takes commitment work every day dying to our flesh that christ might live in us to each be a holy temple in which the holy spirit itself is pleased to dwell the musicians would please come brother branham closed his sermon by making a pledge to the lord afterward he asked the congregation to join him in it this was the pledge that he made he said i pledge this morning to him with all my heart that by his help and by his grace i pray that i'll seek daily without ceasing until i feel every one of these requirements flowing in this little old stature of mine till i can be a manifestation of the living christ for he became sin like me that i might become righteousness of god like him he took my place lord let me take his now because that's the purpose he died for brother branham says how many will pledge that same thing by the grace of god if you join me in prayer for just a moment lord jesus we thank you for the word we thank you for the sacrifices that have been made to bring us the word so many years ago and to carry it through 20 centuries that we could enjoy its benefits today we thank you lord for faithful men and women of the gospel of jesus christ lord through the ages lord we ask that we would be counted in that number lord and we ask again that you would forgive us unite us help us draw together lord to be the people that you're pleased in that you look down upon us and smile and say that's my son that's my daughter thank you lord this evening we thank you and we thank you and we thank you again in jesus precious name amen as brother aaron comes to close the service if we could worship in song the very song that he started with this morning will bookend it with this one lord prepare me to be a sanctuary lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true [Music] with thanksgiving i'll be unliving sanctuary for you lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] tried and true with thanksgiving [Music] let's stand as we sing that one wise a pledge to him lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true and with thanksgiving [Music] sanctuary [Music] in my lord be glorified be glorified in my life lord may glorify today oh in my life lord big [Music] in this church in your church [Music] glorified [Music] lord be glorified today my home in my home lord be glorified be glorified [Music] how many words could we insert at our job in our neighborhood with our family wherever we are with our co-workers be glorified let god be expressed see this is not your work this is his work the hardest work we have to do is get out of the way that's our biggest problem lord i think i've got it figured out now i think god is right and i i'll go do it now lord but you know what you yield yourself you surrender to him you say lord i'm giving up and letting you live and then he'll put you through the test he'll begin to bring those opportunities those places to practice what you preach what you've heard would you listen and then you can live it because you're not going to do it in your ability you're not going to do it under your own ability it's the spirit of christ that puts these things peter said lord i'm not going to deny you i'm going to go with you all the way to the cross i'll never turn my back on you oh never nothing nothing and they had already told jesus don't leave us he said but i must go away no no no no he's saying he said no this is a better way because if i go i will send my spirit back to you and thereby you can live this and peter was put to the test immediately hey aren't you one of those oh no i don't even know he is i don't even know his name he cursed he did everything he said but look at the peter after the day of pentecost by this very same thing that i denied i now preach that this is the truth the living god and john saw it this way god is love god is perfect love so when we say lord in my life in my home wherever i am be glorified let christ lord we know as a minister brother lyle myself and others you give us something to to minister scripture through an experience maybe something your brother branham say maybe something we've recently gone through and we share this thing to try to encourage to try to show that god is more than able but just in hearing the word and seeing the example lord if that's all it it goes to it doesn't accomplish anything lord but rather it has to come to fruition it has to come to life it has to be put to test lord so again we ask you lord in our lives be glorified let you your example you jesus christ become manifested in us lord through every one of these from godliness lord all the way up to brotherly kindness and then charity and he said in that he said we'll call for a resurrection we'll call for a coming of the lord father let it be i pray in jesus christ's name amen so how many would say lord test me try me put me to the test there where quickly i will know where i'm lacking and there where i'm lacking help to show me what i need to do there's a saying that says practice makes perfect but you got to practice it right to become perfect you could be practice something wrong the whole time and it'll never but the holy spirit has never missed and ever will miss let him work through you as our prayer lord it there's another song but singing it all day and now i'm not going to remember it maybe it was that in my life be glorified because it keeps coming back so just one more time [Music] glorified in my life lord be glorified today [Music] in our home lord be glorified big glorified [Music] lord be glorified today one more time of more of you more of you more of him in you and less of more of him and me and less of me and me [Music] oh more of you i've had it all but what i need is more of you [Music] half things i had my fear and yet i understand [Music] empty and bear lord hear my prayer for more of you oh more of you more of [Music] you i've had it all but what i need is more of you how things [Music] [Music] and to have more of him there has to be less of you and that's my desire lord let let's get rid of this guy the one that gives me most of my trouble in fact the one that gives me all of my trouble and let christ have us a full preeminence in our lives the the thing that was said of brother branham in one of the great the testimonies the the humility the humbleness and that's a person who realizes that they're really nothing but it's god in them and the fact that you could not tell the difference between his enemies and his friends because he treated them all the same sometimes we're put to the test and we just say lord help us god bless you tonight remember you are the temple of the holy ghost let him have his way let him have his way god bless you and as you as we celebrate i guess memorial day tomorrow just be safe remember one another go out of your way if i could say this way to be kind to someone even if they don't deserve it somebody was mean to you somebody treat them with some love and some some goodness and let that have an effect to them sometimes we get that well i owe it back to them i owed a debt i could not pay and he paid a debt he did not owe what a great example we have say lord in your mercy and your grace to me extend that to somebody else amen i love him i love him because he first loved me [Music] because he first love me [Music] and purchased my salvation [Music] just one more time i love him because he first loved me and purchased my salvation on god bless you as you go we'll give the glory to jesus [Music] i'm sorry the glory to jesus [Music] we'll give the glory to jesus and tell of his wonderful love [Music] for those of you that laughed and i saw you as we try to get the key one of you come up and play the piano and the other one you come up the song lead oh that's okay sometimes it happens we'll give a glory to jesus and tell of his [Music] give the glory to jesus tell of his wonderful love will give our glory to [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
