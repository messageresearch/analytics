[12:38] how many knows a piece of god in their
[12:40] life
[12:42] when everything else seems to be upside
[12:44] down and going wrong there's something
[12:45] about that peace of god
[12:48] we have a couple of prayer requests and
[12:53] i pray it's good to see sister shirley
[12:55] moore here with us
[12:56] says the
[12:58] eye surgery went well so
[13:01] the eyelid surgery so
[13:03] thank the lord for that all is in god's
[13:07] hands everything goes well so we
[13:09] appreciate that
[13:10] also
[13:12] if you saw the what's happened sister
[13:14] green
[13:17] she had been taken to the hospital and
[13:19] the blood test said she had had a heart
[13:20] attack
[13:22] but
[13:24] as they did all the tests and all
[13:26] they didn't find any serious damage
[13:28] everything and she went home today
[13:30] so i praise praise the lord and
[13:32] appreciate that so
[13:35] sister bethany carey i see you here
[13:37] today and
[13:39] dad put in a prayer request for you
[13:40] about a bad cold
[13:43] so
[13:44] i didn't know there was good
[13:46] colds the lord the deliberate thought we
[13:49] just believe that
[13:51] also like you to remember again
[13:53] we had been praying for my boss jim
[13:55] briggs father
[13:56] who is doing well considering he's 93
[13:59] years old and
[14:01] assisted living now but
[14:03] jim is the youngest of four
[14:05] he's 62 and his older brothers and
[14:08] sisters and
[14:10] all of them are quite sick and
[14:12] they put his oldest sister
[14:14] fran
[14:15] in uh
[14:16] [Music]
[14:18] what he called a hospice with
[14:19] she was no longer responding to lady
[14:21] gibber
[14:23] anytime really so
[14:25] he had taken yesterday off to take dad
[14:27] to see her and
[14:29] spent some time but
[14:30] he's always mentioned it to me says
[14:32] because i know your church prays so
[14:34] and i believe
[14:36] we're not here for ourselves we're here
[14:38] for others
[14:40] because
[14:41] it's not something you just say it's all
[14:43] for me but
[14:44] it should be flowing rivers of living
[14:46] water should be flowing for others to
[14:48] receive and
[14:50] and so i
[14:52] we take the time and we ask them when i
[14:54] hear i just say so what can you tell me
[14:56] what can you say and and i know that
[14:59] they were raised christian
[15:01] and he knows that there is a god so
[15:04] we would we would believe that
[15:06] we would pray for him so if you'll stand
[15:08] with me
[15:09] [Music]
[15:11] before we start let's just just bow our
[15:13] heads and we'll include these in prayer
[15:15] and just
[15:16] believe that he's the same yesterday
[15:18] today and forever so lord jesus as we
[15:20] bow our heads
[15:22] first we want to say thank you lord for
[15:24] your mercy and your grace thank you for
[15:26] providing for all the needs that we have
[15:29] lord and

[15:39] the ones that we have and sometimes the

[20:16] god's mercy and grace so
[20:18] nothing but the blood
[20:21] nothing but the blood i appreciated
[20:24] brother peter's
[20:25] ministering on
[20:27] sunday night
[20:29] about the the only way
[20:31] the only true worship that is accepted
[20:34] and it's through the shed blood
[20:37] what can wash away my sins nothing but
[20:40] the blood of jesus
[20:42] what can wash away my
[20:47] [Music]
[21:01] nothing but the blood of jesus
[21:08] precious
[21:09] [Music]
[21:25] i know
[21:40] nothing but
[21:52] nothing but the blood of jesus
[21:58] oh
[22:01] [Music]
[22:38] that i
[22:42] [Music]
[23:14] and this is
[23:17] [Music]
[23:18] [Applause]
[23:20] [Music]
[23:27] is
[23:29] [Music]
[23:45] [Applause]
[23:48] [Music]
[23:55] is
[24:01] [Music]
[24:19] my
[24:21] [Music]
[24:36] is
[24:43] [Music]
[25:12] nothing but the blood of jesus
[25:30] [Music]
[25:46] amen
[25:48] you could work hard for good works
[25:51] and there's nothing wrong about being
[25:53] kind and loving and all that should be
[25:55] the attribute
[25:56] but when you try to put that and present
[25:58] it to god it doesn't mean anything
[26:01] no it's been the precious blood of jesus
[26:04] brother tim was that a praise that you
[26:05] put up there
[26:08] you want to say it from there loudly so
[26:10] we can hear you
[26:18] i praise god amen so
[26:20] prayer changes things amen that's a
[26:23] thing so amen
[26:26] that god should love
[26:28] a sinner such as i
[26:32] just sometimes you get to looking at
[26:34] yourself and you say why would he love
[26:36] me
[26:37] but don't question them accept it
[26:40] i always said that
[26:42] it's hard to receive a gift without
[26:44] thinking you owe something back
[26:46] a gift is a gift
[26:48] but when somebody gives you a gift you
[26:50] automatically now i got to give them
[26:51] something back
[26:53] but he loved us
[26:56] i like the way brother green said
[26:58] it showed it one day and he explained it
[27:00] this way and he said
[27:02] god loved you perfectly
[27:05] holy completely
[27:07] he said
[27:09] you can't make him love you more because
[27:11] he's loved you fully
[27:14] and you can't make him love you less
[27:16] because he loves you fully
[27:18] so he said what can i do i can love him
[27:20] more
[27:21] i can appreciate him
[27:24] that god
[27:27] [Music]
[27:39] [Applause]
[27:42] how wonderful is
[27:48] such
[27:57] [Applause]
[27:58] [Music]
[28:05] is
[28:17] is
[28:20] [Music]
[28:34] is
[28:52] uh
[28:57] [Music]
[29:22] if
[29:26] love
[29:28] such
[29:41] [Music]
[29:45] is
[29:51] [Music]
[29:55] he asks me
[30:08] open on his arms
[30:20] [Music]
[30:39] amen amen
[30:41] [Music]
[30:42] you're probably wondering why the
[30:44] preacher's sitting in the front row
[30:45] today
[30:47] why are you sitting there with a lot now
[30:50] yesterday
[30:51] probably mid-morning or so it just felt
[30:53] my heart to call brother lyle
[30:54] [Music]
[30:56] i said she'd call him and make sure
[30:57] everything's ready everything's going
[30:59] put it off kept working
[31:01] a little later i said call him
[31:04] i'd put it off some more and it was late
[31:06] afternoon early evening finally called
[31:08] him i said brother lyle how's things
[31:10] going
[31:12] and i could hear in his voice kind of
[31:13] like um
[31:14] i said well i just felt my heart to tell
[31:16] you if sunday would be better you think
[31:18] would be more comfortable for you that
[31:19] would be all right
[31:21] and he said i just i know i have the
[31:23] thought i just can't get it out so thank
[31:24] you very much brother
[31:27] and sometimes it is like that you know
[31:29] the thoughts you're doing but trying to
[31:31] to fill the young shinto so
[31:33] tonight we're going to listen to a
[31:35] message
[31:36] called the perfection preaching 57
[31:40] and i was looking at another tape and i
[31:42] saw this when i just started listening
[31:44] to it this afternoon i said oh my
[31:46] goodness
[31:47] ties in perfectly with what brother
[31:49] peter was speaking on
[31:52] on sunday evening but
[31:54] it's
[31:55] the crucifixion he calls it the
[31:57] perfection
[31:58] and it's such love it's what it comes
[32:02] down to it's god's perfect love so
[32:05] it's about 70 minutes long and we'll
[32:07] listen to that but let's just sing one
[32:09] more song before
[32:11] before we go into
[32:14] i can't quite see the clock and i
[32:16] thought it was later in that but that's
[32:17] not quite so
[32:19] i was just thinking
[32:21] about that song
[32:23] when he reached down his hand for me
[32:26] when you realize how much he's done for
[32:28] you and what it took for him to stoop
[32:30] down to as low as i was
[32:33] and said i'll go down and rescue
[32:36] maybe some of you he didn't have to go
[32:38] down so far but for some of us he had to
[32:39] go all the way down
[32:41] and i appreciate that
[32:46] [Music]
[32:56] and was wretched
[33:00] [Music]
[33:11] gave me peace
[33:14] [Music]
[33:37] when he
[33:38] reached down his
[33:41] hand for me
[33:47] i was lost
[33:49] [Music]
[33:53] god
[33:54] [Music]
[34:07] i was
[34:09] [Music]
[34:20] that i
[34:22] could
[34:26] [Music]
[34:28] [Applause]
[34:29] [Music]
[34:39] let's sing the next verse before the
[34:41] course
[34:49] [Music]
[34:57] from
[34:58] [Music]
[35:10] is
[35:13] [Music]
[35:37] when
[35:47] i was lost
[35:49] [Music]
[36:02] one more time
[36:04] [Music]
[36:29] is
[36:45] when
[36:53] [Music]
[37:05] i was lost
[37:07] [Music]
[37:24] you reach your hand up for him but
[37:26] that's because
[37:28] he reached for you
[37:30] you know it's sometimes hard to
[37:31] understand you you might feel i've i
[37:33] made this a temple but he had to draw
[37:35] him
[37:36] because the scripture tells no man
[37:38] coming to the father but by me his draws
[37:41] how many appreciate that
[37:43] as we get ready to to hear this the
[37:46] perfection let's let's stand
[37:49] sing only believe
[37:51] brother branham said the angel of the
[37:52] lord told him
[37:54] how that song please the lord he said if
[37:56] you get the people to believe
[37:58] and and sometimes
[38:00] we say lord i believe but help now my
[38:03] unbelief
[38:05] there's times as a human you get weak
[38:06] you get frustrated you look at something
[38:10] driving down the road today and the
[38:12] company truck is monitored
[38:14] for speed
[38:16] they sent me the report of my driving
[38:18] one time they're like wow it's a whole
[38:20] lot more than i thought
[38:22] how many times i break too hard how many
[38:23] times i took a curve too long how many
[38:25] times i was speeding
[38:27] different things like that and i said
[38:30] if they can do that with a module in the
[38:32] in the in the computer of the truck what
[38:34] can god watch and see
[38:37] so i was going down the road obeying the
[38:39] speed limit not because i wanted to
[38:41] quote unquote okay just be honest but
[38:43] because i knew i'd get in trouble if i
[38:45] didn't
[38:46] so there was this guy and he was just
[38:48] antsy behind me coming down tangerine
[38:50] road and he finally passed me up he i
[38:52] was doing 50 the speed limit and in a
[38:54] minute he was gone
[38:57] and this christian brother was thinking
[38:59] i hope there's a police down there to
[39:01] pull him over right now
[39:03] about halfway down i said but that's not
[39:05] the attitude just because i'm obeying
[39:07] the speed limit
[39:08] and he doesn't want to why should i be
[39:10] critical of him and lord you know i'm
[39:12] only obeying it because i have to
[39:15] so lord have mercy on me too
[39:18] i like the way god teaches us lessons at
[39:20] science and just
[39:21] simple enough to make us understand and
[39:23] i appreciate that
[39:25] let's sing that verse only beliefs
[39:30] [Music]
[39:42] are
[39:42] possible
[39:44] [Music]
[40:01] all things are possible
[40:06] [Music]
[40:09] now lord i believe
[40:11] oh
[40:13] lord i believe
[40:18] lord i
[40:23] all believe
[40:24] are possible
[40:26] [Music]
[40:34] lord i
[40:36] believe
[40:39] lord i believe
[40:43] all things
[40:46] [Music]
[40:53] lord bless you may be seated
[41:09] [Music]
[41:11] i have my quick friend here on the
[41:13] platform tonight dr lee baby
[41:16] first baptist church at lyme ohio who
[41:18] was one of my sponsors
[41:21] at the
[41:22] live meeting
[41:23] i asked him coming down tonight
[41:26] if he would just say a word to the
[41:27] congregation maybe pertaining to the
[41:29] lyman meeting for the next moment or two
[41:31] and i'm glad to happily introduce you
[41:34] tonight dr lee vale another baptist
[41:37] that's got the holy ghost
[41:42] god bless you
[41:44] thank you
[41:46] that was all pretty strong for a baptist
[41:49] pastor wasn't it
[41:53] well we're very happy to have brother
[41:55] bail with us and certainly the doors are
[41:57] open for him to come back and visit us
[42:00] at any time he can and now
[42:03] tonight
[42:04] tomorrow night is the uh the entombment
[42:08] of the lord jesus sunday morning is the
[42:11] six o'clock
[42:12] sunrise service and i believe the
[42:14] brother has announced the further part
[42:16] of the service
[42:17] now let us pray just a moment
[42:20] blessed lord thy word is truth amen
[42:24] and we're thankful for men who handle it
[42:27] fearless
[42:28] as they give it out to the people
[42:31] and as we open up the bible tonight or
[42:34] turn back its pages
[42:36] may the blessed holy ghost come and open
[42:39] the word of understanding to us
[42:42] through jesus christ we asked it amen
[42:49] this great night that we are celebrating
[42:53] of the crucifixion of our blessed lord
[42:57] i wish to read tonight from his own
[43:00] precious lips
[43:01] the words that he has
[43:04] had written in his book
[43:06] in saint
[43:08] matthews
[43:09] the fourth chapter
[43:11] we in the 47th and 48th verse we read
[43:15] this
[43:18] and if you salute your brethren only
[43:22] what do you more than others
[43:25] do not even the public and so
[43:28] but
[43:29] be ye therefore perfect
[43:32] even as your father which is in heaven
[43:36] is perfect
[43:38] and tonight we gave out that we were
[43:40] going to speak on the subject of
[43:43] perfection
[43:46] now we
[43:48] that seems like a very strange text to
[43:51] take for the night of the crucifixion
[43:55] of our lord but today perhaps you've
[43:58] been listening to the radio and hear the
[44:00] different messages and the messengers
[44:03] how they presented that great awful
[44:06] day when our lord died for the sins of
[44:10] the world so i have chosen tonight to go
[44:13] around a different way to get to it
[44:17] so it would be
[44:19] a little different it might refreshing
[44:22] you a little
[44:23] may the blessed holy spirit inspire the
[44:26] word now as we take the effort to bring
[44:29] it
[44:31] god
[44:32] requires perfection
[44:35] we want to bear that in mind
[44:39] that there's nothing just
[44:41] part way
[44:43] can go in the presence of god it must be
[44:47] perfect
[44:49] our worship everything
[44:52] i in the garden of eden
[44:55] god had adam and eve in the garden
[44:59] and they sinned and transgressed the
[45:02] laws of god
[45:04] by sinning disobedience
[45:08] and when transgression comes
[45:11] disobedience
[45:13] is the transgression of the law
[45:16] and the law of god him being holy
[45:21] just
[45:22] unadulterated holy
[45:24] therefore no spot of unholiness can ever
[45:29] stand in his presence
[45:32] so if sin came in the world by
[45:35] transgression
[45:37] then sin must be dealt with
[45:41] before the sinner can ever stand in the
[45:44] presence of god
[45:48] now
[45:51] if there is no law
[45:54] then there is no justice
[45:57] but
[45:58] law
[45:59] require justice requires a law
[46:04] and the law
[46:05] when it is
[46:07] it is uh recalled on
[46:10] it projects justice
[46:13] now by the law
[46:15] no flesh is saved
[46:17] now the law cannot save us
[46:21] the law was just the thing that put us
[46:23] in jail
[46:25] but it has no redeeming power
[46:29] the law only
[46:31] showed us that we were sinners and
[46:33] condemned us
[46:35] that's what law is to do
[46:38] it's to bring condemned
[46:40] nation or to show you where your mistake
[46:44] is
[46:46] so the law in itself could not save
[46:50] it could only
[46:51] prosecute
[46:54] and god
[46:55] being holy
[46:57] and just
[46:58] he had to have a prosecution
[47:02] he had to prosecute the sinner
[47:05] because he had overstepped the bounties
[47:08] of grace
[47:10] and has become a
[47:12] law-breaking
[47:14] citizen
[47:16] then he must be dealt with
[47:20] and the every law has a penalty
[47:24] for
[47:26] the penalty of
[47:28] transgressing god's law is death
[47:33] and it had to project
[47:35] death to the human race
[47:39] and all of the human race is under the
[47:43] penalty of this
[47:45] law
[47:48] now
[47:49] when adam and eve had sinned
[47:52] there was no
[47:54] way no other remedy
[47:58] that they could ever stand in the
[48:01] presence of god again except this
[48:04] sin be dealt with
[48:08] and no man can commit a sin
[48:12] of any type no matter how little or how
[48:16] big
[48:17] that individual sin has to be dealt with
[48:22] before
[48:23] the one who committed it can ever
[48:26] stand in the presence of the holy god
[48:31] so therefore
[48:33] when adam and eve had
[48:35] sinned
[48:36] and have transgressed the law they were
[48:39] subjects of death
[48:42] and the law had to be executed
[48:45] therefore it put all the human race
[48:49] under the penalty of death
[48:54] now if we can only
[48:56] settle down for a few moments now
[48:59] in our thinking
[49:02] and look at this great picture
[49:05] and remember that every person here is
[49:08] included in this
[49:12] every man and woman
[49:15] child is included
[49:18] in the penalty of death by the
[49:20] transgression of the head of the human
[49:23] race
[49:24] adam
[49:26] by his transgression every one of us
[49:29] fell victim to sin
[49:32] and sin must be dealt with
[49:37] and so god in his great
[49:40] infancy
[49:42] and his great love
[49:45] the law was to
[49:47] separate the sinner from his maker
[49:51] then he become annihilated
[49:55] and totally annihilated
[49:58] there would be no way for him to ever
[50:02] come back unless that sin was dealt with
[50:09] and it would be very easy then to
[50:12] believe in a total annihilation of the
[50:15] sinner at the end
[50:17] for he is completely forever
[50:21] separated from the presence of god
[50:26] now notice
[50:28] this sin
[50:30] and how
[50:32] god being just
[50:34] and he could do nothing else but be just
[50:38] for he is the resource of all justice
[50:44] then there would be nothing else for him
[50:46] to do but to place the penalty
[50:48] for this transgression
[50:51] and the penalty was death
[50:54] for he said the day you eat thereof that
[50:57] day
[50:58] thou shall surely die
[51:03] now it's a dark picture we have here
[51:07] but then if we go back just a little
[51:10] further
[51:12] and find out the very attributes of god
[51:17] the bible plainly tells us that god is
[51:21] love
[51:24] but yet being love he has to be just
[51:29] so
[51:30] love does not mean just the thing that
[51:33] can be petted and played with
[51:38] love
[51:40] is the justice of god
[51:45] now
[51:46] when god seen that his
[51:49] children have transgressed his law
[51:53] and that they must die the death
[51:56] then
[51:58] sovereign
[51:59] love stepped in to make a way
[52:04] for god seen that these children was to
[52:07] be
[52:08] absolutely
[52:10] totally annihilated from his presence
[52:14] there was nothing else to be done
[52:18] for they had transgressed
[52:20] his law and the penalty of his law was
[52:24] death
[52:26] and then
[52:28] love of god went out for his subjects
[52:32] and when divine love is projected
[52:36] sovereign grace produces the object of
[52:40] the love
[52:42] and god by foreign knowledge
[52:46] when he loved his
[52:48] race so well
[52:50] yet with the penalty he caused the
[52:53] substitutionary death to take place in
[52:56] the garden of eden amen that was he
[52:59] substituted an innocent
[53:02] creature
[53:04] a little lamb
[53:06] that no no sin
[53:09] and it went for a substitute
[53:13] to work
[53:15] and to die
[53:16] in the stead of the guilty sinner
[53:21] and it was a lamb
[53:23] slain
[53:25] to
[53:26] hold the life
[53:28] of his subjects
[53:32] all through the old testament
[53:35] they offered the blood of lambs and
[53:37] goats
[53:39] sheep
[53:40] bulls and heifers
[53:42] a substitutionary
[53:44] death
[53:46] but all in the great economy of god
[53:50] there was back in his mind
[53:53] the real
[53:56] coming
[53:57] which would be them were shadows
[54:01] of the real object that was to come
[54:06] and the real object was to come was his
[54:09] only begotten son
[54:13] all the lambs that died was only a
[54:17] shadow
[54:19] and a shadow is only the negative side
[54:23] of an object
[54:25] and they only spoke of calvary coming
[54:32] now
[54:33] for a picture of this let's turn in our
[54:35] bibles
[54:37] to the book of hebrews
[54:39] and pick up here what paul
[54:42] the great apostle speaking
[54:45] trying to separate these things for us
[54:49] in the 10th chapter of the book of
[54:52] hebrews we read this
[54:54] and i just love the word
[54:58] the word is the truth
[55:00] and i like to read it before my
[55:03] congregation because i know that in the
[55:06] judgment i'll stand with them
[55:10] now i've got to give an account
[55:12] so if i bring it from the word
[55:17] then
[55:18] i'll not be guilty because it's the word
[55:21] and god's responsible for his word
[55:27] we see so much today
[55:29] of evangelists and so forth building up
[55:32] around personalities
[55:34] oh it's a disgraceful thing
[55:38] and we find out in going into churches
[55:41] we go into church and you find
[55:44] a certain pastor
[55:46] he's got some little peculiar act about
[55:49] him
[55:50] some little emotion
[55:52] if you don't notice the entire
[55:55] congregation will take that spirit
[56:00] if he's just a little emotional or jerks
[56:02] his head or some little odd thing well
[56:05] the whole church will take on to that
[56:10] and we've got today in our modern
[56:12] churches the word it's sensations and
[56:15] little things like that and it's got
[56:17] such a confusion
[56:19] but oh my beloved brethren
[56:23] if there ever was a time
[56:26] that we ought to be on the word it's
[56:29] today
[56:33] you see
[56:35] i would hate to stand at the judgment
[56:38] and know that i had some little ficklety
[56:41] something
[56:42] of a lose peculiar revelation and misled
[56:46] people i don't want them to have my
[56:49] spirit
[56:51] on my action
[56:52] but i want them to have god's spirit by
[56:56] god's word
[56:58] that produces truth
[57:01] so on this
[57:03] great occasion tonight
[57:06] i would like to read from god's eternal
[57:09] word
[57:11] now we realize
[57:13] that the law existed
[57:16] for many years
[57:18] but the law could never take away sin
[57:22] as i have said in the past
[57:25] it was just a
[57:27] jail house
[57:29] it was
[57:30] the great detective
[57:32] that told you what you had done but had
[57:36] no remedy to deliver you
[57:39] it puts you in the pawn shop
[57:42] but there was no
[57:44] redeemer to take you out with it
[57:47] it only
[57:48] prisoned you
[57:50] to let you know that you was a sinner
[57:54] but now notice in hebrews the 10th
[57:56] chapter as we read
[57:59] for the law having a shadow
[58:02] of good things to come
[58:05] and not the very image
[58:08] remember it was a
[58:11] shadow
[58:13] of an image to come
[58:17] a shadow only introduces
[58:20] that there is a image making the shadow
[58:27] a shadow of the things to come and not
[58:31] the very image
[58:34] notice
[58:36] all the things
[58:39] the very image of the things
[58:41] can never with those
[58:44] sacrifices
[58:46] which were offered
[58:48] continually make the camera unto
[58:52] perfect
[58:54] now
[58:55] god in the beginning required
[58:58] perfection amen
[59:02] jesus when he come to earth said be
[59:05] ye
[59:06] perfect
[59:08] like god in heaven is perfect
[59:12] and the law having a shadow of things to
[59:16] come could never make the worshiper
[59:19] perfect
[59:22] you got the picture
[59:25] now
[59:27] let's go it again so you'll be sure not
[59:30] to miss it
[59:33] god requires
[59:35] perfect holiness
[59:39] no
[59:40] one can stand in his image with one
[59:44] little speck of sin
[59:48] jesus witnessed the same and said be
[59:52] perfect
[59:53] just like god in heaven is perfect
[59:58] and the bible said that the law could
[1:00:02] never with its sacrifices
[1:00:05] make the comer
[1:00:07] perfect
[1:00:09] then the law could not perfect anything
[1:00:14] it was only a pointer
[1:00:19] these sacrifices made every year
[1:00:23] could never make the worshiper perfect
[1:00:26] so therefore no one under the law or
[1:00:29] keeping of laws or under the shadows
[1:00:32] could be perfect
[1:00:36] for second verse
[1:00:38] then would they not
[1:00:41] have ceased to been offered
[1:00:46] if there is anything that i can do
[1:00:51] to make myself perfect in the presence
[1:00:54] of god
[1:00:55] then christ did not have to die for me
[1:01:00] if there's one thing that you can do
[1:01:05] that would merit anything in the
[1:01:07] presence of god
[1:01:09] then christ died in vain
[1:01:14] no law keeping
[1:01:17] no legalistic ideas of yours
[1:01:20] none of your own holiness
[1:01:23] no things that you could quit doing
[1:01:26] quit lying quick stealing
[1:01:28] quit smoking tobacco quit going to the
[1:01:31] picture shows
[1:01:32] still you are lost
[1:01:38] nothing can do it
[1:01:40] joining churches
[1:01:41] rituals
[1:01:42] ceremonies baptisms
[1:01:45] orders of the church
[1:01:47] reading of creeds saying of prayers
[1:01:50] all
[1:01:51] those things would count nothing
[1:01:57] you are lost
[1:01:59] not one thing can you do in yourself
[1:02:06] you are a sinner
[1:02:09] under condemnation
[1:02:13] and there's not no way within yourself
[1:02:17] or any
[1:02:18] creed are any
[1:02:21] thing that you could do or think of of
[1:02:25] yourself that could merit one thing in
[1:02:28] the presence of god amen
[1:02:31] because you are a sinner to start with
[1:02:36] and the bible declares that we were all
[1:02:39] born in sin
[1:02:44] shaped in iniquity
[1:02:46] come to the world speaking lies
[1:02:52] and god could not take one man to die
[1:02:55] for the other
[1:02:57] because one is just as guilty as the
[1:03:01] other
[1:03:05] in the presence of god
[1:03:08] the archbishop born in this world was as
[1:03:11] guilty as the lowest barfly in the city
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:17] one can not atone for the other
[1:03:23] therefore he took an innocent life of an
[1:03:26] animal
[1:03:28] a little lamb
[1:03:31] and under the old testament the law was
[1:03:34] when a man sinned
[1:03:36] he brought the lamb to the altar
[1:03:40] say if he transgressed any of the
[1:03:43] commandments
[1:03:45] he brought the lamb
[1:03:47] and he laid it on the altar
[1:03:50] he laid his hands upon the land
[1:03:54] and he
[1:03:56] confessed these sins that he was wrong
[1:04:00] and know that he was guilty
[1:04:03] of and was the law required death
[1:04:07] and he brought the lamb and he stood
[1:04:11] and when he the throat of the little
[1:04:14] animal was cut
[1:04:16] and it's beginning to kick its little
[1:04:18] feet
[1:04:19] and bladey
[1:04:21] if you ever seen a lamb slaughtered
[1:04:25] what a pitiful cry
[1:04:28] the poor little fellow trying to blate
[1:04:31] and his little jugger veins cut
[1:04:35] and as he kicks
[1:04:37] and squivers
[1:04:39] and as he straightens out then quivers
[1:04:42] again
[1:04:43] and breaks and the blood gushes
[1:04:47] it bathes his little wool
[1:04:50] and the worshiper's hands
[1:04:53] and as a worshiper
[1:04:55] realizing for committing adultery
[1:04:58] for lying stealing
[1:05:01] whatever his guilt was
[1:05:05] or even evil thinking
[1:05:09] whatever it was in the least shadow he
[1:05:12] was guilty
[1:05:16] because it was his nature
[1:05:20] he was a guilty person
[1:05:22] not maybe by bizarre but by nature he
[1:05:27] was guilty
[1:05:30] and he had to recognize that this
[1:05:33] innocent little lamb died in his place
[1:05:37] and he felt sorry for the little thing
[1:05:41] but the man as soon as the lamb finally
[1:05:44] died
[1:05:45] with the blood of the lamb upon his
[1:05:47] hands
[1:05:48] he walked from the building with the
[1:05:51] same desire in his heart that he had at
[1:05:54] the beginning
[1:05:57] why
[1:05:59] because the life that was in the little
[1:06:02] lamb
[1:06:04] life lays in the blood
[1:06:07] your life is in your blood
[1:06:10] we know that
[1:06:11] and the life in the blood of the lamb
[1:06:14] was animal life
[1:06:17] therefore when its little car puzzles
[1:06:20] were broken
[1:06:22] and the life went out of the animal
[1:06:26] it could not come back to the worshiper
[1:06:29] because the worshiper was a human being
[1:06:35] the blood made a covering
[1:06:39] but it could not perfectly atone
[1:06:42] for the man left the building with the
[1:06:45] same desire to sin as he had in the
[1:06:48] first place
[1:06:51] but doing this
[1:06:53] he was looking forward
[1:06:56] to a time
[1:06:57] when there would be a perfect lamb come
[1:07:05] and he did it on the burnt offering
[1:07:08] because it was the only way he knew
[1:07:11] about
[1:07:14] so you see when the blood was pouring
[1:07:17] and the life went from the animal it
[1:07:20] could not come back to the man
[1:07:22] for one was animal
[1:07:24] one was man
[1:07:26] an innocent animal to a guilty man
[1:07:30] but oh
[1:07:31] one day
[1:07:34] some 2 000 years ago
[1:07:38] the lamb of god was born down in a
[1:07:41] little manger
[1:07:44] in bethlehem
[1:07:45] and was led like a sheep to its
[1:07:48] slaughter
[1:07:49] some 1900 years ago this afternoon at 3
[1:07:53] o'clock
[1:07:55] he died the spotless blemish lamb of god
[1:08:00] hung on calvary's cross and died forever
[1:08:02] sinner amen
[1:08:05] now
[1:08:06] when the worshiper
[1:08:08] comes to this land by faith
[1:08:13] and this is a different type of land
[1:08:17] amen it's not a land like the other
[1:08:20] no man can come to this lamb except god
[1:08:25] draws him first
[1:08:29] you see god's sovereignty
[1:08:31] oh i hope this soaks way down deep now
[1:08:36] look god know he had sheep in this world
[1:08:42] he knowed he was going to have people to
[1:08:45] be saved
[1:08:47] and his love looked down and seen those
[1:08:50] who would be saved therefore by for
[1:08:54] knowledge he predestinated a church to
[1:08:57] meet any other without spock or randall
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:02] and if god required a church without
[1:09:05] spot or ankle he had to have something
[1:09:08] to make it that way
[1:09:11] he could not require his justice his
[1:09:15] judgments could not let him as such a
[1:09:18] thing if there wasn't a way to make it
[1:09:21] forever and man can not do it in himself
[1:09:27] amen he's a total failure
[1:09:30] god let him see that through the law
[1:09:32] through the judges and through all the
[1:09:34] old testament
[1:09:36] he sent the prophets he sent the
[1:09:38] righteous man
[1:09:40] and they found out that everyone
[1:09:43] failed
[1:09:45] so god by his sovereign grace
[1:09:50] sent from the portals of glory his only
[1:09:54] begotten son to take our place
[1:09:58] remember if he said for the pope of rome
[1:10:02] to take it he could not have done it
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:07] if he'd have said for the archbishop of
[1:10:09] canterbury to do it he could not have
[1:10:12] done it
[1:10:14] amen if he would have called on the most
[1:10:17] holy reverend father
[1:10:20] or bishop of the world
[1:10:24] he could not have done it
[1:10:27] he had been just as far rejected as
[1:10:30] judas is carrick what
[1:10:32] amen
[1:10:33] he could not do it
[1:10:36] because he was born in sin
[1:10:39] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:10:42] speaking lies and needed atonement for
[1:10:44] himself
[1:10:48] hallelujah
[1:10:51] but there came one from the portals of
[1:10:56] glory none other
[1:10:59] not a man
[1:11:01] not a good man
[1:11:04] neither a junior a gentile
[1:11:07] he was nothing less than
[1:11:09] almighty god hid in human flesh
[1:11:12] [Applause]
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:16] he came himself to offer his own blood
[1:11:23] for it did not come to sex
[1:11:27] sex had nothing to do with it
[1:11:30] but he overshadowed a virgin
[1:11:34] and brought forth from a blood cell that
[1:11:36] he created himself
[1:11:42] the innocent one
[1:11:43] then my salvation yours tonight does not
[1:11:47] hinge upon the merits of our own acts
[1:11:51] it ends up on the positive sovereign
[1:11:54] grace of almighty god who has chosen us
[1:12:02] certainly
[1:12:03] i could never be perfect nor you could
[1:12:06] never be perfect and we don't claim to
[1:12:08] be perfect but we have this one
[1:12:12] consolation that our faith rests in a
[1:12:15] perfect sacrifice that's already been
[1:12:19] received
[1:12:22] then how do we know that we get that
[1:12:25] when the worshiper puts his
[1:12:28] hands by faith
[1:12:30] upon the body of the lord
[1:12:34] jesus and feels the tear of sin
[1:12:39] and the mark of spit in his own face
[1:12:44] feels the groanings of gethsemane
[1:12:47] the agonies of cavalry and knows that
[1:12:50] he's guilty
[1:12:52] and confesses his sins correctly o
[1:12:57] blessed lord
[1:13:00] i am guilty
[1:13:03] and i have no other way but you to help
[1:13:07] me
[1:13:09] and by faith you're bidding the holy
[1:13:12] spirit has come
[1:13:15] and bids me come and i'm now by faith
[1:13:19] except jesus as my personal savior
[1:13:23] am i
[1:13:24] that life that come from him on calvary
[1:13:27] called the holy ghost which was hid in
[1:13:30] the blood cell of the lord jesus returns
[1:13:34] to the worshipper and baptizes him with
[1:13:37] the holy ghost into the body of christ
[1:13:40] amen and he's already judged
[1:13:44] amen you don't have to worry about
[1:13:46] judgment
[1:13:47] as i turn and look at that little
[1:13:49] crucifix
[1:13:51] i realize that that is
[1:13:54] represents his body
[1:13:57] and now
[1:13:59] that body has already been judged
[1:14:03] god can't justly judge it again
[1:14:06] for it's already judged amen
[1:14:10] god struck the judgments of death upon
[1:14:14] that body
[1:14:17] and as long
[1:14:18] as i can find a way
[1:14:22] to get hid in that body
[1:14:25] his judgment was struck for me and for
[1:14:28] you
[1:14:30] we are free
[1:14:32] romans 8 1
[1:14:34] said there is therefore now no
[1:14:37] condemnation
[1:14:38] to them that are in christ jesus that
[1:14:42] walk not after the flesh but at jesus
[1:14:46] there you are
[1:14:49] no condemnation
[1:14:52] i don't care what comes or what those
[1:14:55] you are hid beneath the blood
[1:15:00] again how do we get into that body
[1:15:03] first corinthians 12 13
[1:15:07] says that by
[1:15:09] spirit
[1:15:11] how does the spirit come to the
[1:15:13] sacrifice
[1:15:15] where did the spirit lay within the
[1:15:17] blood
[1:15:19] why couldn't the animal come back it was
[1:15:21] an animal
[1:15:23] the animal spirit could not come to the
[1:15:25] human spirit and do anything to it
[1:15:28] because the human spirit was a higher
[1:15:31] line of life than the animal
[1:15:34] but no other man's spirit could come
[1:15:37] back
[1:15:39] if you've got the spirit of some
[1:15:40] ancestor it's spiritualism
[1:15:44] but god himself came that his own spirit
[1:15:49] which is the highest
[1:15:51] line of spirit there is can come back by
[1:15:55] the form of the baptism of the holy
[1:15:58] spirit to the worshipper through the
[1:16:00] blood of christ and take him into the
[1:16:02] body
[1:16:04] he's safe
[1:16:07] watch
[1:16:08] the blood of bulls and goats would not
[1:16:10] work
[1:16:12] seeing it was weak
[1:16:13] now let's start reading
[1:16:15] about the 12th verse
[1:16:18] all right
[1:16:20] the blood of bulls and goats cannot work
[1:16:23] neither could it atone
[1:16:25] watch
[1:16:26] but this man
[1:16:28] what man
[1:16:31] the bishop
[1:16:33] the pope no
[1:16:36] but
[1:16:37] this man
[1:16:39] after he offered one sacrifice for sin
[1:16:44] forever
[1:16:46] sat down at the right hand of god
[1:16:50] amen
[1:16:52] from
[1:16:53] his fourth expectant tell his enemies be
[1:16:56] made his footstool
[1:16:58] are you ready
[1:17:00] are you ready for the word
[1:17:03] listen to this
[1:17:05] they don't want to you know let it sink
[1:17:08] down
[1:17:09] listen closely
[1:17:11] far by one offering
[1:17:15] not year by year not revival after
[1:17:18] revival
[1:17:19] not meeting after meeting not day after
[1:17:22] day
[1:17:23] but by one offering he has
[1:17:26] p-e-r-f-e-c-t-e-d
[1:17:30] they have he has
[1:17:33] by one offering he has perfected
[1:17:37] that's god's requirement
[1:17:39] for ever
[1:17:41] them that are sanctified america
[1:17:46] there you are
[1:17:47] that's the answer to the death of christ
[1:17:50] that's the answer to calvary
[1:17:52] he absolutely
[1:17:54] with his own blood purchased our sins
[1:17:58] and perfected forever his believers
[1:18:02] therefore in christ we stand blameless
[1:18:07] thank him
[1:18:09] in the presence of god almighty amen
[1:18:12] amen
[1:18:13] we are underprivileged people with our
[1:18:16] own doctrines
[1:18:18] we are being taught that we have to get
[1:18:20] up to a certain place we have to do a
[1:18:22] certain thing no my brother it's nothing
[1:18:26] you've done it's what god did for you
[1:18:30] we are now if we are justified by faith
[1:18:34] we are perfected forever in the presence
[1:18:37] of god
[1:18:40] then jesus said be therefore perfect
[1:18:42] then it was perfected forever
[1:18:45] god to the death of christ 1900 years
[1:18:49] ago today perfected the believer that he
[1:18:52] foresaw before the foundation world
[1:18:54] forever
[1:18:55] and those who he has called he has
[1:18:58] justified
[1:19:00] those who he foreknew he has called
[1:19:03] those who he has called he has justified
[1:19:06] those who he had justified he had
[1:19:09] already glorified
[1:19:12] he has perfected his believers now watch
[1:19:17] this go back now to the first verse
[1:19:21] the law having a shadow of good things
[1:19:23] to come
[1:19:25] and not the very image
[1:19:27] of those things
[1:19:29] can never with those
[1:19:31] sacrifices which were offered year by
[1:19:34] year continually
[1:19:35] make the calmer on to perfect what's
[1:19:38] perfect is what we're talking about
[1:19:41] for then they should not have
[1:19:44] ceased to be offered
[1:19:48] because
[1:19:49] that the worshiper once purged
[1:19:53] would have no more conscience of sin
[1:19:57] what do you mean
[1:19:58] the word conscience there and right
[1:20:00] interpretation is desire
[1:20:03] and if a man comes a worshiper correctly
[1:20:06] before christ
[1:20:08] seeing his suffering and he offers
[1:20:10] himself to christ
[1:20:12] and says oh lord god there's nothing in
[1:20:14] me that can atone but i'm wholly
[1:20:17] depending on you
[1:20:21] then that holy spirit comes into the
[1:20:25] human heart the very same question
[1:20:28] settled forever amen
[1:20:30] forever desired sin has been taken from
[1:20:33] you
[1:20:35] for if the law could have done that then
[1:20:38] sacrifices will not have deceased
[1:20:40] but being that it could not do it christ
[1:20:43] had to die
[1:20:45] to make us perfect
[1:20:47] friends
[1:20:48] there is so many things that we could
[1:20:51] say tonight about the profession
[1:20:54] we are always trying to gouge the eyes
[1:20:56] out of somebody else to make ourselves
[1:20:58] just a little holier than they are they
[1:21:00] are
[1:21:01] but if we only looked at the picture
[1:21:03] it's only god's grace that we are what
[1:21:05] we are
[1:21:07] there's some time ago
[1:21:10] i learned a lesson a hard way
[1:21:13] i was having a meeting down in ohio
[1:21:17] and i was staying out in the country
[1:21:19] because of the masses i cannot stay in
[1:21:22] the city
[1:21:23] we've been eating at a little dunkered
[1:21:25] restaurant
[1:21:26] and such lovely little waitresses and
[1:21:29] decently dressed and clean as they could
[1:21:31] be very ladylike waited on us
[1:21:34] it was a little spot of heaven
[1:21:38] so eat in such a place
[1:21:40] their kitchen was and span
[1:21:44] and
[1:21:45] on sunday they closed up
[1:21:48] and they went to their church
[1:21:50] i got a little hungry let's go to preach
[1:21:52] sunday afternoon
[1:21:54] and i
[1:21:55] went over to an ordinary little
[1:21:58] just a common little american restaurant
[1:22:02] to get something to eat
[1:22:04] and when i walked in the door what did i
[1:22:07] hear but a slot machine going
[1:22:11] and was standing there a man of my age
[1:22:13] which perhaps was a married man
[1:22:16] with his arm around a woman playing a
[1:22:19] slot machine
[1:22:21] our very law
[1:22:23] the protection of our righteousness of
[1:22:26] our goods we're standing there violating
[1:22:29] a thing that he is supposed to be
[1:22:31] protecting
[1:22:32] because it's illegal to gamble in ohio
[1:22:36] playing a slot machine
[1:22:39] and i turned and looked towards the back
[1:22:41] of the building
[1:22:42] there was a bunch of teenage boys in an
[1:22:45] old rock and roll
[1:22:47] records on the machine playing
[1:22:50] a young lady of about 18 years old very
[1:22:53] neatly
[1:22:54] uh an anatomy as a woman
[1:22:58] but she was standing there with her
[1:23:00] dress hanging low in the front and one
[1:23:03] of those boys with his hands on the girl
[1:23:06] where they did not belong
[1:23:09] and they were smoking and drinking
[1:23:11] and i thought oh
[1:23:13] god how can you stand it
[1:23:17] and i looked over to my right when i
[1:23:19] heard someone make out a big drone
[1:23:22] and there said an aged woman
[1:23:25] probably 60 years or 70 years old
[1:23:29] she had on those little old bugger
[1:23:31] clothes
[1:23:32] just about halfway up her limbs
[1:23:36] and her poor old wrinkled flesh was just
[1:23:39] as flabby as it could be
[1:23:42] and she had on this shirt lip makeup
[1:23:45] and a great big purple thing on the side
[1:23:48] of her face painted
[1:23:50] a little pair of shoes on sandals with
[1:23:53] purple toenails painted
[1:23:55] purple fingernails painted
[1:23:58] and her hair was cut real sharp and
[1:24:00] curled up and died blue
[1:24:03] and i looked at her and across the table
[1:24:06] set two man drunk
[1:24:09] one of them it was summertime with a big
[1:24:12] old army overcoat on with a gray scarf
[1:24:15] wrapped around his neck and if whiskers
[1:24:18] all over his face of belching and going
[1:24:21] on
[1:24:23] and they excuse herself the man did from
[1:24:26] her and started walking out like this to
[1:24:29] the restroom
[1:24:32] i stood there and i said god
[1:24:35] why don't you destroy the whole thing
[1:24:38] why don't you just sink it beneath the
[1:24:41] earth
[1:24:42] i said is my little sarah and rebecca
[1:24:46] going to have to grow up under such
[1:24:48] stuff is that
[1:24:50] i said how can you god in your great
[1:24:54] holiness ever stand to look at such a
[1:24:57] thing like that and not send an
[1:24:59] earthquake and sink it
[1:25:02] as i was standing there condemning the
[1:25:04] woman as i was
[1:25:07] i stepped back behind the door
[1:25:09] i felt the spirit of god come to me
[1:25:14] and i stepped behind the door and i seen
[1:25:16] like something whirling
[1:25:18] and when it was in the vision it was a
[1:25:21] world turning around and around
[1:25:25] and as i noticed around the world was a
[1:25:28] scarlet streak
[1:25:30] around the world
[1:25:32] and as i got to the world i seen myself
[1:25:36] just a little boy doing things that i
[1:25:39] ought not to do
[1:25:41] maybe not like that but it was sin
[1:25:45] and every time i did anything i seen
[1:25:48] that great black shadow go towards
[1:25:50] heaven which god would have killed me at
[1:25:53] that minute
[1:25:54] then our scene standing between me and
[1:25:58] god
[1:25:59] stood that perfect sacrifice
[1:26:03] i seen him standing there with the
[1:26:05] thorns on his head and his spit hanging
[1:26:08] on his face
[1:26:10] and every time my sins would start
[1:26:12] towards god he'd reach out and catch it
[1:26:16] like the bumper on the car he was
[1:26:18] protecting me from death
[1:26:21] and every time i do anything wrong god
[1:26:24] would have killed me certainly his
[1:26:25] holiness requires it
[1:26:27] his law requires it and every time i do
[1:26:30] anything or you do anything the blood of
[1:26:33] jesus christ acts like a bumper
[1:26:36] and i seen that scarlet street meant
[1:26:39] that then that the blood still holds the
[1:26:42] earth
[1:26:44] and as i stood looking
[1:26:47] i got a little closer to him as i
[1:26:49] noticed him now i can hear him say
[1:26:52] father forgive him he doesn't know what
[1:26:55] he's doing
[1:26:58] and i looked down in there laid a book
[1:27:02] and there's a recording angel there
[1:27:06] and standing by his side and every time
[1:27:09] i sinned it was put out on the book and
[1:27:12] my name was on it
[1:27:14] and i realized that someday
[1:27:18] ah that blood streak would be lifted and
[1:27:21] i'd have to stand in the presence of god
[1:27:23] with my sinful life
[1:27:26] but i seen by his mercy he was holding
[1:27:29] off my judgment
[1:27:31] i went to him humbly i knelt on my knees
[1:27:35] and i said oh jesus
[1:27:38] thou son of god
[1:27:40] i am unworthy to come in your presence
[1:27:44] but will you please forgive me for what
[1:27:47] i have done
[1:27:49] he touched his side with his hand
[1:27:52] tucked the old book and wrote pardon on
[1:27:54] it throwed it back behind him and my
[1:27:57] sins were gone
[1:28:00] then he looked me stern in the face he
[1:28:03] said now i have forgiven you
[1:28:06] but you want to condemn her
[1:28:10] then i've seen what it
[1:28:12] meant as i come out of the vision i
[1:28:15] walked over to her
[1:28:17] i said how do you do
[1:28:19] she was drinking she looked up at me and
[1:28:22] she said oh hello
[1:28:24] i said could i sit down she said i have
[1:28:27] company
[1:28:28] i said i don't need it in that way lady
[1:28:32] i just want to speak to you a minute she
[1:28:35] said be seated
[1:28:36] and i said lady
[1:28:39] just a few minutes ago standing at her
[1:28:42] behind that door
[1:28:45] i begin to tell her as i begin to look
[1:28:48] the tears begin to run down her cheeks
[1:28:52] and she told me i said lady you don't
[1:28:55] mean to do these things jesus died and
[1:28:59] the judgments of god is held off by his
[1:29:01] blood
[1:29:02] you don't mean to do this
[1:29:04] and she said no sir she said my father
[1:29:08] was a deacon in church i was raised in a
[1:29:11] christian home
[1:29:12] my husband and i were charter members
[1:29:15] and lived the christian life
[1:29:18] she began to tell me after his death she
[1:29:20] had two young girls and she went astray
[1:29:24] and how the girls had left her and she
[1:29:27] told her life away and she thought there
[1:29:29] was no more hope for her
[1:29:34] i said god be merciful those who he has
[1:29:38] four knew he has called
[1:29:41] amen
[1:29:42] she said are you reverend branham from
[1:29:45] daddy i said i am she said i'm ashamed
[1:29:48] of myself to be sitting here like this
[1:29:52] she said do you think there would be a
[1:29:55] chance for me
[1:29:57] i said jesus has his arm stretched out
[1:30:01] waiting for you to come lady
[1:30:06] and the other people begin to take up
[1:30:09] and i said would you walk out here on
[1:30:12] this floor with me
[1:30:13] she said i will sir i took her by the
[1:30:16] hand
[1:30:17] i said you're about the age of my mother
[1:30:20] would you kneel there with me the floor
[1:30:22] and there in the floor we broke up that
[1:30:26] place that afternoon to an old-fashioned
[1:30:29] meeting and god saved that woman by his
[1:30:33] grace
[1:30:34] am i she dressed yourself and come to
[1:30:37] the meeting and as far as i know living
[1:30:40] a christian life tonight amen what is it
[1:30:43] oh
[1:30:44] god requires perfection he requires your
[1:30:48] repentance he requires your loyalty to
[1:30:52] him but he's looking tonight no matter
[1:30:55] how much you sin
[1:30:57] how little or how much you are still a
[1:31:00] sinner and cannot get in no other way
[1:31:03] but by jesus christ god's all-sufficient
[1:31:06] sacrifice and in him you are perfected
[1:31:09] forever
[1:31:12] think of it
[1:31:13] it's not nothing you do it's not new
[1:31:16] pages you turn it's not a new life you
[1:31:19] start it's a confession of your wrong
[1:31:22] and god's grace to you
[1:31:25] that brings you to perfection and you
[1:31:28] are perfected in jesus christ
[1:31:32] i trust tonight friend of mine
[1:31:35] while we are here at this great crucial
[1:31:38] moment now when decisions must be made
[1:31:41] after hearing this story you might have
[1:31:43] never heard it before
[1:31:45] but you can't go out one of those doors
[1:31:47] the same person you come in
[1:31:50] you must go out better or worse
[1:31:53] and while we bow our heads just a moment
[1:31:55] i want you to thank mightily about it
[1:31:59] what about your soul tonight
[1:32:02] jesus christ died for you you say
[1:32:05] brother branham when i can get quit
[1:32:06] smoking when i can quit drinking when i
[1:32:09] can straighten this thing up i'll do it
[1:32:11] oh it will never be done right
[1:32:16] you'll never be able to do it
[1:32:19] why don't you just come the way you are
[1:32:22] and by faith go to that stream thy
[1:32:26] flowing wound supply
[1:32:29] then redeeming love to be your theme and
[1:32:33] shall be till
[1:32:35] you die
[1:32:37] why take a substitute while i try to get
[1:32:39] in by your church why try to come in
[1:32:42] because you quit drinking or quit lying
[1:32:45] come by the way of perfection
[1:32:48] for about one sacrifice
[1:32:52] he has perfected forever
[1:32:55] those that are sanctified
[1:32:57] how do i get sanctified confess your
[1:33:00] sins in the presence of the blood of
[1:33:03] jesus and the life that come from that
[1:33:06] blood comes back to the worshiper and
[1:33:08] sanctifies him from the desires of the
[1:33:11] things of the world
[1:33:13] for about that all sufficient sacrifice
[1:33:17] he has
[1:33:18] sanctified us one spirit we are all
[1:33:22] baptized into one body
[1:33:24] now there's no condemnation to them
[1:33:26] which are in christ jesus
[1:33:29] to them that walk not after the flesh
[1:33:32] but the spirit
[1:33:34] if you're trying to walk by the spirit
[1:33:37] and still lusting for the flesh the
[1:33:39] sacrifice hasn't been sufficiently
[1:33:42] applied to you
[1:33:45] but the worshiper once purged
[1:33:49] has no more desire of sin
[1:33:52] that was calvary
[1:33:54] it isn't a place to sell flowers or a
[1:33:58] little place to do this or that it was a
[1:34:00] place where god and men were reconciled
[1:34:04] it was a place where peace and perfect
[1:34:07] safety was brought to mankind
[1:34:10] can you go with me tonight my sinner

[1:34:57] while we wait just a moment over your
[1:35:00] own my right hand side
[1:35:03] surely there's one along there
[1:35:05] are you ashamed of your sins
[1:35:10] are you ashamed of what you've done
[1:35:13] the world tonight is looking for heroes
[1:35:18] and it has heroes physically speaking
[1:35:22] one day younger in switzerland once
[1:35:25] switzerland was at stake the little
[1:35:26] swiss party
[1:35:28] had gathered out into the fields to
[1:35:30] defend their economy
[1:35:33] the great oncoming army was too great
[1:35:35] for them they were all trained had big
[1:35:37] spears and shields
[1:35:40] the swiss could do nothing but give up
[1:35:42] they were backed up against the mountain
[1:35:45] then there was a hero stepped out
[1:35:48] somebody had to die
[1:35:51] and if they
[1:35:52] lost the battle they had nothing old
[1:35:54] sickle blades and rocks sticks to fight
[1:35:56] with
[1:35:57] when the oncoming army looked like a
[1:36:00] brick wall
[1:36:02] if they were taken their lovely little
[1:36:05] wives would be ravished their young
[1:36:07] girls would be ravished their babies
[1:36:09] would be killed their heads would be
[1:36:10] busted
[1:36:12] their homes would be gone everything
[1:36:14] would be lost
[1:36:16] then there was a man whose name is too
[1:36:18] quickly forgotten
[1:36:20] by the name of arnold von wicklord
[1:36:24] he stepped out and said man of
[1:36:25] switzerland
[1:36:27] this day i give my life for switzerland
[1:36:30] he said just over the mountain honor is
[1:36:33] a little white home
[1:36:35] i've got a wife and three children
[1:36:37] waiting for me
[1:36:38] but they'll never see me again
[1:36:42] for this day i'd give my life for
[1:36:45] switzerland
[1:36:48] they said what will you do arnold von
[1:36:50] week lord he said follow me and do the
[1:36:53] best you can with what you have to do
[1:36:55] with
[1:36:57] and he looked over the army
[1:36:59] until he found the thickest of the
[1:37:01] spears
[1:37:02] then he stuck up his hands in the air
[1:37:05] he run towards that big brick wall of
[1:37:08] spears and screaming make way for
[1:37:11] liberty
[1:37:13] make way for liberty
[1:37:16] a hundred spears turn to catch his
[1:37:18] charge
[1:37:19] he threw his arms out and grouped them
[1:37:21] into his own bosom which pinned him down
[1:37:24] and he died on the end of those spears
[1:37:27] those swiss followed him with clubs and
[1:37:29] sticks
[1:37:30] that great display of heroism rotted
[1:37:33] that army till the swiss beat them out
[1:37:35] of the land and they've never had a war
[1:37:37] from that day since
[1:37:40] stand up in switzerland and name the
[1:37:41] name of the arnold von winkler
[1:37:44] you'll see tears run down their cheeks
[1:37:46] why he saved the land
[1:37:48] that was a great hero deed
[1:37:51] it's seldom compared with and never
[1:37:54] exceeded
[1:37:55] in this earth but oh it was a little
[1:37:58] thing to what happened one day
[1:38:01] when adam's race stood
[1:38:04] demons marching in from every side
[1:38:08] prophets had failed
[1:38:10] law had failed
[1:38:12] sacrifice of bulls and lambs had failed
[1:38:15] man's nature had failed
[1:38:17] everything and adam's little race stood
[1:38:21] defeated
[1:38:22] outnumbered by devils
[1:38:25] superstitions
[1:38:27] sickness diseases
[1:38:29] there was one stepped out in heaven
[1:38:32] and said this day i'll die for adam's
[1:38:35] race
[1:38:36] he came to the earth and was made flesh
[1:38:40] he looked like down where the midst of
[1:38:42] the spears was the darkest
[1:38:45] the very darkest
[1:38:47] of all man's dreads was death and he
[1:38:50] took death into his bosoming on calvary
[1:38:55] he paid the sacrifice and scream make a
[1:38:59] way for liberty
[1:39:00] and he screams to his church take this
[1:39:03] which i have left you my blood and my

[1:41:53] christ is on your hand pilate tried it
[1:41:56] this morning along about six
[1:41:58] o'clock but his hands are still bloody
[1:42:02] guilty bloody
[1:42:05] you know what happened to him
[1:42:07] he went up in switzerland many years
[1:42:09] later lost his mind
[1:42:11] plunged himself to death in a pool of
[1:42:14] water
[1:42:15] this morning in switzerland
[1:42:18] hundreds of people come to watch the
[1:42:20] scene
[1:42:22] blue water boils up the bottom of that
[1:42:25] big hole of
[1:42:26] water they do it every year it's an old
[1:42:29] legend they say
[1:42:31] that god refused water to cleanse his
[1:42:34] hands
[1:42:36] brother no matter how many times you're
[1:42:37] baptized whatever you try to do
[1:42:40] nothing will cleanse your hands but the
[1:42:42] blood of christ

[1:42:48] two thousand years nearly still ball up
[1:42:52] god refuses it your self righteousness
[1:42:55] cannot cleanse your sins nothing but the
[1:42:58] blood of jesus
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:00] think of it now we're going to pray just
[1:43:02] a moment
[1:43:04] i wonder if i could ask something
[1:43:06] tonight
[1:43:07] when he stood there at pilate's judgment
[1:43:10] hall
[1:43:11] this morning
[1:43:12] and said if my kingdom was of this world
[1:43:16] i could speak to my father and
[1:43:18] straightway he would send me 12 legions
[1:43:21] of angels
[1:43:22] when one of them could destroy the world
[1:43:25] i speak to him in 12 legions of angels
[1:43:28] to be right at my disposal
[1:43:32] he could have done it
[1:43:33] but he stood there meek and humble
[1:43:36] to take your death and take your sins
[1:43:40] will you be grateful enough for that
[1:43:42] sacrifice tonight you who are needy of
[1:43:44] it and needy of god's blessings would
[1:43:46] you stand to your feet for this prayer
[1:43:49] just stand up to your feet you who want
[1:43:50] to be remembered in this prayer saying
[1:43:53] god be merciful to me i'm guilty i've
[1:43:55] done things wrong and i now want to
[1:43:58] accept my pardon through christ jesus
[1:44:01] will you come to your feet just at this
[1:44:03] time
[1:44:06] god bless you young lady
[1:44:08] that's a courage just remain standing
[1:44:09] there
[1:44:11] do you mean to tell me you raised your
[1:44:13] hand and then not sincere enough to
[1:44:14] stand to your feet what good has the
[1:44:16] gospel ever done to you
[1:44:20] oh such playing with church playing with
[1:44:22] god
[1:44:23] the hours soon at hand one of these days
[1:44:26] an atomic bomb will strike around here
[1:44:28] somewhere where these big power plants
[1:44:31] there will not be one split second to
[1:44:33] think it over
[1:44:34] it'll be too late then and maybe before
[1:44:37] next easter or even this easter
[1:44:41] won't you stand now say god be merciful
[1:44:44] to me as sinner
[1:44:45] i accept christ by though
[1:44:48] offering himself as the propitiation for
[1:44:51] my sins and by his grace and his grace
[1:44:54] alone i
[1:44:58] in the presence of god
[1:45:00] will you confess you're wrong he that
[1:45:02] will hide his sins shall not prosper he
[1:45:05] that confesses sin has mercy
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:11] up to you
[1:45:12] he's watching
[1:45:16] now our blessed lord
[1:45:19] in the appropriated number tonight
[1:45:21] stands three penitent souls
[1:45:24] one man and two women
[1:45:28] as i am thanking lord
[1:45:31] of calvary
[1:45:33] when one on one side said lord remember
[1:45:36] me when thou comest into thy kingdom
[1:45:40] the other one said if thou be
[1:45:43] let us see a miracle take us off the
[1:45:46] cross and save yourself
[1:45:48] and the other and said god be merciful
[1:45:50] to me
[1:45:51] and your head swung to its right side
[1:45:54] and said today shalt thou be with me in
[1:45:57] paradise but you were quiet to the other
[1:45:59] one because there was no repentance
[1:46:02] father god i pray that these maybe i'll
[1:46:05] trust that they are the only three in
[1:46:07] the building that feels that they do
[1:46:10] need to confess their wrongs but that
[1:46:12] they have come the all-sufficient way of
[1:46:15] the way of the cross forgive them lord
[1:46:18] and bless them they are standing here
[1:46:20] tonight as you stood for them in
[1:46:22] pilate's judgment hall
[1:46:24] as you stood for them between the
[1:46:26] heavens and earth when the sun went down
[1:46:28] and the moon would not give its light
[1:46:31] and the veil of the temple was rent from
[1:46:33] top to bottom
[1:46:34] i pray god that you'll bless them and
[1:46:38] give them
[1:46:39] of thy mercies and cleanse them with thy
[1:46:42] blood and baptize them by your
[1:46:45] sanctifying power into the body of your
[1:46:48] own son christ jesus
[1:46:51] then they are preserved for our time and
[1:46:53] eternity
[1:46:54] bless the others who feel that they are
[1:46:56] all right that they have already met
[1:46:59] this and did so
[1:47:00] i pray this blessing to them in christ's
[1:47:02] name
[1:47:04] amen god

[1:47:21] past that stage too

[1:47:30] strictly
[1:47:32] the blood of jesus christ

[1:49:37] to receive it to lay our hands on the
[1:49:39] sacrifice

[1:51:55] hopeless say no i'll turn it over to you

[1:56:42] oral roberts university and looked at
[1:56:45] the splendor and the beauty of it all
[1:56:47] and
[1:56:48] it was awed by it and he
[1:56:50] looked at himself he said lord you you
[1:56:52] must have known
[1:56:54] that i could never handle this
[1:56:56] he felt so low and so
[1:56:59] well i just wasn't good enough

[1:57:04] universe and got away you said no
