in life that god will always be with us you know brother i was hearing brother branham and he said that in the tape a certain tape he said that that rock that moses struck when they were in need of water and god told moses to strike the rock and he did he's we know he did it twice they broke he broke the type because that rock was christ and he and the bible says in the new testament it says that that that rock followed them wherever they went and brother bannon said that that rock is christ that wherever we go he'll be there he'll be there when we fail he'll be there when we can't take another step he'll be there always we can draw from that water amen aren't you glad that that is ever present rock amen you know always with us no matter where we go he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you i'll be with you until the end of the age amen god bless you tonight and uh thank you for coming uh you took an effort to come today because of the rain and we had two storms coming in and we didn't expect that but uh we're here praise the lord amen your bibles tonight like to turn to mark chapter 12 verse 30 and 31. i'm getting a little bit of reverb back here bro jeremy could you maybe bring it down a little bit can you all hear me okay everybody can hear me fine okay mark 12 verses 30 and 31. oh he's got it on the screen and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and this is my focus tonight and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these to love god with all we got including our mind now we're going to speak on the mind tonight a little bit my message tonight is the renewing of our mind our mind plays a great part you may be seated god bless you please have a word of prayer father just bless the word tonight lord and take away my nervousness lord and uh help us lord to get out of the way father you might speak to us tonight that we didn't come and gather in vain lord we know that your presence is here father have your way amongst us we pray in jesus name amen our mind plays a great part when it comes to believing the word of god brother ben talks about you know how we when we first meet the lord and that have our first experience with him and it's it's it's pretty much a mental concept conception that we have we have an understanding and and maybe we were walking a certain way and and and we heard the word we heard maybe we went to a church a church somewhere we heard the word and it caused us to make a decision for christ and it turned and we turned in our life and started walking a different path immediately and it it's a mental conception at first because it's it's a decision that we make mentally for the lord very important but we can't stay there we have to go on with you know to a baptism of the holy ghost we know that and also brother bran says something about the correct mental attitude trying to tell you tonight that our mind plays a great part in our walk with god we always give a lot say a lot about the heart and the soul and and that too but it starts with the mind and brother bran says the right mental attitude towards any promise of god will bring it to pass in your in your life so having the right correct correct mental attitude according uh about god's word and his promise in luke chapter 12 verse 21 29 excuse me 29 it says to seek ye not ye what ye shall eat or what you shall drink neither be ye of a doubtful mind so the scriptures they warn us about being doubtful when it comes to the word now brother bam taught us that that uh that there's only one sin that's to disbelieve god's word and and the smoking and the drinking and the and the adultery and everything it comes from disbelieving god's word are the attributes of sin but the real true sin is that we just disbelieve god's word and the bible admonishes us tells us don't be of a doubtful mind when it comes to the things of god we must believe to doubt god's word is to disbelieve his word and to disbelieve god's word is sin in the in the message brother branham preached on the greatest battle ever thought and i and if you haven't heard for a while i would tell you go back and listen to that again and and and be reading it that you're hearing that way you you get a proportion of what he's saying but it's a powerful powerful message because it's all right here it starts right here and it continues the battle that never never ends it will always be in our mind that's the battleground and brother man says this in the greatest battle ever fought on paragraph 41 he says listen you soldiers of the cross when you disbelieve one word one word of god's written bible you're disarmed you're disarmed you surrender he said you jelly fish put on the whole full armor of god amen we're in a battle he says and you have if you haven't noticed when you as you serve the lord you're in a battle we fight it every day what god said is true every man's word a lie that's why the bible tells us to put on the whole armor of god because we're in a battle and and brother brandon says that armor is spiritual it's a spiritual armor that we put on and we need to wear it every day because we need it he says but as soon as you listen to one thing that's his tactic you're disarmed you see we need to know the tactics of the enemy how does he come against you he comes into your mind and i'll tell you why in a minute but you know he's fighting for your mind and he has access to to your mind did you know that now he cannot read your mind brother brown said if you've got something planned and you say you want to fast on a certain day you're getting ready and don't tell nobody because satan will throw everything in your pathway to keep you from doing it as soon as you let it know he'll know and but one thing he can do he can put a thought in your mind and and the thing about that is you know brother brown told brother perry green one time he said he said i can't keep the birds flying over my head but i can sure keep from building the nest on my head and that's what it is he throws a thought in there to see what you'll do with it you could be sitting in church not even just thinking about the thing and also the most evil thought will come into your mind and if you don't know his tactics that'll throw you you think how can i be so evil to think this thought it's not your thought it's not yours it's his and that's what the bible says in the armor we're to have that shield of faith to ward off the wicked darts of the of the enemy that's what it does and and also we have the helmet of salvation which the you know which protects our head and our mind god's trying to protect us from these things and saying can throw that dart in there and you'll think it's your your thought it's not your thought you rebuke that thing and go on with god's thoughts the bible says we are to bring every every thought to the captivity of christ but as soon as you listen to one thing that's his tactic you're disarmed how many things did eve have to listen to one she was disarmed right then what the what what did the devil do swept listen to this swept right in through her mind into her spirit and there she was perverted he came in through her mind and into her spirit is that right he says she was perverted the very minute that she was disarmed when she disbelieved god's word see we we here we see his tactic in acts 17 11 the bible says these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so when they received the word they received it first in their mind they received it and then they began to check on it and read and began to eat of the word and learn more and more as they went but they received it the bible says in readiness of mind there's a lot to our mind more than we think you know there's there's there's a there's what's called the subconscious mind and there is what is called the conscious mind the conscious and the subconscious minds are merely two spheres separate spheres of activity within your brain your conscious mind is the one you're using right now because we're conscious is is the rational or logical mind if i say 2 plus 2 is 5 your conscious mind will catch that because that's not right that's not logical two plus two is four but in your subconscious if you if you say two plus two is five your subconscious receives it doesn't doesn't question it that's what our subconscious mind does it's now your conscious mind is a rational or logical mind whereas your subconscious mind is the animal like brain within humans without any conscious choice on your part your heart keeps pumping blood your body knows to sweat and your temperature is regulated you don't have to stop and think these things better well better hold on brother don't talk to you i got to take a breath no you don't you don't think about it your body just does it automatically because your subconscious mind is in control of all that you don't have to stop and think well i got to make my heart beat no it beats because it's all being controlled by your subconscious subconscious mind now your body knows to sweat your temperatures regularly these are all examples of the functions that although may seem as if they just happen are actually the result of your subconscious mental processes hard at work many people never think they have a subconscious mind although they certainly have to think with it your subconscious mind is very powerful first of all it runs all the organs in your body you don't have to think about it but there's something else about the subconscious mind that we're going to find out tonight now it's very powerful it makes up a great percentage of your mental processes even though you are unaware of it your subconscious mind is easily impressed upon by the thoughts and mental focus of the conscious mind in other words if you tell your subconscious that two plus two is is eight then your subconscious will receive it doesn't question it it just takes it right in your subconscious is that reason it does not try to figure it out it simply reacts to and follows the instructions and guidance of the conscious mind your subconscious can be described as a bed of soil that accepts any kind of seed whether good or bad that's in your subconscious we can feed that subconscious all the filth out there all the things the world everything hollywood has to offer and we and we don't realize that we're taking that in and our subconscious mind doesn't doesn't uh question it and and so and so we have to be careful what we feed into because it becomes a a a bed of soil that our seeds are coming in and the time will come in our life when something tragic happens or something comes up and we need faith right now we need god on the scene and we call upon god and we begin to pull from for what is our subconscious and all we have is a bunch of seeds that shouldn't be there to begin with we've got nothing to pull from negative destructive thoughts oh let me say this your mental thoughts are active they are seeds to your subconscious so everything we you and let's look at our subconscious like like a computer like a hard drive and you're downloading into your hard drive all the time right now as we're as i'm standing here you're watching me maybe somebody will move somebody will cough and you you know the cough you know the person somebody might say something behind you and you know because you know the voice you know who that is you get all this data that's unbelievable is coming in constantly all the time into our mind as you're driving down the road you see this car that car that car behind you a person walking down the street you're catching all those things without even thinking about it you're hearing the radio or someone's talking to you they're sitting next to you you're in a conversation or maybe you get a call and and hopefully you've got hands hands what they call hands off on your on your phone you can receive it but all these all this data is constantly coming in and your mind is always receiving data constantly and sometimes negative destructive thoughts as a result of anxiety or depression continue to work negatively in your subconscious though your conscience has already forgotten about it whatever data you you downloaded into your computer it's still there and that subconscious is receiving it as truth sooner or later they surface listen to this now to take shape as an outer experience that corresponds to their content whatever it is you're downloading whatever it is you're you're feeding on during the day good bad or in whatever your subconscious is receiving it and one thing about seeds they always bring a harvest we feed the wrong things into our mind it'll bring a harvest in our mind as well and in our lives the old saying be careful what you wish for be careful what you're afraid of now brother bran said that be careful what you fear because it'll come upon you those fears that are there they're being fed to the subconscious by your conscious mind in romans chapter 1 verse 27 to 32 it says and likewise also the man leaving the natural use of the women burned in their lust one toward another man with man working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge they didn't want to hear about god you know i find that many times when people they don't want to hear about god we have people in our church that come to visit our church they walk out of there in tears and they say we'll be back and they don't ever come back because there's something holding them back i've got a brother-in-law that he's living with us right now for a few days anyway he came from california he's almost 60 years old all his life has been about the streets the drug scene he's had such close calls to his life numerous it's a miracle he's alive today but his life i try to speak to him on the things the lord and he and he won't even let me talk because he knows more than i do about anything even about god and he he came to our church last sunday and i think that's probably the first time he ever darkened the door of a church other than a catholic church where you don't learn anything but at least in a church like this you'll learn something you're gonna if you come in with the right mind you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna get the word and and so i think it was the first time here at dawkins a real church i mean the church of god and and i was thinking about that you know you know all his life his hard drive he's got all these seeds of just that kind of a life you know just drugs and and cursing and and drinking and adultery and people that's all they feed themselves on that's all they eat all day and their mind is is that's what they're full of if we have problems and we're trying to we're trying to read the bible we're trying to we're going to church we're hearing the word and and we try to stay away from the things of the world but but even then sometimes we hear the wrong things or we see the wrong things and then we have to deal with it brother i remember brother green say be careful of those uh pictures those magazines or whatever they got you know he says you see that to get it out of your mind remember we're going to talk about that you you get that thing out of your mind you can have a trouble but yet people will feed on stuff like that constantly constantly feeding on that no wonder they can't walk they're having trouble with their walk with god we have to be so careful what we feed our minds and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind what is a reprobate mind god just gave him over in other words he'd give up with him and he and he gave him more to a reprobate mind as a degenerate mind no good nothing good can come out of it no matter whether their heart and their soul as as as brother branham said that when he came when satan came into eve's mind he went right straight and he perverted her and the people right now they're being perverted they're all the way down to their soul by the things of this world we should always be on guard and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled where their mind in their mind with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy and murder and debate deceit malignity whispers backbiters haters of god men who will jill said put their fists against the heavens because they hate god a hatred of god they hate the name of jesus it offends them everywhere you know there's places now where you can't even name jesus in the in the graduations they don't want to hear the name of jesus you can mention muhammad and muslim and all that all you want but don't mention jesus at one time i don't know about now but the one time the chaplains of the army and the navy were not allowed to when they entered their prayer to say in the name of jesus they don't want to hear that name hateful haters of god despiteful proud boasters adventures of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding no understanding whatsoever of the spiritual things of god covenant breakers without natural affection implacable and unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commits their sins are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them to do them in philippians chapter 2 verse 5 to 8 here paul writes let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god and made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men god condescended down in humility let this mind which was in christ being you to be humble before the lord to love the lord with all that we have and being found in fashion verse 8 he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross let this mind be not the mind of the world but the mind of christ in the spoken word is the original seed paragraph 178 brother bran says now let's go back now and pick it up again come down for something remember what last sunday's service was the gate to the soul you remember now there is a wound there is a womb of the physical there is a womb for the spirit there is a spiritual womb and a physical wound and the mind is the womb of the spirit that's why we should have to we it's imperative we guard our mind it is a wound it is the entryway it is the gate as brother man says here to the soul you open up your mind to the things of of the world you're making it you're making a channel for satan to come in and begin to pollute your mind your subconscious there is a spiritual wound and the physical wound and the mind is the womb of the spirit it is the gateway to your soul that's why the battle greatest bad liberal fought is right here that's why we suit up in the morning with the armor of god put on that spiritual armor because we need it because we come out it's like it's like when when there was a a city was being attacked the soldiers would come out of the city and file out through the gate and they would stand in front of the city walls to meet the enemy guarding that city because if they if they fell that city would be taken and that city today is your soul and the battlefront is right here in your mind and satan is continually trying to break bring something coming in one way or coming in another he doesn't give up he don't he is 24 7. he's always knocking at the door trying to get in in hebrews 4 11 the bible says let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of god is quick and powerful how many believe that means it's alive quick means alive the word of god is alive and powerful and sharper than any two-witch's sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and there's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart what this word it goes deep inside your soul it wants to come in to live in you that word wants to take take control of you that you surrender to that word believe the word amen let that word be downloaded into your hard drive every day it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart not just your thoughts but your intents amen what you intend to do maybe sometime before he becomes a thought and then becomes actions after that but the word of god is a discerner it goes deep inside the believer that's what we want the word of god not just not just coming in one ear going out the other as too many do we need that word to penetrate deep into our heart and to our soul now we have to understand that brother bram taught us that there are three realms that we deal with here there's a body realm the spirit realm and the soul in the body the body is is controlled by five senses as we know this is how we touch the world around us i know that this if i close my eyes i know this pulpit is here because i can feel it because i have a sense of touch to feel it i have a sense of sight i can see you you can see me you can hear me so we have these senses that we touch the world around us with and the spirit in your spirit brother bran says tells us that we have five senses as well and i remember it as my car m-i-c-a-r memory imagination conscious affections and reasoning and that's that's the the senses of the spirit of your spirit and satan will come in and he has access to your body and he has access also to your spirit he can come in and bring a thought a memory of past sin he'll bring something lit and then you got to be careful because imagination will take over on that and before you know your your thoughts are going somewhere it shouldn't be going he can use these things as his tools that's why we stand guard and also in the soul there's only there once one sense and it's called faith or the lack of it either is faith or it's no faith either there's faith or it's empty we need faith amen but now we know that faith is a gift of god you can't go and just say well i want faith no god's got to give it to you it's given to us by grace but it is a gift of god that's why there's some that can never hear the gospel they've got nothing to grasp with there's nothing to respond the faith is already there laying there dormant waiting to hear that word and when that word comes to something on the inside the response to that word that's why many will list hear it and just walk away and say it's a bunch of nonsense but there's got to be faith there there was a time one time when jesus met a man and in in mark 9 23 jesus said unto him if thou cast believe all things are possible to him to believeth and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears he was sincere he said lord i believe help thou my unbelief and i ask you a question can we believe and yet not believe i believe with our conscious mind tonight when you say i believe i believe i believe but what about our subconscious in deep inside of us this man had there was there was a uh uh something was raging within him that was contrary one to another because he was saying i believe yet he's saying help my unbelief you remember brother branham saying many times how that people would come and he'd say i believe i believe i can be healed and brother bran could look into their life and and know that they didn't have the faith to believe yet they said they profess that they believe but there's an unbelief there somewhere we've allowed unbelief to come into that hard drive in in the greatest battle ever five brother brandon says you've got your senses see taste feel smell hear they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the word even how you feel the bible says we're by his stripes we're healed you may not feel it but you don't you don't go by your feelings you go by about what his word said you don't trust your feelings he said they're all right but if you they disagree with the word don't listen to them now imaginations and consciousness and memories reasonings reasonings and affection they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it you blow a flu right quick if your reasoning disagrees with a word get away from it that's right your memory if your imaginations if you're conscious anything disagrees with that that what's on the inside get rid of it it blows the flu he says we need to open up the channels with god and and get those things emptied out or or or cleaned out so we can have a channel with god in the greatest battle or fight he said what's the matter you had to open the channel first you have to open the channel i have to open the channel you say god come over no no we open the channels you've got to get the soldier the holy spirit placed at the battlefront to take god's word he is the word and he stands there and there's nothing going to stop it then every one of the other channels is cleared out like just like the old boiler with the flu stopped up and you put a fire it'll blow the thing up that's what's the matter with so many blowing up christians because they don't get clean they don't clean the channels out we got channels that are clogged up sometimes it might be it might be bitterness or hatred towards somebody or unforgiveness or it might be a hidden sin or if it's anything it could be anything and it clogs up the channel and god can come through we have to open up the channels that's why we have to open them up and maybe it's something we did back in the past we've never gone to make it right and god will hold it against us we never you've got to examine your life search me your god and know my heart within try me your savior amen that we have in our prayer life we have to have a prayer life where we come to god we say lord is there anything in my life and let god speak to you and when it comes to your mind deal with it get it out of your life open up that channel that's why we have so many blown up christians because they don't clean the channels out they go down into the inside you've got to get clean it conscious memory thoughts laying aside everything and coming from the inside out with that unadulterated word of god that it's the truth no matter if ten thousand died on this side today trusting ten thousand died on that side tomorrow trusting that has got nothing to do with me i'm the individual amen i'm the one that's trusting don't be looking out there see what's going on out there just keep your eyes on christ amen it's just you in christ it's not you and all the people you know it's just you and christ it's not you and your husband and chris no it's you and christ not you and daddy and mommy no it's you in christ keep your eyes on him amen i'm the one that's trusting i'm the one that believes it we gotta start putting new seeds into our hard drive believing god the promises of god second corinthians 10 3 one of my favorite uh scriptures for though we walk in the flesh we warn that after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god we've got to believe that that the weapons of our warfare are mighty through it now i found out that prayer is a weapon the word of god is a weapon now i found out that love is a weapon god has placed weapons in our hands so we can fight the battle friends we are that's why we are more than conquerors through him that loved us so but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds amen because some of us may have a strong for satan has got a stronghold on you what is a stronghold he's got a hold of you and he's not going to let go that's what brother brandon said you know get those get that sin out of your life as long as you got sin in your life satan's got a stronghold on you and you wherever you go you're going to drag him with you because he's got a stronghold but the weapons of our warfare are not incarnal carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations that's the senses of the spirit and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god which is the word of god and bringing into captivity every thought there's where the battle is at bring apprehending every thought constantly watching our because as we go through the day what did i say last time i had 50 000 thoughts in a day and her sister is about 150 000. thoughts go through our mind in just one day how many of those thoughts can if we allow them will lead us astray bringing every thought that's why it's a continual never-ending battle but we're promised the victory if we just follow god's prescription if we follow god's commandments and the things he's shown he shows us through the preaching of the word through the ministry and what god shows you at home and as you read the bible is you pray god's leading you the holy spirit is leading you revealing things to you that maybe you didn't know before amen greatest battle ever fought the brotherhood says if one little aorta of god's word was disbelieved caused all this trouble how are we going to get back disbelieving the word you can't do it you got to shut off all the other things conscious memories reasoning all these other things casting down reasonings we don't reason about it all nothing at all we just accept the word upon the basis god said so amen that's what we need to download into a into our our hard drive god said so i believe god it shall be done even as you said trust and obey look up and say i believe i believe god amen began to download those things which which which uh that's why the bible says that our all our thoughts uh i can't think of the scripture comes to my mind right now that that they be a virtue they be if they be of power that you know think of these things i wish i had that scripture i might have here somewhere i i didn't get to the end of this this morning when i preached it but uh at my church but you know this is brother brandon says now i'm going to get ahead of myself here conscious memories reasonings and all these other things casting down reasons we don't reason about it at all that's nothing at all we might just accept the word upon the basis god said so and it sets the stream between you and god did you hear that you you you began to say god said so you began to believe it and it sets a stream between you and god what's it doing is opening up a channel of unbelief maybe unbelief was clogging that channel and you began to say lord i believe you your word is true your word doesn't fail god your word will carry me through your word is powerful your word is mighty your word is alive lord i believe your word amen every channel comes open between you and god then there's the battle brother brown says the very first front line amen you remember how that there was a man named called john ryan who was blind and he came to god or to brother brown excuse me and and and brother branham uh uh prayed for him and so he went on his way and he was still blind and he comes back he comes back to brother brown i don't know if it was a prayer line or outside but he comes back and he and he says brother would you you will you pray for me and brother ben looks at him he says brother i already prayed for you once and the man says yeah but you said you said i was healed and i can't see he said you said you believed and so he said what do i do brother branham he says start confessing your healing and thanking god for your healing what was he what was he telling him to do start putting some new seeds in the hard drive amen and he began to cry out and say praise the lord i'm healed they have some meetings later on and they're having some meetings there in a certain place and he was up on the balcony brother brown says and brother brown would be right in the middle of his sermon and up and he'd just jump up in the balcony and scream at the top of his lungs praise the lord i'm healed i can see praise god and so the the ushers are came to him brother brandon what should we do with him he's disturbing the service should we go down and go up there and and uh and tell him to quiet down and brother bran said no i told him to do that just let you see the grace of the man how many other ministers would say shut that man up but brother god said no i told him to do that he's doing what i told him to do let him do it hey man have a little bit of a a mercy and grace for somebody amen tolerance is the word sometimes we can't tolerate each other god gave us mercy and grace so realizing what god how much god has forgiven us why can't we tolerate and forgive each other amen and hide a multitude of sins because that's what love does love is a weapon and with that weapon we can hide a whole lot of sins amen and love everybody and be filled with love amen so he told him to go ahead and just do that and he wasn't and they say according to the story you know the story he was out there selling papers you on the on the corner somewhere extra extra read all about it and and then he'd scream out you say praise the lord out there on the street i'm healed i can see and so they were making fun of him and you know the story there at the barber he goes and sits down in the barber the barber starts asking well john i heard you you can see down he's still blind and right there in that barber chair he says yes praise god i can see and his eyes came open right there amen that unbelief began to ebb away all the unbelief that was in that he had downloaded how much have we downloaded in our life amen how much how many doubts how much unbelief oh god can't uh maybe god can't maybe this isn't for me maybe this healing is not for me in the greatest battle brother man says we are taught in james 4 7 to resist the devil and he just won't walk away but he will flee resist the devil now he says how do you resist the devil isn't that a good question how do you resist him the same way our chief captain told us to do it take the word of god that's how you resist the devil by the word of god the chief captain told us just how to do it we don't realize as brother man says a weapon god has placed in our hands the word of god is powerful satan knows that and he tries us to get us to disbelieve our weapon he gets us he tries to get us to disbelieve our prayer it's going to get anywhere because every time we kneel down we might be as weak as we can be but when we get on our knees all our hell begins to tremble and shake and he don't like that so he tries and it's still in our mind and into our hard drive now all my prayers don't don't get anywhere you see we've downloaded that into our hard drive it's time to begin to believe the weapons that god has placed in our hands whether it's the word of god whether it's love when love projects it can even control nature we know the testimonies of the bowl and of the hornets it was love they did that it's a power of love amen you take the word of god amen and you resist the devil with the word of god what are we doing then what are we trying to do we need to reprogram our mind to accept without reservation without doubt what god's word says we are reprogramming the hard drive of our life our mind has been programmed listen to doubt to disbelieve to question to be uncertain to wonder is this for me will god really do this for me he's gotten us in that place is this promise for me will god really heal me am i really saved can i really overcome this thing in my life will god fulfill his promise to me or in me amen in ephesians 4 23 and 24 and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness put on the mind of christ amen brother braham gave us an analogy and i'll be closing a few minutes of the little eaglet that's inside the shell and this in darkness you might find yourself right now maybe in a dark place you can't seem to break out of it and this illegal is in this shell and it's it's dark in there but he begins to peck at that he didn't just peck one time too many times we say well by his traps i'm healed and then we wait and nothing happens no no we we keep pecking brother bran said in the greatest battle he says we keep taking that sword and slashing that devil we go in there we're it's a two-edged sword so it comes it cuts coming and going amen so we come in with a sword and we're just cutting this way and cutting that way and cutting this way amen because we're we're fighting the battle by his stripes i am healed amen i can do all things through christ who strengthens me and here is the little eagle that is pecking and pecking his word says his word says i say his words satan hear me his word says abe i believe his word pecking and pecking and pecking god said god said god said amen like john ryan just planting a new seed planting a new sea tomorrow i'll plant it again the next day i'll plant it again i'm going to believe my promise today tomorrow next week next month but i'm gonna it's coming i'm believing it amen that's what the faith of the christian is believing the unseen amen thank you lord like john wright for healing me began to delete all the unbelief all the doubts and all the unbelief that was in his in his subconscious amen confessing confessing the word of god speaking the word of god creating an atmosphere around me with the word charged with the power of the word amen not allowing a negative word to infiltrate me amen guarding my mind continually all the time labor you know it's not given to us on a silver platter god wants us to fight for every inch but you know we're gonna get it just like the israelites got that land they went in there and they fought and they took the land it was their land so we believe amen we believe no matter what we believe i'm going to believe today i'm going to believe tomorrow but what about so-and-so died well that's i'm the individual brother branham says i'm a believer i'm going to accept his word i'm going to believe my promise you begin to doubt your doubts and disbelieve your unbelief if we're gonna have any doubts there's doubt the doubts if we're gonna have any unbelief let's disbelieve the unbelief amen glory to god brother brown says that those early christians wherever they went that word he says the word it was a word in action among the believers back there in the first church age the word has never failed brother branham says in the mouths of believing christians do you believe that tonight the word will never fail in the mouth of a believing christian a confessing christian confessing the word of god believing the word of god no matter who what happened to knows i'm the individual god is dealing with me every case is different i believe god for my promise amen pet pick here's our confession god said god said but the doctrine no no god said amen i don't care what the doctors god said you know finally that little eaglet pecking and pecking a little little hole finally appears in that shell hey man finally you know in all this believing and confessing and believing god for our promise believe it or god for his word is true it will not fail heavens and earth will pass away lord but you said your word will not pass away amen i'm believing that i'm holding on to that finally a little hole appears in that little that shell and and and and and and that he kept he continues to peck and peck and peck at that hole thank you lord for healing me thank you lord for restoring my eyes thank you lord for for healing my back thank you lord for restoring my family thank you lord hallelujah thank you father thank you lord for for your word is true amen i believe your word i don't believe the circumstances i'm not looking at the circumstances i'm looking upon your word and only your word amen and finally that egg begins to crack and everything satan is thrown in your path against it just fall away in second peter 1 19 21 the bible says we have also a more sure word of prophecy the word of god where until you do well that you take heed as unto what a light that shineth in a dark place keep believing that word keep confessing that word amen i believe god i believe god it shall be done even as he said amen in hebrews 3 1 and closing tonight paul writes wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus he is a high priest of our confession we want the high priest the bible says he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen it can be touched by the feeling of our hurts our broken hearts our wounded bodies our wounded minds our wounded spirits he can be touched and he is a high priest of our confession we must confess it we must speak it out all the time don't ever falter in your confession the bible says hold fast to your confession hold fast what does that mean don't let go for anything don't ever let go of your promise if you're looking at a promise right now that you need in your life whatever it might be for the baptism of the holy ghost to a healing to your having your children come back to the lord it doesn't matter what it is there is nothing jesus told that man nothing is impossible if you can't believe but there's seeds in there we need to deal with the lord clean out my mind lord clean out my subconscious father get all those seeds that i've planted over the years of unbelief and negativity lord and let your word reign in my mind lord amen hallelujah the musicians will come tonight i believe god i believe god it shall be done even as you said trust and obey that's our job hey man it's not my job to figure out how god's gonna do it that's not my job my job is to believe that he will do it i'm going to trust him i'm going to obey him and i'm going to trust him i'm going to believe his word for my promise anybody here looking to a promise right now something you need in your life come on i think we're all we're all needy people brother brandon says that the the body of jesus christ is the sickest body he knows of we're full of needs and there's promises for every need that we have there's a title of god for every need we have he is jehovah jireh he provides for us he's jehovah's shema amen jehovah's aquino amen oh he's a lily of the valley he's a bride and morty star amen he's a pharisee of ten thousand he is the almighty glory to god he is the alpha and the omega the beginning of the end glory to god [Music] paul wrote i believe it's in romans he said in closing i promise be not conformed to this world well he goes he says first he says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god amen that you present your bodies a living sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but what be transformed by the renewing of your mind you may know what is that good deceptible and perfect will of god how many want to know that perfect will of god in your life amen be not conformed to this world guard that that city that soul the gateway remember satan wants to get in through the music of the world maybe if i ever have another chance i'll preach and bring a little teaching on the music that i have he tries to come in through that our everywhere we look satan has avenues to get into our home the internet and all the filth is out there right now god help our young people they're going through battles ten times worse than what i thought my children fought now my grandchildren ten times worse keep your children in prayer keep family prayer going in your home you men become leaders in your home you you tell the wife of the show we're going to pray get the bible out and begin to read it and then they're around the in the living room kneel down and lead your family in prayer be leaders of your homes and and take and take a hold of these confessions and believe god i believe god and guard your home i read a book one time a man that likened life in this earth of the christians the families and such like it was back in vietnam during the war they had when they went into the into the jungles they had what they called the point man and the point man carried a shotgun and he had to be watching for any trip wires that would set off a grenade or or a bamboo stick that would come around with tension and just impale you or things that were on the ground your foot would fall through and you'd fall into these stakes that were full of venom and impale your feet he had to be watching all that plus ambushes of the enemy and that's what the the leader in the home and also the leader of the church the leaders watching out for those that are falling behind following behind them looking for every trap that satan sets out there we're living it's like a jungle and the enemy is everywhere we're going through this place but let me tell you we're not in fear for we're trusting hallelujah that he's going to bring us through he that began to work in you shall perform it until the day of jesus christ can you say amen to that this if you stand with me amen oh i believe i believe god yes it shall be done even as he said trust and obey look up and say amen oh i believe god it shall be done even as he said trust and obey look up and say i believe i believe god oh i believe god yes you believe god it shall be it shall be done just trust him amen believe your promise believe his word confess his word amen oh i believe god i believed god i believe i believe oh i believe god i believe god it shall be done even as he says look up and say i believe i believe that scripture that brother robert was referring to brother jeremy is philippians 4 8. you look at your field and you see weeds growing in there and yeah and any seed will grow out of the same rain there's not a specific rain for a good crop in a rainfall it will grow because it is a seed but you go and you root out those things that you don't want you know in in the there right now in in marana we have the cotton fields and they're going through right now because of all the rain we had everything else has grown up around it and they're running around they're taking the tractors and they're plowing down all along the edges and knocking all that down because they don't want that they want the car but philippians 4 8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things amen when you take that and all of us know we can testify boy i got caught up in this and next thing i know that little mo hill became a mountain and you get there later on you look and he goes that little thing gave me that much trouble it was a little thing we just let it grow but paul tells us and why would paul tell us that because he had to go through it himself each one of us this are the things that you help i believe brother branham if you read through his message and say this is how i overcame he would he would share personally this is how think on these things amen appreciate the word of god it's good when somebody comes by who quote unquote doesn't know us not here all the time i mean he does know us brother robert's part of us but i'm just saying he's not here all the time but god gives some something to come down and our way and said hey this is how to deal with some of those things i every once so well on my computer i've got to go through and delete the history because it records everything you did and you go and you say man i've got six weeks of history in here that i haven't cleaned up you press a little button and it goes to working and it's all gone oh lord sometimes get the history out of here all cleaned up and say lord today is a new day i want to go forward with you and trust in you as he was finishing up and he was talking

coming up okay from today lord let me grow this way let me go that way not sitting in remorse and hurt and anguish and negativity of of the mistakes i made but rather saying lord i want to grow from here and go in the right direction and that's how we want to do that amen let's just bow our heads and pray lord we thank you for the reminder of your word lord and what we should realize when a brother comes and ministers that way that's how much you care for us to come back and come down where we are and say son daughter these are things that might be troubling you or just as a reminder just as as a re-encouragement lord to think on these things to change our heart and our direction back lord towards you all of us have come to a time in our lives lord where we've kind of wanted to throw our hands up and despair and say i just can't do it look at my life look at the mess i made but lord you you wore this robe of flesh you you came down and it's hard for us to understand that these thoughts came at you or else how could you be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and you overcame them lord and you've told us this is how you overcome take god's word and apply it to yourself personally lord help us to make that be conscious daily of that lord no matter what the situation is lord as quick as we can say i'm sorry lord help me to go the right way not to hold any grudges not to hold anything let nothing begin to grow and fester with that lord but quickly clean it up and lord i leave those flues open for the channel of christ for the grace of god in our lives
