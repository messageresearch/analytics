some of what i want to say tonight i just take that as the lord's confirmation if you will or or reassurance or prodding or encouragement whatever it is it's positive and i'm so glad it's wonderful to be among my brothers and sisters in christ this evening we're all looking to him as we gather around his word tonight i want to speak to you for a while about blood life soul spirit how they relate a kind of a sunday school lesson so welcome this evening to the adult sunday school class my words will fail you know that what brother lyle says is suspect it's guaranteed that my words will fail but his words can't and that's what we depend on so while we're standing and before we read from the scriptures let's approach the lord together lord jesus it's such a privilege to be here among the blood-washed and blood-bought purchase lord jesus your children lord as we heard this morning lord as as each seed brings forth of its own kind lord jesus we pray that you would help us this evening lord i pray that you'd help lyle johnson to just disappear into the background somewhere and just become a channel that you could speak to our hearts that you could answer questions that you could meet needs lord jesus that's why we're here to meet with you to receive from you and to offer you our worship and our praise we commit this evening in this service in this time that we share together into your hands lord if i misspeak something lord please help those that are listening to hear the intent lord to hear from you we thank you in jesus precious name nephesh that's an unusual word we'll we'll get to that uh i'm going to ask you to remain standing for just a couple of minutes i want to give you a little bit of context for the opening verses that we're going to have it will be from john's gospel account but the context of the reading is that it's the spring of the year passover is approaching it's early in jesus ministry i think jesus said just a day or two before performed a miracle feeding thousands of people from a small lunch basket and he tells us at the beginning of this chapter that these folks were seeking them out because while they hadn't expected a free meal they'd sure like to get more of them so jesus engages in a kind of a lengthy discussion with some of them and we have his discourse on the bread of life as a result but he concludes with some shocking statements so we'll read if i turn this on we'll read from the gospel of john chapter 6 beginning at verse 53 then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you now we know jesus is the only one that can say that other prophets that were just prophets would say thus saith the lord the lord has said but jesus said i say it's the same thing when you know who jesus is he says except you eat the flesh of the son of man he's talking about himself and drink his blood you have no life in you you're the walking dead who so eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i'll raise him up at the last day for my flesh his meat is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells that is he lives and me and i live in him as the living father has sent me and i live by the father so he that eats me he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth this bread shall live forever lord help us to partake of that bread these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in kefarnachum many therefore of his disciples students apprentices followers when they had heard this said that's a hard saying who can hear it in the niv that verse says on hearing it many of his disciples said this is a hard teaching who can accept it and jumping to verse 66 we read from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him i couldn't understand this they'd had enough please be seated these words of jesus were certainly hard for his audience to accept and easy to misunderstand throughout the 1980s and 1990s i i traveled around the planet quite a lot one of the places i went to off the coast of australia here was the nation of papua new guinea and i spent oops you can go ahead and zoom back brother i spent a couple of months on this island here the island of bougainville yeah bougainvilleas grow in bougainville it's the same word one of the people that i worked with on this island was a fellow named blue he came from the big island the big island of papua new guinea about half the languages of the entire planet are spoken on that island it's all sorts of very isolated little villages anyway blue came from there and he was over here working in this mine and he happened to mention that in in this place that he lived that village that they were cannibalistic they ate their enemies and i kind of looked at him and he looked at me tasty so if jesus had been talking to people in blues village they would have said hey we're going to have a barbecue right they would have just been quite quite happy because they would have accepted it at the surface level of what he appeared to be saying instead of what he was actually saying but the jewish inhabitants of judea and galilee and jesus day not so much a very different culture a completely different societal context consider the background and teaching of jesus audience first they were taught that all life came from god we read in genesis the first chapter the fifth day of creation god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so second in genesis 2 we're taught that humans are distinct from other animal life the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul we'll get back to this shortly the third thing that they were taught in their background was that blood's not on the menu we read what he told noah after the flood in genesis 9 noah is told every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb i have given you all things in other words you don't have to be a vegetarian anymore you can go ahead and eat other stuff but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof don't eat that this was well before the call of abraham many centuries later god commanded through moses we read in leviticus 7 moreover you shall eat no manner of blood whether it be a fowl or a beast and any of your dwellings and that doesn't mean it's okay to go to a restaurant and eat it after all this time god was consistent in his insistence on this point and look at the dire punishment if this command's violated whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood even that soul shall be cut off from his people you may recall from the acts of the council in jerusalem when considering the question of whether gentiles had to become practitioners of judaism the conclusion was that they didn't but one of the very few commands they were given a list of four things was from this covenant with noah we read in acts 15 verse 28 and 29 it seemed good to the holy ghost this is the letter that was written and paul and others were then delivering back to the gentile believers it seemed good to the holy ghost who's that and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things that she abstained from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if you keep yourselves you shall do well fair you will so if this is your cultural and religious background you're not from blues village in new guinea how would you have reacted if you heard jesus making a statement like this verily verily i say to you except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you're dead you have no life in you on the surface this seems at best mysterious and at worst contradictory to god's very consistent instructions now the catholic church teaches that at mass the communion wafer and the wine are literally transformed into jesus flesh and blood when partaken by the faithful it's called the doctrine of transubstantiation i attended the lutheran church from age 14 to 16. in the confirmation class there i was taught the same doctrine just because they're teaching it doesn't mean i received it i remember arguing with some staunch lutheran people that this is nonsense i was soundly rebuked for my unbelief i wasn't too good of a lutheran i guess well what's what's going on here several weeks ago heather and i traveled to dallas dallas texas to be with the family of brother alan hokinson brother al attended tucson tabernacle in the 1960s and 70s he'd suddenly passed away he was 94 years old and we were there for the family and for the funeral now alan was part of our group living in israel back in the mid 70s and some of his family are jewish and practice judaism a person that dropped by to pay his respects to the family that weekend knew nothing of judaism he was surprised to find that slaughtering an animal for kosher meat involved draining the blood from the animal one never eats bloody meat much less blood itself like black sausage or something he asked why and the person responding for whom hebrew is her native tongue explained that eating the blood would mean taking on and absorbing in some way the nature of the animal she used the hebrew word nephesh and was searching for the english word i i offered the life is in the blood and she said yeah maybe it was clear she wasn't quite satisfied with that translation it was incomplete well later that evening i reflected on that conversation and recalled the word nephesh being tied in with the story of noah's ark and so forth and something clicked it became even clearer to me why we talk about the blood of jesus why he said you must eat my body and drink my blood and i want to share that with you tonight let's consider this hebrew word nephesh now this isn't intended to be a word study and it's not intended to be an intellectual exercise but rather a belief exploration exploration of the culture reflected in this biblical hebrew word and how it relates to us as christians we know that this is a sunday school lesson right we know that language reflects and helps shape and perpetuate various human cultures that's why there isn't a simple word for word translation that allows for an accurate exchange of ideas across languages even word order grammar varies even between languages of similar culture in english i might say oh the mountain's tall if i were a french person and it would translate it back to english i might say tall the mountain is in hebrew transliteration one might say the mountain the big it's not a one for one mapping finally most words have multiple definitions causing us to rely on the context to understand the intent or the meaning word meanings change over time if you read the king james bible and have a conversation with your friend we're told they're both english right if you've ever seen the book the the emphatic diaglot which is a transliteration of greek and english for the new testament it's strange to read some of that because the the grammar is just so different and the language is primitive right well the first meaning that we run across for nephesh as you might expect is in the first chapter of genesis and for those of you that pay attention to this sort of stuff this is strong's hebrew word 53 15. don't don't get too deep into strong stuff because it's a dictionary just keep in mind it's not a commentary it's a dictionary okay nephesh a creature one which has breath that's translated into english's creature in genesis 1 24 god said let the earth bring forth the living creature bring forth the living nephesh after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so i've highlighted in yellow where the hebrew word is translated into english to illustrate some of these meanings of nephesh this will all come together in a little bit so don't fall asleep on me if you do don't snore a second meaning is sometimes translated life like the life is in the blood in genesis 9 4 but flesh with the life the nephesh thereof which is the blood thereof there's a linkage being established you shall not eat now it's not about platelets it's not about hemoglobin it's not about bone marrow advanced physiology the most common hebrew word translated is life is the word caim but here we see there's another dimension because god's not just talking about life but he's linking it with something else he's linking it with the blood to life the word nephesh is never translated as blood but there's this linkage understand that we understand that the first five books the pentateuch the the torah uh genesis exodus leviticus number deuteronomy written by moses jesus told us that and as we've looked into recent archaeological discoveries we found that in fact the technology and an alphabet actually existed just in time for moses to have actually done that but therefore the illustrations the words that are being used are a reflection of the culture and the time of the exodus well let's look at another meaning which helps establish this linkage of blood and life and this nephesh we'll go back to the creation narratives and again back to genesis 2. it's translated as soul as in man became a living soul genesis 2 7 the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground this is the body of adam right and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul a living nephesh so here we see a created being which has breath but unlike previous creatures man's breath came directly from god you can imagine cpr or resuscitation right and what happens this isn't just a blast of atmospheric wind keep in mind the connection between life soul breath wind they'll all connect together soon thinking about the word soul here's something brother branham said and you must be born again from 1961 if you're born of god this is your father he's the word the word no matter how many sensations you have still a child of satan until you become dead to the world and alive in christ listen quickly and i was sold good or bad death doesn't change it i had a lot of scripture wrote down here on this one i wanted to comment on what a soul is what is a soul it's you you're a soul the part inside of you when you die whatever shape that soul is in that's the way it goes it goes to its destination you couldn't pull it up no matter how much you do for it that's so got to be changed here got to be born again i say what about the holy ghost brother branham the holy ghost baptizes you into the body for service but you believe unto eternal life he that heareth my words and believe without him that sent me has eternal life see then you're baptized by the holy spirit into the body for manifestations of the gifts and so forth but you believe to eternal life he that believeth has eternal life when you believe it's when you're dead and are born regenerated a new creature all right so we recognize that our physical body is that of a mammal a kind of an animal right but our true self our inner man our soul is unique among all other earthly creatures well how's that you might ask what made adam so different i'm glad you asked that let's go back to genesis 2. the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul it was only to adam while eve was still part of him that god breathed the breath of life other creatures as we read in genesis 1 24 had life breath but that's just air oxygen and biological biochemistry processes only with adam did god directly intervene in this way if we go back to god's covenant with noah we see how serious god placed the linkage of blood and god breathed soul life this nephesh genesis 9 surely your blood of your lives nephesh will i require at the hand of every beast i will acquire it at the hand of man at the hand of every man's brother i will require the life of man who so sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man the niv might be a little clearer let me read it from the niv and for your life flood i will surely demand an accounting i will demand an accounting from every animal and from each human being to i'll demand an accounting for the life of another human being who ever sheds human blood by humans shall their blood be shed for in the image of god has god made mankind and again we're talking about the spiritual in other words if a man or an animal kills a human that man or animal must be put to death we know our physical body is not in the image of god it's our soul our spirit man which is again no other creature has this distinction none god's not talking about biology that's why it's okay to kill and eat an animal that has life breath but not god breath as i mentioned earlier other hebrew words are translated as life the most common being haim just because the word life appears in your english bible or veda in your spanish bible it doesn't necessarily mean it was nephesh in the hebrew text it was god's breath imparted to adam that brought this breath of nephesh life where else do we see this sort of thing is it only in genesis let's jump to the end of john's gospel it's after jesus resurrection that same day that evening the most important day i think that ever happened the resurrection the proof being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and jesus said unto them peace be unto you shalom and when jesus had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord and jesus said to them again shalom peace be unto you as my father has sent me so i'm sending you and when he had said this jesus breathed on them and said to them receive ye the holy ghost did they receive the holy spirit then or was that a promise yet to be fulfilled jesus didn't breathe into them he wasn't performing cpr but his breath god's breath is intimately associated with the holy spirit as we'll see in a moment in fact let's let's see it now let's go to acts chapter one starting at verse four and being assembled together with him jesus commanded the disciples that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith thee you have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy ghost not sprinkled if you're at all familiar with judaism and the ritual bath the mikvah if you're not asked by brethren old he cleaned mikvahs for a while when we lived in israel a mikvah experience is a total immersion you shall be baptized with the holy ghost you'll be immersed in the holy spirit not many days hence when they were therefore come together the disciples asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel is it now is it now oh can't wait what did jesus say no it's not for you to know the times or even the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but they said don't worry about that don't concern yourselves with it instead of fretting over that he said you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you should be witnesses unto me in jerusalem judea samaria to the uttermost part of the earth and when jesus had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up the cloud received him out of their sight so it's clear when he was with the disciples and breathed on them and told them to receive the holy spirit it was a promise to be fulfilled at a later time at his ascension it was still in the future consider if if i offer you a gift i'm not really going to give you this but if i offer you a gift that's not enough that's not enough right it's not a gift if i offer it to you unless you reach out and receive it then it's a gift it takes two there's two parts to this it's not well god will give me the holy ghost you have to want to receive it you have to reach out and grab a hold of it no matter how much he wants to give it to you it's a two-part thing when god breathed into adam's nostrils adam had to eventually inhale that breath it's two parts it's cooperative well did did they have to wait long let's go to the next chapter of acts and when the day of pentecost was fully come we talked about this earlier this year the disciples that many more than just the 12 we know that we're all with one accord in one place is that us tonight we're in one place are we all truly in one accord well what happened when they were in one place and one accord suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a mushy rushing mighty wind they became wind blown trees brother peter and it filled all the house where they were sitting the new testament was written in greek and aramaic not hebrew but this particular word for wind the greek word is nue it's uh strong's g4157 for those of you that are interested that's it's derivation it's root is a respiration a breeze breath or wind but it's linked to hebrew words linked back to the septuagint which is the greek translation of the old testament and then back to the hebrew that it was translated from and it's tied to nephesh the word we've been talking about it's tied to a couple of other words neshama that's the breath of god that adam received it also means divine inspiration scripture is neshama inspired by god divine inspiration god breathed is how the niv talks about the scripture and it's also the hebrew word ruach which is just atmospheric wind just just wind so we understand just from this one word we can understand there was a sound of atmospheric wind but it was really the breath of life from god giving soul life nephesh to the body of christ in the form of obedient believers who were full of faith and trusting in his word all of that from nue the greek word translated as wind is that us tonight are we together and individually part of that body have we received the life breath of god yeah but wait there's more what happened next there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance to speak requires breath we'll get to that in a little bit god breathed the breath of life into those who were obedient gathered in jerusalem while awaiting the fulfillment of the promise well i guess i'm going to go to another greek word here for just a moment ghost or spirit it's pneuma it comes from the same word the same root and it's tied into the same hebrew words that we've talked about but one of the words well there's two that are very interesting but i won't bore you with both of them i'll just bore you with one of them that means to inhale eagerly to snuff up to swallow to devour think again like cpr this wind came but those that were there the breath of god they took it in they inhaled it they wanted it they took it they accepted it they received it it means to suddenly and quickly inhale deeply i think peter and lydia can talk about something that happened just about a month ago where a little tiny human being took its first breath and i don't think it went i i think it was a little more dramatic than that and we're talking about new birth as we saw earlier there's a close tie with nephesh life blood breath air spirit ghost wind we saw the jewish belief cultural and religious that the nature of the life is tied with the blood the reason kosher animal slaughter ensures there's no remaining blood in the meat that's consumed by human as i mentioned at the conversation i had at the at the well and i don't know what you call it and uh i guess i call it sitting sheva in in uh in judaism where people gather together after person has died and reminisce and so forth and this person asked this question and about kosher and the lady there whose native tongue was hebrew says you take on the nature that's why they don't do it so there's there's there's uh you know you are what you eat well with this background with this context let's go back to our opening verses jesus said to them verily verily i say to you except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you're the walking dead you have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day sounds like a promise to me for my flesh is meat indeed my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwells lives in me and i live in him again we know that jesus was not referring to cannibalism to literally eat his body and drink his blood but his statements were so shocking that his audience thought that's what he meant and argued with them on that basis and jesus took great care to ensure that they would get that impression the disciples asked jesus at times how come you talk to people this way he says if i spoke cleanly they might get it and sometimes i don't really want him to get it right we also know the elements used in communion don't transform to human cells it's symbolic there is no transubstantiation but given the context of jewish culture and the tie-in with the nephesh soul life and blood what's going on is jesus somehow referring to the future christian observation of communion just to be clear the elements the bread and the wine a representation they're a symbol they're not somehow transformed into anything except what they are i'm going to read you several excerpts from things that brother branham said it's not something that i normally do a lot of but tonight it just that's how it came together so there we go and uh and and a message entitled communion from 1963 brother branham's praying is they're going to get ready to serve communion he says lord god creators of heaven and earth author of everlasting life giver of every good gift we thank you for this order that we could do this in remembrance of you as we fellowship as it was in your presence around the communion of god's grace we think within our own hearts that one day we were unworthy and now the blood of jesus christ has cleansed us from that sin and we stand together in heavenly places in christ jesus as the sacredness in the pain and suffering that he did at calvary when this body was broken he's talking about the broken bread that they're using in communion that he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes were healed that's why we taken this broken bread tonight god bless the believers and sanctify this kosher bread to be the representation of the body of jesus christ amen skipping down a few paragraphs he said lord jesus we present you this grape juice wine taken from the blood of the grape to represent the blood of jesus christ may as we receive it father may sickness depart from us may sin desire be taken from us may we live such holy consecrated life after this that men will see the reflection of jesus christ in us that our walk in life would be worthy of the gospel that we believe granted father sanctify this wine now for its intended use in jesus christ's name amen so speaking to his jewish audience as we've read in john jesus was simply but symbolically saying you must have my life in you that's the only life that's eternal that's what he's saying if communion is just symbolic how do we actually partake of that life receive his nature into ourselves so that we can become like him how do we drink his blood and eat his flesh the life of christ the very nature of god through his blood nephesh and breath by acceptance of that blood sacrifice his spiritual dna if you will and being resuscitated by his breath the holy spirit not just him breathing out but as we saw a few minutes ago with the day of pentecost are eagerly inhaling that same breath our role transferring that gift our role is not passive we must die daily to self and enter and strengthen and deepen that relationship taking on his nature more and more it isn't doctrine it isn't what you know it's not knowledge it's the blood the price of redemption to bring us back to god the very place we started you're familiar with the story brother branham told many times about cattle grazing in colorado i'd like to read one of those accounts to you this one was delivered in phoenix arizona in 1960. he says years ago i used to do quite a bit of writing first writing i ever did was up here at phoenix i thought i was a writer like my dad tila bronco piled me up a few times right out here in salt river valley he throwed me into a bunch of cactus out there one day i was in awful shape for a week or two trying to chase a burro down right off 16th street 33 years ago that would have been 1927 he would have been 18 years old i remember over in colorado the hereford association grazes the troublesome river valley and many times when we take the cattle up there have i set with my leg wrapped around the horn of the saddle while the ranger was checking these cattle going through the gate the drift fence gate and there was the turkey track there was the lazy k the diamond t mr grimes the tripod which was mr heverez who i was with mr zwollen the a different ones going through which every man could raise a ton of hay could put a cow on the pasture for the summer but i noticed the ranger never even checked the brands he looked in their ear for the blood tag because nothing could go in that forest except it was a registered hereford and that's the way it's going to be at the big gate someday god don't care what brand you're wearing he's going to look at the blood tag of his own son for it's the blood of jesus christ he won't watch the brand he'll watch the blood not when i see the brand when i see the blood i'll pass over you now we're all very familiar with this story but have you ever noticed that every hereford going into that pasture in addition to the blood tag had a brand they didn't get in because they had a brand but they did have a brand brother branham said god don't care what brand you're wearing but we can sure make a big deal about it sometimes we think of denominations but let's bring it down home it applies equally well to interpretations and factions within our own ranks listen to what he says next satan has blowed his breath of poison i think of the words to that song that's why i was so happy that sang it earlier no chilling wind nor poisonous breath can reach that healthful shore i also think of the coven pandemic i'm glad my brother noel was here i got the the third shot the other day and i was feeling kind of whacked from it and noel came and said so he put his hands on me and prayed and i ran out of excuses in a few minutes but but what happens with coven death is spread by breath poisonous breath breathing in what one who is infected has breathed out and most who are spreading it don't believe they're infected they haven't yet developed symptoms or they ascribe the symptoms to something else oh my reading on satan has blown his breath of poison to speak we breathe out satan's poisonous breath is carrying this message which he's saying all these people don't believe like you oh my it just it ain't what you believe it's who you believe believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved on the lord i think of that song have you been to jesus for the cleansing power are you washed in the blood of the lamb like noel i can't sing either but i'm unwilling to admit it are you fully trusting in his grace this hour who be washed in the blood of the lamb there are so many factions that we allow to divide us to separate us to isolate us we do it to ourselves and what is it satan's poisonous breath they don't believe the same way you do they don't wind up exactly i've i've said this many times i've heard it said that if if god could find 10 10 people to agree fully that the rapture would take place and my response to that has always been where are the other nine we have our brand some churches only play recordings some excommunicate you if you don't do what their pastor says or see the tent vision the way they see it or an airplane or a return ministry or a zillion other things brother branham called it satan's breath of poison saying all these people don't believe like you we need the breath of god that neshama in our lives and in our souls not the breath of satan i think of that song and you know you can sing it with me maybe not the same off-key that i have let it breathe on me let it breathe on me let the breath of god now breathe on me brings us life revival resuscitation nephesh from god's breath giving us that life regardless of our brand they're going to be christians of every stripe in heaven a multitude no man can number according to john in the revelation i've talked about that before the greek number system ends at about 400 million so john was limited to 400 million when he got to 400 million he had to stop right no man could number it was a crowd that was there i recall the story i i heard brother aaron say it many times i think brother green said it too about the guy going to heaven and he's being given a guided tour around there and he goes to this noisy group over here and he says these are the pentecostals and he goes to this group over here says well these are these are the baptists and then they cross over this hill and you say be very quiet be very quiet those are the people that claim to follow brother branham and they think they're the only ones that are here well a final excerpt this time from communion in 1962. he says this will do brother neville lots of good i've seen a presbyterian minister out of the greatest presbyterian college in this nation dancing in the spirit oh my it was really something he received the holy ghost and then he told me he said i got one of your tapes said wasn't very good said it was just kind of jumpy but said i took it right into my college and played it and being the great man of psychology there he kept them all quiet well they got here at once anyhow he said and he said he he said he got to dancing at this in the spirit at his church after he received the holy ghost and they said reverend when are you going to learn a new step and he said when my congregation learns this one i thought that was pretty cute you know presbyterian hierarchy yes said when my congregation learns this one so that's a good thing just like a little baby just knew and yet he's been well you know we'd have to be to be the professor of psychology at the greatest presbyterian college in boston well it's in the united states i i've seen one of mayo's head heart surgeons preach the gospel in the spirit and speak in tongues oh my i seen another specialist which was a seventh day adventist uh he was a specialist of the heart and throat also an old man received the baptism of the holy ghost he received it one night i laid hands on him over in the courts and he received the holy ghost so just so many things our lord did were thankful for and especially seeing at this time our musicians would be kind enough to come at this time and maybe play softly let it breathe on me notice brother branham's not talking about anointed ones at the end time he's not talking about he says that these people received the baptism of the holy spirit that's christ in you not just the anointing of christ on you they had different plans brands but the right blood tag the holy spirit the breath of god the life not because of the brand but because of the blood representing the nephesh you are what you eat what are we eating what life do we want to possess and manifest let's just pray together for a moment lord jesus we're grateful for your word we're grateful for the power of words we're grateful that you created the technology just in time that moses could record these things for us lord and that we could learn from them even now 4 500 years later lord jesus i just pray that what has been said tonight might help some might answer some questions lord above all draw us all closer to yourself and that one great body of jesus christ lord not limited to some small group here or some small group there but your people everywhere and we thank you for each one in jesus precious name amen [Music] let's worship him let's sing let it breathe on me let it breathe on me let it breathe on me let the breath of god now breathe on me let it breathe on me let it breathe on me let the breath of god now breathe on me as we turn the surface over to brother aaron maybe we can sing i know the master of the wind starting with the chorus [Music] we'll get it here [Music] i know the master of the wind i know the maker of the race he can come the storm make the sun shine again i know the master of the wind [Music] i know the master of the wind i know the maker of the rain can calm the storm and make the sun to shine again [Music] [Music] that's the breath of god that's the life of god that's him in you if you'll stand [Music] holy spirit our heart will come in this prayer holy spirit thou art well come in this [Music] thou art well come in this place one more time this place right here holy spirit come in this place holy spirit [Music] a mercy and rain [Music] let's get the verse to death [Music] and lord in thy presence there's healing divine no other power [Music] holy spirit the lord will come in holy spirit [Music] thou art i believe there's another verse to them fill all the hungry and empty restore us oh father revive us again [Music] holy spirit thou art [Music] a mercy [Music] i really like that thought when he breathed they had to take it in or else it just would have been winded in the building but if you take it in when he comes by and says lord i surrender i receive come live in this place come come be the life my life not me but christ in me amen that's sometimes just a simplicity [Music] sometimes words can be confusing and sometimes somebody uses a lot of words to try to explain something but just taking that simple definition of it's the life of christ in you it's he himself dwelling in you amen there was a song and i just know a portion i won't even try to sing but you are the air i breathe i don't know the rest of the words but it just kept coming yes that is true it is him he is our breath he is our hope he is our everything he is our all in all let's just bow our hands lord how how sometimes in our own minds in our own thinking we're doing our best to make sense of it to make to make it understanding so maybe that we could say yes i can believe it that way lord but sometimes we confuse it more if we'll just let you do what you desired when you came to adam and and you had created that body but there was no life in it yet all you could do was breathe into that which you had created and then it received the breath of life and became a living soul let that be to each one that has never had that experience lord of receiving the holy ghost receiving the breath of god in their life may they receive it lord and become a living soul heart something that changes us something that that overcoming power living in us to live a daily life worthy of the gospel we cannot do it by intellect we cannot do it by our own understanding we cannot do it by our own physical strength lord it takes christ in us lord and that's your desire lord help us to eat of your flesh and drink of your blood lord take of your life daily we pray in jesus christ's name amen i appreciated that today thank the lord for that amen god's been good to us he's mindful of us i appreciate that amen are you glad you're part of that family called the saints called the children of god he said you're mine amen brother peter
