he in a tiny little house with his mother and she she's praying for Elijah to come and she's just sitting outside standing outside in the backyard her front yard and you know the story the plane is held down and brother Brown just walking and she's praying for Elijah and she's that she's that woman just praying for Elijah she identifies with him and brother Branham tells his whole story and I

the [Music] blender the worshipers that the sons and the daughters [Music] and during my [Music] such a desire this morning even in my life Lord be glorified my life Lord be glorified be glorified [Music] be glorified today in your church in your [Music] amen if you will let him he will but if you'll fight it it'll be a struggle so we we surrender all this will bring the requests to your attention some praises and then just and so when we have a request for my daughter Sarah she's been struggling quite a bit with the port and the doctors want him do some changes and she's asked the Lord that that a request for all these years as it's gone would just continue the same but one of the doctors told her the other day if it doesn't work they're just going to do what they're going to do to her so it kind of puts us in mind also as to and last night me and my wife were talking about it it's it's more on my wife to help take care of her and all but God gave me a scripture brother Jeremy if he would put up Romans sure give him the right scripture Romans chapter 8 verses 35 to 39 as as we were praying and asking God to take control and not reminding him so much as reminding ourselves God does but this is what I felt and I was reading this to my wife who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril sword then it says as it is written but I think we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter this is part of life as God's children but then Paul says no or nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us so let the worshipers arise and begin to thank him and praise them with that that's that's our part to say yes Lord I believe said for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any creature can separate us from the love of God which has increased Christ Jesus our Lord so I say amen amen to that so we just asked and I'll read the testimony but let's remember sister Cybill Shepherd II for continued health but I'll read you the testimony [Music] brother Robert Chacon says I want to give God the praise and the honor and the glory I had a doctor's appointment on May 15th through the 20s I had blood work done and everything came back fine so thank the Lord for that and then sister Shirley Moore and sister Sarah Connor sister Marilee Carol's that it's from the three sisters first of all we want to praise God that we were able to be back in church amen amen that's good for some of us we've had the opportunity to be here but we've missed you and I'm not going to call all your names out because I might have forgotten some of them already that does it's not hard to do but good to see y'all sister Sarah sister Marilee and sisters myself went to see just sister Gilmore's for a luncheon upon arriving there we found our sister not doing well we thought maybe she had an infection sister Sarah called the paramedics they assessed her and found that she had a fever of 103 point 5 but she was responding to them when she asked the questions they decided they said we would not be able to go and be with her but you call in about one and a half hours and they would be able to tell us more after doing some tests we prayed all would be well with her sister sister Sarah called the air ER after one and a half hours and put the year nurse on speaker phone he then said she tested positive for the kovat virus we looked at each other in disbelief he said we would we would be in in a kovat ward or she would be in a kovat award and we could call so later to see later how she was we joined hands and we prayed we rebuke that spirit The Devil's trying to put on our sister and a notic accept that except that the hospital called sister Sarah with our sister's room number and her nurse's name I call the sister siblings daughter and gave her the room number and the phone number so she could get information hers south from her mother nurse after the daughter called the hospital and spoke with the nurse she called me and said the mother did not have the nurse asked where she got the information she said from the ER nurse the nurse said she had pneumonia I just jumped for joy and praise the Lord God is good God is Almighty God is God amen how many have a testimony of the of the grace of God there is time you see God doesn't stay in church when we leave he goes with us he's in us he said I'll never leave you you have a need you want to raise your hand and say I believe I testify Lord however it is that sinner that that public insane lord have mercy on me and God heard his prayer let's bow our heads Lord we we come to you in that precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ there is no greater name there's not a greater power Lord there's no force no sickness no pain no nothing Lord that can overcome that name that you've chosen Lord it was your choosing to do that and we call upon that name we believe it we rest ourselves in that Lord not in our own works not in our own abilities nothing that we could even offer you Lord that could come could even combat that or come close to it or measure that but we accept it Lord we ask you for every hand that was raised and every heart that was represented in every need Lord whatever it might be Lord you you pour flesh you walked in that man called Jesus so you could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and today Lord we want to first say thank you for being so good to us being so mindful of us watching over us and Lord you said you would never leave us Lord and that we just stand on that touch anyone now whether it's an issue in the mind lord maybe maybe some nervousness and some fears Lord and some anxiousness and things like that Lord you can calm that that sweet peace of God did settle down over every heart and every mind Lord a sickness in the body Lord whatever it might be a pain or hurting Lord whatever it might be Lord we just put it in your hands Lord and we will thank you we will praise you and say it is finished it's well done thank you Lord Jesus Lord we love you for let's give them a hand clap and just say thank you you may be seated for a moment here it's good to have to all of you back here and we've been missing you and and it's good to see you guys the church was looking a little empty sometimes and but we knew even the ministers administered here that could fill the draw wherever you were at home wherever you were and you were calling on the Lord then then you know they would say there was a pool there was a draw and that's the debt shield just saying Lord hey I need you Lord even here at home so it's good to see all of you and brother Matt is gonna share a few things concerning going forward and also I'll leave that to him but like to announce this mr. wonderful where is he stand up brother David it's not brother David's Abraham he's going to be one years old and as as you those folks know here what what the brother David and sister mercy went through and all

house of the Lord amen and I think we are more grateful now than ever before to be in church keep playing if you could Amen sisters amen it's certainly just a privilege to be here amen and and I'm actually here believe it or not there's no there's no green screen Amen I'm not virtually here I'm actually here in person and we have surely appreciated we've appreciated technology I'm glad we have it Amen I'm glad that you imagine if this would have something like this would have happened at a time when we didn't have the the technology we have today where we can stream and then and we can enter in but God has all things that control amen I believe that I believe that that nothing has caught him off-guard he's not surprised by anything amen but everything's on time amen and everything's under control and and I just like to say thank you a mentor the brothers the sisters who have faithfully came here on Sundays on Wednesdays amen and labored and it's been a it's been a lot of work amen and all of us get to just sit back and on her couch and have her coffee and and enjoy but there's been labor there's been effort that's went into it amen a lot of effort is went into it but the Jordan has been working tirelessly amen amongst other brothers to upgrade some stuff and to have a good stream amen and so I just like to say today I thank you amen I'd like to also [Applause] and then thank you also I'd like to say thank you to brother Aaron I don't see him wherever he is today who's just been faithful consistent here carrying the midweek services it's difficult I tell you what to preach to a crowd of just 10 you know and at 10 or 12 or something like that it can be tough you know it can be it can be hard sometimes but I believe the Lord Amen gives us extra measure of grace amen and I know I experienced that I fell asleep by the errand also he testified of the same thing Amen that even in the midst of separation and and being apart and not having everybody hear things not normal Amen yet the Holy Spirit was here amen and that's the most important person amen I'd like to say a few things you can be seated amen rather than have you continue to be standing keep playing for me got to keep it keep the atmosphere moving here I'd like to say just a couple things today concerning what we've done how we're gathered here today separated apart the church looks twice as full so but we do have some wheat we sent out some guidelines and some just some different recommendations and so I want to just to make a couple comments on that and I don't want to further muddy up the water or your understanding but maybe add clarity to just a couple things I just like to say first and foremost that this has been difficult it's been been very difficult time not just for the rest of the world be even for us as believers we're not made to be a part God didn't design us that way but community is as part of the church and we find that in the book of Acts they they gathered in one place and one Accord we know the scripture says that you assemble yourselves more as you see the Day approaching so we know is from a believers perspective it's tough these kind of things are hard to be distance to be separated to be cut off this has been a difficult time it's been it's been difficult but at the same time I trust that it's accomplished something the purpose that God had in his mind in your life because I believe that the entire world has reacted you know in the way they would react and the world is the the economy has had a reaction it's had an effect governments have had a had a reaction and it's an attack the world has reacted in a certain way and I believe God had a purpose for that but oftentimes God does something and it's a there's multiple purposes there's multiple layers of why God does certain things and I believe that what we should be asking is not sinking our being synchronous with the world and the rhythm that the world's moving to but to ask the Lord Lord what does this mean for me what would you have me learn from this what is it sent to do to me and I believe that's what I expressed before any of this began I expressed it to you and expressed it to my family and I and I and I just said Lord ah I want to hear your voice in the middle of this storm I want to see what are you trying to accomplish in me and I want to come out of this time stronger I want to emerge out of this not weaker not more discouraged but encouraged Amen appreciative of each other appreciative of the house of God of a church we're thankful now more than ever before to have a building where we could gather or we can meet we're thankful for each other and for the fellowship and I believe that there's an importance to fellowship there's a there's a there's an importance to that and I don't believe it's Satan who tries to separate us and push somebody off to the side but there's a harmony there's a there's a strength that comes from unity and fellowship one with another but you know before it all began out of sand Lord ah I want to now more than ever before the drop that the movie the the treadmill has been paused has been you know shut down and you're on that treadmill whether you realize it or not before you know Cova 19 you were busy on that treadmill going as fast as you can you know life was just as normal but then suddenly that treadmill stops and and everything pauses and at that time you know I just begin to think in my own mind I know other ministers have Illustrated it pointed to it of the children of Israel and Goshen when the death angel was passing and they quarantined themselves and they had a stay at home order and it wasn't from a president but it was from Jehovah and they stayed at home and they separated themselves at home but you know what they didn't sit in their houses and see and say well you know what was me you know what a horrible situation I'm you know I'm losing this and but the the Bible teaches us that when they went in their homes they they sacrifice the sacrificial lamb they worked the Lord they had communion they broke bread they had unity they were worshiping the Lord no matter where they were and I think if anything we've learned and the devil has learned a lesson that you can separate us you could break us up you can disconnect us close down our churches but the bride is gonna keep marching on she's gonna stay in rhythm and in harmony with the conductor amen and we're gonna continue we will go on as the Apostle Paul says let us press towards that mark of the high calling in Christ move on go on and so it's been difficult what's been difficult also is the this the timing and knowing what to do and when to come back together you know and I could I could miss my entire sermon and and to speak to you all day on this so I got to be careful here on my time but you know I think that it's been difficult because there's been such a sentiment amongst people that all you know they're there they're closing our churches and and we're just bowing down to the government and we're bowing it well this wasn't a this wasn't a persecution 'el this was a this was a a disease that struck the entire world sports arenas closed down I mean airports shut down airlines are going out of business it the whole world shut down this wasn't a specific attack on churches now we know there's been some of that and disconcerting sections of the country and I'm not getting into politics here today so don't meet me after the service and give me a news article snippet from something some governor said I understand I'm fully aware there's been some of that but that was true before Cova night team the world systems the harlot system is is opposed to amend the kingdom of God that's always been true Jesus says the Antichrist is is at work right now that's not just in our day that we know there's a fulfillment of that but that's been through throughout all history so this hasn't been a spiritual persecution and and so we chose to obey you know and to you know to listen to the guidelines that in fact the governor of Arizona very much like the governor of South Carolina much like the president you know has said emphatically that churches are an essential service and I'm thankful for that and and there's been no order ever to shut churches down but recommendations and guidelines it should be no different than if we lost power and the power grid suffered and we couldn't gather because there was no power no air conditioning to me it's it's been no different than that and so we've approached it cautiously and you know I also know there's a side of this where people say well you know that's just a conspiracy and it's a Trump takedown and it's all this and you know I'm not even gonna get into that today I can say this I'm not a I'm not a conspiracist because there's never any answers there's only questions and I'm not I'm not at all saying that there's not truth to a lot of it but at the end of the day a conspiracy theories just lead you to that a theory and it's never there's never any concrete I don't believe God intends us to live that way but I believe we live by faith we're not even part of this world system we're part of another economy this world is not my home the song says I'm just passing through my treasures are laid up beyond the blue and so we don't we you know we're in the world or not of the world but you know I know that there's probably some truth I'll just say this you know on that day Jesus said there would be a day where the hearts of all men's hearts would be made clear you know that statement it'll all come out in the wash back in back in the South we say it will all come out in the hogwash but it does everything eventually comes to pass eventually all the secrets of all men's hearts will be made clear and and on that day I won't be surprised to learn that our government was involved in this or this government was involved this leader did this and there was a secret deal and secret thing and you know but if you're not careful friends let me just admonished you here just for a moment if you're not careful you get so you you ingest so much of that anxiety and fear and and suspicion that's not how God called us to live we live by faith by discernment not suspicion by revelation amen and so enough said on that I'll just say that you know that we can we can go either way with this and I know that I think the majority of a lot of our attitudes has been well you know it's big deal it's blowing over it's out of here and you know and I honestly I think South Carolina and Arizona synchronous and about the same stages and the governors are very similar both conservative and they've approached it really lightly not real they've not had a tight grip but very loose with the laws and you know in different things and we haven't been hit very hard Arizona hasn't been hit very hard but I tell you what it's hit a lot of places really hard and there's no denying that I know we'd like to deny it but there's no denying this disease has has taken the lives of messy believers there's been pastors who have gotten this a former pastor back home his wife 69 years old passed away just last week from coronavirus so we can approach it and say aw big deal it's all just you know it's all just hype and I get it tight I get there's a lot of hype to it but you know I think the attitude we have to be balanced we have to be in the middle of the road not a little ditch on the left not in the ditch on the right but we've got to be balanced in everything that we do and that's what we've tried to do so with our guidelines and our recommendations we've put forth I know that you're not going to agree with all of them and you're not gonna feel the same way that we feel but can I just ask you today to give us a little bit of grace as brothers and then just trying to be led of the Holy Spirit and do as we feel led and I know none of you like being distanced today and I'll also say that you know there's gonna be no there's no police here and we're not gonna police what you do and what you do is your business at your own discretion if you hug or shake hands or whatever no one's know deacons gonna come to you and and SWAT you on the hand you know you do that as you feel it's our recommendation that you don't but that you don't congregate and all those things we've put out as our requests but I just want to make it clear we've said the same thing about those that are 65 years and older and you know the underlying health conditions we'll leave that at your discretion if you want to come and you're here today well then that's at your own choosing and we're gonna evaluate this day by day where we are today may be different than where we are next weekend and so just pray for us that we were letting the Holy Spirit and you know as I said we could you know we could go there's churches who have much higher being much more strict than what we are today you know our churches back home denominational churches aren't open at all they're not open until in August and so we don't know what tomorrow holds but we know who holds tomorrow amen and that's who our confidence is in it's not in a man amen and I believe he's got it all under his control amen and we've not been given the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind and then stand to your feet with me if you have your Bible amen thank you sisters so I've also you know it was quite shocking to me when we came here it was very difficult out of analysis before we once I get into a preaching Darrell won't be able to stop so we it was difficult getting here our flights that we normally take into Tucson were not available they were plus one day every single flight was 24 hours total so you'd have to stay in your connection to go the next day so Phoenix was the only option and typically there's I think four flights from Phoenix from Atlanta and there was that's been limited to one and so I was really praying Lord get me on that plane didn't know for sure what would happen and even warned some of the brothers here about that you know and it was it was shocking to me when I landed in Atlanta the busiest airport in the world and it was a ghost town I was not expecting that at all that businesses were shut down and gates over everything and you know and and we're typically in a concourse there's thousands there was literally just hundreds just a few hundred at any given time made me realize real quick that you know back home and I'm sure here in Tucson it seems like things are this is blowing over and things are getting back to normal but in other parts of the world it's not that way not completely that way so we have to take a very early morning flight out of Phoenix tomorrow I debated on just leaving after the service today and going to Phoenix to get some rest before him amen but I don't want to do that I've asked for the law I was allowed to preach and Minister first tonight so he's gonna be taking this evening sir part of it so we're going to move the service up tonight to 4:00 p.m. so that'll be 4 p.m. for the evening service and get a little less pressure to have to to get back a man I got to be at the airport about 5:00 a.m. I got here at about 10 o'clock last night so if I'm a little fog maybe not myself then you just you just overlook it today hey man I don't think I've forgotten anything if you have your Bible let's turn to the book of second Samuel chapter 11 second Samuel Chapter 11 amen welcome all of our visitors and our my family that's here mayn't good to see everybody in the house of the Lord we have something upon our heart we just we just want to be obedient to and it's not at all what you'd probably stereotypies the sermon for the first service back together I wanted to preach something very different but the Lord had other plans and and I learned a long time ago just to obey and just just to be obedient to the Lord and and so we just have something upon her heart you know the Lord God doesn't do stereotypes you know we stereotype things and we put everything in a box and tradition and it's got to be this way and God just steps out of our box and and he's God he's sovereign amen and he does what he wants to do amen and we just want to be in we want to be in harmony with his plan and so today I'd like to speak to you here in 2nd samuel chapter 11 and a lot of this is going to be very evangelistic is just the way the Lord's woke me up even in the middle of the night and then early this morning about 5 a.m. started just to deal with dill upon the heart and burden me with this and so I just would like you to be sensitive to the voice of the Lord amen today can you do that and then say Lord let me be sensitive to your voice amen and hear what you have to say I'd like to speak to you today on a time of war a time of war second samuel chapter 11 and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when Kings go forth to battle that David sent Joab and his servants with him in all Israel and they destroyed the children of Amon and besieged Rabbah but David tarried still at Jerusalem and it came to pass in evening tide that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the king's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon David said and inquired after the woman and once said is not this Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam the wife of Uriah the Hittite and David sent messengers and took her she came in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her and cleanness and she returned unto her house the woman conceived and sent and told David and said I am with child David sent to Joab saying send me Uriah the Hittite and Joab sent Uriah to David we know how the rest of the story most of us know how it goes David brings him in and David has Uriah murdered and so we'd like to look in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 if you have just turn over there let's read here just for a few verses and we'll have you be seated Cleese yesyes chapter 3 Solomon speaking here I'll just wait for you to find it there Ecclesiastes 3 verse 1 - everything somebody say everything - everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born at a time to die time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted time to kill a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up time to weep time to laugh a time to mourn and the time to dance verse 6 a time to get in a time to lose a time to keep at a time to cast away time to Rend a time to sow a time to keep silence notice this and a time to speak verse 8 time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace let's just bow our heads here together Lord Jesus we father all Lord bow our heads here today looking Lord from the dust to the ground father from whence we came knowing Lord and reminded father of our own human frailty Lord our own human weakness Lord but we stand here today father just seeking something from above Lord longing for something Lord that you would speak God that would inspire us that would rebuke us that would Lord challenge us God your word has the ability to do all of those things Lord so I ask God that you would come Lord we're gonna cover Lord something that's maybe very difficult Lord to read about but it's in your word Lord in your word says that these things were the Word of God has given for repute for reproof or reboot for rebuke Lord that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped Lord and I pray God you would come and speak to us out of your word may Lord the hearts of all of your children that are here under the sound of my voice Lord those that are streaming at home Lord those that will listen to this by way of archived God may your Holy Spirit run to their need we ask we believe and we trust in you now in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated amen this morning Solomon speaks here of at of a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven he tells us in verse 8 that there's a time of war and a time of peace I'm going to quickly cover just some of the ground work for this sermon here and then we'll move to maybe another photo of it and come back to it but I'd like to look here at this time of war and a time of peace you'll find in 2nd Sam scripture that the Bible says it came to pass and follow if you could there with me and your Bible just turn back over to second Samuel 11 and hold your place theirs we're going to read it and then a few times as we speak on this today it says then it came to pass and verse 1 after the year was expired at the time when Kings go forth to battle so we know that this a season now a lot of this is ancient to us and maybe unrelatable to us here today but there was especially in those days there was a season there was a time when you went to war and then there was a time when you stayed at home and that's why Solomon says there's a time of war and there's a time of peace and and a king had to be a discerning man he had to understand the season in which he lived and we know that the Old Testament with the Kings was was a lot about war and it's a lot about battle and there's a lot of stories you can read about victory and their stories you can read about defeat I believe it translates to something greater than a historical account to us today but I believe it speaks to the very fibers of our being as men as women as sons and daughters of God serve it in the army of the Lord that whether you realize it or not we're in a war and you're in a constant battle and there is a war that's happening we know that the Bible and revelation speaks of a war that broke out in heaven and then it comes into the earth and so we know that in other realms and in other dimensions there's a spiritual battle taking place there's always a struggle taking place there's always a struggle happening you could take it into the ethereal into the realm of God and you could even go down into your very daily life you're in a daily struggle you're in a daily battle you're in a daily war people think come serve the Lord and all my battles are over and all my troubles over brother Branham said like the old old sister said to him said that's when my trouble began that's when my war started that's when all of the struggle started because now there's a voice inside of you that wants to do right but there's a flesh that doesn't seem to always line up to that you know I believe that we're living in an age of troubled people to where there's we see a time of trouble like never before there's a-there men's minds are suffering today from a troubled mind and that troubled mind that troubled speaks of a continual or a permanent state of discontentment and I believe that the age that we live in today is so pressured at such a pressurized age and we live in it today we're not exempt from some of that pressure but the world lives in constant pressure it lives in a state of chaos and if you ever study the chaos theory it's amazing how many spiritual types are in just the chaos there if where you have you you you have a sense of peace and a sense of of you know of prosperity middle of that there's chaos on on every side you take the man who invest in the stock market it's a it's a lie it's a it's a constant chaos just up and down and up and down and wins and losses the world is pressured it's it's Restless the age we live in is more Restless than ever before there's no calm there's no time of peace there's no rest for anybody Humanity is in a constant state of worry he's always worried about his future he's always worried about the risks that he's taking him what will he have for his tomorrow and and so he's always constantly in a state of labor trying to to put up so that he can he's always taken care of and he's always under that pressure he's always best that's not unique to just a sinner that's that's how me and you always feel every single day since the days of the fall there has been a pressure there has been a disturbance a restlessness to what they had in Eden man is always fretting about his future and if he's not afraid about his future then he's fretting about his past and what he missed out on him what he didn't do in his circumstances and I'm convinced that now more than ever before and it's you and it's it's very became even more like a neon sign it's emboldened with this pandemic that the world is going through its emboldened now that we live in an age to where there's more troubled minds than ever before more troubled spirits than ever before than any times any time past and you know it's amazing to me to see how troubled a believer can come I can't Ken can become how troubled we can get in our own spirits with fear and be overcome with anxiety and worrying about this and worrying about that and you can see you can see it today that that that there's a constant distress and a constant trouble just give me a moment here I'm deviating from sermon but I just felt the Lord pressing me to go in this direction but so many people are so troubled in their mind and you know for decades and for millennia now the the experts you know you have an expert for everything they never they rarely name the expert that they just say expert know that if you do this and you will who are these there they never they never linked them there's no citation there's always just the experts have said you need to wear a mask and the experts have now said you don't need to wear a mask and you know it's like who's the experts here and and the experts of secular experts of for years have told people they have preached a sermon that prosperity is the answer to all of your problems and just get more you know than what you have and and they asked rockefeller that and they said what how much is enough and he said just a little more than I've got and there there's always just that constant sense you know to to be more increased than you were yesterday and it's always this the this message that's preached that you know prosperity is the answer to all of our problems all of humanity's issues and all of their problems just get a good education and then you go to college and you get a a good job and then you get a nice house and and then you put money in the bank and and and then you become a celebrity and and you go and you become you know worshipped and you get all this fame and you can imagine Oh a person has all that surely they just live in peace and they live in harmony and they've got everything you know if I could just be that guy oh if I could just be that person who seems like they got everything and there's they got more than they've ever been you know than anybody else but yet we find some of those celebrities dead at 21 years old dead at 19 years old to drugs and to alcohol into pills and you say what is it what does it mean brother Matt money's not the answer sometimes prosperity is more of a curse than poverty money's not the answer popularity is not the answer and the answer you know and we can see some of the people who have rose to great Fame and great success yet they still are empty yet they still a restless yet they still no matter how much they gain they're never content with what they have that there's never any peace because there's only peace in Jesus I know that's so simple but I'll say it again there's only peace in Jesus there's really you only know peace when you meet the person the Prince of Peace and that kind of peace means that you may not have anything you may not have no money you may have trouble you may not have the greatest success in your human life but in the midst of all of that calamity and in the middle of all of that trouble there's a deep settled peace down inside of your soul it's an anchor that always holds that's why Jesus says the peace I give not as the world gives but the peace that I give passes your own intellectual understanding if and you can you always have this message you know if everyone can just have a piece of the pie of the American dream and the experts say that all of our crime problems would go away our drug problems would be solved it you know the the the the same theory states that people end up as alcoholics and addicts because they never had any self-worth in their life their poverty deprive them of opportunities they would have been provided with them with a you know a sense of dignity so now we just provide them with you know a decent paying job a good place to live a regular income then you know their lives would just be fine and all their problems would just go away then I just ask you then why isn't the world happy why isn't the whyatt why aren't we at peace why is there war why is there conflict why is there struggles with other nations why is there constantly an issue if money prosperity if all of this American dream is the answer to all of our problems then why are so many people so troubled in their mind today they have everything that they've been told they need to be fulfilled they make good incomes have good vacations they you know they they smoke the nicest cigars and drink the most expensive wine and have all the the greatest pleasures of the world they drive the most expensive cars and and they but but yet those same people have to go to bed two sleeping pills those same people have to wake up in the morning and have a hat you know and and and most of some of the most richest people in the world or some of the most addicted to drugs and alcohol and they sit on the other end of the bottle if that was supposed to manufacture happiness then my brother and my sister why is the world such an unhappy place you here today Jesus gives us a warning he says there shall be signs in the Sun and then the moon and in the Stars and upon the earth distress of Nations with perplexity I read this this morning and I just thought my goodness I don't think I could read a better no matter how eloquent a man could be I could never read a more accurate definition of the day of 2020 perplexity he says in Luke 21 that men's hearts would fail them for fear and and for looking after those things which are coming upon the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and notice he says and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh you know Jesus speaks of these end times and said it would be so frightening people would literally drop from heart failure that their hearts would fail them for fear and I believe we're witnessing some of those things even today were witnessing those things the world chaos the the chaos the bewilderment the confusion of the news that you read every single day don't don't don't be load to sleep by this age my brother my sister the world was dying long before March that the stress of nations were here before Kovan they were here there it wasn't a rosy picture that we all if I can just go back to normal but let me ask you was it really normal before is this what is this what God had in mind this kind of economy oh let me just say this world is not my home just passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue I'm longing like hey bruh ham to see a city whose builder and maker is God whose economy is established by God who has one king and he's on the throne he's the light of all of the world believe I'm going to that place one day and yet Jesus tells us in the middle of all this perplexity in the middle of all this distress he gives us a reassurance in our soul and says see that you be not troubled see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet we know Matthew 24 very well the fact is let me just say this here today and this is where we wanted to come to here's what the real truth is for the believer uh no none of us as a believer no true servant of the Lord no true son or daughter of God is going to be concluded really troubled I mean not to say that you wouldn't have worry in your life but really it's not the potential loss of anything material that troubles us it's not the loss of anything in this life that troubles us but the the real plague of troubles comes in a different realm for a believer comes in a spiritual realm and Paul speaks of what calls to him perplexity and what calls him distress in Romans chapter 7 Paul says it this way says for that which I do allow that which I do allow not that which I don't want to do in my spirit I find myself doing those things that that inner man wants to do I don't find that that I do them Paul says he says it this way for the good that I would do not he says for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do what is what is Paul saying this is the perplexity of the Christian as a desire for righteousness it's a desire for holiness it's a desire to be pleasing to the Holy Spirit yet we look at this carnal nature and it perplexes us can you say Amen Paul saying the very thing that I don't want to do I end up doing but the one thing I would love to do so much in obedience to God I can't seem to figure out how do I accomplish this I believe he was speaking for me I believe he was speaking for you I read those words and I say that's exactly how I feel Paul you felt it then I feel it now I want to be pleasing to the Lord it's not my desire that gets me in trouble it's this carnal nature that that never seems to like the things of God and I've got to struggle I've got to I've got to push I've got a I've got a press to be spiritual I've got to struggle to read my Bible I've got to press to to have a good attitude in the midst of trial but let me say this to you my brother my sister let it be an encouragement the struggle is intentional God made it that way and let me go further the struggle is good for you are you here that struggle that you feel to always you you have that that struggle that inward man struggle that I got I got a press to constantly I find myself cooling off and I find myself you know getting lukewarm on the Lord and I'm not reading my Bible like I used to and oh and I just feel so bad and I just feel so that's so all fun I'm not a good Christian and I'm not what I should be that's how God designed it that struggle that you feel is healthy for you spiritually God made it that way I believer wants to do right they want to live holy want to live pure they they hate the sin that does so easily beset them tempts them disrupts their communion with the Lord yet somehow we find ourselves continually going back to it let me say this to you the bride of Jesus Christ the true family of God are not worried about an economic crash or the world's crisis's they're not worried about that nearly as much as they're fretting in their spirit over their failures in the past week to the Lord I've read much more over my shortcomings than I do about the world economy I've read much more about what I didn't do that I should have done for the Lord last year I'm more stressed about that it's more of a crisis to me right now then what's happening with with this pandemic you know III believe that that even that in your own life you can you can get a besetting sin and maybe something in your life that comes upon you and and and now you're grieved maybe over something that you thought you had the victory over and remember I'm just this is brother Matt the Evangelist today so give me some grace here I may have to take off of the kid gloves here today and just be real honest with you can you appreciate that I believe we could know our true spiritual condition by how troubled we are over the sin in our life I believe we can have a barometer and a good measuring line of how spiritual we really are not how loud you shout or how high you jump but our real spiritual measuring line it can be measured by how for how much worried or how much how much how troubled you are over the failures you see in your life spiritually you could say this that your righteousness can be measured by your unwillingness to accept anything that grieves the Lord Jesus you you find the sin although we've got to turn corners I wish I can continue going in this direction but I just got to turn here and I believe we're going to directing this so it's okay David comes to such a place in his life and the scripture says here that that it's a time of war it's a time of it's a time when Kings go to battle 2nd Samuel chapter 11 it said it come to pass after the year was expired at the time when Kings go forth to battle but David sent job and have servants with him and all Israel may destroy the children amen and besieged Rabbah notice this this this last sentence here but David tarried still at Jerusalem I don't want to get ahead of myself here today but as I read those words I just iiiiii remember when I read this for the first time I just said out loud I said why oh if you would have just went to battle David like you should have been if you wouldn't have stayed in Jerusalem all how much calamity you could have saved your family if you would have just been in sync with the harmony of the Holy Spirit if you would have discerned that this is a time of battle and not a time of peace there was a time when it was okay to be in the castle in Jerusalem but then there was a time when it was detriment to the kingdom for the King to be in Jerusalem and David failed to discern this you can go and read chapter 11 and they're fighting the ammonites and they go in Chapter II led chapter 10 you can read after 10 fighting the ammonites in chapter 9 and they almost conquer them but they don't completely wipe them out they they have a partial victory and chapter 11 should have been about David going back as a king with his troops to finish the job but what we find is something very different in David the Bible says at the time when the season when war is supposed to take place it's not a time of peace it's a time of war David decides to stay home you know there's a there's an amazing thing an amazing principle we should say that you can find the Word of God and believe it's a principle that remains ever true and the principle is this that no matter how much you may try you cannot hide from God there's a principle here in the word of what we're going to look into it just in a moment that no matter how much the facade you build or where you go or what place you go to one of the greatest truths in life that we live by one of the greatest principles and and all of us today someday will learn that lesson whether we've learned it today or not is that there is no escape from God there is no place you can run to where he's not there is no there is no pleasure you can bury yourself in there is no there is no replacement that you can give yourself to satisfy yourself enough to escape from God and like a fugitive we can run from the presence of God but ultimately we can't hide God penetrates the darkness no matter how what you cover up with no matter what cover and you use and let me just say this if you manage to dodge him in your life if you manage to run from him and dodge him your entire existence here on earth you're still gonna stand and be exposed before him one day I'd rather face him now his brother branham said I'd rather face him as anything just not a coward I'd rather face him now and be judged by let my life be judged now by the Word of God than than then because now there's mercy glory it's an amazing principle that David learns it's what the Bible says very simply be assured that your sins will find you out he speaks of something here in weekend we're going to pick it up in the scripture you don't have to turn brothers if you could put it on the screen includes yes these eight verse 11 I want to read some of these because this is Ecclesiastes 8 verse 11 because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily notice follow closely here because sentence the passage of a sentence is not executed speedily against an evil work therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil in other words just because you don't reap what you sow the day after you sew it doesn't mean you're not going to reap what you sow I know it's a very simple principle but this is what Solomon is saying here that just because you plant a seed and you don't see any results from that seed doesn't mean that there's a seed that's gonna you're gonna reap harvest that goes both ways so a good seed start doing the right things in your family for your children for your home for your marriage you may not see the results right away but you'll reap what you sow you sow a seed of discrepancy you you'll reap what you sow numbers chapter 32 verse 23 this is this is an amazing scripture says but if you will not do so behold you have sinned against the Lord and be sure this numbers 32:23 be sure your sin will find you out he what a what a picture he paints here of a of a searching that your sins will literally haunt you they'll follow you and brother Branham said some men's sick for them some men's follow after them you know and any sincere your sins he says your sins will find you like a like a fugitive you're you you may run you may go you may move you may change the dynamics of your life but there always be sure your students will always find you and the wages of sin we know is death it's never worth it you'll pay the price and it's never never worth it it's an amazing thing because he says here in Isaiah 59 let me just read a few more of these Isaiah chapter 59 verse 1 and verse 2 I'm filling pressure from time so uh so just let me not go too fast and we'll stop I'll pull the parachute when uh when I'm when the Lord's ready you okay he says behold the Lord's hand this is Isaiah 59 the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither is his ear heavy that it cannot hear but your iniquities have separated between you and your God and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear Isaiah 29 verse 15 woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord and their works are in the dark and they say who cieth us and who knoweth this job answers that question and we can we know it by memory says for his eyes job says for behold he says his eyes are upon the ways of man and he cioth all his goings he knows your heart of hearts he knows the deed the depth of your conscience he looks beyond the facade or the portrait we give to everybody else and it's amazing because sin has something ends Oh such a but the man he preached at home sin today I am so just bear with me here I believe it's what the Holy Spirit just began to burden upon my heart sin and especially remember brother Brennan says gives us this he says the sinner doesn't sin a sinner is sin a believers who he who sins he says because a believer has the ability to backslide have the ability no backsliding brother branham covers that he says now backsliding doesn't mean you're not saved he said Paul even the Apostle Paul says I died daily so so there's a constantly he says mortify the deeds of your flesh so there's there's constantly a potential to fall from grace what is what does it even mean to backslide the Senate means to miss the mark so secret sin causes us to hide it's an amazing response that you see here in fact I'll say this is an automatic response after sin is to hide you can see that in in Genesis with Adam the very first reaction emotional the very first reaction that a human makes after he sins is he hides the first thing Adam did and God comes down and says Adam Adam we're at the hall I was afraid Lord so I hid myself it's an automatic response and let me just let me go just here for a moment in labor in this it's in that reaction it's in that hiding that Satan tries to create a covering and that covering oftentimes is religion and if we're not careful we pacify our conscience and we pacify our our condemnation with religion and it's just a covering we go to church and we look the part we dressed the part we act the part we talk the part and we we that's exactly where Satan wants to take us to he wants to push you into a closet he wants to push you in the dark he wants to shut the lights off let no let it be concealed just cover it up no one who ever know just just Powell put it put you know put something over top oh but but the Holy Spirit doesn't well God doesn't want you to cover that up God wants to expose it because he knows it's in the exposing in the light to where the devil is defeated in your life you you begin to hide and people have creates they create a religion uh a and then you become a wonderer that's why Cain became he become it became a vagabond a wonderer it's what the scripture says about him there was a very big difference between a very symbolic mark and came and that was that Cain couldn't repent wasn't it was not the act of the murder of murdering his brother follow this here just for a moment that was not the problem God even says if you'll do well you you know God that you won't you be received even God tries to go to Cain and tries to talk to him if murder is what separated the seed of God from the seed of Satan if it was the act if it was the behavior if it was the murder then David would you'd have to say David was a seed of Satan because David murders Uriah you say then brother Matt what's the difference they're both murderers the difference is is that when Cain was confronted with his sin he refused to repent but David when he was confronted had the ability to repent and turn around and go the other way he had something in his heart that wouldn't let him stay in that condition you become a wonderer and and you you you know that's exactly what happens to a person they begin to wonder and this is what this is exactly what Cain turns into is a fugitive a a vagabond that's why the Bible says sin lieth at the door and it shall become thy master you know the statement all too well we quoted it last Sunday sin will take you further than you want to go it'll cost you more than you want to pay and it will keep you longer than you intended to stay you begin to wonder spiritually wonders you know if warts a wonderer brother man it's like a person those who seem to have no spiritual direction and their life they're just aimless just going about pillar to post church to church place the place camp the camp they go in circles you know a wonder or sort of this goes in a circle he searches for old landmarks and old historical boundaries brother Branham preaches that sermon about the spiritual amnesia and he talks about the the the soldier boy that came back from war he gets off the train and he says and he didn't know where he was he said he just had amnesia so shell-shocked from battle forgotten who he was forgotten you know where he lived and and and that amnesia that begins to set in you you go into that cycle of sin you know that that cycle of constant you know what the cycle of sin is where you you you sin and then you repent and you go into the same thing and you repent then you do the same thing then you repent then you do the same thing you repent then you do the same thing say it again brother Matt you repent and you do the same thing it's that cycle there's and there's but there's never a victory it's no overcoming in that but you know the greatest danger in that place is what the Bible refers to as a seared conscience and there's a conscience searing that takes place when you stay in that pattern and you never have victory in your life and there's a searing that can take place to where you become theirs you become apathetic towards spiritual apathy 'he's one of the greatest worst diseases the preacher can diagnose in someone spiritual apathy you know I would rather have a person that's why Jesus says I'd rather you be hot and cold how hot or cold than lukewarm because I would rather take a person who's just completely doesn't want anything to do with with God doesn't want anything to do with Christian living I'd rather have that person than a person who just yeah yeah well I mean yeah big deal I know the word says that I know that yeah mmm just that apathy apathy comes from a conscience that's been seared David is at risk for this and we're gonna move through his life here he's at risk for this and it's amazing because this the sin here with David and Bathsheba it's as you begin to read it speaking of hear it it says that it's a time when Kings go to war look at it they're in second Samuel Chapter eleven I'm gonna try to hurry it's a time when Kings go to war it's springtime springtime my favorite season it is my favorite you know if it was up to me it'd be spring all always springtime you know it's a time when Kings go to war it was important it was important to fight during the right time if you waited until winter then it was too late and it was it was so I know what fought in the winter it was the time of peace because in the winter time there was your men had no no way to eat from the fruit that the ground was bare and everything was cold and and and and so you don't fight in the wintertime you know your men will die in the cold you don't wait until summer especially in Tucson you don't wait until summer that's not the time of war I'm trying to get you to catch something here that that there was a season that that the King had to discern that there was a time when there was a battle to take place and it was important that he didn't fail to discern the season it was important with spring it was a time of life a time when Kings go to war circumstances had arisen in such a way when it was important for you David the King the father the leader the head of the home it was important for you to be at war not in your castle not in your castle David the Bible says he last verse their last sentence but David tarried still at Jerusalem you know I wrote this just as the Lord gave it to me and meant something very personally to me a time when when dads go to war not to stay at home and lose their children but a time to fight a time when leaders go to war to fight for their family to fight you say brother man is it a struggle it's a struggle and you've got to be willing to fight in that struggle to fight for righteousness to fight for godliness to fight for holiness when the world is pushing against it so hard when the systems of the world are pushing against everything godly it's not a time to give up or sit down or give in or compromise it's a season of war my brother my sister you're in a season of battle you're in a season of war this isn't the time to get lukewarm it's not the time to stop reading your Bible it's not the time to to get lackadaisical in the age you live in it's the time to be spiritual it's the time to be zealous for the Lord Jesus it's a time more than ever before to have sincerity to have sincerity and consecration as brother Branham has the vision of the Mumba and Annie says you can bind him remember that the mama that struck the brother in the vision and and then the voice comes to brother Branham and he says you can bind him and he says but you need to be more sincere sincerity is an important thing to the Lord consecration and dedication you say how do I do that brother Matt well how do what does that even look like for the man it's a life that is focused and not distracted it's a it's a determination spiritually that you come to in your life to where you say I no matter what the cost is the song says whatever it takes Lord to draw closer to you that's what I'll be willing to do whatever it costs me it was a time of battle it was a time for a higher calling it was a time for the love of God to abide it was a time for for worship real worship in spirit and in truth it was a time for greater dedication it was a time for a determination to serve the Lord it was it was a time of battle of time to fight a time for spiritual maturity and not spiritual empathy not a time to be at home and let others fight for you David but the king should be on the battlefield there's a season you'll go through in your life you know I'll just stop here and get practical here for a moment there's a season you go through in your life I don't care what stage of life that you're in even as a teenager there's a season in your life to where you you go through a struggle harder than you've ever struggled before and and it comes to as the brother branham said it comes to a time of decision he preached that message this season that you hit in your life to where to leave and you become your Havis you have a maturity and you've got to make a decision you know it's it's it's it's a true statistic that you know though even if I'm a statistic from a Christian point of view that those that are going to make a decision to serve the Lord do it before the age of 18 and they say that beyond the age of 18 19 you get over that age it's it there there becomes a hardening of the heart can I get anybody to witness that here today there becomes a hardening that happens in your heart and that tenderness that you have at that young age oh that's why more than ever before it's it's the duties the duty the the the the onus is on us as parents to tell our children about Jesus to form their their their understanding in their mind through the examples not through the serve not through the the do's and the don'ts not through the stunts to the code of legalism that listen that that that's never going to save your children they've got to see a life that lives behind and real true living color they've got to see a real example you say brother Matt do they need to see our dad who's perfect absolutely not see a mother who never makes mistakes I don't that'll destroy them worse but they've got to see a man who's a real man who can make mistakes but he can repent for his mistakes they've got to see a desire to sincerity that this home we want it to be a spiritual home we want to have a spiritual house we want an atmosphere where the Lord is pleased to dwell you go through that struggle in your life somewhere in your years and you've got to make a decision and it's harder to make that decision later in your life let me just give you the words of the Apostle Paul today is the day of salvation you don't have a promise of tomorrow you go through a season in your marriage maybe a struggle a time a hard time and none of us are exempt from that because this is how God intended it to be growth only comes their struggle growth only comes through trouble you know we wish it would be springtime all the time I wish it would be I wish it was always that time of year you know my wife loves winter she wish it would just be cold Oh year long and just to have a fireplace going all year long we I'm just I'm not that way at all I can't relate I can't wait for the cold season to be over and some people like the summer I don't know why but some people like the summer they love it just to be Hana you know I like I like in the summer as long as I have air conditioning and a good one a good air conditioning system but we would want it to be summer or maybe winter or maybe spring oho you know but God didn't intend and God doesn't grow anything by one season but everything that's gonna have to grow go through a winter it's gonna have to go through a struggle it's gonna have a spring time where there's life and there's peace it's gonna have to go through an order it's gonna have to go through a full you've got to learn to say Lord no matter what season of life I find myself in I'm gonna worship you the same I'm gonna serve you the same I'm going to press the city no matter what you're trying to do in my life it doesn't matter what you're trying to bring forth whether it's sorrow whether it's a hard time a good time a time of peace a time of war let me learn to serve you no matter what season I find myself in this was important for David to understand that it was a time to stay on the battlefield it wasn't a time to stay home and it sent home that castle that he stays in let me just say this to you here today he didn't stay home to write songs some people I just I'm you know I'm gonna stay home at church stay home from church I'm just gonna become more spiritual I'm gonna pray I thought why are you staying home he didn't stay home to meditate on the law of Moses he didn't stay home to you know to write another summer or to eat he stayed home for what by all purposes of second Samuel 811 his purpose was to stay home was to stay in bed to be lazy that's exactly what the scripture says he's not raised it up in the morning he wakes up in the evening what a cycle he gets on he's sleeping in are you with me here today hope that's okay yeah he he'd he'd he stays home it's he stays in in the midst I want you to catch this and the time of war and the season when he should be spiritual in the season when his children need him the most and his children when his family needs him the most in a season when God needs him the most when he should have went back and finished the ammonites off instead of finishing the job he stays home he stays in bed he stays and the Bible says that he wakes up and and he and we know the story everything falls apart after that he doesn't he gets up in the middle of the night and he's walking around his rooftop and sees this woman and and you know and then and then her the man because he's an as you slurred in school he's in the wrong place at the wrong time doing the wrong thing and all you teenagers said Amen doing the wrong thing and you know this is this cycle starts in his life because he's out of sync with the Holy Spirit when you become out of sync and out of harmony with the Holy Spirit in your life you can expect calamity and find homes you expect calamity and your teenagers expect calamity and your job expect calamity in your marriage you fall out of sync and out of harmony with the word he stays there and the Bible says that we know the story let me just say this to you here today prosperity can sometimes be dangerous you know it's as we said it's sometimes more dangerous than poverty and adversity and we don't like adversities we do everything possible to stay away from adversity to stay away from trouble to stay away from calamity no one goes looking for it no one goes searching for it no one's asking for more of it you don't pray and say God let me suffer greater let me let me suffer more you know no one prays that we do everything we can to avoid it to avoid adversity you know he and this was no doubt where David was in his life he comes to a place in his life and I want you to pause the David in the castle here for a moment and let's rewind the tape just for a moment let's go back to 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 years David's a young man younger and he's he's in a cave with just some men and this is a very different season in his life he's not a king at this point he's he's not doesn't have a castle as I have a throne that prosperity he's just a shepherd boy with an anointing on his life and a promise from a prophet and he takes what he's got and the Bible says that he's running he's he's in a cave now I want to ask you a question maybe I've asked this here before I'll just ask it again which David would you choose I want to give you two versions of David you have David in the castle now let let me tell you something let me tell you about this David David in the cave this David ten years before in the cave is running for his life from a man named Sol who's tried on multiple occasions to take his life he's living in constant stress he's living in constant worry he's living in constant anxiety you know he's sleeping with one eye open he's always looking over his shoulder and you know it's all gonna try to kill me he can't he flees from Sol the Bible says he runs from him and he's he's living not in that tent not in a house he's living in a cave he's taking his baths in creeks the fairy few baths that he's able to get he's he's surrounded by pressure he's surrounded by stress he's surrounded by adversity he's surrounded by worry he's constantly worried he's constantly just under this constant struggle in his life now take that David let me give you another David fast forward ten years he's in a castle he's got money in the bank all the money he'd ever need he's got servants he's got maid servants he's laying in a hammock you know and he's got his servant sir waving him with palm branches keeping the Flies away he brings in one of his singers and they begin to sing to David oh how great is David how mighty is David he's kicked back arms behind his head kicks back no rat no worry he's got no struggle he's the king of the world he got no he got enough salt chasing him no worry no stress man got it all no trouble not worried about anything just got it made in the shade which David would you choose about us ask yourself that question which David would I choose see here David will struggle David with worry stress you say it anxiety for the Matt yeah not many you know rare rare occasions he could take a bath yeah a lot of trouble yeah yeah a lot of stress yeah and that David in the castle he's no no you no no no seemingly no problems at all you know most of us would take that David but let me let me let me reveal something to you about the David with adversity versus the David with no stress the David in the castle was the most vile corrupted cold backslidden David you can read about and the David in the cave was the David that you opened your Bible to the Book of Psalms and you begin to read Psalms because those Psalms that you loved and all my favorite Psalms Psalms 119 Psalms 27 Psalm 63 those Psalms were not written in the castle with no adversity and no trouble and no pain in his life those Psalms were born out of the David and the cave the David who struggled the David who had stress that David who had worried that David who Eng had anxiety but it was in that crushing and under that pressure that inspiration comes flowing freely from David you will never find a more spiritual in sync in harmony with the Holy Spirit David than the David who had trouble adversity and pain in his life we questioned so many times the trouble in our own life God why does it got to be this way as I said at the beginning I'll say it again the struggle is good for you how many Psalms do you think David and it's palatial bed and and and and and Palace with with everything around him none zero numero Saito he didn't write anything he he he's living has everything but he's no meditation of the there's there's there's you know there's nothing there's there's no meditation that takes place and David when he was interred in Jerusalem instead of being on the battlefield you know I don't believe for one minute we're to pray and say God just make my life trouble and just give me as much worry as you can no none of us need to pray that but on the other hand we should recognize that success is often a greater test than adversity and often times when it appears that everything's going my way we are in the greatest danger in our life that's why the Bible says I think it's in the book of James let no man say when he is tempted that he is tempted of God for God doesn't tempt any man he says but each one is tempted when he is carried away picked up and carried away and enticed by his own lusts and when lust has conceived it gives birth it brings forth it reaps sin and when sin is finished it brings forth death and sin doesn't stay it's not static it's dynamic it snowballs it gets greater it gets larger it gets bigger what sin starts his murder and starts as adultery turns into a murder and then a murder turns into a cover-up and a cover-up turns into a lie and it's all a big facade look just look at the progression that this takes place in his life it starts out as a very private only Joab and David knows about it it ends with the whole world finding out about it concealment trying to conceal now notice this here can I have just a few more minutes I know we're almost 12 o'clock and now you're hungry but just give me just a minute David's sin notice what proverbs this is a scripture you probably know very well power 28:13 says he who conceals his transgression shall not prosper but he who confesses and forsakes them will find compassion out of sin he says when I kept silent my body wasted away through my groaning all the day long he says in verse 4 for day and night your hand was heavy upon me my vitality is drained away as with the fever heat of summers with the fever and the heat of summer what is David saying that it was in that time when he tries to cover this whole thing up and just no one will know and I'm just gonna get away with it I'm just gonna keep going I don't need to tell anybody I could use prick keep pressing through it it says it's all gonna work itself out I got this all figured out you know I can figure all this out I'll I'll put out all the fires where everything will be fine yet when he lays his head on his pillow at night and he's it's just him the pillow and the ceiling David knows who he is and you know you know you you can you can be anybody at church you could be anybody in front of your family your parents your husband your wife but when it's you and the pillow and the ceiling and God you know you know you know what manner of person you are david says this in Psalms 119 and I want to I want to show you this just here you don't need to turn here as it begins to struggle with this just he begins to come to this place to where he says that he becomes miserable Satan will convince you that sin to Springs pleasure its pleasure for a season but after that it's misery and David's plagued with the guilt he can't sleep he can't eat he's he's not sleeping he's not he's losing weight and you know it seems like such a horrible time now whether David realizes it and realizes it or not the suffering that is going through is the tender loving hand of Jehovah it's God beginning to soften his heart and it's it's God it were it's God's greatest gift of Mercy that God begins to tenderize his heart they begin to tenderize his spirit David says this in Psalms 119 by the Jeremy if you could put it up somes 119 in verse 59 this is such a key note verse here for me and maybe we could just we could Center and on it here before we close he says I thought on my ways I thought on my ways you imagine is he suffering through all of that and he's laying his head on his pillow at 90 this verse I thought on my ways but the Brandon preaches a sermon as I thought on my ways and he picks up this verse here David begins to think on his ways and it begins to think of all of the calamity in his life and everything that he had done brother Bentham says and I don't have it for the screen you can keep that up prophet of God says here and he says David after he had did wrong and took your eye of the Hittites wife the lovely Bathsheba and was gonna be the father of her child and caused her gallant husband to be killed in battle when the prophet Nathan come in and revealed his sins to him then David thought on his ways and he turned himself to repentance and sackcloth and ashes and listen to what he says here he says that's the way to turn God heard him God will always hear a man or a woman that'll turn their feet to his testimony God will always hear a man or a woman that'll turn not their confession not their mouth not how you come up here and cry at the altar but when you turn your feet to his testimony brother Adam says that gets God's attention and he says oh he says it should it should bring us to repentance in cycle office and confession what the church needs tonight is a confession making right to come back to the testimony of the Lord there's mercy there's forgiveness seems like it would haunt people going on know that you're walking hour by hour in the face of death why do we continue in selfishness greed and ungodliness and our eyes on the things of the world it's time we turn back to God's testimonies as I thought on my ways I turned my feet to thy testimonies God tenderizes the heart of David and and and it prepares him for this moment when God is going to bring this prophet Nathan in his life second Samuel Chapter twelve turn there in your Bible and we'll just read this here I promise I'm closing this is going to be God's greatest gift of mercy was sending him a prophet that would expose his sin Nathan confronts David and says notice what he says here in 2nd Samuel chapter 12 the Lord sent Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto Him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing saved one little ewe lamb which he had bought a nourished and grew up together with him with his children to eat of his meat drink of his own cup lay in his bosom what son to him as a daughter there came a traveller into the rich man and spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the Wayfarer and man that was come unto Him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him he's painting the picture of a marriage he's painting the picture of Uriah Bathsheba David do you realize what you've destroyed do you realize in your arrogance and in your pride you realize what you've done David at this point it's covered up no one knows just at least he thought Joab David but now Nathan gives him this story notice here he says here in verse in verse five and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that has done this thing shall surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity remember when Jesus says that for with what measure you mete it shall be meted unto you and you judge we're so quickly to judge a situation it's amazing to me how people can judge other people in a situation that you've never went through yourself it's amazing how is the family of God we can become so judgmental I've watched I've watched I shouldn't go this way but I will I've watched I've watched young married couples who criticize other couples who you believe all that mess I'm just going on you just wait that little little two-year-old right there this is this let them grow up a little bit watched how many times they've had to eat their words many times much worse than the people they were criticizing you know it and as the Prophet says it ought not to be that way or so fast the judge or the only army that you know berries are are sick and wounded David immediately lashes out he shall restore the lamb fourfold David did you realize when you spoke those words you were gonna lose four little lambs four children are gonna die your children did you realize when you were speaking those words David you were pronouncing judgment on your own life Nathan said to David thou art the man thus saith the Lord God of Israel I had nobody the king over Israel deliver to the end the hand of this Liberty out of the hand of Saul gave thee thy masters house thy masters wife to that bosom gave him the house of Israel and Judah that had been too little I would have noticed this moreover given the such and such things I would have given you anything verse 9 wherefore has thou despised the commandment of the Lord to do evil in the sight that was killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword of his taken his body ain't healing with the sword of the children of ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou has despised me that was taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife thus saith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against the out of thy own house would take that wives before this notice here's this judgment he's going to pass upon him listen to what brother Branham says here prophet of God speaking when the message of grace love this message here in the message of grace brother Branham says when David did that evil thing his own judgment should have killed him when that profit came up there he thought it was hid this old profit old bald-headed fella stomped in Oh Nathan out of the wilderness sat down said David what's how's everything going said fine oh oh prophet of God live forever hallelujah oh he was just he thought everything was fine he thought he could hide it but you can't hide from God he knows what you're thinking right now he knows your thoughts for he's God that's the Holy Spirit that's in the building this morning knows your thoughts who you are where you came from what you've done listen to what brother Branham says here now you think brother Matt that's so horrible Oh could there be any recovery now as long notice as long as you're wanting and Hungary to get back to God there's a god somewhere calling to you or you wouldn't be hungry there's a place that you can cross where you can't get back but when that is you're down there again in the same shape you was it just goes to show you only fell from grace in other words if you couldn't get back to God you wouldn't want to get back to God listen to what he says backslidings not lost I want somebody to tell me where backslidings lost prove it in the Bible backsliders are not lost he's just out of fellowship David lost the joy of his salvation when he took Bathsheba Araiza but he never lost his salvation he didn't say restore to me the joy restored to me my salvation he says restore to me the joy of my salvation oh he says oh listen to what brother Branham says here oh there's so much of this legalism today touch not taste not you do things legally he says I didn't come to this church tonight legally I feel tired I feel nervous I'm upset I'm wondering about something that's before me my heart's burning even as such as to my heart's fluttering I got a cramp a pain right at this moment listening to brother Mannis begins to say even I feel I'm he was battling a physical ailment he says did my pain to shoot him up my back up here nervous I'm trembling he says oh he says I felt anything but to come to the house of God but why did I come because I love God live or die I must stand here it's not because I have to he wouldn't care about whether I did it or not I if I'd died I'd go to heaven anyhow but I come because I love him you serve God because you love him because you just got to do it because you love him enough David begins notice this here he begins to cry I want you to turn to Psalms 51 musicians could you come Psalms chapter 51 I want you to look at this here no doubt they begin to break what a reaction he has you notice he could have rose up and and just lashed out at Nathan how dare you how dare you expose me and you know but there was something inside of him there was even beyond all of the sin beyond all of the cover behind of all of the crust but by beyond all of the layers he had put over all of the religion all the covering and way down inside the core of that man was still along in a desire for Jesus to live for God and he begins to pray and I want you to notice this prayer here in Psalms chapter 51 that you can turn there brother Jeremy if you just pulled it up here Psalms chapter 51 I want you to notice the words that David begins to pray is Nathan confronts him says thou art the man you know no doubt David is broken he knows now that's all it's all out he's now judgments been passed upon him judgments gonna be passed upon his entire house do you have it brother Jeremy put it up there for me stomps 51 verse 1 have mercy this is the words he begins to pray have mercy upon me O God according to thy loving-kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions just keep going by the Jeremie with me wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee and the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that now notice that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold this is what David the revelation David gets behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden parts thou shalt make me to know wisdom in other words it doesn't matter how polished or how we're find I am on the outside that's not what you're looking for God because I could be so polished on the outside and have everything right on the inside on the outside but my inside could be a mess but today Lord I'm raising my hands that I'm saying Lord I don't want truth just to be on the outside but how many could pray with David and say Lord let truth be on the inside let me know it from the inside let my outside be a working from my inward parts in the hidden parts that no one else sees make me to know wisdom verse 7 purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities create in me a clean heart oh when I read those words when I speak them when your eyes see them I know that there's something inside of you that just says yes Lord yes Lord created me a clean heart as david prayed and i'm praying here today created me you know david uses a very special word in verse 10 create it's the first word in that sentence because he knows that only one person is attributed to that word because there's only one person who can create and that's the creator and david is attributed and saying god i can't do this i've solved for the wrong things i've looked at the wrong things i've sought after the wrong things but i'm going to ask you to do something I can't do create in me a clean heart O God and renew a right spirit within me and then he prays cast me not away [Music] want you to bow your heads with me here this morning David just for a moment here before we have you stand to stay there every hand out no doubt when the words thou art the man come through David's ears his mind begins to race no doubt David Koepp remember and he goes back in his memory he asks himself how how could I get here his mind begins to go back and he could remember another king when he was a young man he could remember another king who was confronted by another prophet here he David being a king Nathan being a prophet but he Bree whines in his mind and he says I was a teenager and I was I was put in the courts of king named Saul and I watched and I learned and I watched that Saul and he had a prophet and his name wasn't Nathan his name was Samuel and David begins to reminisce and remember in his mind I remember just like now just like Nathan's coming and confronting me there was another King and there was another prophet who confronted him and David says but I watched time after time he'd confront Saul and old Saul would get emotional and Saul would begin to cry sob would raise a sense Allah Oh Oh God forgive me me and the people Lord forgive me but David says but but he never changed he repented over and over but he nothing ever changed he can't kept with the desires desire never changed but but he kept coming to the same place and David begins to race in his mind as he hears those words thou art the man and now here he is King now here's a prophet and now it's his opportunity David says I remember Saul as God gave mercy time and time and time and time and time again but with each dismissal there was a season of verbal repentance but his feet never turned and he continued continued ASPs and david says but there came a point it didn't just stay that way that cycle that remained there came a point when God repented that he had made Saul King and the Bible says that the Holy Spirit departed from Saul and David remembers this and David says I remember the Holy Spirit the presence of God the presence of the Lord the communion with the Spirit of God the hand of Mercy that was upon his life as a king and the anointing upon his life David begins to shudder in fear as he begin to realize that Holy Spirit that means so much to me departed from that man he gets to such a place he sees goes to a witch the Witch of Endor and and and and Saul by his own confession says the Spirit of God has departed for me and you know what that may have not scared any other king but to a man like David the presence of God meant everything David could say you may get your satisfaction and money maybe that satisfies you maybe you get your satisfaction and in the world and maybe maybe that appeases your appetite and entertainments maybe that appeases you and maybe that's your life maybe you're content with that david says but not me i can't relate to that because my the ingredients of my life are made up of the things of god they're made up of the presence of god they're made up of the word of god the presence of god the voice of god that's what makes up my life and the thought that that could leave david says verse 11 cast me not away from thy presence take not thy spirit from me restore all the joy of my salvation could you stand to your feet now and renew arise [Music] could you raise your hands and sing it to the Lord now [Music] and renew a right spirit within sing that again created me yes Lord [Music] Oh meet it like a prayer [Music] and renew the right spirit within [Music] Oh cast me not away from thy presence take my take God my Holy Spirit from we store yes

from me [Music] restore unto me the joy [Music] when renew a right spirit in the word of the Lord this morning my that's my prayer today pray like David have mercy upon me O God how we need mercy you know repentance is not a prayer the penance is not a prayer repentance is not a confession you pray and you confess but real repentance is a cry for mercy it's an action it's a response and I just want to say Lord let me respond like David and all of my life Lord let me maybe you could say that by an uplift at hand before we close her today say Lord let me discern the season that I'm in don't let me be in the castle when I need to be on the battlefield which I'm living keep me desperate Lord keep me desperate keep me in and keep me give me keep my intensity my zeal it's not a time to be lackadaisical about the things of God it's a time to be it's time to be focused to say Lord let me stay in sync Oh could you pray that today say Lord let me stay in harmony let me be synchronized to
