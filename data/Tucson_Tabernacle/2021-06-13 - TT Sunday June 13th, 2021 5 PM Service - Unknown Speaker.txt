unspoken needs father god i ask that you have just hear the hearts lord i know that right now there's so many of us lord that are maybe feeling a little bit confused as to the situation with the

a sunday night to have a [Music] another opportunity to [Music] look into the word of god and to have god [Music] speak to our hearts just keep playing sis i just [Music] i've been so touched by hearing some of the prayers prayed and [Music] being with believers and i'm not a real old man but [Music] as i get older that universal family of god gets so rich to me [Music] that god give us a family it's more than just us here you have experienced that life that you get help all along the road i told the sister that i would have never dreamed that when i stood there as a boy maybe 19 or 20 on the front row because that's where brother perry thought the young man needed to be right there [Music] and he believed also that they should have a white wall well i didn't know what a white white walls were until i got one i thought my hair was okay but but i would have never dreamed and i tell it for the glory of the lord and i tell it especially to you young people [Music] you seem like you struggle and you don't know what to do next and get so desperate one time i was in the forest dug my hands down in the dirt as i was praying and i said lord what are you gonna do with me i'm just a bunch of dirt so desperate for his direction and a little thought come to me what do you do with a handful of dirt you you put a seed in it [Music] but i told the sister who would uh would i ever dream that i'd go from there to that back office there you know i thought when i was praying this morning i thought lord that's so ironic that here i am praying back in the office there and the lord's let us go around the world and see so many blood washed saints and their testimonies and some of the brothers know those things to see how precious those saints are there's a home coming there's a homecoming and brother branham loved that [Music] poem that said of longfellow and he said i can't remember the verse exactly that says with a heart for any fate with a heart for any faith we don't know what god will have but we're going to meet it by his grace whatever it is and when this is over we're going to a place where the prophet said every wrong will be righted how's god going to do that [Music] it's not going to get white washed it's not going to get swept under the carpet every wrong will be righted [Music] and he went there and i believe it he saw beyond the curtain of time [Music] so great to be part of his family [Music] let's just bow our heads before we approach the word of god heavenly father we're so thankful for these moments together lord to open our hearts to you lord lord to allow ourselves to be broken down to see our own littleness and our failures and to learn to forgive lord help us to learn to forgive heal press on with the price clear before eyes we worship you tonight a little girl sang that song so pretty when the sun goes down let me be praising [Music] let it be today and let it be so in our life lord we love you and as we approach your word we commit our hearts to you in jesus name amen amen i like to read a portion of job while you're standing and this morning we mentioned job and you know the word of god always challenges us to believe and paul in the book of hebrews he explained about the children of israel and he said that they couldn't enter into the promised land because of unbelief and the scripture talks about job being a righteous man and loving god and then it tells how satan said that you have a hedge built around him and that's why he serves you like he does because you know life's good for job and then in the end of the first chapter it gives a list of the things that happened to job through verse 14 to 20 in the first chapter of job messenger came and said that all his sheep and his animals were destroyed and all his good stolen and then it says that his whole family was dining in the house and in verse number 19 and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and i and i only and escaped alone to tell thee the scripture says one messenger came and said you've you've lost your animals and the other messenger come and said you've lost all your servants and the other messenger came and it says while that messenger was speaking another messenger came and what we believe as believers is this is not a story it's not a dramatization but it's the truth and that's what this man went through and i'd like to read this before we uh speak this evening verse 20. then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped and said naked came i out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return hither the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord and in all of this job sinned not nor charged the lord foolishly may the lord add his blessings to his word you may be seated we were speaking this morning about man and how that god knew what was in man and god knew what was in job and this was job's spontaneous gut reaction to the providence of god that he fell on his face and worshiped god and he spoke a simple truth that naked i came into the world and naked shall i return thither and it's the truth that job had buried in his heart that allowed him to stand because this is in fact the truth and it's some very basic truths that many times because of the fullness that of life that god gives to us it's very ironic if i saw a man today i couldn't speak to him i seen the tears flowing out of his eyes and i said now i'm not a medical person i'm not a psychologist but alls i could see was tears flooding out of that man's eyes looked like he was suffering and i didn't know if it was from drugs or or a pain in his stomach or what but i couldn't speak to him but i know that if a man is addicted to drugs and and he went that way and having spoken to some of these men at length a man that was delivered from heroin and that we got an opportunity to know in bulgaria your life is is empty of everything except this addiction to this substance and that's as big as your world is this man expressed to me he said that that's that was my world and then god takes us from nothing and job expressed this in his sorrows he said why didn't i die at birth when he was really down and out and it brings to light you know the things that that that could happen and job said none of those things happened to me and you know here i am and we read the scripture he finally came to the place he said who is man that you are mindful him why are you testing me like this why can't i get from out from under your attention he he wanted to flee from the attention of god and he looked at himself and he said what is man that that you are mindful of him but not to go off the point that we were making is is that many of our struggles and many of our trials and testings and the consternations that we have and frustrations is because that god has given you such a full life he's given you the fullness of life and we we somehow we don't realize that our problems are first world problems and we use they they use that term in economics if you if you didn't have so much money you wouldn't have so much troubles but let's just not talk about economics let's just talk about the fullness of life and how that god has brought the things of the kingdom of god to your doorstep god has brought conviction to your doorstep and it's the grace of god that leads a man to repentance it's the goodness of god it's his reaching out to man that brings conviction in your life what a wonderful honor to be brought on the carpet by the almighty oh hallelujah what who what is man that god is so mindful that he wants to chasten you and i was telling someone the other day that i'm so thankful when my wife and i and our family went through some very dark times when the lord took our children home we saw just pure love on display just friends and our fellow man and christians displaying the love of god and support and and love and and pureness of heart and how beautiful it was to see that but i wouldn't be telling the whole story if i didn't say that what really brings healing is the truth and god brings you to a place where you have to look into the word of god and recognize some very simple truths and this is something that job had down in his bosom was an unassuming attitude and a revelation that hey i came into this world naked everything that i have everything that was given to me was given to me of god and he rent his clothes but he worshiped i was speaking at easter time in england and we were talking about the resurrection and paul said that the resurrection was sown in dishonor it is sown in weakness it is sown in corruption and i thought it might be a blessing if there's let's do a little bible drill here this evening to help the preacher i looked for that scripture is there someone in the house tonight that can call that scripture that was a real question in a real time of need it is sown in uh that is uh i'm sorry i would really like to get that scripture and i looked for it first corinthians 15. and we were speaking about this morning and i'd like to just take make a little review uh you that were here this morning we were talking about what form man has and let's just before we read that read what brother branham said we felt we didn't have time to read it uh this morning but it seems a little more casual this evening we could take a little time this is in hebrews chapter 2 part 3. now when man become into that body he had control of all the fishes and the fowls and the beasts of the field now that body that he was speaking of was that theophany body and then there was no man to till the soil he done made male and female but there was no man to till the soil then god made man out of the dust of the earth he gave him a hand like a chimpanzee he give him a foot like a bear he give him he made him on the image and on this earthly body is in the image of animal life and it's made out of the same kind of material your body is made just the same kind of material as a horse or a dog or anything like that it's made out of calcium potash petroleum cosmic light your all flesh is like this not not the same flesh it's different flesh but it's made out of the dust of the earth where it come from but the difference between an animal and a man god put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany and that's why it's so hard to relate like we were speaking this morning on what we're made out of and we're made out of you know carbon and oxygen and mostly water and we set those things it's very hard for us to relate to that because we're not thinking in that realm because we're so much aware of this that god put in us a soul where we're so much knowing down in our inside that we're more than what the animals are but nevertheless brother branham brought that to our attention and the word of god brings that to our attention as we spoke of this morning and then paul when he's speaking of the resurrection he said but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come thou fool that which thou showest is not quickened except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bear grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body so let's just stop a moment if that sounds maybe too old english to you it's very simple that when you take a seed maybe it's a tomato plant or any kind of little seed as you did in school and i i know we all brought things home from school and put them on the windowsill and we we were anxious to see we put it in the cup and then we were waiting and waiting to see what would come out of the ground and paul's just simply saying that what you put into the ground is not what comes up but god gives it a body and so you put this little grain of corn in there and up comes this leaf but then god from that little germ and man can't even find where the life is in that germ because you look at the seed and you say well the life's in that seed but as you pull that apart it's it's really the shock that is protecting the pulp there's a little kind of a shell and then under that there's this pope that is not really where the life is at the life is in there inside that pulp in a little germ of life and it's there and now that life god is going to give that life a body and as that life breaks forth this this body that's given to that becomes manifest and and that corn comes up and then the great big leaves and the next thing you know here is this great big stalk taller or bigger than i am and all these branches and all these corn on that well where did that come from god giveth it a body it's just a miracle that we just take for granted you know we don't think about these things you know i was talking to mustafa and wali and a muslim men in an airport in germany and we got to talking about god and i learned a couple of things along the road and i knew that you could just directly go into a argument of jesus versus muhammad but who cares about that they were lovely men they asked to be sit at my table i said yeah sit down and i don't know how we got started but i said i gave my heart to god when i was 19. the man said my that's something you know that's a young age most of us it takes a lot older and then we just became i don't want to rehearse this conversation right now but one thing led to another just talking about god and we talked about why is it that man goes to i guess i'm gonna tell a little bit of it we got to talking about well it was mustafa he was going off on telephones how they were ruining his family that they were ruining his culture that he was irate about what cell phones were doing and how per how he hated them with a perfect hatred and i thought wow you know you're pretty eccentric you know and i thought i was bad and then we got to talking about society and how man gets in this condition and we got to talking about that no matter in what you believe that the law cannot hold you and it didn't work for the jews and it didn't work for the muhammadans and it don't work for the christians the law can't hold you and we just sat there and fellowshipped about that that it didn't matter what you believed law couldn't hold you because you're just talking about how nobody respects the law and nobody respects the word of god and you know that's why we're in this condition and i i asked him i said well you know what is it in man that you that he can love god i said now you know what about the people that do love god and fail and i said what is that in man that can love god like that in and then do the wrong things and i said we're grown men you know we can talk about those things and then we got to talking about the fall in the garden and i asked him i said now you believe don't you believe in the fall in the garden they said yes and they said do you believe it was an apple and they laughed and so we got to talking about serpent seed we got to talk and i think i mentioned it this morning i asked you know well does god know who's going to heaven and i ask him well who when did he know that and then we got to talking about predestination we talked about the cedar trees in california and how one of those trees will produce thousands of pine cones in its lifetime but only a handful of those are destined to life it'll produce thousands you look around those trees and they're just piles and these trees live for hundreds of years and every year they're putting out hundreds and hundreds those giant trees just hundreds of these pine cones and in every pine cone there might be 50 or 100 seeds but in the life of that tree it'll only produce six other giant sequoia trees but god knows every seed that will come to life and produce another tree and we just we're talking about these things just as natural as we were reading this you know sports page or something just normal and mustafa says to me he says mr dennis he said these things the normal person is not thinking of these things he said these things are very high and i said mustafa no they're not who are we look at the three of us here these things are not high and it's just the truth and and we had such a wonderful time and we sat there for two hours without conflict three men just observing simple truths so they got up and mustafa says to me yes he said all these things are true mr dennis but you must receive god's messenger when god sends a messenger you are obligated to receive him i said yes mustafa you mean like a prophet he said yes and i said well i said how would we know he was a prophet would he be vindicated by god i said let me write a little name here mustafa i said search it out see if this is god's messenger because he'd already said amen to so many things he preached but so now paul is talking about some very common things and the and this is what sometimes we we just overshoot it in the scripture you know we're so we're so uh wanting to be revelation prone that we overshoot the mark when if we would just allow god to talk to us in something very simple and take the word of god at face value i never understood that exception i had to ask my mother to explain that and i said you always use that expression mom what do you mean by that taking something at face value and she says well get a quarter out he said what does it say on there it says 25 cents that's what that's worth 25 cents that's the face value of it now i suppose that if it was a 20 i don't know what quarter would be some value but i guess you know to a collector you know they might say well actually that's that coin is a collector's item it's it's worth more than the face value but if we would just take the word of god at face value and and instead of trying to read revelation into it just accept it how god is speaking his word to us and paul's just asking us to consider that the seed that you put in the ground first thing he says thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die so we're talking about the resurrection now how paul's just saying everybody knows that that seed has to be buried and that's what the prophet of god expressed to us about the new birth that you have to die that the first doctrine of jesus the first teaching the first thing that he wanted man to understand is that you can't understand the kingdom of god unless you're born again and then by the grace of god we understood the prophet to explain to us that you can't be born again until you first die so there is that principle that there has to be a dying for there to be life and that doesn't happen when you ju when you get converted but you learn that that's a principle that for someone else to prosper you have to give up your space for someone else to flourish you got to give them room somebody else's rest is purchased by your labors by your sacrifice someone benefits it's just the way life is but what happens in a christian is they get so in love with god and they get so much of the love of god in their life first being a recipient that's what's so beautiful about the message that paul was bringing this morning was is that first we have to see where he come from and what he did we have to see it coming this way and i think so many times we just get so excited about being a son of god being a manifested son of god at the end time and manifesting the word born bride seed for our age and we're just like well you know where do i get into that where does it start where do i sign you start by recognizing what he did before we can go this way we have to see how he came this way and that was what paul was trying to express in hebrews this morning is how he the fountain of all holiness took on sin and became sin and became sinful man so there's great parallel in these scriptures about we were talking about the temple that jesus put on or the body that jesus lived in but paul talking about the resurrection and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be you don't see after you put that little tomato seed in the ground your children that go to school you don't see a little seed pop up but thou showest not that body that shall be but bear grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but god giveth the body giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beast another of fishes and another of birds there are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead what art now what is the sowing that paul is speaking of here the resurrection this so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul and the last adam was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterwards that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthly the second man is the lord from heaven and we won't read all of this but when god brings you certain places in your life by necessity by survival you have to look at the truth and embrace the truth that man always feared death and there's no glorious way to die you say well if you if you died a hero but it's still death and and then there's men that died heroes never recognized to heroes i grew up in the vietnam war mothers lost their sons by the thousands and brothers and sisters lost their sil siblings and you know fathers lost their sons and and men saw their buddies bosom buddies die in combat terrible deaths but they never were recognized as heroes not like the second world war where the men come back on the ships and and and the people said you know you came back you you were a hero for freedom but in the bibliwack of life in in in all what's going around the world there's a tremendous amount of heartache and suffering amongst men and who can console and who can comfort those things only god can by his truth the word of god that one truth is that the resurrection is sown it's sown and i had on my heart this evening to kind of review what we spoke about this morning but if we could get a little bit to the crux of it what we were speaking about is how that man gets in this condition where he's ashamed of himself he's tired he's worn out he's confused he's frustrated he's dejected and rightly so we're not making light by throwing adjectives about real heartache to me it would be tragic to to craft words when men's hearts and lives are when they're suffering and and it's real that's not our purpose this evening but all of us brothers and sisters we find ourselves in this place where we don't mind fighting a battle to win the prize we don't mind investing ourselves to know that hey we're we're we're gonna overcome we're gonna we're gonna win the prize we're we're gonna be there with him and and when this is all said and done in the holy writ it's gonna be written that we fought a good fight we we ran the race we faithed it out we persevered and we did it in christ's name because we loved him and we were real soldiers of the cross and our desire is to lay our armor down and rest with him and hear him say well done my good and faithful servant but do we go through our whole life in some kind of a mental chaos and in some kind of an upset way and uh and and and you know some people when they work get very in a huff and now probably nobody in here but but some people you know they get so goal orientated they really get huffy when they're trying to get something done and and it's just it's licensed for anything you know it's it's like get out of the way brother aaron i'm going to preach tonight if it you know hairless the governor and and and you know it's this disregard for everybody around them because hey you know god said in the garden by the sweat of your brow and that's just how it is and and if you don't like it get out of my way and and what is this glorious thing that gives license to that it's it's this job that's in front of you you know and but we would we would be willing to sacrifice our lives that our testimony would be that that he really pushed through and and pursued and paid the price but is it the will of god that we live in a dust storm in a in a cloud of dust of struggling and and working and then all of a sudden at the end of the road in all of this chaos and confusion in our life jesus is going to say well done faithful servant is that how we think it is is that what we're thinking or are we supposed to be partakers of the divine nature and jesus knew he was putting on sinful flesh when he came to earth he wasn't taking on dust man as we said this morning little jesus you know said well i'll take a little potash i'll take a little calcium i'm repeating myself for the benefit of somebody who wasn't here step into that gabriel step into that wormwood he stepped in it to himself that's not the man that jesus came to be that's when he called himself the son of man he was the son of god but he came as son of man sinful man the prophet of god said sinful man so that he would know the nature that he would know what we're feeling and we read where brother branham said that it's not the idea that he just knows what you're going through because he's god and he's omnipotent and he knows all things but it's very different when you see it in light of the word of god that he came to be our brethren and a partaker of this flesh that we live in fallen man that's why he called himself son of man because that's he he became son of man to take that stinger of of sin because the sting of death is sin and that stinger had to anchor in flesh not in theophany not in some other form but man he took the sting of death for man so now is it so that we just press on through chaos and and confusion so that jesus can say well done or is it possible that god wants us to understand that in our struggles and in our battles that we don't have to get beside ourselves and take on an attitude and say well i don't know why i'm the way i am just let me be let's just let me press on i don't know why i'm so confused but i'm just going forward i don't believe that that's the fellowship that god wanted us to have in this life because god brought us into this life why what's job one for every believer to be somebody that god can have fellowship with you ever had a friend who was so nervous they had to clean they had to work i had a friend one time we got an invite over to their house and that was so great you know because they never had time to you know had too much fellowship or at least the brother didn't and i was like looking forward to like man i'm gonna hang with this brother you know and you talk to him and he's bringing in the firewood and then you know then it's over there and he's picking up and he's cleaning them my poor wife would never have me do this you know clean if you're going to have fellowship with them you know you're just going to have to walk around with them and talk to them so anyway how did that go over there uh you know doing okay for you but that's not the kind of fellowship that great if he would have sat down with a cup of coffee and looked me in the eyes and and we could you know kind of talk about life and what you're looking forward to and what you've been through so i do believe that god desires that kind of fellowship with his children real idol so what is it that causes us to not be eye to eye as one brother said and we're borrowing from this morning he said i always prayed that god you're aware of where i'm at you know everything and because that you know everything you know i failed you today you know i came short today and i'm sorry you know you're god in heaven and you know all things and he said after he considered these things that paul was saying in second hebrews about what is man that you are mindful of him or the son of man that thou visites him and after seeing how that paul would express that he is touched by the feelings of our infirmities why because he felt them he knew what it was to have to get up after falling down on the way to calvary to say i came for this purpose i he knew what it was to ache in his body and to be suffering in his body and not only was he suffering in his body but he was being accused of being some wacko religious nut who thought that he was god and the to the very people that he came to save he knew he felt rejection he was every bit of man you say well he didn't feel that he was just some angel that put on a robe and he was invincible and and and you know he was just doing his job that's not true because he wept at the grave of lazarus he came into jerusalem and he wept over jerusalem and he said oh jerusalem jerusalem how often i would have hovered you and how many times have we had desires in our heart and things we wanted to do and what we wanted to do be for people maybe our own children our own family and we had these desires of of of our emotions and our affections and the things that were in us and by god's great providence we're never allowed to be displayed and were so disappointed disappointed to the bone did he feel that did jesus ever feel that yes he took the sting of death in his flesh he became flesh and so here we are in life in all of these struggles and because we don't understand what he was trying to express when he said i know the pain you feel we're we're being redundant from this morning sermon i just beg your forgiveness but i just want to go there that we cause it to be some kind of a intellectual thing some kind of an academic thing had something just to be aware of like like science and just to know that god is god and god knows every detail of your life and we accept that and we sell short the whole concept of god's love it's not that i'm just omnipotent and i know everything so i know every detail about that situation that's not what god is trying to express in his word he's trying to express to us and have this fellowship with us that i know not because i'm omnipotent i know because i was there i wore that robe of sinful flesh i know what that rush of temptation is and how foreign it feels to you as a son and daughter of god when that flush of temptation comes over or that that ungodly sinful nature washes over you to test you i know i felt that because i was in every way tempted as you are but what does man do what does the believer do i can only speak from my experience but it looks like it's in the word of god man when these things come upon him it seems that he he thinks that temptation is a strange thing and he thinks that i must be in there must be something wrong in my spiritual life there must be something wrong that i would come into this place that seems so unholy that seems so weak that seems so unlike what i desire to be and we want to hide that from god we want to maybe feel like well this behavior now now the way i'm behaving now that let's have that off the record let's not have that be on the record this is a this is a lapse in my christian experience this is a little backslid moment this is a little i'm weary i'm just so tired i just don't want to go on anymore but don't let anybody hear i said that because i'm a manifested son of god in the end time with a revelation of the word of god i'm an overcomer i'm i'm i'm more than overcomer or we we sing in in in church that that that i'm more than an overcomer and so we just want to disconnect this part of our life and and and pretend that it's not part of it that that's just me that's just you know that's just brother dennis lord i don't know why i'm like that and it's a disconnect it's a disconnect it's like i don't want to i i don't know why i'm that way and i don't want to talk about it and let's not go there and let's talk about something else and and and sweep that under the carpet and let's talk about you know the next life for heaven or let's talk about the prophet of god let's talk about revelation but let's not go there but but why would we want to live like that why not bring it to the lord jesus and say lord i got everything to be happy about but i'm real tired right now and i know you've been tired like this i don't seem to fit i've labored all my life to be a dad or a husband or you know part of the church and i was a young man i drove in my car from one end of the town bought a coke drove all through town real slow real slow all the way to the other tent of the town and bought an ice cream i hope you don't think this is foolish i was trying to live for god and i was lonely i knew the prophet of god said not to go to movies but i didn't have any family in town i couldn't go to mom and dad's my i couldn't go to my brother my brother wasn't in town i didn't have anybody i was a young person in the in a church that didn't have much young people and the young people that were were not living for the lord they didn't have no problem with going to movies and to me i had a revelation that that is a bunch of the devil's playground the world and i'm living for god what in the world do i belong in a movie house for now i i'm just assuming that a young person now can have this device in front of them and get the same revelation oh my goodness that is not good for my soul it's a greater test we have to we used to have to you know if you were gonna sin i never did by the grace of god i didn't go to movies but i know that there were some that said you know you we'd look around you know make sure nobody's going to see us go in the building you hear all kinds of stories you know and then they then they run into somebody and they're like wow you're as bachelor as i am what are you doing here but no now the stakes are way higher now you just got your own privacy and your own device you don't think that god's raising the bar on holiness you don't think that in the end time you're going to have to be a bigger greater young person believer than ever any age in the past because there's nobody going to see what you're watching on your phone it's only between you and the savior and if you're gonna stand you're gonna stand by your own integrity which when we say your own integrity it's something that god's going to do in your heart and soul and cause you to eschew evil but why is it that when we're tempted we somehow have this disconnect with our lord and savior and say oh this this this is now confusion this part here this is not the holiness life this is not because i'm i'm being pressed upon i'm not feeling good i'm not maybe mastering this with my mental ability i'm struggling and that's not fellowship with jesus sure it is yes you're being a partaker of his sufferings like job said this morning if i be wicked then why do i labor for favor with god if if i'm just gonna you know if i'm the rat that the devil made me up let go let me find a hole and crawl in it but i'm not a rat i'm a son of god but i'm in this body i was born a son of man and that's why he identified himself as the son of man because he came and suffered in this body yes and the resurrection is sown in weakness this is that sowing it's up to god to give it a body ah but we got a sneak preview of the new body we got some inside information on what to invest in you know if you do that on wall street they call that inside trading you might could go to prison but we got some information on inside trading on what to invest in and we're so confident on the information that we got that we're putting all our chips on one square and people are looking around and they're saying you're kidding me you're putting all your chips on the resurrection and they say yeah because i got a little glimpse of it i saw the waving of the sheath i saw the first man that race from the dead jesus christ the son of god as a student of the word of god if i understand the bible brother branham wasn't that chief jesus was that chief brother branham was the priest that waved the sheaf and said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever that spirit that can enter you into you and mortify this mortal body if it can if that life overcame death how much more can that life living in you make alive or quicken this mortal body there's no evidence and no theory and postulate that man has produced no matter how many self-help books i'm not a believer in them but when i read the title i think man maybe maybe that one huh you ever read those titles and it just it has such a great promise you know how to establish financial freedom in three easy steps and man it's only seven bucks but they do it in the spiritual realm too turn on the tv it'll break your heart i was in bulgaria and they didn't have a translator for me so i'm staying at a house so what do you do with this guy that don't speak your language well set him in front of the tv and stick a benny hinn video on for him it's in english the guy can watch benny han he's a christian he's going to love it oh my goodness and these people are poor as dirt excuse me to speak about my brothers and sisters like that i don't mean but you know in the natural realm and they want 45 us dollars for his promise to how to overcome temptation what christian doesn't want to know how to overcome temptation but the word of god tells us that he came down and suffered temptation so that he would know how to secure sakura means comfort and secure means make secure so that he would know and as we came to the end of the sermon this morning we began to speak about this concept of well maybe we didn't go that far but we learned in the old testament that when a man brought the lamb and this lamb that was offered was going to be an innocent lamb and that lamb was going to die in the place of the sinner so if we lived in that day and we brought our lamb to the temple we're familiar with the idea that the the comer had to identify with his sacrifice brother ranum explained how that they would lay their hand on that bleeding lamb and when that lamb would die and quiver they get their hands in that blood and see that innocent life and say this lamb is dying in my stead and the idea and the picture was to enter in to that lamb's suffering now we as believers we long to understand calvary more and to have a greater appreciation of jesus's suffering at calvary but before we do that think of it in this way that jesus didn't just lay his hands on us to understand us think of it going the other way now we're trying to understand who he was and and what he went through but first because we're not certain that we can really grasp that and i remember times when i've prayed and i've asked the lord you know give me a greater understanding and and vision of calvary and i was amazed at the ministers you set by and brothers that came and preached in something and i think i think oh lord you know thank you but still we we might wonder if we really understand but one thing we know for sure is that coming the other way that he does understand our condition that there's no there's no disconnect with god understanding what you're suffering because he was there because he experienced it and so in our lives when we come into these places where i don't mean to use casual words in such a sacred subject but we feel so yucky things come under over us and come to tempt us and come in and and and expose our our condition and we just think yuck you know god changed me i i don't want to struggle with these things that is not a time to unplug it's a time when you feel that and you feel your humanity and everything that goes with it to say jesus we have fellowship in this you know what this is we can commune in this we can have oneness we can have fellowship you can be my brother you were not ashamed to call me your brother and paul had to do this he had to explain and express the true condition of jesus coming as the son of man and you say well brother dennis i always understood that to be a prophet no that's just part of it when god spoke to ezekiel he said son of man prophesy the astounding thing was that the word of god could be on the lips of a man how that moses that's the thing that that they got confused with moses and they said hey wait a minute you're not the only one holy we recognize that you're a man just like we are but the difference with moses was the word of god was on his lips and that's when god spoke to ezekiel and he said son a man prophesy he meant just that son of man man born of women what's one of the other expressions the sons of men son of man prophesy i'm going to put my word on your lips that's what a prophet is just a man with the word of god on his lips that's why they called them son of man and when jesus came and walked in flesh he he was every bit man and that's why he introduced himself as the son of man and the people couldn't understand it and they said he said the son of man shall be lifted up and when the son of man is lifted up i'll draw all man unto me and they said how says thou they said who is this son of man how many know the scripture we're talking about huh let's see a few hands just so we know okay you guys can tell the others well we ought to i mean we are we under such spiritual pressure that we can't be natural in families with one another and just say man well do you know what that means or do we got to put on some facade like i heard that before yeah i know that i know that i know i got a grandson that says that he's about seven i think i know i i already know that i'm i'm trying to come up with things that he doesn't know he's had a lot of exposure at seven years old so it takes me a lot to think of something that he doesn't already know but is that how we get can we just know that we're sons and daughters of god that that it's okay to say i never understood that in the bible i never knew what brother brown was talking about and so they said to him they said who is the son of man because the scribes and the pharisees they say when christ comes when messiah comes when the christ comes he abideth forever what do you mean he'll be lifted up because they knew that being lifted up was crucifixion look in your bible read the scriptures the scriptures interpret themselves this isn't a lot of reading between the lines and prophetic utterance here this is just bible reading where you you read a couple of verses and you say what does that mean and then read a few farther and the verses that are under those verses explain what the verses above them were that's just easy so they said who is this son of man because we're expecting the christ and he abideth forever why do you say the son of man will be lifted up but how was jesus gonna draw all men to him by being glorified or be by being humiliated by dying as a man by being lifted up on calvary he's going to draw all men unto him now when we lift up jesus and we lift up his name we're lifting up who he was he didn't come as son of god some spirit being that was above man and putting on a mystic costume like you go to disneyland or disney world it all looks one way on the face and i remember as a little boy i lived in san diego we went up to to disney world and i can remember when i got big enough and i looked behind the facade and i was shocked my you know little young mind went oh that's only the old west on the front and on the back it's like everything else i was just like oh my reality struck in that it wasn't through and through that i wasn't back in time i was just they put on a facade but jesus didn't put on a facade and say you know really i'm something else and i've just got the man coat on no he became man he became sinful flesh he became sin for us i got to close oh my it's seven we didn't start at six we started five lord forgive me but i challenge you i challenge you just go in hebrews 2 or hebrews 1. let me just give you one you do it at home paul trying to introduce who jesus really is and he said for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again quoting another scripture i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and if you've got a schofield bible there's a little bee by there say where it says i will be to him a father and he will be to me a son and it's going to refer you to go and read in second samuel 7 and 14 where the prophet samuel i mean uh the prophet nathan is speaking to david when david wanted to build the temple and nathan's telling him no it's you're not going to build the temple let's sneak over there quickly second samuel 7 14. we just go up a little just to get it in context start 12 and when thy days be fulfilled now this is the lord speaking through the mouth of nathan to david and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of the thy bowels and i will establish this kingdom he shall build an house for my name and i will establish the throne of his kingdom forever i will be his father and he shall be my son we're all thinking solomon right so why when paul is referring to jesus is he making his case on who jesus is he's not an angel he's not a prophet but he's this one that is spoken of by god and he's saying we know he was spoken of by god because it's in the scriptures he's explaining who jesus is and over here in hebrews he's saying i will be to him a father and he shall be to be a son it's just in our mind very clear over here in hebrews he's spoken speaking about jesus right are you with me is anybody with me or is it were we okay i know it's late but and then when we turn back here to where the prophecy comes from if we do like so many of us do or have done i've been guilty of it i'm just only going to read 14 and it's almost to say like okay just uh i'm just a spell checker you know i'm just a text checker and i see that paul quoted the the verse here and okay i just confirmed that it's from the old testament that it's a prophecy and that's as far as i go you know it's like what am i doing you know checking the printer of the bible that the references are correct am i am i benefiting in my heart and in my mind am i getting closer to god am i understanding or do i have time for that didn't mean that to be a rebuke but it just is you know if you want a friendship you got to spend time with somebody that's not always easy that's a little hard because there's a lot of people we'd like to spend more time with so i i don't mean to be cocky and be hard but that's just one of the hard things of life but nevertheless if we want to check this old testament reference of paul and then we go back over here and we just read verse 14 maybe we wouldn't get it in context but if we take a little time and say okay he took this scripture to describe jesus who's speaking here in verse 14 and what is the context of verse 14 so here we go again on verse 12 and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of the out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom he shall build a house for my name and i will establish the throne of his kingdom forever i will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men but my mercy shall not depart away from him as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee thy throne shall be established forever according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david and we find ourselves in the same place that philippian eunuch ethiopian eunuch when when philip went to him and he said does david speak of himself or does he speak of another now this wasn't perhaps the scripture but who is the prophet of god speaking of here is he speaking of solomon or is he speaking of jesus and so we come to this verse and it says i will be his father and he shall be my son paul told us that that's jesus but then we get to the next verse and it says if he commit iniquity and we think oh no well that can't be jesus because jesus couldn't have iniquity unless he was wearing it in his flesh yours mine he was living in it he was living in sinful flesh the prophet of god said he became a sinner the fountain of all holiness he lived in that flesh i don't honestly know what brother branham commented on the scripture if he did please share it with me but i can't help but get very suspicious when i say when it says i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of man what iniquity could jesus have mine oh the word of god is so beautiful when i suffer should i disconnect when i go home at the end of a day the bible says confession is good for the soul i start out in the morning word of god so awesome you read a little message book you read a scripture the presence of the lord comes man it's so beautiful and i drive in my vehicle and i start coming close to the house and i feel so defeated so tired and so weary feel like i got nothing left you know you're coming home to your family maybe to your wife and you got nothing left and you think where was that from this morning where is that guy where where is that guy and we just wanted like you know how some people don't want to go on certain apps because your phone will know where you've been and they give you advertising or you don't want the gps to know where you are am i crazy so you wish you could use your phone and hide from the gps it's like yeah i was looking into this but you know please don't advertise me to death just because i casually looked at this product and we wish we could just kind of and that's somehow sometimes when we get weary and when we fail and when we get tempted and we and and and we don't feel like the overcomer we should we we want to put something up and say god don't look at this part and he's saying son daughter what do you mean don't look at that part i'd live there you're going through this because you want to be clean because you love god you're suffering because you love me because you want to be clean and you're living in a dirty world in a fallen condition you don't need to put the umbrella up talk to me i've been there we're in this together this is the fellowship that's why i came and walked in shoe leather so that we could have this fellowship god bless you let's stand together i know since my little study in hebrews i'll never think of that title that jesus gave himself i'll never think of it the same said to peter who does man say i the son of man am peter said despite all outward appearances you're the christ you're the son of god he said peter you didn't get that on your own you didn't get that because you were smart god gave you that oh hallelujah god gave you that love in your heart that's why you suffer because god gave you that heart and that thirst to serve people to love god that song that we sang earlier in the song service to be like jesus i remember seeing that when i first learned it right over there but maybe before we go i put put a little song in your remembrance and maybe you can go and listen to it we had a brother in our church at home and maybe i can carry the tune myself you can venture to help me if you dare i i don't promise to be in any particular key but years ago it was so that if someone had a song on their heart they'd just come and sing it they grabbed that little blue only belief book and if the lord was dealing with them and they wanted to sing that song everybody was a singer in the congregation now we know everybody's not but it was just that much family when i first started going to church you just had enough i don't know you could just stand in front of your brothers and sisters and say this song bless my heart i want to try to sing it and this brother would come up and he'd sing this song who am i that a king should bleed and die for who am i that he would pray not my will thine lord the answer i may [Music] when i think of how he came so far from glory came to dwell amongst the lowly such as i to suffer shame and such disgrace on mount calvary take my place then i ask myself this question who am i oh here [Music] where am i [Music] [Applause] [Music] he would [Music] when i'm reminded of his words i'll leave [Music] just be true i'll give to you my life [Music] forever [Music] to deserve god's only son [Music] there [Music] where am i should pray just why he ever loved let's just bow our heads in prayer lord jesus we so love you lord and lord all the commandments that were very well aware of seemed to avail us not when they adjured us to be obedient we just couldn't do it lord [Music] but oh lord when we look at what you did for us when we look at how you suffered for our satan then some love wells up from deep within our heart and inspires us [Music] it causes us to want to be like you and we see your love and that love that you put in us the deep calls to deep and it's that love that we see displayed that inspires our love to want to live cleaner live truer and be more sincere oh that you look at our hearts lord and see that we want to be genuine and we want to be real before you we see how your prophet lived his life for you and all of these things lord what wells in us is to want to love back lord [Music] the law never did that lord fear never did that but love can push our faith out on the front lines lord we can live the kind of life that we desire to live because you overcame for us lord we can be like all the flowers that you made and not have our heads tilted down like that because that you took our shame you fellowshipped with us and suffering we can lift our head up praise you love you let our bloom be heaven word lord so be it lord may we never disconnect in a time of trial and tempting and suffering oh lord don't let us do that but let us reach out to you fellowship with you in the things that you suffered we suffer we give ourselves to you now lord commit our hearts into your care [Music] in jesus name amen god bless you saints oh who am i [Music] uh [Music] he would go i had heard of brother dennis before i'd met him [Music] and then a few harmonies ago i guess four or five years ago there was an accident in an airplane where he lost his son i had just heard the name didn't know who it was and i met him at harmony at bacon and i found out that sort of people who that's the brother so i wanted i went up to to express my condolences and this is what spoke to me when he told me that when he heard of the accident all he had and it was his son and there was another boy and two girls in the plane that he quickly went to brother wallace as quick as he could to comfort him i'll never ever forget that and in his grief for his son he went to help the brother who lost his [Music] and when jesus says in your weakness i am made strong because he's been there already and he's able to secure he's able to help he's able to rescue because he's been there he's walked that bath when you see the footprints in the sand of time he's carrying you through that time i will say this having six daughters and no sense i will say this to you fathers and two mothers don't turn on your children when they come back and ask you why don't make yourself too godly for them they would ask me dad why does a 16 year old boy act like this and this was my answer you didn't know your dad when he was 16. i've been there before and that's exactly what god told you today i've been where you're at i've walked where you walked i'm bored on the hurt the shame the iniquity for you i think brother dennis did a good job to say don't turn from him then he wants to show his grace his mercy his love because he understands that spoke to me in him he knew how he was hurting he knew how brother wallace was hurting and he wanted to go comfortably he's a god that loves us he's a god that cares so much that he took on flesh human flesh was able to feel pain and sorrow and hurt and he bore our shame in our iniquity i shared with you in my prayer there lord do you understand what it is to be forsaken and he said to me did not i cry out my father my father why his help forsaken me and i asked him if he understood foot pain when i was going through my surgery and all and he said we're not those my bloody flip footprints on the way up to calvary he just said yes i do and by that i can reach out and draw you to myself you should love him more than you ever thought you thought you loved him before how much more that he cared for he says i've been there where you at brother i i've been there and you can overcome like i overcame right you know he became me so that i might become him he said i'll come down and i'll show you let's sing that once before we go he became so that i might become him [Music] he that became might become him my grace so that i through his love could take him [Music] he became me so that i might become what you say sing that to him in appreciation and love back to [Music] that him might become you my grace [Music] so that i might become you by you took my place so that i through your love could take me so that i [Music] in a manger amongst all the animal filth and everything so he could understand so he could say that was me that was i appreciate that of him today thank you brother dennis for yielding yourself and allowing god to speak to us and i think through this we can love one another more and we can love him more just a greater and a deeper appreciation so god bless you as you go brother peter will you be ready for wednesday night wave your hand yes okay i can't see brother peter we'll be ministering wednesday night see what the lord gives us sunday morning maybe if he'll give me some brother lyle said he has something the following wednesday let's plan on a prayer meeting just continue to seek god's face he said if we'd ask he would answer and you know what asking demonstrates faith lord you said therefore i'll take you at your word the following sunday brother reggie vlad will be visiting with us coming and remember god watches over his children so god bless you as you go and and this week when you get up in the morning you feel strong my brother dana said you come home not feeling so strong he understands he understands remember he made a simple comment the foxes have dens and the birds have nest but the son of man doesn't have a place to lay down you know but also when he was walking with him to him as did not they say did not our heart burn within us when he talked he called them fools [Music] but their hearts burned sometimes lord call me a fool if you have to call me a fool but let my heart burn when you speak to me god bless you as you go oh he became me so that i might become him [Music] he became me so that i might become him [Music] he took my place [Music] my [Music] us [Music] yes i [Music] you first love me and i love
