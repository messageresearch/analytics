how old are you and she gave her age she was going on 35 years old and the minister said it's your change of life that you're going through and sometimes we look at ourselves and we say what's wrong with us what's going on in life why this and as he goes it's a change in time it's a change in your life said brother Ram talk about Seminary Cycles and it began to pray and minister and at the end of the Sunday service that young sister was just in a complete different atmosphere it was just wonderful to see God come and do that in the Simplicity of Truth and it's just sometimes you look at maybe

yesterday and as I said on the on the WhatsApp broadcast this morning that it was it was a tragic thing that happened um it was uh this man he's 37 years old he had had problems in his life and and it was pretty amazing that he had just gotten his life back together and he was really doing well and he really never in his whole life he really never had Direction he really he had never just had it together and he he had gotten his life together things were moving in the right direction and he was in Florida his grandmother was here in Tucson and he wanted to um surprise his grandmother for her 90th birthday and he set out and in Louisiana he was in a car wreck with a tractor-trailer and he died and um I did the funeral yesterday and then we had um the group over here in the fellowship hall and I know it meant a lot to them they didn't they didn't have a way to do it and for us to provide that for them I um I know that they appreciated and brother Jonathan when when you're ministering and you've done this many times in different places you can feel that there's some that they're real Christians and then you feel there's some that they're they're just kind of wishy-washy they claim to be Christians and then there's some that they don't want anything to do with it and yesterday was it was a difficult time brother Leo and I were there and it was um and then the special thanks also to brother Joe and Brother David and those that attended um it was hard to minister and there was people there that just didn't care they didn't really want to hear it and uh then there was some pure golden people also I got to tell you that uh her name is Rosalinda she's um with the for the Micah um Marriott I'll tell you what that young sister is precious what a sweetheart and she was telling me she says I just want I want my family and I want I want them to really accept the Lord Jesus and I just I mean she just impressed me so much and many of the family members did um and reaching out and helping these people I really appreciate the Tabernacle I really appreciate what we stand for sister Rachel was telling me she said that we've we've done this for the people a lot because we have she didn't say it exactly exactly this way but we have so much and we are able to share it with other people and I do appreciate that and I appreciate the attitude of the Tabernacle but I and in reaching out and always we're inviting people to church and and and the church is growing and we're seeing people really we're hearing great testimonies but let's not let's not forget each other let's not forget the people that are in this church that are these solid Warriors for Christ that love the Lord that are living the life let's not forget these people amen I am I just after last night I couldn't sleep last night I I was bothered but I'll tell you what gave me Comfort was thinking about the people that are solid they love the Lord and they're standing on this gospel really really really encouragement this Sunday brother Ellie easer and we've had him speak a couple times I just think the world of that young man so he's he's going to be preaching on Sunday morning I know that it's going to be a special blessing he's um he's special to me I've known him for a long time and I'm looking forward to it as much as you are to hear our brother speak and then in praying about it today I will probably preach on Sunday evening and I will probably preach on the second half of what I'm going to minister on tonight Acts chapter 20 but it'll probably be a little bit different because Acts chapter 20 the second half of it you really gotta preach it and not necessarily teach it there's a place for both you know there's you can run around and do jumping jacks in the pulpit and holler and yelling and that's and that's good and that that gets the blood going this way but don't forget there's also a Teaching Ministry we have to understand what we believe Jesus came he was a teacher John the Baptist came he was a preacher they they had different Ministries and different styles and let's not forget like tonight I'll be teaching on this book and let's not forget that we have to understand these things also to really receive the blessings from them I um like I said I was kind of down last night and Daniel my son he left this morning early I took him to the airport at I don't know like four o'clock this morning and he's going to a camp in um up at Cloverdale up in Washington a young people's camp and and he was excited and and he was giving me a testimony last night about he went to get a haircut and he was talking to the barber and uh this Barber just he just he was hurt and he's just he didn't know what to think he seemed to have a good attitude but he he just hurt and and Daniel was was talking to him and encouraging him and and just saying Hey Brother the Tabernacle things are happening why don't you come why don't you come visit and the the the barber said he says he says I will so we're looking forward to that and that that encouraged me that Daniel got to witness and encourage this man so Daniel calls me um like I said I dropped him off at like 4 30 or something this morning and as is almost always the case he calls me up and he says Dad my flight got delayed amen I and two more hours I could have slept so he uh and he said well I said well if you want me to come get you or whatever so he his flight he was going to go from Tucson to Las Vegas and then Las Vegas up to Washington to go to the camp well the engine wouldn't start on the plane in Tucson so they all had to de-board and as Daniel was waiting for the plane the first plane there was a young lady there about his age and uh they were you know in other parts of the the waiting room there in the lobby the place where they were going to board and they all got on the plane they're in totally different areas of the plane well then they all deplaned and they all got in line and they said okay well you're gonna go here and you're going to go to Dallas and you're going to go to Oakland and you're going to go over here and they'll flights to Las Vegas and so he goes over to this new gate and he sits down and there is that young lady and and she's sitting right here and they're both going to Oakland they're getting rerouted so they talk a little bit and she and Daniel has his backpack and she looks in his backpack and there's his Bible and she says is that a Bible and he says he says yeah he says he says it is and and they they start talking back and forth and she says I'm going to Hawaii right now and Daniel's like well I'm going to the youth camp and she says I'm going to Hawaii because we have a Ministry in Hawaii to cover all of the islands with Jesus Christ and this young lady she says she says we don't We Don't Preach any any Doctrine other than Jesus and Daniel says us too so they start talking back and forth and and it turns out she lives in Benson and she doesn't have a church that she goes to and she's going to be spending the next I don't know three or four months or whatever it is in Hawaii and she's going to be going to school there and but her main purpose is spreading the gospel there on the Hawaiian Islands so of course sister Lonnie I was thinking about you all and I was I was like oh man this is this is great but it was amazing to me that that they were on that plane nowhere near each other God stopped that engine it didn't let it start had him get off the plane and then go to a whole nother area and see each other meet each other put them both on the plane to together then they fly from from Tucson all the way to Oakland talking and and Daniel's I mean he says Dad I am so encouraged all we did was talk about the Lord and I thought praise God that my son 21 years old and this other young lady talking about Jesus Christ how many 21 year olds are talking about that amen sister Lonnie we got good kids no I don't feel good uh so I was just I was just feeding on that all day and uh just so proud and and made me think of this book this book of Acts that we're going to talk be talking about tonight they the same thing would happen they were just come into contact with another seed of God and when that water was poured on that seed it would Sprout and it would grow roots down deep so that when the winds would come it would it would go back and forth but those roots were deep and when that tree would move those roots would just go down deeper and then that tree would bear fruit and that fruit would go out and then that fruit would again it would Sprout roots and it would go out in it would bear fruit and then just on and on and on and I believe that is what is going to happen before the second coming of Christ I want to see this book of Acts become real I want to see it within us and and I think that we get a little taste of it every once in a while and I'm just blessed beyond measure to be able to open this book let's pray one more time Lord God father has opened my Bible it took me back a little bit know that that's your word pray Lord that your anointing would be upon this service father that your word would come forward in the same way that it was originally given may your Holy Spirit be present in Jesus name amen I am love this book I was reading it today and Daniel actually called me and he's like Dad chapter 20 is awesome he said isn't dead it's it's just he says it's incredible it's just great and I and I said I said well what part you like about it and he said the last part he goes oh man and I said yeah I don't think I'm going to get there tonight though but let me tell you you're going to like the first part I promise Acts chapter 20 verse 1. and after the Uproar was ceased Paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into Macedonia I remember that uproar in in chapter 19 that brother Lyle was talking about that's what the silversmiths and and Demetrius in the big Amphitheater and all that mess that happened and uh back in Acts 19 verse 21 Paul makes a statement that he wants to go to Rome but he says that first he needs to go to Jerusalem and these next it won't get to it today but uh these next chapter boy this is a deep thing that happens to Paul when he wants to go to Jerusalem and we see the influence of Godly holy spirit filled men on Paul and Paul has to make very very difficult decisions in fact he has to go against the whole church and make a decision but we'll get to that later this uh the next few verses they Chronicle Paul's trip through Macedonia to get ultimately to Jerusalem and when he had gone over those parts and given them much exhortation he came into Greece now the point on this one on this verse 2 I want to say that he says much exhortation Paul he preached a lot and we can see that his sermons many of them at least were not short in the least they were long and I know that that uh with me I'm usually fairly brief and I I don't like to wear the people out I've kind of made it made a commitment that that uh I want to keep the my sermons fairly short and then I want the people to remember what I say because I feel like if I say too much it I won't get my point across as good so I I keep it fairly fairly short but this Paul he didn't he would preach a long time and he had given them much exhortations he came to Greece and uh remember a couple chapters ago that he went to this modern Las Vegas you remember where it was do I have to stand here Corinth Corinth was a really bad place so he he went he went to this place in Greece and um in Athens was also I think I heard somebody say Athens so we have Athens and Corinth they're in Greece and there he Abode three months and when the Jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail to Syria he proposed to return through Macedonia now these three months that he was in Corinth right here before he heads back to Macedonia is generally considered the time that he wrote his letter to the Romans so that's probably when he penned This Book of Romans is when he was here in Corinth and he was writing to these folks but look at the resistance and it is common throughout this entire book of Acts look at the resistance it was almost always his own people it was almost always these legalistic Jews that they had their way of thinking and Paul came in and they thought he was off the word and they were always conspiring against him and here it is the same thing and there accompanied him into Asia sobetor of Berea now do you remember Berea Berea was that place where Paul came to preach and they didn't judge him they didn't judge his doctrines immediately but they studied the scriptures to find the answers and it looks like this guy's sopeter I think that's how you pronounce it that he was a convert I wonder why you know you hear people naming their kids Paul and Silas and that I wonder why you never hear a kid named sopeter I don't know um and of the Thessalonians aristarchus and secundus and Gaius of Derby and timotheus and of and of Asia tychicus and trophomas now there's some there's some high-powered people here with Paul right now he's he's got these preachers and these missionaries with him and um this like like Timothy and and and um tychicus and these ones that we read in other about in other books this was a missionary team that he had um with him but notice that there was one person that was missing in that list and that person was Luke these going before tarried for us at Trouse now these men they went before Paul and they were kind of maybe Paving the way for what Paul was going to do now Paul always had people with him in fact when he was when he was in prison or when he was in other places he would say hey hey come or send this person to me he he liked that fellowship and he he needed that help to do what he was doing and these missionary teams that we see here they're needed they're needed basically they're in the book of Acts and they're also needed now we think even like our little church here we have this Youth Camp this or this uh youth meeting that's coming up in August on August 26th we have got to have people in order to do things to set things in order like brother um brother Ed has got the hotels together we need to get some of the of the rooms done over here to get that ready we got to have the church ready we got to have people to park we have to have ushers everything has to be in order before we can have the meetings and these people that were with Paul were doing that type of thing same thing with our camp coming up we've got to have we've got to start assigning different jobs for people I've been working with brother Jeremy and sister Angela on on getting the the venue together we've got to have food and we've got to have activities we've got to have betting we've got to have all kinds of different things and we need a team to do it and that's what's going on right here is Paul has this team of brothers that are with him verse 6 says and we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them in Trouse in five days where we Abode seven days now brother Lyle is very very good at maps and he's good at putting in perspective where where these things are and these different places that these brothers are going so brother Lyle would you put those slides up and would you maybe give us a little explanation of these maps that you have this is interesting for me being at the back because now I can understand why when you sit in the back you can't see it that uh that big bold uh red arrow on the right is pointing to Ephesus and that's where Paul is leaving and he's following that Thin Red Line up the coast there the the green area of what is now turkey and is going to go across at the very top there to Philippi but meanwhile if you look at the Bold arrow on the left side that's pointing to Corinth and recall back from Acts 19 that Paul sent Timothy and erastus over to Corinth ahead of him and we believe he carried the second letter to the Corinthians on that trip and then they made their way up through Greece and Macedonian over to to meet Paul and then Paul is then going down through through Macedonia Philippi Berea thessalonica and so forth and down there to Corinth to meet these guys where he then spends three months and writes a letter to the Romans which that little piece of green sticking way over on the on the far left is a little bit of the boot of Italy and and of course the Rome is is off the map to the left now here we see that we've got a kind of a zoom in here of Corinth and and these we hear that these Jewish people were laying in weight so to go to Syria you'd want to follow that arrow to the right that's where we'd like to get on a boat and head for Syria but unfortunately we've got all these guys that have another idea Paul's eventually going to go to Rome where that arrow is in the upper left but instead what he decides to do is to walk or presumably he's going by land up to Macedonia so he's going to go the long way around to avoid those folks that are that are lying in weight and and there's probably two reasons that they're lying in weight of course one is that they don't much like Paul and the other is that Paul has taken a an offering for Jerusalem and he's taking it with him and he doesn't have it as a bank card he's carrying some cash so he's got uh you know he's got this team of guys with him and and they're missionaries but they might also be carrying weapons knows go ahead for the next map so here we see that they make their way up to where it circled at the top is Philippi and that's where Paul is spending um uh Passover with Lydia and the Jailer and all the folks that are meeting up up there and then from there after Passover it says it takes some five days and he goes down to Trojas where the arrow is the vertical Arrow to your uh to your right I recall that when he was going out on his second missionary journey from toast to Philippi it took him two days but now it takes him five days to come back it's a different time of year the wind is going in a different direction and that gets us there so now he's in uh in the province of Asia and he's a troess and I think that something's going to happen from our long-winded Paul could you uh brother Jeremy could you put up the the widest view yeah right there so if you look so brother Lyle where is Jerusalem Jerusalem would be roughly where your finger just was Jerusalem is is off the map and it's down about about where your hand is actually like right here yeah there you are yeah you're you've got your hand on the holy city now there's Jerusalem so we um we see that Paul as is that is that it brother Lyle do you have any more yes sir okay so we see that Paul um instead of going right down to Jerusalem Paul backtracks and he goes to all of these different places up in here and brother Lyle brought out a very good point that Paul was taking up an offering for the people in Jerusalem because there was a famine there was there was a hard time going on in Jerusalem and Paul was visiting all of these different churches and all of these different places not only ministering but also collecting and offering that they could give back to this this church this the big church the first church in Jerusalem so that's I believe that that is probably the reason that he went all round about this way was to do that now let me read verse 6 again very very important a little uh clue and we sailed from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to Trouse in five days where we Abode seven days now today in our society that we live in the world especially the United States that we live in there are these things they're a big point of contention and a big fight called pronouns he she they them and there's this there's this big fight either you want to identify as uh he or you want to identify as a she or you want to identify somewhere in between as a they and and it's it's it's a very odd thing but let me tell you something pronouns are very very important and they're important right here because the author of This Book of Acts wants to identify that he is with Paul and it says here and we sailed away from Philippi so now we know that this servant of the Lord Luke this doctor is on the scene and with the Apostle as they're traveling that's going to be very very important here in a few verses later so remember what did Paul do for a living I mean what did Luke do for a living he was a doctor this is going to come into play here in a few scriptures later and Again Luke as I said pronouns are important you know what what today back and forth whatever that is but here we see how important they are that this man Luke is identifying himself saying we sailed and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight the book of Acts is an application of scripture it's an application of Doctrine so why do these stories matter so much these these things you know it's going around and doing all these things we look that Luke slips in little nuggets here into the scripture that are very very doctrinal and if you didn't know it you would just read right over it says right here and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread this was a communion service and pretty much everything that you read they took communion they took the Lord's Supper most of the times that they came together so we looked they they took they took the bread on the first day of the week now we see how these doctrines of the Bible are applied in real life in the book of Acts in Galatians we see that this whole book of Galatians is really slamming against legalism and against being judgmental and that and we see that this book of Galatians it's applied over here in the book of Acts I believe it's chapter 15 when we see the two brothers coming from Jerusalem and they come down into galatia and to believe it's Antioch and they cause all kinds of a pro a problem saying hey you're not living according to Moses you're not doing things right you're not you're not eating these these these holy you're eating dirty types of animals you're not keeping the Sabbath you're not um pushing circumcision circumcision and then he writes this book of This Book of Galatians to address that but we see it right there in the book of Acts chapter 15. and the same thing in Acts 19. we see that them teaching and and believing the prophet John the Baptist we see his converts and how they didn't go far enough with John's with John's doctrines they stopped short of following Jesus and receiving the holy spirit in Acts 19. and they were bragging to Paul that they were converts but then Paul asked them if they had received the Holy Spirit since they believed like what the Holy Spirit we didn't know that there was any Holy Spirit and then was the first thing Paul says he says how were you baptized so we see the application of Matthew 28 19. go into all the world baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost we see Acts 2 38 baptizing them in the name of the Lord Jesus and we see it applied right here where Paul says hey you've got to be baptized right an application of a Doctrine in the book of Acts and then they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and we see how Luke the author of this book he throws in another nugget of Doctrine and that's this nugget that's this doctrine of the Sabbath so if the first day of the week is Sunday the last day of the week is the Sabbath is Saturday so why are they worshiping on the first day of the week rather than the last day of the week but it says right here in the book of Acts which is a a very fresh Church very fresh converts they're worshiping on Sunday and that's carried forth two thousand years a little we got to read it we got to know these little doctrines these doctrines are important and Luke is slipping them in here so if he died on the cross he was put on the cross on Friday all right we know that from the scriptures he died on the cross at three o'clock in the afternoon we know that because he died about the ninth hour of the day the day starts at six o'clock when the sun comes up nine hours later is three o'clock and he died there at that three o'clock now they took him off the cross because there was some sort of an agreement between the Romans and the Jews that you don't leave a man up on the cross on the Sabbath now it could have been I don't know if it was every Sabbath or I don't know if it was just a Passover holiday but that was an agreement so that's why they broke the legs of the other two male factors that were on the cross so they would die so they could get them down off the cross before the Sabbath and the Sabbath is on Saturday but do you know when the Sabbath starts starts on sundown on Friday so we see that that's the case he was in the grave for um Friday evening he was in the grave for Saturday for Saturday and then he rose the Bible is very plain that he rose on the first day of the week so we look and we see now that they're worshiping on this first day of the week but is that a Doctrine is that something that has to be let's turn to Romans chapter 14 quickly verse 5. Paul says this he says one man esteemeth one day above another esteemeth every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind when you worship this is a personal walk with the Lord brother told me the other day um he says you know he says he says I understand that the message isn't for everyone I said I didn't I didn't it was an email I didn't I didn't respond but I don't necessarily believe that and people say well that the Bible isn't for everyone I don't believe that either I believe it is for everyone I believe that it can be a blessing to everyone I believe that this book is a blessing if people would allow it to be a blessing to them for so to say that it isn't for everyone no no I believe that it is but the question is how you regard the message or the scriptures in the Bible that's the question and how you apply this to your own life there's the question and we look here and if anyone that ever lived was not wishy-washy on the way he believed it was the Apostle Paul he was dead set on his Doctrine and the way he believed so as I go to this next verse know that Paul isn't being wishy-washy here he's saying that you have to have a relationship with God so that you can take this these scriptures and you can apply it to your life verse number six says this he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord and he that regardeth not the day to the Lord he does not regard it he that Edith eateth to the Lord he that giveth God thanks and eateth not to to the Lord he eateth not and giveth thanks so Paul says he's saying here and even Peter says sometimes Paul's writings are a little hard to understand Peter said I'm just quoting him but what what Paul is saying is that this man that's fasting he's doing it for the Lord this man that is eating over here he's doing it to gather strength so that he can serve the Lord so both are equally serving the lord here if they are right with God and if they have that that that relationship with God for none of us live none of us liveth to himself and no man diet to himself for what whether we live we live under the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords so as I said we should have that relationship with Christ so that the reason I am doing this the reason I am living my life like I'm doing is because I'm serving God and Paul trusted that in the people some of them worshiped on Saturday Paul trusted it he says you keeping the days and all that no no no however the Lord's leading you I believe it's Hebrews chapter four I believe he talks about the Sabbath and he says this sabbath is the day of rest but it's not a day that you have to observe every day should be observed so here's Paul and he's he's talking about the Sabbath and he's he's saying that some people keep it on Saturday some people on Sunday but whatever you're doing make sure you are pleasing the Lord and doing so make sure you have that relationship with brother Jonathan and I we're praying and we're living our lives in a certain way and brother Jonathan wants to live his life differently than me I trust brother Jonathan I know he's a man of God and if somebody comes to me and said brother Jonathan is wrong in wanting to worship on Saturday I know brother Jonathan I know that man prays I know that man has a relationship with the Lord don't put him down trust that the holy spirit is living within brother Jonathan and the same for me let's go back to Acts 20. it's uh we'll read I'll read verse 7 again so we get back on the same and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached unto him unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight again this is a communion service and from what we know these Services always included breaking bread and remember from verse 2 I believe it was yeah that Paul had much exhortation brother Leo he preached long services and I'm gonna read about one of those long Services right now and let me let me give you a warning here um it's my job to warn you and some of you are guilty of this infraction that I'm about to read about and I've seen you do it and there were many lights in the upper chamber and they were gathered together and they're sat in the window a certain man named eudicus being fallen into a deep sleep and as Paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and he fell down from the third Loft and was taken up dead don't fall asleep in church let that be a lesson make sure you remember more in my sermon than just that okay [Laughter] so this young man uticus and and from the from the translations from the original Greek when it when it says this young man he's probably between 10 and 12 years old maybe between 8 and 14 but he was about that age and he had fallen from the Third story and he probably I always thought well he probably fell down uh you know into the congregation but he probably didn't it was he probably fell backwards and fell out into the street maybe and I mean it's black he's he's dead and and he's laying there now remember who is on the scene Luke is on the scene and that's going to come back here in just a minute ah I feel the Lord and Paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourselves for his life is in it and when he therefore was come up again he had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he Departed and they brought the young man alive and we're not a little comforted so Paul so this young man falls down Luke right here in the scripture pronounces him dead and then Paul comes up and laid down upon the young man you remember Elijah laying down on the child and the brother Branham had done that too there's there's something about that he laid down on the child and I believe it was Elisha it was Elisha and the shunami woman and Elisha laid down on top of the child and and his mouth was to his mouth and life came back in this child and we see Paul he went down and he laid he fell down upon this child and embracing him said trouble not yourselves for his life is in him thinking about how much seeing that all of these people that were there late at night and they see this young man fall to his death and he was obviously dead and here comes a doctor and this doctor pronounces him dead and then Paul this great man brother Leo comes down and lays down upon this young man and he is raised up from the dead what a testimony what an incredible thing that happened and then Paul he goes and he stays up all night and he breaks bread again and they're talking about the Lord all night and he wants to just I can see Paul I can feel how he was he loved the people and he just he wanted as much time as he could spend with him he wanted to do it so all night long he didn't go to bed they just talked about the Lord imagine brother Joel rejoicing over what had just happened and talking about that and there's and there's Paul and then finally he asked he has to leave they wake up the next morning and or they didn't wake up they talked all night and they must have been talking about this child being Resurrected wouldn't you have loved to see something like that it was documented by this man Luke a few years ago I was in service in Jeffersonville and there was a man that died in service he was about maybe for me to brother Aaron from me and I looked down the aisle and I saw a commotion I looked down the aisle and there was this man and his his face was white his mouth was open he had drooled on his chest his eyes were open and there was my brother who was a paramedic and a doctor checking his pulse and let me tell you friends it is the one of I must say it is one of the most documented Miracles that have ever happened and it happened in our day and I was there to see it we read the book of Acts about Luke would you like to see the testimony of this what happened here brother Jeremy do you have it it's about we'll close after that it's about 10 minutes or so this is Brother Isaac toy right here I took this video that evening so so this is right after it happened I promise their sound sister Campbell tapped me on the shoulder when we had sat down for uh right when we were gonna do the offering and she uh motioned for me over to him and then she said can you get brother John Wall because he was standing two rows in front of me with the offering and I tapped him on the arm to get him and then I motioned back and showed him and I don't remember I think he went up either to get Brother Joseph or to get some I think he was going up to your brother Joseph and he um I knelt down when I knelt down and looked up had uh at the brother he was the brother James his little James brother James his eyes were open we're open his eyes were back but they were just just set straight ahead and his mouth was open his head was down like this and his you could just see Bubbles and saliva and mucus just coming out kin he was just completely still like that and I just I put my hand on his shoulder and started praying and then I could feel the brothers coming up also and started praying that could hear Brother Joseph praying and then um as he was praying you could he said he could feel his heartbeat coming back not long ago Rita Levy commercial celebrated her 103rd and then we picked him up and brought him outside and by the time we got him outside he was still his eyes were he was moving him at that point and he was and another brother had his head lifted up brother Matt who said I mean he checked for a pulse for their Adam check for a pulse um and they couldn't find anything and then brother Joseph said when he first put his hand on him he said he and then when he started praying he could feel that pole starting to come back and then we carried him out and by the time we got him outside he was he was already doing better he was starting to close his eyes open his eyes he still wasn't really coherent but then he started brother Adam asked him how old he was and instead of answering he just raised up his hand so we knew we knew he was still doing good when he was doing good when you first noticed him how long do you think he had been like that when we sat down when we sat down for uh just in the pre-service I thought he had fallen asleep because I could hear twice I heard him make a sound almost like I don't know if he was snoring but I could hear just almost like a snort sound it sounded like a snore but it just happened two times just kind of a kind of a drawn out kind of not drawn out but just kind of a snore sound and I had thought he had fallen asleep but um my mom said she noticed when we were standing up singing that he was massaged over and that he wasn't standing up with us so we sang for at least what five or ten minutes had to have been and he was sitting down he never stood up which means he had to have been at least out while we were up singing before we stood up so when he was when we stood up he never even stood up so he was he could have been gone then so it wasn't a matter of seconds it was a matter of minutes matter of minutes maybe five minutes I mean we sang for we sang for a long time so and it was I mean we've sang he prayed did the Prairie Quest and all that and then so it was it was a long while I'm brother Matthew golden from Owensboro Kentucky I'm a practicing general surgeon at the hospital there I was actually sitting in the row in front of brother James this morning brother Isaac Toy's wife came and got me shortly after we realized that he wasn't breathing I turned around got directly out of my seat went to him he was slumped over in his chair I checked his pulse checked his respirations he had no carotid faults on his neck had no respirations at all I wasn't protecting his Airway at all I immediately went to the front of the congregation and waved to the platform to get some help went back to assist brother James I actually had my hands on his Carotid pulse and I lifted up his Airway trying to open his Airway he had no gag reflex or anything when I squeezed his neck no signs of life at all he was cold and pale we immediately went into prayer brother Adam came shortly after that and got down in front and checked it karate all right radial pulse this is Brother Adam brother Adam Evans and I work for voice of God I've worked there for about eight years but before that I was in the fire service and I was a paramedic for 10 years out of about 13 years in the fire service it doesn't take much helping the ASPCA give an animal a need the care safety meal one of the deacons had got my attention and said they need some help over here and when I got to brother James brother Matt was behind him holding his head up with his hand on his neck checking a pulse and so I did the same thing on the other side of his neck checked a pulse on that side I didn't find anything checked a radio pulse and didn't find anything it was it was clear that just had no signs of life he was very cool sweaty just had some mucus coming out of his mouth and very clear that he had passed at that point so we just continue to pray I don't know how long it was you know in your in your thinking as a human you think well you need to start CPR and something told me just to pray and at that time some of the other brothers came and Brother Joseph came and he came down in front of brother James and I I was I was praying and and we don't know I don't know the time frame of how it happened how long it took or what happened but as we were praying I felt him kind of gag and kind of taken a deep breath and you felt the breath kind of come back in him I didn't feel a pulse of that second I felt the breath first brother Adam felt at the same time and looked up at me and said he's breathing kind of asking me you know is he breathing and I said yeah he's breathing and we felt it at the same time I kept my hands on his pulse and I felt a pulse slowly actually come back at that point you could cut a feeling kind of try to catch his head trying to get strength back to him at that time we took him out of the service carried him around by the time we got him outside he kind of had a little a little bit more signs of life to him by the time we got around the front of the building he was he was nodding slowly kind of incoherently speaking to us and then he started speaking to us and slowly woke up from there got stronger and stronger I started praising the Lord every time we'd ask him his age he'd praise the Lord and then when the ambulance got there um I told them what had happened and I actually wrote in the ambulance with him to the hospital when I got in the ambulance I kind of explained to him the situation and I told him I said God just raise this man from the dead and they put on an EKG leads and ran a 12 lead EKG and actually myself got to look at it it was completely normal for his age there was no major heart attack or changes on the on the EKG no funny heart rhythms or anything um his oxygen level was a hundred percent he had trouble checking it because he kept wanting to praise the Lord the whole time there and the last thing he remembered was Brother Joseph coming out and tell him we prayed for your brother you're going to be all right and we wrote him in the ambulance and he just was praising the Lord the whole way there we got to the to the emergency room and by then he was kind of already laughing and already praising the Lord and happy the only thing in the emergency room that we found I was there through the whole thing they let me come back with him to the CT scanner and I saw his EKG there in the emergency room his his Labs were normal his heart enzymes were normal he didn't have a major heart attack his head CT was normal so he didn't have a major stroke or anything to explain it everything was normal except for his temperature his body temperature was about 94 degrees we didn't believe it at first because he was awake talking to us so much and he looked so well but after checking it again it was about 94. I don't know what that means all I can say that it means he must have been dead for a while to actually get a body temperature that low and after we got to the emergency room he warmed up and came up to normal before I left hey there if you're a homeowner and you have a power meter like this on the side of your home from from my perspective when I after me and Matt had kind of first touched base and realized that he didn't have a pulse I started unbuttoning the brother's shirt and I had it in my mind that this person had passed on but I just kind of knew that the Lord was going to do something and I wanted to make sure that I could say positively that he had passed away at that point I unbuttoned his shirt I put my hand on his chest just to make sure I couldn't feel anything any respirations or any heartbeat or anything and as I was doing that I may have been there for I don't felt like a while but it's probably 30 seconds to a minute whether Joseph had come up and brother Joseph's hand I felt it underneath my hand and shortly thereafter I felt the brother's chest just rise a little bit and that's I was pretty sure I felt him breathe that's when I stood up and got in first in the brother's face and I was feeling by his cheek to see if he was breathing at all and I felt a little something and that's when I looked at Matt and I said he's breathing and Matt says I know and uh I kind of squatted back down I looked at Brother Joseph and said he's breathing and Brother Joseph just stared at me for a second looked very intent and I said you want us to get him out of here and get him going instead yeah and so we put him in his chair and we got him out and we heard the rest of the story from Matt uh both you Brothers brother Adam you first in your expert opinion and all of your experience what do you think happened to this brother as far as physically while in service some of the people around him were saying that before anybody was really alarmed uh that he was just sitting there with his head down and he made a couple uh snoring type sounds and they weren't sure if he was asleep or what but there is a like a snoring respiration for a dying person it's pretty common when somebody's dying could have very well been the case and I think he may have been deceased for quite a while a number of minutes before somebody actually noticed when they noticed by the time we all got there I mean it was just clear he was pale white he was sweaty very cool no signs of life at all his eyes were fixed not responding to anything obviously no respirations absolutely no pulse I checked every way I knew how to check to see if he had a pulse just because I felt that the Lord was going to do something and I wanted to be sure that I knew that he wasn't just passed out or fainted he was he was definitely deceased I've seen a lot of people who are have been dying and people who are deceased in my previous career and I mean it was clear he was it was not a not living at that point hey Matthew how about your your pain I feel the same way I I can't explain what happened um to me you know as as much as you you see in the medical field and I see it you know at least every month or so you're you're there when somebody passes or you have a wreck come in that somebody passes and your hands on their pulse when they pass he was cold and like we said he was obviously had no signs of life that I could tell um the only thing in my mind that can explain it is his heart must have went into a funny Rhythm or something during the service and and he died for a number of minutes usually when you don't refuse for a few minutes you can tell when you come up to a patient and it definitely looked to me the best that I can say that he had been gone for a few minutes brother Matthew are you the one when someone comes in and they're deceased are you the one that would give them a death certificate or what you would say that I would say I would have to um and that's it's it's up to the doctor that's there and I'm I'm certified to run codes in the hospital when somebody passes in the hospital to try and bring them back in CPR and advanced Trauma Life Support too so I would be the one that would declare somebody dead on a death certificate that would be something I'd have to fill out so you're pretty sure he was dead that's if he was in the hospital we would have already called the Mormon yeah so how about you um a typical scenario would be that us as paramedics would be working on the patient doing the you know Advanced cardiac life support and actually doing the work while a physician like Matt would be more or less calling out the orders calling out the drug dosages and the one making the decisions on when to say this person this past when to keep trying want to try to defibrillate when to when to do that and we're kind of the the hands for the doctors who are usually doing that and that's typical scenario once in the hospital in the field um you know obviously we don't have a doctor there and so we do we have you know standing orders that we work under a physician's license and uh then we usually call up the hospital talk to a doctor like Matt and get advice on whether to pronounce the person dead on the scene or to take him into the hospital situation like this we would have you know done CPR in the patient put them on an EKG if it merited it we're going to try to defibrillate try to bring it back with with medicine which a lot of times some drugs will get a heartbeat back but it's just caused by the medicine this in this scenario we didn't do anything except for prey we didn't do CPR we didn't try to give any sort of respirations we just laid our hands on them I was you know very busy trying to find a pulse trying to find some sort of sign of life with the brother and it just wasn't there but then when we we both felt that respiration at the same time I think we neither one of us was really surprised I think I would have been surprised if if we didn't feel it at that point is I don't think the Lord would allow that in this church So Adam you were you're sure he was gone I'm positive well Matthew you're sure he was gone see my name is uh brother James E Jackson from Jeffersonville Indiana went to church Sunday morning and about like always do about the same time early get up there and get buy me a seat and sit there and listen to the gospel singing of the brother Branham and everything you know and then I sat down and listened more singing everything and as I sit there and got time for the meeting to start and everything and I remember kind of set down my head and bowed down and stuff and and uh I don't know what I was doing on that and I just the next thing I know when I woke up I was on my way from the ambulance to go to the hospital and everything Brother Joseph said the Lord is him heal me and everything brought me back to life so we got to give the Lord's cream for Dad like in the Lord I learned that long time ago very good thank the Lord to put me into this wonderful message the only message that it ever was thank you Lord amen amen I was there musicians have come I was there and we had a modern day Luke that was there also that was an absolute miracle of God just like this young man uticus in the Bible we see that this book of Acts this Jesus Christ is the same today as he ever was when I looked down I looked down that aisle and there was that man he was he was dead he was he was so dead that I turned to my wife and I said he's dead and I turned to a minister behind me brother Trevor Eamon and I said he's dead and I knew friends I can stand before the Lord I knew he was going to come back to life I knew it and it was witnessed by about 800 people right there and they saw it and the Lord just provided he provided a modern day Luke he provided my brother Adam said he got down on his knees and he put his hands on his chest and something told him make sure he is dead because this is going to be a testimony and that man was dead brother James lives today and he's [Applause] if you've uh I don't know if you take the tour of Tucson you you know about the Evans service station that goes way back brother James used to hang out at that service station in the 1960s and fellowship with the Brethren he's been around that long and he stands today as a witness to
