[43:25] is not one that says look who I am and
[43:27] you can't be like me no rather he gives
[43:30] of himself
[43:31] and it's just wonderful to know a living
[43:34] God so
[43:35] I do have some requests some to bring to
[43:38] your attention
[43:39] and some announcements before brother
[43:41] Dan
[43:42] comes up to minister this this morning
[43:44] but
[43:45] brother Merle Baggett is going to be
[43:46] going into surgery next week for
[43:49] for some work on his knees so let's
[43:51] remember him
[43:52] on that
[43:54] and I appreciate the doctors can do what
[43:57] they can do
[43:59] and but all healing is of God so
[44:03] and then I had heard that brother Dale
[44:05] Smith
[44:06] the brother pastors the church up in
[44:08] Flagstaff
[44:10] was to have heart surgery
[44:12] so I called him this morning and on
[44:14] December 8th brother Dale is going to
[44:16] have open heart surgery
[44:17] [Music]
[44:18] um
[44:19] they had had some some physical problems
[44:22] and when he went in for
[44:23] a thing they found an aneurysm and they
[44:25] found blockages
[44:27] and the doctor told him if they didn't
[44:29] do something soon he may not be around
[44:31] much longer so he he sounded good on the
[44:34] phone didn't sound depressed or anything
[44:36] like that but he said he would
[44:39] appreciate it prayers for our brother
[44:40] Dale Smith so
[44:43] and then our our brother brother Dan
[44:45] asked me he said if we would remember a
[44:48] sister Gina
[44:50] who is in a very dark place and
[44:53] I shared a testimony we heard yesterday
[44:55] with brother Dan and he had heard it
[44:57] also
[44:58] I believe it was a pastor's daughter
[45:01] yesterday when we were up at the
[45:03] ministers meeting
[45:05] and his daughter had gotten into a very
[45:08] dark place
[45:09] and she said I'm going away I'm leaving
[45:11] all of this I'm just gonna go away
[45:14] and he said I put myself into prayer
[45:17] and she came back one day not too long
[45:19] and says Daddy no I'm not going
[45:21] I'm gonna stay here
[45:23] and I'm gonna let God bring me through
[45:25] this so we have a god that is more than
[45:28] able to do those things and brother Dan
[45:30] also mentioned it had a a praise for our
[45:33] sister Olivia
[45:35] a seven-year-old with a with a kidney
[45:37] promise and he had asked prayer for them
[45:39] and she's doing much better so
[45:41] I know a god that is able do you know
[45:43] that God Amen let's stand
[45:47] you have a need
[45:48] [Music]
[45:49] you know I I've lifted up my hands a
[45:52] hundred times Lord but you're still the
[45:53] same yesterday today and for
[45:55] Lord we thank you that that we have a
[45:58] living God
[46:00] not a far away up there uh
[46:03] that we have to get permission make
[46:05] appointments to go in and see you like a
[46:07] a doctor what we would do today Lord
[46:10] but you said come unto me
[46:13] and I will give you rest Lord and in
[46:15] every part of that rest Lord there's
[46:18] healing there's peace there's joy that
[46:20] is everything that we have need of Lord
[46:23] this this this sister in a dark place
[46:26] Lord
[46:27] oh how Satan would get in and make a
[46:30] mess out of someone's life Lord
[46:33] try to turn off all the light and make
[46:35] it in a place that would just be so
[46:37] horrible Lord
[46:39] but you can be touched by the feelings
[46:41] of her infirmities the things she's
[46:43] going through Lord
[46:45] and I know you can do this Lord because
[46:47] I've heard testimony of those who said
[46:49] there's there's a flicker of Hope
[46:51] suddenly
[46:53] and it begins to grow Lord for this this

[47:47] a Brethren there and have a good time
[47:50] and then they broke there's a break for
[47:52] for lunch
[47:54] and the the young people that were here
[47:56] a few weeks back with brother rivet on a
[47:59] Sunday it's his church
[48:01] and each one of them was wearing a vest
[48:03] outside to park all the cars because it
[48:06] was a small parking lot
[48:08] and then each one of them became servers
[48:10] and helpers and they each one had a
[48:13] table what would you like to have steak
[48:15] or salmon or there was another plate
[48:18] everything prepared I said brother this
[48:21] is going to be hard to beat
[48:22] for the next meeting but we were treated
[48:24] so kindly by the folks and it was so
[48:27] nice
[48:28] but but to hear the minister speaking
[48:31] also
[48:32] in in the topic was complexes
[48:36] and I told Brother Steve I got a complex
[48:38] thinking about I was going to minister
[48:40] on complexes
[48:43] we all have complexes we all have issues
[48:45] in life
[48:46] but to know that your brother is going
[48:48] through the same thing
[48:50] and God has helped him through it and he
[48:53] then encourages you

[52:04] when the reactions of the people is
[52:06] there's amens they're they're smiles
[52:08] there's there's acknowledgment it helps
[52:10] the minister
[52:12] when the people sit stone-faced the
[52:14] minister begins to think it's his
[52:16] problem
[52:17] you know and it might be not saying that
[52:19] I haven't caused that at times
[52:21] but it sure is nice to to to see the

[53:53] amen greetings to every one of you in
[53:56] the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[53:58] Christ I love to see the church pray we
[54:01] bring the prayer request before the
[54:03] church there is a story in the book of
[54:05] Acts where Peter was in prison
[54:08] and the church
[54:10] prayed without ceasing for our brother
[54:14] and then one night the church was all
[54:17] together they're all worried about
[54:18] things and Peter is released from prison
[54:22] a angel came and brought him out and
[54:25] brought him to the door and he knocked
[54:27] on the door
[54:29] and this little sister opened the door
[54:32] and then she she slammed it because she
[54:34] didn't expect that to be Peter she said
[54:36] it must be his ghost or something
[54:38] she didn't expect the prayer to be
[54:40] answered but when we pray we expect our
[54:43] prayers to be answered amen I want to
[54:45] keep you standing for just a second
[54:46] let's turn to James
[54:49] chapter 4.
[54:51] thank you sisters
[54:58] it reads like this James chapter 4 verse
[55:01] 14 it says this whereas ye know not
[55:05] what shall be on the morrow
[55:07] for what is your life it is even a vapor
[55:10] that appears for a little time
[55:12] and then vanisheth away
[55:15] let's bow our heads Lord once again we
[55:17] pray to you
[55:19] and father asked that you would add the
[55:21] blessings to this scripture and Lord
[55:24] that you would be welcome in this
[55:26] congregation this morning in Jesus name
[55:28] amen you can take your seats
[55:37] I read the scripture
[55:39] um I ministered about a week and a half
[55:42] ago
[55:43] and I I ministered on
[55:45] on the scripture I didn't have a chance
[55:48] to finish my sermon and I I preached on
[55:52] Absalom which is I want to talk a little
[55:54] bit about Absalom this morning
[55:56] and then I went on and then on Wednesday
[55:58] night
[55:59] the time started ticking and I ran out
[56:02] of time so I stopped my sermon see when
[56:05] I preach friends it is the message of
[56:07] the hour it's not the message of the two
[56:10] hours
[56:11] or the three hours I try to keep it
[56:14] within an hour because
[56:16] I want you to enjoy it and I want you to
[56:18] remember what I say
[56:20] this um this scripture
[56:23] in James he's writing whereas you know
[56:25] not what shall be on the morrow for what
[56:28] is your life it is even but a vapor that
[56:31] appears for a little time and then
[56:32] vanishes away
[56:34] and I I've been
[56:37] praying on that scripture for weeks now
[56:40] and um when I was living back in Indiana
[56:43] often in the morning there would be a
[56:46] fog as just as the Sun would rise there
[56:49] would be a fog that would lay down in
[56:51] the low areas
[56:53] and then as the sun would come up
[56:57] the fog would just quickly disappear
[57:01] and it's strange you look at it it's
[57:03] just here and then it's gone and then
[57:05] there's no trace of it whatsoever
[57:08] and I think about us and I think about
[57:11] our lives
[57:12] and I think about how many of us raise
[57:15] your hand how many of us
[57:17] know or new are great grandparents
[57:23] say half of the congregation
[57:27] then how many of us know or knew about
[57:30] our great great grandparents
[57:35] Steve and Sister Sarah brother Aaron
[57:37] maybe a few more very few
[57:41] that's just a couple Generations
[57:43] and our lives are completely gone we
[57:45] don't even have a memory
[57:47] of ourselves
[57:49] some of
[57:50] some of the families really make a mark
[57:53] on History we see this book right here
[57:57] is is full of of those people but there
[58:00] are very few people outside of this book
[58:02] I see brother Steve there brother
[58:04] Steve's last name is Hickerson
[58:06] and I was I was um
[58:10] um I see this guy out outside he was
[58:12] doing some Plumbing work and and uh
[58:15] I went out and and talked to him and
[58:18] just briefly didn't know who he was and
[58:21] then I came back and my wife called her
[58:23] somebody and I said I said no I'm I'm
[58:25] witnessing to the plumber
[58:27] and they just Plummer out there and then
[58:30] it ends up when I finally meet him this
[58:31] plumber ends up witnessing to me
[58:34] brother Steve his dad
[58:37] is brother Holland Hickerson
[58:39] many of you know brother Hickerson AKA
[58:42] hick he uh he was a deacon at the
[58:46] Branham Tabernacle for many years and
[58:48] Deacon in the 60s
[58:50] moved out here he was best friends with
[58:53] my grandfather brother wheeler who was
[58:56] also a deacon let me tell a little story
[58:58] about brother hick and brother wheeler
[59:00] so there was there's this famous uh
[59:02] series of sermons preached in the 60s
[59:04] that brother Brandon preached
[59:07] um where he preached marriage and
[59:08] divorce and who is this Melchizedek and
[59:11] and a couple other sermons and they had
[59:13] they had meetings in this Middle School
[59:16] Parkview I think is the name of the
[59:17] middle school is that right Parkview
[59:19] Middle School it is out of middle school
[59:21] so everybody there's thousands of people
[59:26] lined up outside to get in the doors so
[59:29] the deacons but the hick and and brother
[59:31] wheeler and the other ones they have the
[59:33] doors closed and everybody's lined up
[59:35] and finally it's time to let the people
[59:39] in they open the door and it was like a
[59:42] flood of people coming in and it was
[59:46] brother Jerry it was like ASU Arizona
[59:48] basketball game man there was elbows
[59:50] being thrown and and pushing and and
[59:53] going in and they'll get their seats
[59:54] they all want to be in the front row to
[59:56] to hear what's what's on the prophet's
[59:58] mind and they're all excited and
[1:00:01] it wasn't they weren't acting like
[1:00:04] Christians
[1:00:05] so my grandpa brother hick
[1:00:08] they rounded all the people back up and
[1:00:12] said get out
[1:00:15] and come in like a Christian
[1:00:18] so so they brought everybody out then
[1:00:21] they brought them in and have had them
[1:00:22] act like Christians so
[1:00:25] I I appreciate those those old stories
[1:00:28] you know I'm sure brother Steve you
[1:00:30] could just go on and on and on telling
[1:00:32] the stories about about the old times
[1:00:35] but now we live in these times
[1:00:38] and uh I think about
[1:00:42] all of our families
[1:00:44] and I think about just a couple
[1:00:46] generations and we have no idea where we
[1:00:48] came from
[1:00:50] you know we can do some genealogy stuff
[1:00:52] I guess and say oh I was related to this
[1:00:54] person or that person this famous person
[1:00:56] that may have made a mark on history
[1:00:58] but what mark
[1:01:00] when we leave this world
[1:01:03] in this short little time that we have
[1:01:05] what Mark will we leave
[1:01:09] and um
[1:01:11] like I said I I preached on this a
[1:01:14] couple weeks ago on a Wednesday night
[1:01:16] and I'd like to start there and that's
[1:01:18] about this man named Absalom now Absalom
[1:01:23] was the third son of King David
[1:01:27] Absalom was he was a fine looking young
[1:01:30] man very charismatic had a whole lot
[1:01:32] going for him in life
[1:01:35] so Absalom what had happened was
[1:01:38] Absalom
[1:01:40] had a sister
[1:01:42] and uh now David obviously had a lot of
[1:01:45] wives so they all had the same father
[1:01:47] but they they had different mothers so
[1:01:49] Absalom had a sister and
[1:01:52] um one of absalom's Brothers
[1:01:55] committed
[1:01:57] um a trespass against absalom's sister
[1:02:00] really bad
[1:02:02] um it upset Absalom
[1:02:04] so after
[1:02:06] um and Absalom never forgot about it
[1:02:08] after a couple years
[1:02:10] Absalom took the law into his old hand
[1:02:12] in his own hands and he ordered his
[1:02:16] servants to kill
[1:02:18] his brother
[1:02:20] and it of course
[1:02:22] really hurt David the father
[1:02:26] so it ends up Absalom is told to leave
[1:02:29] the kingdom
[1:02:31] and after a while David's loyal servant
[1:02:35] General named joab he sees that David
[1:02:39] would really like to have his son back
[1:02:42] so AB so um joab makes a way
[1:02:47] for this Absalom to come back
[1:02:51] and be reunited in in the area there of
[1:02:55] the city of David
[1:02:56] so
[1:02:57] he comes back and then Absalom
[1:03:00] who is a very ambitious young man
[1:03:03] and is all about
[1:03:06] himself
[1:03:08] Absalom was a man that was full of
[1:03:12] himself
[1:03:13] and that's the title of my sermon today
[1:03:16] is it's not about you
[1:03:19] so Absalom
[1:03:21] he starts he has he develops this plan
[1:03:23] in his mind and he starts waiting at the
[1:03:27] gates of the city for when the people
[1:03:29] come in to see the king and obviously
[1:03:32] the king doesn't have time to visit all
[1:03:34] these people so Absalom says hey let me
[1:03:36] judge this
[1:03:37] and everybody knew Absalom he was the
[1:03:40] son of David
[1:03:41] so he had respect among the people so he
[1:03:44] started winning the respect
[1:03:46] among the people and Absalom started
[1:03:49] using this for his own selfish ambitions
[1:03:52] now as I said before Absalom ended up
[1:03:56] being just a spoiled brat and no more
[1:04:00] so
[1:04:01] he's starting to get the support of the
[1:04:03] people so finally Absalom sees that he
[1:04:06] has an opportunity to take the throne
[1:04:09] now Absalom like I said he was a very
[1:04:12] charismatic very capable young man he
[1:04:15] may have ascended to the throne anyways
[1:04:17] but he ends up he's going to take it
[1:04:21] so David
[1:04:23] sees that more people
[1:04:26] are with Absalom
[1:04:28] than with him
[1:04:30] so David
[1:04:32] everyone is weeping and it was just an
[1:04:34] awful time
[1:04:36] in Jerusalem
[1:04:38] so David
[1:04:39] takes his men
[1:04:42] and he leaves the city
[1:04:44] one thing that David did
[1:04:47] that I thought
[1:04:48] was just just precious
[1:04:52] is there's a a
[1:04:55] priest named zadok
[1:04:59] zadok obviously was a wise man a very
[1:05:01] very good man he has all the Levites get
[1:05:04] together they pick up the Ark of the
[1:05:06] Covenant and they start walking out the
[1:05:09] city out of the city with David
[1:05:12] and David stops them and says no
[1:05:14] he says
[1:05:16] leave the ark here
[1:05:19] here this is where the ark should be
[1:05:21] look at the humility in David
[1:05:23] he says is God's with me
[1:05:27] he says then I'll be back
[1:05:30] he said but this Ark needs to stay here
[1:05:32] remember that Arc wherever that Ark went
[1:05:34] that battle was won
[1:05:36] it went before the people and David in
[1:05:40] his humility and in the sweetness of the
[1:05:43] spirit of Jesus Christ said no leave it
[1:05:46] here in the city if it's meant to be
[1:05:49] it's meant to be
[1:05:50] I'll be back if the Lord wants but he
[1:05:54] didn't know
[1:05:55] so David ends up going out
[1:05:58] Absalom takes control of the city there
[1:06:02] ends up being a war between David and
[1:06:05] Absalom
[1:06:07] and David being the great leader that he
[1:06:10] was
[1:06:11] wins this war
[1:06:14] and it ended up with 20
[1:06:17] 000 people dying
[1:06:20] an awful awful thing because this young
[1:06:23] man Absalom rose up and came against the
[1:06:26] rightful King
[1:06:27] and just brought destruction I don't
[1:06:31] even know if
[1:06:33] I can't really even tell these 20 000
[1:06:35] people that died which side they were on
[1:06:39] but they died
[1:06:40] Jews anoint uh chosen people
[1:06:44] they died because of this man Absalom
[1:06:48] and then but before Absalom died
[1:06:51] let me read this let me read this
[1:06:52] scripture
[1:06:54] um
[1:06:57] before Absalom died in second Samuel
[1:06:59] Verse 18
[1:07:02] I'm sorry chapter 18 verse 18.
[1:07:06] it says this
[1:07:07] now Absalom in his lifetime had taken
[1:07:10] and reared up for himself a pillar which
[1:07:14] is in the Kingsdale for he said I have
[1:07:16] no son to keep my name in remembrance
[1:07:18] and he called the pillar after his own
[1:07:20] name and it is called unto this day
[1:07:23] absalom's place
[1:07:26] now
[1:07:28] brother uh
[1:07:29] who is that back there brother Peter and
[1:07:31] Brother Joseph
[1:07:32] if you could put up that picture I
[1:07:34] showed this the other day
[1:07:36] there's a place in Jerusalem called
[1:07:40] absalom's Place absalom's pillar
[1:07:42] absalom's tomb and that's what you see
[1:07:45] up on the screen
[1:07:46] now if you do the research that when
[1:07:49] they first found it they thought that
[1:07:51] this must be absalom's tomb it's
[1:07:53] actually probably not it was probably
[1:07:54] built many years later but it represents
[1:07:57] this pillar that this man Absalom reared
[1:08:01] up for himself
[1:08:03] so that he would I have a legacy
[1:08:06] and it's the most disrespected place
[1:08:09] that I found when I was in Israel
[1:08:13] I went there and I
[1:08:15] I saw I saw this beautiful Monument
[1:08:18] which is just outside of the gates in
[1:08:19] the in the Kidron Valley
[1:08:21] and and I saw this beautiful place I
[1:08:23] wanted to go see what it was so I go
[1:08:25] down there and there's trash
[1:08:28] around it smelled bad
[1:08:31] it was a place of disrespect the only
[1:08:34] place that I saw actually in the whole
[1:08:35] time I was in Israel
[1:08:38] and I thought what is this and then I
[1:08:40] look at the sign and it says absalom's
[1:08:43] tomb
[1:08:45] so I did some research about it and
[1:08:48] Through the Years
[1:08:50] mothers and fathers would bring their
[1:08:54] children
[1:08:55] to this place and they would throw rocks
[1:09:00] at the monument
[1:09:02] and the mothers and the fathers would
[1:09:04] say this is what happens to a
[1:09:06] disobedient son
[1:09:08] and tell them the story of Absalom it is
[1:09:12] a place of disrespect and it is a
[1:09:14] monument to this man and what he did
[1:09:18] thank you Brothers
[1:09:20] so look at the difference between this
[1:09:23] man absolute and his father David
[1:09:28] in all the mistakes that he made in life
[1:09:31] and there were many
[1:09:33] yet God said he's a man after my own
[1:09:36] heart
[1:09:37] and every king after him was judged
[1:09:41] according to the standard that David set
[1:09:44] has had a wonderful wonderful Legacy in
[1:09:48] this this man David
[1:09:50] I do want to read in second Samuel
[1:09:53] chapter 18 verse 33 when this young man
[1:09:57] Absalom when they went to war and uh you
[1:09:59] know the story had a bunch of hair and
[1:10:00] he got it caught up in the in the oak
[1:10:02] tree and he was hanging there and joab
[1:10:04] comes and kills him
[1:10:06] they bring news back to David
[1:10:09] and David's first question is what
[1:10:12] happened
[1:10:13] to Absalom this is the man that took his
[1:10:16] kingdom
[1:10:17] with hatred took his kingdom disgraced
[1:10:21] David
[1:10:22] disgrace the city
[1:10:24] yet David was worried about this this
[1:10:27] young man Absalom and he says this
[1:10:31] and the King was much moved he got 1833.
[1:10:34] the King was much moved and went up to
[1:10:37] the chamber over the gate and wept
[1:10:39] and as he went thus he said my son o my
[1:10:44] son my my son Absalom
[1:10:47] would God that I had died for thee
[1:10:51] Absalom my son
[1:10:54] who does that sound like
[1:10:56] does that not sound like the Lord Jesus
[1:10:59] himself
[1:11:00] do you see the Holy Spirit there in this
[1:11:03] man David
[1:11:05] that this
[1:11:07] man sinned against him
[1:11:10] and yet he said I would have died in
[1:11:13] your Stead
[1:11:15] and look what Jesus did for each of us
[1:11:17] and how important it is to have that
[1:11:22] same spirit
[1:11:24] and look at the Legacy between the two
[1:11:27] men one is a legacy of Shame and
[1:11:30] reproach and the other is a legacy that
[1:11:33] God says a man after mine own heart
[1:11:35] David
[1:11:38] and I look at David
[1:11:41] and I see
[1:11:44] how it didn't matter
[1:11:47] all the mistakes that he made
[1:11:49] and there were many of them
[1:11:52] but David had in his heart to be right
[1:11:56] and he wanted to be right he had
[1:11:58] humility
[1:11:59] with David it wasn't so much about David
[1:12:04] as it was about the Lord
[1:12:06] with Absalom it was all about me
[1:12:09] and all about about what I can do and
[1:12:12] what I can accomplish there's a famous
[1:12:14] author named C.S Lewis
[1:12:16] he uh he said this in one of his books
[1:12:18] he said humility is not thinking less of
[1:12:22] yourself
[1:12:24] but it is thinking of yourself less
[1:12:28] humility is not thinking less of
[1:12:31] yourself but is thinking about yourself
[1:12:32] less
[1:12:34] and be good for us to have a little bit
[1:12:37] more of that in today's society
[1:12:40] today's society it's instead of it's
[1:12:43] it's giving me this I'm entitled to this
[1:12:45] I should be this this this is mine
[1:12:47] instead of that we should ask the Lord
[1:12:50] Lord help me use what I have to bless
[1:12:53] others
[1:12:55] not for myself
[1:12:58] an Absalom would have used his talents
[1:13:00] for King David
[1:13:01] he could have helped he could have done
[1:13:04] maybe great things
[1:13:07] and
[1:13:09] Jesus himself he says this he says who
[1:13:12] whoever wants to be my disciple
[1:13:14] they must deny themselves
[1:13:17] follow me
[1:13:20] and then so often friends and and
[1:13:23] I uh
[1:13:26] you know I look at myself here standing
[1:13:28] in the Pulpit it's so often
[1:13:31] that this Pulpit fails
[1:13:35] that
[1:13:37] I've seen I've heard so many pastors
[1:13:40] trying to beat the people over the head
[1:13:42] saying come to church you got to come to
[1:13:44] church you got to come to church you
[1:13:46] know there's you got to be in church and
[1:13:48] you should be in you should be in church
[1:13:49] and you're a sinner if you don't go to
[1:13:51] church I understand that and the pastors
[1:13:53] are saying that so we'll come in and
[1:13:56] they can do they can make an impact in
[1:13:58] our lives but I say sometimes brother
[1:14:00] why are they not coming to church
[1:14:02] thank you
[1:14:04] is it always their fault
[1:14:06] or is it this fault right here at the
[1:14:10] pulpit
[1:14:12] why don't they want to come
[1:14:15] let me tell you brother brother Steve is
[1:14:18] when uh brother hick and and brother
[1:14:21] wheeler and and all of these these
[1:14:24] things were happening in the 1960s
[1:14:26] brother Branham didn't have to tell
[1:14:27] people to come to church
[1:14:29] he didn't have to try to pull on him
[1:14:31] they were lined up at the door trying to
[1:14:34] get in
[1:14:35] because they were expecting something to
[1:14:38] happen
[1:14:38] because things were happening they were
[1:14:42] expecting things to to take place
[1:14:46] and now
[1:14:48] we see not not just this church we see
[1:14:52] churches around the country any
[1:14:53] Christian church we see the Pew is just
[1:14:56] emptying
[1:14:58] why is that
[1:15:00] there should be more coming from this
[1:15:04] part of the church
[1:15:05] there should be more Revelation coming
[1:15:08] there should be more miracles coming
[1:15:10] there should be more leadership coming
[1:15:12] so that the people want to come in
[1:15:15] but instead we beat him over the head
[1:15:19] you're wrong you should be in church we
[1:15:22] should be in church of course we should
[1:15:25] but we should want to come to church
[1:15:29] and that's the leadership from the
[1:15:30] pulpit
[1:15:31] is being able to move with God and say
[1:15:35] why do people not want to come
[1:15:38] Hebrews chapter 10.
[1:15:42] verse 22.
[1:15:45] says this
[1:15:46] let us draw near
[1:15:48] with a true heart and full Assurance of
[1:15:51] Faith having our hearts sprinkled from
[1:15:53] all evil conscience and our bodies
[1:15:55] washed with pure water let us hold fast
[1:15:58] to the profession of our faith without
[1:16:00] wavering for he is faithful that
[1:16:03] promised and let us consider one another
[1:16:06] to provoke unto love and good works
[1:16:13] provoke it means to encourage
[1:16:16] or the spur others under good works get
[1:16:20] them excited get them get this get the
[1:16:22] Lord make the Lord welcome so things
[1:16:25] happen so they want to come
[1:16:28] this Pulpit should provoke you
[1:16:31] to be here
[1:16:33] not forsaking the assembling of
[1:16:36] ourselves together
[1:16:38] as the manner of some is
[1:16:43] not forsaking the assembling of
[1:16:45] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:16:48] is
[1:16:49] but exhorting one another and so much
[1:16:52] the more as you see the day approaching
[1:16:58] again
[1:17:04] it's not always the congregation
[1:17:07] many times it's a weak pulpit
[1:17:10] and I see
[1:17:13] I'll just say it I see
[1:17:16] I hear I hear often we got to put
[1:17:19] brother Branham back in the pulpit
[1:17:21] and I know what that means I know it
[1:17:23] means to play tapes in the church and
[1:17:25] that's good and I think that's that's
[1:17:26] good we should play the tapes in the
[1:17:28] church but it doesn't make sense
[1:17:30] it's it's that's not that's not
[1:17:33] successful
[1:17:35] what we should do
[1:17:37] is put Jesus Christ in this Pulpit that
[1:17:42] is why brother Branham was so successful
[1:17:44] he put Jesus in this pulpit and Jesus
[1:17:47] was able to work through him
[1:17:50] and look at all that happened back then
[1:17:53] that's what should happen today
[1:17:55] is put Christ in this Pulpit let this
[1:17:59] guy get out of the way
[1:18:01] and let it come forward whether it's
[1:18:03] playing a tape in church 100 agree with
[1:18:06] that or whether it's ministering however
[1:18:08] the spirit is leading but let Christ be
[1:18:12] here put Christ back in the pulpit
[1:18:16] I was uh
[1:18:21] I was
[1:18:23] brother brother hick
[1:18:26] the wheeler my grandpa my mom and my dad
[1:18:30] were in the Branham Tabernacle I'm sure
[1:18:33] you're too young but
[1:18:35] the um brother Branham was preaching the
[1:18:38] sermon on the church ages
[1:18:41] and my mom I think it was my mom that
[1:18:45] was closest
[1:18:47] there on the wall
[1:18:52] was a supernatural light
[1:18:55] it came in
[1:18:57] it's it stayed on the wall you can
[1:19:00] listen the people start shouting and
[1:19:02] rejoicing and they're scared and and Mom
[1:19:05] said she looked at it and it would move
[1:19:07] and it would change there was the light
[1:19:10] from God on that wall
[1:19:13] not able to to to
[1:19:15] um mimic it it was real
[1:19:19] and there they are watching that light
[1:19:21] move in and out and the whole church was
[1:19:25] seeing it my mom was sitting right there
[1:19:27] my dad was sitting a little further away
[1:19:29] everyone was watching it it was real
[1:19:33] why would you not want to come to church
[1:19:35] if that's happening Sister Barbara why
[1:19:36] would you not want to be here
[1:19:38] I was in church a few years ago
[1:19:42] at the Bram Tabernacle and and we were
[1:19:44] at um we're at the the youth center
[1:19:46] because there's there was too many
[1:19:47] people there was a lot of excitement
[1:19:51] about getting back to church that there
[1:19:53] was there was a lot of excitement about
[1:19:54] what God was going to do
[1:19:57] I was sitting Stephanie and Daniel and I
[1:20:00] were we were sitting
[1:20:01] in the pews and they started taking up
[1:20:05] the offering
[1:20:07] and I saw a little commotion over to my
[1:20:10] left maybe about here to meet a brother
[1:20:11] Aaron no farther than that about that
[1:20:13] about that distance
[1:20:16] and I see my brother Adam who's a
[1:20:18] paramedic
[1:20:20] and I see Dr Matt golden
[1:20:24] who is a um he's a trauma surgeon doctor
[1:20:29] I see my brother get up and brother Matt
[1:20:31] every time he sees my brother get up he
[1:20:33] knows that he needs to get up they go
[1:20:34] over and I look and there is a man named
[1:20:38] James Jackson who I've known my whole
[1:20:39] life and old man and he was dead as a
[1:20:43] hammer
[1:20:44] he was out
[1:20:46] his eyes were open his his he was
[1:20:49] slumped down in his chair
[1:20:52] his face was a color that I can't even
[1:20:55] describe gray he was dead
[1:20:59] and you know what he had been dead for
[1:21:02] almost an hour
[1:21:04] so they're over there they're my my
[1:21:06] brother opens up his shirt
[1:21:10] puts his hands on his chest Dr Golden
[1:21:12] Gets behind him standing behind the
[1:21:14] chair has has his hands underneath his
[1:21:18] his
[1:21:19] um jaw right here trying to find a pulse
[1:21:21] they weren't working on him no CPR my
[1:21:24] brother told me he said God told him
[1:21:29] as he had his hands
[1:21:32] on this man God told him make sure he is
[1:21:37] dead because this is going to be a
[1:21:39] testimony
[1:21:42] Dr Golden was standing behind him I was
[1:21:45] looking down the aisle here
[1:21:48] watching
[1:21:50] and they they were just standing there
[1:21:53] basically
[1:21:55] Brother Joseph Branham was in the Pulpit
[1:21:57] he comes down comes around the aisle
[1:22:00] kneels down my brother had his hands on
[1:22:03] brother James and brother James's chest
[1:22:06] Brother Joseph slides his hands under
[1:22:08] there
[1:22:09] and let me tell you something there was
[1:22:11] a spirit in that Congregation of God is
[1:22:15] going to do something
[1:22:17] I can only speak for myself but I knew
[1:22:21] that that man was going to rise from the
[1:22:23] dead
[1:22:23] I knew it
[1:22:25] I can only speak for myself but I got to
[1:22:28] tell you I probably there was a thousand
[1:22:30] other people feeling thinking the same
[1:22:32] thing
[1:22:33] Adam was standing Adam was kneeling down
[1:22:36] he had his hands there
[1:22:39] we were praying all of a sudden
[1:22:42] chest moves up
[1:22:45] starts moving Adam tells Dr Golden he
[1:22:48] says
[1:22:50] I have respiration
[1:22:51] Dr Golden he had his hands right here on
[1:22:54] his on his carotid or his artery right
[1:22:56] here and he felt boom
[1:23:01] he says I have a pulse
[1:23:03] the man came back to life
[1:23:07] and I would venture to say
[1:23:09] I doubt there was ever a more documented
[1:23:12] case of a resurrection
[1:23:14] a man being dead and raising than this
[1:23:17] one having a doctor and a paramedic
[1:23:19] they're witnessing this
[1:23:22] they took him to the hospital
[1:23:24] the only difference
[1:23:27] that this this man had
[1:23:30] was his temperature was four degrees low
[1:23:33] the doctors were talking of talking
[1:23:36] about it and brother Matt's like well
[1:23:37] that probably means he was dead for
[1:23:39] about an hour
[1:23:40] before he came back
[1:23:43] I saw that
[1:23:45] that is what should be present in our
[1:23:49] churches it was common in the book of
[1:23:51] Acts
[1:23:52] it happened a lot I know there was a lot
[1:23:54] of times that that aren't recorded in
[1:23:56] here that they they probably sat through
[1:23:58] the service and maybe nodded off to
[1:24:01] sleep or whatever well we know one
[1:24:02] nodded off to sleep this guy named Utica
[1:24:04] because he was sitting up in the rafters
[1:24:06] yeah I'm glad that that's in there
[1:24:08] and the guy the kid fell down don't fall
[1:24:10] asleep
[1:24:13] the kid fell down dead Paul goes over
[1:24:16] and raises him back up
[1:24:19] that
[1:24:21] is what these things should produce
[1:24:26] but friends they will not produce that I
[1:24:29] look at what happened there at the
[1:24:31] Tabernacle things were going really good
[1:24:34] people were excited to be there there
[1:24:36] was hundreds of people lined up to get
[1:24:39] in and then it just died
[1:24:43] now they don't even go to church in
[1:24:46] years
[1:24:47] I don't even they don't even go
[1:24:49] because it stopped being about the Lord
[1:24:53] and about the people
[1:24:55] and it gravitated to be about the
[1:24:58] narrative
[1:24:59] and about the denomination and about the
[1:25:01] way of thinking
[1:25:03] and that's when it kills it every single
[1:25:06] time
[1:25:07] it kills it and we look at this man
[1:25:10] Absalom it was about him and yeah it was
[1:25:12] going really good at for a while
[1:25:15] but it ended in disgrace and I'm not
[1:25:17] saying that that's ended in disgrace by
[1:25:18] any means
[1:25:19] um
[1:25:20] I believe the Lord's gonna do things but
[1:25:24] with Absalom it ended in disgrace
[1:25:28] and look at the Legacy that he left
[1:25:31] and now we see our failures as people
[1:25:38] are almost always because we make the
[1:25:41] same mistake that Absalom did and we
[1:25:43] make it about us
[1:25:47] we make it about this guy right here
[1:25:51] rather than about the Lord
[1:25:55] and it's prophesied that it would come
[1:25:57] in this day
[1:26:00] second Timothy chapter 3.
[1:26:03] I have in my Bible right here
[1:26:07] written
[1:26:12] this modern day
[1:26:17] because that's what the prophet said
[1:26:19] that we are living in this day this
[1:26:23] scripture that I'm about to read
[1:26:29] this note also
[1:26:32] that in the last days
[1:26:34] perilous times shall come
[1:26:37] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:26:39] selves coveters boasters proud
[1:26:42] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:26:44] unthankful Unholy
[1:26:47] and it's normal
[1:26:49] in today's society
[1:26:51] how many followers can I get how many
[1:26:54] likes can I get on my videos
[1:26:58] how many friends can I have in Facebook
[1:27:01] and I'm not saying friends I'm not
[1:27:03] saying those things are wrong I'm not
[1:27:06] don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's
[1:27:08] wrong I believe that social media can be
[1:27:10] used for the Lord
[1:27:11] I have no doubt that it can be used from
[1:27:14] the Lord for the Lord but don't deny
[1:27:17] don't look over where we are right now
[1:27:21] you know I've said many times put
[1:27:24] yourself in this Bible Jump Right In and
[1:27:27] then look around
[1:27:30] we are
[1:27:33] it says here it says lovers of their own
[1:27:35] selves
[1:27:39] look around what's going on
[1:27:43] wow
[1:27:44] you know there's
[1:27:47] there's a story
[1:27:49] I've never done this and I don't plan on
[1:27:51] doing it by the way but if you put a
[1:27:53] frog in a pot of water
[1:27:56] of room temperature and you turn up the
[1:27:59] heat pretty slow
[1:28:01] and it starts to get hotter and hotter
[1:28:04] and higher he doesn't even know that
[1:28:05] it's getting hot in there and pretty
[1:28:06] soon the poor little guys boiled like I
[1:28:09] said
[1:28:10] don't do it
[1:28:13] it doesn't matter if it happens or not
[1:28:14] it's just the moral of the story you
[1:28:17] know it's a parable
[1:28:21] look what's happened around with us
[1:28:24] these things have come to pass
[1:28:27] and it's slowly working in and we're
[1:28:31] just sitting there and the pot's getting
[1:28:33] hot
[1:28:34] and it's starting to boil
[1:28:39] lovers of their own selves promoting
[1:28:42] their own selves verse number three
[1:28:44] without natural affections
[1:28:49] I hope you know what that is
[1:28:52] perversion
[1:28:53] pornography it's almost sexuality it's
[1:28:57] these strange lusts
[1:28:59] that have snuck in and always been
[1:29:02] condemned in times past but today in
[1:29:06] this recent hour
[1:29:08] all of a sudden
[1:29:11] it's okay
[1:29:12] in fact it's encouraged
[1:29:15] it's never been that way
[1:29:17] the water's getting hot
[1:29:20] and the Frog's starting to boil and he
[1:29:21] doesn't even know it
[1:29:24] truce Breakers
[1:29:26] false accusers
[1:29:29] look at the gossip that goes on all the
[1:29:32] time
[1:29:33] the Democrats are calling the
[1:29:35] Republicans Nazis and racists you know
[1:29:37] and the Republicans are calling the
[1:29:39] Democrats fascist and they compare them
[1:29:41] to all sorts of evil people saying oh
[1:29:44] this man's like Hitler and all this
[1:29:45] these are some of the evilest people
[1:29:47] that have ever been on the earth and yet
[1:29:49] we're throwing out these insults like
[1:29:51] they're nothing
[1:29:53] you think that's always gone on I don't
[1:29:55] think so
[1:29:56] I think that's in this day
[1:30:03] and then we
[1:30:06] as you were preaching the other night I
[1:30:08] heard what you said you made a couple
[1:30:10] statements
[1:30:11] that you just kind of slipped them in
[1:30:13] and uh I really appreciated that we have
[1:30:16] to be careful
[1:30:18] about separating ourselves
[1:30:20] we have to be careful about saying we're
[1:30:23] better than someone else
[1:30:25] just because we have maybe a little bit
[1:30:29] more light
[1:30:30] or maybe that just because we can put
[1:30:33] ourselves in the Bible and say I would
[1:30:35] have been one of those that followed
[1:30:37] John the Baptist
[1:30:39] and I am
[1:30:41] this guy Daniel Evans I am
[1:30:45] I can place myself in this Bible and say
[1:30:47] I would have followed John the Baptist
[1:30:49] and I would have done what he said when
[1:30:51] he said follow Christ but don't forget
[1:30:52] there was a Matthew
[1:30:54] there's a Mary magdorn there were others
[1:30:57] that may not have had the same light but
[1:30:58] they still came to Christ
[1:31:02] foreign
[1:31:06] fierce
[1:31:07] and despisers of those that are good
[1:31:10] and how careful we should be
[1:31:13] that we are not cutting out people just
[1:31:15] because they don't believe like we do it
[1:31:18] could be
[1:31:19] somebody that that you say oh well they
[1:31:21] don't they just don't have the light
[1:31:22] they're the foolish virgin
[1:31:24] or they're not the elect and this person
[1:31:27] may be spending hours in prayer
[1:31:30] speaking to God studying this word and
[1:31:33] praying for you
[1:31:35] and yeah we might say eh they're not
[1:31:38] good enough
[1:31:39] careful
[1:31:41] this scripture as I said it is for today
[1:31:48] traitors
[1:31:50] Hedy
[1:31:52] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:31:53] lovers of God
[1:31:57] snuck up on us the past 60 to 70 years
[1:32:01] all this entertainment and stuff and
[1:32:02] like I said friends I'm not legalistic
[1:32:04] I'm not against these things but I just
[1:32:07] want to show where we're at

[1:32:57] of you you don't have to raise your hand
[1:33:00] how much time do you spend
[1:33:02] on these other things
[1:33:04] and then how much time do you spend on
[1:33:05] things of God
[1:33:08] think about it each one of us
[1:33:12] YouTube and Netflix and anything else
[1:33:16] like I said I'm not trying to I'm not a
[1:33:19] legalistic person I think legalism is a
[1:33:21] failure because there's always a
[1:33:23] loophole
[1:33:25] but how much over time are we spending
[1:33:28] on these things
[1:33:30] and we know that this is the end all of
[1:33:33] these things are starting to happen
[1:33:35] and yet
[1:33:36] yeah
[1:33:37] you know I'll do it tomorrow
[1:33:40] you know I'll waste I'll waste a little
[1:33:43] bit more time I was

[1:35:12] um
[1:35:14] but it's true
[1:35:18] um
[1:35:21] Traders heady High minded love is a
[1:35:23] pleasure more than lovers of God
[1:35:25] having a form of godliness
[1:35:27] but denying the power thereof from such
[1:35:30] turn away
[1:35:33] for of this sort are they which creep
[1:35:35] into houses and leave cap lead captives
[1:35:37] silly women Laden was sinned LED away
[1:35:39] with divers lusts ever learning and
[1:35:42] never able to come to the knowledge of
[1:35:43] the truth
[1:35:45] merrily asked me the other night
[1:35:47] we were talking and she she said what
[1:35:50] does that mean what's that scripture
[1:35:52] ever learning
[1:35:54] and never able to come to the knowledge
[1:35:57] of the truth
[1:35:59] and it's they don't have a sincere heart
[1:36:02] they're reading these scriptures
[1:36:05] learning them they're listening to these
[1:36:09] sermons and they're listening for just
[1:36:11] what they want to hear
[1:36:14] they're reading for just what they want
[1:36:17] to further their narrative
[1:36:20] to make them feel better about
[1:36:21] themselves
[1:36:23] but never able to come to the knowledge
[1:36:26] of what God is trying to tell us
[1:36:29] in this last day
[1:36:32] I uh
[1:36:35] message of the hour have to be careful
[1:36:38] um let's turn to Galatians chapter six
[1:36:44] verse 1.
[1:36:46] in talking about
[1:36:48] it's not all about us
[1:36:50] and talking about the seeds that we
[1:36:52] plant
[1:36:53] here the Apostle Paul in writing this
[1:36:56] letter to the Galatians in chapter 6 he
[1:36:58] says this Brethren if a man be overtaken
[1:37:01] in a fault ye which are spiritual
[1:37:03] restore such a one to the spirit of in
[1:37:06] the spirit of meekness considering
[1:37:08] thyself
[1:37:10] lest thou also be tempted
[1:37:13] I love that
[1:37:15] I love that scripture oh man that just
[1:37:18] felt so good if a man be overtaken in a
[1:37:22] fault
[1:37:23] you words are spiritual
[1:37:26] restore such a one in the spirit of
[1:37:28] meekness if this man or this woman say I
[1:37:31] made a mistake
[1:37:33] I did something wrong bring them back in
[1:37:37] never never put them out now there may
[1:37:42] be things arise in the church
[1:37:45] of bad spirits then you say there's the
[1:37:48] door
[1:37:49] but in meekness this person comes back I
[1:37:52] don't care what they've done
[1:37:54] bring them back into the fold
[1:37:57] and it says here Paul says consider
[1:38:01] yourself
[1:38:03] consider what you have done
[1:38:07] to Christ
[1:38:09] everyone in this room
[1:38:11] has sinned against the Lord Jesus every
[1:38:14] single one of us has fallen consider
[1:38:18] what I have done to you Lord
[1:38:22] what have I done to you
[1:38:24] and when I start thinking about that
[1:38:27] nobody's ever done anything to me
[1:38:29] you know we get mad at somebody oh this
[1:38:32] person said this about me or you know
[1:38:33] this you know it wasn't me money or
[1:38:34] whatever what have I done to God
[1:38:38] it just kind of wipes it all the way
[1:38:40] right there
[1:38:42] bear ye one another's burdens
[1:38:45] and so fulfill the law of Christ
[1:38:48] for if a man think of himself to be
[1:38:49] something
[1:38:51] when he is nothing
[1:38:53] he deceives himself
[1:38:55] how many I could go how many times do
[1:38:57] you see somebody trying to be something
[1:38:59] they're not and not it never the Lord
[1:39:02] never blesses it
[1:39:04] you know you see people trying to to go
[1:39:08] into business or preach preach the
[1:39:09] gospel or or do whatever they're trying
[1:39:11] to do they do it for the wrong motives
[1:39:14] and then you see God doesn't bless it
[1:39:17] it doesn't grow it doesn't we don't see
[1:39:20] the the Sinners coming to the Lord
[1:39:23] you know in in business you see it keep
[1:39:25] failing and failing and failing and
[1:39:27] ending bad
[1:39:28] they're trying to be something that
[1:39:30] they're not
[1:39:33] where was I 3. um
[1:39:36] let's skip down to seven
[1:39:38] be not deceived
[1:39:43] God is Not mocked
[1:39:45] for whatsoever man soweth that shall he
[1:39:48] reap also
[1:39:50] the Amplified Bible says this God will
[1:39:51] not allow himself to be ridiculed he
[1:39:54] will not allow his precepts to be
[1:39:55] scornfully set aside
[1:39:58] I say God backs up his word
[1:40:01] it says here for whatsoever a man soweth
[1:40:04] that shall he reap no
[1:40:08] if you don't know what the Apostle is
[1:40:10] talking about there he's talking about
[1:40:11] if you plant a tomato plant
[1:40:15] and it grows and then it Bears Tomatoes
[1:40:18] you plant a grapefruit tree
[1:40:20] you plant the little seedlings in a few
[1:40:23] years you're able to reap the Bounty
[1:40:25] from this grapefruit tree
[1:40:27] you're able to you're able to go out and
[1:40:29] pick it and you know you planted it you
[1:40:31] you watered it you fertilized it and
[1:40:33] after a little while you can pick the
[1:40:36] fruit off of it and enjoy it
[1:40:39] and that's the same thing with us we
[1:40:41] plant these seeds
[1:40:44] and then later
[1:40:46] they flourish
[1:40:48] and the Lord adds the increase but let
[1:40:52] me tell you
[1:40:53] we can also plant the negative seeds
[1:40:56] we can see how
[1:40:59] how a negative seed can be planted and
[1:41:02] then it grows
[1:41:04] it could be gossip saying something
[1:41:06] about somebody
[1:41:08] I'll give my own testimony when I was a
[1:41:10] kid
[1:41:11] I don't know I was 13 14 years old
[1:41:14] I used to watch the Chicago Cubs play on
[1:41:18] on TV is when I get home from school
[1:41:20] they were playing I just I love baseball
[1:41:23] and uh between Innings there was a song
[1:41:26] that would play
[1:41:27] it's kind of a catchy tune
[1:41:30] so
[1:41:31] my friend had that cassette tape
[1:41:36] so my friend loans me that tape
[1:41:39] and I started listening to that song
[1:41:42] on there
[1:41:45] and then I started listening to the
[1:41:47] other songs
[1:41:49] Van Halen
[1:41:51] brother Steve you wouldn't know that is
[1:41:52] right
[1:41:55] I'm just kidding I don't know I think
[1:41:58] started listening to it
[1:42:00] and it took root inside of me
[1:42:04] as a Young Man
[1:42:07] and it started to grow
[1:42:10] this listening to this music
[1:42:13] music is meant for worship
[1:42:16] so as I'm listening to this music then
[1:42:20] you know it becomes worship
[1:42:24] and that was the door
[1:42:27] for me as a young man that was the door
[1:42:29] for sin to enter into my life
[1:42:34] and then
[1:42:35] other things followed
[1:42:37] after that
[1:42:40] when as I got older it was if things
[1:42:42] started getting it turned into other
[1:42:45] other sins that that I would do you know
[1:42:48] maybe one of them was was
[1:42:50] my mouth and and
[1:42:53] not speaking appropriately you know
[1:42:55] cussing
[1:42:57] and there's and it leads to many other
[1:42:58] things but it started right here
[1:43:02] that I invited I planted the seed
[1:43:06] and it grew
[1:43:12] then
[1:43:13] I gave my heart to the Lord on my 21st
[1:43:15] birthday
[1:43:16] got rid of all of it
[1:43:19] ah praise the Lord is right it feels
[1:43:21] really good that that it's been that
[1:43:23] long
[1:43:25] I was thinking about music and how
[1:43:27] important it is and like I said it's
[1:43:29] worship
[1:43:31] be careful
[1:43:32] what you're listening to I was
[1:43:35] a few years ago
[1:43:37] I was um
[1:43:39] downstairs and you know we all go
[1:43:41] through things up and up and down and uh
[1:43:44] I was down and I I started I got on the
[1:43:48] uh
[1:43:48] down in the basement of my house I got
[1:43:51] on the uh the um stationary bike and I'm
[1:43:55] exercising and I'm just kind of praying
[1:43:57] to the Lord and I I get my iPad and I
[1:43:59] turn on YouTube and I searched I think
[1:44:02] Christian music
[1:44:05] and
[1:44:06] I found this song
[1:44:09] and it was a song there was this man
[1:44:11] that he went into this prison
[1:44:15] and he had a concert
[1:44:18] and the name of the song the song as I
[1:44:21] was listening
[1:44:23] the man saying these words he says I'm
[1:44:25] no longer a Slave To Fear
[1:44:27] I am a child of God
[1:44:30] he says you unravel me with a Melody you
[1:44:33] surround me with a song of deliverance
[1:44:36] from my enemies and until all my fears
[1:44:39] are gone gone
[1:44:41] I am a child of God and I I put my hands
[1:44:45] up and I just was praising the Lord and
[1:44:47] I looked at on the on the video and
[1:44:50] there's all these these prisoners and
[1:44:53] their hands are up and tears are coming
[1:44:55] down their face and I see what seeds
[1:44:57] were planted in these prisoners that put
[1:45:00] them there in that prison
[1:45:01] and I see this man God bless him come in
[1:45:04] there and sing songs of worship
[1:45:08] to plant good seed
[1:45:11] in these men
[1:45:13] verse 9 it says this and let us not be
[1:45:16] weary and well doing
[1:45:18] for in due season we shall reap
[1:45:21] if we faint not
[1:45:24] if we keep going and we keep trying
[1:45:27] as we have therefore opportunity let us
[1:45:30] do unto all men especially unto them
[1:45:33] who are of the household of faith
[1:45:36] that's a nice little thing to put in
[1:45:38] there
[1:45:40] especially
[1:45:41] now do good don't stop doing good to
[1:45:43] everybody but especially those that
[1:45:46] believe Christ
[1:45:48] charity starts here don't neglect one
[1:45:51] another in this room
[1:45:54] you know so often I've seen people get
[1:45:56] upset and they're the nicest people out
[1:45:58] to
[1:46:00] others at Walmart or Costco or wherever
[1:46:03] they go but then man they run each other
[1:46:06] down inside of church
[1:46:09] don't do that
[1:46:12] says right here start right here
[1:46:14] this love that we have one for another
[1:46:18] that this should be first priority
[1:46:25] um I'm gonna I'm gonna skip
[1:46:28] I want to go down to um
[1:46:33] let's go down to Second Peter chapter
[1:46:35] three
[1:46:40] but beloved
[1:46:43] verse 8.
[1:46:44] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:46:47] thing
[1:46:48] that one day is with the Lord as a
[1:46:51] thousand years and a thousand years is
[1:46:52] one day
[1:46:53] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[1:46:55] promise as some men count slackness but
[1:46:58] his long-suffering to us word
[1:47:01] he knows when to answer our prayers
[1:47:05] not willing that any should perish
[1:47:08] but that all should come to repentance
[1:47:12] you know we all we pray we pray for our
[1:47:15] families we pray for ourselves we pray
[1:47:17] for our sickness and we wonder Lord why
[1:47:20] has this not happened yet it's not about
[1:47:24] you
[1:47:26] God knows God knows the begin from the
[1:47:30] beginning from the ending
[1:47:32] and these sicknesses that we have maybe
[1:47:34] it's our children that are Wayward maybe
[1:47:37] whatever it is it's not about you he is
[1:47:40] accomplishing something
[1:47:43] he's accomplishing a goal
[1:47:46] and we should have faith
[1:47:48] in him faith in when he is going to
[1:47:52] answer we know he's going to answer
[1:47:53] because he promised but wait on him
[1:47:57] because we don't know when these things
[1:47:59] are going to happen
[1:48:00] you know sometimes
[1:48:03] we make mistakes
[1:48:06] has anybody made a mistake
[1:48:09] good Daniel raised his hand I can
[1:48:11] testify
[1:48:13] um
[1:48:17] we make mistakes friends
[1:48:19] we do
[1:48:20] and every single one of us and sometimes
[1:48:23] we look back
[1:48:25] and we say Lord
[1:48:27] why did I make that mistake
[1:48:30] why
[1:48:32] Lord I messed up so bad
[1:48:36] why did you let me make this mistake and
[1:48:38] Lord I'm so sorry I I did this and I
[1:48:41] shouldn't have done it I committed this
[1:48:43] sin or I made this transgression I did
[1:48:46] all of this Lord and you feel so bad
[1:48:50] but remember it's not about you
[1:48:54] sometimes he allows us
[1:48:58] to make mistakes
[1:49:00] just as he did with David
[1:49:02] just as he did with many others
[1:49:03] sometimes he allows us to make mistakes
[1:49:09] because it's going to accomplish his
[1:49:11] perfect will
[1:49:16] if you've made a mistake
[1:49:18] and you can't put it under the blood
[1:49:19] you're not even a Christian
[1:49:21] I don't mean to condemn anyone but
[1:49:23] that's kind of the whole
[1:49:26] book
[1:49:28] we put it under the blood
[1:49:32] and let it go and we thank God
[1:49:36] and sometimes he lets us make these
[1:49:39] mistakes he allows it whether it be
[1:49:42] David we know the story of Nellie
[1:49:43] Sanders
[1:49:45] who who she lived in sin she lived a
[1:49:47] rough life she gave her heart to the
[1:49:49] Lord Jesus she was a dancer she liked to
[1:49:52] go to the clubs so she's she she changed
[1:49:55] she's walking by and she hears the music
[1:49:59] oh
[1:50:03] and then
[1:50:05] she goes up to the step
[1:50:07] and then she goes inside
[1:50:10] and pretty soon she's in a boy's arms
[1:50:12] and completely fell
[1:50:16] then a little while later we know that
[1:50:19] it turns out to be a supernatural thing
[1:50:22] she comes and a demon was cast out of
[1:50:26] her a little bit later
[1:50:28] do you think maybe God allowed Nellie
[1:50:31] Sanders to make that mistake so we could
[1:50:33] tell this story
[1:50:35] it's a sure is a blessing to me
[1:50:37] and how many times I've messed up
[1:50:40] but he allowed her to make this mistake
[1:50:45] so remember
[1:50:47] keep planting the seeds
[1:50:50] and the mistakes that all of us have
[1:50:51] made
[1:50:52] don't worry about them
[1:50:54] they could very well be for the glory of
[1:50:59] God
[1:51:00] God knew every mistake that we're gonna
[1:51:02] make
[1:51:03] we didn't surprise him
[1:51:06] but he allowed it
[1:51:08] and if we do right he allowed it for his
[1:51:11] glory
[1:51:13] I am once again I'm gonna have to cut
[1:51:15] cut it short sisters if you could come
[1:51:18] and brother Matt
[1:51:21] I want to close with the story
[1:51:25] about a man
[1:51:26] who made a very serious mistake
[1:51:30] and this mistake that he made it was
[1:51:32] because it was about himself and this is
[1:51:34] an Absalom
[1:51:36] this is another man
[1:51:38] his name is Peter
[1:51:40] famous
[1:51:41] we all know
[1:51:44] Peter
[1:51:46] was with the Lord for three and a half
[1:51:48] years
[1:51:51] he knew the ups and downs he had seen
[1:51:54] Jesus cast out Devils he saw Jesus heal
[1:51:57] the sick he saw people come give their
[1:51:59] hearts to the Lord he knew
[1:52:02] this man was the Messiah that was
[1:52:05] promised to come
[1:52:07] Peter was there man he was there from
[1:52:10] the beginning
[1:52:12] Peter knew what Jesus said
[1:52:15] and then when things got a little rough
[1:52:18] Peter himself
[1:52:21] started thinking about this guy
[1:52:24] he was worried about his own skin
[1:52:27] let me read a scripture to You Luke 22
[1:52:29] 31.
[1:52:33] this is at the end
[1:52:35] of the story of the Gospels
[1:52:40] it's a hard time
[1:52:42] Jesus says this he said Simon
[1:52:46] behold Satan has desire to have you that
[1:52:50] he may sift you as wheat
[1:52:52] I have to admit I don't know what that
[1:52:54] means
[1:52:55] but if it's Satan it's not good
[1:52:59] but I have prayed for thee that thy
[1:53:01] faith fail not
[1:53:03] and when thou art converted strengthen
[1:53:05] thy brother
[1:53:06] now listen to this
[1:53:08] and he said unto him Lord I am ready to
[1:53:11] go with thee both into prison and to
[1:53:14] death
[1:53:15] and he said I tell thee Peter
[1:53:17] the shall not Crow this day before
[1:53:20] thou hast Thou shalt Thrice deny me
[1:53:25] that deny that thou even knowest me
[1:53:28] this man that had been with Jesus
[1:53:30] he said the rooster ain't gonna Crow
[1:53:33] until you've denied me three times
[1:53:37] just in this very day
[1:53:39] there's like no way
[1:53:41] I could never
[1:53:42] do that
[1:53:44] the same story is told in Matthew 26
[1:53:46] verse 31 he says this Jesus said unto
[1:53:49] them all you shall be offended because
[1:53:51] of me in this night for it is written I
[1:53:53] will Smite the shepherd and the sheep of
[1:53:55] the flock shall be scattered abroad
[1:53:59] but after I am risen again I will go
[1:54:01] before you into Galilee Peter answered
[1:54:03] and said unto him though all men shall
[1:54:05] be offended because of thee yet I will
[1:54:07] never be offended
[1:54:09] and again
[1:54:10] Jesus tells him
[1:54:12] this day you're going to deny me three
[1:54:15] times
[1:54:17] so Jesus
[1:54:19] comes before Pilate
[1:54:21] beaten
[1:54:24] and here is this man that had been with
[1:54:27] him
[1:54:28] all of these days
[1:54:31] he says
[1:54:32] he was scared he was thinking about
[1:54:33] himself he says I don't even know you I
[1:54:36] don't even know Jesus
[1:54:38] imagine that there's a scripture I
[1:54:40] guarantee you
[1:54:41] Peter knew what Jesus has said let me
[1:54:44] see if I can find it yeah Matthew
[1:54:46] chapter 10.
[1:54:48] verse 32 and 33.
[1:54:51] Jesus says this he says whosoever shall
[1:54:54] confess me before men him will I confess
[1:54:56] also before my Father which is in heaven
[1:54:58] but so whosoever shall deny me before
[1:55:00] men him will I also deny before my
[1:55:03] Father which is in heaven and Peter
[1:55:05] denied him
[1:55:07] not once but three times
[1:55:10] he sees this man beaten down
[1:55:13] and they say oh you look like one of the
[1:55:15] ones that was with him I wasn't with him
[1:55:17] I don't even know him
[1:55:19] then again
[1:55:21] happens again
[1:55:23] I didn't know him I don't even know him
[1:55:25] and then what does Peter do
[1:55:28] he cussed
[1:55:30] he swore
[1:55:33] said cuss words
[1:55:35] young people
[1:55:37] look how Peter tried to separate himself
[1:55:39] from Jesus Christ
[1:55:41] there is no way
[1:55:43] someone that swears and has a dirty
[1:55:47] mouth could be associated with Christ
[1:55:51] scary
[1:55:52] Peter himself three times
[1:55:54] denies the Lord
[1:55:58] Jesus goes to the cross and it says
[1:56:00] after the third time he heard the
[1:56:03] rooster crow and he just fell down said
[1:56:04] Lord I'm so sorry
[1:56:06] and he just wept there is Peter broken
[1:56:11] and and and comes comes down
[1:56:15] and
[1:56:18] doesn't know what to do
[1:56:21] no matter what sin that you have
[1:56:25] committed
[1:56:26] no matter what you have done
[1:56:29] Peter did about as bad as you can
[1:56:32] compare Peter and Judas
[1:56:34] one man's heart was right and the other
[1:56:36] one wasn't wasn't
[1:56:38] but they both did a similar thing
[1:56:43] Peter
[1:56:45] repented
[1:56:47] he his heart was right
[1:56:49] so whatever sin we have committed no
[1:56:53] matter what it is the whole reason that
[1:56:56] we're here in church today the whole
[1:56:58] reason that we pray is because we know
[1:57:00] that that grace is sufficient
[1:57:03] never never
[1:57:05] make the mistake
[1:57:07] of saying Lord I've done this I've
[1:57:10] sinned all this oh I have all of this in
[1:57:13] my past so I really can't do anything
[1:57:15] for you
[1:57:16] no Peter did about the worst that you
[1:57:20] can do
[1:57:21] and then God chose him
[1:57:24] to preach the very first sermon
[1:57:28] after the Holy Spirit had fell
[1:57:30] said some said great things like
[1:57:34] they asked Peter they said how do we
[1:57:36] receive this Holy Ghost and he says
[1:57:37] repent every one of you
[1:57:41] and be baptized
[1:57:43] in the name of the Lord Jesus for the
[1:57:45] remission of your sins
[1:57:47] and you shall receive this gift of the
[1:57:52] Holy Ghost for this promise
[1:57:55] is unto you
[1:57:58] and to them that are far off us
[1:58:01] even as many as the Lord our gods are
[1:58:03] called the Lord chose this man to preach
[1:58:07] that message that had just denied him I
[1:58:11] thank God for the Amos I thank God
[1:58:14] that my sins
[1:58:17] are under this blood and I want to sow
[1:58:19] those seeds
[1:58:21] those good seeds of the Gospel
[1:58:25] and I don't want to make it about me
[1:58:28] about this guy
[1:58:30] sister if you could start playing
[1:58:32] I don't want to make it
[1:58:34] about this guy because it'll fail
[1:58:38] and then our
[1:58:43] um Legacy would be like absolute
[1:58:47] destruction
[1:58:50] I am
[1:58:52] I ask each of you
[1:58:55] what seeds are you sowing
[1:58:58] in this life
[1:59:00] you're sowing seeds every single one of
[1:59:02] us is sowing seeds somewhere
[1:59:04] just think of these seeds that we're
[1:59:06] throwing out are they going to grow into
[1:59:09] good things
[1:59:11] are they going to grow into bad things
[1:59:13] some of these seeds
[1:59:15] we live in Arizona how many times have
[1:59:17] we tried that
[1:59:19] cut off and dig up a baby Mesquite
[1:59:22] I mean that thing's this big and it's
[1:59:25] root is this big it's hard to get rid of
[1:59:27] that thing
[1:59:29] imagine if that was
[1:59:31] a good
[1:59:32] gospel raising our children
[1:59:36] that root goes way down there is nothing
[1:59:39] in the world that can yank that out
[1:59:42] it'll grow and flourish one day as soon
[1:59:46] as it gets a little bit of sunshine and
[1:59:47] a little water
[1:59:49] make sure it's not a negative seed
[1:59:51] because sometimes those things are hard
[1:59:52] to get rid of too
[1:59:54] foreign
[1:59:55] once again read
[1:59:57] [Music]
[1:59:58] this verse that I started with
[2:00:02] James chapter 4
[2:00:04] verse 14.
[2:00:06] says this it says whereas ye know not
[2:00:09] what shall be on the morrow
[2:00:12] for what is your life
[2:00:17] it is
[2:00:19] it is even a vapor
[2:00:22] that appeareth for a little time
[2:00:25] and then vanish at the way
[2:00:29] how important is this time that we have
[2:00:31] here friends
[2:00:34] how I want to make a mark
[2:00:37] I want to sow seeds that are going to
[2:00:39] grow
[2:00:40] into trees that are going to give fruit
[2:00:42] you know take this one little seed
[2:00:45] just this one little seed and you plant
[2:00:47] it and you never know
[2:00:50] how great it's going to be
[2:00:52] but sometimes that plant will grow
[2:00:58] and I may be the little seed
[2:01:02] but I want to see in the future if there
[2:01:05] is one I want to see a whole tree but
[2:01:08] Steve just
[2:01:09] bearing fruit
[2:01:11] everywhere it can
[2:01:13] I want to see it happen
[2:01:17] to you too
[2:01:19] do you brothers and sisters
[2:01:21] it's an opportunity I I've read in this
[2:01:24] second Timothy how this is our modern
[2:01:26] day
[2:01:28] and that frog that was in the water
[2:01:32] he didn't even notice
[2:01:33] he didn't even notice what was going on
[2:01:35] around him but these things have never
[2:01:36] happened
[2:01:38] they've never gone on
[2:01:39] it's never even been possible
[2:01:42] for these scriptures to come to pass
[2:01:44] until today
[2:01:45] but they are
[2:01:46] like I said I'm not preaching against
[2:01:48] social media or anything like that I
[2:01:50] just want to look around
[2:01:52] and say that it is here
[2:01:56] lovers of their own selves
[2:02:00] oh yeah
[2:02:02] thank God
[2:02:04] I thank God that he has given us his
[2:02:08] word
[2:02:09] I thank God that he has given his son
[2:02:11] Jesus Christ and and I really I thank
[2:02:15] God that all the mistakes that I've made
[2:02:16] they're under the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:02:18] and I can still like Peter like David
[2:02:21] like all these other ones I can still
[2:02:24] preach his gospel I can still
[2:02:27] follow him
[2:02:28] even though there are stains in the past
[2:02:31] which every one of us there are stains
[2:02:35] there
[2:02:36] but by the grace of God
[2:02:38] we can spread this gospel and we can
[2:02:41] move forward and let me tell you friends
[2:02:44] if this is the end which it is Jesus is
[2:02:47] coming
[2:02:48] he's coming soon
[2:02:50] it's going to be any day
[2:02:52] so be ready and make sure others are
[2:02:55] ready
[2:02:56] I got a letter I get a couple letters
[2:02:59] that correspond with a few of the of the
[2:03:01] prisoners and I was thinking that
[2:03:03] scripture about those when they they
[2:03:05] reprint bring them back
[2:03:07] and I look at some of these these
[2:03:10] prisoners these inmates they're in
[2:03:11] prison and they are taking these seeds
[2:03:14] that they have and they are preaching
[2:03:16] the gospel trying to plant these seeds
[2:03:19] so they'll grow in other places
[2:03:22] you know that song comes to my mind I I
[2:03:24] thought about that video and I just
[2:03:27] raised my hand thanking God
[2:03:30] that no matter what we've done and those
[2:03:33] those people in that prison they've done
[2:03:35] a lot I'm sure
[2:03:36] God Made A Way
[2:03:38] and I thank God he's made a way for me
[2:03:41] brother Matt if you'd come oh yeah
[2:03:44] it's just it's a somber moment but I
[2:03:47] want to end end on a happy note friends
