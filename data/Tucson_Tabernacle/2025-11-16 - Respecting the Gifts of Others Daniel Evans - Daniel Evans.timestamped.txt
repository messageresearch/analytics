[0:48] I u I've got a couple questions
[0:51] um that I have received and I wanted to
[0:55] address
[0:57] um something that I think has been on
[0:58] the heart of quite a few people
[1:01] especially the people the Sunday night
[1:03] people and the Wednesday night people
[1:05] and I um
[1:08] want to uh maybe give a little
[1:11] explanation in the word about what's I
[1:16] feel is going on and uh then I want to
[1:20] encourage anyone to come to me
[1:22] personally if you have any questions and
[1:24] I'll be happy to answer any questions
[1:26] that you might have. Let's I'm sorry
[1:29] those that are in the back. I uh I'm
[1:32] just going to be doing this the
[1:33] oldfashioned way with my good old King
[1:35] James Scoffield Bible and no notes at
[1:38] all. Can we turn to Ephesians chapter 4?
[1:50] Let's start with verse number 11 if we
[1:53] could.
[1:55] Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11
[2:05] very common verse that many people are
[2:08] are acquainted with. And he gave some
[2:11] apostles and some prophets and some
[2:14] evangelists and some pastors
[2:16] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[2:19] saints, for the work of the ministry,
[2:21] for the edifying of the body of Christ,
[2:23] till we all come in the unity of the
[2:25] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[2:27] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[2:31] of the stature of the fullness of
[2:33] Christ. that we henceforth be no more
[2:35] children, tossed to and fro, and carried
[2:38] about with every wind of doctrine, by
[2:40] the slate of men, and cunning
[2:41] craftiness, whereby they lie in weight
[2:44] to deceive, but speaking the truth in
[2:47] love, may grow up into him in all
[2:51] things, which is the head, even Christ,
[2:55] from whom the whole body
[2:58] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[3:00] together and compacted by that which
[3:03] every joint joint supply according to
[3:05] the effectual
[3:07] working in the measure of every part
[3:10] maketh increase of the body unto the
[3:12] edifying of itself in love.
[3:16] Now let's also turn let's go to 1
[3:19] Corinthians
[3:21] chapter 12.
[3:24] Hold on to that Ephesians 4 and we'll go
[3:26] back to that. 1 Corinthians chapter 12
[3:33] and we will start with
[3:44] let's just start with verse one and
[3:45] we'll go through
[3:49] verse number 12. Verse number one. Now
[3:52] concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I
[3:54] would not have you ignorant. You know
[3:56] that you were that you were Gentiles
[3:59] carried away unto these dumb idols, even
[4:01] as you were led. Wherefore I give you to
[4:05] understand that no man speaking by the
[4:07] spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and
[4:11] that no man can say that Jesus is the
[4:13] Lord but by the Holy Ghost. Now there
[4:16] are diversities of gifts but the same
[4:18] spirit.
[4:21] And there are differences of
[4:22] administrations, but the same Lord. And
[4:25] there are diversities of operations, but
[4:28] it is the same God which workketh all in
[4:30] all. But the manifestation of the Spirit
[4:33] is given to every man to profit with
[4:36] all. For to one is given the spirit,
[4:40] given by the spirit the word of wisdom,
[4:43] to another the word of knowledge by the
[4:47] same spirit. To another faith by the
[4:51] same spirit. To another the gifts of
[4:54] healing by the same spirit. He's he's
[4:57] making a point. He keeps referring to
[4:59] the same spirit which is the Holy
[5:01] Spirit. and to another the working of
[5:03] miracles, to another prophecy, to
[5:06] another discerning of spirits, to
[5:08] another diverse kinds of tongues, and
[5:10] and to another the interpretation of
[5:12] tongues. But all these workketh that one
[5:16] and the selfsame spirit, dividing to
[5:19] every man severally as he will. So the
[5:23] Holy Spirit there, he is dividing these
[5:26] gifts among the body of Christ. If we go
[5:30] back to Ephesians 4, these some apostles
[5:33] and some prophets and some teachers and
[5:35] evangelists and pastors, those are gifts
[5:38] that are placed into the church that
[5:41] work for the body of Christ to introduce
[5:46] us to Jesus. Okay, we're together.
[5:50] That's that's pretty mainstream good
[5:53] plain doctrine. Now, one question that
[5:57] has been coming up and it's kind of
[5:59] where all of this craziness this past
[6:00] week happened and that is saying, "Well,
[6:04] brother Daniel, he's just throwing the
[6:06] message away. He's against the message
[6:08] and he's he's trying he's against it or
[6:12] he's a critic of it or something like
[6:14] that." That's not true by any means.
[6:19] But because I am different
[6:22] does not mean that I am against.
[6:25] I just read Ephesians 4:11. He gave some
[6:29] apostles
[6:31] and they're different than prophets and
[6:34] they're different than evangelists and
[6:37] they're different than pastors and
[6:38] teachers. So these gifts are placed into
[6:41] the church. And no, I don't care who you
[6:44] think you are, you don't have all of
[6:45] them. God placed you to fill a certain
[6:50] role in the church. All right? All of us
[6:54] that are in this room today, all of us
[6:56] have a role to play in the church. I'm
[6:59] my role is to be the pastor.
[7:02] And then we have brother Michael. His
[7:04] role to lead the worship.
[7:08] I can't do
[7:10] his role.
[7:13] Wish I could, but I can't.
[7:16] And neither can brother Michael be in my
[7:19] role. We are different.
[7:22] And
[7:24] these are two different gifts that have
[7:26] been placed into the church. Now look at
[7:29] the body of Christ around the world. Now
[7:33] we're going to talk talk about all of
[7:36] the Christians in the whole world. Okay?
[7:40] God sends gifts to those people. And the
[7:44] gifts that God chooses for us are the
[7:48] gifts that he knows we need. If you look
[7:51] at that Ephesians 4, and he gave some
[7:56] apostles and some prophets.
[8:00] So some apostles came to certain people
[8:04] and were able to convert them.
[8:07] Over here, the prophets came and
[8:09] converted them.
[8:11] And you just read the book of Acts and
[8:12] you can see all of this these things are
[8:15] the case. Paul said so people were they
[8:18] were arguing
[8:20] and uh let's go to fe let's go to 1
[8:22] Corinthians chapter 1. Man this feels
[8:24] good just doing this the oldfashioned
[8:26] way. 1 Corinthians chapter 1
[8:32] and let's go to
[8:36] verse number 10. And it says this. Now I
[8:40] beseech you, brethren, by the name of
[8:42] our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all
[8:44] speak the same thing, and that there be
[8:46] no divisions among you, but that you be
[8:50] perfectly joined together in the same
[8:52] mind, and in the same judgment.
[8:56] All right? He's saying that you should
[8:58] be one. You people that believe on Jesus
[9:00] Christ, you should be in agreement.
[9:04] For it hath been declared unto me of
[9:06] you, my brethren, by them which are of
[9:09] the house of Khloe, that there are
[9:11] contentions among you. Now, think about
[9:14] today. Think about us. Think about uh
[9:17] the the problems that that we have had
[9:19] in the past week. And then think about
[9:21] your history and your whole life,
[9:23] Brother Joe. Think about the the
[9:25] divisions that you've seen over the
[9:27] years.
[9:29] It has been said to me that there that
[9:32] there are contentions among you.
[9:35] Everyone in these contentions thought
[9:37] they were right. Everyone in our
[9:40] contentions today thinks he is right.
[9:44] All right? Or there wouldn't be a
[9:45] contention. You don't knowingly
[9:48] go to battle if you know you are wrong.
[9:51] All right? You everyone thinks they're
[9:53] right. Every man thinks he's right in
[9:55] his own mind.
[9:58] Now verse number 12.
[10:01] Now this I say that every one of you
[10:06] saith. It pretty much covers everybody.
[10:10] Every one of you is saying
[10:15] I am of Paul.
[10:17] Okay. I am of Apollos.
[10:21] I
[10:23] of Cphus which is Peter.
[10:26] and I of Christ. Is Christ divided? Was
[10:30] Paul crucified for you? Or were you
[10:32] baptized in the name of Paul? All right.
[10:37] So, he's saying there are different
[10:39] messengers, different preachers that are
[10:42] sent to different people because we need
[10:47] different things. I am different than
[10:50] you are, brother Joe. There are things
[10:52] that I need that you might need and
[10:54] there's things might not need. There's
[10:56] things that you need that I might not
[10:58] need. God provides those things because
[11:01] this is a just a bouquet of flowers
[11:04] around the world of God's people. And
[11:07] each one of us, God provides. He's made
[11:10] us to where we have a void in our lives.
[11:13] And God
[11:14] makes a way to fill that void. Okay, you
[11:17] with me?
[11:18] So then he gives diversities of gifts
[11:22] and diversities of ministries.
[11:25] And what you are seeing and some one of
[11:27] the things that that you're questioning
[11:29] about my ministry
[11:32] is that why isn't he preaching the way
[11:35] that I'm used to? Why isn't he um up
[11:39] here preaching about brother Brianna?
[11:42] Why isn't he doing that? You've never
[11:44] heard me say that that kind of preaching
[11:46] is wrong.
[11:48] Because I don't say that
[11:51] my ministry
[11:53] is different than this brother's
[11:57] ministry or that brother's ministry
[11:59] because God is using us to fill that
[12:03] void in different people. Do you
[12:06] understand?
[12:07] So in my ministry, the way that the Lord
[12:10] has has um led me is not to preach
[12:15] against anybody. I think that if we
[12:17] preached against someone, we would be
[12:19] doing exactly what Paul said, don't do
[12:21] here, saying, I am of Cphus or I am of
[12:24] Apollos or I am of Paul. He he he says,
[12:27] don't do that. Is Christ divided? And
[12:28] Christ should not be divided. But what
[12:31] he's saying is is God sends different
[12:34] gifts into the church. Go, let's go back
[12:37] to Ephesians 4.
[12:46] Let's read it again. Ephesians 4:11. And
[12:49] he gave some apostles and some prophets
[12:51] and some evangelists and some pastors
[12:53] and teachers. So what is he saying? That
[12:56] there are differences in the ministry.
[12:59] We are not all the same. We are
[13:02] different. But because someone is
[13:05] different, it doesn't necessarily make
[13:07] them wrong. You with me?
[13:10] There are different people called to
[13:12] different
[13:14] um there are different ministers called
[13:16] to those that need different things. For
[13:18] the perfecting of the saints. Okay. Now
[13:21] we see the purpose of it. For the
[13:23] perfecting of the saints, for the work
[13:26] of the ministry.
[13:29] Five different offices here. And really
[13:32] it's we don't want to just divide it
[13:34] into five. It's really an infinite
[13:36] number of different callings that we
[13:39] have.
[13:40] Five is just the best this is the best
[13:44] way to pretty much encompass all of
[13:46] them, but there's like
[13:49] there's there's probably someone between
[13:52] an apostle and a prophet. You know, it's
[13:54] like, well, well, this guy, he's not
[13:56] exactly an apostle. He's not exactly a
[13:57] prophet. You don't have to put yourself
[13:59] in one of those categories. God has has
[14:02] or has [clears throat]
[14:03] or ordained you to be the person that
[14:05] you are for a purpose for the perfecting
[14:08] of the saints for the work of the
[14:10] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[14:12] Christ till now this is it this is the
[14:15] subject till we all come in the unity of
[14:18] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[14:20] son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[14:22] measure of the stature of the fullness
[14:24] of Christ we see that that no matter how
[14:27] many different ministries there are
[14:30] there's Daniel Evans and Israel Poe and
[14:32] Doug Baker and and um Joseph Branom and
[14:37] all of these different ones. All of us
[14:39] have a different ministry but we all
[14:42] should have the same goal and that is
[14:45] the unity of the faith and the knowledge
[14:47] of the son of God. It all comes to
[14:50] Jesus. So here I am and the gift that I
[14:55] have is for evangelical for for to bring
[14:58] people to the Lord. That's my gift. You
[15:03] don't see
[15:04] other message churches with new people
[15:07] coming in. That's not against them.
[15:11] That's just my that's my gift. But then
[15:14] you don't see me breaking down brother
[15:17] Brandham's message and and all of that
[15:19] because that's not my gift. That's
[15:22] someone else's gift. And they are
[15:25] perfectly right in what they are doing
[15:27] as far as I'm concerned.
[15:30] And I believe I am doing what the Lord
[15:32] called me to do. And that's why you see
[15:36] what's happened in our church. God made
[15:39] me in a way. And I've been
[15:43] I've my ministry has kind of done this
[15:46] and this and this. Okay, now it's kind
[15:48] of settled on the way that I teach,
[15:51] which is going into the Bible, going
[15:54] verse by verse, line by line, and
[15:57] applying this Bible to our lives. Okay,
[16:02] pretty simple ministry. And that's what
[16:05] my ministry is. And it's not pulling
[16:07] this quote over here, that quote over
[16:09] there, and putting this in. It's not my
[16:11] calling. If I tried to do that, I'd get
[16:12] outside of my calling.
[16:15] And if somebody else tried to do what
[16:17] I'm doing, they would get outside of
[16:19] their calling.
[16:21] But it all is, put Could you put it back
[16:23] up there? The um Ephesians 4:12.
[16:26] But it is all working for the perfecting
[16:30] of the saints.
[16:32] And a lot of times, I said this morning,
[16:36] when we get defensive
[16:39] is when we make mistakes. I'm pointing
[16:41] to this guy. And sometimes I'll I'll get
[16:45] pressure and pressure and pressure and
[16:46] be like, "No, that is not my ministry.
[16:48] That's not what it is." And then I'll
[16:50] kind of get get strong on it. And I
[16:52] shouldn't do that. I don't mean to do
[16:54] that. What I'm trying to do is just stay
[16:57] within the calling that God has given
[16:59] me. Introduce people to Jesus Christ.
[17:03] Introduce them to the Bible. Encourage
[17:05] them to read their Bible. And move in
[17:08] that direction. That's my calling. I
[17:11] can't be different.
[17:14] I am not any of these other brothers and
[17:17] they're not me. I believe they have just
[17:20] as much of a calling and they are just
[17:22] as right as I am.
[17:25] This is the way that God has placed me
[17:29] here and he is using this church
[17:32] for that purpose for really the
[17:35] evangelical church. evangelical purpose,
[17:38] you know, I mean, Jesus said, "Go out
[17:39] and all go into the world and and make
[17:42] disciples of all nations, baptizing them
[17:45] in the name of the Father and of the Son
[17:46] and of the Holy Ghost." And that's
[17:49] that's what we are doing.
[17:52] We are going out and we're bringing in
[17:54] neighbors and we're bringing in friends
[17:57] and they're coming in and they are being
[17:59] delivered
[18:01] from drug addiction. They're being
[18:03] delivered from alcoholism.
[18:06] They're not sleeping with their
[18:09] girlfriends anymore.
[18:11] They're changing their lives.
[18:14] And that's what this church and that's
[18:17] what I am doing
[18:19] now. Other churches are doing something
[18:22] different.
[18:24] It doesn't mean that they are not just
[18:26] as right as we are and there's no
[18:29] competition there. But to have a church
[18:33] like we have, the most important thing
[18:36] that we can do is love one another.
[18:40] It really is as far as evangelical
[18:44] teaching. That is the best thing that we
[18:46] can do is they can come in and they can
[18:49] be loved and they can see that we love
[18:52] one another. But please friends,
[18:56] don't think that I am against anything.
[19:00] And you know what's amazing? I was
[19:01] telling brother Lyle. Brother Lyle
[19:02] actually. So what happened? So this what
[19:04] prompted this is about uh
[19:08] three minutes before we came out,
[19:11] brother Lyall and I were in the back
[19:13] praying and we were talking about this
[19:15] subject. And as
[19:17] uh brother Lyall was praying and I was
[19:20] we had our arms on each other and as
[19:22] brother Lyall was praying
[19:25] I felt like I was kind of like Lord
[19:29] what about these questions? I talked
[19:31] with brother Michael earlier about this
[19:32] very same thing and and I was like Lord
[19:35] I gotta
[19:38] what's am I wrong? I don't think I'm
[19:40] wrong because if I if I felt that I was
[19:43] wrong I wouldn't do it.
[19:46] But what what do you want me to do?
[19:48] What's right? And I felt like something
[19:50] said that this is your calling
[19:54] that we have different callings. And
[19:56] then that that that scripture was so
[19:58] important. Ephesians 4:1, we I think
[20:02] it's misused many times,
[20:06] but it just encompasses the ministry.
[20:09] That's the ministry. That's the guys
[20:11] behind the pulpit. And it encompasses
[20:14] that
[20:16] for the perfecting of the saints, for
[20:19] the work of the ministry,
[20:23] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[20:27] till we all come in the unity of the
[20:29] faith.
[20:31] You can't have unity
[20:35] with just one person.
[20:37] You have to have to to achieve unity,
[20:41] you have to have something to work with
[20:43] that is not in unity yet. And then you
[20:46] bring it into unity. And that means
[20:49] there's different pieces of the puzzle.
[20:51] Every piece of the puzzle is shaped
[20:53] differently,
[20:55] but they're all just as important as the
[20:57] other one. Merely, if you're doing a
[20:58] puzzle and you have two pieces missing
[21:01] when you're finished, what's the what do
[21:03] you want to do? You look under the
[21:04] table. You look under the chairs. You
[21:06] got to find these two pieces. It's like
[21:08] it's not it's not finished. It doesn't
[21:10] look good. I need to find those two
[21:13] pieces. I'm one of those pieces in the
[21:15] ministry. All right. And I am part of
[21:19] the puzzle.
[21:21] And what God has called me to do is to
[21:24] bring them in.
[21:26] Bring them in. And that's why you see
[21:29] that my ministry is more attractive to a
[21:32] certain group of people as brother
[21:34] Brandham's was attractive to a certain
[21:35] group of people. Brother Brandham's
[21:38] ministry was not attractive to the
[21:41] northern
[21:42] Indiana
[21:44] uh Methodist people.
[21:47] It was just they were too they were very
[21:50] rigid in the way that they were. They
[21:52] wanted somebody up there reading the
[21:54] Bible and then saying a few words and
[21:57] then that was it. Brother Brandham was
[21:59] out there with the oneness apostolic
[22:01] oneness Pentecostals and he was bringing
[22:03] people to be prayed for. He said one
[22:05] time that he said that Billy Graham's
[22:08] group was up there and he said they were
[22:10] all the you know a lot of money and and
[22:12] these rich people and and he says then
[22:14] they started going out and here come my
[22:16] people and he's like the crippled and
[22:19] the lame and the poor and all of those
[22:22] people. They're the ones that came in
[22:25] for brother Brandham but really what
[22:28] about the people that gave their hearts
[22:29] to the Lord under Billy Graham? They're
[22:32] still a soul.
[22:34] They're just different. And here's me.
[22:38] And my ministry really is to those that,
[22:41] as the King James Bible says, those that
[22:43] are without, those that are outside,
[22:49] that we henceforth
[22:51] be no more children, tossed to and fro,
[22:56] and carried about with every wind of
[22:58] doctrine by the slate of men and cunning
[23:00] craftiness, whereby they lie in weight
[23:03] to deceive, but speaking the truth in
[23:06] love,
[23:08] Now, that is one thing that every
[23:10] ministry should have in common.
[23:13] You notice he doesn't separate just
[23:14] saying that just the evangelist has love
[23:17] or just the pastor has love. They all
[23:20] have love.
[23:22] but speaking the truth in love. And
[23:24] they're all speaking the truth.
[23:26] But speaking the truth in love may grow
[23:29] up into him in all things which is the
[23:33] head, even Christ.
[23:37] Everyone should be moving towards this
[23:42] head which is Jesus Christ. No matter if
[23:45] you're breaking down quotes of brother
[23:48] Brandham or you're reading the Psalms
[23:51] over here, everything should be pointing
[23:53] towards the head which is Christ.
[23:57] From whom? The whole body fitly joined
[24:00] together. So the body has all of these
[24:04] moving parts, but they fitly joined
[24:07] together and compacted by that which
[24:11] every joint supplieth according to the
[24:14] effectual working in the measure of
[24:16] every part. Every part. That's an
[24:19] important aspect of the scripture. The
[24:23] effectual working in every part. All
[24:27] right?
[24:28] Each moving part of an engine has a job.
[24:32] One of those parts break.
[24:36] Josiah had uh we fixed his truck I don't
[24:39] know months ago and nothing was working.
[24:43] It was stuck out in my driveway and and
[24:46] it it was just it was like the lights
[24:51] were on. it wouldn't start. It would
[24:54] turn over run, wouldn't start. And what
[24:57] it was is one of the battery terminals,
[25:01] there's there's the the post that the um
[25:05] attachment that goes onto the battery
[25:06] terminal, and then there's another
[25:08] attachment that goes into that post that
[25:11] both of these need power. Well, the
[25:13] small post that was going in on the
[25:17] positive side
[25:19] had some corrosion on it. just that
[25:21] little wire.
[25:23] We took it off. We cleaned it. Start it
[25:26] right up. That whole truck
[25:30] would not run because of that little
[25:31] wire. And that's how all of us are. We
[25:35] all have a role to play. And and Paul is
[25:38] saying here that every part, let's look
[25:42] at car parts. Every part is important.
[25:44] And if you don't have every part, the
[25:46] thing ain't gonna run.
[25:48] every part maketh increase of the body
[25:52] unto the edifying of itself once again
[25:55] in love.
[25:57] All right. Now I can answer I can we uh
[26:01] I wanted to get out here early. I can
[26:03] answer any questions. Is any questions
[26:05] friends? This is our small crowd. Any
[26:09] questions that are on your heart that I
[26:11] can answer?
[26:13] Brother Jordan, you're always the one
[26:14] that breaks the ice.
[26:18] Okay.
[26:20] Okay.
[26:21] Do you understand? So, when I'm up here
[26:24] and I'm preaching and I'm saying, "Get
[26:26] your nose in the Bible. Read the Bible."
[26:28] And I'm pointing to Jesus. And I'm
[26:29] saying, "Everything is to about him."
[26:31] And and and this Bible is the fullness.
[26:34] And you can't tell me that I can't
[26:36] preach this word that brother Brandham
[26:38] has to tell me what everything means.
[26:40] It's my ministry.
[26:43] And that brings in a certain group of
[26:45] people. That is not a ministry that
[26:49] brings in other people. It won't work
[26:52] for other groups.
[26:54] But every one of them is just as
[26:56] important.
[26:58] And every one of them is just as right
[27:00] in my opinion. That's why we should
[27:03] never because it and and I say this a
[27:06] lot. And now you know why. We should
[27:09] never condemn something that we don't
[27:12] understand.
[27:14] You with me?
[27:16] All right. We good? I hope I answered
[27:20] that question.
[27:22] Josiah
[27:28] just asked, "At what point does the
[27:31] church become wrong?" Let's use our
[27:32] church.
[27:36] I believe now I'm going to go back to
[27:38] the message for this
[27:40] that
[27:42] a church becomes wrong according to
[27:45] brother Brandham and the way that he
[27:46] taught a church becomes wrong when it
[27:49] organizes
[27:52] his ministry.
[27:54] I listen I still listen to him all the
[27:56] time.
[27:58] I've listened to him since I was born.
[28:01] I know it very very well.
[28:06] And the biggest point that brother
[28:09] Brandham made and he made it in almost
[28:12] every single sermon
[28:15] was against the denominations
[28:18] was against the denominational system.
[28:21] He used that scripture many times. Come
[28:24] out of her my people.
[28:26] And when we organize, what is
[28:29] organization now? How do how do we know
[28:31] when a church gets off? It's when we
[28:33] organize. It's when we say, "Now I am of
[28:38] Apollos."
[28:40] And here is what we teach and everyone
[28:42] else is wrong. To me, that is when a
[28:46] church gets off.
[28:48] That is when you move from the Holy
[28:50] Spirit into legalism and into false
[28:54] doctrines.
[28:56] That's in my opinion and I can back that
[28:58] one up over and over again with brother
[29:01] Brad.
[29:03] Any other questions?
[29:05] God bless you friends. I hope I hope
[29:07] that helped.
[29:09] You are a great blessing to me. I pray
[29:12] for you all the time.
[29:14] I I I think about you all the time and I
[29:19] um I can look in this and he gave some
[29:22] apostles and prophets, evangelists,
[29:24] pastors and teachers. I really think
[29:26] that the Lord called me to be a pastor
[29:29] to be able to
[29:31] um
[29:33] meet the needs of just this church
[29:37] and not go all over. Because if if I
[29:40] tried to go if I if I go to different
[29:42] places and I tried to minister the way I
[29:44] minister here, I don't think it would
[29:46] work all that good.
[29:49] Just it's a it's a different calling.
[29:52] Michael,
[30:01] we got a few song specials tonight. Uh
[30:05] excuse me, my sister Amelia can come up.
[30:07] We're going to sing a song and then um I
[30:09] believe she's got a song.

[30:18] moment.
[30:22] You calm my rageing
[30:25] sea.

[30:42] in
[30:44] you.

[30:51] you.

[31:01] I believe [music and singing]
[31:03] that you are all I need.
[31:10] [music]
[31:14] Oh, I believe [singing]
[31:17] [music] you're my portion.
[31:21] I believe you're more [singing] than
[31:25] enough for me.

[31:38] You hold my every moment.

[32:13] in [singing]
[32:14] you.
[32:18] Oh, I believe [singing]
[32:21] you're my healer.

[32:38] And I believe [singing]
[32:40] you're my portion.
[32:45] I believe [singing]
[32:47] you're more [music] than enough for me.
[32:53] And Jesus, you're all I need.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. You probably heard me
[33:04] a few times saying that I'm looking for
[33:06] a city. Well, guess what? I found that
[33:09] city and one day I will be going there.
[33:32] I'm going
[33:36] I am going to a city
[33:43] where the streets [music and singing]
[33:46] are golden
[33:51] Where the tree of life is
[33:54] [music and singing] blooming
[33:58] and the [singing] roses never fade.
[34:05] Here they [singing] bloom [music] by for
[34:08] a season.
[34:11] Soon their [music] beauty is decay.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; [music]
[34:18] &gt;&gt; I [singing] am going to a city
[34:25] where the roses never fade. [singing]
[34:32] In this world we have our trles.
[34:38] Satan snares we [singing] must evade.
[34:41] [music]
[34:45] We will free from all temptations.
[34:51] Where the roses never [singing] fade,
[34:58] here they bloom [singing] before a
[35:01] season.
[35:04] Soon their beauty is decay.
[35:11] I am going to a city
[35:17] where the roses never fade.
[35:24] Love
[35:25] gone [music] to be with Jesus [singing]
[35:30] in the robes of wide array.
[35:36] They are waiting for my cup.
[35:43] Where the roses never fade,
[35:49] here they bloom before a season.
[35:54] [singing]
[35:56] Soon their beauty is decay.
[36:02] I am going to a city
[36:08] where the roses never fade.
[36:15] Where the [singing] roses never fade.
[36:25] Amen. I might read a couple scriptures
[36:27] between every song.
[36:30] Um, Elizabeth, I want to go back to your
[36:32] question and and I might, who knows, I
[36:35] might just keep keep doing this. The
[36:37] book of Galatians,
[36:40] what happened here? Galatians chapter 2,
[36:44] verse number two. What's going on here?
[36:47] This is also in the book of Acts. So,
[36:49] Galatians and Acts, there's a certain
[36:50] part that they're happening at the same
[36:52] time. There were two men that came from
[36:56] Jerusalem in James's church. James was
[36:59] the pastor of the church at Jerusalem.
[37:01] These are Christians. These are Jewish
[37:03] Christians. And they saw things a
[37:05] certain way. All right. Paul was very
[37:10] much like me in his doctrine. Very
[37:14] similar. It was
[37:17] um anti-legalism.
[37:20] But that doesn't mean James was not
[37:22] right.
[37:24] James was just as right as Paul was. So
[37:27] it says here James or uh Galatians
[37:29] chapter 2. And I went up by revelation
[37:31] and communicated with them
[37:33] that
[37:35] gospel which I preach among the
[37:37] Gentiles, but privately to them which
[37:40] are were of reputation, I believe that
[37:41] means the Jews,
[37:43] lest by any means I should run or had
[37:46] run in vain. But neither Titus, now
[37:49] Titus was a Greek, all right? He's not a
[37:51] Jew. Neither Titus was with me. Oh,
[37:55] right there it says being a Greek was
[37:57] compelled to be circumcised.
[38:00] All right,
[38:04] that's a big deal.
[38:07] Huge
[38:08] deal that how come if you are a
[38:13] believer,
[38:14] how come you have not been circumcised
[38:17] or how come you dress this way or how
[38:19] come um you have this way of thinking?
[38:23] All right. And that's what Paul is
[38:25] saying here. He's saying that Titus
[38:29] didn't want to be circumcised. Now,
[38:30] Timothy did,
[38:32] but Titus said no.
[38:35] And that because of false brethren. Now,
[38:37] you see Paul, remember I said being
[38:40] defensive. Now, watch what Paul is
[38:42] saying here. But neither Titus who was
[38:44] with me being a Greek was compelled to
[38:46] be circumcised. And because of those
[38:48] false brethren, unawares, brought in,
[38:52] who came in privy to spy out our
[38:55] liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus,
[38:58] that they might bring us unto bondage,
[39:01] back under bondage. What does that mean?
[39:04] It's like, listen, we are not under the
[39:05] law. We are we we are not following the
[39:08] rules. We're not doing that. That's
[39:10] good, but that is not this church is
[39:12] what Paul is saying here. James is like,
[39:14] no, you have to do that.
[39:17] You have to honor the feast days. You
[39:19] have to uh be circumcised. You have to
[39:22] do that. But do you see the two
[39:24] different gifts in operation? You have
[39:26] James, the pastor of the church at
[39:28] Jerusalem, traditional. And then you
[39:31] have Paul over here who knew the
[39:34] scriptures very very well, but his
[39:37] perspective was different than that of
[39:40] James. So who was right?
[39:43] They were both right. But Paul couldn't
[39:46] have preached his doctrine in James'
[39:48] church. And neither and see you see
[39:51] right here. And later on it says then
[39:53] then Peter totally didn't didn't have a
[39:57] backbone in this. Peter was with the
[39:59] Gentiles one night. Oh, and then these
[40:00] two guys from from James's church showed
[40:03] up, which is probably where Pet where
[40:04] Peter went to church. These two guys
[40:06] from James' church showed up and he's
[40:08] like, "Oh no, I can't eat with the
[40:09] Gentiles because they're unclean."
[40:11] I was like, "Yeah, last night you were
[40:13] eating with them." So, there's two
[40:16] different doctrines, two different
[40:17] perspectives on this. Both are right.
[40:23] I really want to just preach on this for
[40:26] a long time. That's a song service. Go
[40:28] ahead. Go ahead.
[40:34] I believe sister
[40:37] Hope has a song as well. We're going to
[40:38] sing another song and she can make her
[40:40] way up.
[40:45] I know who I am
[40:50] cuz I know who you are.
[40:55] The cross of salvation [singing]
[41:00] was only [music and singing]
[41:02] the start.
[41:06] Now I am chosen,
[41:11] free and forgiven.
[41:16] I have a future
[41:21] and it's worth living.
[41:27] Cuz I wasn't made to be tending a
[41:31] [singing] grave. I was called by name,
[41:36] born and raised back to life again.
[41:41] I was made for more. [singing]
[41:46] [music]
[41:48] So why would I make a bed in my [music]
[41:52] shame when a fountain of grace is
[41:56] running my way? I know I [singing] am
[42:00] yours and I was made for more. [music]
[42:08] I know who I am
[42:13] cuz I know who you are. [singing]
[42:18] The cross of salvation
[42:23] was [music and singing] only the start.
[42:29] Now I am chosen,
[42:32] [singing]
[42:34] free and forgi.
[42:39] Oh, I have a future
[42:44] and it's worth living.
[42:51] Cuz I wasn't [singing] made to be
[42:54] tending a grave. I was called by name,
[42:59] born and raised back to life again.
[43:04] I was made for more.
[43:11] So why would I make a bed in my shame
[43:16] when a fountain of [music] grace is
[43:20] running my way? I know I am yours and I
[43:25] was [singing] made for more. [music]
[43:33] Hallelujah.
[43:37] You called out my [music] name, so I'll
[43:40] sing out your praise.
[43:43] Hallelu.
[43:48] You [music] buried my past and I'm not
[43:51] going back.
[43:53] Hallelujah.
[43:58] You called out my [singing] name, so
[44:01] I'll sing out your [music] praise.
[44:04] Hallelu.
[44:06] [singing]
[44:08] You buried [music] my past, so I'm not
[44:12] going [singing] back.
[44:16] I wasn't made to be tending a grave. I
[44:21] was called by name. Born and raised back
[44:26] to life again.
[44:29] I was made for more. [singing and music]
[44:37] So why [music and singing] would I make
[44:39] a bed in my shame when a fountain of
[44:43] grace is running my way? I know I am
[44:48] yours and I was made for more.
[45:09] Please sing this with me. I'm sorry.
[45:17] The love of God
[45:22] is [music] greater
[45:28] than [singing] tongue or pill.
[45:34] [music]
[45:40] It goes beyond
[45:46] the The high star
[45:52] and kiss
[45:58] the [music] Lord still
[46:03] the guilty
[46:09] bow down with care.
[46:15] God gave his son
[46:21] to
[46:22] him
[46:26] his
[46:28] child.
[46:31] He [music] reconcile
[46:34] you
[46:37] and
[46:43] he
[46:48] oh love of God.
[46:54] How rich, how pure, [music]
[46:59] how meous
[47:06] and strong.
[47:10] It shall
[47:16] ever more endure.
[47:21] My saints [music]
[47:23] and angels
[47:29] sing
[47:33] when worry [music] times
[47:38] shall pass away
[47:43] and earthly thrones
[47:49] and [music] kingoms.
[47:55] When you hear
[48:00] [music]
[48:00] refuse [singing]
[48:02] to pray
[48:06] on rocks and [music] hills
[48:11] and mountain
[48:17] love so
[48:22] shall still endure. [music]
[48:28] Oh major
[48:34] and strong
[48:39] redeeing grace
[48:44] to [music]
[48:45] Adam's race
[48:50] the saints [music]
[48:51] and
[49:01] Oh love of God,
[49:06] how rich, how pure,
[49:12] how great
[49:18] and strong.
[49:23] It shall forever
[49:29] more endure
[49:34] the saints and
[49:40] gent
[49:45] [music]
[49:47] with
[49:51] the Ocean
[49:56] [music]
[49:56] and
[49:58] the skies
[50:02] of parchment made [music]
[50:13] on earth [singing]
[50:14] a queen
[50:19] And every
[50:26] day
[50:29] to write the love
[50:34] of God above.
[50:40] We dream.
[50:51] Or could the scroll
[50:56] contain
[50:58] the
[51:02] stretched from sky
[51:07] to sky?
[51:12] Oh love of God,
[51:17] how rich, how
[51:37] &gt;&gt; [music]
[51:54] &gt;&gt; True. True.
[52:05] Did you put that that verse up there? If
[52:08] we could ink or if we
[52:12] could
[52:14] be with ink, the ocean fell.
[52:17] Every man ascribed by trade to write the
[52:19] love of God above.
[52:25] Could we with ink the ocean filled? And
[52:28] were the skies of parchment made, and
[52:31] every stock on earth aquill, and every
[52:34] man ascribed by trade. To write the love
[52:37] of God above drain the ocean dry, nor
[52:41] could the scroll contain the whole
[52:44] stretched from sky to sky.
[52:48] Can you
[52:50] what words?
[52:53] I know that we could never write in
[52:55] words that could truly describe the love
[52:58] of God, but those are about the best
[53:00] I've ever seen.
[53:02] The story behind that
[53:05] is they were nobody knows the author of
[53:08] that verse that it was written on the
[53:11] wall of an insane institution.
[53:14] Um,
[53:17] Mr. Hope, thank you. So [snorts] great.
[53:19] So great. Oh,
[53:22] Brother Jordan sent me a another
[53:25] question.
[53:27] And uh Ephesians 4:11, he gave some
[53:30] apostles and some prophets, some
[53:32] evangelists, some teachers, pastors and
[53:34] teachers.
[53:37] I mentioned in passing, and brother
[53:39] Jordan is very sharp. He listens to
[53:42] everything that some people misinterpret
[53:46] that. And I think that they do.
[53:49] I've heard
[53:51] that the five-fold ministry
[53:55] takes the place of brother Brandham into
[53:58] the future. I've heard that many, many
[54:01] times that now it's the five-fold
[54:03] ministry that carries on this.
[54:07] You can never replace Brother Brand.
[54:10] Never.
[54:12] He came
[54:14] to fill a very very important role and
[54:18] no one should ever try to carry on
[54:22] um try to take his place. You just can't
[54:24] do it. He was something special. He was
[54:28] just different.
[54:30] But we are called in the ministry to
[54:33] preach this gospel and to
[54:38] lift up Jesus Christ. And brother
[54:41] Jordan, that's what I meant when I said
[54:43] that is no. I don't think so. I don't
[54:47] think any of us could ever replace that
[54:49] man.
[54:51] Thank you very much.
[55:39] I searched the world,
[55:44] but it couldn't fill me.
[55:50] Man's empty place and treasures of faith
[55:54] [music]
[55:55] are never enough.
[56:01] Then you [music] came along
[56:06] and put me back together.
[56:12] And every desire
[56:14] is now satisfied
[56:17] hearing [music]
[56:18] your love.
[56:23] Oh, there's [singing] nothing
[56:26] better than you, [music] Lord. There's
[56:29] nothing
[56:32] better than you, Lord. There's nothing
[56:37] nothing [music and singing]
[56:38] is better than you.
[56:43] And I'm not afraid
[56:48] to show you [music and singing] my
[56:50] weakness.
[56:53] Oh my failures and faults.
[56:55] [music and singing] Lord, you seem all
[56:58] and you still call me flame.
[57:03] Cuz the God on the mountains
[57:09] is a God in [music and singing] the
[57:11] valleyies.
[57:14] And there's not a place [music] your
[57:17] mercy and grace won't find me again.
[57:25] Oh, there's nothing
[57:29] better than you, Lord. There's nothing
[57:34] better than you, Lord.
[57:36] [music and singing] There's nothing
[57:39] nothing is better than you.
[57:46] Oh, [music] there's nothing
[57:49] better than you, [singing] Lord. There's
[57:52] nothing
[57:54] better [music] than you, Lord. There's
[57:56] [singing] nothing,
[57:59] nothing [music] is better than you.
[58:07] You [music] turn morning [singing]
[58:09] to dancing.
[58:12] You give beauty for ashes.
[58:15] [music and singing]
[58:17] You turn shame into glory.
[58:21] You're the only [music] one who can.
[58:27] You turn mourning [singing]
[58:28] [music] to dancing.
[58:32] You give beauty for ashes.
[58:37] You turn shame [music and singing] into
[58:39] glory.
[58:41] You're the only one who can.
[58:46] [music]
[58:47] You turn graves [singing]
[58:48] into gardens.
[58:52] You turn bones [music and singing] into
[58:53] aries.
[58:56] You turn seas into highways.
[59:00] You're the only one who can.
[59:05] You're the only one [music and singing]
[59:07] who cares.
[59:12] Oh, there's [singing] nothing [music]
[59:16] better than you, Lord. There's [singing]
[59:19] nothing
[59:21] better than you, Lord. There's nothing
[59:27] nothing is better [music and singing]
[59:29] than you.
[59:34] Oh, there's [singing] nothing
[59:37] better than you, Lord.
[59:39] [music and singing] There's nothing
[59:43] better than you, Lord. There's
[59:45] [singing and music] nothing
[59:48] Nothing is better than you.

[1:00:04] I Claim the blood and then she can make
[1:00:06] ready while we're singing that.
[1:00:12] I have
[1:00:15] a source
[1:00:18] of strength. When I am weak,
[1:00:24] [music]
[1:00:26] it takes me through.
[1:00:31] When life is pressing [music] in,
[1:00:38] oh, I have a source
[1:00:43] of power from above.
[1:00:50] Oh, I'm covered [singing] over

[1:01:38] [music]
[1:01:40] When I need healing, [singing]

[1:01:56] how others
[1:01:59] make it through
[1:02:04] who never go

[1:02:11] as I do.
[1:02:16] Or there the he

[1:02:44] that Jesus shed on Calary. [music]

[1:02:57] [music] were made just for me. [singing]

[1:09:42] me [music and singing] near.
[1:09:45] Draw me to your side.
[1:09:52] And as [singing]
[1:09:55] I wait, I'll rise up like
[1:09:58] [singing and music] an eagle.
[1:10:03] And I will soar with you.

[1:10:34] in me.
[1:10:42] Lord, renew my mind
[1:10:46] as your will unfolds

[1:11:29] And as
[1:11:31] I [singing] wait, I'll rise up like an
[1:11:35] eagle.
[1:11:38] [singing]
[1:11:39] and I will soar with you. Your spirit
[1:11:43] leads [music] me on to the power of your
[1:11:47] love.
[1:11:58] Ecclesiastes 12 verse 13. Let us hear
[1:12:01] the conclusion of the whole matter. Fear
[1:12:04] God and keep his commandments for this
[1:12:06] is man's all. For God will bring every
[1:12:09] work into judgment, including every
[1:12:12] secret thing, whether good or evil.
[1:12:16] Go ahead and put that first verse up
[1:12:17] there.
[1:12:22] All the things that I've held dear,
[1:12:26] the vanities that whispered in my ear,
[1:12:32] what would I do if they all disappear?
[1:12:35] [music]
[1:12:40] Riches and fame, all that they could
[1:12:43] buy, have come to find. They never
[1:12:46] satisfy.
[1:12:49] What would I gain if my soul's the
[1:12:52] prize?
[1:12:58] I don't want to love what the world
[1:13:00] loves.
[1:13:02] I don't want to chase what the world
[1:13:05] does.
[1:13:06] I only want you.
[1:13:10] I only want you.
[1:13:15] First things first, seek your will, not
[1:13:20] my own. Surrender all my wants to you.
[1:13:28] To keep the first things first,
[1:13:33] to live your truth. Walk your ways. Set
[1:13:38] my eyes. Lord, I fix my face on you.
[1:13:45] All my desires reversed
[1:13:49] to keep the first [music] things first.
[1:13:56] I give it all my life an offering.
[1:14:00] My heart is yours, so have your way in
[1:14:04] me.
[1:14:06] Lord, your kingdom's all I want to seek.
[1:14:10] I don't want to love.
[1:14:14] I don't want to love what the world
[1:14:17] loves. [singing]
[1:14:18] [music] I don't want to chase what the
[1:14:21] world does. I only want you. [singing]
[1:14:26] [music]
[1:14:27] I only want you.
[1:14:31] So, first things first, I seek your
[1:14:35] will, not my [music] own. Surrender
[1:14:39] [singing] all my wants to you.
[1:14:44] Keep the first things first,
[1:14:48] to live [music] your truth, walk your
[1:14:52] ways, set my eyes. Lord, I fix my face
[1:14:58] on [music] you.
[1:15:01] All my desires reversed
[1:15:05] to keep the first things first. Let's
[1:15:08] sing that chorus again. First things
[1:15:11] first, I seek your will, not [singing]
[1:15:15] my own. Surrender all my wants [music]
[1:15:19] to you.
[1:15:22] Keep the first things first
[1:15:27] to live your truth. Walk your [music]
[1:15:30] ways. Set my eyes. Lord, I fix my face
[1:15:36] on [music] you.
[1:15:40] My desires reversed
[1:15:44] to keep the first things first.
[1:15:51] to keep the first things first.
[1:16:08] Let's stand and sing this song. Um,
[1:16:10] we'll sing this [music] and then I'll
[1:16:11] turn it over to brother Dan.
[1:16:17] In and out of situations,
[1:16:25] that tug of war and me. [music]
[1:16:32] All day long I struggle
[1:16:38] for the answers [music and singing] that
[1:16:40] I need.
[1:16:44] Then I come into his presence.
[1:16:51] All my [music] questions become
[1:16:53] [singing] clear.
[1:16:57] And for a sacred moment,
[1:17:01] [singing]
[1:17:03] no doubt [music] can interfere.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; was in the presence
[1:17:17] of Jehovah [singing]
[1:17:23] God Almighty.
[1:17:27] [music]
[1:17:30] Prince [singing]
[1:17:31] of peace,
[1:17:33] [music]
[1:17:36] trles,
[1:17:42] and hearts are men [singing]
[1:17:49] in the [music and singing] presence
[1:17:55] of the king. [music]
[1:18:00] Through his love, the Lord provided
[1:18:07] a place for us to rest.
[1:18:13] A place to find [music] the
[1:18:16] answers.
[1:18:19] In [music] the hours of distress,
[1:18:25] there is never any reason
[1:18:31] to give up [music and singing] in
[1:18:33] despair.
[1:18:37] Just slip away and breathe [music]
[1:18:40] his name. [singing]
[1:18:43] He will surely meet you there.
[1:18:50] in the presence
[1:18:56] of Jehovah, [singing]
[1:19:00] [music]
[1:19:02] God Almighty, [singing]
[1:19:08] Prince of [singing] Peace,
[1:19:15] trles,
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; And hearts are mened
[1:19:27] in the presence [music]
[1:19:33] of the king.
[1:19:39] That's ultimately where we all want to
[1:19:41] be
[1:19:43] is in the presence of the king.
[1:19:46] Hope you enjoyed service tonight. I
[1:19:48] really did. Just I love that song. I
[1:19:50] just man
[1:19:52] first time I heard that song I remember
[1:19:54] it was on um on YouTube and it just
[1:19:58] actually Stephanie showed me that that
[1:20:01] video. She really liked it and it was
[1:20:04] really really a blessing. Thank you.
[1:20:05] Thanks to everybody. Sister Hope that
[1:20:08] song just rips my heart out of me is
[1:20:10] just the love of God.
[1:20:14] England. The Lord's blessed us that we
[1:20:16] can worship him together. I hope that my
[1:20:20] answers helped a little bit the
[1:20:23] questions. My calling, friends, is this
[1:20:27] book right here.
[1:20:31] That's maybe the Lord's given me a
[1:20:34] little niche in all of this great this
[1:20:37] great economy of God for a Bible
[1:20:40] teacher. And I believe that's what he's
[1:20:42] called me to do. Brother Ron Gladwell,
[1:20:45] would you come up and close in prayer?
[1:20:51] Please,
[1:20:53] when you're praying this week, pray for
[1:20:54] our meetings. I believe the enemy
[1:20:58] um doesn't want us to have them. So
[1:21:02] please keep keep this week in prayer
[1:21:05] [music] that
[1:21:07] what I want. If I could have something
[1:21:10] that would give us some souls that would
[1:21:12] maybe come to this altar or give their
[1:21:15] hearts to the Lord this weekend, I think
[1:21:17] that would be just so great and so
[1:21:20] fitting. Brother Ron
[1:21:38] I don't want his job.
[1:21:42] My what a tough place.
[1:21:47] U I think all of us have our own ideas
[1:21:49] and how we think it should be. But
[1:21:54] my what where he stands I sure wouldn't
[1:21:58] want to be there. It takes a special
[1:22:00] gift for that.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; I believe he's sincere.
[1:22:06] And if I think he's went off in error, I
[1:22:09] told him, I pray for him.
[1:22:13] I know I'm never always right.
[1:22:16] But, you know, Jesus is always right.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; We all have our gift. I I have a pretty
[1:22:24] good idea what mine is.
[1:22:26] It's to stick around, endure, and remind
[1:22:29] you
[1:22:31] of things that are in my life. I mean, I
[1:22:35] can tell other stories, but why don't I
[1:22:38] do I have a story?
[1:22:40] And when I say this, I want you to think
[1:22:42] about your story. Every son and daughter
[1:22:46] of God should have their own testimony.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; You must have your own experience.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Every single one of you should be able
[1:22:56] to come up here and start talking until
[1:22:58] he tells you to stop.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; I'm just kidding.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; I'll never stop. I'll just pause for a
[1:23:08] little while.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; But you know, it it it's that way.
[1:23:15] He works with us all differently. We
[1:23:17] don't understand it, but we have to
[1:23:19] trust God.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And as we pray, you know, it it it
[1:23:24] behooves us to find, and this is what I
[1:23:28] I do. You must find time alone.
[1:23:33] Find out who God is. Ask him.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Don't take my word for it. Don't take
[1:23:40] his word. But
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; He gives you good advice.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; I honestly believe that God is with me.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I honestly believe I don't
[1:23:51] understand everything, [laughter]
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; but I know that Paul said to do
[1:23:57] everything in decency
[1:24:00] and respect and honor.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; And I think we should treat each other
[1:24:05] that way.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:07] a personal testimony.
[1:24:09] I'm not bringing them in by the groves,
[1:24:11] but I'll tell you what,
[1:24:15] if something was to happen, I am
[1:24:17] persuaded
[1:24:20] and he would preach my funeral.
[1:24:25] My neighbors would be there.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; We walk every day. We know them all by
[1:24:31] name.
[1:24:34] And you know what?
[1:24:36] I've learned to love them and they like
[1:24:40] me. I had a a man for Christmas. I
[1:24:43] didn't He brings over about $100 worth
[1:24:45] of gifts. He said, "I just appreciate
[1:24:48] you, neighbor."
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; You know, that's our testimony. You
[1:24:54] know, go around your neighborhood, meet
[1:24:57] your neighbors,
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; get to know them. They're real people.
[1:25:00] Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; I seen a lady walking the other day and
[1:25:03] I just stopped and talked to her for a
[1:25:05] minute and she expressed some dilemma
[1:25:08] and I I gave her some advice. Two days
[1:25:10] later, she says, "Oh, by the way, I did
[1:25:12] what you said. Thank you."
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; I I think we have a job to do. We a life
[1:25:21] to live.
[1:25:24] And as far as these disagreements,
[1:25:26] contentions, it it happens in families,
[1:25:29] but we're family,
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; we're family,
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; brother. I'm not going anywhere.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to heaven, but
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; you [laughter]
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; can we pray?
[1:25:50] Oh God,
[1:25:52] I pray Lord that you have.
[1:25:56] Fill me with your spirit.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; I know, oh God, and I confess before
[1:26:01] these people, I am not the same person I
[1:26:04] used to be.
[1:26:06] I was witness to a little lady there the
[1:26:09] other day, Lord, and she said she had
[1:26:12] received you.
[1:26:14] And I told her, I says, "You know,
[1:26:18] I knew your sister in high school." I
[1:26:20] says, "She probably wouldn't even talk
[1:26:21] to me." And I told her, I says, "You
[1:26:24] know, I'm just not that same person.
[1:26:27] I'm just not." She wouldn't recognize
[1:26:29] me.
[1:26:31] And I and this little woman just started
[1:26:35] crying.
[1:26:36] She says, "I have a same testimony." She
[1:26:39] says, "Maybe you and your wife could
[1:26:42] come over and we will exchange
[1:26:44] testimonies."
[1:26:46] These times, oh God, that we interact
[1:26:49] with each human being that we encounter.
[1:26:54] Let it be a time, Lord, that we we reach
[1:26:58] out in love, Lord, to draw them in to
[1:27:01] you.
[1:27:03] Fill us, oh God.
[1:27:05] Make us salty,
[1:27:08] Father. I thank you for this place. I
[1:27:11] thank you for these people. Most of all,
[1:27:14] I thank you for your Holy Spirit and
[1:27:17] your wisdom and your guidance to teach
[1:27:20] us when to speak and when to be silent.
[1:27:25] I am just so grateful, Lord. I I feel
[1:27:29] your spirit here with us tonight, and I
[1:27:32] am thankful you have felt honored to be
[1:27:35] among us. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:27:39] As we go to our different places, would
[1:27:41] you guide and protect each one as they
[1:27:43] return to their homes? May they remember
[1:27:47] the good things.
[1:27:50] And Lord, may they look to increase
[1:27:54] their experience with you
[1:27:57] and seek you with all their hearts and
[1:28:01] love you and love each and every one of
[1:28:03] us. I thank you Lord for this
[1:28:05] opportunity
[1:28:07] to confess you to my brothers and
[1:28:09] sisters
[1:28:11] and I ask that you would just continue
[1:28:13] to increase in me and these brothers and
[1:28:17] sisters until your coming and call us
[1:28:19] away.
[1:28:21] I ask this in the precious name
[1:28:24] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:28:29] Amen.
[1:28:51] He's got it all in control.
[1:28:58] He's got it all in [music] control.
[1:29:02] [singing]
[1:29:05] He's put that reassur
[1:29:10] way down in my soul.
[1:29:16] He's got it all in control.
[1:29:23] I put my life [singing]
[1:29:26] in his hands.
[1:29:31] I put my life [singing]
[1:29:33] in his hands.
[1:29:37] So every road I walk down, I'm sure is
[1:29:42] in his plans.
[1:29:47] I put my life [singing]
[1:29:49] in his hands.
[1:29:54] My father knows what I need.
[1:30:01] My father knows [singing] what I need.
[1:30:08] And everything I go through, he knows
[1:30:12] what's best for me. [music]
[1:30:18] My father [singing] knows what I need.
[1:30:23] Amen. Ron said it. There's a spirit
[1:30:27] here. Sister Elizabeth,
[1:30:30] that's that evening spirit when we come
[1:30:34] together. That's what fills that void is
[1:30:36] what we feel right now. It's just
[1:30:38] different. It's just these solid
[1:30:40] believers that come together in unity
[1:30:45] and just in worship and loving one
[1:30:47] another.
[1:30:49] Sister Hope, [music] I thinking of
[1:30:53] how could someone say it better than
[1:30:56] that song that you sang.
[1:30:58] Who shall separate us from the love of
[1:31:01] Christ?
[1:31:02] shall tribulation
[1:31:04] or distress or persecution or famine or
[1:31:07] nakedness or peril or sword. As it is
[1:31:10] written, for thy sake we are killed all
[1:31:12] the day long. We are accounted as sheep
[1:31:14] for the slaughter. Nay, in all things we
[1:31:17] are more than conquerors through him
[1:31:19] that loved us. For I [music] am
[1:31:21] persuaded
[1:31:23] that neither death nor life, nor angels,
[1:31:26] nor principalities, nor powers, nor
[1:31:28] things present, nor things to come, nor
[1:31:30] height, nor depth, nor any other
[1:31:33] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:31:36] from the love of God, which is in Christ
[1:31:38] Jesus our Lord.
[1:31:41] Praise God. You're dismissed. I hope to
[1:31:44] see you on Wednesday. We're going to
[1:31:45] play that sermon. What house will you
[1:31:46] build me? Wednesday night. God bless
[1:31:48] you.
