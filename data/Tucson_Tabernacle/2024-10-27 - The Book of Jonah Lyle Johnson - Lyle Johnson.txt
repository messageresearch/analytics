kids gather around I'm going to tell you a story all about a man named Jonah y there was a man named Jonah a prophet of the Lord he was going down the road one day when the voice of God he heard the Lord said unto Jonah to Nineveh you must go and tell to them my message for I have told you so Kenneth do you think Jonah did what he was supposed to do I don't know well listen real close down to the city of japa went Jonah running from the presence of the Lord sing sing it with me you guys city of so Jonah bought a ticket to sale Far Far Away what a nice vacation I will have the sailors heard him say the Sun was shining bright the sky was blue and clear but one thing Jonah didn't think the Lord was oh so near down from heaven came a storm so mighty blowing so hard upon the sea Ready set [Music] go so the Sea The Little ship was sinking the captain said to pray so they all Drew lots to find which man was the cause of such a day well the lot fell upon Jonah they cried what must we do throw me to the water and this storm will be through down in the belly of the fish went Jonah down to the bottom of the sea your turn down in the belly of fish Jonah down to the bottom of the sea now Jonah was in trouble he thought that he was through how he wish that he had done the things that God had told him to so Jonah started praying and then at God's command that fish Rose from the bottom and swam right to dry land up from the belly of the fish came Jonah tumbling out upon the SE Jonah just came right out of the fish's mouth yep up from the belly of the fish came Jonah tumbling out upon the sand again God spoke to Jonah and this time he obeyed to the city called Nineveh he quickly made his way he cried to them of judgment unless they changed their ways in sack cloth they repented and peaceful were their days down from heaven came God's dear Mercy Mercy to all who will believe down from heaven came God's dear Mercy Mercy is that a true story sure [Music] is and that

a bit to Jonah I think and uh it was going through my mind when I thought about all this this evening and i' just like to read it to you before I tell you a little bit about this uh this song they that go down to the Sea and ships that do business in Great Waters these see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the Deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves they mount up to the heaven they go down to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wits end then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their stresses he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men about a week ago I was uh having a hard time going to asleep and and a tune started just going through my head very similar to the chorus of what we just sang and it just kept going through my head and going through my head and oh so I got up and tried to grunt a little bit into a microphone and and capture sort of what was going on and there were words that were kind of in the background there that were coming along and so I wrote those down too and and then uh I I shared my grunting with uh sister Martha and she she put it to music and so by God's grace I want to try and find the right space maybe even on the keys this time I'm usually between them somewhere and and try and and and sing this song I'll put the words up for you it's it's very simple what you would expect okay we'll [Music] try I want to sing how I got that wrong I want to sing still got yeah shout Lord

we're all going to be there I'm trusting in that I'm believing that and I don't want to miss one of you thank you so much thank good evening on Wednesday's evenings we've been going through the books of the Bible as our Pastor Daniel has told us we're breaking the pattern a little bit tonight and we're going to have a short lesson from the Book of Jonah before we open our Bibles to look at this book Let's approach the Lord one more time in prayer together Lord Jesus it's such an honor Lord that we can be gathered together in your name in this place at this time to worship you to praise you to read your word to listen for you to speak to us Lord to answer questions to answer needs to touch hearts Lord to just move by your spirit in our midst as our desire Lord that you would accept our worship our praise our singing the thoughts of a heart be pleasing to you forgive us Lord of everything that's been incorrect in our life today Lord every sin every way that we have missed the mark and Lord forgive us place it under the blood of Jesus Christ and let us come before you pure and holy through your righteousness through your sacrifice through what you have done for us by your grace and your love Lord we commit the remainder of this service into your hands Lord help me to not cause anyone to stumble not to misspeak Lord and Lord if I say something wrong Lord anoint the ears that hear Lord that they'll receive it in the way that it's intended Lord we commit this to you and Lord all we can do is fall on our knees and thank you for all that you've done in Jesus precious name amen while you're standing and for our opening first verses I'd like to read two short accounts now if you've been here on Wednesdays you know that they're not going to be from Jonah the first is going to be from Genesis the second will be from the gospel of Matthew now the Book of Jonah focuses geographically on the Assyrian capital city of Nineveh in Genesis 10 Noah his sons and their wives have exited the ark After the flood we're given an account of Noah's sons and their descendants did I hit the wrong button technical difficulty there we are now these are the generations of the sons of Noah and I've highlighted Shem and ham because they play a part in our story of Jonah tonight Shem ham and yaet and unto them were Sons born After the flood verse six and the sons of ham Kush and misraim and F and Canan and Kush begat Nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the earth and the beginning of nimrod's kingdom was Babel and ER and aad and khna all in the land of shinar what we think of was Mesopotamia or modern day Iraq and out of that land Shar or Mesopotamia went forth Asher and builded Nineveh and the City of roobot and Kalah okay so you ask yourself who's Asher well going back to Noah's sons they're children of Noah's son Shem Alm and Asher and araxid and L and Aram from this we see that Nineveh was a very an ancient city one of the first mentioned After the flood it was located in the area we think of as Mesopotamia it was founded by Asher which is the Hebrew word for Assyria when you read in your Bible and it says Assyria the word is Asher this gentleman's name Assyria meaning prosperous or successful just a a little fun fact here in in the ruins of a library found in one of the first archaeological digs in what would prove to be Nineveh in 1853 was a set CL tablets and they contain the Epic of gilgames you you may have heard of that it includes a story about the Earth being destroyed by a flood and the tablet with that portion of the story is known as the flood tablet which you see here excavated from the ruins of Nineveh now from the gospel of Matthew Jesus is being challenged by his detractors Matthew 12 you read then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master meaning teacher show us a sign we would see a sign from thee and Jesus answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous meaning worshiping the wrong thing evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign there shall no sign be given to it to you he's in their face right now but the sign of the prophet Jonah for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the and the whale's belly the Greek word means a big sea creature with a gaping mouth Jonah was three days and three nights so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this evil and adulterous generation and shall condemn it he's going to these guys that we're going to hear about tonight are going to condemn you scribes and Pharisees because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold Jesus says look at me Behold a greater than Jonas is here please be seated I'm I'm sure their knees got weak and they were seated too we've been studying through the Bible and we're now in the area of the Bible that we call the minor prophet Jonah is fifth among this group and they're just called minor because of the short writings that they left not because of the lack of importance of what they said Jonah is one of only two books of the Minor Prophets The Other being n that deal not with Israel or Judah or an Empire like Egypt or Babylon or a neighboring Nation like Edom but with a single Gentile City and they both deal with the same city Nineveh we know very little about Jonah the Book of Jonah is four short chapters a total of only 48 verses the only other reference to him in the Old Testament is a oneliner that tells us where he was from a place called gath heer though separated by Jesus from some 700 years he was from the same part of the Galilee he wasn't from Jerusalem or some place like that he would have been a neighbor of Jesus if they'd lived in the same day I'm going to try and show you some of the many parallels between Jonah and Jesus one of the reasons or purposes of our brief overviews of the books of the Old Testament has been to see where Jesus is portrayed prophesied or otherwise present and we're pressed for time this evening I I was given 20 minutes and remember that when I did did the psalm and sang the song that didn't count against the 20 minutes so we're going to get right into this book okay so here's an overview the topics of the Book of Jonah it's a story of the Lord sending Jonah to a gentile City and if you fall asleep as long as you heard that song that the Petersons did you've got the book okay so I'm I'm just filling in a little bit in between the lines for you here it's a story of the Lord sending Jonah to a gentile City Nineveh Jonah thought it was all about judgment and destruction on a terrible Place God knew it was about demonstrating his mercy and kindness his grace to those willing to repent and reform to change their ways and to show that such Grace was not limited to the descendants of Jacob so the first thing we read here is Jonah flees the presence of the Lord was now we'll start reading from Jonah 1:1 now the word of the Lord came into Jonah the son of amiti saying arise go to Nineveh that great large Mighty proud city cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me must have been pretty wicked for out of all the world this to come to send a prophet here we see the Lord is sending a Jewish Prophet to a gentile City we're given its name told it's a very large city and that the wickedness of it is Extreme and the Lord wants the people there to be warned God always warns Before Destruction giving people an opportunity to turn to him but Jonah rose up to flee flee that's what that's what Joseph did right with the baby Jesus when the angel came and told him about Herod flee to Egypt so Jonah Rose to flee unto tares from the presence of the Lord and went down to japa that's modern day Tel Aviv and he found a ship going to tarses tares immediate question comes to mind where's this tarish that Jonah was attempting to reach the short answer no one really knows many think it refers to a town on the southern coast of Spain I've seen that in many many references oh he was going to go 25 200 miles to okay this is 8th Century BC we know that ships went there but or maybe another name for Tarsus where the Apostle Paul came from we know of a tarses that Solomon sent ship to ships to every 3 years to get silver in gold and apes and ivory you don't find that in Turkey you don't find that in Spain so this does not describe a place on the Mediterranean but most likely on the east coast of Africa in Solomon's time so there's more than one tarses what we do know is that Nineveh is some 500 miles Overland From Galilee on The Tigress River and if you got there by boat or by fish uh it's about 500 mil from the mouth of the Persian Gulf so little hard to get to I personally suspect that it's the Tarsus of Paul it would be reasonable to find ships going up and down the Eastern Mediterranean coast and to be able to go down to a port and find a ship going that way because it was a lot of trade going on on that route It was a commercial route and it was heavily traveled much less likely to find one going to Spain or East Africa and having space for a passenger so let's continue on so Jonah paid the fair thereof went down into it to go with them unto tarses from the presence of the Lord now we aren't told why he thought tarses would get him away from God's presence only that it was his destination and he was desperate to get there as fast as he could to flee but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea there was a mighty Tempest in the sea so the ship was like to be broken then the Mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his God and cast forth the Wares that were in the ship into the sea lighten it of them you can see in in this uh slide that that ship ships weren't very large they had a single sail a shallow draft there may or may not have been limited cabin space on the main deck the picture in the upper right of the screen here shows how such Merchant ships were loaded they had a very almost flat a very shallow rounded bottom of a hall it's great if you're in calm water not so good if the WEA is choppy so the bottom of the hall because it's not a nice deep V like we'd have in a modern ship they filled it with rocks for ballast in order to keep the ship basically upright the inner deck covering the ballast was unloaded with Goods to be transported which were segregated and loaded in the HS passengers and Crews might be on this level as well the top deck had Goods lashed down and these typically be the lightest Goods again to maintain the balance of the ship so to empty the ship of its Wares especially in a storm the crew would have to unsecure the cargo crates and jars and carry or hand them up to the top deck to be tossed overboard and as we read in Psalms 107 a little earlier ships were very unstable in a storm Rising near the crest of the wave and down into the trough making this an arduous a very dangerous undertaking but Jonah was gone out into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep so the ship Master the the captain came to him and said Jonah what meanest thou o sleeper arise call upon thy God if so be that God will think upon us that we perish not you recognize a similar situation with Jesus and the gospels he was sleeping on a ship being tossed about in a storm on the Sea of Galilee the disciples some of whom were experienced fishermen on that Lake were in fear of their lives and went to wake Jesus Mark 4:35 to 38 for those of you taking notes yeah so what's next Jonah is thrown into the sea so back to Jonah the the sailors determined that Jonah is the cause of the problem so they said unto him the Mariners said to Jonah what shall we do unto thee that the ship may be common unto us for the sea rought and was tempestuous and Jonah said to them take me up cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for I know that for my sake this great Tempest is upon you nevertheless the men rode hard to bring the ship to the land but they could not for the sea rot and was tempestuous tempestuous against them and understand that in these days they didn't have compasses they didn't have navigation things they batteries were dead in their GPS so they always sailed close to Land close to shore where they could see land it was never far away which also meant that they were on typically pretty shallow water which meant that any storm coming was going to be particularly severe if you've ever done any scuba diving or just brought in a boat from the shore in the ocean where it's just a little bit wavy as you get close to short tends to get really choppy because of the of the of the slope and the currents in the motion and so forth wherefore they Cried unto the Lord why would they cry unto the Lord why would they cry to Jonah's God because they understood that it was Jonah's God that was mad with them it wasn't their gods they' already figured that out so they're crying to Jonah's God we beseech thee Oh Lord we beseech thee let us not perish for this man's life and let not Upon Us innocent blood for thou oh Lord Hast done as it pleased thee so they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the Sea ceased from her raging then the men feared the Lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice under the Lord and made vows in Mark 6 we read of disciples rowing against a strong wind Jesus walks on the water as soon as he enters the boat the storm ceases like the Mariner and Jonah's both the disciples we were told were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered in Jonah's case he had to be cast out of the boat for the storm to cease in Jesus case he had to come into the boat for the storm to cease in both cases those in the boat were amazed well what happens next a great fish swallows Jonah so Jesus is in the boat but what about Jonah now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights and that brings us to the parallel from our opening scriptures where Jesus said that he that as Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and nights so Jesus would be in the heart of the earth what's the first thing Jonah did he prayed he prayed to the Lord he couldn't see if the storm calmed or not he was an in a terrible and fearful situation the storm was the last thing on his mind at this point this is not a Disney cartoon of Pinocchio the puppet boy and monstro the whale this is a unique as they said in the song a real life event is it true yes it's true let's read then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and said I cried by reason of mine Affliction unto the Lord he's no longer running he's no longer Aid avoiding the Lord he's turning to the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice skipping down to verse N I will sacrifice unto thee with all that I have what does he have he's in the belly of a fish what does God really want from us the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord word and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land how he was kept alive or preserved or breathed inside that sea creature we don't know a brother random spoke about Jonah many times and said he didn't know what we do know is that after three days and nights Jonah was spit out of the fish onto the shore and he was alive well what happens next oh Jonah's not fleeing the presence Jonah goes to Nineveh we don't know how long afterwards we don't know ex exactly where he was but the Lord had Jonah's attention the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time saying arise go into Nineveh that great City and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee so Jonah arose and again tried to flee from the presence no no Jonah arose and he went unto Nineveh according to the word of the lord we can only speculate how long it took by what means he traveled it seems likely that some people witnessed his ejection from the Monstrous fish and would have followed him to see what might happen to share the amazing Miracle of Jonah's arrival on their Shores God doesn't usually do things in the shadow but in the open further there were many tens of gods worshiped in Nineveh and a fish God was among them this would give further impact to Jonah's Miracle now we read Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey that doesn't mean it takes three days to get there it means it would take you three days to go through the place this is a big place remember it was about 500 Miles Overland from japa where he got on the boat about 4 450 mil from his home in giley it's like walking from Tucson to Albuquerque here's a satellite view to give you an idea of the perspective I've shown Jerusalem japa where he got on the boat and Nineveh where he was headed way up on the Tigris River at the time of Jonah this is a little hard to see but those of you sitting in the back understand why we always encourage people to sit in the front at the time of Jonah the Assyrian Empire was still expanding it included the two darker shades of green that you see here but that light shade of green it hadn't reached those borders yet it'd be some 40 years after Jonah's Ministry that Assyria would conquer Israel and subjugate Judah this is uh just one artist idea based on different archaeological things and and texts and so forth of what it might have looked like in ancient Nineveh it was not only the capital of the Assyrian Empire it was a major Center of Commerce on major eastwest and Norths South trade routes you might say all roads lead to Nineveh this is a picture of one of the gates of Nineveh that was uncovered and partially restored prior to the general destruction a decade or so ago from Isis you can see I've circled with an oval there a human headed bull at the lower right of the entry circled in yellow the arrow that I put next to it is about I've got shoes on about my height about six feet gives you an idea the size of that gate that is an impressive massive intimidating structure and Jonah began to enter into the city a Day's Journey and he cried and said yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown interesting word overthrown we don't know anything other than this title of his sermon or sermons or prophecies to the people of Nineveh we don't know for how many days he was among them preaching proclaiming the word of the Lord if he was like any of the other prophets and if the Lord is consistent he would have been telling the people to repent so the people of Nineveh believed God that is they believed the word of the Lord that Jonah spoke no doubt influenced by the miracle of his survival inside the sea creature and proclaimed a fast put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them in this section we see that the preaching of Jonah saying what the Lord told him to say back in verse one is effective for word came unto the king of Nineveh and he arose from his throne and laid his Ro robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes this is a sign of mourning and of humility skipping to verse eight he said let man and Beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God yay let them turn everyone from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands the background in this slide is a detail from a bronze gate of Bell a city near Nineveh of the same era from a photo I took at the British museum the ninevites the Assyrians were an exceedingly cruel and violent people I'd left the text obscuring the image on purpose there's children here I don't want to scare them but there are heads hung around the city gate men with their hands and feet cut off piles of hands and feet on the ground another man impaled on a spike afterwards these are cruel wanly violent Wicked people this is embossed on this City Gate warning anyone who comes this is a powerful Empire tolerates no breaking of its rules you have no rights once you enter these Gates a place without Mercy a place that Rules by violence back to the king's Proclamation turn everyone from his evil away in from the violence who can tell if God will turn and and repent turn away from his Fierce anger that we perish not repent of course means to change direction to turn around not God repenting from sin but his happiness that the people were changing their Direction and God heard their words Lord if he'll do this and that I promise I'll serve you it's not what it says God saw their works didn't listen to what they said he saw what they did he observed their actions that they turned from their evil way and God repented of God turned from the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not this is an unprecedented event again Nineveh was the capital of Assyria the Assyrian Empire was vast the Army ruthless the laws were harsh punishment wanly cruel think of a rabbi today going to the IAH and Iran and telling him Terran was going to be destroyed by the god of Israel in 40 days how do you think he'd be received by the Ayatollah in tan today well that's the sort of place and the kind of regime that Jonah was sent to but the people of Nineveh did repent from the King to the lowest person even the animals were made to fast turns out that Jonah wasn't pleased with this result and the Lord then proceeded to kindly teach him a lesson about the value of human and even animal life but oh I'm out of time and wait wait I see someone coming in the main entrance of the sanctuary could it be Jonah did you hear what the rabbi said about these people of Nineveh did you hear how evil they were and how filthy they were and all the problems that they caused and all of all of the filth that's in Nineveh did you hear about that do you hear what he said he was kind they were bad they were immoral they were violent they were evil so here I am a servant of the Lord and God tells me to go to that filthy Wicked place of neveh did I get him right or did I get him wrong you have a place there's this place here in these United States it's called Los Angeles you know play have you heard of to that place has anybody been there to Los Angeles what's it like it's awful it's bad huh yeah have like nasty people walking down the streets and and and uh they have like stars in in the in the ground and memorials and monuments and and idols and all of that this place n of it was like that so then God tells me go to this Place Nineveh and cry out against it I'm not going to that place brother Joe it's nasty so I go down to Jaffa and I pay my money and I get a ticket and off I go to a place called Tarsus very nice fine Jewish people there it's a nice place this place tarus so I get in the boat and I'm going along and and we're cruising along I don't know how you sisters walk in these [Laughter] things almost fell back there you need a split now I can [Laughter] see so I'm going along and I'm in the boat and I want to get some rest it's a long way so I go down in the bottom in the middle of the boat and there's this nice bed there I lay down and I'm resting really well and I'm asleep and all of a sudden one of these Heathen Gentiles that were up in the boat one of the Mariners you know they're rough they cuss they do all kinds of bad stuff they're violent they would fit perfect in Nineveh but he comes down he says wake up wake up you sleeper get up get up come up with we're we're about to perish I was like what you know the boat's rocking I get up there and the the wind is blowing and there's lightning and there's rain and and there's water all over and the waves are coming up over the boat and I and I'm there and they're asking everybody what are you what's going on and everybody starts all of these heathens start praying to their own Gods my God yeah that's going to do a lot of good and this one's praying to that God and that one's praying praying to this God I almost fell off the side and this one's it's modest and then this one's going over this one and that one and and I say watching and they they have this way of finding out the truth and they take these like their Dice and they they throw them out and they knew that it was me and they're throwing all their stuff over overboard they're trying to lighten the ship and they look over at me and they say you're the one what do we do the ship's going to sink and I say well here's what happened you know you're praying to all your Gods I serve the true God I serve the god that created the sea I serve the god that created the land and my God told me to go to this place Nineveh but now I'm on this boat going to Tarsus I said are you crazy what are you doing if you're God's real and he told you to go to Tarsus or told you to go to Nineveh why are you going to Tarsus they said what do we do and I said well really the best way for you to survive this my God is the god he's the almighty Jehovah take me throw me over the boat throw me into this Raging Sea and then you'll be safe they didn't want to do it I saw that these men weren't what I thought they were and they started praying and they didn't pray to their God gods they prayed to the God that I told them about and they were asking for Mercy they said they said Lord Lord God we don't want to throw this man over I said throw me over so they took me they did as I asked they threw me overboard and then they made a sacrifice to the one true God Jehovah and the wind stopped and the rain stopped and the boat the men on the boat were safe and into the water I went and down I went and I thought my life was over and out of the depths comes this giant fish or whale swallows me up brings me down to the bottom and I thought I was running away from God I had left the presence of God and if you leave the presence of God you never know what calamity is going to come across you never know what's going to happen to you but I had left the presence of God and here I am in this in this whale stomach it was dark and terrifying there was seaweed around my neck neck and here I am and I cried out to God and he heard me and when I knew that God had heard me I said Lord one day I don't know how it's going to happen but one day I will again look towards your Holy Temple and I will again pray to that Holy Temple I had faith in God that he could deliver me down there for three days and three nights I was in the belly of the whale and my oxygen was running out and and my my death was upon me I was in the very belly of hell and yet God heard me fish swims up and spits me out on dry land came out smelling like whale vomit brother L brother Lionel you ever get whale vomit in your beard you can never get it out it just stays there forever it just it's smells bad it's gross you can't you can't get it out you never have don't it's terrible it is smelling and bad and and and then the Lord tells me again tells me the same thing that he told me at the beginning he said go to Nineveh and cry out to these people I I wish I would have done it the first time but now I go and I go to this place and I cry out to these people of neveh and I tell them that within 40 days God will overthrow this city and it felt good I was out there and I was I was prophesying against it and I figured here it comes brother Joe they're coming down and there these going to be these invading armies and they are going to overthrow this city but many times a prophet he will prophesy and he won't know the meaning of his prophecy he is just speaking in the name of the Lord he speaks it out Isaiah was a little bit before my time not much but he was a little bit before my time and do you remember when he prophesied a virgin sh conceive and bear a son you remember that that when Isaiah the prophet prophesied I can't speak for Isaiah because Isaiah didn't know him he was a little bit before me but I don't think he knew what he was saying I think it was the Holy Spirit speaking through his Prophet God's prophet and prophesying that this was going to happen so here I am and I was prophesying in the name of the Lord that 40 days and this city would be overturned overthrown and then the word gets to this filthy evil Governor or king of this city of Nineveh yeah it's going to happen to you man and you know what he did he repented and he said maybe maybe he didn't even know for sure he said maybe if we repent and we turn back from our evil ways maybe God will have mercy on us so he should a decree he said everyone fasts he said even the animals fast he said no one eats and everyone repents of their evil ways and everyone go back and I'm sitting there I'm like these people are sinners they're evil they're trash let them die but no they repented and they they changed their ways which is very odd to me think about Los Angeles think about the filth San Francisco or Las Vegas think about the filth that's there this Nineveh was like that I wanted it destroyed but God sent me there for a reason and now I'm there I go up on the hill and I sit down and it's hot sun's coming down the sun's beating down and if you're challenged on the top like I am you really know when the sun's coming down it's miserable built a little booth tried to get some shade and you know what God cared for me God loved me and there grew up this plant in the tender loving care of Jehovah it grew over my head to shade brother Manny bald head and it felt so good man I just love this plant that had grown and then night time came and a worm somehow got into this plant and by morning the plant was dead was dead [Laughter] sister Martha made that very well it was dead the Sun starts beating down on me and I was like Lord let me just die this is terrible I got the sun beating down and my my plant died I loved that plant it was it it grew up and it shaded my my head and Lord you gave me this plant and it was so nice and now the plant dead and I'm burning up in the sun Lord let me just die and sometimes brothers and sisters sometimes when that anointing will come upon you as It Came Upon me when the anointing leaves there's a depression that follows in a suffering and after I had prophesied in the name of the Lord to these people of Nineveh I came back and I just got down and I got sad and I got upset and then the Lord gives me this shade and then the worm takes it away and I love this PL I say Lord I this this is the best plant and now it's dead I just want to die just take me just kill me I don't want to be here anymore and then the Lord spoke to me Rabbi can you open your Bible up yes sir then the Lord spoke to me and he said you are more worried about this plant than you are about those 120,000 Souls that are in Nineveh he said is that right Rabbi can you read those last few few verses yes Jonah then said the Lord thou Hast had pity on the gourd for the which thou Hast not labored sorry which thou Hast not labored neither mest It Grow which came up in a night and perished in her night and should not I spare Nineveh that great City where in are more than six score, 120,000 persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle and us we have the end of my book and it ends with a question why are you thinking more about this gourd plant why is it more important to you than 120 Souls 120,000 Souls out there in Los Angeles I mean in Nineveh or Las Vegas or San Francisco and we think that and tucon we think that there are prophecies that are going to come there are prophecies from real prophets my prophecy that I prophesied said that 40 days in this this city would be overrun the Hebrew word Rabbi what is the Hebrew word oh give me a moment to look that up in my scroll son you appreciate our Rabbi amen this Hebrew word that I can't pronounce I'm sure I learned English and now I forgot my Hebrew oh we're wanting the over the overturned right overturned yes overturned okay I'm in I'm in the wrong place on this scroll it's these Scrolls I tell you I believe it's like uh maybe 3 seven yeah up up up up and it's I'm in the wrong it's it's three yes I'm in the I'm I I got the wrong scroll here over yes here we go when us rabbis get old we get slow the uh the the word is neet and it means to turn overthrow overturn to turn about to turn over to turn around to change to transform and here I am I am a prophet of God anointed by the Holy Spirit and I say 40 days and this city will be overthrown over what is the word again yes it will be kaak overthrown turned over I thought differently but it doesn't change the fact that I'm a prophet and I did prophesy and that city was overturned yes it turned from sin turned over to righteousness and then God had mercy upon that City and how many times just us brothers and sisters how many times have we thought of prophecies that were going to happen how many times have we thought that this world's going to burn according to Malachi how many times have we thought the prophet William brandom tells us that Los Angeles is going to sink how many times have we seen these things and do we want them to happen are we being a Jonah they're going to happen because they're prophets of God speaking these things but we should be crying out to the people that are there yes and asking for mercy and asking them to turn their ways as Jonah did and then maybe we can turn Souls maybe we can turn someone that is the worst of the worst and turn them into the best of the best as Jonah did Jonah's out there prophesying Nineveh didn't think anything was going to happen he thought they were going to be destroyed he leaves and God has Mercy because they repented and he goes down and he sits under the tree loved the plant more than he loved the people and that's the story of Jonah and that's the lesson behind this wonderful book this wonderful short four chapter lesson on Jonah we wonder why it's in there it's a wonderful story but it's not just to tell a story it's a powerful story a Supernatural story he was in the belly of the whale then Jesus's brother Lyall Rabbi Lyall Rabbi Johnson here as he said Jesus himself said as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so must the son of man be in the grave for that long Jonah is a very important prophetic book but it's also a good lesson judge not that you be not judged cry out to the sins of the world and then maybe they will repent I love what that King said what that King said was so beautiful he said you know maybe we don't know but possibly God would have mercy on us and he did and there was Rabbi Johnson was a 40 years later that Nineveh was finally destroyed it was 40 years later that they destroyed Israel oh that Nineveh came back and destroyed Israel yes and then in Nineveh was eventually destroyed another hundred years yeah the story of Jon Adam I'm going to pull on you one more time let's all stand Adam if you come up and um if you would close in prayer and also pray over the food okay oh before
