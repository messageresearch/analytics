[10:55] [Music]
[11:12] amen
[11:13] what a mighty god we serve isn't it
[11:16] good to see some of the folks that
[11:18] hadn't been able to be here
[11:20] i know sister shirley and sarah had
[11:23] quarantined there but good to see you
[11:25] and
[11:26] i see brother no
[11:30] i always want to call you figaro's but
[11:32] your tailors did i said it's good to see
[11:34] them all
[11:36] god bless you
[11:37] robert
[11:40] god has made a way amen
[11:42] we do have a couple of needs we'll
[11:45] bring them to your attention and i see
[11:46] brother peter just walked in and
[11:49] i guess he took the wrong turn somewhere
[11:51] because he said he's going to be out of
[11:52] town but come on up brother peter so you
[11:54] can take these needs
[11:57] my sister kathy called my dad this
[12:00] morning
[12:01] and said she was
[12:03] having some trouble breathing
[12:06] and
[12:07] her kidneys were not functioning and she
[12:09] has been on dialysis now for some time
[12:11] but she was not feeling well
[12:14] and then my sis my daughter sarah sent a
[12:16] text she had headache and
[12:18] some pain and some nausea so this
[12:20] morning she was asking us to
[12:23] to remember her
[12:24] and
[12:25] i have not had a real recent update but
[12:28] the last update on brother steve buckles
[12:30] was he was not able to breathe on his
[12:32] own
[12:33] and he was still using a ventilator
[12:36] so remember i did ask brother juan how
[12:38] sister irma gashiola was doing and she
[12:40] was doing better after
[12:42] going through covet also so
[12:45] you have a need
[12:47] i mean we always there's not one of us
[12:49] that doesn't have a need to just
[12:51] recognizing that our lord is more than
[12:53] able so
[12:54] let's just just believe them
[13:00] just a small praise we got a flat tire
[13:03] yesterday and that's not usually
[13:05] something that we
[13:06] we praise about but the way that it
[13:07] happened
[13:09] the tire pressure was going down really
[13:10] quick i could watch it going down and we
[13:12] were able to pull into a tire shop just
[13:14] an hour before they closed and
[13:17] and they were able to
[13:18] replace the tire and
[13:20] something that could have been you know
[13:22] if it hadn't realized it and got on the
[13:24] highway or something you never know what
[13:26] could happen
[13:27] but i believe the lord was mindful there
[13:29] and
[13:29] he's mindful of my tire i know he's
[13:31] mindful of your need
[13:33] so let's just pray to him
[13:37] dear lord jesus
[13:40] your word tells us that you love us
[13:44] lord that we're
[13:45] as the apple of your eye and
[13:48] written on the palms of your hands
[13:51] we know lord that you bore our sin and
[13:54] our shame
[13:55] you took the stripes that should have
[13:56] been for us lord
[13:58] you nailed it all to calvary
[14:02] lord we're so thankful that you made a
[14:04] way that we can come back to you and
[14:06] we can come boldly lord before your
[14:08] throne of grace to
[14:10] obtain mercy lord and receive what we
[14:13] have need of know that these
[14:15] needs that were spoken and those that
[14:16] were unspoken are serious needs lord
[14:19] the needs that we don't even know about
[14:22] the lord you know all things and
[14:25] for the foundation of the world you made
[14:26] the way so lord
[14:29] we thank you that you've
[14:30] already met these needs
[14:33] give us faith to believe lord open our
[14:35] eyes that we could see you and walk with
[14:36] you father today pray that you would
[14:38] have the total preeminence in every part
[14:40] of this service lord
[14:42] move aside anything that would hinder
[14:43] the moving of your spirit any sin and
[14:45] unbelief lord forgive us
[14:47] and just help us to worship you in
[14:49] spirit and truth lord bless
[14:51] the speaker and the hearer both that we
[14:53] could be anointed and
[14:55] that you would change our lives lord

[15:19] the other

[15:23] i drove a little over 600 miles
[15:25] in town just crisscrossing and

[15:30] blowout

[15:38] safely
[15:40] and then got the jack out got everything
[15:42] ready and found out that the tire iron
[15:44] that they come with the truck doesn't
[15:45] fit the nug bolts
[15:47] so i sat there for
[15:48] two and a half hours
[15:50] and uh
[15:52] but i was safe and i thank the lord for
[15:55] that
[15:55] sometimes uh
[15:57] we get frustrated maybe we get upset we
[16:00] wonder but god has a reason for those
[16:02] things you know he sees way beyond what
[16:05] so we appreciate that and we just want

[18:06] thank you
[18:08] for being
[18:11] so good
[18:14] you may be seated
[18:16] i would like to read something to you
[18:20] for those of you that
[18:21] knew the mcgoy family billy was the
[18:24] sister mcgoy's son and
[18:26] he's up in in oregon in a correctional
[18:29] facility
[18:31] and he wrote something
[18:33] to honor his mother and he sent it to me
[18:36] to us
[18:37] we got it this week and he just asked if
[18:39] we could read it so
[18:41] a tribute to his mom so i'm going to
[18:43] read that
[18:45] he said king solomon said that a
[18:47] virtuous woman was worth far more than
[18:50] rubies
[18:51] my mother's birthstone was sapphire
[18:54] second only to diamonds in the
[18:56] foundation of the new jerusalem
[18:59] he said she ariseth while is yet night
[19:01] and giveth meat to her household
[19:04] he said i remember her getting up every
[19:06] morning without fail to leave at 4 30
[19:08] a.m she wouldn't get back until 5 30 or
[19:12] sometimes even later
[19:14] proverbs 31 18 says her candle goeth not
[19:17] out by night
[19:19] if there was ever a strike or an office
[19:21] to clean or if someone needed typing
[19:23] done she was eager to do it for the
[19:25] extra money
[19:27] and through it all she was her own
[19:28] built-in daycare
[19:31] it said verse 28 in proverbs she says
[19:34] there says that her children
[19:36] arise up and call her blessed in verse
[19:38] 30
[19:40] a woman that feareth the lord she shall
[19:42] be praised
[19:43] she says because of what she instilled
[19:45] in me there is very little i cannot do
[19:47] from driving semis to flying airplanes
[19:50] to being a certified welder certified
[19:53] firefighter emt
[19:55] to building houses from the ground up i
[19:57] would all do her
[19:58] can-do attitude
[20:00] looking back i have never met anyone
[20:02] with more faith
[20:05] i like how he puts this was she perfect
[20:07] not hardly
[20:09] was she at least a perfect mother
[20:12] not by a long shot was she a good mother
[20:15] no she was a great mother
[20:18] she was one of the greatest i believe
[20:20] that ever lived
[20:21] everything my mother did was to ensure
[20:23] that we were protected and provided for
[20:26] i never realized until years later how
[20:29] much she silently endured gladly for us
[20:32] what a great
[20:33] job she did raising five kids on her her
[20:35] own
[20:36] i heard her say
[20:38] once say she said i don't care what you
[20:40] do to me but don't you dare mess with my
[20:42] kids
[20:44] she told me that little boys didn't come
[20:46] with instruction manuals and if she
[20:48] has it to do over again there was a lot
[20:50] of things she would do differently that
[20:52] got me to thinking for being a
[20:54] self-taught parent without oprah or dr
[20:57] phil youtube or any other know-it-alls
[21:00] i think she did a great fine job
[21:03] sometimes it's us
[21:05] sitting back on this side later
[21:07] and looking and saying boy what a
[21:09] blessing we did have
[21:10] and maybe we didn't esteem them enough
[21:12] treasure them enough
[21:14] love them like we should and it's always
[21:16] in hindsight that we see that but
[21:18] it's good to hear somebody speak of
[21:20] their mother that way so
[21:24] the more i reflect the more i realize
[21:26] what a wise loving and all-around good
[21:28] woman she was i pray every day for
[21:30] wisdom and knowledge joy and strength
[21:33] and peace because by her example i know
[21:35] such can be had
[21:37] integrity integrity is doing the right
[21:40] thing when no one is looking
[21:42] the person you saw at church or out in
[21:44] the public was the exact same person you
[21:46] saw at our house
[21:48] so much so in fact that we kids were
[21:50] genuinely surprised
[21:52] and confused when we encountered
[21:54] contradictions in others
[21:57] he says imagine what a world we'd be
[21:59] living in if we were all half the person
[22:01] she was
[22:03] i was truly
[22:05] i was truly blessed to have known betty
[22:07] jane ramey mcgoy and doubly blessed to
[22:09] call her mother
[22:10] it hurts every time i realize that that
[22:13] not only will i not see her talk to her
[22:15] or see or laugh
[22:16] or hear her laugh again we all
[22:19] we all know
[22:20] she lives in the world but she know
[22:22] we all now live in a world where she no
[22:24] longer exists other than the memories of
[22:26] those who live life she's touch
[22:29] and without her it's a dark world
[22:32] again it's one of those things that
[22:34] we realize after
[22:37] and i remember brother green would tell
[22:38] us many times appreciate those
[22:41] love them treat especially he would tell
[22:43] us as young people with our parents and
[22:46] but
[22:47] to hear a testimony like that
[22:50] is a whole lot better than hearing some
[22:52] of the testimonies that we've
[22:54] but
[22:55] to hear a christian mother a godly
[22:58] mother who did so much on them
[23:00] again they asked we would read that and
[23:02] i said we would do that so
[23:04] i appreciate every one of you being here
[23:06] this morning and sister rachel who's
[23:08] that young man there next to you oh it's
[23:10] enoch so
[23:12] good
[23:12] good to see him home here and good to
[23:15] have each one of you back so
[23:17] amen
[23:18] he paid a debt he did not owe
[23:21] and i owe the debt i could not pay
[23:24] i'm so glad he paid it on
[23:29] [Music]
[23:45] and now i sing
[23:48] a brand
[23:54] christ jesus
[23:57] [Music]
[24:04] paid a debt
[24:06] on calvary
[24:08] he cleansed my soul
[24:11] he set me free i'm glad that jesus
[24:16] did all
[24:17] [Music]
[24:30] christ jesus
[24:35] [Music]
[24:39] one day he's coming back for me
[24:43] to live with
[24:59] a brand new song
[25:01] amazing grace all day
[25:05] christ jesus made it
[25:08] let's sing that verse one more
[25:12] time one day he's coming back for me
[25:18] to live with him
[25:26] to see him on that day
[25:31] i then will sing
[25:34] a brand new song
[25:36] amazing
[25:39] grace jesus
[25:42] [Music]
[25:48] amen what a day
[25:51] we have brother plitt's family with us
[25:53] and
[25:54] i volunteered them to say oh i asked
[25:56] them if they would sing and they
[25:57] they said they would so if they would
[26:00] prepare brother peter i don't know maybe
[26:03] the microphones have them set up for
[26:05] them
[26:06] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[26:08] this morning i know there are many of
[26:10] those that would love to be
[26:13] i was listening to i forget where i was
[26:15] listening but they were
[26:17] said there were some folks that had been
[26:18] two or three years that they had been
[26:20] able to gather
[26:22] in a place
[26:23] of fellowship
[26:24] and sometimes we take for granted being
[26:26] able to come
[26:28] and appreciate the lord
[26:29] allowing that so
[26:31] he wanted to sing too but
[26:33] so he did his own solo on the way out
[26:35] there so
[26:48] god bless you
[26:49] it's always good to be down here with
[26:51] our family in tucson
[26:53] we were
[26:54] driving yesterday into town and
[26:57] there was this man walking right in the
[26:59] middle of the road and i thought god
[27:01] have mercy
[27:02] and if not for grace that's where i
[27:04] would be and
[27:06] i pray the song will be a blessing
[27:08] because
[27:09] this is the words to this song and i
[27:11] just felt like
[27:13] you know you look at these
[27:15] people on this earth and the ill-famed
[27:17] woman and the different ones the drug
[27:20] addict and
[27:22] and it's just by his grace that any of
[27:24] us make it and that we're here
[27:26] sitting in this pew this morning instead
[27:28] of the
[27:29] in their place
[27:31] god bless you
[27:34] [Music]
[27:46] where would i be
[27:52] [Music]
[28:02] a
[28:03] hopeless case
[28:06] an empty
[28:07] place
[28:11] [Music]
[28:28] amazing grace
[28:31] how sweet
[28:35] i once
[28:43] a was
[28:45] case
[28:46] an empty
[28:48] place
[28:54] [Music]
[29:02] oh
[29:03] grace
[29:06] grace
[29:13] grace that
[29:16] will
[29:17] pardon and cleanse
[29:27] grace
[29:31] god's grace
[29:34] grace that
[29:36] is greater
[29:38] [Music]
[29:44] where would i be
[29:49] you only know
[29:53] i'm glad you see
[29:57] through eyes of love
[30:01] a
[30:02] hopeless case
[30:05] just an empty
[30:07] place
[30:09] if not
[30:10] for grace and get with us
[30:13] where would i be
[30:17] you only know

[30:30] hopeless case
[30:33] an empty
[30:35] place
[30:37] if not
[30:39] for grace
[30:41] a
[30:42] hopeless case
[30:45] an empty
[30:47] place
[30:49] if not
[30:51] for grace
[31:01] sometimes i wonder if we even realize
[31:03] what his grace is to us
[31:05] how many times he's watched over us and
[31:08] kept us and protect us that we're not
[31:09] even aware of
[31:12] but you know

[31:15] you never draw so much there's nothing

[40:12] he's all
[40:14] amen when whatever you have need of
[40:16] i think sometimes what could you
[40:19] approach god with
[40:20] and say lord can you do this
[40:23] but he's already met that need already
[40:26] think just the simple things when he
[40:27] said
[40:28] he knows every bird he knows every
[40:30] sparrow and he knows when they fall
[40:32] tells peter go to that fish and get that

[40:39] god
[40:40] and he's my king

[40:44] this morning we have brother reggie
[40:45] plead with us come down from
[40:48] flagstaff they came down yesterday
[40:50] evening
[40:51] preparing his heart and
[40:53] i know the lord this past week i was
[40:54] telling my wife i said just some things
[40:56] that
[40:57] that i've been reading and hearing just
[40:59] blessing my heart and i said brother ed
[41:01] you'll preach them this morning i'm sure
[41:03] it's just same how god does us one after
[41:06] another's come and just
[41:08] fed us and it's just been a continuation
[41:10] i said it's better than having this side
[41:12] preach and somebody else and coming and
[41:14] preaching this side seems totally
[41:16] opposite
[41:17] unless on this side he's preaching the
[41:19] god of fire and judgment and on this
[41:20] side he's preaching to god of mercy
[41:22] because he's the same god
[41:24] and i said sometimes you need both but
[41:27] i trust that you're believing
[41:29] and expecting and drawing and so lord
[41:30] you know my need
[41:32] you know my doctor let's stand as
[41:34] brother reggie
[41:35] comes out i don't want to
[41:38] to make him feel like he's rushed or
[41:39] anything but just whatever god has put
[41:42] in his heart amen
[41:43] maybe just with a a raised hand right
[41:45] now you would say lord
[41:47] you know what my need is
[41:49] you know why i'm here
[41:51] and you know why brother reggie came
[41:52] today and what you would speak to our
[41:54] hearts
[41:55] can you believe that so
[41:57] i know yesterday i sent him a text i
[41:59] said are you in town and everything okay
[42:01] and he said yes i said and we're
[42:02] trusting that the lord would give you
[42:04] something
[42:05] to minister to us amen
[42:08] appreciate the grace of god amen that
[42:10] chorus one more time lord i lift your
[42:12] name
[42:13] lord i
[42:15] lift your
[42:18] name
[42:20] your holy
[42:30] [Music]

[43:09] the resurrection this morning certainly
[43:12] happy to know that
[43:14] we
[43:15] serve a risen god
[43:17] not not
[43:19] somebody we're waiting
[43:21] for to to rise again but he's already
[43:24] risen
[43:25] and he sent back his spirit to live in
[43:27] men and women today
[43:29] that the world
[43:31] might be drawn unto him
[43:34] amen god bless you i trust you know what
[43:37] day it is as i heard the brother
[43:39] talking about the grace of god and the
[43:41] songs
[43:42] about the grace of god and i thought
[43:45] about that scripture for by grace ye are
[43:48] saved through faith
[43:50] and that not of yourselves
[43:52] but of
[43:53] god who gave that freely
[43:56] today is reformation day
[43:59] today is the day that it was proclaimed
[44:04] to the catholic church the just shall
[44:06] live by faith amen i believe that
[44:10] it's the grace of god
[44:12] that that gift of salvation was given to
[44:15] us and it's by your faith
[44:18] that you believe that and you receive
[44:21] that and you draw the benefits from it
[44:24] amen good to see each and every one i
[44:26] thought i heard
[44:28] brother peter
[44:29] mcfadden
[44:30] praying was that not brother pete that
[44:32] was brother peter god bless you brother
[44:34] peter we thought you were maybe not
[44:37] going to be here this morning but it's
[44:38] good to see you and our good friend
[44:40] brother david fritz
[44:43] is that is that who i see here god bless
[44:46] you good
[44:47] good to have you in the house of the
[44:49] lord fellowship with us this morning if
[44:51] you have your bibles
[44:53] and you'd like to turn with me
[44:56] i'm sure
[44:57] i'm sure you could guess where we'll be
[44:59] reading from
[45:01] the book of hebrews
[45:03] and i just want you to know that this
[45:05] was totally unintentional that we're
[45:07] reading from the book of hebrews this
[45:09] morning
[45:10] i was had determined in my heart i'm i'm
[45:13] going to let these poor people alone
[45:16] and not uh
[45:18] you know i i when i hear brother brandon
[45:20] i'm telling that story about that sister
[45:22] who finally he'd preached for i think he
[45:24] said six months on job
[45:26] she said brother brandon when are you
[45:27] going to get job off the ash heap and he
[45:30] said he'd been preaching on it so long
[45:31] and i feel like maybe you all are
[45:33] wondering
[45:34] brother
[45:35] when are we going to move on to paul
[45:37] preaching to the romans or something but
[45:40] this was unintentional we the family and
[45:43] i had listened to a tape together and it
[45:46] just so happened that these scriptures
[45:49] that we're about to read were the very
[45:50] same scriptures brother branham used
[45:53] and
[45:54] and
[45:55] well praise the lord
[45:58] hebrews chapter 10 and we're going to
[46:00] read
[46:02] just
[46:04] verses 19 through 21
[46:08] having therefore brethren boldness to
[46:11] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[46:14] jesus
[46:16] by a new and living way which he hath
[46:19] consecrated for us through the veil
[46:23] that is to say his flesh
[46:25] and having an high priest
[46:28] over
[46:29] the house of god
[46:31] amen let's just bow our heads together
[46:33] as we approach the author of this word
[46:36] our precious heavenly father
[46:38] lord we are so happy
[46:40] god to receive the grace of god in our
[46:43] lives lord to have heard
[46:45] your word in this hour
[46:48] lord where would we be without your
[46:51] grace lord we'd be wandering about lord
[46:54] in darkness stumbling
[46:56] lord wondering
[46:58] perhaps what our purpose was but god
[47:01] you are so gracious to us that you
[47:03] allowed the word of god to fall upon our
[47:05] ears
[47:06] and lord when you begin to reveal
[47:08] yourself to us through revelation
[47:11] god how that we begin to recognize the
[47:14] day and age in which we live
[47:16] lord who we are and who you are and lord
[47:20] the relationship we have with you and
[47:23] lord this great big family of god and
[47:25] that great big plan of redemption
[47:28] and oh lord jesus it's such a beautiful
[47:31] thing and we're so blessed lord blessed
[47:33] above millions
[47:35] god to have heard it
[47:37] and lord we would just ask that as we
[47:40] call upon the name of jesus christ this
[47:42] morning we ask that you would come and
[47:45] do the same thing that you
[47:47] did lord when you walked the shores of
[47:49] galilee that lord you would do the same
[47:51] thing
[47:52] this morning that you did so many years
[47:55] ago lord when your prophet was here and
[47:58] preaching the word of god just the truth
[48:00] and lord it was able to set the captive
[48:03] free it was able to open the eyes of the
[48:06] blind and to let the the lame walk again
[48:10] and god the dumb to speak and the death
[48:12] to hear lord it's enough to do it again
[48:15] today we believe that lord we would ask
[48:18] that you would do the same for those
[48:20] that have a need this morning
[48:22] lord i pray that the whole purpose
[48:25] of us coming here standing behind this
[48:28] sacred desk
[48:29] is to lord preach the truth preach
[48:32] the word spirit and truth so that lord
[48:36] if your children would be bound by any
[48:39] circumstance if they'd be bound by
[48:41] sickness if they'd be bound by sin
[48:44] or lord just oppression of the enemy i
[48:47] pray that as these words would go
[48:49] forward that god you'd set them free
[48:52] that lord your children would be able to
[48:54] stand up and look up and realize that
[48:57] redemption draws nigh
[48:59] and i pray lord god that you would send
[49:02] your ministering angels up and down each
[49:04] and every pew every ayah lord touch
[49:08] those that would be sick lord as each
[49:10] one begins to think
[49:12] lord upon the need that they have i pray
[49:15] that as the word of god is preached that
[49:17] they would by faith reach out and say
[49:20] that's for me
[49:22] that god that's for me i believe that
[49:24] that that god today is my day of
[49:27] salvation would you grant it to him
[49:30] heavenly father we ask these things in
[49:33] jesus christ's name amen and god bless
[49:36] you can be seated
[49:45] today i'd like to
[49:47] uh
[49:49] for a title i
[49:51] i would call this the secret life of a
[49:53] believer
[49:56] and
[50:00] if there's anybody here who's maybe a
[50:02] guest who has never been here before
[50:04] maybe you're coming in you
[50:07] uh maybe a little skeptical
[50:10] uh
[50:11] about
[50:12] uh this church or the
[50:15] or the christian life
[50:17] maybe you feel like oh
[50:20] i just came in right out the right
[50:22] sermon i'd like to know what is the
[50:24] secret life of the believer
[50:27] i knew there was i knew there had to be
[50:29] there had to be they had to have a
[50:31] secret life
[50:33] and you're correct
[50:36] and i'm going to talk about the secret
[50:37] life of a believer this morning
[50:41] and lord willing we'll see we'll keep
[50:43] our our eye on the time i don't want to
[50:46] hold you
[50:47] very long
[50:50] there's some beautiful
[50:54] things that brother branham said he left
[50:57] us
[50:59] that if we have time i'd like to get to
[51:01] but
[51:03] i thought
[51:04] well
[51:06] if a believer has a secret life
[51:10] what
[51:11] maybe we'll just look at the life of of
[51:14] just an individual
[51:16] and i begin to think about
[51:18] uh
[51:21] what would the what would a secret life
[51:23] of an unbeliever look like
[51:27] and maybe
[51:29] for some of us who've maybe been in the
[51:30] way long enough now you're going to have
[51:32] to go back in your mind
[51:34] and
[51:35] think well when i was not serving the
[51:38] lord what kind of a life was i living
[51:42] i don't like for any of us to have to
[51:44] dwell on that but maybe it'll be able
[51:46] help you
[51:47] to be able to reach out to a sinner to
[51:50] somebody who is yet to know the grace of
[51:52] god
[51:53] i thought the secret
[51:55] life of an unbeliever might look
[51:57] something like this they
[52:01] uh
[52:04] they've been taught
[52:05] to get an education
[52:08] they've been taught to go into the world
[52:10] and
[52:11] and achieve the the best they can
[52:16] and and then perhaps they
[52:20] have seen the life of other unbelievers
[52:22] and they were drawn to
[52:28] well the pleasures of life for an
[52:30] unbeliever whatever that would be
[52:37] but they know to be successful
[52:40] they see that that life of pleasure and
[52:43] where it leads
[52:45] might not be conducive to a great career
[52:48] and so
[52:50] when they're chasing their career
[52:53] they know that
[52:55] that somebody successful in a career
[52:57] life looks a certain way
[53:00] there may be a certain
[53:04] image
[53:05] that is portrayed for a successful
[53:08] person in this world whether that be man
[53:10] or woman
[53:16] but there's things in their life
[53:19] that they can't bring into that
[53:21] professional world and so they have a
[53:23] secret life
[53:25] that's on the side it's it's something
[53:27] that they keep
[53:29] back for after the career after work is
[53:32] over
[53:33] they've got the secret life
[53:36] the secret life for an unbeliever
[53:39] may be a life of
[53:41] alcoholism
[53:43] it may be a life of drug addiction
[53:48] maybe a life of stealing or dishonesty
[53:51] maybe a a life of of
[53:54] of dishonesty from
[53:57] family
[53:58] or
[53:59] any relationship that they might build
[54:01] with more than one individual
[54:04] i don't want to draw this picture too
[54:06] big because i think you understand what
[54:08] i'm what i say when i talk about the
[54:11] secret life of an unbeliever and then
[54:13] they show back up to work
[54:16] and they want that secret life to remain
[54:19] a secret
[54:21] and so they do the best they can to keep
[54:23] that
[54:24] from the world and
[54:26] and this world has picked up on that
[54:29] especially in the day and age we live in
[54:33] they've created
[54:34] even ways of technology
[54:37] to help
[54:38] to help that secret life
[54:41] to help you hide that secret life the
[54:44] best that you can hide and
[54:46] and so they
[54:48] even the most successful people talk
[54:49] about this addiction to social media
[54:53] these dopamine kicks that people are
[54:56] getting
[54:57] uh from from from uh sources like
[55:00] facebook and instagram
[55:02] and the secret life of the
[55:04] unbeliever they
[55:07] they take the best they they go
[55:10] somewhere and they take the best picture
[55:12] they can of themselves and then they
[55:14] stick a filter on it
[55:16] and so that it looks
[55:18] even better than than what it or what
[55:21] what it was while they were there and
[55:24] they put
[55:25] they had this smile on the picture and
[55:27] so everybody is thinking they've got the
[55:30] greatest life
[55:32] that a person can have
[55:35] and perhaps
[55:38] that picture and that that image
[55:41] is
[55:43] only something to mask what's
[55:46] in their hidden life and that is sorrow
[55:50] and that is despair and that is
[55:51] loneliness and that is
[55:53] a life filled with questions
[55:56] and a life filled with turmoil and hurt
[55:59] a life filled with addictions that they
[56:02] cannot seem to overcome
[56:18] and they make sayings like
[56:21] fake it till you make it
[56:25] just fake it till you make it
[56:32] you think my what a
[56:37] what a life
[56:40] and it may even seem like a life but
[56:43] eventually it catches up
[56:54] and maybe somebody told that person
[56:57] you need to find religion
[57:01] and
[57:05] that the ultimate life is to have a life
[57:09] you know you've got your career life
[57:11] you've got your
[57:13] life
[57:14] that is your business and the pleasures
[57:17] of life
[57:18] but you need to
[57:20] you need to have god in your life
[57:23] it's one of those things that
[57:25] you know they
[57:27] well it used to be
[57:29] that politicians that was
[57:32] one element that they always had to have
[57:34] in their repertoire
[57:36] was
[57:37] what is there
[57:38] what is their faith
[57:40] what is it that they believe now that
[57:43] seems to be going away more and more
[57:45] as time goes on it doesn't seem to be as
[57:48] important for a politician to proclaim
[57:52] what it is that they believe
[57:54] but
[57:55] we do still see it yet today
[57:58] and here in america in our elections and
[58:00] so forth uh where do they go to church
[58:02] what do they proclaim and
[58:04] and uh what what faith are they and it
[58:07] was really big this last election i
[58:09] think
[58:10] they were pointing out that uh joe biden
[58:12] the second catholic president
[58:14] so
[58:15] he
[58:16] he prescribes to the catholic faith
[58:21] and and
[58:22] whether he does or whether he doesn't
[58:25] he's going to put it on his
[58:27] on his resume
[58:30] that he's a catholic and he wants the
[58:32] nation to know that and
[58:35] i think
[58:37] donald trump i think he proclaimed he
[58:39] was a presbyterian i think that was his
[58:41] what he his claim to fame
[58:44] and he couldn't even
[58:46] recall scriptures properly but he was a
[58:49] presbyterian he wanted the world to know
[58:51] that
[58:55] and so now we see
[58:58] what maybe the secret life
[59:01] of a make believer would look like
[59:04] the secret life of a make-believer
[59:08] they have their life their career they
[59:10] have their jobs they
[59:12] they
[59:13] they do all the same things they they
[59:15] they want to do the best that they can
[59:17] to have a family
[59:18] but they have their church life as well
[59:22] the main believer he's going to go to
[59:24] church and
[59:26] and he's
[59:27] he's going to sit in the pew and he's
[59:29] going to go to the events and he's going
[59:31] to go to the potlucks and
[59:34] make believers going to show up to all
[59:36] the events and
[59:41] he'll follow along
[59:43] just as everybody else does
[59:47] and when he comes into church and you
[59:49] say oh
[59:50] brother so and so how are you the answer
[59:53] is always fine very fine very good how
[59:56] are you
[1:00:06] but when he leaves church
[1:00:09] when sunday's over
[1:00:12] maybe he comes to the midweek service
[1:00:15] if they're if there's a midweek service
[1:00:20] but when monday comes
[1:00:23] there's a different life
[1:00:25] a different life than what was on sunday
[1:00:29] sunday is a sunday
[1:00:32] sunday has its own
[1:00:34] it has its own day it has its own set of
[1:00:37] rules it has its own life to it
[1:00:39] and then the rest of the week follows
[1:00:41] another
[1:00:46] brother branham
[1:00:49] preached sermons like investments and he
[1:00:52] was speaking to the full gospel
[1:00:54] businessmen
[1:00:57] and one of the things that he
[1:00:59] really
[1:01:00] really
[1:01:02] where the rubber met the road when he
[1:01:03] got down to it he said now if you're a
[1:01:06] businessman
[1:01:09] you got no business
[1:01:11] being behind the pulpit
[1:01:14] you
[1:01:19] if you don't have a call in your life
[1:01:20] and he wasn't saying that you can't be a
[1:01:22] businessman and a and a minister but
[1:01:25] what he was saying was if you're not
[1:01:27] called to the ministry
[1:01:29] and you're simply a businessman and you
[1:01:32] feel that you can apply business ethics
[1:01:35] to a calling in god
[1:01:39] you're you're playing on dangerous
[1:01:41] ground
[1:01:45] because you're a successful businessman
[1:01:47] that means you'll all automatically be a
[1:01:50] successful minister brother branham
[1:01:53] was pointing out very clearly that those
[1:01:56] are two very separate things
[1:02:03] and he would say why is it that i hear
[1:02:06] you
[1:02:07] christians
[1:02:09] saying i've got this many cadillacs well
[1:02:11] i've got this many this and god must be
[1:02:13] blessing me he said
[1:02:15] you can't ever compare yourself to the
[1:02:18] people of the world you'll never be able
[1:02:20] to compete
[1:02:21] when it comes to having
[1:02:23] things of the world
[1:02:25] you'll never be able to compete with the
[1:02:27] world
[1:02:28] and why would you
[1:02:34] but that's what this life looks like for
[1:02:36] a make-believer
[1:02:49] but when we look at
[1:02:52] the secret life of a believer what does
[1:02:54] it look like
[1:02:58] now these scriptures that i read
[1:03:00] here in hebrews chapter 10.
[1:03:04] they come
[1:03:05] brother branham read these scriptures
[1:03:07] and
[1:03:08] use them in a message called a hidden
[1:03:10] life in christ
[1:03:13] brother branham takes these scriptures
[1:03:16] here and and
[1:03:18] we look at what the context of these
[1:03:21] scriptures are what paul is speaking
[1:03:23] about
[1:03:25] paul is taking
[1:03:27] again and this is maybe a little bit of
[1:03:29] rehearsal from where
[1:03:31] we've been before
[1:03:33] but paul is taking the illustration
[1:03:37] of the old testament levitical
[1:03:39] priesthood
[1:03:42] and he's showing how that
[1:03:45] god
[1:03:46] showed moses
[1:03:48] by vision how to pattern
[1:03:52] the tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:03:55] then not just the tabernacle but the
[1:03:58] clothing that the priests were to wear
[1:04:01] the the the materials
[1:04:04] the the certain types of wood that were
[1:04:07] to be used in not only the building of
[1:04:10] the tabernacle but also the furniture
[1:04:13] that was to go inside the tabernacle and
[1:04:16] there were certain types of wood to be
[1:04:18] used
[1:04:19] and then there was certain types of
[1:04:21] metal
[1:04:22] to be used even as just a
[1:04:26] ring to hang a curtain on it was to be
[1:04:29] made of a certain specific type of metal
[1:04:35] and many of these things we we realize
[1:04:37] as we read the scripture and thank god
[1:04:40] we had a prophet come who pointed us to
[1:04:43] the scripture and then showed us
[1:04:47] even by even by other men who had
[1:04:50] studied the word of god
[1:04:53] had recognized that wood was a type of
[1:04:58] humanity
[1:04:59] that wood represents mankind and
[1:05:03] different woods represent different
[1:05:05] things and brother branham does a
[1:05:07] beautiful illustration of this when he
[1:05:10] preaches a message i believe the message
[1:05:12] the ark
[1:05:13] and he talks about how that
[1:05:15] uh when when when god showed noah how
[1:05:18] went that to go build the ark that he
[1:05:20] was to go get gopher wood
[1:05:23] to build the ark and that gopher wood
[1:05:25] was like a balsa wood it was it was very
[1:05:28] porous it would have been made a
[1:05:30] horrible boat because it would just
[1:05:32] absorb the water and then sink right
[1:05:35] away
[1:05:36] but he told him to get that type of wood
[1:05:39] to represent us
[1:05:41] because we're to be very porous and the
[1:05:44] reason we're to be porous
[1:05:46] is because then he had to go get an
[1:05:48] evergreen
[1:05:50] a tree that was green all year round
[1:05:54] representing christ jesus christ
[1:05:57] that he was to be life everlasting that
[1:06:00] he was green all the time there was
[1:06:03] always life
[1:06:04] life abundant in jesus christ and that
[1:06:07] he was to cut down that evergreen just
[1:06:10] as jesus christ was to be cut down
[1:06:14] how that he was his life was to be taken
[1:06:17] and that noah was to take the sap the
[1:06:20] life of the tree and he was to pour that
[1:06:24] sap heat it up and pour it into that
[1:06:27] gopher wood so that it would absorb the
[1:06:30] sap the very life of the evergreen tree
[1:06:35] and we realize that that is an absolute
[1:06:38] perfect type a perfect shadow of a
[1:06:41] believer being emptied out having
[1:06:44] nothing to offer god
[1:06:46] but when god offers his life you're to
[1:06:49] suck it up to be filled with that
[1:06:52] evergreen life to be filled with it and
[1:06:55] when you are then that boat not only
[1:06:58] does it float but brother branham said
[1:07:00] it was like iron that it was strong it
[1:07:03] was able to withstand those waves that
[1:07:06] would come crushing against the boat
[1:07:09] and that is what the holy ghost does for
[1:07:11] a believer is when the trials come when
[1:07:14] the tribulations come it's not so much
[1:07:17] that god has made you
[1:07:19] impermeable to the things of the world
[1:07:22] but the life that he put within you is
[1:07:25] able to absorb
[1:07:27] the blows even though it hurts when you
[1:07:30] get hit with the trials even though it
[1:07:32] hurts when you get hit with the
[1:07:33] tribulations the life of christ in you
[1:07:37] is able to when you want to say i give
[1:07:40] up or when you want to say i'm gonna i'm
[1:07:44] gonna get angry here the life of christ
[1:07:47] takes over
[1:07:50] and you find yourself acting in a way
[1:07:52] that's so different than what you
[1:07:55] naturally would do
[1:07:58] it's the life of christ
[1:08:01] that's doing that and so
[1:08:03] we see that
[1:08:05] that
[1:08:07] moses
[1:08:09] having these different types of wood
[1:08:12] overlaid in deity overlaid in gold or or
[1:08:15] in silver and
[1:08:18] and and brass and things like that of
[1:08:20] that nature
[1:08:24] he shows
[1:08:26] god shows moses this pattern for not
[1:08:28] only the tabernacle
[1:08:30] not only the clothing and and and even
[1:08:34] the ephod and
[1:08:35] that urim and thumb that the high
[1:08:37] priests and were supposed to wear
[1:08:45] but he takes the actual office of a high
[1:08:48] priest
[1:08:50] he then shows moses you're going to set
[1:08:52] up a priesthood
[1:08:55] and there's going to be a high priest
[1:08:56] and then there will be
[1:08:58] other priests under him but there will
[1:09:01] be one high priest
[1:09:03] and he's showing him this high priest
[1:09:05] and that
[1:09:06] on again on that day of atonement
[1:09:11] that once a year that the high priest
[1:09:14] not all of the other priests but only
[1:09:16] the high priest could go in to what we
[1:09:19] call the holiest of holies
[1:09:22] so we had the outer courts and
[1:09:24] and that's where the the congregation
[1:09:26] would bring in their sacrifices
[1:09:29] and there would be the brazen altar and
[1:09:31] and and the laver to wash
[1:09:36] then we had the the holy place and in
[1:09:39] there that's now going inside that
[1:09:41] building
[1:09:42] and it's like that first portion of that
[1:09:44] building and in there is the shoe bread
[1:09:47] on the table
[1:09:48] 12 pieces of bread
[1:09:50] two stacks of six
[1:09:52] bread on the table and then on the other
[1:09:55] side
[1:09:56] the candle sticks
[1:09:58] and those priests were to go in there
[1:10:00] not just the high priest but the priests
[1:10:02] could go in there they could eat of that
[1:10:04] bread
[1:10:05] and they had to make sure that those
[1:10:07] candles were constantly lit because they
[1:10:09] could smoke up and they could go out so
[1:10:11] they had to continually make sure that
[1:10:13] they were lit
[1:10:16] but behind that curtain inside that room
[1:10:20] then was behind that was the holiest of
[1:10:22] holies the holiest place
[1:10:25] and in there was
[1:10:27] the ark
[1:10:29] of the covenant
[1:10:30] and that was the box that had the
[1:10:32] tablets of
[1:10:34] of moses that had the ten commandments
[1:10:36] had the rod of aaron and it had an omer
[1:10:38] of of manna in it and the high priest
[1:10:40] could go in there once a year to atone
[1:10:42] for the sins of himself his family and
[1:10:44] for the congregation for the people
[1:10:50] in this message
[1:10:52] a hidden life in christ
[1:10:55] says now of course we know that god
[1:10:58] dwelt
[1:10:59] in all three of those places he was out
[1:11:02] there
[1:11:03] he was out there where the congregation
[1:11:05] was he lit the fire
[1:11:08] for the altar
[1:11:09] he was there
[1:11:12] with those people and and and and
[1:11:15] representing in that that that washing
[1:11:18] laver washing uh that the waters of
[1:11:22] separation there to wash the animal to
[1:11:24] clean it god's god's in that
[1:11:28] god's a part of that
[1:11:31] and then we go into that first portion
[1:11:33] where
[1:11:34] there's the the shoe bread what they
[1:11:37] called would be considered a a portion
[1:11:40] of the bread of life
[1:11:42] uh
[1:11:44] god's in that the candle sticks god's in
[1:11:47] that
[1:11:53] but brother branham says
[1:11:55] but we want to talk about the place
[1:11:57] where he
[1:11:58] where he was abiding
[1:12:00] and that was in the holiest of holies
[1:12:04] where the shekinah glory
[1:12:06] resided over that
[1:12:09] mercy seat
[1:12:11] we understand that we're
[1:12:14] we we get the imagery to that
[1:12:20] random
[1:12:21] often
[1:12:22] takes that to represent to us the three
[1:12:25] stages of grace
[1:12:27] justification
[1:12:29] sanctification
[1:12:31] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:33] and how that all three stages god is in
[1:12:36] that
[1:12:39] god it is god that brings you to that
[1:12:42] justification
[1:12:44] that just shall live by faith
[1:12:47] it is god that does that that is the
[1:12:50] grace that is an act of grace by god to
[1:12:53] us
[1:12:54] to even
[1:12:55] to to even reach down into the mud and
[1:12:59] pick us up out of the miry clay that's
[1:13:02] an act of god
[1:13:04] and then
[1:13:06] the sanctification part of it god
[1:13:09] cleaning the the things out of our life
[1:13:11] and
[1:13:12] my that you'll never get away from that
[1:13:15] as a believer you'll never get away from
[1:13:17] that sanctifying power god is
[1:13:19] continually cleaning us that never stops
[1:13:24] that never stops many a times we find
[1:13:26] there's still things that we hang on to
[1:13:29] in our life maybe it's a tradition maybe
[1:13:32] it's a complex maybe it's something that
[1:13:35] we picked up
[1:13:36] from a long time ago or that we seem to
[1:13:39] have made a habit in our life and we
[1:13:42] know
[1:13:42] god
[1:13:44] it's i maybe
[1:13:45] and maybe you think it's a great thing
[1:13:47] but later in life perhaps you realize
[1:13:50] it might be hindering me from going
[1:13:53] further with god
[1:13:55] and so we say god not my will but thy
[1:13:58] will be done take that thing away from
[1:14:01] me
[1:14:02] and you and and and you know you know as
[1:14:05] well as i do you've tried yourself to do
[1:14:09] it
[1:14:10] but you realize it's going to take god
[1:14:14] in the tender hand of jehovah who knows
[1:14:17] better than i do how to take that thing
[1:14:20] away
[1:14:22] as long as you're willing
[1:14:28] god knows when
[1:14:30] and god knows where
[1:14:32] and god knows how
[1:14:34] to do that
[1:14:37] sometimes it takes a fuller's brush to
[1:14:40] do it and that's some corn cob brush
[1:14:43] scrubbing
[1:14:44] and it will really take the hide off of
[1:14:46] you it'll it'll bring you to a place of
[1:14:49] humiliation it'll bring you to a place
[1:14:52] like a new birth again and you go oh my
[1:14:55] god that was rough
[1:14:57] that was you really dealt rough with me
[1:14:59] on that but he knew he had to
[1:15:02] he knew he had to to get that off of
[1:15:04] there some of these some washings they
[1:15:07] don't just come off with just with just
[1:15:10] running your hands under the water
[1:15:11] sometimes it takes some real working to
[1:15:15] get some of that grime off
[1:15:18] god knows
[1:15:27] and so what paul is showing here
[1:15:32] getting back to our text
[1:15:35] is that even
[1:15:37] the representation of the high priest
[1:15:42] going into that place
[1:15:45] called the holiest of holies
[1:15:49] paul says it right here in verse 19
[1:15:55] excuse me verse 20 by a new and living
[1:15:58] way which he hath consecrated talking
[1:16:01] about jesus christ
[1:16:04] that he hath consecrated for us through
[1:16:06] the veil that is to say
[1:16:09] his flesh
[1:16:13] now
[1:16:14] paul is
[1:16:15] giving
[1:16:16] the hebrews those who know about the old
[1:16:20] testament and know about the high priest
[1:16:23] going in behind the veil
[1:16:26] paul is letting them know that this man
[1:16:29] jesus
[1:16:30] not just the surface things not just the
[1:16:34] the breaking of the bread and and and
[1:16:37] and the multiplying of the bread and the
[1:16:39] fishes and and the healing of the sick
[1:16:42] that you all admired that about jesus
[1:16:45] you all admired that but
[1:16:48] behind that veil of that man
[1:16:52] tabernacled god himself
[1:16:56] he wasn't just a prophet he wasn't just
[1:16:59] a good man
[1:17:01] that was god in flesh
[1:17:06] that
[1:17:06] it was god himself
[1:17:09] he didn't send a second or third person
[1:17:13] of a trinity
[1:17:14] to come and die for your sins
[1:17:16] god himself
[1:17:19] built himself a body and came and dwelt
[1:17:23] inside that body and he
[1:17:26] the blood of jesus christ was the very
[1:17:29] blood of god that saves you
[1:17:34] that cleanses you it's not just the
[1:17:36] blood of a jew it's not just the blood
[1:17:39] of a gentile or samaritan it's not just
[1:17:42] the blood of some man this was the very
[1:17:45] blood of god
[1:17:49] and it's a very real subject and when
[1:17:52] the believer catches that and sees the
[1:17:55] revelation that this was none other than
[1:17:58] god jesus was not just another man was
[1:18:01] not just as as perhaps the jehovah's
[1:18:03] witness would say he was a good teacher
[1:18:06] he was a prophet no no he was god
[1:18:19] and this demonstration
[1:18:21] is speaking about the day of atonement
[1:18:24] when the high priest
[1:18:26] would go into that holiest of holies
[1:18:30] and and and no doubt
[1:18:33] everybody knows who he is
[1:18:35] he doesn't just show up on the day of
[1:18:37] atonement
[1:18:38] he's there every day
[1:18:41] but he's doing a certain act on that day
[1:18:44] but on every day everybody knows him
[1:18:47] you know
[1:18:48] rather so and so god bless you how are
[1:18:51] you it's good to see you yes good how
[1:18:53] are you how are the children
[1:18:56] how is life how are things oh brother
[1:18:59] let us talk if i could tell you the
[1:19:01] things you always come into my house
[1:19:04] i'll share with you
[1:19:05] you know and they and they commune they
[1:19:08] talked they knew
[1:19:10] wasn't a stranger
[1:19:16] he knows about unbelievers
[1:19:19] he knows about what an unbeliever life
[1:19:23] is like he's meeting him
[1:19:25] he's out there he's traveling with them
[1:19:27] through the he's wandering with them
[1:19:30] just like everybody they got to pack up
[1:19:32] the the tabernacle and they got to go
[1:19:34] they got to follow the cloud and follow
[1:19:36] the pillar of fire he's right with them
[1:19:38] he's meeting these other nations he's
[1:19:41] meeting them he's coming up against it
[1:19:44] he's a part of that too
[1:19:48] and then he knows about the make
[1:19:49] believer
[1:19:52] he knows about the things that happen in
[1:19:54] church
[1:19:55] he hears the stories like everybody else
[1:19:57] hears the stories going around in church
[1:20:01] he's meeting with the people brother how
[1:20:03] are you oh that things are good brother
[1:20:06] you're good and he's going uh-huh
[1:20:10] yeah
[1:20:11] i heard
[1:20:14] i know you say things are good but
[1:20:18] i know
[1:20:20] i know how things really are
[1:20:29] i'm
[1:20:30] wondering i have a quote here
[1:20:33] brother branham now
[1:20:36] goes into this
[1:20:39] i don't know if the brothers can pull
[1:20:40] this up or not
[1:20:44] i'll read it with you
[1:20:46] notice
[1:20:47] every year the high priest
[1:20:50] entered into that place
[1:20:52] the congregation followed him up
[1:20:55] when he went into this great place where
[1:20:57] the veil dropped behind him
[1:21:00] the inner courts
[1:21:02] the holiest of holies
[1:21:04] no one dared to go after him
[1:21:08] then
[1:21:09] he was alone with god
[1:21:14] what a beautiful picture it is today of
[1:21:16] a consecrated life
[1:21:19] who once enters into with christ
[1:21:23] dead to the things of the world
[1:21:26] hid away with god
[1:21:29] and the veils
[1:21:30] dropped down around
[1:21:33] and all the worlds shut off
[1:21:37] then christianity and religion becomes a
[1:21:40] pleasure
[1:21:41] to every believer
[1:21:46] today
[1:21:47] people just have enough religion to make
[1:21:50] them miserable
[1:21:52] knowing that they ought to do this
[1:21:54] they're trying to escape hell
[1:21:58] well
[1:21:59] if the way if that's the way i felt
[1:22:01] about it brother i don't know what i
[1:22:03] would do
[1:22:06] oh get in with christ
[1:22:08] shut off from the things of the world
[1:22:12] for to commune with him
[1:22:14] is a pleasure
[1:22:16] it's beautiful
[1:22:18] it's something that fills and satisfies
[1:22:22] the soul something that gives you peace
[1:22:25] that passes all understanding
[1:22:28] all the crosses
[1:22:30] become flying wings
[1:22:33] all the burdens are chariot wheels
[1:22:37] oh
[1:22:38] you can fly away
[1:22:41] my burdens are light
[1:22:44] yoke up with him
[1:22:45] the yoke is all padded with hallelujahs
[1:22:49] when you're once inside the veil with
[1:22:52] him
[1:22:53] he becomes

[1:23:48] if you want to see the secret life of a
[1:23:50] believer
[1:23:54] this is what it is
[1:23:57] they experience the same troubles
[1:24:00] they experience the same tribulation
[1:24:02] they've got to go through all the same
[1:24:04] places both those people go to
[1:24:07] they're out there
[1:24:09] it's not like
[1:24:10] it's not like you you don't know about
[1:24:12] what's going on in the world it's not
[1:24:14] like you're just ignorant and oblivious
[1:24:16] to the things that are going on in this
[1:24:18] world you're very aware of the things of
[1:24:20] this world you're so aware you're
[1:24:23] tempted by the same things they're
[1:24:25] tempted by
[1:24:27] god didn't
[1:24:28] didn't didn't uh
[1:24:30] you know excuse you from temptations oh
[1:24:33] no
[1:24:34] no no no you're just as human as they
[1:24:37] are
[1:24:38] you're just as tempted as they are
[1:24:39] you've got the same emotions they've got
[1:24:45] and you know what it is you know these
[1:24:47] things but you
[1:24:49] know a secret place
[1:24:52] that when all of the troubles when all
[1:24:54] of the buzz when all of the
[1:24:57] the noise and the things of the world
[1:24:59] when it all comes in on you there's a
[1:25:01] place you can go where the curtain
[1:25:03] closes behind you
[1:25:05] and that is shut off from you
[1:25:09] the cares of the world they go away
[1:25:14] and you in that place when you come out
[1:25:18] you come out renewed
[1:25:20] and it's like what was behind there
[1:25:22] exactly
[1:25:24] what is it that you're doing behind
[1:25:26] there what are you doing in this secret
[1:25:29] place
[1:25:30] that the world is wanting to know
[1:25:32] what is going on in there you're aging
[1:25:35] it's not a fountain of youth it's not
[1:25:37] like coronado you found the cup of
[1:25:39] coronado you know and you found this
[1:25:41] this this bubbling water that you're
[1:25:43] drinking and it's keeping you young even
[1:25:45] though we we'd love that right we would
[1:25:47] love that but it's not keeping us young
[1:25:48] we're growing old just like the rest we
[1:25:50] got the wrinkles to show it and you know
[1:25:53] we've got the the limps and the things
[1:25:55] to show the world and they're going okay
[1:25:56] well that's not it it's not like you've
[1:25:58] it's not like you're living a healthier
[1:26:00] life than me
[1:26:02] what is it you have learned that when
[1:26:05] all the pressures of the things that
[1:26:07] cannot be seen the forces that cannot be
[1:26:10] seen the pressures that come into your
[1:26:12] life that are not physical they're
[1:26:15] spiritual that you know about that
[1:26:18] there's a realm that is coming against
[1:26:20] you that is coming against the world
[1:26:23] the world has no explanation for that
[1:26:32] but you know
[1:26:34] because
[1:26:35] you've read and you've experienced that
[1:26:38] you're facing powers and principalities
[1:26:48] and you go into this place
[1:26:52] and when that veil drops behind you it's
[1:26:54] you and god
[1:26:58] it's just you and him
[1:27:01] and in
[1:27:02] there in there
[1:27:06] is manna
[1:27:11] there's manna
[1:27:13] that doesn't get old
[1:27:16] and you begin eating on that manna
[1:27:19] and it
[1:27:20] and it brings your blood sugar back up
[1:27:25] so that you're not just coming out
[1:27:27] swinging with hanger issues
[1:27:31] you're satisfied
[1:27:33] you're sustained
[1:27:35] you can go into that place into a prayer
[1:27:38] closet
[1:27:40] you can go in there with
[1:27:43] i know what i want to do
[1:27:45] i know what i want to answer
[1:27:47] i know if i have it my way this is what
[1:27:49] i do and many a times you come out with
[1:27:53] not my will
[1:27:56] but thy will be done lord
[1:27:58] and your answer seems to be surprisingly
[1:28:01] different
[1:28:03] than what you thought it was going to be
[1:28:06] it's different for your husband it's
[1:28:08] different for your wife it's different
[1:28:10] for your children
[1:28:14] it's different for at work
[1:28:18] it's different for your family it's
[1:28:20] different for your parents
[1:28:22] it's different than the answer you
[1:28:23] thought you were going to give them
[1:28:30] it's a secret place
[1:28:36] and there's a secret life in there
[1:28:44] brandon takes some time and he
[1:28:47] in this message he he says you live in a
[1:28:49] three-bedroom house he says now you may
[1:28:52] say no mine's eight bedrooms he says but
[1:28:54] i beg to differ it's three bedrooms
[1:28:57] every house is simply comprised of three
[1:29:00] three rooms
[1:29:02] the kitchen
[1:29:03] the living room
[1:29:04] and the bedroom
[1:29:07] now
[1:29:08] all the people
[1:29:10] probably under
[1:29:12] 50
[1:29:13] would say we have a bathroom well
[1:29:17] there was a day when the bathrooms were
[1:29:20] about 150 yards
[1:29:22] outside of the house
[1:29:24] and you had to go you had to you had to
[1:29:27] take the lantern
[1:29:28] and you had to go find the bathroom so a
[1:29:30] bathroom is just simply an accessory
[1:29:33] it's just leisure it's nice to have them
[1:29:36] thank god that that they're no longer
[1:29:38] you know have the moon cut in the doors
[1:29:43] but really a house is is
[1:29:46] is really made up of those three rooms
[1:29:49] the kitchen
[1:29:50] the living room and the bedroom
[1:29:52] and he finally comes down and he says
[1:29:55] you know the kitchen is where you eat
[1:29:57] that's where you're gonna go and he says
[1:29:59] it's like
[1:30:00] it's like for the unbeliever
[1:30:03] who comes right off the
[1:30:04] street they're they're coming into the
[1:30:07] kitchen
[1:30:08] they're coming into the place where
[1:30:09] we're all going to come to hear the word
[1:30:11] of god we're all coming pulling up to
[1:30:14] the table of god
[1:30:15] and we're all going to eat the same
[1:30:18] food that's delivered to us from the
[1:30:21] word of god we're all eating of that and
[1:30:23] it's a good place to be we love the
[1:30:25] kitchen
[1:30:27] some of us would would
[1:30:29] argue it's our favorite room in the
[1:30:31] house
[1:30:33] but then he says there's the parlor he
[1:30:35] calls it the parlor or the living room
[1:30:38] and this is where you have fellowship
[1:30:41] now this is outside of this this
[1:30:43] building here this is outside of these
[1:30:45] pews this is this is out in our homes
[1:30:49] this is out at the restaurant this is
[1:30:51] now where we're having fellowship
[1:30:54] with believers we've accepted we've
[1:30:56] received the word we've received the
[1:30:57] food and then we go to digest it
[1:31:00] together
[1:31:01] and we begin talking and saying now what
[1:31:03] does that mean when it says this now i'm
[1:31:06] an unbeliever and then and i i'm using
[1:31:09] this as an illustration
[1:31:12] and i've i've heard i came to church and
[1:31:14] i heard these words but i have no
[1:31:15] understanding
[1:31:17] i need fellowship
[1:31:19] so that i can see a real life
[1:31:22] interpretation of what i heard
[1:31:26] i'd like to know
[1:31:27] is this real today
[1:31:30] i know the bible says jesus christ the
[1:31:33] same yesterday today and forever
[1:31:36] show me
[1:31:39] show me is that real you say it's real
[1:31:43] tell me brother sit down it's time
[1:31:46] sister sit down it's testimony time
[1:31:50] let me tell you about a real live god
[1:31:53] today
[1:31:55] that's the part of the room
[1:31:57] but that third room
[1:31:59] is the bedroom
[1:32:02] and that's a place not everybody's
[1:32:04] allowed to just walk mosey on in and go
[1:32:07] to
[1:32:08] that's the secret place that's a place
[1:32:12] of rest brother branham says
[1:32:15] a place of rest
[1:32:23] it's the place where the veil drops
[1:32:25] behind you its rest from the trials and
[1:32:28] tribulations
[1:32:34] its rest from the buzz of the world
[1:32:38] its rest to revitalize
[1:32:41] and prepare
[1:32:44] for an eternal rest
[1:32:53] this
[1:32:56] secret
[1:32:58] life of a believer
[1:33:00] now is not a once a year thing
[1:33:04] like the high priest
[1:33:08] it's an everyday thing
[1:33:13] it's an everyday thing that
[1:33:16] on calvary when jesus
[1:33:18] died and that
[1:33:20] veil in the temple was rent from top to
[1:33:23] bottom
[1:33:24] it was allowing us to know
[1:33:26] he made an access he made a way
[1:33:29] for us to become kings and priests that
[1:33:32] now we have free access by the baptism
[1:33:37] of the holy ghost
[1:33:38] we have free access into that place on a
[1:33:43] daily basis
[1:33:45] that the sacrifice has been made that
[1:33:48] the blood is there for atonement that
[1:33:52] you now can go in there and you can
[1:33:54] atone
[1:33:55] every day every minute every second if
[1:33:58] you'd like to you can go in there and
[1:34:01] you can apply the blood of jesus christ
[1:34:04] for you for your house for your friends
[1:34:06] for your loved ones you can apply the
[1:34:08] blood of jesus christ and say god mercy
[1:34:11] mercy god show them the way god give
[1:34:14] them the way god let them come into this
[1:34:18] same place that i'm in bring them into
[1:34:20] this secret place
[1:34:22] god
[1:34:27] it's a daily life this is a secret life
[1:34:31] and it's it's it's it's daily and and
[1:34:33] more and more on
[1:34:36] brothers and sisters as this world every
[1:34:39] every roll of the sun every turn of the
[1:34:42] earth i find that i we need to go in
[1:34:45] there more and more and more
[1:34:52] the the the buzz seems to get louder the
[1:34:55] the the things that come across your way
[1:34:57] that are flash that are pushed in your
[1:34:59] face are enough that you can say mercy
[1:35:02] god oh mercy god i i i can't believe the
[1:35:06] what the the things i'm hearing i can't
[1:35:08] believe the things i'm seeing i've got
[1:35:11] to go to a place where where it makes
[1:35:13] sense where i've got rest where
[1:35:16] where there's sanity and you go and you
[1:35:18] drop that veil behind you
[1:35:22] and you say
[1:35:23] i don't need to get caught up in all of
[1:35:24] that
[1:35:28] i don't need to i don't need to be
[1:35:30] involved in that i don't need to put in
[1:35:33] my two cents
[1:35:34] on those matters
[1:35:36] this
[1:35:37] is the life
[1:35:39] that i belong to this is the place where
[1:35:42] i belong and you you when you enter into
[1:35:45] that presence when you've gone in behind
[1:35:47] that veil and the love of god and the
[1:35:50] life of christ seems to just be there
[1:35:55] it amazes me more and more with every
[1:35:57] tape i put on i go oh god that is so
[1:36:01] right
[1:36:02] oh it's so real
[1:36:04] it's so what i believe
[1:36:09] every time i sit down and i open my
[1:36:12] bible and i begin to read i say oh god
[1:36:16] this is what i believe
[1:36:18] this is what i want to feed upon
[1:36:23] and i believe that
[1:36:25] when we have a life a daily
[1:36:28] secret life
[1:36:31] with him
[1:36:34] that when you when we have a life where
[1:36:36] this is a daily process
[1:36:40] it's just part of our nature
[1:36:42] to go into that place
[1:36:45] you turn the news you say well i want to
[1:36:46] hear the news for the day you turn it on
[1:36:48] and you go
[1:36:49] oh my
[1:36:50] this world's falling apart
[1:36:52] and you turn it off and you say i'd
[1:36:54] better go back into that place you go
[1:36:56] into that place you clear your mind you
[1:36:58] clear your heart then you say all right
[1:37:00] it's off to work
[1:37:01] then you go to work
[1:37:04] and
[1:37:05] you meet people and
[1:37:07] they just
[1:37:09] you just can't believe the things that
[1:37:11] the disregard for for for a believer the
[1:37:14] disregard the disrespect for
[1:37:18] and and you get done with work and and
[1:37:20] and you got these people and they're
[1:37:22] frustrated they're mad at the world and
[1:37:24] and you got these people and they're
[1:37:25] frustrated and they're mad at the world
[1:37:27] and you get home from work and there's
[1:37:29] your beautiful family and you say i've
[1:37:31] got to just i've got to go into a secret
[1:37:33] place here before i go in talk to my
[1:37:36] family and you go into that secret place
[1:37:38] so that you can clear your heart so that
[1:37:41] you can clear your mind so that you can
[1:37:43] have a home life
[1:37:44] that's conducive for a believer
[1:37:47] and not for all that you just went
[1:37:49] through the last eight ten hours
[1:37:59] and when this is a daily process
[1:38:08] this secret life
[1:38:10] it's culminating
[1:38:14] it's a building it's a strengthening
[1:38:18] for that secret and sudden going away of
[1:38:21] the church
[1:38:25] in the rapture message
[1:38:28] brother branham uses these scriptures
[1:38:33] in
[1:38:34] his opening scriptures psalms 27
[1:38:38] and he reads verses 1 through 5
[1:38:40] and it says
[1:38:42] the lord is my light and my salvation
[1:38:44] whom shall i fear
[1:38:47] the lord is the strength of my life
[1:38:49] of whom shall i be afraid
[1:38:53] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[1:38:55] foes came upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:38:59] they stumbled and fell though when host
[1:39:02] should encamp against me
[1:39:04] my heart shall not fear
[1:39:07] the war should rise against me
[1:39:10] in this will i be confident
[1:39:13] one thing have i desired of the lord
[1:39:16] that will i seek after
[1:39:18] that i may dwell in the house of the
[1:39:20] lord
[1:39:21] all the days of my life
[1:39:23] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[1:39:26] inquire in his temple
[1:39:28] for in the time of trouble
[1:39:32] he shall hide me
[1:39:34] in his pavilion
[1:39:36] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:39:40] hide me
[1:39:41] he shall set me up
[1:39:44] upon a rock
[1:39:46] what an interesting
[1:39:48] scripture to read
[1:39:50] for a subject of the rapture
[1:39:56] but it makes sense
[1:39:59] because one of these days
[1:40:02] we're getting out of here
[1:40:06] we're getting out of this place
[1:40:08] and he's going to secretly take us away
[1:40:11] and hide us
[1:40:13] in a place
[1:40:15] where there's only peace forevermore
[1:40:17] where we're permanently for all the rest
[1:40:20] of eternity in the presence
[1:40:23] of god
[1:40:25] it's the secret of his tabernacle now
[1:40:29] later on in that message
[1:40:32] brother branham
[1:40:35] it's within i believe the first 30
[1:40:37] minutes of that message
[1:40:39] brother branham uses these scriptures
[1:40:41] and and the reason he does is because he
[1:40:43] he starts the message asking the
[1:40:45] question how many believe there's going
[1:40:48] to be a rapture
[1:40:51] and
[1:40:52] he takes those first 30 minutes of that
[1:40:55] message
[1:40:56] to
[1:40:57] to
[1:40:58] build the faith of the believer and to
[1:41:01] build the faith of anybody that will
[1:41:02] believe that there is going to be a
[1:41:05] rapture
[1:41:07] and he and he
[1:41:09] he's wanting to show you it's scriptural
[1:41:14] that we know the word rapture isn't in
[1:41:16] the bible but what we're speaking about
[1:41:18] is the catching away of the church
[1:41:22] that that that that changing of uh
[1:41:25] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:41:28] we shall be changed and that the dead in
[1:41:30] christ shall rise first and we shall
[1:41:31] meet them in the air
[1:41:33] on that day of the rapture
[1:41:38] but he wants you to know
[1:41:40] it's scriptural
[1:41:42] you can base
[1:41:44] that belief that there's going to be a
[1:41:47] rapture on the word of god
[1:41:50] it's not just something that you could
[1:41:52] say well i
[1:41:53] i believe it
[1:41:55] i don't have any foundation for it but
[1:41:56] it's just something that i simply
[1:41:59] believe that's what the world is going
[1:42:00] on right now
[1:42:02] well i believe this well then your your
[1:42:04] idea is just as good as the next but
[1:42:07] this is founded
[1:42:09] upon the eternal word of god
[1:42:13] this is founded and so when you say i i
[1:42:17] believe there's going to be a day when
[1:42:20] jesus christ himself the body of christ
[1:42:23] is going to come back to earth and we
[1:42:27] will be changed if i'm alive my body
[1:42:30] will be changed if i've gone in the
[1:42:32] grave i'm coming up
[1:42:35] that day is coming i believe it
[1:42:39] and i believe that i've got a foundation
[1:42:41] to believe it
[1:42:54] but brother i'm in those first 30
[1:42:56] minutes says
[1:42:58] there will be doubters
[1:43:02] of that
[1:43:03] there will be scoffers of what you say
[1:43:06] you believe
[1:43:08] and he reads here in second peter
[1:43:11] chapter 3 and i'm going to read verses 3
[1:43:13] and 4
[1:43:14] knowing this first that there shall come
[1:43:17] in the last days scoffers
[1:43:20] walking after their own lusts and saying
[1:43:24] where is the promise of his coming
[1:43:27] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[1:43:30] things continue as they were from the
[1:43:32] beginning of the creation
[1:43:36] so
[1:43:37] rest assured little bride

[1:44:28] that's a scoffer
[1:44:37] i want to read you something from
[1:44:40] the sudden secret
[1:44:41] going away of the church
[1:44:44] brother branham says
[1:44:48] people live today
[1:44:50] as though just before the coming of the
[1:44:52] lord jesus if he's going to send a host
[1:44:55] of angels down to all the newspapers
[1:44:59] and
[1:45:01] and for a year so announce it throughout
[1:45:03] all the world in the newspaper that on
[1:45:05] such and such a date jesus will arrive
[1:45:09] and to have it broadcast by the radio
[1:45:11] and put on the televisions and
[1:45:12] everywhere just the day and just the
[1:45:15] hour that he was coming
[1:45:17] now that's the way people live today
[1:45:19] but god has said in his word
[1:45:22] that it would be like a thief in the
[1:45:25] night coming
[1:45:27] if that would be so people would say as
[1:45:30] the world thinks today oh well there's
[1:45:32] just plenty of time it'll be well
[1:45:34] announced
[1:45:36] and but you see
[1:45:37] it is announced
[1:45:39] but it's a secret announcing
[1:45:42] it's just those who are willing to hear
[1:45:45] it
[1:45:46] those who are willing to consider it
[1:45:49] and
[1:45:50] who loves the lord
[1:46:01] if this secret life
[1:46:05] is an everyday life for you
[1:46:09] then when that secret
[1:46:10] coming comes
[1:46:13] you'll be a part of that
[1:46:16] you'll be there
[1:46:18] you've already been living
[1:46:20] you've already been living in that
[1:46:22] presence
[1:46:23] you've already been you've already been
[1:46:25] talking
[1:46:26] you've already you've already been in
[1:46:28] fellowship you've already you've
[1:46:32] you're like joseph's bride
[1:46:34] who's
[1:46:36] back in the temple
[1:46:38] he's coming in there to talk to you
[1:46:41] you know you know his heart
[1:46:45] you know what he says
[1:46:47] you desire to know it you've searched it
[1:46:50] you've sought it you you're seeking it
[1:46:53] he he's he's showed himself faithful
[1:46:59] every time
[1:47:04] i wonder if the brothers could pull this
[1:47:05] up i'm closing with this
[1:47:09] brother branham finishes
[1:47:11] the sermon
[1:47:16] the secret the sudden secret going away
[1:47:18] of the church
[1:47:22] i'm just going to read it with you right
[1:47:24] here
[1:47:25] you know the story but just listen to
[1:47:27] the language
[1:47:28] that brother branham uses
[1:47:31] and keep in your mind
[1:47:33] this idea
[1:47:35] of this secret life
[1:47:38] and that this secret life
[1:47:41] one day
[1:47:42] it's culminating
[1:47:44] it's building
[1:47:48] to a secret coming
[1:47:52] it's on one of those ranches where the
[1:47:54] great packing companies buy their cattle
[1:47:56] run them into the mountains and then
[1:47:58] bring them out after calves are born
[1:48:00] in the fall of the year and brand them
[1:48:02] and sell off some of the old herd and
[1:48:04] the steers and so forth and go ahead
[1:48:07] into the accumulate their great herds of
[1:48:09] cattle
[1:48:10] and on this certain ranch the owner of
[1:48:12] the caretaker
[1:48:14] what we call there the top the foreman
[1:48:17] he had about five daughters
[1:48:19] they were all beautiful women young
[1:48:21] single
[1:48:22] and there was a little lady there which
[1:48:24] was a cousin of these girls
[1:48:27] that her father and mother had both
[1:48:29] deceased
[1:48:30] and she was brought over there to be to
[1:48:33] live with her her uncle
[1:48:35] and those girls
[1:48:36] they was in those fancy type of frilly
[1:48:39] frocks you know and
[1:48:40] they just took this poor little girl and
[1:48:42] they just treated her like she was some
[1:48:44] animal all the hard work poured right on
[1:48:48] her
[1:48:48] she washed the dishes she cleaned up she
[1:48:51] fixed the bunks she had to do it all
[1:48:54] and they just stayed around with
[1:48:56] polished fingernails and manicures and
[1:48:58] stuff on their lips and all fixed up you
[1:49:00] know just prissy
[1:49:02] and especially did they do this when
[1:49:05] they heard that from chicago the big
[1:49:08] packing company who owned the outfit
[1:49:10] his young single son was coming to visit
[1:49:13] the ranch oh did they dyke out in all
[1:49:16] good clothes
[1:49:17] ah
[1:49:19] did they dress and make ready for his
[1:49:21] coming and each night the conversation
[1:49:23] would be they were going to vamp this
[1:49:26] young man and marry him who would and
[1:49:29] they would own the ranch themselves for
[1:49:31] the sun would fall air to all so they
[1:49:34] made themselves ready
[1:49:36] so you see
[1:49:37] there is a ready to be made
[1:49:40] you make yourself ready
[1:49:42] by joining church or something that
[1:49:45] ain't all that's required
[1:49:47] you got to have oil in your lamp see
[1:49:52] just your dressing say we'll build a big
[1:49:54] church we'll belong to a better
[1:49:55] denomination we'll get a little pipe
[1:49:57] organ to the lord we'll make plush seats
[1:50:01] that isn't what god requires
[1:50:05] righteousness is what god requires in
[1:50:08] his son
[1:50:09] jesus christ jesus that's the garments
[1:50:13] for the bible said the white clothes
[1:50:15] which she is adorned in is the
[1:50:17] righteousness of this
[1:50:18] of the saints
[1:50:20] so she
[1:50:21] these girls
[1:50:22] thought they would make themselves ready
[1:50:24] for the coming of this young man course
[1:50:26] that poor little cousin that reminds me
[1:50:28] of an offcast somewhere
[1:50:31] you could appreciate her
[1:50:33] she was a beautiful woman
[1:50:34] but oh my she was a nice little girl but
[1:50:37] she was not even considered among them
[1:50:40] not as a relative
[1:50:42] now that's about the true picture of the
[1:50:44] real church today before the
[1:50:46] denominations
[1:50:48] not even considered a bunch of inner
[1:50:51] denominationals a bunch of outcasts
[1:50:54] so the poor little fella
[1:50:56] just went ahead working
[1:50:58] when the young man arrived
[1:50:59] they didn't know it but he come looking
[1:51:01] for a wife
[1:51:03] he was sick and tired of the city girls
[1:51:06] who just stayed all dolled up and oh you
[1:51:09] know hung around the bar rooms and rode
[1:51:11] around in the cadillacs and the
[1:51:13] different things they were just sick and
[1:51:15] tired of it he thought i'll go out west
[1:51:19] and hunt me a real girl that'll be a
[1:51:21] real mother to my babies
[1:51:25] and somebody
[1:51:26] will not hang
[1:51:28] at all the sewing circles and the
[1:51:30] societies and things
[1:51:33] but will just be a real mother
[1:51:36] what did he find when he got there
[1:51:38] but the same thing that he had condemned
[1:51:40] in chicago
[1:51:43] i wonder if the lord jesus will find a
[1:51:45] church
[1:51:47] just a denomination
[1:51:49] just by name a church
[1:51:52] no oil in the lamps not ready to go
[1:51:57] oh they got fine frocks they got the
[1:51:59] biggest churches the biggest this and
[1:52:01] all these things
[1:52:03] but god don't want that
[1:52:07] he wants you as an individual
[1:52:11] they may have the best pastors
[1:52:14] they may have the finest deacon boards
[1:52:16] but he wants you
[1:52:18] with oil
[1:52:20] he's coming to catch that oil
[1:52:24] and bride away
[1:52:27] and as he
[1:52:29] this boy looked upon them
[1:52:31] he was disheartened
[1:52:33] and that night they were having
[1:52:34] something in the or on the order in them
[1:52:36] days it's been long ago they called the
[1:52:39] charleston
[1:52:40] which is just like a rock and roll and
[1:52:42] they were going to throw one of those
[1:52:43] big parties many of you people remember
[1:52:45] that old charleston dance they did back
[1:52:48] when i was a kid when i was out there
[1:52:50] and so they were all had their little
[1:52:53] black and white clothes on you know to
[1:52:55] do the oh it was called the charleston's
[1:52:57] and black bottom that's what they were
[1:53:00] calling and they had them two-tone
[1:53:02] clothes and they were going to do these
[1:53:04] dances
[1:53:06] but this boy was sick of that stuff
[1:53:09] he was hunting for a real girl so he
[1:53:12] slipped out of their party he was
[1:53:14] watching them he went in to look at them
[1:53:18] so is another son that i know of another
[1:53:21] son will come to your church
[1:53:24] he'll son of god he'll come there he'll
[1:53:27] look around he'll see your fine dress
[1:53:31] he'll know that you're a good member
[1:53:34] but he's looking for something different
[1:53:37] from just the regular trend of church
[1:53:43] so as he looked around after a while he
[1:53:45] was so discouraged he walked out the
[1:53:48] door
[1:53:49] and going back walking in the moonlight
[1:53:52] towards the bunk house he heard somebody
[1:53:54] kind of humming and he looked around and
[1:53:56] here went this little girl with a great
[1:53:58] big pan of dishwater way in the night
[1:54:00] barefooted to throw the dishwater out
[1:54:03] and as soon as he saw her something
[1:54:05] another said that's her that's the one
[1:54:08] so he put herself in the way and when
[1:54:10] she that's when she come back along the
[1:54:13] corral fence why he was standing there
[1:54:15] and she almost fainted oh i like that
[1:54:19] he put himself in the way
[1:54:23] he made sure
[1:54:25] you'd run into him
[1:54:27] he said how you do
[1:54:30] and he said what's your name and she
[1:54:31] told him her name and
[1:54:33] it was the same name of the boss of the
[1:54:35] ranch said
[1:54:36] then i can't understand how that this is
[1:54:38] that your father said no i'm just a
[1:54:41] cousin you see my father and he were
[1:54:43] brothers i've got the same name
[1:54:46] but i that's the boss
[1:54:49] you might have the name of the of church
[1:54:52] you might have the name of branham
[1:54:54] tabernacle or methodist or whatever
[1:54:57] church you go
[1:54:58] that isn't it friend
[1:55:00] see
[1:55:01] it's something different
[1:55:03] it's your character
[1:55:05] that's what god is looking at you might
[1:55:09] be methodist you might be baptist you
[1:55:12] might be presbyterian it's not that
[1:55:16] it's character that god looks at
[1:55:19] not just earthly character but holy
[1:55:22] spirit character
[1:55:24] these signs shall follow them that
[1:55:26] believe said jesus
[1:55:28] in the 16th chapter of saint mark
[1:55:30] she was so gotten that that he would
[1:55:33] speak to her even
[1:55:35] grace
[1:55:38] and she hung her little head down and
[1:55:40] she ran into the house
[1:55:42] he was there for a week or two and he
[1:55:44] looked all around everywhere and he
[1:55:46] never said no more but he kept watching
[1:55:48] her and the night before he left he was
[1:55:50] to leave the next morning they was
[1:55:52] throwing another big party and he
[1:55:54] watched for her he couldn't find her he
[1:55:56] knowed she'd had to do the dishes and so
[1:55:58] forth so the dirty work and all could be
[1:56:01] throwed off
[1:56:03] and that's the way the real church of
[1:56:04] god has to take it sometime the dirty
[1:56:07] work
[1:56:08] all the scandal names and all of the
[1:56:10] thing that's mean to be thrown at it
[1:56:13] and she's a great speckled bird
[1:56:17] all the other birds gather around and
[1:56:19] flock at her that's all right her name
[1:56:22] is on the lamb's book of life
[1:56:24] she'll spread her great wings someday
[1:56:26] for a flight she's ready them speckles
[1:56:29] meant the blood of christ sprinkled on
[1:56:31] her see you've read it in your book the
[1:56:34] bible
[1:56:35] and this boy caught the little lady that
[1:56:38] night coming out he said i've watched
[1:56:40] you
[1:56:41] no one knows it but myself he said i've
[1:56:44] come out here looking for a wife
[1:56:46] and all that i've ever seen you meet the
[1:56:48] requirements
[1:56:50] how did she feel
[1:56:52] the big man's son asking her now if she
[1:56:55] would be his wife
[1:56:57] just imagine how those girls must have
[1:56:59] felt when they looked out their window
[1:57:01] and saw holding hands with that little
[1:57:03] despised cousin the man that they tried
[1:57:06] to vamp with all their big fine frocks
[1:57:09] and frills and carrying on and he said
[1:57:12] will you marry me
[1:57:14] oh she said sir
[1:57:17] i'm not worthy
[1:57:19] that's the way the real church feels
[1:57:21] about it
[1:57:22] i'm not worthy
[1:57:24] i can't if i could just
[1:57:26] wash your dishes it'll be all right
[1:57:29] are you willing to take that place
[1:57:33] could you wash the dishes from the
[1:57:34] supper
[1:57:36] would you be willing to be called
[1:57:38] fanatic
[1:57:40] would you be willing to take the way
[1:57:42] with the lord's despised few
[1:57:44] are you willing
[1:57:47] are you willing at your work to be
[1:57:49] marked there's a man he's a religious
[1:57:51] fanatic because he won't drink he won't
[1:57:54] smoke he doesn't dance he doesn't run
[1:57:56] with women there's a woman that keeps
[1:57:58] her head down she walks like down
[1:58:00] through the town she's not she won't
[1:58:02] join our circles
[1:58:06] are you willing to take the way make
[1:58:07] yourself ready for the coming of the
[1:58:09] lord if you have if you do
[1:58:11] you'll be waiting for him to come
[1:58:14] you'll joy at his coming it won't be a
[1:58:17] dreadful thing it'll be the most
[1:58:18] gracious moment that you can think of
[1:58:21] the coming of the lord
[1:58:23] all those that love his appearing
[1:58:27] so when he left he told her he would be
[1:58:29] back at a certain time said when you
[1:58:31] begin to see it was the winter said when
[1:58:33] you begin to see those trees begin to
[1:58:35] bud yonder that mesquite and stuff begin
[1:58:38] to take on new life said then i'll be
[1:58:41] back about springtime
[1:58:43] i understand i couldn't say it was true
[1:58:45] but the girl only got about a dollar and
[1:58:47] 75 cents a week for her labor but she
[1:58:50] saved every penny of it why she was
[1:58:52] getting ready for the wedding that was
[1:58:54] to be
[1:58:56] she was saving her money for her wedding
[1:58:58] gown
[1:58:59] for he said we'll be married right here
[1:59:01] at the ranch when i come again she saved
[1:59:03] her money all year she was happy she
[1:59:05] didn't mind washing the dishes she
[1:59:07] didn't mind ironing the clothes or
[1:59:09] sweeping out the bunk house or what more
[1:59:11] she was engaged to the boss of the ranch
[1:59:15] what do we care what the world says a
[1:59:18] real christian
[1:59:19] what do we care if we have to be
[1:59:22] despised and rejected
[1:59:24] blessed are the meek for they shall
[1:59:26] inherit the earth the boss's son is a
[1:59:28] coming one day and we're going to a
[1:59:30] wedding supper what difference does it
[1:59:33] make to us if you love his appearing
[1:59:36] after it
[1:59:38] was all the days past the little
[1:59:40] daughters the little cousins made fun of
[1:59:42] her danced around her and done
[1:59:43] everything else well said you poor silly
[1:59:46] kid do you know if that why he was just
[1:59:48] like all other men he was just teasing
[1:59:51] you
[1:59:52] scoffers
[1:59:56] but the son of god doesn't tease
[1:59:59] except a man be born again he will in no
[2:00:01] wise i don't care how good you look how
[2:00:04] much church you belong to what your
[2:00:06] status is in the country you might be a
[2:00:09] politician you might be in the federal
[2:00:10] government you might be in the catholic
[2:00:13] presbyterian any church you want to be
[2:00:15] but it's except a man be born again you
[2:00:19] will not enter and these signs shall
[2:00:21] follow them that believe i'm only
[2:00:23] quoting his word
[2:00:25] finally when the hour comes she began to
[2:00:27] see this the buds began to come on the
[2:00:29] trees she knew he would be there at any
[2:00:32] time and he said i'll try to make it
[2:00:34] just as sundown so we can be married and
[2:00:36] hurry off and every evening at sundown
[2:00:39] when she would go and get make herself
[2:00:41] already get her little wedding garment
[2:00:43] on and wait at the gate
[2:00:45] and these little cousins come and laugh
[2:00:47] at her make fun of her and said you poor
[2:00:51] silly ignorant child
[2:00:52] to think that the man who owns he's the
[2:00:55] president rather of the company that
[2:00:57] this boy would marry a dishwasher
[2:01:00] he was looking for virtue
[2:01:02] not clothes
[2:01:05] he had enough money to buy all the
[2:01:07] clothes was necessary
[2:01:09] god don't care how big
[2:01:11] your fancy things you have he owns
[2:01:14] everything in the world
[2:01:15] so he wants virtue he wants something
[2:01:17] that's real
[2:01:19] so finally one evening while she was
[2:01:21] standing there and they were laughing
[2:01:22] and making fun of her and telling her
[2:01:24] she was silly all at once they heard
[2:01:27] some hoofs of prancing what happened
[2:01:30] across the hill come a buck board now a

[2:02:04] threw herself in his arms and he said
[2:02:06] darling
[2:02:07] i've had a man stationed on this ranch
[2:02:11] since i left here last year
[2:02:13] that's brought me a report of everything
[2:02:16] that you've done god has got a man
[2:02:19] stationed in this tabernacle this
[2:02:21] morning
[2:02:23] he's called the holy spirit
[2:02:26] he knows the secrets of your heart
[2:02:30] he knows everything that you've done or
[2:02:33] what you think
[2:02:35] he tells the father everything that you
[2:02:38] do
[2:02:38] he brings the message back and forth
[2:02:43] oh my
[2:02:50] you have a secret life
[2:02:53] he knows about it
[2:02:56] what's your secret life like
[2:02:58] he knows about it
[2:03:02] he said
[2:03:03] and he has told me that you've waited
[2:03:05] and you've worked and you've labored
[2:03:07] patiently waiting for me to come
[2:03:10] now you've been a slave for a long time
[2:03:13] but now your slave days are over
[2:03:16] i've brought along the minister right
[2:03:18] under this rose trellis you've become my
[2:03:20] wife he kissed her put the wedding ring
[2:03:23] on her finger and picked her up and set
[2:03:25] her in the buck board with his arm
[2:03:27] around her and drove off to find this
[2:03:29] new big palace
[2:03:31] on
[2:03:31] on outer drive in chicago the selected
[2:03:35] of the nation where she could live as
[2:03:37] his bride why
[2:03:38] she was ready
[2:03:40] she had lived and been the kind of a
[2:03:43] woman that he wanted
[2:03:46] it happened just at the spare of the
[2:03:49] moment
[2:03:50] and that sudden
[2:03:52] secret coming of the lord
[2:03:55] the world don't know it's going to
[2:03:57] happen
[2:03:59] but we do
[2:04:01] it's at hand
[2:04:03] don't be like the young lady
[2:04:06] they stripped the clothes from in pearl
[2:04:08] harbor you'll go down in disgrace
[2:04:13] be like the one who made herself ready
[2:04:16] and kept her virtues
[2:04:18] and was waiting for the coming of the
[2:04:20] lord
[2:04:21] because it'll be secret and sudden
[2:04:30] i close with that story
[2:04:39] none of this should surprise us
[2:04:43] as a believer
[2:04:46] if on a daily basis you've been going in
[2:04:49] behind that veil into that secret place
[2:04:53] that secret
[2:04:54] sudden coming
[2:04:57] it's not secret to you
[2:05:01] you're used to that
[2:05:04] that sudden coming oh it'll be sudden
[2:05:07] but it won't catch you
[2:05:10] it won't
[2:05:11] catch you like when when the child's got
[2:05:13] his hand caught in the cookie jar
[2:05:15] the shock of guilt and i got god
[2:05:19] it'll be sudden
[2:05:25] it's here
[2:05:27] it's what i've been living for
[2:05:30] this is what my life has been
[2:05:32] this is what my secret walk has been all
[2:05:36] along
[2:05:39] and i say that
[2:05:40] to say this if there's somebody who
[2:05:43] doesn't know
[2:05:45] about that secret life if you say oh
[2:05:48] i've got a secret life all right
[2:05:52] but it sounds a little bit more like the
[2:05:54] secret the other secret lives you were
[2:05:56] talking about before
[2:05:58] i would
[2:06:00] i would invite you if that
[2:06:03] is pricking at your heart
[2:06:05] if that's the goad
[2:06:07] the shepherd's goad that god is using to
[2:06:09] prick your heart
[2:06:11] like he did paul
[2:06:13] paul paul saul saul how long will you
[2:06:17] kick against the pricks
[2:06:19] that pricks is goad
[2:06:21] how long will you kick against the
[2:06:24] shepherd's goad
[2:06:25] that's what he has at the end of his
[2:06:27] staff
[2:06:28] at the end of a shepherd's staff on the
[2:06:31] one end is the hook
[2:06:32] that's to pull you up
[2:06:34] from the places you've fallen but on the
[2:06:37] other end
[2:06:38] is a goad now that goad could be a brass
[2:06:41] ball
[2:06:42] or that goad could be a little bit sharp
[2:06:45] and it's enough to prick your heart
[2:06:48] to say come unto me
[2:06:50] all ye that labor and our heavy laden
[2:06:53] i'll give you rest
[2:06:56] i'll give you rest
[2:06:59] why don't you come in
[2:07:01] why don't you just come in behind that
[2:07:03] veil
[2:07:04] let the curtains drop
[2:07:07] and the things of the world
[2:07:11] leave them behind
[2:07:13] leave them behind
[2:07:16] we're not looking for frilly frogs
[2:07:19] we're not looking for big churches and
[2:07:22] fancy pews and
[2:07:24] and and
[2:07:25] and and the numbers
[2:07:27] filling this church up is is is
[2:07:29] certainly no sign
[2:07:31] that that you're any more spiritual
[2:07:34] that you're any closer to god
[2:07:38] it's a life
[2:07:40] it's that secret life consecrated
[2:07:45] and i and i
[2:07:47] only say this to put out an invitation
[2:07:50] that if there is
[2:07:52] would be in this place an unbeliever or
[2:07:54] even a make-believer
[2:07:56] who say i've just been faking it till i
[2:07:59] can make it
[2:08:00] you don't have to fake it anymore
[2:08:03] you don't got to fake it anymore
[2:08:05] come with a surrendered heart
[2:08:08] come to the altar that's in your heart
[2:08:12] it'd be right there in your seat
[2:08:14] it can be in your car
[2:08:16] it can be in your closet it can be in
[2:08:18] your bedroom
[2:08:20] it could be in a in a
[2:08:26] a generator room at work
[2:08:29] wherever that place is that you can find
[2:08:31] him and get away
[2:08:32] and surrender your heart to him and
[2:08:34] enter into that place i would invite you
[2:08:37] i would encourage you why don't you go
[2:08:39] in why don't you go meet him i wonder if
[2:08:41] we would stand and we could pray
[2:08:43] together
[2:08:49] you just pray in your own way and
[2:08:52] for those of you that know about this
[2:08:55] secret life with christ
[2:09:06] just pray
[2:09:12] set upon your heart somebody
[2:09:16] that doesn't know about that that you'd
[2:09:18] like to see
[2:09:20] come
[2:09:22] see if god could call to their spirit
[2:09:26] bring them back
[2:09:28] bring them back into the full
[2:09:32] our precious lord we
[2:09:35] we love you lord
[2:09:38] we just love your word
[2:09:40] oh god it's so precious to us
[2:09:46] it's words of life to us and
[2:09:49] lord we know about
[2:09:52] going in behind that veil
[2:09:55] we know about
[2:09:57] that manna that has sustained us all
[2:09:59] these years
[2:10:01] god it's
[2:10:04] when this world has gone crazy or when
[2:10:06] our maybe even its
[2:10:08] hustle and bustle in our own homes and
[2:10:10] our families and turmoil and fights and
[2:10:13] disputes
[2:10:14] maybe it's even in our churches lord
[2:10:17] wherever that would be
[2:10:18] we say i know where there's a place i
[2:10:20] can go and we go in behind that place
[2:10:23] and
[2:10:24] god how that it's refreshing
[2:10:26] and it's renewing
[2:10:28] god we come back out we say oh i'm so
[2:10:32] thankful that god takes care of me
[2:10:37] but
[2:10:40] lord to be a christian is to live for
[2:10:43] others
[2:10:46] lord at this point we're not we're not
[2:10:48] coming for ourselves
[2:10:51] but lord we would as it were
[2:10:53] we want to be holding the hand
[2:10:55] of a
[2:10:56] fellow laborer a fellow sojourner
[2:11:00] somebody lord who's not yet gone in
[2:11:03] behind that place lord we'd like to
[2:11:05] bring them before you we'd like to hold
[2:11:08] them before you lord we would ask that
[2:11:11] god let them
[2:11:13] experience that place
[2:11:15] lord
[2:11:17] just let them come into your presence
[2:11:19] one time as philip told nathaniel
[2:11:23] come and see a man that
[2:11:25] that
[2:11:26] is the messiah we found him we found the
[2:11:29] truth and
[2:11:31] when nathaniel was skeptical and maybe
[2:11:34] he was a scoffer at that time
[2:11:38] and he
[2:11:39] he just
[2:11:40] couldn't understand how that could even
[2:11:42] be possible
[2:11:44] lord philip said just come and see for
[2:11:47] yourself lord this is our desire
[2:11:50] is that
[2:11:52] that these others lord that our children
[2:11:56] that are friends that are family members
[2:11:59] that perhaps a a backslidden soul or
[2:12:02] lord
[2:12:03] an unbelieving family member or friend
[2:12:06] of ours a co-worker lord
[2:12:08] we would just want them to come and see
[2:12:10] you
[2:12:12] lord just to meet you and once in your
[2:12:15] presence we know if they could ever get
[2:12:18] into your presence
[2:12:20] lord if they could ever hear the word of
[2:12:22] life
[2:12:23] it'll change their heart like it did
[2:12:25] ours
[2:12:26] god
[2:12:28] we're just asking
[2:12:30] that lord
[2:12:32] as many now are thinking about somebody
[2:12:35] else
[2:12:36] they're calling their name and they're
[2:12:38] asking that god you would go and visit
[2:12:40] them that you would tug at their heart
[2:12:43] that lord if they've got a secret life
[2:12:45] that they're trying to hide that they're
[2:12:47] ashamed of a life that that they know
[2:12:50] isn't right but they just can't get away
[2:12:53] from it that that secret life seems to
[2:12:55] be taking over and becoming
[2:12:58] even the bigger part of their life
[2:13:01] oh god
[2:13:02] don't let the devil take them and
[2:13:05] and and take them to a place so low that
[2:13:08] they can't hear your word anymore lord
[2:13:11] we would ask for your mercy and for your
[2:13:13] grace to be extended to them that lord
[2:13:16] you would take them into your presence
[2:13:18] that lord they would begin to eat on
[2:13:21] that man that they would see that
[2:13:23] resurrection life that that can cause
[2:13:26] buds and blossoms and fruit to be born
[2:13:30] that lord the word of god that that
[2:13:33] wouldn't be just a
[2:13:35] a tablet of rules but lord it would be a
[2:13:38] life written upon our hearts that god
[2:13:41] you could write upon their heart
[2:13:43] your word and that that that word would
[2:13:46] uphold them it would be a strength
[2:13:49] it would it would be it would be a
[2:13:50] foundation for them to build upon
[2:13:54] lord for we know that it's the only
[2:13:57] foundation the word of god is the only
[2:13:59] foundation
[2:14:01] that has stood the test of time
[2:14:04] we know that it's the only foundation
[2:14:07] that when heavens and earth will pass
[2:14:08] away we know your word won't pass away
[2:14:13] god let them be built upon that
[2:14:15] foundation
[2:14:17] then lord we pray that your holy spirit
[2:14:19] would have liberty
[2:14:21] to add there and to
[2:14:24] build little upon little word upon word
[2:14:26] line upon line precept upon precept
[2:14:30] hear a little there a little
[2:14:32] oh god may they experience that
[2:14:35] pentecostal experience where you feel
[2:14:38] them so full that the world says what
[2:14:41] has happened here
[2:14:43] they could say oh no this is what was
[2:14:46] this is what joel was speaking of
[2:14:49] this is what peter was speaking of i've
[2:14:52] received the full baptism of the holy
[2:14:54] ghost
[2:14:56] grant that lord
[2:14:58] we want to bring these different ones
[2:15:00] before you
[2:15:03] god even those that we've had
[2:15:04] disagreements with those that we haven't
[2:15:06] seen eye to eye
[2:15:08] lord we want to come together with them
[2:15:10] and say let us go in the presence of god
[2:15:14] for we know that in your presence oh god
[2:15:17] there's joy everlasting
[2:15:19] there's peace
[2:15:21] there's real justice lord

[2:15:26] good

[2:15:30] you we love your word above all else we
[2:15:33] love you and we love your word
[2:15:36] we just ask
[2:15:38] that god this secret life would not
[2:15:40] just be a secret life with one but lord
[2:15:44] for it to as many as the lord our god
[2:15:46] shall call may they know this secret
[2:15:49] life with you
[2:15:50] granted heavenly father for we ask it in
[2:15:53] jesus christ's name

[2:18:50] [Music]
[2:19:03] all day long i struggled
[2:19:08] for the answers that i need
[2:19:14] then i come into his presence
[2:19:21] all my questions
[2:19:27] and for a sacred
[2:19:32] moment no doubt can interfere
[2:19:40] in
[2:19:42] the presence

[2:21:28] [Music]
[2:21:30] answer those questions satisfy that
[2:21:32] desire
[2:21:34] oh my
[2:21:38] a god
[2:21:40] of peace
[2:21:57] [Music]
[2:22:08] he said come unto me all ye they're
[2:22:10] heavy laden
[2:22:12] and i will give you rest
[2:22:14] sometimes we look for the rest in this
[2:22:16] physical body
[2:22:18] but there's a greater rest than that
[2:22:20] there's a peace a satisfying portion
[2:22:24] that god gives even when the body seems
[2:22:26] to be falling apart and everything to be
[2:22:29] there's something that holds you at
[2:22:31] peace holds you at rest there's an
[2:22:33] anchor that holds
[2:22:34] in the midst of all the storms of today
[2:22:37] just thinking about that
[2:22:40] with work situations home situations
[2:22:43] even church situations
[2:22:45] things sometimes but he is that answer
[2:22:48] he is at peace
[2:22:49] somebody can come up to you and say what
[2:22:52] is that about you there is something
[2:22:54] about you
[2:22:55] i'd like to have that
[2:22:57] i know that fountain
[2:23:00] that that cistern inside of you that's
[2:23:02] just that the bubbling fountain that's
[2:23:03] coming out and giving
[2:23:05] and because
[2:23:07] you've entered into that place
[2:23:10] you've made it up
[2:23:12] if i could say it this way just a daily
[2:23:14] part of life
[2:23:16] something that you you long for you
[2:23:18] desire for
[2:23:19] and i know there are times that you'll
[2:23:21] get home you're tired you're weary
[2:23:22] you've had a tough day and
[2:23:24] the bed just seems like it'd be the best
[2:23:26] thing to just plop on and lay down and
[2:23:28] turn everything off
[2:23:30] and you wake up in the morning you say
[2:23:32] you know i still got that anxiousness i
[2:23:34] still got that trouble i rested all
[2:23:35] night and a bit but if i would entered
[2:23:37] into his presence
[2:23:39] there would have been a setting for you
[2:23:41] [Music]
[2:23:42] but i'll tell you this now
[2:23:44] because you have entered into the
[2:23:46] presence there's going to be a meeting
[2:23:49] in the air
[2:23:50] in the sweet sweet point
[2:23:52] something in your heart is saying yes
[2:23:55] amen
[2:23:56] i said boy that's a change of temple but
[2:23:58] something tells me because i've been
[2:24:00] there and he promised it like her and
[2:24:03] she waited every day and he came and
[2:24:05] said because
[2:24:07] he says there's going to be a meeting in
[2:24:09] here
[2:24:11] there is going to
[2:24:18] [Music]
[2:24:25] to greet you over
[2:24:28] [Music]
[2:24:44] and god's own son
[2:24:47] will be
[2:24:56] there's going to be
[2:25:00] [Music]
[2:25:10] i'll greet you over there in that home
[2:25:15] [Music]
[2:25:24] gloriously
[2:25:28] [Music]
[2:25:38] [Applause]
[2:25:41] you'd say well how could you sing a song
[2:25:42] like that because something inside me
[2:25:44] tells me yes
[2:25:46] something inside me tell me that day is
[2:25:48] coming
[2:25:49] it's worth all if i could put it this
[2:25:51] way the sacrifices in this life
[2:25:54] to not to drive the fleet of cadillacs
[2:25:56] and i you know that won't mean nothing
[2:25:58] that won't be nothing but the joy
[2:26:00] that's on the other side
[2:26:03] we've heard this story many times with
[2:26:05] brother branham but this is i think one
[2:26:06] of the most detailed
[2:26:09] little details about
[2:26:10] say and and i just reminded brother lyle
[2:26:13] brother peter
[2:26:15] when we sat with that man in the room
[2:26:17] back here
[2:26:18] and said god had told him showed him the
[2:26:21] year he's coming not the day but the
[2:26:22] year
[2:26:24] and he shared it with such a passion
[2:26:25] didn't he
[2:26:26] i think you could have sat in the church
[2:26:27] you could have heard the meeting
[2:26:29] because it was quite loud it was a
[2:26:30] passion in here
[2:26:32] but there was somebody that didn't click
[2:26:35] just to hold the passion about he's come
