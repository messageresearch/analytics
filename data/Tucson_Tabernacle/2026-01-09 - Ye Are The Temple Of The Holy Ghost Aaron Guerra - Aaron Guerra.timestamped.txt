[12:57] tonight?
[13:00] &gt;&gt; I got to I got to say I I missed you
[13:03] guys. I was gone for two Sundays and it
[13:05] felt like wrong. I was going to another
[13:06] church. I was like, "What's wrong?" And
[13:08] what was wrong is I wasn't in my church.
[13:10] You know, it's good to visit places, but
[13:12] there's nothing like home.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're going to Sister Hope,
[13:16] you want to make way for your special.
[13:18] We're going to sing leaning one more
[13:20] time. I'm leaning.

[13:31] I'm leaning.
[13:34] I'm leaning

[14:04] There's a lighthouse
[14:11] that over
[14:13] looks like
[14:17] when I'm
[14:20] send out a light that I
[14:25] might clearly see.
[14:29] And the light that shines in darkness
[14:34] now will lead a safe
[14:39] world.
[14:41] If it wasn't for the lighthouse,
[14:47] my ship would sail no more.
[14:52] Oh, I thank God. Sing it with me for the
[14:57] lighthouse.
[14:59] Oh, I owe my life to him.
[15:06] King Jesus
[15:08] is the lighthouse.
[15:12] And from the rocks of sin,
[15:17] he has shown his light around me
[15:24] that I might clearly see.
[15:30] If it wasn't for the lighthouse,
[15:36] tell me where would this be?
[15:53] Tear that
[15:55] house down.
[15:58] The big ships, they don't sail the sway
[16:03] anymore. There's no use
[16:06] in it.
[16:09] But then my mind goes back to that
[16:15] stormy night when just in time I saw
[16:21] that light. The light from that old
[16:26] lighthouse
[16:29] that stands there on the hill. Oh, I
[16:34] thank God
[16:37] for the lighthouse.
[16:41] I owe my life to him.
[16:47] Jesus
[16:49] is the lighthouse.
[16:53] And from the rocks of sin,
[16:57] he has shown his light around me
[17:05] that I might clearly see.
[17:10] If it wasn't for the lighthouse,
[17:16] tell me where we should be. Oh, I thank
[17:22] God
[17:24] for the lighthouse.
[17:28] I owe my life to him.
[17:34] King Jesus
[17:36] is the lighthouse.
[17:39] And from the rocks of sin,
[17:44] he has shown his light around me
[17:51] that I might clearly see.
[17:56] If it wasn't for the lighthouse,
[18:03] tell me where
[18:05] this should be.
[18:19] Amen. Can we stand this evening? We're
[18:21] going to sing Amazing Grace.
[18:26] Amazing
[18:29] grace,
[18:31] how sweet
[18:34] the sound
[18:37] that saved
[18:39] the rich
[18:42] like me.
[18:47] I once
[18:49] was lost
[18:52] but now
[18:55] I'm found.
[18:57] Was blind
[18:59] but now
[19:02] I see.
[19:06] This was grace
[19:09] that taught
[19:12] my heart
[19:14] to fear.
[19:17] and grace
[19:19] my fears
[19:22] relieve.
[19:26] And how preious
[19:30] did
[19:31] that grace
[19:34] appear
[19:36] the hour
[19:39] I first
[19:41] believe.
[19:45] And through many
[19:49] danger
[19:51] force
[19:53] and snares
[19:55] I have
[19:58] already
[20:00] come.
[20:04] It is grace
[20:07] that brought
[20:09] me safe.
[20:11] Love is far.
[20:14] And grace
[20:16] will bring me home.
[20:23] And when we've
[20:26] been there
[20:28] 10,000
[20:31] years,
[20:33] bright shining
[20:36] as
[20:38] the sun
[20:42] and we've known
[20:45] less days
[20:47] to sing
[20:49] God's praise.
[20:52] And when
[20:54] we first
[20:57] be gone,
[21:00] it's amazing
[21:03] grace
[21:05] how sweet
[21:07] the sound
[21:09] that saved
[21:12] a wretch
[21:14] like me.
[21:18] And I once
[21:21] was lost,
[21:23] but now
[21:26] I'm found.
[21:28] Was blind,
[21:30] but now
[21:33] I see
[21:38] &gt;&gt; that song.
[21:41] It's really ageless. It never gets old.
[21:43] You can be seated for a few minutes
[21:44] while I make some announcements.
[21:49] first um
[21:52] sent a text out. I'm a grandpa.
[21:58] I worked hard at it and and I finally
[22:01] achieved it. Can you uh put up a
[22:04] picture? There's my sweetheart and the
[22:06] new one right there. She's going to get
[22:08] mad at me. Oh, no. Go back.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; I took that.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Meline's gonna Matteline's gonna be mad
[22:14] at me because her hair's messed up.
[22:16] Let's look at it for just a minute.
[22:19] And the next one. So my wife was there,
[22:22] but that's when he found out that his
[22:24] grandpa wasn't there.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; It was really bad.
[22:29] Daniel took that picture and then is
[22:32] there's one more.
[22:34] No. Okay. Um, it feels good, friends. It
[22:38] feels good that we have a family that we
[22:40] can celebrate these things with. I know
[22:42] Josiah and Katie were they were just
[22:45] overwhelmed at at the support and love.
[22:48] And that's the prettiest grandma I've
[22:49] ever seen right there.
[22:55] I don't know if she's going to love that
[22:57] baby more or me more. I don't know how.
[22:59] I'm going try to keep her here, but
[23:00] we'll see. Um, we do we got a good thing
[23:04] going. just so sweet the love that we
[23:08] have for each other and the support the
[23:10] support in the good times
[23:12] and then also really the support in the
[23:15] hard times. Uh this is this past week
[23:19] has been rough really a hard hard week
[23:24] and it's been um mostly with young
[23:27] people and the things that have
[23:29] happened. Um first uh sister Teresa
[23:33] Sutello
[23:35] was a car accident yesterday
[23:37] and uh she um went to the hospital and
[23:42] uh it was cute. She was fine and she's
[23:44] bruised up, but I got over there and
[23:47] they had her sitting in the hallway and
[23:50] she says, "Oh, brother."
[23:52] She says, "The man that I got in a wreck
[23:55] with," she said, "They wheeled him up
[23:57] and set him right next to me."
[24:00] And she said, "I was looking at him and
[24:03] I didn't know what to say." And she told
[24:06] me what happened in the accident. She
[24:08] says, "Brother," she says, "s
[24:10] the car t-boned me. It uh hit me on the
[24:14] on the passenger side." And she said,
[24:17] "When the car hit me," she said, "I
[24:19] thought, well, Lord,
[24:22] this is the way that you chose to take
[24:24] me. I I can see these white clouds."
[24:27] And then she says, "No, those are
[24:29] airbags.
[24:36] She's she's a sweet." If you haven't met
[24:38] Sister Teresa, she is a wonderful lady.
[24:41] She she's one of the she sits right up
[24:43] here in the front with her family. She
[24:45] is just uh a lot of fun and just a
[24:48] really really sweet lady. I mean, she's
[24:50] the reason that we have all of these
[24:52] people that usually sit in this front
[24:54] row right here is Sister Teresa. She's
[24:56] the matriarch of the family and I know
[24:58] they all really um they all really
[25:01] respect her. Um update I sent it out
[25:06] earlier from the family. Uh they uh
[25:09] everything has improved.
[25:12] The three kids have all improved. The uh
[25:18] um three-year-old is out of uh the
[25:22] critical care area andh He's he's doing
[25:26] a lot better. He was able to eat some
[25:28] food. And then um the uh the the little
[25:32] one and um he's two and then there's an
[25:37] eight-year-old. All of them had the um
[25:40] innovation tubes removed. The other two
[25:42] are still critical, but they're
[25:44] improving quickly. And even the mother
[25:47] is improving and she's um responding to
[25:51] uh stimuli. And uh even brother Juan was
[25:54] talking I was talking to brother Juan a
[25:56] few hours ago. This is so it's it's Juan
[25:59] and Lima and uh they they sit over here
[26:02] on the side. Um it's their daughter
[26:08] was the mother and then their
[26:09] grandchildren and Juan and Lima have
[26:12] been looking over for the grandchildren
[26:14] for the past six months.
[26:16] Brother Juan was telling me that um he
[26:20] said that she's doing a lot better and
[26:22] and she's responding. She's squeezing
[26:25] her hand and answering questions. And
[26:28] from from what it sounds like um from
[26:33] Kano, from your mom, it uh and from also
[26:37] from brother Juan that she's um she's
[26:41] really receptive to the Lord. And that's
[26:43] what the conversation obviously has been
[26:45] about. And it's just things are just
[26:48] looking
[26:50] all the way across much much better. So
[26:53] I know they would and they have um asked
[26:56] me to thank everyone for their prayers,
[27:00] the times that you spent before the Lord
[27:01] on their behalf. It's um this is we
[27:05] don't know why God allows things,
[27:09] but I know the one thing I do know is
[27:11] the most important thing to God Almighty
[27:15] is his children. Just as the most
[27:18] important thing to us parents is our
[27:20] children.
[27:21] And he knows
[27:24] the end the end of this this whole
[27:28] thing. And he knows that the trials that
[27:32] we go through now
[27:34] that they are moving towards an ultimate
[27:37] objective. And that objective, that
[27:40] ultimate objective is eternal life with
[27:43] God the Father and with his children.
[27:47] And whatever it takes to get through
[27:49] this life is worth it. Whatever it takes
[27:53] to get us straight with God, it's worth
[27:56] every moment of it.
[27:59] And then uh also I talk with Sister
[28:01] Esther Alcanter every couple days and uh
[28:05] she's just she's just down and you can
[28:07] imagine
[28:09] She lost her son 31 years old and uh
[28:14] unexpected
[28:16] and we know and sister Esther has given
[28:19] me just a tremendous testimony that we
[28:24] know this is God's will without any any
[28:27] doubt we know that this was his will but
[28:30] it's still hard even though you know
[28:33] you're walking in the footsteps of the
[28:36] Lord Jesus
[28:38] You know, it's
[28:40] it's hard
[28:42] sometimes. Those those footsteps
[28:46] are hard to take, but we have to look
[28:49] towards the end. And the end
[28:52] is eternal life, eternal joy and
[28:56] happiness with our children, with our
[28:58] families,
[29:00] and most of all with our Savior and our
[29:02] Lord.
[29:05] So, um,
[29:07] that's I didn't get Are there any prayer
[29:10] requests back there? I didn't get any
[29:12] other prayer requests. Um, Cleo Hano,
[29:15] could you come up and pray over these?
[29:18] Now, these are these are Hano's cousins
[29:21] that um that I'm talking about with the
[29:23] Elha family.
[29:25] And uh I know that this guy right here
[29:28] has been a real blessing to them and
[29:31] especially his mom and dad.
[29:34] They've just
[29:36] they've just put this stuff on put this
[29:39] situation in on their shoulders
[29:42] and they have been just an anchor and a
[29:46] help to this family. So buddy,
[29:56] &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus for this night and
[29:58] allowing us to get together here today.
[30:01] And I thank you for
[30:04] what you're doing with my family and uh
[30:06] helping us to see some improvements.
[30:10] And I just ask that your will be done,
[30:12] Lord.
[30:14] And you help those babies and uh help my
[30:16] cousin, help them to recuperate
[30:20] and help them to recover and help them
[30:23] not to not to suffer too much. Lord,
[30:26] we thank you for everything that you do
[30:28] and we ask you to help us to have a good
[30:30] night and to keep all of us safe. Jesus
[30:34] name we pray. Amen.
[30:46] That scripture just keeps coming to
[30:48] mind. I believe it's uh it's 1
[30:51] Corinthians
[30:52] chapter 12.
[30:55] 26 right around in there. It says when
[31:00] one member
[31:02] of the body suffers,
[31:05] the entire body suffers. And we can
[31:08] think of it just as as our own body that
[31:12] if we get our finger smashed or if we
[31:17] get a cut or if something just something
[31:21] hurts really bad, our whole body
[31:23] suffers. Our whole body is thinking
[31:25] about this one this one member that is
[31:28] suffering.
[31:30] And I just my heart goes out to these
[31:35] families. Sister Esther, I just I I I
[31:38] think about her all the time and and I'm
[31:42] sure that she's there and she's with her
[31:44] thoughts.
[31:46] Don't forget, friends, suffer with each
[31:49] other. Suffer with Sister Esther. She
[31:53] needs it. Suffer with with the OA
[31:55] family. They they they it helps them.
[31:59] And then rejoice. We rejoice when we see
[32:02] healings. We rejoice when we see a
[32:04] birth. We rejoice when when these joyful
[32:07] things happen.
[32:09] Be together in this. God bless you.
[32:13] Daniel, you can be seated
[32:19] in Christ alone.
[32:23] Hope is found.
[32:26] He is my light, my strength,
[32:30] my
[32:32] cornerstone.
[32:35] This solid ground
[32:38] firm to the faces drone.
[32:43] What heights of love?
[32:46] What depths of peace?
[32:49] When fears are stilled, when striving
[32:53] sees
[32:55] my comfort,
[32:57] my all in all
[33:01] here in the love of Christ
[33:04] I care
[33:06] in Christ alone
[33:08] who took from flesh.
[33:12] fullness of God in helpless
[33:15] day.
[33:17] gift of love and righteousness.
[33:22] Scorned by the ones he came to save.
[33:27] Till on that cross
[33:30] as Jesus died.
[33:33] The wrath of God was satisfied
[33:39] for every sin
[33:41] on him was laid.
[33:44] Here in the death of Christ
[33:48] live there in the ground his body laid.
[33:55] Light of the world by darkness
[33:59] lay. then proceeding forth in glorious
[34:04] day.
[34:06] But for me, he rose again.
[34:11] And as he stands
[34:14] in victory
[34:16] since curse has lost his grip on me. For
[34:22] I am his and he is mine.
[34:27] far with the precious blood of Christ.
[34:31] Let's stand for this next verse.
[34:34] No guilt in life.
[34:37] No fear in death.
[34:40] This is the power of Christ in me.
[34:45] From life's first cry to final breath.
[34:51] Jesus commands my destiny.
[34:56] No power of hell, no scheme of man can
[35:02] ever pluck me from his hand till he
[35:08] returns
[35:10] or calls me home
[35:13] here in the power of Christ.
[35:16] Let's sing that one more time. No guilt
[35:19] in life, no fear in death.
[35:24] This is the power of Christ in me.
[35:29] From life's first Christ to final bread.
[35:34] Jesus commands my destiny.
[35:39] No power of hell, no scheme of man can
[35:45] ever pluck me from his hand till he
[35:51] returns
[35:52] or calls me home
[35:55] here in the power of Christ
[36:01] till he returns
[36:04] or calls me home
[36:07] here in the power of Christ
[36:11] all stand.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:16] Either way, we don't lose.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; He's already one. He's already paid for
[36:22] it. He's covered it all.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; And because of that, you and I are
[36:26] welcome. You and I have drawn into that.
[36:29] Amen. You say, "Well, I'm not good
[36:31] enough." None of us are. And that's why
[36:35] he took our place. He said, "I would."
[36:37] So let's just bow our heads Lord
[36:42] in any direction we look and
[36:46] our thoughts and all Lord and it's just
[36:50] your amazing grace.
[36:52] It's your love for us Lord.
[36:56] You never said we had to earn your love.
[36:58] You just loved us.
[37:00] You looked beyond our faults and you saw
[37:02] our needs, Lord. And you said, "I'll
[37:04] take their place."
[37:06] Even as you were on the cross, you cried
[37:08] out, "Father, forgive them. They don't
[37:10] know what they're doing."
[37:13] Lord, it's just wonderful to know that
[37:15] you care for us that way, Lord. Lord, we
[37:18] take your word today and your word is
[37:20] alive.
[37:22] It's not a history book, Lord. It's it's
[37:25] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[37:27] and forever. so
[37:30] &gt;&gt; just commit it all to you now in the
[37:32] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. You
[37:36] may be seated. Thank you.
[37:41] Appreciate the Lord being so good to us
[37:43] when when we're undeserving.
[37:47] If we were good enough and we were
[37:49] deserving, then he wouldn't have had to
[37:51] die for us.
[37:53] But he saw that we couldn't do it on our
[37:55] own. show.
[37:57] Brother Dan's going to find out that his
[38:00] grandson is eventually going to want to
[38:02] do everything on his own and grandpa's
[38:05] one who want to be helping him through
[38:06] the whole thing.
[38:09] And but they have that's how we learn.
[38:12] We learn by our experiences. And I
[38:15] watched a video one time of a little
[38:18] probably three-year-old trying to put a
[38:19] jacket on. And mom and dad were videoing
[38:22] it and one of the sleeves were turned
[38:25] inside out, but he couldn't figure it
[38:27] out. And he was trying to put it on. He
[38:30] was spinning around and spinning around
[38:32] and he got angry. He was kicking the
[38:34] walls. He was stomping his foot, but he
[38:37] wouldn't ask dad for help.
[38:40] And sometimes we get the same way.
[38:43] We get frustrated, we get upset and
[38:44] everything when we could just turn and
[38:46] say, "Lord, I surrender."
[38:48] Uh, you know, can you help me? So, he
[38:51] said he would. So,
[38:53] I thought today as as brother Lyall had
[38:56] been ministering and even going way back
[38:59] when we were going through each book of
[39:00] the Bible, especially, the Old Testament
[39:03] and um the temple. See, God had always
[39:08] desired to fellowship with his children.
[39:10] There there was not he wasn't a god way
[39:12] up there just governing. He walked right
[39:14] amongst us, right amongst his children
[39:17] there in in the Garden of Eden.
[39:20] He would come down in the cool of the
[39:22] evening to have fellowship with Adam and
[39:25] Eve.
[39:27] Yet he knew what was going to take
[39:29] place. It didn't surprise him.
[39:32] But he came every day. He came every day
[39:35] to fellowship with him. We don't know
[39:38] how much time was there. And but the day
[39:42] came when he came down for a different
[39:44] reason.
[39:46] It was to restore or make a way back to
[39:50] fellowship.
[39:52] And
[39:54] they they hid they they tried to to to
[39:58] it maybe the first time they tried to
[40:00] hide from him because they realized that
[40:03] they had done wrong.
[40:05] But he's calling out to them. And he
[40:07] says, "Where art thou? Where Adam? Adam,
[40:09] where art thou?" He knew where they
[40:10] were, but he's calling. He's trying to
[40:12] get a response. And I think sometimes
[40:14] the Lord does that with us just to get a
[40:17] response back from son, daughter. And we
[40:20] say, "Yes, Lord." And then you say,
[40:23] "Then he'll come have fellowship with
[40:25] us."
[40:26] And since that day, he has been working
[40:29] on restoring what was in the Garden of
[40:32] Eden.
[40:34] And there is a promise written in the
[40:35] scriptures that one of these days and
[40:37] it's closer now than it's ever been
[40:40] before
[40:41] that that we'll be going back to that
[40:45] and that's something but in that process
[40:47] and then that time we have a life to
[40:50] live we have things to do and our
[40:53] greatest the greatest thing we should do
[40:55] is being Christians and being an example
[40:58] and a light to someone else.
[41:01] Christianity is not for you alone.
[41:06] Christianity is to give Jesus Christ to
[41:09] others.
[41:10] So, and that was his desire, the
[41:13] fellowship. He did not desire to for
[41:16] destruction or anything. But if you
[41:19] disobey
[41:20] it does come with a payment back. If
[41:24] you're a parent, you know that how that
[41:27] is. And if you're a son or a daughter,
[41:29] you knew you also went through it too.
[41:32] You know, there were things that I told
[41:34] you not to do that. I remember one time
[41:37] my dad telling us that you were not
[41:39] supposed to do that. And he asked, "How
[41:42] many times do you think you should be
[41:45] given a spank for that, a spanking?" And
[41:48] me and my brother both said, "One."
[41:51] And dad said, "No, I think at least 10
[41:53] or more." And we didn't agree with that
[41:55] one at all.
[41:57] So my mom came in and there's always
[41:59] somebody that has a little bit of grace
[42:00] and mom comes in. Spank him and let them
[42:02] go please.
[42:04] But you know when he comes and he calls
[42:07] and he reaches down and he gets your
[42:08] attention and he talks to you and maybe
[42:10] he tugs on your ear or does this to
[42:13] there's a reason for it and a place for
[42:15] it and the lesson learned is to go on
[42:18] and grow with. So we know that when he
[42:21] would come and visit with Adam and Eve,
[42:25] the fellowship that they had and and the
[42:27] time that they spent,
[42:30] it was it was he looked forward to it.
[42:32] He desired to do it and they would look
[42:35] forward to it, you know. But there was a
[42:37] fall in the in the garden.
[42:40] There was a time when when they
[42:43] disobeyed
[42:45] God's word and God what God told them to
[42:47] do and what not to do. Yet God was aware
[42:50] of it. There was no surprise. There was
[42:52] not emergency action that had to be
[42:54] taken. God had already made a way. There
[42:57] was a lamb prepared for a sacrifice.
[43:01] And so since that day when he put them
[43:05] out
[43:06] of the garden, been looking forward to
[43:09] that return
[43:11] to all of us be back in that same place.
[43:14] So
[43:16] if I would title this,
[43:19] it's ye are the temple of the Holy
[43:21] Ghost.
[43:23] That's where he wants to inhabit
[43:25] himself. Not up on a mountain, not in a
[43:28] specific church, but in individuals.
[43:31] That's that way. He's with you all the
[43:33] time. Wherever you go, wherever you are,
[43:37] he's with you. And it's Christ in you,
[43:40] the hope of glory.
[43:42] So
[43:44] David says in Psalms 27:es
[43:47] 1-5,
[43:50] I believe they got the scriptures there.
[43:53] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[43:56] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[43:59] strength of of my life. Of whom shall I
[44:03] be afraid?
[44:04] And he says, when the wicked, even mine
[44:06] enemies and my foes came upon me to eat
[44:09] up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
[44:13] Though host should encamp against me, my
[44:16] heart shall not fear. Though war should
[44:19] rise against me, in this will I be
[44:22] confident. One thing have I desired of
[44:25] the Lord, and that will I seek after,
[44:27] that I may dwell in the house of the
[44:29] Lord all the days of my life, to behold
[44:32] the beauty of the Lord, and to choir in
[44:33] his temple. For in the time of trouble
[44:36] he shall hide me in his pavilion, in the
[44:38] secret of his tabernacle shall he hide
[44:41] me. He shall set me up upon a rock.
[44:45] That's God's word. And David may have
[44:48] been quoting, saying it, praying it, but
[44:51] that's God's word.
[44:53] is what we see. In the time of trouble,
[44:56] he shall hide me in his pavilion. He
[44:59] shall take me under his wings.
[45:02] And and the thought as brother Law had
[45:05] been ministering especially recently
[45:08] u uh concerning the tabernacle and and
[45:11] and how it was built and and how it was
[45:13] done. It just brought the thought to me,
[45:17] we are the tabernacle of the Holy Ghost
[45:19] today.
[45:21] Tucson Tabernacle, a literal building
[45:23] that we come in and God will meet us
[45:26] here. But this is his desire. You're his
[45:29] desire. You say, "Well, I'm not good
[45:31] enough. I went through here and I found
[45:34] where he took care of that part, too."
[45:37] He said, "I made you. I took your place
[45:41] so that you could." And
[45:44] brother Brandham says in the message
[45:46] here ye him.
[45:48] But now notice in my father's house he
[45:51] was strictly with the Bible. Back in the
[45:53] Old Testament when a father owned a big
[45:56] kingdom and a child was born into that
[45:58] kingdom. He was a son as soon as he was
[46:01] born. And now you know it's a son
[46:04] because he's been born. And I know going
[46:07] through your head all the things you're
[46:09] planning to do. and and it's just
[46:12] natural, you know. I I have my my
[46:16] grandson Asher and I've been giving him
[46:19] my tools as I've retired and doing like
[46:21] that and every time he comes over,
[46:24] what's next? What do I get now? You
[46:27] know, and it's not Yeah, I can see where
[46:29] he's But at the same time, if it's
[46:31] available, why not take it? Why not
[46:34] accept it? He said
[46:37] he was a son as soon as he was born. But
[46:39] yet that son, he would be heir of all
[46:42] the father had if his character was
[46:45] right. But first his character had to be
[46:47] proved.
[46:49] Now you ministers know where I'm going
[46:50] to. It's a placing of a son. Now, but
[46:53] his character didn't show up right. He
[46:56] didn't inherit anything. He was just a
[46:58] son. So then the father in order to get
[47:00] his great son of of whom he loved he had
[47:04] business to be doing. So he got a tutor
[47:07] a trainer over his children and he
[47:10] sought through the places till he found
[47:12] the best man he could find because his
[47:14] his son's education and the future of
[47:16] his son depended on what kind of a
[47:18] training that child got. And that's the
[47:21] way it is today in the kingdom of God.
[47:24] That's when we're born in the kingdom of
[47:26] God. God sought out the best tutor he
[47:29] could find for the church and that was
[47:31] the Holy Spirit. the best you know in
[47:36] our in my best trying to with my
[47:40] daughters with my grandchildren all I
[47:42] don't always get it right but he never
[47:45] fails and in the message why are people
[47:48] so tossed about the Christian faith
[47:51] faith is based solidly upon rest that's
[47:55] right a Christian is not tossed about a
[47:57] Christian doesn't run from place to
[47:59] place a Christian doesn't fuss and fume
[48:02] and worry about things. A Christian
[48:04] rest. It's all over. It was all finished
[48:07] by for the believer at Calvary.
[48:12] And sometimes we have a hard time with
[48:14] that.
[48:16] Um when a gift is given to you and it's
[48:20] a gift,
[48:22] we automatically feel we owe something
[48:24] back. We need to return a favor with a
[48:27] favor. We need to give a gift back for a
[48:29] gift. But a gift is a gift.
[48:32] And it's sometimes hard to accept it. My
[48:35] first thoughts is, okay, how how do I
[48:38] how do I cover that up? If it's a gift,
[48:41] it's a gift. The blessing of the giver
[48:43] is when you receive it and and you
[48:46] appreciate it. Then that giver gets a
[48:48] blessing. This is my beloved son. Hear
[48:51] ye him. He's done what the father has
[48:54] asked. So
[48:57] looking at the temple and it was a type
[49:01] of what God had wanted to restore and
[49:05] and as I thought some about it and some
[49:08] of the things that brother Eli had
[49:10] ministered but we know that that
[49:13] there was that one day when the high
[49:16] priest went into the holy of holies and
[49:20] that was once a year
[49:23] a and they were waiting and they were
[49:25] listening I mean, as the high priest
[49:26] walked in, it it was it would had to be
[49:28] dressed a certain way. Everything had to
[49:30] be exactly the way it had been taught
[49:34] through Moses and all. And it would to
[49:37] be accepted. They would hear the bells
[49:38] ringing. And when that sacrifice was
[49:41] made and they heard him come back out,
[49:43] they knew the sacrifice had been
[49:45] accepted
[49:47] and they were good for one more year.
[49:50] Now, there was daily sacrifices that you
[49:52] could bring every day, but this one was
[49:54] for the whole congregation,
[49:57] but after a while, it just became a
[49:59] practice. It just became something that,
[50:02] okay, he's going in and then good, we're
[50:05] good for another year. And then they
[50:06] went back to what they were doing.
[50:10] And and you know, and after you reading
[50:12] through the the Old Testament, they were
[50:14] constantly being scolded. They were
[50:16] constantly having to deal with things.
[50:17] Sometimes even fire fell and took their
[50:19] lives
[50:21] because it no it it had lost its
[50:23] meaning. It had lost its its you and it
[50:26] was just a ritual.
[50:28] Just a ritual and and maybe maybe some
[50:31] of us sometimes do that. Well, it's I
[50:33] got up. I guess I need to pray and read
[50:35] my Bible. It's something I do every day.
[50:39] Where's the desire for that?
[50:42] you know, maybe saying, you know, uh
[50:45] it's and I did it. I'm not saying, man,
[50:48] I'm on my truck driving to work said,
[50:50] "Man, I didn't even pray and read my
[50:52] Bible this morning, Lord." You know, and
[50:55] the Lord says, "I know. I saw that. I'm
[50:57] still with you. I haven't left you." But
[51:00] the fellowship there and you know so
[51:03] looking at that how it had fallen how it
[51:06] had had lost its it its its uh what it
[51:10] should have been the daily talk with God
[51:13] the daily walk with God and and Moses
[51:16] went up and he says I want to see your
[51:18] face I want to see you and God said come
[51:21] on up into the mountain you can't see my
[51:23] face but he let him see him back Samuel
[51:26] had told them he says you know you want
[51:28] to be like the other countries But you
[51:30] know, you want to have a an army, you
[51:32] want to have this. He said, it's going
[51:33] to cost you your children. It's going to
[51:34] have cost you this. He wants to be your
[51:37] king.
[51:39] But they wanted to be like others. And
[51:41] and that's human. That's us, you know.
[51:44] Um there is
[51:47] if if we're not careful, we judge others
[51:49] by what we see.
[51:52] You know, this brother, this sister,
[51:54] they're just wonderful people. They're
[51:55] good people. I want to be like them.
[51:58] live with them for a little while,
[52:01] you know, a couple weeks or so, or spend
[52:03] some time close with them, and you say,
[52:04] "You know what? They're like me. They
[52:06] have their ups and downs, too. They have
[52:09] their hard times." Peter told Jesus, "I
[52:12] will not deny you. No, no, I'm going
[52:14] to." And he goes, "You're going to deny
[52:15] me three times, Peter."
[52:19] Peter's got to be thinking, "No, no way.
[52:22] Not me."
[52:24] But he did.
[52:26] So we we here is his this is David
[52:29] saying he will hide me in his pavilion.
[52:32] He will set me up upon a rock. He will
[52:36] watch over. He'll keep me in Isaiah
[52:39] 43:es 1-7
[52:42] and I believe they're putting them up.
[52:46] But now thus the the Lord that created
[52:48] thee, oh Jacob, and he that formed thee,
[52:50] O Israel, fear not.
[52:53] He says, for I have redeemed thee. I
[52:55] have called thee by thy name. Thou art
[52:58] mine.
[52:59] When thou passest through the waters, I
[53:01] will be with thee. And through the
[53:03] rivers, they shall not overflow thee.
[53:06] When thou walst through the fire, thou
[53:08] shalt not be burned, neither shall the
[53:10] flame kindle upon thee. For I am the
[53:14] Lord thy God, the holy one of Israel,
[53:16] thy savior. I gave Egypt for thy ransom,
[53:20] Ethiopian sea for thee. Since thou was
[53:24] precious man my sight, thou has been
[53:26] honorable and I have loved thee.
[53:27] Therefore I will give men for thee and
[53:30] and people for thy life. Fear not, I am
[53:33] with thee. I will bring thy seed from
[53:35] the east and gather thee from the west.
[53:38] I will say to the north, give up, and to
[53:40] the south, keep not back. Bring my sons
[53:43] from far and my daughters to from the
[53:45] ends of the earth.
[53:48] e even everyone that is called by my
[53:50] name for I have created him for my glory
[53:54] I have formed him yay I have made him
[53:57] there's only one that can say that
[54:00] honestly and keep in that's the Lord God
[54:02] our God but he said it so it's true
[54:06] because God doesn't make mistakes and
[54:08] have to go fix things he's talking to
[54:11] Israel and and Israel we know because
[54:13] it's written in the scriptures and and
[54:15] and you know we think they failed over
[54:18] and over and over and over. Yet God came
[54:21] back, came back, came back. You know, he
[54:25] he visited I think about when he um took
[54:30] Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden.
[54:33] We don't know the amount of time that
[54:35] they had been in there, but it had been
[54:36] a long time, I believe. And you know,
[54:39] they they had walked and they had they
[54:41] had with the animals had everything the
[54:43] way they wanted it. was, you know,
[54:45] they're what could be perfect, but they
[54:47] fell.
[54:48] And on the outside, I could see that day
[54:51] after he they're put outside and they're
[54:54] waiting for the cool of the evening
[54:57] for God to return because he had come
[54:59] every cool of the evening to have
[55:01] fellowship. And that evening, he didn't
[55:04] come.
[55:06] He wasn't there.
[55:08] And where is he?
[55:11] God wanted to be there. Those were his
[55:13] children, but they had crossed that
[55:16] line. But it also spoke of a redemption
[55:20] that was coming forward. I think about
[55:22] that. Could you imagine getting up and
[55:24] saying, "Where is God? He's never left
[55:27] me. I've never been without him, but
[55:30] where is he today?" I know sometimes we
[55:32] felt that way. Lord, where are you? You
[55:35] know, it's it's also sometimes how
[55:39] you hear or you read in the news or
[55:40] maybe it's happened to you. you lose
[55:42] your child, you're you're someplace and
[55:45] they can't be found. We were at uh at
[55:48] the park one time with our all different
[55:51] parts of the family and one of the boys
[55:52] disappeared. I
[55:55] my sister-in-law's son and we were all
[55:58] over the park and there's a Reed Park
[56:01] thing and he could not be found
[56:03] anywhere. Somehow he was what just three
[56:07] or four years old. I don't know. He
[56:08] wandered off and they were having a car
[56:10] show on the other side and he walked all
[56:12] the way to the car show. How nobody
[56:14] noticed that? But we didn't. We were so
[56:17] busy with everything else.
[56:20] But the feeling and the anxiety and the
[56:25] but where is he? They found him in one
[56:28] of the firemen's or the ambulance of
[56:30] that was there. They had found him and
[56:32] they put him and he was asleep in there.
[56:34] He was doing okay.
[56:37] We were dying.
[56:40] God is doing okay.
[56:43] It's all right. He's He's seeing it over
[56:45] you. My sister-in-law is laughing
[56:47] because we all remember that time. It
[56:49] was frantic. There was a bunch of us
[56:51] there trying to find this little
[56:53] three-year-old boy at Reed Park. But God
[56:56] knows exactly where you're at. He knows
[56:59] to get how to get your attention, you
[57:01] know.
[57:02] So here, Israel has gone through all
[57:04] this over time. Yet they have a promise.
[57:09] They have a God who has called them.
[57:11] They have a God who has drawn them out.
[57:13] Who's done so many things that you would
[57:15] think that how could they how could they
[57:17] fail him? He's he he keeps his word. He
[57:21] gave us a pillar of fire. He gave us a
[57:23] light at night. He gave us shade. You
[57:26] know, he provided mana. He did this,
[57:27] that, and the other.
[57:30] But like like we are sometimes, Lord,
[57:34] you blessed me yesterday. Where are you
[57:35] today?
[57:38] He said, I'll never leave you. I'll
[57:40] never forsake you. You have to stand on
[57:42] that. You know, so this was all leading
[57:46] up to something after the fall to
[57:49] restore the fellowship that he had with
[57:52] his children.
[57:54] But they chose to go this way to to be
[57:56] like the other countries to be have
[57:59] their king to have their armies to to
[58:01] conquer to do this that and the other.
[58:04] That's what their their desire was. And
[58:06] God said, "Okay, but when you have a
[58:09] king, you're going to lose your
[58:10] daughters and your sons to the military.
[58:13] You're going to have this and this and
[58:14] this." They said, "Or I could be your
[58:16] king. You'll have mana. You'll have
[58:18] peace. You'll have rest."
[58:21] No, I'll take that one.
[58:24] I'll take that one. I got I some people
[58:26] I got to go learn on my own. I can't I
[58:30] just can't take the word. Working in the
[58:31] shop training some of the guys when I
[58:33] was doing the acrylics and stuff like
[58:35] that is someone tell me I I know that
[58:37] you've done it. You have the experience,
[58:39] but I got to learn this on my own. To
[58:41] one of them, I had to tell him, "Okay,
[58:43] if you do this one more time, you're
[58:44] going to pay for it." And look at me. I
[58:47] said, "You've already ruined enough
[58:48] material." I said, "You're going to have
[58:50] to pay for the next portion of
[58:52] material." He goes, "Well, how much that
[58:53] cost?" "Oh, it's about $2,000 a sheet."
[58:56] "Okay, I'll start paying attention."
[58:59] And sometimes God has to get our
[59:01] attention that way. So, here in in the
[59:04] old in the temple, it was a type of
[59:06] where God wanting to fellowship with his
[59:09] family, wanting to be there, wanting to
[59:12] to talk with him. And you know, just as
[59:14] a child, and brother Dan's going to get
[59:16] to know that here, how much fun it is.
[59:18] And then also when they get to the age
[59:20] where okay mom and dad take him home
[59:22] now.
[59:25] You'll get to that one.
[59:28] Take him home now. And then also when
[59:30] he's about 16 or 17 and you need help,
[59:34] you can't find him because he's with his
[59:36] friends.
[59:38] But it's all part of a life cycle. It's
[59:40] all part of life cycle, you know. Hey
[59:42] dad, can I go here? Hey mom, can we do
[59:45] this? you know, and then now, you know,
[59:48] and I can say for guys because my
[59:50] daughters are growing up, it's it's
[59:52] reversed again. Hey, dad, can we do this
[59:54] for you? Hey, mom. And it's all part of
[59:57] life.
[59:59] And as a Christian walk, it it is
[1:00:01] something that you learn as you go. Some
[1:00:04] of us learn well, let me let me rephrase
[1:00:07] that. Some of you learn faster than some
[1:00:08] of us. Some of us have to repeat it
[1:00:11] enough times, you know. Okay. I promised
[1:00:15] myself I would never put my finger over
[1:00:17] the product I'm about to hit with a
[1:00:18] hammer. But I did it again. And then I
[1:00:21] did it again. You know what I'm saying?
[1:00:23] It's just eventually learn and you look
[1:00:26] like this because they took the thumb
[1:00:27] off so you wouldn't hit it anymore.
[1:00:30] God knows how to take care of us.
[1:00:33] He does know how to take care of us. So
[1:00:36] just looking back at that old temp the
[1:00:38] temple the the original how how they
[1:00:41] made it. How has brother Lyall's done
[1:00:43] such a
[1:00:45] such a a description of all and how how
[1:00:48] everything has a meaning, everything has
[1:00:49] a place, everything has a part and you
[1:00:53] know and God is very very particular
[1:00:56] about how he does things.
[1:00:58] He's not one well that's good enough.
[1:01:01] No, it's perfect every time he knows. So
[1:01:05] as as this is coming up and it's
[1:01:07] speaking all the Old Testament is
[1:01:10] speaking
[1:01:12] of Jesus Christ
[1:01:15] of him being restored back to like it
[1:01:18] was in the Garden of Eden. There is
[1:01:22] Isaiah speaking, "Behold, a virgin shall
[1:01:25] conceive and and the all the different
[1:01:27] scriptures of one that is coming,
[1:01:31] one that is is going to take our place
[1:01:33] even when we should have died." And and
[1:01:37] you know, looking at it and and if you
[1:01:39] pay much attention to the news, this
[1:01:41] this world is getting better all the
[1:01:43] time, isn't it?
[1:01:45] Well, you're looking at different news
[1:01:46] than I am then because he was saying
[1:01:47] yes. It just seems like everything is a
[1:01:50] disaster right now. Everything is going
[1:01:52] backwards. Everything is going contrary.
[1:01:55] But if everything was going great, I
[1:01:57] don't think we'd be seeking God's face.
[1:02:01] If everything if I had everything I
[1:02:02] needed, I would say, "Why do I need
[1:02:04] God?"
[1:02:06] But there are times when it just makes
[1:02:08] me get on my knees and say, "Lord, I
[1:02:09] need you. I need your help."
[1:02:12] You know, I I do this and I'm sure some
[1:02:15] of you do. You get onto the news and
[1:02:17] after a little I just turn it off
[1:02:18] because it's just it's not even worth
[1:02:21] hearing and looking at. You're saying,
[1:02:22] "How can people be that way?" You know,
[1:02:24] here and there there's a good piece of
[1:02:26] news, some something nice and but it's
[1:02:29] you've already gone through 20 of the
[1:02:30] other side.
[1:02:32] But there is good news right here.
[1:02:37] Go back to the last chapter
[1:02:39] in Revelations. is if you get a little
[1:02:41] down and see what he's promised you and
[1:02:43] what he's going to do and just encourage
[1:02:45] yourself.
[1:02:48] All of the Old Testament was speaking to
[1:02:50] the coming of Christ the redeemer.
[1:02:53] And so as we think about things and and
[1:02:56] those things and look at them, we'll get
[1:02:58] a little bit into the New Testament
[1:02:59] here. But again, the Old Testament was a
[1:03:02] shadow of what God wanted to do. There
[1:03:05] was a sacrifice made. There was a
[1:03:07] sacrifice accepted.
[1:03:10] That one was a daily sacrifice, a once
[1:03:12] in a year, and then this one is a once
[1:03:15] and forever. It's covered.
[1:03:18] You know, wouldn't it be nice if if it
[1:03:21] was you bought the house and they say,
[1:03:23] "Just give us the one payment and it
[1:03:24] would be yours."
[1:03:27] Well, they do if you give it all at one
[1:03:29] time. Just most of us, we can't. But
[1:03:33] Jesus paid it all.
[1:03:35] All to him I owe. You know, I had a debt
[1:03:38] I couldn't pay. and he said, "I've got
[1:03:40] it covered." So,
[1:03:42] you know, they when Jesus comes and he's
[1:03:45] now he's now in his ministry
[1:03:49] and uh
[1:03:51] there's a Israel had been looking
[1:03:54] looking forward, looking back to wanting
[1:03:56] to be restored back to where they
[1:03:58] wanted. There were were people that were
[1:04:00] designed where is this Messiah that's
[1:04:02] been promised? Where is this God? You
[1:04:05] know that he said, "We've heard it in
[1:04:07] the scriptures. My mom told me about it.
[1:04:08] My grandma told me about it. My grandpa
[1:04:10] told about every time I went to service,
[1:04:12] the priest spoke about a return of the
[1:04:16] mighty king and the mighty God. You know
[1:04:17] where is he? Where is he? But there was
[1:04:20] a promise in the word of God, but it had
[1:04:22] its time in its place.
[1:04:24] Behold, a virgin shall conceive.
[1:04:30] And you know, you hear you hear the I I
[1:04:33] remember brother Green saying and
[1:04:34] brother Brandham talked about it. All
[1:04:37] the young ladies were preparing because
[1:04:38] they thought it was going to be them.
[1:04:40] But it was so many years down the road.
[1:04:42] But one day a virgin conceived because
[1:04:46] God's word never fails. And there
[1:04:49] started that the beginning to show the
[1:04:53] promise of redemption being fulfilled.
[1:04:56] You know, I um I sometimes you see on
[1:04:59] the news where somebody lost something
[1:05:02] and they had to take it in and in
[1:05:05] to a pawn shop or something and then
[1:05:08] they're able to go get it back. They
[1:05:11] were like or maybe it was lost and then
[1:05:13] it was found the joy of it, you know.
[1:05:17] So, they're they're looking for a
[1:05:19] temple. They're they're still uh Israel,
[1:05:21] the natural Israel is still looking for
[1:05:23] that temple, still looking for that
[1:05:25] place to worship. It even says when
[1:05:27] after Peter and and them received the
[1:05:30] the u the Holy Ghost coming down and and
[1:05:33] and all that happened, they got up and
[1:05:35] they were going to church. They were
[1:05:36] going to the temple the next morning
[1:05:39] that they were still in that hey, not
[1:05:42] realizing that this was going to be the
[1:05:44] temple of the Lord.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; That was what it was coming to. So in
[1:05:49] St. John chapter 2 19 and 21
[1:05:54] they had asked him
[1:05:57] they talking to him about the temple and
[1:05:59] he answered and said unto them destroy
[1:06:01] this temple and in three days I will
[1:06:04] raise it up. Then said the Jews 40 and
[1:06:07] six years was a temple in building and
[1:06:10] you will rear it up in three days.
[1:06:14] took them 46 years to make this and you
[1:06:18] can make one like it in three days.
[1:06:21] No, it was a complete different temple.
[1:06:24] So, here is a promise of a restoration
[1:06:28] and God has come himself in flesh to
[1:06:31] restore.
[1:06:33] And the only way he could understand my
[1:06:36] pain and my aggravation and my futility
[1:06:40] and all was to come in a human body and
[1:06:43] be touched by the filling of our
[1:06:44] infirmities.
[1:06:47] I I would ask you right now, how many of
[1:06:50] you
[1:06:52] would go and to a judge and say, "The
[1:06:55] next prisoner that comes in and it's
[1:06:58] sentenced, I'd like to take his place,
[1:07:01] her place."
[1:07:03] let them go free. I know they committed
[1:07:06] the crime,
[1:07:09] but I want to take their place.
[1:07:11] And I didn't see any hands raised, and
[1:07:14] mine wasn't up either. But there was one
[1:07:17] that did.
[1:07:19] There was one that did because he knew
[1:07:21] that was the only way it was going to
[1:07:23] happen. And you know, he had you in
[1:07:25] mind.
[1:07:27] Your name was written on that lamb's
[1:07:29] book of life. You were in mind there.
[1:07:32] And that's why you're here responding to
[1:07:33] that today. He said, "Destroy this
[1:07:35] temple and in three days I will raise it
[1:07:37] up speaking the he spoke of the temple
[1:07:42] of his body."
[1:07:44] So there was a crucifixion.
[1:07:48] There was a taking of his life
[1:07:51] and he was buried
[1:07:54] and you know
[1:07:57] they went to see they went to see the
[1:07:59] tomb on the third day.
[1:08:02] and the Mary and they come back and they
[1:08:05] said, "We've gone and it's it's empty.
[1:08:08] He's not there."
[1:08:12] But that's what he had promised that he
[1:08:14] wouldn't be in there. And yet they're
[1:08:16] still questioning it. They're still
[1:08:18] wondering about it. But he makes himself
[1:08:20] known. He says, "Go tell my disciples,
[1:08:23] tell them together, I will meet with
[1:08:25] them there."
[1:08:28] Now, Peter, now we know
[1:08:31] Peter had had had made a comment. Lord,
[1:08:34] I'll go with you. I'll never forsake
[1:08:36] you. No, I'll never turn my back on you.
[1:08:39] And Jesus turns around, looks up, you're
[1:08:40] going to deny me three times.
[1:08:44] Peter says, "Not I, not me." When Peter
[1:08:47] denies him on the third time, he
[1:08:49] realizes he runs off in shame. He runs
[1:08:53] off him. And I imagine Peter's thinking
[1:08:54] is I'll never be able to look him face
[1:08:57] to face again. I'll never be able to
[1:08:59] stand in his presence again. Look what I
[1:09:02] just I denied my ver the very Messiah my
[1:09:05] God.
[1:09:07] And I I always say this and Peter too
[1:09:12] when he tells is this tells him he says
[1:09:14] tell my disciples to meet me over here
[1:09:16] in eternal house and tell Peter also.
[1:09:20] How many have heard that from the Lord?
[1:09:23] And you too also. Your name has to be
[1:09:25] put in there. You have to say, I'm
[1:09:28] included in this.
[1:09:31] So now there's a promise. He said,
[1:09:32] "Behold, when I, you know, they they're
[1:09:34] getting ready for him. He's he's about
[1:09:36] to be taken back home, raptured up, if I
[1:09:38] could say it that way." But he makes a
[1:09:40] promise to his disciples. He says, "I
[1:09:43] will come back and I will dwell in you,
[1:09:47] not with you, but in you." And so Acts 2
[1:09:52] 37-39
[1:09:55] and we know that after this
[1:09:59] it they're there and and the Holy Ghost
[1:10:01] has fallen down and demonstrated and and
[1:10:05] they they they saw the action of God
[1:10:08] working in people.
[1:10:10] It just wasn't a priest getting and
[1:10:12] opening the Bible and saying the Lord
[1:10:15] said this, the Lord has come. Now it was
[1:10:17] happening. It was alive.
[1:10:19] And the people are looking, what is
[1:10:21] this? Let's go see what it is. And and
[1:10:25] you know the that part. But
[1:10:28] Peter gets up and he preaches after the
[1:10:31] Holy Ghost come preaches a message. And
[1:10:33] they asked him, "What do we do?" Acts
[1:10:36] 2:37-39.
[1:10:38] Now when they heard this, they were
[1:10:40] pricricked in their heart and said unto
[1:10:42] Peter and to the rest of the apostle,
[1:10:44] "Men and brethren, what shall we do?
[1:10:49] How do we get this same promise that you
[1:10:52] got?
[1:10:54] H how do we get to that where that
[1:10:55] baptism of the Holy Spirit and God
[1:10:57] coming is in us?" And he says, "Repent
[1:10:59] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:11:02] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:11:04] of sins." And if you behave yourself and
[1:11:07] you keep care of this and you take care.
[1:11:09] No, he said, "And ye shall receive the
[1:11:11] Holy Ghost."
[1:11:15] Sometimes we put a lot of restrictions,
[1:11:18] a lot of things that we want somebody
[1:11:20] else to go through
[1:11:22] so we can measure whether they're ready
[1:11:24] for the Holy Ghost or not.
[1:11:27] They got to meet my standards. No,
[1:11:29] there's one. There's only one we need to
[1:11:31] please.
[1:11:33] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[1:11:36] Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you,
[1:11:39] to those that were there, and to your
[1:11:41] children, and to all that are a far off,
[1:11:44] and as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:11:47] call.
[1:11:49] Have you heard your name? Has he called
[1:11:52] you? Has he talked to you and said,
[1:11:54] "Hey, you're one of mine." That's why
[1:11:57] you respond, you know? So, so here it
[1:12:00] is. God had desired a temple,
[1:12:05] but not a temple made with hands.
[1:12:08] But he had desired to temple himself and
[1:12:10] his family and his children. That was
[1:12:13] what he had wanted to do. Not to walk
[1:12:16] with them like he did for three and a
[1:12:17] half years,
[1:12:19] but to be in them.
[1:12:22] Now,
[1:12:24] after that place, and I'm I'm going
[1:12:26] through this quickly, and I know that
[1:12:28] this is nothing new to all of you. You
[1:12:30] know, you know what the word of God
[1:12:32] says. And
[1:12:34] Peter said, you know, they're going
[1:12:36] after here's here. I like this. They've
[1:12:38] received the Holy Ghost. They've had
[1:12:39] that experience. It's just been a
[1:12:41] marvelous thing. We don't know for sure
[1:12:42] how long it was. Did it last a day, five
[1:12:44] days, a week? Doesn't make a difference.
[1:12:46] It was God in them now. He had restored.
[1:12:50] And so because of that, Peter said, "We
[1:12:52] don't have to go to church no more.
[1:12:53] We're our own." No. Peter and them were
[1:12:55] on their way over. It says, "And then
[1:12:58] Peter, when Peter said silver and gold,
[1:13:00] they were on their way over to church.
[1:13:03] They were on the way back over and they
[1:13:06] meet this man who asked them if he was
[1:13:09] begging and asking, "Could you give us
[1:13:11] something?" And
[1:13:13] Peter took him by the right hand and
[1:13:15] lifted him. I'm sorry. Then Peter said,
[1:13:17] "Silver and gold have I none, but such
[1:13:20] as I have I give thee."
[1:13:24] Peter recognized who was in him.
[1:13:30] That was that same Jesus that walked
[1:13:32] around was now living in him.
[1:13:36] The same Peter that denied him three
[1:13:38] times. The same Peter that has said, "I
[1:13:41] wouldn't, but he did."
[1:13:44] is now the the habitation of God
[1:13:47] himself. He is the temple of the Holy
[1:13:50] Ghost. Could I say it that way? That's a
[1:13:53] little shocking,
[1:13:55] but if you're one of his and he's in it,
[1:13:56] you are the temple. That's where he
[1:13:58] dwells.
[1:14:02] You're looking at me like it's kind of
[1:14:03] hard to believe, but that's his word.
[1:14:06] That's God's word. You have to yield to
[1:14:08] him and say, "Yes, Lord." Again, Peter
[1:14:12] said, "Silver and gold have I none, but
[1:14:14] such as I have, I give thee. In the name
[1:14:18] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and
[1:14:21] walk. And he took him by the right hand
[1:14:23] and lifted him up. And immediately his
[1:14:26] feet and ankle bones received strength.
[1:14:29] And he leaped up and walked and entered
[1:14:31] with him into the temple, walking and
[1:14:33] leaping and praising God.
[1:14:36] And all the people saw him walking and
[1:14:39] praising God.
[1:14:42] This wasn't done in a corner. This was
[1:14:44] done in front of everybody. They were
[1:14:46] showing that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:14:47] yesterday, today, and forever. He's
[1:14:49] never changed. And they But I I like
[1:14:52] that they were on their way to the
[1:14:54] temple.
[1:14:56] They were going to go worship the Lord.
[1:14:57] They were going to go. We We look at
[1:14:59] this and we see there is a promise of
[1:15:02] restoration. And I'm going to try to
[1:15:04] watch my time here
[1:15:06] so I don't take too long here. There's a
[1:15:09] promise of restoration going back to
[1:15:13] where Adam and Eve had been sent out of.
[1:15:16] Walk with him, talk with him, fellowship
[1:15:19] with him every day.
[1:15:23] I I I'd like to think about it, but I'm
[1:15:26] sure I am nowhere anywhere near close in
[1:15:29] my imagination of what it was like. If
[1:15:32] I've got a little part of it, there's
[1:15:33] millions more to it. Could you imagine
[1:15:37] being at peace all the time? At rest all
[1:15:39] the time. And let me say it this way.
[1:15:43] When Eve said, "Adam, it's a little warm
[1:15:46] over here. Can you send a cool breeze?"
[1:15:48] I don't think Adam ever thought, "No, do
[1:15:50] it yourself. Get up and do it yourself."
[1:15:54] No, there was perfect harmony. There was
[1:15:57] pleasure in pleasing one another and
[1:15:59] helping one another, being part of the
[1:16:02] family, you know, and so
[1:16:06] They they were going back to that place
[1:16:09] again
[1:16:12] to where you walk with him, you talk
[1:16:14] with him, he walks with you, he talks
[1:16:16] with you anywhere and everywhere.
[1:16:20] It doesn't have to be in church service.
[1:16:24] It can it should be. It can be at home.
[1:16:27] It could be at work. It can be with your
[1:16:28] neighbor. It can be anywhere. could be
[1:16:30] at school when you're
[1:16:32] when you're looking over as you're being
[1:16:34] trained over someone that is sick
[1:16:37] and you just want to put your hands and
[1:16:38] say, "Lord, such as I have, I give."
[1:16:43] Because you have it. He's in you.
[1:16:46] And he's not limited in you unless you
[1:16:48] limit him.
[1:16:51] I think we limit him too much. I'm not
[1:16:54] good enough for him.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Let him make that decision. Right.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are. I'll come.
[1:17:02] And and repentance really is sometimes
[1:17:05] hard for us, but it's a such a blessing.
[1:17:09] I'm sorry. I was wrong.
[1:17:14] So, we're look at they're there. Now,
[1:17:17] what God had Moses had had seen the
[1:17:20] vision of the temple and they and they
[1:17:22] had built that place for God for they
[1:17:24] could meet God. Now God is templed in
[1:17:28] them.
[1:17:31] The same Jesus Christ that had walked
[1:17:34] and was with them in a physical sense is
[1:17:37] now living in them.
[1:17:39] The word the works that I do shall you
[1:17:41] do also. He said the words that I say
[1:17:44] shall you speak also. He you'll take my
[1:17:46] word and you'll give it.
[1:17:49] Now, so
[1:17:52] as I see this, it's beginning to change
[1:17:56] and and yet if you look through the
[1:17:57] through the book of Acts, you see the
[1:17:59] the changes that are going that are
[1:18:01] being recorded of of the the inddwelling
[1:18:03] of the Holy Spirit. But it did not make
[1:18:06] them perfect on the outer side, the
[1:18:09] flesh side. this had not been redeemed
[1:18:12] yet because even Paul had to call out
[1:18:16] Peter in one of the meetings and said,
[1:18:17] "Peter, you're being a hypocrite."
[1:18:20] And some of some of them didn't get
[1:18:23] along. So, some went this way and some
[1:18:24] went that way.
[1:18:27] But in all this, the message and the
[1:18:29] gospel got spread.
[1:18:34] Now, if we get into Romans, let's get
[1:18:36] into a little bit into Romans. And I
[1:18:38] think that's as far as we'll go.
[1:18:40] here Romans 11
[1:18:45] 30-36
[1:18:49] and this is Paul Paul's writings and and
[1:18:52] speaking
[1:18:55] for as ye in times past he says have not
[1:18:58] believed God yet have now obtained mercy
[1:19:02] through their unbelief he is speaking
[1:19:06] of Israel at this time even so these
[1:19:09] These also have now not believed that
[1:19:12] through your mercy they may also obtain
[1:19:15] mercy. And I like that
[1:19:18] I have received mercy and through the
[1:19:20] mercy that I have received. Could I show
[1:19:22] that same mercy to someone else?
[1:19:28] Maybe become like that that little
[1:19:30] sistern or that little um that that
[1:19:34] well that brother Brandon would go to.
[1:19:36] And he said he said he would talk to it
[1:19:38] and he would talk about you know what is
[1:19:40] it that makes that water come up? What
[1:19:42] makes that water? Is it because you know
[1:19:44] the the animals come to me and he's
[1:19:46] talking and and he said if it would
[1:19:47] answer back no it's something inside me
[1:19:49] coming up. It's coming out. It's going.
[1:19:51] It is always there. And it says,
[1:19:57] "Let me make sure I'm on the same."
[1:20:00] For God hath concluded them all in
[1:20:02] unbelief, that he might have mercy upon
[1:20:05] all. And then
[1:20:07] Paul says, "Oh, the depth of the riches,
[1:20:10] both of the wisdom and knowledge of God.
[1:20:13] How unsearchable are his judgments and
[1:20:16] his ways past finding out." He says,"For
[1:20:20] who has known the mind of the Lord or
[1:20:24] who has been his counselor?"
[1:20:28] And and and Paul as he's writing this,
[1:20:30] he realized this, should I say, the
[1:20:32] enormity, the the greatness of all. And
[1:20:34] and that's sometimes words just can't
[1:20:37] describe what we would like to say. But
[1:20:40] he says, "Oh, the depth of the riches,
[1:20:43] both of the wisdom and knowledge of God.
[1:20:45] How uncarchable are his judgment and his
[1:20:48] ways past finding out for who has known
[1:20:51] the mind of the Lord? Or who hath seen
[1:20:53] his been his counselor?
[1:20:56] The Lord talks with you and and he asks
[1:20:58] you if you you learn to listen to him,
[1:21:01] you learn how he speaks to you. And this
[1:21:03] is something that should be daily.
[1:21:07] Well, when's the last time you talked to
[1:21:08] him? Oh, I think it was January of 1947
[1:21:12] or something like that.
[1:21:14] Why? It should have been just recently.
[1:21:18] Should be every day.
[1:21:20] He desires that fellowship. He wants to
[1:21:23] talk with you. He, you know, share.
[1:21:25] How's your son? How does your day go
[1:21:27] today?
[1:21:29] Well, you know, Dad, it was like this
[1:21:30] and this and this. Father, it was like
[1:21:32] this and this. I ran into this problem,
[1:21:34] but that's when I noticed you you
[1:21:37] resolved it for me.
[1:21:40] I I I reached out to you and you said,
[1:21:41] "Hey, I've got it under control." just a
[1:21:44] fellowship. He says,
[1:21:50] "Or who hath first given to him and it
[1:21:53] shall be recompense unto him for of him
[1:21:56] and through him and to him are all
[1:21:58] things to whom be glory forever. Amen."
[1:22:04] You know, I do believe the Lord will
[1:22:07] talk with you and have a conversation
[1:22:10] with you.
[1:22:12] Same way that I have with my wife, the
[1:22:14] same way that I have with my daughters,
[1:22:15] same way. Now, the level of conversation
[1:22:18] may change with who you're having the
[1:22:19] conversation with. I can't have the same
[1:22:22] conversation with my granddaughter Khloe
[1:22:24] that I can have with my wife. But I can
[1:22:26] have a conversation with Khloe, my
[1:22:27] daughter, my granddaughter. And as you
[1:22:30] grow in Christ, you'll realize the
[1:22:31] conversations that you and God have
[1:22:33] changed.
[1:22:35] There's something about, you know, how
[1:22:37] you can talk with him. You know, how he
[1:22:38] responds to you,
[1:22:42] you know, and he's wanting that. He's
[1:22:45] wanting that.
[1:22:47] Romans 12 1 and two.
[1:22:51] I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
[1:22:53] the miracles of God, by the mercies of
[1:22:55] God, that you present your bodies a
[1:22:58] living sacrifice,
[1:23:00] holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
[1:23:03] reasonable service, and be not conformed
[1:23:07] to this world, but be transformed by the
[1:23:09] renewing of your mind, that ye may prove
[1:23:13] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:23:16] perfect will of God.
[1:23:19] Now I I read some of those and I say I I
[1:23:22] can't match that. I can't do that. I
[1:23:24] don't always fit that. But he Paul is
[1:23:27] saying I'm I'm I beseech you. I'm asking
[1:23:29] you. I'm begging you. I'm telling you.
[1:23:31] I'm pleading with you. Do it.
[1:23:34] Do it. Get to that place in your life.
[1:23:38] And he wouldn't ask us if we couldn't
[1:23:40] happen. if we couldn't get there, you
[1:23:43] know, in in how you get to God, we get
[1:23:46] we read his word
[1:23:50] and his word is the truth.
[1:23:53] There's no errors in God's word. Now,
[1:23:56] some of my translations and
[1:23:58] interpretations could be wrong, but
[1:24:00] God's word is pure and true. So, he's
[1:24:02] saying, "I I I beseech you. I beg you.
[1:24:04] I'm telling you, I insist. If I could
[1:24:07] make you do it, I would.
[1:24:11] He says, "By the mercies of God that you
[1:24:13] present your bodies a living sacrifice,
[1:24:15] holy and acceptable unto God, which is
[1:24:19] your reasonable service." How else could
[1:24:21] you repay, if I could say it that way,
[1:24:23] back to God, but that to give yourself
[1:24:25] to him, and let him use you and be not
[1:24:29] conformed to this world.
[1:24:32] I don't know if there's anything in the
[1:24:34] world anymore that I want to conform to.
[1:24:36] It's so ugly. It's so It's so Here and
[1:24:40] there there's something good but it's
[1:24:42] just constantly this this and this.
[1:24:45] Nobody has taken any responsibility for
[1:24:47] their actions. Nothing but blame that
[1:24:49] the other you know and then that you
[1:24:53] wonder why somebody would take their own
[1:24:56] life
[1:24:58] but it's becoming so happening so much
[1:25:02] just can't stand it anymore and they
[1:25:03] take their own life. They don't see a a
[1:25:05] way out of this.
[1:25:08] Jesus says, "But be not conformed to
[1:25:11] this world, but be transformed by the re
[1:25:13] renewing of your mind. Let this mind
[1:25:16] which was in Christ."
[1:25:19] That's what Paul said. Think the things
[1:25:22] that he says, take them at his word.
[1:25:26] Say, "Lord, you said
[1:25:30] you said and you keep your word.
[1:25:32] Therefore, I can take you at your word.
[1:25:37] He says the renew that you may prove you
[1:25:40] may be a good example that the it may
[1:25:44] even be shown in your life what is a
[1:25:47] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:25:50] God.
[1:25:52] And maybe just touch this one in
[1:25:54] Corinthians 1 Corinthians 3
[1:25:58] 6 and 17.
[1:26:00] 16 and 17. Know ye not that ye are the
[1:26:04] temple of God, and that the spirit of
[1:26:06] God dwelleth in you?
[1:26:09] He says, if any man defile the temple of
[1:26:13] God, God shall him shall God destroy.
[1:26:16] For the temple of God is holy, which
[1:26:19] temple ye are. That's how God has chosen
[1:26:24] in this time after he ascended him is to
[1:26:28] come and dwell in us.
[1:26:32] Now your experience with God may be
[1:26:35] different than my experience with God
[1:26:37] and how God deals with but it'll have
[1:26:39] the same effect.
[1:26:42] It'll make you a son and daughter of God
[1:26:45] and act like a son and daughter of God
[1:26:48] because he doesn't have one going that
[1:26:50] way and one going this way. There is a
[1:26:52] way God deals with us. And and sometimes
[1:26:55] we say, "Well, Lord, how am I standing
[1:26:57] with you?" and he'll take you back to
[1:27:00] his word and he'll open it to you and
[1:27:03] say, "Look at this. Look at this. Read
[1:27:06] this. Hear this." Maybe the minister
[1:27:09] gets up and ministers and God answers a
[1:27:11] question through that.
[1:27:14] God answers if you will listen and make
[1:27:17] him available.
[1:27:20] Yeah. Musicians can can come up.
[1:27:26] Know ye not that ye are the temple of
[1:27:30] God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth
[1:27:33] in you? If any man defiles the temple of
[1:27:36] God, him shall God destroy. For the
[1:27:39] temple of God is holy, which temple you
[1:27:42] are. Now, Paul is speaking this to the
[1:27:44] Corinthians. And if you read the book of
[1:27:46] the Corinthians, it's a lot of problems.
[1:27:49] It's a lot of issues and things, but God
[1:27:53] still gave them the same promise.
[1:27:55] He didn't say except for the U
[1:27:57] Corinthians. He said no. He said present
[1:28:01] yourself that way.
[1:28:03] And that's not a a false covering.
[1:28:07] That should be an everyday life.
[1:28:09] And some of the simple things
[1:28:12] that you can learn and do every day.
[1:28:17] And I'm not saying you don't. I'm just
[1:28:19] just saying
[1:28:21] when you wake up in the morning,
[1:28:23] acknowledge him first.
[1:28:25] First and foremost,
[1:28:28] Lord, thank you for life this morning.
[1:28:31] Thank you for breath this morning. I
[1:28:34] don't know what the holds this this day
[1:28:36] holds, but I know who holds this day.
[1:28:39] I'm committing my day, my thoughts, my
[1:28:41] ways to you, Lord. And if I do something
[1:28:43] wrong, let it catch my attention and
[1:28:45] make let me make it right quickly.
[1:28:49] And you know, that's it. It it would
[1:28:51] shouldn't be just a habit. to be
[1:28:53] something we desire to do, you know, and
[1:28:57] and the day goes by and maybe something
[1:29:01] changes, something happens, and you say,
[1:29:03] "Lord, thank you for that. You saw that
[1:29:05] coming and you warned me. You showed me
[1:29:07] to go this way
[1:29:10] or Lord, I wasn't expecting that
[1:29:11] blessing today, but thank you for that
[1:29:13] blessing." You know, God walks with you.
[1:29:16] He talks with you. He desire he would
[1:29:18] come in the cool of the evening every
[1:29:21] day to fellowship with Adam and Eve. His
[1:29:24] desire for us is great.
[1:29:27] Amen.
[1:29:29] And there is no one greater than God.
[1:29:34] And he says, "Take my hand.
[1:29:37] I'll walk with you. I'll talk with you.
[1:29:40] Let's go in this together."
[1:29:42] Hold to God's unchanging hand. It will
[1:29:47] always be there.
[1:29:51] See if we get the words up to the the
[1:29:52] song.
[1:29:55] Time
[1:29:56] is filled with swift transition.
[1:30:03] Not
[1:30:04] of earth unmove can stand.
[1:30:10] Oh, build your hopes on things eternal.

[1:31:14] still more closely to him clean.
[1:31:20] You've got to hold to God's unchanging
[1:31:24] hand.
[1:31:27] Oh

[1:31:35] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[1:31:41] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:31:48] Oh, cover it not this world's main
[1:31:52] richest
[1:31:55] that soil
[1:31:58] decay.
[1:32:02] Seek to gain those heavenly treasures.
[1:32:09] They will never pass away.
[1:32:14] You've got to hold to God's unchanging
[1:32:19] hand.
[1:32:21] You've got to hold to God's unchanging
[1:32:25] hand.
[1:32:29] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[1:32:35] Behold
[1:32:37] to God's unchanging hand.
[1:32:42] When your journey is completed,
[1:32:49] if to God you have been true,
[1:32:55] fair and bright, the home in glory,
[1:33:02] your
[1:33:04] raptured soul of you.
[1:33:08] You've got to hold to God's unchanging
[1:33:12] hand.
[1:33:16] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:33:22] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[1:33:29] Hold to God's unchanging.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Let's Let's all stand one more time.
[1:33:34] Daniel,
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; you got to hold to God's unchanging
[1:33:39] hand.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; You got to hold to God's unchanging
[1:33:46] hand.
[1:33:49] Oh, build your hopes on things eternal.
[1:33:56] Oh, hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:04] You know, it's a good song for what
[1:34:05] brother Aaron said. We want to hold to
[1:34:07] that hand.
[1:34:09] That hand wants to hold to us
[1:34:12] even more than we want to hold to that
[1:34:14] hand.
[1:34:16] What Brother Aaron said is right.
[1:34:19] God wants fellowship with us more than
[1:34:22] we want fellowship with him.
[1:34:25] He wants to be a father to us. He wants
[1:34:28] to be a friend to us. And sometimes,
[1:34:31] brother Aaron, we just need to slow down
[1:34:35] and let him talk with us. Let him let
[1:34:37] him be there for us.
[1:34:40] And then, friends, I promise you, your
[1:34:44] life will be better.
[1:34:46] Just slow down. Hold to that unchanging
[1:34:49] hand. Billy, if you want to come up and
[1:34:52] close.
[1:34:55] My friend here, young man, loves the
[1:34:58] Lord.
[1:34:59] He's uh he's a tremendous resource.
[1:35:04] He's good at about anything that he
[1:35:05] does. He loves the word of God. He loves
[1:35:08] the Bible and and uh he's time that I've
[1:35:12] spent with him over the past week or so,
[1:35:14] the past few days, see that he's got a
[1:35:18] wonderful knowledge of the word. And by
[1:35:20] the grace of God,
[1:35:22] Brother William is this is Josiah's
[1:35:25] brother. If you don't know him, I think
[1:35:26] everybody knows him. He's going to be
[1:35:28] with us for at least six months. We'll
[1:35:31] try to keep you longer. Lord willing.
[1:35:34] It's always Lord willing. Really, would
[1:35:36] you close in prayer, my friend?
[1:35:40] Let's pray.
[1:35:44] Dear heavenly father, I thank you for
[1:35:46] the word that we heard today. Lord, it's
[1:35:49] very practical message. Lord, I know
[1:35:52] often times, you know, we love the
[1:35:54] deeper things of God. Lord, I pray that
[1:35:57] you would help us to never forget the
[1:35:59] basics, Lord, in all that we do. Help us
[1:36:03] to wake up every morning and do your
[1:36:05] will, Lord Jesus. If there's any here
[1:36:08] that are sick or have any physical
[1:36:11] needs, I pray that you would meet each
[1:36:13] person in individually. Lord Jesus,
[1:36:17] if there's anybody suffering with
[1:36:19] temptation here, Lord Jesus, I pray for
[1:36:21] victory. Lord,
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; we know that you always do your part,
[1:36:25] Lord Jesus. So, I pray that you would
[1:36:28] help us to do our part.
[1:36:30] Help us to claim all of your promises,
[1:36:33] Lord Jesus. Help us not to just be
[1:36:35] hearers, but also doers of the word.
[1:36:37] Lord Jesus,
[1:36:39] give us just a a love for your word,
[1:36:42] even more than we already have. Lord
[1:36:43] Jesus,
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; a love for that presence, Lord.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. because we know that in that
[1:36:48] presence even dead things live just like
[1:36:50] Aaron's rod. Lord Jesus, I ask for the
[1:36:54] remainder of this week that that
[1:36:57] presence would go with each and every
[1:36:58] person here. Lord Jesus, let us have the
[1:37:02] energy, Lord Jesus, not only to help
[1:37:04] ourselves, but to be a light to the
[1:37:06] world. Lord, as we go out every day, I
[1:37:10] commit this congregation into your
[1:37:12] hands, Lord Jesus, and pray that you go
[1:37:13] with us and just use us in Jesus' name.
[1:37:17] Amen.
[1:37:25] We are uh the storms looks like kept
[1:37:29] most of the people away tonight. So, you
[1:37:32] know what I like to do when we just have
[1:37:34] a small congregation? I just love it.
[1:37:36] And Billy, this is the way that if you
[1:37:38] travel through Latin America, which you
[1:37:40] have been a little bit,
[1:37:43] if you go to a a service,
[1:37:46] usually the um you get to shake every
[1:37:50] single person's hand. And what you what
[1:37:52] you do is you have a a greeting line and
[1:37:54] and you start with one person and then
[1:37:57] you shake that person's hand, then you
[1:37:59] step stand next to that person. Then you
[1:38:01] come through and you continue to shake
[1:38:03] hands and everybody continues to line up
[1:38:05] all the way out the door. So I want
[1:38:07] since we're um so few tonight, I want
[1:38:10] everybody to shake Brother Billy's hand
[1:38:12] and then stand next to him and then uh
[1:38:15] we will form the line all the way out.
[1:38:17] Billy, if you come over here
[1:38:20] and then brother Aaron, if you would
[1:38:21] start so we all know and then Sister
[1:38:23] Heather, yeah, stand right there in
[1:38:25] front of the chairs there.
[1:38:32] And let's uh yeah, brother Aaron, maybe.
[1:38:35] Yeah, whichever way, Sister Heather,
[1:38:38] that's great right there. You're
[1:38:39] perfect. Good. And then we'll we'll all
[1:38:42] come we'll come down the aisle through
[1:38:43] here and we'll let's go. Let's go. Uh
[1:38:46] yeah, that's fine. Perfect. Perfect.
[1:38:48] Good.
[1:38:50] We are well practiced. Hold to God's
[1:38:51] unchanging hand.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, to God's unchanging hand.
[1:38:59] You got to hold to God's unchanging
