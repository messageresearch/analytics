[2:59] a we've been married 26
[3:02] years and yeah we just celebrated 26
[3:04] years a couple weeks ago and um it's
[3:07] been it's been all been good I'm
[3:10] thankful for her
[3:12] patience um my uh my cousin
[3:18] um she uh she passed away a little while
[3:22] ago um about a week ago or so and uh she
[3:26] had a she had a hard life she um we're
[3:29] going to bury her tomorrow and
[3:33] uh she got strung out on drugs and um
[3:37] she it was just a ever since she was a
[3:40] young girl she had a
[3:42] weakness and uh the family is getting
[3:47] together
[3:48] tomorrow um to pay pay our last respects
[3:52] and and to and
[3:54] barrier but I I want to tell you how
[3:56] important it is the work that we're
[3:58] doing here at the on
[4:01] Tabernacle that we uh David good to see
[4:04] you I acknowledged it before but it's
[4:07] it's good good to have you in service
[4:11] um that we give a
[4:14] place for people to come in and to have
[4:17] some stability in their
[4:19] lives and to have some
[4:22] love when they when they come in no
[4:24] matter who it is we always want to greet
[4:26] them with the right hand of Fellowship
[4:28] we always want to show people love
[4:29] because you never know who you're
[4:31] talking to you you never know what
[4:34] they're going through what they need and
[4:37] most of the time almost all the time
[4:40] it's not really what the pastor says
[4:42] from the
[4:43] pulpit what it usually is is the love
[4:47] that was presented to these these
[4:51] visitors that we might have and I look
[4:54] at my cousin and I just wish that she
[4:56] would have stumbled into a church one
[4:58] day that would have given her love and
[5:03] and taking taking her under their wing
[5:07] and um
[5:11] just showed her here's what Jesus Christ
[5:14] is Jesus Christ loves you the disciples
[5:17] were rough characters most of them and
[5:21] that's what we're here for we Jesus said
[5:23] I am not sent to the ones that don't
[5:26] need a doctor he says I am sent to the
[5:30] sick ones I am sent to the ones that
[5:32] need help and I believe that's that's
[5:34] our church and let's always let's never
[5:36] forget that and I think that I am so
[5:38] proud of what we do at the Tucson
[5:41] Tabernacle that we do have that Ministry
[5:44] and I wanted to get greater and and just
[5:48] going through this we weren't close I
[5:50] haven't talked to my cousin in 20 years
[5:53] but seeing that wow if she would have
[5:56] just had a place that she could have
[5:59] gone to that she felt comfortable just
[6:01] one
[6:02] person if it could have been just it
[6:05] could sister Debbie could be just
[6:06] somebody like you that you just read out
[6:08] a reach out a loving hand to one of
[6:10] these young ladies that that might come
[6:12] in one day or or one of the you know
[6:15] with Daniel or or with Brother John or
[6:18] whoever it is that if someone comes
[6:22] in show them love and and be willing to
[6:26] to go the extra mile for him Jude I
[6:29] believe was said that you're willing to
[6:32] reach down into the
[6:34] fire for somebody and pull them out of
[6:37] the fire and I just want to see us
[6:41] continue on this path and never look
[6:45] back always always represent Jesus
[6:49] Christ that savior wherever you go and
[6:54] we might be the only Jesus Christ that
[6:57] someone ever
[6:58] sees because we represent him the
[7:01] disciples When Jesus ascended the
[7:03] disciples repr represented Jesus Christ
[7:07] and we need to be that Jesus Christ to
[7:10] whoever and as I said you never know you
[7:14] never know the influence that you'll
[7:16] have on someone's life and if you reach
[7:18] out that hand you might very well be the
[7:20] person that they reach out to when they
[7:22] finally make their decision that I want
[7:24] to change my life so just be ready
[7:28] always always be ready
[7:30] um we're going to get to the book of
[7:32] haggi it's uh we're back down to the
[7:35] last three
[7:37] books in the Old Testament um book of
[7:42] Hagi is from here on these are the
[7:47] prophets that prophesied after the
[7:50] Captivity I'm amazed how much happened
[7:55] right before and during this captivity
[7:58] of Jerusalem
[8:00] we see Isaiah starts
[8:02] prophesying here and then and then the
[8:05] Captivity immediately followed Jeremiah
[8:08] prophesies Ezekiel prophesies all the
[8:11] way down through um many of these
[8:14] prophets all during this
[8:17] time so to give a little um history of
[8:24] the Exile so what happened was um Israel
[8:29] as was typical fell into sin God would
[8:33] send prophets and warn them Israel would
[8:36] repent and they fall into sin finally
[8:39] God sent this mighty king named
[8:44] Nebuchadnezzar the most powerful man in
[8:46] the world to come
[8:49] in and lay Siege to
[8:53] Jerusalem so Nebuchadnezzar the king of
[8:55] Babylon comes in they surround the city
[8:59] and and the they first attack in and
[9:02] it's hard to find an exact date but it's
[9:05] around
[9:06] 605 that the Babylonians first come in
[9:09] and they lay a 20year Siege on Jerusalem
[9:13] and things were really rough they they
[9:15] start taking captives Daniel the Prophet
[9:18] Daniel was one of the first captives
[9:20] that they took they brought him and many
[9:23] of his um counterparts many of the Jews
[9:25] they took them to Babylon and they
[9:28] stayed there and then that's around 605
[9:31] and then about
[9:32] 587 they fully captured Jerusalem and
[9:37] they destroyed the temple we've been
[9:40] going through these Bible studies most
[9:42] of you have been here this Temple was a
[9:45] center to their worship Nebuchadnezzar
[9:48] comes in he destroys it tens of
[9:52] thousands of Jews were deported at this
[9:54] time and when they brought the Jews into
[10:00] Babylon that started the time ticking
[10:04] for the prophecy of Jeremiah that they
[10:08] would be in Exile in a Strange Land for
[10:11] 70 years in
[10:13] captivity the time started ticking we
[10:16] know that Daniel prophesied during this
[10:18] Exile and he he um knew from the
[10:22] writings of
[10:23] Jeremiah that um they would be there for
[10:26] this 70 years and then
[10:31] Nebuchadnezzar takes the captives and
[10:34] destroys the temple then comes in an
[10:37] alliance and Allied Forces between the
[10:39] mes and the Persians they attack
[10:41] Nebuchadnezzar's son was the king at
[10:44] that time and they attack they destroy
[10:48] the Babylonians and they take control
[10:50] and that was this king of the mes named
[10:54] dasas then time goes on and uh this King
[10:58] named
[10:59] Cyrus who is a king of the Persians he
[11:04] releases the Jews through this man named
[11:07] zerubabel and
[11:09] zerubabel wants to bring his people back
[11:13] to their homeland of
[11:17] Jerusalem
[11:19] in five about 535
[11:23] 536 they they come out and they lay the
[11:27] foundations of the new Temple temp Le
[11:29] that was
[11:30] destroyed it's been 70 years since it
[11:33] was prophesied or since they came into
[11:36] captivity and now they are released and
[11:40] they come back and they want to
[11:42] rebuild this Temple and they go and they
[11:45] lay the
[11:46] foundations for the new
[11:49] Temple then um around 16 years later
[11:55] which we will get to at about 520 BC
[11:57] Hagi shows up
[11:59] and um he begins
[12:03] prophesying
[12:04] now I'm going to start with Ezra chapter
[12:08] 1 Ezra the first five chapters is
[12:14] during um hagi's prophecy so let's read
[12:19] um let's read e Ezra 5 chapter 5 verse
[12:22] one so Ezra is um Hagi is mentioned in
[12:26] the book of Ezra it says says this then
[12:28] the prophet Hagi
[12:30] and Zachariah which we're going to get
[12:31] to the son of Ido prophets prophesied to
[12:36] the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem
[12:39] in the name of of in the name of the god
[12:42] of Israel who was over them so I'm going
[12:45] to be going back to this book of Ezra as
[12:49] we go through this book of Hagi because
[12:51] it's it's a very very important time so
[12:54] let's go to Hagi so we know that Hagi is
[12:57] prophesying at the same time time that
[12:59] Ezra is there and the people came
[13:02] out and um Hagi one verse one it's only
[13:05] two chap two chapters and so we'll read
[13:08] every word if time permits in the second
[13:10] year of daras the king in the sixth
[13:13] month in the first day of the month came
[13:16] the word of the Lord by Hagi the prophet
[13:20] priest unto zerubabel I like the way he
[13:22] calls him the prophet
[13:23] priest the prophet priest un zerubabel
[13:27] the son of shelo now remember Z rubel is
[13:29] the one that led them out of Babylon the
[13:32] son of shelo governor of Judah and to
[13:36] Joshua the son of jedc the high the the
[13:40] high so Joshua is the high priest saying
[13:44] thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying
[13:48] this
[13:49] people say the time is not come the time
[13:54] that the Lord's House should be
[13:56] built then came the word of the Lord by
[13:59] the prophet saying is it time for you oh
[14:02] ye that dwell to dwell in your sealed
[14:07] houses and this house lie waste what
[14:10] does that mean here's the whole thing
[14:15] behind the book of Hagi sealed houses
[14:18] that word doesn't exist today that's an
[14:20] Old English word from the King James
[14:23] it's it obviously exist existed a few
[14:27] hundred years ago but the new King James
[14:28] said says this in verse three then the
[14:31] word of the Lord came by the hand of
[14:32] haggi the Prophet is it time for you
[14:35] yourselves to dwell in your panel
[14:39] houses and this Temple to lie in
[14:43] Ruins so these panel houses these are
[14:46] the same panels that they were building
[14:48] the interior of their house with these
[14:50] are the same panels that were imported
[14:52] for Le Lebanon that were originally
[14:54] intended to finish the Temple of the
[14:57] Lord and
[14:59] now these people are using these Jews
[15:02] are using what was supposed to be for
[15:04] the temple they're using this to build
[15:07] their own
[15:08] houses verse four
[15:11] again is it time for you yourselves to
[15:14] dwell in your panel houses and this
[15:17] Temple to lie in
[15:18] Ruins now therefore thus sayeth the Lord
[15:21] of hosts consider your ways you have
[15:24] sown you have sown much and bring in
[15:27] little you
[15:29] eat but you have not enough you drink
[15:34] but you are not filled with drink you
[15:36] you clothe you but there is none warm
[15:39] and he that earns wages earnthenecklace
[15:59] but you're still thirsty you you wear
[16:01] clothes but you're still cold you earn
[16:04] wages but it's not enough to pay the
[16:07] bills it's like carrying a money bag
[16:11] that's got holes in it everything's just
[16:14] dropping out I know many of us have been
[16:16] through that or it's like wow I just
[16:18] can't get ahead I earn money and then I
[16:20] have bills and then I earn money and
[16:21] then I have bills and it just like
[16:24] what's going on you are not prospering
[16:30] ha GUI saying
[16:32] usually and we'll go back usually in the
[16:35] prophetic books like Jeremiah Ezekiel
[16:37] Joel
[16:38] Jonah the prophet just rips the people
[16:41] and tells them all their sins and tells
[16:43] them to repent but Hagi is a little
[16:47] different he's telling them basically
[16:50] that you didn't finish the
[16:53] job and the same for the
[16:56] Israelites zerubabel as I said he
[16:59] brought them out of Babylon by a decree
[17:00] from the Persian king Cyrus and then
[17:02] they started construction on the temple
[17:04] but some reason it for some reason it
[17:06] stopped and the temple was left
[17:09] unfinished for 16 years and then they
[17:12] start taking the the parts that were
[17:14] supposed to go in the temple and they
[17:15] start building their houses out out of
[17:17] it what's going on there's something
[17:19] behind this usually would just say oh
[17:21] it's just because idolatry crept in or
[17:23] or there there was something wrong but
[17:24] there is something behind all this I
[17:27] remember when I was a kid
[17:29] we wanted a swimming pool man that was
[17:32] like that was going to be it and dad
[17:35] said okay well we um we'll build a
[17:37] swimming pool so we did all the
[17:39] Landscaping in the backyard we built the
[17:41] wall dug the big hole and put all the
[17:44] gunite put the concrete in all the steps
[17:46] and everything and the pool was was
[17:48] right there ready and and and then Dad
[17:52] stopped building the
[17:55] pool and we had this concrete
[17:59] hole in our
[18:01] backyard for
[18:05] years I remember laying in bed and
[18:09] hearing the
[18:11] frogs in the pool because it would rain
[18:14] in the monsoon season and the pool would
[18:16] get like this water in it and somehow
[18:20] frogs got in there and they were making
[18:22] all these noise and you all night and I
[18:25] was just like man dad finish the pool
[18:28] you know we we want to get done but what
[18:30] had happened was Dad ran out of
[18:33] money and he couldn't finish it and we
[18:37] were we were embarrassed and the
[18:38] neighbors would laugh at us and and I'm
[18:41] surprised that fish didn't
[18:44] involve from the pool but eventually dad
[18:48] got the money and and plastered the pool
[18:51] and got all the plumbing and finished it
[18:54] and we look at sometimes things don't
[18:56] get finished there's always a reason for
[18:59] it and it was 16
[19:02] years that this Temple
[19:08] sat or the the just the foundation sat
[19:10] and nothing
[19:13] happened
[19:15] why we're going to find out that there's
[19:19] really two things at work here we're
[19:22] going to go to the Book of Malachi here
[19:24] in a couple weeks and we're going to see
[19:26] they that they aren't paying they
[19:28] weren't paying paying their ties they
[19:30] they weren't giving God their best
[19:32] sacrifices as we'll learn in Malachi
[19:34] they weren't being good husbands to
[19:36] their wives as we'll learn in the book
[19:37] of Mali Malachi they weren't giving
[19:39] their time to God as we will learn but
[19:42] there is another reason in Hagi why this
[19:47] um Temple was not being
[19:50] finished so let's remember I said this
[19:53] is during this time of Ezra so let's go
[19:57] back to the book of Ezra chapter
[20:00] 4 and let's read it now there is a new
[20:03] king at this time a new king it's not
[20:06] Babylon but it's
[20:07] Persia this man AR Xerxes and Cyrus was
[20:11] a friend of the of the um of the Jews so
[20:15] was dasas was a friend of the Jews but
[20:17] this Persian king AR of Xerxes he didn't
[20:19] have the background that they had he
[20:21] didn't know Daniel he didn't know all of
[20:24] these Great Men he wasn't familiar with
[20:27] the Jews he wasn't a aware of all the
[20:29] prophecies and all the good that they
[20:32] had done now let's let's start with
[20:34] verse U chapter 4 verse one I'm going to
[20:37] read I'm not a big fan of the NIV
[20:40] version of the Bible The New
[20:41] International Version um it's it's a bit
[20:44] of a summary but I'm going to read we
[20:46] can put the King James up there but I'm
[20:47] going to read the NIV because it's more
[20:49] of a um a
[20:51] summarized um take on it and it gives us
[20:54] the story a little bit better when the
[20:56] enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard
[20:58] heard that the Exiles were building a
[21:00] temple for the Lord the god of Israel
[21:02] they came to zerubabel to the heads of
[21:05] the families and said let us help you
[21:08] build because like you we seek your God
[21:13] and have been sacrificing to him since
[21:16] the time of ezer Adin the king of
[21:19] Assyria who brought us here but
[21:22] zerubabel and Joshua and the rest of the
[21:25] heads of the families of Israel answered
[21:28] they saw through this was a
[21:30] scheme and they saw through
[21:34] it they answered you have no part with
[21:37] us in building a temple to our God we
[21:40] alone will build it for the Lord the god
[21:43] of Israel as king Cyrus the King of
[21:46] Persia commanded
[21:48] us then the peoples around them set out
[21:51] to discourage the people of Judah and to
[21:55] make them afraid to go on building
[21:59] they bribed officials to work against
[22:02] them and frustrated and frustrate their
[22:04] plans during the entire reign of Cyrus
[22:07] King of Persia and down to the reign of
[22:09] dasas King of Persia the King James
[22:13] version says they hired
[22:16] counselors against them they hired
[22:20] lawyers against these people to try to
[22:23] get them to stop building this church
[22:28] let's go down to uh so the two the the
[22:32] two big problems here was this this guy
[22:34] named sand ballot and this other guy
[22:36] named tobah and they show up in Ezra the
[22:40] the chap chapter 2 and their problems
[22:42] for the rest of the time so they write a
[22:44] letter to King arz Xerxes and they
[22:47] presented their case and arz Xerxes gave
[22:52] his judgment and they brought a court
[22:55] order against these Jews to make them
[23:00] stop
[23:01] building so what happened let's skip to
[23:04] uh verse 17 in Ezra 4 the king sent this
[23:08] reply to ream commanding officer
[23:12] shimshai the secretary and the rest of
[23:14] their Associates living in samarra and
[23:16] elsewhere the trans Euphrates
[23:18] greetings the letter you sent us has
[23:21] been read and translated in my presence
[23:25] I issued an order and a search was made
[23:28] and it was found that this city has a
[23:30] long history of Revolt speaking of
[23:33] Jerusalem against Kings and has been
[23:35] placed of rebellion and Sedition
[23:38] Jerusalem has had powerful Kings ruling
[23:41] over the whole trans Euphrates and taxes
[23:44] tribute and Duty were paid to them now
[23:49] issue an order to these men to stop work
[23:53] so that this city will not be rebuilt
[23:56] until I so order
[23:58] be careful not to neglect this matter
[24:01] why let this threat go to the detriment
[24:04] of the royal
[24:06] interests as soon as the copy of the
[24:08] letter of King arz Xerxes was read to
[24:12] raham and shimshi the secretary and
[24:16] their associates they went immediately
[24:18] to the Jews in Jerusalem and they
[24:21] compelled them by forc to stop thus the
[24:25] work on the house of God in Jerusalem
[24:28] came to a
[24:30] standstill until the Reign until the
[24:33] year of the reign of dasas until the
[24:37] second year of the reign of dasas King
[24:39] of
[24:40] Persia so what they did is they sued
[24:43] them and then they started intimidating
[24:46] them and they they said that we're going
[24:48] to you're going to be thrown in jail or
[24:51] you're you're going to suffer and and
[24:53] then they not only did they they forced
[24:56] them through the law but they also
[24:58] troops against them so this was a hard
[25:01] time they might have published an
[25:03] article in the Arizona Daily Star trying
[25:05] to discourage them they might they might
[25:08] have they might have brought out corrupt
[25:11] pastors or they might have they might
[25:13] have shown a dominating
[25:15] church and they might have
[25:17] found many things wrong with these
[25:20] different different places and they
[25:22] brought these up and they sued them and
[25:25] they caused them to be discouraged
[25:29] and the people were discouraged so they
[25:31] said you know what I quit we're done
[25:34] we're just going to go our
[25:36] way and they take some of the stuff from
[25:39] the from from the the the um Temple and
[25:42] they start building their house with it
[25:44] houses with it and these poor people
[25:46] they were down they were
[25:52] discouraged and it says
[25:54] this verse number 24 again thus the work
[25:59] on the house of
[26:01] God which is at Jerusalem so it ceased
[26:05] unto the second year of the reign of
[26:09] dasas King of
[26:12] Persia very important so what happened
[26:14] in the second
[26:16] year of the reign of duras King of
[26:20] Persia that got things started again
[26:23] remember they were discouraged they they
[26:25] gave up 16 years passed it and and it
[26:27] when all the way to the second year of
[26:30] this
[26:31] manaras so what
[26:34] happened
[26:36] Hagi chapter 1 verse one this is
[26:42] awesome in the second year of dasas the
[26:47] king same as Ezra in the second year of
[26:51] dasas the king in the sixth month in the
[26:54] first day of the month came the word of
[26:56] the Lord by Hagi the prophet unto
[26:58] zerubabel the son of shtiel governor of
[27:02] Judah and to Joshua the son of jedc the
[27:05] high priest saying thus speaketh the
[27:08] Lord of hosts saying this people the
[27:11] time saying saying this people say the
[27:14] time is not come the time that the
[27:16] Lord's House should be
[27:18] built then came the word of the Lord by
[27:21] Hagi the prophet saying it is time for
[27:25] you oh ye to dwell in your sealed your

[34:41] of the Nile River to blood I'm the same
[34:43] God that brought all the plagues I am
[34:45] the same God that when you were we the
[34:48] the army of Egypt was coming at you and
[34:51] you had the the Red Sea behind you I'm
[34:54] the same God that parted both both sides
[34:57] and you walked across dry land I am the
[35:00] same God that did that I am the same God
[35:03] that's with you
[35:05] now I love that
[35:08] part that's
[35:10] encouraging fear ye
[35:13] not for thus sayeth the Lord of hosts
[35:17] yet once it is a little while and I will
[35:21] shake the heavens and the earth and the
[35:24] Sea and the dry land
[35:27] and I will shake All Nations and the
[35:29] desire of all Nations shall come and I
[35:32] will fill this house with house with

[35:41] of
[35:42] God for thus sayeth the Lord yet once it
[35:46] is a little while and I will shake the
[35:48] heavens and the earth and the Sea and
[35:50] the dry land and I will shake All
[35:53] Nations and the desire of all Nations
[35:55] shall come and I will fill this house
[35:57] that they're building I will fill it
[35:59] with Glory sayeth the Lord Lord of
[36:03] hosts saying I one day may not look like
[36:06] much now but one day I am going to bless
[36:12] this
[36:13] house the silver is
[36:15] mine the Gold is mine sayith the Lord of
[36:19] hosts the glory of this latter house
[36:21] shall be greater than the former the the
[36:24] glory of the new Temple will be greater
[36:27] than the glory of the old temple temple
[36:30] he's saying you old folks you remember
[36:31] how great it was he was even even
[36:32] greater than that when Solomon had it
[36:34] finished and the spirit of the Lord came
[36:37] in and filled it it's going to be even
[36:40] greater than
[36:45] that the glory of the latter house shall
[36:49] be greater than the former sayeth the
[36:50] Lord of hosts and in this place will I
[36:53] give peace peace sayeth the Lord of
[36:55] hosts now after encouraging them he gets
[36:59] them going he says I'm with you go build
[37:01] let's let's do this and here's Hagi he's
[37:03] prophesying he says okay it's been 16
[37:05] years all right I understand that you
[37:07] were discouraged I understand all these
[37:09] things happen but guess what it's going
[37:11] to be better than it was in the
[37:14] beginning now look at it now there is
[37:16] coming we look back at the day of
[37:18] Pentecost in the book of Acts where they
[37:20] all spoken in unknown tongues and they
[37:23] went out and they did all these Miracles
[37:25] it's going to be greater than that it's
[37:27] going to be greater than that because
[37:29] we're going to have so much faith that
[37:31] we are not just going to heal the sick
[37:33] so much faith is going to come down that
[37:36] we are just going to be like Enoch and
[37:40] we're just going to walk up with God
[37:41] show me greater Faith than that in the
[37:43] Bible Elijah went up in a chariot of
[37:46] fire Enoch walked up with God that's
[37:48] going to happen here the day of
[37:50] Pentecost was wonderful but it's going
[37:52] to be
[37:53] greater and he's saying here he's saying
[37:56] that this new Temple that is going to be
[37:57] built it's going to be greater than it
[38:00] was
[38:03] before wow in the fourth and 20th
[38:09] day of the ninth month in the second
[38:11] year of daras came the word of the Lord
[38:13] by Hagi the prophet saying thus sayeth
[38:15] the Lord of hosts ask now the priest
[38:18] concerning the law saying okay listen so
[38:21] when we have a good
[38:22] service it's not
[38:25] all you're great
[38:28] it's not all things are going to be
[38:30] better it's not all what I just said
[38:34] that the faith is going to increase so
[38:36] much that we're going to be raptured
[38:38] that is going to happen but there is
[38:40] also
[38:42] correction that comes along with
[38:45] it a real believer loves
[38:49] correction we love to be like Lord I am
[38:53] falling short what is it about that
[38:54] repentance that feels so good when you
[38:58] just when something's said or a
[39:00] scripture's read or or or a song's read
[39:03] sang and you just like Lord I'm so sorry
[39:07] I feel so bad but it feels good when
[39:12] something like that happens to you and
[39:14] here the prophet he's going to bring
[39:17] some
[39:20] correction and now the priest concerning
[39:22] the law thus sayith the Lord of hosts
[39:26] ask now the priest concerning the law
[39:28] saying if one bear holy flesh in the
[39:32] skirt of His Garment and with his skirt
[39:34] touch bread or pottage or wine or oil or
[39:37] any meat shall it be
[39:40] holy and the priest answered and said no
[39:44] the priests knew the Book of Leviticus
[39:46] they know that if you touch a dead body
[39:50] now you're unclean and you have to you
[39:52] have to go through all the rituals to
[39:54] get clean and if you touch something
[39:57] that's unclean now you're unclean and if
[40:01] you touch somebody else then they become
[40:04] unclean or whatever they touch becomes
[40:07] unclean so they knew they knew the
[40:10] teachings of Moses they knew what this
[40:14] was and they said no that is not
[40:21] clean verse
[40:23] um verse number 13 then said Hagi if one
[40:27] that is unclean by a dead body touch any
[40:30] of these shall it be unclean and the
[40:32] priest answered and said yeah it shall
[40:35] be
[40:36] unclean then answered Hagi and said so
[40:40] is this
[40:42] people and so is this nation before me
[40:45] sayeth the Lord and so is every work of
[40:48] their minds that and that which they
[40:51] offer there is unclean now he's offering
[40:54] this rebuke as an encouragement
[40:57] and he's saying that listen if you are
[40:59] going to live an unclean life and you're
[41:02] going to go build this Temple the
[41:04] Temple's going to be
[41:06] unclean if you are going to go try to
[41:09] preach a sermon and you're living a
[41:11] sinful life your sermon is going to be
[41:14] unclean if you're are going to try to
[41:16] help someone else and you are living an
[41:19] unclean life it is going to be a tainted
[41:23] blessing to that person you are going to
[41:25] pass on that uncleanness
[41:28] and he's saying now listen you all if
[41:30] you are unclean and you're trying to
[41:32] build this Temple it'll make the temple
[41:35] unclean so live
[41:37] right and now I
[41:40] pray now I pray you consider from this
[41:43] day and upward and from and from before
[41:47] A Stone was laid upon the stone in the
[41:49] temple of the Lord since those days were
[41:52] when one came to a heap of 20 measures
[41:56] there were but 10 when one came to the
[41:59] Press fat for to draw out 50 vessels out
[42:02] of the press there were but 20 I smoked
[42:05] you with blasting and with mildew and
[42:08] with hail and with and in all labors of
[42:10] your hands yet you turned not to me
[42:15] sayeth the
[42:16] Lord so remember what he said at the
[42:20] beginning he said you work and you don't
[42:23] have
[42:24] enough he said you grow crops and they
[42:27] don't bear he said he said you you eat
[42:31] but but you're still hungry you drink
[42:32] but you're still
[42:34] thirsty so consider these
[42:39] things verse number
[42:41] 18 consider now from this day and upward
[42:45] from the 4 and 20th day of the ninth
[42:48] month even from the day that the
[42:49] foundation of the Lord's Temple was laid
[42:52] consider it is the seed yet in the barn
[42:56] y as as yet the vine and the Fig Tree
[43:00] and the pomegranate and the Olive Tree
[43:02] hath not brought forth from this day not
[43:05] brought forth from this day will I bless
[43:08] you and again the word of the Lord came
[43:11] to Hagi in the 4 and 20th day of the
[43:13] month saying now he's going to give his
[43:16] last prophecy and
[43:18] this was one of those things that was
[43:22] probably
[43:24] a mystery to the people that he was
[43:27] speaking
[43:31] to speak to
[43:33] zerubabel the governor of Judah now
[43:36] remember zerubabel was from the from the
[43:39] tribe of
[43:41] Judah it's important here saying I will
[43:44] shake the heavens and the
[43:46] Earth and I will overflow the Throne of
[43:49] the king of Kingdoms and I will destroy
[43:52] the strength of the kingdoms of the
[43:53] Heathen and I will overthrow flow the
[43:56] overthrow the chariots and those that
[43:59] ride in them and the horses and their
[44:01] Riders shall come down Everyone by the
[44:04] sword of his brother in that day sayeth
[44:07] the Lord of
[44:08] hosts will I take thee Oh
[44:13] zerubabel my
[44:15] servant the son of shtiel sayeth the
[44:18] Lord and will make thee as a signant for
[44:22] I have chosen thee say saith the Lord of
[44:30] hosts so it seems very much like wow
[44:34] this is the
[44:36] Messiah this guy zerubabel looks like he
[44:39] is going to be the king he looks like
[44:42] he's going to be this son of David
[44:44] that's to come that's going to liberate
[44:46] Judah and to restore this Kingdom
[44:49] through Power and through Wars and and
[44:52] and to conquer so the people probably
[44:56] had a question in their mind I is the
[44:59] prophet talking about this
[45:00] rubel he
[45:03] wasn't he was talking about
[45:06] another lion from the tribe of Judah he
[45:10] was talking about another son of David
[45:12] that was to
[45:13] come but this zerubabel
[45:17] here is the one that brought them out
[45:21] and it's a beautiful type of Jesus
[45:24] Christ how he brings people out of
[45:29] sin
[45:31] and we exalt him the musicians can come
[45:35] and we'll
[45:36] close the book of
[45:39] Hagi is
[45:41] [Music]
[45:42] tremendous it's it's there it's saying
[45:45] that listen you have wasted time you
[45:48] have you have taken the the things of
[45:50] the Lord and you have used them for your
[45:52] own benefit you haven't you haven't done
[45:55] right you haven't and we're going to
[45:57] hear from The Book of Malachi in all the
[45:59] things that they haven't
[46:02] done but in Hagi he's saying but it's
[46:05] okay from now on do it and let's build
[46:09] this Temple and let's get this work done
[46:13] tremendous tremendously
[46:16] encouraging book two
[46:19] chapters action packed brother Josiah do
[46:24] you have a song for us
