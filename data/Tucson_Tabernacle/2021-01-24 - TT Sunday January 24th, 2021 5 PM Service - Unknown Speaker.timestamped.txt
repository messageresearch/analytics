[47:17] i trust if we just continue on with our
[47:20] thought from this morning
[47:21] just a few more things here on my heart
[47:23] i'd like to share with you joshua 24
[47:26] and verse number 14. the bible here says
[47:30] now therefore fear the lord and serve
[47:33] him
[47:34] in sincerity notice your way also says
[47:38] and in truth so not just in sincerity
[47:42] but in sincerity and in truth and put
[47:45] away the gods which your father
[47:47] served on the other side of the flood
[47:49] and in egypt
[47:51] and serve ye the lord and if it seems
[47:54] evil unto you to serve the lord
[47:56] then choose you this day whom you will
[47:58] serve
[47:59] whether the gods which your father
[48:01] served that were on the other side of
[48:03] the flood
[48:04] or the gods of the amorites and whose
[48:06] land you dwell
[48:08] let's read this together but as
[48:11] for me and my house we will
[48:14] serve the lord as for me and my house we
[48:18] will serve
[48:19] the lord i also want to look again with
[48:21] you in the book of john
[48:22] the 9th chapter we read this morning
[48:25] from the 26th
[48:26] verse up to about the 35th verse but if
[48:28] we can i'd like to just back up there a
[48:30] few verses
[48:31] maybe to the 20th verse this evening and
[48:34] we'll try to
[48:35] try to get this in tonight in john 9
[48:39] and verse 20 as we said this morning the
[48:42] lord has just healed
[48:44] this boy that was born blind and now
[48:45] there's a great stir confusion whatever
[48:47] you want to call
[48:48] the in the community or in the the area
[48:50] there
[48:51] and he's going to have to take sides hey
[48:53] man and here in the 20th verse it says
[48:55] here's
[48:56] his parents answered them and said we
[48:58] know that this is our son and that he
[49:00] was born blind
[49:01] but by what means he now seeth we know
[49:04] not
[49:05] or who hath opened his eyes we know not
[49:07] he is of age
[49:08] ask him he shall speak for himself
[49:12] so his parents is one side then the lord
[49:15] jesus is the other side and now this
[49:17] young boy is in the middle
[49:18] he's the he's the deciding factor he's
[49:20] the choosing here
[49:22] notice here in the 22nd verse these
[49:24] words spake his parents because they
[49:26] fear the jews
[49:28] for the jews that agreed already that if
[49:30] any man did not confess that he was
[49:32] christ he should be put out of the
[49:33] synagogue
[49:34] therefore said his parents he is of age
[49:36] ask him then again they called the man
[49:38] that was blind and said unto him give
[49:40] god the praise we know that this man is
[49:41] a sinner
[49:43] he answered and said whether he be a
[49:45] sinner or no i know not
[49:48] but one thing i know i love this one
[49:50] thing i know
[49:51] that whereas i was blind now
[49:55] i see whereas i was blind
[49:58] now i see let's bow our hearts together
[50:01] this evening heavenly father
[50:03] lord your word is true tonight and lord
[50:06] what an honor and a privilege it is just
[50:07] to be able to read your word
[50:10] lord just to be able to look in the
[50:11] scriptures tonight and know that we're
[50:12] not reading as we said
[50:14] through the glasses of denomination
[50:16] through the glasses of tradition
[50:18] through the glasses of some man's
[50:20] opinion the lord we are reading this
[50:22] bible tonight through prophetic glasses
[50:24] lord that you've allowed a prophet to
[50:26] come in this generation and to interpret
[50:28] what we're reading
[50:29] so father i pray tonight you would come
[50:31] speak to our hearts
[50:32] change our lives by your word anoint us
[50:34] afresh tonight god
[50:35] lord help me to get myself out of the
[50:37] way lord move me aside that your people
[50:40] could receive
[50:41] from the gift that you've placed on the
[50:42] inside of my life lord may you not just
[50:45] move me aside to minister
[50:47] but lord may you move the people aside
[50:50] as well to pull and to receive
[50:52] and lord whatever is accomplished in
[50:53] this meeting we'll be sure to give you
[50:55] all the praise
[50:56] all the honor and all the glory for it's
[50:58] in the wonderful name of our lord and
[51:00] our savior
[51:01] jesus christ we pray and all the
[51:03] believers said
[51:05] amen god bless you this evening as you
[51:08] you have your seats there
[51:09] for just a few moments
[51:12] you love the lord amen
[51:15] from those scriptures again this evening
[51:17] i'd like to if i can
[51:19] to minister to you and maybe just
[51:20] continue on with the same title
[51:22] of taking sides with the supernatural
[51:25] taking
[51:26] sides with the supernatural and as we
[51:28] were
[51:29] maybe just to lay a foundation for some
[51:31] that wasn't here this morning
[51:32] the bible here was re-reading about
[51:35] taking sides
[51:36] and the prophet of god tells us that
[51:37] you're either against god
[51:39] or you're for god you're either against
[51:41] god or you're for god and brother brahma
[51:43] says
[51:43] actually how in this day and time that
[51:46] we take
[51:46] sides is not necessarily by maybe the
[51:49] clothes we wear
[51:50] the pictures we have the tire but the
[51:52] way we take sides
[51:54] is by believing his word now as we were
[51:56] looking here as the word supernatural
[51:58] actually means
[51:59] it means of a manifestation or an event
[52:01] attributed to some force
[52:03] that goes beyond scientific
[52:05] understanding or the laws of nature
[52:08] manifestations or events considered to
[52:10] be of supernatural origin
[52:12] such as ghosts and we agreed this
[52:14] morning we're not following any kind of
[52:16] ghosts but we're following the holy
[52:18] ghost and he is a supernatural spirit
[52:20] now
[52:21] maybe where we left off this morning we
[52:22] were speaking on the difference
[52:24] in supernatural and superstition how
[52:26] many how many knows there's a difference
[52:29] the definition of superstition means a
[52:32] widely held but unjustified belief in
[52:34] supernatural
[52:36] causation leading to a certain
[52:37] consequence of an
[52:39] action or event it's a practice that's
[52:41] based on such a belief now
[52:43] if you if you look there another word
[52:45] for the word superstition is
[52:46] idolatry which is uh the worship of
[52:50] anything
[52:51] outside of the lord jesus christ now we
[52:53] find that many people today
[52:54] they worship they worship the church
[52:56] they worship the preacher they worship
[52:58] this
[52:58] even around the message you'll find some
[53:00] that worship amen the prophet but that's
[53:02] not what god has called us to do
[53:04] he's called us to believe his word amen
[53:07] and to cast down every idol that stands
[53:09] between you
[53:10] and the living god now jeremiah the 10th
[53:12] chapter in the second verse the bible
[53:14] there says thus saith the lord
[53:15] learn not the way of the heathen and be
[53:17] not dismayed
[53:19] at the signs of the heaven for the
[53:21] heathen are dismayed at them now
[53:22] the prophet said again god approaches
[53:24] his people by signs and wonders
[53:26] therefore the word heathen is actually
[53:28] interpreted by
[53:29] the interpretation is unbeliever now he
[53:31] said see
[53:32] the learn not the way of the heathen or
[53:34] learn not the way of the unbeliever stay
[53:35] away from him see
[53:37] don't fellowship with it at all he's an
[53:38] unbeliever let him be marked an
[53:40] unbeliever can light in darkness exist
[53:42] at the same time
[53:43] can it be dark when the sun is shining
[53:45] never
[53:46] right he said which is the most powerful
[53:49] can dark put out the sun no sir
[53:51] the sun puts out the darkness see light
[53:55] y'all forgive me a voice is a little
[53:57] weak tonight
[53:58] that's right he says and wrong so wrong
[54:01] can never exist in the state of truth
[54:03] and neither can a lie exist in the face
[54:07] of the truth think of that
[54:08] wrong can never exist in the face of the
[54:11] truth
[54:11] neither can a lie exist in the face of
[54:14] the truth now the truth is always the
[54:16] same
[54:16] it meant a lie actually twist around but
[54:19] it's still a lie so the truth remains
[54:22] the same
[54:23] but a lie is twisted to something else
[54:26] now
[54:27] in the messenger sign of his coming
[54:31] he said it's just like taking a wire
[54:33] connecting it with a dynamo where
[54:34] there's no current
[54:35] taking a wire and sticking it in a
[54:36] socket he said there's no currency it's
[54:38] the difference it's just a dead wire
[54:42] no matter how much sockets in there if
[54:44] there's no current in there it's still a
[54:46] dead wire and as long as we're trying to
[54:47] connect it with something
[54:49] that hasn't got any life in it or any
[54:51] truth in it it'll still be a dead
[54:53] thunder with no lightning in it that's
[54:55] right
[54:55] he said unbelievers amen have no life in
[54:58] them to believe with how many
[55:00] knows tonight that an unbeliever is
[55:02] actually a dead current it's
[55:04] there's nothing there that when the
[55:05] supernatural comes
[55:07] to connect with it and believe now amen
[55:09] i'm going to preach amen the devil come
[55:11] out of my throat but this ain't the
[55:12] first time we've been through this so
[55:14] we'll get through it again
[55:15] amen but the scoffers are actually
[55:17] unbelievers right
[55:18] amen the scoffers are unbelievers and
[55:20] the prophet said what they're trying to
[55:22] do
[55:22] is they're trying to discourage the
[55:24] believer
[55:27] they're trying to discourage the
[55:29] believer now in second peter chapter 3
[55:30] verse 4
[55:31] the bible says where is the promise of
[55:34] his coming you realize that's the
[55:35] question they're even asking today
[55:38] is where is the promise of his coming
[55:40] for since the fathers fell asleep
[55:42] he says all things continue as they were
[55:45] from the beginning of
[55:46] the creation now in the mat the message
[55:49] the rapture i just want to read this
[55:50] because it'll
[55:51] it'll it'll maybe get your mind thinking
[55:52] in this direction he said look as he
[55:54] just blacked out the pope just come over
[55:56] here remember the tabernacle got taped
[55:59] he says i guess you all got them he said
[56:01] how the lord showed that that day in the
[56:02] tabernacle exactly the church ages would
[56:04] be where they would be
[56:06] had them drawn out on the board up here
[56:08] he said and if the holy spirit didn't
[56:10] come down in a big pillar of fire
[56:12] and went right back there on the wall
[56:14] and drawed them out himself he said well
[56:16] three or four hundred people sitting
[56:18] there looking at it
[56:19] and just as the pope started over here
[56:22] he said the moon somehow blackened out
[56:24] and they took their pictures the same
[56:25] way that was drawn up there on the
[56:26] platform
[56:27] he said now he's made a trip on the 13th
[56:29] walk 13 steps serve communion to 13
[56:32] to a nation that's number 13. he said
[56:35] see blackout's coming everywhere don't
[56:36] you see where we're at
[56:38] we are at the end time don't you see
[56:40] we're at we're at the end time so when
[56:42] we come to the end time
[56:43] then is the time you're going to see
[56:45] scoffers rise in the last days
[56:48] saying there's no difference in the time
[56:50] than it what it was
[56:51] than when our fathers fell asleep
[56:54] but when you see these things begin to
[56:56] happen then raise up your
[56:58] head and get ready ain't then something
[57:00] could happen at any time
[57:02] he said christ come for his church so
[57:05] when the unbelievers are becoming
[57:07] discouraged
[57:08] by the signs of the heaven by the signs
[57:10] of the earth by the signs of the time
[57:12] when the unbelievers are becoming
[57:14] discouraged that's the time
[57:16] that the believers are becoming
[57:18] encouraged by this time
[57:19] amen the same signs that are
[57:21] discouraging the unbeliever
[57:22] the prophet said that word dismayed
[57:24] comes from the word discouraged the
[57:25] unbeliever is discouraged
[57:27] he said what with the signs of heaven he
[57:30] said it just makes the unbeliever just
[57:32] pout and angry
[57:33] he said when you speak about signs and
[57:34] wonders they don't believe it
[57:36] amen so don't learn their ways stay away
[57:38] from them
[57:39] amen you learn the word and you stay
[57:41] with the word for the word
[57:43] is truth amen now see the signs from
[57:46] heaven are actually
[57:47] he meant the believer's encouragement
[57:49] now the prophet said this way
[57:50] it encourages the believer why because
[57:53] he believes the word
[57:55] it encourages the believer in the
[57:57] scriptural truth
[57:58] and then if we can show you here in the
[57:59] scripture that this generation will see
[58:02] the coming of the lord but you say are
[58:03] you sure that
[58:04] well just look to see what the signs
[58:06] point to see how close we are
[58:08] if the signpost says you're nearing just
[58:11] a few miles away you better get ready
[58:13] because it may be just a few hours so
[58:16] when you begin to see the signs
[58:18] amen pointing to the destination that's
[58:21] not the time to fall away
[58:24] that's not the time to grow cold amen
[58:26] that's the time
[58:28] to get ready for the coming of the lord
[58:30] is at hand amen then to think tonight
[58:32] amen that we have not come here under
[58:34] superstition signs
[58:36] amen but we have come here under
[58:37] supernatural signs as the prophet said
[58:39] light and darkness cannot exist at the
[58:41] same time
[58:42] he said therefore one of one has got to
[58:44] give way to the other see either the
[58:46] light
[58:47] is going to give away to the darkness or
[58:49] the darkness is going to give way to the
[58:50] light
[58:51] he said see that's what happened up
[58:52] there the other day on superstition
[58:54] mountain
[58:54] we were sitting out there i'd heard it
[58:56] for a long time heard how many legends
[58:58] had been told about the superstition
[59:00] i remember looking at it the first time
[59:01] it was before day and a great ghosty
[59:04] shadow hung at the east of me which was
[59:05] known as the superstition
[59:07] heard about the indians how they
[59:08] wouldn't go near it how they were afraid
[59:10] the spanish mistreated them
[59:12] he said they claimed that evil spirits
[59:13] lived in it amen and all this stirred my
[59:16] curiosity
[59:17] amen but i only had a flashlight to see
[59:20] superstition first he said see and then
[59:22] i watched until after a while the
[59:23] majesty of the sun somebody shout the
[59:26] majesty of the sun
[59:28] begin to move upon the darkness see all
[59:31] he had was a flashlight
[59:33] but when the majesty of the sun began to
[59:35] move upon the darkness
[59:37] when it did it separated amen the
[59:39] darkness from the light
[59:41] he meant when the majesty of the sun
[59:43] began to move
[59:44] he meant it separated the darkness from
[59:46] the line he said and it pressed the
[59:48] darkness back
[59:49] and finally she raised her highness up
[59:52] over the top of the mountain
[59:53] and it showed superstition what it was
[59:55] it lit up and showed what it was and all
[59:57] the spooks and fears that i had of the
[1:00:00] superstition when the sun was shining
[1:00:02] in its power all of that fled away amen
[1:00:05] see so what happened was a prophet could
[1:00:07] only see
[1:00:08] amen so much of superstition amen by a
[1:00:11] flashlight
[1:00:12] he meant but when a prophet got the sign
[1:00:14] amen it revealed there was nothing to it
[1:00:16] amen and you catch there amen a prophet
[1:00:19] says when the sun
[1:00:20] began to rise amen superstition began to
[1:00:23] go back
[1:00:24] amen and reality of what it was begin to
[1:00:26] come into plain view
[1:00:28] amen now fake it not strange that a
[1:00:30] prophet preached the message
[1:00:31] it is amen the rising of the sun
[1:00:34] amen what was the rise of the sun for
[1:00:37] amen to drive back the darkness
[1:00:39] amen that was hanging over the church
[1:00:41] that was hanging over the bible
[1:00:43] that was hanging over the word and let
[1:00:45] you see amen that the word of god
[1:00:47] amen it's not denominational fanaticisms
[1:00:50] amen it is not
[1:00:51] traditions it is the word made manifest
[1:00:54] amen it separates the light from the
[1:00:57] darkness
[1:00:58] see when the king light of the bible
[1:01:00] raises up
[1:01:01] all the superstitions and things we know
[1:01:04] it's a vindicated proves this lie
[1:01:06] he said when you see that then you have
[1:01:08] no more room to argue
[1:01:10] superstition is now gone amen when you
[1:01:12] see the light
[1:01:13] when you see the word there's no more
[1:01:15] room to argue superstition
[1:01:18] is now gone and supernatural has come on
[1:01:20] the scene amen see so therefore the
[1:01:22] unbeliever is discouraged
[1:01:24] amen but the believer is encouraged amen
[1:01:26] now let me just take a moment here and
[1:01:27] preach you for a second
[1:01:29] amen because sometimes amen we let
[1:01:31] things we go through
[1:01:32] amen take our joy away and we become
[1:01:35] amen the discouraged
[1:01:37] when we should be the encouraged we
[1:01:39] become the down
[1:01:40] when we should be the up we become the
[1:01:43] we we become the broken
[1:01:44] when we should be amen the healed are
[1:01:46] you following me tonight
[1:01:48] amen see tonight church is not the hour
[1:01:50] for the bride to be discouraged
[1:01:53] this is the hour for the bride to be
[1:01:54] encouraged amen seek the spirit of the
[1:01:57] unbeliever
[1:01:58] it always cries out amen with
[1:02:00] discouragement
[1:02:01] it always cries out with a question you
[1:02:03] look there in matthew 21 verse 10
[1:02:05] and when he was coming to jerusalem all
[1:02:07] the city was moved amen
[1:02:08] saying who is this right and then this
[1:02:12] is in the bible
[1:02:13] saying who is this and the preachers of
[1:02:16] that day
[1:02:17] had to give an account for this stir
[1:02:19] because it was the feast of the passover
[1:02:22] and they screamed out who is this when
[1:02:24] the heir was charged
[1:02:26] he said the coming of the lord jesus to
[1:02:28] jerusalem
[1:02:29] had charged the air with expectations it
[1:02:32] looked like the teachers ought to know
[1:02:33] what was going to take place
[1:02:35] it looked like that the high priest
[1:02:37] would have known it it looked like all
[1:02:38] the other priests would have known it
[1:02:40] amen and it isn't changed any today
[1:02:42] because the holy spirit is forerunning
[1:02:45] amen the coming of the lord jesus and as
[1:02:48] the holy spirit begins to stretch out
[1:02:50] he meant across the earth revival fires
[1:02:53] are broken out everywhere
[1:02:55] great signs and wonders are being done
[1:02:57] he said prophecies have gone forth
[1:02:59] and all the gathering of the apostolic
[1:03:01] blessing just come back to the church
[1:03:03] again
[1:03:04] he said the spirit of the unbeliever
[1:03:06] still cries out
[1:03:08] amen who is this amen they can see the
[1:03:10] signs
[1:03:11] they can see the wonders they can see
[1:03:13] the prophecies they can see all these
[1:03:15] things
[1:03:16] lining up but because they're
[1:03:17] discouraged by these things
[1:03:19] and then they cry out and say who is
[1:03:21] this amen can i say it like this
[1:03:23] when the spirit of the believer cries
[1:03:25] out they come
[1:03:26] of the unbeliever amen cries out a
[1:03:29] question then
[1:03:30] the spirit of the believer amen cries
[1:03:32] out an answer
[1:03:33] amen they say who is this and the
[1:03:36] believer says
[1:03:37] it's jesus christ amen the same
[1:03:39] yesterday
[1:03:40] today and forever amen see now what
[1:03:43] we've got to do then
[1:03:44] is we've got to get all the spooks out
[1:03:47] amen right we've got to get all the
[1:03:49] spooks out amen and create an atmosphere
[1:03:52] amen for the supernatural to come into
[1:03:54] amen see we've got to let the light of
[1:03:56] god's word drive back
[1:03:57] all the darkness brought back all the
[1:03:59] fears and let the light of god's word
[1:04:01] come in the church
[1:04:02] in first kings 8 verse 10 it came to
[1:04:05] pass when the priests were come out of
[1:04:06] the holy place
[1:04:07] that the cloud filled the house so that
[1:04:09] the great priest could not stand the
[1:04:11] minister
[1:04:12] because of the cloud for the glory of
[1:04:15] the lord
[1:04:16] had filled the house amen notice here
[1:04:18] the atmosphere then
[1:04:19] is what brings the results amen it's the
[1:04:22] attitude of the people
[1:04:24] that brings the results that's the
[1:04:26] reason that pentecostal had to go into
[1:04:27] an upper room
[1:04:28] and pray until the holy ghost came
[1:04:31] because they got in one place
[1:04:33] and one accord it's the atmosphere is
[1:04:36] what brings the results
[1:04:37] let every man and woman in this building
[1:04:39] this morning boy girl at everything
[1:04:42] amen get out of your minds but the lord
[1:04:44] jesus and believe that he's standing
[1:04:46] amen present now and you'll see
[1:04:48] something happening
[1:04:49] that'll cause headlines in the newspaper
[1:04:52] in the morning
[1:04:54] that's right it's the atmosphere it's
[1:04:56] the atmosphere that brings the
[1:04:58] miraculous
[1:04:59] and wonders and powers of god among the
[1:05:01] people
[1:05:02] see so when you get the atmosphere you
[1:05:04] get the people in the atmosphere
[1:05:06] amen of worship and believing that all
[1:05:09] things are possible
[1:05:10] now watch this here the desire the end
[1:05:12] of a divine life
[1:05:13] is to stay in the atmosphere of the
[1:05:16] supernatural
[1:05:17] look at what david said in psalms 27 4
[1:05:20] he said one thing have a desire to the
[1:05:22] lord
[1:05:22] that will i seek after that i may dwell
[1:05:25] in the house of the lord
[1:05:26] all the days of my life to behold the
[1:05:29] beauty of the lord
[1:05:30] and to inquire in his temple he said see
[1:05:32] that's the reason
[1:05:33] sometimes that a divine life has been
[1:05:36] called and set aside
[1:05:37] has become a fanatic or crazy he said to
[1:05:40] the eyes of the general public
[1:05:42] it's because you're considered a
[1:05:43] neurotic or an insane person
[1:05:45] he said but what's happened is you've
[1:05:47] changed amen your dwelling place and
[1:05:50] you've got
[1:05:50] into a different atmosphere and your own
[1:05:53] motive your own thoughts is to stand
[1:05:54] that atmosphere
[1:05:55] and any person that ever comes in that
[1:05:58] atmosphere
[1:05:59] one time will never be satisfied amen
[1:06:02] nowhere else
[1:06:03] that's why i believe we should have our
[1:06:04] churches under the control of the holy
[1:06:07] ghost
[1:06:08] that men and women in their work
[1:06:10] wherever they should be
[1:06:11] should continually desire and they will
[1:06:14] if they ever come
[1:06:15] into that atmosphere one time amen if
[1:06:18] you ever get in the atmosphere
[1:06:20] amen of a good old-fashioned amen holy
[1:06:22] ghost revival atmosphere
[1:06:24] amen a cold church service won't satisfy
[1:06:26] you if you ever
[1:06:28] taste of the blessings of god amen then
[1:06:30] the curses of the devil
[1:06:32] amen will never satisfy are you hearing
[1:06:34] me when you ever break through
[1:06:36] and get into an atmosphere amen
[1:06:38] something is going to change
[1:06:40] amen see the body of christ amen cannot
[1:06:43] live
[1:06:43] in a natural atmosphere they've got to
[1:06:46] be in a
[1:06:46] supernatural atmosphere why because the
[1:06:49] body of christ
[1:06:51] is a supernatural body
[1:06:54] right in first corinthians 12 12 for as
[1:06:57] the body is one
[1:06:58] and has many members and all the members
[1:07:00] of that one body being many are one body
[1:07:02] also also as christ
[1:07:04] amen for by one spirit are we all
[1:07:06] baptized into one body
[1:07:08] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[1:07:11] we be bond or free
[1:07:12] and have been made all to drink of one
[1:07:14] spirit he said the world is again
[1:07:16] falling apart
[1:07:17] the church is ready she is sealed in
[1:07:19] she's ready to come
[1:07:20] he said there will be a big outpouring
[1:07:23] of the spirit yes sir
[1:07:24] to grab the church and take her in the
[1:07:26] skies
[1:07:27] amen because see the church and the word
[1:07:30] and the bride in christ
[1:07:31] his ministry is in his bride amen which
[1:07:34] is his body
[1:07:35] he said the supernatural body of the of
[1:07:38] of his here on the spiritual body on
[1:07:41] earth
[1:07:41] his spirit is in there living his life
[1:07:44] right out
[1:07:45] until him and the church becomes one see
[1:07:48] that's we're at tonight amen is the body
[1:07:51] has moved out of a natural atmosphere
[1:07:53] has moved out of a superstitious
[1:07:55] atmosphere into a supernatural
[1:07:57] atmosphere
[1:07:58] and we have become one with christ
[1:08:01] now it's amazing when you begin to look
[1:08:03] amen i'm not going to get very deep in
[1:08:05] this
[1:08:05] but it's amazing when you begin to look
[1:08:07] at the natural body and all the
[1:08:08] functions of a natural body
[1:08:10] you'll find many times amen that there's
[1:08:12] that same type in the spiritual body
[1:08:14] see like the natural body has a backbone
[1:08:16] do you realize without a backbone
[1:08:18] amen your natural body you couldn't even
[1:08:20] stand up you couldn't move
[1:08:22] you couldn't function you wouldn't know
[1:08:24] what to do amen see
[1:08:25] so the spiritual body has got to have a
[1:08:28] backbone as well
[1:08:29] he meant now the backbone of the
[1:08:30] supernatural body amen
[1:08:32] is those divinely revealed mystery
[1:08:35] truths
[1:08:36] in saint matthew chapter 13 verse 10 and
[1:08:39] the disciples came and said unto him
[1:08:41] why speakest thou unto them in parables
[1:08:43] and he answered and said to them because
[1:08:45] it is given unto you which is his
[1:08:48] disciples
[1:08:49] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:08:50] heaven but to them it is not given
[1:08:53] he said see then what is a mystery a
[1:08:55] mystery is a previously
[1:08:58] amen hidden truth now divinely revealed
[1:09:01] which is but yet the supernatural
[1:09:03] element still remains
[1:09:05] amen despite the revelation now amen i
[1:09:07] i'm not going to hold you along tonight
[1:09:09] but let me say it like this
[1:09:10] amen i think sometimes even we've only
[1:09:13] come so far with this message
[1:09:15] and we refuse to go any further there's
[1:09:17] some people that as far as they've come
[1:09:19] it's god sent a prophet and that's all
[1:09:21] they talk about that's all they see
[1:09:22] that's all they want to hear that's all
[1:09:24] they want to preach amen but if you're
[1:09:26] going to take a rapture
[1:09:27] you've got to see that there's more to
[1:09:29] this message amen than just the first
[1:09:31] pool
[1:09:31] there is more to this i can pull amen
[1:09:35] but a prophet says
[1:09:36] amen there is a third pool which is the
[1:09:39] opening of the word
[1:09:40] he meant the mysteries of the bible
[1:09:43] revealed
[1:09:44] in john 14 26 he said the comforter
[1:09:47] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[1:09:49] will send in my name
[1:09:50] he shall teach you amen all things and
[1:09:53] bring all thanks to your remembrance
[1:09:55] amen whatsoever i've said unto you now
[1:09:57] notice here in the brotherhood says this
[1:09:59] in the revelation of jesus christ you
[1:10:01] recall that i mentioned at the beginning
[1:10:03] of this message of this book we are
[1:10:04] studying is the actual
[1:10:05] revelation of jesus you believe that
[1:10:08] himself in the church and his work in
[1:10:11] the future ages
[1:10:12] then i mentioned that it takes the holy
[1:10:14] spirit amen to give us revelation or we
[1:10:17] will fail to get it
[1:10:18] now bringing these two thoughts together
[1:10:20] you will see that it won't just take
[1:10:22] even ordinary study and thinking to make
[1:10:25] this book real
[1:10:26] it's going to take the operation of the
[1:10:29] holy ghost
[1:10:30] amen so therefore the holy ghost was not
[1:10:32] just operating
[1:10:33] in the first pool he was not just
[1:10:35] operating in the second pool
[1:10:37] but the same holy ghost that operated in
[1:10:39] the first pool
[1:10:41] operated in the second pool is the same
[1:10:43] holy ghost
[1:10:44] that is here today operating in the
[1:10:46] third pool of a message ministry
[1:10:48] he said see bringing these two thoughts
[1:10:50] together it's going to take the holy
[1:10:52] ghost
[1:10:53] that means this book cannot be revealed
[1:10:56] to anyone but a special class of people
[1:10:58] it'll take one with prophetic inside
[1:11:00] it'll require the ability
[1:11:02] amen to hear from god brother aaron
[1:11:05] it'll require
[1:11:06] even supernatural instructions not just
[1:11:09] a student
[1:11:10] amen comparing verse with verse though
[1:11:12] that is good
[1:11:13] he meant but a mystery requires amen the
[1:11:16] teaching of the spirit
[1:11:18] or it will never become clear how we
[1:11:20] need to hear from god
[1:11:21] and lay ourselves open and become
[1:11:24] yielded to the spirit to hear
[1:11:26] and know amen so therefore the spirit of
[1:11:28] truth amen is coming in this last days
[1:11:30] now notice here amen some people make
[1:11:32] they think when you begin to preach the
[1:11:34] message and you begin to preach that
[1:11:35] amen that third paul you begin to preach
[1:11:37] they open the word you begin to preach
[1:11:39] the seals and you begin to go in those
[1:11:41] areas that a prophet laid out
[1:11:42] they think well you're going out there
[1:11:44] and there's no supernatural but a
[1:11:46] prophet there said
[1:11:47] amen those those mysteries are divinely
[1:11:49] revealed
[1:11:50] amen despite the supernatural element
[1:11:53] still remains
[1:11:56] is that what he said amen despite it now
[1:11:59] notice here
[1:11:59] then the spirit of truth is not going to
[1:12:02] come and teach you
[1:12:03] away from the supernatural but it's
[1:12:05] going to bring you to the recognition of
[1:12:08] the supernatural
[1:12:09] and by revelation you'll understand what
[1:12:11] you are seeing
[1:12:12] amen how many knows when you have a
[1:12:14] question it requires an answer
[1:12:16] amen if there's a question there's going
[1:12:17] to be an answer now notice here a
[1:12:19] natural question
[1:12:20] cannot be satisfied with a supernatural
[1:12:23] answer
[1:12:24] neither can a supernatural question amen
[1:12:27] be satisfied
[1:12:28] with a natural answer therefore and i'm
[1:12:30] not going to i'm not going to preach on
[1:12:32] this or relax but marriage and divorce
[1:12:34] amen the prophet god says it like this
[1:12:36] he said first corinthians the seventh
[1:12:37] chapter
[1:12:38] he said the new testament prophet paul
[1:12:40] then he goes on to moses where moses
[1:12:41] permitted and god recognized it
[1:12:43] righteous
[1:12:43] and paul also had a right when he filmed
[1:12:45] the church in that condition
[1:12:47] he said now you believe this to be true
[1:12:49] you believe it to come from god and by
[1:12:50] the vindication
[1:12:52] of this cloud and his message has
[1:12:53] brought me this far should not god upon
[1:12:55] this mountain permit me
[1:12:57] to do the same thing amen to suffer you
[1:13:00] to go on the way you are
[1:13:01] and do it no more go with your wives
[1:13:03] live in peacefully hours late
[1:13:05] the coming of the lord is at hand we
[1:13:06] haven't got time to break these things
[1:13:08] up
[1:13:09] don't you dare try it i'm speaking only
[1:13:10] to my congregation
[1:13:12] and god bore me witness on that mountain
[1:13:14] that i could say
[1:13:16] this is a supernatural revelation
[1:13:19] amen right here in the state of arizona
[1:13:22] amen there was another word
[1:13:23] prophet who went in the mountain are you
[1:13:26] following me tonight
[1:13:27] amen moses was separated and he went in
[1:13:29] the desert to receive the revelation
[1:13:31] amen paul was separated
[1:13:33] and he went in the dancer to receive the
[1:13:35] revelation and william branham was
[1:13:37] separated
[1:13:38] and he come in the desert to receive the
[1:13:40] revelation come on church
[1:13:41] amen we should not be sad tonight amen
[1:13:44] we should not be
[1:13:45] oh i'm going to preach or i'm going to
[1:13:46] bust amen we should not be so dry
[1:13:48] that you got to pump everybody up to say
[1:13:50] amen listen church we have received
[1:13:53] amen a divine supernatural revelation
[1:13:56] from jesus christ
[1:13:57] listen we are not here tonight hoping we
[1:14:00] are not here tonight probably
[1:14:02] we have come under amen the spirit of
[1:14:04] truth
[1:14:05] and his promise to restore amen all that
[1:14:08] has been lost to the church
[1:14:09] then to think tonight friends we are not
[1:14:11] the beneficiaries
[1:14:12] amen of a second hand revelation but the
[1:14:15] same god
[1:14:16] amen that met paul and delivered a
[1:14:18] firsthand revelation
[1:14:20] has come in this generation and
[1:14:21] delivered to the church
[1:14:23] he meant a supernatural answer amen to
[1:14:26] supernatural questions a supernatural
[1:14:28] understanding amen the things that were
[1:14:30] confused for years
[1:14:32] oh church we might as well ring the
[1:14:34] liberty pale tonight
[1:14:35] we might as well at least put one amen
[1:14:37] out and say we got the answer
[1:14:42] we've got the answer tonight by the
[1:14:45] supernatural
[1:14:47] when i think of that it absolutely blows
[1:14:49] my mind when you see
[1:14:51] amen the types when you see that this
[1:14:54] message is more
[1:14:55] than just the man behind the pulpit amen
[1:14:57] it's more than just 1100 tapes
[1:15:01] it's more than just stories it's more
[1:15:03] than just testimonies
[1:15:05] it is the fulfillment of the spirit
[1:15:07] himself
[1:15:08] teaching the church through the channel
[1:15:10] of a prophet
[1:15:11] now i'll say it like this i believe it's
[1:15:13] a blessing to be around the supernatural
[1:15:16] i believe it's a blessing to be under
[1:15:18] supernatural teaching
[1:15:19] amen the brother said now this here
[1:15:21] speaking of when jesus went there in the
[1:15:22] temple
[1:15:23] he went in there and spoke remember and
[1:15:24] they said what what manner of man is
[1:15:26] this
[1:15:27] he's astonished all these people he said
[1:15:29] now the supernatural is what blinds me
[1:15:32] isn't that something the same answer
[1:15:34] that opened your eyes blinded others the
[1:15:38] same message
[1:15:39] that give you understanding put other
[1:15:41] people in confusion
[1:15:43] now notice here it has in all ages but
[1:15:45] isn't it marvelous to think
[1:15:47] where the supernatural is demonstrated
[1:15:49] where the eagles are the carcasses
[1:15:51] rather
[1:15:51] and the eagles will be gathered through
[1:15:53] the age it has been that way
[1:15:54] men walk in slumber of life and they
[1:15:57] hear their teaching
[1:15:58] and their philosophies and so forth and
[1:16:00] that teach theologies but that still
[1:16:02] don't satisfy
[1:16:03] amen the human heart he said but when
[1:16:05] the supernatural comes into view
[1:16:07] like it in the days of our lord jesus
[1:16:09] when jesus came on the scene with his
[1:16:11] power
[1:16:12] and the manifestation of god the people
[1:16:14] flocked him to here
[1:16:15] because it's something in the realms
[1:16:18] beyond
[1:16:18] amen see it's something coming from the
[1:16:20] realms beyond
[1:16:21] into this realm and all men know that
[1:16:24] soon all education is god's
[1:16:26] and theology and so forth will rot in
[1:16:28] the grave we know that but where the
[1:16:29] supernatural
[1:16:30] is it pierces beyond the grave amen see
[1:16:34] the supernatural cannot be put in a
[1:16:36] grave it cannot be put behind the
[1:16:38] denominational stone
[1:16:39] it cannot be cut down by a roman tree
[1:16:42] amen the supernatural goes beyond
[1:16:45] he said but some believe him and those
[1:16:47] who believe was saved
[1:16:49] and those who believe could get healed
[1:16:51] but if jesus himself was standing here
[1:16:55] wearing my suit and my shoes he could
[1:16:58] not help you any more tonight
[1:16:59] than he can in the form of what he's
[1:17:01] doing now you know that the bible said
[1:17:03] the place he went into that
[1:17:04] that many works he could amen could not
[1:17:08] could not do because of their unbelief
[1:17:11] amen now notice here so the
[1:17:12] manifestation
[1:17:13] amen of the supernatural is going to
[1:17:16] cause people
[1:17:17] amen to take sights they may notice here
[1:17:19] when brother branham was going around
[1:17:21] amen healing the sick amen discerning
[1:17:23] the thoughts
[1:17:24] everybody was talking to the ministry
[1:17:25] but when that third pull came in
[1:17:27] operation
[1:17:28] when that opening the word began to take
[1:17:30] place when the seals began to come open
[1:17:32] amen when the thunders begin to sound
[1:17:35] amen then they begin to draw a line
[1:17:37] and say we'll go with healing and we'll
[1:17:39] go with discernment but we will not
[1:17:40] stand for these teachings
[1:17:42] amen but i'm so glad that there was an
[1:17:44] elected gene seed of god
[1:17:46] that said if he was right in the
[1:17:47] healings he'll be right in the
[1:17:49] discernments
[1:17:50] and if he was right in the discernments
[1:17:52] he is riding his doctor
[1:17:53] i'll tell you tonight that's one of the
[1:17:55] biggest compounds they've got right is
[1:17:57] you can follow him so
[1:17:58] far but what do they all say near the
[1:18:00] end he went off
[1:18:01] near the end he lost it near the end he
[1:18:03] began preaching strange things
[1:18:04] but it was not strange things it was the
[1:18:07] supernatural coming in the church
[1:18:09] and teaching the church beyond
[1:18:11] intellectual beyond
[1:18:13] education into the realities of christ
[1:18:16] amen i'll tell you tonight friends
[1:18:17] amen this message has been vindicated
[1:18:21] it has been manifested it has been
[1:18:23] proven
[1:18:24] it has been told it has been believed it
[1:18:27] has been over and over and over
[1:18:29] seen to defeat the devil anywhere
[1:18:32] anytime under any condition what are you
[1:18:35] saying i'm saying now's the time
[1:18:37] amen to take a stand amen now's the time
[1:18:40] amen to choose a side you say well
[1:18:42] brother andrew give it a few more years
[1:18:43] and i'll see if i can believe this
[1:18:45] message what greater time to believe it
[1:18:47] than tonight
[1:18:48] amen what greater time amen to give
[1:18:50] yourself to it
[1:18:51] than right now amen amen see that's what
[1:18:53] happened there in john 9
[1:18:55] that blind man had to take sides he
[1:18:57] either had to take sides with jesus
[1:18:59] or against jesus amen see the people
[1:19:02] tried them pharisees and sadducees
[1:19:05] now this is amazing and herodians all
[1:19:08] tried to cast a shadow on jesus
[1:19:10] but them true believers they meant them
[1:19:13] true believers
[1:19:14] that was predestinated to hear that
[1:19:16] message heard it
[1:19:17] and seen no fault in it the pharisees
[1:19:22] seen it
[1:19:23] the herodians saw it amen the sadducees
[1:19:26] heard it and they
[1:19:27] everyone found fault in it but the
[1:19:29] predestinated
[1:19:30] they heard it they saw it they believed
[1:19:33] it and they found no thought in it
[1:19:35] he said the same now amen those who
[1:19:37] believe him those who love him
[1:19:39] those who believe him see no fault in
[1:19:41] him they don't see any heresy
[1:19:43] they don't see anything wrong they don't
[1:19:45] see anything wrong with his word
[1:19:46] they don't see anything wrong with his
[1:19:48] people they just see
[1:19:50] jesus they're predestinated to eternal
[1:19:52] life
[1:19:53] so they just take sides with jesus and
[1:19:56] they stay there hey
[1:19:57] amen can i amen can i take a survey here
[1:19:59] for a second how many season he fought
[1:20:01] in this message how many seasons he
[1:20:03] fought in jesus
[1:20:05] how many seasons he fought in this bible
[1:20:06] you don't see that you know why because
[1:20:08] it's not there
[1:20:09] amen but how many sees a perfect word
[1:20:12] how many seeds are perfect blood
[1:20:13] how many seeds of perfect atonement how
[1:20:15] many seas
[1:20:16] amen a perfect interpretation of the
[1:20:19] written word
[1:20:20] amen then you know what you're obligated
[1:20:22] to do when you see it
[1:20:23] you're obligated to take sides with it
[1:20:26] amen and draw your sword
[1:20:28] and say i'll stand for jesus and let the
[1:20:30] world go by
[1:20:32] amen i'll claim these promises and he
[1:20:34] will supply
[1:20:35] there is a church in the last days that
[1:20:38] is not going to bow
[1:20:40] she is not going to turn away she is not
[1:20:42] just serving god
[1:20:43] in sincerity she is serving god in
[1:20:46] sincerity and
[1:20:48] in truth all denominations brother
[1:20:52] they all claim sincerity amen sincere
[1:20:55] sincere sincerity
[1:20:57] amen but come to the truth they don't
[1:20:58] want nothing to do with the truth
[1:21:00] amen but this bride wants the truth amen
[1:21:02] she loves the truth
[1:21:04] why because the truth is what set her
[1:21:07] free amen we're out this evening even
[1:21:10] somebody shout we're out
[1:21:11] we're out of the valley of decision hey
[1:21:14] amen we're not here tonight amen trying
[1:21:16] to decide if we should serve the lord
[1:21:18] trying to decide if we should believe
[1:21:19] him trying to decide that we should go
[1:21:21] back
[1:21:21] to the other side of the flood we have
[1:21:23] come to the other side
[1:21:25] amen we have seen christ come down
[1:21:28] and vindicate and there's no fault in
[1:21:31] him
[1:21:33] my amen now notice this he says you
[1:21:35] never know where to stand
[1:21:37] a man that's unstable like that he said
[1:21:39] or a person
[1:21:40] that professes to be a christian and
[1:21:42] that unstable you don't know what to do
[1:21:44] about that person
[1:21:45] today they're a christian tomorrow you
[1:21:46] don't know where they're at he said see
[1:21:48] in church today they're rejoicing and
[1:21:50] singing and praising god
[1:21:52] and tomorrow out drinking corrals and
[1:21:55] running around then that type of part
[1:21:57] that type of person
[1:21:58] is hard to do anything with amen now
[1:22:01] notice why
[1:22:02] even because they've not made a true
[1:22:04] stand
[1:22:05] they have not come to a clear-cut
[1:22:06] decision right
[1:22:09] now the bible says in james chapter 1
[1:22:11] verse 8 that a double-minded man
[1:22:13] is unstable which means restless in all
[1:22:16] his ways
[1:22:16] now what does that word double-minded
[1:22:18] mean it means wavering
[1:22:20] uncertain doubting
[1:22:25] now this here's a good one divided in
[1:22:28] interest
[1:22:30] a double-minded man is divided in his
[1:22:33] interest
[1:22:34] so so he's partly interested in the
[1:22:36] message and then partly interested in
[1:22:38] what's going on in nominational realms
[1:22:40] and then partly feed from a prophet and
[1:22:42] partly feeding from a theologian
[1:22:43] amen but but see you'll never make a
[1:22:45] stand that way
[1:22:46] you'll never make a stand for god you've
[1:22:49] got to come to a place where the prophet
[1:22:51] says a man once anchors his heart
[1:22:53] against the heart of calvary
[1:22:55] all devils in hell will never shake him
[1:22:57] no more he's there
[1:22:59] see he claims god to be his father when
[1:23:01] he's not just tossed about by every wind
[1:23:03] of doctrine
[1:23:03] not stable don't know where you're going
[1:23:06] double minded and a lot of times
[1:23:08] he says double tying don't know where
[1:23:10] you're standing or what you're talking
[1:23:12] about
[1:23:12] he said but a man that's been born again
[1:23:15] of the spirit of god
[1:23:17] knows exactly where he's at amen see a
[1:23:20] double-minded man
[1:23:21] is never able to come to the knowledge
[1:23:24] of the truth now think of this
[1:23:28] amen never able to come to a place of
[1:23:31] assurance
[1:23:32] never able to come to a place of
[1:23:35] confidence
[1:23:35] never able to come to a place where
[1:23:37] everything else is false
[1:23:39] and the message is the truth now i want
[1:23:42] to i want to show you something here
[1:23:44] the bible says amen that paul actually
[1:23:46] had to come
[1:23:48] amen to a new birth you believe that
[1:23:50] paul had to have
[1:23:51] a new birth now notice what the new
[1:23:53] birth did amen the new birth caused paul
[1:23:56] amen to change sides he meant the new
[1:23:58] birth caused paul
[1:23:59] to go from the side amen of persecuting
[1:24:02] the christians
[1:24:03] amen to the side of preaching to the
[1:24:05] christians amen see the
[1:24:07] the new birth caused paul amen to move
[1:24:10] into a place where he was no longer amen
[1:24:12] acting out on every man's command
[1:24:14] if the man said go down and kill the
[1:24:16] christians paul did it if they said go
[1:24:18] persecute him paul did it
[1:24:19] amen but after he took a stand
[1:24:24] after he took a stand after he come to a
[1:24:26] place
[1:24:27] where he anchored his heart against
[1:24:28] calvary he no longer listened to what
[1:24:31] man told him to do
[1:24:32] but he became in tune with the holy
[1:24:34] ghost and
[1:24:35] acted only upon what god spoke to him to
[1:24:38] do
[1:24:38] now you say brother andrew how amen can
[1:24:40] i take a stand today when i can't hear
[1:24:42] the voice of god
[1:24:43] oh don't fool yourself amen the same
[1:24:45] voice
[1:24:46] amen that was walking in the garden in
[1:24:48] genesis the third chapter
[1:24:50] is the same voice that walked from
[1:24:52] genesis 3
[1:24:53] amen to revelation 10 7 and the bible
[1:24:56] says in the days of the voice
[1:24:57] of the seventh angel and he shall begin
[1:24:59] to sound amen the voice of god
[1:25:01] they say how we know it's the voice of
[1:25:03] god because then
[1:25:04] it was in a vindicated prophet but now
[1:25:07] today
[1:25:08] it's the voice of god because it's the
[1:25:10] manifestation
[1:25:11] of the prophet's words he said this is
[1:25:14] god's prophet
[1:25:15] and a true voice of god only brings back
[1:25:18] that
[1:25:18] real living supernatural god there it is
[1:25:22] again
[1:25:22] with this supernatural word with the
[1:25:24] supernatural manifestation
[1:25:26] of the true word then we know it's the
[1:25:29] voice of god
[1:25:30] there's so much other in the other
[1:25:31] realms that just deadens that out
[1:25:34] but the voice of god amen the voice of
[1:25:36] revelation 10
[1:25:37] 7 has brought back the supernatural god
[1:25:40] with his supernatural word
[1:25:42] with a supernatural manifestation listen
[1:25:45] friends
[1:25:45] the voice of god is not here tonight
[1:25:48] amen to discern so much
[1:25:50] as it was when william branham was here
[1:25:51] but the voice of god is here tonight
[1:25:53] amen to call
[1:25:54] believers to a decision amen notice here
[1:25:58] in deuteronomy 30 amen the spirit of the
[1:26:00] lord spoke there that day
[1:26:01] in verse 15 see i have set before thee
[1:26:04] this day
[1:26:04] life and good amen death and evil verse
[1:26:07] 19
[1:26:08] i call heaven and earth to record
[1:26:11] against this day
[1:26:12] against you i have set before you life
[1:26:14] and death amen how many knows there's
[1:26:16] been life set before the church
[1:26:18] and death set he said i've set before
[1:26:20] you blessed and cursive
[1:26:21] notice what he says therefore choose
[1:26:24] life
[1:26:24] that both thou and thy seed may live
[1:26:28] amen brother says you must choose you a
[1:26:30] leader yes sir choose today
[1:26:32] amen choose life or death your choice
[1:26:35] will determine your eternal destination
[1:26:37] and to follow him to eternal life you
[1:26:40] must come on his terms
[1:26:41] that's right his word amen see there's a
[1:26:45] blessing then
[1:26:46] to those who will choose life there's a
[1:26:49] blessing then
[1:26:50] to those who will choose amen the
[1:26:51] blessings of god amen do you realize
[1:26:53] here tonight
[1:26:54] amen if you're a young man or a young
[1:26:56] lady do you realize your choice tonight
[1:26:58] has got the power amen to follow you in
[1:27:01] the marriage
[1:27:01] it's got the power to follow you amen
[1:27:04] into your children
[1:27:05] amen by your choice here tonight
[1:27:09] was that not what the bible says the
[1:27:11] bible said choose life
[1:27:12] that thou and thy seed may be blessed
[1:27:16] amen see the prophet then is telling you
[1:27:18] you've got to come
[1:27:19] amen to a public confession you've got
[1:27:22] to come to a public stand
[1:27:23] you've got to come and know beyond the
[1:27:25] shadow of a doubt
[1:27:26] that nobody can turn you around
[1:27:30] nobody can back you in a corner
[1:27:34] are you with me nobody can twist the
[1:27:37] word to you
[1:27:41] nobody can lead you against what god has
[1:27:44] revealed to you
[1:27:46] when you take a stand when you make a
[1:27:49] stand
[1:27:50] nobody can lead you differently now i'll
[1:27:53] just sit like this
[1:27:54] i don't believe at times you stay the
[1:27:55] message and you hear the brand preach
[1:27:57] the messages
[1:27:58] i don't believe that he was just
[1:27:59] actually preaching sermons
[1:28:02] i don't believe he was just pulling
[1:28:03] things out of the air i believe there
[1:28:05] was a divine order
[1:28:07] i believe there was a i believe there
[1:28:08] was a leadership there of why he was
[1:28:10] preaching when he was preaching
[1:28:11] in the order he was preaching amen
[1:28:13] here's one that i love
[1:28:14] and then you go look in there and you'll
[1:28:16] find there's a tape called the conflict
[1:28:18] between god and satan then the next
[1:28:21] sermon is
[1:28:22] taking sides with jesus
[1:28:25] the conflict between god and satan then
[1:28:28] taking sides with jesus
[1:28:29] you know what his text was amen in the
[1:28:32] conflict between god and satan
[1:28:33] it was joshua 24. if it seemed evil unto
[1:28:36] you
[1:28:36] choose you this day whom he will serve
[1:28:39] now the prophet says it this way the
[1:28:40] conflict
[1:28:41] is between god and satan the conflict is
[1:28:44] not between you and satan
[1:28:45] see you are the deciding factor and your
[1:28:48] victory comes from making a decision
[1:28:50] from taking sides
[1:28:52] now i want to read this to you amen
[1:28:53] prophet god says in conflict between god
[1:28:55] and satan
[1:28:56] satan in eden when he first come to this
[1:28:58] attack to attack the person on the
[1:29:00] children of god was fortified with the
[1:29:01] word
[1:29:02] he never attacked the being he attacked
[1:29:04] the word first
[1:29:08] look at that sneaker look at that lizard
[1:29:10] what does he do today
[1:29:12] the first thing he can't lay it on and
[1:29:14] say well that's not a good person
[1:29:16] but the only thing he tries to do no
[1:29:18] matter how good the person is
[1:29:20] is to get them to deny the
[1:29:23] so he attacks the word then the person
[1:29:26] but he attacks the person by getting the
[1:29:28] word
[1:29:29] amen denied to the person are you with
[1:29:31] me so satan
[1:29:32] satan tried to attack the word in the
[1:29:35] garden of eden so he had to have
[1:29:36] something now that he could use to the
[1:29:39] human being
[1:29:40] that would look better than the word see
[1:29:42] he had to have something
[1:29:43] that would look better to the human
[1:29:45] being that word and do you know what he
[1:29:47] used
[1:29:48] he used reasoning which is common sense
[1:29:51] so notice here then this great warfare
[1:29:53] amen is between right and wrong
[1:29:55] which it started in heaven oh god
[1:29:59] it started in heaven and between god
[1:30:03] the creator and lucifer the perverter
[1:30:06] now notice here
[1:30:07] lucifer pulled amen a third part of the
[1:30:09] angels
[1:30:10] and they took sides with him and by
[1:30:13] taking sides with him they failed
[1:30:15] and the problem of god tells his
[1:30:16] greatest battle ever fought angelic
[1:30:18] battles
[1:30:18] then drop down into human battles see
[1:30:20] now if you read revelation 12
[1:30:22] 4 it says in his tale amen drew the
[1:30:25] third part of the stars of heaven
[1:30:27] and did cast them to the earth now the
[1:30:29] prophet of god picks this up
[1:30:30] and says notice in revelation 12 he give
[1:30:32] a picture of a woman stand the moon in
[1:30:34] her head
[1:30:35] the sun at her head the moon under her
[1:30:37] feet the red dragon stood
[1:30:39] to devour the child as soon as it was
[1:30:41] born and he took his tail
[1:30:43] and pulled a third part of the stars and
[1:30:46] cast them to the earth did you notice
[1:30:47] that
[1:30:48] now that doesn't mean that aren't you
[1:30:50] thankful for a prophet
[1:30:54] now that doesn't mean that he notices
[1:30:56] that he had a long tail
[1:30:58] that he hooked around the people
[1:31:01] he didn't take his tail through heaven
[1:31:03] and find about third party angels
[1:31:05] and say now y'all follow amen i'm gonna
[1:31:07] hook you with my tail
[1:31:08] no the prophet said it was not his tale
[1:31:11] but the tle
[1:31:12] that he told it was the tale that he
[1:31:16] told
[1:31:16] and pulled the third part of those stars
[1:31:19] he said notice here
[1:31:20] who is the bride and morning star jesus
[1:31:22] of nazareth he said then watch here
[1:31:24] amen ever jesus natural is the brightest
[1:31:26] never lived in human flesh he is the
[1:31:27] right morning star
[1:31:28] he is the seat of abraham come to isaac
[1:31:30] and when he being dead and christ take
[1:31:32] on abraham's seed
[1:31:33] and her heirs according to the promise
[1:31:35] now watch the stars of the heaven
[1:31:38] represented the spirits of men here and
[1:31:41] when the red dragon roam under its
[1:31:42] persecution hugged in two-thirds of the
[1:31:44] stars
[1:31:45] cast him down that was at the
[1:31:47] crucifixion of our lord jesus when they
[1:31:49] rejected him
[1:31:50] and cast him out had nothing to do with
[1:31:52] him that was the third part
[1:31:54] of the angelic stars he says the angelic
[1:31:57] beings
[1:31:58] now watch here when satan calls this
[1:32:00] fall
[1:32:01] when he told his tale amen that to see
[1:32:03] the third part of the angels
[1:32:04] the proud of god said that opened up two
[1:32:07] sides it was the side
[1:32:09] of reasoning which was the devil's tale
[1:32:12] amen or to stay with thus saith the lord
[1:32:15] then satan out there's two sides there's
[1:32:18] the side
[1:32:19] of the devil's tail the same telly told
[1:32:21] eve
[1:32:22] it's the same till he told cain right
[1:32:25] it's the same tale he's been telling for
[1:32:28] years
[1:32:29] amen and people have taken that side but
[1:32:31] then there is another side
[1:32:33] and that side is called thus saith
[1:32:36] the lord amen notice here the word
[1:32:39] always in front of them
[1:32:40] always thus saith the lord notice you're
[1:32:43] the word of god
[1:32:44] there's no way around it everywhere thus
[1:32:46] saith the lord
[1:32:47] but you know in order to believe the
[1:32:49] devil's lie
[1:32:50] you have to ignore and deny god's truth
[1:32:57] before you can believe the devil's lie
[1:33:00] see you ever think of that you have to
[1:33:02] deny the truth
[1:33:04] before you could believe a lie notice
[1:33:06] here then to resist the devil's lie
[1:33:08] is what you're called to do
[1:33:14] can i say it like this you're actually
[1:33:16] anointed
[1:33:18] amen to resist the devil's lie
[1:33:23] and take sides with god's promised
[1:33:26] word oh i love this in saint john 14 23
[1:33:31] if any man love me he will keep my words
[1:33:34] and my father will love him and we will
[1:33:37] come unto him
[1:33:38] and make our abode with him he that
[1:33:40] loveth not me keep it not my sayings
[1:33:42] and the word which you hear he says
[1:33:45] is not mine but the fathers which sent
[1:33:48] me now notice here
[1:33:49] the church how many believers are the
[1:33:50] church
[1:33:52] must believe every word every promise
[1:33:55] every iota and claim it for themselves
[1:33:58] and
[1:33:58] exercise themselves in it see if god
[1:34:01] sends his church gifts
[1:34:02] then we should take those and not say
[1:34:05] they're not so
[1:34:06] but say they are so and believe them the
[1:34:09] real church keeps the promises
[1:34:11] notice here so then the fir and i'm
[1:34:13] bringing this to a close
[1:34:14] but the first human beings actually
[1:34:16] disfellowship themselves from god
[1:34:18] how did they disfellowship themselves
[1:34:20] from god by believing
[1:34:21] the devil's lie by believing the devil's
[1:34:24] tale
[1:34:25] the same tale he told amen to get a
[1:34:27] third part of the angels to fall with
[1:34:28] him
[1:34:29] was the same tell he told amen to get
[1:34:31] thieve and adam disfellowship from god
[1:34:34] he said see no one can believe the
[1:34:36] devil's lie
[1:34:38] until they have disbelieved god's truth
[1:34:40] see amen notice here amen you realize
[1:34:42] alive don't
[1:34:45] a stop get started i heard it said like
[1:34:47] this one time a lie will be around the
[1:34:49] world
[1:34:50] before the truth gets its shoes on
[1:34:53] right now watch this amen the lie that
[1:34:56] the devil told
[1:34:57] he didn't change it he told that same
[1:35:00] lie
[1:35:00] to eve but says he came and told cain
[1:35:03] that same lie
[1:35:03] he said it's the same lies told down to
[1:35:06] the ages look here in genesis 4 1
[1:35:08] i knew eva's wife and she conceived and
[1:35:10] bear came and what did she say
[1:35:12] i have gotten a man from the lord she
[1:35:15] did not attribute the son to satan for
[1:35:17] that would have made him equal with god
[1:35:19] only god created the egg in the womb of
[1:35:20] mary satan couldn't do that
[1:35:22] he knew that satan can only pervert so
[1:35:24] he beguiled her
[1:35:26] with the wrong seed she believed that
[1:35:28] cain was from god
[1:35:30] she accepted the devil's lie as god's
[1:35:33] true tote
[1:35:39] that is exactly what we have now
[1:35:43] now i'm skipping a whole lot between
[1:35:44] then and now but he says that's exactly
[1:35:47] what we have now is churches set
[1:35:50] themselves up
[1:35:51] as fountains of truth but the truth is
[1:35:54] not in them
[1:35:55] yet their begotten children swear by
[1:35:57] them and will even
[1:35:58] kill to uphold their error all
[1:36:01] based off of the same lie that he told
[1:36:04] the third part of the angels
[1:36:06] come down in the garden and to leave
[1:36:08] it's the same lie are you following me
[1:36:10] it's the same lie that he told eve when
[1:36:12] she said i've gotten a man from the lord
[1:36:14] and he comes all the way to today every
[1:36:16] and he says that's the same lie
[1:36:18] that many of these churches are built
[1:36:19] upon he said the men at the church moved
[1:36:21] towards form and ceremony
[1:36:23] and towards priesthood by organizing the
[1:36:25] ministers into a group that decided
[1:36:27] leadership apart from the holy spirit's
[1:36:28] word
[1:36:28] that very moment death entered in and
[1:36:31] she got
[1:36:32] started to get sick and as she got sick
[1:36:34] she changed to a powerless group of
[1:36:36] people
[1:36:37] whose only weapon was argument
[1:36:42] all coming from the devil's lie
[1:36:45] you tap with god he says and you reap
[1:36:47] exactly what you injected
[1:36:49] man i'll learn that from nature he has
[1:36:51] injected his own ideas into nature
[1:36:53] and rearranged molecules and now he is
[1:36:56] reaping a whirlwind
[1:36:57] he said now if you fool with nature and
[1:36:59] get a monstrosity
[1:37:00] as a backfire what will happen he says
[1:37:03] if you
[1:37:03] change amen the truth into a lie see
[1:37:06] notice
[1:37:07] if you flew with nature amen and changed
[1:37:09] nature into a monstrosity
[1:37:11] he said then what will happen if you
[1:37:13] change the truth into a lie
[1:37:15] the answer is you will breed an
[1:37:17] antichrist
[1:37:18] godless system a religion that is so
[1:37:21] perverted it'll look like or produce
[1:37:22] what the original did
[1:37:24] the only answer god has for a situation
[1:37:26] like that is the lake of fire
[1:37:28] are you hearing me church amen don't
[1:37:30] worry i'm not going to preach all night

[1:37:42] that's been told
[1:37:43] amen to churches today that has
[1:37:45] established themselves
[1:37:47] upon antichrist teachings upon men's
[1:37:50] opinions
[1:37:50] he said the only answer for that is a
[1:37:52] lake of fire
[1:37:53] amen but come on church amen that
[1:37:55] discourages the unbeliever
[1:37:57] that all the discouraged ain't been the

[1:41:32] backbone

[1:42:45] come a backbone there's going to come a
[1:42:47] strength
[1:42:48] there's got to come an authority to the
[1:42:49] church listen denominations in the
[1:42:51] condition it's
[1:42:52] not because there was no courage to make
[1:42:53] a stand
[1:42:56] you realize 20 years ago upc's taught it
[1:42:58] was wrong to have televisions in their
[1:42:59] home
[1:43:00] 50 years ago upc preachers was forbidden
[1:43:03] to have televisions in their home
[1:43:05] about two years ago a upc preacher told
[1:43:07] me in kingsport he said this weekend
[1:43:08] we're going to general conference
[1:43:10] when i lived in tennessee he said we're
[1:43:11] going to general conference i said what
[1:43:13] are you going to conference for
[1:43:14] he said well we got to have a vote he
[1:43:15] said we've got to go down there and all
[1:43:17] the preachers that are licensed with the
[1:43:18] upc church is coming together
[1:43:20] and we're going to vote can we have tvs
[1:43:22] or can we not have them
[1:43:24] i said why are you going to vote he said
[1:43:26] well 50 years ago it was wrong
[1:43:27] but over half of the last and ministers
[1:43:30] in the upc has got tvs now
[1:43:31] and it's caused the division and he said
[1:43:33] we got to go meet and decide if we could
[1:43:35] have him or not
[1:43:35] i thought how powerless
[1:43:38] well let's preach a while we're here how
[1:43:41] weak amen seek because there was no
[1:43:43] courage
[1:43:45] when it was identified wrong there was
[1:43:47] no courage
[1:43:48] to stand behind it and say no matter who
[1:43:50] does it no matter who gets it
[1:43:52] no matter who says it's okay if it was
[1:43:55] wrong 50 years ago
[1:43:56] amen it's still wrong today and let me
[1:43:58] say this church
[1:43:59] wow amen this may be my last time here
[1:44:02] but i'll go out the door preaching there
[1:44:04] amen if it was sin 20 years ago it's
[1:44:07] still
[1:44:07] sin tonight if it was wrong 20 years ago
[1:44:10] it's still wrong if high heel shoes amen
[1:44:13] was wrong when the prophet was here
[1:44:15] they're still wrong tonight amen if
[1:44:17] makeup was wrong
[1:44:18] when a prophet was here it's still wrong
[1:44:20] tonight you say why are you saying this
[1:44:22] because the time has come somebody has
[1:44:25] got to take sides
[1:44:26] somebody has got to make a stand is
[1:44:29] there anybody here tonight
[1:44:30] that'll say i hear the devil's lie i
[1:44:32] hear him telling us that it don't matter
[1:44:34] no more how we look
[1:44:35] i hear him telling us it don't matter
[1:44:37] anymore how we dress and what we say and
[1:44:39] where we go
[1:44:40] but i hear god's word saying amen you
[1:44:42] are separated
[1:44:43] amen holy people that has been set aside
[1:44:46] amen to the service of god is there
[1:44:48] anybody here tonight
[1:44:49] that'll say devil i'm not backing up i'm
[1:44:52] not turning around
[1:44:53] i'm not bowing a knee i'm not bending
[1:44:56] over to these idols
[1:44:57] i've been called to resist the devil's
[1:45:00] lie

[1:45:05] this okay
[1:45:05] you are anointed to resist the devil's
[1:45:08] lie
[1:45:09] you know why i can say that brother with
[1:45:11] such assurance
[1:45:12] brother lyle you know i can say that
[1:45:14] with such authority tonight is because
[1:45:16] the prophet said when god created me
[1:45:18] william branham
[1:45:19] i was before the foundation of the world
[1:45:22] he made my being my spirit i wasn't
[1:45:25] conscious of anything as far as i know
[1:45:26] of
[1:45:27] but i was there oh i don't believe
[1:45:28] you're getting it he says but now just a
[1:45:30] minute
[1:45:31] jesus told the disciples he knew them
[1:45:34] before the foundation of the world
[1:45:36] and paul said there he chose us in him
[1:45:39] before the world began god
[1:45:42] chose you he chose me sister before the
[1:45:45] foundation of the world god
[1:45:46] chose you brother arny amen before time
[1:45:50] before adams before molecules before
[1:45:52] there was one planet
[1:45:53] god chose you are you hearing me brother
[1:45:56] aaron before there was one devil
[1:45:58] amen god chose you before there was one
[1:46:00] sickness
[1:46:01] amen god i wish somebody helped me right
[1:46:03] here amen before there was one thing
[1:46:05] against you
[1:46:05] amen god chose you before there was one
[1:46:08] lie
[1:46:08] god chose you before there was one error
[1:46:11] amen god chose you
[1:46:13] before the foundation of the world and
[1:46:15] he said now there
[1:46:16] was some part of me ormond neville and
[1:46:19] the rest of you all here
[1:46:20] that's in christ jesus before the world
[1:46:22] ever begin
[1:46:23] and here's to my analysis of that
[1:46:26] how many will take his analysis i think
[1:46:29] the people today
[1:46:30] that are possessed with the spirit or
[1:46:32] the spirit
[1:46:33] a part of these angelic beings is spirit
[1:46:36] which rotated off of god
[1:46:38] that never fail in the beginning
[1:46:42] and resisted the devil's lie
[1:46:45] in heaven now do you see the mystery
[1:46:47] amen now do you see why the devil hates
[1:46:49] you
[1:46:50] it's because of your name oh god
[1:46:54] if your name is on the lamb's book of
[1:46:56] life
[1:46:57] amen if your name was put there by the
[1:46:59] blood of almighty god
[1:47:00] before there was one devil before there
[1:47:02] was one sin
[1:47:04] he knew you and you rotated are you
[1:47:06] hearing me
[1:47:07] amen you rotated off of god you rotated
[1:47:10] out of god
[1:47:11] you rotated into time and you know why
[1:47:13] the devil's not nervous
[1:47:14] or god's not nervous it's because he saw
[1:47:17] you there
[1:47:17] resist the devils lie down here and if
[1:47:20] you resist to the devils lie down here
[1:47:22] you would have resisted that are you
[1:47:24] hearing me church no matter what he says
[1:47:26] no matter what glory tries to come in no
[1:47:28] matter what trick he tries to play
[1:47:30] there is a bride on the earth today

[1:48:38] truth and they're believing him
[1:48:41] telling people god don't heal no more
[1:48:43] and they're believing him
[1:48:44] telling people god don't say no more
[1:48:46] they're believing him

[1:49:03] the lamb's book of life
[1:49:04] and my bible says every knee bowed to
[1:49:07] the beast
[1:49:08] and to his mark and to the image except
[1:49:10] those
[1:49:11] whose names was on the lamb's book of

[1:49:16] you the rest of the story can i tell you
[1:49:18] the rest of it and you know what else he
[1:49:19] said in revelation 15

[1:49:24] on the other side he meant with her foot
[1:49:27] on the devil's head
[1:49:30] brother how quick can you give me

[1:51:53] because she was going to get to victory
[1:51:55] no sir she already had the victory
[1:51:58] why was she playing that tambourine
