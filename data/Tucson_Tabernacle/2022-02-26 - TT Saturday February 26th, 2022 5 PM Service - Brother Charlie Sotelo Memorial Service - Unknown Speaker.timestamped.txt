[30:43] but more importantly the lord loved my
[30:44] brother
[30:46] charlie was a true friend and it didn't

[31:03] conversation he had the ability to throw
[31:05] the ball back
[31:06] keeping the conversation going
[31:09] he listened more than he spoke

[33:22] sotelo charlie was born september 29
[33:26] 1947 at st mary's hospital
[33:29] and at that time
[33:30] my parents were living in tucson arizona
[33:34] construction work can be hard to find
[33:36] and tucson can be either feast or famine
[33:39] when it comes to finding work
[33:41] my father often followed the work
[33:44] taking the family with him anywhere he
[33:46] went
[33:47] he was preaching the gospel
[33:50] charlie lived in towns such as clifton
[33:53] berensi duncan
[33:55] mammoth and tucson arizona
[34:01] my father introduced charlie to the
[34:03] outdoors and hunting at an early age
[34:06] southern arizona was filled with rabbits
[34:08] quail javelina and deer
[34:12] my father bought charlie a 22 caliber
[34:14] caliber rifle before he started
[34:16] elementary school
[34:18] he made sure that charlie knew how to
[34:19] take care of it
[34:21] and was extremely big on safety
[34:24] charlie went out to the field every
[34:26] chance he got
[34:28] because of hunting and living in the
[34:30] small towns with lots of game charlie
[34:32] really got to know southern arizona
[34:35] in 1959
[34:37] my father started
[34:38] to build a church
[34:41] the house of prayer on the property in
[34:43] mammoth arizona
[34:45] charlie was 11 years old
[34:48] this was a job for a man
[34:50] and my father and charlie were working
[34:52] together to build it
[34:54] my father was working at kitt peak
[34:57] observatory then would rush home to
[35:00] complete the project
[35:02] other brothers would
[35:03] help with the block laying a block and
[35:06] pouring concrete but charlie was the
[35:08] main person that helped my dad
[35:11] in 1954 charlie started
[35:14] elementary school and junior high and
[35:16] mammoth
[35:18] charlie was restless as all young boys
[35:20] are
[35:20] and he found his chair of mischief
[35:24] along with his uh sister and his
[35:26] co-conspirator norma
[35:28] in 1960
[35:30] sixth grade
[35:31] my father noticed that charlie and norma
[35:33] were coming home from school scraped up
[35:35] from fights
[35:37] uh he he bought some 12 ounce leather
[35:40] boxing gloves and started teaching
[35:43] charlie how to box norma was always
[35:45] close by watching
[35:47] later that year a few boys ganged up
[35:49] against him after school and met him as
[35:51] he was leaving
[35:53] he was outnumbered but he had his sister
[35:56] fighting alongside
[35:58] my mom didn't like them fighting but she
[36:01] also told them if it was for your honor
[36:03] they needed to
[36:05] fight back and finish it
[36:07] they came home triumphant
[36:11] that same year charlie was itching to go
[36:13] hunting and he persisted
[36:15] that he was going to go hunting uh after
[36:18] school
[36:19] my mom told him not to go
[36:22] my dad told him not to go
[36:24] you wait until i get home from from work
[36:26] and then i'll take you
[36:28] charlie came home from school and went
[36:30] anyways
[36:31] one of the boys that went with him
[36:33] accidentally shot charlie in the ankle
[36:37] around seventh grade he was complaining
[36:41] to my mother
[36:42] the kids at school have so much good
[36:44] things to eat crunchy apples
[36:47] pastries
[36:48] hosted cupcakes chocolate
[36:51] she told charlie praise god anyways say
[36:54] thank you jesus charlie
[36:56] and charlie would not do it he was upset
[37:00] they don't they're not even christians
[37:02] they have so much
[37:05] finally after walking around upset he
[37:07] said thank you jesus instantly there was
[37:09] a knock on the door
[37:11] it was a young girl that worked at the
[37:13] grocery store nearby
[37:15] my mother answered the door and the
[37:18] young girl says sister sotelo i felt in
[37:20] my heart to get you these groceries
[37:22] i really don't know how to shop for
[37:24] groceries but i brought you this bag
[37:27] in the bag was crunchy apples
[37:29] pastries hosted cupcakes
[37:32] and chocolates tailor made for charlie
[37:36] reading was not one of charlie's best
[37:38] skills
[37:40] uh my mother got advice from one of the
[37:43] educators as he was growing up
[37:46] find things that
[37:47] that he likes to read
[37:49] and put them somewhere that is
[37:51] accessible
[37:52] charlie loved boxing
[37:54] and he loved hunting and fishing
[37:56] in that bathroom my mom put a magazine
[37:58] rack for charlie's reading materials it
[38:00] obviously worked
[38:02] because charlie knew all the boxing
[38:04] stats
[38:05] and he learned how to reload ammo of any
[38:08] kind regardless if it was
[38:10] rifle or pistol
[38:12] in hard times he would even melt down
[38:14] lead and cast his own bullets
[38:20] high school was
[38:21] spread between three high schools
[38:25] charlie spent his uh freshman year and
[38:27] part of his sophomore year at
[38:29] salmon well high school
[38:31] my parents
[38:32] moved back to tucson in arizona
[38:35] tucson arizona in 1965
[38:38] where charlie did a semester at pueblo
[38:39] high school
[38:42] charlie quit
[38:43] school and went into the apprenticeship
[38:45] as a meat cutter
[38:47] this was a skill that he was going to
[38:48] use
[38:49] and find useful cleaning and butchering
[38:51] game later
[38:54] he apprenticed under brother agustin
[38:56] hoyer senior
[38:57] and our brother-in-law henry hoyer
[39:00] he stayed out of school till the fall of
[39:03] 1965 where he started his junior year at
[39:06] sunnyside high school
[39:08] it was at this time that he got into the
[39:10] carpenters apprenticeship through the
[39:12] shop classes at sunnyside
[39:14] he graduated from sunnyside high school
[39:16] in 1967.
[39:19] he started working
[39:21] as a second year carpenter's apprentice
[39:23] straight out of high school
[39:24] and he worked in

[39:54] high school he was helping an elderly
[39:56] lady
[39:57] take her groceries to the to her car
[39:59] unbeknownst to him was a girl sitting in
[40:01] the car in the parking lot
[40:03] the lord spoke to that girl and told her
[40:06] this is going to be your husband
[40:08] a couple years later he met uh charlie
[40:11] met teresa
[40:13] he was star struck with her and they
[40:15] went out for two weeks and he proposed
[40:19] six months later
[40:20] in december the 27th of 1968

[41:19] no family they had no choice but to
[41:21] trust in god
[41:23] in aztec new mexico the lord gave them a
[41:26] home with no money in their pockets
[41:29] another time they drove to church in
[41:31] and cedar hill new mexico by faith
[41:34] because they had no gas
[41:37] god took them to new mexico like he took
[41:39] moses to the back side of the desert to
[41:40] find out who
[41:42] who they were
[41:43] they experienced many many miracles that
[41:45] built their
[41:46] faith in god work ran out in new mexico
[41:49] and it was time to come back in
[41:51] 1987 they moved back to tucson arizona
[41:55] charlie started building custom homes
[41:56] and
[41:57] he employed his brothers and his
[41:59] brother-in-law eddie lauzon
[42:04] my brother was a family man and he was
[42:06] constantly surrounded by family
[42:08] charlie always stopped in to check on my
[42:10] mother and father
[42:12] and he would do all the handy man things
[42:14] that my mother could think of
[42:16] he always made time for them throughout
[42:19] the day and he loved to pick them up
[42:22] pick up my father and they would hang
[42:24] out every day

[42:44] were best friends
[42:46] together they would sit and load bullets
[42:48] for hours social would sit outside with
[42:50] charlie laughing
[42:52] have you ever heard a group of hotels
[42:54] left
[42:57] other times they would just
[42:58] remember about times past but mostly
[43:01] they always talked about going to the
[43:02] next hunt
[43:04] both of them along with david became
[43:06] regulars at the tucson mountain rifle
[43:08] and pistol range
[43:10] charlie loved testing and dialing in
[43:12] loads
[43:14] as you know charlie loved to go hunting

[43:33] almost all of us have gotten our deer
[43:35] there

[43:38] get to this hill early in the morning
[43:40] and sit he left the glass
[43:42] he taught us how to glass and spot deer
[43:45] it was an extremely productive place
[43:48] i saw him pass up big bucks so that us
[43:51] lesser
[43:52] experienced hunters would bag our first
[43:55] big buck
[43:57] because of charlie hunting trips became
[44:00] family events
[44:02] where we would we were all allowed to
[44:04] bond making our family stronger

[48:03] the youngest of nine children i have
[48:06] many wonderful memories of my brother
[48:08] charlie i shared a room with charlie
[48:10] david and tim at one time
[48:13] i have many great memories of my brother
[48:15] he was an awesome brother
[48:17] one of my earliest memories was when my
[48:19] brother married my sister-in-law terry
[48:21] who was like my second mom
[48:23] i remember feeling very lucky that terry
[48:25] was now in our family
[48:27] terry says that i slept with them on
[48:28] their wedding night i don't remember
[48:30] that
[48:32] throughout the years terry and i
[48:34] throughout the years if i ever needed
[48:36] any kind of mental or moral support
[48:39] charlie and terry were there for me
[48:41] it was charlie who got me to love boxing
[48:43] as a boy
[48:44] i would box charlie for what i thought
[48:46] was hours and he would take me to the
[48:47] boxing matches all the time
[48:50] we would even go watch the boxers train
[48:53] i wanted to do everything that charlie
[48:54] done
[48:56] charlie was a serious outdoorsman we
[48:58] liked hunting fishing and camping
[49:01] charlie helped me cap my first catch my
[49:03] first fish and fish at puerto lovos
[49:05] mexico
[49:06] i was sore for real for really in that
[49:08] fish for days
[49:10] i have left for hunting fishing and
[49:12] camping because charlie made it fun for
[49:14] me
[49:15] i can honestly say i was
[49:17] i was mad at charlie only one time
[49:21] and it was my own fault as a pre-teen i
[49:23] was a catcher of a baseball team
[49:25] i asked charlie to pitch a few balls to
[49:27] me so i could practice catching after
[49:30] about 20 pitches charlie thought i was
[49:31] ready for his curveball and that ball
[49:34] curved right into my eye
[49:36] i had a black eye for a long time
[49:39] there are many things in my
[49:41] family because of my brother charlie
[49:44] showed me how to be a good and loving
[49:46] father
[49:47] he showed me how to talk to my children
[49:49] and grandchildren
[49:50] charlie was a great father
[49:53] and grandfather
[49:54] he was a great example of a human being
[49:57] that i strive to be like
[50:08] what a privilege to be remembered that
[50:10] way
[50:11] for a family
[50:12] to have such precious memories
[50:16] if you understand
[50:19] they asked
[50:23] as a
[50:24] congregation psalm turn your eyes upon
[50:26] jesus
[50:28] to think about the words that
[50:30] his younger brothers speak of him
[50:33] that was because jesus was in charlie
[50:36] and he was the one being reflected
[50:41] oh
[50:42] turn your
[50:44] eyes upon
[50:48] [Music]
[51:01] and the
[51:02] things of
[51:04] earth
[51:06] will grow
[51:08] [Music]
[51:19] the family has asked our brother newton
[51:21] bennett if he would speak here so as he
[51:24] comes we'll sing it one more time
[51:28] [Music]
[51:45] and the
[51:46] things of
[51:48] earth will grow strange
[51:57] [Music]
[52:07] god bless you you could be seated
[52:11] again i'd like to greet you in the name
[52:12] of the lord jesus and welcome you to the
[52:15] life celebration of brother charlie
[52:16] sotelo
[52:18] been said that uh
[52:20] brother charlie was quite a character
[52:22] but in his
[52:23] character way he was very unassuming
[52:26] even in his stature and in his
[52:28] mannerisms
[52:30] uh but you knew when he was there
[52:32] because he changed the atmosphere
[52:34] charlie always come into a place and it
[52:37] didn't matter what was happening you
[52:38] felt at peace
[52:40] he just had that look about him in that
[52:42] that era about him that you know it's
[52:44] just it was just peaceful you always
[52:47] felt like i mean look at this face
[52:49] how would you not be at peace with his
[52:52] his this beautiful face is is real
[52:54] calming and uh reassuring and then when
[52:56] you then when he opened his mouth you
[52:58] you felt even more at peace because uh
[53:01] you could just know that there was
[53:02] something about him that was different
[53:05] and uh and and special
[53:07] i believe it's of course everyone in
[53:10] their own separate ways but charlotte
[53:11] just had his way and
[53:13] it was it was very special and
[53:16] i appreciate enjoyed brother charlie's
[53:18] fellowship and the time together and i
[53:20] didn't spend as much time with him maybe
[53:22] as many of you have of course family but
[53:24] brother charlie was very precious to me
[53:26] and i was very honored even just for a
[53:28] few months to
[53:29] be called his pastor and
[53:32] i do appreciate that honor and
[53:34] appreciate brother charlie and each of
[53:36] you being here so
[53:38] i want to read a couple of scriptures
[53:39] and just give a little thought if i
[53:40] could out of the word of god tonight and
[53:43] in honor of brother charlie because i
[53:45] believe that that would be the one thing
[53:46] that brother charlie would turn to more
[53:48] than anything would be the lord jesus i
[53:50] believe if brother charlie we're here
[53:52] right now he would tell you the very
[53:53] same thing if you haven't turned your
[53:55] life to jesus you should do it tonight
[53:58] right now there might not be a tomorrow
[54:00] we're not promised tomorrow and the way
[54:01] the world events are going we may not
[54:04] know if there is a tomorrow and i
[54:05] believe that charlie we're here in the
[54:07] flesh he'd tell you the very same thing
[54:09] because i believe charlie is in the
[54:10] place that he had been striving for his
[54:12] whole life and i believe he wants all of
[54:14] his family and friends to come and share
[54:17] that with him and be that as a part of
[54:19] the the inheritance and the heritage
[54:22] that he shared with each one of you when
[54:24] he was here so i'm gonna go to
[54:26] philippians to start now and uh
[54:28] philippians the third chapter read a
[54:30] couple of verses here starting with
[54:32] verse 9.
[54:34] philippians 3 9 and he found in him
[54:37] not having mine own righteousness which
[54:40] is of the law
[54:41] but that which is through the faith of
[54:43] christ the righteousness which is god by
[54:46] faith and that righteousness is by faith
[54:49] that i may know him and the power of his
[54:52] resurrection the fellowship of his
[54:54] suffering being made conformable unto
[54:57] his death if by any means i might attain
[55:00] to the resurrection of the dead not as
[55:03] though i had already attained either
[55:05] were already perfect but i follow after
[55:08] even that i may apprehend that for which
[55:10] also i am apprehended of christ jesus
[55:13] brethren i count not myself to have
[55:15] apprehended but one thing i do
[55:18] forgetting those things which are behind
[55:20] and reaching forth unto those things are
[55:22] before i press toward the mark
[55:25] for the prize of the high calling of god
[55:28] in christ jesus
[55:30] i believe that's how brother charlie
[55:31] spent his life we hear about the things
[55:34] that he did and the the exploits that he
[55:36] had in life he was a hard worker he
[55:38] loved hunting and outdoors and those
[55:40] things but in all of that the one thing
[55:43] that was constant it sounded through all
[55:44] the testimonies and the way i knew him
[55:47] was that he pressed toward that mark he
[55:50] pressed towards the mark you know when
[55:52] you're in a race there's always a finish
[55:55] line there's always a goal that you're
[55:57] trying to attain there's always a place
[55:59] you're trying to reach and for some
[56:01] people it seems unattainable for some
[56:04] people in a race they get tired or they
[56:06] they get weary or they faint or they
[56:08] fall out of the race before they finish
[56:10] but you know when you're a christian and
[56:12] and that mark is the one thing that
[56:14] you're striving for no matter how weary
[56:16] life may get and no matter hard or
[56:19] complicated or difficult things can seem
[56:22] you're always striving for that one mark
[56:25] that mark is the prize
[56:27] of the high calling of god in christ
[56:30] jesus brother charlie's attained that
[56:32] prize
[56:33] brother charlie's enjoying that prize
[56:35] tonight that prize of life that he has
[56:38] made to that he has come to the end of
[56:40] he has finished his course he has run
[56:42] his race and he has uh
[56:45] gotten that prize he's attained that
[56:47] prize through life
[56:49] all of life and everything that charlie
[56:51] did was to bring to that one moment in
[56:53] time and you know every one of us will
[56:55] come to that one moment in time
[56:57] everybody every mortal person will come
[57:00] to that place in time where you will
[57:02] face the same thing that charlie faced i
[57:04] believe charlie was ready to go but even
[57:06] brother chuck told me a couple weeks ago
[57:08] he told him that he was ready to go even
[57:10] before he contracted covet
[57:12] brother charlie was the man who lived
[57:14] his life for the lord jesus and he was
[57:17] ready to go he was ready to go meet the
[57:19] lord jesus
[57:20] paul said here he said not though as i
[57:23] either
[57:23] or i may know him after the power of his
[57:27] resurrection
[57:28] amen the power of his resurrection so
[57:31] that's the thing that we're looking
[57:33] forward to now that's the thing that
[57:35] brother charlie's looking forward to is
[57:37] that that that uh resurrection that time
[57:41] where he comes forth in a perfected body
[57:44] amen you know there's three bodies we
[57:46] have this natural body here
[57:48] we have a celestial body which we call
[57:50] the theophany that's where brother
[57:51] charlie is now but there'll be a time at
[57:54] the resurrection
[57:55] where that body will come back and it'll
[57:58] pick up this body that he was housed
[58:00] this glorified condition it'll be a
[58:03] glorified body he'll pick that up no
[58:05] matter where it is around the world no
[58:07] matter what the elements no matter where
[58:09] it's spread you could take an ash and
[58:11] you can put it in every ocean and in
[58:13] every continent in the world and when
[58:15] that resurrection comes and that voice
[58:17] shouts out just like it did at the grave
[58:19] of lazarus
[58:20] charlie cetilla will come forth in a
[58:23] glorified condition
[58:25] he'll be come forth once again in that
[58:27] prize that he was looking to that that
[58:30] perfect body i'm assuming that this
[58:32] picture here is a lot closer to what he
[58:34] looked like when he was 18 19 21 years
[58:37] old i'm not sure
[58:38] how old he was here uh it looks like
[58:41] brother billy a few years ago to me as
[58:43] before the grace i'd i looked at it and
[58:45] i thought mine did they get the pictures
[58:47] mixed up
[58:49] look looks like it's sun there his son
[58:50] looks like him amen but he that's what
[58:53] he'll be like that's what we're looking
[58:55] for in that resurrection when they come
[58:56] but that high calling that he has
[58:59] attained that place that prize that
[59:01] charlie has attained is that high
[59:03] calling and every christian has that
[59:05] high calling it's a calling above all
[59:08] else to be called a christian it's a
[59:11] privilege to be called a christian do
[59:13] you know that it's a privilege because
[59:16] to be called a christian means that you
[59:18] are christ-like and if you are
[59:20] christ-like then you've reached that
[59:21] place to where christ is pleased with
[59:24] you and as our precious brother said
[59:27] he's identified himself with brother
[59:29] charlie and that identification i
[59:32] believe is what we recognized in brother
[59:34] charlie that identification that jesus
[59:37] was so pleased with charlie sotelo that
[59:40] he placed his own life in him
[59:43] charlie wasn't the same anymore he was a
[59:44] different person brand new creature in
[59:47] christ jesus amen and that's the place
[59:49] that
[59:50] that that's the thing that's going to
[59:52] take him there amen that's the place
[59:54] that he's looking for i believe he was
[59:56] ready to go he had run his race he had
[59:59] kept the faith he had done what god had
[1:00:01] called him to do
[1:00:02] i got another scripture i want to read
[1:00:04] to you
[1:00:06] found in ii timothy
[1:00:08] amen you know
[1:00:10] people talk about this covet thing going
[1:00:13] on and you almost get the sense that
[1:00:15] people think that
[1:00:17] that satan can rob the life of a child
[1:00:19] of god friend i'm here to tell you today
[1:00:21] that there is no way that satan can rob
[1:00:24] a child of god
[1:00:25] if you're a child of god you're in the
[1:00:27] palm of his hand and no one can pluck
[1:00:29] him out
[1:00:30] they don't matter if cancer if it's
[1:00:32] heart attack if it's whatever vehicle by
[1:00:35] which god chooses it was just charlie
[1:00:37] satello's time to go home
[1:00:39] and all and every one of us i'm looking
[1:00:41] forward to that time myself i still
[1:00:43] we're all still pressing for that mark
[1:00:45] we're still all looking for the end of
[1:00:47] that race we're all still all looking to
[1:00:49] attain that prize but it'll come
[1:00:52] looking for it charlie's already got it
[1:00:55] praise the lord he's already in that new
[1:00:56] body you know what charlie cetello is no
[1:00:58] longer hurting
[1:01:00] charlie cetillo is no longer in pain
[1:01:02] charlie sotelo is no longer confined to
[1:01:04] a wheelchair
[1:01:06] amen he's dancing if we can see him
[1:01:08] today praise the lord he's dancing forth
[1:01:12] in that dew body celebrating that life
[1:01:14] that he was looking for second timothy
[1:01:17] chapter four verse six through eight
[1:01:21] second timothy four six through 8 4 now
[1:01:23] paul said now for i am now ready
[1:01:26] to be offered
[1:01:28] the time of my departure is at hand
[1:01:30] i heard that
[1:01:33] i don't know if charlie put it in those
[1:01:34] exact words but i heard that was his
[1:01:36] that was his attitude that's how he felt
[1:01:39] he was ready to meet the lord
[1:01:43] the time of my departure is that hand i
[1:01:45] have fought a good fight i have finished
[1:01:47] my course i have kept the faith the
[1:01:50] faith
[1:01:51] the faith
[1:01:52] the faith
[1:01:54] you know jesus said if we believe and
[1:01:56] have faith in him that nothing should be
[1:01:59] impossible unto us
[1:02:01] praise the lord the faith not a faith
[1:02:04] but the faith
[1:02:06] i have fought a good fight finished my
[1:02:08] course i've kept the faith henceforth
[1:02:10] there is laid up for me a crown of
[1:02:13] righteousness
[1:02:15] praise the lord what is a crown a crown
[1:02:16] is a prize a crown is something that's
[1:02:18] awarded to royalty
[1:02:21] i believe charlie satello was a member
[1:02:23] of the royal family no not in britain or
[1:02:26] england but the royal family of god
[1:02:29] he was an ambassador of heaven he was an
[1:02:32] he was a a a representative of jesus
[1:02:35] christ on this earth
[1:02:37] he is now attained that crown that
[1:02:40] righteousness that is of jesus christ it
[1:02:42] wasn't charlotte cetillos he said well i
[1:02:44] know all kinds of faults failures
[1:02:46] mistakes things charlie no no no we're
[1:02:48] not talking about that i mean the blood
[1:02:50] of jesus christ annihilates everything
[1:02:52] that satan could ever hold against
[1:02:53] charlie cetello
[1:02:55] charlie zattello was wrapped in the
[1:02:57] righteousness of jesus christ that very
[1:03:00] same righteousness every one of you if
[1:03:01] you're not in it tonight have the
[1:03:03] opportunity to be wrapped in
[1:03:05] every one of you amen can be wrapped in
[1:03:08] that same righteousness the
[1:03:10] righteousness that is of jesus christ
[1:03:12] perfection
[1:03:13] amen not not the perfection of man
[1:03:16] but the perfection of god
[1:03:18] you know men look through prisms in a
[1:03:21] different way than when god looks at it
[1:03:23] when god looks down he sees it in a
[1:03:25] different light he sees everything so
[1:03:27] his ways are greater than our ways
[1:03:28] higher than our ways he looks at it
[1:03:30] through a different lens he looks at it
[1:03:32] through different eyes he looks at it in
[1:03:34] a different way than what we do
[1:03:36] like we call love love people think love
[1:03:39] is
[1:03:40] is universal
[1:03:42] no it's not the love of god far exceeds
[1:03:46] anything the love of man could ever
[1:03:48] begin to produce
[1:03:49] and it's perplexing to people they don't
[1:03:51] understand
[1:03:52] but it's god's righteousness the crown
[1:03:55] of righteousness which the lord the
[1:03:57] righteous judge shall give me at that
[1:03:59] day and not to me only but unto all them
[1:04:04] amen can we can we put charlie's name in
[1:04:06] that would be all right amen
[1:04:09] not to me alone but to charlie sotelo
[1:04:12] amen i believe that i can put my name
[1:04:15] there too can you put your name in there
[1:04:18] i hope so i hope you can put you if you
[1:04:20] want to see charlie cetillo again your
[1:04:22] name better be able to fit right there
[1:04:24] amen don't matter if you're family or
[1:04:26] whatever i'm religious so that don't
[1:04:28] matter the devil's religious
[1:04:31] but are you christian
[1:04:32] are you born again there's there's the
[1:04:34] separating line amen
[1:04:36] that day
[1:04:38] amen that he shall give me at that day
[1:04:41] not me only
[1:04:43] but unto all them also that love his
[1:04:46] appearing
[1:04:48] praise the lord
[1:04:49] my last conversation with brother
[1:04:51] charlie was just that
[1:04:53] he was looking forward to that time
[1:04:55] he was looking forward to that that
[1:04:57] prism this is this is
[1:04:59] long before the event the hospital all
[1:05:02] that
[1:05:03] but in his heart
[1:05:04] in a christian's heart
[1:05:06] it bleeds for the lord jesus it desires
[1:05:09] the lord jesus
[1:05:10] you know jesus said in the beatitudes if
[1:05:13] you hunger and thirst after
[1:05:14] righteousness you shall be filled
[1:05:17] amen you shall be if you're hungering
[1:05:20] and thirsting for him you shall be
[1:05:22] filled now there's not another promise
[1:05:24] of that in the world there's all kinds
[1:05:25] of people that hunger for and thirst for
[1:05:27] wealth but they never attain it they
[1:05:30] hunger and thirst for riches and for
[1:05:32] fame but they never attain it
[1:05:34] they're hungering and they're thirsting
[1:05:35] for power and and
[1:05:38] and something to take over the world and
[1:05:40] humanity and but they never attain it
[1:05:43] but the promise of jesus is if you
[1:05:45] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:05:47] you shall be filled
[1:05:49] amen just like brother charlie was
[1:05:51] filled
[1:05:52] praise the lord
[1:05:54] charlie's in that glorified body now

[1:06:13] in cartero amen
[1:06:15] it's good to see you
[1:06:17] praise the lord talked about brother
[1:06:19] charlie often when she came when we were
[1:06:20] there but i got one more scripture i
[1:06:22] want to read because i don't want to
[1:06:24] hold it too long
[1:06:25] amen there's
[1:06:27] obviously more that could be said
[1:06:30] but the thing i want us to understand
[1:06:32] today is that brother charlie is with
[1:06:34] the lord jesus now
[1:06:36] he's in that dimension where there's no
[1:06:38] sorrow and there's no pain and there's
[1:06:39] no struggle
[1:06:41] you know what charlie's not worried one
[1:06:43] iota about whether russia is invading
[1:06:45] ukraine or not he's not worried one iota
[1:06:48] about covet 19 or any disease or
[1:06:50] affliction he's not worried about the
[1:06:52] next president if there is one
[1:06:55] he's not worried about any of those he's
[1:06:57] he's attained his price he has made it
[1:07:00] he's there he's waiting for us
[1:07:02] amen and i want i want to be one to
[1:07:05] fulfill that desire in his heart to see
[1:07:07] me again because i want to see him again
[1:07:10] hebrews
[1:07:12] uh hebrews chapter 12
[1:07:14] verses 1 and 2.
[1:07:17] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:07:19] about with so great a cloud of witness
[1:07:22] let us lay aside every weight
[1:07:25] it's good advice tonight lay aside every
[1:07:28] weight you know a weight is something
[1:07:29] that drags you down
[1:07:31] a lot of people are weighted down today
[1:07:33] and they don't even know it sin itself
[1:07:35] is a weight
[1:07:36] that weighs you down
[1:07:38] and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:07:41] us and let us run with patience the race
[1:07:44] that is set before us that race that
[1:07:47] brother charlie has finished
[1:07:50] the prize he has attained the crown of
[1:07:52] righteousness that is his
[1:07:55] he's finished his race he has finished
[1:07:57] his course
[1:07:58] we miss him
[1:07:59] he meant the bodily part of charlie
[1:08:02] sotillo we miss very much
[1:08:04] grieve in our hearts and there's nothing
[1:08:06] wrong with grieving there's nothing
[1:08:08] wrong with being sad
[1:08:09] but i enjoy when i hear a story about
[1:08:11] brother charlie that makes me chuckle a
[1:08:13] little bit because those are the
[1:08:14] memories i like to have those are the
[1:08:17] things i like to remember coming home
[1:08:19] all beat up and the next time he comes
[1:08:21] home and his sisters beat him him and
[1:08:22] his sisters beat up a group
[1:08:24] just
[1:08:25] that's the things i'll remember about
[1:08:27] brother charlie amen because i
[1:08:29] that's the kind of person he was
[1:08:32] amen he would rather make somebody laugh
[1:08:34] than cry
[1:08:35] he would rather make somebody happy than
[1:08:37] make them sad and you think well that
[1:08:40] sounds silly don't most people do that
[1:08:42] have you been around the world today
[1:08:44] do you think most people actually feel
[1:08:47] that way do you think most people want
[1:08:49] to see you happy rather than sad
[1:08:52] sometimes i wonder but charlie was an
[1:08:55] old soul he was a rare breed he was a
[1:08:57] man of god he loved the lord jesus
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:02] lay aside every weight the sin which do
[1:09:04] it does so easily beset us let us run
[1:09:06] with patience the race that is set
[1:09:09] before us looking unto jesus the author
[1:09:12] which is the beginner
[1:09:14] and the finisher which is the ender
[1:09:17] of our faith
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:20] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:09:23] endured the cross despising the same is
[1:09:26] set down on the right hand of the throne
[1:09:27] of god
[1:09:30] charlie's reached his place

[1:28:32] in honoring my father charles manuel
[1:28:34] sotelo
[1:28:36] um
[1:28:38] well to me
[1:28:40] my father was a hero
[1:28:42] everything i looked at him
[1:28:44] to me was a hero you know everything
[1:28:46] that he did in my eyes
[1:28:48] he was the best
[1:28:51] the way he swung a hammer i thought he
[1:28:52] was the best carpenter i've ever seen in
[1:28:54] my life
[1:28:57] when he shot a gun
[1:28:59] i thought he was the best shot the best
[1:29:01] hunter that's just the way i looked at
[1:29:03] him because he was my dad he was my hero
[1:29:06] but uh you know my father
[1:29:08] my father
[1:29:09] first and foremost was a christian
[1:29:12] he was a gentle loving father a great
[1:29:15] friend
[1:29:17] and he loved the lord
[1:29:20] i know that the lord loved him too
[1:29:21] though
[1:29:22] the lord took care of my dad through
[1:29:24] many many many many trials and errors
[1:29:27] and and all that it gives me comfort in
[1:29:29] knowing that my dad is he's in a better
[1:29:31] place now
[1:29:33] i know that he has no more pain and he's
[1:29:35] not suffering anymore
[1:29:37] and i thank god for that
[1:29:42] and i also know that he's up there with
[1:29:43] my my my nana and my tata
[1:29:47] and my dias that passed on before and
[1:29:50] the other loved ones that are passed on
[1:29:52] my cousins everybody that's up there i
[1:29:53] know that made it to the other side i
[1:29:55] know my dad's up there with him
[1:29:58] so uh my dad he raised us to be
[1:30:01] christians
[1:30:02] to go to church to pray to read the
[1:30:04] bible he taught us how to rely on the
[1:30:07] lord for everything that we needed
[1:30:10] um
[1:30:12] of course he also taught me how to hunt
[1:30:14] and to fish
[1:30:16] and
[1:30:17] to load bullets and stuff like that is
[1:30:20] definitely his passion
[1:30:22] but
[1:30:23] i think the most important lesson he
[1:30:24] ever taught me
[1:30:26] was to not be a quitter
[1:30:29] i i
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:30:31] i struggled with that at the beginning
[1:30:33] but you know
[1:30:35] i look back now and i think that me
[1:30:37] going and following through with things
[1:30:38] was because my dad didn't like quitters
[1:30:43] my dad
[1:30:44] my dad had a lot of wisdom
[1:30:47] and a lot of patience
[1:30:49] he had a lot of patience
[1:30:52] i know that me and my brothers and my
[1:30:54] sisters
[1:30:54] you know we put my dad through a lot
[1:30:58] and uh
[1:30:59] i wish i could take all that back but i
[1:31:02] believe
[1:31:04] that it was god's plan
[1:31:07] and it was god's instrument was my dad
[1:31:09] to teach us and bring us up
[1:31:12] and uh correct us and raise us and i
[1:31:14] know that my dad did a wonderful job
[1:31:17] and i was blessed i was blessed to have
[1:31:19] my dad
[1:31:20] my wonderful father for 52 years
[1:31:24] and i love him and i miss him i miss him
[1:31:26] so much
[1:31:28] and i know you know
[1:31:30] i just look around i know he left a
[1:31:32] great legacy
[1:31:34] very much you know he left a legacy of
[1:31:37] love and family
[1:31:40] and uh
[1:31:42] my dad he uh he really enjoyed
[1:31:44] fellowship with his kids
[1:31:47] he would just love us to come and visit
[1:31:49] my son my son would go visit him all the
[1:31:50] time
[1:31:52] you know spend a lot of time with him
[1:31:54] and i used to love sitting there
[1:31:55] spending a lot of time with my dad
[1:31:58] but uh i really think that my dad
[1:32:01] really loved his grandchildren
[1:32:03] and
[1:32:04] and his great-grandchildren you know he
[1:32:06] was he was
[1:32:08] he uh
[1:32:10] showed a lot of love to everybody i
[1:32:11] guess that everybody that knew him
[1:32:13] um
[1:32:15] loved my father too because you know he
[1:32:17] put off that love to everybody else
[1:32:21] oh
[1:32:22] my father will always be with me
[1:32:25] and everything that i do every time i go
[1:32:26] to church i think of my dad
[1:32:28] i sing a song a christian song i think
[1:32:30] of my dad
[1:32:32] when i read my bible i think of my dad
[1:32:35] when i go hunting and fishing i know
[1:32:37] it's going to be on my heart

[1:33:22] my thought to charlie
[1:33:23] and his life
[1:33:26] i wrote some stuff down but um
[1:33:30] you know it's really hard to
[1:33:32] put my grandfather into words
[1:33:35] like
[1:33:36] what he meant to all of us
[1:33:38] what he meant to
[1:33:41] us as his grandchildren his brothers
[1:33:44] his uh his wife my grandma
[1:33:48] um
[1:33:50] you know i hear every everything that

[1:33:55] and my dad you know and i can't it's
[1:33:57] just
[1:33:58] you can't help but think of you know all
[1:34:00] the
[1:34:03] all the great memories that
[1:34:04] i got to share with him we all got to
[1:34:06] share with him you know
[1:34:08] um
[1:34:11] there's one thing for sure about my
[1:34:12] grandfather is that
[1:34:14] he was different um
[1:34:17] he he was different there was just
[1:34:21] hit the way he loved people the way he
[1:34:25] would make every single person that ever
[1:34:27] crossed paths with him feel special
[1:34:29] um
[1:34:30] there's just that's not something that
[1:34:32] everybody can say that they do
[1:34:35] you know
[1:34:37] i told my wife
[1:34:38] um my wife letty
[1:34:40] i had a conversation with her about it
[1:34:42] and
[1:34:44] you know
[1:34:45] it's really difficult
[1:34:49] to pass away
[1:34:50] and be liked by everybody that ever
[1:34:54] had any interaction with you but i know
[1:34:56] that was that was the interpretation of
[1:34:58] everybody that knew him of my
[1:35:00] grandfather
[1:35:01] that he was just great
[1:35:03] he loved differently he talked
[1:35:05] differently
[1:35:06] and anybody who ever got to hear him
[1:35:08] laugh he laughed differently
[1:35:10] you know it's just
[1:35:12] you know i heard my theo talk about
[1:35:14] walmart super walmart
[1:35:16] all of my cousins we can all
[1:35:18] every any any all of my cousins can all
[1:35:21] you know attest to that that
[1:35:23] he loved to go shopping that was his
[1:35:25] favorite thing to do my thoughts i loved
[1:35:28] to go places he left to go to the store
[1:35:30] didn't matter what it was for
[1:35:32] if it was something that my grandma
[1:35:33] grandma needed if it was something that
[1:35:35] he needed
[1:35:36] he wanted to go and he didn't want to go
[1:35:39] by himself he wanted all his grandkids
[1:35:40] to go even if that meant sitting in the
[1:35:42] back of his truck and it was 110 degrees
[1:35:45] outside
[1:35:47] he all wanted us to go and that's just
[1:35:48] how my grandfather was he
[1:35:51] he really
[1:35:52] truly lived off of love that was his
[1:35:56] thing he didn't have any hate in his
[1:35:58] heart
[1:35:59] didn't matter what anybody did to him my
[1:36:01] grandfather he loved you he forgave you
[1:36:04] he
[1:36:05] had no hard feelings towards you that's
[1:36:07] just how he was
[1:36:09] and there's not mary i don't i don't
[1:36:10] know very many people like that he's one

[1:38:35] and his dad and his mom
[1:38:38] but
[1:38:40] anyways
[1:38:41] thank you
[1:38:51] hello everybody um i said i wrote down a
[1:38:54] few words from my dad to tell you a
[1:38:56] little bit about him
[1:38:59] see if i can get through this one of the
[1:39:01] first earliest memories i have of my
[1:39:03] father involves
[1:39:05] him loving my mom
[1:39:08] watching him kiss and hold her tightly
[1:39:11] inspired me and my brother
[1:39:13] here to
[1:39:14] try to pull him apart playfully
[1:39:18] we've always fought for my mom's
[1:39:20] attention
[1:39:22] but uh
[1:39:26] we're always competing for my mom's
[1:39:27] attention however that's really
[1:39:29] revealing of how my
[1:39:31] my first memories of him is how deeply
[1:39:33] he loved my mother
[1:39:38] in the years that follow my father and i
[1:39:40] would uh scour the deserts for mormon
[1:39:43] tea
[1:39:44] and hunt rabbits for food for our family
[1:39:47] so
[1:39:48] it seems like kind of comedy he's like
[1:39:50] taught us all how to hunt and fish and
[1:39:53] gather
[1:39:55] when we moved to arizona
[1:39:59] i love following my father to his work
[1:40:01] watching him build various structures
[1:40:03] with great skill and care
[1:40:06] his attention to detail was impeccable
[1:40:10] and
[1:40:11] his precision was manifested in every
[1:40:14] aspect of his life
[1:40:16] from the sacred geometry of a family
[1:40:19] home
[1:40:21] to the composition of a tiny bullet
[1:40:23] however it wasn't always
[1:40:26] business
[1:40:28] my truck my uh my dad also loved western
[1:40:32] films like playing eastwood
[1:40:35] uh we we uh
[1:40:38] we certainly
[1:40:40] tried to channel that his talent
[1:40:43] as we shot soda cans out in the desert
[1:40:46] i don't know if you guys did that with
[1:40:48] my dad but that was like his thing
[1:40:51] many nights me and my father would uh
[1:40:53] take long take the longest way home
[1:40:56] i never understood it
[1:40:59] then why my man would make a 30 minute
[1:41:02] journey
[1:41:03] i have a five minute drive
[1:41:06] but i get to know i get to know it now
[1:41:09] that all he wanted was more time to talk
[1:41:12] to listen
[1:41:13] to be together
[1:41:16] stealing these moments making a
[1:41:17] connection
[1:41:22] although the the loss of my father was
[1:41:26] impacted my family greatly
[1:41:28] and there will forever be a child-shaped
[1:41:30] hole in this world
[1:41:33] i have no regrets
[1:41:37] this community has been elevated
[1:41:39] by his relentless love
[1:41:42] and his internal impact
[1:41:45] that's all i have
[1:41:46] thank you guys for being here for me and
[1:41:48] my family
[1:41:56] good evening
[1:41:58] bear with me i'm not the best reader um
[1:42:01] but i love my father tremendously and
[1:42:04] i'm going to miss him
[1:42:08] good evening thank you guys for coming
[1:42:09] to my father memorial service
[1:42:12] losing my father has been the hardest
[1:42:13] thing i've ever had to deal with today's
[1:42:15] a hard day but it's also celebration of
[1:42:18] my father's love life and his love
[1:42:21] his love for his parents
[1:42:23] his love for his brothers and sisters
[1:42:24] his love for his wife his love for his
[1:42:26] children his love for his grandchildren
[1:42:29] and his great-grandchildren
[1:42:31] what i want us to most remember about my
[1:42:33] dad is his love
[1:42:35] how he loved all of us individually in a
[1:42:38] special way
[1:42:42] we are gathered here in this church
[1:42:43] tucson tabernacle because my father was
[1:42:45] a godly man
[1:42:47] who loved the lord
[1:42:48] his walk with jesus begins with his
[1:42:50] parent his parents manuel sotelo
[1:42:54] and teresa sotelo manuel sotelo was a
[1:42:57] cowboy who became a preacher
[1:43:00] charissa sotelo was a kind soul
[1:43:04] known for always making sure her kids
[1:43:05] were in church
[1:43:07] no matter what
[1:43:09] my dad always taught us that my non-end
[1:43:11] my thoughtless prayers
[1:43:13] always came before the throne of the
[1:43:15] lord
[1:43:16] and
[1:43:17] they always took care of
[1:43:19] him and us
[1:43:22] as a young man my dad was a wild man
[1:43:25] one thing my dad liked was fast cars and
[1:43:27] street racing
[1:43:28] one time he was racing and he fell out
[1:43:31] of his car and got drunk it's a miracle
[1:43:34] he wasn't badly hurt
[1:43:36] but it shows that the lord always
[1:43:38] was with him
[1:43:40] even when he was in the world
[1:43:42] there's even stories of him peeling out
[1:43:44] of the church parking lot
[1:43:46] when i would ask him about this
[1:43:48] he would shake his head and he would
[1:43:50] cover his face
[1:43:54] to talk about my dad you have to talk
[1:43:56] about the love of his life teresa sotelo
[1:43:58] the first time
[1:44:00] my mom ever saw my dad was in a work
[1:44:03] when he when he was working at a lucky's
[1:44:05] grocery store
[1:44:07] he was helping the older lady out with
[1:44:09] her groceries
[1:44:12] despite not knowing him
[1:44:13] at the time a voice um sorry
[1:44:17] i'm a little laid out with her groceries
[1:44:21] um sorry guys
[1:44:27] despite not knowing him at the time a
[1:44:29] voice
[1:44:30] said told her this
[1:44:33] this is your husband
[1:44:34] she sang down in her seat so he wouldn't
[1:44:37] see her
[1:44:38] after after officially meeting
[1:44:42] each other and going to the movies with
[1:44:44] some friends my dad fell in love with my
[1:44:46] mom he called her every day for two
[1:44:48] weeks later he asked her to marry him
[1:44:51] they were married 53 years
[1:44:55] with their new marriage my mom inherited
[1:44:57] my dad's two youngest brothers
[1:44:59] who were more like his oldest sons
[1:45:02] timothy and samuel sotelo
[1:45:05] my mom says three days after their
[1:45:07] wedding night my theo sam was sleeping
[1:45:10] in their bed between them
[1:45:13] he was five years old at the time and
[1:45:15] was very attached to my dad
[1:45:22] for those of you who know me you
[1:45:24] probably know me as a fighter as a boxer
[1:45:27] i can i can say that i am because of my
[1:45:30] dad
[1:45:31] when i was young i i was a wrestler but
[1:45:34] one day my dad saw me boxing my cousins
[1:45:36] in the backyard
[1:45:38] and he said you're a fighter so he found
[1:45:40] a boxing gym and started taking me there
[1:45:44] i lived in that boxing gym my dad was
[1:45:46] always in my corner some of you might
[1:45:49] even know my dad
[1:45:50] as a boxing coach he was a corner man
[1:45:53] for a lot of amateur and professional
[1:45:54] boxing matches
[1:46:00] even when i did wrong my dad was always
[1:46:02] there to support me through all my
[1:46:04] through all my trials
[1:46:06] i think out of all of his kids i needed
[1:46:08] him the most
[1:46:10] i think other
[1:46:18] i think other parents would have given
[1:46:19] up on me
[1:46:23] he was always he always made me feel
[1:46:25] good enough
[1:46:27] and i knew at the end i was he was very
[1:46:29] proud of me
[1:46:32] he was always someone that i could
[1:46:34] celebrate my victories with
[1:46:37] he was not afraid to give me correction
[1:46:40] and he could do it with very few words
[1:46:44] i remember in elementary i got into a
[1:46:46] fight at school
[1:46:48] he came and picked me up and on the way
[1:46:50] home he didn't say anything to me
[1:46:52] and right before he went inside
[1:46:54] he just told me i'm disappointed in you
[1:46:57] that hurt me more than all the spanx he
[1:46:59] said he could have gave me
[1:47:03] that's how my dad
[1:47:04] would give correction
[1:47:07] a big part of my dad's life was the
[1:47:08] accident that happened in
[1:47:11] april of 1992
[1:47:13] two days after the funeral of my nana
[1:47:17] my dad fell off the roof and fractured
[1:47:20] while fixing the cooler
[1:47:28] and he fractured his knee i remember
[1:47:30] coming home from school and finding
[1:47:32] ambulance and fire trucks in the front
[1:47:34] yard i remember my dad laying on the
[1:47:36] side of the yard screaming
[1:47:39] he had completely shattered his knee
[1:47:41] this was devastating to my dad
[1:47:44] he was badly
[1:47:46] he was bad
[1:47:47] bedridden for very very very very long
[1:47:50] time
[1:47:52] and he became very depressed the
[1:47:55] accident had taken away his ability to
[1:47:57] walk to work to provide for his family
[1:48:01] and to be the
[1:48:07] working man he had always been i
[1:48:09] remember finding my my father in his
[1:48:11] wheelchair
[1:48:12] crying on the side of the yard
[1:48:15] it was the first time i ever seen my dad
[1:48:16] cry
[1:48:19] he told me to leave and i did
[1:48:24] but i wish i would have ran to him and
[1:48:26] gave him a hug
[1:48:30] i was angry with god
[1:48:35] before letting this happen to my dad i
[1:48:37] was angry with god for all the pain
[1:48:39] it caused my dad and and my family
[1:48:43] i thought it was a curse looking back
[1:48:45] now i could see that god did this to
[1:48:48] work on my dad
[1:48:49] to give him more patience and make him
[1:48:52] more loving
[1:48:54] before this my dad had
[1:48:56] been hard on us and back in the day it
[1:49:00] was common to whip your kids as
[1:49:02] discipline
[1:49:03] i'm sure we needed the discipline but my
[1:49:06] two older siblings god got it harder
[1:49:10] the hardness kept my dad
[1:49:12] from being as close to them
[1:49:18] as he could have been
[1:49:20] the accident softened him
[1:49:22] it helped my dad heal these
[1:49:24] relationships
[1:49:25] it helped
[1:49:26] it allowed my dad to love more deeply
[1:49:29] and to trust in god more
[1:49:33] a special thing that i got to witness
[1:49:38] was how my dad
[1:49:40] took care of his dad after my nana
[1:49:42] passed away
[1:49:43] my dad would hang out with
[1:49:45] with him all the time and pick him up
[1:49:48] and take him to all his doctor's
[1:49:49] appointments
[1:49:52] he would go with his walker and i would
[1:49:56] help load my tata's wheelchair in into
[1:49:59] the back of the truck
[1:50:01] then i would sit between
[1:50:03] the two of them
[1:50:05] as we would drive
[1:50:08] when i looked back i took these moments
[1:50:10] for granted
[1:50:12] but now i can see what a beautiful thing
[1:50:15] to witness my dad's selflessness
[1:50:18] towards his father
[1:50:21] like my dad was connected to his dad
[1:50:24] i was connected to my father
[1:50:26] i could feel when my dad was happy or
[1:50:29] sad
[1:50:31] i knew when he was confident and even
[1:50:33] scared
[1:50:39] my dad's last days we spent a lot of
[1:50:41] time my dad's last days we spent a lot
[1:50:43] of time at the hospital
[1:50:45] i spent a lot of time
[1:50:46] on the phone with him
[1:50:48] we were we were allowed to visit but we
[1:50:50] weren't allowed to to be in his room or
[1:50:53] to touch him the way we wanted to touch
[1:50:55] him
[1:50:56] there's a lot of healing in the touch
[1:51:02] we couldn't be by his side or touch him
[1:51:04] like we wanted to
[1:51:06] while
[1:51:07] while he was there
[1:51:09] he would call me at 3 4 in the morning i
[1:51:12] stayed on the phone with my dad a lot
[1:51:16] he would just lay the phone right here
[1:51:17] and
[1:51:18] i would listen to him
[1:51:20] and we would just share silence together
[1:51:22] whenever he got nervous we would talk to
[1:51:24] each other
[1:51:29] from our fighting experience i knew how
[1:51:31] to keep him calm i made sure to stay on
[1:51:33] the phone with him
[1:51:35] i knew we were in for a hard fight i
[1:51:37] wanted to bring him home
[1:51:41] during this time i heard him pray for
[1:51:43] all of you
[1:51:48] i heard him communicate with the lord
[1:51:51] he asked the lord to bless
[1:51:53] all of his children
[1:51:54] grandchildren and great-grandchildren
[1:51:57] he brought you all before the lord
[1:52:03] while he was in the hospital i had a
[1:52:05] dream
[1:52:06] that
[1:52:07] me and a mexican kid
[1:52:09] were soldiers and we were in the
[1:52:11] wilderness
[1:52:12] we had been given instruction on how to
[1:52:14] get home so we were heading back up a
[1:52:16] huge mountain
[1:52:18] as we reached
[1:52:20] as we reached the top of top i
[1:52:24] i realized
[1:52:26] i couldn't see a path forward
[1:52:28] i look back
[1:52:37] and
[1:52:38] and saw how far we had come
[1:52:41] and i
[1:52:42] got scared and i knelt down
[1:52:45] this mexican kid he tapped me on my
[1:52:47] shoulder
[1:52:49] and he told me
[1:52:52] we need to get over the ridge
[1:52:54] i followed him over the ridge and then
[1:52:56] we saw a city lights the city lights
[1:53:00] i remember i remember we were both
[1:53:02] relieved the next day i told my dad
[1:53:04] about the dream and that i thought
[1:53:07] it was about him
[1:53:09] about us trying to get him home i said
[1:53:12] to him
[1:53:13] i was with this mexican kid
[1:53:16] but he was way more mexican than me
[1:53:18] my dad said to me
[1:53:20] i am more mexican than you
[1:53:26] hmm
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:32] i thought i was going to bring him home
[1:53:38] but now i think he's telling me to keep
[1:53:39] on moving forward
[1:53:43] my dad fought a beautiful fight he
[1:53:44] fought hard
[1:53:46] i'm proud to be his son

[1:53:54] from my father

[1:54:04] the thing that i'm
[1:54:05] the thing that i'm going to take away
[1:54:07] from my father
[1:54:09] is he wasn't the same man in his 20s
[1:54:12] that he was in his 40s
[1:54:14] he wasn't the same man in his 40s that
[1:54:16] he was in his 60s he kept growing
[1:54:19] the older he got the more love he seemed
[1:54:22] to have
[1:54:23] the more forgiveness
[1:54:25] he seemed to have
[1:54:26] i know
[1:54:27] one day
[1:54:28] when i
[1:54:29] am at the end
[1:54:31] that my dad is going to tap me on the
[1:54:33] shoulder and he's going to lead me over
[1:54:35] the ridge into that city

[1:56:04] but you know his love for use never
[1:56:06] changed
[1:56:08] but it's because he knew jesus christ
