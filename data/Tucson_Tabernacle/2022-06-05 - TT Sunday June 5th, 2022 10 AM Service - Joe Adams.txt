all he surrendered it all so that you and i could have everything that he has if you just share it with us because you were worthy but because he desired so and he said all therefore by doing this i'll make you worthy of it and through his shed blood and of all we have to say the father forgive me make things right and god he doesn't hold it against us and i appreciate that so much [Music] sometimes surrender is difficult but when you do surrender and god steps in what a change in your life so appreciate we have a couple of requests to bring to your attention sister martha we had prayed for her dad the other day he was going to have a biopsy on the spot on his nose and it did test positive for cancer but it was a mild form and but cancer is no different than any other disease or sickness to god he's the healer of all thy diseases so and sometimes in giving a prayer request and asking for prayer you're saying lord i believe i'm writing this down because i do believe when the saints of god pray you here and it takes an act of faith and god appreciates that he respects that so also we had asked prayer for sister mary ramirez just the other day she was in a lot of pain they took her back to the doctor to look over seems good and they found nothing wrong and brother tony let me know that she is feeling much better again today and um he always writes in his notes and to me especially and he says don't get older it's no fun but there's a promise of eternal life and that's where we stand up so keeping them in prayer also sister rebeccas and brennan had asked prayer for a trip she's going to be taking traveling mercies and also a situation at work so if you'll stand with me brother dan evans would you come and take these requests if you have a request and you would say lord sometimes sometimes we can't put it in words but god knows our hearts so just believe that again thank you let's pray heavenly father as we raise our hands lord knowing that there is a father there that sees the raised hands and lord as brother ann mentioned as these prayer requests were written down upon paper they were written knowing that there is a god that sees these requests and that is able to answer almighty god the one that created the heavens and the earth you are there for our requests and lord we humbly bring them up before you and ask lord that you'd hear us and father that you would answer in in your perfect way father thank you that there is a god and we know there is a god that does answer prayer and lord for this service we pray that you're with us father that that your will would be done here and lord that our desires in coming this morning would be met and father even now as our heads are bowed may our expectations rise for this service and father may the thoughts and that are upon our hearts come before you as a sweet smelling savor and lord you come back down with an answer this morning we pray be with us lord and father we give you the glory and we thank you and we love you in the name above all names of jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you you may be seated yesterday was a celebration of our sister carol batasi going to the place that we all desire to go to the other side to hear the testimonies and the things that were said and i just i didn't have a lot of interaction with her in the sense of thing but whenever i saw her and never we greeted one another there was such a sweetness about her a smile in her face and even in her eyes it just glowed out of her and and it was genuine it was just just thinking about that the other day in the times that we were so there's that joy of one crossing over another witness but also the the family that's going to miss her so but soon and very soon we're going to see the king and it'll be so sister barbara yarbrough has says please welcome my niece who has just moved here kendall arbergast so where is she welcome [Applause] i believe there they're staying at brother peter and sister lydia's place there so what time is dinner oh just kidding good to have you with us may the lord bless you so it's good to be known of god a child of god amen so this morning our brother joe adams and his wife sister jessica are here with us and sister jessica throat has been bothering her so she said tonight today she wouldn't be able to sing a special so i guess brother joe a little more time so they just got back from newfoundland and um they were up with brother joe and sister priscilla up there and had a good time so we'll let him have the liberty to minister what god has put on his heart so feel stan amazing grace how many knows it's the grace of god in your life how many appreciate the grace of god in your life amen [Music] amazing [Music] how grace the sound oh it's saved our wretch like me i once was lost but now i'm found i was blind but [Music] twas grace that taught my heart and grace my fears really how precious [Music] let's take a moment to praise him now praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god oh praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god amen you love the lord this morning i'll tell you it's just an honor to serve him to be in his presence this morning we just want to take a few minutes to greet you in the name of the lord it's great to be back with you we certainly enjoy ourselves when we come so thank you for the opportunity the invitation to come back and share what's on our heart we were just with your your daughter and son-in-law and certainly had a great time with them and our condolences go out to you sister baggett from the loss of your mother had that opportunity to meet with her a couple months ago and have dinner and just the stories after stories after story so you know we mourn the loss on this side right but we would never call them back to this life because now in a new body a well body rejoicing running on the streets made with gold and everything that she believed and trusted and hoped for now it's a reality and one day soon it's going to be our reality one day soon each of us are going to you know transfer over to that portal hopefully lord willing to be a body change the rapture of the church and we'll be able to meet again and see our loved ones but until that time we're going to keep pressing the battle on this side uh this morning yes musicians i don't have a special don't worry this morning i do want to speak to you uh on something that i'd studied out probably a couple of months ago and uh you know as you pray for services what how the lord would direct how the lord willing just kind of really felt the leadership to speak this this morning this would be a service that we want to if we give it a title it's called call to arms call to arms and not sure if any of you know but tomorrow is d-day so today is the eve of d-day where the troops are making preparation for what would be the largest amphibious military assault in history and today is the eve of that day and i just was sitting back there and i looked at that thought and i'm thinking and you're having me to speak on call to arms and so by the grace of god we're going to look at this this morning i have two parts of this service but i don't feel led to speak the second part what i like to do this evening is to speak to the young people i know that there may not be a whole lot of young people here this morning but if you would go out in the hedges highways byways bring the young people and encourage your young people to come back for service this evening and i'll have a thought on my heart the lord laid it upon me earlier this week said i want you to take us an evening service and i want you to direct that toward the youth of tucson tabernacle so by the grace of god we'll do that this evening so it doesn't let you over the folks off the hook no we're all young people right 18 in a 60 year old body 18 and a 80 year old body 18 and a 45 year old body some of you yeah amen that's right so everybody come back but i just want to kind of direct this to the young people but okay so now we'll just look here in our bibles first chronicles 12 we're going to look here in verse 1. it's a short scripture reading this morning as we're going to kind of gain our our foundation for the service this morning says now these are they that came to david in ziklag while he yet kept himself close because saul the son of kish and they were among the mighty men helpers of war and it goes down verse 2 they were armed with bows and can use both the right hand and the left hand and hurling stones and shooting arrows out of the bow even of saul's brethren of benjamin and then skip down to verse 8 because it just goes and it tells all the names of the mighty men of the gibeonites and it says and of the gadis they're separated themselves unto david into the whole to the witness men of might and men of war fit for the battle notice the type of people that were gathering themselves around david these were not lazy people these were not loafers these were men of might men fit for war men capable to do battle and it says they could handle the shield and a buckler whose faces were like faces of lions and who were as swift as rose upon the mountains god bless you you can have your seats this morning and as i said i want to speak to you on this little thought on call to arms and this phrase here called to arms it means a summons it's an invitation it's an appeal to undertake a particular course of action so this morning by the grace of god we're going to kind of look into that because i want to appeal to you to take a particular course of action now how many of you familiar with winston churchill winston churchill i had several quotes here that i'm just going to read because to me he's just a very very very uh unique individual he said i like a man who grins when he fights could you imagine fighting somebody who's smiling at you he's enjoying everything he's doing and he would say you may have to fight when there is no hope of victory because it is better to perish than to live as slaves now if we as sons and daughters of god can just let that quote resonate in our in our minds it's better to fight than live as slaves to the enemy he would also say there is at least one thing worse than fight with the allies and that's to fight without them and the final quote of winston churchill's he says we shall go forward together the road upwards is stony and they're upon our journey dark and dangerous valleys through which we have to make and fight our way but it is sure and certain that if we persevere and we shall persevere we shall come through these dark and dangerous valleys into a sunlight broader and more genuine and more lasting than mankind has ever known now i want you to apply that to the tabernacle apply that to where we are where you are as a church as a body the road forward we're going to go through it together the road forward it's going to be stony it's gonna be dark it's gonna be dangerous valleys but he says it's for certain that we're gonna persevere and we shall and we shall come through the dark and dangerous valleys into a sunlight broader and more genuine and more lasting than mankind has ever known amen that's just wonderful you know there's a hope there's a there's a hope for the church it's not always going to be the way it is currently right i think we have to keep our eyes and keep our minds focused on that that right now what we feel right now what we see right now how it is is not our permanent situation it's just a dark valley it's just a road that we're on but we're going to come into a sunlight a sunlight broader and more genuine and more lasting than the world has ever known so we're going to find our backdrop for this morning scripture we'll find it in first samuel is eight it says nevertheless verse 19. nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us so why do we find david garrison and men starting to gravitate or gravitate to david because we look here in 1st samuel 8 and verse 19 the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and they said naba we will have a king over us that we may also be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles the prophet of god will tell us in the message to reject the king he said it was a time that as in all times that the people has never wanted god to lead them they want their own leadership look church that spirit's still here they don't want the leadership of the holy spirit they want the leadership of a man he says but the people had come to a place where they they wanted to change this program the program of god having a prophet who would lead his people and they had looked upon the philistines in the malachis and the amorites and the hittites in all the nations of the world and they had seen that they had kings that ruled them and governed them and guided them and fought their battles and so forth and this seemed to be that israel wanted to pattern themselves like these kings and like these people if you notice when joshua was given a commission to go into the promised land that he was told to go in and destroy the philistines destroy the amalekites restore the amorites destroy the hittites destroy everything and now we find that instead of destroying all of them they cohabitated with them in so much that now they want to emulate their program and when we come out of denominations we were told to be you separate saith the lord but we find there's a spirit that's coming back into the ranks of the message where now we want somebody to rule over us just bear with me this morning we'll get through this first samuel 8 verse 1. now this is where it all gravitates from right here now we believe samuel was a man of god he was called to god he was a great prophet and it says and it came to pass when samuel was old and he made his son judges over israel now the name of the firstborn was joel in the name of the second was abbaya and they were judges in beersheba and his sons walk not in his ways just because you're a son of a prophet doesn't mean you're automatically guaranteed to follow the heritage of that prophet right these people had enough sense to believe that they had enough sense to realize that samuel your sons are not following the way that you are they don't believe the way that you believe it said but they turned aside after luker and they took bribes and they perverted judgment so they were doing things for their own ill gain and not following the standards and the statutes that this prophet samuel had set in place for the children of israel then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and they came to samuel and rhema and they said unto him behold thou art old and their sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like the nations see they looked at samuel they their eyes were on a man and they were looking at that man and they were not looking at the god who was leading that man but they were looking at that man and said there's no succession therefore make us a king see but if they would have been following the prophet they would have been following god through the prophet they knew that no matter what samuel if he died and went to the grave god was going to raise somebody else up because god's ordained way was for god to lead his children not man to lead his children the prophet of god will tell us this he says now and they said samuel your boys is not like you so we want you to go out and find us a king and anoint him and make us a people like the rest of the peoples of the world make us a people we want to be a church like the first baptist church of tucson you're not called to be that he said if you do that notice samuel begins to tell him if you do that the first thing you know is that he will call your sons from your home and make soldiers out of them and you go on and you can read down through first samuel eight but i'm gonna paraphrase it through the quote here and he tells what they're going to do he'll take your sons he'll take your daughters he'll make him this he'll make them that and do this he's going to have lordship over your people and they were never to have lordship over he says in the first thing you know that you'll find that he will call your sons from your home make soldiers out of them to run before his chariots and bear armors and spears and not only that but he will call your dollars to make bakers and bread and take them from from you to feed the army and besides that he'll take certain taxes off of you of your grain and all of your enemies and he will tax all that that to make certain government debts and so forth that had to be paid he's just he goes now he said i think you are all together making a mistake but when the people said it when they heard that they said but we still want to be like the rest of the people we still want a king now notice god was separating his people we are a separated people separated royal priesthood chosen generation that's who we are so never let us want to emulate some other church whether it be a message church whether it be a denominational church no matter what it may be may our focus be on sons of god are led by the spirit of god no matter how much samuel tried to persuade the people continued they went after him day and night we want a king we have been seven years without a pastor we want a king samuel you're dying we want a king there's nobody else in the church to assume the headship we want a king notice their eyes and their minds and everything that they used to make judgment with were skewed because they were looking at the physical countenance of a prophet in his age and a deterioration and him soon to be going to a grave and it didn't see the succession plan but god already had it in mind so we have to be careful as a body to make sure what we're asking for is in the will of god now i'm not saying that it's not in the will of god for this church to have a pastor i'm saying it's not in the will of god for this church to have the wrong pastor notice we want a king we want a man we want a man that we can say this is our god and this and brother baby says that has never been the will of god it never was the will of god nor ever will be the will of god for a man to rule over another god rules over man god is our ruler our king it's very very much a parallel of today because that man seems to have that same idea they don't seem to be able to grasp that god still rules man but man instead of man ruling over man so it used to be that we would point to the denominations well you know we would it was easy as messes believers we could point back well this denomination and that denomination but how many of you here ever you actually came out of a denomination how many of you here were just growing up in the message probably more hands that grew up in the message so no longer can we point it back to the denominations now we have to look at within our own ranks see the message is all that most of us has ever heard most of us has ever known and yet many churches today they don't want to stay with what the prophet of god said they have their own ideas they want to be like the rest of the people we need a headquarters we need somebody to have jurisdiction over us when we don't have a pastor they can send somebody in all these things they didn't want to accept the way god has ordained it now they have an intellectual understanding they don't have a god inspired ministry they they have their own ideas they have their own doctrines they have their own circle of influence and they feel like well this is it but we find that own idea and that own circle of influence all it does is separates the body it separates fellowship see they don't want to be led by the holy spirit they have intellectual giants today leading them versus the holy spirit leading them now the prophet of god taught us that every church in the pastor and every church is the sovereign head of that local body the pastors are sovereign he don't need man ruling over him and furthermore the man is the sovereign head of the body but every son and daughter of god is to be led by the spirit not by the man so let's make sure we bring a clarity to that because the last thing we want is to go ahead and prop a pastor up and then all of a sudden he tells you where you can go eat lunch what car you can buy what color it is how big a house you can buy and yet these are things that are going on within the ranks of the message you can't go to so-and-so special meetings because they don't believe like we believe they don't they don't they don't they don't and then we're starting to find that man begins to overlord the people versus guiding the people see they reject and notice now they didn't reject these people these believers are these pastors in these churches who have kind of gone this route they've not rejected william branham they not rejected a prophet but they rejected christ they rejected the holy ghost to leave the church now i understand this is a little bit different type of ministry for me this morning because you're used to my 100 miles an hour but i just felt like really just laying this in here this morning see they rejected christ they rejected the holy ghost which was sent to lead the church that was god's ordained method for the church to be led was god was going to lead the church to the holy spirit through a god-ordained pastor who was going to be led by the holy spirit and the people led by the spirit and then you find the continuity between what is being ministered and what is being received is in tune with what the spirit wants so that the church moves forward but we find here in first samuel 9 they decided they wanted to choose a man and god gave them the very desire of their heart they wanted a man they wanted a king they wanted to be like the rest of the churches and we find here in first samuel 9 and verse 1. now there was a man of a benjamin whose name was kish the son of abiel the son of zeorh the son of becker wrath and the son of hayah the benjamin a mighty man of power and he had a son whose name was saul notice now this is what they're looking at a choice young man a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodly a person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any other people he wasn't joe adams at five foot six no he was goodly he was probably six foot three you know all that i aspire to be in life man if i could add a cubic i'd add a couple cubics brother aaron to my stature but but we find here they looked at the outward appearance now god gave them this man because he knew in their heart this was what they were looking for to lead them they wanted someone who looked apart they wanted someone who was head and shoulders above the rest so that when they would say this is our king that it would strike fear in the other nations because their king stood above the rest and you have churches today this is my pastor this is where i go to church they're choosing the king after their own making versus when god is called to lead we find now then samuel took a vow of oil this is in first samuel 10 and 1 and he poured it upon his head and he kissed him and he said it is not because the lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance and in verse 5 and after that thou shalt come to the hill of god whereas there is a garrison of the philistines and they shall come to pass and when thou art come through there through the city the thou shall meet a company of prophets coming down from a high place with a sultry and a tablet and a pipe and a heart before them and they shall prophesy and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them notice what it says here and thou shall be turned into another man now i believe this is my personal belief that god did this and when he did this and allow saul to enter in to what would be the courts of a prophet or the the anointing of a prophet and he prophesied i believe in his own mind it elevated himself above everybody else because it says thou shalt be turned into another man and that word another there means strange he turned into a strange man no doubt here he is a peasant he's just a normal kid out tending the sheep looking for his father's sheep or whatever it was that he was looking for the horses or the asses or whatever it may be and yet he was as normal as any of us here today but yet when he was anointed king and then he not only was he anointed to be king but now he come on with the gift of prophecy it changed his whole mindset and now he lifted himself up in his own thinking and if you're not careful church that's what we find happens a lot of times god will take somebody and rear them up and place him behind the pulpit and yet because they get their own idea and that idea separates them from fellowship but what it does it exalts them in their own thinking and if they're not careful it exhausts them within their own local body and now they're up here look at my king look at my king look at my pastor look at man he's preaching something nobody else is preaching that should be a red flag that should be a re he's preaching something that nobody else has even thought of i'm sorry but we had a prophet there's nothing else that can be preached outside of the rims of this prophetic ministry that we've received otherwise he would still be on the scene revealing the mysteries revealing the the things that we have need of to carry us into a rapture but he said the only time that i will ever preach is when i'm mortal and god will not take me but when he's completely done with me with any man and so we find these men now have elevated themselves up they become strange see saul brother battle would say in demonology saul was considered one of the prophets think about the stigma that comes with that the status the prestige man you could gather people when you become one of the prophets you can gather people when you got some thought that nobody else is preaching and it begins to elevate elevate elevate elevate elevate and it's elevating the man it's not elevating christ it's building a kingdom not restoring the kingdom he says here in the rejected king see now the people does not seem to be satisfied with the way that god placed his church to be governed and to be controlled by the holy spirit they want somebody some man some denomination some certain people to govern the church that they will be able to throw so that they will not be able to throw themselves completely into god's hands to be spiritual to be led by the holy spirit they want somebody to do their religion for them somebody that would tell them just how to do it and all about it so this man seemed to suit the place exactly because he was very intellectual and a whole he said and it's a whole lot like today see we like to choose such people now if you want to find this quote this is in the rejected king paragraph 51 so you can make sure that what i'm preaching to you is from the message of the hour he says now we like to choose such a people too to control our churches control the church of god not that i have to say against it but just merely to make a point that this is not it was not it never will be the will of god for such to be god is to rule the people to govern each individual that's god's leadership but we find in the first church age brother bannon was saying the first age there came a strange doctrine that creeped into the church and that was a doctrine of the nicolaitanism now this word that was in revelations 2 6 but thou has thou hateth the deeds of the nicholas's which i also hate and when you look up what the word nicolaitan means in the third definition it means destruction of the people so the doctrine the deeds of the nicolaitanism was not to elevate the people was not to edify the people it was not to build up the body of christ but it was to for the destruction of the local church and he says now if you read acts 2 4 the way that some do you can read it this way now listen how he reads it now when the day of pentecost was fully come there came a priest with a wafer and he said stick out your tongue we want to have communion this morning i'll come on we'll say stick out your tongue and we'll place a wafer on your tongue this is what he's saying stick out your tongue and he placed a wafer upon it and him and he himself drank some wine notice he'd only give you the opportunity to drink the wine he himself drank the wine and said now you've received the holy ghost now you have received the holy ghost he said that's exactly what nicotine nicolaitanism has come see they say never mind the word of god you can't understand it we have to interpret it for you we have to be we're the great spiritual ones we're the ministry we have to be able to explain it for you and interpret it for you furthermore the bible they say the bible is not finished it has to change with the times and we will tell you what those changes are how contrary that is to the word of god that emphatically states let god's word be true and every man's word be a lie so church it behooves us to discern the spirit within the church see he says he says now so the people are led by people who presume to be what they are not they say that they are vikers of christ but what they are is the antichrist now i'm not calling anybody antichrist but what i'm saying is i'm telling you to discern the spirit for what we see then you're seeing it repeat today you're seeing it repeat today god takes this man but he leaves his spirit satan takes his man but his spirit remains behind so nico nicolaitanism destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and makes them leaders overlords instead of servants see saul became an overlord he began to dictate what this one did and that one did and this one in that one and he wasn't a servant but that was what the people wanted now notice a pastor if we would call it this in this aspect he's a shepherd he's not an overlord he's a he's a shepherd he is to smell like the sheep he is to live with the sheep he is to eat with the sheep he is to sleep with the sheep the bible will say he's the gatekeeper therefore he lays within the gate the open door the gate there he lays within it and there's no sheep that can get out but what he first comes across the shepherd and there's no wolf that can get in but what at first has to come through the shepherd who is the gate to the sheephole what am i telling you i'm telling you that the holy ghost is the gate to the sheepfold there's no false teaching that can come through the church as long as a church is being led by the holy ghost and no can they pull any of the sheep out because the holy ghost is there to protect and a god called pastor an anointed man who knows that that's his position and he knows that he is following the spirit of god he is protecting the sheep he is protecting from false teachings he is protecting from man's ideas that begin to pull on people and entice people in poor people see he is not to be an overlord of the sheep he is not to fleece the sheep for his own ill gain but he is to provide for the sheep he is to guide the sheep he is to protect the sheep and he is to serve the sheep but nicotia nicolaitanism which is the organizing of human government within the church notice organizing human government within the church to legislate the people we have to be careful especially in a church who does not have a pastor that you got god called men who are still leading the church not legislators not overlords you got deacons who are god inspired god called deacons who are in harmony one with another who says i can't wait to let go of the reigns of the church when god sends us a godly man because the reigns will never be intended for man to hold on to it and yet it know we know that it takes man to keep things together but what we're saying here if there's no uh negotiation where is a human government we don't want human governments within the body of the church we want sons of god feel led to be led by the spirit of god now within order keep everything within church order everything in life deacons in their role trustees and narrow the ministry of ministries in their role and the people in their role and as long as we stay in our prospective roles god can add and god can lead the church so we must work together and we must discern any spirit of nicotinicism which is a denominational spirit that tries to work within the framework of the church and we find today man and when i say we find today when i say little phrases like that i'm not speaking to the nominations i come out of denominations 20 plus years ago i'm not speaking about that i'm speaking about within the ranks of what we believe as the message of the hour we find man today that wants to control others when you have people writing to a headquarters who shall i marry well whoever your heart falls in love with no they're getting permission who shall i marry where should i move my family where can i go to church and they're writing a headquarters god never intended for his body to write headquarters to try to get direction he is the headquarters sons of god are led by the spirit you pray about that and you fall on your knees and you begin to seek god and say god i need your leadership god i need your action i need your direction in my life i need to know where you want me to go i need to know where you want me to uproot my family and place them so that we can grow in the admonition of god where we can be plugged into a local assembly god i want to be led i don't want to have to go ask permission but we find that's the case in a lot of churches today that's the case with a lot of believers today that's the case they'll tell you what tape that you must play at what time you must push play don't get quiet on me it's okay i know where i'm standing you got to listen to a certain sermon at a certain time but what about god inspired preaching what about preaching that comes down and god knows you've been dealing with the situation and god's bringing somebody in that can minister to that need particularly to your need what about that there's nothing wrong with push and play i push play on the way here i push play on the plane i push play in the airport i push play when i'm in my studies studying i pushed play when i'm at the gym working out i pushed play when i worked at the hospital i pushed play but i'm not here today to push play i'm here to preach the inspired word of god because that's god's ordained way don't call headship don't call headquarters you should already caught on headquarters before you came you should have been in prayer notice now they want to tell you some churches want to tell you who you can and who you can't fellowship with you can't fellowship with this group and they don't fellowship with this group and none of their people fellowship with this group i don't know church but that doesn't seem to be the spirit of christ to me you know what the prophet of god was a prime example of being able to cross denominational barriers the man one of his best friends was a rank center bert call and yet he saw fit to go hunting sleep with the man in a tent and day after day after day he didn't dis fellowship him because he wasn't a believer but our attitudes i wonder sometimes that we have gotten so high and mighty so lifted up so self-righteous that we can't even fellowship with one another and i don't say it's our fault i believe it's because the leadership now begins to push these things on the people and the people don't know what to believe and the these pastors are holding the people by fear pastors are not overlords they're servants brother says now this is in the message the sermon of the spirit he says take your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group just so you know that's a 1960 message it's past the 50s i know it's three years before the seals but nevertheless he was a prophet before the seals he was a prophet after the seals you either believe the word or you don't believe the word notice what he says notice don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group discern his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in heart then you got fellowship one with another you're working for one great cause that's the cause of christ i think that's absolutely true but man do they want to tell you who you can who you can't listen to and if you go somewhere else and hear somebody else then you're committing spiritual adultery come on church we don't believe this do we i've told people in the past that i was coming to tucson tabernacle to preach sorry i can't come i'm like shame on you and shame on the leadership i haven't seen you in two years and you can't come and hear me preach because of some leadership men are afraid if somebody's got something to say that's going to hold the people in my my mind if you got something to say and god's called you for that you ain't got to worry about losing sheep because you can't feed them no if you got something to feed them fear is never going to hold permanently understand fear will never hold permanently eventually the fear will be broken off and people will come out but if you want to hold people you want to keep your congregation feed them the word of god preach them the power of the holy spirit preach in the dynamics of the mess of the hour preach them a living god don't put no dead painted pitcher or some fire painted fire up there and expect them to get worn by preach them a living god preach them signs and wonders preach in the supernatural and you'll see god vindicate and you'll see people gravitate to it don't be an overlord be a servant to the people gather the people in by the word of god notice this is nothing more than a spirit of nicolaitism denominationalism hold people by fear versus letting them go that's one thing my pastor has never done he never said joe you can't go here you can't go here you can't go here you can go here now since i decided to go full time or not i decided god led me to go full time we've had invitation after invitation we're booked out all the way to october beyond my wildest dreams never once that i had to call my pastor and say can i get your permission to go to these meetings no because i'm led by the spirit of god god led me to take that invitation now if there was an emergency in the church and i went and the pastor said look i would wish that you would may reschedule yes that's a different situation so now brother man says now let this go real deep is this okay this morning a little bit different but i hope it just settles into you this morning let me see how much time i got plenty of time don't don't walk out on me just yet but he says let this go real deep under the fifth rib on the left side left side when a man is anointed with the spirit of god his habits his actions and everything is god moving in him and he says sometimes he's misjudged people want to stream into our services brother aaron and they misjudge our services because of the freedom that's within our church but every action every moving is of the holy spirit there's nothing out of line he says now when a man is anointed of the spirit of god this is in discernment of the spirit paragraph 41 he's got the action of god and the action of god is to never break us up the action of god is to never break us up it's never to this fellowship so when you find man who's throwing bombs and causing divides discern the spirit that can't be the spirit of our lords and what i'm telling you this morning though it's on the auspice of the message though he has a great following though he may seem to have inspired messages discern the spirit of the man he says now it's never to break us up the action of god is to draw us together for we are one in christ jesus and god's purpose is to bring us together to love one another and this ain't some sixties song either this is really a prophet of god telling us that perfect love is the only thing that'll enter in and how can you have perfect love when you're causing division how can we have perfect love when we won't allow ourselves to fellowship because maybe you see something i don't see or maybe you see something completely an error maybe god sends you to fix that one and or maybe use you to bring that one out of the era but because of the boundaries and because of the preaching because of what's been stipulated out there that you can't have fellowship now we pull back and we just stay with our little group that's not god's intentions see men today they're not satisfied brother aaron with the way god ordained his church god started his church the way he wanted it he's going to finish his church the way he started it now how do we find that church i'm glad you asked turn your bibles ephesians 4 and verse 9. because i know y'all had questions in your mind well brother joe how did he start the church there was no recorded devices there was no magnetic tapes there was no cds there was no dvds there was none of these things back in that day they may have had pappas and some kind of ink and they wrote things down but listen what the listen what he says here in ephesians and this is paul first church age messenger now that he ascended this is verse 9 now that he ascended what is he but or what is but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles he didn't even put the prophet in the first in the first place notice we he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now there is an s behind every one of those not one standalone apostle who's going to live for eternity on earth and set up every church that's been known to man there's not one standalone prophet but we believe we've see we received a major prophet in this hour and there will not be another major prophet but the gift of prophecy still works within the body or this scripture is wrong notice the gift of evangelist an s pastors s teachers with an s for what for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come into the unity of the faith in the knowledge of the son of man or son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ see god ordained this way now out here in arizona you probably got more tape churches than they have any other state and i'm not bashing tape churches but i'm pointing you back to the scripture god ordained this method god look god ordained this you can have the prophet ministry in your home in your car on your job in your quiet time you have that it set your your possession over 1200 sermons on a little discard you can place push play anytime you want but you can also have evangelists you can also have pastors you can also have teachers and you can also have apostles because all of these is what edifies the body not any singular gift so what we're preaching on today is the call of arms i'm calling you into action to fight to keep this message pure keep it the way the prophet of god established it and ordained it not hybridized with man's ideas so it's we're called to arms we're summoned to take up the cause to rightly divide the word of god to discern the spirit that's working within the church see how long was this to last till we all come into the unity of the faith not until your favorite preacher came by no until he all comes into the unity of the faith to the knowledge of the son of god unto the perfect man until we come into the stature of the fullness of christ otherwise until we receive our body change god establish a five-fold ministry for your perfection for your perfection for your perfection for our unity because we're all going to be one it's a body notice but man today claims he's got a better way he's got a better program and that is to be like our sister churches or denominational harvest that we came out of now we want to headquarters and we want to just do this and do this and i'm not pointing back all the voice of god in that aspect not at all but we have within the ranks of the message there's paparusia movement there's a two-soul movement there's a deity movement there's a a thunder movement there's all these movements and they all have a headquarters but god never intended if the prophet of god ever intended to set up those type of headquarters he would have done it when he was here he would have ordained a joe coleman to set up the headquarters of thunders he wouldn't ordain a level to headquarter the parisian movement he would have done that himself but we find after him going off the scene the holy spirit was still on the scene but man began to choose man leadership and not the holy spirit leadership and now you find you got these different fractions and factions in the message and they have their own little camps and we got all these camps and there's so many camps and if you go to africa there's even more camps in africa there's the elohim movement some that claim they're elohim himself they got some that can speak you in and speak you out some that have all this power and all this authority but where did god ever put that in a man he never placed it in his prophet and if he never place it in his prophet who are we to take that burden upon our shoulders and say you can have it and you can't i'm so glad that man is not in control of my life is this okay this morning see what are they trying to do they're trying it's the spirit of nicolaitanism is trying to denominate the bride but notice though they would never fill out the paperwork or charter for a new denomination they do it in their spirit they do it with their doctrines they do it in their preaching they do it with their ideas but this bride how many of your bride this morning i'm going to say it like the prophet of god said this bride will not be denominated otherwise she's not going to be manhandled she's not going to be manhandled so when you find a man trying to handle you his own way telling you what you can and what you can't do you just go ahead and get away from the man well you say well brother joe brother brown said if the man gets off the word then you leave the man well man is off the word when he begins to try to handle you with his own mind in his own ways in his own ideas if he's not following the leadership of the holy ghost you have permission by the authority of the word of god to leave that man at that point in time brother says in christ is the mystery of god revealed paragraph 4 4 12. now no denomination but the revelation of his mystery see no denomination the revelation god is not known by the nomination he is known by revelation now can the church say revelation man y'all are weak this morning come on revelation we're gonna do it one more time because three i heard that three is is perfection revelation oh man there is life in the tucson tabernacle notice he says now god is not known by denomination but by revelation he says god in his body christ and christ in his body the bride god made manifest in christ and christ made manifest in the bride and as god took from the body of adam the woman and she fell then god took from the body of christ his flesh his body which is the word and is bringing a bride out that won't fall by the nomination or creed no sir but she is coming back with their pure unadulterated word of god being manifested i'm here to tell you let it ring out again this bride will not be denominated she is coming out because all that god was he poured it into christ and all that christ was he pours it into his body and that body can't be manhandled that body can't receive a spirit of air that body has thus saith the lord and she's moving in the power of the word of god so how about god brother man says how about god joining himself this is intuition of a bride joining himself to something like that a regular denominational prostitute you think he would do it you think he would join himself to a regular denominational prostitute he says having a form of godliness but denying the power of he will never do it she must have his character in her how do you get that character in you by being born again of the spirit of god notice the real true born again church must have the character that was in christ because the husband and the wife are one and if jesus did not did only that which pleased god kept his word and manifested his word his bride will have to be the same kind of character she could not by no means be a denomination let me just say that one more time she could not by no means being a nomination because then no matter how much they want to say no he says she's controlled by a board somewhere that tells her what to do and what she can do and many times a million miles off the true word of god tell you what to do and what you can't do oh he said it seemed to suit the people though that his robe upon him would look great talking about the son of kish saul upon his head way above all the other people as he walked and real asset to the kingdom of israel for the other kings other nations would think look what a man man look at the leadership of that look at the money they're bringing into that church look at look at that building my mama look at it a monstrosity see we look at the outside things and think that's god's blessing i see god blessing right here god blessing right here in the tabernacle we've seen god move in this church right here time and time and time again how many of you've been healed in this church the spirit of god came by your way and healed you and delivered you in this church that's the movement that didn't have anything to do with a man no but it was a son of man sons of god who are led by the spirit of what to preach how to speak how to preach and to invite the presence of god down so that that god can minister to your needs notice he said and sad to say but how true it is today with the church that they love to say our pastor is not narrow-minded he's not a narrow-minded man he's a great man he's a graduate from hartford or some great school of theology he has four degrees out of sowing such a place and a very good mixture amongst the people all that may all he said all that may be all right it has his place but god's way is for the church to be led by the holy ghost and by the spirit so i just want to be clear this morning i'm not here and i'm not bashing individuals i'm not here and i'm not preaching against individuals but what i am doing is i'm calling you to arms to discern the spirit that anoints the individual that tries to come and cause division among the body see brother branham never hit against a man he never hit against the women of the denominations he hid against the spirit of denominations he was able to discern the spirit when it would try to come in and he would lash out against the spirit and sometimes the people took it the wrong way and they thought he was against them see but it's not he's against the spirit of the nomination the spirit of nicoletism and that's what we're fighting against this morning that's what i'm calling you to arms against this morning we're on the eve of d-day i'm calling you to fight for the truth of this message fight for the reality because it produces exactly what the prophet of god said it would produce see we're not fighting against men and women we're those are our brothers they're our sisters but we've been called to fight for the truth fight to allow god to rule the church and to lead the church and not have a headquarters telling us when and what to do we're fighting for the supernatural so that the signs will follow those that believe we're fighting to keep prayer lines in the church so that you can have your needs met and when you walk into a prayer line you'll meet god in the prayer line you're not meeting a man and that god will come by and bring an instantaneous healing to you just like he did brother ed back there who had a situation in his body and dealt with it for 40 years but he met god in a prayer line or let me say it like this god met him in a prayer line and he's not had any trouble since that's the god that we serve church i'm preaching to you about a living god who wants to live through his people he wants to be free to move through his people he wants to be free to manifest himself through his people but the people begin to limit god see we're fighting to keep the message pure keep man's ideas out of it keep their thoughts out of it keep their special doctrines out of it i don't want your special doctrine i'm sticking with a prophet i got 1200 sermons and if i don't find your special doctrine in that 1200 then forget it i don't have nothing for it i'm not going to gum it down and eat it now i got a weak stomach you get a fly in the soup i'm not eating the soup my wife will tell you there's been more than one time they talking about something at the house i run out the front door heaving and huffing glass out and up chucking and i say that to say we some of us would just pick the fly out i'm coming down some of you will not even you bring me a noob matter of fact we're not even going to eat at this restaurant you can take that kind of attitude about something in your soup but what about what's going into your soul don't take this the wrong way i'm just trying to protect your church see we're fighting for the holy spirit to lead men and women holy spirit leadership we're fighting so that the bride can have her own revival i don't need a man's revival i need my own revival and that revival comes by receiving the vindicated word of the hour not some special idea not some special doctrine we're not fighting to build our own kingdom or to help a man build his kingdom but we're fighting so that god can restore his kingdom the prophet of god said he had a threefold purpose of his coming to have preeminence in a body so he came in the form of christ so that he could redeem fallen man then he wanted to have preeminence in that falling creation and not only that then he wanted to restore that creation back to the kingdom back to its rightful position see we're fighting for the rapture of the church and that would only take place when you know who you are you need a quote for that don't you no well i'm gonna give you one anyway he says in christ's mystery if the church only knew its position it will one day oh i said it will one day he says then the rapture will go when it knows what it is oh church that's what we're fighting for so you can know your position you can know that you're called by god not by man see god sent on the day of pentecost the holy spirit to rule the church to rule a man's heart and to rule in their lives and he says and it was not meant for one man to rule over another man but we love to say that we love to say that because man like saul exalts himself in a position because he prophesied i must be something i'm among the prophets and he used that clout he used that influence to sway the people so they did exactly what saul wanted them to do but saul was not the right pick god already had his pick the people chose saul see god already had david in the wings he knew samuel was going to go by the way of the grave he knew maybe that there was going to be a dispensational change and he was waiting because daniel or david was only a child and so the people because they just couldn't wait they couldn't wait couldn't wait couldn't wait hope that sounds familiar couldn't wait couldn't wait well brother joe come on it's been seven years can't wait can't wait can't wait don't you grasp the first thing that comes make sure it's godly leadership god inspired preaching god inspired decisions god inspired anointing god inspired leadership servitude god inspired not an overlord not a dictator someone tell you a pastor is one thing that you don't have right now right it's obvious but it's one of the hardest things to get rid of you say well we can just vote him in and vote him out not that simple some people may like that and that one vote sways the entire group because it's got to be unanimous so you get 49 4 51 or 51 449 against he's there then he's got the sway of the people then you see kingdoms starting to build up kingdoms then they says well you know what y'all can't go over to north side and you can't go here and you can't go there and you can't go to these meetings and heaven forbid you ever go to louisiana youth camp you can't go there either because we don't believe in that we don't believe in all that emotion you laugh but that's what happens that's exactly what's being proclaimed i heard a pastor just say just the other day he goes um brother bran was paralyzed i want you to see how carnal we get not we we're led by the spirit of god right just what this man said and it just it resonated in me and it did everything i could not pick up a phone and say look what in the world are you talking about but he had the audacity to say did you ever see anybody fall out in one of brother branham's prayer lines there's only one or two sermons that's been on video anyway everything is in audio format how do we know what took place all i can say is i've seen the same holy spirit move in our prayer lines i've seen them shout the last time i was here i've seen them shout i've seen them healed i've seen them delivered i've seen them fall out you telling me that ain't the holy ghost you telling me that ain't of god and you want to say how many have ever seen it happen in brother branham's ministry well we don't know people but i promise you if we could have followed it you'd have sent us you would have seen the same holy ghost because you've seen the healings you heard the response you heard the shouts you heard the screams you heard the emotion you heard all of it so if all that was there then you'd have to expect there would be those that came under the anointing and was slain in the spirit as well you had tongues you had the interpretation of tongues so now we have gotten 60 years removed from the prophet's ministry from the prophet's life and now we want to start questioning that because maybe you're not geared to emotion and that's perfectly fine we're not asking you to all be clones of this one or that one but don't stop and hinder the movement of the spirit because it doesn't come the way you perceive or what in it you know because maybe you like the teaching gift some of you may like the evangelistic flair with all the wow wow wow like some kung fu master up there just with a little time you know we're all different you're different i'm different we're different but we make up a body and for man to make those kind of those kind of proclamations from behind the pulpit what he just done is swayed 300 people that everything that happens at louisiana camp is wrong it's an heir it's not of the holy spirit and the problem of god said there's more than one way to kill a man you don't have to stick a knife in his back you kill his influence so what about those young people that attend that church now when they come to a louisiana camp will they receive or will they think that's just hogwash that's just emotion that's just man be careful be careful how you handle the holy spirit be careful brother batman said be careful blasphemy is the only unpardonable sin and that's to make fun of the holy spirit because i promise you i've seen god move brother ron spencer and i stood right in front of each other in our prayer line of our at our last camp and he looked at me and he said brother joe he said the angel lord is right here and when he came down bam bam bam they went out and they hauled them off and then the holy spirit lifted and you see some just kind of come through he'd come back down bam bam bam and lift back up because you could tell the holy spirit knew who to deal with there were some that were coming with sincerity and when he when they come with sincerity holy spirit dropped down and they just fell out bam bam bam and then those that were just coming through to come through the spirit lifted up and they just walked right on through but i can tell you it was the holy ghost every time it was the holy ghost but you got to be careful that's why i'm preaching this this morning is we're called to arms to protect this right here this right here has to be protected at all times this pulpit is sacred and the words that come from behind this pulpit must be anointed and it must be god inspired it can't be some man's idea just to try to grab hold of a congregation it has to be god god god god and be careful i will say it to pastors to preachers be careful not to interject your own ideas brother says but man wants to rule and rule over man and man wants man to rule over him let me see my goodness i got y'all i can't even get done today i'm having too much fun preaching this this morning can i go a little bit further this morning nobody's going to get up and walk out on me i know the lunch is right down the road there there's mexican there's all kinds of stuff we'll eat later he said but man wants to rule and rule over man and man wants man to rule over him see he doesn't want to have god to rule so this son of kish saul by name was just an answer to what they had wanted a great stately man oh he could just lead them to their battles and so forth but still it wasn't god's way of doing things god wanted his faithful old prophet to direct them and speak his words to them see god never ordained fallen man to lead fallen man he never ordained for man to tell you when how where what and all that where you can go on vacation what car you can buy and by the way i'm going to drive at tesla before i leave this weekend you wasn't here last time so i got you this morning yeah i'm putting that out that's man's idea i get it y'all can scratch that that was not anointed all right tell you what boy or girl you can marry see god never ordained man to fight man's battles he tells us over and over and over and over and over and over and over in the old testament i the lord will fight your battles why did he send us malachi 4 why did he send us luke 17 30 why did he send us revelations 10 7 was to turn our hearts away from man leadership back to holy ghost leadership because the leadership of man had its place there was a time that god used that leadership but we're not in the dispensation of man any longer we're in the ego anointing holy spirit anointing holy spirit direction so god wants to lead his church in out or in through and out of laodicea he wants to heal your diseases he wants to deliver you of your torment and spirits in your troubles god wants to do that he wants to fight your battles he tells us in exodus 14 14 the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace deuteronomy 1 and verse 30 the lord your god which goeth before you he shall fight for you deuteronomy 3 and verse 22 you shall not fear them for the lord your god shall fight for you deuteronomy 20 and verse 4 for the lord your god it is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you second chronicles 13 and verse 12. and behold god himself is with us for our captain and his priest with the sounding trumpets to crowd the alarm against you oh children of israel fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers for you shall not prosper and in second chronicles 20 and verse 7 you shall not need to fight in this battle but set yourself stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord so god was telling them then you don't need to choose a man i got it i'll fight for you i'll lead you i'll take you through i'll bring you into that promised land not only will i bring you into it i'll prosper you while you're there i'll take care of your jericho's i'll take care of your ais i'll take care of the ammolites or the amalekites i'll take care of the jebusites i'll take care of all these things just follow my leadership but we want a king kind of like that little boy when it was storming that night but mama i want a guy with skin on it and sometimes that's how we are let's just be honest sometimes look brother joe we've been without a pastor we just need somebody and a lot of you probably said that in your mind we just need somebody to assume the responsibilities of the tabernacle and you're right but you need the right somebody not the wrong somebody see god never intended no ordained man to fight your battle he was going to do it no matter what that battle may be god was willing to take up arms for you now i'm summoning you to take up arms from him do what he's called you to do to serve him and we would find as i go let me just kind of go a little further and see if i can find me a stopping place here this morning barbara talks about mark 16 and we know mark 16 very familiar but i'm just going to read it because we need to see mark mark 16 alive amongst the body of christ and it says mark 16 verse 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe so there's signs to follow the believer how many are believers all right good these signs will follow them that believe in my name they should cast out devils that's gonna probably scare a whole bunch of you right there right oh my brother joe devil fighting you shall cast out devils he says and they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and brother branham will tell us he said today in the great church age that we live in i think and i believe this with all my heart that we have exactly gone vice versa from what god ordained us to do and he references mark 16. he references mark 16. he's saying god's telling us that these signs will follow the believers but we've done vice versa now i'm not inviting you to bring a bunch of snakes into the church this morning i'm not testing your faith nor mine but i know that god said these signs will follow them that believe and you that been healed you can testify that they did follow you that were delivered or tormented spirits you can testify that they did follow but a lot of times we want to focus on the last part of this they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but there's signs following there's ministries there's casting out of spirits when we were at our louisiana camp and i'll just give you one reference on a sunday morning i was up dealing with a young lady my wife and sister lydia and i were dealing with a young lady on saturday night who came in the prayer line who was anointed with a an evil spirit and she fell over and began to convult and shake and writhe and and slither and we pulled her to the back so that we can work with her to get her off the platform so it doesn't cause a scene and we work with her we work with her for over an hour 45 minutes just to get her to calm down because she at one point even began to foam out of the mouth like a dog evil spirits are real but i want you to know god's word is greater so we work with her and work with her and work with her sometimes we think well we just lay hands on them and cast that devil off and then our mac leaves no it doesn't happen that way because that evil spirit is holding on because it knows it has to go all right because we have a word of god that says you should cast out devils and once it's exposed and that person repents of the things that they've done then that spirit can no more lie no more stay there but it's fighting and holding on and we begin to deal with her and a spirit would leave but yet there was other spirits there and brother ron said she was she was dealt with uh how did he say i think she was molested as a young child and he said make sure you go get two strong sisters to go back there with them to deal with because that thing will not allow a man to work with it and so they went and got my wife and they went guys sister lydia which is brother aaron oglesby's wife and they my wife can testify it took everything within our human ability to keep her hands down and keep her feet down because she was just moving just erratic i mean uns ungodly strength supernatural strength and this is a young 15 year old girl and we worked with him we worked with her and we worked with her for an hour and all of us were physically getting exhausted and then finally brother matt mcgary he came back to the back and this young lady happens to go to their church and i said matt i i can't go no further i'm gonna put you here and i put sister jessica here sister lydia here and i put brother matt right here and i just was right here to the side and we finally got her to come and she could be able to tell what's going on and brother matt began to work with her and begin to get her to a place where she could repent of some of the things that she did and then we come to fight and when she once she repented of those things her body just went limp because the spirit no longer had hole it left because it had to leave right because it can't stay because it was exposed and she repented of it you know it's no different than that maniac in oregon when they when brother branham said you challenge the spirit of the lord today and the spirit of the lord is here to accept that challenge when he went to swing adam he said in the name of the lord and the man spun around and fell across his feet and the two policeman says is he delivered he said no he's not delivered is he healed no he's not healed he's not free because he worships that thing because he thinks he's right see he never if he would have ever repented of the way he was thinking he would have been delivered and set free and so when this young girl finally got to that point about an hour and a half into it she finally got to a point of repentance that spirit broke off over she was free and she went back that following week and gave testimony at their church of what happened to her as a four-year-old little girl somebody touched her somebody molested her and that spirit grabbed onto her and made it think that it was her and so she invited other things and other things but see the spirit of god's never wrong now you may say that's out of line you may say that's not church order but you won't ask her to tell her that's not order when she got delivered so sunday morning it's sunrise service and i'm gonna close here in just a minute i'll leave with with this last thought here sunday morning there was another young girl happens to be this young girl's friend and she was hyperventilating come out anxiety and all this fear just over and over and it was about 6 30 in the morning it was early service and i'm half asleep because i was up to one o'clock dealing with this other case and had to get up and come over and so i got my coffee in my hand and you know sometimes you just gotta drink coffee first i mean you just gotta wake up you gotta know what you're doing right and i know this is colonel but they said bro joe she needs you to pray for her i said well she been she can wait i'm gonna finish my coffee and so because i didn't know was i'm gonna be in something like i was in last night so i went over there after i finished my coffee and began to talk to her and there was another sister there an older sister from brother donny reagan's church was there and she began to tell me well she's got anxiety and some fear and i began to talk to her she says yeah she goes i just saw all that happen last night and you know i just i'm afraid it's all going to come back on me and it's going to be on me and i don't want that and she was just real nervous just a real wreck and i began to just talk to her and kind of console her a little bit and i said we're just going to pray we're just going to we're just going to rebuke this spirit of fear and you know fear has torment but fear can't save because perfect love is here and perfect love casts out all fear when i went to put my hands on her and pray that spirit spoke out i don't like you i don't like you i said well good i don't like you either now i didn't just jump out and and flip out i knew who i was i know my calling and i've i've dealt with these things time and time again and that spirit said i'm not gonna let her go that's the kind of voice i'm not gonna let her go you can't have her i said i don't want her but you can't have her either and i told her to shut its mouth and i commanded it to leave and just boom it left just like that see one refused to leave because there was there was some repenting that had to be done this one didn't have anything to repent of it just got there and it was anxiety and fear and when it left but it tried to boast and put a scare in by speaking you can't have her i don't like you let me tell you what that lifted my faith realized that thing looked at me and said i don't like you i'm like well praise god that real i mean i feel great so i'll tell you these things because these things are real and the prophet of god said these gifts should be in operation in the church they should be in operation in the and that's what we're fighting for is to allow the spirit of god to operate in the local body he said well brother joe we don't have a pastor that doesn't matter you're still a local body allow the gifts of god to operate in the local assembly allow anointing of the holy spirit to come in the assembly allow speaking in tongues don't forbid it don't forbid interpretations don't forbid to move another spirit don't forbid emotion i'm not telling tell you y'all need to be a bunch of popcorns and just popping up all over the place but there's there is order with it but we get stimulated by revelation and when revelation comes it excites something within you that you can't control either one or two things for you to sit and i'm not saying you but for some individual to sit there there's one or two things that has to happen either you're not being stimulated or your nerve endings are dead but either case it can be fixed now i'm not trying to excite your nerve endings and just get you to just jump around but i want you to know that it's okay it's okay it is okay to have the movement of the spirit however he chooses to move how sovereign and who he chooses to move upon it's okay because we want him to have the leadership of the local body we don't want to be dictated over and be manhandled and you can't do this how dare you speak in tongues that's not what we're looking for we're looking for sons of god to be led by the spirit of god and if stimulation comes you have my authority to allow it to move you at least when i'm here preaching you have my authority to move and respond to the holy spirit however he chooses see i grew up in a sinner's home i didn't grow up in a christian church and i was in a penteco or a baptist church for a couple years and then the presbyterian church and a methodist church and then finally a pentecostal church and then back to a baptist church so i was all confused so you look at my life and say bro joe you must have grew up in a pentecostal church because you're so lively and wiry and you're all over the place no but that's because there's something on the inside it's being stimulated stimulated by the word of god because i know what i used to be and when i see this word changing me and i see this word telling me that that's not who you were you just came that way but in the in the fountain before the foundation of the world you was in the mind of god so all this the devil's trying to put on you that's not who you really are god took a picture of you at your best and that's not when you were 16 that was before the foundation of the world and he said there's nothing that the devil can do tomorrow that negative because it's going to become positive one day we're going to fit exactly what he thought of us and that should stimulate you that's your stem that should just get you so excited to know you don't belong to the enemy you don't you never had and you never will all right i want the musicians to come i'm going to parachute on out it's 12 o'clock you're getting hungry but brother baum says sons of kish can never produce mark 16. sons of kish intellectual giants maybe next time when i come we'll pick this back up and finish it out but intellectual giants he talked about billy graham meeting with that muhammadan over there overseas and that muhammad said you know if this is a truth then i want you to i want to see that god heal somebody and deliver them and brother brother uh i just drew a blank brother graham excuse me brother graham was the one he was speaking of and he said that him and his army of men came back to the states defeated and he said what a waste sons of kiss and he says no sons of kish with their intellectual power can can do these things can bring the signs and wonders today that's why it's got to be more than intellectualism and that's why i'm calling you to arms to fight to allow the spirit of god to have free reign in the life of a believer you may respond different you may shout you may jump up you may scream you may sit there and do none of that but nevertheless do something don't quench the spirit don't allow yourself to come under subjection to man's ideas what this one thinks about you so you can't move because now you're worried about what they think about you hey man let's just stand to our feet this morning but the battle says there's not a man there's no son of kish or no one else can produce that outside the leadership of the holy spirit but we have made schools we have made seminaries we have made organizations to satisfy and to look like the rest of the world see no son of kish man that is set in place by another man intellectual giant man who is not called by god but placed there by another man can produce these things it has to be god ordained god instructed god place god inspired see the sons of kish they lack the anointing oh they have all the mechanics they know the bible and they know the quotes but they don't have the dynamics to make the mechanics live see they don't have the fire to bring people to the fire to give them fire how can they preach life when they haven't never met the giver of life themself they've only come to a place of justification and sanctification but when you move into that realm of the baptism of the holy ghost then now that intellectualism begins to fall off because we're no longer sons of kish now we become sons of god and sons of god are led by the spirit prophet god said satan chose the mind god chose the heart and he said these intellectual giants they try to use the mind to sway the people god uses the heart discern the spirit discern the spirit within the framework of the christian church what spirit is that there's a genuine holy spirit and then there's a spirit that would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if possible discern the spirit father we just thank you lord this morning thank you for your leadership father thank you for your holy spirit for direction this morning lord of service may have not been something typical of the style of preaching lord that you have gifted us with but lord we just really felt this is the direction you would have us to go this morning and just trust lord for the local body here at the tabernacle lord and they're longing for a pastor for leadership lord for direction comment their longing not supersede the desire that you have to bring them the right individual god may their longing line up with the call of god for a godly man a god-inspired man a godly leader not a son of kish that would lord over them over here this morning we're called to arms to fight for the truth to keep this message pure and to believe what the prophet of god preached lord to be the truth in this hour god i've looked at men and women through my years of being apart and assembled with the message lord i've seen this one come in and that one go out and yet i've seen men such as myself lord no spiritual upbringing no leadership in the home and come in and come underneath the anointing of the holy spirit and be led in the right way lord not to say that we're perfect but we're led by the spirit of god and we're quick to repent lord when we've done wrong lord i'm so thankful today that sons of god are still being led by the spirit men and women old and young alike are still allowing the spirit of god to lead them and guide them and pulsate within their innermost being lord so we just want to commit this service to you this morning how many more pages to preach father but really feeling led right now just to bring this to a close lord and just have a time of worship father you've been so good to us god you've been so wonderful to us you continue to provide ministry here at the tabernacle lord in lieu of a pastor you continue lord to feed the sheep father and you know their hearts cry and we just ask god that you will do what only you can do that you would move lord on every heart and every life just pray lord that you'll give us a spirit of wisdom spirit of discernment right now father to be led by the spirit of god not put our will ahead of your will not our ideas ahead of your ways not our direction over your direction for our lives and for the church and for the body of christ but god we humble ourselves to you right now and we just ask sword that your word have preeminence in every heart and every life and that your word can continue to speak to us lord and that it may abound richly in our lives we ask it in jesus name amen brother aaron hallelujah god bless you church [Music] police [Music] holy spirit thy heart will come in this place holy spirit thou art well [Music] of mercy and [Music] holy spirit thou art will come in this place holy spirit thou art will come in father of mercy and grace thou art worth [Music] lord in thy presence there's healing no other power can save lord by [Music] holy spirit thou art come in this place [Music] i think sometimes when we sing that song we're singing about tucson tabernacle but how about this place how about making a little more person say lord be preeminent in this place in this heart of mine so the holy spirit just doesn't stay in the church when we come but it abides in us wherever we're at lord this this morning you we are confident lord we know that you have leadership lord we know that we are your children and you sent brother joe this way and this was not something we planned together and said you minister on this and that but you know what we had need of today father we're trusting in that leadership of the holy spirit lord as a church as a as a family as as a group lord but more in each individual lord having the spirit of god in each one as individuals lord [Music] therefore when we gather together lord it it's just the presence of god with us all here lord creating that that presence lord that that unity father because it's a spirit of christ in us lord and as you minister lord you know the very hearts you know the thoughts you know the the dealings of each one lord how you could call out a name you would a prophet in the prayer line and you would begin to tell speak through the voice of that prophet and begin to reveal the secrets of the heart tell them where they were from what their names were what the history of their life was because you know all these things lord and you're the same yesterday today and forever it's not something that's limited to history to to just certain people lord but it's to the children of god or so father help us to yield to that surrender to that as a as a body of believers lord and let you have full preeminence lord is our prayer today in jesus christ's name amen [Music] brother joe felt in his heart to minister to the as to the youth he said as young people and i know i got asked a couple weeks ago if maybe we could ask brother joe to do that and i never did and he told me today he says i feel in my heart to minister to the youth so god had already arranged that so if you possibly can come by and if you're under 100 your youth and if you're over 100 just a little bit older youth come anyways and let god minister to us amen when you do that god bless you as you go and to be like jesus to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth is to be like all through life's journey from earth [Music] to be like him remember he surrendered himself to the spirit of his father he yielded himself when we say to be like jesus you're surrendering yourself to him to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth [Music] him all through life's journey from earth to glory [Music] oh make me more likely jesus make me more like thee give me a heart that's filled with love and make [Music] who make me make me [Music] and make me so [Music] no [Music] you
