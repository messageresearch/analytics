happy to announce sister joyce dougal's celebration of life on april 16th at 11 a.m here at the tabernacle all are welcome to come rejoice with us amen i like that we we're we've got a lot to rejoice about i was thinking you know brother ed was talking about that in the back and i was thinking i wonder i wonder if they can look over the banister and see what's going on down here and and then up here came to my mind she's joined that great cloud of witnesses they're looking over there they're saying come on finish strong run the race amen let's sing when we all get to heaven keep the flag oh the wondrous of jesus singing his mercy and his grace in the mansions [Music] when we all get to have a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see jesus we'll sing and shout the victory while we walk this pilgrim pathway clouds will overspread the sky but when travelling days are over not a shadow not aside when we are get to have what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see we'll sing and shout the victory so let us then be true and faithful trusting serving every day just one glimpse of him in glory will the toils of life repay what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all get to please us we'll sing and shout love start with that first verse again then very first verse sing the wondrous love of jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] when [Music] amen amen i appreciate that and asked brother peter to sing that song and he goes someone sent that to me already today i said yeah it was probably elizabeth because as we got on the car coming that was a song that came on and said we haven't sung that song in a long time and i said well that will go real good with a message today so i thank the lord for that and then brother peter says talk about those witnesses i said well thank you lord because you're confirming what's on our heart and i appreciate that with the lord thank you appreciate that and talking with brother ed and the memorial for our sister joyce and brother peter made that statement the rejoicing that's going on up there the happiness but there's a pull a draw to us come on keep coming don't give up now and that's that's that's god's love and his mercy that's drawing to us we would not respond or we wouldn't even know what to respond to we begin drawing in so many different ways so many different things but god has placed a seed as a part of him in you and that's what's responding back to that and learning to put everything else in subjection to that and that sometimes is our battle so let's pray lord we thank you this morning the week lord the weekend before resurrection sunday lord father you had had set your eyes towards jerusalem for the joy that was set before you lord it didn't look like a joyous occasion didn't look like anything that anybody would ever want to go through but lord you knew what that accomplishment what that would do lord to restore the fellowship that you had with your children at one time lord father we appreciate that this morning just want to talk about that lord and we want to let you have your own way lord let every heart rejoice in the fact that they're part of that body of christ today lord one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them lord we thank you for that in jesus christ's name amen while you're standing let's just read the first scripture there in hebrews chapter 11 we'll read verses 39 and 40 and then hebrews 12 1 and two and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect then hebrews 12 1-2 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith for who the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of god right hand of the throne of god amen you may be seated i don't know how many of us could say the suffering and the the pain and the humiliation and all the words that would describe that we would say we're looking forward to it i don't know that any of us get up in the morning and and say boy i hope this is a troublesome day i hope nothing goes right i hope everybody makes a face at me you know if you wear a beard i hope somebody plucks my beard no i don't think anybody's up there but him for the joy that was set before him he willingly went and because of that you're here today and i'm here today so in a message time tested memorials of god brother branham says something here how god tests his church how he he does this church he says that's the way god does his church he gives you trial after trial and we need to learn to say thank you lord because you know what's best for me where would we be if we could get our own way for everything it wouldn't be good i know that trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test until the life of christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful sober meek gentle humble ready submissive willing to turn your head on things of the world and looking straight to calvary to the one who is doing the beating now that's sometimes hard when we think about that we will say you know sometimes with the girls we talk about it sometimes with my brothers we talk about it when dad or mom you know had to do something to straighten us out and i was reading part of a message last night and brother branham talked about that child playing in the street little johnny says playing in the street there and cars are going back and forth and you would say now johnny get out of the street you shouldn't be there he said you really don't love that child he said if you really love that child you'd go over there and you'd get that child out of there and you'd take them back and you'd teach them a lesson about it that's what he's doing here because he loves us and sometimes the love that we might take love and we'll put it real soft and easy and love has its soft easy place the forgiving part the one that you've done it once twice three times and they still say i forgive you let's go at it again but sometimes there's this side of it he says willing to turn your head on things of the world looking straight to calvary to the one who is doing the beating many times you think it's strange because fiery trials sickness and persecutions it's only done to test you to get the dirt out of you to get the sludge out of you to get the slowness out of you to wake you up to the place where you can look and see the reflection or a man can see the reflection of christ in you christ in you the hope of glory and that's god's purpose so others can see christ in you but not only though others can see christ and you can recognize it's christ in you also coming to that recognition in your own life that is christ in me and and to think about those heavenly witnesses those that have gone on before us from the very beginning all the way through today who have already gone on before us they come the same way you and i are coming there's no special treatment for sums and well this one needs more testing no everyone had the test that god put them through now there's one that that we we read about in the scriptures we hear about and it says enoch walked with god and was seen not the the bible talks about 365 years approximately his lifetime on earth if i remember correctly but all it says is he walked with god but if you and i would have been around part of enoch's life we would have seen his testing his trials the times that he would go through but he walked with god brother dan evans spoke that on wednesday night over with brother osorio i watched the the service it was excellent just a great thought walking with god you're going to walk you're going to walk with someone somewhere you're going to follow somebody's leading why not walk with god the end result of walking with god is the best result that there is it's pretty simple that when you look at it that way and don't make it any more complicated than that but walking with god and he tests you he tries you because he has a purpose for you now i want to read one more quote this one's a little lengthy but from beyond the curtain of time and brother branham had been laying there he says and thinking about the other side and how many of us have done that before what a day that will be when we all get to heaven you know and you begin to think what is it like in in in our best imagination and our best thought process going back to the scriptures what other people have have testified we we try to draw an image to ourselves and and and i know sometimes i'll get real happy doing that just to think about the joy to think about the peace that's there to think of of the comfort that's there and then sometimes and you start thinking about things that won't be there and boy sometimes that gets even better i won't have to deal with that more i won't have that problem with myself anymore we won't have you know it's all part of that but to see jesus that's a great brother brandon on this quote you he asked where is he i want to see him then the voice spoke to me this is what is that where i started it at yeah then the voice spoke to me brother brahm had been asking and he gets to go over to the other side this is what you preach that the holy ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it can you imagine being in a place where that's all there is perfect love it's it's hard to imagine because your thoughts go back to the situation and things going on around you issues you have and it gets in the way of that but he said that's the only thing that can in here is perfectly next i was taken up and seated on a high place all around me were great numbers of men and women in the bloom of youth brother tony sent me a text late yesterday evening i actually was probably last night and he said brother aaron i'm still hurting i may have broke my ribs or something i'm still hurting would you pray for me so myself and my wife we prayed for him then and and just asked god to relieve the pain god it would cause the healing to take place but tomorrow something else might happen you're healed of this but tomorrow you face something else but he says they're on here they're in in the bloom of youth and they were crying with joy oh our precious brother we are so happy to see you here if you think you're going to be happy going over there they're anticipating awaiting the whole family of god there's something that's drawing there's something that's pulling there's something that says hey that's there's still a part of us missing you know and and so he says i i thought i'm not thought i'm dreaming for i can see these people and i can see my body lying back there on the bed it's between those two atmospheres there's two spheres right there the voice spoke to me you know it is written in the bible that the prophets were gathered with their people and i said yes i remember that in the scriptures but there are not this many branhams he said my family millions of branhams up here that was it he says the voice says these are not branhams they are your converts the ones that you have led to the lord some of these women that you think are so young and beautiful were more than 90 years old when you led them to the lord and i liked the thought from there they were over 90 years old and god still called them in sometimes we think well if they don't come to god now they'll never have a chance how do you know that thief on the cross we would have condemned right with everybody else was condemning him but at the last moment he turns and looks over jesus and says remember me and he just turn around say this day you'll be with me in paradise so think of that somebody said they're we're over 90 years old when you led them to the lord no wonder they are crying out my precious brother then the multitude cried together if you had not gone forth with the gospel we wouldn't be here blessed is the feet of those that carry the good news to every part of this world of every language nation tribe tongue people whoever they are they get to hear the voice of god through the word of god speak to them and their heart responds oh what a day that is isn't it it says and then he says oh where is jesus i want to see him the people replied he's just a little higher someday he will come to you you are sent as a leader and when god comes he will judge you according to your teaching and this is where where i want to base this off i ask does paul and peter have to stand this judgment also the answer was yes i said i have preached what they preach i did not divert from it from one side or the other were they baptized in the name of jesus i did too where they taught the baptism in the holy ghost holy spirit i did too whatever they taught i taught also and then the people said we know that the people cried and we know that we are going back to earth with you sometime jesus will come and judge you according to the word you preached us then you will present us to him and all together we will go back to earth to live forever we are confident we're confining we're placed all of that that you preached to us the very gospel that paul preached it didn't change and today we're confident the exact same thing jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and then they said then i said do i have to go back to earth now they answered yes but keep pressing on as i began to move from the beautiful joyful place as far as my eye could see people were coming towards me to embrace me crying my precious brother suddenly i was back on the bed again i said oh god help me never let me compromise with the word let me stay straight on the word i don't care what anyone else does lord let me press onto that beautiful joyful place i am more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only supreme beauty and joy then he tells us whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even every enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or the guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love that's what it takes to get in there but what or could i say who is perfect love it's the lord jesus christ it's him so what he's telling you is make sure you have him in you it's not something you carry in a bag it's not something on this side it's christ in you the hope of glory and that's perfect love but to hear him say ah say if paul is going to be and peter and all of them are going to be judged by the word of god and that's how they then i'm doing the exact same thing and the people said we're we're believing on that we've placed that we have heard the same word given to us therefore we get the same results so we'll look at some scriptures here we just read there in hebrews and that's seen that great cloud of witnesses a great cloud not just a handful a great cloud and i don't know when you think great i don't limit to it just to a small number a thousand used to be a lot a million used to be a lot thinking way back when we were kids boy if we could if we ever get to a million we'll be rich and you look today for houses that are selling for over a million dollars and probably only worth a third of that in reality but the value has been raised so high and you say wow a million dollars would take all that i have to buy that one house and here it is it's it's a great multitude of people saying it's worth every bit of it and they're looking over the banister right because they say come on brother come on sister keep pressing on don't give up now over the last couple years now it's been a few years that we've lost some of our members of this church that have gone out no they've crossed over to the other side added more to that witness on that side part of us would say yes we'd love to have him back here in fellowship with but a part of me says no no let me go over there instead you know leaving this life behind and you might say but i have unsafe children i have unsaved loved ones yes but commit them to god don't give up on them now i remind myself over and over when i think it's just it seems impossible they seem so far away from god they seem to turn the other way but i remind myself of that thief on the cross who was hanging there who was crucified next to my lord and savior and he asked for mercy at the last second and he got it and i'm not going to stand there before him and say lord i deserve heaven a whole lot more than he does because i served you a whole lot longer than i did better no it's the same grace the 11th hour worker gets the same pay as that first hour worker and there'll be no jealousy on that side none at all a great cloud of witnesses therefore let us lay aside every weight and the sin the unbelief the things that trouble us which it does so easily beset us paul said seems like it paul speaking by experience if you go back and read his scriptures where he said paul says when i find myself wanting to do this i find myself doing this instead we all went through it and this is where the thought came in prayer when we had the three nights of prayer here saturday night to begin to think about those heavenly witnesses what would they say to us come on come on and i felt the lord just spoke to me and said but every one of them came the same way you're coming they got no special favors they didn't say well if you do this you'll get a head no they came through the shed blood of a sacrifice now i rise the old testament saints came under a sacrifice that was type of the perfect sacrifice but they were allowed in they were brought in when jesus comes on and that early that morning that he goes and he opens the gate there of paradise the door says come on brother branham describes it he goes sarah abraham sarah sir remember we were looking for that city that's him and began to be identified the very things that we're looking for they're identifying the same things and they come in the exact same way they were not better than us they were not worse than us they were humans like you and i they were born in sin shaped in iniquity came to this world speaking lies and if you don't believe that go read adam and eve when they fell it's her fault it's his fault she said it so i did it and that started right there and god says i'll have to take the life of an innocent one and i'll take the life of it and take the blood from that one and i and the covering from that and i will cover you speaking of a perfect lamb of god that would come he says looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has set down at the right hand of the throne of god for the joy that was set before him i could name that joy right now eddie you were that joy sister angela you were that joy sister all the way down to the very back all the way up that side you were the joy that was set before him so he said i will go but i'm not worthy neither am i none of us were worthy of it but he chose to do it and i'm not going to stand up and argue with him and say why i want to say thank you lord i'm going to appreciate it you know that's the hard part of receiving a gift receiving grace because as soon as you receive a gift you feel i owe one back now a gift is a gift it's hard to receive a gift without filling now i owe are you with me is that true you feel obligated but he chose to do it for you all he asks for you to do is receive it and that's hard for us sometimes but for the joy that was set before him he's the author and the finisher of our faith i like that the one that gave you the faith will also finish the faith he didn't say here's the bag full of faith and i'll go see what you do with it he said no i'm the author i placed it in you and i will finish it i will bring it to its perfection amen now we'll go to the old testament and read a little bit about jehovah god here isaiah 43 i was looking for something i remember and this scripture came up i began to read it verses 9 to 13. let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and show us the former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth god puts a challenge out he said things i'm i'm showing you things that i mean he's doing this through the in the book of isaiah he goes let all the other nations gather and show that they can do the same thing he says but then he says to them ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he and i like this before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me he is the only one that can stay say that and not be conceited and be self-puffed up because he is who he is he is the great i am the eternal one and he can say that but you know because of jesus christ and what we've got to know him through the scriptures and because he dwells in you know and you know that personally he's alive he was the most humble that there was yet he could say there shall be no other god before me that can do this and be honest about and be true about it let's go on verse 11 i even i am the lord and beside me there is no savior this was the old testament before he was slain before he shed his blood but he said there is no other savior but me he says i have declared and have saved i have showed when there was when there was no strange god among you now he's referring to something some of you have gone in a different direction are looking for something different but he said i declared this i said when there was no strange god among you therefore ye are my witnesses saith the lord that i am god who broke the uh dried up the sea and made a way for them to cross who said pharaoh let my people go and he did who said these things when he talks to job go read from jobs job chapter 38 job tell me he says this is who i am i caused this to happen this is a god we're speaking of he says yea before the day was i am he the self-existing the eternal one and there is none that can deliver out of my hand i will work and who shall let it be who shall let it be she a since a day was i am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand i will work and who can reverse it who can take what god has done and say no that's not good enough i want i'm going to do it differently god said what i have purpose it will be and because he's seen you already on the other side you will be there either even though sometimes it seems like boy i'm having to battle this i'm having to go through such a hard time i'm going through trial after trial and test after test listen to this part here rejoice in that because if you weren't being tested and if you weren't being tried and everything was going easy you better find out why now be careful don't bring the test on yourself let god bring the testing sometimes we're tried or we get into trouble for ourselves you know and and it's just kind of funny sometimes how we can do the same thing over a few times before we learn you know i i went out and bought a ladder with a much wider step because it's a lot more solid than a ladder with an arrow step with 20 years ago wasn't a problem but today it's a lot more be a whole lot more careful as you go up you hold on to more you pay more attention you look down and see worse and why because you've fallen down a few times you've hurt yourself before and you begin to learn from those things and some of you learn faster than i do probably but we all learn and i thank the lord for that he says and who can reverse it let me tell you this brother sister you can't reverse it you're a child of god you've always been a child of god you always will be a child of god i can say that through the word of god not just what i think is good but god says those you're mine and none shall pluck you out of my hand your name is written on the palm of my hand and therefore nobody can take your name from there there's a reason to have peace and have joy today but i'm being tested it just shows you that god is mindful of you it just shows you that god is mindful of you colossians 1 verses 26 and 27 even the mystery which has been hid from the ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory without him there is no hope oh you can have a hope but there's nothing to that hope there's no reality to the end of that hope you know in today's world and you you see the news and with all that's happening let me just say it this way god is still in control nothing is happening today that is surprising god that he's having to stop back and rewrite the book and go back i was talking with brother lyle the other day and i've mentioned it here before when they were just working on the atomic bomb and and and how to come that and and today the computer chip and this phone right here is how many times bigger than what they were using brother lyle a lot see the pictures of computers from the 50s they're bigger than than a refrigerator and they did they had so little that they could do in comparison well they had it on on blackboards as big as that space there between those two columns three of them with equations written from one end to the other and and i don't remember which scientist but he's sitting on a chair looking at it because the answer at the end wasn't right and he goes back from the beginning if i remember right in in the description there are three days he read that equation over and over and over because it wasn't coming out to what it was supposed to be and then ah he goes up he changes one figure one number whatever it was and then he goes there it is you and i get our phone today the answer is right there he did that for three days and it's an amazing what has happened what what happens today but there's nothing new under the sun solomon said see god had it all under control in the first place here's some of the things see some of the things i i like to sometimes get on youtube and look at the machinery that people use the things that they have today the the monstrous trucks and i'm talking to brother lyle i said what's the biggest truck you've ever been on because a company had worked for designed the control systems and stuff that they did and he mentioned the size of the truck it's a monster truck and the reason for that was to make it the most efficient possible if you're getting i don't know a mile a gallon if that good on a truck like that who knows what was it about a whole lot less than that you know in the mines and especially in south america and africa and the huge mines you want every movement controlled no wasted time no two trucks meeting on a hill and one has to back down this is man's thinking god already had it all figured out they tapped into the laws of god just like it said in the old testament who is like me there is no other god they've looked and searched but i already knew what i already had it accounted for and that hope is in you that hope of glory it's more than a hope it's a living being it's god himself christ in you the hope of glory so let me tell you my brother my sister you're going to be there he will not lose the want brother branham or let me let's go back to where paul said it when the jailer was going to take his life and paul says don't harm yourself god had a reason for this what a way to go save a jailer and his family wouldn't it have been easier to let paul go to church that morning and send the jailer and his family to church and paul could have preached to him at church but no he decides to have paul and just blanked onto his companion's name upon silas go to jail instead i may be willing to say lord if you'll send me to jail if that's what it takes i'm willing to go you raise your hand some of you didn't because he might do it huh but are you willing they could have just gone to the to the synagogue and paul could have preached to them but no he sends him to but you know there was there was something that the jailer heard and that was paul and silas worshipping the lord when their heads were in stocks and bonds their feet were in bonds and and i always say silas is looking at paul and says yeah did it have to be this way what are we doing here paul all the testimonies i've heard of your trips have been a little different than this hundreds were saved the power of god came the holy ghost fell but i got my head through a stalk of my feet there and we're down in a dungeon and paul says you know there there's a trick to this there's there's a way out of this side let's go what's that turn over on your only believe book and go to page 27 let's sing now psalm 35. praise him praise him praise him and silas is looking and he goes try it let's try it and silas begins to worship the lord with paul and after a little while paul and silas forgot they were in socks and bonds they were beginning to they got into an atmosphere that was different and an earthquake happens god says watch this for the salvation of a jailer and his family you and i would have done it differently but god said this is the way i've chosen to do it he says for it's christ in you the hope of glory now it's to you and your household again i said it's to you and your household amen not a single one shall be lost hebrews 1 verse 3. who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high stomp on that for a little bit when he himself the same god who in isaiah said i am he who shall reverse this who's going to say it won't work that way and i like this part when he had done these things he went back and he sat down if i could say he rested on his work he didn't go back to the laboratory and said now let's prepare a second plan another set of laws or another set of rules in case this one doesn't work no he rested and he sat on the right hand of god and said it is finished so why are you afraid why are you nervous why do you worry because we all do at times he rested on a finished work james 1 17-18 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of light with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning you and i can figure to do something today and tomorrow we rearrange it we come up with a better plan we come up with a better idea or maybe we read and get a little more information and then we change it i know brother lyle is talking someone with brother lyle and brother mike yarbrough it was constant process wasn't it constant upgrading you know if you work with a job that has anything like that it's a constant work but there's no shadow of variable there's no shadow of turning of his own will begat us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures he was the firstfruit and therefore we follow and that which he does is perfect from the beginning from the first time always now we'll get into the book of romans here just wanted to show something i'm sure you've never heard before huh now we've heard it time and time and time again romans 5 will read verses 1 through 10. therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ brother branham says i always thought jesus loved me and god hated me probably because of the testing and the trials and the hardships but i find out as i've gotten to this age and i look back and see the things that my father and mother did for me with the intent of being able for us to grow and to be good people if i could say in a natural way to have good character to be to hold a good job to raise a good family in the natural that was their purpose i don't think dr dobson was around back then when we were in all these help books and we didn't have a tv at home so we didn't see it anyways um but the one that is he and always been i am he was there too and the holy ghost had been given to his children and that's what guided your parents and my parents as christians to raise us the way we raise it was god rich in mercy we can look back at it now and say thank god for those things maybe we didn't understand him at that age when dad said no when mom said no don't i don't want you associating with that type of crowd and thank god that we listened i i was talking to some friends back from we came from california in our neighborhood and one of those boys died at 19 years old a couple of them went to prison another one was stabbed to death because their raising was different than mine by the grace of god in the mercy of god by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god this is through faith and faith is a revelation faith is an unveiling to you a faith is something being made plain so that you can understand and receive it and when i say understand it it's not to be able to take it make two plus two and this blessing no something in your heart says amen not necessarily a mental explanation because that can change but when it gets down into the heart and it says amen and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience every tribulation has an end and god knows when that end is and some of you younger ones can look back and maybe look to your parents or an older brother or sister here and they'll tell you it will end we thought it never would but it did but about that time we started in another one because god is going to bring forth a perfect bride a whole blind a complete bride and if you'll say lord give me another tribulation until i become that he will it's for your good and patience experience and experience hope they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength those that run to and fro don't renew their strength there's more confusion there's more anxiety there's more nervousness there's more wondering there's more going back to the starting place and starting all over again you ever done that before you get in get started finally you just said i'm going back to day one and i'm going to start all over again because all i've done for the last two week has run in circles but he says we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation work of patience and patience experience and there's only one way to get experience you can't read about experience you can't sit next to a pilot for a hundred flights and then them just give you the plane no there's training to go at least most pilots wouldn't do that they value their life more than that just because you've sat in an airplane you've flown many times in the back seat doesn't make you a pilot there's a lot of training just because you've gone to the doctor a hundred times doesn't make you a doctor sometimes people we act that way though and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us paul says it's a matter of fact it's given unto you looking to see if anywhere he paraphrases and not really you have to earn it you got to work for you got no it's given to you brother greene always reminded us this god wants to give it to you more than you want it and how many would say lord i want it and he wants to give it to you more than that he says for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly i was a hebrew of hebrews i learned from the best he said i was raised by this one but he called himself an ungodly man right there because without christ you're an ungodly person for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet pre-adventure for a good man some would even dare to die right have you ever come to the place in your life maybe as a father as a mother a brother a sister a good friend he would say lord i'm willing to take their place save them not very many people would do that paul says scarcely but god commendeth his love for us that while we were yet sinners christ died for us o love of god how rich and pure how measureless how strong it shall forevermore endure the saints and angels songs o love of god verse 9 much more than being justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him much more he says for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life why would god go through all of this to lose it all at the end just for fun ah didn't work let's try something else that's not god you go back to the old testament where is jehovah god talking about himself i did this i caused this i hardened pharaoh's heart i said to this because that's what he did he said let there be light and there was light and on the seventh day he rested you know when you can rest when it's over now for some of those for some of us saturday is our day of rest sunday's our day of rest and let me say for most of us there's not a day of rest we go every day we go every day we go i pray but you know there is rest in god let go and let god have his wonderful way take your hands off the steering wheel and let him drive take your hands off the foot off the brake too i'd really and i never have been i don't want to be one of those cars you see going down that says student driver and you're the one sitting on the other seat and the student driver is learning to drive but he'll sit there patiently he'll go with you he'll walk with you he'll be with you as you go through life for when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life reconciled to restore to friendship or harmony to restore what is restoration was referred to restoration means it was at one time if you're a part of god now you always were a part of god and i will not lose one of them he said it's to settle to resolve to reconcile differences that's what paul says being reconciled being restored to friendship oh what a friendship to be called a friend of god i i will i will tell all that i have to my friends he said i'll speak with them i'll share with them or it says to make consistent or congruous and congruence means in agreement or harmony i'll say yes lord i'll say yes lord to what your will is to cause to submit to accept something unpleasant he was reconciled to hardship i'll be tested i'll be tried and i'm reconciled to the fact that yes lord you know what's best for me the the uh another one is to reconcile something to check in reference to a financial account against another for accuracy so i laid my account before him and i laid it down and i said look this is what it equals to and it didn't equal to anything but he reconciled it to check and for acura he says no here is the accurate account the one that has blood across it and it's pure it's whole there is no measurable value to it you can't say it's worth this much you've been reconciled why would he lose why would he give up on it never atonement reparation a restoration to a good condition he said it is good my good and his good are two different things sometimes for us it's good enough and some of the work that i've done i've looked at it back later and you and i said that was good enough well i wouldn't take it now but he said it is good because it was as it was supposed to be expiation i believe is how you say that word the act of extinguishing the guilt incurred by something propitiation the act of atoning for sin or wrongdoing especially appeasing a deity you cannot atone for your own sins you cannot please god by yourself because then who becomes a measurement for that if you go to the catholic church they have saints they have these uh different people that they have have come to this place of saint and people pray to them and they and all they in most of it it's in ignorance they've been taught that way to appease in other religions to appease uh you know some religions have millions of gods hopefully you find the right one to appease this to bring good luck to whatever it might be but this one god that i'm speaking of took it upon himself he didn't say this here's the list of things you must do to please me he said i for the glory that is set before me will go and do it myself i will lay down my life and i will lift it up i will shed my blood and through my blood your sins are forgiven they're not held against you brother branham when he was there in that little restaurant and he walked in and he saw that was going on and he gets upset and angry and frustrated and he goes out and he tells god why don't you do something about it he goes how can you stand that and god says let me show you and if you're ready the brother brahm says are those my sins and he says yes white lies are just as much as lies as black lies little lies are just as much as lies as big lies still in five cents is still stealing but sometimes we justify some of our but god covered it all there was a perfect atonement there was perfect reconciliation ephesians chapter 2 verses 3 through 8. he says among whom we all had our conversation in the times past and the lust of our flesh conversation there is our manner of living our way of living not just our speaking but what our life did he says we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and where by nature the children of wrath even as others paul says we were no different we were born the same way we came in the same way and he says but god who is rich in mercy thank god for his mercy thank god for his love thank god for his care for us but god who is rich in mercy for his great love we're with he loved us not just love but it's his great love i don't know how you measure love as a as a human as a being how do we measure love well if i love somebody i do this for them if i love somebody i don't do that to them that's our measure but he went and said i'll tell you how much i love you i'm going to take your place i want to come in a body of flesh and i'm going to be tempted i'm going to be tried i'm going to have to turn my head if there's something out there i shouldn't be looking at i'm going to have to walk away from situations rather than get involved in them but i'm also going to sit there and watch somebody being condemned and be asked to be stoned because of the law and i'm going to say i forgive you can we do that takes christ in us to do that he says for even when we were dead in sins i'm sorry we missed verse 4 i think let's go back but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us verse 5 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened has given us life together with christ by grace ye are saved unmerited favor undeserved favor nothing you paid for nothing you bought for but god gave it to you anyways and let me tell you this it hurts him more when you won't receive it that's what troubles him more why why when i'm offering you an opportunity but you're telling me no how many times in brother brandman when you're hearing him preach and he's talking to the congregations and he's crying especially into those messages associated with jesus with dirty feet and he's weeping he's crying because you're getting an offering an offer here to get down before him and wash his feet but you refuse to do so and here he is he says well we were dead he quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus he did it all he desired to do it he did it so what do i owe to him i owe him everything how much can i pay for it i can't pay for any of it but lord let me be willing to give surrender yield however you want to put use whatever word you want to use say not my will but thy will be done by grace are you saved by the mercy of god by god's own choosing by his decision by his wanting to do so you look even in the animal kingdom and and and there's no soul in them but i've watched some of those when uh they put it on the news when a a mother geese takes her little group and they she crosses the street with him and they all follow her all the traffic stops it's funny they'll stop for for geese like that but the person walking sometimes they hit them a mother bear i was watching this one she's wanting to cross the street she's had enough experience in knowing what can happen on a street and she runs over and she grabs one and she takes her across and she goes to get the other one the other one starts running back across and she's going back and forth to save their lives to get them away from the horn in in in africa and some of those places to see a mother that the and because it is what it is it's a fallen nature and the one animal is trying to kill the other animal for food and territory and all because of the fallen nature and this mother is doing her best to protect her offspring that in a couple years that offspring will be out on their own but there's something in that nature that god had placed there the same nature that he has for his own and he says i've been there i've crossed that street before i've been in that situation before and i'm here to help you i'm here to rescue you i'm here with you and sometimes we just say i can do it myself i can do it all by myself i've shared this with before this young man that came to work for us and uh he was from new jersey he used to call me boss man i thought that was funny just sounded so funny to me boss man boss man is what he called me and he loved mexican food because they didn't have it in new jersey where he was from so he wanted to go eat mexican food every day and but i told him look i've done this enough years now i got a pretty good idea what not to do or you'll get in trouble for it and and he he said but i'm one of those that has to learn on my own i got to find out if it works or it doesn't and i said well i could tell you it doesn't work if you do this and this but he he just wouldn't believe it he just kept trying it and one day we were working on a job and they had brought in some custom sinks and we had to cut out the solid surface top and these sinks were custom made in mexico hand decorated in all and then they ran about 300 each today they'd probably be in the 2500 each range so i told them when you make this jig please protect the inside of the sink completely nothing will happen to it and he didn't and he got ready to cut it out and i asked him did you protect it he said no it's got a bearing down on the bottom of this cutter and it'll go around i said i've seen those bearings come off right in the middle of a cut and he kept arguing with me and i said okay fine go ahead and cut it but if you damage it it will come out of your paycheck and he'll spend about 45 minutes to an hour preparing all this thing to do the work about five minutes worth of cutting and he looked at me for a bit and he took the whole thing apart and he fixed the inside first sometimes god will say i told you i've told you let me do that preparation work no lord i can handle it and then you come back and say lord i'm glad he's a god-rich and mercy a god who cares for us god who has the best intention and the best purpose of him for you but to remember sometimes we get to thinking of our sisters would come up we get to fill in and like those people that are up there already they're saints yes they are but so are you have you been washed by the blood have you been washed by the blood you testified to it say amen i have been washed by my sins are forgiven i've been cleansed you have as much right to be up there because that's how they got there nobody got there with good deeds nobody got there on their own it all came through the grace of god and you're going to make it too there's a whole heavenly host of witnesses sister joyce being one of the last ones to go up there and she would say the exact exact same thing it will be worth it all god has seen you on that side already you will be part of that don't lower yourself below that don't make less of yourself before that you are washed by the blood the precious blood of that lamb of god the grace of god is just as efficient today as just as great today as it ever was there's no less of it you don't diminish god by drawing from him understand that you don't diminish you don't make less of god there's not less of him because you draw from him he's that everlasting faithful fountain springs of living water mercy rewrote my life and never fails he's still there on the right hand of god grace god's perfect grace that's praying father that a cloud of witnesses if some of them could come back and sit down for a little while here get a chance to talk to us about it [Music] lord and they would they would just encourage us they would just tell us don't give up don't lose hope don't throw up your hands in despair it's worth it all [Music] the grace of god the perfect sacrifice of god paid for it all there is no entrance fee there is no entrance examination you don't have to pass a test to get in there you're being tested now for that entry lord let there be peace in the heart of each one of your believers these believers or these christians these these blood bought saints that are yours lord that one of these days will be on that side we'll be part of that cloud of witnesses lord that's saying it was worth it thank you for your mercy and your grace lord [Music] god's grace praise the lord it'll expand within [Music] [Applause] [Music] god's grace grace at his greater than all our sins praise grace god's grace grace that will pardon within praise god's grace grace that is greater than all our sins when you confess something to god and even when you go make it right with a brother and sister and you put it under the blood it no longer exists except here [Music] and the greatest battle ever fought happens here in each individual but let it settle down into the heart be at peace be at rest even as the scripture says to be at rest and be at peace when you're at rest you're not struggling with yourself because that's our biggest struggle self the one that goes with us everywhere we go lays down with us when we lay down looks at us straight back in the face when we look in the mirror the one that gives us most of our trouble and sometimes i say well just get rid of the mirror now fix this guy oh lord let this guy say lord i surrender all i yield it all let's just bow our heads for a moment just feel something here lord there are some that are still struggling with their past something that's happened something they did something they said an action that somebody did at them and it still has a hold in their life and it still causes hurts and griefs and pains but they've asked for forgiveness they've made it right lord let the peace of god settle in their lives in that situation did it as well as taking care of in your sight lord it never happened now in our sight we have a memory of it lord but let the peace of god settle in that situation right now for each one of them that all is well that it's not recorded against them lord but your mercy is extended to their lives in jesus name
