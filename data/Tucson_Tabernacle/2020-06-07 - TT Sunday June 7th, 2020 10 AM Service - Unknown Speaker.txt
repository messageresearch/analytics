[Music] [Music] I sing [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen you may be seated for her funeral to think that he loved you while you were unlovable that he looked at you and said I love you anyways reminds me what brother green taught us over the years when he would say what can you do to make God love you more we think we have to earn that we would have to do but he said look God loved you and he loved you with perfect love so nothing you could do can make him love you more so he turned around what could you what could you do make him love you less no he loved you perfectly so then he would say so what can be done about this you can love him more and I appreciate that that he loved us while we were unlovable at a time when we would have said you know there's no hope but God said oh yes service and I appreciate that so all we can do is return the favor and just love him and explicitly we have some some prayer requests emergent needs today I'm gonna bring to your attention for those of you that maybe have seen on the whatsapp on the email for our sister Karen Gil know they attend brother Robert Figaro's church they're also part of the group down in the Hereford area where the Jordan sister Martha that there are some time and family but sister Karen's family was also family that my dad met when he did missionary work in New Mexico what Minister for them so we've known the family for many years but as it was relayed to me sister Karen was home and she's probably about thirty years old sister Martha 4:35 okay with some young children and she wasn't feeling well so she had asked her daughter to to go get her she felt like she might have to throw up so go get her a bag or something like this how the story was related to me and the time her daughter came back her oldest daughter came back because she was unresponsive so they took her to the to the hospital and they're in Sierra Vista and then took her to hear it to TMZ and did a series of tests and could not determine but but she had seemed to have the like she'd had a stroke or something along that minded her husband brother Cesar had sent this text out he said all the tests that the doctors have done on my wife removing spine fluid to MRI scans and checking her brain activity with sensors on her head all have come back negative and all as well praise be to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they don't know what's happening and the only thing they can think is that her body entered a state of shock after not having enough sleep and stress the doctors are saying she might only need to get physical therapy to have to regain her full movement on her right side so again we thank the Lord for that but also to continue it keep them in prayer she has is it five children five five young children so it is something we want to memory keeping in a reminder of those things let's there was a couple other requests your brother saucy muscle fellow that sent him says pray for my vision I'm seeing double for a couple of weeks I've been have been having this issue and last week I started having black spot in the center of my vision I went to the VA but I didn't get any answer going to another doctor soon this has been a real big problem for him so let's remember brothers Othello and brother Jeremy Baggett is this this the same the written one and the one on is it the same okay it says prayers for for my daughter dusty she starts treatment on the 22nd for brain tumors it's one of brother Jeremy's co-workers they believe prayer and prayer the prayer faith that the tumors dry up and are gone now so that's our confession we go to the Lord and we say Lord I have a need but I confess that you've met it already that is our confession so and then sister there's one more hear from sister Debbie Calbert I know was here she she that's brother man Watkins mother-in-law she pulled a muscle and her back lifting something up above her head so she asked that we would remember her in prayer so we would do that of course anytime that somebody has a need we'd be willing to say just like I want somebody to pray for me then then you would ask prayer so let's stand and for the mic Alderson would you come and and take these take these requests in prayer and him and I always say lift up to one hand saying Lord I have a need and then lift up the other hand saying Lord I believe I'm more testified both ways thank you let's take these needs to the Lord father we just once again are thankful to be here today we're just to see old friends to be with other brothers and sisters as we prepare for your word we care these prayer requests their their needy or the young mother needs a complete restoration of her health the brother with this vision the tumors the back aches and I certainly couldn't speak for myself and probably everyone here we have a need and we just ask that you would come on the scene we just pray that you would bless the remainder of this service bless the brother that will be speaking and all of us as we listen to the message today which is grateful to be here we ask that you would bless the remainder of our day in your name we pray Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated so we do have some praises all soon how many would the lift a hand would just say I just want to say thank you Lord for being so good to me you know if just the fact that he watches over us it's more than enough how many times I know naomi was telling the other days she was driving over I believe to take Sarah over to the for her her dialysis they were in the turn lane and somebody just switched right on over she's honking her horn honking away trying to get their attention and they just keep right pushing her up against the curb and it was just a tiny little scratch on the side of the car for something that could have been a lot worse and you say well like the car got scratched what's that compared to losing the life or being hurt God is still mindful of us so I appreciate that sister Barbara Yarborough justice thank you for praying for sister Janet McGarry she passed away on Wednesday afternoon well while the whole family was gathered around her bed after reading Psalms 23 she slipped away into his presence and brother Robert had read the scripture after they finished singing so the Lord is so good he takes his children home in a way to comfort us too because that one that's gone home doesn't need to comfort anymore as those of us are on this side that need to have soul sister mercy she's here with us today I want to thank everyone for their prayers God has strengthened me every day and asking that we would continue to pray as she's been unstable on her feet and then brother Nathaniel sent in a Rodina they praise he said that was he want to get praise to the Lord he said I was just having a hard time a discouraged during the week he said and he he got a phone call from somebody who wanted to know if they could know from a complete stranger actually they asked if they could share a scripture with him he says and and it says we talked about the wonderful things of the Lord for about an hour and I asked him how they got my number they they told me they had searched they searched the neighborhood around and the phone numbers could they thought they'd be in the same neighborhood so I asked him if they lived on the northeast side and they said no I live on the south side by the freeway and they proceeded to ask me how I ended up way up there and we we realized that the Lord had intervened on my behalf he gave a scripture to somebody on the other side of town who doesn't know him got his phone number called him and said here let me encourage you with this what a mighty God we serve who could take his servant a prophet a man of God a sister and say put this on their heart to minister to somebody they may not even know because God knows that so do appreciate that and just a reminder for this Tuesday the 9th and let's see at 6 p.m. it brother David his sister mercy mignon sees home for Abraham's first birthday so do they still need to RSVP where sister Lydia is here it does say two artists VP and if you could talk to her today if you would like to go and we'll put this back up we know the blessing that goddess has had on their family even in a time of discouragement for all this that God is still been good and to see Abraham a year old now that's wonderful so I gave brother Jeremy uh some scripture I'd like to share with you before we have brother Aaron McGarry come to minister for us this morning so if you would put that scripture up brother Jeremy and second Samuel will read these it was a scripture of the day and this morning when I opened up my scripture of the day and I went back and read and it just just touch my with the merciful thou will show thyself merciful and with the upright man that will show thyself upright this is David speaking here with the pure thou shalt wilt show thyself pure and with the froward thou will show thyself unsavory sometimes when we look ourselves when we might say why is why does things seem to be going this way take a look at yourself and see could it be my attitude or the way I'm acting right now if I come home a little bit grumpy and then my wife is not too happy about it well maybe it's not my wife's problem maybe it's me although sometimes we're looking at everybody else being the problem but let's look at ourselves first and see what's my attitude and the afflicted people that will save but thine eyes are upon the haughty that thou mayest bring them down Lord keep my spirit sweet keep my spirit humble keep me in a way Lord that you would never look down to me says I really have to take that man down but let my heart be humble before you for thou art my lamp Oh Lord and the Lord will lighten my darkness for by V I have run through true my god bye my god I have leapt over a wall in God we have our whole being it's not of ourselves but in His goodness as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried and it is proven he is a buckler to all that trust him for who is God to save the Lord and who is Iraq they were gone God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect amen how many can say Amen to the Word of God so sometimes God just needs to remind us where we belong and where he is you know sometimes you might say well God you owe me oh if he gave us what we really owed where would we be today thank him for his grace let's stand is this morning we have brother Aaron McGarry with us a couple of visiting brothers with him and I'll let him introduce them to you and it'll be this morning this evening five o'clock this evening and how many are come believing that God has something for you how many say Lord whatever it is I'm willing to receive it this is how I want it Lord but God wants to give it to you this way let me have an attitude to receive it that way so Amen amazing grace how many know it's his amazing grace oh man [Music] house or it's a [Music] by [Applause] [Music] I twas grace that George was brain is that hard [Music] my fears [Music] [Applause] [Music] ha now let's just pray someone's here racecar racecar [Music] ha breathe raise praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we approach the word our gracious Heavenly Father we're so happy to be gathered together today in your house knowing that the beauty of the church is the character of its people and that what captures your attention what brings you up on the scene is not the physical structure in the four walls not even the mechanics of pews and pulpits but Lord it's the expectation of your people and the obedience to your word to assemble together in your name and father's we have come and gathered we have felt your presence as we have worshiped and we know that you have inhabited those praises and you're pleased with our offering but now Lord come take the bread of life rightly divide the word of truth to our hearts that it might give us strength and courage for the hour that we're living in Lord as believers we have a unique perspective upon the world we can see the things that are transpiring whether it be panicked because of a pandemic or even unrest and fear Lord that creeps into the hearts and minds of people even the injustice --is that we see and the terrible things that are being played out in social media and on the news Lord we look at it and realize it's because man has forsaken you and Lord we realize that the pain and the suffering that's in this earth we we could even take it back to the very beginning when sin first entered in Lord we realized that we have a different view in a different perspective and Father our hearts ache for our nation it aches for those around the world that are suffering and Lord we pray that you could use us to be lights in the dark time that we could have such the right the right kind of attitude towards injustice the right kind of attitude towards towards the wrongs and Lord the the right kind of disposition in the time of chaos and panic that others would see Christ see the love and forgiveness of Christ see you your light being made manifest in purity Lord and in righteousness so father we pray that you would feed us by your word strengthen us and encourage us we ask in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen a man I'm gonna be reading from Genesis chapter 2 Genesis chapter 2 verses 7 to 10 and then we'll skip to verse 15 and read the rest of the chapter it's good to be together with you today and we considered a great privilege to be able to minister it's not the desk that you stand behind that makes it an honor but it's the people that you stand before and we considered a real honor and privilege to stand before you and appreciate your pastor brother Matthew asking us to take the service we consider it an honor and we're grateful for that it's kind of hoping he would be here but then if he was here you'd want to hear him preach so it worked out well that he's not able to be here but I just wanted to extend those that appreciation about Matthew and his family for the opportunity to be here and we appreciate you very much we're praying for you and we're so happy to see the Lord's blessings upon you and I wasn't going to mention it but brother Aaron's kind of set me up there's a couple brothers here today that traveled from afar brother Tom Donaldson came in from Deming New Mexico and also brother James Hayes came in from Hot Springs Arkansas just to make sure I didn't cause any trouble today so it's nice to have some good friends that came out to be in the service we pray that Lord be their portion we look forward to saying hello to you I don't know four allowed to shake hands and this part of the world but we used to at least want to look you in the eye and tell you we love you we appreciate you and hope to get some fellowship in Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and this is you know we very familiar scripture reading to us and I'll give my title now maybe he sir could help process some of these scriptures were reading out I want to speak on the the subject of fulfilling the original and so really examining and looking at the the pattern that God laid here in the beginning it says in the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to sight and good for food and so this is a tremendous scripture we know that if it grew from the ground it was good to eat and so if God told them not to eat of a tree then it means it didn't grow from the ground and so was out of the ground may the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant this sight and good for food The Tree of Life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil and a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and it became in two foreheads and we'll just skip to verse 15 and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die so God wasn't trying to trick them if it grew out of the ground it was good to eat and so since this tree you can't eat it and if you eat it you die it means it didn't grow out of the ground so it must represent something different I think it's tremendous how the scripture lays that out and is pointing us to the original sin and verse 18 Oh Lord God said it was not good that man should be alone I will make him a help meet for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found to help meet for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed a man you may be seated I'm gonna read a statement from the message power of transformation here at the outset and I think these scriptures just form a wonderful a basis for this this quote because you can like kind of see some of the dynamics and the things that brother branham is gonna be referring to here he says there was Adam and Eve walking in the Garden of Eden every seed bringing forth and what brother branham begins to describe we could even say is commenting even on the silence between Genesis chapter 2 in Genesis chapter 3 because we can read how the man and the woman come to be and they're placed in the Garden of Eden and as they're setting they're in the Garden of Eden there under a commission under a commandment but yet there's not there's not anything that's developed or things that are said or a much description that's given to us about what that would have been like and so there's a there's a silence of the life that Adam and the woman were living in the Garden of Eden between Genesis chapter 2 in Genesis chapter 3 because if you just read it you'd think well the very first day after the woman was formed and brought unto the man the very next day or the very next moment the serpent is speaking to the woman and causing her to fall but we know that there was some manifestation some expression some life being lived in the garden that the scripture is silent - and it says in in many ways you could even look at how the life of Jesus Christ you have these silent years of Jesus Christ we see just a a glimpse of him at the age of 12 but then you have these silent years of Christ through his teenage years and even up to the age of 30 that the Bible doesn't speak to it doesn't give us the background or any description of the activities he would have done to know and so brother Branham in commenting on this he says every seed bringing forth it never could do nothing else it never could do nothing else because God said let it be that way it had to be that way and he says all how I'd like to stop here just a moment a minute to say see there is where we are facing yet the completion of that word and so when he speaks of completion it's bringing something to its fulfillment and he says oh that that is where we're facing yet the completion of that word and he's referring to that word which is bringing forth of its kind how every seed in the garden was bringing forth of its kind God said let it be that way and it could only be that way and there's something that strikes the prophet to such a magnitude Tory wants to just stop and say oh my just think of it today where we're living right now in what he's ministering in the power of transformation he's saying we're fulfilling what that original word was meant to be he says all I want to stop just for a minute to say this is what we're facing now the very completion of that word we're gonna finalize what God intended by creation we're gonna bring to completion what God was expressing there in the beginning and so to to to say that we're facing the completion of that word he's point us to the fact that God is now in this time satisfying his purpose of creation that God is going to satisfy the very intent of the design that he set forth what we look at and see in the Garden of Eden we see different elements coming into existence we see God giving certain Commandments he's saying what we're facing today is the very satisfaction of what God envisioned in the beginning he had an intent he had an ax per purpose so when I I used this title fulfilling the original we're wanting to look at what God had in his mind in the beginning and he's bringing it to pass and this message is is characterized as being a restoration of the original and that was necessary and I want to just put a bring that into view and then kind of put it in this this frame it was necessary for there to be a restoration in order to complete and fulfill God's purpose of the original because you could see different patterns and we may not take the time to do it this morning we may refer to it again this evening but there's certain times where God was expressing something and manifesting something but he never got the satisfaction or the fulfillment of what he intended in that expression so we speak of fulfilling the original there had to be a restoration of the original even a restoration of the original faith and a restoration of the original church and a restoration of even the original Word not just to say all it's been restored in reform rep but rather that God could bring the final step and the climax for what he intended by that word we could just maybe I'll just use it in this context you can understand what I'm pointing to we know that God birthed his church on the day of Pentecost and that was the Alpha bride and we see the great power of God in the and the the word of the Lord increasing in signs and wonders working within the church but God didn't just raise up a church and raise up a body so that every member of that body would go through the cycle of a spiritual revival only to be met with a literal grave that's not what God intended by his church he actually has it written in the New Testament it's prophesied that there would finally come a time where the body of Christ would place that last enemy under their feet so God's original intent and design behind the church wouldn't be that every saint would go to a grave but that finally one day there would be a triumph over the grave and a triumph over death and a meeting in the air so God doesn't restore the original just so that we could be right back in the same pattern of revival and death that even the original Church to come to but rather raise up something in the last days that would take that final climax and go to a meeting in the air so there's a restoration of the original in order to fulfill God's ultimate purpose and purpose speaks of intention when you when you have a purpose it's your aim or it's your goal what's your reason for doing something why are you doing what's your purpose and the very word purpose it's it brings up the prefix of pur which means to put forth or posed and then also posed to put or to place that's when you purpose something you put forth to place something it's a placing and when you speak of the purpose of something if you purpose something it's to design it or to have it used in a certain way it's been purposed for a particular meaning or thing and so when we speak of our own purpose and purposes and the purpose of God we could even say it this way and I know it may be a staggering statement but it's the greatest force and the most important thing there is if God has a purpose if God has a design if God has a desire and we could even say his purpose it's his then it must ultimately conform to that and fit within that this is how powerful purposes brother Graham said Satan can't take you to God's purpose for you is finished that means if gold has an intention if God has an aim if God has a design if he has a reason for your being and then it there's nothing that can take you until you've satisfied that purpose so - purpose something or the purpose of something it's a placing in position to accomplish a specific goal you don't just throw some why is that thing sitting there oh I just put it there there's no purpose to it but when you play something somewhere with intent and and reason then that's your that's the purpose behind it and it becomes the purpose of the thing and brother Graham says oh if the church only knew its position and he says it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is so there's to have an understanding of purpose to have a place in in your position brother Branham actually relates the translation of our bodies to the knowledge and understanding and your positional placing that all the church only knew its position and it's not just a lot of knowing what you are and where you are but it's the whole understanding of who you are your position your understanding the time you're living it's the whole thing and recognizing who the bride is and what she's been called to in this hour the rapture will go when she knows these things she's coming to her purpose to recognize her very purpose and brother Branham says oh I'd like to just stop a minute to say this is where we're facing yet the completion of that word so we are facing the completion or the fulfillment of the original purpose of God he created the world for reason he designed he designed a life for a very reason and we're facing today the very satisfaction of God's intent brother Branham in question and answers part three says the very creator that created the earth for a purpose he said Satan defiled it so God created the earth for a purpose it had it had a design to it God was expressing certain things even in creation and even in the creation of the earth and the bringing forth things out of the earth God had a great purpose for it but he said Satan defiled it Satan seemingly interrupted God's plan that God had a purpose with the earth he says Satan defiled it Satan was just working within the framework of God's plan to manifest something great but it shows God had a purpose then Satan comes in and tries to defile it but the random rights in the church age book he says the heart purpose the eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world so the heart purpose and the eternal purpose of God this is what made him who he was when someone has a heart purpose and the very eternal purpose of God is to take the bride of his own choosing that becomes what his obsession is or that becomes what he's a characterized by this is what we know that guy his whole purpose in life is to do this and well that guy it's his heart that's what's in his heart this is easy his Drive and his eternal ambition brother Branham is characterizing God as having one ambition and that's to have a bride of his own choosing she says and that purpose was in himself and be need eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world now that's staggering to think that God is willing to be defined as a being who desired to have a wife he's willing to be defined as one who so so desired to have fellowship and so desire to have a bride of his choosing that there that very passion and that very drive to have a wife caused him to form himself into a light which we call the logos and then me to begin to create all for the singular objective of ultimately one day having a wife of his choosing that's why creation exists that's why the world exists is not so that God could just have a human experiment and not that God could well let's just see what happens and what unfolds but he had a singular purpose and a singular objective I must have a bride of my own choosing millirem says in the message paradox God made the earth he made it for purpose to take a church out a bride and that's the most important job in the world this is brother branham's language this is his message to to us that God had a purpose for the earth and that was to take a bride out of him and he says that's the most important job in the world is to call the bride forth and to bring them to their place and in their position so he made the earth for the purpose of getting a bride out of it and the chapter seven at the church age book he writes first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose to bring forth a people likened himself that would be a word bride so this is God's purpose so then you could it's very easy then just to understand even what's bubbling up in my heart today and fulfilling the original satisfying God's original intent and his design when you fulfill the original you're bringing forth a very hard purpose of God so you can say now I've achieved for myself this bride of my own choosing and in Genesis we can see the beginning of all things and then we could just start looking at God's pattern and God's purpose and then you can even see how Satan tries to attack God's purpose in God's plan but I want to I want to look at it in detail this morning to see the beginning of what we're finishing to see the beginning of what it is that we're fulfilling brother Branham says in the message marriage and divorce he says Genesis is the seed chapter to every question in the Bible and you always have to go back to the seed to see what kind of a seed is in the field to find out what your crops will be if you know the seed that sown then you can have an expectation as to what crop will come up though brother Branham says go back to Genesis identified the seed understand the seeds that were sown and then you'll know what kind of plant you're gonna see in the field or the messes it all come up in Genesis it's a seed you start in Genesis you'll get your picture straight so if you want to understand what's taking place today it has to line up with the seed that Sonne in the beginning God can't so one pattern and have one purpose in the beginning and then vary from that in the end so he says you go back it all comes out in Genesis it's all in seed form Genesis is the seed chapter so brother Bram says there was Adam and Eve in the garden every seed bringing forth he says there is where we're facing yet the completion of that word the seeds that were sown in the beginning the pattern that was laid in the original whatever saying that's being finished today that's important to catch that when brother Branham says that he's directly implying that there was something that was not finished there was something that was not yet completed by by Adam and Eve but yet there was something expressed in them and we know when brother Branham preaches Christ as the mystery of God revealed he said there was a three-fold purpose to Christ and that any and he goes to that threefold purpose and to have and to manifest himself in his son to have preeminence in his bride and and we'll go into detail here in a moment in that sermon and he says to restore back to the Garden of Eden and I want to read those statements in detail but then he says this statement the threefold purpose of God manifested in Adam and Eve so the threefold purpose is first manifested in Adam and Eve now I would say that it wasn't apparent that that was a three-fold purpose so we could say that brother Branham is identifying a mystery that was hidden in them his purpose was a hidden mystery that's actually being manifested in Adam and Eve that if you look at Adam and the woman there's a mystery to God there's a mystery of God that's being expressed and he says the threefold purpose of God was manifested in Adam and the woman and if you don't know what that threefold purpose is it can actually be hidden in the simplicity of a man and a woman being placed in a garden so the purpose of God is being completed by fulfilling what God manifested in Adam and the woman whatever that purpose was whatever that design was whatever God was foreshadowing in typing in Adam and the woman we are facing today the very completion and the finishing of that manifestation and brother Branham says this in Christ is the mystery of God revealed and I'm gonna read just a few statements here just to see this continuity he says what is his three-fold purpose manifest himself in Jesus Christ now when he manifests himself in Jesus Christ he's that's the bridegroom it's a manifestation of the bridegroom and it's a manifestation of the last Adam so in manifest himself in Jesus Christ it's a it's the perfect fulfillment of what Adam was foreshadowing it's an expression of Adam so he says manifest himself in Jesus Christ to come into the body by Jesus Christ this is the last woman or the bride you have a second Adam and you have the last Adam now you have the last woman or you have the bride so you can see how brother Aaron says the threefold purpose of God manifested in Adam and Eve you had Adam who prefigures Christ you have the woman that prefigures the bride and he says to have preeminence ah's and that's in his body the bride to restore back to Eden bring back that which is lost so this is the three-fold purpose right bridegroom bride and then Eden a Garden of Eden condition he says now through that he's talked about the tree of life he brings forth a bride tree which will be The Tree of Life restored back to him back to God he says in it's actually expression of God he says as husband a tree of life restored back to him God expressed those are my words as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden by the same word and the same God made manifest in husband and wife the same bride tree back again so this is brother branham amplifying this threefold purpose of God manifested in Adam and the woman it's going to bring the Tree of Life will be restored back to him and how is it expressed as a husband and wife in the Garden of Eden the expression of God now is it's not just a being in eternity but now it's God being expressed as a man and a woman in the Garden of Eden God made manifest in husband and wife he says then he says this further and now on his way back to the original Eden restoring back his bride in fellowship so the original Eden has something to do with the bride being back in fellowship he says back with God as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden sure Christ and his bride now and I think that this is probably maybe just sharing what may be pulling back the curtain a bit to hear hear my thinking and what's in my heart the the the mechanics and the dynamics of this and I think it's easy for us to think on the man the woman and then there's going to be this location you know that we're coming to but or even a future millennium or a future a future place but he's talking about the expression of not just having a man and not just having a woman but at being under the headship of the word to fulfill his design to fulfill his intent to fulfill his purpose so there's something being expressed in this all right we don't want to just narrow it to this idea of oh well we'll have a man and we'll have a woman we'll have like a garden a really nice green lush place to live there's something there's something a greater spiritual application to this that'll have more meaning than just fantasizing about some future garden that we're going to be walking through and so brother Branham says it's a revelation it's eternal as God's Word is eternal look the the threefold purpose of God's great mystery is revealed God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the lost eve back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden so it's not it's not a physical location a geographical location where God has manifested Christ now he has a bride and we need to be physically gathered together with Jesus of Nazareth and then go walk on the shores of Galilee or find that place near the Euphrates where the Garden of Eden was but he's pointing out that this great expression this great manifestation of God's eternal purpose and the very mystery of God as we were found shipping on with some friends yesterday have the very mystery of goddess to be finished in this time and but it's in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished and brother Branham I believe was very purposeful in titling his message Christ is the mystery of God revealed in other words this is my ministry I am the seventh angel and I've got to bring a message that finishes this mystery so he preaches it and I know maybe it might not seem very very direct but I believe he was very intentional in using that phrase and preaching that substance because he said Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he's saying don't God's great mystery is revealed we've come to the finishing we've come to the climax God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church what for what purpose in order to redeem the lost eve or the lost woman back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden so it's not back to the original location in the Garden of Eden but there must be a Garden of Eden condition so what were those conditions what were the dynamics what were the mechanics what was God envisioning that's what this message brings out of you we're completing the original manifesting the full maturity of the original spoken word seed to fulfill the purpose so back to the original is a restoration of that image in the Garden of Eden and it's a restoration of the condition in the Garden of Eden there was a condition there were certain things about that that scene and that place God God took great care to describe it the way that he did God took great care to place it the way that he did because God knew that we would be here we're not here as the result of God not planning correctly and figuring out a way to keep the devil out no God allowed it to be this way to manifest his great plan and his great purpose and so that he could achieve to himself a bride of his choosing that would love him just absolutely love him that would love him without having ever seen him and this would be a real love relationship with the woman who knows and sees and is recognized and believed all of his attributes and characteristics and so the first masterpiece was Adam and the woman in a perfect Eden the first masterpiece wasn't the earth the first masterpiece wasn't just a man on earth but it was the man and the woman in a perfect Eden Villa BAM called it the masterpiece family villa BAM in the masterpieces for nearly two thousand years God has been making himself a masterpiece because he struck Adam to get a part of him a rib to make a wife for him and and so he says and just maybe I'm jumping in right in the middle of a subject here that I know you're familiar with he's identifying that the bride is a masterpiece so he says he took a piece out of Adam to make a wife for him and he says and now that perfect masterpiece he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him so what God was reflecting in Adam was foreshadowing what he wanted to do in Christ it was all part of his hidden purpose and his hidden place and he hid it from Satan because know there's no doubt that Satan thought man I know exactly where he's going I know exactly what he's gonna do he's gonna bring forth the son by this woman and that woman is gonna bring forth the son in the image of Adam and this is going to be the kingdom that God is going to reign in and this is going to be for all eternity and he goes I don't have the power to create my own kingdom I can never be worshipped as God I can never send to the above the stars of God but what I can do is I can prover t' and i can mix up his plan and cut him off and so he causes the woman to fall in order to bring forth perversion and he doesn't realize that god placed the woman on that basis so that she would fall so that God could manifest all his great eternal attributes because then immediately just showing that God's purpose is being made manifest immediately Adam instead of saying all your ruined spoiled goods woman God give me another woman I didn't didn't say well if memory serves me correctly you took this one rib out and hey got a few more got a few more ribs here Lord so let's just see how far we can take this do we finally kind of get this right yeah you might want to tweak what you did the last time because this one didn't work out no Adam instinctively went through an act of love the love act went and redeemed his wife and notice and I just feel so much inspiration now and it's a compliment to you you're hungry for the word you're desirous of this words you believe that this message though it may have been preached fifty years ago you believe there's still life and revelation to come out of it and it's a compliment to you that you could you could pull a minister into these channels to expound upon these things but Adams instinct was not to ask for God to create another one nor was it his instinct to put her away in divorce because he was operating under a single marriage covenant and under that covenant there was no putting away to remarry again there was just simply the instinct and the act of redemption and he took the woman and redeemed her it wasn't well let's just get a new one it was a redemptive act and what was he expressing that God had the same kind of love and passion for his own wife that he would redeem her regardless of the cost he would redeem her and he would wash her and he would keep her and he would bring a wife back to himself and I if I could say this this is just personal now so if you want to put that notation in your notes where it says well this was the man giving his opinion feel free just to put my initials there out next to it but I think we're too quick to focus on what brother Graham said in marriage and divorce as it pertains to he can she can't instead of identifying that here's a profit restoring us back to a single marriage covenant it wasn't he can she can't if you really want to get honest was never do such a thing as that again and teach your children not to do it that's what he was zeroing in on and he was Irian zero in on the fact that the reason why we have a double covenant is because of the fall and when Jesus was asked about divorce he went back to the beginning when Paul dealt with marriage he went back to the beginning they didn't go from the double covenant they went to the single covenant they said well then why did Moses tell away so we could divorce he said because the hardness of your heart that's the reason why there was a writ of divorce is because the hardness of hearts could we not then as men and women today say my heart having been restored back to the original word I don't want to have this mind set in this thinking well I can just put it away and get another one but lord let me have a heart like Christ back to the original single marriage covenant again to be one that would be have an instinct to redeem though that may be applicable in marriage but just think of our attitude sometimes towards people who backslider wonder away or have a different opinion on certain things we're just too quick to kind of kick them out give him the left for the fellowship as it were instead just thinking all God could you would you bring them back so he says a Christ now in Christ it's so Adam was reflecting something he's portraying something very beautiful so he says he struck a piece off of Calvary he got a piece off of him he says it's just the New Testament that's all talking about an understatement there talk about just kind of qualifying a little bit my goodness if I'm gonna be a juster that's all let me be that it's just the New Testament that's all the so the the part that he gets from Christ is the New Testament now we think while we think red-letter and we think books of Paul and Peter and John and these things but no brother branham is saying the New Testament is the bride she is the testament to the New Covenant she is the testimony she is the proof she's the very manifestation but Apollo fontaine just ministered at our church back in North Carolina how thy people shall be for sign and a wonder and the people you are the evidence you are the proof and you're our God just help me to express this the right way the only proof that you need of this message being right is the newness of life you have in your own soul I can't reason with this I can't argue with this I cannot deny this my life is the proof to me that this is the word so he said it's just the New Testament that's all and then he expresses this he fulfilled the Old Testament Christ did now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled the new and old is husband and wife and had taken the old to foreshadow the new Christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another masterpiece in the making the bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament then I just want it all the bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another masterpiece in the making here's another piece to that masterpiece family coming back the bride fulfills all the hope all the expectation all the promise and all the potential of the original faith of the New Testament church otherwise brother Branham wouldn't say well they all wanted to live in this thing if all the hope all the potential and everything it could be was has already been finished and fulfilled then they would say yeah I don't want label to see it just go ahead and give me the Upper Room go ahead let me have those those those years after Christ walk the face of the earth let me live in that day but brother Graham says no that of all of them in all ages wanted to live in this day why would they choose this dark Laodicean time could you imagine all of us all 2020 and knowing 2020 so you know there's gonna be kovat 19 yeah yep I realize the pandemic yep you know there's gonna be this right listen we're only halfway through I mean what's gonna come next and and you look at everything going on and listen I have a I have a room a burden in a heart for our country to see just things decades and hundreds of years of in justices and listen if they wanted to go ahead and take the lid off the things the white man's been doing to those of other races and we we would all be trembling in our boots brother madam said it exactly right the white man's the renegade and there's a lot of seeds that have been sold that are coming back and being manifested and hurts and pains and hatred and rebellion and could you imagine being a prophet back then in seeing this day and say yeah that's what I want to live that's the age you want to live in what were they seeing what were they focusing on and what was it that was in their hearts that they why did they want to live in this age not because the condition of laodicea not because of the days of lot not because of the days of Sodom not because the days of Noah because the day when the Son of Man is revealed in this day and this time to bring forth this full purpose they say yes these have all been wonderful ages but God has always been moving towards this and I want to be there when he achieves it finally I want to be there in the end when he has what he's been wanting all this time the bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament your that masterpiece but BAM says in the message masterpiece he says Michelangelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back so when when Michelangelo marred his masterpiece I mean maybe you could glue that piece back on but there'd always be a flaw unrepairable a blemish that would always remain he says but God's going to do it he's going to bring this little bride that smitten right back to the side of the original word you know we used the phrase smitten when I when a boy is just fallen in love with a girl I say oh he's smitten she smitten the bride she's been smitten she's been smitten with love and also brother and says it's got a it's got to be smitten in order to speak so the very thing you're the very smiting that we take the very persecution the very hardships we enduring it only me qualifies us to speak qualifies us to be the final voice to the final age he's going to bring this little bride that's smitten right back to the side of the original word and there he is there's the masterpiece the family back again in the Garden of Eden how is this bride going to do this how is the week going to do this Malachi for said in the last days it would be back restored back like the beginning that's the first and original masterpiece he's gonna bring this little bride back to his side the side of the original word right back to the side of the original the family back again in the Garden of Eden restored back like the beginning he's identifying a pattern in the beginning that were fulfilling and Satan's Eden and I'm an express this not to get you with nervous or anything but I just purposely didn't look at my watch for the cloth because I wanted to finish as soon as I could you know if you look at your watch and think oh man I got I got plenty of time I got plenty of time because I keep looking at it wrong like man that back that minute hands just not moving you realize an hour later it was this it was the hour hand in message Satan's EB says having faith in all his word his seeds speaking of God brought and Eden of holiness love and eternal life that's what God's Eden produced holiness and it brought an Eden of holiness of love his church now this is I'm a guy I want to slow down there his word brought an Eden of holiness love eternal life that's what God's Eden produced he says holiness it brought an Eden of holiness love understanding perfection and eternal life in other places he said they had perfect love perfect love all around of a perfect understanding of God's love he said no death around them at all so that's the Garden of Eden condition it doesn't have to be a specific geographical location upon a certain latitude and longitude but now it's not according to coordinates but it's according to condition he said this is what God's Eden produced so when we think about a Garden of Eden and being restored back like it was at the beginning of family back in the Garden of Eden we can't think of time travel or moving dimensionally to be in a certain location think of characteristics think of the condition in the atmosphere because then Bertha says that's what his church will be at the so when he says this and he speaks I wants to bring the bride back to the condition in the Garden of Eden it's not that he wants to get us physically back into a lush green garden and I'm repeating that over and over so you can catch this spiritual layer here he's saying that's what his church will be at the at the end it will be the same thing so what he is doing is he's connecting what the bride is now with the original Eden condition there are certain attributes and characteristics of that garden in Eden he says now the bride is going to manifest the same thing that was manifested in that hayden in that garden the bride will be the same thing that's what his church will be at the end and doesn't say that's where that's where she'll be in the end that's his church will be in the end she will be that she will be a garden of holiness she will be a manifestation of love and eternal life because God's Eden produced holiness and and love and understanding and perfection so that's what we are today we are manifesting his planting we are manifesting his holiness his love as understanding his perfection no death around us eternal life this bride is going to manifest the entire New Testament that's what his church will be at the end it will be the same thing in Genesis chapter 2 verse 8 he says this and I now and then I kind of could say that this is where we transition now to focus on what we had read in our text to see this picture unfolding says in Genesis chapter 2 verse 8 it says after the Lord God had formed man of the dust of the ground because he first makes him supernatural being and then he forms out of the dust of spirit now comes into flesh it says in the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden eastward even in the the Hebrew means beginning in Eden and Eden means delight God's delight so God is it's not just as Moses is riding this it's not that it needs to be technically correct and say that location-wise it was it was directionally east in the garden but rather God is showing that even in the beginning he had planted a garden for his own delight God the Lord God planted a garden in the very beginning in Eden and then he says and there he put the man whom he had formed so God in the beginning had already had this garden and now he takes this man once he forms an inflation now he puts him in the garden that he had formed and notice how brother branham points out this beautiful distinction when Adam and Eve had their children in Eden not in the Garden of Eden because they had been driven out of the Garden of Eden but they were still in Eden and the Garden of Eden laid east in Eden so there was something special that was planted in Eden and that was lost through the fall and it's and now he says they were still in Eden but the Garden of Eden was a special place they were still in Eden but the garden which laid Easter was planted in the beginning her eastward in Eden there the access to that expression access to that conditioned access to that place had been cut off so he says it this way in Satan's Eden when he got it all made and finally arrived with its headquarters of Earth in a beautiful spot Lane East of Eden called the Garden of Eden so it's now a spot god made the world's headquarters in the Garden of Eden in Egypt right at the east of the garden was the headquarters and over the whole situation he put his son and his son's wife over all of it that's what God did he put them in full control notice how he says this them in full control they could speak to the winds and it would cease to blow they could speak to the tree and it would move from here to there the lion and the wolf fed together and the lamb laid down with them there was no evil remember I want you to connect this now with brother Branham saying in Christ and the mystery of God revealed that were to be restored back to a Garden of Eden condition a particular harmony with there would have got a particular expression of God purpose in his design he says he put them in control they could speak they could speak so even though we might conjure up this image that the woman would tell Adam what to do but she was also given the authority and the power to do it herself he says it was perfect peace perfect harmony everything in perfection and when God had it under his control this is that Garden of Eden condition this is the Garden of Eden or the garden in Eden and notice he had his world he had it all in operation he had everything coming everything Eden vegetations nothing to die nothing to be ruined nothing to be spoiled it was just perfect and overall he placed his beloved children his son and his daughter a husband and wife to control it so the garden is a beautiful expression the garden is for showering the bride it shows a husband and a wife with full control and supreme control over everything that's in it and I want to identify this that the garden itself this place that brother man's describing perfect peace perfect harmony everything in perfection everything under control the garden itself was foreshadowing the Bride of a perfect Eden because it's going to be a perfect evening and he's and the garden that God plants eastward in Eden is actually represented in foreshadowing the bride because the garden in Scripture is figurative of a bride and it's verse 9 says the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man and in verse 9 says the Tree of Life also in the midst of the garden so the tree of life is in the midst of the garden verse 10 says and the river went out of Eden to water the garden now you can see and we won't take time to do it this morning but you can see how this begins to express the very existence and the presence of Christ in the midst of his bride and how from you shall flow rivers of water and the operation of the body and a river went out of Eden to water the garden and all these different things that are being expressed here you can see how it's foreshadowing its prefiguring the very mechanics and dynamics of God's body and so we're just these scriptures identify what was being foreshadowed in the garden because it's a hidden mystery that today is being finished in hosea chapter 2 verse 23 and I want to just use a few scriptures here to identify this garden that God planted Easter in the Eden it was foreshadowing you it says in Hosea 2:23 and I will sew her unto me in the earth God planted a garden eastward in Eden he says I will sew her unto me in the earth so the Lord planted a bride at the very beginning of Eden there was a planting even before Satan got to the woman your seed was already sown even before Satan tried to interrupt God's plan God had already before Satan got to the woman God had already envisioned you and had set things in motion and sold the seeds that would manifest as you today he says I was so her unto me and the earth I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and I will say to them which were not my people that aren't my people and they shall say thou art my god this is a beautiful prophecy of the Gentile bride the heathen the reprobate the ones without the promise they that are not identified with Israel they that cannot lay claim to Abraham Isaac and Jacob I will show her a Gentile bride unto me in the earth and even though they were not a people there will be a revelation come forth that I am their God and they are my people and how does he do it by first sowing her in the earth well do you see who the treasure in the field is you didn't go find Christ hid in the field you weren't rooting around and found a I found a great treasure he hid in the field and gold Christ I better hide you and I'm gonna go sell everything I have so I can buy the field so I can get you that it doesn't even make any sense if you think about it that way but the treasure hidden the field was you you were sewn by him in the earth so he paid the price as a sacrifice when he shed his blood he purchased the whole earth pay for sins of all of mankind for his elect sake for the treasure that was hid in the field also her unto me in the earth and he says it in the very beginning Genesis 2:8 and the Lord God planted a garden in the beginning in Eden because he showed his bride already in the earth and so Song of Solomon chapter 4 verses 12 to 16 listen to the very language of the scripture a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits campfire with spikenard spikenard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices not a doTERRA Young Living in sight just all the originals there says a mountain a fountain of gardens a well of living waters and strains from Lebanon listen how he's described it in the Garden of Eden at realized also in the midst of the god of river went out of Eden into water the garden and now he's describing his spouse and described her as having plants and a fountain of gardens a well of living water streams from Lebanon so he says awake o north wind and come thou south blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out and then the bride says let my beloved come into his garden this is the bride's response now so you have the bridegroom say oh like a garden enclosed is my wife very language of the Song of Solomon describes the wife as the garden enclosed and he describes her in this very lush and rich environment and then he says all come winds blow upon that that the spices may flow and now the bride's response is let my beloved come into his garden and eat his Pleasant fruits and then he answers back I am come into my garden my sister my spouse now why is they even saying my sister my spouse because it's representative of same bone the same flesh bone of my bone flesh of my flesh the same origin the same Genesis I am coming to my garden my sister my spouse as I've gathered my myrrh with my spice I've eaten my honeycomb with my honey and I've drunk my wine with my milk all friends this is a continuing Chapter five all friends drink yeah a drink abundantly open loving her so beautiful what God is expressing in the scripture the bride say come come into their garden it's the one that you've preserved this one that you've kept come now come into your garden he says I am come into my garden and what did God do in Genesis chapter 2 verse 15 and the Lord God took the man and he put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it that's the very image we see in the beginning the very pattern we see laid forth in the beginning the very original is I am come down I placed him in the Garden of Eden and now represented a song a psalm is a garden with the wife said come come into your God he says I am coming to my garden and as they had twenty seven two and three and that day sing me unto her a vineyard this is what you sing to her you are a vineyard of red wine full the stimulation of Revelation a vineyard of red and red wine high the Lord do keep it I will water it every morning moment lest any hurt it I will keep it night and day who's the it it's her the vineyard high the Lord do dress that I do keep it I will water and I will protect it I will keep it night and day lest anyone come to hurt and try to hurt it that's why brother Branham said that God will do everything he can to see that he turns your hand this bride does not fear tribulation he will keep her from it I will keep it our water I'll do everything to bring it to full manifestation to where it serves its purpose a garden has a purpose purpose to be fruitful all blow winds that spices may flow thereof I've eaten my honeycomb I've drunk on my wine my milk old friends drinking abundantly where did it come from from the wife from the garden Ephesians chapter 5 verses 25 to 32 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it he could not have given a higher standard of love and care than that standard that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word I have the Lord do keep it I will water it he's the husbandman sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their own wives that's how you have to love your wife so I've men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh and when you think about this Paul is very directly identifying the two types and the two perfect reflections of this note when he speaks about a woman being the flesh of a man he says no man has ever yet lovers or wise as their own bodies no man ever yet hated his own flesh he's referring to the wife and the woman to Adam was Adams flesh she had come from his flesh so no man has ever yet hated his own flesh the first men know Adam has ever hated his flesh so when the woman came forth Adam did not hate the woman he redeemed her and then now when the woman comes forth from Christ the church is his own flesh and his own blood and the last Adam does not hate his own flesh and now we are to aspire to that image as men no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh he says this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church where was Paul drawing the mystery from he's preaching his revelation of the mystery in the Garden of Eden he's actually identifying the original threefold purpose hid in Adam and the woman that's where he's bringing it from this is what he's challenging us as husbands and wives to attain to attain to the standard that was given before the double covenant entered in when Paul is it strike to think of all our marriage ceremonies when when we have our marriage ceremonies in the message we don't conduct them from Genesis 3 we conduct them and we use the language of Genesis chapter 2 we use the language under a single marriage covenant and this is what Paul instructs husbands under this is what he's telling he had caught the his speaking of a mystery that was manifested in Adam and the woman and progresses there is where we're faced and yet the completion of that word the finishing of that mystery there very full manifestation of what God had desired in the beginning his brother ever said about Paul his revelation then whose prophecy for today what Paul preached and what Paul taught then was actually prophecy for today you can say that all know Paul had this and Paul had that and you could take all those statements and amen amen amen it doesn't change it at all but you must recognize the prophetic element of the things that Paul taught if I could just lay this in this just food for thought when brother BAM said I preached the same gospel Paul preached he says that before the seals are open and the opening the seals was not just to repeating what Paul preached and where BAM says I preached what Paul preached he didn't just merely mean I'm just saying only what Paul said and just repeating what Paul said there was an element of prophecy to Paul's message that brother Branham fulfills his ministry fulfills of this message brings to pass and in that the entire New Testament is brought into existence in manifestation and O'Brien and his preaching of a great myth speaking of a great mystery so they're in order there to be for there to be a restoration of the original to come back a restoration back to Eden back to the original it requires a full manifestation of the Burr I know you can't just have bridegroom and you can't just even have Garden of Eden characteristics you must have a bride in order to come back to the original you must have this very image where the Lord God who planted a garden in the beginning and even a garden of God's delight the Garden of Eden even means God's delight there must be something he delights in God has that planting and then the Bible says in there he put the man whom he had formed in order for us to be facing yet the completion of that word we must have the dynamic of Christ the Tree of Life coming down into the midst of her to be united with her brother Bram says and does God change his mind he says Jesus came in three names son of man which is a prophet son of God which went through the church age then son of David but in between the son of God which is in the church age and the son of David which is in the millennium when I'm just adding that part of the church age and millennium in there according to his own word and according to Malachi 4 in many scriptures he is to return back into his church in physical form in human being in the people in human beings in the way of being a prophet so what was the very expression of manifestation of Malachi for a son of man revealing the son of man how it went is the way that he returns back into his church a son of man reveals the son of man he returns back into his church in physical physical form in the people in human beings don't just leave it in the manifestation of other Branham but he's in his people he's in human beings he's in you today what does it manifest it manifests the son of man again what is it it's him the tree of life coming back into the garden again the very people that he's formed for himself he's come back into his church in physical form revelations 3:20 this is the beautiful part of letting the label to see in church age that no other age do they have this in this age brother man call the Laodicean age the most ridiculous church age I don't want to have anything to do with Laodicea he said God didn't have one compliment for her and that's the truth and the very last order the Reformation and the messenger to the Laodicean age is bred round called the Holy Ghost in the beginning restoration against the Batchelor ghost the last or the Reformation and at this moment that these gifts are being poured out and the church is going forth with great signs and wonders a genuine outpouring a genuine Pentecost listen if they weren't who they were we can't be who we are if you make them to be nothing there's still another step that I was gonna have to come somehow from somewhere but because they were who they are we are the climax we heard the capstone and so we would never never belittle Pentecost never belittle what happened in Laodicea but God had not one good thing to say about him he calls them ridiculous brother Mammon the preview of the bride sees them descending in the chaos but at the same time they're going into chaos there's a bride in the Laodicean Church age that's going up in the existence at the same time the Laodicean ages in chaos she has been raptured up quickly to meet the Word of God and she's feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man to give her strength to fly above all the things of the world fly above denominations and she's having this invitation in Revelations 3:20 that isn't identified anywhere else in other ages behold I stand at the door and knock showing that Christ is a fugitive to his own church he's been kicked out of the Laodicean Church age but yet he has a voice if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me what happens when you hear that voice he comes into the garden for a feast in this endtime I will come into her to suck with her and to feast with her and build a brand and message Christ revealed in his own word will invite the musicians to come my doesn't that build expectation like oh you know what now all of a sudden people want to start a man and you know this is pretty getting pretty good now that we see the musicians all right and once you get up here you can go right back gnomes kidding no I'm gonna close just place something in your hearts there's something there if the Lord's dealt with you just want to show that confidence and the gifts that he's placed if you feel in your heart to play some she can begin to play it I just have a couple statements I want to read brother Branham says and Christ revealed in his own word he says see down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went into the ground the complete seed then it come out through the feet Luther come back then through Wesley then into Pentecostals the tongues in the lips now it's in the eyes the prophetic of Malachi 4 and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence and he says this just skipping a Liberty says it's God himself it's be coming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adams was at the beginning you see why he calls us an astronaut age in Eagle age a bride age he's able to achieve to himself the bride when a man and a woman become one the complete body of Christ is revealed how in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adams was at the beginning this is what we're completing today this is what we're fulfilling fulfilling now in this age Genesis 2:8 and there he put the man whom he had formed I am come into my garden my sister my spouse that's what this message reveals to us I had this quote as we were referring to the beginning about purpose I want to inspire with you you with this state materials we close he says I join with Jove of old I know my Redeemer liveth and at the last day he shall stand on the earth it's a purpose that God has he's standing today on the earth in his people as we speak of our Lord Jesus Christ he will not set earth foot on earth in the time of this coming but it's the third coming that most people are looking to when he comes back to earth in the Millennium and he was to step on the earth physically that's when most people are expecting his coming but in the time that we're living now how else is he standing on earth except you be his bones be his flesh and the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly so since I know my Redeemer liveth and at the last day he shall stand on the earth it's a purpose that God has and then he says with such inspiration I must serve this purpose this purpose if I could say this this purpose have been God manifested in flesh this purpose of being the completion of what he had in his mind in the beginning I must serve this purpose he says my whole life must be brought into his purpose and his program he says each of us is that way could you say in your heart today I must serve this purpose this original purpose not what man would have of me not what ideology would have of me not what the governments would have a mere politics and social media but this purpose I must avail myself to this purpose oh I want my entire being he says I must serve this purpose my whole life must be brought into his purpose and his program listen we will not have peace until this happens we must give ourselves to this to fulfill the original Oh each of us is this way my whole life must be brought into his purpose not does he want me to be a schoolteacher and does he want me to do - this doesn't mean - the purpose of being the very word of God made manifest to fulfill his original design let's stand to our feet you spray for me this afternoon I just I want to continue on this subject this is just different directions to go I look forward to an evening service just to go back over the word of the Lord again

Lord Jesus Christ available the ones that God is calling to you have it in your heart today that through these twists and turns I know sometimes maybe we as a church here and the members of Tucson tabernacle you look back at the last five years and there's a say just just when it seems like maybe feel like we're turning a corner there's just another trouble around the bin but just when we finally seems seem to just kind of maybe be working out just another struggle another trial whether it be an economy or whether it be politics or whether it be even the the pandemic and the unrest
