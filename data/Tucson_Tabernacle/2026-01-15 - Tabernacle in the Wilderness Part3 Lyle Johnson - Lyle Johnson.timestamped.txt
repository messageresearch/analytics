[0:24] of mind,

[7:07] Um
[7:10] the uh I want to give a testimony before
[7:12] we start before we uh we go to prayer.
[7:17] And uh I was having lunch with a good
[7:20] friend of mine, Gerald Hughes. He's a
[7:21] pastor in South Carolina.
[7:25] And uh we're at this bagel shop on
[7:27] Oracle Road.
[7:29] And um we were just talking back and
[7:32] forth and there was a a group of four
[7:37] ladies sitting next to us and uh it was
[7:40] obviously a mom and her three daughters,
[7:43] Hispanic family. They were talking in
[7:46] Spanish and I was talking to Brother
[7:49] Gerald and I just something was just
[7:53] pulling on me
[7:56] with these three ladies over here to the
[7:58] left. The mom was probably around my age
[8:01] and uh the daughters were I don't know
[8:04] anywhere from Daniel and Josiah's age on
[8:06] down to about I don't know 15 or so. And
[8:09] there was three daughters and then the
[8:11] mom
[8:13] speaking in Spanish and
[8:17] my ear caught the word Jesus
[8:23] and uh then I kind of got my attention
[8:27] and they were literally I mean they were
[8:29] just a few feet away and uh I could tell
[8:32] there there was a bit of a contentious
[8:34] conversation going on in Spanish
[8:38] And I just felt like the Lord told me
[8:42] just talk to them.
[8:45] So I uh I turned and I scooted over a
[8:48] little bit closer up to their table and
[8:51] I said, "Are are you all Christians?"
[8:55] And the one young lady, the oldest young
[8:58] lady says, "I am."
[9:00] And she says, "My mom, she's Catholic.
[9:02] She's not." And the mom says, "Yeah, no,
[9:05] I'm not." And and I could tell, I could
[9:08] feel it. That's what they were talking
[9:10] about.
[9:12] And then the young lady says, "I gave my
[9:14] heart to the Lord Jesus and now I'm a
[9:16] Christian and I'm not I'm not Catholic
[9:17] anymore."
[9:19] And I said, "Okay." And then I I see the
[9:21] mom there. And I I kind of felt for the
[9:24] mom. I could tell she was just kind of
[9:27] not going to say anything.
[9:29] And I said, 'Listen,
[9:31] I said, I want to ask all of you ladies
[9:34] here at this table.
[9:37] I said, the Bible teaches us, Jesus
[9:40] himself said that there will be one
[9:45] shepherd
[9:46] and one flock.
[9:50] I said, now I want all four of you, I
[9:53] said, who is the shepherd?
[9:57] And the young lady said, "Jesus." And I
[9:59] looked at the mom. I said, "Is that the
[10:02] shepherd? Is that your shepherd, too?"
[10:03] She says, "Oh, yes. Yes." I said, "So,
[10:06] if there's one shepherd," and I said,
[10:08] "All of us here can agree that we
[10:11] believe in this one shepherd of Jesus
[10:13] Christ." I said, "Aren't we in the same
[10:17] flock?"
[10:19] And the mom looked at me and I could
[10:23] just, you know, you can tell I could
[10:25] just feel a a burden start to lift off
[10:28] of this lady. And she started smiling
[10:31] and she said, "Yes." And I I looked at
[10:34] the daughter who had just given her
[10:36] heart to the Lord Jesus and been
[10:37] baptized. I said I said, "How about
[10:39] you?" I said I said, "Is your shepherd
[10:41] Jesus Christ?" And she said she said,
[10:44] "Yes." I said, "Are you from a different
[10:46] flock than your mom?" She says, "No."
[10:50] And that contentious
[10:52] conversation
[10:54] when Jesus
[10:56] was lifted up as the supreme
[11:02] in all things, that contentious argument
[11:06] stopped
[11:08] and it was replaced with smiles and and
[11:11] happiness and and they started talking
[11:13] to each other and they started laughing
[11:14] around the table and and they got up and
[11:18] uh I said, "By the way, I said, "I'm a
[11:20] pastor." And and my my friend here's a
[11:22] pastor. And they're like, "Oh, this this
[11:25] is just so good." And and then the mom,
[11:28] Catholic, she said, "Oh, we want to go
[11:30] to your church." [laughter] And I said,
[11:33] I said, "Okay." I said, I I said, "It's
[11:36] Tucson Tabernacle." I didn't have any
[11:37] cards with me. And and I I felt bad, but
[11:40] I um they started they started just
[11:43] fellowshipping and what was once
[11:46] contention
[11:48] &gt;&gt; was replaced by unity.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; And that is what happens friends when
[11:56] there is division.
[11:59] It is never about Jesus.
[12:01] It's always about something else.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Wow. But when you have one flock and one
[12:07] shepherd, then you have unity.
[12:11] One day there is going to be unity in
[12:14] the body of Christ.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ himself prayed for it. And
[12:19] I pray that we will one day see that
[12:22] because I believe when that happens is
[12:25] when the Lord Jesus will return for his
[12:28] united body. Let's all stand.
[12:34] I um I'm in almost daily contact with
[12:38] the Oha family and uh the um the the
[12:44] daughter um
[12:47] Sabrina, she uh it's it's up and down,
[12:51] but she's back on the ventilator. Um and
[12:55] uh I had a wonderful friends. Let me
[12:57] tell you something.
[12:59] We saw a miracle last week in that
[13:03] hospital room.
[13:05] We saw the doctors were there. We saw
[13:09] someone who had no brain function.
[13:13] We prayed and then the next day I was
[13:16] talking to her. They took the tube out
[13:19] and she was conversing and she was
[13:21] giving praise to the Lord Jesus for his
[13:24] salvation and his goodness.
[13:27] the young lady that that uh she needed
[13:30] it. And I believe that not only is that
[13:35] going to be the miracle, I believe that
[13:36] we are going to see a greater miracle
[13:39] happen in that family. The uh the
[13:41] 8-year-old boy, he um he's still um
[13:46] struggling. The uh the two younger ones,
[13:48] the 2-year-old and the three-year-old
[13:49] are um they're doing they're doing
[13:51] better. So, please remember them.
[13:54] continue to pray for them. Um, brother,
[13:57] I think, uh, sister Rachel and also my
[14:00] wife Stephanie talked with Amber Bowman
[14:03] um, today and uh, Stephanie's been in
[14:07] touch with Amber. She lost her son
[14:10] David. I mean, he's about I don't know,
[14:12] I think he was around 18, 19 years old
[14:15] to colon cancer. And um, she uh, she had
[14:20] a hard time and she's I mean, she's
[14:22] still having a hard time. It hasn't been
[14:23] that long. But um they want to uh they
[14:27] want to do something, you know, for
[14:29] David. So just pray with pray with us
[14:32] about that and pray for Amber. She's uh
[14:35] many of you know Amber from a long time
[14:37] ago here. She's um she's been to our
[14:40] family camps and um just she's friends
[14:43] with Stephanie and she's just I think
[14:45] very highly of her and her family. um

[14:50] and uh of course remember sister Esther
[14:53] Alcanter

[15:26] Sister Ununice, we would certainly pray
[15:28] for this family. Is anyone else? That's
[15:32] all the written requests I have, but if
[15:33] you have a request on your heart that
[15:35] you would like to be made known, I know
[15:38] that sometimes you have to do something
[15:40] and even if it's just raising your hand,
[15:43] God will see it. So if you have a
[15:45] request on your heart or something that
[15:46] you're praying about, you can lift up
[15:48] your hand and bring it before the Lord.
[15:50] Let's bow our heads.

[16:11] your way and may it work out, Lord, for
[16:14] the good and for a testimony.

[17:35] Josiah if he would would do [music] the
[17:37] song. He just can get he get the tempo
[17:39] much better than I do on that song.
[17:45] What gift of grace [singing]
[17:48] is Jesus my redeemer?
[17:53] There is no more [singing]
[17:56] for heaven now to give.
[18:00] He is my [singing] joy,
[18:03] my righteousness [music] and freom.
[18:08] My steadfast [singing] love,
[18:11] my [music] deep and boundless peace.
[18:16] To this I hold. [singing]
[18:19] My hope is [music] only Jesus. [singing]
[18:24] For my life
[18:26] is [music] wholly bound to his.
[18:32] Oh, how strange [singing] and [music]
[18:34] divine I can sing. All is mine yet not I
[18:41] but through Christ [singing]
[18:43] [music]
[18:44] in me.

[18:49] but I am not forsaken. [music]
[18:54] For by [singing] my side the Savior He
[18:59] [music] will stay.
[19:02] I labor [singing]
[19:03] on
[19:05] in weakness and rejoiceing. [music]
[19:09] For in my [singing] need [music] his
[19:13] power is displayed. [singing]
[19:17] To this I hold. My shepherd will
[19:21] [singing]
[19:21] [music] defend me.
[19:25] Through the deepest
[19:27] [music and singing] valley he will lead.
[19:32] Oh the night [singing] has been one and
[19:36] I shall overcome [music and singing] yet
[19:40] not I but through Christ
[19:44] in me. [singing]
[19:50] No fate I dread.
[19:53] I know I [singing] am forgi [music]
[19:58] the future sure [singing]
[20:01] the price it has been paid. Do you
[20:04] believe that? For Jesus [music]
[20:07] [singing] bled
[20:08] and suffered for my pardon
[20:13] and [music] he was raised to overthrow
[20:18] the grave.
[20:21] Do this I hold. My sin has [singing]
[20:25] been [music] defeated.
[20:28] Jesus [singing] now
[20:31] and ever is my [music] plea. [singing]
[20:36] Oh the chains are released. I can
[20:40] [music] sing. I am free yet not I but
[20:46] through [singing] Christ
[20:48] in [music] me. Sing this next verse as a
[20:50] declaration. With every [singing] breath
[20:54] I long to follow Jesus,
[20:59] for he has said that he will bring me
[21:04] [music and singing] home.
[21:06] And day by day [singing]
[21:09] [music] I know he will renew me
[21:14] until I stand [singing]
[21:17] with joy before the throne.
[21:21] To this [singing] I hold. My hope is
[21:25] only Jesus.
[21:29] All the glory [singing]
[21:32] ever more to him.
[21:37] When the race is complete, still my
[21:41] [singing and music] lips shall repeat.
[21:44] Yet not I, but [music] through [singing]
[21:47] Christ in me. To this I hold. To [music]
[21:52] this I hold. My hope is only [singing]
[21:56] Jesus.
[21:59] All the glory [singing]
[22:02] ever more to him.
[22:07] When the race is complete,
[22:10] [music and singing] still my lips shall
[22:13] repeat. Yet not I, but through Christ
[22:18] in me when the race
[22:22] when the race is complete, [music]
[22:25] still my lips shall repeat. [singing]
[22:29] Yet not I, but through Christ
[22:34] in me. [singing]
[22:37] Yet not I, but through Christ
[22:41] in me.
[22:45] Yet not I, but through Christ
[22:49] in me.
[22:54] Do
[22:54] &gt;&gt; you appreciate that God would do that
[22:56] for you?
[22:57] because we could never do it ourselves.
[23:00] [applause]
[23:02] &gt;&gt; We'll stand and prepare for brother
[23:05] Lyall this this evening. And
[23:08] I know the Lord is going to use him
[23:10] today because
[23:12] yesterday I reached out to him just
[23:16] late late afternoon early evening and I
[23:18] usually he has a song and he hadn't sent
[23:22] one out yet. So I reach out to him and
[23:23] he just said, "I'm struggling."
[23:26] And it and if you've ever ministered, it
[23:28] can [music] be that way. You know, you
[23:30] just sometimes you're pulled a hundred
[23:32] ways. Sometimes you feel no pull at all,
[23:35] but you trust in him.
[23:38] So when when you get into that
[23:40] situation, you start praying and seeking
[23:42] God and asking and he answers. So and if
[23:45] you'll draw, if you'll say, "Lord, speak
[23:47] to me," God will give you. So, and as I
[23:51] thought about that, I I said, even when
[23:53] things are hard, God is still good. God
[23:55] is so good. Amen.
[23:59] Oh, God
[24:01] is so good.
[24:06] God
[24:08] is so good.
[24:12] [music]
[24:14] God [singing] is so good.
[24:19] He's so good
[24:22] to
[24:24] [music] me.
[24:27] Oh, he [music] gave [singing]
[24:31] his life.
[24:35] He [singing] gave his life. [music]
[24:42] He
[24:44] gave [singing] his life.
[24:48] He's so good, [singing]
[24:51] too. He [music] rose again.
[24:56] And he [singing]
[24:58] rose again.
[25:02] [music]
[25:03] He
[25:05] rose [singing]
[25:06] again.
[25:10] [music] He [singing]
[25:12] rose again.
[25:15] And [music] he's [singing] so good,
[25:19] too. God is [music] so good.
[25:24] Oh, [singing] God
[25:26] [music] is so good.
[25:31] [music] God
[25:33] is so good.
[25:38] God [singing]
[25:39] [music] is so good. He's
[25:44] [singing] so good
[25:47] to [music]
[25:48] me.
[25:52] Amen. [music] It's true. It's so true.
[25:55] Thank you. Thank you so much.
[25:58] Let me uh get this part going.
[26:05] Thank you for joining us here tonight
[26:07] for part three of our exploration of the
[26:10] tabernacle in the wilderness.
[26:12] I must begin with a correction and an
[26:16] apology.
[26:18] Last time I indicated that Egypt did not
[26:21] have bronze or brass and stated that
[26:23] bronze was a combination of copper and
[26:25] zinc.
[26:27] Incorrect. Brass, not bronze, is an
[26:30] alloy of copper and zinc. Egypt did not
[26:33] have brass. Copper and tin are the
[26:36] normal composition of bronze. But copper
[26:39] alloyed with arsenic, sometimes called
[26:42] dirty copper, is another form of bronze.
[26:45] And Egypt did have that kind of bronze.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Yes. I'm sorry that I
[26:53] misstated these facts. And uh one other
[26:56] thing I like to say that uh in the third
[26:59] row there, I think the row that you were
[27:00] in, Sister Hope, uh there's envelopes.
[27:03] Don't touch them. A couple of envelopes
[27:05] here and a couple of envelopes in the
[27:06] back. I want you to not mess with the
[27:08] envelopes. But about a half hour from
[27:11] now, I'm going to need
[27:14] six volunteers to come and stand by
[27:18] those envelopes. So, prepare yourself,
[27:20] those of you that want to volunteer.
[27:24] Uh there'll be a minor reward if you uh
[27:28] choose to assist.
[27:31] So, moving on.
[27:34] The first time we met about the
[27:36] tabernacle in the wilderness, we
[27:37] observed the tabernacle in its courtyard
[27:40] from the perspective of a person
[27:41] approaching the tabernacle complex for
[27:43] the first time. This view is of a
[27:46] full-size tabernacle model located in
[27:48] the southern desert of Israel.
[27:52] What did he or she see? What questions
[27:55] formed in the mind of the observer? What
[27:58] answers might there be?
[28:01] What was symbolic
[28:03] about the things observed?
[28:06] Last time we entered the courtyard and
[28:08] saw the altar, the altar of sacrifice,
[28:12] the barefoot priests and their clothing.
[28:15] We concluded with the lav or basin where
[28:18] the priests washed as they performed
[28:20] their duties. This evening, we'll look
[28:23] at the tabernacle itself. But before we
[28:26] begin before we begin this evening's
[28:29] exploration, please join me once more in
[28:31] prayer.
[28:33] Lord Jesus, it's a great honor to be
[28:36] standing here, Lord, with your people.
[28:39] Lord, you are the shepherd and we are
[28:43] part of your flock. Lord, we just pray
[28:46] that you'd be with us tonight, Lord.
[28:48] that you guard my lips that I don't say
[28:51] any other misstatements any worse than
[28:54] brass and bronze and Lord that uh you
[28:57] just be with us tonight. We thank you.
[29:00] We we expect great things from you and
[29:02] we thank you for your presence in Jesus
[29:05] name. Amen.
[29:09] Recall that at the sacrificial altar
[29:13] there was to be a morning sacrifice of a
[29:15] lamb and an evening sacrifice. And just
[29:18] beyond the altar and the lavver, we see
[29:21] the dominant structure within the
[29:23] courtyard, a large tent or tabernacle.
[29:27] Let's read our topic verses for tonight
[29:29] before we're seated about how those tie
[29:32] together and their importance.
[29:35] Exodus chapter 29, the Lord speaking
[29:38] directly to Moses. Now this is that
[29:41] which thou shalt offer offer upon the
[29:44] altar. Two lambs of the first year day
[29:46] by day continually.
[29:49] The one lamb thou shalt offer in the
[29:51] morning and the other lamb thou shalt
[29:53] offer it even skipping down to verse 42.
[29:57] This shall be a continual burnt
[29:59] offering. That doesn't mean it's
[30:01] continuously burning, but offered every
[30:03] day throughout your generations at the
[30:06] door of the tabernacle of the
[30:07] congregation before the Lord, where I
[30:10] will meet you to speak there unto thee.
[30:14] This is the precise location where the
[30:17] Lord will speak to Moses. And not only
[30:20] Moses, but he goes on to say, "And there
[30:23] I, the Lord, will meet with the children
[30:26] of Israel, and the tabernacle
[30:29] shall be sanctified by the offerings."
[30:32] No, by the sacrifices, no, by my glory
[30:38] or splendor. Put another way, God will
[30:41] be present there. And it is sanctified
[30:43] by the fact of his presence.
[30:46] And I the Lord, not Moses, not Aaron,
[30:51] not the priests, but I will sanctify,
[30:54] consecrate, hallow, declare ceremonially
[30:58] clean the tabernacle of the congregation
[31:01] and the altar. I will sanctify also both
[31:04] Aaron and his sons to minister to the
[31:07] congregation. No, to minister to me in
[31:11] the priest's office. office here is not
[31:14] a location where you have a desk but a
[31:16] set of duties and responsibilities.
[31:19] Where will they minister to the Lord? In
[31:22] the tabernacle complex. And what is the
[31:25] overarching purpose of all this? And I
[31:29] will dwell, live, have my abode among
[31:33] the children of Israel, and will be
[31:35] their God.
[31:37] and they shall know that I am the Lord
[31:40] Yahweh their God that brought them forth
[31:43] out of the land of Egypt that I may
[31:45] dwell among them. God wants to be among
[31:48] his people just as he was with Adam in
[31:51] the garden. He says he performed all the
[31:54] miracles that defeated Egypt for one
[31:57] purpose that he might dwell among them.
[32:01] I am the Lord their God. We'll see as we
[32:05] delve into the tabernacle itself that
[32:07] this will become or be regarded as the
[32:10] dwelling place of Yahweh, the invisible
[32:12] God of Israel. Not a dwelling place, but
[32:15] the dwelling place. Please be seated.
[32:22] To see the tabernacle, we must first
[32:25] come into the courtyard through its only
[32:27] entrance,
[32:29] reminding us that the way to God is
[32:32] through the only entrance he has
[32:33] provided for us, and that is Jesus
[32:36] Christ. He told us he was the way, the
[32:39] truth, and the life. The only way. As we
[32:43] stare in awe at this tent erected in the
[32:46] wilderness, what do we see?
[32:53] We see five tall, slender golden pillars
[32:57] set in copper or bronze bases. A large
[33:01] colorful cloth forming a curtain which
[33:03] is the sole entrance to whatever might
[33:05] be hidden inside the structure that's
[33:07] covered by the tent.
[33:11] We see a gold tinted reflection of light
[33:14] along what appears to be a wall
[33:15] enclosing the structure that is under
[33:18] the tent covering.
[33:20] a multi-layer fabric and leather
[33:22] covering forming the tent itself.
[33:26] We notice a priest standing by the
[33:28] entrance. This is a large structure.
[33:33] Questions form in our mind. Just how big
[33:35] is this thing? What are its dimensions?
[33:38] What are the layers of fabric and animal
[33:40] skins that comprise the tent part
[33:42] itself? And what do they mean?
[33:45] The Bible gives us a lot of information
[33:48] about the tabernacle, usually from the
[33:50] inside out, but we're observing it from
[33:53] the outside, seeing it for the first
[33:55] time.
[33:57] Let's see what we can learn as we gaze
[33:58] upon it. The covering over the structure
[34:01] appears to have four layers. The
[34:03] innermost looks like it is woven with
[34:06] patterns that uh look like people with
[34:08] wings.
[34:11] The next layer appears to be made from
[34:13] some kind of wool or animal hair. Then
[34:16] some kind of red leather and the outer
[34:18] layer seems to be yet another kind of
[34:21] lay leather.
[34:23] So let's start from the outside and
[34:25] let's read about the layers of the tent
[34:27] covering in order from the innermost to
[34:29] the outer as the Lord told Moses. We'll
[34:32] skip through some of the description
[34:33] trying to just hit the highlights. You
[34:35] can read all the details of the
[34:37] tabernacle in the book of Exodus.
[34:40] Exodus chapter 26,
[34:43] God is giving instructions to Moses.
[34:45] Moreover, thou shalt make the tabernacle
[34:47] with 10 curtains of fine twined linen
[34:51] and blue and purple and scarlet with
[34:54] cherubim of cunning work shalt thou make
[34:57] them. Each curtain has woven into the
[35:00] fabric an image of or representing
[35:03] cherubim. This is a transliterated word
[35:06] sounding in English similar to the sound
[35:08] of the word in Hebrew. A cherub is a
[35:10] winged being, a kind of angel. It has
[35:14] two wings.
[35:16] The length of one curtain shall be 42
[35:19] feet.
[35:21] And the breadth of the curtain six feet.
[35:24] Every one of the curtains shall have one
[35:26] measure. All all 10 of them are the same
[35:28] size and shape.
[35:30] So here here you see what one might have
[35:32] looked like. We don't know what the
[35:34] actual pattern was. The cherub in the
[35:36] inset is standing up with his wings
[35:38] raised like this to help you see the
[35:41] pattern of four of them and that
[35:42] horizontal stripe at the top.
[35:46] The five curtains shall be coupled
[35:48] together one to another sewn together,
[35:50] thus forming a large panel measuring 42
[35:53] feet by 30 feet. Thou shalt make loops
[35:57] of blue upon the edge. 50 loops thou
[36:00] shalt make in each curtain of five
[36:02] panels, that the loops may take hold of
[36:04] one another. The edges with the loops
[36:06] will be adjacent to each other.
[36:10] So, here we see five of the small
[36:12] curtains stitched together to make a
[36:13] large panel or curtain. I've outlined
[36:16] one of the small curtains in yellow to
[36:18] help you see the repetition of its
[36:20] pattern in the other four. There are two
[36:23] such panels of five. There are loops
[36:26] sewn into one edge of the combined
[36:27] curtain to allow for the two to be
[36:29] joined. This method allows the linen
[36:31] curtain to be broken down for transport.
[36:34] The tabernacle will be set up, broken
[36:37] down, and transported many times.
[36:41] And thou shalt make 50 taches, it means
[36:43] clasps or fasteners of gold, and couple
[36:46] the two curtains together with the
[36:48] clasps. And it shall be one tabernacle,
[36:51] one tent, a single covering when coupled
[36:54] together.
[36:55] The fittings are of gold that are
[36:57] closest to the interior of the
[36:58] structure.
[37:00] So, here we see the general plan of that
[37:03] linen covering. And Martha did bring her
[37:05] binoculars so she can she can read that
[37:08] even though she's in the back row. These
[37:11] are attached to form a single covering
[37:13] that's 42 feet by 60 feet.
[37:18] Each panel is naturally of white linen
[37:21] with blue, purple, and red woven threads
[37:24] resulting in a pattern of cherabs. If
[37:26] one is standing inside the tabernacle
[37:28] structure looking up, this pattern would
[37:30] be visible as the ceiling.
[37:33] The cherubs, these angels, remind us
[37:36] that though they're not visible, we are
[37:38] surrounded by a heavenly host and that
[37:42] the Lord is surrounded by and dwells in
[37:45] the midst of heavenly beings who
[37:47] reminded of Isaiah seeing the Lord with
[37:51] all of the saraphim there. The
[37:54] illustration shows a bold dashed gold
[37:57] line down the center.
[38:01] Trust me, it's there. indicating where
[38:03] the two halves are joined by the 50
[38:05] clasps of gold. The colors in the linen
[38:08] we've examined before. Blue often
[38:10] signified the heavens and by extension
[38:12] the divine presence. Scarlet or bright
[38:15] red represented the blood of sacrifice,
[38:17] the penalty for sin and on a spiritual
[38:20] level a cleansing agent. Purple dye was
[38:23] rare and expensive. Purple res
[38:26] represented royalty and wealth. If you
[38:28] think about it, purple is a combination
[38:30] of red and blue.
[38:34] White represents righteousness.
[38:37] What does gold symbolize?
[38:39] Gold is a symbol of divine power,
[38:42] presence, favor. It also represents
[38:45] purity and holiness. It's costly,
[38:49] signifying wealth, and blessings. Gold
[38:52] is durable and longasting.
[38:55] Moving
[38:57] on. Thou shalt make curtains of goats
[39:00] hair to be a covering upon the
[39:01] tabernacle. In other words, to cover
[39:03] over that patterned linen fabric. The
[39:06] hair is spun into yarn woven into a
[39:08] heavy cloth. 11 curtains shalt thou
[39:10] make. There were 10 linen. There's 11
[39:13] goats hair. And thou shalt couple five
[39:16] curtains by themselves, and six curtains
[39:18] by themselves. So, you're going to make
[39:19] two panels. One of five of these
[39:22] curtains and one of six.
[39:26] And just like the linen, thou shalt make
[39:27] 50 loops on the edge of each panel. And
[39:31] make 50 clasps of gold. No, no, of
[39:35] copper or brass, and put the clasps into
[39:38] the loops and couple the tent together
[39:39] that it may be one. So unlike the linen
[39:42] tent, the clasps here are made with
[39:45] copper. They're indicating uh judgment
[39:49] rather than uh holiness. These are not
[39:52] visible from the inside of the
[39:54] tabernacle's structure.
[39:56] So this gives a general plan of the
[39:58] cover of goat's hair. The panel on the
[40:01] left side will later be folded on
[40:02] itself, which will shorten the length
[40:04] from 66 to 63 feet.
[40:08] The clasps joining this layer again are
[40:11] copper, translated in King James's
[40:14] brass. Again, it's a metal that
[40:16] symbolizes judgment. In many
[40:18] commentaries, you'll find a statement
[40:20] that the goat's hair was white.
[40:23] Anybody seen a white goat? Yeah, there's
[40:26] lots of white goats. This is then tied
[40:29] to an observation about sanctification.
[40:33] However, most sources that I have found
[40:36] indicate that white-haired goats were
[40:37] not in this area of the world at the
[40:40] time the tabernacle was constructed.
[40:42] goats were dark brown or black. This
[40:45] makes sense in light of Solomon's song
[40:48] about his bride. Song of Solomon chapter
[40:51] 4, we read, "Behold, thou art fair, my
[40:54] love. Behold, thou art fair. Thou hast
[40:58] dove's eyes within thy locks. Thy hair
[41:01] is as a flock of goats that appear for
[41:04] Mount Gilead."
[41:06] Middle Eastern people have dark hair in
[41:08] general, sometimes red like we think
[41:11] Joseph, but not blonde and certainly not
[41:14] white, unless they're very old, of
[41:17] course. I doubt Solomon wrote his song
[41:21] about an old woman.
[41:23] So, this is the goat's hair curtain. It
[41:25] will cover the linen curtain with about
[41:27] an 18inch border all the way around.
[41:29] It's It's larger. Notice the position of
[41:31] the copper clasps I've extended and
[41:33] below the drawing to make it clear.
[41:37] This illustration shows how the goat's
[41:39] hair cover is larger on each side than
[41:41] the linen. It thus protects the linen
[41:43] cover completely. You'll notice a place
[41:46] where the two pieces of each cover are
[41:48] joined by the clasps are slightly
[41:49] offset. The copper clasp line is just
[41:52] visible. I've extended it to make it
[41:54] easier to find. The line of gold clasps
[41:56] is plain down the center of the linen
[41:58] curtain. This ensures that the gaps in
[42:01] the joining are not in the same place,
[42:04] protecting the tabernacle interior from
[42:07] dust and rain.
[42:10] What's next?
[42:12] One verse. Thou shalt make a covering
[42:15] for the tent of ram's skins dyed red and
[42:18] a covering above of badgers skins.
[42:23] So the outermost cover is made of
[42:26] leather. This badger skins thing is from
[42:29] an animal that in Hebrew was called a
[42:32] tahash.
[42:34] It's translated as badger skins, but
[42:36] there weren't badgers in that part of
[42:39] the world. It's sometimes called seal
[42:41] skin, but it's hard to imagine many
[42:44] seals in the desert or even in the Red
[42:47] Sea. Dolphins live there, not seals.
[42:50] Some translations say dolphin skin.
[42:52] Others say fine leather, leather from
[42:55] goats. Strong's concordance speculates
[42:57] it may have been a species of analopee.
[43:00] In other words, no one is certain what
[43:03] animal is meant by the word takish,
[43:05] translated as badger in the King James.
[43:10] The two outer covers of the tabernacle
[43:12] structure are of leather. No dimensions
[43:14] are given. It's generally thought they
[43:16] were at least as large as the goat's
[43:17] hair cover, perhaps a bit larger.
[43:20] This view shows three possibilities. The
[43:23] the upper left shows the badger skin
[43:26] leather. Here the leather covers which
[43:28] are flared out from the tabernacle are
[43:30] about the same size as the goat's hair
[43:32] cover which hangs down on the sides.
[43:35] The image at the upper right
[43:38] shows the red and white outer cover the
[43:40] same size as the goats and shows the
[43:42] goat's hairs being white. All three
[43:44] layers are flared out from the side of
[43:46] the structure and staked down. The
[43:48] bottom panel shows another concept with
[43:51] the red leather large and hanging down
[43:53] while only the top cover is staked and
[43:55] flared and it's not as large.
[43:59] There are some, however, who contend
[44:00] that the leather covers were smaller.
[44:03] They were a covering above. This image
[44:06] shows a tabernacle model with goat's
[44:08] hair cover in dark brown. The red and
[44:10] tackish leather just covering the very
[44:12] top surface of the tabernacle.
[44:19] The ram skin reminds us that the ram was
[44:23] a sacrificial animal and the red color
[44:25] reminds us that blood sacrifices were
[44:28] required.
[44:30] These then are the the four layers of
[44:31] the covering of the tabernacle. Linen
[44:33] the innermost goat's hair red leather
[44:36] and finally leather from a takish a
[44:39] known to us animal. The innermost linen
[44:42] has gold clasps reflecting the divine.
[44:44] And the second layer's clasps are of
[44:47] bronze or copper signifying judgment.
[44:50] The outer layers are leather
[44:51] representing sacrifice and redemption by
[44:53] blood.
[44:55] But what's being covered by these
[44:58] covers?
[45:00] What's being protected by these four
[45:03] layers? Let's look now at the structure
[45:06] itself which is to be covered by these
[45:09] four coverings.
[45:12] I know all of this can seem a bit
[45:13] tedious,
[45:16] but as Paul wrote to Timothy,
[45:21] all scripture, which the ones we like,
[45:26] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[45:29] God. Other translations say God breathed
[45:32] and is when only for the past, only for
[45:37] the future. No, for the present. All
[45:39] scripture is profitable for doctrine,
[45:42] for reproof, for correction, for
[45:46] instruction in righteousness.
[45:48] To what end purpose? That the man of God
[45:51] may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
[45:54] unto all good works.
[45:56] That includes the portions we're
[45:58] studying from Exodus about the
[45:59] tabernacle in the wilderness. Bear with
[46:02] me. I think there are lessons for us to
[46:04] apply daily in our lives as Christians.
[46:09] Back to our question. What are the
[46:11] curtains and skins covering?
[46:15] Exodus tells us, "Thou shalt make boards
[46:17] for the tabernacle of Shatimwood
[46:19] standing up." Shhatim is again a
[46:22] transliteration of a Hebrew word. Most
[46:24] translators suggest that this is acacia.
[46:28] 10 cubits shall be the length of a board
[46:30] and a cubit and a half the breadth. In
[46:32] other words, the board's going to be 15
[46:33] feet long and a little over two feet
[46:36] wide.
[46:38] There'll be two tenins, short legs or
[46:41] feet shall there be in each board. Thus
[46:43] shalt thou make for all the boards of
[46:46] the tabernacle.
[46:49] We're in the desert.
[46:52] This is an image of an acacia growing in
[46:54] the desert of Saudi Arabia. It's mature,
[46:57] but not huge. Sort of like a mosquite
[47:00] that we have around here or perhaps a
[47:02] rather large palivvery.
[47:05] How can one cut a board 15 feet long and
[47:09] more than two feet wide from this kind
[47:12] of a tree?
[47:15] I can't do it. And these guys didn't
[47:17] have the tools that we have today.
[47:20] There's a widely agreed answer that the
[47:22] acacia was used to make frames. The
[47:25] completed frame forming a board. In the
[47:28] end, we don't know, but this is possible
[47:30] and certainly plausible
[47:32] explanation. You can see a frame, couple
[47:35] of tenins, little feet at the bottom
[47:36] going into sockets, the silver block at
[47:39] the bottom.
[47:40] It certainly ties in with the concept
[47:43] described by Paul in Ephesians chapter
[47:46] 2.
[47:48] Now therefore, ye are no more strangers
[47:51] and foreigners, but fellow citizens with
[47:53] the saints, and of the household of God,
[47:57] one flock,
[47:59] and are built upon the foundation of the
[48:02] apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[48:04] himself being the chief cornerstone,
[48:08] and now to us,
[48:10] in whom all the building fitly what
[48:14] framed together groweth unto a what?
[48:18] Holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye also
[48:22] are builded together for what? An
[48:26] habitation of God through the spirit.
[48:30] The New Testament tabernacle, if you
[48:32] will, God's dwelling place changes from
[48:34] being among the people to being within
[48:38] the people.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; We become the tabernacle.
[48:44] back to Exodus in the wilderness
[48:46] tabernacle.
[48:50] Thou shalt make the boards for the
[48:52] tabernacle. 20 boards on the south side,
[48:54] southward, the south side of it. 20
[48:57] boards uh is 20 is thought to represent
[49:01] redemption. Thou shalt make 40 sockets
[49:03] of silver under the 20 boards. Two
[49:05] sockets under one board for his two
[49:07] tenins and two sockets under another
[49:09] board for his two. So 40 representing
[49:12] judgment. no longer bronze or copper,
[49:14] but now a foundation of silver,
[49:17] separating the boards of the tabernacle
[49:19] wall from the earth. Silver, as we
[49:23] discussed in part one, is a symbol
[49:24] especially of redemption, purity, and
[49:27] value.
[49:29] And just as we read in Ephesians, Christ
[49:31] our redeemer as chief cornerstone in
[49:34] Paul's metaphor is represented here as
[49:36] the foundation bridging between the
[49:39] earth and the divine.
[49:42] Skipping to verse 22.
[49:50] It didn't hear me. Okay. And for the
[49:53] sides of the tabernacle westward, thou
[49:55] shalt make six boards, so a width of
[49:56] nine cubits, or about 13 1/2 ft. And two
[50:00] boards shalt thou make for the corners
[50:02] of the tabernacle in the two sides. And
[50:04] they shall be coupled together beneath,
[50:06] and they shall be coupled together above
[50:07] the head of it into one ring.
[50:11] Huh?
[50:12] Got that?
[50:14] Yeah. Me neither. As in life, turning a
[50:18] corner can be complicated.
[50:22] Here we see a couple of possibilities.
[50:24] On the left, the corner board's inside
[50:25] the tabernacle, taking up some interior
[50:28] space. On the right, the corner board is
[50:30] on the outside. Again, we don't know.
[50:34] I've had people describe them as
[50:36] cylinders.
[50:39] But as with the tabernacle, we need to
[50:42] let the master builder put us in the
[50:45] right place. He knows oftenimes we're
[50:49] just guessing. He's the master builder.
[50:52] We're bricks and parts. Skipping to
[50:56] verse 26.
[50:58] Thou shalt make bars of chhatimwood,
[51:01] five for the boards of each side of the
[51:04] tabernacle. And the middle bar in the
[51:06] midst of the board shall reach from end
[51:08] to end.
[51:10] These bars tie together the boards that
[51:12] comprise the walls. Five represents
[51:15] grace. And it's only by his grace that
[51:18] we can stand and stand together.
[51:22] Like the middle bar, his grace in our
[51:24] midst extends all the way to the end.
[51:28] If the boards are really frames made of
[51:30] acacia wood, how are the frames panled?
[51:35] Thou shalt overlay the boards with gold
[51:37] and make their rings of gold for places
[51:39] for the bars and thou shalt overlay the
[51:41] bars with gold. This combination of
[51:44] acacia wood representing humanity
[51:47] overlaid with gold representing divinity
[51:51] illustrates the inseparable nature of
[51:54] Christ's humanity and divinity. Fully
[51:58] God, fully man. Any questions about any
[52:01] details? What a cherub looks like, how
[52:03] the acacia boards are made, or the
[52:05] corners.
[52:09] No,
[52:11] there's a lot of things we don't know.
[52:13] Thou shalt rear up the tabernacle
[52:15] according to the fashion thereof, which
[52:17] was showed thee in the mount. We don't
[52:19] know the details, but he does.
[52:23] Here
[52:25] we see the gold covered boards or frames
[52:27] sitting in the silver sockets forming
[52:29] three walls. It's hard to see. It's
[52:32] really hard to see, but the upper and
[52:34] lower crossarss only extend halfway.
[52:37] I've circled the gaps. There are total
[52:39] of five crossarss forming three rows.
[52:42] Again, we see grace and we see
[52:44] perfection.
[52:47] The entire cross the center crossbar
[52:49] extends the entire length of the wall.
[52:51] So, we have a north wall and a south
[52:52] wall, each 45 ft long. The west wall is
[52:55] nine cubits, 13 and 1/2 ft on the inside
[52:57] with these corners. But what about the
[52:59] east end, the entrance to the tabernacle
[53:02] itself?
[53:05] Thou shalt make a hanging for the door
[53:07] of the tent of blue and purple and
[53:08] scarlet and fine twined linen wrapped
[53:11] with needle work. This is similar to the
[53:14] hanging over the entrance to the
[53:15] courtyard.
[53:17] Same colors, same description. Thou
[53:19] shalt make for the hanging five pillars
[53:21] of chhatimwood and overlay them with
[53:23] gold and their hooks shall be of gold
[53:25] and thou shalt cast five sockets of
[53:27] brass for them. So again we have copper
[53:32] bases for the end of the tabernacle
[53:34] facing the outer court and the
[53:36] sacrificial altar. Everything facing the
[53:39] outer court has bases of copper called
[53:42] brass in in the King James.
[53:46] This includes the basis for the support
[53:48] of the linen outer wall, the entry
[53:50] pillars of the tabernacle structure, the
[53:53] sacrificial altar and basin where the
[53:55] priest's wash are also copper. All of
[53:57] the tools used in the outer court are of
[54:00] the same metal. The tops of the wooden
[54:03] post in the outer court are capped in
[54:04] silver and the bases of the gold covered
[54:06] boards of the tabernacle structure are
[54:09] also of silver. Everything above those
[54:11] bases is made of are covered with gold
[54:13] inside the tabernacle structure.
[54:16] The linen covering which forms the
[54:18] ceiling of the tabernacle uses gold
[54:20] clasps. So every metallic thing visible
[54:22] within the metal within the tabernacle
[54:24] structure is or is covered in gold. The
[54:28] exceptions are the bases for the walls
[54:30] which are silver. The bases for the five
[54:33] pillars supporting the entry curtain
[54:35] which are copper or bronze are hidden
[54:37] from the inside by the curtain itself.
[54:40] There's one more part of the structure.
[54:43] It's not visible from the courtyard, but
[54:45] since we're describing the structure,
[54:46] we'll include it. The interior is
[54:49] divided into two spaces.
[54:52] Thou shalt make a veil of blue and
[54:54] purple and scarlet and fine twined linen
[54:56] of cunning work. With cherubim it shall
[54:59] be made. So like the linen cover, this
[55:03] theme of the weaving will be of cherubs.
[55:05] The four colors are the same for all the
[55:07] curtains. the outer door, the tabernacle
[55:09] proper, and this interior veil, but only
[55:12] the inner veil has cherubs. Thou shalt
[55:15] hang it upon four pillars of chhatim
[55:18] wood overlaid with gold. Their hooks
[55:19] shall be of gold upon the four sockets
[55:22] of silver.
[55:25] So that we had five gold colored wooden
[55:28] gold covered wooden pillars on copper
[55:31] bases hanging the outer curtain. The
[55:33] external doorway but this inner one is
[55:35] from four gold covered wooden pillars
[55:37] set on silver bases.
[55:45] Thou shalt hang up the veil under the
[55:48] clasps that thou mayest bring in thither
[55:50] within the veil of the ark of the
[55:52] testimony. We'll talk about the ark next
[55:54] time. And the veil shall divide unto you
[55:57] between the holy place and the most
[55:59] holy. This curtain is often called the
[56:03] inner veil. The dimensions of these
[56:05] curtains aren't given. We assume they
[56:07] fill the doorway they're protecting with
[56:08] sufficient slack to hang without being
[56:10] stretched to the sides.
[56:14] I need six volunteers.
[56:21] I'm I'm seeing some some adults raising
[56:24] their hands. I'd like to see some kids.
[56:25] Liam, I see you. Liam, if you come up up
[56:28] here, buddy, just for a couple minutes.
[56:30] It's only This is going to be really
[56:31] easy thing. Okay. And just stand right
[56:33] by this envelope.
[56:35] Okay. Asher,
[56:38] I need you to stand by this envelope.
[56:43] Okay. I see I see I see lots of hands
[56:47] out here. Suddenly, I've got lots of
[56:48] volunteers.
[56:51] Oh, here's an envelope.
[56:56] Okay.
[57:01] Okay, we're getting close. Okay, Chloe.
[57:05] Okay. Oh, here's another one. Oh, and
[57:07] it's on on purple. Wow, it's royal.
[57:09] Okay, I need you to stand by that
[57:11] envelope for just a minute. Okay, I've
[57:14] got two more.
[57:17] Where did they go?
[57:20] Well, here's one on the floor right
[57:21] here. Oh, okay. Yeah, I had a volunteer
[57:24] arranged before service. Yes, you can
[57:26] come. Okay,
[57:31] I need you to come over here.
[57:34] I just found another envelope.
[57:38] Okay, I want you to stand. No, come in
[57:40] here. Come in here.
[57:43] I want you to stand by this envelope.
[57:45] Okay, everybody can see our six
[57:47] volunteers.
[57:49] Okay, I want each volunteer to please
[57:52] pick up your envelope and hold it up.
[57:56] Hold it up. Keep holding it up. Stand
[57:59] where the envelope is. Yeah. Stand where
[58:01] the and hold it up. Okay. Now, this is
[58:04] the size of the tabernacle.
[58:08] What direction is this? [snorts]
[58:11] East. The door was on the east. So, you
[58:15] came from the altar and you come through
[58:17] a curtain. It's right here.
[58:20] Okay. There's some stuff in here. And
[58:23] eventually there's this second curtain
[58:25] that we saw.
[58:27] This this inner veil is right here. And
[58:32] and and yeah, you're still doing it.
[58:35] Keep it up. Keep it up. Okay. And then
[58:37] this is the back wall. These are the
[58:39] corners that we couldn't figure out.
[58:41] Okay.
[58:42] Everybody got that? size of this thing.
[58:44] Okay. Now, all you volunteers, you can
[58:46] bring the envelope down. You can come
[58:48] down off of here. I see something fell
[58:49] out of your envelope. You might want to
[58:51] pick that up. Okay. Each envelope has a
[58:54] little weighty thing inside. That's a $1
[58:57] coin. That's That's payment for your
[59:00] service. Thank you very much. Volunteers
[59:03] can please be seated. [applause]
[59:16] So, this drawing shows the uncovered
[59:19] tabernacle structure from the top,
[59:23] the corners of it and so forth and
[59:24] curtains. That's where the kids were
[59:25] just standing. The curtains or veils are
[59:27] shown as squiggly lines. I was going to
[59:30] have them squiggle, but I decided they'd
[59:32] probably be too embarrassed to do that,
[59:33] so we didn't do that. The pillars are
[59:36] filled with a gold color to make them
[59:37] easy to locate. The dimensions are in
[59:40] cubits and are approximate. The length
[59:43] of the tabernacle is 30 cubits, 45 ft as
[59:46] you saw here.
[59:48] But is that the inside of the outside
[59:50] dimension?
[59:52] I know my background is an engineer.
[59:54] Yeah.
[59:56] You'll notice that the first space is
[59:58] shown as 20 cubits and the second space
[1:00:00] or most holy as 10. I continually find
[1:00:04] assertions of these dimensions,
[1:00:07] the placement of the veil that separates
[1:00:09] the spaces, but it's not specified in
[1:00:12] Exodus or anywhere else in the Bible
[1:00:13] that I could find.
[1:00:16] There's extrapolations and
[1:00:18] interpretations that people toss around
[1:00:20] to to come up with that location, but
[1:00:23] we're not going to go into that.
[1:00:28] What was inside the tabernacle?
[1:00:32] Only a priest could enter the tabernacle
[1:00:34] itself.
[1:00:38] As we discussed last time, the priest
[1:00:40] wore a white linen robe tied with a
[1:00:42] multicolored sash and wore a simple
[1:00:45] white linen cap.
[1:00:48] Because the ground inside the tabernacle
[1:00:50] is considered holy, there's no floor in
[1:00:52] the tabernacle, no wood, not stone, not
[1:00:56] carpet, just the raw desert.
[1:01:00] Just as Moses was commanded to take off
[1:01:03] his sandals when he approached the bush
[1:01:05] that burned but was not consumed,
[1:01:08] so the priests are all barefoot. Even
[1:01:11] the high priest is barefoot. They would
[1:01:14] wash their feet at the lav before
[1:01:16] entering the tabernacle.
[1:01:18] Well, let's be a let's be a priest now
[1:01:21] and enter that first big space within
[1:01:23] the tabernacle,
[1:01:25] the holy place. What do we see?
[1:01:28] Well, we step inside and close the
[1:01:31] curtain behind us. Having just come in
[1:01:32] from the bright desert sunshine, we can
[1:01:34] barely see, but [snorts]
[1:01:37] we can smell. We detect an aroma.
[1:01:41] There's a special incense being heated
[1:01:43] to produce this aroma.
[1:01:47] As our eyes begin to adjust to the
[1:01:49] gloom, we then see seven flames
[1:01:51] flickering. Our eyes get better adjusted
[1:01:54] and we see the flames are coming from
[1:01:56] ornate golden lamp with six branches.
[1:02:00] The light is reflected from the golden
[1:02:02] walls providing some illumination of the
[1:02:04] space.
[1:02:06] Opposite the lamp is a table also of
[1:02:09] gold with what looks like a dozen loaves
[1:02:11] of a flat bread, not unleavened, not
[1:02:14] particularly thick.
[1:02:16] As our vision improves, we see the small
[1:02:18] altar burning that is heating the
[1:02:22] incense. It's a very pleasant aroma. The
[1:02:25] altar, like everything else in this
[1:02:27] space, is made of or covered in gold.
[1:02:32] Our eyes are now fully adjusted. Just
[1:02:34] beyond the altar, we see the four golden
[1:02:37] pillars on silver bases supporting a
[1:02:39] cleverly woven multicolored curtain with
[1:02:43] cherabs in the pattern. This is the
[1:02:44] inner veil behind which is the most holy
[1:02:48] place.
[1:02:50] We see the size of the room we just
[1:02:52] experienced here and our feet have
[1:02:54] already told us.
[1:02:57] The floor is bare.
[1:02:59] Let's now review what the Lord told
[1:03:01] Moses about these items, what they
[1:03:03] represent. We'll start with the first
[1:03:04] item we saw, the golden lamp.
[1:03:10] And thou shalt make a candlestick
[1:03:12] of pure gold, of beaten work shall the
[1:03:15] candlestick be made. His shaft, his
[1:03:17] branches, his bowls, his kns, his
[1:03:19] flowers shall all be the same. The six
[1:03:22] branches shall come out the sides of it.
[1:03:24] Three branches of the candlestick out of
[1:03:26] each side. And the various features are
[1:03:28] now described. We skip down to verse 37.
[1:03:32] Thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof,
[1:03:34] and they shall light the lamps thereof,
[1:03:35] that they may give light over against
[1:03:37] it. And the tongs thereof, and the snuff
[1:03:40] dishes thereof shall be of pure gold. Of
[1:03:44] a talent of pure gold shall he make it
[1:03:46] with all these vessels.
[1:03:51] Sorry, I didn't advance that when I
[1:03:53] should have.
[1:03:56] and look that thou make them after their
[1:03:58] pattern which was showed thee in the
[1:04:01] mount. Again, all the details are not in
[1:04:05] the text. Here we see the manora as we
[1:04:09] often refer to the candlestick with the
[1:04:11] accessories to fill and maintain it.
[1:04:15] There are many things we could say are
[1:04:16] represented by the manora. One that
[1:04:19] comes to mind is found in revelation
[1:04:22] chapter 1.
[1:04:24] Verse
[1:04:26] nine. I, John, who also am your brother
[1:04:28] and companion in tribulation and in the
[1:04:30] kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ,
[1:04:33] was in the aisle that is called Patmas
[1:04:34] for the word of God and for the
[1:04:36] testimony of Jesus Christ. Patmas is a
[1:04:39] small Greek island in the Aian Sea. It's
[1:04:42] about 30 miles off the western coast of
[1:04:44] modern day Turkey.
[1:04:46] That part of Turkey is where the church
[1:04:48] at Ephesus was located, as well as other
[1:04:51] places familiar to us from our study of
[1:04:53] the book of Acts a couple of years ago.
[1:04:57] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[1:04:59] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[1:05:01] a trumpet.
[1:05:03] My turn to see the voice that spake with
[1:05:05] me. And being turned, I saw seven golden
[1:05:09] candlesticks,
[1:05:10] manora.
[1:05:12] And in the midst of the seven
[1:05:13] candlesticks, one like unto the Son of
[1:05:15] Man. John then goes on to describe the
[1:05:18] one speaking, skipping to verse 16. He
[1:05:21] had in his right hand seven stars.
[1:05:24] The voice of the Lord tells John,
[1:05:26] skipping to verse 20, the mystery of the
[1:05:29] seven stars which thou saw in my right
[1:05:31] hand, and the seven golden candlesticks.
[1:05:34] The seven stars are the angels of the
[1:05:36] seven churches. And the seven
[1:05:39] candlesticks which thou sawst are the
[1:05:41] seven churches.
[1:05:44] If you're familiar with brother
[1:05:45] Brandham's teachings about these
[1:05:47] churches, they represent the time from
[1:05:49] that of Paul until the end and that each
[1:05:52] church represented a time period or age.
[1:05:55] Brother Brandham placed us in the last
[1:05:57] of these seven ages, that of Leodysia.
[1:06:03] If the worship team would please return,
[1:06:07] we don't have time this evening to
[1:06:09] examine the table or the incense altar
[1:06:12] or go through the inner veil to the most
[1:06:14] holy and see what is there. We'll try to
[1:06:17] cover those next time.
[1:06:20] But thinking about the manora in the
[1:06:22] holy place of the wilderness tabernacle,
[1:06:25] we can imagine ourselves, our times
[1:06:28] represented by it. And what about our
[1:06:31] actions?
[1:06:33] our lives. Jesus told us.
[1:06:38] Then spake Jesus again unto them,
[1:06:40] saying, this is from John 8:12.
[1:06:43] I am the light of the world. He that
[1:06:46] followeth me, Jesus followers, his
[1:06:50] disciples,
[1:06:52] that includes us, at least it it does if
[1:06:55] we're not just believing or accepting,
[1:06:57] but following. shall not walk in
[1:07:00] darkness but shall have the light of
[1:07:03] life.
[1:07:06] He speaks to his followers among the
[1:07:07] crowd in the sermon on the mount. I
[1:07:10] think you're familiar with the sermon on
[1:07:11] the mount using a candlestick as a
[1:07:14] metaphor. Again, think of the monora.
[1:07:16] Matthew 5:14 Jesus says, "Ye are the
[1:07:20] light of the world. A city set on a hill
[1:07:23] cannot be hid. Neither do men light a
[1:07:26] candle, and put it under a bushel, but
[1:07:28] on a candlestick, and it giveth light
[1:07:31] unto all that are in the house. Let your
[1:07:34] light so shine before men, that they may
[1:07:37] see your good works, and glorify your
[1:07:41] father, which is in heaven.
[1:07:45] His commandments to us are still just as
[1:07:47] true and valid as they were when he
[1:07:49] spoke them. In this age of gray and
[1:07:53] uncertainty,
[1:07:54] we need to let our lights shine or let
[1:07:58] his light shine through us.
[1:08:01] As we close this portion of the service,
[1:08:04] let's stand and worship together with a
[1:08:06] song about light. It's called Send the
[1:08:10] Light. It was written in 1890 by Charles
[1:08:14] Gabriel, a pr prolific writer of gospel
[1:08:17] songs.
[1:08:22] There's a call come ringing over the
[1:08:25] [singing] restless [music]
[1:08:26] way. Send the light.
[1:08:30] Send the light.
[1:08:33] There are souls to rescue. There are
[1:08:36] [music and singing] souls to save. Send
[1:08:39] the light.
[1:08:41] Send the light.
[1:08:44] Send the [music and singing] light.
[1:08:47] The blessed goel light. Let it shine
[1:08:51] [singing]
[1:08:52] from shore to shore.
[1:08:55] [music] Send the light, [singing]
[1:08:58] the blessed goel light. Let it shine
[1:09:03] forever more.
[1:09:06] We have heard the Macedonian
[1:09:09] [singing and music]
[1:09:10] call today. Send the light.
[1:09:15] Send [music] the light
[1:09:18] and a golden offering at
[1:09:21] [music and singing] the cross we lay.
[1:09:23] Send the light.
[1:09:26] Send the light.
[1:09:29] Send the [music] light. [singing]
[1:09:31] The blessed goel light. Let it shine
[1:09:36] from [music] shore [singing] to shore.
[1:09:40] Send the light,
[1:09:42] [music] the blessed goel light. Let it
[1:09:46] shine
[1:09:47] forever [music]
[1:09:48] more.
[1:09:50] Let us pray that grace may everywhere
[1:09:54] [music and singing]
[1:09:55] abound. Send the light.
[1:09:58] Send the light.
[1:10:01] [music] And the Christlike spirit
[1:10:04] everywhere be [singing] found. Send the
[1:10:07] light. [music]
[1:10:09] Send the light.
[1:10:12] Send the light. [singing]
[1:10:14] The [music] blessed go
[1:10:18] and shine
[1:10:20] from shore to shore. [music]
[1:10:23] Send the light,
[1:10:25] the blessed goel light. Let it shine
[1:10:31] forever [music]
[1:10:32] more.
[1:10:34] Let us not grow. Weary in the word of
[1:10:39] love. Send the light.
[1:10:42] Send the light. [music]
[1:10:45] Let us gather jewels for a crown above.
[1:10:50] [singing] Send the light.
[1:10:52] [music] Send the light.
[1:10:56] Send the light.
[1:10:58] The blessed [music and singing] goel
[1:11:00] one. Let it shine
[1:11:04] from shore to shore.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Send the light,
[1:11:09] the blessed goel, [singing]
[1:11:12] let it shine
[1:11:14] [music] forever.
[1:11:19] you know, this tabernacle in the
[1:11:21] wilderness.
[1:11:22] I loved when brother Lyall had the kids
[1:11:25] lay it out there and I was looking and I
[1:11:28] was I was thinking, well, if if you took
[1:11:29] them and you moved them over here, that
[1:11:32] we could probably almost get two of the
[1:11:36] tabernacles in the wilderness in our
[1:11:39] little congregation here in our little
[1:11:41] building here. You think that with the
[1:11:45] importance [snorts] of that building,
[1:11:48] how small it was, just this little tent,
[1:11:53] but the intricate design. And that
[1:11:56] wasn't Moses's design. That was God's
[1:11:58] design as he sent through Moses. And I
[1:12:00] love the way brother Ly even even the
[1:12:02] way that he was talking about the frame
[1:12:04] and how did the brace for the frame was
[1:12:07] it underneath
[1:12:09] the the 90° angle or was it on top?
[1:12:14] It was perfect whatever it was and it
[1:12:17] was designed exactly by God
[1:12:20] the great engineer. These things were
[1:12:23] they were they were of the utmost
[1:12:26] importance and and we look at them and
[1:12:28] we think oh you know it was a tent but
[1:12:32] it was God's tent that he provided
[1:12:36] and the perfect intricate design and how
[1:12:39] how perfectly it was laid out from the
[1:12:41] fabric to the type of wood
[1:12:45] and yet it represented
[1:12:48] a tabernacle that would be built without
[1:12:50] [music] hands.
[1:12:52] and the intricate design that is in a
[1:12:54] true Christian today and how deep we are
[1:12:58] and how how many facets we have in
[1:13:01] ourselves.
[1:13:03] And it's much greater than this
[1:13:06] tabernacle. Why? Not because of the
[1:13:09] beauty of the structure, but because God
[1:13:11] dwells in it. Amen. Mayor Mooney, I'm
[1:13:15] going to call you mayor from now on.
[1:13:18] Can you can you come up and close, my
[1:13:20] friend? Can you come up and close in
[1:13:22] prayer? Do you appreciate brother Lyall
[1:13:24] and the and and the wisdom that he has
[1:13:26] and that [applause]
[1:13:34] and uh as brother Mooney is coming up. I
[1:13:37] I'm sorry I missed this. Um
[1:13:41] brother uh
[1:13:44] praise from brother Kevin Kerry. The
[1:13:46] doctor did three nerves on the right
[1:13:48] side of my back. No pain on the right
[1:13:51] side. Praise the Lord. The doctor
[1:13:53] decided to do do it as two procedures.
[1:13:57] The next procedure will be done on the
[1:13:59] 27th at 9:30 a.m. for the left side. And
[1:14:03] then brother Kevin writes, "Please keep
[1:14:06] me in prayer." So, praise the Lord that
[1:14:08] he's he's undertaken for our our
[1:14:10] brother. And he has one more to go.
[1:14:22] By the way, that mayor thing was over
[1:14:24] about 40 years ago.
[1:14:27] Lord, thanks you tonight.
[1:14:30] Thank you for Lyall. Thank you for our
[1:14:32] pastor.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; For our song leaders and our musicians
[1:14:38] that make Wednesday evening a very
[1:14:40] special time.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. and gives us an insight into
[1:14:46] what it was like more years ago than we
[1:14:49] ever want to think about.
[1:14:51] But as we reflect upon these times,
[1:14:54] Lord, let it
[1:14:56] reflect on what we are today as
[1:14:58] Christians.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; We offer these things in the name of our
[1:15:03] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
