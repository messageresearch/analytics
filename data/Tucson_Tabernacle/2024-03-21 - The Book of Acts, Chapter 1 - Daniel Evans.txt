not gonna read a scripture till a little bit thank you um first uh I want to make a couple announcements um I sent it out on the WhatsApp that um brother Lyle and sister Heather are shooting to for the target of having our next our first Sunday school class next Sunday now that's tentative and they're going to do their best and we have some cleaning that we have some to do upstairs to get rid of some of the furniture and getting stuff tidied up and ready April 2nd thank you brother while April 2nd will be um the Lord's willing will be our first Sunday school class on Sunday we have a brother that I just think the world of and we've had him speak here before his brother Eleazar Castillo from Jericho Tabernacle in Phoenix he's going to be preaching for us on Sunday morning I really think a lot of him he's got a really tremendous testimony I hope I can pull on him to give his testimony of his wife and and how that they went through some health problems and he moved from Silver City New Mexico to Phoenix um and he's just a young man he's just like 31 years old he's been through a lot and he's just got a wonderful gift in his life he's been a blessing to me his family's been a blessing to me and I know he's going to be a blessing to us again this Sunday um I haven't got enough nerve yet to take up an offering on Sunday morning but I know that we need to and I'm I'm just praying about when the right time to do that is we need to get new the new bags that we have to take up the offering in brother Branham said and I believe that giving is part of worship and it doesn't matter how much I mean you look at Jesus and and he looked at that little Widow and she she went in there and she she got I believe it was two mites to to give to the offering and Jesus said who has given more her or the rich man so we know that it's not how much but it's the generosity that we have with with what we've been given and I really do I think it's important that we make a way for the people to um to give and to take up that offering and something that's been around for a long time so I'll uh I'm trying to get up my nerve but it won't be it won't be this weekend um I want to talk about this book this letter this document called the book of Acts in the Bible it's um in my opinion in all of the Bible this book of Acts manifests Jesus Christ and his plan more than any other it really is it does seem to me to be a Capstone of um Jesus's Ministry it starts the book of Acts is a it starts at the beginning as we'll talk about today it it starts with the Believers being together in one mind and in one Accord and that that word one Accord with with one purpose they had one purpose in their lives and when we can get a group of people that are focused on one purpose then we can do great things but if we're all focused on on ourselves and our in our lives and our days that's that's when we won't accomplish much is when we're doing that so we see this book of Acts it starts in the city of Jerusalem starts with 120 people in the upper room and and then the first I think about 12 chapters are Ministry mainly to the Jewish people and it's it's the ministry Peter is the main subject of the first part of the book of Acts and Peter preaches many different sermons in there which the Lord's will and will get to and it's mainly there are some like Cornelius and different ones there are some Gentiles mixed in there but it's mainly to the Jews there was he was building a group of people and and it was spreading thousands of people started coming turning from the old Jewish ways to following the doctrines and the the uh religion of this man Jesus and it goes on and then around I think it's around the 22nd chapter or so we see the the a change happen and this man Paul comes on the scene and then it goes from the Jews it starts spreading among all of the Gentiles and it starts spreading not just in Israel but it starts spreading all throughout that part of the world and then it goes on and it ends with Paul being tried before Caesar and if brother branham's message that we all hold so dear to our hearts if the ultimate goal of the message of Malachi 4 is to turn the heart of the children back to that of the Pentecostal fathers it is back to this book of Acts then I think that we should very well know what this book of Acts is about this this acts we quoted so much Acts chapter 2 where we see we see the the day of Pentecost there and we see baptism if our hearts are to be turned back to that it's very important to understand not just the highlights but I would like us to understand the entire book from the author who wrote it down to the sermons that were preached and all the way to even who was the recipient of the first book of Acts why was it even written let's turn to Acts chapter 1 and you'll see a theme as we go through this entire the entire book of Acts that this is a continuation of Jesus's Ministry it is not the ministry so much of the disciples it is Jesus his ministry spread abroad starts like this the former treaties have I made o Theophilus of all that Jesus began both to do and teach now as I've said before don't just read over a scripture if you don't understand it when you come as you're reading as you come to a scripture you're not just doing it to memorize it doesn't do you any good if you just memorize it what does good is if you understand it so in another translation it says in this first book o Theophilus I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and to teach so who is this man theopolis have you ever wondered who this guy was this book of Acts was written to him so is so who is he as I was searching who this man was I found that his name as far as I could find means god lover so this man seems to be a great man he loved God and since the book the book of Acts ends with Paul awaiting trial it's suggested that maybe this book of Acts was written as a testimony for Paul in his trial that is one thought behind this book of Acts I don't necessarily think that that was it and then another thought about this man theopolis is he paid this author to research all that was going on with with Peter and and Paul and all of this and he paid him and he this was the report that was brought back to this theopolis that one is a little bit more believable but then another school of thought which is I think probably what it is is this man theopolis was a very important person maybe a powerful person and whoever wrote This Book of Acts was reporting back to him all that he saw and all the research that he made now as we go on I think that you will see that that is probably what's going on in verse 1 it says former treaties now treaties this is Old English that means a book or an essay the former treaties have I made o theopolis of all that Jesus began to do and to teach so the author is saying to this man theopolis that the first book that he wrote to him that all that Jesus began to do and to teach that so there was another book that this author of the book of Acts had already written to this man theopolis so it looks like looks like there's two books here and this book of Acts is the second book verse number two until the day in which he was taken up after that he after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen so so the book that was written earlier ended at the day that Jesus went up after he had rose from the dead and he had given instructions to the disciples and then he went up so this author of this book is saying to this man theopolis he's saying that was the first book that I wrote you that was the first letter that I wrote you and this book of Acts is the second letter and notice here until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen who are those Apostles we all know who they are but why are they now called Apostles and not disciples they're very different words a disciple is someone who is learning and sitting under the ministry of someone else when I was going to school I was in college I was learning let's say the the hydrologic cycle how how you have you have the ocean out there and and you have water that evaporates and comes up out of the ocean and the wind blows it into land and and as it blows maybe the pressure decreases and and the the forces of physics draw these water droplets to each other and they come together and and as they're up there and the pressure changes they continue to to gather together and then once they gather together then forces of gravity are pulling them down then the the water comes down as rain it hits the ground and it and it gathers with other drops and it starts to form a river that flows Downstream and we have the laws of momentum and physics and it and as it goes down and it gets bigger it it creates energy and it's able to pick up the the sediment and I'm studying all this and I'm learning all this and school and I'm learning the physics and all the different things associated with all of this and the water flows down and then it carries all the sediment and goes into the ocean it it slows down and it drops its load and it forms sand and we form sandy beaches and all and all of that and all the physics and everything that I learned in college and then once I graduated then I went into the actual field of study and I took what I learned like sister Holly what you learned in nursing school you took what you learned and then you applied it so you became you went from being a disciple of your professor into being an apostle of the work so once I had learned how to do all of this then I took it and I began to apply it to to better the community are better the scientific community and and to make to to make roads down to do things and that's the same thing that these disciples did and you'll see now in the book of Acts are no longer called Disciples they're called apostles so something is changing right here in their new role so and the same goes when I became a minister of the Gospel all of these years since I was a baby of listening to the sermons of going to church of reading my Bible and studying and all that time that that I studied the word there became a Time that now I took what I had studied and then I began to apply it don't stay in the just studying role no one stayed there take what you have learned and then put it into action that is the apostolic Doctrine those Apostolic fathers that's the way that our hearts are to turn back to that back to working so who is the author of this second book we have a first book that he refers to he says the former treaties the former book that I wrote you and it does these things now here is the second book that I'm writing you and this second book is the book of Acts and as always we can find our answer in the word and it's a very very simple answer let's turn to Luke chapter one and we're going to find out who the author of This Book of Acts is verse 1. for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth an order of Declaration of these things those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word now now Luke here is saying hey I did research on this Luke wasn't there with Jesus but Luke undertook this great effort to interview and he's talking right here even as they delivered them to us as these people told us and I put this together in this book Not only was this book of Luke was it inspired but it is also the result of a lot of work and a lot of research by this man Luke who is also a doctor it's a masterpiece and it's not only inspiration it's a result of a whole lot of effort now we're going to answer who the author of This Book of Acts is it seemed good to me also having had a perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent Theophilus here is the first book of the author of the book of Acts it's called The Book of Luke so the author of the book of Acts is Luke and another thing with this theopolis this word most excellent theopolis back then it was reserved for someone of great stature or a very powerful man or someone that maybe was was a very rich person someone that had a lot of influence so we look whoever this theopolis is was a great man powerful man now let's go back to the book of Acts so now we know who is writing these things we know that the Book of Luke from the very introduction The Book of Luke is research and study and interviewing I bet she interviewed John and Matthew and I bet you he interviewed maybe Mary and and Joseph of Arimathea maybe he interviewed these people and he put together this masterpiece called The Book of Luke and he even said that I had an excellent understanding of these things back to the book of Acts verse 3. speaking of the Lord Jesus he said to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion I've heard of The Passion of Christ it's a crucifixion of the Lord Jesus by many infallible infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith thee you have heard of me for truly Baptist John Baptist for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost many days since and when they therefore will come together they asked of them saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom of Kingdom to Israel and he said unto them for it is not for you to know the times or the season which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the Earth so here we have Luke and he's he's he's quoting back to the to the original research that he had done through his book and in the Book of Matthew and I believe is the Book of John and this right here is the entire theme of the book of Acts which I'll read verse 8 again but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the Earth now this just happened a few weeks or not too long before this day of Pentecost that Jesus had told them go out into all the world preach the Gospel Matthew 28 he says baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost he says go and and lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover and he's he in The Book of Mark and he's telling them all all of these things and then this book of Acts is the Fulfillment of what Jesus had told them and I have yeah Luke Luke 24 46 I'll read it quickly and he said unto them this is Jesus talking and he said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooveth Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem this is how Jesus himself laid the foundation for the book of Acts in this which is when I say the book of Acts it's the acts of the Holy Spirit working through the disciples 24 48 says Luke 24 48 says and ye are witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but Tara ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high Jesus himself instructed the disciples to do these things and now we see them together and here is Luke and he's recounting this and in verse 9 in Acts chapter 1 verse 9 he says this and when he had spoken these things speaking of Jesus when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they look steadfastly towards heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said you mean of Galilee why stanji gazing up into heaven the same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in a like manner as you have seen him go into heaven and Jesus had instructed that they would go to Jerusalem and that they would tarry in this place and I can imagine the different emotions in the disciples at this time so they had just seen the man that they thought that was the Messiah they had just seen him be crucified and all was lost and they were scared to death and they they ran around like scared rabbits trying to get away and then three days later after Jesus had died he comes back to them shows him the hole in his side and tell and they see that whoa he is the messiah and then there was a brother and I know that he gets he gets criticized a lot but I'm gonna stick up for him on this this one his name was Thomas and Thomas I know he's no doubting Thomas and we we say all these things but Thomas came he he said I'm not going to believe that Jesus is even I'm not going to believe that he's come or anything it's just too much for me he says I won't believe it until I stick my hand in the hole of his side and put my finger in the holes in his hands so Jesus comes to him and imagine how Thomas felt oh can you imagine how happy he was didn't believe it just it couldn't accept it it was all wrong it was all lost and Jesus was just a prophet and and all of these things he wasn't the Messiah and how could I been so wrong and then to see the man walk up to him say Thomas come here he says put your hand right here he says put your hand in these holes put your finger in these holes in my hand Thomas probably looked at him like oh and he said one of the greatest things anyone has ever said in the Bible it was the greatest revelation of the godhead of anyone that has ever spoken a word there is this Thomas that doubted that did all these things he said this made it plain for us all to read he said my Lord and my God Jesus you are God Jesus didn't correct him you are God thank God for Thomas and thank God that that was recorded imagine the mixed emotions and Luke as he's recounting this and I know Luke said it he talked to them he witnessed these people in person you know I give testimonies of brother Branham I give testimonies that my dad has told me or my grandpa told me or my grandma or my mom told me and and they were with brother Branham and I give these I give these testimonies that's exactly what Luke did Luke went to these people that were his disciples and he talked with them and he wrote down what they said and Luke is a master writer you'll read through as we read through acts and we'll we'll get to these later on Luke gives you even gives you little hints of when he was actually there with Paul and when he wasn't it's the it's the coolest thing he'll he'll be talking he'll be saying and they went and and Paul went to Macedonia and they went here and they went here and then we went speaking in first person so it's like oh he was there he wasn't somebody wasn't telling him this he was actually there and he saw these things this wasn't a testimony it was all true obviously but I just like the way that that Luke writes and he just he throws it in there to just make it so much more real verse number 12. then return they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's Journey and when they had come in they went up into an upper room where Abode both Peter and James and John and Andrew Philip Thomas Bartholomew and Matthew James the son of the son of alphaeus Simon zealotis and Judas the brother of James these all continued with one Accord in prayer and supplication with women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his Brethren notice for some reason it's important to brother Luke that he says oh and by the way there were women there too they had a place in this work and Luke it was important to Luke and you even see it in his gospel in his first letter that Luke includes the sisters probably more than any of the other ones do and I just I like that that he says oh and with the women also they were there too and in those days Peter stood up in the midst of his disciples of the disciples and said the number of the names together were about 120. men and brethren this scripture must needs to have been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas which was the guide that took them to Jesus look at Peter he had studied the word he was no longer this student as I was talking about myself and studying physics and chemistry and all that now Peter instead of being the disciple instead of being the student Peter now was putting what he had learned into action and he was taking the psalm and he was applying it to this he knew the scriptures now Peter says this for he was numbered with us speaking of Judas and had obtained part of this ministry now when this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out and that sounds gross I'm gonna talk a little bit about it here in a second and it was known unto all the Dwellers of Jerusalem in so much as that field is called in their proper tongue akeldama that is to say the field of blood now brother Lyle you probably know this a lot better and this may just be a legend but I was in Jerusalem I don't know um maybe four or five years ago and I was uh I went up to the top of the Mount of Olives and I looked out across the valley and there was a ridge that went out I don't know a few miles away and that was the city of Bethlehem and and as I'm looking out there this taxi driver who had befriended days earlier and our paths just kept Crossing he comes up and he says Daniel and I was like oh hey and I forgot his name but he uh he he walked up to me and he says he says oh you're looking and he says do you know what you're looking at and down across the valley there you know it's very populated there's there's all these buildings and and structures and homes and everything and and there's there's this big open Valley and then there's this field out there that's just barren it had nothing there was like a couple Trails through it and then the houses were up on the up on the hill and this Taxi Driver told me he says that place is where Judas was hung himself but I don't know if that's a fact I don't know if it's a rumor I don't know if if it is a um if it's a legend but even this man had respect to that and he said how he purchased this field and we know that story of about Judas and how he tried to give the money back and he couldn't give it back and somehow this field was purchased to bury people in and he ended up hanging himself and as I assume as his body decayed all of this stuff happened and then Peter goes on and he says for it is written in the Book of Psalms let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell therein and let his Bishop let another man take wherefore of these men which have accompanied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out Among Us beginning from the baptism of John unto the same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of this Resurrection now Peter here is talking about he says we are originally 12. Peter knew the significance of of 12 he knew that there were 12 tribes of Israel there were 12 sons of of Israel Jacob and Jesus had told had chosen 12 of these men and Peter by Revelation and by understanding of the scripture knew how important knew that 11 was incomplete so Peter knew that for these promises of the Lord to come to pass that they had to be 12. and we can pause for a minute and think about our lives and think about the plan that God has for all of our lives and to think that if there is something that we maybe have left undone something that that maybe that that is a sin that's in our lives or something that that we knew we should have done or that we know that we should do now and we leave it undone it's like 11 disciples and not 12. and how can God work how could his plan come to pass if we are not complete if we have not done all that we are required to do Peter understood that Peter had that Revelation there needs to be 12 of us so Peter preached this sermon that I was just reading and they took steps to make their group complete according to the scriptures now if you know brother Brown's message very well which I'm sure you all do you'll know that brother Branham talked about this man Matthias and he says well he never really amounted to anything but let me also read something brother Branham said I didn't give you the quote brother but this is from 620601 taking sides with Jesus now at the beginning the church was inaugurated at Pentecost and there the Holy Spirit fell upon them where Jesus had chosen twelve and one of them had fallen and they had chose Matthias to take his place and the Holy Spirit waited until all this was in order before it came they had to choose one to take the bishopric of Judas that fell by transgression to fulfill the scripture Paul wasn't on the scene at this time he was still probably in the synagogue studying to be in studying in the Sanhedrin Council maybe to be high priest one day Paul wasn't there but they had this very good man Matthias and they had this other man and I'll read the scripture here in a minute and Peter knowing that there was something incomplete there's something incomplete maybe in my life that I need to make right or to stop doing or to start doing and I look at myself so often many times that it's like Lord like I gave the testimony of of the man outside I believe his name is Alex the homeless man and and I was talking with him before service on Sunday night and he walked over here and and I went and I asked him if I could pray for him and I prayed for him and then I began to walk away and as I was walking away I had my back to him and as I was walking away he said will you pray that God forgives me of what I've done and it just broke my heart and I actually went back to him honey when I was telling you the testimony I forgot to tell you this part I actually went back to him and I said he has forgiven you that's the most that's that's why we're in church he has forgiven you but you have to accept that and I look and and now that as I'm reading these scriptures here in the congregation I'm reading what Peter this this understanding that Peter had that there were 11 and we needed 12 this man you need to accept the fact that you are forgiven or else it's incomplete and God can't do it until his perfect way is set forward which is repentance and then accepting this man Christ and that's why you see when we have baptisms that is what baptism symbolizes it symbolizes that I accept this man Jesus Christ just like uh it was Philip out with the eunuch and he was testifying and and the eunuch understood that Isaiah was speaking about Jesus and that Jesus had come and and this is the beginning of the book of Acts this isn't yet until when when the when it really started going to the Gentiles and Philip asked him Philip said do you confess that this man is Jesus Christ he is the son of God he required that confession before baptism and that is the request that is the confession that we have to have before baptism so when we have baptism that is that is accepting the Lord Jesus you go down into the grave like Jesus did you come back up with a renewed spirit with with an acceptance of the Lord and I think about that man and and I don't want to get emotional but it broke my heart because there was something inside of him and I did pray for him and one day I pray that he's in this congregation I mean the Lord's done a lot greater than that he can do that but there was something in that man that was left undone and so often in us this 11 May It Be is incomplete if he and when he told me I said how did you get like this he said well drugs like well duh that's what everybody is on and I appreciate his honesty and I said what do you plan on getting off of them and he said this he says well yeah eventually I could see he didn't want to stop that was something that that he liked that he required that he wanted was those drugs and maybe just maybe that would have been completed the process is if he would have had a desire to get off of the drugs and Peter here has this Revelation that there is something incomplete and if it's incomplete then this Holy Spirit cannot come that's why it's so important to us as a congregation we need to make sure everything is complete and one of us can hinder that one person here of The Twelve hindered it is missing verse number 23. and they appointed to Joseph called barsabbas who was surnamed Justice and Matthias and they prayed and said thou Lord which knowest the hearts of all men show whether of these two thou has chosen and he that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon Matthias and he was numbered with the 11 apostles now that word giving forth their Lots we see in other places it's casting lots but a while I've studied that backwards and forwards and up and down I still can't figure out what it is uh in some place it looks like they've voted and in this place right here it looks like maybe they they cast their ballot and they voted for Matthias but then in other places when I see cash Lots it definitely doesn't mean that it means like they were almost throwing dice so it's something that I don't understand but the Holy Spirit was in it and they chose this man Matthias now they had everything in place they had they had the 12 people they had their 12 now apostles they had grown up under the ministry of the Lord Jesus they had for three and a half years they had studied under the master I'm not going to get to chapter two so if the musicians would come and I'll I'll close but they had they had studied under the Lord Jesus they had learned all of this and now it was time to put it into action now they were it was time for them to take their place as apostles and they put it in order they did as Jesus said they went to this place in Jerusalem and Jesus said wait there don't go anywhere wait until you are endued with power from on high so they were sitting there and let me tell you let me ask you Bo Jonathan do you have they had no idea what endued with power from an on highment they couldn't have but Jesus never disappoints so they were together they had everything in place and like us we need to do everything that we can so we are not incomplete we need to do everything that we can so we have we have it all in order for our little part I'm one of the 12. you're one of the 12. but remember that if there's something missing in my life sister Shirley it's going to hurt you and there's if there's something missing in your life it's going to hurt me and God you'll see in this book of Acts as thing goes things go on that there was this beautiful Unity among the people and it says in Chapter 2 and we'll read it that they were in one Accord that they had one purpose and I read um that I sent out on the WhatsApp it says that they were of one heart and one soul how would God not bless that but this first book of Acts and laying the foundation for what's to come we can see really Beyond a doubt that the author is Luke and we can see that as he said this is my second letter that's first letter [Music] was his gospel that he had put together and it was just the Book of Luke is a masterpiece he records so many of The Parables Luke does and he he makes it just to work just to where you can just understand things I appreciate his efforts I appreciate all that he did for the Apostle Paul and all they did for all of the disciples and appreciated his hard work I am [Music] I want us to read this book of Acts study it because as I said this is the gospel on display this is everything that Jesus taught everything that Jesus if you notice it says begin to do in the Gospel of Luke just goes to the end of his life until he's he's he goes up to be with the father and it says just that he began to do he says that was my first letter but this second one is all that he is doing now with Theophilus this is the power now not in a single man flesh and blood named Jesus to where you had to be like that that little lady that had the bleeding issue you had to make your way through the crowd and you had to find him and then that's him over there and then if I could just touch His Garment I had to get to the man back then but then Jesus promises he says that greater things will you do than I have done here not the disciples could do anything greater but Jesus now was not limited to one man in flesh he became the spirit and then he went out in these apostles and it spread throughout the world he couldn't do it as one man but that was his plan was to lay the foundation to teach these 11 disciples to to bring them up to teach them in the doctrine to show them how to do things and then they go out and they change the world with the same spirit that Jesus had so do we understand do we have a good foundation for the book of Acts I want to continue on I get so excited thinking about what's coming thinking about I mean this next chapter there's going to be like four thousand and five thousand all these people they're going to receive the Holy Spirit they're going to speak with tongues and it's going to be in bimba brother Jonathan it's gonna be in Spanish it's gonna be in in in Swahili or whatever it's gonna be whatever language they needed to speak Creole maybe it's gonna be whatever language they needed they're gonna speak it the power of God is going to be just manifested out throughout everyone and they're going to start witnessing to other people and it's going to start going to the Jews and and to the different ones and these these Jews are going to start spreading it and then it's going to hit this man named Paul and he's going to go out and he's going to bring you to the Gentiles and then it's going to just keep going and keep going and it never stopped that Apostolic day never ended it is here today and the same power of God that was there with them in this book of Acts and we're going to get into it and it is great Jesus went to the pool of Bethesda and and he healed that lame man Peter and John went to the gate called beautiful and they did the exact same thing because it's not Peter and John it's the spirit of Christ and then we saw it we didn't my parents saw it my grandparents thought they saw people come up before the platform just as ananias and Sapphire which we're gonna hear about them in the book of Acts where Peter showed the sign of the Messiah the sign of the Holy Spirit and Peter told them what they had done in secret we're going to see that in this book of Acts and we saw it brother Jonathan manifested manifested in a man showing that that Apostolic age isn't finished and now today as we learn in this book of Acts we I believe need to see it in our own lives all of these gifts that we're going to read about manifested in this book of Acts we are going to see them I believe it I want it I want to not not for the gifts but I want to see God glorified I want to see Jesus return and it all started right here from this man named Luke and him writing this stuff down so that we can read it today amen let's stand God bless you all as I said let's get into this as a church continue to read and when you don't if you don't understand a a scripture in there pray about it study it send me a note send me an email say hey bro Daniel I don't I don't get this part can you maybe spend a little time on on

this wealth and we could we could do all everything that that we want to do in life but what good will it do at the end but this book of Acts here there were 12 disciples and women as the Apostle Luke said that they dedicated their life to spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ and they made a great difference and we are here today because of what they did God bless you all I pray that the Lord is with each of you this week read this book of Acts and maybe put yourself identify with one of these characters in here and put yourself in that book and let's be one mind one Accord I told you this morning that my brother Adam that was here and my father-in-law thing that they said more than once was there is such love in that church and wow I don't think that I don't think that they could ever pay us a better compliment than that we could have a million people we could have a thousand people in this church and have the best singers and everything else but without love it is all for not God
