[50:10] y'all can sit down if you want you can
[50:13] stay you can stay um I wanted to talk to
[50:17] the congregation a little bit I knew
[50:19] that it was just going to be the pillars
[50:22] in the
[50:23] church tonight not that there aren't
[50:25] some pillars missing
[50:27] but I um I wanted to
[50:30] talk just tell the congregation some
[50:34] things that are on my
[50:35] heart and then we will have
[50:38] prayer um this morning as I was
[50:41] ministering I stopped a little short in
[50:45] a in a couple things one of the main
[50:48] things that I stopped short in was when
[50:51] I said that God will send a messenger
[50:55] God will send a servant
[50:57] and when he takes that servant
[50:59] away then the people slip into sin and I
[51:04] I just kind of stopped right there and
[51:06] and I didn't elaborate on I had in my
[51:08] notes to say some things but now that
[51:12] we're just
[51:13] family I wanted to say what I wanted to
[51:16] say this
[51:17] morning
[51:20] and what happens and we see it we've
[51:23] been going through our Bible study and
[51:26] it's been just such a
[51:28] blessing and we can see that the same
[51:31] things just happen over and over again
[51:33] throughout history we see in the Book of
[51:36] Judges when Joshua the servant of the
[51:39] Lord in the Book of Joshua we see Moses
[51:43] dies on the mountain in the end of
[51:45] Deuteronomy and then we see Joshua step
[51:48] on the scene and he takes that mantle
[51:51] that Moses has and the people see that
[51:54] oh as the Lord was with Moses so he is
[51:59] with Joshua then Joshua took the people
[52:03] they crossed over the Jordan River and
[52:06] they started Conquering the land that
[52:09] God had given to their ancestors God had
[52:11] promised to the ancestors and now it was
[52:14] being fulfilled but
[52:16] then when Joshua
[52:19] died and those that were close to Joshua
[52:23] died that's when the Book of Judges
[52:26] started
[52:27] and that's when we see the people start
[52:30] to fall into
[52:32] sin and it happens again and again even
[52:36] we just went through 2 Chronicles and we
[52:39] see how Josiah the king how the priest
[52:44] they the workers they found the
[52:47] Bible in
[52:49] church and it had not been read for
[52:53] years crazy how can you have a Bible in
[52:58] church and them not read the
[53:00] Bible so they find the Bible they're
[53:03] like oh look Josiah it's the book of
[53:06] Moses and he's like what wow we are
[53:09] sinning so he falls down and he repents
[53:13] and then the Lord
[53:16] blesses happens again and again it
[53:19] happened when the Lord Jesus was here
[53:22] the disciples took over and when those
[53:25] disciples died away do you remember who
[53:27] is the last disciple to
[53:29] die John John died an old man he died of
[53:33] old age when the disciples
[53:37] died then we see weird doctrines start
[53:42] to enter into the church very strange
[53:47] stuff
[53:48] worshiping
[53:50] Peter worshiping Mary I mean this is
[53:55] this is what the I don't know if it's
[53:58] the uh the Hail Mary they say Hail Mary
[54:01] full of grace the Lord is with thee
[54:04] blessed art thou among women the Lord is
[54:06] with thee she was dead for hundreds of
[54:09] years when they wrote this the Lord is
[54:12] with
[54:13] thee blessed art thou amongst women and
[54:16] blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus
[54:19] holy Mary Mother of
[54:22] God pray for us sinners pray for us
[54:24] sinners she's dead
[54:27] she'd been dead for hundreds of years
[54:29] but do you see how strange
[54:31] this starts to slip in when those
[54:34] Servants of God would were
[54:36] out pray for us sinners now and at the
[54:38] hour of our
[54:40] death weirdness starts to come in what
[54:43] do you think Mary would have said if
[54:46] someone would have brought that to her
[54:49] she'd have been like son what are you
[54:51] talking about it's Jesus
[54:55] Christ he's the one that rose from the
[54:57] dead He's My Savior
[55:00] too but instead odd things start to slip
[55:06] in when those Servants of the Lord are
[55:09] taken off the scene and remember we're
[55:12] family
[55:13] here and I'm sharing my thoughts on
[55:17] this we see when brother branam was
[55:21] here Mighty things
[55:25] happened
[55:27] powerful prayer lines and brother
[55:30] Brandon was up there preaching the seven
[55:32] Church ages the Seven
[55:35] Seals revealing these Mysteries to the
[55:39] people and it was just a tremendous time
[55:42] who is this
[55:44] MDC what a sermon if you haven't heard
[55:47] that one deep Souls that are in prison
[55:52] now tremendous
[55:54] sermons The People people were listening
[55:57] and the people were blessed and the
[55:59] people continued to be healed and we
[56:02] continued to see signs and wonders and
[56:05] then brother Branham was taken off the
[56:09] scene brother brandham said this he made
[56:12] this
[56:14] statement he said the miracle of Martin
[56:18] Luther's
[56:20] Ministry was not in that he stood
[56:24] against the Catholic Church
[56:26] it was that he was able to rise above
[56:29] all the fanaticism that followed his
[56:32] ministry have you ever
[56:35] read any fanaticism that followed Martin
[56:37] Luther's Ministry I've never been able
[56:40] to find it I think brother brandham was
[56:43] giving us a
[56:46] hint I think he was warning us about
[56:50] him now I'm sure there was there was
[56:53] there was fanaticism that followed
[56:55] Martin Luther's Ministry there was this
[56:56] thing called the Lutheran
[57:00] denomination yeah I mean and and you
[57:03] know and the Jews and and the
[57:05] persecution and and all of that I
[57:07] understand that
[57:10] but he was Martin Luther raised above
[57:13] that
[57:15] fanaticism now we have brother
[57:17] brandham and brother brandham passes
[57:20] away tremendous message tremendous man
[57:23] of
[57:24] God a true prophet of God and
[57:29] then he comes off the
[57:32] scene and the people start dissecting
[57:35] his
[57:36] message taking a quote here and a quote
[57:41] there and stringing them together and
[57:44] making doctrines out of
[57:46] them and ignoring 99% of what he talked
[57:51] about which is what I was trying to say
[57:53] this morning you take out Jesus Christ
[57:55] from Brother 's message 99% of his
[57:58] message it's pulled out and it's
[58:03] replaced with quotes about brother
[58:07] Brandon with quotes about
[58:11] legalism with quotes about all of these
[58:15] different
[58:17] things maybe won't make the video public
[58:22] but brother
[58:25] brandham I don't believe believed like
[58:27] we believe
[58:29] today I don't believe he taught
[58:31] that but as I
[58:34] said that happens every single
[58:38] time people take this great man's
[58:41] message and they mess it up and they
[58:44] turn it into
[58:46] denomination and they start drawing
[58:48] circles and saying we are the Elite man
[58:51] it ain't new with us they did it with
[58:54] Martin Luther they did it with John
[58:55] Wesley have you heard of the
[58:57] methodists and then the methodists
[58:59] couldn't get along with methodists and
[59:00] then they say the
[59:02] wesland you know and then you have the
[59:04] the new lutherans and the old lutherans
[59:07] and and all of this stuff and and and
[59:09] they all fight and they did exactly what
[59:10] we've
[59:11] done it's just weirdness that
[59:16] follows and that's what I was trying to
[59:18] say this morning brothers and sisters
[59:19] without just in a full crowd without
[59:21] just coming out and saying it but we've
[59:24] done the same thing that has been
[59:27] happening throughout history it happened
[59:28] with the disciples with Mary and
[59:30] worshiping Peter and and and lifting up
[59:33] Peter and you go to a Catholic church
[59:34] and man you got Peter over here and Mary
[59:36] over here and it's like this is very
[59:39] odd really strange I was um I was in
[59:44] Israel and uh I went to the Church of
[59:48] the
[59:50] multiplication um there's a church
[59:53] brother Lyall they built a church on
[59:55] everything who knows where it happened
[59:57] but this is called The Church of the
[1:00:00] multiplication it was actually built I
[1:00:01] think on an old um I think there was an
[1:00:03] old synagogue there but this is where
[1:00:06] they say
[1:00:07] Jesus um multiplied the fishes and the
[1:00:11] loaves so I'm I'm I'm in here and and
[1:00:14] I'm by myself and I'm on a soul
[1:00:15] searching trip Heath this is this is I'm
[1:00:18] really trying to find like Lord I need
[1:00:21] to find you I need to understand what
[1:00:24] you want so Stephanie she saw that her
[1:00:28] husband was ready to die I was as
[1:00:31] depressed as you can be so Stephanie my
[1:00:35] sweetheart of a wife buys me a plane
[1:00:39] ticket to Jerusalem and she tells me
[1:00:42] this she says honey I want you to go by
[1:00:45] yourself because I know you and I know
[1:00:49] that if you're by yourself then you'll
[1:00:51] be able to get what you want what you
[1:00:53] need so God on plane I flew there and I
[1:00:59] started just taking this in and I was I
[1:01:01] was praying and and going to these
[1:01:04] different places and just eating and
[1:01:07] brother ly wouldn't you love to take our
[1:01:09] congregation
[1:01:10] there oh
[1:01:12] man
[1:01:14] [Laughter]
[1:01:16] huh don't
[1:01:19] laugh we got a good tour guide back
[1:01:21] there um we might maybe maybe we'll uh
[1:01:28] maybe um so I at this church of the
[1:01:32] multiplication and I looked
[1:01:36] down and there is obviously two
[1:01:40] different rooms there was an addition
[1:01:42] there was a renovation maybe like we're
[1:01:43] doing over here but it looked like an
[1:01:45] addition so I'm looking at the floor
[1:01:49] that I'm standing on and and it's it's
[1:01:51] the church and there's there's pews in
[1:01:53] there and
[1:01:56] the um the floor was geometric
[1:02:01] designs and then I look over in this
[1:02:05] Wing over
[1:02:06] here and there's like a swan and ducks
[1:02:11] and animals and and and I thought that's
[1:02:14] weird and I'm looking at the I'm looking
[1:02:16] at geometric designs and I'm looking at
[1:02:18] this and and there was a a seam in the
[1:02:21] middle and the tour
[1:02:24] guide he says he asked me he says um do
[1:02:28] you see the
[1:02:30] difference and I was like yeah he says
[1:02:32] do you see the difference in the design
[1:02:34] and I said yeah well this one's pictures
[1:02:36] over here and this is just just design
[1:02:40] and he said and this guy was
[1:02:43] Hardcore Jew he did not like Christians
[1:02:48] I you could feel it from him just didn't
[1:02:51] respect Christians so he's uh he says
[1:02:56] that he says see
[1:02:59] this was originally built by the
[1:03:02] original Jewish
[1:03:05] people and he said then this over
[1:03:11] here he used these words with all of the
[1:03:14] graven
[1:03:16] images he said this was added
[1:03:19] later he said in 300 and something there
[1:03:23] was this man named con
[1:03:26] Constantine that brought in graven
[1:03:30] images and taught the people to worship
[1:03:33] those graven images and now you see all
[1:03:37] of these images other places but before
[1:03:39] that they never have it he said a Jew
[1:03:42] would never put a Graven
[1:03:45] image and I
[1:03:47] thought I knew
[1:03:50] that I read the church A's book and so
[1:03:57] my point in saying that
[1:03:59] is when the men of God and the women of
[1:04:02] God
[1:04:03] leave then apostasy and idolatry enters
[1:04:07] into the church and really just
[1:04:11] strangeness odd
[1:04:13] beliefs why would you worship Peter and
[1:04:18] James and John they take
[1:04:21] a I was in the Catholic bookstore I
[1:04:23] don't know six months ago so and I saw
[1:04:27] that they have this little saint that
[1:04:29] you bury in your yard if you want to
[1:04:31] sell your
[1:04:33] house and that'll help you sell your
[1:04:36] house
[1:04:38] huh oh yeah it's Catholicism and this
[1:04:42] goes way back and what had happened in
[1:04:44] is RO when
[1:04:46] Rome when it when they they started
[1:04:48] persecuting Rome the ones that really
[1:04:50] they knew Jesus and they were with Jesus
[1:04:53] and they were with the Disciples of
[1:04:55] Jesus they were forced out that First
[1:04:58] Church of Rome you read the book of
[1:05:00] Romans that First Church of Rome was
[1:05:04] solid strong Believers and you look in
[1:05:07] that book it's like wow this is some
[1:05:09] heavy stuff the Apostle Paul could
[1:05:12] really talk to these people but those
[1:05:15] people were forced out of Rome and they
[1:05:17] were replaced by another generation that
[1:05:21] didn't know Jesus they didn't know these
[1:05:24] disciples and they brought in all of
[1:05:27] these weird
[1:05:28] doctrines and we see the same thing all
[1:05:31] the way to now we see when brother
[1:05:34] brandom passed away immediately strange
[1:05:38] stuff started coming in they said he's
[1:05:40] going to
[1:05:41] resurrect whoa where is that prophesied
[1:05:45] but a lot of people thought
[1:05:47] it and then they started as I said they
[1:05:49] started dissecting his message and and
[1:05:51] started bringing in this seven Thunders
[1:05:54] Doctrine and then started bringing in
[1:05:56] this tapes only Doctrine and you know
[1:05:58] these doctrines were there in questions
[1:06:00] and answers right brother Bram addressed
[1:06:03] them
[1:06:04] 1964 he addressed those
[1:06:07] questions they said brother brandom are
[1:06:09] we to be paraphrasing are we to be
[1:06:13] perfected by the
[1:06:15] tapes are we to listen to anybody else
[1:06:19] or by Ephesians 4 I believe it was it
[1:06:22] was it was the gist of it was are we to
[1:06:24] be perfected by the the tapes brother
[1:06:26] Jonathan or the five-fold ministry you
[1:06:28] know what brother Brandon's answer was
[1:06:32] no beautiful answer wonderful answer he
[1:06:36] said
[1:06:38] no he said the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:42] perfects the bride and that by the holy
[1:06:45] spirit so those Spirits were there when
[1:06:48] he was
[1:06:49] here but it took the man passing away
[1:06:52] for them to really rise to power and
[1:06:56] brothers and sisters I believe that we
[1:06:58] are
[1:06:59] suffering for these doctrines that have
[1:07:01] entered into the
[1:07:03] church and I believe that we have taken
[1:07:05] Jesus Christ out of the message that's
[1:07:09] why it's so important to me to preach
[1:07:12] Christ because that was the foundation
[1:07:14] that the prophet preached all the
[1:07:16] prophets preached that it was the
[1:07:18] foundation of the disciples it was a
[1:07:20] foundation of the the apostles they
[1:07:22] preached Jesus Christ open up your Bible
[1:07:25] to anywhere past Matthew and find me a
[1:07:28] sermon that's not about
[1:07:31] Jesus they're not
[1:07:34] there no even this mysterious
[1:07:38] book called The Hebrews that was written
[1:07:43] the the author is mysterious we believe
[1:07:45] it's the Apostle Paul and he wrote this
[1:07:48] book that looks like it could be brother
[1:07:50] L could have be taken right out of the
[1:07:52] Old
[1:07:53] Testament and it talks about this man
[1:07:56] MDC and it talks about the Sabbath and
[1:07:59] it talks about all of these just
[1:08:02] incredible subjects and it brings it all
[1:08:05] right back to Jesus Christ
[1:08:07] am so what I wanted to do tonight I
[1:08:10] wanted to take a few
[1:08:11] minutes
[1:08:13] and I want to go through some scriptures
[1:08:16] and I didn't have time I just came up
[1:08:19] with this
[1:08:21] idea uh like 30 minutes ago so I didn't
[1:08:26] really have time to put a lot of
[1:08:29] scriptures together but I think that we
[1:08:31] can cover
[1:08:32] it so
[1:08:35] what is this
[1:08:39] man who we believe to be a prophet of
[1:08:42] God a modernday prophet of God a 20th
[1:08:46] century
[1:08:48] Prophet where is this guy in the
[1:08:54] Bible and we hear hear so many things
[1:08:56] all Malachi 4 and all this and this
[1:08:58] Malachi 3 and Luke 17:30 and in
[1:09:00] Revelation 10 let's let's let's just
[1:09:03] let's just go right to the Bible and
[1:09:06] let's read it and it would be a good
[1:09:07] time to take notes and jot some of these
[1:09:10] scriptures
[1:09:12] down so we look I read the scripture
[1:09:15] this morning in Matthew chapter
[1:09:19] 16 verse 13 brother Jeremy if you could
[1:09:23] put that up where Jesus came to his
[1:09:26] disciples and he said who do you say
[1:09:30] that I am or who does the people say
[1:09:32] that I am and then they answered and
[1:09:35] they said this Matthew 16:13 says this
[1:09:39] when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:09:43] cesaria
[1:09:44] Philippi am I right Matthew
[1:09:47] 16:13
[1:09:50] yeah when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:09:52] cesaria Philippi he asked his deciples
[1:09:55] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[1:09:58] man am now listen to this don't just
[1:10:01] read over these scriptures very very
[1:10:03] important thing right
[1:10:04] here and they said some say that thou
[1:10:07] art John the Baptist remember John was
[1:10:09] dead had been murdered by Herod some say
[1:10:13] that thou art John the Baptist some
[1:10:18] Elias Elias is the Greek form of the
[1:10:22] Hebrew name
[1:10:24] Elijah the New Testament Matthew Mark L
[1:10:28] Luke and John was written the original
[1:10:31] langu language was written in Greek even
[1:10:33] though it was written by Jews do you
[1:10:35] know
[1:10:38] why it's awesome the reason why is
[1:10:43] because the common language of the day
[1:10:46] was
[1:10:47] Greek if they would have written it in
[1:10:50] Aramaic or Hebrew it would have only
[1:10:52] been read by the Hebrews wow but they
[1:10:56] wanted it to go around the world so they
[1:10:59] wrote the gospels all the way from
[1:11:01] Matthew all the way to Second Timothy
[1:11:04] was written in
[1:11:06] Greek so that the Romans could read it
[1:11:09] the Greeks could read it so everybody
[1:11:10] could read it so everybody could know
[1:11:12] about this man named Jesus how it's be
[1:11:15] the Bible is just beautiful and so and
[1:11:18] when you see the word
[1:11:20] Elias and this is the beauty of the King
[1:11:22] James Bible most other trans
[1:11:25] translations will translate it to Elijah
[1:11:28] but the beauty of the King James is it
[1:11:31] preserves the original language and it
[1:11:34] says Elias and it gives you a little
[1:11:38] hint that hey this was written in
[1:11:40] Greek that's why it says
[1:11:43] Elias
[1:11:46] awesome
[1:11:47] so right here with it says some say that
[1:11:51] you're John the Baptist some say Elias
[1:11:53] others jeremias or one of the prophets
[1:11:56] so right here we know that these men had
[1:11:58] already died and they'd been dead for
[1:11:59] hundreds of years so they were
[1:12:02] expecting the
[1:12:04] spirit to come
[1:12:09] back so let's go to 2 Kings 2 verse 11
[1:12:14] and I will give you a concrete example
[1:12:19] of how this can happen just to lay the
[1:12:22] foundation saying that you can have a
[1:12:24] man with the
[1:12:25] spirit and then that Spirit can later on
[1:12:29] come upon someone
[1:12:31] else second Kings chapter 2: 11 and it
[1:12:35] came to
[1:12:36] pass as they went on and talked I'm
[1:12:40] going to move my microphone down a
[1:12:41] little bit here um and it came to pass
[1:12:44] as they still went on and talked that
[1:12:46] behold there appeared a chariot of fire
[1:12:48] this is Elijah going up being raptured
[1:12:51] up into
[1:12:53] heaven and talked and behold there
[1:12:55] appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of
[1:12:57] fire and parted them both asunder and
[1:13:00] Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[1:13:03] heaven and Elisha saw it and cried my
[1:13:07] father my father The Chariot of Israel
[1:13:09] and the horsemen thereof and he saw him
[1:13:11] no more and he took hold of his own
[1:13:13] clothes and rent them into two pieces
[1:13:17] and he took also the mantle of Elijah
[1:13:19] that fell from him and went back and
[1:13:23] stood by the bank of of
[1:13:25] Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah
[1:13:29] that fell from him and smote the waters
[1:13:33] remember just a little bit earlier he
[1:13:38] and his mentor Elijah came up to the
[1:13:41] water Elijah takes off his jacket smacks
[1:13:45] the water and it opens up Elisha
[1:13:48] remembered that now look what he does he
[1:13:51] takes that same one that Elijah as he
[1:13:54] was going up in the ch he throws it down
[1:13:55] now Elisha's got
[1:13:58] it and they parted
[1:14:01] hither and
[1:14:03] tither I don't know what that means but
[1:14:07] apart and Elisha went
[1:14:10] over and when the sons of the prophets
[1:14:14] which were to view at Jericho saw him so
[1:14:17] they were watching all this going
[1:14:20] on and they're like no way
[1:14:27] they saw him they said the spirit of
[1:14:31] Elijah that went
[1:14:34] up doth rest on Elisha because he did
[1:14:39] the same
[1:14:40] thing and they came to meet him and
[1:14:42] bowed themselves to the ground before
[1:14:46] him so we see that the spirit that is on
[1:14:51] a prophet can somehow return and rest
[1:14:55] upon another man
[1:14:59] later or hundreds of years
[1:15:03] later proves it right here and
[1:15:06] Malachi when this man John the Baptist
[1:15:10] came
[1:15:11] Malachi was fresh on the minds of the
[1:15:18] Jews and they had a promise according to
[1:15:21] Malachi 4 that the spirit of Elijah was
[1:15:26] going to manifest itself again just like
[1:15:30] it did with
[1:15:32] Elisha so they were looking for
[1:15:36] this do you remember when Jesus was on
[1:15:40] the
[1:15:41] cross do you remember what he said I
[1:15:44] believe he it was in Aramaic that Jesus
[1:15:47] spoke which is a a language that the
[1:15:50] Jews would understand when Jesus was up
[1:15:54] there and he's hanging on the cross and
[1:15:56] he says
[1:15:57] eloi
[1:15:59] eloi Lama sabani when they listen when
[1:16:03] they heard
[1:16:04] him they said oh he's crying out for
[1:16:08] Elijah because even those knew that
[1:16:11] there was a prophecy that this Elijah
[1:16:13] was going to
[1:16:15] return so this man Elijah is on the
[1:16:18] minds of the
[1:16:20] people so they were looking for this to
[1:16:22] happen so back to Jesus
[1:16:25] when he said when he said to to Peter he
[1:16:28] said who do you say that I
[1:16:31] am and Simon Peter answered and said
[1:16:33] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:16:34] Living God and Jesus said unto him
[1:16:36] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah read
[1:16:38] this this morning Flesh and Blood hath
[1:16:40] not revealed this unto you but my Father
[1:16:41] which is in heaven and I and I say also
[1:16:44] unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon
[1:16:46] This Rock I will build my church in the
[1:16:48] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[1:16:49] it so my point in reading these two
[1:16:51] scriptures is to show that the spirit of
[1:16:54] a prophet rest upon another man after
[1:16:57] that Prophet leaves and we might even
[1:17:00] call it the anointing of a prophet I
[1:17:05] don't understand it and I don't think
[1:17:07] anyone
[1:17:08] does but it can rest upon someone else
[1:17:12] and it
[1:17:14] did so
[1:17:19] now let's
[1:17:22] turn let's see let's turn
[1:17:26] to Isaiah chapter 40 brother Jeremy if
[1:17:30] you could put it up there Isaiah chapter
[1:17:31] 40 verse three and
[1:17:40] four yeah the voice of him that crith in
[1:17:44] the
[1:17:45] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:17:47] Lord make straight the make straight in
[1:17:49] the desert a highway of our God for our
[1:17:52] God every Valley shall be exalted and
[1:17:54] and every mountain and Hill shall be
[1:17:56] made low and the Crooked shall be made
[1:17:59] straight and the rough places shall be
[1:18:02] made
[1:18:04] plain all right now let's go to Matthew
[1:18:07] chapter 3 verse three it says
[1:18:13] this in those
[1:18:15] days make sure I'm in the right
[1:18:19] place I'll go back to Isaiah 40 I got it
[1:18:22] here Matthew chapter 3
[1:18:34] verse one in those days Came John the
[1:18:37] Baptist preaching in the wilderness of
[1:18:39] Judea and saying repent ye for the
[1:18:41] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand for this is
[1:18:44] he that was spoken of by the prophet
[1:18:46] isaas isaas is the same thing Greek for
[1:18:50] the Hebrew name Isaiah you with me so we
[1:18:54] know is written in Greek King James man
[1:18:57] it's
[1:18:59] awesome and saying repent ye for the
[1:19:01] kingdom of of Heaven is at
[1:19:04] hand for this is he who is spoken of by
[1:19:07] the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of
[1:19:09] one crying in the wilderness Isaiah 40
[1:19:12] and3 what I just read prepare ye the way
[1:19:15] of the Lord again Isaiah verse 40 and3
[1:19:19] and make p his paths straight again
[1:19:22] Isaiah 40 and4
[1:19:25] speaking of John the
[1:19:27] Baptist so now we have established the
[1:19:29] Fulfillment here of Isaiah 40 now let's
[1:19:32] go to the Book of
[1:19:35] Malachi turn to Malachi chapter
[1:19:38] 3 verse
[1:19:41] 1 now listen to this this is awesome
[1:19:44] behold I will send my
[1:19:47] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[1:19:51] before
[1:19:52] me and the Lord whom ye seek shall
[1:19:55] suddenly come to his Temple even the
[1:19:57] messenger of the Covenant whom you
[1:20:00] Delight in behold he shall come sayeth
[1:20:03] the Lord of hosts now all right we got
[1:20:06] it Malachi 3 now let's go to Mark
[1:20:08] chapter
[1:20:12] 1 the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:20:15] Christ the son of God as it is written
[1:20:17] in the prophets behold I send my
[1:20:18] messenger before thy face which shall
[1:20:21] prepare thy way before thee Malachi 3:1
[1:20:24] I just read
[1:20:25] it the voice of one crying in the
[1:20:28] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:20:29] Lord make his path straight Isaiah 40
[1:20:32] and3 I just read that
[1:20:34] one John so it shows who he's talking
[1:20:38] about John did baptize in the wilderness
[1:20:40] and preached the baptism of repentance
[1:20:42] for the remission of sins so we now we
[1:20:45] now we see established that John the
[1:20:47] Baptist fulfilled Isaiah 40 and I and
[1:20:50] Malachi chapter 3 but there's
[1:20:53] more
[1:20:56] most so-called message Believers and
[1:20:59] brothers and sisters once again we're
[1:21:00] family here and these are the pillars of
[1:21:02] the church I cannot stand when we call
[1:21:05] ourself message people to me we have
[1:21:08] given ourselves a name just like the
[1:21:11] Baptist and the Presbyterian and
[1:21:13] everything else yes I believe that
[1:21:14] brother brandom had a message yes I
[1:21:16] believe it was true but I cannot stand
[1:21:19] the fact that we have done what
[1:21:20] everybody else has done and form a
[1:21:22] denomination around it and call
[1:21:24] ourselves
[1:21:25] message I read the quote one time Sister
[1:21:29] Sarah you remember when I read that
[1:21:31] quote the reason I remember is when I
[1:21:33] read it I looked directly at you and I
[1:21:35] felt like I I just I don't know why it's
[1:21:39] stuck in my head but I read a quote that
[1:21:43] said brother brandham said he said
[1:21:47] we are
[1:21:49] Presbyterian We Are Baptist he said what
[1:21:53] did you find in church in the church
[1:21:54] churches he said you should find the
[1:21:56] works that Jesus Christ did he says when
[1:22:00] you go to a church you should find that
[1:22:02] in quoted St John The Works that I do
[1:22:03] shall you do also and More Than This
[1:22:05] shall you do for I go unto my
[1:22:07] father that's what we should find but
[1:22:10] brother brandom said but what do we
[1:22:12] find we are the
[1:22:14] Methodist we are the Baptist we are the
[1:22:17] Presbyterian we got the message that's a
[1:22:21] quote puts us right in there
[1:22:25] with the
[1:22:27] denominations I don't like
[1:22:31] it I believe it it degrades brother
[1:22:36] Brandon where was I oh yeah Malachi
[1:22:42] 4 I knew where I was at I just we all
[1:22:45] know that's that's where that's our
[1:22:47] go-to
[1:22:49] scripture let's read it Malachi chapter
[1:22:53] 4
[1:22:56] verse number
[1:22:57] one says this for behold the day cometh
[1:23:00] that shall burn as an oven and all the
[1:23:02] proud yay and all that do wicked these
[1:23:04] shall be stubble and and the day that
[1:23:07] cometh shall burn them up sayeth the
[1:23:09] Lord of hosts that it shall lead them
[1:23:12] neither root nor
[1:23:15] Branch brother brandom said and I have
[1:23:17] it written in my Bible that he said
[1:23:19] nothing left of them there's no seed
[1:23:24] there's no stump there's no root that
[1:23:27] could Sprout up later they are dead gone
[1:23:33] and
[1:23:38] destroyed but unto you that fear my name
[1:23:41] shall the son of righteousness arise
[1:23:43] with healing in his wings and you shall
[1:23:45] go forth and grow up as calves of the
[1:23:50] stall and you shall tread down the
[1:23:52] wicked for they shall be ashes under the
[1:23:54] SW Souls of your feet in the day that I
[1:23:56] shall do this sayeth the Lord remember
[1:23:59] ye the law of Moses my servant which I
[1:24:01] commanded unto him in Horeb for all
[1:24:04] Israel with the statutes and judgments
[1:24:07] behold I send you Elijah the
[1:24:12] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:24:15] and Dreadful day of the Lord this was
[1:24:17] hundreds of years after Elijah
[1:24:20] lived but now he's saying I'm going to
[1:24:23] send you Elijah the prophet
[1:24:26] before the coming of the great and
[1:24:27] Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[1:24:30] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:24:35] children and the Heart of the children
[1:24:37] to their fathers lest I come and smite
[1:24:40] the Earth with a
[1:24:43] curse very wellknown chapter from us
[1:24:47] that that we
[1:24:49] memorize now let's go to Matthew
[1:24:53] 11:10 and we're going to go back and
[1:24:55] forth we're going to go with John the
[1:24:56] Baptist and and and the Fulfillment of
[1:24:59] these things Matthew
[1:25:02] 11 verse 10 I think I'll start with
[1:25:12] 10 verse seven let's go let's start with
[1:25:14] verse seven speaking of John the
[1:25:17] Baptist and as they departed Jesus began
[1:25:21] to say unto the multitude concerning
[1:25:23] John John the
[1:25:25] Baptist what we went ye out into the
[1:25:27] Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the
[1:25:29] wind but what went ye out for for to
[1:25:33] seea a man clothed in soft rainment
[1:25:37] behold they that wear soft clothing are
[1:25:39] in King's houses but what went ye out
[1:25:42] for to see a prophet yay I say unto you
[1:25:45] more than a
[1:25:47] prophet for this is he of whom it is
[1:25:49] written behold I send my messenger
[1:25:52] before thy face which shall prepare the
[1:25:54] way before me what
[1:25:56] scripture I just read it come on
[1:26:00] folks Malachi
[1:26:03] 3 and Isaiah
[1:26:07] 42 all
[1:26:13] right verily I say unto you among them
[1:26:18] that are born of a woman there hath not
[1:26:20] risen a greater than John the Baptist
[1:26:23] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[1:26:25] Kingdom of the heaven of Heaven is
[1:26:27] greater than he remember
[1:26:31] that remember what I just said that this
[1:26:35] John the Baptist was the greatest born
[1:26:37] of a woman it's a very very important
[1:26:43] thing I'm sorry brothers and sisters I'm
[1:26:45] taking way more time than I thought I
[1:26:50] would
[1:26:52] okay I just got excited I wanted to I
[1:26:56] want to keep going all right thank you
[1:27:00] verily I say unto you among them that
[1:27:01] are born of a woman there hath not risen
[1:27:03] a greater than John the Baptist
[1:27:05] notwithstanding he that is the least in
[1:27:07] the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he
[1:27:09] and from the days of John the Baptist
[1:27:11] until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:27:13] suffereth violence and violence and
[1:27:16] violent take it over by force for all
[1:27:19] the prophets and all the law prophesied
[1:27:21] until
[1:27:23] John and if ye will receive it this is
[1:27:27] Elias for which which was for to
[1:27:32] come wow right there is
[1:27:37] amazing Malachi chapter
[1:27:39] 3 does not mention
[1:27:43] Elias that's Malachi
[1:27:45] 4 but
[1:27:48] here Jesus himself is saying this is the
[1:27:53] Elijah
[1:27:54] that was to come it gets better
[1:28:00] too Matthew chapter
[1:28:07] 17 are you with me Sean are we good all
[1:28:10] right Matthew chapter 7 17 verse
[1:28:15] 11 it says this let's let's go verse 10
[1:28:19] sorry brother
[1:28:20] Jeremy chapter 17: 10 and his his
[1:28:24] disciples yes and his disciples asked
[1:28:26] him saying why then say the scribes that
[1:28:29] Elias must first
[1:28:31] come quoting what Malachi chapter
[1:28:37] 4 there weren't chapters in there back
[1:28:39] then but quoting what we call Malachi
[1:28:44] 4 and Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:28:48] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[1:28:53] all
[1:28:55] things what does shall
[1:28:58] mean going
[1:29:00] to it doesn't mean it
[1:29:03] happened that's
[1:29:06] future
[1:29:08] but
[1:29:10] but I say unto you that Elias has come
[1:29:15] already and they knew him not but have
[1:29:18] done unto him whatsoever they listed
[1:29:20] they killed
[1:29:21] him likewise shall also the son of man
[1:29:24] suffer of them so he's saying this
[1:29:28] Malachi
[1:29:30] 4 this Elijah that's supposed to come
[1:29:32] there's only one prophecy that's
[1:29:34] supposed that Elijah is supposed to come
[1:29:35] and that's Malachi 4 now this Elijah
[1:29:38] that's supposed to come he is going to
[1:29:40] come but he's come
[1:29:42] already what does that mean to
[1:29:45] you two different people with the spirit
[1:29:49] of
[1:29:51] Elijah now this next scripture ties it
[1:29:56] all
[1:29:58] together Luke
[1:30:09] 1 verse 16 brother
[1:30:12] Jeremy and many of the children of
[1:30:21] Israel okay he's speaking of of um
[1:30:25] um John the Baptist right here this is
[1:30:29] the angel coming to
[1:30:32] Zacharias you know what let's brother
[1:30:34] Jeremy I'm sorry let's go to verse 13
[1:30:36] just just read it I'm sorry but we'll
[1:30:39] just we'll take the time um but the
[1:30:43] angel said unto him fear not Zacharias
[1:30:44] for thy prayer is heard and thy wife
[1:30:46] Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and
[1:30:48] shall call his name John and thou shalt
[1:30:51] have joy and gladness and many shall
[1:30:54] shall rejoice at his birth for he shall
[1:30:56] be great in the sight of the Lord and
[1:30:58] shall drink neither wine nor strong
[1:31:00] drink and he shall be filled with the
[1:31:02] Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb
[1:31:04] this is the Angel Gabriel talking to the
[1:31:06] priest named
[1:31:10] Zachariah and many of the children of
[1:31:13] Israel shall he turn to the Lord their
[1:31:17] God literally in this
[1:31:21] case the man
[1:31:24] flesh
[1:31:27] God and he shall go before him speaking
[1:31:31] of the coming Messiah and he shall go
[1:31:35] before him in the spirit and in the
[1:31:38] power of
[1:31:40] Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:31:44] to the
[1:31:45] children many so-called message churches
[1:31:49] they say well Malachi Malachi 3 is John
[1:31:51] the Baptist Malachi 4 is brother brandom
[1:31:54] right here the angel Gabriel is saying
[1:31:55] Malachi
[1:31:57] 4 is John the Baptist but watch
[1:32:02] this I'll read it again verse
[1:32:05] 17 and he shall go before him in the
[1:32:08] spirit and the power of Elias to turn
[1:32:11] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:32:15] children and he doesn't say hearts of
[1:32:19] the children to the fathers
[1:32:22] whoa he says in the disobedient to the
[1:32:26] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[1:32:28] people prepared for the
[1:32:32] Lord Malachi 4
[1:32:36] verse1 the whole of the day cometh Thou
[1:32:39] shalt burn as an oven and all the proud
[1:32:42] yeah and all that do wickedly shall be
[1:32:44] burned
[1:32:47] up that didn't happen yet at least I
[1:32:49] don't think it happened because there's
[1:32:52] still life on Earth
[1:32:55] so we see that Malachi 4 part of it was
[1:32:59] fulfilled to turn the
[1:33:02] heart of the fathers to the
[1:33:07] children John the
[1:33:11] Baptist and then the second part Jesus
[1:33:14] leaves
[1:33:15] out to be fulfilled at a later time the
[1:33:18] heart of the children to the fathers
[1:33:22] remember Eli elas shall truly come but
[1:33:25] he's come
[1:33:27] already Matthew now we go to
[1:33:31] Luke and it says here yeah he's come
[1:33:33] already and he did this but he's still
[1:33:35] got more to
[1:33:36] do so that is this Spirit of Elijah
[1:33:41] that's supposed to come and then we go
[1:33:43] over to Revelation I believe it's uh
[1:33:45] chapter 11 and we see him jump up
[1:33:49] again with Moses we see him at Mount
[1:33:52] Transfiguration and Elijah again with
[1:33:55] Moses so this man this Spirit of Elijah
[1:33:59] God
[1:34:01] uses and this is
[1:34:05] what we
[1:34:07] believe was fulfilled in this man named
[1:34:11] William
[1:34:14] random now let's go back remember I told
[1:34:17] you to remember a
[1:34:19] scripture the one that says that John
[1:34:22] was the greatest
[1:34:24] man born of a
[1:34:27] woman why would he say that he says more
[1:34:30] than a
[1:34:31] prophet John the Baptist guess how many
[1:34:34] miracles John the Baptist
[1:34:36] did
[1:34:39] donut how many miracles does Moses do
[1:34:42] everywhere he went was a
[1:34:43] miracle Elijah I believe there was four
[1:34:46] great Miracles that Elijah did Elijah
[1:34:48] prayed and it didn't rain for three and
[1:34:50] a half years you talk about A great
[1:34:52] miracle
[1:34:55] right but this man John the Baptist
[1:34:58] didn't do any
[1:34:59] Miracles but why was he how could he be
[1:35:02] the greatest Prophet what's your thought
[1:35:05] think about
[1:35:06] it think right now brother Jonathan why
[1:35:09] this man John the Baptist was the
[1:35:13] greatest of them all I'm going to give
[1:35:16] you what I think it
[1:35:19] was John the
[1:35:21] Baptist had
[1:35:24] the greatest honor that had ever been
[1:35:29] given to a
[1:35:30] man and that was to
[1:35:33] introduce God himself that was to
[1:35:37] introduce
[1:35:38] Jehovah in a
[1:35:41] man born in a
[1:35:45] manger through a virgin
[1:35:48] birth raised
[1:35:51] up come into
[1:35:54] the
[1:35:55] water and here's
[1:35:59] John the savior of
[1:36:02] mankind
[1:36:03] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:36:07] the sins of the world can you imagine of
[1:36:11] course he was the
[1:36:13] greatest he was the greatest because he
[1:36:15] got to introduce God himself he got to
[1:36:17] introduced the Messiah the whole Old
[1:36:19] Testament from Genesis all the way
[1:36:21] through Malachi was about
[1:36:24] this man and here's
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:28] John behold man Lamb of God that takes
[1:36:32] away the sins of the world and let me
[1:36:33] tell you another thing that he
[1:36:36] did this is this is even better Sean
[1:36:40] listen to this you know like this so
[1:36:42] John we talk about
[1:36:45] Christians Christians want to make more
[1:36:48] Christians I said this morning you don't
[1:36:50] see any evangelism in the Old Testament
[1:36:53] you don't see people getting
[1:36:55] converted you know like I said there's a
[1:36:57] couple that got that married into it I
[1:36:59] guess there was Ruth and and and um
[1:37:02] Rahab probably a couple
[1:37:05] more but the whole thing about
[1:37:07] Christianity Jesus said go tell the
[1:37:10] world about
[1:37:12] me go tell them Make
[1:37:15] Disciples of all the
[1:37:17] nations tell them all I'm here I came
[1:37:24] I conquered death hell and the
[1:37:29] grave he was crucified on the cross the
[1:37:32] blood of Jesus Christ cleansed us from
[1:37:36] our sins didn't just cover it but made
[1:37:40] us white as snow to where if we come now
[1:37:44] to Christ we can come as a pure being
[1:37:50] Jesus or God the Father looks down and
[1:37:53] and sees his son and doesn't brother Joe
[1:37:55] doesn't see your sins doesn't see my
[1:37:57] sins doesn't see all my mistakes he
[1:38:00] looks down and he sees that one that
[1:38:02] went into the water with John the
[1:38:04] Baptist and was baptized that's what he
[1:38:07] sees and you wonder why it's so
[1:38:10] important that I constantly preach about
[1:38:13] Jesus Christ what was brother brandom's
[1:38:15] message if we believe that he was
[1:38:17] Malachi 4 it wasn't to introduce
[1:38:21] himself it was to say
[1:38:24] I'm here I am a sign to you that Jesus
[1:38:29] Christ is on his
[1:38:31] way how
[1:38:33] beautiful but it's about
[1:38:36] Jesus and as I said we've taken and
[1:38:38] we've made it about
[1:38:40] him so when John the
[1:38:48] Baptist when John the
[1:38:51] Baptist introduced oh I didn't I didn't
[1:38:54] tell you Sean what he
[1:38:57] did when John the Baptist was in the
[1:39:00] water he said Behold the Lamb of God he
[1:39:03] looked over across the river and there
[1:39:04] was Jesus he said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:39:06] that takes away the sins of the world
[1:39:08] there was two people that were with him
[1:39:10] oh there's probably a lot of people
[1:39:12] there's two
[1:39:14] predestinated Childs of
[1:39:17] god named
[1:39:20] John and
[1:39:22] Andrew and when John the Baptist looked
[1:39:25] out there he said that's him what did
[1:39:27] John what did John and Andrew
[1:39:29] do I'm doing it I'm doing what the
[1:39:33] prophet said I'm following him if he's
[1:39:37] the Messiah he's the Lamb of God I want
[1:39:40] to be with
[1:39:41] him the same
[1:39:44] thing yes the same thing that brother
[1:39:47] brandom did he said Behold the Lamb of
[1:39:49] God he said follow Jesus he said he is
[1:39:52] alive today he said he raises the dead
[1:39:56] casts out Devils heals the sick he still
[1:39:59] does all these things now follow
[1:40:02] him John the
[1:40:04] Baptist had the first converts to Jesus
[1:40:09] Christ what an
[1:40:11] honor what a great honor he converted
[1:40:16] the first Christian
[1:40:18] people which is John and Andrew wow and
[1:40:22] we all come from
[1:40:25] them from their
[1:40:27] witness and John the Baptist got it
[1:40:30] started man the greatest work that's
[1:40:32] ever
[1:40:33] happened John got it going why was he
[1:40:37] the greatest one I mean nobody even
[1:40:39] compares to him it's like Moses was yeah
[1:40:44] Moses I mean he brought him out of the
[1:40:47] he brought them out of Egypt but they
[1:40:49] all died in the
[1:40:51] wilderness Moses was awesome don't get
[1:40:54] me wrong but compared to
[1:40:57] John these people that came out of sin
[1:41:00] through John are alive
[1:41:03] today and have received eternal life and
[1:41:07] they will live for all of
[1:41:13] eternity well I preached the whole
[1:41:22] time
[1:41:26] I do want to
[1:41:27] say a couple more things and before you
[1:41:31] all come I still want you all to hear it
[1:41:32] too
[1:41:34] musicians there is a scripture that
[1:41:37] troubled
[1:41:39] me I remember I remember reading it
[1:41:42] years and years
[1:41:44] ago and it was along the same
[1:41:47] lines of je of of John the Baptist there
[1:41:51] and he says Behold the Lamb of God
[1:41:54] John and Andrew went and they followed
[1:41:56] him and then they started this
[1:41:58] incredible work and and they tell Andrew
[1:42:01] tells his brother Peter and and and
[1:42:02] Peter comes and John probably tells his
[1:42:05] brother James and James comes and then
[1:42:08] pretty much pretty soon there's 12
[1:42:09] disciples and then there's a bunch of
[1:42:11] sisters there and it grows and grows and
[1:42:14] grows and grows and we see him like I
[1:42:15] talked about this morning the day of
[1:42:17] Pentecost then there's thousands and it
[1:42:19] just exponentially goes around the
[1:42:22] world
[1:42:23] but there's one scripture that's very
[1:42:28] strange let's go to uh John chapter
[1:42:43] 3 is
[1:42:48] it verse
[1:42:50] 22 if you have a skull field Bible it's
[1:42:53] it the last testimony of John the
[1:42:58] Baptist very now listen closely as I
[1:43:01] read and put yourself in 2,000 years ago
[1:43:07] in this group of
[1:43:09] people and after these things came Jesus
[1:43:12] and his disciples into the land of
[1:43:15] Judea and there he carried with them and
[1:43:18] baptized and John also was baptizing in
[1:43:22] Enon
[1:43:23] near Saleem near to
[1:43:25] Saleem because there was much water
[1:43:28] there and they came and were
[1:43:32] baptized something sound
[1:43:38] strange verse 23 and John also was
[1:43:43] baptizing verse
[1:43:45] 22 after these things came Jesus and his
[1:43:48] disciples into the land of Judea and
[1:43:50] there he carried with them and baptized
[1:43:54] and John also was
[1:43:58] baptizing what you get where I'm going
[1:44:01] if not I'll keep
[1:44:03] going for John was not yet cast into
[1:44:07] prison and there arose a question
[1:44:09] between some of John's
[1:44:12] disciples and the Jews about
[1:44:15] purifying and they came unto John and
[1:44:17] they said unto him Rabbi he that was
[1:44:19] with thee beyond the Jordan to whom thou
[1:44:21] bearest Witness
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:27] what John we love you John you're a
[1:44:29] prophet John praise the Lord for John
[1:44:31] you're Malachi 4 John you're Malachi 3
[1:44:34] John you're Isaiah 40 John we want to be
[1:44:36] with you and the one that you told us
[1:44:41] about the reason he was there brother
[1:44:51] Jonathan Rabbi he that was with thee
[1:44:53] Beyond Jordan to whom thou bearest
[1:44:55] witness he's talking about Jesus
[1:44:58] Christ behold the same baptized
[1:45:01] baptizeth and all the men came to
[1:45:05] him John we love you John you've got the
[1:45:08] message of the
[1:45:11] hour and the one that you told us about
[1:45:14] he's baptizing and they're baptizing
[1:45:15] more than we
[1:45:17] are we need to take him
[1:45:20] out
[1:45:21] what
[1:45:23] John
[1:45:24] answered and said a man can receive
[1:45:27] nothing except it be given him from
[1:45:30] Heaven you yourselves bear me witness
[1:45:33] that I said I am not the
[1:45:37] Christ but he that I am
[1:45:41] sent before
[1:45:44] him he that hath the bride is the
[1:45:49] bridegroom John's like listen I'm not
[1:45:52] the bride Grom
[1:45:55] guys he that hath the bride is the
[1:45:57] bridegroom but the
[1:46:00] friend of the bridegroom which
[1:46:03] standeth and heareth him rejoiceth
[1:46:06] greatly because of the bridegroom's
[1:46:11] voice this is my joy this my joy
[1:46:15] therefore is
[1:46:17] fulfilled he must increase but I must
[1:46:21] decrease my
[1:46:24] question if John bore witness of Jesus
[1:46:29] Christ then why did he still have
[1:46:33] disciples why did they not do what the
[1:46:36] prophet
[1:46:37] said wow why didn't they go to
[1:46:42] Jesus but you know what
[1:46:44] happened they stayed with
[1:46:47] John they didn't do what he said and
[1:46:50] they continued on and to this day there
[1:46:53] is a remnant of these
[1:46:56] people that still follow the ministry of
[1:46:58] John the Baptist except for the part
[1:47:01] about Jesus
[1:47:05] Christ how many message
[1:47:07] Believers have the same
[1:47:12] testimony brother brandom
[1:47:15] said
[1:47:17] that he said many times he said I'm a
[1:47:21] Baptist
[1:47:24] and the Baptist the Baptists were a
[1:47:27] denomination but brother Brandon was he
[1:47:29] was he was proud of his roots he wasn't
[1:47:31] he wasn't trying to say that I'm I'm I'm
[1:47:33] against
[1:47:35] this but he said I'm he said I'm a
[1:47:40] Baptist but he's been filled with the
[1:47:42] Holy Spirit and changed and brother
[1:47:45] brandom brought more brought the message
[1:47:48] and of course condemned the
[1:47:50] denominations but I see all the messages
[1:47:54] all the denominations around all the
[1:47:57] sect and the um the divisions that are
[1:47:59] in the message and I say listen I'm
[1:48:02] tapes
[1:48:04] only I still
[1:48:06] am if you want to hear Brother brandom's
[1:48:09] message listen to
[1:48:12] him he said it a lot better than I can
[1:48:15] say
[1:48:16] it he's
[1:48:18] awesome but if you listen to someone
[1:48:21] tell you what he said they are going to
[1:48:24] put their own ideas in
[1:48:28] there and it's going to
[1:48:30] [Music]
[1:48:31] change just as it
[1:48:36] changed with the prophets with Paul with
[1:48:41] Peter and the Catholic Church stepped
[1:48:44] in they would have done better just to
[1:48:47] stay with the teaching rather than out
[1:48:50] all of this weird stuff
[1:48:55] it's a
[1:48:57] truth I love brother Brown's message but
[1:49:00] let me tell you something I can't preach
[1:49:03] it brother brand told my grandpa that I
[1:49:06] mean not brother Brandon brother Neville
[1:49:09] some of the people asked brother Neville
[1:49:10] they
[1:49:11] said how come you don't preach brother
[1:49:13] brandom's message you know brother
[1:49:16] Neville said he said I
[1:49:18] can't that message was for a prophet to
[1:49:21] preach he said I I got to preach what's
[1:49:24] on my heart brothers and sisters I'm a
[1:49:27] little
[1:49:28] guy I'm the pastor of this church and I
[1:49:30] love you
[1:49:31] all my message is for you live right
[1:49:37] stay with the word listen to The Prophet
[1:49:40] read your Bible don't
[1:49:44] sin don't fail love the
[1:49:48] Lord that's my job that's what I want to
[1:49:53] do but I see back to my original
[1:49:57] point I
[1:49:59] see as soon as God took the messenger
[1:50:02] off the scene Inc comes in all the
[1:50:06] heresies and all the weirdness and all
[1:50:08] the strangeness and all the divisions
[1:50:10] and and all of that and they they're all
[1:50:12] because some everybody wants to be the
[1:50:15] prophet everybody wants to be brother
[1:50:17] brandom there was only one brother
[1:50:19] brandom that spirit is going to come
[1:50:22] back
[1:50:23] but it's going to come to
[1:50:27] Israel yes and
[1:50:30] Moses I have a feeling brother Li we
[1:50:34] need to be out of here before that
[1:50:37] happens I want to go up and be with
[1:50:40] Jesus I recognize God sent this gift I
[1:50:44] recognize it I love it I love to listen
[1:50:47] to
[1:50:49] it and it's not his fault that all the
[1:50:51] weirdness IS F
[1:50:53] followed it ain't it's
[1:50:56] not God bless you brothers and sisters
[1:50:58] I'm sorry for taking so much time
[1:51:00] [Music]

[1:51:06] me take some time tonight the time that
[1:51:09] you would have spent here praying take
[1:51:12] some time more than you usually do and
[1:51:16] spend it with the Lord because let me
[1:51:18] tell you something you can be in
[1:51:21] church and and listen to a minister and
[1:51:24] you can be
[1:51:25] blessed you can sing songs of worship
[1:51:28] and you can be blessed you can read your
[1:51:30] Bible and you can be
[1:51:34] blessed but nothing will bless you as
[1:51:37] much as praying and talking to God
[1:51:40] himself that's the greatest blessing
[1:51:42] that you could ever get brother Josiah
[1:51:44] and
[1:51:46] the the musicians come
[1:51:50] forward yes sir yes
[1:51:58] sir brother Aon asked for the I don't
[1:52:02] want this probably this video to go
[1:52:03] public but Aon brother eron asked um do
[1:52:07] do I think that's
[1:52:12] why brother Jeremy um that's brother Aon
[1:52:16] asked is is that why there's probably 50
[1:52:19] or 60 message churches in Arizona and
[1:52:22] they don't get
[1:52:24] along you know you know sad brother
[1:52:26] Aaron along that same that same message
[1:52:29] first of all we're starting to get
[1:52:31] along and those walls are starting to
[1:52:34] come down and it's it's a beautiful
[1:52:37] thing but isn't it sad brother Aaron
[1:52:41] that we call ourselves as I said this
[1:52:43] morning we're the elite we're the bride

[1:53:21] fold
[1:53:23] and I pray that all of you all to are
[1:53:25] too and let me tell you my testimony
[1:53:29] is when I was a little kid before I was
[1:53:32] born my mom played the tapes when I was
[1:53:35] in the womb the first memory I have was
[1:53:39] looking over a console Real theore
[1:53:42] Player and watching the the tapes go
[1:53:44] around and you know what it did me
[1:53:47] good I grew
[1:53:50] up when I would fall into sin then of
[1:53:53] the Manny I would hear those tapes and I
[1:53:56] would be
[1:53:57] corrected they were a blessing to me and
[1:54:01] for all these people that want to attack
[1:54:03] him and and want to take him out of
[1:54:05] context and and want to say that he made
[1:54:08] mistakes and want to say that that he
[1:54:11] exaggerated certain things or he was
[1:54:13] wrong about certain things my answer is
[1:54:16] I don't
[1:54:19] care I don't I I don't
[1:54:23] care I'm the man I am today because of
[1:54:26] those tapes I'm the man I am today
[1:54:30] because I had something I could go home
[1:54:32] to I had something I could play in my
[1:54:34] room I had something that as I drove
[1:54:37] when I was in my early 20s and I had a
[1:54:39] job and I was driving all over Arizona I
[1:54:42] could listen to those tapes and I was
[1:54:45] blessed by
[1:54:47] it that's my testimony God did he make
[1:54:51] mistakes
[1:54:53] was he
[1:54:55] wrong I don't
