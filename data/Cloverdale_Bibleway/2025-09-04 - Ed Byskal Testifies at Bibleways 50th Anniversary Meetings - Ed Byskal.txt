TRANSCRIPT
========================================
We've got so much to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; You can have your seats before we go any further. 50 years with a man of God. &gt;&gt; How thankful I am &gt;&gt; for that life, &gt;&gt; for that vision, &gt;&gt; and what it's produced. People have tried to strip it. We're still here. &gt;&gt; Chains have been broken. &gt;&gt; People have been loosed. &gt;&gt; People have been saved. &gt;&gt; People have been delivered. &gt;&gt; We're still here, devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're going up. &gt;&gt; We're going up. &gt;&gt; Like to thank brother Biscll. &gt;&gt; 50 years of a faithful pastor. &gt;&gt; This is the beginning of our jubilee. But as I said the other day, this is not a day rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Jubilee was a year of rejoicing. &gt;&gt; We can start as we have started rejoicing in the goodness of God that has led us, kept us, and has kept our pastor. &gt;&gt; Brother Bisco, would you come and say something, please? Let's greet our dear pastor. Heat. Heat. We're so thankful for you each one and for those men that are here on the platform that have left their churches. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother David Meyer and son Yes. have come from Switzerland. &gt;&gt; Uh, brother Tim Puit and brother Tim Puit has said he said again at our table and I believe it with all my heart. He said, "Brother Ron Spencer is a miracle." &gt;&gt; Amen. when he stands and preaches every week. And I know something about that. And he's the man who prayed a prayer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When I was laying in the hospital. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I suddenly I jerked my head because I knew my family was waiting. And uh I said, "I don't know." And I said out loud, "I don't know if I'm going to come out of there." I had had brother Ron Spencer pray and I said, "I'll just call his cell." You don't mind standing, do you? No. Few moments. I'll call his cell and if he answers then I know that God is has put it together and I call his cell and I said, "Brother Ron, I called you once for prayer. Now I'm calling you again for prayer." The first time it was just a a physical thing, but this time it's a spiritual thing and I don't know whether I'm going to come out of this place and uh he said sure brother Ed and he prayed a prayer and he started to pray and uh I thought while he was praying I thought I'm going to hang on to the words because this is my turn. &gt;&gt; The woman at the well, it was her turn. &gt;&gt; But now this is my turn. &gt;&gt; And I brought it up to today. &gt;&gt; And friends, I'm moved. I'm moved because God answered the prayer. And I said I I I prayed and I said would you have pray for me? I have 14 blockages 90% in the main artery. I have not told all of this and down to 30% in other and my cardiologist had a look at it and he said to my wife he said the man that did the uh bypass &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; and he didn't turn on any of the bypass equipment. He said, "This is off pump." And that's what they said on the document. It was an off pump operation. And he operated on my heart for three and a half hours. And he Dr. Chong was his name. And I thought it was Dr. Watson going to be doing the operation. So I I just when brother Ron Spencer was praying, he said, "Anoint the person, anoint the person or the man or the woman &gt;&gt; or the doctor." He said, "Anoint the anoint them so that they will rise to the challenge." And I thought, well, I know who the person is. Is Dr. Watson. And I went back into Dr. Watson's office. Or no, I'm sorry. I didn't go back into his office. I was laying on the bed. And he said, "Unfortunately, we have to leave. I have to leave tonight and I will not be there to do your surgery." I said, "Who's going to do it?" He said, "Dr. Chung. he will be in charge of the I said Dr. Watson you look awfully awful lot like a man that stood at the foot of my bed who was Dr. Watson he said I am Dr. Watson, but I can't do your operation. And he said, we have great teams. I said, would you be standing there as I am laying here? Would you be as happy if Dr. Chong was doing your surgery? And the head of the team, he said, that was the only time he smiled. He cracked a little smile and he said, "All of our people, our teams are good." And I said, "Would you trust them with your life?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Yeah, I think so. I would." I said, "That's good because he's the same yesterday." &gt;&gt; Yep. today &gt;&gt; and forever. &gt;&gt; And there was a sister here, Sister Shirley, Brother James's wife, and she's up in the recording room. Yes. And I said to her, Sister Shirley, Brother James, I said to her, uh, I've missed you. I miss you from seeing your face. And she said, I'm up in the recording room and I am doing it in Chinese for the Chinese people. And I said, praise God. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother James. &gt;&gt; And and and I know that it's right. It's right that Shirley should be up there. And I know it was right. And Dr. Chung, he was ready to do the surgery for me. and he uh I want to say this, my daughters were there and they tapped real quick and my for my wife's sake and brought up the Google search and brought up Dr. Chung's name and he got famous by transplanting three human hearts in one evening. And that was a 15. He stood on his feet for 15 hours and transplanted those three hearts. And I know I felt okay. I felt okay. And in the morning he said, "Hi, I'm Dr. Chung." I said, "Nice to see you." He said, "This is Dr. Kang from Singapore. He's going to be assisting me and uh watching while I do the surgery." I said, "Well, great. I prayed for you all both of you and by name. Dr. Chung, I prayed for you. Dr. Kang, I prayed for you." And they said, "Well, thank you." They accepted that, but I I wanted to get that in that I had prayed for them. And a man who was a cardiologist was not even there, but he was looking at the pictures and he said, "Well," he said, "we have uh 14 blockages and we've bypassed those." And the Dr. Chong was able to bypass them with about three only three bypasses. It was just miraculous. &gt;&gt; And uh so I was standing there and he said he said you have this bypass and that bypass and you have a a an extra one. He says and my wife said to him, "Why do we have that?" He said it's because he's a man of God and he's Jewish. He was Jewish cardiologist, but he said, "Well, he's a man of God." And so they operated on it and he he he wouldn't let Michael in the room. Michael wanted so badly to go in. Michael's our in-house doctor, but he this was above him apparently. Anyhow, Michael, that was the other part of the story and that's why they wouldn't let because I had said to my wife, nobody goes in and sees until the tube is on them. I don't I don't want them to see in tube and uh that was because my grand my uh son-in-law who's married to Linda Ardal and Kenneth Ardal was there and I said I do not want them to see them moving that two boat two weeks before he had saw He had had to give the word for his mother to have the tube taken out and she didn't last and they had a funeral for her. And I said, I don't want that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I I don't want that to happen. I want to him to know that it's all done &gt;&gt; and it's finished. And the man that was doing it, he said, "Can you hear me?" "Yes." I said, "I can hear you." He said, "The last thing little thing I'm going to do is take the tube out." And I they took it out. I wasn't in tubed anymore. &gt;&gt; And I was perfectly fine. &gt;&gt; And I've been perfectly fine ever since. Praise God. Thank you, brother. Thank you for your prayer. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your prayer and thank God that answered it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've got here my grandson. Uh there you are, Wesley.

Amen. &gt;&gt; And I have this was hanging in brother Cenbrer's office for many years and I had preached a sermon in Germany and he was there. He said that meant a great deal to me the prayer you prayed. And he said I've had it. And he he called his son uh Jonathan. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And while Jonathan came in and saw him, he sent this. He said, "I have had this framed and I would like you to take it off of my wall in my office and give it to Brother Biscll." And while I was opening it, he had passed &gt;&gt; from this life to that other realm. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And it meant a great deal to me, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; So I wanted to show it to you and say, God be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God be blessed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can I read the prayer to you?

[Music] &gt;&gt; And thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Tom. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Dad. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. You should tell the rest of Brother Sam. Brother Sam, you took your dog for a walk. &gt;&gt; The night before you were to have that exam and the dog stopped and went into the bushes, didn't it? And he started scratching in the bush and pretty soon he had the zip the zip file in his mouth. &gt;&gt; And you took it out of that was after rain, after freezing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; After snowfall. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Nothing could change that. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; And you plugged it in and it worked perfect. &gt;&gt; God be blessed. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Is he the same yesterday, today, and forever? &gt;&gt; Is he alive? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; You can have your seats. &gt;&gt; Well, if you think we're having a normal service, you came to the wrong church. We don't have regular services anymore. &gt;&gt; Can the church of the living God say amen? &gt;&gt; We have a few visitors that might be timeconscious, but we've changed that. &gt;&gt; I should say the Holy Spirit changed that. &gt;&gt; And so, we're going to have a jubilee whether the devil likes it or not. &gt;&gt; We don't have a time zone. &gt;&gt; We got nowhere else to go. &gt;&gt; We want to give God the glory this weekend. Amen. But I we'll give some brother David obviously all the time he wants. &gt;&gt; You see these banners that we have up here. Those banners were printed and they were put up over the sound uh um battens. You can see it. You read it vertically, not across horizontally. Did you get that? Because if you go that way, you'll be confused as I was. And I heard as it were a voice of great multitude &gt;&gt; and as the voice of many waters and a voice of mighty thunderings &gt;&gt; saying hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So don't get scared when we say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All heaven is saying hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For the Lord God omnipotent. You get that word omnipotent. That means our God can do anything and he has done everything and he wants to do more this weekend. &gt;&gt; He's the Lord God omnipotent and he reigns tonight. &gt;&gt; It goes on to the next verse. Let us be sad. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; what does it say? Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him. &gt;&gt; For the marriage of the lamb is come &gt;&gt; and his wife &gt;&gt; has made herself ready. That's your verse this weekend. That's our verse this jubilee time. And we want to thank God that he's so gracious to in interrupt the devil. &gt;&gt; Try to take our pastor. &gt;&gt; And I remember dad that you said, "Would you do this?" He said, "Do you want to see another Christmas?" That was pretty that's pretty profound. And of course we said we want to see him to see another Christmas. And God has given him another Christmas and another Christmas and another Christmas. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? So we can be here rejoicing with his sheep. &gt;&gt; Did you get that? His sheep. &gt;&gt; And here we are rejoicing with you, Dad. &gt;&gt; You've been a great shepherd &gt;&gt; and we love you. [Applause] We had a wonderful evening last night and I want to thank all those that have made this church and and brought it up and made what it is today and we had a lovely evening and we're thankful for everyone and everybody says don't say my name and don't say my name so I'm not saying any name I just want to thank the body of Christ here that has made this available for us this weekend to look as lovely as the church looks after all these years. God bless you. So, we're in a celebration. We're in a jubilee. We are thankful for the lives that God has given us in Christ Jesus. We are thankful for everything that he does within the body of Christ. We're thankful for men of God that have come to join with us. We have tonight, Brother David Mayor from Switzerland, France, Belgium, the bride. He's from heaven actually. And brother David has been a big part of going forward within the church. And over these last 10, 12 years, brother David has hosted had the vision with brother Biscll to have meetings for Europe, Africa, the collective uh around the world come to the meetings. And we're privileged to have you tonight, Brother David, as our our first speaker. We want to thank you for coming, sacrificing your family time, and your church. God bless you, [Applause] &gt;&gt; brother Timothy Puit. Brother Timothy, know I know we're short, right? So, this is not a short joke. So, would you please stand? Brother Timothy has been a young man that we've admired over the years. God has raised up for the bride of Jesus Christ. You have blessed our young people. Brother Bram said, "If you want to bless me, bless my children." &gt;&gt; And you've blessed us deeply. &gt;&gt; And Brother Timothy will be speaking tomorrow morning. And we want to all be here pulling on the man of God. Thank you for coming, Brother Timothy. [Applause] Well, here are my two heroes in here. Brother Ron, God bless you. You've been a friend, a man of God, a mentor, a brother, a buddy, as they say, and we thank you from the depths of our heart. You've always said, "Well, Brother Ed's been a hero to me." I want you to know you've been a hero to us. God bless you, brother. [Applause] And brother Tim, I don't have enough words to thank you for your life in Christ &gt;&gt; and what you've meant to this church. &gt;&gt; You have stood when many ran. &gt;&gt; I'll never forget that. &gt;&gt; Never. Never. &gt;&gt; That's a man of God. And we thank God. I can't say enough, but I want to thank God for your life, Brother Timothy, for your family, your church, and all that you've done for the bride of Jesus Christ. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Saturday night, Brother Ron will be speaking. Lord willing, we'll have a prayer line if that would be the way that the Lord leads. And then of course Sunday morning, Brother Tim will be speaking at 10:00. 4:00 will be a banquet and that is for you. We love you. We're doing this because you've meant so much to us. We'd like to give something back to you. The trustees have sat down. God bless our trustees, our deacons, and all that they do. They're behind the scene men of God and we're thankful for every one of them. And so we will have a banquet. They they will be serving at 4:00 and dinners at 5. And everyone that has signed up, of course, is is welcome. We have different ones here. Brother Steven Dodd has made it all the way from Grand Prairie, Alberta. Minister, we thank you, brother Steven, for making the effort to come with your sons. We thank God for all those that have flown in. We've got nine people flying in at two in the o'lock this morning yet to come. People are coming and we're thankful for them. So you look around the room and we hear of course of brother Dodd and and what he's done in Uganda and doing and brother Timothy has been a a great part of this and brother Timothy I know you don't like this but please could you please stand because we couldn't do whatever we've done without your support and vision. Happy birthday. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you for your friendship. Thank you for your love. Are we're Are we're going to enjoy ourselves? &gt;&gt; We're going to enjoy. We're going to sing that chorus we've been singing and I'm going to invite Brother David Mayor to come and and minister to us. goodness has followed us. Can we say that as assembly? &gt;&gt; It's been a sort of a song we've been singing in the last little while, but I preached on it years ago. And and that goodness that will pursue you. It'll overtake you. It will keep you. And here we are tonight, kept by the power, the blood of Jesus Christ, we can say, "Surely the goodness of God comes after us." Let's stand as we welcome brother David Mayor to minister tonight. [Music] All my days I held in your hands. [Music] From the moment I wake up till I lay my head. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] And all my life you have been faithful. [Music] Oh my so every sing of the goodness of God my life and all my life you have been faithful. Oh, so every single goodness of God. Hallelujah. Can we give him half of praise? Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. God bless you, saints. What an honor to be standing here. That's from the bottom of my heart. It's good to be back, but it's an honor to be standing here in front of the saints for this 50th anniversary. My I just want to take a before I preach. This is the moment I want to take. So maybe if you can take your seats just a so I bring you greetings on behalf of my precious wife, family, the church and I have my son with me. I'm very happy he could join. When I asked him do you want to come? Oh for the meetings I want to come. So he made it possible. So but again I repeat it's an honor to be standing here. many would have loved to be here. So I thank brother Ed, brother Tom for the invitation and we want to give honor where honor is due. So I want to take my time and we have all the generals behind. So it's really an honor and a blessing. But when God calls a man, he calls his wife. So, Brother Ed, Sister Ruth, I looked up the word legacy. What a legacy. It says a gift or something transmitted. Now, 50 years is well, if if youngsters and you know, teenagers, you tell them you're 50, you're old. I know what I'm talking about. So but 50 years in a church many things happen. We we could see the pictures log church how it how God blessed &gt;&gt; because that's been said but I want to said because a man of God had a vision. &gt;&gt; Maybe you were not there but when you look around that's God's doing &gt;&gt; and it is marvelous. It is marvelous. Brother Ed has given all he had for the wonderful world of God. And when I said he has, it ain't over yet. Because if he wants to give advice even now, he will say spread the message, spread the word, give it out wherever. Right? And when I said it's an honor to be standing here as you can look around and please do you know your brothers and sisters but there's an unseen huge crowd maybe we don't think about but that were touched because they received one message book &gt;&gt; because a man of God had a passion a zeal. So yeah, we want to give honor where honor is due. I met brother I heard brother Ed years years and years ago and but for the first time we met brother Ed in Germany. That was the first time we met at brother G Roaltz in Beaslesburg and there was a direct bond a direct connection a direct love if I may say. So don't be jealous. Please, because some people could be jealous, but don't be jealous. You cannot manufacture that. And through the years, I've spent time with brother Ed. I've been honored to have him in my home and listening to advice and and and what a blessing. You are blessed. We are blessed. And then I learned and that understands even better the connection is of course we love the word. &gt;&gt; We do everything we have for the word of God. And then also hearing his life story or you know when brother Ed was born he was in the Anna Turnbull Memorial Hospital in Saskatchewan. I'm sorry my pronunciation but what struck me is that since 1908 there was a Dr. RG Scott that was from the Geneva mission who was in charge. So, Brother Red, there was a connection already. You were born. But even before we were born, there was already a connection. &gt;&gt; We were together before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are feasting sir &gt;&gt; on what God has done through a vessel, a surrendered vessel. 50 years many things happens. Many joys, many hardships, many births, baptisms. Some people has left us. But I thank God for brother Ed, sister Ruth. You know brother Ram, he speaks about great woman. He says is a woman who has faith. That's sister Ruth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And greatness says brother Brandham is humility. Thank you brother Ed. He would never take credit for what he has done for the message. &gt;&gt; If you want to speak that's why I want to take this opportunity. Please forgive me brother Ed. But from the bottom of my heart I would like to say thank you. And when I say there's an unseen invisible crowd. Yes. When brother Ed came over to the meetings, you have people from different countries coming and say, "Thank you for sending us the message. Thank you for translating." Maybe you don't understand that because you speak English. You got all the message books. You got all the tapes in audio. But out there, there are people that live with one message book for months and months and months. &gt;&gt; So I thank God for a vision that he gave to a man. We're not lifting up man. But yes, we want to be thankful to God for what he has done for us. &gt;&gt; Brother Ed never wants to take credit. But I want to say thank you, brother Ed. &gt;&gt; I love you from the bottom of my heart. We love you. Family loves you. The church loves you. The saints love you. And while I was coming here, I listened to a tape on the plane and randomly and it was proving his word and brother Brennham starts talking and he says, "Well, there's my precious friend of mine, brother Reverend Eddie Biscll." Said, "Well, hallelujah." No, God knows how to do things. There, brother, my reverend, good friend, brother, Reverend Eddie Biscll, wife and children. And he says, probably he was looking for brother Eddie. Now, that's not the amen corner. He says, "You can come over here on the platform. You're welcome to come up." And then he continues to give the testimony about the Green Checker Church and so on. So, I'm glad &gt;&gt; the prophet called him a good friend. &gt;&gt; By God's grace, &gt;&gt; I can call brother Ed Biscll a friend of mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is an honor &gt;&gt; to be standing with real man of God. &gt;&gt; So, may God bless him. May God bless Sister Ruth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And like the prophet would say, brother Rad, Sister Ruth, a huge portion of heaven &gt;&gt; awaits thee. &gt;&gt; What you have done to the least. &gt;&gt; You have done it unto me. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. And thank you. Thank you. So it ain't over. &gt;&gt; It's just a continuation because something has been transmitted, a passion, a zeal, and we will continue until we leave this place. Amen. Why don't we stand? Hallelujah. We can take the word of God, take Leviticus, and please forgive me if I didn't shake your hand yesterday night. So, we'll have the whole weekend to shake hands. So, wanted to get ready for today, but I believe God will bless us tonight and through the whole weekend. So, Leviticus 25:8. And thou shalt number seven Sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years, and the space of seven Sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 40 and nine years. Then shall I cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month. So we see here Revelation 10:7. Okay, please read just putting some foundations here. In the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. And you shall hold the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof. It shall be a jubilee unto you. And ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. A jubilee shall be the 50th year be unto you. Ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed, for it is the jubilee. It shall be holy unto you. Ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field, and in the year of this jubilee, ye shall return every man unto his possession. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Another scripture in John 8 verse 31. Then Jesus then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, "If you continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They answered him, "We be Abraham's seed, and we were never in bondage to any man. How sayest thou, ye shall be made free?" Jesus answered them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house forever, but the son abideth ever. If the son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be partially free, you shall be 99.9. No, ye shall be free indeed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May God add the blessing to the reading of his word. Let's pray. Precious heavenly father. Lord, once again, we want to give you all the glory, Father. How thankful we are, Father, for the church here, Lord, for the celebration of 50 years, Lord God. And how we thank you for all the work that's been done, Lord. All those that have labored for this weekend. I pray may you give them a special blessing, Lord. May you bless Brother Ed, Sister Ruth, Father. Lord, may you watch over them, Lord. and how thankful we are, Father, to have been standing together here on the battlefield, Lord. And Father, for the blessing, Lord, through the vessel, Lord. So, may you bless them especially in this weekend. Bless each and everyone here, Father, those that are streaming, Lord. And Father, we can read your word, Lord. Anybody can read the word, but Father, we ask you, the author, to come down, Father, and to break the bread of life, Lord, to oh, Lord, make yourself real to each and everyone, Father. May may it not be just an anniversary for of a church Lord but may each and everyone receive his liberty his freedom Lord that you have given us Father. So may you take full control father I surrender Lord and may you speak through the vessel. We pray and ask these things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen and amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Amen. For a title tonight. I was listening to this song and said, "Oh, they're they're taking my sermon for a title, the bride's jubilee is a reality." &gt;&gt; Amen. We sung the song, my jubilee. So, it's something personal. My jubilee. &gt;&gt; Amen. There, where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. Amen. So, our worship is not to bring us back to Isuza Street or No, no. It's not just an emotion or an excitement. No, but it's it's the word of God, the opening of the word that produces that &gt;&gt; the dynamics on the mechanics. But how thankful we are. Amen. For the true jubilee. If we look up in the in the lexicon in Hebrew, it says yobel means trumpet. The Greek lexican uh says release from bondage forgiveness or pardon letting them go as if they had never been committed. &gt;&gt; Amen. So therefore I'm going to put bring a parallel now. We read Amen. 10:7 Revelation 10:7. Amen. And and God is so good because the prophet could say it's like you've never done in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. The definition of jubilee, amen, is a season or occasion of joyful celebration. So I don't want to see any sad face. This is an opening service, but it's not an opening service. Amen. It's a continuation. Amen. It's a book of acts that is being written. So it's from glory to glory and glory to glory. If you don't want it, I will take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. 50 years is gold. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is a golden time in the world. They speak it's it's a horrible time. This is a golden time for us for the bride. Amen. Brother Brandham says 50 means jubilee. 50 is God's jubilee number. The word Pentecost means 50. So let it be another Pentecost this after this weekend. &gt;&gt; Jubilee means the going up, the release. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the jubilee I want. That's the jubilee I want. Amen. We can look into Sabbath. The Sabbath means a rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then brother Bram says the Holy Spirit is a Sabbath. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we going to we going to just Amen. travel along through the scriptures if that is okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. And for the Americans, I I did some research for the our dear friends from the United States who crossed the border. I will have a big amen on that one. We'll see there. Yeah. The Liberty Bell was a symbol of the American independence. The first time it was rang was on July the 8th, 1776. And it was to summon the people to hear the Declaration of Independence. And on that bell was written a part of Leviticus 25:10. It says, "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." So, a country can proclaim liberty and people rejoice about it. People, oh, they'll have a big party because we are free. I mean, we can hear wars, rumors of wars, and and and we're sad and we pray for our beloved ones there and the saints there. And when a people is in oppression, yes, people live under fear and all this. But then when the liberty is proclaimed, it's a time of great celebration. Amen. But I'm not here to ring the liberty bell of the United States. I'm here to proclaim the liberty that God has given us. Amen. And we going to we're going to ring that bell so loud through the weekend. Amen. That each and everyone can receive the liberty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So my liberty. &gt;&gt; Make it personal. &gt;&gt; We know brother Brandman speaks about seven Sabbaths which is the seven church ages. Now the Jews they have been blinded and they waiting all this time while the Pentecostal first fruits has been poured out upon the church. Amen. So through the ages. Amen. The Pentecost, the first fruits have been poured out. &gt;&gt; And here we are. &gt;&gt; Here we are. My what a celebration. Amen. In return and jubilee, brother Brandham says as a type, we're going to use Israel because Amen. It's the Jubilee time. And the church was given a portion which was who? Christ himself that was poured out by the Holy Spirit into each heart that would receive it &gt;&gt; and then become sons of God. &gt;&gt; Listen now. &gt;&gt; We're building up now. Israel was a servant to God and was given a possession. &gt;&gt; Okay? And this possession was not given to anyone else. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. So when Satan comes around, he tries to steal your blessing, tries to steal your possession, &gt;&gt; the Jubilee trumpet sounds, &gt;&gt; and when I hear the word of God, I can claim my God-given rights. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory, glory. If someone &gt;&gt; or an individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God. &gt;&gt; So it's not any inheritance that God g. It's given by God. &gt;&gt; It's about time we wake up. &gt;&gt; The awakening of the bride is a reality. &gt;&gt; The bride's jubilee is a reality. Not an emotion, not something manufactured. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; Glory. So if any individual lost their inheritant given by God, &gt;&gt; there came a year called the Jubilee year. &gt;&gt; And every seven years there was a Sabbath. and this jubilee. Every man that had lost his inheritance, every man &gt;&gt; I'm looking to &gt;&gt; by some means if he was a freeborn. &gt;&gt; Huh? Brother Brandham says we are not born to be in bondage to be slaves. We are born to be sons and daughters of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Freeborn and trueblooded Israelites. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham would say, "I'm not born Charles Alabra and a Brennham. &gt;&gt; I come from God. I go back to God." &gt;&gt; Glory. So no matter who held the possession, he it had to go back to him free. He didn't have to pay anything. He didn't have to do a thing, but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance. It was a God-given right because by grace he inherited it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So no matter what had taken place, So no matter what has taken place before you arrive here, &gt;&gt; if he lost it, it must go free because it meant grace is a way provided for each individual &gt;&gt; to return to their rightful inheritance. My the Jubilee is God's manner of expressing grace to his people. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; For restoring or be or be brought back to their rightful position. &gt;&gt; Our rightful position in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now I believe that this is the hour again of Jubilee. I believe it's the time of Jubilee, says a prophet. &gt;&gt; Now, a man and his family could go back to their original inheritance. &gt;&gt; If they could hear the Jubilee, &gt;&gt; now we know Revelation speaks about he that had an ear, let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Lord, let my spiritual ear be so sensitive &gt;&gt; when the word comes forward. I don't want to be busy with all kinds or going around with all my mind battles, all kinds of thoughts. I want to receive. If only a word I know my life can be changed. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory. So he if he could hear the jubilee a trumpet sound and know what it meant to them. The priest brother Brown calls it the Jubilee priest. &gt;&gt; The Jubilee priest &gt;&gt; that sound the trumpet meeting service after service. Service after service. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Jubilee priest sound the trumpet. The minister. The trumpet is a gospel. So no matter where they lost, how far they went back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen now. How far you went back doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Whatever they had to do, they had the privilege. We have the privilege tonight to be in the presence of God Almighty. &gt;&gt; To come and receive again their inheritance. &gt;&gt; Come on, mom and dad. Listen to this. the whole family could come and receive their inheritance. &gt;&gt; You have a wayward son, a wayward daughter, it doesn't matter. It's your inheritance. It's your possession. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Or &gt;&gt; there's the other crowd that have walled themselves so far that they want to listen to what somebody says about it instead of listening to thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, I rather listen to somebody who might have a clearer understanding. I might listen to somebody who got a revelation or some kind of doctrine or whatever. Nonsense. Give me the pure word. God sent me a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; For who? For me &gt;&gt; for my jubilee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thine of glory. Now is the hour of jubilee. &gt;&gt; Come on. Now is the hour of jubilee. Come on, church. Don't put it on tomorrow. Tomorrow we'll have another jubilee. Now is the hour of jubilee. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come back to your original inheritance, to a real Holy Ghost again. And outside of the pure word, you won't have a real Holy Ghost. You can have sensation. You can have emotions. You can have all kinds of goosebumps or hair coming like this and all kinds of things. &gt;&gt; But it's not a true real baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, you could go free. Didn't have to pay anything. Didn't have to do nothing. Just get up and go. That's all he had to do. Amen. If he knew the sound of the trumpet, but he had to know the sound of the trumpet, &gt;&gt; for they were sons of God. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, a trumpet can sound many ways. &gt;&gt; In the army, a trumpet can sound and it's one sound to call you, let's come and dine. Another sound just to wake you up. or another sound for the raising of the flag. &gt;&gt; But the Jubilee trumpet had a sound, a clear sound, not an uncertain sound. It was a sound from God himself. And the people knew when I hear that sound, &gt;&gt; the seed in me knows when I hear that sound, no matter where I'm at, I hear the sound, I can go free. I be I can be delivered. I can be healed. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; But it's individual. &gt;&gt; It's your jubilee. Let's come back to to Israel. Moses receives the promise. Go deliver my people. &gt;&gt; They go out. Now they're front of this nice country. Moses couldn't go. There's Joshua and Caleb. The land where it's flowing of milk and honey. Brother says, "You've been on this mountain long enough, but come on." &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's go over. &gt;&gt; Let's possess our inheritance. &gt;&gt; It's time to rise to be sons of God in the name of Jesus Christ and rise to a place so you can return in this jubilee and hear the sound of the trumpet of the gospel of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are brethren, not a denomination. You are born sons and daughters of God. But if the slave wants to stay a slave, &gt;&gt; let him be. Let him stay in these walled cities. &gt;&gt; But you are free. &gt;&gt; He says, &gt;&gt; "Let's go back to our inheritance. Let's go back to the beginning. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to what we were from the beginning." &gt;&gt; An attribute of God. We come from God. We go back to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Joshua, he didn't have the poor me attitude. &gt;&gt; He didn't have the grasshopper attitude. &gt;&gt; He didn't have the defeat attitude. &gt;&gt; I'm making it personal now. &gt;&gt; How do we come to church? &gt;&gt; Oh, poor me. No, not poor me. &gt;&gt; Joshua said, "We're more than able." &gt;&gt; You think Joshua didn't have eyes? &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, he did. He even knew very well how thick the walls were. &gt;&gt; God always does. Like brother Joe would say, incredible math. &gt;&gt; So, here we have Joshua. How can I destroy the walls? The land is ours. The promise is ours. God gave it to us. But how can I possess the land? There has to be a way that these walls, these seals can open. &gt;&gt; If those seals don't open, I won't see my full possession. I won't see my true identity. I won't see my full inheritance. So what does he do? &gt;&gt; We never pray enough. So he goes, that's biblical, huh? &gt;&gt; He goes to prayer. &gt;&gt; And here he meets someone, &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord. He has his sword drawn. &gt;&gt; Are you for me or against me? &gt;&gt; I'm the captain here. &gt;&gt; I'm the captain here and I'm in charge of this. Say Joshua, you're going to follow me. &gt;&gt; I'm leading this battle. &gt;&gt; Our Lord is mighty in battle. &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even brother Brham himself needed the angel to come down. &gt;&gt; He says it himself for those that want to make from brother Brandham a god. And with all due respect, but he isn't God. He said, "If the angel wouldn't have come, I would have told you a terrible mistake." &gt;&gt; So, no one is worthy to take the book, to open the seals thereof. Only the lamb &gt;&gt; slain before the foundation of the world is worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof. So no man can claim &gt;&gt; my revelation. &gt;&gt; God keeps that to himself. &gt;&gt; So this is not a revelation of brother Brham. [Music] &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This is not brother Brham's property &gt;&gt; or anybody's property. &gt;&gt; This is God's property. Some people don't like it, but it's the truth anyway. &gt;&gt; I'll be gone in a few days. So, &gt;&gt; the word is God's property. &gt;&gt; And he reveals his own word. &gt;&gt; So, God himself chose his bride. &gt;&gt; Just like I explained, there's a connection. Love, appreciation, respect. I mean, that's what God, he chose his bride. &gt;&gt; It's not a person. It's not a group. It's not a headquarters. &gt;&gt; It's God himself. &gt;&gt; So now during those seven church ages, they have been walking in silence around the walls. And here comes the seven church age. And it says, "But in the days of the voice, &gt;&gt; when he will begin to sound, &gt;&gt; the mystery of God shall be finished, shall be revealed, shall be made clear. &gt;&gt; Christ revealed." &gt;&gt; Amen. It shall be finished. These walls, these seals shall be opened. These thunders will utter their voices. &gt;&gt; And you will have a jubilee. &gt;&gt; Not a man-made jubilee. Not from a man somewhere in a country or son. No, a real jubilee from God himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. For some there's still silence. H but for the bride the silence is broken. &gt;&gt; For the bride it is a rejoicing time. &gt;&gt; It is a jubilee time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There has been a message of resurrection a rapture message an adoption message given to his bride. That's why in the seventh time while there is shout king &gt;&gt; and these walls are coming down &gt;&gt; I don't want to go ahead building up let's go back to our origin the young people sung about it failure failure won't define me &gt;&gt; although Satan comes around and he says you did you've done this You've done that. You did this. You did that. &gt;&gt; Your background is this. Your background is that. &gt;&gt; Failure won't define me. &gt;&gt; I am a son of God. I am a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's about time we don't just say things, but we believe what God Amen. It's not what Satan says, what anybody says, and what God says about me. Glory. Glory. Amen. Amen. Amen. So what happens when God sends a jubilee in them days? Listen, the God that sends a Jubilee in them days is the same God that sends the Jubilee today. [Applause] &gt;&gt; All the ones that were in captivity didn't have to pay any price. They could absolutely go free. &gt;&gt; But it was their choice. &gt;&gt; Choose ye this day. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tonight you can be delivered. &gt;&gt; Tonight you can be healed. &gt;&gt; Tonight you can be sealed. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to wait until Brother Ron, Brother Tim, Brother &gt;&gt; No. Tonight you can be delivered. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. Now those that didn't want to go free, &gt;&gt; what happened? The master would take an all bore the ear which marked them to serve their master forever. &gt;&gt; You know why it was put on the ear? Because hearing faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the word of God. So to reject the message, to reject the resurrection message, the rapture message, the Jubilee message, the word of God &gt;&gt; is been born in the ear &gt;&gt; and be spiritually deaf. That's why we have all this nonsense everywhere on on the internet. So don't even waste your time. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. Sorry, brother Tim, to mention that, but people try to write, you know, all kinds of mails and try to provoke. We don't even want to waste time on it. I'm getting ready. We're getting ready to leave here. There'll still be fussing and the rapture will be gone already. [Music] &gt;&gt; So tonight, if you want to run, &gt;&gt; don't run outside. &gt;&gt; Run to Jesus. If you want to doubt, doubt the devil. &gt;&gt; If you want to hide, hide in the word &gt;&gt; because there's no time for wasting. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. There's one way. That's Jesus. &gt;&gt; He came down. Listen. He came down in a blood cell. Yes. &gt;&gt; Not through a man, but by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And in that virgin womb, a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built. &gt;&gt; So, let's look the resurrection a moment. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; The value I heard, can't remember who, but I heard somebody say the value of something is the price somebody is willing to pay. [Music] You can think about that &gt;&gt; and you can think what he has done for me &gt;&gt; for us. &gt;&gt; That's the value. That's your value. That's how he saw us. &gt;&gt; So let's never take things for granted &gt;&gt; or just an ordinary service or something commonly. No, &gt;&gt; God is so good to us. So we can look into the gospels. There's the four gospels and we can see that they all tell us the stories what happened around Jesus where Jesus was. So they all have different perspectives of what was going on. Now some tell it a certain way others is not. For example, there's only in John that you will read about Lazarus. But there's one thing they have in common. That is the resurrection message. &gt;&gt; They all write it what happened. &gt;&gt; So it must be something quite important. &gt;&gt; Jesus told exactly what would happen. He told it to his disciples. For the sake of time, you can read it in Matthew 16:21 where he says, "And I'm going to be killed and be raised again the third day." He told it even to the Pharisees, &gt;&gt; but they were not listening to the sound of the trumpet. &gt;&gt; They didn't want it because it was out of their, you know, they were so blocked, chained by traditions. &gt;&gt; But even there they heard it. Matthew 27 says saying, "Sir, remember that dece deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I will rise again." And people hear the word of God and they just want to continue. &gt;&gt; But not for me. &gt;&gt; It's my jubilee. &gt;&gt; You want You don't want your jub. It's my jubilee. So the resurrection message well didn't start by the disciples. It started by Jesus himself. &gt;&gt; God keeps that to himself &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want anybody to interfere with whatever. It's only after in the book of Acts that you see the disciples, Amen, writing about. Amen. And the book of Acts &gt;&gt; didn't stop, didn't end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; we are living a book of Acts. &gt;&gt; So now Paul says, "Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you." In 1 Peter 1, it says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy had begotten us unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, to an inheritance, &gt;&gt; incorruptible and undefiled, and that faded not away, reserved in heaven for you. [Applause] Where is the U group here? &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; So the resurrection, the rapture message is not an ending. It's not a conclusion. It's a climax. &gt;&gt; Revelation 1:18 says, "I am alive forever more." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 15, "But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen. And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching in vain? And your faith is also in vain. &gt;&gt; But there was a resurrection. &gt;&gt; So God intended for men of God to preach the word, &gt;&gt; not to push, play, and obey. &gt;&gt; Hey, sorry, brother Tom, brother. And &gt;&gt; hey, it might set somebody free. &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. Satan has bound so many people &gt;&gt; by all kinds of ideas of man, doctrines of man. While the trumpet, the sound of freedom has been proclaimed. &gt;&gt; The rest in Hebrews 4, there remained therefore a rest, a Sabbath to the people of God. For he that has entered into his rest, he saw he also had ceased from his own works and God did from his. So the rest is a confirmation and makes you a witness of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Now follow me here. It's just some teaching building up. &gt;&gt; So when that happens, it's not my daddy told me that my redeemer live it. It's not a testimony of someone that told me God is alive. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; My redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; I know he is alive tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's living in me. &gt;&gt; I feel him in my hands. I feel him in my feet. I feel him all over me. &gt;&gt; God's not dead. He's alive. [Music] Because I live, &gt;&gt; ye shall live also. &gt;&gt; I am the Messiah. &gt;&gt; And you are messes. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Matthew 21:1 says, "If the in the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week," now listen, you going to continue. I want to stay on that for a while. The Sabbath ends at sundown. When the sun goes down, &gt;&gt; when the sun comes up, &gt;&gt; that's the witness of a new day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we know the Jews, they didn't name their their days and and but Matthew here, he wants to make sure &gt;&gt; that everybody would recognize &gt;&gt; what day we're talking about. &gt;&gt; This marks a changing of time. This will be the last Sabbath &gt;&gt; where we will bring lambs, bring doves, we'll bring Sabbath. So after this Sabbath, it will never be the same. &gt;&gt; Because a perfect lamb &gt;&gt; was slain for me. [Music] There's a new covenant, a new day this Sunday. Prove that God is almighty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look for a little while what we find at the tomb. Okay. The first witnesses of the resurrection were women. We know in the Bible women represents a church &gt;&gt; a type. So the first witnesses of the resurrection is the church. &gt;&gt; What are they doing there? They have seen him lay him in a tomb. They saw him crucified. They saw all the events happening. The following day they come with spices to anoint him. They are mourning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They go there out of love, &gt;&gt; out of sympathy. They love Jesus. &gt;&gt; They go there, but they haven't went there for a resurrection message. That's right. &gt;&gt; And maybe some are here tonight and you have come out of love for your mom, for your dad, &gt;&gt; or maybe out of love and sympathy for for for brother Ed and Sister Ruth because it's a an anniversary. But God has a lot of plans for you. &gt;&gt; You will hear the resurrection message. &gt;&gt; You will feel the resurrection power. [Music] Stop limiting God. &gt;&gt; Stop making your own programs &gt;&gt; and surrender to God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something? While they were on their way, the Bible says in Mark 16:2, "And verily early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came into the seeler at the rising of the sun." Woo! And they said among themselves, who shall roll away the stone from the door of the sepoker? So here we have these women all kinds of mind battles. &gt;&gt; Here we have the spices. We have we will do all we can, all we have out of love. But what will happen? Who will roll away that stone? They were walking in darkness. They were waiting for the rising of the natural sun. &gt;&gt; But they're fixing to be witnesses of the resurrection, &gt;&gt; of the rising of the sen. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; They don't even know that something happened already to that stone. Amen. &gt;&gt; During that time, you know, Satan tries to attack the word every time. &gt;&gt; He tried even while Jesus was here. &gt;&gt; That's the antichrist spirit that we can see working all over the world. &gt;&gt; But God's spirit is here and he raises a standard. &gt;&gt; So during that time, we can see in Matthew 26, Pilate said unto them, you have a watch, go your way. Make it as sure as ye can. Woo! Stupid devil. &gt;&gt; So they went and made the seulture sure, sealing the stone and setting a watch. They couldn't seal it enough. &gt;&gt; God is almighty and he will always break the seal to prove his resurrection. My God is awesome, &gt;&gt; mighty in battle. &gt;&gt; Woo! &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Matthew 28:2. We're building up here now. &gt;&gt; Matthew 28:2. And behold, there was a great earthquake, for the angel of the Lord descended. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:1. And another mighty angel descended. &gt;&gt; Glory. Another man, an angel from the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it. &gt;&gt; Woo! Come on, church. My God is almighty. &gt;&gt; What Rome, what Satan has sealed, God just sits on it. Satan tries to keep you bound, but Jesus set me free. Satan tries to keep you down. But Satan is finished because Jesus proclaimed me free. Glory. Glory. Boo devil. Start claiming your possession. He's but a bluff. Brother David, I heard it before. It's not I heard it before. This is the trumpet sounding telling you this is the bride's jubilee. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The resurrection message. The rapture message has an effect on all the surroundings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was an earthquake. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that those guardians, those soldiers, they were like dead. &gt;&gt; They were there was a real trembling taking place. &gt;&gt; They ended up dead. Satan couldn't stop the angel from coming down &gt;&gt; and opening that seal. &gt;&gt; And he couldn't stop the angel from coming down to open the seals for us. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory. Satan. He Oh, we better kick him out of here. [Applause] Come on, church. &gt;&gt; The Jubilee. We know the story. They climbed up the mountain. So, let's just think about it. &gt;&gt; Think about it. You came here and tonight you going. If the trumpet sounds, you will be free. &gt;&gt; They send out the young, you know, trained people &gt;&gt; like brother Michael who can run fast. Go on, Michael. Go there. &gt;&gt; And when the sun rises, &gt;&gt; just tell us &gt;&gt; because I know somebody who went up Mount Calvary, Mount Golgatha, &gt;&gt; and he proclaimed my freedom. He told me, I am free. So I know in whom I believe now. What's the opening of the seals revealing Christ? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come on. A few more bombs here. &gt;&gt; The opening of the seal &gt;&gt; was wasn't broke to let Jesus out. &gt;&gt; You get that? The opening of the seal wasn't there to let Jesus out. Because Jesus, he can walk through walls. He can walk through the rock. &gt;&gt; It was there for them to go in. &gt;&gt; Woo! Only in Christ Jesus I am secure. I am safe. &gt;&gt; That's why the book is open and you have to go get the book. Eat the book and see who you are. Oh my Lord. Hallelujah. Talking about the Jubilee. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here comes these women questioning. But their questions were already answered before they arrived. Their questions were answered by the message, the rapture message, the resurrection message. Amen. All doubts were settled. &gt;&gt; Woo! My the opening of the word. Oh, settled all my questions. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There is no other light. There is no other life than in this message, in this word. &gt;&gt; This message gives us perfect faith. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He who the son has set free is free indeed. Not partially free indeed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the angel Matthew 28:5 And the angel answered and said unto the woman, "Fear ye not." &gt;&gt; For I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified, &gt;&gt; but he is not here. He is risen. &gt;&gt; As he said, &gt;&gt; as he said, it is written, thus saith the Lord. Woo! My Come see the place where the Lord lay. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; Did they see a dead corpse? No, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; He is risen. We are not serving a dead God. God is alive. &gt;&gt; He's almighty. &gt;&gt; We're not feeding on a dead word, but the unfailing of the body word of the Son of Man. Some people may think this message is a dead word. No, no, no, no. This is a word from God Almighty sent in this end of the last age &gt;&gt; for me, for you. &gt;&gt; So the bride's jubilee, that's why it's the bride's jubilee is a reality. &gt;&gt; What are you rejoicing about? Yes. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; You don't know what you're rejoicing about. Brother Bram says, "What a resurrection this was." &gt;&gt; What a resurrection this is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; The angel tells him, "Come see for yourself. I want you to be a witness &gt;&gt; of the resurrection power. My my my my &gt;&gt; Jesus was come later. He came to the disciples in the room through a stone wall. &gt;&gt; You want to talk? He says he had his glorified body says the prophet. You talk about the space age. The church is fixing to take one fast. &gt;&gt; Now there are some people that take that personal and they takes up so much space. My ministry I I I that's not what it's saying. [Music] &gt;&gt; What does the Bible say in John 3? He must increase but I must decrease. It's not what I've done, it's what he has done for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; He proclaimed my liberty. &gt;&gt; We we we had the quotes. I thought Amen. It's not you have to pay. It's not I have to do this. It's what he has done for me. &gt;&gt; By grace I am saved. &gt;&gt; He loved me before I even could love him. &gt;&gt; He chose me. &gt;&gt; He elected me &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. my &gt;&gt; then they have done what they said they would do to Jesus. They crucified him. His soul descended into hell. Preach to the souls that are in prison. He took the keys of death, hell away from the devil. &gt;&gt; Satan wants you to believe that these prisons doors are still locked. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he doesn't has the keys anymore. &gt;&gt; But it's up, you know, the ministers can preach it, &gt;&gt; but it's up to you to take a step of faith. &gt;&gt; It doesn't need, it's not a huge door where you need all the power and you know, let's go. &gt;&gt; He just opened &gt;&gt; faith like a mustard seed &gt;&gt; because the door's already open. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen now. I love it. I love it. &gt;&gt; He has taken the keys of debt and hell away from the devil. Return back on Easter morning. And as he come through paradise, he knocks at the door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah says the prophet. &gt;&gt; I can hear him say, "Children, Abraham say, who is that? I'm your seed." The seed of Abraham. Abraham said, "Are we going out? It's almost daylight on earth. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord my God. And somebody can ask me, well, how are you going to be raptured? Don't you worry about that. Enoch was walking. He pleased God because he believed the word of God and he started walking. He started walking. Bye-bye world. Bye-bye world. Don't ask me to explain the physics &gt;&gt; because I don't care about the physics. I know God said so and I believe it. &gt;&gt; My my my come on. &gt;&gt; Abraham, are we going out? It's almost daylight on Earth. &gt;&gt; Abraham says, &gt;&gt; Jesus, can we make a little whistle stop? Woo. [Laughter] Can we make a little whistle stop in Jerusalem? &gt;&gt; Listen now. The reply of Jesus. Yes, I got 40 days. I want to instruct my disciples. They got to go in the world and cast out devils. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus, we cast out devils. &gt;&gt; So, we're not we shouldn't fear them because God gave us this authority. &gt;&gt; And Jesus says, "Let me go to them. I'm going to instruct them for 40 days to cast out devils. It didn't end with the disciples at that time. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I better talk to him a little while before going up so you fellows can just walk around. &gt;&gt; My We going to live. We're so close. Amen. To living a time, Amen. where our beloved ones will come die. Hey, we're going to be preaching. Here's brother Brandham. My You want to talk about a revival? You want to talk about the Jubilee? Oh, Brother David, I hear now the critics say, "Brother David, I'll wait until You know what? You won't see them. &gt;&gt; You won't see them because it's only the elect. It's only the bride that will see them. Oh my." &gt;&gt; If you've never shouted before, &gt;&gt; you're going to shout. Amen. &gt;&gt; My hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When because I live ye shall live also. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says he was speaking to his wife. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; my. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. When he died. Amen. And he shed his blood. Listen. The perfect life of God was liberated. The perfect life of God was liberated to come back upon the sinner who would accept the Christ as his savior. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; So how are we responding &gt;&gt; to the Jubilee trumpet &gt;&gt; to the freedom trumpet? &gt;&gt; All that God was, he emptied in Christ. All the great eternals of God was emptied in Christ. And all that Christ was, he emptied it into the church. &gt;&gt; And men and women are afraid to claim their God-given privilege and stand upon the truth of it. Not what you think, not what Satan says, not what anybody says, but what the truth, what the word of God says about you. We have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God has given us. &gt;&gt; My [Music] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have the right to force these claims upon Satan &gt;&gt; and say, "Give it back. [Applause] I heard the trumpet sound. This is my inheritance. This is my property. Get the behind me. Some of you were at camp and some of you have written something on the soul because that's where Satan belongs. But it's about time maybe you rewrite something and start putting Satan under your feet. Well, brother David, I wasn't at camp. Don't you worry. You got your time now. This is the hour of jubilee. &gt;&gt; This is the hour of jubilee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Give it back. And he has to do it. &gt;&gt; He has to do it. That's say the Lord. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if that ain't enough, &gt;&gt; we can take God's agent, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; go route down, right down on our knees and say it's thus sayeth the Lord, he's got to give up. That's all. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's all. Cuz the Holy Spirit is there to make him do it. &gt;&gt; This ain't your battle. &gt;&gt; He proclaimed me free. &gt;&gt; He gave me an open book. &gt;&gt; He broke the seals thereof. Therefore, my jubilee. I can rejoice. I can be glad. Worthy is the lamb. He alone is worthy. [Applause] Why are you so excited? Because I'm living in a jubilee. &gt;&gt; I'm living my jubilee. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And it's a reality. &gt;&gt; This book of Acts is a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. You heard testimony. Testimony. Not just a brother Tims, not just a brother arms, not just a brother Tom's. &gt;&gt; All over the world, the spirit is moving. Woo! Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the enforcement restored back to its natural condition again. &gt;&gt; It's not our claim. It's our claim because God gave it. &gt;&gt; By his stripes, we are healed. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. [Applause] I prayed and it didn't happen and &gt;&gt; there's this poor me attitude. &gt;&gt; Joshua went there with a victorious attitude. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knew in who he believed. &gt;&gt; And I'll send my angel before thee. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was wounded for our transgressions. By his stripes, we are healed. &gt;&gt; And the lawgiver, the Holy Spirit himself, listen, the lawgiver, not Satan, &gt;&gt; that's the nonsense giver, &gt;&gt; the liar giver. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's what he is. That's his nature. &gt;&gt; He can seem very honest. &gt;&gt; Very truthful. &gt;&gt; Quote 99.9% of the truth, &gt;&gt; but he's still a liar. &gt;&gt; He's still a liar. But here the lawgiver, the Holy Spirit himself is here, the agent of God to see that it's done that way. Amen. &gt;&gt; My You want to talk about a jubilee? &gt;&gt; That's a true jubilee. &gt;&gt; Because when this trumpet was sound when it They put down everything. &gt;&gt; If you wanted to be free, &gt;&gt; you could continue &gt;&gt; and keep on &gt;&gt; slave master. &gt;&gt; But it's up to you, &gt;&gt; each and everyone. &gt;&gt; So I don't want to look to my mom, look to my dad, look to my brother, look to my sister. It's me, myself and I. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To take a step &gt;&gt; and say, "This is my jubilee. &gt;&gt; This is my liberty. &gt;&gt; This is my freedom." &gt;&gt; He whom the son has set free is free indeed. And he, oh my, &gt;&gt; I'm &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says once once he was freed, he could never be a slave no more. Hallelujah. You never have to live under the yoke of bondage. My God has set me free. [Applause] Therefore, it's not an excitement. Oh yeah, I can act excited, but it's a reality. The Jubilee of the bride is a reality. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've got the authority by Jesus Christ. That's the reason demons scream. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; We are. That's the reason demons scream. &gt;&gt; It's about time we give them &gt;&gt; a good whapon. &gt;&gt; Enough is enough. &gt;&gt; Satan had me bound, &gt;&gt; but Jesus set me free. Oh, brother David, that's not a deep message. Oh, yes it is. &gt;&gt; Because Satan tries to keep you bound. Satan tries to keep you in bondage. &gt;&gt; Try to do everything &gt;&gt; to stop you from praising, worshiping God, receiving the word, receiving the blessing. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? A few more minutes. &gt;&gt; My Lord. Romans 8, who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? &gt;&gt; It is God that justifieth. &gt;&gt; The Greek lexican says it's pronounced dao. Sorry, my pronunciation. To render righteous, to declare one as he ought to be. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a son of God. [Applause] I no longer &gt;&gt; ought to live here in bondage. &gt;&gt; I am a son and a daughter of God. Now I am [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me bring it more personal now. You believe him to be the same, &gt;&gt; to be the same in principle, &gt;&gt; to be the same in power. &gt;&gt; The only thing different tonight is that he's using your flesh and my flesh. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Joshua saw the same walls you see in your life. But he sto he took a step of faith. [Music] &gt;&gt; God used Joshua. &gt;&gt; God used Abraham. But now he's using your flesh and my flesh. In my name, the name of Jesus. They shall cast out demons. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Let me take a little whistle stop, said God. Let me take a little whistle stop here at Bible Way Cloverdale. There's your anniversary going on. And I'm going to tell them I'm going to tell them that they are free indeed. That I I sound the Jubilee trumpet. And you are here to cast out demons in Jesus' name. In Jesus' name, we press on in Jesus' name. We have the victory. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Worship the Lord Almighty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Take possession. &gt;&gt; Take possession, &gt;&gt; full possession of what is yours. If you need healing, he is the same. The same power. Oh my Lord. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; You want your family restored? He's the same. Jesus just needed a whistle stop. &gt;&gt; I'll tell them &gt;&gt; you'll cast out demons. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Don't rely on your strength. Don't rely on any theological knowledge. Just surrender to God and say, "Here I am. Here I am. Thy will be done. Thy will be done. Fill me Lord. Fill me Lord. Break every feather. Break every feather. I can hear the Jubilee trumpet sound. I can hear it. I am free indeed. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what it's about. &gt;&gt; Being free. &gt;&gt; Free indeed. free indeed. &gt;&gt; Musicians. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; He's here, but it's up to you now to claim your liberty. We can sing about it, but it's more than sing about it. I know in who I believe. Brother David doesn't know your needs, &gt;&gt; but the great I am is here. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what you have need of. &gt;&gt; And is anything too hard for the Lord? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Brother David, I heard that before. &gt;&gt; Stop listening to the nonsense of Satan. if you can only believe. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God has plans for you. &gt;&gt; Maybe you came questioning here, &gt;&gt; having all all kinds of mind battles. Maybe this is the first time you're in church &gt;&gt; and maybe this is the first time you're connected. &gt;&gt; God has other plans for you. &gt;&gt; The answer is in the rapture message. &gt;&gt; Because I live, &gt;&gt; ye shall live also. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; I'm no longer a slave to fear. &gt;&gt; I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; This is an anniversary. The Lord is directing differently, saints. But he knows what you need. So, let's not miss the moment. That's not just an anniversary. &gt;&gt; It's the bride's jubilee. &gt;&gt; This is the bride's jubilee and it's a reality. &gt;&gt; So, claim your God-given rights. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is here. The lawgiver, the Holy Spirit. [Music] to change every situation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; To take away all doubt, all fear. Cuz I don't need to live any longer in the fear. God proclaimed me free. He paid my price. And I want to be a witness of the resurrection message. &gt;&gt; It's not me that lived, but Christ that liveth in me. &gt;&gt; And it's more than just a word we speak out. It's a power, &gt;&gt; a resurrection power. But it has to be an individual testimony. &gt;&gt; So don't miss your opportunity. I'd sing that song. I'm no longer a slave to fear.

They need to change those words. And they didn't do it. Known from my mother's womb. I've been known before the foundation of the world. Didn't I say from my father's mind? Come on, put it up. Change it. Joseph, we we didn't just start and find out salvation. We were always saved. &gt;&gt; It was just the night you gave your heart to Christ that you knew you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You never had just got eternal life. What the prophet say? You always had it. If you can't rejoice over this message tonight, you're brain dead. You might as well rejoice because our father is alive and well.

It's about time we start to let the devil know, I've come from God. got to go back to God and Satan, you get behind me. You talk about a jubilee. How many tonight can say by the word of God, by the word of God, it washed me. It cleansed me. It loosed me. It set me free. Not by some excitement, but by thus sayeth the word of God. If it's by emotion, it will leave tomorrow. It will leave next week. But if it's a revelation, it will stay with you forever and ever and ever. So when the devil comes by your way and say, "Remember that hole you had?" You said, "Yeah, I left it at the Jubilee service never to pick it up again." Arise. Arise. possess your inheritance.
