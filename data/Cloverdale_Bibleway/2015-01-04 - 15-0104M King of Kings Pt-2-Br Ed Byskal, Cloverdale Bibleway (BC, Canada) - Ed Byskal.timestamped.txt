[16:00] Blessed be your name, Lord. Amen. I'm
[16:02] going to ask our brother Tim God if he
[16:04] would come open the service for us in a
[16:06] word of prayer.
[16:08] Amen. We do have a testimony from the
[16:10] Snow family. They wanted to let be known
[16:13] before you. So we wanted to return
[16:15] thanks to the Lord for his mercies and
[16:17] all who prayed for Ryan. He had
[16:19] developed cysts on his back and in his
[16:21] chest. And the doctors had ordered tests
[16:23] to be performed. A couple of weeks ago,
[16:25] we came up for prayer and after all the
[16:27] tests, the report came back and all is
[16:28] normal and the cysts have already begun
[16:30] to disappear. All praise to him. Thank
[16:32] you, Lord.
[16:34] Hallelujah.
[16:37] Amen.
[16:40] And also my family. Just wanted to
[16:42] extend a warm heartfelt thanks to all
[16:44] the phone calls and emails and texts and
[16:47] cards and everything that we've just
[16:49] received over the past weeks. We're
[16:50] truly so appreciative for all the giving
[16:54] and all the prayers. You've been
[16:56] remembering us through this time. We
[16:57] just wanted you to know that even if we
[16:59] haven't been able to respond to each one
[17:00] that we deeply appreciate it and we love
[17:02] you and we're very thankful be a part of
[17:04] the family of God. Amen. Brother Tim,
[17:07] why don't you come?
[17:13] Amen. Isn't the Lord good to us?
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're looking forward to 2015.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Just think of the mighty things God has
[17:21] done this last year. How much greater is
[17:24] this coming year going to be?
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I was spoken speaking with
[17:27] brother Sam Ray just before the service
[17:29] and and he and sister Rebecca uh would
[17:33] like to thank the Lord for answered
[17:34] prayer after watch night. Uh they
[17:37] brought uh young Jack up. He had been
[17:39] troubled four nights in a row not being
[17:42] able to sleep all night. And so you can
[17:45] well imagine what that does to a young
[17:48] child. And they brought him up to up for
[17:51] prayer. We prayed with them and they
[17:53] just want to know want everyone to know
[17:56] the Lord has touched him and he has
[17:58] slept wonderfully since that time.
[18:01] Our God is a mighty healer and a mighty
[18:03] deliverer. I wonder if you have a need
[18:06] this morning, why don't you just raise
[18:07] your hand to him? And I'm sure he sees
[18:10] everyone individually.
[18:12] Heavenly Father,
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are so thankful to serve a
[18:17] living God,
[18:19] &gt;&gt; not a God of history. Not a God who
[18:21] said, "I am the I was," but he said, "I
[18:23] am the I am."
[18:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, the very present God. You're a
[18:28] very present help. You are our healer,
[18:31] our physician. Lord, you are our very
[18:34] help in a time of trouble. Lord, you're
[18:37] the one that delivers us from all our
[18:39] situations. You are our salvation.
[18:42] You're our joy. You're our hope. You are
[18:44] our peace, our rest, oh God. In you do
[18:47] we put our trust. And Lord, we just come
[18:50] confessing at the beginning of another
[18:52] year, even as we made the transition on
[18:55] watch night, we are in such expectation
[18:58] every service, oh God. Lord, we are
[19:00] looking forward to every meeting with
[19:02] you. We're looking forward to great
[19:04] things that you shall do. And Lord, we
[19:07] thank you this morning that we could
[19:09] gather together in your presence.
[19:12] Lord, you're here because you said in
[19:14] your word that wherever two or three are
[19:16] gathered in your name, you are here in
[19:19] the midst of them, you keep your word.
[19:22] And we believe that with all of our
[19:24] hearts. And you see these requests
[19:26] represented by the hands that are
[19:28] raised. Lord, may you come as you are a
[19:32] personal God to each and every
[19:34] individual circumstance.
[19:37] Lord, deliver and heal and touch and
[19:40] meet needs and give the desires of their
[19:42] heart, Lord. Oh, Father, we thank you
[19:46] the way that you deal with us and that
[19:48] you know our need better than we know it
[19:50] ourselves.
[19:51] You know the right answer, Lord. And so
[19:54] we pray not our will but your will be
[19:56] done. We ask Lord this morning as
[19:59] brother Bisll would come behind the
[20:01] sacred desk Lord may you anoint him
[20:03] Aresh. We're so looking forward to
[20:06] because we love your word.
[20:09] We love your servant.
[20:11] We appreciate your love gifts to the
[20:13] body, Lord. And we ask once again that
[20:16] you'll minister through your servant
[20:18] this morning. Bless the song service.
[20:21] And Lord, even as we offer up this
[20:23] offering this morning, as the ushers,
[20:25] the deacons are ready to take the
[20:27] offering, we do it as unto you, Lord.
[20:31] Not as unto a man or a church or or or
[20:34] just some kind of earthly kingdom, but
[20:37] Lord, you've blessed us. And we want,
[20:39] Lord, that you would accept our
[20:40] offerings as we lift it unto you as may
[20:43] it be pleasing in your sight. We commit
[20:46] ourselves, this service, all things into
[20:48] your hands in the wonderful name of
[20:50] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:56] [Music]
[21:02] Amen. God bless you. Have your seats.
[21:06] Amen. Maybe if brother Eba could come,
[21:10] he's going to sing a special for us. As
[21:12] he comes, why don't we sing the same God
[21:15] that spoke to the woman at the well.
[21:17] It's the same God that's living in me.
[21:18] This came in my mind as brother Tim was
[21:20] praying.
[21:21] Amen. Let's sing the first verse. Oh, I
[21:24] look back
[21:26] on history.
[21:28] I see a mighty God,
[21:33] proving
[21:35] over and over that his word has never
[21:40] failed.
[21:42] But I can't keep on dwelling on the past
[21:47] memory.
[21:49] [Music]
[21:52] Cuz he's the same God who's living in
[21:57] me.
[21:59] Oh, I ask the same God
[22:03] who spoke to the woman at the well.
[22:09] is the same God
[22:11] who wonders
[22:13] too many to tell.
[22:17] The same God
[22:22] raing.
[22:27] He's the same God.
[22:57] [Music]
[23:15] Somewhere
[23:18] just across
[23:20] the Jordan
[23:22] River.
[23:27] He's a place of everlasting
[23:32] joy and peace.
[23:39] We the tree of life is blooming there
[23:45] forever.
[23:49] And a crown of life is waiting there for
[23:56] me.
[23:59] That sounds like home to me.
[24:04] Cuz where I
[24:07] always want to be, there'll be no tears
[24:13] that will dim my eyes
[24:16] again.
[24:19] The hills will go with the story as we
[24:25] sing
[24:27] his love and glory.
[24:29] Where the saints of God will be
[24:34] that sounds
[24:37] like home
[24:39] to me.
[24:43] The sus
[24:45] manion dear inside that city.
[24:50] [Music]
[24:52] A crystal river flowing by the tree of
[24:57] life.
[25:01] No pain, no disappointment
[25:05] will have a hot horse.
[25:11] And Jesus Christ himself will be the
[25:16] light.
[25:18] That sounds like home to me.
[25:23] That's where I always want to be.
[25:27] There'll be no tears
[25:30] that will dim my eyes
[25:33] again.
[25:37] The hills were going
[25:39] the story as we see
[25:43] his grace and glory
[25:45] where the saints of God will be
[25:50] that sound
[25:52] like home
[25:54] to me.
[25:56] [Music]
[26:18] That sounds like home to me.
[26:23] That's where I always want to be.
[26:27] There'll be no fears
[26:30] that will deep our eyes again.
[26:35] Though he will know it, the story has
[26:40] seen
[26:42] his grace and glory where the saints of
[26:46] God will be.
[26:48] That sounds
[26:50] like home
[26:53] to me.
[26:55] [Music]
[27:00] [Applause]
[27:17] Good morning. God bless you.
[27:21] Well, it's wonderful to be in the house
[27:22] of God on a snowy, cold, wintry day.
[27:26] To be where the sun is shining,
[27:28] &gt;&gt; where the warmth of God's presence is
[27:30] amongst us. We're thankful that we have
[27:32] a place that we can run into and are
[27:34] safe. This morning, we have a baby
[27:36] dedication. Sister Melissa and Dave
[27:39] Monley have their daughter to be
[27:41] dedicated this morning. So, why don't we
[27:43] have Sister Melissa come with her family
[27:48] and sing my favorite song?
[27:51] Jesus loves me, this I know.
[27:58] Jesus
[27:59] loves
[28:01] this I know.
[28:05] For the Bible
[28:07] tells me so.
[28:10] Little ones.
[28:13] To him belong.
[28:16] They are weak. But he is strong.
[28:22] Yes.
[28:24] Jesus loves me.
[28:28] Yes. Jesus loves me.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:35] Jesus loves me.
[28:38] The body
[28:41] tells me so.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Well, standing here this morning, Sister
[28:47] Melissa, who I have known since a little
[28:49] girl, and now she's grown up to be a
[28:52] mother, a lovely young lady, and
[28:55] cradling in her arms is a a little
[28:57] darling, and it's Deanna Grace Molley.
[29:02] And um I just want to read a scripture
[29:05] that is I believe fitting sister Melissa
[29:09] because we have to see ourselves in the
[29:11] Bible and the Bible is the most
[29:13] important thing to us. That's what we
[29:14] live for.
[29:16] And there was a woman in a scripture
[29:18] that uh Jesus talks about and Matthew
[29:21] writes about in Matthew 15 and 22 and
[29:25] said that there was a woman of Canaan
[29:27] that came out of the coast and cried
[29:29] unto him saying have mercy on me, oh
[29:33] Lord, thou son of David, my daughter is
[29:36] grievously vexed.
[29:39] And I thought the love of a mother. What
[29:41] will a love of a mother do? And I looked
[29:45] up of course to the message what the
[29:47] prophet said. The love of a mother who
[29:50] mother is the fifth gospel is one of the
[29:53] strongest force there are.
[29:56] And this woman was willing to to go
[29:59] against all that they said against
[30:02] Jesus. All the religious people were
[30:05] calling him nasty things. But she
[30:08] realized the answer for her daughter was
[30:11] Jesus.
[30:12] And even the disciples gave her a
[30:14] problem and said, "Lord, send her away.
[30:17] Send her away." And yet her faith looked
[30:22] to the lamb of God, knowing that he was
[30:25] the answer
[30:27] for her daughter.
[30:29] And she was persistent until finally she
[30:32] got to the master. And even the Lord
[30:35] then said, you know, is it meat that the
[30:38] that I give the children's bread to
[30:41] dogs? And she was a Canaanite. She was a
[30:44] Sarapheneician. She was somebody that
[30:46] was not even in the kingdom of God. And
[30:49] she said, "Yay, Lord." And the humility
[30:52] that she had, Sister Melissa, your
[30:54] humility, she said, "Even, yay, Lord,
[30:57] even the dogs will eat the crumb from
[30:59] the master's table."
[31:02] And that humility turned the heart of
[31:04] God. The love of a mother turned the
[31:06] heart of God that God delivered that
[31:08] little girl that moment. And I thought,
[31:11] well, here's this little jewel that God
[31:13] has given this Moly family. And how a
[31:16] mother now, she knows that the world
[31:18] doesn't have the answers. The world will
[31:20] tear her apart. She'll be grievously
[31:23] vexed. But she knows there's one thing
[31:25] that could help this little girl, and
[31:27] that's Jesus. Jesus Christ the living
[31:31] word.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this little jewel is called
[31:35] Deanna Grace Molley which means divine.
[31:42] Her middle name grace
[31:45] divine grace. And I believe sister
[31:48] Melissa that I don't know how you and
[31:50] Dave came to the conclusion to name your
[31:53] daughter that. But it doesn't matter
[31:55] where you go through the scriptures.
[31:57] Wherever God met somebody, they gave a
[31:59] special name to that place. And God met
[32:02] this our dear sister Melissa one day at
[32:06] church, God kindled, rekindled her
[32:09] heart. And there was a special name that
[32:11] came at that time, divine grace. And
[32:15] thus, we have this little darling this
[32:17] morning that we want to dedicate to the
[32:19] Lord. We don't baptize babies because
[32:21] the Bible says repent and be baptized.
[32:24] We dedicate our children to the Lord
[32:26] that God would receive them back from
[32:30] the very one who gave us this child. We
[32:32] ask God would you take care of this
[32:34] child and watch over divine grace Deanna
[32:38] Grace Moly. Amen.
[32:52] Let's pray.
[32:56] Precious Lord,
[32:59] in my arms this morning is a gift of God
[33:02] that you have given Sister Melissa and
[33:05] Dave Moly. Lord Deanna Grace, divine
[33:09] grace.
[33:11] Would your hand be upon her, Lord? Would
[33:14] you always put a wall of fire around
[33:16] her? Keep her from all harm and
[33:18] sickness. And Lord Jesus, as this little
[33:21] woman in the scriptures found that Jesus
[33:24] was the answer,
[33:26] Lord, sister Melissa has found that
[33:28] Jesus is the answer.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; And God sovereign grace stepped on the
[33:34] scene and you've given them thus this
[33:36] darling girl. I just pray that Lord that
[33:39] your hand of blessing be upon her. May
[33:42] the grace of God ever go before her. And
[33:45] Father, as the name indicates, one who
[33:47] is like God. May she reflect your glory
[33:51] and your grace at a young age. Bless
[33:54] this little darling, Lord, as we
[33:56] dedicate her to you this morning. And
[33:59] may your Holy Spirit shine upon her and
[34:03] may the love of God overshadow her in
[34:06] Jesus name. We give her to you for the
[34:09] glory of God. Amen.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Maybe I should have had girls. I only
[34:16] had boys.
[34:24] Amen. God bless you all this morning.
[34:36] Amen. We're going to invite our pastor
[34:38] to come. Why don't we sing Blessed
[34:40] Assurance, Jesus is mine.

[38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you all this
[38:43] morning.
[38:44] Are you having a happy eternity?
[38:48] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[38:50] Uh, I wanted to give you greetings. I
[38:53] must give you greetings which just
[38:55] arrived yesterday from brother Garrett
[38:57] Rodal in Germany and uh they have the
[39:00] church there just in Basillesburg.
[39:04] Been there a long time. have a wonderful
[39:07] church and he wanted to send his
[39:09] greetings to you. Also, there was
[39:12] greetings from uh brother Yenko
[39:16] uh in Serbia and he had a phrase in his
[39:20] his email that I just thought you all
[39:24] need to hear.
[39:26] He said, "Your fellowship is like a
[39:30] beehive
[39:32] full of honey from the field. If someone
[39:35] comes to steal it away, when they come
[39:37] back, there's only more.
[39:42] So, I thought to all of you bees that
[39:45] are bringing honey,
[39:47] that's what someone out there is
[39:50] receiving.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; It just seems like a beehive
[39:54] full of honey. I thought that was so
[39:57] sweet and so wonderful. We also want to
[40:00] be remembering uh uh brother Tom and
[40:03] brother Murphy going to be going to
[40:06] China uh first part of February and be
[40:11] having a number of meetings there but
[40:14] also one of the
[40:17] one of the main objectives which I I
[40:20] trust we'll be able to achieve and that
[40:22] is that we'll be meeting with different
[40:25] pastors and having pastors ministers
[40:27] meetings
[40:28] as well as other uh meetings. But we
[40:32] have the Bible Bibles for China. The
[40:35] Bible translation is complete ready. Uh
[40:39] now uh thanks to brother Darren and his
[40:43] uh
[40:45] work. I don't want to even call it work
[40:47] or endeavor. It's just a a mission to
[40:51] write a program so that it can be
[40:54] searched. The Bible can be searched in
[40:57] any language and but we're going to have
[41:01] the Bible printed, the new translation
[41:04] printed. So, it's two things. One is a
[41:06] Bible reader and the other is the Bible
[41:08] itself.
[41:09] And there's a lot of uh a lot of
[41:12] decisions that need to be made with
[41:14] regards to the Bible printing itself. Uh
[41:17] whether in a hard cover or some in a
[41:19] hard cover, some in a soft cover, a
[41:21] leather cover. Um, and the Bible will be
[41:25] for all all people, all Christians as a
[41:30] whole.
[41:31] And uh, it it it's a just a tremendous
[41:34] thing for me to stand here. I feel so
[41:37] humbled to think that God allows us and
[41:42] allows people that God has sent here. We
[41:46] didn't know brother Murphy, Sister
[41:48] Tracy. Uh we didn't know many of the
[41:52] people that are here now. Uh we didn't
[41:55] know that that would be an open door for
[41:58] China. Uh a nation that I don't think
[42:01] the prophet of God was able to actually
[42:04] visit and and yet it seems that there's
[42:08] something left for us to do. And I think
[42:10] it's wonderful.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; And then to see what is happening within
[42:14] uh uh Africa
[42:17] uh and the many many churches that are
[42:21] rising up even though we know and we
[42:25] believe that the scripture is true. When
[42:29] he returns shall he find faith on the
[42:31] earth? And the prophet of God comes and
[42:34] tells us. He said, "I can tell you one
[42:35] thing. It will be very, very few." So,
[42:38] I'm glad that we can be one of the few.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've heard the word.
[42:44] Also, we're going to be in prayer for
[42:46] and with our brother Timothy Ono.
[42:50] Uh he is leaving this next week to go
[42:53] back to Johannesburg for a season. And
[42:58] uh what we're praying for, you said,
[42:59] "Well, what should we pray for?" Pray
[43:02] that the season will be very short.
[43:07] And so will you pray for that?
[43:10] &gt;&gt; You join with me and pray that the
[43:11] season will be very very short. I know
[43:14] that his family will be praying for it.
[43:16] But that we are his family.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; And we dearly love our brother Timothy
[43:23] and uh pray that he we will see him very
[43:26] soon.
[43:29] All right.
[43:32] Now, uh,
[43:35] one place,
[43:37] Brother Brennham said, "You know why I'm
[43:39] stalling?" And I guess I'm stalling,
[43:42] too. We bit. We just want to have the
[43:46] right moment and the right atmosphere
[43:49] for the service this morning. I have I
[43:53] want to carry on from last week uh
[43:56] speaking on the King of Kings.
[43:59] And I would like to say a couple things.
[44:02] You know, you you stand here and this is
[44:04] the format of a church and a preacher
[44:07] and a service and the ministry and so on
[44:09] so forth. But uh we are not here to gain
[44:13] some information.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; And we're not here just to gain some
[44:17] spiritual knowledge.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; But there comes a time when there must
[44:21] be implementation.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; One is where we gain or we may rejoice
[44:26] or we may be happy. We may have a
[44:29] service like the watch night service,
[44:31] but one of the hardest things is
[44:34] implementation.
[44:37] I'm sure that there's a number of people
[44:39] here where you've read all kinds of
[44:42] things about diets.
[44:45] Implementation is
[44:47] difficult.
[44:49] My wife reminds me uh that the treadmill
[44:54] upstairs is rusting out
[44:57] and uh there's
[45:00] uh there's nothing wrong with the
[45:01] equipment and there's nothing wrong
[45:03] really with me but it's just for me to
[45:06] get upstairs and the implementation part
[45:09] is very difficult.
[45:14] Now, some of you folks look so
[45:15] sanctimonious like you never you've
[45:18] never run into that. No, I know better.
[45:21] Implementation is is tough. So, now I'm
[45:25] preaching this morning for the purpose
[45:27] of implementation.
[45:29] And so, we know that that is u more more
[45:33] challenging, shall we put it that way. I
[45:36] wonder if you would uh stand with me and
[45:38] I I would like to sing one uh just a
[45:41] course of uh verse maybe in a course of
[45:44] redeemed. Redeemed how I love to
[45:46] proclaim it. Uh
[45:49] I'm sorry I didn't get the number.
[45:52] [Music]
[45:54] Redeemed how I love to proclaim it. And
[45:56] I'd like you to make the declaration
[46:00] when we come to that course. Redeemed
[46:02] redeemed. redeemed by the blood of the
[46:05] lamb. Amen.
[46:07] [Music]
[46:12] Love to proclaim
[46:15] redeemed
[46:18] [Applause]
[46:18] [Music]
[46:20] through his
[46:22] mercy.
[46:24] His power forever. I am
[46:29] redeeing
[46:31] [Music]
[46:35] my blood of the lamb.
[46:39] Redee
[46:41] [Music]
[46:47] is forever. I am the first I know I
[46:53] shall see his beauty
[46:57] but he is my delight.
[47:02] You died in my footsteps
[47:07] and given me songs in the night.
[47:11] [Music]
[47:29] his child forever.
[47:33] [Music]
[47:35] &gt;&gt; And everyone could say, "Praise the
[47:36] Lord."
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be reading in
[47:41] Ephesians the 6th chapter
[47:46] and we'll read from verses 11-1 17.
[47:52] Before we read, I would like to say
[47:54] because
[47:55] uh we will be uh merging with the
[48:00] service from last week and we spoke of
[48:04] Joshua
[48:05] and the he he numbers the kings, names
[48:10] the kings and cities, many of them uh
[48:13] and I will be referring to that. But I
[48:16] want to make the statement and have it
[48:18] very emphatically understood that what
[48:21] was physical in the Old Testament is now
[48:24] spiritual.
[48:26] And and as we speak of uh Joshua, Joshua
[48:32] simply means Jehovah Savior. And so when
[48:36] Joshua
[48:38] was preparing, now here's the setting. I
[48:41] went home a couple weeks ago and I was
[48:44] thinking or a week ago, I was thinking,
[48:47] how did he prepare for these incredible
[48:50] battles that he had? And he he was
[48:54] absolutely ruthless and how does that
[48:57] how does that apply to us and how do we
[49:01] implement it? And uh
[49:05] then I immediately thought of Jesus
[49:09] because Jesus
[49:11] Joshua savior Jesus was the savior
[49:15] and Joshua prepared and he prepared the
[49:17] pe people and went to into incredible
[49:20] battles. Now that's either just a story
[49:23] with no meaning to us or it has a direct
[49:27] meaning to us and we we we may if we
[49:32] don't grasp it, if we don't catch it, we
[49:34] won't have this victory that he enjoyed.
[49:37] And if he is giving the people their
[49:39] inheritance, we're the people and we're
[49:43] the people with the inheritance. And so
[49:45] how does that apply to us? So I got
[49:48] thinking how did Jesus
[49:51] coming to the battle of the ages, the
[49:54] struggle of the ages, the battle of the
[49:57] ages when he was coming to Calvary. And
[50:00] I was pondering just to myself for
[50:03] several days, how did he prepare himself
[50:07] to come to this incredible battle where
[50:10] he would actually crush the head of the
[50:13] serpent and fulfill the prophecy, the
[50:18] first prophecy that was ever given,
[50:20] which was given by God himself, that the
[50:23] seed of the woman would bruise the
[50:25] serpent's head. And here he's coming to
[50:28] that battle of the ages and the victory
[50:30] of the ages
[50:32] &gt;&gt; and how is he preparing to do that
[50:36] and uh I will come to that and that will
[50:40] have to be our example but Jesus was
[50:43] preparing now and he he wouldn't be uh
[50:50] he wouldn't be protect uh guarding
[50:52] himself with the sword and shield and
[50:54] those things, but yet it had a spiritual
[50:58] application. I'm going to try to make it
[51:00] very very clear and expect that the
[51:03] congregation will be able to take
[51:06] something home that will make life
[51:09] different. That's what I actually pray
[51:11] for. And implementation is very very
[51:14] awkward and very hard. But we need to
[51:16] implement some things.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; I believe that be pray. You know, we're
[51:21] talking about the rapture and the coming
[51:23] of Christ and the fulfillment of the
[51:25] scripture. And I believe that uh it
[51:29] takes some doing and and not that it's
[51:32] works, but it just takes a different a
[51:35] different way of believing. And I'm
[51:36] going to conclude with one thing and
[51:38] that is
[51:40] the prophet said it's the simplicity.
[51:44] It's the simplicity.
[51:47] Does everybody hear me? It's the
[51:49] simplicity that we stumble over. So I
[51:52] pray that God will give us uh a special
[51:56] divine quickening so we'll understand
[51:58] what is the simplicity. We don't want to
[52:01] stumble over something that's so simple.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; And so God help us. Now we're going to
[52:05] read.
[52:07] I'm going to read you one verse before
[52:09] we read Ephesians. And you don't have to
[52:13] turn to it. It's just a oneline verse
[52:15] out of First Corinthians 14. and 8. For
[52:20] if the trumpet give an uncertain sound,
[52:23] who shall prepare himself to the battle?
[52:28] If we are going to call in and conquer,
[52:30] who's going to prepare themselves to
[52:32] battle? Now, we'll read in Ephesians 6
[52:36] and 11.
[52:37] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[52:39] may be able to stand against the ws of
[52:42] the devil. For we wrestle not against
[52:45] flesh and blood, but against
[52:47] principalities,
[52:49] against powers, against the rulers of
[52:52] the darkness. May I say that again?
[52:55] Against the rulers of the darkness of
[52:58] this world, against spiritual wickedness
[53:02] in high places. Wherefore take unto you
[53:05] the whole armor of God, that you may be
[53:07] able to withstand in the evil day, and
[53:11] having done all to stand. Stand
[53:14] therefore, having your loins girded
[53:16] about with truth, and having on the
[53:19] breastplate of righteousness, and your
[53:21] feet shaw with the preparation of the
[53:23] gospel of peace, above all, taking the
[53:26] shield of faith, wherewith you shall be
[53:29] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[53:32] the devil. I would like you know rose
[53:34] above all take the shield of faith
[53:40] &gt;&gt; and take the helmet of salvation and the
[53:43] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[53:47] God. Heavenly father, we stand here in
[53:50] your presence. We stand as your
[53:53] children. We stand as those that have
[53:56] been purchased by the blood of Jesus
[53:58] Christ. We stand, oh God, that we might
[54:01] take our position. We stand, oh God,
[54:04] that we might put on the whole armor of
[54:06] God and and and not just to meet the uh
[54:11] opposing forces, but to have victory
[54:13] over them.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not wallowing in defeat,
[54:17] &gt;&gt; but we are rising in victory, and we are
[54:21] praising your name for what you have
[54:23] achieved for us. In the name of Jesus
[54:26] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[54:29] You may be seated.
[54:39] To wrestle,
[54:41] we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[54:43] but to wrestle is a contest between two
[54:47] individuals
[54:49] and in which one endeavors to throw the
[54:53] other
[54:54] and which is decided when the victor is
[54:57] able to hold his opponent down. Not just
[55:00] throw him down, but hold him down. Put
[55:03] his hand upon his neck.
[55:06] A ruler.
[55:09] We need these just for we can move
[55:11] forward. A ruler
[55:14] is uh it's only used once in the New
[55:18] Testament.
[55:22] The Greek terminology for the ruler
[55:26] only used once, but it's a ruler, lord
[55:29] of the world, prince of this age. The
[55:33] devil and demons are called this and
[55:37] that is directly out of the uh Greek
[55:44] not Greek Bible but the Greek meaning
[55:46] for the word. I just want you to have
[55:49] that and hold that. And then it it also
[55:52] is tied into the world ruler of the
[55:55] world and the world which is the cosmos.
[56:00] It's not the world that the ground that
[56:02] we're standing on, but the world it is
[56:05] the the arrangement or the constitution.
[56:09] Uh you have a constitution in the United
[56:11] States. Uh we have a constitution in
[56:14] Canada. Many countries have
[56:16] constitutions. It's the order or the
[56:19] arrangement by which the country
[56:21] operates. And that's the cosmos. That's
[56:25] the world. And every country has perhaps
[56:28] a different set of regulations, rules,
[56:31] taxation, education, all of these
[56:33] various things. And they all look upon
[56:36] it differently. But it the the world is
[56:39] also world affairs. The aggregate, the
[56:43] complete aggregate of things earthly,
[56:46] the whole circle of earthly goods,
[56:50] endowments,
[56:51] riches, advantages,
[56:54] opportunities, pleasures,
[56:58] etc. which allow which although
[57:02] hollow
[57:04] hollow
[57:06] vain
[57:07] and fleeting because they pass and
[57:11] change so quickly. They stir the desire
[57:15] and seduce from God and are obstacles to
[57:20] the cause of Christ.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Was that well said?
[57:26] the ungodly multitude of people
[57:28] alienated from God and therefore hostile
[57:33] to the cause of Christ. That is the
[57:35] world.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; The multitudes and masses which are
[57:39] alienated from God and opposed to God,
[57:43] &gt;&gt; that's the world. And that's not to
[57:46] affect the believer.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; But we are in the world. Jesus said we
[57:50] are in the world, but we are not of the
[57:53] world. The world has not produced us.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; The world has not produced this message.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; The world has not produced our faith.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; The world has not produced what the
[58:06] believer is. I'm talking about the
[58:09] dedicated
[58:11] surrendered believer.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; And we're going to make some distinction
[58:14] on these things. So now that's the
[58:17] world. So the the the scripture that
[58:20] Paul is saying, we wrestle not against
[58:22] flesh and blood.
[58:24] But we do wrestle against principalities
[58:28] &gt;&gt; and against powers. We do
[58:32] against rulers of the darkness of this
[58:35] world.
[58:38] When you read that, you cannot feel like
[58:41] you're being a pathy.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[58:45] &gt;&gt; You cannot feel as though someone who's
[58:47] just got their arms hanging down. In
[58:50] fact is I cannot read this and just view
[58:52] someone we come to church on Sunday.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; That's not what this is talking about.
[58:59] This is talking about people that have
[59:01] force and they realize that they're
[59:03] fighting a struggle every day and they
[59:06] realize they've been called to victory.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; And everyone, you know, we we perhaps
[59:11] face times in our lives where it seems
[59:14] that we come against a stone wall. But
[59:16] that stone wall is not to prevent you in
[59:19] your spiritual life.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; You may have it. You may hit it. You may
[59:24] come against it. But you will have you
[59:26] are you are elected. You are called to
[59:30] have victory over that.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; And then you think, well, victory over
[59:36] what? I want to be very specific today.
[59:39] Whatever your inheritance, whatever
[59:41] Christ bought for you, that is your
[59:43] inheritance in Christ. And if you have
[59:47] something that is just ramming at you
[59:50] and hindering you and and preventing you
[59:54] from coming into what you know in your
[59:56] heart is yours, rightfully yours, then
[1:00:00] you want to be very aggressive and very
[1:00:04] persistent and exercise your faith
[1:00:06] towards that. I know that God is not
[1:00:10] intending that I go through life lacking
[1:00:13] this and being without this. He bought
[1:00:16] it for me. Jesus went to Calvary for me.
[1:00:20] And I know that this is mine.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; This is part of my inheritance. You have
[1:00:25] to decide what your inheritance is.
[1:00:29] And then also
[1:00:31] this world this this word ruler which it
[1:00:35] involves world it also involves comes
[1:00:38] from a word strength and strong
[1:00:42] and to have power to be powerful to be
[1:00:45] chief this is what is in Satan's mind to
[1:00:49] be powerful to be to have power to be
[1:00:53] powerful to be chief to master
[1:00:56] to be the master and to rule. That says
[1:01:00] the part of of against the rulers of
[1:01:03] darkness. This is what in the mind to
[1:01:06] get possession of, to become master of,
[1:01:10] to take hold of,
[1:01:12] you know, it was spoken of here just a
[1:01:15] few days ago. It says,
[1:01:18] well, maybe one of our young people that
[1:01:21] they would uh that they would excel in
[1:01:24] in in sports. I hope not.
[1:01:29] I hope not. You say, "Well, why? That's
[1:01:31] what we everybody we want them to
[1:01:33] excel." Well, then they will be they'll
[1:01:36] be called and and and and put into teams
[1:01:40] and they want them to play on Sunday.
[1:01:43] That's why
[1:01:45] a believer needs to go to the heart of
[1:01:47] the subject right away.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; We're going to talk about king economy.
[1:01:55] We're
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; going to talk about king immigration.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; We're going to talk about king
[1:01:59] education.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; They're all good, but they're not to
[1:02:05] become king.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Our jobs.
[1:02:15] They want to rule and Satan would like
[1:02:17] to rule. And and when you have a prophet
[1:02:20] that just gives a oneliner,
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; every kingdom is of Satan.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; You'll need to agree with that because
[1:02:28] that's exactly the case.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Every kingdom,
[1:02:33] king taxation,
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; king economy. You're not in charge of
[1:02:39] the economy. The gas goes up, the gas
[1:02:41] goes down, the rent is this, the rent is
[1:02:43] that. You This is what you pay. Things
[1:02:45] have gone up in price and so on and so
[1:02:47] forth. You're not You're not in control
[1:02:49] of things,
[1:02:51] King. Inflation. You're not in control
[1:02:53] of inflation.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; My You're nice and quiet
[1:03:00] because this is the world we live in.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; You know, you can go here to a a
[1:03:09] collectible store and and see some old
[1:03:12] magazine and I guarantee you, you'll
[1:03:14] smile. Take an old 1930s magazine and
[1:03:18] you'll see a Ford and Ford car or you
[1:03:22] know Chev car or whatever beautiful page
[1:03:25] or advertising. Hey, they were getting
[1:03:27] the attention of the people back there.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; But the whole car is $928.
[1:03:35] Of course you smile and say, "And that
[1:03:37] car is $32,000 today." You say, "Well,
[1:03:41] things have really gone up." That's the
[1:03:43] world you live in.
[1:03:46] And you didn't say, you didn't decide it
[1:03:49] was worth 32,000. The world, the world,
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; strong world,
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; tells you what it's worth, what you're
[1:04:00] going to pay, what you're going to earn,
[1:04:03] I better get off that,
[1:04:08] but I'm trying to be a trumpet. If the
[1:04:10] trumpet gives an uncertain sound and
[1:04:12] then the in the message a trumpet gives
[1:04:14] an uncertain sound. Brother Brandham
[1:04:17] says, "Oh, the things that's got our
[1:04:19] democracy so corrupted
[1:04:23] until it's real shaky." We used to could
[1:04:26] put a lot of confidence in our democracy
[1:04:30] and which I do think it's the best form
[1:04:33] of government but still our uh our
[1:04:38] democracy is shaky
[1:04:40] because we see this nation our people we
[1:04:44] have a constitution and this
[1:04:46] constitution is our ultimate but yet
[1:04:49] that our constitution is shaky
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; because it's it's already been broken.
[1:04:55] broen many times.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; It's shaky because it's been broken many
[1:04:59] times. And he carth for you. You like
[1:05:03] that title? He carth for you. You need
[1:05:05] that. When when I as I read it, you just
[1:05:08] keep thinking he carth for you. Satan is
[1:05:11] the ruler of every nation. He carth for
[1:05:14] you.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Every kingdom belongs to Satan. He carth
[1:05:18] for you.
[1:05:22] You excuse me. I'm just having some I'm
[1:05:24] enjoying it. He rules them according to
[1:05:28] his own way of ruling. But did not he
[1:05:31] offer them to the son of God one day?
[1:05:34] These are mine. I do what I what I do
[1:05:38] with them whatever I want to do. All the
[1:05:40] kingdoms of the world. He offered them
[1:05:42] to Jesus Christ. He said that's the
[1:05:44] reason they fight and kill and murder.
[1:05:47] But Jesus said, "Get thee behind me,
[1:05:50] Satan.
[1:05:53] Isn't that wonderful the way he puts it
[1:05:54] together? Get thee behind me, Satan. For
[1:05:57] he knew that he would fall heir to them.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; And that's the position of every
[1:06:03] believer. Yes, it might be the way they
[1:06:06] want to run Christmas. Isn't it an
[1:06:09] amazing thing? You talk about You talk
[1:06:11] about king economy. Talk about who who's
[1:06:14] who would stand and say
[1:06:17] there's no commercialization over
[1:06:19] Christmas?
[1:06:21] At Christmas, it's even a pagan holiday.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; It's not even the It's not even the
[1:06:27] birth of Christ. But Satan somehow got
[1:06:30] control of it and brought it over to uh
[1:06:34] Christmas period. And a prophet has to
[1:06:37] come and say he's a lamb and he's born
[1:06:39] in the spring.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; He's not born in the winter.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; He's born in the springtime.
[1:06:46] And then here we come and now the whole
[1:06:48] thing is a complete chaotic time of
[1:06:52] party and depression and drunkenness and
[1:06:56] sin and revalry and all of these things.
[1:06:59] And this is Christ's birth that is a
[1:07:02] demon of hell
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; that has taken and turned that into this
[1:07:06] kind of a and it's a total
[1:07:08] commercialization. And then after
[1:07:11] Christmas you're dealing with king
[1:07:13] economy,
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:17] And I said, "Prince credit card."
[1:07:26] All right.
[1:07:29] In the uncertain sound again, he said,
[1:07:31] "If the trumpet gives an uncertain
[1:07:33] sound, who can prepare himself for
[1:07:35] battle?"
[1:07:37] So, I'm trying to give a clear sound
[1:07:40] this morning
[1:07:42] so we can prepare ourselves for battle.
[1:07:44] It's going to surprise you a few more a
[1:07:47] little ways down the road here. He said,
[1:07:49] "If it's if it's uncertain, what would a
[1:07:52] soldier do if it was preparing for
[1:07:56] battle? And if they give the sound and
[1:07:58] didn't sound like the regular sound to
[1:08:01] go to battle, he wouldn't know whether
[1:08:03] to retreat or whether to go to battle or
[1:08:07] whether to sat down or whether to eat
[1:08:10] his dinner or what to do or go to bed if
[1:08:15] it didn't give a certain distinct
[1:08:17] distinction in the sound. So God's word
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; doesn't does not make any scruples. It
[1:08:26] gives a certain sound. Certain sound.
[1:08:30] When God speaks to an individual,
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; and I pray he'll speak to individuals
[1:08:35] this morning. When he speaks to an
[1:08:37] individual, it's certain.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; I don't care what anybody else says,
[1:08:42] what science says, or what the nation
[1:08:45] says, what the world says, what the
[1:08:48] church says. And we can talk about king
[1:08:51] religion.
[1:08:53] Well, my religion who well my king
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; listen I'm interested in one the king of
[1:09:00] kings
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; and his and how he dispatches his word
[1:09:05] and how he handles his word. I'm
[1:09:08] interested in that. And if the king of
[1:09:10] kings decided I'm going to have a
[1:09:12] prophet and I'm going to stand beside
[1:09:14] him. I'm going to prove that I'm on the
[1:09:16] platform with him. I'm in the auditorium
[1:09:19] with him. That's the voice I want to
[1:09:22] hear.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Say, well, the voice of my government or
[1:09:27] the voice of my church or the voice of
[1:09:29] my priest or the voice of my religion is
[1:09:32] different from that. Then you got to
[1:09:34] decide which one you're going to hang to
[1:09:38] and hold to.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Whether it's the nation or whether it's
[1:09:42] the world or what the church says or
[1:09:45] what anybody else says, my friends or my
[1:09:48] associates.
[1:09:50] If they don't say what the word of God
[1:09:52] says, it's the end of it.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; And you can't pancy around with it. You
[1:09:59] can't soft glove the thing because if
[1:10:02] they're a real friend, if they're a real
[1:10:04] associate, they'll be affected by a real
[1:10:07] decision. People want reality. They want
[1:10:11] something that means something to a
[1:10:13] person.
[1:10:18] I heard last night
[1:10:20] from brother Murphy who's testifying now
[1:10:23] or he's speaking this in
[1:10:27] interpretation
[1:10:29] but we were talking about what God had
[1:10:31] done
[1:10:32] and it's it was such a joy brother Jason
[1:10:37] and to hear the testimony
[1:10:40] of your parents
[1:10:43] and the change in a man's life, in a
[1:10:47] young man's life.
[1:10:50] And brother Murphy was saying to me, it
[1:10:53] was about a year and a half after
[1:10:55] brother Jason was here. Now, this is the
[1:10:58] first time, Brother Jason, you've ever
[1:11:00] heard this. I sat on this platform and
[1:11:04] would see you at sitting in different
[1:11:05] places in the church. I actually saw
[1:11:09] that change coming on you. I saw God
[1:11:14] dealing with you. I saw you receiving
[1:11:18] the word of God. And I know that this
[1:11:21] word of God has transforming power.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; This is not a paperback book. It's not
[1:11:26] an ordinary book. It is it can take a
[1:11:29] hold of a man and it can take a hold of
[1:11:31] a girl and just change her.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; And they saw the change in you, Mary.
[1:11:38] Not that they didn't see changes other
[1:11:39] people, but we've seen the transforming
[1:11:42] power. I have sat here on the platform
[1:11:45] and saw the transforming power. I saw
[1:11:47] the transforming power in John Waldner.
[1:11:50] I've saw the transforming power in
[1:11:52] Jonathan Dertie and many many of you
[1:11:55] others and families here who've seen the
[1:11:58] transforming power. not leaving anyone
[1:12:00] out. But it's wonderful when you can see
[1:12:02] a young man or a young woman today and
[1:12:05] God gets a hold of their lives and and
[1:12:08] lays a hold of them. God knows what he
[1:12:10] wants to do with them.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; And you simply want to say now we're in
[1:12:16] implementation. You want to say I will
[1:12:18] yield to you.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, oh God, that's what
[1:12:22] I'm here to do. I'm not here to attend
[1:12:24] church. I'm here to come under the
[1:12:26] influence of the Holy Spirit and be
[1:12:30] transformed
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; from an old man to a new man,
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; from a from one kind of a son to another
[1:12:37] kind of a son.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; I say to Jason's mother and dad.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul said, "I'm not what I used
[1:12:47] to be.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; The things I once loved, I now hate.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; The things I once hated, I now love.
[1:12:55] That's the kind of change
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; that's repentance.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; That's turning around and going the
[1:13:00] other direction.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; So, I would like to I'm not going to get
[1:13:10] done today either. I won't try. But I
[1:13:12] would like to speak just give these two
[1:13:15] phrases to you. Life in the land or life
[1:13:20] in your inheritance.
[1:13:23] and the fruits in the land.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; The fruits. And that's going to be a
[1:13:28] shock to you. The fruits of your
[1:13:31] inheritance,
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; they're yours.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Not what the world, we don't want the
[1:13:38] peace that the world tries to give. They
[1:13:40] can't find peace.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; We want the source and the author and
[1:13:44] the prince of peace.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; So the life in the land, what is the
[1:13:51] promised land?
[1:13:53] I'm sorry I don't have this for you on a
[1:13:54] PowerPoint.
[1:13:56] What is the promised land? The Holy
[1:13:58] Ghost. He said what laid what laid
[1:14:01] between Joshua and the promised land was
[1:14:04] the Jordan.
[1:14:06] We heard sung about it this morning. And
[1:14:09] possessing all things the land
[1:14:12] belongs in other words the Holy Ghost or
[1:14:16] your life. Your life in the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:19] I'm speaking to every person here on an
[1:14:21] individual personal level. Your life in
[1:14:25] the Holy Ghost is your inheritance. It's
[1:14:28] already been purchased. It's already
[1:14:30] been paid for. And there shall be
[1:14:32] nothing, nothing must be permitted or
[1:14:36] allowed to hinder you from that. And if
[1:14:39] something is hindering you from that,
[1:14:41] then you must become aggressive.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; You must say, "If this takes prayer,
[1:14:46] I'll pray. If this takes forgiveness,
[1:14:49] I'll ask forgiveness. Whatever this
[1:14:51] takes, whatever is holding me back, I'm
[1:14:53] going to see that this is removed out of
[1:14:56] my way and I'm going to enter into my
[1:14:59] inheritance.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; I'll just put this in here. Sometimes
[1:15:09] I I I I can show you in the scripture
[1:15:12] where some of these kings that come
[1:15:14] against you.
[1:15:19] It it says in the in the that this king
[1:15:23] heard a certain thing was happening, a
[1:15:27] certain victory was taking place. And
[1:15:30] it's not just history now, but this was
[1:15:31] in the natural. And when they heard
[1:15:34] about it, then they would call other
[1:15:35] kings and consult together and say,
[1:15:38] "Help me
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; to come against this."
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; And now you've you that are followers of
[1:15:46] the message, you've heard it.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God will be standing
[1:15:50] right here behind the pullpit and he
[1:15:53] will and I'm going to go through and
[1:15:54] dissect one incident, one event where he
[1:15:58] said it very very clearly. And he said
[1:16:01] to the woman, "I am stalling and you
[1:16:03] don't know why I'm stalling. I don't
[1:16:05] want to get ahead of myself." But when
[1:16:07] he begins to deal with it, he said, "Now
[1:16:09] that now that demon is calling for
[1:16:13] another one to help him."
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; And he identify where the other one is.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it might be a a sickness
[1:16:21] or a disease. Now friends, you're
[1:16:24] sitting here, but there's a whole host
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; of spirits that's in opposition to you.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; It will I I if you're given over to
[1:16:34] criticism, you'll find something to
[1:16:36] criticize.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; If you're given over to doubt, you'll
[1:16:39] find something to doubt.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; If you're given over to whatever it is
[1:16:43] might be. But if you're given over to
[1:16:45] faith,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; you'll be given faith. If you're given
[1:16:49] over to the Holy Spirit of God, I want
[1:16:53] him dwelling in me. I want the fullness
[1:16:55] of the Holy Spirit. There's only one
[1:16:58] thing that you need to do, and that is
[1:16:59] you must be determined to yield to that
[1:17:02] Holy Spirit, whatever he says to do.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; And there were people in the scripture
[1:17:10] that that needed to have victory. There
[1:17:12] were there were believers, people who
[1:17:14] were going to have the inheritance, but
[1:17:16] they realized themselves that they
[1:17:18] weren't they weren't sufficient within
[1:17:20] themselves. And there's nothing wrong
[1:17:22] with a believer calling another believer
[1:17:24] and saying, "Help me here. Help me here.
[1:17:27] I need strength. I need a strong
[1:17:29] believer. I don't want somebody who's
[1:17:32] waffling around back and forth. I want
[1:17:34] somebody that knows where they stand. I
[1:17:36] want somebody who knows their God. I
[1:17:39] want somebody who knows how to pray, who
[1:17:42] knows how to believe. I want that
[1:17:44] person, come and pray with me, stand
[1:17:47] with me because I'm determined to have
[1:17:49] victory in this case.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; And God will honor that.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; We've had the experience at our own
[1:18:02] home.
[1:18:04] My wife has suffered sometimes
[1:18:10] and one one time it was so distinct and
[1:18:12] I I was I'm happy that it happened. So I
[1:18:14] have it as a testimony. We were just on
[1:18:17] our way to Tacoma to visit
[1:18:21] and she had her hand on the doororknob
[1:18:23] just going out the back door of our
[1:18:25] house
[1:18:27] and she said and she took her hand off
[1:18:29] as her coat. We both have our coats on.
[1:18:32] She turns around. She said, "Now notice
[1:18:35] this. I want you," is a wife speaking to
[1:18:37] a husband, "I want you to get the bottle
[1:18:41] of oil and anoint me with oil and pray
[1:18:46] for me. That thing has come back on me."
[1:18:50] And I said, "That thing had been from
[1:18:52] years ago." And the specialist said, "If
[1:18:55] that ever comes back, you get in contact
[1:18:58] with me right away." So that's how
[1:19:00] serious it was. Said, "I want you to get
[1:19:03] the bottle of oil and pray for me and
[1:19:06] anoint me with oil." And I and she said,
[1:19:08] "That thing has come back." I said,
[1:19:10] "When did it come back?" She said,
[1:19:12] "About 3 weeks ago." I said, "Why didn't
[1:19:14] you tell me earlier?" I went back into
[1:19:18] the kitchen. Listen to this.
[1:19:22] And I slid out a chair. I took the oil,
[1:19:25] which we had a little bottle of oil to
[1:19:27] anoint. if anybody needed prayer off the
[1:19:31] window sill. I anointed my wife with
[1:19:34] oil, prayed for her as we both knelt at
[1:19:37] a chair and got up and walked to the
[1:19:40] door. And by the time she put her hand
[1:19:42] on the door knob, she was healed.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; You know what it is?
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; It's reading the textbook.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Follow this textbook.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; And now she wasn't just speaking to her
[1:19:57] husband. And she was speaking to the
[1:19:58] office.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; The office. You're the pastor. You're
[1:20:03] the office. You're the one ordained.
[1:20:06] Take this bottle of oil and pray for me.
[1:20:09] And by the time God has to honor that.
[1:20:12] By the time we got to the door, it was
[1:20:14] gone.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; And it's never come back since.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Let the congregation sing and say,
[1:20:20] "Amen."
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; That's your God.
[1:20:26] And we're talking about a God that we
[1:20:27] can implement
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; his instructions.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; So the the fruit the life in the land
[1:20:38] and the fruits of the land. Okay. What
[1:20:41] is the fruits? We say well the fruits of
[1:20:43] the spirit and this is where I went
[1:20:44] right away. The fruits of the spirit is
[1:20:47] love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:20:49] goodness,
[1:20:51] gentleness, faith, meekness, temperance.
[1:20:55] Against such there is no law. And that's
[1:20:58] all wonderful, but that goes right over
[1:21:00] our head because what does all of those
[1:21:03] things mean? But here's what the prophet
[1:21:05] says about the fruits.
[1:21:08] said the fruits
[1:21:12] and look what this Jesus of Nazareth
[1:21:15] done
[1:21:17] the other day.
[1:21:19] In other words, let me let me premise it
[1:21:21] by this. The fruits
[1:21:24] is the manifestation
[1:21:26] or the manifesting of a life.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; The fruits of your life. But the fruits
[1:21:33] of the spirit is manifesting the
[1:21:37] promised
[1:21:38] word for this hour, for this day. And so
[1:21:43] now I'll I'll just finish reading this
[1:21:45] quote, please.
[1:21:47] And look what Jesus of Nazareth done the
[1:21:49] other day. What he ever do for the fruit
[1:21:54] of the spirit?
[1:21:57] He was coming into the temple. The money
[1:21:59] changers were there. You remember this
[1:22:01] story? and the sellers of oxen and sheep
[1:22:04] and doves and he was talking to
[1:22:06] businessmen. It was a message was
[1:22:08] paradox and he says he come and he
[1:22:12] kicked them things out and he emptied
[1:22:14] them up and told them there that they
[1:22:18] were a den of thieves. Not much fruit of
[1:22:22] the spirit there is there. He said your
[1:22:24] kind old priest never gets out of humor.
[1:22:29] This fellow, speaking of Jesus, planted
[1:22:33] ropes together and kicked the tables
[1:22:35] over and run them out of there and look
[1:22:38] angered at them. He said, "What is the
[1:22:41] fruit of the spirit?"
[1:22:44] Here's your question and here's your
[1:22:46] answer. The manifestation
[1:22:49] of the promised word.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; That's the fruit of the spirit.
[1:22:55] The spirit of God
[1:22:58] that authored this word,
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; he didn't only he didn't only write it
[1:23:03] so that it would be spoken by uh men of
[1:23:07] God or churches or ministers or God's
[1:23:10] prophet to this day. That's not the full
[1:23:13] reason. The full reason is that it would
[1:23:16] then be believed
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; come down into your heart
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God would come upon
[1:23:23] you. That's why it says you'll be
[1:23:24] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:27] You repent and be baptized in the name
[1:23:29] of Jesus Christ and you shall you shall
[1:23:34] receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. And
[1:23:37] and and people ask what is that? It's
[1:23:39] the life of Christ. It's not your life
[1:23:42] that you came from your mother and dad.
[1:23:44] It's the life of Christ. It's another
[1:23:46] life from another land, from another
[1:23:48] world living in you in this world.
[1:23:52] That's right.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of God.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Follow me thus far.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; I'm making this very very elementary.
[1:24:03] And he said the fruit of the spirit is a
[1:24:05] manifestation of the promised word. If
[1:24:08] he said if they had just stopped to
[1:24:10] look, he did not have these things that
[1:24:14] they had fruit of the spirit or
[1:24:17] anything. But the word that was promised
[1:24:20] for that day was manifesting himself and
[1:24:24] that was exactly the light of the hour
[1:24:27] and that was it.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; That's the fruit of the spirit. And no
[1:24:32] matter how much education or how kind
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; or how much you might speak with tongues
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; or how kind and gentle and everything
[1:24:42] you are, I've seen people that are uh
[1:24:45] almost I would admire they were just so
[1:24:48] kind and so gentle and so on and so
[1:24:51] forth. And that is good. There's nothing
[1:24:54] wrong about that. But but when it comes
[1:24:57] time to stand firm
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; on this word,
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; to stand absolutely on this word,
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; whatever comes,
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; whatever comes,
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; say, "Well, this is going to cause a
[1:25:12] disaster. This is going to cause a rift
[1:25:14] in my family. This is going to cause
[1:25:17] whatever it costs.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; I'd hang my soul on the word of God.
[1:25:24] Hallelujah.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at man down here, brother
[1:25:29] Milco Rabbar. You know him, but you
[1:25:34] maybe don't know the Milco that I know.
[1:25:37] He was a purser in an airlines.
[1:25:41] He was a head man, head honcho in the
[1:25:44] aircraft.
[1:25:45] He got saved. He came to this message.
[1:25:48] Been the airlines for years. You get to
[1:25:51] the top, you're the purser on a big jet.
[1:25:57] And I'm with him. I'm his pastor. So I
[1:26:01] hear about the things. I hear about his
[1:26:04] struggles because he goes on there. He
[1:26:06] goes on the plane and sees the women the
[1:26:09] way they're dressed. Well, now he's got
[1:26:11] different eyes.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; He says, "This looks terrible." And he
[1:26:15] tells them, "You look terrible.
[1:26:18] What are you saying?" So they go to the
[1:26:20] union and he gets in trouble and he
[1:26:23] comes to me says I'm in trouble with the
[1:26:26] union. They want to fire me but the
[1:26:28] union won't let them. The company wants
[1:26:30] to fire me cuz the people are and then
[1:26:34] uh you know they serve drinks. He says I
[1:26:36] don't I don't serve it anymore. So he
[1:26:38] just tell the other girls you do it. You
[1:26:40] do it. So suddenly he's he's he's not
[1:26:43] doing his job. You do it. Others do it.
[1:26:46] I can't do that anymore. And finally
[1:26:49] they told him uh at one point believe I
[1:26:53] have this pretty right
[1:26:55] I heard it enough times
[1:26:58] and they said to Milo you've got to stop
[1:27:01] that you stop talking about these
[1:27:04] things. He said I can't find the stop
[1:27:06] button. Where's the stop button? So he
[1:27:10] comes to me. He said I I can't find the
[1:27:12] stop button.
[1:27:17] So it became a mutual separation.
[1:27:20] He's one of two people. There was two.
[1:27:23] There's another person. I don't know who
[1:27:25] the other person is, but he was one of
[1:27:27] two people ever to get uh free flights
[1:27:34] from then on the rest of his life. And
[1:27:37] you say, "Wow, wow, wow, I could
[1:27:39] travel." No, no, no. That's why he gets
[1:27:42] on a plane and sometimes he'll fly to
[1:27:44] Ottawa just to get visas for us because
[1:27:47] he can fly there and back for next to
[1:27:49] nothing. And then that's why he goes
[1:27:51] with myself to be a help or goes to
[1:27:54] someone else to help them or takes uh
[1:27:56] takes message books or goes to encourage
[1:28:00] somebody over in Macedonia or over in uh
[1:28:03] Russia or wherever more cuz and when he
[1:28:05] comes with me generally his world flight
[1:28:08] cost about $150
[1:28:10] and that's why they gave it to him.
[1:28:12] That's why he had to get fired.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; That had to happen. You say, "Well, you
[1:28:18] don't go down and say, "Well, you know
[1:28:20] what? I got fired." Praise God, I got
[1:28:22] fired.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't holler booze around.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't lie about how people
[1:28:28] looked.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Don't be quiet, folks.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Be aggressive.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to put some something into
[1:28:38] your bodies. Spiritual bodies.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Say, "Who had the fruits of the spirit?"
[1:28:45] He said, "Jesus." He said, "Search the
[1:28:48] scriptures.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; You think uh them you think you have
[1:28:53] eternal life. They testify of me. They
[1:28:56] tell of who I am."
[1:28:58] Never did come out and say who he was.
[1:29:01] He didn't tell them and why he got his
[1:29:04] congregation
[1:29:06] uh that great. He said, "Unless you eat
[1:29:08] the flesh of the son of man and drink
[1:29:11] his blood, as I said last night, you
[1:29:13] have no you have no life." And serves uh
[1:29:17] we would see Jesus, he said, "You want
[1:29:19] to see what the fruit of the spirit is?
[1:29:22] Watch what the Bible promises
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; for a certain hour,
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; then watch for that to be vindicated."
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; You want to know what the spirit is? the
[1:29:33] fruits of the land,
[1:29:36] the fruits of the land. As you watch to
[1:29:38] see what God vindicates,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; you watch the word of God to see, look
[1:29:44] in here to see what is the promise of
[1:29:47] your day, of this hour. Then you watch
[1:29:50] for God
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; to vindicate it and prove it.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; That's the fruit of the spirit, the
[1:29:56] fruit of the land.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:30:03] Now, I said earlier Joshua divided up
[1:30:07] the land
[1:30:08] and his giving his last charge. If you
[1:30:12] want to read it when you get home, you
[1:30:14] can go to Joshua, the book of the book
[1:30:16] of Joshua, chapter 23 and 24. Don't go
[1:30:21] there now. But he he uh he had led them
[1:30:25] into the promised land, had already
[1:30:27] divided the inheritance to the tribes of
[1:30:29] Israel, and now was gathered all Israel
[1:30:33] to give them his last charge. And last
[1:30:36] week I gave you the chapter 12 where he
[1:30:40] gave the names of 31 kings.
[1:30:44] And these kings I just just to give a
[1:30:47] quick summary. These kings were there in
[1:30:52] God's plan and program. They were there.
[1:30:55] They were men of renown.
[1:30:58] They were men that were smart.
[1:31:01] They were men who could persuade people.
[1:31:04] They were kings. They were looked upon
[1:31:06] and re and respected as as a king.
[1:31:15] things that may oppose you
[1:31:19] in this world
[1:31:21] from being the kind of believer that you
[1:31:24] want to be.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; He's not your friend.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; He's your enemy.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Anything that would try to persuade you
[1:31:34] away or to have a soft touch or to
[1:31:37] question or to what whatever position
[1:31:40] anyone might take. And sometime it can
[1:31:43] be a job. Sometime it can be a
[1:31:46] promotion. Sometime it could be a rose.
[1:31:50] Sometime it could be something that's
[1:31:52] natural in that some some men are built
[1:31:56] with physiques and bodies that I admire,
[1:32:00] but that might be your biggest trap.
[1:32:03] Some girls may be born with a certain
[1:32:06] attributes of beauty. That could be your
[1:32:09] biggest danger.
[1:32:14] You understand?
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; That's the thing. Satan will throw roses
[1:32:20] down. Uh
[1:32:23] I I was at um
[1:32:27] I was at a a ceremony,
[1:32:31] graduation ceremony some years ago at
[1:32:34] one of our schools and they had a a lady
[1:32:38] there speaking. I think she was a
[1:32:40] professor.
[1:32:43] And she told the people that were
[1:32:45] graduating and all the people were that
[1:32:47] were there and there was hundreds of us
[1:32:49] there. And she said, "Now you people,
[1:32:52] you students will probably have five
[1:32:55] different occupations because and the
[1:32:59] bluecollar worker is uh going out
[1:33:02] completely.
[1:33:04] Bluecollar workers, those that for
[1:33:06] trades and all of those things and I
[1:33:08] just said to my wife, she's crazy.
[1:33:12] respectfully. She didn't know what she's
[1:33:13] talking about. You say, "Well, how do
[1:33:16] you say that? Why would you be
[1:33:17] disrespectful?"
[1:33:19] I said, I just said to my wife quietly,
[1:33:22] I said, "Where's the plumbers? Where's
[1:33:24] the electricians? Where's the guys who's
[1:33:26] going to fix the car? Where are these
[1:33:29] bluecollar workers?" Said, "You're never
[1:33:31] going to be done with them." But anyway,
[1:33:34] these young people were being fed and
[1:33:36] and they came past and uh you have to
[1:33:40] forgive me. I'm just I'm just Brother
[1:33:42] Biscll now. And they and the girls come
[1:33:44] by in all their robes and their hats and
[1:33:46] so on so forth. And uh
[1:33:51] this I I'm going to study psychology and
[1:33:54] then I'm going to take a year and travel
[1:33:56] to Europe and da da da. And I said she's
[1:33:58] going to be married and have a couple
[1:33:59] kids before she knows it.
[1:34:03] you know, and I I don't know how many I
[1:34:05] counted. We're going to study
[1:34:07] psychology.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; How is it
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; terrible?
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; It's terrible.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Psychology where they question
[1:34:17] everything.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Well, I was using psychology sitting in
[1:34:21] the listening to them. I say I I
[1:34:23] question that that she's going to travel
[1:34:25] for Europe for a year and then go do
[1:34:28] this and study and you know going to go
[1:34:30] take further education and I'm going to
[1:34:32] go to college. You know who was
[1:34:34] speaking? King education.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Was it wrong to go to college? Not a
[1:34:41] bit. Not a bit. I wish I could have
[1:34:43] gone. I maybe learned something or
[1:34:46] whatever more. But I've had people come
[1:34:49] up and you know it didn't matter. I
[1:34:51] preached for 30 years. They'd say,
[1:34:53] "Where do you go to school?"
[1:34:56] It's called the school of hard knocks.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; It's called the school of of learning
[1:35:02] through making errors
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; and and being able to recognize and say,
[1:35:06] "That was a wrong decision."
[1:35:11] I've had people come to me out of this
[1:35:13] congregation and said, "I've been
[1:35:15] offered a this wonderful wonderful
[1:35:18] uh promotion,
[1:35:20] and there's a huge increase in salary,
[1:35:24] but I have to I have to be out of out of
[1:35:28] touch with the believers. I have to be
[1:35:32] someplace else."
[1:35:36] There was a brother. He was sitting here
[1:35:37] in a watch night service and I looked up
[1:35:40] at him. His wife is here today. He came
[1:35:44] to me and he said, "Brother Red, I've
[1:35:46] been offered a job this years ago. I've
[1:35:49] been offered a job out way up in the
[1:35:51] north in the Yukon."
[1:35:53] He said, "And are going to fly me home
[1:35:56] about every 10 days or something." And
[1:35:59] but he said, "And they're going to pay
[1:36:01] me $80,000 a year net net
[1:36:05] just to be up there." He says, "I just
[1:36:07] said to them, and leave my church."
[1:36:14] Does that sound strange? No, he turned
[1:36:17] it down flat.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; He just turned down flat
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; and that was that was his position.
[1:36:35] Uh, I'm I'm going to jump here as I want
[1:36:39] to.
[1:36:44] Shall I go on?
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:36:48] No, it's on your
[1:36:51] It's your fault what I say.
[1:36:55] The first king, the first king
[1:36:59] that
[1:37:01] Joshua mentions is not even a king he
[1:37:04] had to deal with, but he mentions he
[1:37:06] goes right back to Abraham and moves
[1:37:08] forward. Then the first king, this may
[1:37:10] not mean much to you, but it means a
[1:37:12] whole lot to me. The first king was king
[1:37:16] of Moab, and he speaks of Bailac
[1:37:20] and Balam. And he says, uh, but God said
[1:37:24] about Moab, I've given Moab this country
[1:37:29] and don't want you fussing with them,
[1:37:30] Brother Brham says, or procelitating.
[1:37:33] Just move through gently. You know where
[1:37:36] you're going.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Don't take their habits.
[1:37:47] And when Jesus,
[1:37:49] he he talks about Moab.
[1:37:52] Moab, for those of you that may not be
[1:37:55] as familiar with your Bible, Moab was
[1:37:58] the son of Lot
[1:38:02] by his daughter, by his eldest daughter.
[1:38:06] and the nation that descended from the
[1:38:08] son of Lot, the land inhabited by the
[1:38:11] descendants of the son of Lot, that was
[1:38:15] Moab.
[1:38:17] And uh
[1:38:20] Moab made some terrible choices.
[1:38:23] But now I want to come I I I was
[1:38:25] thinking and I would like you to come
[1:38:27] with me. And I know exactly. I want to I
[1:38:30] want to take this very very carefully
[1:38:32] and slowly because now I want to
[1:38:36] if it were the my last opportunity on
[1:38:38] life I would like to pass this principle
[1:38:41] off to you and this is the simple one
[1:38:44] that we stumble over.
[1:38:49] I thought what did Jesus do? How did he
[1:38:52] prepare
[1:38:54] for this great battle?
[1:38:57] I don't see him gathering strong men
[1:39:00] around him. I don't see him gathering
[1:39:04] influence.
[1:39:07] How is he preparing himself? If the
[1:39:10] trumpet gives a sound, how will we know
[1:39:12] if it gives an uncertain sound? How will
[1:39:14] we know to prepare ourselves for battle?
[1:39:16] And I I I just got thinking, friends,
[1:39:19] here we're sitting here. I'd like to sit
[1:39:21] across the table from you and say
[1:39:24] the reason why you're here is because we
[1:39:27] really are anticipating
[1:39:29] a rapture.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not coming to church in vain.
[1:39:36] I'm really here because I intend to make
[1:39:40] the rapture.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; I intend to go to another land. I intend
[1:39:46] to fulfill the scripture that says by
[1:39:49] Apostle Paul, we shall not all sleep,
[1:39:53] but we shall all be changed. And I think
[1:39:56] that everybody here wants to say yes.
[1:39:59] Amen.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here. You've hit it,
[1:40:05] Brother Biscll. You've hit it the nail
[1:40:07] on the head. I'm here because I want to
[1:40:11] be changed. Amen.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "If we don't have
[1:40:16] faith for healing, how we have faith for
[1:40:18] a rapture?"
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; So now that's what we're talking about.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, hear me friends.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Hear me now as I approach this.
[1:40:30] How did Jesus prepare him? And I was
[1:40:33] asking myself this and one thought came
[1:40:36] to me and I know it was the Holy Spirit.
[1:40:39] Said, "Thou will not leave my soul in
[1:40:42] hell
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; or suffer thy holy one to say
[1:40:46] corruption." And I thought, I want to
[1:40:48] see what the prophet of God said about
[1:40:50] that.
[1:40:53] He said,
[1:40:56] "And faith cometh by hearing." Now, I'm
[1:40:58] laying the principle. Watch this
[1:41:01] principle very closely.
[1:41:03] First we'll take it in Christ. Then
[1:41:05] we'll take it in the prophets of life
[1:41:07] and we'll take it to us now today here
[1:41:10] this morning. And he said in prayer when
[1:41:13] you came when you come to the earth you
[1:41:18] believe the word of God.
[1:41:21] You knew that God would keep his word.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason you said
[1:41:27] destroy this temple. Yes,
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; he was facing his enemies. Destroy this
[1:41:31] temple. I will raise it up in three
[1:41:34] days. For David had said, "I will not
[1:41:37] leave his soul in hell. Neither will I
[1:41:40] suffer my holy one to see corruption."
[1:41:43] He said, "You believed," brother
[1:41:46] Brandham, speaking now to the Lord in
[1:41:47] prayer. You believed the word of God on
[1:41:51] that one promise.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:57] I got to nail this down. You believed
[1:42:01] the prophet of God praying now. You
[1:42:03] believed the word of God on that one
[1:42:08] promise.
[1:42:18] had on his way
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; to the battle of the ages.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; I believe
[1:42:28] he will not leave my soul in hell
[1:42:31] nor suffer.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; He recognized who he was, thy holy one
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; to see corruption.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; He believed that and he was prepared to
[1:42:42] go to the agonizing death of
[1:42:44] crucifixion. He was prepared to go
[1:42:47] through the mockery. He was prepared to
[1:42:49] go to the tomb and have the sele.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Now friends, this isn't little poetic
[1:42:58] stories.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; This isn't just history. This is a
[1:43:01] principle that Jesus, your Lord, who's
[1:43:05] in you now,
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; he went to the tomb be and allowed it to
[1:43:10] be sealed because he believed that one
[1:43:14] promise.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; And I thank the heavenly father
[1:43:22] for setting the example.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; This is the example, friends. This
[1:43:28] example. Let me get this. I pray that
[1:43:29] God help me get this across to you. And
[1:43:32] I thank the for heavenly father for
[1:43:34] setting that example. And now
[1:43:38] we accept it tonight
[1:43:40] and believe it. and I now coming to him
[1:43:45] 2,000 years later and I go forward to
[1:43:50] challenge and not for a show but for the
[1:43:53] glory of God that the men and the women
[1:43:56] and the boys and the girls who are
[1:43:58] sitting here in this little group
[1:44:00] tonight might know and believe that
[1:44:02] truly you raised up your son Jesus from
[1:44:05] the dead and he lives among us tonight
[1:44:09] and we living received resurrected to
[1:44:12] the Lord Jesus. And it confirms the
[1:44:14] scripture. It confirms the scripture
[1:44:16] that Jesus Christ now he's going to the
[1:44:18] word. Jesus Christ is the same
[1:44:20] yesterday, today, and forever. Now, now
[1:44:23] he's saying now I am standing here to
[1:44:26] accept this challenge.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; The very same faith.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; I'm coming to your address now like
[1:44:36] never before in my life. I don't
[1:44:37] believe. The very same faith that
[1:44:40] brought our Lord Jesus out of the tomb
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; is the same faith that brother Brandham
[1:44:45] used. And by completely surrendering
[1:44:47] himself
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; to the spirit of God and now facing now
[1:44:52] he was facing any and every demon of
[1:44:56] hell or shall I say king
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; of the earth.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; He said I don't know whether it's
[1:45:03] marital problem. I don't know whether
[1:45:05] it's financial. I don't know whether
[1:45:07] it's this. I don't know whether it's
[1:45:08] that. I don't know whether it's
[1:45:09] sickness. I don't know whether it's a
[1:45:12] family problem. I don't know what it is.
[1:45:15] But I I face the challenge.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; And he had to use the same principle.
[1:45:21] And I'm telling you friends tonight or
[1:45:23] this morning rather, your feelings
[1:45:26] cannot get you there.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Your emotions cannot get you there.
[1:45:31] You're going to have to come to the
[1:45:32] place where God said it,
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; I believe it, and that's finished.
[1:45:38] You have to come to that place.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Some of these things are withstanding
[1:45:50] us from entering into the full
[1:45:52] inheritance of the full promise.
[1:45:55] And so now
[1:45:58] out in the audience when he's saying
[1:46:00] that now I'm I'm going back just a few
[1:46:04] years. I don't go back 2,000 years, but
[1:46:05] maybe go back 50. The same thing. If
[1:46:08] it's Jesus Christ, if it's not Jesus
[1:46:10] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:46:12] forever, I want to leave this pulpit,
[1:46:14] and you folks ought to go out the doors
[1:46:16] and never come back. But if it is Jesus
[1:46:18] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:46:20] forever, then that's why we're here.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; And either this book works or doesn't
[1:46:26] work.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Doesn't work.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Doesn't work.
[1:46:33] That's right.
[1:46:37] And now
[1:46:40] this is the point I I don't know whether
[1:46:42] I could make it convey it. Now he's
[1:46:45] speaking
[1:46:47] to the people.
[1:46:50] Those people are facing every enemy
[1:46:55] that Satan has. You face every enemy.
[1:47:00] Some of you will face king education.
[1:47:04] Some of you will face king sports. Some
[1:47:08] of you will face or are facing king
[1:47:10] economy.
[1:47:12] Some of you are facing king immigration
[1:47:15] or every any other jurisdiction
[1:47:19] because we face what the prophet said
[1:47:22] and we're not opposed to it. We're we're
[1:47:24] called to pray for our leaders.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; That is true. We're called to pray for
[1:47:29] our leaders. So, there's a razor's edge
[1:47:32] between you being king,
[1:47:37] allowing the King of Kings
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; to live in you, to be your thought and
[1:47:43] your mind.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Christ,
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; if we really believe the scripture, and
[1:47:49] I'm tying it together, Jesus said, Jesus
[1:47:52] said, Jesus said, I will be in you.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. This prophet knew that he would be
[1:47:59] in him.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; I will be in you
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; and you will be in me.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; You have I'm not announcing something
[1:48:07] you don't know. You have the King of
[1:48:09] Kings within you.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Then I say, "Let him rule."
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Let him rule.
[1:48:23] He says, "But just now, now now he's
[1:48:26] going to put this into action. He's
[1:48:27] going to implement.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; I want you to watch this
[1:48:30] implementation."
[1:48:35] Now, just to speak with you, he has a
[1:48:39] woman there
[1:48:42] and I'm waiting for his anointing. You
[1:48:46] know, I'm stalling.
[1:48:48] for that
[1:48:53] because we're just standing here
[1:48:56] like this. You're standing here just as
[1:48:59] helpless as can be, he says to the
[1:49:01] person. You're standing here just as
[1:49:04] helpless as can be.
[1:49:06] I never seen the woman.
[1:49:09] Could you want to put yourself in this
[1:49:13] position? And he says to the audience,
[1:49:15] "Would you want to put yourself in this
[1:49:17] position, friend?"
[1:49:20] He said, "I wouldn't either.
[1:49:24] I, William Brandham, I wouldn't want to
[1:49:26] put myself in this position either.
[1:49:30] If that angel hadn't stood out by me and
[1:49:34] said he would do it,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; here's the key. Now he says, "Now I
[1:49:42] believed him.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; I He said the second time, I believe
[1:49:50] him.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Put yourself in that place.
[1:50:00] Don't know who's coming up.
[1:50:03] I I'm standing here. I don't know what
[1:50:06] your situation is. every detail. I don't
[1:50:09] know. Somebody might have sickness and
[1:50:13] is a demon of hell or demon of death
[1:50:16] trying to rob you of your health. Some
[1:50:19] might have financial problems. I'm home
[1:50:22] at your address. Some of you could have
[1:50:24] marital problems.
[1:50:27] Some of you could have whatever whatever
[1:50:29] it might be.
[1:50:32] I can tell you without any hesitation or
[1:50:36] apology,
[1:50:38] Satan, who is the prince of the power of
[1:50:41] the air,
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; has every one of his fallen spirits up
[1:50:46] to war against you from entering your
[1:50:51] inheritance.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; And friends, it's already been paid for.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; It belongs to you. And that's the first
[1:51:00] position you have to come to. This land
[1:51:03] and the Holy Ghost is mine.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; It's been given to me by the author of
[1:51:10] the universe.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; God Almighty, the one God has said to
[1:51:16] me, if I believe on him, I shall inherit
[1:51:19] this. Does this congregation believe
[1:51:21] that?
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:51:25] Because we can't go any further until
[1:51:27] you confess and say, "I believe that."
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Here you've had a prophet say
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; that Jesus believed that one scripture,
[1:51:41] I'll not leave his soul in hell,
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; my holy one to see corruption. And the
[1:51:47] prophet said he had one verse to
[1:51:49] believe. and for healing. He said,
[1:51:52] "There's over 600." And he said to the
[1:51:55] people, I won't have time to quote it
[1:51:57] all. He said to the people, and we sit
[1:51:59] here slumbering. What's he saying?
[1:52:01] They're slumbering at its simplicity.
[1:52:04] They're slumbering at its historical
[1:52:06] aspect. They're slumbering for whatever
[1:52:08] reason. And they're coming before a
[1:52:11] prophet of God and have every
[1:52:13] opportunity. And he's only standing
[1:52:15] there because he said, "That angel, I
[1:52:18] believed him.
[1:52:21] I believed him.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll stand with you." I
[1:52:25] believed him.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Look what happens when a person
[1:52:29] believes.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; But now just just speaking to you. He
[1:52:38] said, "I'm stalling."
[1:52:40] He said, "Could you want to put yourself
[1:52:42] in this position?" I wouldn't.
[1:52:46] He said, "If that angel hadn't stood out
[1:52:48] by me and he said he would do it,"
[1:52:53] Jesus said, "I'll be in you
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; and I will do it."
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; He will do it.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; He said some things here
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; and I believed it.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; I want to believe it. I say, "Help thou
[1:53:08] my unbelief.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Help thou my unbelief, Lord." But here
[1:53:14] we're here in Cloverdale Bible Way. I
[1:53:16] don't know what your position is. I
[1:53:18] don't know where you're from. Some of
[1:53:19] you may be strangers or visitors here to
[1:53:21] the church. I don't know anything about
[1:53:23] that. But nevertheless, you're a human
[1:53:25] going. You're going to run this road and
[1:53:28] run this race just once.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; And then the author of faith will call
[1:53:33] every life. The author of life will call
[1:53:36] every life, every person sitting in this
[1:53:38] place, small, large, young, old,
[1:53:42] whatever is this. He'll call every life
[1:53:44] to give an answer for we have run this
[1:53:47] race through life. And I want to be one
[1:53:50] and I want you to be one to say a
[1:53:53] message came by my way and I believed
[1:53:56] him.
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:53:59] That's all I have. I I haven't got any
[1:54:03] great works to offer you. I haven't got
[1:54:06] any great things to offer you. But you
[1:54:09] said a word and I heard your voice and I
[1:54:11] believed him.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; I believed him.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; And because of that, I am what I am.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Because of that, you've been so gracious
[1:54:21] to me.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; I believed him.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; And he says, "If this woman's sick
[1:54:32] and I could heal her, I'd be a brute if
[1:54:34] I didn't do it."
[1:54:37] Watch this principle he's implementing
[1:54:39] now.
[1:54:41] He says, "But if I but if I couldn't
[1:54:43] heal her, but I couldn't heal her, God's
[1:54:46] already did that."
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; He He's saying exactly what this is in
[1:54:50] the simplest form. God's already done
[1:54:52] it.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; So often when we have sickness, we're
[1:54:57] afraid to say that.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Here's a man. Here's a prophet of God. I
[1:55:01] can't heal you. But they're coming up
[1:55:03] there. Thousands of them want to come
[1:55:05] up. They want him to lay hand on them.
[1:55:07] And he tells them over and over and over
[1:55:09] again, "I can't heal you. You already
[1:55:12] been healed.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus paid it all.
[1:55:26] God can correct all wrong. He said, "I
[1:55:30] couldn't heal her. God's already did
[1:55:31] that." If it's something else, no, he
[1:55:34] doesn't know. He doesn't know what kind
[1:55:35] of king he's going to face.
[1:55:38] You following me? He doesn't know what
[1:55:40] he's facing.
[1:55:43] If it's something else, why then? He
[1:55:45] says, "God can correct all wrong." I say
[1:55:48] to you, God can correct all wrong.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; God can correct all wrong.
[1:55:57] if she's not a Christian. He said if
[1:56:00] she's not a Christian, God knows that
[1:56:05] I don't.
[1:56:09] If she is a Christian, God knows I
[1:56:13] don't.
[1:56:15] And now he's here. And now he's here.
[1:56:22] Now in the name of Jesus
[1:56:26] Christ, this is implementation.
[1:56:30] The son of God, I take every spirit in
[1:56:32] here under my control for God's glory.
[1:56:37] You may say, why am I reading that?
[1:56:39] Because maybe you in your prayer closet,
[1:56:43] you have to say, Lord Jesus, I know
[1:56:46] you're here now.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; You have come and witnessed this to me.
[1:56:50] I take charge of every situation. I take
[1:56:54] charge of every spirit
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; that would come against me in the name
[1:56:58] of Jesus Christ and for the glory of
[1:57:01] God. Would you be afraid to do that? You
[1:57:04] may need to do that this morning.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Friends, we're not here to go out and
[1:57:09] have a picnic.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; We're here to go out and be soldiers.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; What I'm seeking to do now is to arm
[1:57:14] you.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; I take every spirit in here under my
[1:57:26] control for God's glory. And now faith
[1:57:29] begins to act. Listen very close. Now
[1:57:34] faith I this implementation
[1:57:37] number one.
[1:57:39] Now, he said, "You're conscious
[1:57:43] that something's going on."
[1:57:45] And you may be sitting right here in
[1:57:47] this service.
[1:57:49] I'm not a prophet or a son of a prophet,
[1:57:51] but I have a witness to this message.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; And you maybe have sat in a lot of
[1:57:56] services, but you're saying, "This is
[1:57:59] different.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; God is speaking to me."
[1:58:03] And he said, "Now you're conscious that
[1:58:05] something's going on." That's number
[1:58:07] one.
[1:58:09] Number two, he announced you're in his
[1:58:13] presence.
[1:58:14] And somebody here, I'm not a I'm not
[1:58:16] hesitant. I'm not not apologetic to say
[1:58:20] you are in his presence.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; And number three,
[1:58:26] you know that something's happened just
[1:58:29] then and that was him.
[1:58:34] How does he know it's him?
[1:58:38] Now it's coming to me. Now it's coming
[1:58:41] to me. That's number four. And you are a
[1:58:44] Christian. Now he knows it. And you are
[1:58:48] a Christian.
[1:58:52] And the Lord bless you.
[1:58:55] Your trouble is in the stomach.
[1:59:00] And it's some kind of a growth. That's
[1:59:03] number six. and some kind of a growth in
[1:59:06] there, a lump in your stomach, a growth,
[1:59:08] a tumor.
[1:59:13] You're in you're in need of an
[1:59:16] operation. Number seven, but only God
[1:59:19] alone can make it for you. Is that the
[1:59:23] truth? You know, she's at the end of the
[1:59:25] road
[1:59:27] now. Whatever what taken place just now,
[1:59:30] whatever it was that's on me knows your
[1:59:35] life
[1:59:36] now. It's not just your stomach knows
[1:59:38] your life.
[1:59:41] Everyone's on me now knows you and it
[1:59:45] knows me.
[1:59:49] And I'm so submitted. Here's the key.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; I wanted to give the church a key.
[1:59:56] And I'm so submitted
[2:00:00] to it till I have no control of my own
[2:00:04] self. It controls me now.
[2:00:09] Friends, I'd like to tell you,
[2:00:13] I wish that this was in practice every
[2:00:14] day in our lives or in my life, but
[2:00:18] there have been times even recently
[2:00:25] where you make a decision that makes no
[2:00:28] sense.
[2:00:30] The world would never make that kind of
[2:00:32] a decision. If I don't dare go out and
[2:00:35] ask any advice because the advice would
[2:00:37] turn me completely away
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; from what I feel in my heart that I must
[2:00:41] do. I must do it. And it comes down
[2:00:44] where the rubber hits the road.
[2:00:56] I don't know whether I should tell some
[2:00:57] of these things or not.
[2:01:00] We sometimes sit here in the blessings
[2:01:02] of God,
[2:01:07] but we don't know where the blessings
[2:01:08] come from.
[2:01:10] But I feel sometime you need to know
[2:01:24] He said, "You've got someone,
[2:01:26] some loved one you're interested in
[2:01:30] or something."
[2:01:32] Number 13. Somebody's got something with
[2:01:34] a foot. Isn't that right? It's in a cast
[2:01:40] or something.
[2:01:41] It's your husband
[2:01:44] and he's got his toes are broken or
[2:01:47] something. Isn't that right? What do you
[2:01:50] have Elijah
[2:01:53] sent to a person to try to inspire their
[2:01:57] faith and tell him you have a husband
[2:02:00] and I his foot's in a cast and his toes
[2:02:03] are broken?
[2:02:07] God almighty, is this what you're doing?
[2:02:10] Amen.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Telling a poor little woman her
[2:02:14] husband's got his foot in a cast and he
[2:02:17] broke his toes.
[2:02:21] Listen friends, this is a simplicity.
[2:02:24] Don't stumble over it.
[2:02:34] And I see a streak of darkness.
[2:02:37] This is probably where she wouldn't want
[2:02:39] anybody to go. Said, "I see a streak of
[2:02:42] darkness
[2:02:44] standing between you all. You're ha
[2:02:47] you're having domestic troubles."
[2:02:51] Isn't that right? Some sort of trouble
[2:02:53] between you and you're worried about it.
[2:02:57] And by the way, you you all are
[2:03:00] separated or something.
[2:03:03] There's something between you and and
[2:03:05] that you all have separated. Is that
[2:03:09] true?
[2:03:11] 18 things and he ends up with probably
[2:03:15] the closest thing. And another thing
[2:03:17] that's on your heart, your husband,
[2:03:19] you're separated. You're having marital
[2:03:21] problems. You're separated.
[2:03:24] So, you're worried about that. In fact,
[2:03:26] is you are separated.
[2:03:31] Was that the end? No, that wasn't the
[2:03:33] end. Well, come here.
[2:03:38] What an invitation.
[2:03:40] What an invitation. Is this all true?
[2:03:42] Yes, it's all true. We'll come here.
[2:03:47] This is implementing
[2:03:49] the one phrase. He said it and I
[2:03:53] believed it.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; He's not implementing anything. He said
[2:03:59] Jesus didn't use of all of his glorious
[2:04:01] gifts. He didn't use any when he came
[2:04:04] against Satan. He just said, "It is
[2:04:07] written."
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; You got a mouth.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear it say, "It is
[2:04:12] written."
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; It is written.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; It is written.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; It is written.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Would you say that, please?
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; It is written. And say one more phrase.
[2:04:19] I believe it.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; He has said it. And I believe it.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; That's your greatest weapon.
[2:04:27] [Music]
[2:04:30] That's your greatest weapon. How long
[2:04:32] shall I confess it? He said, "Confess it
[2:04:35] till you believe it."
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; And if you died and left this world
[2:04:41] confessing it, you'll have been done the
[2:04:44] best thing you could possibly do.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Well, come here now,
[2:04:54] master of life.
[2:04:57] While you're standing so close and so
[2:05:00] present to do your great miracle work, I
[2:05:04] bless this woman who stands here for
[2:05:07] every need that she has need of. May it
[2:05:11] be met this night. I pronounce this
[2:05:14] blessing upon the upon under the
[2:05:17] anointing of your holy spirit in the
[2:05:19] name of Jesus Christ your son that our
[2:05:23] sister you will receive what you what
[2:05:26] she has asked for. Amen. And God bless
[2:05:30] you sister. God be with you and bless
[2:05:33] you and help you and give you everything
[2:05:36] that you have asked for. This is a
[2:05:38] person now who has come against all of
[2:05:41] these demons of hell.
[2:05:43] demons of sickness,
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; marital trouble and affliction, all of
[2:05:48] these things, and a tumor in her stomach
[2:05:50] seeking to take her life. Here comes us.
[2:05:52] Here comes a Joshua
[2:05:55] in the form of William Brham, Jesus
[2:05:59] savior to say, "Come here. I'm going to
[2:06:02] bless you."
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Does God have the answer?
[2:06:08] has every answer. For young fellows, for
[2:06:12] teenagers, for elderly people, for you
[2:06:15] families, God has the answer for every
[2:06:18] situation.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; And either that God will perform his
[2:06:24] word
[2:06:25] or we die confessing it
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; or this book is not true.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; I say this book is true.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; I say this is God's word.
[2:06:41] You know, friends, I'm going to close,
[2:06:45] but we have, and I'm far from over,
[2:06:50] but these kings,
[2:06:53] the king of all of these kings, the
[2:06:56] prince of the power of the air,
[2:06:59] has the audacity to come to your Lord,
[2:07:02] to your savior, and say, "Bow down, all
[2:07:06] worship me.
[2:07:09] He doesn't he doesn't know any shame.
[2:07:12] He's not hesitant to come to you and sew
[2:07:14] a seed of doubt. He's not hesitant at
[2:07:17] all to come to you in some nice
[2:07:20] accepting way and try to persuade you.
[2:07:34] You need to identify your enemy.
[2:07:37] I said that last week. You need to
[2:07:39] identify him. You need to identify your
[2:07:42] leader.
[2:07:43] What you're under. I'm under the Lord
[2:07:46] Jesus Christ. It wasn't William Brandham
[2:07:48] that brought this message. I can tell
[2:07:50] you one thing for sure. It wasn't
[2:07:51] William Brandham that said these 18
[2:07:53] things. 18 things. 5, 10, 15, and three.
[2:07:58] 18 specific things to one woman that she
[2:08:02] might believe. And that was not
[2:08:04] exclusively. He was going back 2,000
[2:08:07] years. He said he had one scripture and
[2:08:10] he believed it.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; He spoke to me and I believed him.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; That's the key. That's the key. And all
[2:08:18] you need to say, and I say with
[2:08:20] everything that's in me, identify your
[2:08:22] leader. Say, "He spoke to me and I
[2:08:25] believe him."
[2:08:29] Hallelujah.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; And you can have
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; you can have it. It's that simple.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; We can't pamper with him. As long as you
[2:08:41] pamper with him, he'll stay on your he
[2:08:43] stay on your back.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; You have every right to say, "Get behind
[2:08:48] me,
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Satan. You have no part of my home. You
[2:08:52] have no part of my life.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; You're not going to dictate to me.
[2:09:00] Be aggressive.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:31] I'm going to close now.
[2:09:40] Pilate.
[2:09:44] I know well because I thought that this
[2:09:46] might be in the minds of some. He come
[2:09:49] as son of man, son of God, and son of
[2:09:51] David,
[2:09:53] prophet, priest, and king. And brother
[2:09:55] Brown said he's king to the Jews.
[2:09:59] But he's king of kings.
[2:10:02] When he was born, the angel Gabriel told
[2:10:05] that he would be on the throne of David,
[2:10:07] his father.
[2:10:09] But the wise men came and wanted to know
[2:10:11] where the king was born. And that
[2:10:13] disturbed him.
[2:10:15] And then when it came to the time of his
[2:10:17] crucifixion, Pilate said, "Art thou a
[2:10:21] king?" He said, "Thou sayest it, and to
[2:10:24] this end was I born."
[2:10:29] And they put over his over his cross
[2:10:32] Jesus, the king of the Jews.
[2:10:36] They didn't leaders didn't like it. take
[2:10:38] that down. They said, "What I've
[2:10:40] written?" Pilot said, "I've written."
[2:10:43] He had a horrific thing even happening
[2:10:45] in his household. His wife had terrible
[2:10:48] dreams for this man said, "I've had
[2:10:52] dreams have nothing to do with this."
[2:10:54] But he blundered on anyway and washed
[2:10:56] his hands, said, "Art thou a king? Thou
[2:11:00] sayest it."
[2:11:04] We don't come with some kind of royalty.
[2:11:07] We're not coming with some kind of
[2:11:08] fineries.
[2:11:10] We come in our simplicity.
[2:11:13] Listen friends, you're sitting here in
[2:11:14] nice pews.
[2:11:17] This man sat when I was working, when I
[2:11:20] had a business
[2:11:22] before this church was established, and
[2:11:25] some of you were here. A few of you were
[2:11:29] here at that time. And we had planks to
[2:11:32] sit on with blocks of wood under it. And
[2:11:36] the planks were not planed. And I sat on
[2:11:39] those planks and I thought, wouldn't it
[2:11:42] be interesting for the bank managers and
[2:11:45] the big people downtown to see me now?
[2:11:50] But here's where here's where
[2:11:53] my son-in-law Ken Ardo was saved in that
[2:11:57] place. My son-in-law Tom Ray was saved
[2:12:01] in that place.
[2:12:03] And I tell you what, friends, this God,
[2:12:06] he's not he's not interested in just,
[2:12:08] you know, fine nice little things. He
[2:12:11] does things in his own way. And I have
[2:12:13] perhaps never told this to most of you
[2:12:15] anyway, but
[2:12:18] somebody just gave great praises to God
[2:12:22] enough to scare anybody.
[2:12:25] And I walked over to Kim just a few
[2:12:27] steps and I said,
[2:12:29] "Do you think this is for you?"
[2:12:33] He said, "I think so."
[2:12:37] I said, "Would you like to pray?"
[2:12:40] I said, "I think I would."
[2:12:43] I said, "Why don't you kneel here?"
[2:12:45] There's a old kitchen chair. He said,
[2:12:47] "Right here." They don't do that in his
[2:12:49] church. He was the organist from the
[2:12:52] church right across the street.
[2:12:55] And my neighbor was a choir leader.
[2:12:59] The lady who lived next door was a choir
[2:13:01] leader. And they would have choir
[2:13:02] practice. And now he's he's in this
[2:13:05] chair. He said, "Right here?" I said,
[2:13:07] "Yeah, right here." He turned around,
[2:13:09] knelt at the chair. I'll never forget
[2:13:12] it. He took a hold of the rungs of the
[2:13:14] chair up here was hanging onto them.
[2:13:20] And I laid my hand on his back and begin
[2:13:22] to pray.
[2:13:25] And I have to be honest with you. I
[2:13:27] wondered is this is anything going to
[2:13:30] happen?
[2:13:32] Is anything going to take place here?
[2:13:36] Everything was And then I I I felt his
[2:13:39] body
[2:13:41] shaking like that and I actually opened
[2:13:44] my eyes and he was convulsing in tears.
[2:13:49] It had to happen.
[2:13:51] There has to come a time of yielding.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; And his hands while he tried to hang on
[2:13:56] to the to I watched his hands as he
[2:13:59] tried desperately to hang on to the
[2:14:02] rungs of the chair, but they slid to the
[2:14:05] bottom and finally his chest.
[2:14:09] That's Kenneth Ardal. His chest was on
[2:14:12] the chair.
[2:14:16] He was born again
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; that day. And nothing has changed from
[2:14:22] that day to this.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Has it all been easy? It's not all easy.
[2:14:27] That's not what we're here for. We're
[2:14:28] here for truth.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; All I can tell you that Bible works.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; The word of God works.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; I challenge you in the name of Jesus
[2:14:38] Christ.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; And it's worked for others.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; And if there's anybody here that's just
[2:14:50] hanging on the balance, don't even wait
[2:14:52] another second.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; I'd give myself unreservedly. I'd say
[2:14:56] that's my God.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; And he has spoken
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; and I feel his presence and I'm willing
[2:15:03] to yield myself and give myself to it
[2:15:06] completely. And what the future is I
[2:15:09] know not.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; I agree.
[2:15:15] Amen.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:15:23] I sense and feel that this is the time
[2:15:26] to bow our heads
[2:15:28] and bow our hearts. And I do not know
[2:15:31] what you have in store.
[2:15:34] I do not know what it is you want to do,
[2:15:38] but I ask that you'll do
[2:15:41] things that need to be done,
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; lives that need to be changed.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; May it take place, oh God. And I'll say,
[2:15:51] Lord Jesus, all for you,
[2:15:54] all for your glory,
[2:15:56] that you might be praised.
[2:15:59] I want to say before this congregation
[2:16:01] of people,
[2:16:03] this angel of the Lord that spoke
[2:16:07] through this vessel, I have believed
[2:16:10] him.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; I believe him.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; I believe you're the same God. And I've
[2:16:17] seen you come down over the years. I've
[2:16:20] seen you protect us. I've seen you pre
[2:16:23] preserve us. I've seen you bless, oh
[2:16:26] God, those that didn't feel they were
[2:16:28] worthy, but you blessed them. You've
[2:16:30] given healing, Father. You have given
[2:16:33] miracles one after the other. And I'm
[2:16:36] standing here tonight to give you praise
[2:16:38] and to give you glory and to thank you
[2:16:41] for all that you have done and all that
[2:16:43] you yet will do.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; I wonder if someone
[2:16:54] I don't need you to stand. I don't need
[2:16:57] you to do anything. But maybe you need
[2:16:59] to stand.
[2:17:01] Maybe you need to just say,
[2:17:04] "I've stood opposed
[2:17:08] too long
[2:17:11] and I've just allowed Satan to
[2:17:14] bat banter me around.
[2:17:18] Somehow this morning,
[2:17:20] I see and I hear. I see it clearly. I
[2:17:24] see it in Joshua's day. I see the people
[2:17:26] that he took in. I see it in the day of
[2:17:29] Jesus. And it wasn't always easy for
[2:17:32] them to take their inheritance. And I
[2:17:34] see it in the prophet's ministry. It
[2:17:36] wasn't always easy, but he showed us.
[2:17:39] And I see it very, very clearly the
[2:17:41] principle of simply believing. And I
[2:17:44] believed him. Oh God, let all doubt in
[2:17:49] the name of Jesus Christ, we take the
[2:17:51] sword of the spirit against a demon, a
[2:17:54] doubt that would try to invade the
[2:17:56] believer's homes and the believer's
[2:17:59] lives. And Satan, I declare that you are
[2:18:01] a liar and the father of lies. And you
[2:18:05] have no place within this message. You
[2:18:08] have no place within this congregation.
[2:18:12] You have no place. And I say to those
[2:18:14] that have confessed your name, bless, oh
[2:18:17] God. Bless now these homes. Bless these
[2:18:20] lives. Bless the single people, oh God.
[2:18:24] Bless each one in the name of Jesus
[2:18:27] Christ. Bless those that may be in need
[2:18:29] of healing. Bless those that are in need
[2:18:32] of deliverance. Blessing, oh God, I pray
[2:18:36] upon them.
[2:18:38] You've invited us. Now come here. We
[2:18:42] draw near to you.
[2:18:44] Thank you, Father.
[2:18:47] Thank you, Father.
[2:18:49] Now, my instruction to you,
[2:18:53] it's whatever he has said,
[2:18:56] just do it.
[2:18:58] Just believe him and do it.
[2:19:04] [Music]
[2:19:09] Thank you, Father.
[2:19:12] Will you stand with me?
[2:19:21] Hallelujah.
[2:19:28] What if we could sing?
[2:19:32] I'm giving myself away. Do we sing that?
[2:19:39] [Music]
[2:19:42] Brother Ryan can sing this and you can
[2:19:44] join in. I'm giving myself away
[2:19:49] on the altar.
[2:19:54] Now I'm giving my life
[2:19:58] away.
[2:20:03] laying it down on the altar.
[2:20:08] Now I'm giving my life away.
[2:20:13] [Music]
[2:20:16] The very least I can offer
[2:20:21] is my all.
[2:20:27] So here I stand today
[2:20:32] giving my life
[2:20:37] once again please
[2:20:40] and now I'm giving my life
[2:20:45] away.
[2:20:48] Lay it down on the altar.
[2:20:53] Now I'm giving my life away.
[2:21:01] The very least I can offer
[2:21:06] is my all.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; So here I stand today
[2:21:17] giving my life away.
[2:21:23] with your with your head bowed and just
[2:21:27] reverently.
[2:21:28] I sense that there's perhaps some
[2:21:31] struggling with I've tried so many
[2:21:34] times. Put that out of your vocabulary.
[2:21:37] Put it out of your mind right now
[2:21:40] saying, "Lord, you have come. You have
[2:21:44] given so vivid, so clear, and by God's
[2:21:47] grace, I sought to speak it as clearly
[2:21:50] and slowly as possible that you might
[2:21:53] you might be able to not only grasp, but
[2:21:56] take in and implement.
[2:22:00] Bring it into your own soul.
[2:22:04] Give yourself away to him. Say, I'm
[2:22:07] going to yield to the spirit of God. And
[2:22:10] if the spirit of God has spoken to you
[2:22:12] today, now I'm going to just take a
[2:22:13] moment and and that you might have this
[2:22:16] opportunity to yield yourself to him.
[2:22:19] Families, I have a special place in my
[2:22:22] heart just now for families. You here
[2:22:24] with young children. And I know the
[2:22:27] struggles of that. And I know that what
[2:22:30] you perhaps go through, do not think
[2:22:33] that, oh, we've tried before. I've tried
[2:22:36] before. Whatever you do, whether it's
[2:22:39] the job or whether it is the marital
[2:22:43] thing or whatever it might be,
[2:22:46] don't be ashamed. This woman that came
[2:22:49] and stood before the prophet of God,
[2:22:50] you're not standing before only just a
[2:22:53] prophet of God. Standing in the
[2:22:54] presence, now you're in his presence.
[2:22:57] And I want to say to this congregation
[2:23:00] because I sense it. I sense him. Now
[2:23:03] you're in his presence. He's here to
[2:23:06] actually transform and change lives.
[2:23:09] He's here to do what you cannot do.
[2:23:13] I'm giving myself away.
[2:23:15] Will you sing it again, please, Brother
[2:23:17] Ryan? You may want to raise your hand.
[2:23:20] You may want to dedicate yourself
[2:23:22] however you feel. I won't tell you how
[2:23:24] to do it. You just make it make it
[2:23:27] evident. Let the Lord know that you're
[2:23:29] here to do business with him.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:23:37] Now I'm giving my life
[2:23:41] away.
[2:23:45] Laying it down on the altar.
[2:23:50] Now I'm giving my life away.
[2:23:56] [Music]
[2:23:58] The very least I can offer
[2:24:03] is my all.
[2:24:10] So here I stand today
[2:24:15] giving my life
[2:24:17] away.
[2:24:21] giving my life away.
[2:24:27] I'm laying it down on the altar.
[2:24:32] Now I'm giving my life away.
[2:24:40] The very least I can offer
[2:24:45] is my all.
[2:24:50] all. So here I stand today.
[2:24:55] [Music]
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Only Jesus. Only Jesus. Only Jesus. Lord
[2:25:05] Jesus, you're the only one that can
[2:25:07] satisfy. You're the only one that can
[2:25:09] fill the empty void. You're the only one
[2:25:14] that can pour on the blessings. You're
[2:25:17] the only one. Help us, Father, in the
[2:25:20] name of your son, Jesus Christ, to
[2:25:23] inherit the full measure of this
[2:25:26] glorious word that you have sent. Some
[2:25:29] need, I know that there's a great need
[2:25:32] of revelation of your word, Lord. And
[2:25:35] I'm praying, oh God, create in me a
[2:25:39] hunger for your word. Create in the
[2:25:42] people a hunger for your word, for the
[2:25:45] voice of the hour, the message of the
[2:25:48] hour. Live, live, live in us, oh God.
[2:25:52] Remove every obstacle. Remove every
[2:25:55] hindrance. Oh God, remove every doubt
[2:25:58] and demon spirit that would bring the
[2:26:01] lack of self-esteem. Let the people rise
[2:26:04] and claim what they are. I'm a daughter
[2:26:07] of the most high God. I'm a son of the
[2:26:10] most high God. Hallelujah. I shall walk
[2:26:13] through life with my shoulders back and
[2:26:16] determined to walk for him with him.
[2:26:19] Father, in the name of Jesus, I pray
[2:26:22] you'll put such a put such a
[2:26:25] resolve within the people. Oh, glory to
[2:26:29] Claude. Yes. Grant it, Father. Grant it,
[2:26:33] Father. Grant it, Father. In the name of
[2:26:38] Jesus. In the name of Jesus.
[2:26:42] All hail.
[2:26:44] Glory to Jesus. Can we sing also? All
[2:26:47] hail King Jesus. All hail Emmanuel.

[2:27:22] my morning star
[2:27:27] and throughout
[2:27:30] eternity
[2:27:33] I'm going to praise him

[2:28:16] I want to praise his name
[2:28:21] and forever. ever
[2:28:25] I will reign with him.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; I sense I sense the Lord just speaking
[2:28:35] to me and saying there's a number of
[2:28:38] people here that are asking, "What would
[2:28:41] you have me to do?"
[2:28:44] Lord Jesus, what would you have me to
[2:28:46] do?
[2:28:49] Lord Jesus,
[2:28:51] master, king of our lives,
[2:28:56] king of our lives.
[2:28:59] Lord Jesus, king of my life, I crown
[2:29:01] thee now. And I'm praying on behalf of
[2:29:05] these
[2:29:06] that are holding this question in their
[2:29:08] heart. What would you have me to do? And
[2:29:12] if you're one of those, why don't you
[2:29:14] just speak that to him now in prayer?
[2:29:17] Lord, that's exactly what I've been
[2:29:20] saying. What would you have me to do?
[2:29:23] And now I ask, oh eternal one, that you
[2:29:27] will make clear your will. You'll make
[2:29:30] clear your voice. You'll make clear your
[2:29:34] presence. And I pray that even before
[2:29:37] they walk out of this sanctuary today,
[2:29:40] they will know that you heard them and
[2:29:43] you are answering them and you will give
[2:29:45] them a clear-cut answer, oh God, in the
[2:29:49] name of Jesus Christ, that they might
[2:29:51] know what decision they are to make that
[2:29:53] they might know what exactly what they
[2:29:55] are to do. And you may show them
[2:29:57] something that they have not even yet
[2:29:59] seen. and make the way clear, make the
[2:30:02] path clear, make the footsteps. And
[2:30:05] Lord, we don't have to see way far
[2:30:07] ahead, but may we just see a footstep
[2:30:09] ahead of us. And as the prophet of God
[2:30:12] has said, a bloodstained footprint, and
[2:30:15] we'll follow it, Lord. I'm following
[2:30:18] you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:30:22] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[2:30:25] Lord Jesus.
[2:30:28] I don't know if Brother Ryan if you know
[2:30:30] this, but I want to sing as a testimony

[2:34:39] [Music]
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads now. Our dear
[2:34:46] heavenly father, we have heard the word
[2:34:49] of God.
[2:34:51] And Lord, from the youngest to the
[2:34:53] oldest, Lord, we can truly say the King
[2:34:55] of Kings himself
[2:34:57] has come and spoken deeply to our
[2:35:00] hearts.
[2:35:01] And Lord, we just want to say, Lord, be
[2:35:04] Lord of every corner and crevice. We
[2:35:07] open every door to our hearts that you
[2:35:10] will guide us and lead us in your
[2:35:12] perfect will. Father, we've heard the
[2:35:15] word and now we want to implement that
[2:35:17] word within our lives. We want to do a
[2:35:20] consecration this morning. We want Lord
[2:35:23] you to live supreme. We want you to take
[2:35:26] control. We want the word to be
[2:35:28] preeminent. We want the Holy Spirit to
[2:35:31] anoint us. Lord, we want to take thus,
[2:35:34] sayeth the Lord this morning, and apply
[2:35:36] it to our lives. So, Father, as we have
[2:35:40] thirsted, you have filled us. Where
[2:35:42] we've hungered, Lord, we can say we've
[2:35:44] ate from your table. We pray, God, that
[2:35:47] you will go with each and every one of
[2:35:49] us. Let the spirit of God watch over our
[2:35:52] families on the road. We will come
[2:35:54] tonight expecting, Lord, to hear from
[2:35:57] the throne of grace one more time. Lord,
[2:36:00] we just pray that the blanket of your
[2:36:02] glory will rest upon us as we give our
[2:36:06] lives to you and say, "Use us, Lord."
[2:36:09] Whatever God you have for us this year,
[2:36:12] we want to consecrate ourselves and
[2:36:15] dedicate ourselves. Say, "Lord, use me."
[2:36:18] If you have to take the coal from off
[2:36:20] the altar, burn out the sin within our
[2:36:23] lives, let the Holy Ghost reign supreme.
[2:36:26] Lord, we're willing to say, "Here am I.
[2:36:29] send me. Use us for the glory of God. Go
[2:36:34] with us now. And Father, may your
[2:36:36] blessing be upon us as we commit now the
[2:36:39] service to you. Bring us back with
[2:36:41] expecting hearts as our dear brother
[2:36:43] Kyle will be ministering. We pray you'll
[2:36:46] anoint your servant one more time. We
[2:36:48] ask this in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God
[2:36:53] bless you. Greet one another. You're
[2:36:57] dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:37:00] Amen.
