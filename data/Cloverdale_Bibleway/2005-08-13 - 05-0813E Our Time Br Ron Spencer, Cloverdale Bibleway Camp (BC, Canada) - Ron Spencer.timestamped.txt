[4:18] Some of you are going to be singing with
[4:19] brother Sam Adam. So I don't know some
[4:22] of you are sitting down are going to
[4:23] sing with him. But brother Sam, why
[4:24] don't you come
[4:26] and those who are going to be singing
[4:27] with you come and get ready. Let's sing.
[4:28] Know ye not. Know ye not. You are a
[4:31] temple.
[4:56] When I wake up in the morning and think
[5:00] of the great things
[5:05] God has done for me
[5:10] in my heart there, That's rejoicing
[5:15] to think that a new day
[5:21] has dawn on me.
[5:25] For the glorious mysteries in God's word
[5:31] that he
[5:34] has allowed me to share.
[5:41] It's only an indication
[5:45] of his great love.
[5:49] How much he cares.
[5:54] I feel
[6:17] down
[6:18] in this day
[6:23] on me.
[6:28] There's only things that were days that
[6:32] are that day.
[6:36] things that ought to be.
[6:42] What has been made from the eyes of the
[6:44] wise and the prudent he has revealed
[6:50] onto his own.
[6:56] Well, it's a message of preparation
[7:01] to take us
[7:04] to God eternal
[7:09] life
[7:10] praise.
[7:22] Yeah.
[7:26] Heat.
[7:53] See all her standing borders
[8:00] to swallow up humanity.
[8:09] I think that I'm one in a million chosen
[8:14] by God
[8:16] to send in this evil day.
[8:23] It's only an indication
[8:27] of his great love,
[8:31] how much he cares.
[8:35] Heat. Heat.
[8:53] I feel like
[9:01] you
[9:11] feel like this. Yeah.
[9:21] Heat.
[9:41] Well, God bless you. It's one thing to
[9:44] praise him with our lips,
[9:46] praise him with our lives,
[9:49] praise him with our giving.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; We announced that we would be receiving
[9:54] a a missionary offering tonight for
[9:56] missions. We had a expense offering. I
[9:59] don't know what it was last night, but
[10:01] the night before was about 1,100 US and
[10:04] about 1,4500
[10:06] Canadian. And we're very very thankful
[10:09] to you uh for that. Uh we certainly
[10:13] we're trying to give the people here and
[10:17] especially the young people. It's going
[10:19] to be a full seven days. Yeah. Seven and
[10:22] a half days. It gets almost eight days,
[10:24] isn't it?
[10:26] &gt;&gt; Seven days. Seven days, eight nights.
[10:30] And we have we have a little
[10:31] technicality here because we we signed
[10:33] an agreement for seven days, but it
[10:34] didn't say eight nights. So, uh anyhow,
[10:38] we had to pay a little bit extra. But we
[10:40] don't mind paying a little bit extra
[10:42] because we feel as though it's important
[10:45] to give God's people and to give God uh
[10:49] the best that we have.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; And we are thankful for this camp. I I'm
[10:54] going to ask the young people, how are
[10:55] you enjoying the food?
[11:05] I've been at quite a number of camps now
[11:08] uh over the last 20 years and I found
[11:10] that in some of the camps we had when
[11:12] our people when our sisters weren't
[11:14] cooking, our brothers, uh they they
[11:17] would miss the odd meal. I haven't seen
[11:19] anybody missing any of the meals here.
[11:21] And right from the dessert to the salad
[11:24] to the main course, it has just been
[11:26] really something special. Uh where we
[11:29] have the tent set up, everything seems
[11:32] to be just very, very fine. The facility
[11:34] is real fine. We're thankful that God
[11:37] made this possible for us. And you know
[11:39] that we signed it for five years if the
[11:41] Lord carries. But the way the camp's
[11:44] going, uh I doubt if we even have five
[11:46] years. This is the second one. We only
[11:48] have three more after this one on this
[11:50] site. But the way the camp's been going
[11:52] and the way the word has been coming,
[11:54] the literally the way it's been
[11:56] preached,
[11:58] I I I would I'd be surprised. I was
[12:00] after midnight. I left here last night
[12:02] and there's probably 200 people yet here
[12:04] in the tent. And I was leaving at 11:00
[12:08] and they said there's a young man
[12:09] praying and I there was still uh there
[12:11] was two or three that were had been here
[12:14] and they'd been they had already been on
[12:16] the floor praying for an hour before
[12:18] God. God doing something. It wasn't some
[12:20] emotional thing. It was quiet. They were
[12:22] just
[12:24] &gt;&gt; uh God dealing with them and and God had
[12:27] already dealt with them in the past, but
[12:29] they were it was just something more
[12:31] that was happening. I believe in it,
[12:33] friends.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; I believe in it. I don't believe there's
[12:36] a in fact is I can assure you there's
[12:39] not one person here that has as much of
[12:41] God as they need. We all need more. And
[12:45] we we we need to make that confession
[12:48] and need to come with the expectation. I
[12:51] need it. He has it. And this is the
[12:53] place.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what we have and what we
[12:57] enjoy, we seek to allow others in other
[13:00] parts of the country that are real
[13:02] needy. And there are real needy people
[13:05] that number one don't have the message,
[13:08] don't have it available to them, maybe
[13:09] don't have the tapes or the discs or
[13:11] whatever more. Perhaps they don't have
[13:14] ministry. And there's just a wide range
[13:16] of of things that we uh uh not attempt
[13:20] to, but by God's grace and by the
[13:23] generosity of the people, God has always
[13:26] provided. And I know that he will. I
[13:28] would like the congregation, if you
[13:30] would here tonight, there's a good
[13:31] audience. We could give a real generous
[13:34] uh uh offering. And when you give
[13:37] tonight, I want you to think of somebody
[13:40] who doesn't have camp like this. Listen,
[13:43] there's been believers in Serbia for 20
[13:47] years, and we, Brother Milco and myself,
[13:50] went in there 20 years ago and brought
[13:53] the message into the former Yugoslavia.
[13:56] They've had civil war. We've got
[13:58] brothers sitting here in this
[14:00] congregation that had to fight. They
[14:02] were in the some of them in the army for
[14:05] four years. They know what I'm talking
[14:08] about. And God led them to himself and
[14:11] they came to know about Jesus Christ and
[14:13] his saving power. And it doesn't come by
[14:16] military might. It comes by Holy Ghost
[14:19] might. And there's been and they know
[14:21] how to appreciate what I'm saying. And
[14:23] this year was the first year they were
[14:26] able to have a gathering, a convention.
[14:29] They were so delighted. It was like they
[14:31] were in the millennium. They could FOR
[14:33] THE FIRST TIME they could get together.
[14:36] What would it be if uh brother and
[14:38] sister Haley down in in Boisee and some
[14:41] maybe down the Tri Cities, the Perkins
[14:43] and some up from Edmonton and whatever
[14:45] more and they they'd have their own
[14:47] little gatherings. But then uh finally
[14:49] an opportunity comes and we've been
[14:51] looking for it for 20 years. We've been
[14:53] having it every year for 20 years.
[14:56] They've never had it and now for the
[14:58] first time they were been looking
[15:00] forward to it and have it 20 years to
[15:04] contribute a little bit to help them and
[15:06] we're helping them right now print print
[15:08] some messages they haven't been getting
[15:09] them. I think it's a worthy cause.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what friends, I'll never
[15:14] never I'll never never worry about that.
[15:16] I hold a message in my hand. And when I
[15:19] hold that message in my hand and realize
[15:22] THAT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO PUT THIS
[15:24] MESSAGE IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S HAND THAT
[15:27] otherwise couldn't get it, to me it's a
[15:29] most worthy thing. That's a lot. Can you
[15:31] say amen to that?
[15:33] &gt;&gt; And that's what we'll be giving tonight.
[15:35] You might say, "Well, I haven't got my
[15:36] checkbook and I haven't got I didn't
[15:38] come prepared. Put an IOU in it." But
[15:41] don't forget to sign your name
[15:45] so we know who that I owe you belongs
[15:47] to. But you might not. That's fine. We
[15:49] we I've got a couple already. I It's
[15:52] just great. I sooner have an I owe you
[15:54] than I don't owe you anything.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; You might say, "I never heard brother
[16:03] Bisll take up an offering like this." We
[16:05] up here in the north, we don't know how
[16:07] to take up offerings. But I've been in
[16:08] the south long enough to been with
[16:10] brother Dan Dasley and a few of those
[16:12] folks, brother Tony down there, and I
[16:14] saw how they took up offering. I thought
[16:15] that works.
[16:19] That was almost a downer here. I said,
[16:21] "That really works."
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:25] And I know God's people believe in
[16:27] giving. I just want to read these
[16:28] scriptures while the brothers, while the
[16:30] deacons come forward, would you please?
[16:33] Wherefore, this is 1 Chronicles 29.
[16:36] Wherefore David blessed the Lord before
[16:38] all the congregation. And David said,
[16:41] "Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel,
[16:44] our father, forever and ever." Thine, O
[16:47] Lord, is the greatness and the power.
[16:49] Can we say amen?
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the
[16:54] power and the glory and the victory and
[16:56] the majesty. For all that is in the
[16:59] heaven and in the earth is thine. Thine
[17:03] is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art
[17:05] exalted as head above all, both riches
[17:09] and honor come of thee. And thou
[17:12] reignest over all, and in thine hand is
[17:16] power and might, and in thine hand it is
[17:19] to make great, and to give strength unto
[17:21] all.
[17:23] Listen to this. It is thine hand is
[17:27] power and might and in thine hand it is
[17:31] to make great and to give strength unto
[17:34] all. Now therefore, oh God, we thank
[17:37] thee and praise thy glorious name. Amen.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; It's him. And then this 14th verse, but
[17:45] who am I? And what is my people that we
[17:49] should be able to offer so willingly
[17:53] after this sort? For all things come of
[17:58] thee. The breath you're breathing is not
[18:00] your own. The sun shone on you today
[18:03] free of charge. The air that you
[18:06] breathed didn't cost you a thing. The
[18:10] food that we've eaten and all of this so
[18:12] on. Well, it yes, it cost a little bit,
[18:14] a little bit of energy, a little bit of
[18:16] strength and so on so forth. But the
[18:19] salvation and the blessings, how many
[18:21] here, I just want you to raise your
[18:23] hand, were here last night and were
[18:26] immensely blessed.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; It comes from him. Amen.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; And then now what you have in your hand
[18:36] or what you have of your resources, what
[18:39] David said, it has come from you.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; That's what we ought to remember. It has
[18:44] come from him. And now we're going to
[18:46] ask God's blessing upon the giving.
[18:49] Heavenly Father,
[18:51] without any shame or apology,
[18:54] we come at this moment to be able to
[18:57] give. And it is indeed a great honor and
[19:00] privilege that we can share something of
[19:03] the uh of the generosity that you have
[19:06] shown to us and now that we would be
[19:09] able to share it with someone in Africa
[19:12] or in China, in Yugoslavia, in India or
[19:16] in Brazil or in Mosmbique that has had
[19:20] such a a dirt FOR THE MESSAGE. OH GOD.
[19:24] AND I SEE THOSE EYES HOW THEY WILL
[19:27] glisten when they have a little packet
[19:30] of messages that are put into their
[19:32] hands. Oh God. AND SOME MINISTER WHO WHO
[19:35] IS SO EARNESTLY DESIRING TO bring
[19:38] something to his PEOPLE AND HE'S HEARD
[19:40] IT perhaps by his ear, but now he would
[19:43] be able to have it in his hand and to
[19:45] study. And what good reports we have
[19:47] heard when the men of God have got the
[19:50] word of God into their hands. How the
[19:53] how the how the scriptures have opened
[19:55] up to them. And now, Father, I pray you
[19:57] will anoint the people in their giving.
[20:00] That you'll bless them in their giving.
[20:01] And these young people, oh God, I pray
[20:03] that you will teach them this great
[20:06] glorious principle that IT'S MORE
[20:09] BLESSED TO give than it is to receive.
[20:13] We have received, but now we GIVE WITH
[20:16] THE LIBERALITY OF THE HOLY Spirit in
[20:19] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[20:22] bless you and bless you brothers as you
[20:24] give. I'm going to ask brother Jason if
[20:26] you'll come and I'd like to sing. God is
[20:28] in his people once again. The God that
[20:31] gave his son to die freely for us. That
[20:35] God is in his people once again.
[20:38] Hallelujah.
[20:40] God is in his people once again
[20:45] fulfilling all his promises he has been
[20:49] through the work of life to manifest the
[20:53] wonders of his glory again
[20:57] preparing for the day when we see no
[21:01] longer to this last self
[21:05] made his people once again so trusting
[21:10] faithful to the end. For God is in his
[21:14] peaceful once again, fulfilling all the
[21:18] promises he has sent. The truth, the
[21:21] word, the life manifest. The wonders of
[21:25] the glory getting blessed, preparing for
[21:29] the day when we see. No longer do this
[21:34] self.
[21:36] God is in his people once again. So we
[21:40] must be faithful to the end. Let's sing
[21:43] the first verse.
[21:46] First verse. There we go. These are
[21:48] troubled times,
[21:50] my friend. And so we must be faithful to
[21:54] the end, keeping perfect peace with our
[21:58] Lord and satisfying all his commands.
[22:03] striving till we reach our reward
[22:07] through the awesome power of his word.
[22:10] Oh, he's a troubled time, my friend. But
[22:15] God is in his people once again. Oh, God
[22:19] is in his people once again, fulfilling
[22:23] all the promises he has left. The truth
[22:27] the word the lie manifest the wonders of
[22:31] his glory again and bless caring for the
[22:35] day when we see no longer through this
[22:39] glass of self dark.
[22:42] God is in his people once again. So we
[22:46] must be faithful to the end.
[22:52] Amen.
[22:54] Well, I'm going to we're going to get
[22:56] ready to turn into tune to to the word
[22:57] right now. Uh I was at at home earlier
[23:01] or later before we just came to service
[23:03] and plugged in a CD that my wife had in
[23:05] the CD player and uh Sister Margaret
[23:08] sings that song, Speak to the Storm,
[23:10] Speak to the Rain. I've asked her if she
[23:11] could come and and sing it for us
[23:13] tonight. It's it's not only the course,
[23:15] but it's the verses that uh I think mean
[23:18] a lot of what we've been hearing from
[23:20] Brother Ron Spencer. Sister Margaret, if
[23:22] you'd come and get ready and brother
[23:24] John, if you can give her a little power
[23:26] above the music so they can hear those
[23:28] verses there. They're perfect. Why don't
[23:30] we sing as she comes and gets ready? Our
[23:32] Lord is so good. Our Lord is so good.
[23:36] Amen.
[23:49] Speak to
[23:55] Speak to the storm.
[23:59] Speak to the rain.
[24:02] You have the power
[24:05] to bring about a change.
[24:08] God has come in you.
[24:11] Now he speaks through you.
[24:14] Don't cry, my brother.
[24:17] Just speak in his name.
[24:21] Speak to the storm.
[24:23] Speak to the rain.
[24:26] You have the power
[24:29] to bring about a change.
[24:32] God has come in you
[24:35] now. He speaks through you.
[24:38] Don't cry, my sister.
[24:41] Just speak in his name.
[24:45] We're in a new season now. You have
[24:48] authority.
[24:51] God commands the devil to set your loved
[24:55] ones free. The third pole is here now.
[24:59] It can't be imitated.
[25:02] The power that's in the bride cannot be
[25:06] duplicated. Speak to the storm.
[25:11] Speak to the rain.
[25:14] You have the power
[25:16] to bring about a change.
[25:19] God has peace in you.
[25:22] Now he speaks through you.
[25:25] Don't cry, my brother. Just speak in his
[25:29] name.
[25:31] Satan's coming at you like a mighty
[25:35] lion's roar. But you don't have to take
[25:40] what he's doing anymore.
[25:42] Put on your fighting armor. Be confident
[25:47] and sure. There's no need to fear him.
[25:51] Tell him who you're standing for. Now
[25:53] speak to the storm.
[25:56] Speak to the rain.
[25:59] You have the power to bring about a
[26:03] change.
[26:05] God has come in you
[26:08] now. He speaks through you.
[26:10] Don't cry, my brother. Just speak in his
[26:14] name.
[26:16] Speak to the storm.
[26:19] Speak to the rain.
[26:21] You have the power
[26:24] to bring about a change.
[26:27] God has come in you.
[26:30] Now he speaks through you. Don't cry, my
[26:34] brother.
[26:35] Don't cry, my brother.
[26:38] Don't cry, my sister.
[26:40] Just speak in his name.
[26:53] Let's stand. We're going to receive our
[26:54] brother Ron Spencer. Not receive only
[26:57] the person
[26:59] uh the vessel, but now the Christ. You
[27:03] believe that Christ is here now?
[27:06] &gt;&gt; He is here indeed. We'll sing only
[27:10] believe only believe as our brother Ron
[27:13] Spencer comes and as you prepare your
[27:15] heart for expectation.
[27:20] Only
[27:22] believe.
[27:26] Only
[27:28] believe.
[27:32] All things
[27:34] are possible.
[27:38] Only
[27:46] believe.
[27:49] Holy
[27:51] meet.
[27:54] All things
[27:57] are possible.
[28:00] Glory.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Everyone look this way and let us sing.
[28:07] Jesus is here. If you wish to close your
[28:10] eyes, raise your hands. Do that if you
[28:12] wish. But sing it
[28:15] &gt;&gt; as your confession. I am believing
[28:19] &gt;&gt; with everything that's in me. I may not
[28:21] see it. I may not even feel it, but I
[28:25] say it because he said it.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; And our brother spoke last night. Draw
[28:30] the sword out.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Draw that one out.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; I'll draw one out. Where two or three
[28:36] Yes, sir.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; are gathered IN HIS NAME,
[28:39] &gt;&gt; THERE HE IS.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; How's that?
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Jesus is here.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; You young people with your voices lift
[28:50] it up.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[28:54] is here.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Here now. Jesus
[29:00] is here.
[29:03] All things are possible
[29:08] because Jesus
[29:10] is here.
[29:13] Jesus
[29:16] is here. I believe it. Lord Jesus
[29:21] is here.
[29:30] Jesus
[29:32] is
[29:34] &gt;&gt; one more time tonight. Jesus.
[29:41] Jesus
[29:44] is here.
[29:47] All things are
[29:52] Jesus.
[29:57] Jesus
[30:00] is
[30:03] Jesus.
[30:08] All things are possible.
[30:14] Jesus
[30:16] is here.
[30:20] Let us bow our heads to the Lord this
[30:22] evening.
[30:23] How many has a need yet tonight?
[30:27] Amen.
[30:29] Amen. I believe he's here to confirm his
[30:33] word.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:36] Lord Jesus, we bow our heads before you
[30:39] tonight
[30:41] and we thank you for what you have done.
[30:46] And Lord, we thank you tonight that
[30:48] we're aware that you're here.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just ask you that you would
[30:54] just come and anoint Clay tonight.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; May you anoint our lips,
[31:01] &gt;&gt; anoint our mind.
[31:03] Lord, I pray that the greatest gift that
[31:05] we can have tonight, both as hearer and
[31:09] speaker, is to get ourselves out of the
[31:11] way.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; And I pray that there would be a
[31:14] conference set here tonight. A
[31:17] conference between God and his wife. May
[31:22] you come in this building tonight,
[31:24] Father, under this tent. May you speak
[31:27] to our hearts. And Lord, may we reach
[31:30] beyond the veil tonight, beyond flesh.
[31:34] And I ask you that you would speak to
[31:36] our hearts, Lord Jesus, in a special
[31:39] way. In Jesus Christ's name we ask.
[31:43] Amen. And amen and amen. Amen. Had a
[31:47] good day.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every day with Jesus is sweeter
[31:52] than the day before.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:57] If you will turn with me this afternoon
[31:59] to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4
[32:06] to the bride of Jesus Christ. This is a
[32:09] very familiar portion of scripture
[32:15] and then we will look at Hebrews chapter
[32:18] 11 this evening.
[32:27] Paul is speaking to us.
[32:32] He says, "But I would not have you to be
[32:34] ignorant, brethren,
[32:36] concerning them which are asleep,
[32:39] that you sorrow not, even as others
[32:43] which have no hope.
[32:46] For if we believe
[32:49] that Jesus died and rose again,
[32:53] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[32:58] will God bring with him. For this we say
[33:02] unto you by the word of the Lord, that
[33:06] we which are alive and remain unto the
[33:10] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[33:13] them which are asleep. For the Lord
[33:16] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[33:20] shout and with a voice of the archangel
[33:23] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[33:26] in Christ shall rise first, and then we
[33:30] which are alive and remain shall be
[33:32] caught up together with them in the
[33:35] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
[33:38] so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[33:42] Hebrews chapter 11.
[34:02] Verse 33.
[34:06] who through faith subdued kingdoms,
[34:09] wrought righteousness, obtained
[34:12] promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
[34:15] quenched the violence of fire. He
[34:18] escaped the edge of the sword. Out of
[34:21] weaknesses were made strong, waxed
[34:24] valiant and fight, turned to flight the
[34:26] armies of the aliens. Women received
[34:29] their dead raised to life again. Others
[34:32] were tortured, not accepting
[34:34] deliverance, that they might obtain a
[34:37] better resurrection. And others had
[34:41] trial of cruel mockings and scourgings,
[34:44] yay, moreover, of bondences and
[34:46] imprisonments. They were stoned. They
[34:49] were swn aunder, were tempted, were
[34:52] slain with the sword. They wandered
[34:54] about in sheep skins and goat skins,
[34:57] being destitute, afflicted, and
[34:59] tormented. of whom the world was not
[35:02] worthy. They wandered in deserts and in
[35:06] mountains and in dens and in caves of
[35:08] the earth. And these all having obtained
[35:11] a good report
[35:14] through faith receive not the promise.
[35:16] God having provided some better thing
[35:20] for us that they without us should not
[35:24] be made perfect.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Two more verses. And wherefore seeing we
[35:29] are comp also compassed about with so
[35:32] great a cloud of witnesses. Let us lay
[35:35] aside every weight and the sin which
[35:38] does so easily beset us. And let us run
[35:42] with patience the race that is set
[35:44] before us. looking unto Jesus, the
[35:47] author and the finisher of our faith,
[35:49] who for the joy was set before him,
[35:52] endured the cross, despising the same,
[35:55] and is sat down at the right hand of the
[35:57] throne of God.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; You may be seated this evening.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord? Amen.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this and what
[36:13] thank you of Christ. He is preaching in
[36:16] Chicago and he says HE SAYS CHICAGO I
[36:20] ASK you this afternoon.
[36:23] What thank ye of Christ?
[36:26] Whose son is he? In his resurrection
[36:30] power when he walked here on the earth
[36:33] he saw visions. HE'S DONE MIRACLES,
[36:36] performed things, and he said, "These
[36:39] things that I do, shall you do also
[36:43] nightly." You see those things performed
[36:45] right here in this church. What's your
[36:48] opinion OF JESUS CHRIST?
[36:50] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD, ISN'T
[36:53] HE?
[36:55] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, I COULD ASK TODAY, DWIGHT
[36:57] MOODY, what do you think of Jesus
[37:00] Christ? HE SAYS WHEN HE WAS DYING THERE
[37:03] HE ASKED THAT QUESTION. I believe when
[37:05] he was dying AND HE SAID IS THIS DEATH
[37:09] HE SAID THIS IS MY CORONATION DAY.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; HE SAID I TELL YOU LIVES OF GREAT men
[37:17] all remind us we can make our life
[37:21] sublime with partings leave behind us
[37:24] footprints on the sands of time.
[37:28] footprints that perhaps another he says
[37:31] SAIL IN AFTERLIFE SOLEMN MAN for for
[37:34] long and shipwreck brother sin shall
[37:37] take heart again.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; I would like to look this evening
[37:45] at screams from the sands of time.
[37:49] Brother Brandham makes a couple of
[37:50] statements and I just want to take a
[37:52] couple of things from this and
[37:55] and and you'll catch it quickly where
[37:57] I'm headed.
[38:00] He in in taking sides with Jesus,
[38:03] he says, I want you, he says, I notice
[38:06] that how that the churches that
[38:09] evangelism scattering out everywhere. He
[38:12] says, then we'll take for instance Paul
[38:15] becoming a great missionary to find our
[38:17] people. We find out THAT HE WENT
[38:20] WHEREVER the Lord led him and he
[38:21] established his church and it has a new
[38:24] faith and the churches of all those days
[38:27] like it was in Asia Minor and throughout
[38:30] Europe they didn't believe the message
[38:32] and when he preached the message and
[38:34] many was converted to it then there was
[38:37] no one if they left the people in that
[38:39] condition they were under right back
[38:41] into their pagan gods into the countries
[38:44] HE SAID EACH ONE OF THESE CHURCHES HE
[38:46] LEFT SOMEONE WHO WAS in order, a man
[38:49] that was trustworthy, a man that was
[38:51] known as a pastor, a shepherd. He says,
[38:55] HE SAYS, "THEN AFTER THAT, THE CHURCH
[38:57] become little churches come after that.
[38:59] Young men, old men raised up and become
[39:02] churches after that." He said, "The man
[39:04] that was THAT WAS OVER THE first church
[39:06] was called the bishop, THEN WENT OUT
[39:08] AFTER THIS, AND HIS CHILDREN CALLED
[39:10] SHEPHERDS and pastors, and then a group
[39:12] of little churches WOULD COME BACK." HE
[39:15] SAYS LIKE BACK IN THE TIME OF IREANIUS,
[39:18] HE CARRIED on the same thing. Martin
[39:21] carried on the same thing. Polycarp
[39:24] carried on the same thing right DOWN
[39:26] THROUGH THE AGES LIKE THAT. HE SAYS WHEN
[39:29] THE HE SAYS THE APOSTLE of the church,
[39:31] he said that was Paul. AND WHEN PAUL
[39:34] LEFT, JOHN TOOK OVER THE CHURCH. AND
[39:37] WHEN JOHN LEFT, POLYCARP TOOK OVER. HE
[39:40] SAYS WHEN POLYCARP LEFT, IREANIUS took
[39:43] over. He says, "MARTIN AND SO FORTH." IT
[39:46] JUST KEPT GOING ON AND ON UNTIL THE
[39:49] ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH BROKE THE WHOLE
[39:51] THING to pieces and BURNED THEM AND
[39:53] SCATTERED THEM AND THE PLUMBER worm eat
[39:55] this and and the cankerworm eat that and
[39:57] so forth and eat that. AND HE SAYS IT
[39:59] PLUM ON DOWN TO THE STALK. HE SAID, "BUT
[40:02] GOD HAS PROMISED
[40:05] &gt;&gt; TO RESTORE that same thing."
[40:08] And I do BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT
[40:12] WE'RE LIVING IN THE LAST DAYS. I believe
[40:15] there's NOT TOO MUCH THAT WOULD BREAK
[40:17] THIS ANYTHING. AND MY INTERPRETATION may
[40:20] be wrong of the scriptures that Jesus HE
[40:23] SAYS COULD NOT COME TONIGHT. BUT I
[40:26] BELIEVE THAT WHAT'S LE LITTLE that's
[40:28] left to be fulfilled could BE FULFILLED
[40:31] BEFORE THE DAYLIGHT OF THE MORNING.
[40:35] HE SAYS, "I may be wrong on the TIME OF
[40:37] THAT FULFILLING." HE SAYS, "BUT IT'S AT
[40:40] HAND.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; I believe." AND HE SAYS, "REMEMBER,
[40:44] NOTICE THIS. AND REMEMBER, PAUL BELIEVED
[40:47] THAT,
[40:49] &gt;&gt; JOHN BELIEVED THAT,
[40:51] &gt;&gt; POLYCART BELIEVED THAT, IREANIUS
[40:54] BELIEVED THAT, MARTIN BELIEVED THAT, AND
[40:57] ALL OF THE REST OF THEM BELIEVED THAT."
[41:00] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "WHAT IF GOD WOULD HAVE TOLD
[41:02] JOHN THE REVELATOR?" NOW, IT'S GOING TO
[41:05] BE 2,000 YEARS BEFORE MY COMING. JOHN
[41:08] WOULD HAVE COME BACK AND TOLD THE
[41:10] CHURCH, "WELL, I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL
[41:12] GO OUT AND EAT, DRINK, and be merry." HE
[41:16] SAYS, "CONS THERE'S GOING TO BE
[41:17] GENERATIONS, many generations." JESUS
[41:21] ISN'T GOING TO COME FOR 2,000 YEARS. HE
[41:24] SAID, "THE CHURCH WOULD have been loose.
[41:26] THERE'D HAVE BEEN NO ON THE MARK. THERE
[41:29] WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WAITING. AFTER ALL,
[41:32] IT'S YOUR ANTICIPATION.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "CUZ IT AIN'T GOING TO HINDER
[41:39] ONE THING. YOU'RE GOING TO BE RIGHT ON
[41:42] TIME ANYHOW." SEE WHAT I MEAN? HE SAYS,
[41:45] "NOW, WHEN ST. MARTIN AWAKES IN THE
[41:49] RESURRECTION, ST. PAUL AND ALL OF THE
[41:52] REST OF THEM. IT'LL BE JUST AS FRESH,
[41:59] &gt;&gt; JUST AS IF THEY HAD BEEN RIGHT IN THE
[42:02] BATTLE, BATTLING RIGHT AWAY. HE SAYS,
[42:06] "CUZ THEY WENT RIGHT DOWN UNDER THE SAME
[42:09] ANTICIPATIONS
[42:12] LOOKING FOR HIS COMING AND THERE'LL BE A
[42:15] SCREAM COME UP AND WILL COME TO THE
[42:19] WHOLE CHURCH. YOU SEE WHAT IT TO BE. SO
[42:22] IT DOESN'T MATTER. SO WE'VE GOT TO BE
[42:25] LOOKING FOR HIM RIGHT NOW.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS EVEN IF WE DON'T KNOW IT COULD
[42:32] POSSIBLY BE. IT COULD BE A HUNDRED YEARS
[42:34] FROM NOW. IT COULD BE 500 YEARS FROM
[42:37] NOW, A THOUSAND YEARS FROM NOW. I DON'T
[42:39] KNOW. NOBODY KNOWS. HE SAYS FOR INSTANCE
[42:42] IF THAT IF WE LIVE EACH DAY THAT WE THAT
[42:45] HE WAS COMING THAT DAY IF WE LIVE LIKE
[42:48] THAT HE'S COMING THIS DAY WHEN WE AWAKE
[42:51] HE SAYS AND WE AWAKEN THE RESURRECTION
[42:54] IT'LL BE JUST AS FRESH AS IF WE HAD
[42:57] FALLEN ASLEEP AND JUST WOKE UP THAT
[43:00] TRUMPET WILL SOUND AND THE DEAD IN
[43:02] CHRIST SHALL RISE FIRST AND THEN WE
[43:04] WHICH ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN SHALL BE
[43:06] CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH THEM TO MEET THE
[43:08] LORD IN THE AIR.
[43:14] NOW, you know, there's some things that
[43:15] we see and some we don't see.
[43:19] Brother Brandham says this, and I'm just
[43:21] going to drop this here, and it may seem
[43:22] odd that I would drop it in this spot,
[43:25] but brother Brandham said that when Amra
[43:27] and Jose
[43:29] was was getting ready to put the baby
[43:32] Moses into the bull rush,
[43:37] HE SAID, GOD CALLED FOR GABRIEL
[43:41] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, GABRIEL, I WANT YOU TO COME
[43:45] &gt;&gt; AND SIT ON THE TOP OF THIS LITTLE
[43:48] BASKET.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; I AM SURE THAT AMRA DID NOT SEE IT. I AM
[43:55] SURE THAT HIS MOTHER DID NOT SEE IT. BUT
[43:58] I AM ABSOLUTELY PROOF POSITIVE THAT
[44:01] EVERY DEMON IN HELL.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; EVERY DEMON IN HELL SAW GABRIEL TAKE HIS
[44:10] POSITION.
[44:12] AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "NOW YOU LINE
[44:14] UP THOUSANDS
[44:16] THOUSANDS OF ANGELS ALL UP AND DOWN THIS
[44:19] CROCODILE INFESTED WATERS."
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; AND YOU MAKE SURE THAT IF A CROCODILE
[44:28] COMES AND PUTS A NOSE AGAINST THAT
[44:30] BASKET, AGAINST THAT ASPHALT, YOU MAKE
[44:33] SURE THAT HE DOESN'T GET IT. THAT'S
[44:36] RIGHT.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; SAID THEN WHEN HE GOES DOWN THAT RIVER
[44:38] AND HE GETS INTO THE WHIRLPOOLS OF LIFE,
[44:41] WHICH HE WILL.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, YOU SEE TO IT THAT HE WILL GET
[44:46] OUT OF IT.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; SAYING ALL OF THAT TO SAY THIS, WE ARE
[44:51] NOT ALONE UNDER THIS TENT TONIGHT.
[44:56] GATHERING IN ANOTHER DIMENSION. THERE
[44:59] ARE A GROUP OF PEOPLE,
[45:02] &gt;&gt; A CLOUD OF WITNESSES THAT ARE UNDER THE
[45:05] SAME ANTICIPATION.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; NOW, remember this, brother Brandham
[45:13] talks about in Revelations chapter 1, he
[45:16] begins to talk ABOUT SEVEN STARS. CHRIST
[45:19] STANDING THERE WITH THOSE seven stars in
[45:21] his hands and those seven lampstands and
[45:24] th that seven THAT SEVEN LAMPSTICKS AS
[45:27] THEY'RE standing there. Being message
[45:29] believers, WE UNDERSTAND. I'VE asked
[45:31] theologians just for just for seeing HOW
[45:34] THEY FEEL. I'VE ASKED THEM WHAT THOSE
[45:36] SCRIPTURES MEANT. And of course, they
[45:39] would stand there and give me a lot of
[45:40] their their UH SYNOPSISES THAT YOU MIGHT
[45:44] SAY and stagger AROUND IN DARKNESS. AND
[45:47] THEY JUST HAD DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THE PROPHET OF GOD STOOD THERE
[45:53] &gt;&gt; AND TIED THE LOOSE ENDS FOR THE BRIDE OF
[45:56] JESUS CHRIST,
[45:58] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE THAT IT WAS CHRIST COMING
[46:01] ALL THE WAY DOWN THROUGH THOSE
[46:04] DISPENSATIONS THROUGH EVERY CHURCH AGE.
[46:08] WHEN THE APOSTLE PAUL WAS STANDING THERE
[46:10] AND HE SAID, "I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE
[46:14] GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST WRITING 14 BOOKS
[46:19] OF THE BIBLE." HE SAID, "I COME NOT WITH
[46:21] POWER." HE SAYS, "I COME TO YOU NOT WITH
[46:23] YOU TO YOU WITH ENTICING WORDS OF MAN'S
[46:27] WISDOM, BUT I COME TO YOU IN POWER AND
[46:30] DEMONSTRATION OF THE HOLY GHOST
[46:33] &gt;&gt; SPAWNED FROM UNDER HIS MINISTRY WHERE
[46:36] MEN,
[46:37] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[46:38] THAT WAS UNDER THE SAME WICK, UNDER THE
[46:41] SAME ANOINTING. ARE YOU WITH ME?
[46:44] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ALL OF THEIR WICKS WERE DIPPED
[46:47] IN THE SAME OIL.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, HE SAYS, AND
[46:50] I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THE TIME TO READ
[46:52] IT. HE SAYS, "BUT EVERY ONE OF THOSE
[46:54] LAND, EVERY ONE OF THOSE CANDLESTICKS
[46:58] WERE LIT BY THE SAME FIRE." HE SAID, "IT
[47:01] WAS CHRIST COMING DOWN THROUGH THE
[47:03] CHURCH AGES."
[47:06] NOW, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THESE ARE
[47:08] SOME OF THE GREATEST MEN AND THE
[47:10] GREATEST WOMEN THAT EVER LIVED.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; These are not 10-centent people.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; We would say to by today's standards
[47:26] that they're astronauts of their ages.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Random simply puts it like this
[47:31] and he said, "Here's the plan of it. The
[47:34] first thing that happens, an
[47:36] announcement in heaven's first,
[47:39] &gt;&gt; a seal opens.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; He said a mystery is unfolded. And when
[47:45] THAT MYSTERY IS UNFOLDED, THEN A TRUMPET
[47:47] sounds and it declares a war
[47:52] &gt;&gt; or a plague falls AND THE CHURCH AGES
[47:56] OPEN. HE SAYS, "WHAT IS THE WAR PART?"
[47:58] THE ANGEL OF THE CHURCH CATCHES THE
[48:01] MYSTERY OF GOD, NOT FULLY YET REVEALED.
[48:05] BUT WHEN HE DOES, HE CATCHES THE MYSTERY
[48:07] OF GOD. AND HE GOES FORTH TO THE PEOPLE.
[48:10] AND AFTER THE MYSTERY HAS BEEN GIVEN TO
[48:12] HIM, HE GOES FORTH TO THE PEOPLE. WHAT
[48:15] DOES HE DO OUT THERE? HE BEGINS TO
[48:17] PROCLAIM THE MESSAGE. AND WHAT DOES IT
[48:20] START? A WAR.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; A SPIRITUAL WAR.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH THIS. HE SAYS THIS IN THE
[48:28] PATMAS VISION. HE SAID, "NOW THE LAMP
[48:31] STEMS ALL FIT INTO ONE GREAT BIG BOWL,
[48:35] ONE GREAT BIG HOLDER." HE SAYS, "SEVEN
[48:38] DIFFERENT LAMP HOLDERS COME OUT OF IT."
[48:40] HE SAYS, "AND WHEN THEY DID THAT, EACH
[48:42] ONE OF THOSE LIGHTS WAS DRAWING FROM THE
[48:45] MAIN RESOURCE OF ITS LIGHT." AND HE
[48:49] SAID, "IT'S THE LIGHT BECAUSE IT HAD THE
[48:52] CANDLE DIPPED INTO THE HE SAYS INTO THE
[48:55] MAIN BARREL." HE SAID, "WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
[48:57] PICTURE OF ONE OF THOSE SEVEN STARS THAT
[49:01] REPRESENTED THERE WITH THIS LIFE OF THE
[49:04] FIRE WITH THE HOLY GHOST." HERE, HE
[49:07] SAYS, "BY FAITH, IT'S BURNING WITH THE
[49:09] HOLY GHOST," HE SAYS THAT CANDLE, HE
[49:12] SAYS. HE SAID, "BUT THE WICK THAT'S
[49:15] DRIPPING BY THE HOLY GHOST," HE SAID,
[49:17] "THE HOLY SPIRIT THROUGH THAT WICK, HE'S
[49:20] DRAWING THE LIFE OF GOD OUT TO GIVE IT
[49:23] LIGHT TO HIS CHURCH." WHAT A PICTURE OF
[49:27] THE TRUE BELIEVER.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHAT A WHAT KIND OF A LIGHT HE
[49:32] GIVEN." HE SAID, "THE SAME KIND OF LIGHT
[49:35] THAT HE WAS IN THE FIRST CANDLE THAT WAS
[49:38] LIT."
[49:39] &gt;&gt; He says, HE SAYS, "WATCH THIS." AND I
[49:41] WANT TO JUST DROP BACK AND GIVE YOU ONE
[49:42] MORE. SORRY TO lay a foundation here
[49:44] just FOR A FEW MOMENTS. HE SAYS, "BUT HE
[49:46] SAYS, NOW LET'S JUST STOP HERE JUST FOR
[49:48] A MOMENT CUZ WE'LL LEAVE THE PICTURE."
[49:50] HE SAID, "LOOK AT THESE candlesticks
[49:52] standing there." NOW HE SAYS WE FIND
[49:54] THEM SEVEN CHURCH AGES. EPHESUS,
[49:57] PERGAMUS, PHILADELPHIAIAN, LEODYSIAN,
[49:59] CHILDREN, SEVEN CHURCH AGES. HE SAID AND
[50:01] EACH ONE OF THESE CANDLESTICKS HAD A
[50:03] LITTLE CRUISE of oil setting there. And
[50:05] this all burned ON THIS CANDLE. AND ONE
[50:08] CANDLE WAS LIT BY THE FIRE OF GOD. THEY
[50:11] TAKEN THAT CANDLE, LIT THE OTHER ONE,
[50:13] THEN SET IT DOWN AND LIT THE OTHER ONE,
[50:15] THEN LIT THE OTHER ONE, AND THEN LIT THE
[50:18] OTHER ONE. ONE OFF OF ANOTHER TILL THAT
[50:20] LAST CANDLE AMEN.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; THAT LAST CANDLE IS LIT BY THE SAME OIL.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Now the trouble of IT
[50:33] IS WE BAPTISTS, WE METHODISTS," HE SAID,
[50:35] "WE'RE WAY BACK UP HERE TRYING TO TAKE
[50:37] SOME HISTORICAL THING AND HERE GOES THE
[50:40] CHURCH DOWN THROUGH HERE." HE SAYS,
[50:42] "WE'RE LEFT BEHIND." EVERY CHURCH WHEN
[50:45] IT STARTED, HE SAYS, "THEY'RE LEFT
[50:46] BEHIND." HE SAID, "LOOK AT LUTHER IN HIS
[50:49] FIRST REFORMATION. WHAT A REVIVAL." HE
[50:52] SAID, "I'VE GOT HIS TEXTBOOK AT HOME.
[50:54] HOW THAT MAN HEALING, ACCEPTING IT
[50:56] HIMSELF, BELIEVED THE POWER OF GOD EVEN
[50:59] IN SO MUCH THAT HE SPOKE IN TONGUES."
[51:01] MARTIN LUTHER, he said, Martin Luther
[51:04] spoke in tongues. He said, "THEN THE
[51:07] NEXT STAGE COME OUT." JOHN WESLEY, JOHN
[51:10] WESLEY DONE THE SAME THING. AND WHEN HE
[51:13] WAS PREACHING, HE SAID, "WHAT ARE THESE
[51:14] WORDS THAT I MOTHER UNKNOWN TO MYSELF?"
[51:16] HE SAID, "SPEAKING IN TONGUES, BELIEVED
[51:18] IN DIVINE HEALING." AND HE COME TO
[51:20] AMERICA AND THE CHURCHES TREATED HIM
[51:22] LIKE HE WAS A HOLY ROLLER AND THEY PUT
[51:24] HIM OUT OF THE CHURCH AND THEY PREACHED
[51:26] THE GOSPEL OUT THERE AND FELL UNDER THE
[51:29] POWER OF GOD UNTIL THEY LAID IN THE
[51:31] FLOOR ALL NIGHT AT THAT TIME HE SAID IN
[51:34] JOHN WESLEY'S OLD TEXTBOOK WHEN I GOT IT
[51:37] AT HOME NOW WHERE HE WAS RIDING A HORSE
[51:40] ONE DAY AND PRAYED FOR A WOMAN THAT WAS
[51:42] SICK AND THE HORSE FELL AND BROKE ITS
[51:45] LEG AND GOT OFF OF THE HORSE AND TOOK A
[51:47] CRUISE OF ALL AND ANOINTED IN THAT HORSE
[51:50] WITH ALL GOT RIGHT BACK ON IT AND RODE
[51:52] RIGHT BACK AWAY.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Now I I want to I WANT TO JUST KIND OF
[52:03] TOUCH A COUPLE OF THINGS RIGHT HERE.
[52:06] NOW UNDERSTAND THESE MEN SPIT THESE MEN
[52:08] AND WOMEN SPENT EVERY BIT of energy that
[52:12] they could possibly spend
[52:16] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S AN ANTICIPATION FROM WITHIN
[52:19] THEM
[52:20] &gt;&gt; FOR THE COMING OF THE Lord
[52:22] &gt;&gt; and IF GIVEN A CHOICE THEY WOULD HAVE
[52:25] PICKED OUR DAY
[52:31] &gt;&gt; HAD THEY BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY
[52:35] &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD PITCH YOUR PEW TO SET IN HERE
[52:37] TONIGHT.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; IF BEEN GIVEN THE CHOICE BEFORE THE
[52:42] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, WHAT AGE WOULD
[52:44] YOU LIKE TO HAVE LIVED IN?
[52:50] &gt;&gt; WHAT AGE WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIVE IN,
[52:52] PETER?
[52:54] &gt;&gt; NOW, I AM SURE IF PETER COULD STAND HERE
[52:56] TONIGHT AND GIVE US A TESTIMONY SERVICE.
[52:58] I'm just going to relax tonight because
[53:00] I was just started getting nervous a
[53:01] little while ago. I'm just going to
[53:03] shake that thing.
[53:08] NOW, PETER, IF HE COULD STAND HERE
[53:10] TONIGHT AND HE COULD SPEAK TO THIS
[53:13] CONGREGATION, I'M SURE THAT HE COULD
[53:16] BEGIN TO TELL US SOME WORDS. AND, YOU
[53:18] KNOW, WE NEED TO ONCE IN A WHILE BUILD A
[53:20] MEMORIAL.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; We need to ONCE IN A WHILE REVISIT A
[53:24] COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE VERY COMMON TO
[53:26] US. AND IF PETER COULD COME AND STAND IN
[53:29] MY PLACE TONIGHT AND HE COULD STAND, HE
[53:31] SAID, "I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO KNOW I
[53:33] WAS WITH HIM.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; I WAS WITH HIM AND I SAW ALL THE
[53:37] MIRACLES AND THE SIGNS AND THE WONDERS.
[53:40] I SAW LAZARUS COME FORTH OUT OF THE
[53:42] GRAVE.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; I WAS THERE WITH THE FOUR AND 5,000 THAT
[53:46] GOT FED. I WAS THERE THAT HELPED TAKE UP
[53:49] THE LOGS AND TAKE UP THE FISH. I WAS
[53:52] THERE WHEN I SAW THE MIRACLES TAKE
[53:55] PLACE. I WAS THERE WHEN HE WEPT AT THE
[53:57] TOMB. I WAS THERE AND WATCHED HIM TALK
[54:00] TO MARY AND TALK TO MARTHA AND SAY, "I
[54:04] AM GLAD FOR YOUR SAKES."
[54:07] &gt;&gt; THAT I WAS NOT HERE.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; I WAS THERE WHEN I HEARD HIM LIFT HIS
[54:14] VOICE
[54:16] AND I BELIEVE IT WAS THE VOICE OF THE
[54:19] RESURRECTION.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; AND HE SCREAMED, "LAZARUS, COME FORTH.
[54:26] AND A MAN WHO WAS SICK, A MAN THAT WAS
[54:29] ALREADY ROTTING IN THE GRAVE, STEPPED
[54:31] FORTH FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION AND STEPPED
[54:34] OUT.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; I was there when he gave me the keys to
[54:41] the kingdom.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; I WAS THERE WHEN ALL THE REST OF THEM
[54:46] COULDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION, WHO IS THE
[54:49] CHRIST?
[54:51] &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I, THE SON OF MAN,
[54:53] AM?
[54:55] AND OTHERS SAID, "THOU ART JEREMIAH
[54:58] OR EZEKIEL OR ONE OF THE PROPHETS." BUT
[55:01] SOMETHING MOVED WITHIN ME.
[55:05] A DEEP MOVED INSIDE OF ME. I DIDN'T EVEN
[55:08] HARDLY KNOW WHAT I WAS SAYING, BUT I
[55:10] SAID, "THOU ART THE CHRIST, THE SON OF
[55:13] THE LIVING GOD." AND JESUS TURNED TO ME
[55:16] AND SAID, "FLESH AND BLOOD HAS NOT
[55:18] REVEALED THIS UNTO THEE, BUT MY FATHER
[55:20] WHICH IS IN HEAVEN."
[55:23] AND THERE HE CHANGED MY NAME FROM SIMON
[55:27] UNTO PETER.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, that's familiar. Well,
[55:32] we're coming.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; IT WAS ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS I WAS
[55:37] STANDING THERE WITH HIM AND HE TOLD ME
[55:39] LIP TO EAR. AND HE SAID, "SIMON," HE
[55:42] SAID, "SIMON, SIMON, SATAN DESIRES TO
[55:46] SIFT YOU LIKE WEIGHT."
[55:48] &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I HAD THE MESSAGE. I THOUGHT I
[55:51] KNEW WHO HE WAS.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I KNEW ALL ABOUT THE WORD. BUT
[55:57] HE TOLD ME IN JUST A MATTER OF A COUPLE
[56:00] OF SENTENCES THAT I NEEDED MORE.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; I had BEEN RAISED IN A GOOD HOME. I'D
[56:08] BEEN RAISED ANTICIPATING THE COMING OF
[56:11] THE MESSIAH.
[56:17] AND AS I GREW UP, I WAS ANTICIPATING
[56:20] SEEING HIM.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; AND I HAD ENJOYED, LISTEN, I'D LAID JUST
[56:24] JUST A FEW FEET AWAY FROM HIM NIGHT
[56:26] AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. I'D
[56:29] WATCHED HIM HOLD HIS HEAD WITH A
[56:30] HEADACHE. I'D WATCHED HIM GET TIRED FROM
[56:33] PREACHING. I'D WATCHED HIM LAY IN THE
[56:35] BOAT. OH YEAH.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SPOKE TO ME
[56:41] AND HE TOLD ME, "GET BEHIND ME."
[56:48] &gt;&gt; HE EVEN CALLED ME A DEVIL.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I WAS IN AN UNCONVERTED STATE.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; I NEEDED TO DO MORE THAN JUST BELIEVE ON
[56:59] JESUS.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; I needed TO DO MORE THAN JUST HAVE MY
[57:04] FAVORITE QUOTE BOOK.
[57:06] I NEED IT TO BE MORE THAN JUST SEE A
[57:08] MIRACLE.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; I NEED IT FOR THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST
[57:14] TO LIVE INSIDE OF ME.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Skipping a forward.
[57:24] He said he told us to carry
[57:27] in the upper room.
[57:29] We did not know what we were waiting
[57:31] for. Amen.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; We were waiting there
[57:35] and WE'D WAITED DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY.
[57:39] BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE BRIDE
[57:41] OF THAT DAY. THEY WERE COMING IN ONE
[57:43] ACCORD.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; 380 PEOPLE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO DO.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS 120 OF US THAT COULDN'T LIVE
[57:54] WITHOUT MORE OF HIM.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
[57:59] THAT'S GOT OTHER THINGS TO DO. BUT I
[58:02] WANT YOU TO KNOW THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[58:03] DETERMINATION IN YOUR HEART.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE 380 PEOPLE SEEING THE
[58:09] ASCENSION OF CHRIST AND HIM TELLING THEM
[58:12] GO TO THE UPPER ROOM AND THEY STILL MISS
[58:14] IT?
[58:15] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL SEE THE MESSAGE
[58:17] SAID IN OUR CHURCHES AND STILL MISS IT?
[58:20] COME RIGHT UP TO THE RAPTURE AND STILL
[58:23] MISS IT. GOD HELP US.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; GOD HELP US.
[58:33] It was a special day.
[58:36] Is this okay?
[58:39] &gt;&gt; It was a special day.
[58:43] We were in such a presence.
[58:46] We were waiting.
[58:49] We were waiting for something.
[58:51] He told us, "I'LL NOT LEAVE YOU
[58:54] COMFORTLESS,
[58:55] &gt;&gt; BUT I WILL COME
[58:58] &gt;&gt; AND DWELL INSIDE OF YOU."
[59:00] &gt;&gt; HE HAD TOLD US THAT THE KINGDOM IS IN
[59:03] YOU.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; HE HAD TOLD US, "LET YOUR LIGHT SO SHINE
[59:08] BEFORE MEN."
[59:09] &gt;&gt; BUT WE WERE COWARDS. WE WERE FISHERMEN.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; I HAD RUN. I HAD DENIED THE LORD. AND I
[59:19] NEEDED SOMETHING MORE. MAYBE YOU'RE
[59:21] SITTING HERE TONIGHT AND YOU'VE SAT IN A
[59:23] PEW OVER AND OVER AND OVER FOR YEARS
[59:28] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN FOOL THE PREACHER.
[59:31] YOU CAN FOOL YOUR NEIGHBOR. YOU CAN FOOL
[59:33] EVERYBODY AROUND YOU. BUT YOU KNOW
[59:35] THERE'S SOMETHING LACKING INSIDE OF YOUR
[59:37] HEART. BROTHER BRENHAM SAID INSIDE OF
[59:40] THAT PILLAR OF FIRE IN THAT BURNING BUSH
[59:43] IT HAD WHAT MOSES WAS LACKING.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Come on church. YOU SAY, "WELL, BROTHER
[59:50] RON, THERE'S JUST CERTAIN THINGS THAT I
[59:51] CAN'T OVERCOME." I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I
[59:53] DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU'RE A PREACHER'S
[59:54] DAUGHTER OR A PREACHER'S SON OR A
[59:57] DEACON'S DAUGHTER OR A DEACON'S SON.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; You don't KNOW WHO I AM, BROTHER RON.
[1:00:07] I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. WITHOUT JESUS
[1:00:09] CHRIST AND WITHOUT THEIR REAL
[1:00:11] EXPERIENCE, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE TONIGHT
[1:00:13] BECAUSE WE'RE LIVING IN TROUBLESOME
[1:00:15] TIMES. WE'RE LIVING IN DIFFICULT HOURS.
[1:00:19] AND YOU NEED HIM MORE TODAY THAN YOU'VE
[1:00:21] EVER NEEDED HIM IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Something
[1:00:33] came.
[1:00:35] The season came.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. THERE'S JUST
[1:00:43] SOMETHING ABOUT THE HOLY GHOST YOU CAN'T
[1:00:45] EXPLAIN.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:47] BUT HE FILLED ALL THE HOUSE WHERE WE
[1:00:50] WERE SITTING.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; AND THAT PILLAR OF FIRE CAME AND DIVIDED
[1:00:57] 120 OF US ALL RECEIVED THE SAME BAPTISM
[1:01:01] OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU, I HAD WITNESSED ABOUT
[1:01:06] JESUS CHRIST, BUT I TELL YOU THAT DAY
[1:01:09] SOMETHING SPOKE WITHIN ME. WHEN THEY
[1:01:12] WANTED TO HEAR A SPEAKER, I'M NOT TOO
[1:01:15] MUCH OF A SPEAKER. HE SAID, "BUT WHEN I
[1:01:17] WANTED TO, IF THEY WANTED TO HEAR A
[1:01:18] SPEAKER, SOMETHING BELLOWED OUT OF ME
[1:01:21] AND SAID, "THIS IS THAT
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; I IDENTIFIED THE AGE THAT I WAS LIVING
[1:01:26] IN. THIS IS THAT
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; THAT THE PROPHET JOEL TALKS about
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; within our church.
[1:01:44] We were so moved by the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:49] Forgive me for just going this way for a
[1:01:51] little while,
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; but we were on our way to prayer.
[1:01:57] And there was a man that Jesus must have
[1:01:59] left.
[1:02:02] He was laying
[1:02:08] AND WE PASSED BY HIM AND HE ASKED US FOR
[1:02:10] ARMS.
[1:02:14] YOU KNOW, A FEW DAYS AGO, WE WERE
[1:02:15] POWERLESS.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETHING MOVED INSIDE OF US
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "SILVER AND GOLD HAVE I NONE,
[1:02:27] BUT SUCH AS I HAVE GIVE I THEE IN THE
[1:02:31] NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. RISE UP AND WALK."
[1:02:36] I TELL YOU THAT MAN LIMP AND AND
[1:02:40] STRENGTH CAME INTO HIS ANKLE BONES AND
[1:02:42] HE RAN INTO THE CITY
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; AND CAUSED A REVIVAL.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; NOW, BROTHER BRANDON SAID IN ACTS OF THE
[1:02:51] HOLY SPIRIT, HE SAID, HE SAID ON THE DAY
[1:02:54] OF PENTECOST, HE SAID SATAN JUST SAT
[1:02:58] BACK AND WAITED.
[1:03:02] HE SAID, "BUT WHEN PETER, JAMES, AND
[1:03:04] JOHN WENT UP TO THAT MAN THAT WAS AT THE
[1:03:07] GATE AND SAID, WHEN THEY PROVED THAT
[1:03:10] THEY HAD WHAT THEY SAID THEY HAD,
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; I want TO SAY THIS TO YOU. WHEN YOU
[1:03:16] PROVE THAT YOU HAVE WHAT YOU SAY THAT
[1:03:19] YOU HAVE, WHEN IT COMES OFF OF THIS
[1:03:22] PAPER AND IT BECOMES A LIVING REALITY
[1:03:25] INSIDE OF YOU, THE DEVIL IS NOT SCARED
[1:03:28] OF QUOTES. RIGHT.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; IMAGINE HE CARRIES ONE OF THESE BOOKS
[1:03:34] UNDER HIS ARMS REGULARLY.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THIS WORD AND YOU MAKE
[1:03:40] THIS WORD LIVE,
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "EVERY DEMON OUT
[1:03:45] OF HELL,
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; EVERY DEMON OUT OF HELL CAME AGAINST
[1:03:50] THEM."
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; WELL, you say, "Well, Brother Ron, it
[1:03:55] was probably just for a select group."
[1:03:58] Well, there was a young man, his name
[1:04:00] was Steven.
[1:04:02] Not going to spend a lot of time here.
[1:04:04] He says, "But dear, Steven. He was a
[1:04:06] young man that had the Holy Ghost."
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, but I'm a young
[1:04:11] man. I I'm not very old." I want you TO
[1:04:14] KNOW THIS AS WE SAID IT last night AND
[1:04:16] THE NIGHT BEFORE. WHAT GOD'S STRATEGY IS
[1:04:19] IS TO TAKE you and empty you out and
[1:04:22] fill you with THE HOLY GHOST AND THEN
[1:04:25] SHAKE THE WORLD WITH YOU.
[1:04:28] What world, BROTHER RON? YOUR WORLD.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. WHERE YOU GO TO SCHOOL,
[1:04:34] WHERE YOU WHERE YOU LIVE AT, IN YOUR
[1:04:37] HOME, THERE SHOULD BE AN ATMOSPHERE OF
[1:04:39] THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD.
[1:04:42] TELL THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.
[1:04:44] YOU'RE SALTY. AND SOMEBODY WHEN THEY
[1:04:46] WALK INTO YOUR PRESENCE, THEY WANT WHAT
[1:04:49] YOU'VE GOT.
[1:04:54] OH,
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; now in our church,
[1:05:04] I want to just kind of bring it up. In
[1:05:06] our church, there was a young lady that
[1:05:09] came to our church. She's actually my
[1:05:11] niece. She came and and she came to our
[1:05:15] vicinity and up up to to to
[1:05:19] she wasn't as close to the Lord as she
[1:05:21] needed to be.
[1:05:25] And so
[1:05:27] she came and she was dating a college
[1:05:29] boy in the town where I was living.
[1:05:33] And she was sitting across the table
[1:05:35] from me one day and and I spoke to her
[1:05:40] and I SAID, YOU KNOW, I SAID, YOU KNOW,
[1:05:43] THAT BOY COULD HAVE ANY GIRL,
[1:05:46] but I SAID, HE'S LOOKING FOR CHARACTER.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; And you don't HAVE TO LESSEN YOUR VALUES
[1:05:52] DOWN if he's looking for character.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; And if you get a REAL EXPERIENCE FOR
[1:05:58] YOURSELF, IF HE'S LOOKING FOR CHRIST, HE
[1:06:01] WILL COME TO THAT.
[1:06:06] COME ON. WE DON'T HAVE TO DIMINISH OUR
[1:06:08] VALUES.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE TO LOWER OUR STANDARDS. WE
[1:06:12] DON'T HAVE TO POLISH THIS THING UP FOR
[1:06:14] THE WORLD.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; IT'LL LIVE ON ITS OWN.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU THAT'S EXACTLY WE PRAYED
[1:06:21] WITH THAT YOUNG LADY AND THE LORD DEALT
[1:06:24] A REAL MOVE OF THE SUPERNATURAL IN her
[1:06:26] life.
[1:06:28] That young man came TO OUR HOUSE ONE
[1:06:30] NIGHT AND HE WAS TALKING TO ME TO ME ONE
[1:06:32] DAY AND HE SAYS, "WELL, YOU KNOW," HE
[1:06:34] SAID, "I WANT TO TRY TO HELP GET THIS
[1:06:37] young lady out of this cult." I said,
[1:06:40] "Good. I think that's good. You ought to
[1:06:42] do that.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; If you care for her at all, that's
[1:06:45] something you ought to do."
[1:06:47] And he was A BRETHREN BOY. HIS PARENTS
[1:06:50] WERE HAD BEEN BRETHREN. His grandparents
[1:06:52] had been brethren FOR 400 YEARS. THEY
[1:06:55] HAD BEEN BRETHREN.
[1:07:01] AND SO HE HE PICKED UP THAT WE HAD had
[1:07:05] preached serpency. That brother Brandham
[1:07:07] HAD PREACHED SERPENCY. OH, HOW HE SEEMED
[1:07:11] SO ARMED TO FIGHT IT.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; I thought it was a good thing. YES.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; AND SO WHEN I SAT HIM DOWN, I TOOK HIM
[1:07:20] RIGHT THROUGH THE SCRIPTURES AND I
[1:07:22] SHOWED THAT YOUNG MAN ABOUT WHERE IT
[1:07:25] STARTED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK HIM ALL
[1:07:27] THE WAY THROUGH THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS
[1:07:29] AND HE HAD CAME TO SEE HER. BUT BY 1:00
[1:07:33] IN THE MORNING, IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO
[1:07:34] GO HOME.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; HE CALLED ME THE NEXT MORNING. HE SAID,
[1:07:39] "I'LL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT
[1:07:41] LONG." HE SAID, "I WANT YOU TO KNOW I
[1:07:43] HAVE FOUGHT IT WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S
[1:07:45] WITHIN ME, BUT I SEE IT."
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, AND
[1:07:59] HERE'S A PICTURE I WANT TO TELL YOU. 400
[1:08:02] YEARS AGO, HE HAD A GREAT GREAT GREAT
[1:08:04] GRANDDADDY.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; HIS NAME WAS HANS LANDIS.
[1:08:09] AND HE WAS A PART OF A MOVEMENT
[1:08:12] THAT MOVED OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY
[1:08:15] GHOST AND THEY BELIEVED IN WATER BAPTISM
[1:08:18] IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; THEY BELIEVED IN ONE GOD. THEY BELIEVED
[1:08:24] SERPENT seat
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; over 400 years ago. AND HE AND HE WAS
[1:08:30] STANDING THERE AND YOU CAN GO BACK AND
[1:08:32] READ IT IN THE MARTYR'S MIRROR. AND HE'S
[1:08:34] STANDING THERE BEFORE HIS EXECUTIONER.
[1:08:37] AND HE WAS STANDING THERE AND HIS
[1:08:39] EXECUTIONER SAYS, "DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
[1:08:41] LEFT TO SAY?" HE SAID, "I PREACHED THIS
[1:08:44] WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S WITHIN ME. I'VE
[1:08:46] SPENT ALL OF MY ENERGY, MY WHOLE LIFE
[1:08:49] BELIEVING WHAT I BELIEVE. I AM PROUD TO
[1:08:52] DIE FOR THE CAUSE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Let me just SAY THIS TO YOU. GOD
[1:08:58] RECOGNIZED THAT LIFE, HE WOULDN'T LET IT
[1:09:01] DIE.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; The executioner
[1:09:09] WAS SO CONVICTED BY THE POWER OF GOD, he
[1:09:13] turned to HIM AND HE SAID, "I ASK YOU."
[1:09:16] HE SAYS, "I WANT YOU TO RUN. I'M GOING
[1:09:19] TO LAY MY AXE DOWN. I WANT YOU TO RUN
[1:09:24] AND I WILL NOT FOLLOW YOU. HE SAID
[1:09:27] ABSOLUTELY NOT. PETER DIED FOR THIS.
[1:09:31] PAUL DIED FOR THIS. IREANIUS DIED FOR
[1:09:35] THIS. POLYCARP DIED FOR THIS. AND I AM
[1:09:38] READY TO DIE FOR THIS.
[1:09:44] THAT EXECUTIONER DID HIS JOB. AND WHEN
[1:09:47] HE FINISHED, HE PICKED UP HIS BIBLE AND
[1:09:50] SAID, "SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO TAKE HIS
[1:09:52] PLACE. IT MAY AS WELL BE ME."
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; NOW,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; now his father came to OUR CHURCH AND HE
[1:10:14] WAS KIND OF CONCERNED about this
[1:10:15] message.
[1:10:18] AND SO HE GOT TO PRAYING ABOUT THE WORD
[1:10:21] AND YOU KNOW WAS THIS FOR HIM. SO HE GOT
[1:10:24] REAL DILIGENT BEFORE THE LORD. HE AND HE
[1:10:27] JUST PICKED A CERTAIN DAY. GOD, I WANT
[1:10:30] YOU TO SPEAK TO ME TODAY.
[1:10:33] I want to MEET A MAN THAT HAS MET
[1:10:35] WILLIAM BRHAM.
[1:10:38] Tall order.
[1:10:41] tall order
[1:10:44] runs a heating and air business. HE WAS
[1:10:47] SITTING IN HIS OFFICE JUST REALLY
[1:10:50] CONTEMPLATING THIS MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:10:53] AND AS HE WAS SITTING THERE, THERE WAS A
[1:10:55] preacher
[1:10:57] that was THAT HAD A A PROBLEM WITH HIS
[1:11:01] AIR CONDITION.
[1:11:03] SO HE STORMS IN HIS OFFICE AND HE SAYS,
[1:11:07] "I HAVE A PROBLEM." AND BOB SAYS, "SO DO
[1:11:10] I."
[1:11:16] HE SAID, "MY PROBLEM IS," HE SAYS, "WITH
[1:11:19] MY HEATING AND AIR." HE SAID, "IT'S NOT
[1:11:21] WORKING." HE SAYS, "I HAVE A PROBLEM
[1:11:23] WITH THIS MAN NAMED WILLIAM BROWN."
[1:11:28] EVER HEARD OF HIM? HE SAID, "SURE."
[1:11:31] I STOOD IN THE PRAYER LINE.
[1:11:43] HE SAID, "I STOOD THERE AND HE SAID,
[1:11:44] THERE'S A TAPE OF ME STANDING THERE IN
[1:11:46] DEEP CALLETH TO THE DEEP." HE SAID, "I'M
[1:11:49] THE LAST MAN IN THE PRAYER LINE." HE
[1:11:51] SAID, "BROTHER RAM TOLD ME, I'M NOT
[1:11:52] THERE FOR MYSELF. I'M THERE FOR REVIVAL
[1:11:55] IN MY CHURCH." OH YEAH.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT'S THE ONLY REVIVAL WE'VE EVER
[1:12:04] HAD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR CHURCH
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS SUPERNATURAL WAS THAT ONE
[1:12:10] REVIVAL.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; WELL, BOB SAYS, HE SAYS, I WANT TO ASK
[1:12:17] YOU SOMETHING. THEY SAY AN ANGEL WAS
[1:12:19] WITH HIM. HE SAID, ABSOLUTELY COMMON
[1:12:22] KNOWLEDGE. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAW THE
[1:12:24] ANGEL. HE SAID, "BUT THAT'S NOT FIXING
[1:12:26] MY HEAT AND AIR." HE SAID, "BUT YOU JUST
[1:12:28] FIXED MY PROBLEM.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; 400 YEARS GOD DID NOT FORGET."
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; 400 YEARS. GOD DID NOT FORGET.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM MENTIONS MEN LIKE PETER
[1:12:51] CARTWRIGHT. HE MENTIONS MEN LIKE
[1:12:53] JONATHAN GFORD.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; He mentions, YOU KNOW, IN OUR OUR LOCAL
[1:12:58] AREA, THERE WAS A MAN LIKE ROBERT
[1:13:00] SHEFFY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER
[1:13:01] HEARD OF HIM, BUT ROBERT SHEFFREY CAUGHT
[1:13:04] THE ANOINTING of John Wesley.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; You see, THAT WICK WAS CHRIST. RIGHT?
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE THESE MEN NEVER MET THE
[1:13:17] MESSENGER,
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WIT, THAT ANOINTING POURED DOWN
[1:13:21] INTO THEIR LIVES.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; AND THAT ANOINTING POURED OVER INTO
[1:13:26] THEIR LIVES AND THEY CAUGHT THE
[1:13:28] REVELATION OF THE HOUR. SIR,
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; I'M BUILDING. YES, SIR.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; I know you're going to enjoy this.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; HE MAY HAVE NEVER MET JOHN WESLEY. HE
[1:13:39] MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE WHEN THEY WHEN
[1:13:41] THEY ROCKED JOHN WESLEY AND HE SAID,
[1:13:43] "TODAY I WAS STONED AND LEFT FOR DEAD.
[1:13:47] TODAY I PREACHED TO 10,000 PEOPLE AND A
[1:13:50] HAIL STORM CAME, BUT THE HOLY GHOST WAS
[1:13:53] SO GREAT. THOUSANDS OF THEM FELL UNDER
[1:13:56] THE DYNAMICS OF THE HOLY GHOST. I TRIED
[1:13:58] TO GET THEM TO GO HOME, BUT THEY WERE SO
[1:14:01] INSPIRED BY THE WORD."
[1:14:04] HE MAY HAVE NEVER MET THAT MAN, BUT I'LL
[1:14:06] TELL YOU, THE HOLY GHOST WAS SO REAL IN
[1:14:09] HIS LIFE
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; TILL HE SHOOK THE AREA WHERE I LIVE AND
[1:14:15] THE SURROUNDING STATES WITH THE DYNAMICS
[1:14:18] OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:14:23] I WANT TO JUST TELL you
[1:14:26] it was during the days of prohibition
[1:14:29] and he asked God at many a steel
[1:14:35] THAT GOD WOULD SEND A MIGHTY oak tree
[1:14:40] OFF OF THE SIDES OF THOSE mountains
[1:14:43] and ROLL OFF OF THOSE MOUNTAINS AND
[1:14:46] CRUSH THAT STEEL IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:14:49] CHRIST. NOT ONE TIME, BUT A RECORDED 10
[1:14:53] TIMES THAT IT TOOK PLACE THAT GOD WOULD
[1:14:56] SEND A LIGHTNING BOLT IN THE MIDDLE OF
[1:14:59] THE NIGHT AND CRUSH THAT DEMONIC STEEL.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; AND MANY OF THOSE GUYS THAT WERE MAKING
[1:15:07] THAT LIQUOR BECAME PREACHERS WHEN THEY
[1:15:10] SAW THE ANOINTING OF GOD.
[1:15:15] HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:19] WELL, you say, "Well, brother, that was
[1:15:22] that was John Wesley's day.
[1:15:25] That was under that was under Luther's
[1:15:27] day. WHAT ARE YOU DOING UNDER THE
[1:15:31] MESSENGER OF YOUR DAY?
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach to you. Is this all
[1:15:41] right?
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; You've been a kind congregation to me.
[1:15:48] I'm sure I didn't ask brother Eddie
[1:15:51] before this service, but I'm just going
[1:15:53] to go this way and he can get mad at me
[1:15:54] and toss me out if he wants to.
[1:16:00] I'm sure there were a LOT OF PREACHERS
[1:16:03] SITTING ON THE PLATFORM
[1:16:05] THAT REALLY THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD THIS
[1:16:07] STUFF
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; THAT THOUGHT THEY WERE THE BEST THING
[1:16:16] THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE WORLD.
[1:16:20] AND HERE STANDS A LITTLE MAN BEHIND THE
[1:16:23] PULL PIT SIR.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; AND HE BEGINS TO EXPLAIN HOW THAT GOD
[1:16:31] CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; I'M SURE THEY WERE THINKING THERE JUST
[1:16:36] FOR A MOMENT. AND HE STEPS BACK AND HE
[1:16:38] SAYS, "I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW THAT GOD
[1:16:42] ROLLED THE SOLAR SYSTEM INTO EXISTENCE."
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; I'm sure they punched one another said,
[1:16:47] "This is going to be good.
[1:16:50] And he begins to go, a tiny little white
[1:16:53] light came, a halo of light. And he
[1:16:57] spoke from out of that halo of light.
[1:16:58] AND HE SAID, "LET there be a sun." AND
[1:17:01] HE SAID, "THAT SUN CAME INTO EXISTENCE."
[1:17:04] AND HE SAID, "THEN FROM THAT," HE SAID,
[1:17:06] "GOD ALLOWED A CLINKER TO FALL OFF OF
[1:17:08] THAT SUN."
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID IT ALLOWED IT TO FALL FROM
[1:17:12] MILLIONS OF YEARS.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; HE SAID GOD WAS WRITING HIS FIRST BIBLE.
[1:17:20] YOU KNOW, THEY WOULD HAVE PROBABLY LIKED
[1:17:21] TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GRAB THE HOLD OF
[1:17:22] THE, YOU KNOW, HIM AND SAY, YOU KNOW,
[1:17:24] WHY DON'T YOU TEACH US ALGEBRA AND HE'S
[1:17:27] TELLING THEM, YOU CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
[1:17:28] YOUR ABCS.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; HE'S THEY'RE WANTING TO KNOW THE DEEP
[1:17:32] MYSTERIES OF GOD. AND HERE HE'S STANDING
[1:17:36] THERE IN IN IN SERMONS AND WHO IS JESUS?
[1:17:39] AND HE BEGINS TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT A
[1:17:41] MAN NAMED ZAKIUS. UH-HUH.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; SOME OF THE GREATEST BUSINESSMEN AND
[1:17:47] PREACHERS ON THE SCENE. AND HE'S TALKING
[1:17:49] ABOUT A MAN NAMED ZAKIUS
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; WITH TRASH ALL OVER HIM.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; SITTING THERE totally embarrassed.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; AND THEY DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THAT JESUS WAS
[1:18:02] BEING MADE FLESH
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; AND UNVEILING HIMSELF STANDING BEFORE
[1:18:07] THEM. NOT IN THE MAN WAY OF BRUM, BUT IN
[1:18:10] THE WORD.
[1:18:13] ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS UNFOLDING HIMSELF TO THEM,
[1:18:17] BUT THEY DIDN'T CATCH IT.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; But God don't leave his earth without a
[1:18:23] witness.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; I went back and listened to it several
[1:18:32] places.
[1:18:34] Brother Brandham would say, "We have a
[1:18:37] young boy here, young man here that's a
[1:18:40] missionary to the Indians."
[1:18:43] Where you at, brother Eddie?
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to get points for brother
[1:18:50] Eddie.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; I'm getting here to get points with
[1:18:53] Jesus Christ.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And there all those preachers SITTING
[1:19:02] AROUND
[1:19:03] WHO IS THIS GUY?
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Who is this guy?
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Who is this boy?
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Who is this guy coming on the scene?
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; COME UP HERE AND SIT ON THE PLATFORM.
[1:19:20] YOU'RE BACK IN THE AMEN CORNER. COME UP
[1:19:22] HERE.
[1:19:26] AND I'M SURE PROBABLY AND I'M JUST GOING
[1:19:28] TO GO HERE. PROBABLY SOME OF THEM ARE
[1:19:30] THINKING, "WHY DIDN'T HE CALL MY NAME?
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; I'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN A LOT OF THINGS, BUT GOD KNEW
[1:19:43] WHAT HE WAS DOING.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH."
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; GOD KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD HAVE YOUNG MEN TO CATCH THIS
[1:19:53] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:19:58] LISTEN, WE DON'T NEED PERSONALITIES OF
[1:20:00] MEN. THEY WOULD PUT THIS WORD FIRST. THE
[1:20:04] REVEALING OF JESUS CHRIST FIRST. IT
[1:20:06] WOULD BE FIRST PLACE IN THEIR LIVES.
[1:20:10] THEY WOULD GIVE THEIR LIFE FOR THE CAUSE
[1:20:12] OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:20:15] LISTEN, IF WE COULD HEAR THEM SCREAMING
[1:20:17] FROM THE ANTICIPATION FROM ANOTHER REALM
[1:20:20] TONIGHT, THEY WENT TO THEIR GRAVES.
[1:20:23] THEY WENT TO THEIR GRAVE SCREAMING,
[1:20:26] LOOKING FOR THE COMING OF THE LORD. IF
[1:20:29] WE COULD HEAR THEM TONIGHT, THEY'RE
[1:20:31] SCREAMING TO US, "PRESS ON.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; We have a mandate from GOD AS MEN OF GOD
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; TO KEEP THIS message pure,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; TO KEEP THIS MESSAGE HOLY."
[1:20:52] BROTHER RON, YOU GUYS PREACH THE SAME
[1:20:54] THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER. YES,
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GUILTY. WE JUST COME FROM IT FROM
[1:21:02] DIFFERENT ANGLES. WE TURN THE DIAMOND
[1:21:04] AROUND AND TURN THE DIAMOND AROUND AND
[1:21:06] TURN THE DIAMOND AROUND. AND GOD SENDS
[1:21:08] THE DIFFERENT GIFTS AND THE FIVE-FOLD
[1:21:10] MINISTRY. AND HE HAS TEACHERS AND HE HAS
[1:21:13] EVANGELISTS. HE HAS PASTORS. EVERY ONE
[1:21:16] OF THEM WITH THE CAPACITY OF A GIFT
[1:21:18] INSIDE OF THEIR LIFE TO SAY IT MAYBE IN
[1:21:21] JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT WAY.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; MAYBE TO COOK YOUR PATO JUST A LITTLE
[1:21:28] BIT DIFFERENT OR TO COOK YOUR STEAK JUST
[1:21:30] A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. BUT SOMEWHERE
[1:21:32] GOD IS GOING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.
[1:21:43] And brother RANDOM SAID, HE SAID THAT
[1:21:45] MICHELANGELO,
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; HE SAID MICHELANGELO SPENT 44 YEARS,
[1:21:51] 44 YEARS WORKING ON THE SAME PIECE OF
[1:21:54] ROCK.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A VISION THAT WAS WITHIN HIS
[1:21:59] MIND.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; HE WAS BUILDING AND HE WAS WORKING.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THERE WERE NOT DAYS THAT HE
[1:22:05] FELT LIKE QUITTING?
[1:22:08] DO YOU THINK THERE WERE DAYS THAT HE
[1:22:09] LAID THAT HAMMER DOWN AND SAID, "I'LL
[1:22:11] NEVER PICK IT UP AGAIN.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; I'M SO TIRED. I'M SO WORE OUT. I'VE
[1:22:16] LOOKED AT THAT ROCK. I'VE LOOKED AT THAT
[1:22:18] EXCESS. I'VE LOOKED AT HIS BEARD. I'VE
[1:22:21] LOOKED IN HIS EYES."
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; You think HE DIDN'T GET TIRED? HE DIDN'T
[1:22:27] GET WORE OUT. OH, YES, HE DID.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; BUT ONE DAY HE WAS STANDING THERE.
[1:22:36] ONE DAY HE WAS STANDING THERE AND THE
[1:22:39] VISION BECAME A REALITY.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE HAD IN HIS MIND ALL OF THOSE
[1:22:47] YEARS. WHAT HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR ALL
[1:22:50] OF THOSE YEARS WAS SITTING BEFORE HIM.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT WAS
[1:22:56] DOWN INSIDE OF HIM. LISTEN, BROTHER
[1:22:58] BRANDHAM SAID THE STRIKE ON THE KNEE IS
[1:23:00] WHAT MADE IT A MASTERPIECE TO HIM
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS LOOKING AT IT FROM MORE
[1:23:06] THAN JUST AN artist point of view.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; God
[1:23:12] has been working on a masterpiece.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; WHAT PAUL LAID HIS HEAD DOWN ON A CHOP
[1:23:19] BLOCK FOR.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; WHAT PETER WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN ON A
[1:23:23] CROSS FOR.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; WHAT MEN DIED. WHAT WHAT WHAT PEOPLE
[1:23:28] WERE BURNT FOR, WHAT THEY WERE EAT BY
[1:23:30] LIONS FOR.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; They didn't do IT IN SOME
[1:23:38] CHICKEN-HEARTED WAY, BROTHER ERNIE.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; They did it with every bit of energy,
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; with every BIT OF DETERMINATION.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE WILLING.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; THEY WASN'T CONCERNED THAT SOMEBODY
[1:23:52] DIDN'T SHAKE THEIR HAND.
[1:23:55] THEY WASN'T CONCERNED IF THEY WASN'T THE
[1:23:57] FAVORITE PERSON IN THE WHOLE CHURCH.
[1:23:59] I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THERE WAS SOMETHING
[1:24:01] THAT WAS ANCHORED IN THEIR HEART. THEY
[1:24:03] WERE LOOKING FOR THE COMING OF THE LORD.
[1:24:06] THEY WERE AT WAR WITH THOSE HORSE
[1:24:08] RIDERS. THEY WAS AT WAR WITH THOSE DEMON
[1:24:11] SPIRITS. AND IT WAS SOMETHING INSIDE OF
[1:24:13] THEM THAT THEY WOULD OVERCOME.
[1:24:24] Brother Am says THIS, "A MOMENTARY
[1:24:25] CONSIDERATION OF CHURCH HISTORY WILL
[1:24:27] prove how accurate the thought is. In
[1:24:30] the dark ages, the word WAS ALMOST
[1:24:32] ENTIRELY LOST TO THE PEOPLE. BUT GOD
[1:24:35] SENT LUTHER WITH THE WORD AND THE
[1:24:38] LUTHERAN SPOKE FOR GOD AT THAT TIME. BUT
[1:24:41] THEY ORGANIZED AND AGAIN THE PURE WORD
[1:24:44] WAS LOST FOR ORGANIZATION AND IT TENDS
[1:24:47] TOWARDS DOGMAS AND CREEDS AND NOT A
[1:24:49] SIMPLE WORD AND THEY NO LONGER COULD NO
[1:24:51] LONGER SPEAK FOR GOD. THEN GOD SENT
[1:24:53] WESLEY AND HE WAS THE VOICE FOR THIS DAY
[1:24:56] OF THE WORD FOR HIS DAY. AND THE PEOPLE
[1:24:58] WHO TOOK HIS REVELATION FROM GOD BEGIN
[1:25:01] TO BEGIN TO BECAME LIVING EPISTLES READY
[1:25:04] AND KNOWN.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; LIVING EPISTLES READ AND KNOWN.
[1:25:10] Their name may NOT BE FOUND IN OUR BOOK,
[1:25:13] BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THEY'RE STANDING
[1:25:15] THERE.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "When the Methodist FAILED, GOD
[1:25:23] RAISED UP OTHERS ALSO. And so it has
[1:25:26] gone THROUGH THE YEARS UNTIL THIS LAST
[1:25:28] DAY. AND THERE IS AGAIN another people
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; in the land
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; who under their messengers
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; WILL BE
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; THE FINAL VOICE
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; TO THE FINAL EDGE.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, WHO DO YOU THINK THEY ARE?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[1:25:56] I'M SO GLAD THAT I CAN SAY I'M ONE OF
[1:26:00] THEM.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; There was a first CHIEF WAVE THAT CAME
[1:26:10] UP FROM ALL THE PROPHETS,
[1:26:12] which was the son of God, THE KING OF
[1:26:14] ALL THE PROPHETS. There has been
[1:26:17] churches, CHURCHES, AND BRIDES, BRIDES,
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; CHURCHES, BRIDES, BRIDES. BUT THERE HAS
[1:26:22] GOT TO COME ONE.
[1:26:25] YES, SIR.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WAITING ON
[1:26:28] YOU.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; OH, brother Ron, I can't HARDLY WAIT FOR
[1:26:34] THE COMING OF THE LORD. YOU THINK YOU
[1:26:35] CAN'T WAIT.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK YOU'RE EXCITED TONIGHT ABOUT
[1:26:40] THE COMING OF THE LORD.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT GOD HAS BEEN
[1:26:43] WAITING ON
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; THROUGHOUT THE ETERNITIES HE THOUGHT
[1:26:48] ABOUT YOU.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; 6,000 YEARS HE'S FOUGHT. HE HAS BEEN
[1:26:53] DETERMINED. HE HAS NOT QUIT.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; HE PRE-PLANNED YOU. HE LAID YOU OUT LIKE
[1:27:00] A WHAT A CONTRACTOR WOULD DO. HE KNEW
[1:27:03] WHAT AGE THAT YOU WOULD BE BORN HERE.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "OH, BROTHER, GOD DON'T CARE
[1:27:11] ABOUT ME." I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU
[1:27:12] TONIGHT. HE LOVED YOU. ROMANS 5 SAID HE
[1:27:15] LOVED YOU WHILE YOU WERE YET A SINNER.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; HE LOVED YOU WHEN YOU WAS UNLOVABLE. HE
[1:27:21] LOVED YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:27:22] WORLD.
[1:27:28] YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'M THIS AND I'M
[1:27:30] THAT." LISTEN, HE KNEW WHAT HAIR COLOR
[1:27:32] YOU WOULD HAVE. HE KNEW WHAT EYES THAT
[1:27:34] YOU WOULD HAVE. HE KNEW WHAT BILL THAT
[1:27:36] YOU WOULD HAVE. HE KNEW WHAT NATURE THAT
[1:27:38] YOU WOULD HAVE. HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT
[1:27:41] YOU.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW WHAT PROBLEMS THAT YOU WOULD
[1:27:45] HAVE. HE KNEW WHAT OBSTACLES YOU WOULD
[1:27:47] HAVE. AND IN SPITE OF ALL OF THAT, HE
[1:27:50] STILL CALLED YOU.
[1:28:03] BROTHER RON, I've never seen a miracle.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ron, I'm redheaded. Yep.
[1:28:16] I'M 5'5. YEP.
[1:28:19] I'M TOO SHORT. I LOOK AT THIS FELL
[1:28:22] STANDING UP OVER HERE WHEN HE RAISES HIS
[1:28:23] HANDS LIKE THAT AND I SAY, "LORD, DON'T
[1:28:25] MAKE HIM FIGHT ME."
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD KNEW HOW TALL I'D BE.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; BACK THROUGH THE GENERATIONS OF TIME, HE
[1:28:41] WATCHED OVER MY FOREFATHERS
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WERE CARRYING MY SEEDS.
[1:28:49] MAYBE THEY WERE FIGHTING IN WARS.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I just want to preach.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; MAYBE THEY WERE STANDING IN A WAR AND A
[1:29:06] SWORD GOES RIGHT BY THEIR SIDE AND GOD
[1:29:09] STOPPED THAT SWORD.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; MAYBE THERE WAS A BULLET WHO WENT OVER
[1:29:12] THEIR HEAD AND GOD TOOK THAT BULLET,
[1:29:14] MADE IT THIS GO LIKE THAT.
[1:29:18] CUZ THEY WERE CARRYING MY NATURAL
[1:29:20] STRENGTH.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; GOD HAD THIS ONE TO MARRY THAT ONE AND
[1:29:28] THIS ONE TO MARRY THIS ONE AND THIS ONE
[1:29:30] TO MARRY THIS ONE. YOU SAY, "BROTHER
[1:29:31] RON, I'M THE ONLY ONE IN MY FAMILY."
[1:29:33] ABSOLUTELY. YOU'RE ONE IN A MILLION.
[1:29:46] GOD DON'T NEED 10,000 TO IDENTIFY THAT
[1:29:48] YOU'RE THE ONE.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; ONE WOMAN NAMED MARY
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; WAS STANDING THERE AND THE ANGEL SAID,
[1:29:55] "THOU ART BLESSED."
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS WAITING ON HER WOMB TO ARRIVE ON
[1:30:01] THE EARTH.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram, sit out there in that dark
[1:30:08] chaos of night.
[1:30:11] He said, "I see little lights."
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; God knew you were coming.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Some of you were drug addicts.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Some of you were laying in beds of
[1:30:28] prostitution.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU WERE DEEP ENTRENCHED IN
[1:30:32] DENOMINATIONALISM.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Some of YOU WERE FETTERED IN DARKNESS OF
[1:30:36] SIN. BUT GOD WHO IS RICH IN MERCY,
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; GOD BE TO SEND AN EAGLE OVER YOUR NEST
[1:30:45] AND HE BE TO SCREAM TO YOU AND YOU knew
[1:30:48] this JUST WASN'T ANOTHER PREACHER. THIS
[1:30:51] WASN'T JUST ANOTHER VOICE, BUT THERE WAS
[1:30:53] A VOICE THAT WAS BEHIND THE VOICE AND
[1:30:56] YOU HAD THIRSTED FOR SOMETHING IN YOUR
[1:30:58] LIFE.
[1:31:03] MAYBE YOU CHANGED YOUR JOB 42 TIMES AND
[1:31:05] COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. BUT ONE DAY, GOD
[1:31:07] SPOKE TO YOUR HEART AND HE GAVE YOU TRUE
[1:31:10] DIRECTION. HE GAVE YOU TRUE HOPE. HE
[1:31:13] GAVE YOU TRUE UNDERSTANDING.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH MICHELANGELO?
[1:31:21] YOU'RE PART of the masterpiece.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; There's got to come one. HE SAID THAT
[1:31:32] HAS THERE'S GOT TO COME A REAL BRIDE.
[1:31:35] There must be one that's not only got
[1:31:37] the mechanics but the dynamics of it.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; He said that makes the church live
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; and move in the power of HIS
[1:31:46] RESURRECTION.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; UNTIL WE COME TO THAT PLACE, HE SAYS
[1:31:49] UNTIL WE FIND THAT PLACE, WHAT GOOD DOES
[1:31:51] IT DO TO POLISH THE HUMPS? WHAT GOOD
[1:31:54] DOES IT DO TO GIVE HER A FACEELIFT OR A
[1:31:56] SIMON'S JAW WHEN THERE'S NO DYNAMICS IN
[1:31:59] IT? THERE'S NO MATTER HOW MUCH MECHANICS
[1:32:01] YOU PROVE TO BE RIGHT. THERE'S GOT TO BE
[1:32:03] DYNAMICS TO MAKE IT WORK. HE SAID THAT'S
[1:32:06] WHAT HE PROVED. THAT'S WHAT EASTER
[1:32:08] PROVED. HE WASN'T ONLY THE WORD, BUT HE
[1:32:11] WAS GOD HIMSELF.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; THE DYNAMICS IN THE WORD.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. THAT MADE THE BODY OF
[1:32:19] JESUS CHRIST COLD, STIFF, DEAD IN THE
[1:32:22] GRAVE, SHAKEN TO LIFE AND RISE AGAIN AND
[1:32:24] ROLL AWAY THE STONE.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Watch what HE SAYS. HE SAID HE WAS THE
[1:32:33] DYNAMIST TO PROVE IT. AND IF HE BEING
[1:32:35] THE GROOM, THE BRIDE HAS TO COME forth
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; cuz it's PART OF HIM.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; IT CAN ONLY BE THE MANIFESTATION OF THE
[1:32:44] FULFILLING OF ALL THE REVELATIONS AND
[1:32:47] OTHERS THAT SPOKE OF THE BRIDE. AND IT
[1:32:49] CAN ONLY MANIFEST. AND IF IT DOES
[1:32:51] SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE GROOM, IT
[1:32:54] ISN'T THE BRIDE
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE'S FLESH OF HIS FLESH, BONE
[1:32:59] OF HIS BONE, LIFE OF HIS LIFE, POWER OF
[1:33:03] HIS POWER. She is him. Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Ron, I you just
[1:33:17] forgive me."
[1:33:20] But, you know, I've sat around church
[1:33:21] and I've never seen anything too
[1:33:23] blatantly miracle wise. Okay. Well, let
[1:33:27] me just stop here just for a moment and
[1:33:29] just give you a testimony.
[1:33:33] I grew up in a home that believed this
[1:33:35] message.
[1:33:38] My dad preached this message.
[1:33:44] And not only did he preach it, Brother
[1:33:45] Ernie, he lived it.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; We worked together in 1995
[1:33:54] as chimney sweeps. I told you the other
[1:33:56] night how the Lord brought me into the
[1:33:57] chimney sweep business.
[1:34:01] And one day I was working and and he was
[1:34:03] away on another job and I was working
[1:34:06] and
[1:34:08] I slipped.
[1:34:10] I fell 40 feet.
[1:34:13] I landed on concrete.
[1:34:16] I didn't see no angels.
[1:34:19] I didn't hear no voices.
[1:34:22] I felt that concrete crush my back.
[1:34:27] IT CRUSHED MY BACK FROM THE UP HERE UP
[1:34:29] INTO MY RIGHT HERE NEXT TO MY SKULL all
[1:34:32] the way down.
[1:34:34] THEY TOOK ME TO A TRAUMA CENTER.
[1:34:37] THEY BEGIN TO X-RAY IT AND MRI IT AND DO
[1:34:40] ALL THE WORKS. AND THE DOCTOR CAME IN
[1:34:43] AND HE SPOKE TO ME and he said, "Mr.
[1:34:46] Spencer,
[1:34:49] I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING."
[1:34:53] HE SAID, "YOUR BACK, EVERY VERTEBRAE IN
[1:34:55] YOUR back is broke.
[1:34:59] Four of them are completely crushed."
[1:35:04] You will AND AND I WANT YOU TO
[1:35:06] UNDERSTAND that if you can quickly
[1:35:08] realize this
[1:35:11] AND THE QUICKER YOU REALIZE IT AND COME
[1:35:13] TO TERMS WITH IT,
[1:35:16] THAT YOU WILL NEVER walk again.
[1:35:20] ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE.
[1:35:24] I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING SPOKE OUT OF MY
[1:35:26] HEART, BROTHER EDDIE.
[1:35:29] SO, I JUST SPOKE NOT WITH MY OWN POWER,
[1:35:32] BUT SOMETHING SPOKE TO THAT DOCTOR. YOU
[1:35:35] DON'T KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO.
[1:35:44] YOU'RE SITTING HERE TONIGHT AND YOU'RE
[1:35:45] SAYING, "BROTHER RON, YOU DON'T KNOW MY
[1:35:47] PROBLEMS." BUT IF YOU WOULD ONLY REALIZE
[1:35:49] WHO YOU ARE,
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'D ONLY REALIZE IN ANOTHER
[1:35:57] DIMENSION THERE ARE PEOPLE SCREAMING
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO COME TO YOUR POSITION.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I'M THE ONLY ONE IN MY
[1:36:06] FAMILY THIS WEARY CAMP ABOUT WITH SO
[1:36:09] GREAT A CLOUD OF WITNESSES.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS DETERMINED TO HAVE A BRIDE.
[1:36:15] LORD, MAY IT BE THIS CAMP THAT YOU
[1:36:18] DECIDE IN YOURSELF, IN YOUR OWN SELF. AS
[1:36:21] FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, WE WILL SERVE THE
[1:36:24] LORD.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; You say, "OH, BROTHER RON, BUT I SEE
[1:36:35] THIS IS WRONG AND THAT IS WRONG AND THIS
[1:36:38] IS WRONG AND THIS IS WRONG WITH THAT
[1:36:40] PERSON AND THIS IS WRONG WITH THAT
[1:36:42] PREACHER." BUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
[1:36:46] COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? GET THAT OUT OF
[1:36:50] YOU AND GOD WILL MAKE EVERYTHING WORK
[1:36:53] OUT FOR YOU,
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON. WE NEED A REVIVAL IN OUR
[1:36:59] CHURCH. LET IT START WITH YOU.
[1:37:08] JOHN SMITH PRAYED SO HARD FOR REVIVAL IN
[1:37:11] THAT CHURCH UNTIL HIS EYES SWELL SHUT.
[1:37:14] HIS WIFE WOULD LEAD HIM TO THE TO THE
[1:37:16] TABLE AND FEED HIM. BUT THERE WAS A
[1:37:19] LONGING IN HIS HEART FOR A REAL MOVE OF
[1:37:22] A REVIVAL IN THAT BAPTIST CHURCH.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IN THIRST, HE SAID
[1:37:28] MAYBE NOBODY IN THAT CHURCH IS LOOKING
[1:37:31] FOR REVIVAL. HE SAID, "LET IT BREAK OUT
[1:37:34] IN YOU."
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; My little dad came in.
[1:37:50] Forgive me for saying it like this, but
[1:37:53] I didn't need somebody to pray some
[1:37:54] pretty words.
[1:38:01] I needed somebody
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; that to pray some faith
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; when I couldn't pray it for myself.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; COME ON. SOMETIMES YOU GET TO A SPOT IN
[1:38:14] YOUR LIFE THAT YOU CAN'T DON'T HAVE THE
[1:38:16] ENERGY TO PRAY EVEN FOR YOURSELF.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. BROTHER RON, I DON'T
[1:38:21] NEED A PASTOR. I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
[1:38:22] YOU NEED ONE MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU
[1:38:24] NEED ONE.
[1:38:28] Come on, church.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; God ordained THAT MAN TO SEE YOU
[1:38:36] THROUGH.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; He can stand there and WEIGH THE THINGS
[1:38:40] OUT. WHEN ALL HELL'S AGAINST YOU, HE'LL
[1:38:42] BE AT YOUR SIDE. WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE HAS
[1:38:44] GIVE UP ON YOU, HE'LL STAND THERE WITH
[1:38:46] YOU BECAUSE OF THAT GIFT THAT'S LAYING
[1:38:49] INSIDE OF HIS LIFE.
[1:38:52] WHEN NOBODY ELSE UNDERSTANDS, HE
[1:38:54] UNDERSTANDS BECAUSE IT'S CHRIST INSIDE
[1:38:57] OF HIM THAT'S WATCHING OUT FOR YOU.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; My daddy walked in there and they HAD ME
[1:39:06] WRAPPED UP LIKE A MUMMY. I WAS LAYING ON
[1:39:09] THAT BED and pain FROM MY RIB CAGE UP
[1:39:11] WAS UNBEARABLE. I TELL YOU WHAT, MY DAD
[1:39:14] WALKED IN AND I'LL NEVER FORGET HIS
[1:39:16] PRAYER AS HE BE TO PRAY. HE SAID, "GOD,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; I AM YOUR SON.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; I AM YOUR SON AND THIS IS MY SON
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; AND YOU COMMISSION ME TO LAY HANDS ON
[1:39:42] THE SICK."
[1:39:48] COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; IT COMES TO YOUR TURN.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PREACHER'S NOT AROUND AND THE
[1:39:57] DEACONS IS NOT AROUND, MAMA, YOU CAN LAY
[1:40:00] YOUR HANDS ON THOSE CHILDREN IN THE NAME
[1:40:02] OF JESUS CHRIST. WHATEVER YOU BIND ON
[1:40:05] HER, WHATEVER YOU LOOSE ON EARTH,
[1:40:16] I'll tell you what, within an hour,
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; that doctor came in there and I felt
[1:40:22] pain go all the way TO MY FEET. WITHIN
[1:40:24] AN HOUR, THE SAME MAN THAT TOLD ME I'LL
[1:40:27] NEVER WALK AGAIN, HE SAID, "WE HAVE
[1:40:30] WITNESSED a miracle.
[1:40:50] And every DAY I PUT MY FEET ON THE
[1:40:51] FLOOR, I SAID, "DEVIL,
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; I CAN STILL WALK.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO KNOW I AM STILL AFTER YOU.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; I AM STILL YOUR WORST ENEMY.
[1:41:08] YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT THIS THING
[1:41:09] BACKWARDS. WE SIT HERE AND SAY, "OH, THE
[1:41:12] DEVIL'S TORMENTING ME.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL'S WORRYING ME." I'VE GOT NEWS
[1:41:16] for you.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; I WAS SENT HERE TO TORMENT HIM.
[1:41:40] Brother Ron, I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO WALK
[1:41:42] ON STREETS OF GOLD. YES, I'M I'M GLAD
[1:41:44] FOR THAT, TOO,
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE BODY
[1:41:47] CHANGE. I I AGREE WITH THAT, TOO. BUT I
[1:41:50] WANT YOU TO KNOW BETWEEN HERE AND THEN
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; BETWEEN HERE AND THEN. YEAH,
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO HATE HIM
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOING TO HATE ME.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE IS MORE
[1:42:17] THAN PAPER.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE IS MORE THAN JUST
[1:42:24] POETRY AND GOOD SERMONS PUT TOGETHER.
[1:42:27] BUT I BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE IS CHRIST TO
[1:42:29] THIS GENERATION.
[1:42:31] AND I BELIEVE IT LIVES. AND I BELIEVE
[1:42:33] THIS B IS BORN. LIFE OF HIS LIFE. POWER
[1:42:36] OF HIS POWER. I BELIEVE IT LIVES IN ME.
[1:42:39] I BELIEVE IT LIVES IN YOU.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Anything I hate to see is a spineless
[1:42:54] person that calls himself a Christian.
[1:42:58] GOD WANTS SOMEBODY WITH GRIT AND
[1:43:00] BACKBONE.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; LIKE OLD BUDDY ROBINSON SAID, "LORD,
[1:43:04] GIVE ME THE BACKBONE THE SIZE OF A SAW.
[1:43:06] PUT PLENTY OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE GABLE END
[1:43:08] OF MY SOUL." HE SAYS, "LET ME FIGHT THE
[1:43:11] DEVIL TILL THE AS LONG AS I'VE GOT A
[1:43:13] TOOTH AND AND THEN I'LL GUM HIM TO DEATH
[1:43:15] UNTIL I DIE.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR TURN."
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:43:27] YES, SIR.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; HE PREACHED IT TO ME IN 1983.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Your fault.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER. HE'S GETTING GRAYHEADED. I
[1:43:42] TELL YOU WHAT, HE'S PREACHING BETTER NOW
[1:43:44] THAN WHAT HE DID IN ' 83.
[1:44:03] Let me TELL YOU ONE REASON WHY. BECAUSE
[1:44:06] YOU'RE HERE.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE HERE PULLING ON THAT GIFT.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, WHY IS THIS CAMP MEETING
[1:44:14] BETTER? BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; AND NOT ONLY ARE YOU HERE, HE'S HERE.
[1:44:20] AMEN.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER RON, I WISH I COULD SEE HIM.
[1:44:35] I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. HE'S HERE. HE WAS
[1:44:37] HERE BEFORE YOU EVER WALKED IN THE TENT.
[1:44:39] HE WAS INVITED EARLIER THIS WEEK, AND HE
[1:44:42] HAS NOT LEFT THE BUILDING.
[1:44:51] BOY, I was wore out this morning.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; But I WANT YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING.
[1:44:56] THERE'S SOMETHING ANCHORED IN MY HEART.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING ANCHORED IN MY HEART.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; I was laying in that hospital in May.
[1:45:08] And on that night, I'LL JUST TELL YOU
[1:45:10] FOR THOSE THAT haven't been here,
[1:45:13] I had a stroke in May.
[1:45:16] I was walking through the yard.
[1:45:20] I didn't know what happened to me, but I
[1:45:22] had a stroke.
[1:45:24] Long of it all, ABOUT THE FOURTH DAY IN
[1:45:25] THE HOSPITAL. I was laying there with MY
[1:45:28] LEFT SIDE VERY WEAKENED. I WAS SICK.
[1:45:30] EVERY TIME I'D ROLL MY HEAD OVER, I
[1:45:32] THROW UP. Somewhere around the fourth
[1:45:35] night, I was praying. There was a
[1:45:37] special presence came into the room.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Not concerned whether you believe that
[1:45:41] or not,
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; but he came in the room.
[1:45:46] I'm not trying TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF
[1:45:47] MYSELF. Cuz listen, I PUT MY FINGER IN A
[1:45:50] BUCKET OF WATER, PULL IT OUT, AND FIND A
[1:45:51] HOLE. THAT'S HOW THAT'S WHAT I AM.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; I'LL LEAVE THIS MEETING. I'LL GO BACK TO
[1:45:58] A LITTLE CABIN THAT'S A MILE OFF OF THE
[1:46:00] ROAD. HARDLY NOBODY KNOWS MY NAME,
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; BUT HE DOES.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; BUT I WAS LAYING THERE AND I AM HIS SON.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:16] AS I WAS LAYING THERE AND I WAS PRAYING,
[1:46:19] I FELT THAT PRESENCE OF THE LORD COME
[1:46:22] IN.
[1:46:24] DON'T YOU THINK FOR A SECOND THAT THE
[1:46:26] DEVIL HADN'T TRIED TO FILL ME WITH DOUBT
[1:46:29] AND FILL ME WITH FEAR AND TELL ME THAT
[1:46:31] THERE'S BEEN PEOPLE HAD STROKES THAT
[1:46:34] NEVER GOT BACK OUT OF THE BED, NEVER GOT
[1:46:36] THEIR STRENGTH BACK, NEVER GOT THEIR
[1:46:39] THEIR VOCAL CORDS BACK IN THE RIGHT
[1:46:41] ORDER,
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; NEVER GOT THEIR EYES BACK THE RIGHT WAY.
[1:46:44] AND THAT DEVIL WAS WHISPERING IN MY EAR
[1:46:47] THE VERY SAME WORDS.
[1:46:50] BUT I'LL TELL YOU, ON THAT SPECIAL
[1:46:52] NIGHT, GOD CAME INTO THAT ROOM.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU HOW STRONG IT WAS. THERE
[1:46:59] WAS A NURSE. IT WAS HER FIRST NIGHT ON
[1:47:01] DUTY. OTHER NURSES KNEW THAT I WAS A
[1:47:03] MINISTER. THEY HAD SEEN THE PEOPLE COME
[1:47:05] IN AND OUT, IN AND OUT, AND SHE WAS
[1:47:07] WORKING ONLY A THREE-HOUR SHIFT DURING
[1:47:09] THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. AND SHE WALKS
[1:47:10] IN WITH A FLASHLIGHT CUZ I'M LIGHT
[1:47:12] SENSITIVE. AND SHE WALKS IN WITH A
[1:47:14] FLASHLIGHT TO CHECK ALL OF MY MY VITAL
[1:47:16] SIGNS TO CHECK MY STRENGTH IN MY left
[1:47:18] side. AND AS SHE WAS WORKING, SHE SAID,
[1:47:21] "MR. SPENCER."
[1:47:24] And I said, "Yes, ma'am."
[1:47:27] She said,
[1:47:29] "Have you been praying?"
[1:47:34] I said, "Yes, ma'am."
[1:47:36] She said, "I'm not a Christian."
[1:47:40] She said, "BUT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED to
[1:47:41] be."
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; She said, "They told me that you're a
[1:47:44] preacher, AND WHEN I WALKED THROUGH THAT
[1:47:47] DOOR, I FELT SOMETHING."
[1:48:00] THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU,
[1:48:05] BRAD. THERE'S A LIFE THAT JUST FLOWS OUT
[1:48:08] OF YOU.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Right there, SHE GOT TO THE SIDE OF HER
[1:48:13] BED. SHE GOT DOWN ON HER KNEES AND SHE
[1:48:15] BE TO CALL ON THE LORD, "FATHER, FORGIVE
[1:48:18] ME." I HEARD HER SNIFFLING EVEN BEFORE
[1:48:21] THAT SHE EVEN ASKED ME IF I WAS AWAKE.
[1:48:23] THE PRESENCE OF GOD WAS ALREADY WORKING
[1:48:27] ON HER LIFE.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, he's real.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; I QUOTED TO YOU EARLIER THAT GABRIEL SIT
[1:48:37] ON MOSES'S ARK.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; AND I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. ANGELS
[1:48:44] ARE WATCHING OVER YOU.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; THE SAINTS OF ALL THE AGES STAND
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; JUST ANTICIPATING WHAT COULD GO ON in a
[1:49:05] meeting like this.
[1:49:09] You say, "Oh, brother Ron, but the
[1:49:11] scripture says greater works
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; shall you do."
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; WE'VE ALREADY SAW THAT THIS WEEK.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Lives have been eternally changed.
[1:49:37] He said, "THERE'S THE BODY OF CHRIST
[1:49:39] LIVING,
[1:49:40] STANDING,
[1:49:42] REDEEMED,
[1:49:44] justified in his sight." WHY ARE WE
[1:49:47] JUSTIFIED?
[1:49:48] WE ARE HIS VICTORY.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO SEE CHRIST'S VICTORY? RUB
[1:49:55] YOUR SHOULDERS.
[1:50:02] WHAT DID HE OVERCOME IN THIS DAY? DRUGS,
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; ALCOHOL, DENOMINATIONALISM.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; THE CHURCH IS HIS VICTORY. WE COME FORTH
[1:50:13] IN THESE LAST DAYS WITH THIS GLORIOUS
[1:50:16] GOSPEL SHOWING HIS VICTORY.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST OUR VICTORY, HIS VICTORY.
[1:50:36] Can I read you one more quote?
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Boy, it's hot up here.
[1:50:49] Brother Brandham is praying.
[1:50:52] Heavenly Father,
[1:50:54] as we read of the Bible of what you said
[1:50:56] about sin and those who do it and not
[1:50:59] confess, we realize what it means to die
[1:51:02] without knowing God.
[1:51:06] Do we know that by an experience of
[1:51:08] others
[1:51:10] that we sing goal,
[1:51:12] those who intended
[1:51:15] and not possessed
[1:51:22] and said and had not possessed what they
[1:51:25] said they had.
[1:51:28] THOSE WHO ACTED LIKE Christians
[1:51:31] yet never was a Christian,
[1:51:34] their life proved it
[1:51:37] and their death made it manifest.
[1:51:41] Now, Father, I pray that you'll speak to
[1:51:43] every heart here tonight
[1:51:46] and myself, Lord, for being dilatory
[1:51:50] for many things that I could have done
[1:51:52] and did not do.
[1:51:54] I confess my wrong.
[1:51:57] I confess the wrongs of this people.
[1:52:01] I confess the wrongs of this nation.
[1:52:04] I ask you to have mercy.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; I've got three children to raise. We're
[1:52:10] living here in a hot spot, God. There's
[1:52:13] no need of running. We know about it,
[1:52:16] God. I know. I want to be right with
[1:52:18] you.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Someday if the atomic bomb don't get us,
[1:52:22] a wreck will.
[1:52:25] If a rat don't get us, some disease,
[1:52:27] WELL, SOMETHING HAS got to take us. But
[1:52:31] we're so happy TO KNOW THERE IS A WAY OF
[1:52:34] ESCAPE.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; The name of the LORD IS A STRONG TOWER
[1:52:39] AND THE RIGHTEOUS RUN into
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; and are safe.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; God, MAY EVERY SINNER FRIEND TONIGHT,
[1:52:46] BOY, GIRL, MAN, WOMAN, SEE THE OPEN
[1:52:48] DOOR, THE OPPORTUNITY, AND RUN TO CHRIST
[1:52:52] THIS HOUR.
[1:52:55] HE SAID, "While we HAVE OUR HEADS BOWED,
[1:52:57] IS THERE SOME OF that would like to say
[1:53:00] an UPLIFTED HAND TO GOD, I'M ASHAMED OF
[1:53:02] my life? I want to CONFESS MY WRONGS
[1:53:04] BEFORE GOD AND ASK GOD FOR MERCY."
[1:53:09] SO, Brother Ron, why are you doing this?
[1:53:10] He's going to preach a sermon.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. God bless
[1:53:15] you. There's many of you. There's many
[1:53:17] of you here tonight. God bless you.
[1:53:20] Many of you who've professed
[1:53:21] Christianity for a long time and know
[1:53:24] that you have failed to tow the line
[1:53:25] with God.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; I pray that this is more than a quote to
[1:53:29] some of you.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Know that YOU'RE DOING THINGS RIGHT NOW
[1:53:36] THAT YOU OUGHT NOT TO do and you're
[1:53:39] going to confess unconfessing them.
[1:53:43] just loosely floating along with the
[1:53:45] tide looking at a kind of programs that
[1:53:48] you should not look at looking at the
[1:53:50] kind of magazines and reading literature
[1:53:52] that you should not read.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; That's not becoming TO CHRISTIANS
[1:53:56] LISTENING TO THE JOKES foul foul dirt
[1:54:00] smut that you shouldn't do.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Both men AND WOMEN YOU KNOW THE PLACES
[1:54:04] THAT YOU SPOKE AND DID NOT DO it
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; and you're guilty of the sin OF
[1:54:08] OMISSION. AND I WONDER IF YOU'D RAISE
[1:54:10] YOUR HAND TO HAVE CHRIST'S MERCY UPON
[1:54:11] YOU and forgive you. HE SAID, AS THE
[1:54:15] WOMAN WALKS OUT TO COME TO THE ALTAR TO
[1:54:17] CONFESS your her sins, he says, RAISE
[1:54:20] YOUR HANDS TO GOD, BUD. GOD BLESS YOU.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; That's right, MISTER. THAT'S RIGHT. GOD
[1:54:24] BLESS YOU. RAISE your hands. YOU KNOW
[1:54:27] YOU'VE done wrong.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; I wonder if YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TONIGHT
[1:54:32] TO MEET AT THE ALTAR AND KNEEL DOWN HERE
[1:54:35] AND SAY, "GOD, BE MERCIFUL TO US. WE'RE
[1:54:37] IN NEED OF YOU.
[1:54:39] TO SEE THESE YOUNG WOMEN COMING weeping
[1:54:43] life before them. They're at a
[1:54:44] crossroad.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE, OH MEN, THAT WE WERE
[1:54:51] ONCE BOYS?
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; OUR BOYS HAS GOT 10 TIMES THE TEMPTATION
[1:54:57] THAT WE HAD. SISTER, DO YOU REALIZE THAT
[1:55:00] YOUR DAUGHTER HAS 10 TIMES THE
[1:55:02] TEMPTATION THAT YOU HAVE?
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD HER DAUGHTER HAVE?
[1:55:08] LOOK AT THE PICTURES THE DEVIL'S
[1:55:09] PAINTING.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; OH, HOW WE NEED TO PRAY.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, DO YOU REALIZE WE DON'T PRAY
[1:55:16] HALF AS MUCH AS YOUR FATHERS DID?
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; PASTOR, DO YOU KNOW THAT WE DON'T PRAY
[1:55:21] PUT AS MUCH TIME ON OUR KNEES AS THE
[1:55:23] PASTORS BEFORE US DID? WOMEN, DO YOU
[1:55:26] REALIZE THAT YOU DON'T INSTRUCT YOUR
[1:55:27] DAUGHTER AND PRAY AT NIGHT LIKE YOUR
[1:55:29] MOTHER DID YOU?
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT ABOUT IT? WHO'S GUILTY?
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GUILTY.
[1:55:38] THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT. WE'RE GUILTY.
[1:55:40] I'M GUILTY.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; I'M GUILTY OF NOT DOING THE JOB LIKE GOD
[1:55:44] LIKE I SHOULD DO. I'M CONFESSING IT THAT
[1:55:47] I'M WRONG. I'M ASKING GOD TO BE MERCIFUL
[1:55:49] ME TO ME.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER ROWAN, WHAT DOES THAT
[1:55:52] HAVE TO DO WITH CANDLESTICKS? WHAT DOES
[1:55:54] THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE REVELATIONS
[1:55:56] ONE? IT'S YOUR TURN.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; THEY RUN THE RACE.
[1:56:03] THEY DID IT WITH ALL THEIR ENERGY. NOW
[1:56:06] IT'S OUR TURN. LET US LAY ASIDE EVERY
[1:56:10] WEIGHT, EVERY SIN WHICH DOES SO EASILY
[1:56:13] BESET US. LET US RUN THIS RACE WITH
[1:56:16] PATIENCE. THE RACE THAT IS SET BEFORE
[1:56:18] US.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT 10 TIMES THE TEMPTATION THAT
[1:56:24] I HAD.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; 100 TIMES THE TEMPTATION THAT YOUR
[1:56:29] GRANDFATHER HAD.
[1:56:31] A THOUSAND TIMES THE TEMPTATION THAT
[1:56:33] YOUR GRANDFATHER HAD.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; 10,000 TIMES THE TEMPTATION THAT YOUR
[1:56:40] GREAT-GRANDFATHER HAD.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; God help us tonight.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; GOD HELP US TONIGHT. OH MY, BROTHER.
[1:56:49] GOD'S MOVED THE LAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS,
[1:56:51] BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW HE SPOKE TO YOU
[1:56:53] TONIGHT.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR TURN.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU CAN'T BLAME NOBODY ELSE FOR
[1:56:58] YOUR PROBLEMS. BROTHER RON, YOU DON'T
[1:57:00] KNOW WHAT I WENT THROUGH AS A CHILD. LET
[1:57:03] ME JUST SAY WE'VE ALL HAD PROBLEMS.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; WE'VE ALL WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; WE'VE ALL WENT THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE
[1:57:12] TEMPTATION.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS PUT US ALL THROUGH THE GRINDING
[1:57:15] MILL.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; HE'S GROUND US.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; HE'S MOLDED US.
[1:57:25] ME, YOU.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; He left Jesus alone in the garden of
[1:57:30] Eden, Garden of Gethsemane.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES HE'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE'S NO FATHER OR MOTHER, NO
[1:57:38] SISTERS OR BROTHERS, NO POWER, NO PASTOR
[1:57:40] AROUND.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; HE'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR YOU TO WORK IT
[1:57:44] OUT WITH GOD,
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; TO COME TO THAT PLACE WITH GOD. I PRAY
[1:57:50] TO GOD THAT GOD SO SHAKES OUR WORLD
[1:57:52] TONIGHT.
[1:57:54] SO SHAKES OUR WORLD. LIKE JOHN SAID,
[1:57:56] "LET THE AXE BE LAID TO THE ROOT OF THE
[1:57:58] TREE."
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; I PRAY OUR TREE GETS SO SHOOK TONIGHT
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; UNTIL WE FIND OURSELVES.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, WHY ARE YOU PREACHING like
[1:58:11] this? I'm trying to close, but
[1:58:13] something's not letting me.
[1:58:21] We've had too much Hollywood evangelism.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THE BEST SINGERS IN THE WORLD.
[1:58:34] THANK GOD FOR THAT.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TALENT THAT THE WORLD KNOWS
[1:58:37] NOTHING ABOUT.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THE SOME OF THE BEST MUSIC IN
[1:58:40] THE WORLD.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE GOT SOME OF THE BEST PREACHERS
[1:58:44] THAT EVER PUT THEIR PRETTY FEET DOWN
[1:58:46] INSIDE A SHOE LEATHER.
[1:58:49] BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN ALL OF
[1:58:51] THAT.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU GETTING ALONG
[1:58:55] WITH GOD.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; The devil's not scared of our singing.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; He's not scared of our our music.
[1:59:11] Brother John,
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; he's not even scared of our preaching.
[1:59:19] cuz he transforms himself as an angel of
[1:59:21] light.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Listen, Methodists don't deceive us.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Baptists don't deceive us.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DECEASES IS WHEN THOSE LITTLE
[1:59:31] FOXES CLIMB RIGHT UP INTO OUR CHURCH.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; AND WE GET COMFORTABLE SITTING ON OUR
[1:59:36] PEW AND FORGET THAT WE'VE GOT MORE MORE
[1:59:39] DEMONS, MORE TEMPTATION. OUR CHILDREN,
[1:59:42] WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR THEM.
[1:59:46] THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING HERE TONIGHT. I'M
[1:59:48] NOT ONLY FIGHTING FOR THE CHILDREN, BUT
[1:59:49] I'M FIGHTING FOR SOME HOMES.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'M SO BUSY
[1:59:55] WORKING." LET ME JUST SAY, YOU CAN YOU
[1:59:57] YOU CAN TAKE DAYS OFF AND GO TO CHURCH.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; WE TELL GOD, "GOD, I NEED A VACATION."
[2:00:04] AND WE'LL TAKE A VACATION FROM CHURCH.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, TAKE VACATIONS FROM WORK.
[2:00:14] TAKE VACATIONS FROM YOUR PART-TIME JOB,
[2:00:16] BUT DON'T TAKE VACATIONS FROM GOD.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I need a LITTLE TIME OFF. IT'S
[2:00:32] BECAUSE HE SO PUT IT AGAINST US.
[2:00:36] AND WE'LL TAKE TIME OFF AND WE'LL GO
[2:00:38] STAND IN THE LINE WITH 14,000 OTHER
[2:00:40] PEOPLE
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; looking for the same spot.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, there is a refuge.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A PLACE THAT WE CAN RUN TO.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; RIGHT HERE'S A VERY GOOD PLACE.
[2:00:58] A PLACE WHERE WE CAN FIND A RENEWAL,
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; A RE-ENERGIZING.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, IF I WALK TO THE ALTAR,
[2:01:07] PEOPLE THINK I'M BACKSLID. OH, NO. YOU
[2:01:09] JUST COME WANTING MORE OF GOD.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; I look out here and see the
[2:01:18] opportunities I've missed because of
[2:01:20] petty things.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Imagine that rich young ruler could say
[2:01:26] that tonight.
[2:01:33] I preach funerals
[2:01:35] and look in the casket
[2:01:38] and I think of the petty things that
[2:01:41] caused them not to be Christians.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Maybe it was a habit that they put in
[2:01:48] their pocket.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Maybe it WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY DRANK
[2:01:54] THROUGH A BOTTLE.
[2:01:58] Maybe it was a woman.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; MAYBE IT WAS A MAN.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Lock could also give us a testimony
[2:02:08] service tonight.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; HOWARD HUGHES COULD ALSO GIVE US A
[2:02:12] TESTIMONY service tonight. THE RICH
[2:02:15] YOUNG RULER COULD GIVE US A TESTIMONY
[2:02:16] service tonight.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:27] Elvis Presley
[2:02:33] stood in his granddaddy's tent, probably
[2:02:36] something like this
[2:02:40] and played music
[2:02:43] as his granddaddy would preach
[2:02:47] and confess that he was filled with the
[2:02:49] Holy Ghost.
[2:02:53] But he sold it out.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Let me just say it's the little foxes
[2:03:01] that get the vine.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Something just slipped up. I don't even
[2:03:05] know why I'm going this way tonight, but
[2:03:06] maybe something's pulling.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; I intended to go a complete different
[2:03:10] direction. I prayed I prayed for weeks
[2:03:13] at this sermon, but something's pulled
[2:03:15] me in this direction tonight.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:22] If Elvis Presley could stand here
[2:03:24] tonight,
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Cadillacs wouldn't mean anything.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; BEING THE KING OF ROCK AND ROLL WOULD
[2:03:33] NOT MEAN ANYTHING.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; I SAY YOU TONIGHT, BEING THE CEO OF A
[2:03:37] COMPANY DON'T MEAN MUCH.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; HAVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DON'T MEAN
[2:03:42] MUCH.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; IF YOU LO IF YOU GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; AND YOU LOSE YOUR SOUL,
[2:03:51] BROTHER RON, BUT MY FRIENDS WILL LEAVE
[2:03:53] ME. IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE LEADING YOU TO
[2:03:55] HELL AND THEY'RE THE WRONG INFLUENCE,
[2:03:58] THEY'RE NOT YOUR FRIENDS.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; BUT, Brother Ryan, I'M AFTER A BOY. I'M
[2:04:11] AFTER A GIRL. AND IF I REALLY DEDICATE
[2:04:14] MY HEART TO GOD, I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
[2:04:17] GOD WILL GIVE YOU A BOY, HE'LL GIVE YOU
[2:04:19] THE RIGHT KIND OF A GIRL.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOUR CHARACTER IS PULLING YOU
[2:04:28] AFTER THE WRONG KIND OF A GIRL, YOU NEED
[2:04:30] TO RECHECK YOUR CHARACTER.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; IF IF IF WHAT MAKES YOUR HEART TICK,
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; IF A SERVICE LIKE THIS DON'T MAKE YOUR
[2:04:39] HEART TICK, YOU NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT
[2:04:40] REALLY MAKES YOUR HEART TICK.
[2:04:46] IF THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE IN THE
[2:04:48] WORLD OR SOMETHING LACKING,
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; I'm a hunter, but I don't let hunting
[2:04:57] come between me and God.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; I've made good money in life, BUT I'VE
[2:05:05] NEVER LET MONEY COME BETWEEN ME AND GOD.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. It's nice to HAVE A
[2:05:12] GOOD HOME,
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T LET A GOOD HOME BECOME BETWEEN
[2:05:15] YOU AND GOD.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; IT'LL BE ASHES IN A FEW DAYS.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, BUT I'M GAINING POPULARITY.
[2:05:29] LISTEN, Satan would like to sell you all
[2:05:31] kind of possibilities.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Do you have time?
[2:05:53] I have sat with men and women.
[2:05:58] I've sat with men and women.
[2:06:01] I'm not going to tell you what party,
[2:06:04] but I've sat with them and they made me
[2:06:06] proposition.
[2:06:08] Ron, BECAUSE OF YOUR BUSINESS, BECAUSE
[2:06:11] OF YOUR PERSONALITY, BECAUSE OF THE WAY
[2:06:13] THAT YOU DO BUSINESS, WE'D LIKE TO PUT
[2:06:16] YOU ON COURSE TO BE AN ESTATE SENATOR.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; WE'D LIKE TO GET YOU INTO GOVERNMENT. WE
[2:06:24] NEED SOMEBODY LIKE YOU.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT YOU WIN.
[2:06:35] ALLURING,
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; BUT WHY WOULD I WANT TO STEP DOWN?
[2:06:56] WHY WOULD I WANT TO STEP DOWN FROM
[2:06:58] HAVING THE GREATEST POSITION IN THE
[2:07:00] UNIVERSE
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; TALKING TO THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; TO HAVING A DIRTY ROTTEN POLITICS JOB?
[2:07:25] Come on, CHURCH. HE'LL COME ALONG AND
[2:07:28] HE'LL OFFER YOU THE WORLD. AND LOT SAW
[2:07:30] ALL THE POSSIBILITIES
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; AND HE PITCHED HIS TENT TOWARDS SODOM.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY FOOLISH VIRGINS
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; SIT RIGHT HERE?
[2:07:48] AND LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY IS AROUND.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID I'LL BE A FANATIC.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT ENOUGH ALL FOR A WHILE. I JUST
[2:07:58] WANT JUST ENOUGH MESSAGE TO HANG ON TO.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WANT MORE AND MORE
[2:08:05] AND MORE AND MORE.
[2:08:19] I look out here and see all the
[2:08:20] opportunities as I've missed because of
[2:08:22] petty things,
[2:08:24] little insignificant things that didn't
[2:08:26] mean nothing.
[2:08:28] I'm ashamed of myself as a gospel
[2:08:30] preacher minister before you. I repent
[2:08:34] before God and I ask you to forgive me
[2:08:37] and the church to forgive me for being
[2:08:39] dilatory about the work of God. And
[2:08:42] brother Renham felt that way
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God and the help of God.
[2:08:57] Everyone trying to tell you something to
[2:08:58] do. They got a program. They got
[2:09:00] something for you to do.
[2:09:02] I know God's program.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; It's written out here in the Bible. I'M
[2:09:08] ASHAMED OF MYSELF AS A MINISTER OF THE
[2:09:10] GOSPEL. One million souls won. I ought
[2:09:14] to have won 10 million souls.
[2:09:18] I'M WAY BEHIND.
[2:09:20] WHAT ABOUT YOU?
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY SOULS HAVE YOU WON SINCE YOU'VE
[2:09:25] BEEN TO CHRIST?
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; CHRISTIANITY GOES FROM ONE TO ANOTHER.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW MANY SOULS HAVE YOU WON SINCE
[2:09:32] YOU'VE BEEN A CHRISTIAN?
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE NOT WINNING SOULS, YOU'RE
[2:09:37] GUILTY, BARREN,
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; BROUGHT SHAME TO THE CHURCH AND THE
[2:09:41] GOSPEL.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I have fought and fought and
[2:09:45] fought not to have to read this tonight.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know this is real.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; He says, u be ashamed of yourself before
[2:09:55] Christ. Guilty. our place at the altar.
[2:10:01] HE SAYS, "I INVITE YOU TO COME AND WITH
[2:10:03] ME for repentance.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; I invite you to come with me
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; for repentance.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many more days we have
[2:10:23] left.
[2:10:26] I don't know how many hours we got left,
[2:10:30] but every hour of every day,
[2:10:34] I want to spend as much energy as I've
[2:10:37] got.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Everything that is within me,
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; you forgive me for being simple tonight,
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; but I want to challenge you tonight.
[2:10:52] WHATEVER TIME THAT WE'VE GOT LEFT ON
[2:10:54] THIS EARTH,
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU,
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; MOM, DAD, SISTER, BROTHER,
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; MINISTER,
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO CHALLENGE US TONIGHT. WHAT ARE
[2:11:08] WE DOING?
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; HOW ARE WE SPENDING OUR ENERGIES?
[2:11:21] HOW ARE WE SPENDING OUR TIME?
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT THE SAME 24 HOURS THAT
[2:11:26] EVERYBODY ELSE HAS GOT.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I'M POOR. I'M SURE THE
[2:11:31] WOMAN IN MEMPHIS WAS POOR,
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE KNOW HOW TO GO ON HER KNEES AND
[2:11:37] SAY, "WHERE IS MY ELIJAH AT?"
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL
[2:11:45] ABOUT THE MESSAGE. I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T
[2:11:47] EITHER.
[2:11:49] BUT SHE CALLED ON HER ELIJAH.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; HE CALLED ON GOD.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, when he walked into
[2:11:59] that home, he said, "I could tell she
[2:12:01] had been talking to God."
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; I like it when I PICK UP THE PHONE AND A
[2:12:06] MAMA OR A DADDY'S TALKING ON THE OTHER
[2:12:08] END OF THAT PHONE.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN ALREADY FEEL THE PRESENCE OF
[2:12:12] GOD.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ALREADY FEEL THE PRESENCE OF THE
[2:12:17] LORD. THE SENSE OF URGENCY COMING
[2:12:19] THROUGH THE PHONE.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SENSE THE SUPERNATURAL POWER OF
[2:12:24] GOD. BROTHER RON, I'M WAITING ON
[2:12:26] SOMEBODY ELSE. IT'S YOUR TURN.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Song leaders can't do it all for you.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; MUSICIANS CAN'T DO IT ALL for you.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Ministers can't do it all FOR YOU. I
[2:12:42] CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:12:45] LET CHRIST HAVE HIS WAY IN YOUR LIFE.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; RAISE YOUR FLAG TONIGHT
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "GOD, I WANT TO GET OUT OF THE
[2:12:55] WAY.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO USE ME.
[2:13:00] LORD,
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; if he took A PICTURE OF ME BEFORE THE
[2:13:03] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, I WANT HIM TO
[2:13:05] USE ME. IF HE PRE-PLANNED A JOB FOR ME
[2:13:08] TO DO, I WANT HIM TO USE ME.
[2:13:16] I PRAY CONVICTION FALLS IN THIS BUILDING
[2:13:19] LIKE IT'S NEVER FELL BEFORE.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:13:26] HALLELUJAH. I PRAY A BURDEN FOR MORE
[2:13:29] LOST SOULS. I PRAY A BURDEN FOR A DEEPER
[2:13:32] WALK WITH GOD. I PRAY A A BURDEN A
[2:13:36] BURDEN FOR COMING TO CHURCH WITH A REAL
[2:13:39] BURDEN ON YOUR HEART.
[2:13:42] I PRAY IT STRIKES THIS BUILDING TONIGHT.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; LORD JESUS, WE BOW OUR HEADS BEFORE YOU
[2:13:50] TONIGHT.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; WE ARE AWARE THAT SOMETHING HAS MOVED
[2:13:56] INTO THIS TENT.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; I STAND HERE WEAK IN MY BODY TONIGHT,
[2:14:05] BUT I STAND HERE WITH SOMETHING CALLING
[2:14:08] OUT FROM ME TONIGHT. FATHER,
[2:14:10] THERE'S A BURDEN LIKE JOSHUA HAD. SOME
[2:14:14] HASN'T TAKEN their land.
[2:14:16] SOME HASN'T POSSESSED THEIR LAND. SOME
[2:14:19] HASN'T CLAIMED THEIR INHERITANCE
[2:14:21] TONIGHT. PAUL'S WAITING ON THEM. PETER'S
[2:14:24] WAITING ON THEM. JAMES IS WAITING ON
[2:14:26] THEM.
[2:14:28] THE PEOPLE OF ALL THE AGES IS WAITING ON
[2:14:30] THEM. AND GOD IS DETERMINED.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK OUR PICTURE BEFORE THE
[2:14:36] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. HE HAS CALLED
[2:14:39] US. HE HAS ELECTED US. HE HAS CHOSEN US.
[2:14:44] HE HAS PREDESTINATED US.
[2:14:48] HE HAS JUSTIFIED US. AND HE'S ALREADY
[2:14:51] GLORIFIED US TONIGHT. OH GOD, I PRAY
[2:14:55] TONIGHT WE INVITE YOU TO OUR PEW. WE
[2:14:58] INVITE YOU TO OUR SAKE. LORD, YOU SEE
[2:15:01] OUR HUNGERING HEART. LORD, WE WANT MORE
[2:15:03] OF YOU TONIGHT. I PRAY THAT YOU WILL
[2:15:06] SPEAK TO OUR HEARTS, SPEAK TO OUR LIVES.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; What are we GOING TO DO WITH THIS JESUS
[2:15:22] CALLED CHRIST? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
[2:15:24] WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR? LORD, IT'S
[2:15:27] NOT OUR INTENTIONS. IT'S WHAT WE'RE
[2:15:29] DOING WITH IT. YESTERDAY'S EXPERIENCE
[2:15:32] WON'T WORK FOR TODAY. OH GOD, SEND YOUR
[2:15:35] WORD. SEND YOUR WORD AMONG US TONIGHT. I
[2:15:38] PRAY THAT YOU WE CAN REACH OUT LORD
[2:15:40] JESUS AS YOU PASS BY TONIGHT. TOUCH OUR
[2:15:43] HEARTS.
[2:16:09] Lord Jesus,
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; there might be one in the building
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; who has shook off
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; and shook off the spirit of the Lord
[2:16:27] over and over and over again,
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Lord. Maybe they've come to THESE
[2:16:35] MEETINGS YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND
[2:16:38] THEY'VE CYCLED THROUGH THIS camp
[2:16:41] and in two or three weeks they're the
[2:16:43] same condition.
[2:16:45] I pray tonight
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; that that thing is shook.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; That weight THAT IS SO HOLDING US BACK,
[2:17:01] THE SIN WHICH IS SO EASILY BESET US, THE
[2:17:04] WEAKNESS THAT IS IN OUR BODY, THE
[2:17:06] WEAKNESS THAT IS IN OUR FLESH THAT KEEPS
[2:17:08] PULLING US BACK TO THE THINGS OF THE
[2:17:09] WORLD. I PRAY THAT THING IS DEFEATED
[2:17:12] tonight in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:18] WE RAISE OUR WHITE FLAG TONIGHT TO YOU,
[2:17:21] FATHER, IN A TOTAL SURRENDER, FATHER.
[2:17:25] LORD, BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE, THE MIGHTY
[2:17:28] ANGEL OF THE LORD IS IN THE BUILDING
[2:17:30] TONIGHT. AND I PRAY THAT, FATHER, THAT
[2:17:33] YOU WILL COME TO OUR HUNGRY HEARTS.
[2:17:41] OH GOD,
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; MAYBE WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR ALTAR.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; LORD JESUS, MAYBE BROTHER BROWN'S VOICE
[2:17:49] HAS BECOME A STRANGER IN OUR HOME. MAYBE
[2:17:52] OUR PRAYER LIFE HAS VANISHED, LORD, WITH
[2:17:54] CONVICTION IN OUR HEART TONIGHT.
[2:17:58] LORD, YOU WON'T ALWAYS DEAL LIKE THIS.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE WILL COME A TIME THAT
[2:18:03] YOU WON'T DEAL ANYMORE. THERE WILL COME
[2:18:05] A TIME TO WORD THAT THERE WON'T BE
[2:18:07] NOBODY FEEL THE PULL. BUT LORD, WHILE
[2:18:10] YOU'RE PULLING TONIGHT, WE ANSWER THE
[2:18:12] CALL TONIGHT. LORD, WE ANSWER THE CALL.
[2:18:16] WE ANSWER THE BROODING OF THE HOLY
[2:18:18] SPIRIT. LORD, COME TO OUR HEARTS. COME
[2:18:21] TO OUR LIVES TONIGHT, LORD JESUS.
[2:18:37] LORD, there are those that are sick
[2:18:38] tonight.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Diseases may have followed in their
[2:18:44] family. Oh God,
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; weaknesses of sugar diabetes,
[2:18:50] A BRUISED SAIL CALLED CANCER GR.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; LORD, THERE'S ENOUGH POWER IN THIS
[2:18:57] BUILDING TONIGHT.
[2:19:04] LORD, I believe just as MUCH AS YOU HEAL
[2:19:06] MY BACK.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; LORD, THAT YOU PUT BACK TO EVERY
[2:19:10] VERTEBRAE. YOU HEAL ME OF THAT STROKE
[2:19:13] THE OTHER DAY. LORD, THESE SIGNS SHALL
[2:19:15] FOLLOW THEM THAT BELIEVE.
[2:19:28] LORD, AS WE RAISE OUR HANDS BEFORE YOU
[2:19:30] TONIGHT, I DEFY THE ARMIES OF HELL IN
[2:19:34] THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. SATAN CAN TAKE
[2:19:37] YOUR HANDS OFF OF GOD'S CHILDREN AND MAY
[2:19:40] YOU deliver them and may you set them
[2:19:42] free.
[2:19:46] Hallelujah.
[2:19:48] Hallelujah.
[2:19:50] We're free.
[2:19:52] We're free.
[2:19:53] We're free AT THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
[2:20:24] We applied the token.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Our children slipped away. God.
[2:20:30] Lord, I CALL FOR REDEMPTION TONIGHT
[2:20:34] BECAUSE WE'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[2:20:37] YOU SAID, "ASK THE FATHER ANYTHING IN MY
[2:20:40] NAME THAT I'LL DO." I ask you that you
[2:20:43] would SEND THE RESTING ANGEL TONIGHT. GO
[2:20:46] GET OUR KIDS.
[2:20:49] Go get OUR LOST LOVED ONES. FATHER,
[2:20:52] SPEAK TO THEIR HEARTS IN THE NAME OF
[2:20:54] JESUS CHRIST.
[2:20:58] HALLELUJAH.
[2:21:00] HALLELUJAH.
[2:21:02] HALLELUJAH. SAINTS, WON'T YOU WORSHIP
[2:21:04] HIM? WON'T YOU WORSHIP HIM TONIGHT?
[2:21:09] HE'S ALL WE NEED. HE'S ALL WE NEED.
[2:21:14] YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEG GOD TO COME. HE'S
[2:21:16] HERE.
[2:21:18] JUST PRAISE HIM FOR IT. JUST WORSHIP THE
[2:21:21] KING TONIGHT. YOU'RE HIS WIFE. YOU'RE
[2:21:24] THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN.
[2:21:41] Satan don't EVEN HAVE THE KEYS TO HIS
[2:21:43] OWN HOUSE.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET HIM BLUFF YOU TONIGHT.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'VE BEEN TO THAT
[2:21:49] ALTAR TWICE AND I HAVEN'T STILL GOT WHAT
[2:21:52] I NEED." I COME TO THIS ALTAR TONIGHT. I
[2:21:54] PRESS MY THROUGH WAY THROUGH. I SAY,
[2:21:57] "GOD, I'M HERE. I NEED YOU. I NEED THAT
[2:22:00] ETERNAL PART OF MY HEART.
[2:22:18] Brother Ron, you seem like you're bold
[2:22:20] tonight. I FEEL SOMETHING HERE.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't DO THIS UNLESS I FELT
[2:22:26] SOMETHING.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, I've came to camp
[2:22:33] after camp and I go back the same way.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of that kind of experience.
[2:22:42] My mom and dad, THEY'RE THIS WAY AND
[2:22:44] THAT way
[2:22:45] and I struggle. I WANT YOU TO COME
[2:22:48] TONIGHT.
[2:22:49] SOMEBODY'S GOING TO OVERCOME. LET IT BE
[2:22:52] YOU.
[2:23:02] There won't be services like this
[2:23:04] always.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; This meeting is slipping away already.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; ONE MORNING BETWEEN 6 AND 9, WE WISH
[2:23:13] WE'D HAVE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; It's like standing AT AN AUCTION WANTING
[2:23:20] TO BUY A PIECE OF PRODUCT.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BUY IT AFTER THAT PRODUCT IS
[2:23:24] GONE. ONE DAY OUR VOICES WON'T SOUND NO
[2:23:27] MORE.
[2:23:31] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "OH, HOW WE NEED
[2:23:32] IN JEFFERSONVILLE TONIGHT. THOUSANDS OF
[2:23:36] LIVED VOICES.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; MOM AND DAD, YOU FELT COLD AND
[2:23:40] INDIFFERENT WITH GOD. I COME TONIGHT.
[2:24:07] Would there be another one tonight?
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Would you be another one tonight?
[2:24:29] I KEEP GOING AROUND MOUNT HORB AND
[2:24:31] AROUND MOUNT Horab and around Mount
[2:24:33] Horb. I KEEP GOING AROUND A CIRCLE. I
[2:24:36] KEEP GOING IN A CIRCLE. I JUST KEEP
[2:24:38] GOING IN A CIRCLE.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Won't you let God come to your heart
[2:24:47] tonight?
[2:25:06] These services won't always go on.
[2:25:10] While you waiting, Brother Ron, he's
[2:25:12] still calling.
[2:25:21] I'm burdened for you.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; I'm burdened for you.

[2:25:31] their hearts.
[2:25:46] rich young ruler
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; stood
[2:25:57] in a service just like this.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; I've been trying to stay away from that,
[2:26:04] but I can't. Let me just stop here.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; He stood in a service just like this.
[2:26:12] Hallelujah.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Just like this.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; And Jesus loved him.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't HE COULDN'T GIVE THAT
[2:26:24] WHICH WAS SO CLOSE TO HIM AWAY.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; He would LIKE TO TAKE YOUR PLACE
[2:26:31] TONIGHT.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SCREAM FROM OUT
[2:26:36] OF THE SAND TONIGHT.
[2:26:40] HE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOUR PLACE
[2:26:42] TONIGHT.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; He may never deal like he's dealing
[2:27:05] tonight.
[2:27:07] Brother Ron, I want to hear something
[2:27:08] deep. This is pretty deep.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; That God would TAKE TIME IN A SERVICE
[2:27:13] LIKE THIS.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD GATHER THIS MANY HUNDREDS AND
[2:27:18] THOUSANDS TOGETHER TO WAIT ON YOU.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; He's waiting on you tonight.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; HE'S WAITING ON YOU TONIGHT.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK THE TIME. HE TOOK THE TIME. HE
[2:27:35] TOOK THE TIME TO ALLOW THAT CROSS TO
[2:27:37] BEAT ON THAT ROCKY GROUND AND HE KEPT
[2:27:41] HIS EYES TOWARD CALVARY. WHO FAR BROTHER
[2:27:44] ME? WHO FAR FOR YOU?
[2:27:50] MOMS AND DADS, I'M CALLING TO YOU
[2:27:52] TONIGHT. REBUILD YOUR ALTAR.

[2:28:11] tonight

[2:28:59] The last couple of nights I FELT LED TO
[2:29:01] LEAVE THE PLATFORM,
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; but something's holding me here tonight.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; ONE DAY HE'LL TAKE US FROM THE EARTH.
[2:29:16] YES, SIR.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; OUR ENERGIES ARE RUN OUT.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; OUR VOICES WILL ONLY BE HEARD IN THE
[2:29:24] ETERNITIES.
[2:29:27] TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TONIGHT.

[2:30:19] MAY YOU BREAK THE CHAINS TONIGHT.
[2:30:23] May you break the chains tonight.
[2:30:29] May you break THE CHAINS TONIGHT OF SIN.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; MAY YOU BREAK COMPLEXES.
[2:30:38] MAY YOU BREAK THE FEARS.
[2:30:43] WE BIND THE ENEMY OF HELL tonight
[2:30:46] in THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
[2:30:51] And whom THE SON HAS SET FREE IS FREE.
[2:31:00] That's free and gave.
[2:31:02] WE PROCLAIM OUR FREEDOM TONIGHT.
[2:31:12] This is THE SOUNDING OF OUR JUBILEE
[2:31:14] TONIGHT. THE TRUMPET HAS SOUNDED. THE
[2:31:18] VOICE HAS CRIED OUT.
[2:31:23] SATAN, YOU'RE NOT OUR SLAVE MASTER NO
[2:31:25] MORE. WE'RE FREE. WE'RE FREE. IN THE
[2:31:30] NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, WE GO BACK TO OUR
[2:31:33] POSSESSIONS. WE GO BACK TO OUR HOMELAND
[2:31:36] TONIGHT.
[2:31:38] WE'RE FREE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
[2:31:58] LET HIM BREAK THE CHAINS FOR YOU
[2:31:59] TONIGHT.
[2:32:01] LET HIM BREAK THE CHAINS AND SHAKE AWAY
[2:32:03] FROM THEM TONIGHT. DON'T NEVER PUT THEM
[2:32:06] BACK ON AGAIN. SHAKE THOSE CHAINS OF
[2:32:09] FAMILY TIES. SHAKE THOSE CHAINS OF THE
[2:32:11] ENEMY. SHAKE THE CHAINS OF SICKNESS
[2:32:14] TONIGHT IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
[2:32:17] IT'S YOUR TURN.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:32:28] We're free. We're free. We're free.
[2:32:32] We're free. We're free. We're free.

[2:32:41] IS SET FREE, WE'RE FREE.
[2:32:54] AND I REFUSE TO GO BACK INTO THOSE
[2:32:56] CHAINS ANYMORE. I'M NOT UNDER SLAVERY NO
[2:33:00] MORE.
[2:33:01] I'M FREE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. I
[2:33:05] PROCLAIM VICTORY.
[2:33:07] VICTORY.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; Won't you just rejoice?
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR TURN NOW.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR TURN NOW.
[2:33:29] Let the spirit of Christ strike me out
[2:33:31] of you. Hallelujah. You are worthy. Oh

[2:33:39] God just turnless.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; Don't stop now, saints. Amen.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is still moving.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; He's still here.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU FEEL THOSE CHAINS FALLING
[2:34:03] DOWN?
[2:34:04] AMEN.
[2:34:06] WHAT'S HAPPENING?
[2:34:08] YOU WERE ONCE BOUND, NOW YOU'RE FREE.
[2:34:13] AND IF YOU'RE FREE, SAINTS OF GOD,
[2:34:15] THERE'S SOMETHING WITHIN YOU THAT WANTS
[2:34:17] TO REJOICE.
[2:34:21] THE ANGELS ARE REJOICING. WE MIGHT AS
[2:34:24] WELL REJOICE. AND IF WE DON'T REJOICE,
[2:34:27] THE ROCKS WILL CRY OUT, BUT WE WANT
[2:34:30] LIVING STONES TO WORSHIP A LIVING GOD.
[2:34:37] HALLELUJAH.
[2:34:40] HALLELUJAH.
[2:34:42] That's what we've been needing, SAINTS
[2:34:43] OF GOD. THROW OUT THAT OLD FORMAL
[2:34:46] STARCHY NATURE.
[2:34:48] AMEN. THIS IS A TIME TO WORSHIP.
[2:34:54] WHAT HAVE WE BEEN SEEING? WE'VE BEEN
[2:34:55] SEEING OUR CHILDREN LOOSED BY THE WORD.
[2:35:03] I DON'T KNOW IF THAT DOESN'T THRILL YOU,
[2:35:05] BUT IT SURE THRILLS MY SOUL.
[2:35:12] IF YOUR IF THE PARENTS ONLY KNEW WHO WAS
[2:35:15] UP HERE, YOU'D BE REJOICING BECAUSE I
[2:35:17] KNOW ANGELS ARE REJOICING.
[2:35:26] HALLELUJAH.
[2:35:28] GLORY. THE CHILDREN OF THE LORD HAVE A
[2:35:32] RIGHT TO SHOUT AND SINGLE.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; FOR THE WAY IS GOING BRIGHT AND OUR
[2:35:38] SOULS ARE ON THE WINGS.
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:35:49] WORTHY, Sister Linda. Worthy. Worthy the
[2:35:52] lamb that was slain. You can boost this
[2:35:54] up a bit, John. I'm not hearing myself
[2:35:56] at all. Worthy.
[2:35:59] Why don't you worship him now? Oh,
[2:36:02] worthy.
[2:36:07] worthy
[2:36:09] the lamb.
[2:36:12] Oh, he's so worthy tonight, saints. Oh,
[2:36:16] worthy,
[2:36:21] worthy,
[2:36:26] worthy.
[2:36:28] The lamb
[2:36:30] that was slain. Let's sing the verses
[2:36:33] now.
[2:36:35] Hear the cry
[2:36:38] of sack.
[2:36:40] From the onset
[2:36:42] of time,
[2:36:45] the chain
[2:36:47] of defeat. There's no key. Think about
[2:36:52] it, saints, and see the tears
[2:36:56] of the broken,
[2:36:59] the cry
[2:37:01] of the slave.
[2:37:03] Is there no one
[2:37:06] worthy to set us free?
[2:37:11] GLORY.
[2:37:13] The tr
[2:37:15] is still
[2:37:17] as the chlor. LET IT RING OUT, SAINTS.
[2:37:24] You're free.
[2:37:29] Hallelujah.
[2:37:32] Thousands
[2:37:34] of voices
[2:37:36] are swelling
[2:37:39] the song.
[2:37:41] Singing worthy. Is he worthy?
[2:37:45] OH, HE'S SO WORTHY TONIGHT. Worship him.
[2:37:51] Worthy.
[2:38:00] Worthy
[2:38:02] the lamb
[2:38:05] that was slain.
[2:38:10] Worthy,
[2:38:15] worthy,
[2:38:20] worthy.
[2:38:21] The lamb
[2:38:24] that was slain. Let's sing that first
[2:38:26] verse again.
[2:38:28] Hear the cry. Oh, I love this.
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; From the onset
[2:38:36] of
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; for the change.
[2:38:45] Think about it.
[2:38:48] The tears
[2:38:50] of the broken
[2:39:01] to
[2:39:03] hallelujah. Then the crying is still.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. The shackles
[2:39:19] released from their chain
[2:39:25] AND THOUSANDS. LET YOUR VOICE RING OUT.
[2:39:29] THEY'RE SWELLING THE SONG.
[2:39:35] Worthy
[2:39:37] the lamb that was slain.
[2:39:43] WHY DON'T YOU WORSHIP HIM NOW? WORTHY,
[2:39:45] LORD. YOU'RE WORTHY, LORD. YOU'RE
[2:39:49] WORTHY, OH GOD.
[2:39:51] HALLELUJAH.
[2:39:54] WORTHY.
[2:39:56] The lamb that was slain.
[2:40:04] Hallelujah.
[2:40:06] Worthy. Worthy.
[2:40:08] So worthy.
[2:40:13] worthy
[2:40:15] the lamb
[2:40:18] that was slain.
[2:40:21] Hallelujah.
[2:40:24] Just praise him in your own way. If you
[2:40:27] want to shut your eyes, you want to lift
[2:40:29] your hands, you want to speak it out, if
[2:40:32] you want to take some time right now,
[2:40:34] you want to tell him how much you love
[2:40:35] him, how thankful we are for the moving
[2:40:38] of God. Amen. From the parents to the
[2:40:42] grandparents to the elders to the
[2:40:44] youngers,
[2:40:46] we've got something to be thankful for.
[2:40:51] Hallelujah.
[2:40:53] What a mighty God we serve.
[2:40:56] What a mighty God we serve.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; ANGELS BOW BEFORE HIM. HEAVEN AND EARTH
[2:41:02] ADORES HIM.
[2:41:06] HE'S A MIGHTY God
[2:41:09] and he's MIGHTY IN BATTLE
[2:41:12] AND HE'S NEVER LOST A BATTLE YET.
[2:41:24] YOU CAN SAY THAT'S NOT JUST YOUR GOD,
[2:41:27] BUT THAT'S MY GOD.
[2:41:35] MY CHILDREN,
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; MY WIFE,
[2:41:38] &gt;&gt; MY FATHER,
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; MY MOTHER.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; HE'S MY GOD.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; GLORY,
[2:41:55] GLORY,
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; GLORY,
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let the hallelujah roll. LET US
[2:42:04] SING OUR PRAISES. SAVE SAVIOR'S PRAISES
[2:42:07] FAR AND WIDE.
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; WHY? Because we're living on the
[2:42:11] Hallelujah side.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; As I said to the YOUNG PEOPLE, THE
[2:42:17] DEVIL'S BEAT US UP LONG ENOUGH.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; HE'S BEAT US UP LONG ENOUGH. NOW IT'S
[2:42:22] OUR TIME.
[2:42:26] It's your time.
[2:42:31] THE hour has come.
[2:42:34] THE HOUR HAS COME.
[2:42:36] THE HOUR HAS COME. AND NOW IS GLORIFY
[2:42:41] THY SON.
[2:42:47] GLORY. WE FEEL A CHARGE.
[2:42:54] This is what IT'S ALL ABOUT, SAINTS OF
[2:42:55] GOD. JESUS KNEW WHO HE WAS AND WE KNOW
[2:42:58] WHO WE ARE.
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S NO LONGER A SONG, BUT IT'S A SONG
[2:43:03] IN FLESH. IT'S THE WORD IN FLESH.
[2:43:11] &gt;&gt; This is camp, right?
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; This is camp time.
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; This you have the LIBERTY TO SLIP OUT
[2:43:18] ANYTIME YOU WANT IF YOU CAN.
[2:43:23] But I believe the magnet is moving.
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THE MAGNET IS TAKING PLACE
[2:43:30] OVER THIS CAMP.
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; AND THOSE THAT CAN BE MAGNETIZED, AMEN.
[2:43:34] ARE BEING DRAWN TO THE GREAT MAGNETS.
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; GLORY. You get a guy preaching.
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when the spirit of God falls,
[2:43:51] saints of God, we want to move. When the
[2:43:53] spirit of God moves,
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; we do.
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; When that angel troubled the water, it
[2:43:58] was the first one in. I want you to know
[2:44:00] if I lived that time, you'd have to be
[2:44:02] behind me.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; Or we'd all be diving in at one time. I
[2:44:09] say, "LET'S ALL DIVE IN AT ONE TIME."
[2:44:15] AMEN. THAT WE CAN ALL GET THAT HEALING.
[2:44:18] FOR THE SON OF RIGHTEOUSNESS HAS ARISEN
[2:44:21] WITH HEALING IN his
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; What an hour, what a time, what a season
[2:44:36] it's in. That rapture cycle has taken
[2:44:39] place. Amen. And I feel that new body
[2:44:42] materializing around me. I don't know
[2:44:44] about you, SAINTS OF GOD, BUT I'VE BEEN
[2:44:46] IN A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE for the last
[2:44:48] few months. I'M GOING TO GET CARRIED
[2:44:50] AWAY WHEN I GET CARRIED AWAY.
[2:45:00] You say, "Oh, this is just nothing but
[2:45:02] hypen all." You know, you're just
[2:45:04] jealous.
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; You know, YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS. JUST GET
[2:45:09] THAT JEALOUS SPIRIT OUT OF HERE.
[2:45:12] AMEN.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; HUH?
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I had to break it a few years
[2:45:21] ago myself. I was a bunch of headnters
[2:45:24] myself. Uh-huh. But all of a sudden,
[2:45:27] when I saw somebody else get in a honey
[2:45:29] bucket, I said, "I want that honey
[2:45:31] bucket also."
[2:45:36] PUT MY HAND IN THAT HONEY BUCKET AND I
[2:45:38] WON'T LET GO. I WON'T LET GO. THIS IS
[2:45:41] HONEY IN THE ROCK, MY BROTHER.
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; Victory is mine. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.
[2:45:51] HOW ABOUT YOU HERE TONIGHT? Victory is
[2:45:53] yours.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; WE MIGHT AS WELL SPEAK IT.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; WE MIGHT AS WELL CONFESS IT.
[2:46:12] Victory is mine.
[2:46:15] Victory is mine.
[2:46:18] Victory
[2:46:20] is mine.
[2:46:23] Oh, I told him.
[2:46:29] Oh, victory today.
[2:46:32] WHEN I WALK THIS MORNING,
[2:46:35] when I walk this morning,
[2:46:37] I got
[2:46:40] I got the Lord
[2:46:44] SAY THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING. DOWN. YES,
[2:46:47] SIR.
[2:46:51] I'm singing shouting every
[2:46:58] mine.
[2:46:59] Victory is mine.
[2:47:02] Victory
[2:47:04] is mine.
[2:47:07] Oh, I choose WHERE
[2:47:13] victory today is first.
[2:47:21] Joy is mine.
[2:47:33] WHY?
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; WE MIGHT AS WELL BE HAPPY. HAPPINESS.
[2:47:40] Happiness is mine.
[2:47:43] Happiness is mine.
[2:47:45] Happiness.
[2:47:52] GLORY.
[2:47:59] WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING, when I woke
[2:48:02] this
[2:48:11] to get Anna, hour and a half to get
[2:48:13] back. You saints are doing that all the
[2:48:15] time in the American folks. I think we
[2:48:18] just need to pray a special blessing
[2:48:21] upon all the saints that live around
[2:48:23] that 49th parallel. They've endured for
[2:48:25] many years to make the church what it is
[2:48:27] today. And I say, God bless the saints
[2:48:31] that live on the south side.
[2:48:43] I am humbled every time I'm in your
[2:48:46] homes. We sit at your table. We break
[2:48:49] bread. I'm humbled every time because I
[2:48:53] see you have a love for the word. You
[2:48:56] endure those borders. You have children.
[2:48:59] I know what it is to have babies in in
[2:49:01] car seats crying. Mommy's stressed out.
[2:49:05] I know what it is. But I want you to
[2:49:07] say, I know one thing and say it's worth
[2:49:09] it all.
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; It is worth every minute of it because
[2:49:14] here they are tonight. Here they are
[2:49:16] standing by the grace of God.
[2:49:21] So we are going to close
[2:49:23] be prompt tomorrow morning 10:30 the
[2:49:26] service starts. It'll be our last
[2:49:28] service. We are going to need at least
[2:49:30] 20 brothers. We asked for 20 I think to
[2:49:33] put up the 10, was it? And we got 60.
[2:49:37] That's my kind of mathematics.
[2:49:42] But we're going to need 20.
[2:49:45] You know, it's all fine and dandy now.
[2:49:47] We've enjoyed all this, but it's not
[2:49:49] over
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; till it's all packed away.
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; And many hands, mate, like work.
[2:49:55] &gt;&gt; So, we need 20 brothers after the
[2:49:57] service. However you arrange it with
[2:49:59] your wives, if you're single, that's
[2:50:01] even better. Let the brothers that got
[2:50:03] wives and children, not that that is
[2:50:05] better, but got wives and children, they
[2:50:08] can get away and you've got the time. Be
[2:50:10] willing to help the brothers pull down
[2:50:13] the tent, pull the wires, get the chairs
[2:50:15] ready. Could you do that? And then we'll
[2:50:17] need eight brothers then to unload the
[2:50:19] tent where it's being stored. And that
[2:50:23] would be wonderful. campers, if you
[2:50:26] wouldn't mind, immediately
[2:50:28] uh after you've greeted, just shooken
[2:50:30] hands, please go immediately to the
[2:50:32] dining hall. We have a little meeting in
[2:50:34] there we'd like to have. And those that
[2:50:36] have visited us tonight, God bless you
[2:50:38] again. Make your way off the grounds as
[2:50:40] quickly as possible. Of course, greet
[2:50:43] one another, but just make your way. And
[2:50:45] that would help us out a lot. So, let's
[2:50:49] just pray, have a word of prayer.
[2:50:50] Father,
[2:50:53] we've enjoyed the ministry of the word
[2:50:55] of God.
[2:50:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, to see lives touched by the word
[2:51:00] thrills my soul. I'm sure it thrills
[2:51:03] everyone that's standing here. Lord,
[2:51:06] Satan has fought service after service,
[2:51:09] and we've had some tremendous encounters
[2:51:12] with God. Lord, you've been so faithful.
[2:51:15] And yet tonight, Lord, YOU'VE COME AGAIN
[2:51:17] AND MOVED UPON US AND YOU SWEPT UPON OUR
[2:51:20] YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU SWEPT UPON PARENTS.
[2:51:22] LORD, I SAY TO GOD BE THE GLORY. GREAT
[2:51:25] THINGS HE has done. We thank you for
[2:51:28] this time. We pray, Father, that
[2:51:30] tomorrow morning that it will be the
[2:51:32] capstone message that you'd come down in
[2:51:35] a supernatural way. There was 120 in the
[2:51:38] upper room. There's a lot MORE HERE
[2:51:40] TONIGHT. LET THE HOLY GHOST fall
[2:51:45] &gt;&gt; and Father move us
[2:51:47] into channels and depths we have not
[2:51:49] even tasted. We pray watch everyone on
[2:51:52] the road Lord. Just
[2:51:55] help the mothers with their babies.
[2:51:59] Lord, long services, but these are
[2:52:02] blessed times. Watch over our children
[2:52:04] and the daddies as they drive home. And
[2:52:07] Lord, if we shall return, if you should
[2:52:09] give us a Sunday morning, bless the
[2:52:10] meeting. Strengthen our dear brother
[2:52:12] Ron, Lord. Weary, weak, he's poured out,
[2:52:15] Lord. And he's poured out. And he's
[2:52:17] poured out. We believe it was
[2:52:19] supernatural even for him to be speaking
[2:52:21] yet THIS EVENING. LORD, LET THE ANGEL
[2:52:23] COME BY HIS WAY. STRENGTHEN HIM LIKE
[2:52:26] ELIJAH WAS STRENGTHENED. LORD, MAY HE
[2:52:28] WAKE UP REFRESHED IN THE MORNING. MAY HE
[2:52:31] BE RENEWED. THE SAME ONE, LORD, THAT HAS
[2:52:34] TOUCHED HIM, TOUCH HIM AGAIN.
[2:52:37] We've appreciated his ministry, his
[2:52:40] life. We just pray you'll use him again
[2:52:42] in Jesus name.
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God be with you.
[2:52:48] And young people, if you could make it
[2:52:50] towards to the kitchen, that would be
[2:52:51] great. God bless you all. You're Smith
[2:52:53] in Jesus name.
[2:53:22] Don't worry.
[2:53:26] Heat. Heat.
