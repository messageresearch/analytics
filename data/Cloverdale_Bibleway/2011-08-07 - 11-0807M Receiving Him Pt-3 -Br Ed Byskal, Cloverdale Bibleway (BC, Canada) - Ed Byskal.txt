We're excited for camp. I brother talked to again, brother Aaron, he is so looking forward to being with the young people. I talked to him last night and he's just making all the arrangements. Everything's in order. He said, "Brother Tom, how are the young people?" I said, "They're doing fine." And he said, "I'm just looking forward to being able to minister and be a part of the young people once again." And brother Danny Steam will be flying in with their family on Wednesday. So, we're looking for a wonderful time in God's presence. God bless you all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't we invite our pastor Biscll to come? And as we as he does, why don't we sing number 1148?

We're so thankful for everyone that is here to fellowship and worship this morning. Some saints from Seattle, Tacoma area, I believe, have come registering the children tomorrow. We're looking for a not only a great time but a mighty time during camp and that it the effect of it will continue on. Amen. God bless you all. So nice to have our brother Steven and sister Lillian Meyers with us right here in the front sitting beside brother Karen. Sister Karen and brother Doug. You like to just raise your hand if you would. These are these are some that are streaming all the time. So they with DVD or however they get it, but they get it. Amen. I just got an email just a little bit of time ago from Durban, South Africa. And while they were while they were listening to a service, I had a very supernatural experience. They said it's left them very very much affected. So, I just want you to know that it's what uh what people expect. Let's be in great expectation today. We don't want to leave it. We don't have any guarantee about tomorrow or this evening. Nice to see Brother Gary, Sister Lisa back. God bless you. Also, Brother Joseph and Sister Anita, nice to see you back. Amen. Praise the Lord. We miss you. You may think, we don't miss you. Thank you, brother Kyle, for the prayer meeting report. I'd love to have been there. I said there was 65 to 75 people and just pack the chapel right out. Well, I hope they pack it out and move on into the fellowship room. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh, Brother Timothy Anatoo is back with us. He He He's like the wind. I don't hear he's coming and then I just hear he's here. Nice to have you, brother Timothy. And I know your family's happy. We can't welcome everyone. I just met Brother Abel from Mexico arrived. Well, we welcome everyone. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We also welcomed three more children into into the world. Uh Sharon gave birth to triplets and they're healthy and mother and children are well and we're happy for that. They were all over four pounds. I don't get too precise because I just don't get too much into it, but they're here. And uh so I said God must have some plan. Uh this is the last thing in the world that I ever expected I had experienced. And someone sent a greetings to my wife and I and said it must be quite a a feeling to be a greatgrandparents three times in one day. And I sent it back and said, "How about three times in one minute?" So, we're we're delighted and and we just uh are thankful. We I want them to be a a credit to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen. Maybe we could just sing this again and then we'll go right to the word. I lift your handy Hey, [Music] [Music] my comfort and heavenly king. Go in prayer. Dear father, how we thank you for this day, the Lord's day. And we want indeed it to be the Lord's day. We pray that you'll receive all the glory, all the praise, for you alone are worthy. Take your word now, oh God, and I pray you'll divide it and break it down to the people. And may they and may we all be so attentive and listening to the voice of the spirit. Speak to us, oh bridegroom, husband, Lord Jesus. I pray, Father, you'll take this congregation and bring them into one mind. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Remove every hindrance. &gt;&gt; Remove every enemy that would try to sew a thought, oh God, and purge us and cleanse us, oh Father, that we might stand in the holy presence of the Almighty God. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Open your word now. We pray for you are the author. We thank you Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. I'd ask you to open your Bibles to Matthew the 21st chapter. I would like your undivided attention and as little movement as possible in the congregation. Uh, I have something that I want to I'm going to be speaking part three on receiving him, but I the the title really doesn't do justice to the thought that I'm been seeking to convey to you. And we've taken two services or three. And now I want to I want to bring something to you that I think is uh really critical to the body of Jesus Christ to the bride of Jesus Christ and and it's uh more or less towards the teaching side rather than the preaching side which is brother Bram talks about teachings being quite treacherous and uh because sometimes you have to uh say something and then you almost overcompensate to get people up, you know, to this point. And so then, but people are quick in their mind. They catch the over compensated statement, say, "Wow, you know, it's way over there." And and almost go off on a on a limb, but and I don't want that to happen either. So, that's kind of what I'm a little bit cautious about. But uh you pray for me &gt;&gt; and pray also God will just give you clear understanding the purpose of the service this service and the previous services the reason why I say I believe it's critical is for this reason the I believe that there's an element within the message that I'm going to seek to move to and that is that if we really realized who's amongst us if we really realized that God the creator of heavens and earth has come and in a form and has brought as has come down in such a way so that he can indwell us and that this ministry which we have received we've been birthed under this ministry of the seventh angel the seventh messenger and and I know that we agree and we accept accept it and we believe it in in our hearts. I I I don't want to be like some that Brother Brandham said they're they're trying so hard to believe. I don't want to be trying to believe. I want to be believing. &gt;&gt; I just want to have and have you to have simple childlike faith. Just believe it and and give yourself to it completely because we we're not here, friends, just to get through this Sunday and go into camp or whatever more. We might not even have camp. We could pass uh we could pass beyond this realm &gt;&gt; into eternal shore in a moment's notice and uh individually or collectively. So we just want to uh I want to try to bring this subject to you because I believe it is the key to receiving supernatural things. And I believe that often supernatural things were not taking place and do not take place because people do not respect and give honor to the one who's amongst us who's none other than Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And so God help us as we read. Now I'm going to start Matthew 21 and starting with verse 33 here. Another parable. There was a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedged it around about and digged a wine press in it and built a tower and led it out to husbandmen and went into a for country. And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen and that they might receive the fruits of it. And the husbandman took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another. Again, he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did unto them likewise. But last of all, he sent unto them his son, saying, "This will reverence my son." But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said unto they said among themselves, "This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance." And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. And when the Lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? They say unto him, he will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other hus under husbandmen, which shall render unto him the fruits in their seasons. Jesus sth unto them, did you never read in the scriptures, the stone which the builders re rejected, the same has become the head of the corner? This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes. Therefore say I unto you, the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard the the his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. And when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude because they took him for a prophet down to verse 46. I want also and you could turn please to John the 8th chapter. I want to read verse 24 and then I will go to John 9 and read nine and John 13 and read verse 19. John 8 and 24. I said therefore unto you that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins. I'd like you to notice that strange phrase. If you uh if you believe not that I am he, it's like speaking of two individuals that I who you see I whoever you regard me to be am he. whoever that was, whoever they thought that was a and and whoever they were taught that that was if you don't believe that I am he. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's it's it's a bit of a relative statement. And then in John 9 and9 he said some said this is he others said he is like him. But he said I am he. That pretty well covers the crowd. &gt;&gt; This is he. &gt;&gt; Others said, "No, he's like him." But he said, "I am he." &gt;&gt; In John 13:19, he said, "Now I tell you before it come that when it is come to pass, you may believe that I am he." I'll read it again. Some of you still finding it. Now I tell you before it come to pass uh I tell you before it come that when it come to pass you may believe that I am he. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats. The scripture which we read, the scripture reading said, "But last of all he sent his son." Last of all, he sent his beloved. And they were looking upon him. So, you'll just have to be labor. You'll allow me to belabor this point for a while. They were looking on him and they said, "Uh, this is Joseph's son." Which he wasn't Joseph's son, but they thought he was Joseph's son. This is Joseph and Mary's son. But but he was saying, "Whoever you think I if you think I'm Joseph's son or Mary's son or or an illegitimate child or whatever you think I am, but I am he. And if you don't believe that I am he, you're going to die in your unbelief or die in your sins. &gt;&gt; That was that was the powerful point that he was making. And at the and last of all, after all of these servants, after all of the prophets and the seers and the sages of the Old Testament, and then finally the spirit of Elijah coming again, and John the Baptist preaching with such, I won't even say vigor, but such power of the Holy Spirit and people being drawn to it. And then he said, "But there is one among you." And uh I'm not worthy to do his shoe latch and and he I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and power. Now, it it hadn't happened in Holy Ghost and fire. It hadn't happened with others of the uh others of the servants where they got confused. So they asked him if he was Christ. Some of these things you've heard me say perhaps a number of times. They asked him if he was Christ. Never heard. It's never written that they asked Elijah if he was or rather Isaiah if he was Christ or Ezekiel if he was Christ or Jeremiah if he was Christ. And here come John the Baptist. Not really considered as one of the major prophets. But are you Christ? There's something about that spirit of Elijah that and the reason why there's something about it is because God has chosen that spirit as a forerunning spirit &gt;&gt; and a restoring spirit. &gt;&gt; And then when Jesus came on the scene, then they wanted to know if he was John the Baptist. John the Baptist is raised up. Always getting those two confused. And then last of all, after seven church ages, after seven church ages comes the last messenger. There's not another one. &gt;&gt; There is not another one. I've got some quotes I'm going to have you read with me very slowly. And last of all, he sent his son. Now I have a I have a slide here that I want to uh and before I put the slide up, I'm interested in the I'm interested in the construction of the message. I'm interested in how God ordered it. I think that's important. We as children, we expect to have, you know, more serious conversation as we get older, more responsibility and and uh experience uh more things uh within the family and uh and as as the as the message matured and not the message so much maturing, but as the bride of Jesus Christ, you know, we talk about the earlier messages and the evangelistic tapes and so on and so forth. But then and there were such multitudes that came at that time. But then as the ministry begin to get down to what we call the opening of the word, the the crowds were much smaller. You don't hear of two and three and 400,000 people. You know, it's a few hundred people. And some of the messages which you hear and even treasure were in a house where maybe there was 30 people or 40 people. But the but the message that came out of there was absolutely profound. &gt;&gt; And so in the in 33 years of ministry uh I wanted to find out when brother Brandham began to refer to Revelation 107. And if I type that in and do a search on it, uh I find that he used it 18 times and that was in the last three years. So for perhaps 30 years it's not referred to but in the last 3 years it becomes referred to and the first time that I can find it is in sers is this the time and that's the first time that I find him referring to and he says now listen close the seventh angel of revelation 10:7 is the seventh church age messenger &gt;&gt; now I know that &gt;&gt; these appear in the church ages and that the church ages were being uh grammarized and put together into into the book that we know as the church ages over a period of time and and the prophet spoke the revelation of the the revelation of the uh church ages the revelation of Jesus Christ series and that is back from 19 about 6061 in there I believe and he's speaking that at that time but then when it is put together in a book which doesn't come out till 1965. In fact, it's about the 8th month of 1965. The book is released and brother uh brother Lee Vale had done a tremendous amount of work on it and it was done. Brother Brandon speaks very highly of the book. Some discredit it. I do not. I think that it covers the major messages, the major doctrines of the message in a very very appropriate way. And it's a wonderful way that the at least the message is introduced. &gt;&gt; And he says in the seventh angel of revelation 10:7 is a seventh church age messenger. Then in the fourth seal we find out that that eagle age was promised in Revelations 10:7. And in Malachi 1:4 uh that would be in the last days that it would be here. also in the fourth seal. He said, "We could we could uh uh we could just give you scripture after scripture that the last age is a prophetic message to the church calling them back to the original word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have to have 10 messengers doing that. &gt;&gt; This messenger was ordained and vindicated of God. &gt;&gt; No one had that kind of vindication. And it's the vindication which separates it from everything else. &gt;&gt; I don't have that vindication. No other minister I know of in the message, there hasn't been anybody before him and nobody since him that's had that. And when I say before him, I'm going all the way back. As far as I'm concerned, I don't find anything from Adam forward that had the Lord Jesus Christ. You say, "What about the Lord Jesus Christ?" The Lord Jesus Christ in his in his very localized area uh in uh in in Palestine did all of those things. But then he did say greater than this. And the prophet said you couldn't do greater. He raised the dead, brought life back. Couldn't do greater but greater in numbers, greater in quantity because he knew that at the end time. And so Malachi 4 said so and others. And he says Revelation 10 and 7. He goes on, perhaps some are here and are younger ones. Listen close. He said, "The first Elijah was him." In other words, Elijah. The first one was him, Elijah the Tishbite. The first Elijah was him. The second was Elisha. The third was John. The fourth was the seventh angel to the last messenger uh the angel or the last messenger to the church according to Malachi 4. That was the fourth. In Revelations 10:7, the fifth time he is a messenger to the Jews, to the 144,000, to the Jews after the church is gone. &gt;&gt; So those are the five times. There isn't another one. &gt;&gt; There isn't anything that has to rise to be something of a extraordinary measure. &gt;&gt; There's no personal. We're not going to get into personality cults. That's what Pentecost died on &gt;&gt; was this great minister and that great minister and some other great minister. This message is the one that has been sent to call us. &gt;&gt; And the souls that are in prison now we're into 63. It was to be the seventh angel's message that was to reveal the seven seals. Revelation 10:7. So the seventh angel's message was to reveal the seven seals. There isn't anyone else coming to reveal them. That messenger was sent to reveal them. &gt;&gt; We may read it. We may hear it. We may listen to the tapes or whatever more and may not catch the revelation of it, but it's been opened according to the promise of God. &gt;&gt; And uh and he saw this angel come down. Oh, now watch this closely. And he saw this angel come down, put his foot on the land and on the sea. He said that was Christ had a rainbow over his head. &gt;&gt; In works his faith expressed the works that the Holy Spirit is doing today by these visions never failing. Promises never failing. All the apostolic signs promised in the Bible of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7. All of that is being fulfilled and proved by the scientific and every other way in the rapture. And these seven seals was not to be opened. Revelation 10 until the sounding of the last earthly angel on earth. Revelation 10:7. And in the days of the sounding of the last angel's message, seventh angel, the mystery of God should be finished. And that was the age that we're living in. We all know we're living in the Leodysia age and that and there will never be an another age to it. It can't be. &gt;&gt; Continuing in rapture. I wasn't planning on this, but it sounds like you're catching enjoying it. Now, here also a type of the seven church ages, which is Revelation 10:7. that the great mystery of the book was to be unfolded by the seventh angel's message. &gt;&gt; That book's unfolded by the seventh angel's message. &gt;&gt; Not an eighth or seven and a half or somebody else. By the seventh angel's message, it'll be unfolded &gt;&gt; in modern events made clear. Now coming to the last services, the very last services to see Jesus himself there in the skies looking down. And that's the cloud, &gt;&gt; the the testimony, the testament, the evidence that the seals were to be opened to see Jesus himself there in the skies looking down and saying that in the in the Revelations 10:7 in the seventh angel's message, these seals would be opened and the mysteries of God would be made known. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then a number of times in the Pergamanian church age and the Leodysian church age and so on. Uh quite a number uh a few more times. Then I also wanted to see the references made to Revelation 10:1 which was the which we know is Christ which he has said clearly as Christ and he said, "Oh, it's a great plan." And this is the first sale. It was in less than 3 years in about 2 years and 8 months that he made the reference to Revelation 10:1 and not before that. Why? It wasn't for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't for them. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't have received it. They wouldn't have believed it. &gt;&gt; They wanted signs and healings and all kinds of things. And not that those are gone. that that God can never stop being a healer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there are people today that want to revert right back and say, "Well, we, you know, this is a the gifts are coming in. Gifts are coming in." I saw people backslide under that. I saw people with all kinds of gifts and prophecies and interpretations and tongues and healings and supernatural things happening, but when the word came, they refused it. So, and and and he's he he only refers to that I can find and I'm not saying this is that's why I'm being very careful. Revelation 10 and1 five times in about 2 years and 8 months and that's the last two years and 8 months. Now that might not mean anything to you but it means a whole lot to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say now you know uh I'm just thinking of a a young man I knew he wanted me to adopt him actually. He wanted to come here and live and and uh his father was uh very very unusual man in in South Africa and down in the Cape Town area. And uh I don't know why this comes to my mind right now, but uh his this boy's father had a little building at the at the back of the lot to their place and no one was allowed in that building. That's where he went and prayed and talked to God. And one day he said to his son, he said, "Now I want you to come with me." and he took him into that prayer chamber and sat him down. He said, "Now, son," he said, "you're 16 and uh here." And he reached he said, "Here's the keys to the car and I want you to take care of mommy." He said, "Well, this language he hadn't heard before." What? What do you mean take care of mommy? He said, 'Well, now you're a man. You're not a You're not just a boy anymore. You're a man, and you have to take man's responsibilities. What? What? What's happening? Where are you going? He said, "No, it's fine. Daddy's going to be leaving, but I want you to take and he he took a box. And he said, "Here's all the payments of the car, and there's only one or two payments left to make." And so that he put everything in order. This boy, I mean, I talked to him. I know this family. And I know this pastor. I know this brother. And I don't know whether it was that day or the next day, he just gave up the ghost and went to be with the Lord. And then then the boy knew what he was saying and knew why he was saying it. In other words, there are times if we look to really see what he said. There are things that really need to be absorbed. &gt;&gt; There are things in the message that we can say, you know, I maybe don't fully understand that. But there comes a time within our church, within our spiritual walk. We say, "It's time for me to come to grips with that. &gt;&gt; It's time for me to deal with that." And so that is kind of where I'm coming right now. Last of all, he sent his son. There was the apostles and there was the reformers and there was a church age. And then finally comes the spirit of Elijah &gt;&gt; to do an introduction. And he does an introduction. And I'm afraid many times those who associate with the message don't catch the introduction or don't catch who he's actually introducing. &gt;&gt; But friends, we have had a marriage. We have had a union. and those that recognize really what happened. &gt;&gt; I can tell you that in today's economy, there's a lot of people that come to the altar and go through a marriage ceremony, but they don't understand what a marriage is all about. &gt;&gt; They don't understand when the scripture says the two are no longer twain. They are one. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But they don't understand that. And and that's that's just the age that we're in. And so now I have uh this is in the seventh seal. Now, when that gets on tape, which it is, that'll probably send 10,000 of my friends away from me because they're going to say, notice now, they're going to say that brother Brandham's trying to put himself or make himself a servant or a prophet or something before God. And let me tell you, my brother, my brethren, that is an error. I'm only telling you what I seen and what has been told to me. And now you do whatever you want to. &gt;&gt; I don't know what's going to take place. &gt;&gt; I do not know. I just know that those seven thunders holds that mystery and heavens was quieted. Everybody understand? Now uh this is what I have underlined. It may be time. This is the continuing of the same paragraph. It may be time. It may be the hour now that this great person &gt;&gt; that we're expecting to rise on the scene may rise on the scene. Maybe this ministry that I have tried to take people back to the word has laid a foundation. And if it has, I'll be leaving you for good. There won't be two of us here at the same time. See, if it is, and then he uses the same words John the Baptist uses while he was living and Christ was there. the two of them there says he he will he he will increase and I will decrease [Music] &gt;&gt; and that's what had to happen &gt;&gt; and so from the seals on the messages are coming but but the prophet's ministry is decreasing &gt;&gt; and there is another one &gt;&gt; who is present &gt;&gt; who I am troubled because many in the message. Don't see him &gt;&gt; when you refer to this Christ. They have someone back from the Sea of Galilee and back from Palestine and so on. It's another one. And it's not it is the same one. It is the same one, but he's not in that ministry. He's in this ministry. He's not back there revealing himself to Jews. And he even said, "Don't go to the Gentiles. don't just go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. But he's not saying that now. Now it's a different age. It's a different time. It's a different season and there's another one. There can't be two of us. He said at the same time. &gt;&gt; And if you can believe there are others who try to raise up and infer that maybe it's their ministry that brother Brandon was referring to. And I just say nonsense. &gt;&gt; Absolute nonsense. Why would why would God why would God send a uh such a vindicated messenger to to introduce somebody who has no vindication? &gt;&gt; I say, you know, I'm weary with it. &gt;&gt; And I just say, nonsense. &gt;&gt; There is no other hero. There is no other ministry. &gt;&gt; Absolute nonsense. There is another one and it's Jesus Christ. And if we could recognize fully who he is &gt;&gt; in the fullness, if we could recognize that this congregation could recognize who is amongst us, you'd see things you didn't even believe could happen. &gt;&gt; He wants to do it. &gt;&gt; He wants to manifest himself. &gt;&gt; But much of it lays back on us. &gt;&gt; On who do you say this is? &gt;&gt; What do you think of him? Thank you. &gt;&gt; In the very day, carrying on with the same this fine line, this razor's edge &gt;&gt; between the two, &gt;&gt; this razor's edge as it was between the spirit of Elijah and Christ himself. Just accept it. If you don't say it, just accept it and then follow on and see how the word will speak to you. &gt;&gt; In the very day that the son of man is revealed. &gt;&gt; That's Christ. In the very day that the son of man, Jesus Christ is revealed. Revelations 10:1-7. The seventh angel's message opening up the seals. He said, "What is it? Not the angel is the son of man." In other words, he's saying, "Not me. I'm not the son of man, but the messenger is revealing the son of man. And can you get that separated? &gt;&gt; That was the point. Can you get it separated? &gt;&gt; Now, he said that's where it seems to be so hard for you. And that's why Jesus when he was here, he was saying, "Unless you believe that I am he, &gt;&gt; excuse me. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe that I am he, you'll die in your sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'll say to the believers of the message, unless you believe that this one who this messenger revealed is he and there isn't another, &gt;&gt; we'll we'll just wither on the vine. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We'll end up being a powerless church. &gt;&gt; The church that God hates. &gt;&gt; We don't want that. &gt;&gt; Not when he's present to. In fact, invite us in. And I feel that's what these services are all about. &gt;&gt; I'm pouring my heart out to you now, friends. &gt;&gt; If this were my last message, this is the one I want it to be. &gt;&gt; I want to speak of him. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's where it seems to be so hard for you. Not that the son of man himself, but that the seventh angel, the seventh messenger, is revealing to the public the son of man. It's being revealed to the public. The son of man because it's left the shock. &gt;&gt; The life has left the shock. The life has left the leodysan because it has left the shock. He can't organize it. It's the grain itself again. Brother Brandham couldn't even organize it cuz it can't be organized. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's not just, you know, do you think so? It is the grain has left the shock. &gt;&gt; It has left the shock. &gt;&gt; The life has left the shock. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it can't be organized. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's where it's hard. It's where it's hard to get separated. That the veil is the flesh. &gt;&gt; The veil, William Brandham's veil &gt;&gt; is the flesh. &gt;&gt; Your veil is your flesh. &gt;&gt; And the veil is what keeps us from seeing God &gt;&gt; face to face in this church. Amen. &gt;&gt; The veil is what keeps us from seeing the angels &gt;&gt; at their positions &gt;&gt; this morning. &gt;&gt; This morning, &gt;&gt; your flesh, &gt;&gt; your veil is the problem. &gt;&gt; My veil is your problem. Your veil is your own problem. And our veils are our problem. [Applause] Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Keeps us from seeing God face to face from the angels in their positions this morning standing by their seat by the seats. The veil is what keeps us from seeing him. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Unless you believe that I am him, &gt;&gt; but it was the veil in that day and it's the veil in this day." And this same messenger who was revealing him said he's now in his bride. &gt;&gt; He isn't his people. &gt;&gt; And our problem is the veil. &gt;&gt; The veil is weak. &gt;&gt; The flesh is weak. &gt;&gt; You can't make it strong because it's weak. &gt;&gt; It'll never be strong. &gt;&gt; The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you wait for the flesh to get strong, you're going to miss it. &gt;&gt; You're going to miss what God has in store for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am what I am. Apostle Paul said, &gt;&gt; am &gt;&gt; we are what we are. &gt;&gt; Are we not to seek to improve ourselves? Yes. Crucify the flesh. Do whatever you need to do. But the thing is, don't hold up the program of God in your life. Because some of us are waiting for till we can do it and you can't do it. You got to let him do it. &gt;&gt; He's the only one who can do it. [Music] &gt;&gt; And this has been the problem. But last of all, he sent his son. And when he sent his son, they thought he was whether he thought he was a, as I've said in the previous services, a good teacher, a rabbi, a this or that, or whatever thing. You know, here when they send the messenger comes in this time and the prophet of God comes in this time, says, "Oh, he's a man of God. &gt;&gt; He's a prophet." And feeling that those were complimentary, they were, but it wasn't sufficient. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then when he came, when he was telling them plainly, I'm here to introduce another one. &gt;&gt; And if they would have read and heard the voice, they would have heard him say, there can't be two of us here at the same time. He didn't say it many times, but once is enough. &gt;&gt; And that's the critical spot. That's the razor edge right there. &gt;&gt; Who do you say this is? Now the message and the messenger are one. &gt;&gt; Now they now it gets to be such a fine razor's edge. The message and the messenger and I've heard it being used improperly to convince people that brother Brandham was something that he says clearly he wasn't. &gt;&gt; He was a messenger. He couldn't say it plainer. He's a son of man revealing the son of man. But it was the veil, the veil of that flesh which was the problem because people were trying to decipher the two. Don't try to decipher. Just take it what he said. Yeah. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And and we want to be thankful &gt;&gt; that God allowed us to come to such an age &gt;&gt; when we had such a messenger &gt;&gt; where we could scarcely tell &gt;&gt; who it was. &gt;&gt; One time he's in the eternities and the next time he's here and one time he's hunting and the next time he's in the heavenlies someplace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What kind of a person was it when Jesus said in John the 3rd chapter, even the son of man which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, put yourself there standing there with him. Was he in heaven? He said he was. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; What about the prophet messenger that said many times over and over and over again, I'm standing in two worlds? &gt;&gt; Which world is it? One is yours and one is the eternal one. One is the one where our knowledge is so limited and the other one is unlimited. &gt;&gt; This one we only understand in the present term. And then the other one that he was standing in, he tell them what was yesterday and what was right now and what they were going to experience when they went home. [Applause] &gt;&gt; What kind of a messenger is that? The reason why it was so supernatural is so that you could so that he would be fit to introduce the other one. &gt;&gt; It's the other one. &gt;&gt; Last of all, he said his son, &gt;&gt; not a messenger, his son. &gt;&gt; Last of all, &gt;&gt; his son. &gt;&gt; And they said he'll they'll surely reverence him. But they didn't reverence him. &gt;&gt; And friends, that's the point I'm on. We need to reverence him. &gt;&gt; Might be in this brother, might be in these young fellas, might be in the sisters, &gt;&gt; but reverence him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message respects, I'm just way ahead of myself now, but in the message respects, he spoke a of a number of people that didn't respect him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he wanted to speak of some that did respect him. &gt;&gt; And he spoke of the Sarapheneician woman also spoke of the woman that recognized sometimes the sisters within the message. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I want you sisters to know that God is calling for women of God &gt;&gt; in this message. &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel downtrend. You can be exactly in your place. &gt;&gt; You can be in a godly place. &gt;&gt; And yet there is a time and she said that she perceived and the prophet makes makes special note of it. She perceived that this was a man of God &gt;&gt; and she told her husband this is a man of God. All right. &gt;&gt; She wasn't teaching him. &gt;&gt; She was telling him what was a reality to her. &gt;&gt; This man's a man of God. &gt;&gt; And the man recognized he has a woman of God. &gt;&gt; He's got a godly woman. &gt;&gt; And she was due respects. And so uh he she he said he's a man of God. Can't we and the prophet puts it, can't we get a contractor in here and build a little place a place where he can rest? to see his his hair is hanging down and into his beard and so on so forth and tries to describe him. Can't we? And the husband says, "Yes, he is a man of God. I've I've heard of him, etc." And so they make a place for him to rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "While the prophet's laying there with his he's he's laying on the cot, laying on the bed that she has prepared for him." She worked in her ministry. &gt;&gt; Brought water and served him and did that's what she did for her husband. That's what she did. and his feet was washed and he was laying there. He said he was just laying there so refreshed &gt;&gt; and his hair washed and his feet washed and he's laying there and it just comes to him. What can I do? He didn't say, "What can I do for the man? &gt;&gt; What can I do for this woman?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. I'm preaching the word of God. What can I do for this woman? I'm speaking that because brethren sometime we need to recognize that God, this God I'm speaking about is in this woman. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What can I do for this woman? Gahesa said she hasn't got a child. Call her. &gt;&gt; Not call him. Call her. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And she comes and stands &gt;&gt; said about this time next year, you'll have a child. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What was those words were going out creating life? &gt;&gt; It's the words of God. It was the God in her that washed his feet. It was the God in her that made a bed. It was the God in her that prepared a place because she recognized the God in him. And then he responded to the God in her &gt;&gt; about this time you'll have life. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, sometimes we take things too casual. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I just recognize that I've seen it in my own little ministry and someone will come and they will say, you know, what do you think about this? And so on and we'll have a discussion about it. Then the next person comes and says, what do you say about this? &gt;&gt; And I say, well, you know, I I think it's probably like this way. And they go and take that as God's absolute word. &gt;&gt; And you know what happens? It works for them &gt;&gt; because it's exactly what brother Brandham said, I can't help you. &gt;&gt; He said, if you come here now, he's a prophet of God. He's a vindicator. He sees visions. &gt;&gt; He's the spirit of Elijah. But the people if if they don't recognize him and the God in him, and he says, "I can't help you. I can't do anything for you." That's the same God that's in the church. That's the same God that's in the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the same God that's in your home. &gt;&gt; In your life. And we as individuals have to respect the God in our life. You have to respect the fact that God called you. Out of billions of people, God called you. I'm talking about God who created heavens and earth. God called you. And God saw God called you before you were conceived. &gt;&gt; God called you and brought you forth at this time to hear this word and to believe this message. God called you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm so moved. &gt;&gt; I'm so affected. It's been affecting me very very deeply. in a personal way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes even in our daily life, it's, you know, we it's fine. We just treat people and and speak to them or whether it's husband, wife, children, whatever more. And I remember brother Billy Paul saying how his daddy spoke to him about how he would correct his child. And uh I won't repeat it because I don't I don't know the exact details of it but I know that you know he talked about how we bring up our children and so on but how how the body of Jesus Christ I I read plenty in the scripture I this goes on the internet that's fine but I read plenty in the scripture that leaves me a sense of conviction. It talks about, you know, the honor we have for one another in the body of Christ and that we are kindly affectionate to one another. &gt;&gt; And I'm not one that's really given over to the, you know, the kind of affectionate kind of stuff, but it says we should be kindly affectionate to one another, embrace one another, and and so on. You know, that's not because it's something that we ought to do. It's because something we ought to feel. We ought to have an honor and a respect. And I believe that there is a place that we can come to. I really do. And especially when we are hearing the message in the message respects and I I might bounce all over the the map today and I hope you don't mind but in in the message respects brother Brandham reads a scripture out of Psalms 105 and it it ends up with or part part of the scripture says touch not mine anointed &gt;&gt; ets no harm. And the touch is don't reach or extend to strike or to be stricken to be defeated or to be stricken or to do them no harm. Don't do them many bad. Don't do any evil or to be displeasing or injurious. Don't injure someone. Don't say something that injures them or puts them down or suffer or hurt. Uh don't shatter them. Don't be that they were broken in pieces. You see, and I mentioned last week, and I would like if you could I pray that this would be branded on your heart where the respect and the honor, it doesn't benefit the one that's being respected. &gt;&gt; It benefits the one that is doing the respecting. I took the scripture, honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long on the earth. Another scripture says that thy days may be prolonged on the earth. It doesn't say anything about the mother and father being benefit. Says you're benefited. &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham says, if you believe me &gt;&gt; to be God's prophet, I can help you. &gt;&gt; If you don't, I can't &gt;&gt; I can't do anything for you. He says another place and this is really takes some thinking. Thinking won't really do it. But he says now it depends on where what you think this is. &gt;&gt; If you think it's of God, that's where your reward will come from. &gt;&gt; If you think it's of the devil, that's where your reward will come from. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that person standing there on a razor's edge? what we think of something that's being preached or something that's being said. I tell you what friends, I just I just have such hesitation. But if a person has ulterior motives and taking the gospel of taking this proven vindicated message and has an ulterior motive say I will use this for some self exaltation. I will use this for to put myself forward or I'll you know to prove then then that's a dangerous spot to be in. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. That's right. I would like to just go through some various quotes here also in a moment and this is I'm I'm going through some various stages here and if you if I lose you fine uh just if you have a question later on I'll be fine I'll be happy to have answer any question I can. But I I I'm I'm wanting to instruct. I'm wanting to teach. I'm wanting to impose upon you something that's very heavy on my heart. And that is we need to get to a place, come to a place, get to a place where the supernatural is happening &gt;&gt; in the inner veil. The prophet says, "But if you ever if you ever get to a place where you can be so hid away in God until the outside world is dead &gt;&gt; and the veil drops over you, &gt;&gt; folks, there is a place &gt;&gt; or he wouldn't refer to it." Amen. &gt;&gt; If you could ever get to a place where the outside world is you are hid away in God and the outside world is dead and the veil drops over you. When the veil shades you from the outside world, was you ever so lost in Christ, so prayed through until the world you had no more to do with it at all? You walked humbly every day before Christ, loving him first. And that's what you need. In the message, thirsting for life, he talks about uh from the scripture, as the heart panth after the waterbrook, so panth my soul after after thee, oh God. He said, when men and women get to a place that they've got to have God or die, &gt;&gt; you will get the waterbrook. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we get to a place that we've got to have God or die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about come to church. I'm not talking about go to the prayer meeting. Talking about desiring God. &gt;&gt; Tell if I don't have this, I die. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. said, "If you're sick and need healing, if you're in a desperate condition, I can say there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's veins where sinners plunge beneath the flood and lose all their guilty stains." He said, "It's life everlasting to know him. &gt;&gt; Not to know his book, not to know his church, not to know his creed, but to know him." Amen. &gt;&gt; Not to know all the things that of of the message and and certain things and be able to speak certain jargon and so on so forth. I now I go back to and I'm going to be referring to it through says the message and the messenger is the same thing. So well brother Ed you were privileged you knew brother Brandham that's yes I did and you went with him. Yes I did. And that was wonder that must have been wonderful. It was wonderful, but it was far more wonderful to become attached to the words that came out of his mouth because those words I received as the author of this book. &gt;&gt; And I had to be the author of the book because the author made the book live. &gt;&gt; Things I never understood became clear. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm saying something to you, friends. This church doesn't exist to produce some ministry or to produce a congregation. This church exists to introduce Jesus Christ, the author of this book, the one who sent this messenger, the one who's revealed, who has been revealed. He has revealed himself &gt;&gt; a living person. [Music] &gt;&gt; But to know him, your personal savior and lord fills you with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; It puts life in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. say people say, "Well, I'm in the message." What does that mean? &gt;&gt; Oh, they're in the message or they're not in the message or they're this one's in the me. What does that mean? &gt;&gt; That phrase is an idle dull phrase. &gt;&gt; What you're really saying is that person's in Christ. &gt;&gt; How can a person who's in Christ have their mouth filled with venom &gt;&gt; and poison? and injurious things I have to say over this pulpit and to the world. It's not Christ and that's not the message. &gt;&gt; It's not the message I know. It's not the Christ I know. &gt;&gt; And that's a terrible thing &gt;&gt; to say, "I'm in Christ. I'm in the message." If we're in the message, we're saying we're in Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm in Jesus Christ. friends. When this service is over, I'm going to hike along home and you'll probably either love me or hate me when it's done. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in a bunch of phrases. &gt;&gt; Phrases we become acquainted and accustomed to and we just go over them like that. say as soon as I hear in in the message I'm thinking of the person &gt;&gt; because my messenger said you can't divide the two they are the same &gt;&gt; the message and the messenger are one &gt;&gt; and then some would take it and make the messenger something he said he wasn't &gt;&gt; say well if the message and the messenger is Christ and the message is Christ and the messenger what is he &gt;&gt; he's a he's a vessel he was just the veil to introduce this Christ. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And the world knew, God knew that it' be so close and be it confusing. That's why you had to say, "Can you get it separated now?" &gt;&gt; And you say, "Did I get that close to it?" Don't, whatever you do, sinner, backslider, whoever you are, don't get that close and miss it. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking the reality of the message now. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand talked about the Pentecostal movement at this time is in 59 and he said it was a little small group and they became thousands of people. they grew. And in the message return in Jubilee in Shriefport, he said, I believe that this is the hour of Jubilee again of Jubilee. He said, I believe that 50 years ago in Louisiana, &gt;&gt; this great state where the Pentecostal people are powerful and strong. And he said within 50 years that the church has grown from a little handful of people of down on Isuza Street until one of the mightiest churches marching forward in the world today. &gt;&gt; He says we're grateful for that. &gt;&gt; See how kind he is. We're grateful for that. &gt;&gt; And and here's a messenger who's got a message that's cutting that denomination at its very roots. But he's thankful for what God did. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And I'm thanking God for that." &gt;&gt; He says, "And I'm also and I am so glad to be one of them that God through his marvelous grace saw fit one day &gt;&gt; to bring me into them and make me a part of them." &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, "And it is by no means that I say this next thing." &gt;&gt; Amen. through any harm, but through the zealousness of zealous, but through zealous of the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But that the church yet has grown in numbers and it has grown in power. It has grown in finance, but it has fallen from what it had spiritually. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now, that kind of man I can love. &gt;&gt; I'm glad for it. I'm glad for what God did. I'm thankful to be associated. I'm thankful for be connected. But in 50 years, you fell from &gt;&gt; you grown in numbers. You grown in finance. You grown in this. You grown in the other thing. But you've lost out spiritually. &gt;&gt; That's where I don't want to be. [Applause] There's nothing wrong with the numbers and nothing wrong with with growing or nothing wrong with God pouring in the finance or whatever more to do what you need to do. He poured in cattle and sheep and camels and gold and silver to Abraham cuz he needed it &gt;&gt; to be the father of the faith. &gt;&gt; He needed it to start off the message that God had sent him. We need what we have friends. If you had my If you had my emails, I get I get called from all over the world every day. People desiring things. They want things. Why? Because we reached out to them. They've reached back. &gt;&gt; Could you send this? Could you help us with that? Could you help us with the translation? Whatever. More. Ask Sister Sarah or the brother John or those brother Kim who work in the office. They're just request all the time. And I intend to do whatever we can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just a little email this morning before I come to church. They want to they want a hub in Lousoto, South Africa. Well, yeah. Or we can say, "Oh, they got thousands of believers over there. Let them look after it." Well, if they don't look after it, I'll get their reward. &gt;&gt; I'll be happy to do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'll be happy to have their reward. &gt;&gt; And God sees us, we pour $1,000 out. It says, "What do you know? I got to pour $1,000 in &gt;&gt; cuz these folks are going to respond. &gt;&gt; We are going to respond." And we have &gt;&gt; for 40 years, 35, 40 years, we've responded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many got the last report from China, brother? Yeah, praise the Lord. Handful. You ought to read it. It was incredible. The book of Acts is being written. I don't know what chapter we're in right now. &gt;&gt; He said, and then but the greatest thing he said they could have held to would have been the Holy Spirit that God by his marvelous grace had poured out upon them if they would have held to that. The bride of Jesus Christ, I'm saying indeed has experienced mighty revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; But yet, it must be ultra cautious &gt;&gt; that the zeal and dynamics don't wain &gt;&gt; or be lost. &gt;&gt; The zeal and dynamics. &gt;&gt; This cannot deteriorate just to a church. &gt;&gt; It's got to be a zealous church. &gt;&gt; A church with fire in your bosom. has to be a church that loves God &gt;&gt; and loves God's people and loves God's work. &gt;&gt; It must be that way. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the material things are. Take that away. But let us have that zeal and ferveny of God. &gt;&gt; That when you shake a hand with a brother or sister, they know you mean it. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? That's right. He went on to say and he was he was speaking of in this return uh and Jubilee he was speaking to one of the old fathers that had told him and it was sister Mover's father and he told him in the early days back in the days I'm not trying to reproduce that but the same God &gt;&gt; is the same God that's here. &gt;&gt; And if I don't believe that, I'd go out that door and say, "Sal so long, folks." &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, he told me the early days back in those days, now this is the messenger to revealing the son of man. &gt;&gt; This is part of the revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Saying that I'm God. I change not. &gt;&gt; He doesn't diminish in power. &gt;&gt; He doesn't diminish in desire. The one he desired years ago, he desires today. The fellowship he desired, he still desires that. &gt;&gt; Told me that in early days back, he said they were persecuted and turned out from everywhere. &gt;&gt; That he was in a meeting once to where they had forbid them to worship the Lord in the spirit. &gt;&gt; We've been put out. I my whole family was put out asked to leave a church of four 400 450 people. I was teaching Sunday school but then they found out that I believed in baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that was it. Asked not to come back. You know the class I had taken the pastor had asked me to take it. He was the he would been the teacher of the class was young married couples. It was really the core of that church and he took a liking to me and said would would you teach this class? So for the next while I was teaching that class and then we were told to leave. told to leave period. And uh the next Sunday I tried to go to another church and it was closed up for camp or something and uh we had such an experience as I drove up. I was the only only the car place was totally vacant. I pulled up and right behind the van, the van, the van was the dog catcher and he had a great big net and he was going to catch this dog and the dog was on the church steps right at the double doors just kind of cowering going and I didn't know what it meant to my wife and my kids are in the back seat. I thought, "Oh my goodness, here I'm coming to I'm just going to try another church. I just I felt I got to go to church and get a crumb or loaf of piece of bread or something. And here they were out there catching this dog. And God had spoken to me and told me to go back to the very church we had been kicked out of. And I went back there. Don't believe it was that Sunday. It was maybe the Sunday before. I went back and I said to my family, "We're going back. We're going to walk in that church as though nothing happened. And we're going to sit where we always sit. So we did. You're nice and quiet. The best is yet to come. And uh when Sunday school came uh you know we all filed out to go to the Sunday school which last week or the week before I was teaching. And now because we were the last ones up the stairs into this little room. The whole the whole room was filled. Sunday school room was filled and I had to sit right in the front seat right in front of the pastor because the pastor took it over again. and and and I felt so sorry for him because he's a he's we became very very dear friends. We went to their cabin. We spent a lot of time talked about brother Bram's meetings in in Windsor and he told me astounding things and he was really gripped in his heart and he knew all about it. It wasn't him that put us out understand. So he stood there and his lips started to tremble literally move and he he said uh we'll read the I I'll read the text for this lesson and his text was and they accused him of many things and he answered them not a word and I was sitting there God bless you, brother Ripley. And this brother, he was telling brother Brandham, he said they were persecuted and turned out from everywhere. And he was in a meeting once where they had forbid them to worship the Lord in the in in the spirit. And a group a group of people came up and shot through the windows with rifles and pistols. And an old sister was standing in the floor with her hands up in the air praising God. And while the windows were being riddled with bullets from rifles and the bullets struck the woman's dress and fell to the floor without harming her. &gt;&gt; She was a she was a greater caliber than those guns were. She was of a different caliber, wasn't she? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She's praising God. &gt;&gt; He says, "We need to go back." And this is his next line. We need to go back to a power of God &gt;&gt; and something that can do the same thing today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So he wasn't calling on the same thing in and exact happening but the same thing, the same power, the same and and are are we are we in agreement with that? &gt;&gt; I want to see God in reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You do as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as I have been speaking to you, the most important and fundamental thing that we all can do, I'm going to be a little wild, so you're all right. &gt;&gt; The most important and fundamental thing that we all can do is to give the Lord Jesus Christ. This one I'm speaking of, this one is so hard to get separated. Give the Lord Jesus Christ and the message or the words he has sent to us their rightful place &gt;&gt; of honor and respect in our hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever that God is, if it's in the if it's in the pastor, if it's in the ministry, if it's in the deacons, if it's in the wives, husbands, children, wherever that God is, I believe that we will be as a congregation infinitely blessed &gt;&gt; if we would make that as our as our charge and a commission in our life. &gt;&gt; I'm going to respect that. I'm going to honor that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Speaking on receiving him, once we know who he is, &gt;&gt; once we recognize him &gt;&gt; and then we receive that and give it its proper place &gt;&gt; in the Easter Seal, he said, "Notice God's life moving through them and in them quickened their minds to his word." And he said, "Now, let me say that quietly." Now, the spirit of God that moves among the people quickens the mind of the person in the promise of God. He said, "And see it doesn't. I'm trying to show you and let you realize that I'm speaking now of the church." He wasn't speaking of himself. He's speaking of the church. Speaking of you and I, and I want to receive that personally. And it also quickened to life in him. Although they although they only were his attributes to begin with, but if God said in this day back in the beginning, &gt;&gt; John Doe will be my servant. If God said that back in the beginning, John Doe will be my servant. Millions of years ago, now John Doe was born in sin, shaped in iniquity, and come into the world speaking lies because he was immortal or he's immortal. But maybe he gets a little religious feeling. He will join a church. Maybe he will join a Pentecostal church. I don't know. He might join anything. But let him get under the atmosphere of God once. John Doe is bound to recognize who his father is. [Music] &gt;&gt; How do you receive him if you haven't recognized who your father is? All right. &gt;&gt; This message isn't a bunch of books or tapes on a shelf. &gt;&gt; This is the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Say, "Will we believe this? Will we believe?" I don't care what you believe. If you miss Christ, if you miss the person of Christ, it doesn't matter what you believe. &gt;&gt; You can be the most precise person, but if you don't have the spirit of Christ in you, then what have you got? Nothing. &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; You could prove on every point we're exactly correct on this message if you haven't got the spirit of him. We're nothing. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about every word. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about some words. I'm talking about every word. The day you read a message, the day you read a quote, the person said, "Well, yeah." And they're off on somewhere else, you can just tuck it down in your heart. That person, man, woman, or child, is not they're not engaged. They're not united in oneness with the Christ. I know [Applause] &gt;&gt; he's bound to recognize &gt;&gt; who his father is. &gt;&gt; Now, this is an absolute to me if that person, now it's not John Doe, but put your name there. When you &gt;&gt; come under the atmosphere of God once, &gt;&gt; you're bound to recognize who your father is. &gt;&gt; And when you recognize him, then you can receive him. convinced and this I've written down. I'm convinced that the degree of control that we allow the message to have in our lives is directly connected to who &gt;&gt; we believe is speaking through the prophet &gt;&gt; and servants of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The degree that we allow the word to have control in our lives &gt;&gt; is directly connected to what we who we believe is speaking. And faith is the substance. &gt;&gt; 47 one of the first messages. And may everyone that comes tonight, I've highlighted all of this. And may everyone that comes tonight &gt;&gt; come like they did when they passed by your humble servant. &gt;&gt; Simon Peter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now he's spanning 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; May everyone who comes tonight &gt;&gt; in 1947 come as they did before Peter. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's not making any distinction between Peter in 1947. And I don't make any distinction between 47 and 2011. It's God. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord. I change not. &gt;&gt; What he liked back then, he still likes. What he loved, he loved. What he hates, he still hates. &gt;&gt; He loves righteousness and hates iniquity. [Music] He said, "When they came before your humble servant, Simon Peter, and they were laid in his shadow and were made every wit whole because because they recognized God in the man. &gt;&gt; They weren't made whole because it was a shadow of Peter. They were made whole because they recognized who it was &gt;&gt; in the man. Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; You know, I have to be a little bit personal, but don't take it as though I'm speaking myself. Not at all. One day I was here in the office not long ago and I thought, "Oh man, it's lunchtime. I should have something." And my wife says I should have something and should go. What do I want? I should have maybe a muffin or something. You know, just it's noon. I should have a muffin or something. So I thought, "No, I'll just wait. It's getting late." And then no, I'll go. And I was in one of those. I'll go. No, I'll wait. I'll go. No, I'll wait. And I was in such a state of indecision. I went and got in my car and I I I I there's a wired monks up here and on 64th and it's close. So I thought I'll just go up there and I thought I'm kind of tired of it. Maybe I'll go down to Tim Hortons just to down down over the hill. So I thought, "Yeah, I'll go to Tim Hortons." No. So it was actually telling on my steering wheel and uh and I did something very foolish. So I thought, "No, I'm going to go to Tim Horton." So I just going right and wired monk's right there in the driveway almost went past it and I thought I'm going to go in here and I went right across two lanes of traffic. That was a crazy thing to do. I was just glad, you know. So I got in there and and uh uh I I just walked in the door and uh counter right there and I wanted to find out if they still had some soup. So I leaned on the counter like this and lady says, "Hi, how are you?" I said, "I'm fine. Have you got any soup?" And just then I felt an arm come around around over my shoulder. I had round over my shoulder like that. And I looked up and it was Sharon. Sharon couldn't believe Sharon Van enter was there. I'd never seen my granddaughter in that place ever. What are you doing here? Well, she said I I and I could see her her face and eyes were kind of shallow and deep sunk. And she says, "Well, I had to work today." And there there she's carrying these three babies. Said, "You had to work today?" Yeah. She said, "I I went to work at 6:00." And I said, "You don't have any business working. Do you want these babies or do you want to work?" And she said, "Well, yeah, I know. You know, I'm feeling good, Grandpa." And so on so forth. So, we sat and had our our lunch together. And I preached to her. I really felt on my heart, you should be home just having your feet up and you should be home just resting. And I was so impressed with that. And she's she's strong and feeling good. And she hadn't been sick an hour in her in all of all of her time carrying these children. Not sick for one hour. She is feeling real good. And but there was it was a bit of a hard day. And I got back to the office and I picked up the phone and I called her husband. He was at work. I said, "Brother Marco, I just I was just in Wired Monk and Sharon was there and we sat down. I said, "She should not be working. She really shouldn't be working." And I said, "It it's, you know, it it tells on her. Maybe she doesn't realize it, but it it uh I can see it in her face. What does he do? He picks up the phone, calls her immediately. Cuz he wasn't receiving that from grandpa. He receiving that as a man of God. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he was acting on. He picked up the phone immediately and said, "Quit work." And she quit work that day. &gt;&gt; And you know what? and all this last, you know, all his last weeks and everything, everything just going along perfect. I'm not saying it's because of that, but I'm saying God's pleased with that. &gt;&gt; God's pleased with that. &gt;&gt; And then a lot of times, you know, people get into all kinds of snags and trouble and everything else. And and I know that if they would have listened, &gt;&gt; they wouldn't be in that problem. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it depends on you. I say, "Well, are you saying that God was speaking through you?" I don't know. But he took it as that. &gt;&gt; Do you catch what I'm saying? He took it as that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then God realizes I got to move. &gt;&gt; He has believed in his heart. He's heard from me. [Music] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, if that I I don't take that as God." What if it was? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe mother, father, you can bring right down to your home. You young people, you hear, "Well, dad says this. Well, dad thinks that and mom thinks this." Maybe it's not God thinks that or or dad thinks that or mom thinks that. Maybe it's God that thinks that. &gt;&gt; It'll surely be in accordance with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Have you got a few more minutes for me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One of the greatest blessings is a razor's edge from the greatest curse. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. One of the greatest blessings is a razor's edge from the greatest curse. Jesus said, I want you to just catch this now and catch this phrase, me and my words. Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in glory of his father with the holy angels, &gt;&gt; me and my words. In John 12:48, he that rejectth me and receive He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hath one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken shall judge him in that last day. John 14 and 23 23 John Jesus answered and said unto them, if a man love me, he will keep my words. &gt;&gt; It was he he in his words, me and my words. If you do not believe that I am he, &gt;&gt; who is I? &gt;&gt; And who is he? &gt;&gt; The same one. &gt;&gt; You may think I'm I'm I I'm from the carpenter shop. I am. &gt;&gt; So what's the difference? &gt;&gt; Whether I'm from the carpenter shop. Say, well, he he just works at, you know, he's a mechanic or he's this or he's other. He's But if he's a son of God, he has God in him. &gt;&gt; If she's a daughter of God, have God in him. [Music] [Applause] He says, "And he will keep my words and conjunction." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My father will love him &gt;&gt; and we will come unto him. &gt;&gt; Isn't this incredible? &gt;&gt; All you've done is kept his words. &gt;&gt; Who's the beneficiary? Is God made greater? No. You're the beneficiary. &gt;&gt; You just keep his words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if and if you believe this message, that's why you're here. If the message and the messenger are one &gt;&gt; and the messenger said this is Christ &gt;&gt; and you have received Christ and you are honoring him and you're giving him all the adoration, listen to me. And in that simple act, that's why I said this is a critical message. In that simple act, if you believe what Jesus said, if you honor my words, if you keep my words, my father will love you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I don't care who rejects you or who turns you out or who cast you out. But if I have my father who loves me &gt;&gt; and we will come to him &gt;&gt; in the good times and in the bad times. We will come to him. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, I could do a dance. I feel so energized. This is I'm taking this word by word truth as the truth of God &gt;&gt; and we will come to him [Music] &gt;&gt; and make our abode with him. &gt;&gt; We're not going to come and visit him. We're going to come and make our abode. Do you believe these words? &gt;&gt; That's the words of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let me go quickly. I'm going to go quickly as I can. Please don't weary on me, will you? &gt;&gt; I've made a note. Notice if the message and the messenger are one, then we have the essence of both present. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That can help us. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We got connected. Just about couldn't get disconnected. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then we have the essence of both &gt;&gt; present with us. &gt;&gt; I haven't got a bunch of books and just a bunch of tapes. We got the very messenger and his message with us. &gt;&gt; The message is Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might think I'm crazy, but you say, "Oh, brother Ed, you were with Brother Brandham." So were you. &gt;&gt; This is This is his whole life poured out. &gt;&gt; This is his whole being poured out. &gt;&gt; This is what he lived for. &gt;&gt; This is his life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the spiritual food, he says, "We find out that when a man comes sent from God, ordained of God with the truth, thus saith the Lord, the message and the messenger are one and the same." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he is sent to represent thus sayaith the Lord, &gt;&gt; word by word. And he and his message is the same. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make him Christ, but it makes him inseparable from the message. &gt;&gt; And it makes Christ the message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's inseparable from the message. &gt;&gt; If you can get it, friends, &gt;&gt; I don't ever to I won't approach this again. He says, "Now we find out that Elijah could say that because the message of the hour and the word of God or the messenger, the message, the message and the word of God was exactly the same thing. &gt;&gt; The prophet, the word, the message, messenger, message and the man was the same thing." &gt;&gt; Messenger message and the man were the same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If I do not the works," now he goes to the scripture. "If I do not the works uh that was written of me, then don't believe me." &gt;&gt; If we don't do, and I'll bring it right down home. If we don't do the works of the bride of Jesus Christ, we're married. If we act like we're, you know, just free to do anything or be united with something else and people start looking over the fence in the message, you start looking over the fence back to some denomination or some creed or back to Pentecost. That's not the that's not being honorable to your husband. &gt;&gt; That's like looking over the fence and seeing the neighbor. &gt;&gt; Come on. We're not interested in their programs. I'm not interested in their talent. I'm not interested in their worship. I'm not interested in her doctrine. I'm not interested in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're married to one husband &gt;&gt; called Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; and we haven't got eyes for anybody else. [Music] You may dislike that, but I know many of you do like it. &gt;&gt; That's the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; And when the believers of this message have become completely united with the message who is Christ, &gt;&gt; then they're not looking for another message. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's not another Christ. This is him. [Applause] I haven't run out of things to say. I'm just thinking about whether I should say it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If we give the message high regard and respect it with godly fear and reverence, we are respecting the messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The message. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the word. &gt;&gt; Don't worry friends, you can't give it too much honor. &gt;&gt; That's what God has spoke &gt;&gt; through his messenger vindicated. And this is the word and I believe it. And then all of you become one. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. teach your children to do the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm fully aware we hear, you know, the other ministers, Brother John, Brother Tom, and Brother Andes and different ones. And often we hear about the families, but we're we're all a family. And I I recognize that some of you don't have children here. Maybe you haven't even got home or wife or husband or whatever more. And you may not have children here. But don't don't don't feel for a moment that there isn't a sense of responsibility. Not so much a responsibility, but it's an opportunity for you to be an example to even to others &gt;&gt; and say a wise word to them and improving his word. I want to talk now just for a few moments about the approach. I got two things more I want to say. I want to say about the approach. The mechanics and the dynamics are present. &gt;&gt; But yet it requires the right attitude and approach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mechanics and the dynamics are both here &gt;&gt; because the message is here. &gt;&gt; The word is here. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is here. &gt;&gt; There's more dynamics than you can even lay hold of. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; See, I'm going to I'm going to say something, friends. There's things that happen on a regular basis, and some of the greatest things that take place, we're not even able to really speak about because what you see here is just the tip of the iceberg. &gt;&gt; And so much is happening. I'm talking about lives that are changed, &gt;&gt; lives that are shaped &gt;&gt; by the word of God and catastrophes which are avoided &gt;&gt; and terrible injurious things which are avoided and and homes and lives of young and older alike are are made so uh protected. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? in proving his word. He says, "But before we pray for the sick, &gt;&gt; now we've got to get the people in the that attitude." &gt;&gt; It's the attitude that always always Do you say amen to always always brings the results? &gt;&gt; It's not the preacher that brings the results. It's the attitude that brings the results. Yes. &gt;&gt; Once again, your approach, &gt;&gt; you're the beneficiary. &gt;&gt; Even when you come forward for prayer, it should be different. I would urge you to come differently. I don't care who's who's ministered, who's handled the word of God saying, "I am coming. I don't care whether there be some deacons, but but your attitude saying I am coming to the God in these people. I'm coming to the God in this servant of God. &gt;&gt; You can pray for one another. Husband, wife, you can pray for one another. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you friends, I'm not preaching here for my health. I'm preaching here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that we have we have much much more &gt;&gt; than we access &gt;&gt; and we have it here. &gt;&gt; And I'm urging you, you know, write the check. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said that so many people, they got the bank account full, but they don't know how to write a check. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. Sometimes I believe &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the attitude &gt;&gt; that you take towards God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Here's a woman touched his garment." &gt;&gt; And then he said, "But here's here's a soldier that took a hold of him and touched him and struck him. He didn't get any virtue and she got it all. &gt;&gt; What was the difference? The difference wasn't with him. He had all the power. He could have forgiven the soldiers sins. &gt;&gt; But he was condemned because his attitude was wrong and her attitude was right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's your he said it's your approach to the divine gift &gt;&gt; that brings the results. You may say, "Well, Brother Biscll, you spoke this and you said some of these same quotes. I don't know whether I did or not. I tried to get away from it, but I couldn't get away from this because I want to see a church that gains and has results. I want to see things change in your lives, in your homes, &gt;&gt; in every area. &gt;&gt; And it's not some pie in the sky. It's right here. [Music] It's present with you. &gt;&gt; The word of faith is near you, even in your mouth. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he says, it's your approach to a divine gift what brings the results. It's the way you come to it. &gt;&gt; That's right. said, "If you believe, then I can help you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the scripture, he that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's been a text from our last services. I maybe just drop this in as humans. We are so to say moving targets. We're healthy and strong today. We become weakened perhaps few years down the road. say, "Well, I you know my dad or the pastor or someone else's frail old man anymore." Or they saw Jesus, that young prophet out of Nazareth standing there and declaring the word and giving the message on the mountain and they wondered at the gracious lips, the gracious words that came from his lips. And then on down he he aids so quickly. A moving target and he gets to be stooped over with his shoulders. He's carrying your sins and mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he looks wearied. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he looks 50 and he's only 30. And I thought I could have heard him. Oh, I I so rejoiced back there. But now he's saying strange things. I I don't know what's happened. Talking about eating his flesh and drinking his blood. And my goodness, who can who can even understand that? I don't understand. I don't understand what happened to him. I was ready to accept his doctrine. I was ready to join his movement back then. Everything's changed so much. You know, that's why brother Brent talks about the marriage and between husband and wife, she's always your sweetheart. You're always his sweetheart. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; He said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." &gt;&gt; I don't care if you're in the vigor of your youth and the beauty of your youth or whether you're old and decrepit. I will never leave you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hang on just for a few minutes, please. David. &gt;&gt; So, here come this man, a Elisha and he's walking down and the little kids, the children. I know that you children never would do that. You're taught different, but they're running down cuz they heard it at home. &gt;&gt; They heard it as a baldhead. Why didn't he go up? You you followed Elijah. Elijah went up. Why didn't you go up? And so they're running along. Oh, you baldhead. Why don't you go up? Why didn't you go up? And the scripture tells us, the Bible tells us they turned around, cursed them. &gt;&gt; And 42 of them at she bears came out and killed 42 children. You say, "Oh, that's so awful." Brother Brandham says, "Now this is why you need a messenger." Brother Brandham says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; That he was cursing their parents &gt;&gt; for having said what they said. &gt;&gt; And now they ended up with some funerals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we just see things on the surface. Then how can God do that? Well, listen friends, God, you know what your prophet said? He said that the world and the unbelievers and the haters of the haters of purity and holiness says it's atomic fodder. &gt;&gt; Now you may not understand that. You don't have to understand that God is going to hold this world accountable &gt;&gt; for having hated righteousness. &gt;&gt; Anyway, better get off that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm closing just a few minutes now. It's almost 1:00 and I'm I'm not going to apologize, but I just say I'll just be a few minutes. You've been very kind. &gt;&gt; And show us the father and it'll satisfy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, he's speaking to a lady. He said, uh, I'm taking this as a principle. Not back there. Don't take the quote back there. You have the message and you have the messenger. You have the whole essence of this. &gt;&gt; You have what the messenger lived for. You have it here. &gt;&gt; You don't have to say, "Well, that was back there." No, it's right here. &gt;&gt; I want you to get that fixed in your mind. It's not way back there. Say, "Well, that was 56. No, that No, it's right here. It's 2011." &gt;&gt; What about you, lady? Could be any lady here. Oh, you believe you believe that I'm your brother? Number one, &gt;&gt; but do you believe that I become your brother plus &gt;&gt; God's prophet? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the plus factor. &gt;&gt; You believe me to be your brother, &gt;&gt; but you believe me to be your brother plus &gt;&gt; God's prophet. &gt;&gt; And this was critical. This was absolutely critical because he says you believe that &gt;&gt; then I can help you. &gt;&gt; Friends, &gt;&gt; listen. This comes down to all of us. &gt;&gt; We need to get the plus factor. &gt;&gt; You're my brother in Christ plus &gt;&gt; a bloodbought &gt;&gt; bride member &gt;&gt; of the body of Jesus Christ. You're part of his body. You're part of the one who I say I love. &gt;&gt; We need the plus factor. &gt;&gt; The man who stands behind this pulpit, I'm not speaking of myself. Whoever stands behind this pulpit is God's servant. He's your brother. us &gt;&gt; for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance &gt;&gt; and we can't apologize over that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon wasn't getting anything by saying plus his prophet. &gt;&gt; He said I wanted to be a trapper. &gt;&gt; I wanted to be in the wilderness. Listen, I happen to know. Don't ever ask me to answer this question because I won't tell you. But I happen to know the very place when brother Brandon was preaching Bruce Serpent and was so sick at his heart over some of the things that were happening. He wanted to come up and buy a place. I know the exact place. He talked about it on the Alaskan highway and told me how much money he had. And he said, "I just come up here and help Bud." As he was ready to give it up because they were going to start a Bible school teaching him was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I you know what I said? I said, "Well, brother Brandham," I said, 'You know, if you want to just be up here in the wilderness, you can you can catch a a jet out of Fort Nelson and fly anywhere in the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was right at that time. If they felt they were giving him honor, it wasn't honor &gt;&gt; because it's not in the word. He said in one of his last messages that he spoke on earth, it was easy for those Jews who'd been taught through generations to believe that there was a great supernatural God, but to think that that God had come down. &gt;&gt; To think that that God who they believed and they understood that that God had come down and was manifesting himself through the person of his son Jesus Christ. And that's why I said if you don't believe that I am he, you'll die in your unbelief. &gt;&gt; Jesus wouldn't change. He wouldn't diminish. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't make him a non-savior or a non-healer. He'd still be a healer. He'd still have He'd still have everything he did have. It was them that were going to lose it. And I say to this congregation and all that are streaming and all that will ever hear this, whatever you do, remember that this message is none other than Jesus Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; The message and the messenger are one. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; While he is not that person, he said clearly I am not him &gt;&gt; but I have been sent to reveal him. And he's the one who said, "And I have sent you to reveal me." &gt;&gt; You're the one that's been chosen. Of six billion people, I've chosen one. &gt;&gt; I spoke poor in my language. You speak poor in your language. I came out of poverty. You came out of poverty. &gt;&gt; Our backgrounds are similar because he had to represent this one. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here I said a while ago that this was the critical spot. And here it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Mark 14, it says, "But he held his peace and answered nothing." Again, the high priest asked him and said unto him, "Art thou the Christ, the son of the beloved?" Here he's been telling them, "If you don't believe that I'm he, you're going to die in your sin. Now they've moved him right up to the judgment. &gt;&gt; Art thou the Christ, the son of the beloved. And Jesus said, "I am." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you shall see the son of man sitting in the right hand of power and coming with claw the clouds of heaven. And then the high priest, he rent his clothes and said, "What need have we of further witness? You have heard the blasphemy. What think ye?" And they all condemned him to be guilty of death. on that point. &gt;&gt; Please get that on that point. That's my whole message this morning. That's my whole service. I'm saying this is he. &gt;&gt; And if you can accept that, you're in for blessings. &gt;&gt; This is he. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel electrified by this friends. &gt;&gt; I'm saying it to you young people. I'm saying it to you girls, you boys. You may never hear it again. That this is he. And if you'll take a hold of this word and say, I'm going to give that due respect. &gt;&gt; I'm going to respect that. I'm going to follow it like I'm following Jesus Christ of Nazareth as he walked. I will uh I will do whatever I can to further his cause. Let your kingdom come, God. I am your servant, Lord Jesus. I'm here to serve you. I'm here to live. I'm here to express you and let people see you. Let people hear from you. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Closing. &gt;&gt; And when he got to that point, I am he. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Need we have further hear this blasphemy to a lot of people. That's where the message got to. That's why he said this is so hard to get separated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the point. &gt;&gt; We wear different hats. We feel different. All I can tell you friends, all I can tell you children, young people, if you haven't had the experience, you should perhaps start watching for it. &gt;&gt; There'll be a time when maybe things are kind of going sideways in your life and saying, you know what, I'm going to go to my father, but I'm not just going to his dad. I have a daughter sitting right here whose son was very weward. I shouldn't say very weward but he was weward and we were having a special speaker here in the church and she said I want him at my place. I remember the woman and the Bible had prepared a place for the man of God and I will receive this minister as the man of God because I have in my heart my son. It doesn't matter where you are. We walked out of Starbucks. It was at the same time we walked out of Starbucks. We'd been in there. We talked as a family. As we walked out, my wife walked towards your car and said, "And Joanne came right up up to me. I was standing, she was standing on the curb, and I tell you what, I don't know if I ever saw her look on her face." She says, "The woman who received a son from God, I am that woman and I am coming to the man of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. And she says, "And that woman's son died, and God gave me this son, and he has died, and I'm coming you to you now that he shall come to life." &gt;&gt; And God gave her that son &gt;&gt; the second time. That's not that's not just a personal testimony. I'm just telling you that that happened to be a reality. And if you don't believe it, just go and talk to her and ask her how happy she is or her husband how happy she is. It didn't make me any greater. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I felt very humbled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In fact is I didn't know hardly how to respond &gt;&gt; and I felt a sense of responsibility that I really didn't want. This gets too critical because immediately I thought this boy I'm I'm being put into a spot where she's coming and declaring her faith. &gt;&gt; This son must be brought back to life again. &gt;&gt; The chains of sin must be broken. &gt;&gt; I just want to say to you friends, family of God didn't make me anything greater. It gave her the benefit. [Music] &gt;&gt; Gave their family the benefit. &gt;&gt; After the prophet, will you get what he said? It doesn't make do anything for him. You're the one that benefits. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to close with something so very simple. And don't let the message lose its strength or value. Some of these things you maybe think that I'm oversimplistic or what whatever whatever you think. But anyway, I'm ending. I've noticed something in this church that has troubled me and that is when the minister gets done. There's like a mass exodus out of the church and people somehow feel free and it's it's right at the and the scripture if you understood the scripture. The scripture says, "And he confirmed the word &gt;&gt; with signs following." &gt;&gt; It's not a time for mass exodus. &gt;&gt; And here you read it yourself. Go to your own message and search it yourself. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, and he had to say in this, I'm embarrassed that he had to tell us how to dress, how to act, how to be. I'm embarrassed. We ought to know those things because they were ABCs. &gt;&gt; And now he comes to the he comes. Now listen closely. I'm just closing. He knows that in the next few moments, &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord that is right here, &gt;&gt; is going to come and start speaking through him &gt;&gt; to individuals. And he's going to maybe even be into another realm, into another world. and and and he realizes that this is such a crit, you know what he says to the people? Don't move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't move around. You think, oh, we're looking for some spectacular thing out of the heavens and he's telling people, don't move. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says you have a spirit. &gt;&gt; And it it interferes &gt;&gt; with what's happening. So don't move at that time. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what? And he says, "Be reverent." &gt;&gt; So does right at that moment. It's not a moment. And then they say, "Well, you know, to get up and I got to go to the washroom or go." Do you really need to? Is it a matter of life or death? Are we really able to hold out for another few minutes? &gt;&gt; So, well, my baby's squirming. Well, get something so it doesn't squirm if you possibly can. entertain it a little bit more. If you can't and it's fussing, well, absolutely step out. But right at the time when a minister is done, what I'm calling on you all to say is I recognize God in this message. &gt;&gt; And now this is the time I give my utter undivided reverence &gt;&gt; from the youngest to the eldest who say, "God, what is it that you want to do just now? Whatever it is you want to do, I'm blending. I'm giving my effort. I'm giving my I give myself freely and completely. Oh God, now come in your divine will and perfect will and accomplish it in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm done. We'll bow our heads in prayer, please. Father, please accept our thanksgiving this morning. I want to take time to give you praise, give you glory and thanksgiving. Where would I be? Where would we be had you not sent this message and this messenger? and he was so faithful to it. Thank you for that faithfulness. Thank you for that uncompromising Holy Spirit that so motivated him and moved him into the realms of the supernatural. And you spoke things, oh God, that were so godly. You spoke things that were so eternal and such a such a uh such a height and a a level of blessing. Father, thank you. I pray that you receive our thanksgiving. receive, oh God, the reverence of the people, the acknowledgment that they have had and how they've helped your your poor servant this morning to utter the things that have been on my heart, oh God. And I pray, Lord, that you'll move them. This is not to be just another service. This is not just another Sunday morning, but this is a time when I pray, oh God, they will take these things and put them in their script bag and say, "These are things that I will not forget. These are things, oh God, by the Holy Spirit, plant them deep in my heart, bring them to my remembrance. Cause me to think about them. Cause me to meditate upon them. Cause me to make these as as a a foundation in our home as a character of our home. Help me, Lord, to be the kind of example that I will raise and rear my children in. And give them an example of honor and respect. Give them an honor, oh God. Give them a an example, Father, of what it is to come to the house of God. Oh, Father, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. How we long for that kingdom of righteousness and that kingdom of bliss, Father, where where everything is as balanced as it should be and everything's in harmony. Oh God, I pray you'll bless the bride of Jesus Christ wherever she is gathered, wherever in purity of heart and soul. Oh God, they're embracing this word. Father, I pray that you will help us now in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory. We thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing. You could stand with me if you would change your position. Thank you for being so kind during this long service. I would like to sing. We place you in the highest place. It's 269. [Music] Praise you in the highest place. For you are the great high priest. We praise you high above all. [Music] And we come to you and worship. [Music] We praise you in the highest place for you on the great high. We praise you. [Music] all [Music] and we come to you to worship and [Music] going to close in a few moments. I was struck by an encounter brother Brandham had by a man the other day a precious soul here in the city seen another brother and he said where's Bill at? He said he's going up in Canada. He said, "I guess he's going to hunting." He said, the brother said, "Yes, he's going hunting." He said, "Ah, nonsense to such stuff." [Music] He said, "All right." The man not knowing that I was under the power of the Holy Spirit by a vision of thus sayeth the Lord to go. You folks don't know what this &gt;&gt; really means to me. Do you know why &gt;&gt; I was up there? &gt;&gt; Do you know why Bud Southwick was up there? &gt;&gt; Do you know why his wife Laya was up there? At least and a few other souls. And this man, even the first word, where's Bill at? I think it would have been better. Say, where's brother Brandham at? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said those children that went out, he said their parents should have told them. &gt;&gt; When you see him now, we don't understand, you know, all this business about Elijah going up and all this. We don't understand that. But if you see him, you say, "How do you do, Reverend? Even though you don't understand it, you say, "How do you do, Reverend? How do you do, sir?" And go on your way and don't say anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was their instruction. &gt;&gt; Congregation, are you hearing me? [Music] If you can take this service into your heart and soul &gt;&gt; and say I am going to make that as part of a important fabric of my life, &gt;&gt; you'll find your life start to be benefited. &gt;&gt; Where's Bill at? And I want to apologize. I said at the last Sunday, don't call me brother Ed. Well, of course, call me brother Ed. I understand that. I sign all my letters and emails. Brother Ed, you understand? I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about him. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about he who is the message because I have I believe I do have a revelation that this word is none other than the living person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I approach it. I read it. I weep over it. Ears come to my eyes. Tears come to my eyes often because I engage with the person. Oh God, it's so wonderful that you would do that. &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful that you would say that. &gt;&gt; And if you feel quickened at all when I come to the pulpit or and these other men of God come to the pulpit, that's why &gt;&gt; because we had some engagement with him. To me, it's not a book. &gt;&gt; It's not just a book. I carry it around with me. &gt;&gt; Whatever I'm studying, I carry it with me because I'm having a relationship. I want &gt;&gt; that person with me. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he said, "All right." The man not knowing, do you know when he said, "Where's Bill at?" He was signing his death warrant. &gt;&gt; You don't believe that? Just listen. He said he was under the power of the Holy Spirit. He said, "What will it do? What will you do at the day of judgment?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "What good would it do for me to go to the bedside of that man and pray for him the first place? He doesn't believe me." and people when they come around. Now he said when they come around and say these things he said I don't know like I don't know that they don't believe it. He said so they pat you on the back and call you brother and you know they don't believe it and they don't believe it. He said, "Not, listen to me, not one thing you can do for them. &gt;&gt; They'll call for you to come pray and it doesn't do them any good &gt;&gt; because they disrespect it." &gt;&gt; The man when he opened his mouth, he had disrespect already. Where's Bill at? [Music] You see what I'm bringing? &gt;&gt; You say I I'm not bringing anything to try to gain any honor with the people. Far be it. Please don't say I'm even apologizing. I'm I'm brother Ed, too. It's part of myself personally. And he was brother Bill. Sister Brandon came to me and she said, "You know that picture you took of Bill?" said, "Well, Billy Paul got it, and I would like to know if you'd make me another copy." I didn't I didn't take that she was disrespecting him. She called him Bill. He called him Bill. It wasn't the same Bill. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the same way. &gt;&gt; When you come to your father or your friend or whoever they are, make sure that you feel in your heart, "This is my friend. &gt;&gt; This is a brother. This is a sister." I shake my hand. I'm a privileged person. Jesus hung on the cross and shed his blood that I could shake hand with this person. &gt;&gt; Friends, if you can get what is I'm preaching today, it'll change change your life. You'll be the beneficiary. Not me, not someone else. You'll be the beneficiary. &gt;&gt; You can say, look up and say, God, I heard your word. I received it as from you &gt;&gt; and I'm here to live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I place you in the highest place. God bless you. Thank you &gt;&gt; for your kindness today. &gt;&gt; I place you in the highest place. Once again, we place you in the highest place. for you on the great high. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are Lord. We praise you high above all else. [Music] And we are you and at your feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to have you join with me now and we'll just be one or two minutes. We're going to close.
