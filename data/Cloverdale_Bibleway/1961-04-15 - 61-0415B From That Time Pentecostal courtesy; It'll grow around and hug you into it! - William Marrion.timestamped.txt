[0:00] notice another thing I just like to say
[0:02] amongst Pentecostal people there's one
[0:05] thing that we're forgetting friends is
[0:06] our Pentecostal courtesy see parking in
[0:11] Lots sometimes I've noticed our
[0:13] Pentecostal Brethren when you could
[0:15] really pull and give somebody else a
[0:17] chance to park for the side of you just
[0:19] drive in any way call somebody that
[0:21] really makes a what we call a boo boo on
[0:23] the road you fly loose and tear down
[0:26] listen that's not the way of be a
[0:28] Pentecostal Christian
[0:31] let's consider the next one if he's
[0:32] wrong let him be wrong if you patter
[0:35] aing then you're wrong let's think of
[0:38] the other and just try to do right and
[0:41] think right I've got a slogan do right
[0:45] it's your duty to God think right that's
[0:47] your duty to yourself and you've got to
[0:48] come out right and if you'll try to
[0:51] practice the right thing see it'll grow
[0:54] around you just like a Vine it'll hug
[0:56] you into it and if you can't love your
[0:59] enemy just as much as you love those who
[1:02] love you there's something wrong
[1:04] somewhere
