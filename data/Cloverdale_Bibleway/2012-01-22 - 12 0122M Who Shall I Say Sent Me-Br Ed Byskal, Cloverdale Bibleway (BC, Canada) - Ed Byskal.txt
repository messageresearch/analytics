We're going to sing I bless your name. I bless your name. Just before we do, I have a testimony. It's an update to the prayer request last week for the believers in Romania. We prayed for a 17-year-old daughter of our sister Lydia in a life and death situation. She has come out of her coma. Before the accident, she could speak three different languages and she is speaking in all three. The doctors and nurses can't believe what they are seeing. Before she came out of her coma, they had removed all the life support. Amen. Praise our God. He's a miracle working God. Hallelujah. Amen. I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name.

And then he said, "In Jesus' name, house of hell give way." &gt;&gt; I think we can sing that second verse with a little more revelation. And they will fall in Jesus' name. &gt;&gt; There's many needs here this morning. And it doesn't matter what they are. There's no reason for us to leave this building this morning with the same needs, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that again. Let's remember in Jesus' name. In the strong name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Some midnight hour. Some midnight hour. Oh, if you should find that you're in your Oh my god. I bless your name. Hallelujah. I bless your name.

Oh, I believe that you're my portion. And I believe you're more than enough for me. Oh Jesus, you're all I need. Hallelujah. Amen. As we prepare to go to prayer, let's sing it's already done. It's already done. We do have a number of prayer requests this morning. I want to continue to remember sister Lydia's family in Romania. Her brother Tobias Wolf is still in Tibet intensive care. He and his family attend brother Garrett's church in Germany and there was a fear that he could lose his legs. We just want to continue to remember this family. God's done a wonderful work already. It's a desire that God will continue to move on their behalf. Request from our brother Scotty Weber. Please pray for my brother Leo. He just underwent spinal surgery and is in a lot of pain. Please pray that the Lord will move in his life and show his power to him. Amen. Also a prayer request for our brother Louise. He is at home and not well in body. And we want to remember the family uh the mother of our sister, brother Jean Canandanda and sister Biami Monga just passed away last Monday in the Congo. She was asking that God would be with the family during this time. Amen. There's many needs, but it's already done. Just grant that God would give us a revelation of that this morning. Hallelujah. Oh, it's already done. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, it's already done. I believe that the battle is over. The victory is already done. This morning is already done. It's already done. It's already done.

We want to welcome all those who are here this morning. Any visitors with us? Just want to say God bless you. Glad you're able to be here with us this morning. Amen. Why don't we sing Lord lift me up and let me stand higher ground. Sister Sharon's going to come. Sister Sharon Gidd is going to come sing for us. Amen. I just I love these old hymns. My heart has no desire to stay. Hallelujah. Let's start with the first verse. We'll sing a couple verses before Sister Sharon sings for us. I'm pressing on the upward way to height every day. Still praying as I'm onward. Lord, plant my feet on higher. That's your desire. Lord, lift me up. Lord, lift me up and let me stand my faith on hand. Why than I have found my feet on higher my heart with my heart has no desire to stay where doubts arise and fears dismay. and know someday well. Oh my god. Lord, let's sing the course again. Lift me up. Lord, lift me up. me. Let me stand my faith on it's a higher place than I have. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. I've walked through some valleys. I went as low as I could get. I've climbed some steep mountains. But he has not failed me yet. And I know that whatever comes my way, he'll be standing right beside me. Cuz he has already promised that he will never leave me. He'll be there right beside me. Through the wind and storm, he'll be there right beside me. When I'm cold and torn, I'll cast all my burdens, all my cares on him. He'll be there right beside me as he's always been. I've been through some dark trials and through some fiery tests, but he has always stood beside me when everybody else left. If he can do it for me, I know he can do it for you. He'll be there right beside you and he'll never leave. He'll be there right beside you through the wind and storm. He'll be there right beside you. When you're cold and torn, just cast all your burdens, all your cares on him. He'll be there right beside you as he's always been. He'll be there right beside you. through the winter and storm. He'll be there right beside you. When you're cold and tall, just cast all your burdens, all your cares on him. He'll be there right beside you as he's always been. Just cast all your burdens, all your cares on him. He'll be there right beside you as he's always been. He'll be there right beside you. as he's always there. And thank you, Sister Sharon. Appreciate that. Appreciate the gift of songwriting in our body. Amen. God bless you for that. And why don't we invite our pastor? Let's sing. My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine. We're going to turn to the word without any more delay. I'm certainly looking forward to what the Lord's laid on our pastor's heart this morning. Amen. My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine. for the all of our sire. Oh my gracious redeemer. Oh my savior. and is my love. My Jesus is now. Oh, I love thee because thou has mer and purchase my heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I love thee. Happy Jesus. Inventions of glory. Oh man of glory and bless. This is the ever Heat. Heat. Heat. My love, my Jesus is now. &gt;&gt; And I'll have you stand as we are going to sing the first verse of that song again. You talk about the mind of Christ and Sister Sharon singing that he would be there with us always, not only in the storm, but even while we worship. &gt;&gt; I believe he's here to receive our worship. &gt;&gt; And so yesterday, I thought while I was studying, I want to sing with a congregation. It is well with my soul. And then I just service just starts and here brother Ryan is singing it is well with my soul. And then while I'm in the study I just was on my knees and just worshiping with you and singing it is well with my soul and I thought well I want to sing my Jesus I love thee. So so I sang that in the study and I I come out to the song. So we have the mind of Christ. Hallelujah. And not only that, I have a quote and you've heard it many times before. The prophet said that the bride has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word. And so we're trusting for that part now as well. &gt;&gt; You believe we have the mind of Christ? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. All right, let's just sing this first verse again. My Jesus I love thee. My thyior and I love thee. My Jesus is. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we do love him dearly. Just before we turn to the word, I want to ask the congregation and those that are on the internet as well part of the what's going on here this morning. We uh brother John Andes will be leaving tomorrow for Australia and be having meetings in Perth and also in Melbourne. And I just really feel that it's God's uh God has opened the doors and God is in this. And so let's just pray. We don't know what all God wants to do, but let's just pray that God will uh supernaturally &gt;&gt; visit the people and the meetings and the young people and whatever more. And he will be also with brother Queasy. Uh and that is uh really wonderful. I'm happy about that. So we want to be remembering our brother John. Also, uh our brother Jean uh Chimpaka had to leave yesterday to go back to uh Ghana, back to Africa, not to Ghana, but he's going to be in Chad for some some time. And brother Timothy on Tokco also had to return and they're both on route. Um so let's pray for these brothers. the families are here and they would dearly love to be here. &gt;&gt; And so let's pray for them as as let let's pray that God will make a way because what they're striving to do is to be able to be here with their families. And so we just want to pray that God will arrange that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you happy? &gt;&gt; Good. Good. That's good. Amen. Well, I'll have you turn in your Bibles. Thank you musicians. And we'll turn to the book of Exodus, please. Uh the third chapter, and we'll begin reading at the first verse. I want you to be thinking about this this year that we've just uh entered into. This is January 2012. In not not too very long. Just a maybe 3 4 months down the road or so. We will have been here 40 years as our 40th anniversary this year. starting from the old Bible way house and here we are. Who would ever thought it? &gt;&gt; And if time should go on, uh, who knows what God has in his mind? I'll tell you, we're not here, and this will certainly be in harmony with my message this morning. We're not here by accident. &gt;&gt; You're not here by accident. &gt;&gt; I don't care what age you are, young or old. We're not here by accident. &gt;&gt; We're here by design. Last Sunday we had our brother Francisco here and speaking and perhaps you know he I know it's always a uh uh it's hard to get everything that's on a person's heart when they're speaking through a translator as he had to last Sunday. But uh in in speaking privately with him, you know, he just he said, "Why don't you think about, you know, Latin America?" And and and we having a meeting this spring, could you come down? I said, "No, I wouldn't be able to." But he said, "Well, then next year, the following year, 2013." you know, whatever whatever the Lord has in mind, you know, but uh he just was asking myself and I I just feel him because he's asking the congregation, why don't we think more about the the Mexico and Central America and South America and and I told him in all sincerity, I said, I've always left that to the people in Arizona and down in Texas and those, you know, I've just left I I thought there's other places in the world, but he just had uh such a sincerity and you know looking into my face and why don't you think about Latin America and I uh I had to think about my geography for a moment. I said what part of that now is is that Central America, Latin America? And so uh we've got quite a few of you here. So I think you ought to be praying. I thought of you, brother Ron Caldwell. I know you've always had a burden for brother Louise. It's had such a burden for the for South America and we have them here from El Salvador. Uh we have good reason to think about it. &gt;&gt; You've all got loved ones and you have family and you have whatever more country of your heritage and you know sometimes there's something special about that part. So let's think about it. Let's pray about it. And I don't know, brother Francisco. I never met him before officially. He said he was in a meeting when I and brother Jared Smith were down in Mexico City. He said he was there and he was in another meeting, I believe. So uh he was acquainted and I think he's been on quite a few of the meeting streaming but uh I just got a email uh through actually I think as a result of brother Mark Aaho's connection with him and they had had some communication. Brother Ron Caldwell had been in a had met him someplace down there. And so I just put all of this together and I say you know what is it Lord? Is it is it something that you have for us as a congregation to participate in his ministry or that part of the world or his burden for that part of the world? And so would you remember that in prayer &gt;&gt; when it comes your way when it comes across your thoughts just bow take a moment take a little time and pray and say God what is your will for us as a church as a congregation? Amen. And then I was thinking 40 years ago we were you know eight or 10 people in a house. Uh I never had any any thought whatsoever. In fact is my thought was perhaps some of the young people you know will give their hearts to Christ and you know get into some church or something cuz the last thing in the world I expected to ever you know pastor work. I wanted to just do evangelistic work and that kind of thing, but always had missions on my heart. Always had missions and still do. Amen. And that's what the ministry of Jesus Christ is. Is we say missions, it's not in the Bible. Preach the gospel &gt;&gt; to every creature &gt;&gt; that's your neighbor and one across the sea or in Latin America or wherever they are. Hallelujah. And if God puts it in our hands and makes it possible for us, then we do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer before we read. Father, we've opened your word. Now, these things have been written and inspired by the the Holy Spirit. And now only the Holy Spirit can cause us to know what is to be spoken. So I pray, Father, you will you'll be the one that will speak the word. That would be my voice, oh God. Let it be the Holy Ghost. Father, we need the spirit of God. We don't need just a Sunday morning service, but we want to hear from you. We want instruction from you. We want correction from you. We want your perfect will. And we say, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And &gt;&gt; Lord, we surrender ourselves now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll begin reading Exodus 3:1. Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. And he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, "I will now turn aside and see the this great sight why the bush is not burnt." And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am I." And he said, "Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground." Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. And the Lord said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their task masters. For I know their sorrows, and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of their out of that land unto a good land, and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. And therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me, and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now, therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt. And Moses said unto God, "Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" And he said, "Certainly I will be with thee, and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee, when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this mountain." And Moses said unto God, "Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, the God of our fathers hath sent me unto you." And they shall say unto me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I am that I am. And he said, "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I am hath sent me unto you." And God said, "Moreover, unto Moses, thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say unto them, "The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt." God bless you as you have your seats. I'll ask for your kind attention and seek not to be distracted if possible. I know that when the prophet of God gathered the people together, especially when the angel of the Lord was coming near and he would ask the people because he said every human has a spirit. And so that I know has a big application. And I'm not a prophet. We're but we are sons of this word. And so we have the same principles. The Bible is full of principles. And what I will speak on today, I I want to seek to present to you some principles that are very very important in my in my mind. I want to uh speak to you and I want to put this title in your mind. Who shall I say sent me? I want you to think about that. Who shall I say sent me? What is his name? And what shall I say unto them? You know, I thought each one of us actually have had a Moses experience someplace. You're here, at least most of you, if not all of you are here because at some point in your life, you met God. You had a meeting. You had something happen to you that turned you around. In some cases, your life was turned upside down. In others it was probably not as dramatic. Those are born into Christian homes into believing homes. You kind of grew up with the knowledge of it and you knew what was right and you knew what was wrong etc. But then came a special moment. Then came a special meeting and you met God. something dramatic happened and and then you you know uh you begin to express it and you begin to show it to others and and uh well I had this kind of experience I I met God and uh who shall I who shall I say sent me because you've been sent to somebody that's where I'm going you've been sent to somebody and and then people you find they don't understand it &gt;&gt; and then it's it's it's really uh you know it puts a person into a bit of a kind of a quandry. They don't understand. And Moses perceived that that was going to happen. Who I say sent me? H how how what what what's your name? Uh they'll ask me what his name is. And he was trying to bring into focus here. He's talking to a voice coming out of a burning bush and he knows it's the God of the fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. How's he going to convey that to the people? And friends, uh, as the bride of Jesus Christ, I want to separate in your mind today also the difference between that kind of a meeting with God and and and and tradition. Uh, and I'm I'm going to be bringing it right home to message tradition. We're not here as a matter of tradition. &gt;&gt; Uh, now we we could say, well, it's tradition. I always Sunday morning always go to church. And Sunday morning, you get up, you start getting ready for church because we always go to church. We're not here because we go to church Sunday morning. We're here because, and it has to be, we have to separate it from that. And we're here because we want to hear. We anticipate to hear from God. We're here because we want to worship. It's in our heart. We want to we want to register once again our love and our devotion, our surrender to this living God. We're not here because we go to church on Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; Moses. So as I go through the things that Moses experienced, you will have experienced or may be experiencing these. Once we have met God face to face uh our whole life in every part is changed. In the message thirsting for life, brother Brandham says how did this great pillar of fire the angel of God the logos that went out of God. So pillar of fire the logos the angel of God that led the children of Israel through the wilderness. when it come among the people, it separated itself and great licks of fire begin to come upon each one. Speaking now on the day of Pentecost. So it goes right from the burning bush to the day of Pentecost. And each one as the pillar of fire begin to break up. God dividing himself among his people. God tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit with each one of us. Not them. usmen, &gt;&gt; that same one. So, he's gone right from the logos that went out of the bosom of God, brought it right down to the burning bush, brought it over to Pentecost, and brought it right down to here. &gt;&gt; Same one, God tearing himself apart so we each one &gt;&gt; could have a part. And Wyatt had to be shepherd said, "No man has a right to enter the sacred desk where I stand today." uh until he has done as Moses did, meet God himself upon grounds where there's no theologian can explain it away. &gt;&gt; And I can say there's no friend that can explain it away. There's no relative that can explain it away. There's no relationship on earth that can explain it away. &gt;&gt; You can't forget a revelation. You can forget being taught. say, "Well, I can't remember that." Uh, you might remember, you might forget being convinced by somebody or being talked into something, but you will never forget a revelation because it actually becomes a part of your being. &gt;&gt; And it's as real today as it was 10 years ago, one year ago, 50 years ago, or however long. It it doesn't get old. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Moses perhaps now considered himself a shepherd, married, one or two children, and his life had been really turned around. Follow me and let's follow him. And the scripture says in Acts 7:22, "And Moses was learned in all all the wisdom of Egypt, the superpower of the earth, in all the wisdom of e of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and deeds." Brother Brandham speaks about the film of the ten commandments and it brings this kind of home. Oh, he was a mighty man. He was a man of victory and war and had great power and the next pharaoh coming up and and it was just an incredible place that God allowed him to rise to and now in an effort to express something. The Bible says he he he looked upon his brethren something was burning something was stirring. What was there was his call. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he he couldn't understand that of course. And brother Brandham said he looked out the same window that Pharaoh looked out. And when Pharaoh looked out, he saw slaves and mudbers. &gt;&gt; And when Moses looked out, he saw the elect of God. &gt;&gt; So what was inside of him uh caused him to see things differently than the rest of the people. What's inside of you causes you to see things in the world differently than anyone else. And you can't explain it always because it's it's something divine within you and you see the world differently. And so Moses in in that that that burden that uh that call that was within him. He he thought they would understand when a man as great as he was was going to try to uh deliver and he saw one of the task masters or an Egyptian uh uh dealing with a a Hebrew and he went and slew him &gt;&gt; and hit him in the sand. Isn't it amazing that when you try to do something for God, it can go just backwards &gt;&gt; or in your mind it's backwards. &gt;&gt; In your mind, he went full speed in reverse. from the great great palaces and beautiful carpets of of that era and that time and the wisdom as brother Brandham says they had wisdom to to prepare a body uh and and to to you know to have a body prepared so that they remain to this day. uh they you know such wisdom and such such a great nation and wisdom that we don't even have yet today. And and here he is he he's learned in all the wisdom of Egypt and now he's out there hurting sheep. Now that's full cycle. &gt;&gt; I mean he's really gone full cycle in reverse really. So now he sees himself as a shepherd. He's living with his father-in-law and the other relatives and married to this girl and got a child or two and he's in a desert. I don't think there's a single believer here listening to me today. But what I should convey to you as believers, we have wilderness experiences. As believers, we have things that happen that appear to be completely in reverse of what we expected &gt;&gt; or should expect. Here we have a message and here we have a uh the greatest ministry that is we've embraced it, but yet things in life seem to go in reverse for us. But we need a wilderness. We do need a wilderness experience. A man learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. And I want you to uh as I'm preparing to bring the service to you, I want you to think about what was going through Moses' mind as he turned as he turned things around in his mind. I tell you what, he had a lot to think about. I I lived in all its glory. I lived in with all his power. My word was law. Uh, I I I went and fought armies. I had armies under me and I had great victories and all of this great Egyptian kingdom was essentially in my hands just a short time ago. And now here I am with the shape. And who am I? Nobody. My name Moses. Moses. Moses. Now I'm out here. All I hear is the wind and the sand and blowing in my eyes. And that's I'm talking about reality. I'm talking about real things. I'm talking about real life. I had the riches of the earth in my hands and now I'm just trying to ek out a living. I'm out here hurting sheep for some food. Your quietness almost ma makes me think that you've been there in manifesting his gifts. He like you perhaps have thought I'm a total failure. Once when I got feeling about as small as a person could feel was when brother Brandham was and I were sitting on the mountain side and he and it was just after just after months after he'd had beyond the curtain of time and he put his and here I am you know 27 years old and just kind of seeing what the future might be in the ministry and he puts his hand behind his head like go. And he said, "Well, William Brandham, if you're Bill Brandham," he said, "If you're going to do anything for God, you better get up and get going." And I just I thought, "Here's a man perhaps getting hundreds of thousands of letters every month and speaking to tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of people. And to have him feel, if you're going to do anything for God, you better get up and get going." I just naturally thought what hope do I have &gt;&gt; in view of this kind of a statement you know but each one each one has a part when Jesus saw them throwing their money into the treasury and the woman came in and just put her in her just pennies as it were and Jesus didn't say now relatively speaking he didn't say that he said she hath put in more than they all. &gt;&gt; So her little part was more than everyone else. So we have to see things through God's uh God's way of looking at it. He said, "How is it in the days of Moses the prophet, how that Moses was born a servant of the Lord and was raised up in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, he was a polished scholar. And when he had mastered all the wisdom and the learning of the Egyptians, it seems like he had been in the wonderful condition to deliver his people. For he was the commanding general in all of Egypt. He was an heir to the throne. And every right of education that a man could receive, Moses had it. But God could not use one of those qualities. And we find him taking his servant Moses to the backside of the desert to herd his father-in-law Jethro's shape. So, brother Benham describes really what he had come to, but he couldn't use one of those qualities. So what went in on what went on in the inside of of Moses uh and and what had happened to him? It it must have been a very trying time for him. And out of this burden for his soul, out of the burden of his soul, watch this closely now. out of the burden of his soul. In other words, it was God literally driving him because he felt that he was called to deliver these people and he does something with his human strength and ends up in the wilderness. So, I think I'm making my point. Moses looking out the same window that Pharaoh did, which I quoted a moment ago, upon the same people Pharaoh called them mudbers. That's all. They were just a bunch of slaves. But by faith, that's why I like to read the quote. But by faith, Moses saw them to be the promised people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when Moses was grown, the scripture says that he went out unto his brethren and looked upon their burden and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his brethren and he went and slew that man where he he went to to protect his uh deliver his Hebrew brother from it. And that was what was so misunderstood. There comes a time when the purpose of God in your life and my life, it comes a time when that purpose of God takes precedent and control over all of what we perhaps have been educated. There's nothing wrong with education. But there has to come a time when that which is inside of you takes precedent over that and controls that. You might be a very gifted person. Uh uh when I look at the bride of Jesus Christ, we see them all the way from you know people who labor with their hands, people who labor with their minds. It's it's that's irrelevant. People who have good retention of mind or people who don't can't remember hardly what their name is. That's irrelevant. God can use one as equally as much as the other one. It's it's what's surrendered to God. But there has to come a time when all of that the the the purpose of God inside takes precedent over that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to dwell on that in a few moments. And the call of God in our lives doesn't only take precedent, but it takes precedent over all the world can offer you. Because the world, I tell you what, there's qualities that the believer has that the world hasn't got and never will attain to. &gt;&gt; There are qualities that you have. Listen to me, friends. There are qualities that you have the world will never have. &gt;&gt; They can't have it because it comes from God. But the world would like to use it. The world would like to use your level of dedication and your level of honesty and your level of integrity. It just isn't available in the world. When Moses risked his life to do God's will, when he risked his life to do God's will, being driven by his vision, his conviction, his he knew that these were his brethren and he knew the situation was not correct and he was going to correct it. He was going to do it but and he risked his life for it. That's when it turned upside down. Even when he risked his life and he ended up in the wilderness. Born again believers all experience, they all experience a wilderness where they discover that God doesn't need their human talents. God doesn't need all the things that perhaps we think are so great. But what we need is a supernatural God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't need all of the other things. That doesn't say that we disregard them. No, we don't disregard them. God didn't God didn't take all the learning of Apostle Paul. He just arranged it. He rearranged it. He was still Apostle Paul. Peter was still uh presumptuous Peter, but God used those qualities in them. He didn't take them out from them. And then the scripture says, "Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, and thou that thou mayest bring forth my people, the children of e Israel, out of Egypt. Come now, therefore, and I will send." Being sent. Now, I want to We're going to start focusing down. Now being sent is not being contracted or being retained. We retain lawyers and retain certain people. Uh being sent isn't somebody that just collects a fee. Being sent isn't being hired. Being sent there's something already within the person that is that has put them in this position. I will send you. &gt;&gt; He didn't feel sent hurting sheep, but he said, I'm going to send you and you're going to do this. You're going to bring out my people. So, a person could be experienced all of these things, but the Bible says this that we are workers or we are laborers together. We are workers. we have and I want to separate uh you today and I'm going to finally come to the quote I have it in two places where brother Brandham said of himself that he came to the realization he came to the place where he realized he was not the son &gt;&gt; of Charles and Ella Brham &gt;&gt; he was a son of God &gt;&gt; he was sent with a mission He was sent with a purpose. And I believe friends with everything that's in me, it is one realization you and I need to come to. &gt;&gt; We are not here just by our natural. In fact is I would say that in the in the view of God, God ordained everything. He watched over everything and and and coming on down from generation to generation to generation. But we are too attached to our natural heritage. We're too attached to our natural qualities or weaknesses. We're too attached to them. We need to be separated from them. And the thing that should dominate our minds is, I've been sent here by almighty God. I was sent here by design. God ordained that I would hear a certain truth that would turn my life around and perhaps move me physically from one place to another and perhaps take me from the heights to the depths or from the depths to the heights. That's all irrelevant. But once I surrendered my life to God, I became a son of God. I became a daughter of God. And that's what I am. &gt;&gt; That's what I am. By the grace of God, I'm a daughter of God. You women want to say that today. I'm not just preaching. I'm instructing you. I'm a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I wonder if the men would say that. I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; Will the daughters please say I'm a daughter of God? &gt;&gt; And that's why I came. &gt;&gt; I came here with a special design. Moses came to to meet the burning bush. &gt;&gt; He didn't come just to be saved by Pharaoh's daughter. &gt;&gt; That only set the, you know, the paradox. &gt;&gt; Almost unbelievable yet true. &gt;&gt; It was necessary that the crocodiles wouldn't get him. &gt;&gt; It was necessary that his mother and father saw him as a fair child and put him in a basket. It was necessary that Pharaoh's daughter find him. It was necessary that he be learned in all the wisdom of Egypt. Why? So he could forget it. &gt;&gt; That was part of that was part of the quality of God. So he could forget it. &gt;&gt; Some of you have turned down maybe being, you know, with your family. Some of you perhaps turned down uh prosperity or you turned down a better life or you turned down who knows what you turned down. And it's not always that way. &gt;&gt; God can put great things in a person's hand, but it is only to be a tool for him for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And I see you young men and young ladies here who you do not you do not know your future. And I certainly don't know your future and your parents don't know your future. But you need some principles. If anybody needed principles in their life, it's you young people. &gt;&gt; You needed principles. You really need to listen and hear, brother Biscll this morning. You need principles in your life? &gt;&gt; Because you're the ones that's going to face should I or shouldn't I? &gt;&gt; Do I go this way or don't I go this way? Do I take this great opportunity or don't I take it or what do I do? You need these principles. &gt;&gt; I don't need them so much. You need them. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching for you. I'm not preaching for my own good. I'm preaching for you. Preaching for the families &gt;&gt; of this congregation and whoever may hear this. We need the principles of the scripture &gt;&gt; and they are here &gt;&gt; and to send. He says, "I will send you." And that's send in the Hebrew. I will to send one. But it's also to stretch out to stretch out as God says concerning I will stretch out my hand. It was amazing because God says I will stretch out my hand over Egypt. And then he said to Moses, you stretch out your hand. That's how God stretched out his hand. God. If God has ever stretched out his hand to a generation, it was in this hour. &gt;&gt; And I found it really, you know, almost uh peculiar that the first thing the prophet of God did, he said, "You'll have two signs like Moses." And he started taking people by the hand. And I, it all came back to me. I sat there and I saw the prophet stretch out his hand. That was God stretching out his hand to this generation. And now his hand is not here, but yours is here. &gt;&gt; You stretched out your hand and gave out a track. You stretched out your hand and gave out a book. You stretched out your hand and shook someone's hand. It's God stretching out his hand. You might think that is humorous, but it's not. It's very real. It's God stretching out his hand in your life &gt;&gt; to this lost generation. &gt;&gt; A light shining through you to in a very dark place. &gt;&gt; God stretching out his hand. &gt;&gt; I trust it's doing something for you. And the scripture says Jesus saying, "Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send laborers as workers into the not just preachers but workers. When when someone is sent from God, they definitely have a purpose. &gt;&gt; I want to impress this congregation. I want to impress the young people. You are here with a purpose. &gt;&gt; I wish someone had told me that when I was 10, 12 years old. &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, you have a purpose. &gt;&gt; Are you young fellas listening to me? You have a purpose. Your parents don't know what it is. You don't know what it is. The preacher doesn't know what it is. But you have a purpose. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to make a separation. Your purpose here is not just to live a tr, you know, a traditional Christian life. Your purpose here is to understand God sent me here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's your purpose. That's where you start. God sent me here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. How are you up in the balcony? You're getting it. Glory to God. God sent me here. &gt;&gt; You are what you are. You're doing what you're doing because God wants you there for his purpose, &gt;&gt; not for the purpose of your employer &gt;&gt; or the purpose of of someone else or the purpose of your family. We're we're there to, you know, serve the people, but that's not our purpose. We're here with a divine purpose. And I that could become as a reality. And I pray that the Holy Ghost makes that a reality within you. I'm here because God sent me here. I'm not here because mom and dad decide to have another child. I'm not here because I'm an accident. I'm not here for any other reason. I'm here because God sent me here. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your background is. There may be somebody here who says, "I don't even know who my parents are. I don't know who I've been adopted. I don't know who my mother is. I don't know who my father is, but God knows who you are. &gt;&gt; God sent you here. And you might come from the most perfect, the most understanding home and family and all the rest of it that has great uh hopes for you. And that's beside the point. That's irrelevant. It's God that's got plans for you. &gt;&gt; And I want to make you aware of God's plans today. I'll tell you what, friends. I am burning up. &gt;&gt; I couldn't hardly wait to get to this pulpit to give you this message. God sent you here. &gt;&gt; This bride is here with a mission. &gt;&gt; And the things that have happened in your life, God's not God's not unaware of it. God knows every detail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he can use the most catastrophic thing. He can use the death of someone in your family. And I know there are some here lost your loved ones and you lost your you lost your partners. God understands all of that. God can understand and he not only that he has a plan and he can take he can take the things that the most reversal what more reverse could you think of than the palaces of the super country and to be a shepherd &gt;&gt; I don't think any presidents of the United States went from the presidency to be a shepherd &gt;&gt; but here we have a here here we have the pharaoh of the Egyptian country and sometimes we are inclined to think you know I've been a failure I don't want anybody to think of that. I want you to think first, I'm a son of God. And if I'm a failure, I'll let my father turn it around. &gt;&gt; I'll let my father instruct me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll let my father show me the way. &gt;&gt; I'm going to put my heart in the right place so he can do whatever he wants to do. Oh my Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine. For thee all the follyies of sin I resign. My gracious redeemer, my savior art thou. If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the attitude. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; He said, "And God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him." said, "God has put us here on earth." I want you to absorb this. I want you to put me in there. God has sent me here on earth for a reason. &gt;&gt; And that reason that he has put me here for, we are responsible to him for that reason. &gt;&gt; You should go to him and find out what he wants you to do. And I think perhaps there's a number in the congregation. You're sitting there today. You need to ask him, "Father, I've heard today from the man of God that preached the word of God that I'm here for a divine purpose, and now I ask you, what would you have me to do?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You should find out what he wants you to do. He said, "If you're working for a man, you find out what your duty is." And then if our life on this earth here, he said, "And then if our life is on this earth, the earth here, then we should go to the one who put us here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Young people, it's not necessarily going to your parents. You honor your mother and your father. That's what this word says. But the one you need to go to is your heavenly parent. Father, what would you have me to do? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And listen, he doesn't talk about great people. He says, "What must I do? Why I why am I here?" If it's to be a housewife, that's number one that he talks about. If it's to be a dishwasher, if it's to be whatever God wants you to be or to do, then he says, then you do that very best that you know how to do it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get these dishes the very cleanest I know how to get them. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's a huge amen to all of that. I'm going to be the best housewife in the world &gt;&gt; cuz I'm a daughter of God. I'm going to be the best whatever. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter how little Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter how little it is, you must do it. &gt;&gt; Thus said the prophet God. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the secret. Here's the secret. You want me to let you in on a secret? &gt;&gt; Okay. The secret's the spoken word, the original seed. &gt;&gt; At least that's where it comes from. Jesus never did anything until he seen the father or the father showed him. Wasn't Mary or Joseph or the synagogue or the archbishop that showed him. It wasn't the pastor. It wasn't the father showed him first. John 5:19. So will the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your bride. &gt;&gt; So will the bride. He shows her his word &gt;&gt; of life. &gt;&gt; He shows her. He said it again. And she receives it &gt;&gt; and she never doubts it. &gt;&gt; He shows his bride his word. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And she will receive it and she never doubts it." And he said, "Here is the secret." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a secret. The word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Some of you need to find out that secret. &gt;&gt; The word is in you. &gt;&gt; And the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. to know what he wants done with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello folks. &gt;&gt; I'm either wasting my time or you're wasting your time. But if this is true, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If this is true, the word which is which is actually Christ the being &gt;&gt; the creator &gt;&gt; who created all things is in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have to take this beyond preaching. &gt;&gt; And you have to take it beyond just hearing something. &gt;&gt; If this is just a Sunday morning service, that's tradition. &gt;&gt; And you cannot receive anything by tradition. &gt;&gt; You've got to say this is a reality. &gt;&gt; These words are absolutely true. I don't know about all the scientific things out there. I don't know all about this world. I may not understand everything about economics and politics and all the rest of it, but we have to know one thing. God, I am a son of God. I'm a daughter of God and a prophet of God. God, I do know he was sent. &gt;&gt; I don't doubt that he was sent. &gt;&gt; If he was sent, who was he sent to? He was sent to us. He was sent to me. And he was sent to say, "Here's the secret. &gt;&gt; This is the secret. &gt;&gt; The word is in you." &gt;&gt; And furthermore, you know what to do with it. &gt;&gt; You say, "What shall I do with it?" He will show you what to do with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have to believe that this morning. Exactly. &gt;&gt; I have to believe that before I could go up here and preach. &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Here's the secret." And he said something furthermore, which I know this is a reality to you. No one can persuade them different. &gt;&gt; They have thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, what wonderful realities these are. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the secret. &gt;&gt; The word is in her and she knows what to do with it and she will not doubt it. And she has thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Who else has that? &gt;&gt; Where else is it? &gt;&gt; It's not in the place that you work. &gt;&gt; It's not in the mall. &gt;&gt; You can't buy it. &gt;&gt; It's not at Walmart. &gt;&gt; It's not any place else. It's not in the school system. Thank God for the schools school building we have. &gt;&gt; We won't get into that. &gt;&gt; But I'm I this is at a different level, friends. This is at a different level. &gt;&gt; You'll only find this you talk about mysteries and so on. I'm going to give you a scripture in just a moment. In the Pergamian church age, brother Brandham also says, "Here is the secret of this." Now, it almost sounds the same. This from the original spoken word in 62 and then in the Pergamanian church age which he spoke even spoke this much earlier. He said here's the secret of this. The word is in the bride as it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; So now he brings a little different slant to it. The word is in the bride. So you say well you don't have to even imagine that. He said like it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; So she had a conception. The word was in her. &gt;&gt; Before it was a seed. It was a word because it was Isaiah, the word of God through Isaiah, thus sayeth the Lord. If we can just catch a a an understanding, a revelation of the power of that word. When a prophet of God speaks it, it's not the man speaking, his voice, but not him speaking. It's thus sayeth the Lord. And Isaiah said, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive." We don't know who the virgin was. We don't know what the circumstances. We don't know what era. We don't know what day. We don't know how old she's going to be. We don't know anything. All we know is he said it &gt;&gt; and he's a vindicated prophet and it's going to happen &gt;&gt; and we'll discover it at some point in time. It's going to happen. So now the prophet says the word is in you &gt;&gt; like it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; It's a conception. &gt;&gt; How was it in Mary? It was life in Mary. It's not just the word in you like you read a book &gt;&gt; or that you heard a tape &gt;&gt; or that you heard a heard it on disc. It's not the word is in you just like that. It's not the word is in you like you got it in in school or in your studies. That's not it. The word is in you like it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; It came to life. &gt;&gt; A supernatural life. &gt;&gt; I wonder what Mary thought. when in her short life she be to say, "See and hear." They want to make him a king. Did you hear? He multiplied the bread. He he broke the bread and he only had five loaves and and and some fishes. And he fed 5,000 people and I picked up 12 baskets afterwards. &gt;&gt; He was in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He actually was in me. I actually gave birth to this man. &gt;&gt; I gave birth to this I gave birth to this man. But this is not my life. &gt;&gt; This is something to this is something supernatural. This is something divine. &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. I'm looking down to your faces and I know from uh I know that what some of you have gone through, you'd have never been persuaded. You couldn't be persuaded away from it because it became such a reality to you. And you would never have chosen this unless God had done something so divine and supernatural within you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to bring this very very very personal to you as it was in Mary the bride. And if you can put your hand up and say, "I am a member of the bride of Jesus Christ." The bride has the mind of Christ &gt;&gt; and she knows what he wants done with the word. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, she performs the command of the word in the name for he for she has thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, those are so powerful. &gt;&gt; She has it. has his mind, has his secret, and knows what he wants done. Let me ask you, who else knows it? &gt;&gt; How many people know and have a have a word from God, have the most vindicated messenger that's perhaps ever walked and had the opening of the seals, and you have it. &gt;&gt; And other minds are totally blinded. They they don't believe it to begin with, but you have it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says, "This is the secret. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to go from this place saying, "I have a secret. I heard it this morning. I never really re realized it, but I have a secret." And the secret is his word is in me. &gt;&gt; The mysteries of God is in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The last message is in me. &gt;&gt; And the life of that word is in me. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I know what to do with it. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know way into the future, but I know what to do with it. I know the burden in my heart and if I just keep uh pressing in that direction, God's going to cause me to live a a faithful life. &gt;&gt; All I want to hear is well done. &gt;&gt; Thou good and faithful servant, enter into the joys of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't you want it? &gt;&gt; Isn't that all that we live for? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And maybe some man says, "Well, all I did was support my family." You did the word of God. &gt;&gt; A wife might say, "All I was was a mother." God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God gave you to live your life before these children as a testimony and a witness. And they and they don't have a testimony like that anywhere in the world. &gt;&gt; You are one in a million. &gt;&gt; That's not just a song, friends. That's a reality. Here's one in a billion. &gt;&gt; So John was a man sent from God to finish the work. &gt;&gt; And we can say of all the church ages, of all the times of the church Christianity being present in the world, you are here, and I'm going to identify a few things. You're here to finish the work. &gt;&gt; That last one I've seen, you know, I used to enjoy sports a great deal and and running and jumping and this kind of thing, track and field. And I'm always interested when I see I I'm I'm amazed at those that have endurance, &gt;&gt; you know, the 10,000 meter or whatever. But it's really exciting to see the relay and and and how the different teams they they save their they save their best for that last lap &gt;&gt; and they run and hand that baton to them and away that speedster goes just like an antelope. It's so thrilling to see that last one and you talk about you talk about competition. &gt;&gt; You'll get competition in that last lap. &gt;&gt; Uh it is really something wonderful. And here you are the last one. He said a man was sent from God. God would not let him be contaminated with it. You're talking about the systems. He reta he he trained him in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; He trained him in the wilderness. You think your wilderness experience, you know, don't don't fret about it. &gt;&gt; He trained him in the wilderness, not in the schools, not in the theology. John's coming was predicted in the scripture, Malachi 3. He would send his messenger before him. The prophet, the last prophet spoke of him. The last the last thing spoke of him. Remember the last book of the Old Test of the Old Testament spoke of the Elijah that would come to the children of Israel before the showing of the Messiah. But the last book of the Bible, Revelation shows us that there will be a return of him &gt;&gt; in the last days to the gentile church. The signs in Malachi 4. You're the children of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; You're the children. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, and I I'll just read this scripture if you will turn with me. It's uh uh Romans, Romans, the ninth chapter. Paul starts out by saying, "I say of the truth, in Christ I lie not. My conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. For I could wish that myself were a cursed from Christ for my brethren, my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh." And then he goes on to say, "Who are Israelites? to whom pertainth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises uh whose are who whose are the fathers of of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed forever blessed forever so he's saying that who pertainth who are Israelites to whom pertainth. Listen to me friends. This is a kind of breaking news of all the peoples of all the religious people that's in this entire area and all the multitudes of churches and the tens of thousands of people that name the name of Jesus Christ today, they wouldn't be able to tell who sent them. Who shall I say sent me? &gt;&gt; Because the God that revealed himself in this day has not made himself known to them. &gt;&gt; Moses could not say it before he was at the bush. But once he was at the bush, now something supernatural was before him. And he was amazed at the that the bush wasn't burning. And then he heard a voice. I'm the God. &gt;&gt; Now you know who he is. You couldn't you couldn't you you tried this religion you tried that you tried this you tried in your own strength to live a Christian life you tried all of these things but it wouldn't work you didn't know him but finally you met him &gt;&gt; you meet this God face to face and if you're here and I'm sure there's some that are here you're perhaps too young or you haven't met or you're too old or whatever more but you haven't had that meeting with them don't you stop &gt;&gt; till you have that meeting with him. &gt;&gt; And when you meet God face to face, you'll know who has sent you. &gt;&gt; Who shall I say sent me? The God of the prophets that sent me. The God who revealed himself in this day. To whom pertainth as he as Apostle Paul was saying to them it pertained the covenants and and the glory and all of these things pertained. But you know what happened? They turned it into a tradition. &gt;&gt; The tradition has no power. &gt;&gt; The tradition is just dead works. &gt;&gt; The tradition makes someone feel righteous. &gt;&gt; But it's not righteousness. &gt;&gt; And so they took a reality and I'm going to come to it. They took a reality. It this belongs to them. The adoption belongs to them. This reality belongs to them. &gt;&gt; The covenants, the word of God belongs to them. And the coming of Christ according to the flesh belongs to them. It's theirs. &gt;&gt; But they finally just got satisfied with, "Oh, you know what? It's Passover. Go get a lamb. We got to kill a lamb. Kill a lamb. Fix it up. The wife fixes it up. I fixed it up last year. I fixed it up the year before. My my mother fixed it up this way. My grandma fixed it up this way. And we all sit around. The kids all sit around and this is the Passover. Let the death angel pass, you know, and and dead. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; No power. &gt;&gt; And so when Jesus came, I was interested. The the word tradition doesn't appear in the Bible until the New Testament. &gt;&gt; It finally developed into tradition. And the first ones to use it was the scribes and Pharisees. &gt;&gt; And they said to Jesus, "Why do your disciples eat with unwashing hands?" Now, wasn't that terrific? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? They could take a word that came from Moses and the law of God and reduce it down to washing hands before you eat &gt;&gt; and with unwashing pots and pans. That's what their religion had been reduced to. And I can tell you that as far as Christianity is concerned, it's a it's a mockery &gt;&gt; of true Christianity. And that's why people can go to church and have all of their hilarity and all their talk in the house of God and and travel and joke and all this kind of nonsense. It's just a mockery. &gt;&gt; As I'll put it in the prophet's words, it's a stink &gt;&gt; in God's nostrils. &gt;&gt; But the bride of Jesus Christ has his secret. &gt;&gt; And that secret is his revealed word is in her. And to her, to you, I'm telling you, and I'm putting you on notice, to you pertains the revelation of Jesus Christ as prophesied by Jesus Christ in Luke 17 and 30. To you, this pertains &gt;&gt; you have this. &gt;&gt; To you pertains Malachi 4 and 6. &gt;&gt; To you pertains the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; To you pertains the resurrection. To you pertains the rapture. &gt;&gt; To you children, to you brothers, to you sisters, sons and daughters of God. To you pertains this. &gt;&gt; Don't reduce it to a tradition. &gt;&gt; It's not a tradition. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm in the message. Hello. Come on. &gt;&gt; There is no such phrase. &gt;&gt; This one is a such phrase to me. Christ is in me. &gt;&gt; This is a scripture phrase. I'm the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm the wife of the lamb. &gt;&gt; And I know what he wants done and I have his seat in me like Mary had in her. &gt;&gt; That's truth. Brother Brandham has about three or four words and they're kind of equal with one another. One is tradition, one is systems. &gt;&gt; Amen. They made a system out of it &gt;&gt; and that turned into a denomination &gt;&gt; and God hated it &gt;&gt; because it was only an image &gt;&gt; of the real. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the reality. &gt;&gt; So he has about three or four words that are all equal to tradition. I'm going to say a mouthful. We as believers of this message and I say believers of the message whoever might hear me on the internet as I have traveled and I've been in many churches with a lot of people and pastors and so on. One of the greatest dangers that believers face today is to make certain that the message doesn't become a tradition. Amen. &gt;&gt; The tradition only appears. It has the appearance &gt;&gt; of righteousness, but it's not righteous. &gt;&gt; It has the appearance of keeping the word of God, but it's not the word of God. &gt;&gt; And so, I want to tell you what tradition is. What is a tradition? Traditions are systems, denominations, Amen. &gt;&gt; A person who is keeping a tradition is an impersonator. &gt;&gt; Of the truth that did come at one time. &gt;&gt; We don't want to live on brother Brandham's reputation. &gt;&gt; We want the God of William Brham. &gt;&gt; And we must have the God of William Brham here doing things amongst the bride and through the bride. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, we're not asking for too much. This is the word of God. It's either that or I cease preaching. &gt;&gt; This is the word of God. This is the seed of eternal life. &gt;&gt; We believe in the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here's what a tradition is. Traditions or systems or denominations, impersonators are all the same category. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you have read in the message. Can I have just a little more time? Not much longer. But you have read in the message and I'm going to use some names now because brother Brandham uses them. But he would say he would speak of Oral Roberts and that bulldog faith and brother Jack Cole and those men. I lived in that era and there were great things that were taking place. great things were taking place and uh brother Brandham because of the of the sign in his hand had to have prayer lines then everybody everybody I'm not just saying the brothers that I just mentioned a couple names but everybody had to have prayer lines and brother Brandham calls it impersonating &gt;&gt; the brothers were good brothers &gt;&gt; he called them brothers and he believed it and he wouldn't say that facitiously. He said it sincerely. These are brothers. He spoke so kindly. He said, "My ministries to have the brothers unite and so on and so forth." But they began to impersonate an original &gt;&gt; ministry. And where is it today? Do you see big prayer lines? Do you see big meetings? No. It all faded away because the original passed off the scene and all impersonators because they were impersonating it. And where did it all go? Did they receive the message? Did they receive the secret? Did they receive the opening of the seal? &gt;&gt; No, they didn't because they were caught up with, you know, doing what someone else was doing because that was big big success. And so it will want to kind of follow that pattern. They don't know. I don't even know if I should say this, but over 40 years, we've had quite a number of people, quite a number of people want to come and kind of get next to what was what's going on. I see people, you know, I where where did these young ladies come from? What are these nice such they don't even know what they're attracted to? Oh, beautiful long hair and they're just ladies. They're so feminine and these young men. I had my own uncle. My own uncle says, "Where do you find young men like this? They only see the result, but they don't see what produced it. &gt;&gt; They're not hungering after the life that produced it. They want they want the you know they want what would come out of it. They want the success or they want whatever they perceive it to be. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? And that will just be reduced to nothing. That'll only be a only be a tradition. It'll only be a mimic. It'll only be a copy &gt;&gt; trying to copy. So how do you run things? Well, the first thing you run things on your knees. &gt;&gt; The first things you run your things having met the pillar of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; First thing, a bride has met him someplace somewhere along the line and trust you had more than one meeting and you heard the voice of God and you know it's God and no one can ever change you from it. &gt;&gt; She can't be convinced of anything else &gt;&gt; but it become a tradition. &gt;&gt; And so this is what a tradition is. A tradition is the transmission of knowledge, opinions. I've had people come and say to me about things in the, you know, they have developed as a result of Are you listening to me? You want to remember this? I'm I'm speaking some things are very very deep on my heart now. And young people, it'll mean something to you someday if it doesn't a whole lot this morning. But on down the road, people, you know, they set forth their opinion &gt;&gt; or their idea and I don't think you should do this and then you start feeling guilty. Well, you know, should I shouldn't I? Well, where do you get it? Well, I I think you know somewhere the prophet said something about it and when you go to it, it's not there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not there. And some of these doctrines that have fled uh you know just spread around without within the message when you get the when you get the essence of the doctrine and you take it down it was designed by a man and when you get it down and say that did brother Brandham actually say that no he didn't say that it was developed &gt;&gt; from what he said &gt;&gt; and we must not compare ourselves with others. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, they do it and they get away with it." That's how you're getting into trouble. &gt;&gt; Not because they do it, they get away with it. Well, this church does it. They allow it. &gt;&gt; Is that our standard? &gt;&gt; Is this church thus sayith the Lord to us? No. The message is thus sayith the Lord to the word of God is thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't often say, you know, that you ought to agree with that, but I say today, you should agree with that. &gt;&gt; And so, it's a transmission of knowledge or opinions and doctrines, customs, practices. You're from the colonies. I even heard you tell me that the small dots meant something and the big dots meant something. If you had small dots on your dress, that you were unmarried. If you had big dots, you were married or whatever more. The ladies from India, uh, and if you're Indian hair, it's perfectly fine. I saw hundreds of thousands of them. They got a red dot here. And then the men sometime a man would have, you know, ashes down his down his forehead. I didn't know what it meant. I went in one place supposed to be so holy, holy, holy, and they just, you know, they just on everybody that went by. I went by whatever it was didn't make any difference to me. I got some ashes on my head. I have to take it out. You have to have a bonnet. No, you have to have your head covered some way just so it you know it satisfies and then people feel okay. It's a dead worthless tradition. &gt;&gt; And the ladies used to always wear hats. &gt;&gt; Wear all the hats you want. I'll come back next Sunday with hats. It's fine with me. But don't put any don't put any spirituality to it or I'll I'll knock the hat off. &gt;&gt; I've had them come to Bible way and you couldn't get rid of that hat for nothing because they came out of Catholicism and we wear hats. My wife, you won't forget this message anyway, so I might as well go full distance. &gt;&gt; My wife, we were over in Yugoslavia, was it there? Yeah. And we were in the church and they were receiving the message and so we were anxious to be there and and then they heard that, you know, we go in there. My wife's the only one that hasn't got a kerchief on. They all got a kirchief. That's important. You need to have a kirchief. And then when you have a kirchief, you're accepted because the scripture says your head is covered. And I guess they had that. Now, that was an opinion that that kirchief was the scripture. &gt;&gt; But if they read the rest of it down, it says, "Your long hair is given to you for a covering." &gt;&gt; And then we had to have a secret come. &gt;&gt; We had to have a prophet come says, "Here's the secret." Your hair is your glory. Your hair is your covering. &gt;&gt; And we said, &gt;&gt; "Yeah." &gt;&gt; Of course. &gt;&gt; So then they found out my wife sang. So they said, "Sister Bisco, would you sing this evening?" You know, and uh as she came in the door, they presented her with a kchief. So she wouldn't put it on. in the morning when she didn't have to sing. Did you put a curtchief on in the morning or something? I think they gave her something. You know, as long as even you had a little square piece of cloth on top of your head, you're okay. &gt;&gt; But if you haven't got that cloth on top of your head, you talk about strong whole churches, whole organizations, whole movements within a country operate on traditions. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Don't look too I might start naming some right here. &gt;&gt; And I'm okay because I have a long dress. No, you're not okay cuz you have a long dress. Long. There's no righteousness with a long dress. Unless you have the life inside that's convicting you to do that. &gt;&gt; A lot of people have long hair cuz they like long hair. &gt;&gt; Maybe not a lot, but some do. You have to know why you have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there has to be something inside that says, I heard a voice from God. &gt;&gt; I met God and that's why I do it. &gt;&gt; And then they can say, well, who sent you? Who is this? &gt;&gt; You can tell them who it is. &gt;&gt; So, you know, Sister Biscll didn't put the Kirchief on. Guess what? They didn't ask her to sing. &gt;&gt; You've got to have that on if you're going to stand and sing. then you're okay with God. Didn't mean a thing to God. &gt;&gt; To God, those traditions just stink &gt;&gt; because they have taken his righteousness and associated it with that bonnet or with that curtchief or with a long dress or with something else. But when his life is in and the word is in the bride and she does things because it's a reality. &gt;&gt; Who is this God? Just stay around. I'll tell you his name. I'll tell you who he is. I'll tell you about his life. And I'll tell you who I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And these traditions, these traditions, the transmission of knowledge, opinions, doctrines, and customs and practices, they're handed down. A tradition is when it's handed down from one generation to another. And we've got we've got those here who you know said, "Well, I was in brother Brandham's meetings." How many were in brother Brandon's meetings? One, two. I know there's a few more. There's some that perhaps don't remember. So then we tell you and then someone tells you says, "I heard it. I heard it from a witness. I heard a preacher and he preached such a mighty message and I was absolutely convinced in my heart and my soul." Well, that's good. But you have to have a meeting with God. Your own meeting with God. Say, "I met him." It doesn't have to be something flamboyant or something dramatic or something out of this world, but it is a it is a something that's divine. It's something that's deep &gt;&gt; and it's something that's personal. &gt;&gt; You have it and you become unmovable. &gt;&gt; So, it's handed originally by word of mouth and by example. Listen, I'm not done. Well, soon done. A tradition is the body or the whole body of Christian doctrine handed down through successive generations which is held by the church to belong to the deposit of faith of the word of God as the deposit of faith even if it may not be found in the scripture. A tradition becomes so strong. &gt;&gt; A tradition that can become so strong that it cannot even find it in the Bible, but yet people surrender themselves to it and succumb to it and become bound by it because this is what we do in the message. No, that's not it, friends. That's not it. We do what we do because there's something inside. It's a conviction within. Oh God, &gt;&gt; I want to please you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to live a life that's honorable to you. &gt;&gt; All of you, make that your commitment. &gt;&gt; Even if you may not understand everything, doctrines that are accepted as teachings of Jesus and the apostles without any evidence. &gt;&gt; There's no evidence that it ever was spoken by the apostles. I was in Jerusalem and looking, we were going down to one of the sites and there was a monk there from one of the Orthodox churches and we're going down the walls and there was some scratching on the walls, just different scratch marks and he had all the holy movements of a priest. Well, I'm not m I'm not mocking. I'm just saying I'm trying to describe how it was. And he's showing them all these these were supposed to be writings of people from ancient times. And the people all Oh. Oh. And they're looking at it. I tell you, tradition can take a person to very dark places &gt;&gt; and they attach sacred things to it. &gt;&gt; Maybe you haven't read. I'm I'm not I'm not fooling now. I'm not just seeking to be humorous, but I have seen I have seen publicized and and it wouldn't be so serious it wouldn't even be worth that mentioning today in the service unless there were millions of people millions of people that were taken in and sucked in. How are they sucked in? How are they drawn in to believe this and and to become uh so devoted to it? is because they started someplace and it may have been just with the way they dressed or the way they appeared and they start with that and then they go on and on and on and listen to me friends that is why I want everybody to listen to me that is why we I the other ministers here and I know myself I have urged you with an urgency you hear it in the message &gt;&gt; don't wait to hear it over the pull pit that &gt;&gt; don't wait to get it from a man. You hear it in the message. You hear it. Not only that, it will strengthen you. It will guide you. This word has been sent to you. &gt;&gt; That is the prophet's message to you as an individual. You will enter into a relationship cuz that's Christ. I was talking to a young Catholic woman one time and she just said, "You know, if I don't get to confessional, if I don't get to the confessional, she just has such a guilt. She has such a guilt. Can you imagine? She just lives under such a guilt. A poor life, poor soul. But if you can get to confessional and another one says, you know, as long as long as I can get to mass, get to mass. I didn't talk about this because I was I was ra I was born into a Catholic family, but I didn't understand it, you know. And my parents weren't living around a Catholic church. So I guess and so I went to visit my relatives and they and I'm walking in a boy about about Jack's age, I guess. Come Jack here with me. So, we're walking into church and now here's a bunch of idols and they go bend over and they kiss it, you know, and they kiss it and then they put their hand behind me and tried to get my head down there to kiss it. I tell you what, I did just what you did, Jack. I put some resistance in there. But as long as you kissed it, you are okay. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends? As long as we get to mass, we're okay. As long as we get to confessional, we're okay. As long as we look right and we come into the we look like a believer and we act like a believer and we sing believer songs, we're okay. That's not what's okay. What's okay is when you met God, &gt;&gt; and you can't be persuaded differently. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't gotten it, stay here. Stay with it till you do have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a meeting with God. &gt;&gt; And without that, let me tell you, especially young men, young ladies, young people, without that, you'll never survive this age. &gt;&gt; It will suck you in. It will draw you in. It will attract you. It's too attractive. &gt;&gt; Your prophet said it's too beautiful. &gt;&gt; Your prophet said he's a slicker. &gt;&gt; Your prophet said he knows the Bible better than we do. That's right. &gt;&gt; But he hasn't got an ounce of revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish right now. I've got more I want to say. Now I want to tell you I want to read a little story to you. This is a very different service for me, but I want to read a little different story to you. And sometimes we may think that brother Brandham went into very very juvenile stories, but he's bearing out a very powerful principle. And we're right on to traditions now. And this is in the message, the world is falling apart. He said, "Look, a little while ago, he's he's relating something that happened just a a little." He said, "Calls it as the little form form." Not long ago when little David and I remember in my young years, little David was a young fellow, a child preacher, and oh, people were he'd get up there probably, you know, 12 years old. I think he was 12 or 13 years old and preached like a house on fire and people came by the thousands and that's what brother Brandham's referring to. He says is formed when when little David and he called it system came out. What did I say? System was equal to a tradition equal to a denomination. And now he's describing and he says the little David system came out and every church had to have a little David boy preacher. &gt;&gt; What was it? Comparing comparisons trying to impersonate And there were many others &gt;&gt; and they all this was kind of an original thing God was doing. I I don't understand it but this was now everybody had to compare and personate. He said that's what got us into the mess that we're now in. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He says what you made Assemblies of God. Now he goes right from that right to the greatest movement that was happening which was the Pentecostal Assemblies of God. He said, "Assemblies of God," he said, "go back into an organization." He said, "What made you," he asked the question, "What made you Assemblies of God? Go back into an organization when that's the very system that God brought you out of. You tried to compare with the Methodists or with the Baptists. What made you oneness with your new issue? What made you go into an organization? The same thing that he brought you out of, it's the same thing. You just keep doing it over and over and over again, over and over and over. Handing it down, handing it down, comparing it with this church, comparing it with that church, comparing it with this young people's convention, comparing it with, oh, oh, I was down another convent. I don't care about another convention. &gt;&gt; I care about what he said. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you go to Europe or Brothers John's going to be preaching to to to Australia and young people's convention down there. That's irrelevant. I preach at conventions all over the place. It's that how people do it. One one person does it a little different than the other person. That's fine. But we're not going to make a tradition out of it. &gt;&gt; I hope this means something to you. &gt;&gt; He says God don't call you by your organizational brand. He calls you by your birth. &gt;&gt; Certainly, that's what God calls you by. &gt;&gt; He says God knows our needs. We've got to accept it the way he has it, not according to our traditions. We just can't receive it that way because God won't receive it. God won't have nothing to do with it. You see, uh, somebody, Brother Brandham, I see some person that can do this and some that. Glory to God. Lord, he says, if he did, he'll do it. If he calls you that, you won't have to tell anybody about it. it'll show itself. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, we have it. You won't have to tell anybody about it." He says, "Now, we find out in our denominational politics and we've accepted politics and let religious politics lead our ministers instead of the Holy Spirit leading our ministers. &gt;&gt; A man see a truth that he believes, he can't go to it, his church will put him out." Amen. &gt;&gt; This exists. This exists right in the message. &gt;&gt; We don't have to We don't have to be warned about what is going to be. We're dealing with it already. &gt;&gt; I can't fix it. &gt;&gt; God has to fix it. &gt;&gt; You can go to any place you want. I said to brother Vin once, I said, "How many different groups are there in Trinidad? How many how many different churches are there?" He said, "42." I said, "How many different angles to the message?" He said, "42." So, and even a minister gets into it. He get So, he can't I can't go there. I can't go over there. I can't Somebody might hear that you were over there or that you fellowship there. And then right away they got some kind of concept in their mind. Listen friends, this is what the prophet, you know, sometimes it stings. It stings me before it stings you. &gt;&gt; These are realities. &gt;&gt; These are things these are things that ought not to be. &gt;&gt; And the reason I'm saying it is not because, you know, we're going to go out and fix it. We can't fix it. I'm But I'm saying that so that we don't get caught up in it. &gt;&gt; We say, &gt;&gt; "Amen. That might be &gt;&gt; I don't know. And you know, you say, "Well, where do you finally end up, Brother Bisc?" This is where I end up. The Lord knoweth them that are his, &gt;&gt; and he will not lose one of them. &gt;&gt; What about this? What about that? What about this person? What about that church? That's not my business. My business is to know that I have met him face to face, that I hear his voice, that my life is surrendered to him. That's my business. That's all of our business. And what God does with someone else, we're not comparing with anybody. We can't compare with them because we're not going down that road. &gt;&gt; Amen. I saw the ecumenical movement move. You talk about spirit man, spirit, anointing, tongues, prophecies, interpretations, anointed preachers, all the rest of it. And and then I saw Pentecostal women, I'm talking about Pentecostal women who who I saw wipe their wipe the lipstick and wipe the, you know, the rouge and all the makeup off their face with their tears. I saw that &gt;&gt; not once, many times in repentance to God, having a birth, at least as far as I know, they're having a repentance and they're wiping it off their tears. And then on down by the time, you know, it got handed down, maybe their daughters and maybe themselves, the same women come in and they got the makeup on, they said, because how is that? Well, here's all the others coming in. are coming in from all of these other churches and and God accepts them. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; And not only that, God accepted them when they were in their trousers and pants. &gt;&gt; And so, praise God, we can do it, too. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet is saying. That's what got them into the mess. &gt;&gt; Now, you thought I was going to be in Exodus 3. I'm actually in 2012. Come on. &gt;&gt; I want to leave this with you. He ends up, this is all out of the world falling apart. And here's where he ends up. Now, he talks about little David and the preacher and everybody had to have them. A little story. And he continues on down. and we've accepted politics and religious politics. And then he goes into, you know, the Methodist and the Baptist and all of this and he says, "As long as it's a system, as long as it's a system, &gt;&gt; as long as it's a tradition," he said, "As long as it's a system, it's a system and the whole system's rotten." And get away from the thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said, "What do we do in the message? Get away from get away from comparing Well, they do it. Those young people do it. We're not. They're not our example. &gt;&gt; That church does it. Those women do it. That has nothing to do with it. Get away from it. &gt;&gt; Get away from that very concept. &gt;&gt; Well, God accepts them. How do you know God accepts them? God accepts his own children and God will convict his children. God will guide them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, and then then he comes down to this. And God sent them prophets down through the age. Every time their world system would fall apart, their world system, all the all the comparisons and all the denominations and all the organizations, their system fell apart. And God would send them a prophet and and and their religious system. And God send them a prophet. And you put them to death. He's talking going back now to what Jesus said. Just stay with me another two three minutes. And the and and God sent the prophet and you put him to death and in the tomb. And then about a generation you wake up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And realize that that was a prophet. &gt;&gt; And then what do you do? You garnish the tomb. &gt;&gt; Well, do you know what? this message wasn't so bad after all because, you know, we we thought you were just a bunch of, you know, a bunch of uh bookw worms or tapew worms and we said bad things about you, but you know, we're all kind of, you know, we're kind of sorry and we're all kind of one now and we said all kinds of nasty things about you. I've had people in this message call me serpent sade. That's fine. Maybe we'll sit across the marriage table. I don't know from each other. But if we do, there'll be there won't be no serpent seed there. And I don't know about you, but you know, friends, I'm to tell you as humbly as I possibly can. And you heard me in my testimony tell it. I did meet the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; And I met him with the prophet in the automobile. And now just while I studied this message is all came as a reality. You say it wasn't a reality before. It was a very real experience. And people would say what was it like and so on so forth. I'll tell you I understand now why Paul fell to the ground. &gt;&gt; I hung my head quickly &gt;&gt; and I thought my next breath was going to cause me to pass out of this world. I felt I was at the very edge of death. Whatever whatever this life was, I was leaving it. &gt;&gt; You may not have that experience, but you'll have an experience. You say, "I met him. &gt;&gt; My life was transformed. &gt;&gt; I met him. &gt;&gt; That's all you need to know." &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say that they garnished the tomb. And what do you do? He says, "Make a tradition of his life, &gt;&gt; of the prophet's life." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what Israel had done. Had taken the prophet Moses and had made a tradition of his life. And he goes on to say, "And that's that's the way they we do with Martin Luther." And now he goes, "That's the way we do with Martin Luther, John Wesley. Other men were always looking back. See those things." And you make a tradition of their life. Now I I know where the caribou was shot. I know where the grizzly was shot. I've never taken anybody back there. I'd like to go back, but it wouldn't be anything spiritual to me. It would just be a nice experience. &gt;&gt; So, I don't care what kind of belt buckle you have. &gt;&gt; I don't care about the pictures on your wall. They're perfectly fine. Some of them are so lovely to me. I have the one Marilyn has painted and I have that experience. I hope you see where I'm coming from. But it is we don't we don't look back just on the prophet's life and say, "Well, that's the way they did it. You know, this is the way they did it in another church or how many here have been to Israel?" Quite a number. Do you know who controls the places that they think Jesus was born and where he died and the resurrection, the tomb? All churches, denomination churches, systems &gt;&gt; because there's no sacredness back at that spot. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're happy. You know, we can talk about Sunset Mountain. &gt;&gt; We can talk about the desert in Arizona where the cloud came. You could go and stand at that very spot and it might not do a thing for you. &gt;&gt; You can meet that God here this morning. &gt;&gt; You can meet Nick and have that same experience. That's absolutely the truth. And when they heard the word of God, they believed and that's what happened. Then the Holy Spirit came to them. So we're not talking about historical. We're not just looking back. And neither are we just looking into the future, but we're looking at a reality. And neither are we going to make a a a tradition &gt;&gt; of the message &gt;&gt; because the minute we make a tradition out of it, the spirit of God just departs it. Because then all it is is it's an activity that we do. I'm closing. It's an activity that you do. And because you do it, you feel righteous. &gt;&gt; You feel okay. You feel okay with God. And if it's not okay with God, that's a deception. &gt;&gt; And that's why you'll now I hope this will explain it to you. That is why exactly why precisely why brother Brandham spoke against denomination so much because the people were locked up into a system into a man-made tradition and they kept doing it over and over and over again and felt righteous &gt;&gt; and there's no righteousness to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Who will I say sent me? He knew who sent him. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, I stand behind this pulpit. I stand behind this pulpit. And I wouldn't do so if I I hadn't had a could tell you of all truth. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; It's a reality. And we seek to bring you into an atmosphere where you know it's a reality. Amen. I'd like to have brother Ryan if you'd come and help me. I'd like to sing we'll walk in the light, the beautiful light. Come where the dew drops of mercy are bright. &gt;&gt; Shine all around us by day and by night. Jesus the light of the world. Understand? &gt;&gt; Now you see I don't need you to get excited here. You go home and get excited. You get in your car and get excited. &gt;&gt; You read a message. You pick up the Bible. And you could read you could read if you would also uh 1 Corinthians 10. And Paul again will tell he just couldn't he couldn't explain it. I think he couldn't make it any clearer. He talked about his, you know, he talked about his heritage and and what he'd been taught &gt;&gt; and they were all baptized under Moses in the sea &gt;&gt; and they all drank the water from the rock &gt;&gt; and the rock was Christ &gt;&gt; but they didn't know the rock was Christ &gt;&gt; and he was, you know, I'm sure if I was Apostle Paul, I would be scratching my head and saying, "How did they get from there to here?" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Dear friends, &gt;&gt; you have been entrusted with the most supernatural message. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to make you feel good. I'm saying that so that you'll know that there's nothing there's nothing that can deceive the bride of Jesus Christ. Whoever the bride is, nothing can deceive her. If you have a revelation, nothing can persuade you away from it. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to substantiate it. You don't have to try to make and say, "Well, that mountain is solid." No, it is solid cuz God made it solid. This revelation is an absolute revelation. It is something that you know that you know that you know. I have never questioned ever in my life ever questioned that I'm the son of Fred Biscll. Why would we question that we're a son of God? &gt;&gt; Something doesn't relate. Why would we question we're a daughter of God? Right? &gt;&gt; That has to be &gt;&gt; listen to me. That has to be a greater reality than your natural birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Has to be a greater reality to you. I know. Do you know who your mother and father is? If you know that, you've got to know that God's my father. &gt;&gt; My father. &gt;&gt; Teach us, Lord. Teach us how to pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; First thing, our father &gt;&gt; which art in heaven. &gt;&gt; Not my father that's here on earth. Our father &gt;&gt; which art in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallowed be thy name. &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth. God bless you friends. I trust this was I made something real to you this morning. The Holy Spirit makes it real to you. We'll sing. &gt;&gt; Come where the new drums of mercy are. Shine all around us by day and by night. Jesus the light of the world. First verse all the way. Jesus the light of the world. The light and mercy in his face. Jesus the light of the world. Much love. Now we'll walk in the light. Oh God of mercy. Shine all around us by day and by night. Jesus the light on the world. &gt;&gt; I want to dispel something that maybe tradition gave you. Well, one day I'll get into a place. One day I'll, you know, or it takes a long time. I got to find my way and get into the presence and get into the spirit. You know how long that takes? About that long. You can just come into that attitude. I want to dispel that. The church would have you believe that because the devil wants to use tradition &gt;&gt; to keep you away from it. Well, I haven't got time. I'll do it now. You know, I'll do it the next meeting. I'll do it the next time. God can meet you right this moment &gt;&gt; in just a moment. &gt;&gt; Amen, sir. with all your mind and all your heart and all your soul. &gt;&gt; Jesus, I'll walk in the light as you are in the light. And then we have fellowship one another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin. That is true. That is true. You met me back there, Lord. I remember when you met me. I remember when you spoke to me. and his presence will start to surround you right away. &gt;&gt; Right here, &gt;&gt; just now. Heavenly Father, we love your presence and you have sent the Holy Spirit and your messenger told us some of these secrets. how you tore yourself apart, putting it in a language that touches us so deep and you tore yourself apart and you gave a little piece to every one of us. The Almighty God, I wish to say before you, Father, and before these people and all who will ever hear this message, you are in your children. You are in me. And I trust that everyone Lord that's under the sound of my voice will say you are in me. You are in me Lord Jesus. And you've given me your word and you've opened up your secrets to us and thus we can live in this life. Oh God. Oh God we say thy will be done. Thy will be done in the earth in this body of flesh. Lord let your earth let your let this creation Lord be in the representation of you. bless your people. I'm asking in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Leah, my granddaughter, is here. And she had she had a kind of a very unusual experience in the last few days. Can I tell it, dear? a man came was came to the door or whatever and said, "Uh, may I clean your driveway? I have a piece of equipment. May I clean your driveway?" And she said, "Well, I really haven't, you know, I I haven't got the money for you to do that." And uh and Ava, her daughter, says, "Well, I got some cash." And so Leah says, "Well, if you'll clean it for $10 and a good cup of coffee." Yeah. I said, "I'll do that." And then they started talking. He says, "Well, I live over here in Fort Langley and I go to Are you a Christian?" "Yes." She said, "I go to a Pentecostal church over in Fort Langley." "Oh, okay." So he cleans off her drive. That's one experience. And then she goes shopping to Savon Foods or Safeway or someplace and she's standing at the cash desk just waiting to go through the cash desk and she's in a lineup and a voice from behind her says, "You have such beautiful hair." She turns around, the lady says, "How long is your hair? Is it down to your waist?" And a woman looked really quite rough. And she had a young man with her, a young a son apparently. And and they just really looked like they had a real rough life. And she said, "Is it down to your waist?" No, she said, "It's almost down to my knees." Oh, she said, "My daughter had long hair before I cut it off." And she said, and then she began to express what is inside. She wished she could live a godly life. And she says, "You know, there's a man." She says, "There's a man. He's a He goes to Pentecostal church and he's been trying to invite me over to his church." And she said, "Does he remove snow?" Yeah. She said, "That's what he does. He removes snow." And it was her neighbor. And now I was connecting with both of those people. But here this woman, what spoke to her? She's standing there to pay something at a cash desk. Listen to sisters when you do it because you met God and it's a reality to you. God's going to use it. &gt;&gt; He's going to use it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when a person does it of their own accord, &gt;&gt; nobody's trying to convince them. They do it to their own accord. They can't forget that. They'll remember that. Hallelujah. Whatever you do, whatever you say, we do it all in the name of Jesus. We'll just sing the chorus once more. We'll walk in the light. It's a beautyful light. Oh come where have mercy our bride. Shine all around us by day and by night. Jesus the light of the world. Would you shake hands with one another as we sing it again? We'll walk in the light. Well, there it is. Brilliant. So, God bless you. You're dismissed in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
