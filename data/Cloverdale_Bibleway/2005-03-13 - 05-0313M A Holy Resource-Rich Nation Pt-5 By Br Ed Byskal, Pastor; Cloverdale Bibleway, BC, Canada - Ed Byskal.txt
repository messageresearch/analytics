His main concern is that his children will grow up in a Christian environment, and he gladly accept Brother Serge's offer that we'd have a prayer request for him. So, we want to remember this man by the name of Martin. If you've got a need this morning, just raise your hand, your heart. As we go to prayer, if you're on the internet, on the telephone, hookup, won't you stand with us as we go to prayer? Brother Jim, if you'd come. [Music] Amen. Let's pray together.

And let's sing that chorus once again. Be fine. Oh, we'll not leave our little ones behind. &gt;&gt; For our father in mind. &gt;&gt; Some are weak and some are cable. Others may not feel the will not leave a single one behind. Oh, we'll not leave us little ones behind. [Music] For our father have them in mind. [Applause] Some are weak and some are people. Others may not feel we're able but will not leave single one behind. Just a moment of background to that course. As most of you know, uh the Lord gave me that course some years ago and I was inspired by the scripture when Pharaoh said, "Leave your little ones." And Moses said, "We'll not leave our little ones and we'll not leave a hoof behind." And that's the way I believe that same spirit rests today &gt;&gt; uh in the believers. We're not going to leave a hoof behind. We're not leaving anything behind. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said that &gt;&gt; not one can be taken out of my hand. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, we got a young one here. It's just starting out on the way. And uh Brother Michael, Sister Abigail have brought their son to be dedicated. They've named him Silas Hudson. It's heavy duty. Silas is from the scripture. Of course, I don't know what inspired Hudson. I do know Hudson Taylor was a marvelous man of God established inland China mission in China. It is said of him that he would sooner ask God than ask man. But I have a scripture I'm going to uh read regarding uh regarding the dedication this morning. Silas also has an uncle named Silas. And I'm sure he's here this morning. And I'm certain that Abigail's father and mother had Silas from the scripture in mind when they named him. And I'm going to be making a few comments about that in a moment. The psalmist said, "My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest part of the earth. Thine eyes did see me or see my substance, yet being unperfect, and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuence were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them." Brother Brandham said, "Look at you. One time you were just a teeny germ. You look at it through the microscope glasses and look at the germ in the sperm, a human sperm, and there's just millions of them. Little tiny germs. So tiny that they can't see it with the natural eye. That was every individual here one time. And that was Silas. just a little cell. I will say that one time Silas was an unnamed cell. And I believe that as instructed believers, there's always a desire to name this unnamed cell when it comes into the world. And this child was called Silas. And uh to you Abigail, probably even more than Michael, you'll probably call his name thousands of times from here on out. And to call is to to call or to cry. And there'll be times you'll probably call his name and you'll be crying. And to call is to utter with a loud sound. And probably you'll do that, Michael, a few times. call for help or to invite or to be chosen. And I have a strange thought that I have never come to before in the dedication. One called Silas became well known because Paul and Barnabas came into a severe disagreement at one time. And it was so troubling that Paul and Barnabas separated from one another. And Barnabas took one of us called John Mark. And the dissension was so great that Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them. And Paul said, "No, I don't think we should have him." And John and Barnabas said, "Well, I'm going to take him." and they parted ways. And the Bible says, "And Paul chose Silas and departed being recommended by the brethren." You never hear of John Mark again. And you only hear of Barnabas just uh he's mentioned three times in Corinthians as brother Apostle Paul speaks of him relating some things that took place. But Silas is mentioned Silas was with Paul in prison. Silas was with Paul when he established Corinth the church. Silas was with Paul because Paul chose Silas. And as I came to this dedication, I said, "Oh, God, choose Silas. And may this young man be invited to serve Christ may be dedicated to serve Christ. May the God of Apostle Paul, the God of his father and mother that are here, be his God." This is my prayer and that's my dedication service for Silas. Come here, Silas. You're already getting a voice and I think you want to be a preacher. Let us pray. Almighty God, father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who called the Apostle Paul and Apostle Paul called Silas. And Father, that call was an invite. That call was a desire that you had. and a a a message that you had for him. Lord, I'm holding this son, this child. I'm praying, oh God, that you will bless him, that you'll keep him in health. You'll give him a good, strong body, &gt;&gt; and you'll use him for your glory. I dedicate him, Lord, Silas Hudson, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. We want him to have energy. God bless you, Michael. God bless you, Abigail. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I believe we have a a special, but just before we do, uh we have prayer for Sister Mened, and Brother Jake has sent us word that she has improved a lot, and we ask that you would continue to pray for her. And also, if you would please remember our dear saints in China, the authorities have indeed moved in and the first thing that they have confiscated is the women's skirts. Do you remember on Wednesday and I said I was going to bring it up this morning, I said that the manifested word is harder than the written word. Amen. &gt;&gt; They had the message books there, but they have not seized confiscated them. That'll be the next thing. They have said they will confiscate those. But the thing that they confiscated was what was being manifested. They confiscated the manifested word and now the written word and are sending investigators to another area where the message has reached and the message is stirring very very deeply. Those people are just like you. They'd love to be here. &gt;&gt; They'd love to have this freedom today. &gt;&gt; They'd love to be able to just go into a place and just worship and sing and hear the message preached. And uh I'm I'm very affected. I know a little bit of about that restraint. And there's others here from China and they know a whole lot more about it. But you know, when the spirit desires, it's like an eagle in that cage, wants to soar, wants to hear, wants to open the mouth, wants to praise, wants to worship. And I'll tell you friends, we're responsible for the liberty that we have. And may God at least grip our hearts to be in earnest prayer. the situation the words that I have that the situation right now is very critical and so let us let us not forget to uphold them in prayer. There's only limited things that we can say about it, but we want to let them know at least that we have taken this burden upon our hearts as though it is our own family, as though it's somebody who's sitting right beside us, our own members, part of our body, because indeed they are. So, if you remember them, please. God bless you, brother Jason. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got a group of sisters. if you'd come and and get ready at this time. Let's sing number 126. I want God's way to be my way as we journey here. Dear Lord, I want God's way to be my way as we journal. [Music] For there is no other highway that a child of God should go. Though the road steep can run, it leads me. It's enough. I want God's way to be my way every day. [Music] From the earthly me to the heavenly. From this body to our theophony oh from this old past house &gt;&gt; to our father's house. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. [Music] If our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have another one waiting eternal in the heavens. He said, "I go to prepare a place for you that where I am, there you may be also. From the earthly to the heavenly, [Music] from his body to our theophony. Oh, from the soulcast to our father's house. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. In this body we grown, desiring to be clothed upon with our new body, celestial in the heavens. So when this corruption shall have put on incorruption, then mortality shall be swallowed up of life. From the earthly to the heavenly, from this body to our offering. Go from this old cast house to our father's house. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. [Music] Soon we'll lay aside this old ragged robe of flesh in exchange for a glorious one prepared in the heavens. [Music] And at the resurrection, at the sounding of the trump, my body will be glorified just like Jesus. Oh, from the earthly into the heavenly, from this body to our theophony. Oh, from the soest house to our father's house. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. [Music] From the earthly into the heavenly, from this body to our theophony. Oh, from the soul's house to our father's house. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. [Music] That's the mansion he's built for you and me. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. [Music] [Applause] Let's stand. I'd like to have you sing as a prayer as we come to the word. Open my eyes that I may see. And I trust you can sing these words just completely as a prayer. Open my eyes. Open my ears. Silently now we come. [Music] Open my eyes that I may see. Glimpses of truth has for me. Place in my hands the wonderful key that shall unlass and set me free. Silently bow I will for thee. Ready my heart. I will to see. Open my eyes. [Music] Spirit divine my eyes. Open my eyes. I need if I lift it up once again. So open my eyes if they spit [Music] divine. Oh blessed Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; May the Holy Spirit be present amongst us this morning. Open our eyes. Open our ears. Illuminate us. Oh God. Move upon us by the Holy Spirit that gave such understanding. And you have said that he will teach you and lead you into all things. asking your blessed presence to be with us. Oh God, when you are here and you're present, the supernatural is happening. There are needs amongst us. I have needs, Lord. Raise my hands before you, asking that you provide now all that is necessary for this time as I stand at the post of duty. And those that shall hear and listen attentively, have come hungering, have come desiring, and for whatever purpose and reason they have come, I pray, oh God, you will captivate, take under your control every spirit and every thought for the glory of God, all that are streaming with us wherever they might be throughout the world. Lord, asking that you will bless them and make the service to be an inspiration, causing your people, Lord, to just take a step higher. Forgive us our wrongs. Forgive us our sins, oh God. Forgive us our failures. And I pray, Lord, we will be strengthened in the most holy faith. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask your grace and blessings now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nice to see everyone here. Mickey, Lily, God bless you, different ones. We're just happy to have you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read from second Corinthians uh the 8th chapter. Just a short reading, one verse. verse 9. 2 Corinthians 8:9. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be made rich. Whatever we could estimate as being his riches, that is what it you are eligible for and to participate in his sufferings and his poverty as well. May God bless you as you have your seats. Okay, I would like to uh continue with uh part five of a holy resourcerich nation. And that is what God has intended that we would be. Don't want you to think that some things are repetitious. But sometimes when we are learning things in school, we certainly hear them more than once. And we hear them again and again and we hear them over and over until it becomes a part of us. until you have memorized it, until you can go home and quote it and say it off by heart. And that is very essential with some of these things. And I believe that what God has uh deposited within the bride body of Jesus Christ is something that Satan wants to do everything that he can to make sure that you don't discover everything that God has given. And so rather than just speak about it, I want to get right to the subject that though he was rich and rich is to in this case to have an abundance to be richly supplied to be affluent in resources and I am declaring on the authority of God's word that the church has the resources He's rich &gt;&gt; in repentance. She's rich in forgiveness. She's rich in humility. She's rich in revelation. She's rich in inspiration. She's rich in the word. She's rich in understanding. She's rich because she's been quickened. She's a rich body and powerful and strong. The prophet said, "You don't need power. You only need faith &gt;&gt; to move that power." We have the power and uh the body of Jesus Christ. There's a number of things that I just wanted to add at this point of things which the prophet said were in you. And if you can't believe me, believe him. believe what the word has said. He said, "If my kingdom," Jesus said, "if my kingdom is of this world." He said, "I could call many legions of angels, but my kingdom is not of this world, but my kingdom is in heaven." And he said, "The kingdom of God is within you." And so therefore the legions and and powers of the backing of the holy angels and brother Brandham couldn't stand it anymore. He just said hallelujah &gt;&gt; is in you &gt;&gt; was born into the deity of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. These things are are are within the believer. He said the same power another in the deity of Christ. The same power of Christ that was hung on Calvar's cross. The same power of Christ that was hung on Calvar's cross. The same God that raised him up from the dead uh raised him up on the day of resurrection is in you now. &gt;&gt; You that's got the Holy Ghost. The same power that was in Christ while he hung on Calvary. And the same power that raised him from the dead is in every Holy Ghost believer now. &gt;&gt; Not something you have to try to bring down. &gt;&gt; And Satan doesn't doesn't mind if you think it's up in heaven someplace or in some other stratosphere or he doesn't mind if you think that it's in your neighbor. He doesn't want you to get an understanding and a revelation that you possess it and it is within you &gt;&gt; because you might start developing it. &gt;&gt; You might start exploring. You might discover that this resource is within you. He doesn't want that discovery to take place. &gt;&gt; When Abraham walked over the land, it had all the oil that was under the ground. It had all the gold that was in the mountains. It had all the reserves to make the uh Israel as it is today a military force or powerful force or wealthy nation. It had all of that. Hadn't been discovered, hadn't been developed, hadn't been explored. And I can assure you that the nations around them don't want them to find that out. And Satan doesn't want you to find that out. And the prophet said, "And God had emptied himself into Christ and deity was in Christ." He said, "I hope you get it." And when that Christ was, he said, "And what that Christ was, he emptied into the Holy Ghost believer." He emptied. He didn't trickle it, but he emptied it into the Holy Ghost believer. So no matter what anybody says, he believes God's word. He has to for all that God was was in Christ and all that Christ is is in you. The believer the believer believes the word of God because the Holy Ghost can't doubt the very book that he authored. &gt;&gt; If ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Oh, how we hear that so many times it kind of just maybe runs off our back. I hope not this morning. He says, "If the word," this is in leadership. The very last message brother Brandham preached. If the word of God is in you from fore ordination of God in you, he said, "My sheep hear my voice. They know my holler. A stranger they won't follow." It's got to be that first. All that the Father has given me, they will come. Every one of them. &gt;&gt; Every one of them. &gt;&gt; I don't care what state a person's in today. I said every one of them. That's what Jesus said. And that's my theme in these services. To confess is to say the same thing. I'm going to say the same thing he said. I don't care how many devils, how many people, how many anything don't believe it. I believe it. You believe it. The bride believes it. Everyone has to come. Whether you come through one knot hole, two or three or whatever, whether you come early or whether you come late, whether you come without being wounded or after you come wounded, whether you come without chains or you come with all kinds of bondages, you will come. &gt;&gt; Whether you come with your doubts or whether you come with your troubles, you will come. &gt;&gt; If you're a son or a daughter of God, you will come because I'm simply repeating what he said. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In thinking man's filter, the only thing he said that you can draw through God's word, the only thing you can draw through God's word, the word is the spirit, the quickening power to make the word itself which is in you live to manifest Jesus Christ in the age that you're living. the only thing that you can draw through the word of God. You know, it's an amazing thing, but right here in the middle of the Bible, and I don't want to take any time with this, but when you if you take and divide your Bible between the Old and New Testament, which is this page right here, the only thing you can draw through here, because the New Testament immediately goes into Calvary and the sacrifice, the only thing that you can draw through there into the New Testament is the eulogy or the good record of those saints of the Old Testament. Because into the New Testament, you find nothing of Jacob's failures. You find nothing of him being a shyer. You find nothing of uh Abraham telling some white lies. If there is such a thing, you don't find any of their failures or their doubts or anything come through the cross because it can't come through the cross. It can't come through that filter. &gt;&gt; And the only thing you can draw through this filter is the manifested word for the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to manifest itself whether you do it or whatever happens, whether you do it early or do it late. Uh I guess a lot can be said about that. For now we see through a glass darkly. Apostle Paul said, "But then face to face." Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as I am known. Now we know in part because right now you're in the midst of, you know, your life. uh you're in the midst of circumstances. You're in the midst of uh raising a family, getting an education, or whatever more. You're in the midst of it. You're in the midst of your friends. You're in the midst of of a whole lot of events that are taking place that you know rotate and gravitate around you. But but uh and you can't see the end, but God knows the end from the beginning. So nothing's going to surprise him. &gt;&gt; Nothing's going to surprise God. And be and if you could see the end, if you could really foretaste, if each one of us could just have a glimpse beyond the curtain of time, it would certainly change things for us today. It would change the whole uh viewpoint and perspective that you and I have, you would change your entire future if you could just have a little glimpse for a few seconds beyond the curtain of time. I'll tell you what that would do for you. It would make the things that are so important to you, it would they would just flatten out. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't be important. &gt;&gt; It would change your future. It would change your uh your whole agenda &gt;&gt; and I can assure you it would change your schedule tomorrow. &gt;&gt; If we could perceive things as God perceives them, if we could see what God has given us for this journey, we cannot possibly know it all. So from from this point forward, from this point backward, we have a memory for that. And sometimes that's doesn't really serve us too well. And from this point forward, we have to acknowledge it by faith what God has in mind for us. But as Apostle Paul said again in Philippians, being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun uh a good work in you will perform it until the day of Christ, he will perform it. &gt;&gt; I'm really hung up on this to say the same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the confession. Say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Not say what I feel or say what I see. Say what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Thessalonians, faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. &gt;&gt; He will do it. &gt;&gt; I'm making my profession. You make your profession. He started a good work. He will do it. &gt;&gt; He will finish it. And that's how God works. &gt;&gt; Now, one of the main works of the Holy Spirit is to bring back to your remembrance. I'm giving a a foundation. I want to move as quickly as I can. Jesus said, "But when the comforter, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things." I was interested in this all things. All is the entire substance. &gt;&gt; All involves all time in all space. So there are there's an aspect there we've already run out of mental powers. &gt;&gt; All time in all space. I was talking to I got preaching a little bit to a couple brothers and uh and I was speaking with brother Derek and brother Gary came in for a message and if they happen to come in with a little message or something and I'm in the middle of of a a pre-ervice preaching in there if I get a hold of somebody I I I have to preach my message to them. Run into brother Tony and and sister Rebecca taking a walk down the White Rock and here we were with all those thousands of people. He actually interrupted me because I was in the middle of this message. I was preaching it to my wife. Remember when brother Brandham said he woke up early and his wife was sleeping or something? He said, you know, wake up, dear. I got to preach this message to you. So, I was in the middle of preaching the message while we walked took a walk in the afternoon and uh and I I get caught up with these things and I was I was uh I was uh I was saying to brother Derek and when you walked in, Brother Gary, uh I I said, you know, we can't we can't comprehend a God that has no beginning. said it Wednesday. You said, "Well, you said that Wednesday. I want to say it again. &gt;&gt; I can't comprehend it." I said, "And and and I said, this is probably one of the most profound things." I had it on this slide for you. You'll see it again this morning. And he says, uh uh I know we hear it so many times we run over it without thinking, but and a a a word is a thought. And he says, "And a thought has to be created." Think about that for a moment. and you were a thought &gt;&gt; and but that thought had to be created. It's a profound statement and I want to unite it with another statement I think is equally profound and brother Brandham says in Christ the mystery of God revealed. He says God loved fatherhood. &gt;&gt; He loved fatherhood. So let's just let loose with your imagination for a moment. focus on your own person being here. I want to tie a few things together. God perhaps for hundred million years because he has no beginning. There is no he's timeless. That's right. &gt;&gt; But because he had this attribute loving, he loved fatherhood, &gt;&gt; had this this great ambition, this yearning for fatherhood within him, this marvelous being maybe for aundred million years. He thought of a certain aspect of himself and he would like to just describe that and show it in a certain way and and in his mind that great mind of God and he not imagines but he thinks and constructs and creates &gt;&gt; a thought. how it will be and how he will express that and how he will bring it into being, how he will allow right from Adam and he's got the seed going from generation to generation. He's he's going to bring something forth and part of that I hope you don't think I'm going off the deep end. Part of that he's got to it's going to be physical. So in a in a universe, he's creating uh entire galaxies and he's got a lakes formed in the heavens and burning suns and moons and planets and stars and putting them in their orbit. This God remember his he loves fatherhood. didn't say he loved stars or loved planets or loved meteors or anything else. He loves fatherhood. And when this clinker went off the sun and dropped for tens of millions of years and he stopped it by his power and it's just a a a smoking smoldering ember and a prophet of God who just gets up into some stratosphere of of mental powers says what's he making making you? &gt;&gt; Oh my. You can get lost. You need to get lost in it. Think there there he was actually making the substance &gt;&gt; that he would allow to come down cuz he's going to speak a seed. He's going to bring forth a son and he's going to create a womb for the son's seed so he can reflect himself. And then from generation to generation to generation on down on down will come this sea of humanity. But amongst it will be his children. &gt;&gt; And he loves fatherhood. &gt;&gt; He's going to reflect just a certain aspect of himself. And no one can describe or express that part but you as an individual. &gt;&gt; No one. &gt;&gt; And that's what you need to believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what you need to believe. That's where it started. And that's why God has written and put such substance in the in some of the slides which we showed the last two services. And you need to put your personal self in there. I might just run through them very very quickly if we can have them up. That's why he said what he did that you are accepted in the beloved and what there is amongst the saints inheritance. Okay, I the blue part I want you to see and read and where it says us and we and so and so forth but I want you to say I and me &gt;&gt; grace be unto me &gt;&gt; and peace from God our father and Lord Jesus Christ he has chosen who me in him before the foundation of the world having predestinated me unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ unto himself. He hath made me accepted in the beloved. We have I have redemption through his blood. Say it again. I have redemption through his blood. I've been bought. &gt;&gt; I've already been purchased. It's been paid. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says Jesus did not give you an inheritance at Calvary. He simply paid the price. You had the inheritance before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Is this just some excitement? Is this just something for us humans to dance around, get happy about? No. These are vindicated prophets words. &gt;&gt; You had an inheritance &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. Calvary took place and the suffering of Christ simply to pay the price &gt;&gt; and make it known to you. &gt;&gt; I have forgiveness of sins. He hath abounded unto me in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto me the mystery of his will, in the dispensation of the fullness at times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, in whom also I have obtained an inheritance. That's why I want you to read it. being predestinated according to the purpose of him in whom also after that you believed I was sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of my understanding being enlightened who's understanding oh is this just a Sunday morning service oh open our eyes, oh God, that we might see &gt;&gt; glimpses of truth &gt;&gt; you have for me. &gt;&gt; Let me see. Don't let me walk out of here the same person I walked in. Don't let me just become enthused. Don't let me just have some uh emotional experience, but let this go down to the very souls of my feet. Hallelujah. That I may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. And you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins. Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened me together with Christ. By grace am I saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; And hath raised who up? &gt;&gt; Me up has raised me up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus in the ages to come that he might show the exceeding riches of his grace. By grace are you saved. Incidentally, you're just having a look at your land. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "This is all Ephesians." &gt;&gt; The prophet said this was Joshua, the book of Joshua in the New Testament. This is yours. &gt;&gt; Leave it undeveloped if you wish, but that's up to you. You need to develop it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to exercise it every &gt;&gt; day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And those things that have defeated you, you need to say that come from the kingdom of darkness. That come from Satan. I identify it and I deny it and I reject it. &gt;&gt; And what are you going to do? I'm going to say the same thing the word says. I'm going to repeat what Jesus said. Until the devil understands that's what I believe. &gt;&gt; By grace are you saved and through faith it is the gift of God. For we are I am his workmanship &gt;&gt; created in Christ unto good works. And God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. But now in Christ Jesus, ye sometimes who were a far off have been made nigh by the blood of Christ. We both have access by one spirit unto the Father. I am no more stranger and a foreigner, but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God. And I'm built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. In whom also I also am builded together for an habitation of God. In whom we have I have boldness and access. I wanted to highlight in a different color today for this exercise, but I haven't had the time to take those words which are the resources here. For example, I believe that boldness is a resource. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't come with timidity. We don't come with our hat in our hand. The scripture says we come boldly before the throne of grace. We have a father son, father daughter relationship. &gt;&gt; It's not somebody distant. &gt;&gt; We're fellow citizens. &gt;&gt; This nation &gt;&gt; and we don't belong to any other nation. &gt;&gt; You may have your own personal passport. I'll tell you this is the passport to the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled that I might be filled with all the fullness of God. You might say, "Well, I'm empty. I'm dry." This is the resource. &gt;&gt; This is the resource. &gt;&gt; I say to you, in the name of the Lord, you don't have to be empty. You don't have to be dry. You don't have to be defeated. You don't have to be weak. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be timid. &gt;&gt; I wish I could get the whole church to believe that. &gt;&gt; Now, unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that I ask or think. According to the power that workketh in me, unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen. Walk worthy of vocation wherewith you are called and in loneliness, in meekness, in longsuffering, in forebearing. Oh, we might say, well, I I don't have that. Yeah, you do have that. &gt;&gt; Haven't developed it. &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; Need to develop the resource. I say the bride is rich. &gt;&gt; Say he's rich. &gt;&gt; God has given these things. &gt;&gt; What am I going to say? Am I going to deny the word? I'm just reading your I'm just reading the the record of your resources &gt;&gt; endeavoring to keep the unity. So I have such a hard time you know we have a personality clash. We have a personality. Well develop develop this one. &gt;&gt; Unity is a resource &gt;&gt; and it is a sustainable resource. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not going to run out of this resource. &gt;&gt; God has given unity to his church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the midst of in the midst of all the entanglements of the world, God has given unity. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In the bond of peace. So what are we going to say? God has given us unity in the bond of compromise. &gt;&gt; God has given us unity in the bond of coexistence. &gt;&gt; Don't get quiet now. &gt;&gt; You've been shouting up till now. You want to keep shouting. &gt;&gt; You want to keep confessing the same thing. &gt;&gt; The high priest can't move till you confess this. &gt;&gt; He is the high priest of your confession. You got to say the same thing. &gt;&gt; That's what it is in the Greek. Say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, God can still work mighty, mighty supernatural things amongst us. unto every one of us is given grace according to the gift of the of Christ, the measure of the gift of Christ. In whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effect of working in the measure of every part. Every part maketh inter increase of the body under the edifying of itself in love. Put on the new man which after God has created in righteousness and in true holiness. Be ye kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. My we want forgiveness but sometime we are hesitant to give forgiveness and both of those are very very important. &gt;&gt; We have to give forgiveness &gt;&gt; and we also have to desire forgiveness. that we might present to himself a glorious church. All of this has been given to the body of Christ that he might have a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. For we are members of his body. I am member of his body. I am of his flesh. And I am of his pones. How can we say anything else? &gt;&gt; Are you free to say that? &gt;&gt; I am a member. &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; of his body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm a member of his flesh. &gt;&gt; I'm a part of his bones. &gt;&gt; I am inseparable &gt;&gt; from Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, put on the whole armor of God that I may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. &gt;&gt; Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day there will be one. &gt;&gt; And having done all to stand, stand therefore. &gt;&gt; Amen. and take the helmet of salvation, the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God, and above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. For those of you that weren't here on Wednesday, I just threw this up. Can you find Israel? In other words, can you find the promised land? And the prophet said the promised land was your land in the Holy Ghost. And quite often, it's very hard to find. &gt;&gt; You have to look hard. There's a lot around it. And it so happens, it just so happens as it is with Israel natural. So it is with us. All of this area here isn't very friendly. &gt;&gt; And they want to choke and drive that. You see that spot right there? Right from there, you can't even see it. From there over to the ocean. That's where Syria said not long ago, we'll just drive a pinser of tanks because it's only 11 miles to the Mediterranean and we'll cut Israel in two and they will be helpless. Their enemies thought they had focused on their weak point. Satan figures he's got you figured out. He thinks he's got your weak spot. &gt;&gt; And the thing that he has perpetrated as such a fraud upon the believers is that he's got them believing that the devil knows my weak spot. I'll have you know that Israel in the natural went in there and destroyed all of it &gt;&gt; and even took some of the enemy's territory. I say to you in the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; move in. Take your inheritance. Take all of your land. Defeat the enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were even asked, "Why is it you attacked at night?" They said, "Because we found it in the Bible." &gt;&gt; This is a nation. This is just a a a nation without Christ, without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But yet God, they're under the promise of God to do certain things. If a natural nation can do that, how much more you and I can do that? &gt;&gt; I think you should look at the map. That's fine, brothers. If you'll just shut that off now. So, we've been looking at some of the resources that we have. And I just wanted to bring that by you again because while we are here, we have difficulty seeing all that we are. But I'm I'm I'm praying that you will develop it all or develop begin to develop. Peter said, "According as his divine power hath given us all things that pertain to life and godliness." Now uh you know it's hard and I wanted to talk about for a wee bit. It's hard to make a real scriptural profession because sometimes people misunderstand. They think, well, you think something of yourself more than uh than you should. And it's misunderstood when a person begins to say what he said. &gt;&gt; Say what God said. Now, confession. The Bible says, and I've got to go over these very quickly, if thou shalt confess with thy mouth, if if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead. Now, we get the consequence. Thou shalt be saved. But if you don't confess with your mouth, it can't happen. &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, I want to just pray it in my mind." If he wanted you to just to pray it in your mind, that's what he would have said. He would have said, "If you just pray it in your mind, if you just think about it, it'll happen. It won't happen if you just think about it." You got to confess with your mouth. You got to say, "I have sinned against God. I've sinned against my brethren. I have done wrong. I've lived back slitten. I've lived away from God. I've rejected the wooing of the Holy Spirit. Oh God, be merciful to me. And you said if I would confess with my mouth, I confess that Jesus paid it all. I confess that the blood has paid for my redemption. &gt;&gt; I confess that you will forgive me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I confess I give my life to you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you begin to make that kind of profession. &gt;&gt; For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth, with the mouth. Not with the mind. With the mouth. I find people in this age, they want to do everything with their mind. Not with your mind, with the mouth. Confession is made. So that people want to say kind then some little mumble and remember well if I if if I hurt you mumble that around &gt;&gt; if you know you hurt somebody go and confess it &gt;&gt; say it &gt;&gt; I hurt you &gt;&gt; I've come to ask you forgiveness &gt;&gt; then God can work &gt;&gt; people wonder why things don't get straightened around because you don't take it on the scriptural basis. You've got to take it on the scriptural basis otherwise nothing will work. heaven that they confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. The Bible says further that if we confess our sins, he's faithful and just to forgive us. And hereby know we know ye the spirit of God. Every spirit that confessth that Jesus is Christ is come that he's come in the flesh is of God. And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. Not has come in the flesh, is coming in the flesh. &gt;&gt; All kinds of people want to believe he had did come. &gt;&gt; No, we're talking about now. True. &gt;&gt; Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he is in he is in God. And then this last one, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest of our profession, Jesus Christ. And to confess, to confess and to profess, it's almost almost identical word. In fact, they have the same root word in in the Greek. In confession is to say the same thing as another and to agree with I agree. We agree. And furthermore, confession comes down the root same root word for confession and profession in the Greek is very very interesting because it's a word I think you all know. It is logos. So confession logos is a a living word. Logos is not a thought. &gt;&gt; Logos is not a reasoning. So we don't obtain we don't uh uh we don't develop our resources by mental powers. &gt;&gt; We develop our resources by speaking &gt;&gt; a word. &gt;&gt; When you speak the word &gt;&gt; and you make the confession. That is why the weakest may maybe most uh you know one that's not visible or one that's not you know to the forefront within a congregation they can be such a powerful member of the body of Christ because they keep saying the same thing and that's why pro the prophet said say what the tape says because he knew that had come from a vindicated voice Say what it says. &gt;&gt; Don't say what you think it says. &gt;&gt; Say what it says. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "It seems like," and this is in the message of lamb and the dove. My I'm trying to go as quickly as I can here. I hope you forgive me. It seems like it's the hardest thing for people to get in their head that the Holy Spirit leads. Sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit of God and not bishops and cardinals and so forth, but the spirit of God. That's that was God's idea. And this is what confession. This is what confession is. This it came from that base word which I gave you the logos which is word. This is what is so interesting. It is God's idea. That was God's idea. And you know brother Brandham used that phrase many times. And I just want to give you a few because he said the the sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit of God. And I'll just abbreviate because he said not bishops and not cardinals, not this, not that. By the spirit of God, he said that was God's idea. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was his thought. &gt;&gt; And his thought then became a word. And that's why he said it. Now he's waiting for us to make that confession. not to say just sons and daughters, you know, on a great big broad grand scale or led by the spirit of God. He wants it to be a personal. &gt;&gt; He he spent a few hundreds of millions of years even crafting the thought in his mind and and and creating the thought that would bring you into existence. Doesn't he deserve us to be able now that he gave us a mouth, gave us a breath, gave us a tongue, gave us a language, gave us a a capacity to love him. Isn't it Isn't he do us to say the same thing? &gt;&gt; Not just say sons and daughters are led by the spirit of God, but to say I am &gt;&gt; a son. I am a daughter. And I am led by the spirit of God. doesn't do God any good. It doesn't do God any good. Person say, "Well, I know. I guess the devil got a whole I don't know. The devil this and the devil that." What are we doing? &gt;&gt; You think he thought of you for a few hundreds of millions of years to bring you on the scene to blubber out of your mouth? Oh, yes. The devil got a hold of me. I say, "This son has to go through a few more knocks. He got to find out &gt;&gt; that he's got to start saying what I said. &gt;&gt; And then I come out and I confirm it and I speak it and I give it so plain, so clear and so and and and the prophet says it can't get it through their head. &gt;&gt; Can't get it through this skull him. &gt;&gt; Oh God, illuminate us. &gt;&gt; Speak to us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That &gt;&gt; was God's idea &gt;&gt; in conference with God. He said, "No wonder St. Paul could say years after that when the bee of death uh the bee of death was hunting around him, say, "Oh, death, where is thy vic? Where's your stinger? Grave, where's your victory?" But thanks be to God who giveth us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Death was conquered and the bee could hum around. The bee of death could buzz and say, "I got you." But you can point over yonder to an empty grave and he didn't say and think. You can point over to an empty grave and say, "Thanks be to God that gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The grave's empty." &gt;&gt; What are you doing? Saying the same thing, saying the same thing, but you feel sick. Say the same thing that he said. &gt;&gt; You feel defeated. You made a mistake. You fell. You sinned. Whatever more he if I confess with my mouth the Lord Jesus he is he's faithful to deliver me. &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't like this kind of preaching. He doesn't like you to come and love it and say amen to it. But I tell you what, you agree with it. &gt;&gt; Every one of you, you agree with it. And God will move on this scene on your behalf. You can put him to the test. He cannot lie. He's not a man. He will say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Thanks, God. Thanks be to God that gives us the victory." He said, "He can make a noise, but he can't sting you. &gt;&gt; He ain't got any more stinger." &gt;&gt; When he anchored his stinger into the flesh of Emmanuel, God's flesh among us, it pulled the stinger out. And he said, "Out of death." He pulled the stinger out of death. And he closes with this phrase. That was God's idea at his first conference. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm glad we're not here with some man's idea &gt;&gt; or some bishop's idea or some headquarters idea. We have God's idea that came down from the beginning and was demonstrated and manifested in this hour. And a prophet's mouth could open up and say, "Say it." &gt;&gt; That was God's idea. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And knoweth it not, he said, "We'll never do any good with politics. &gt;&gt; It's rotten." 1998 the prime minister Chiron of Israel he said to the people build outposts on every hill occupy every hill every mountain build an outpost just a few years later he's saying get out of there &gt;&gt; and if you don't get out we'll send the army in and we're sending the bulldozers in. We're on the Oh, we're on the roadway, the map to peace &gt;&gt; invented by the president of the United States. &gt;&gt; We don't have that kind of idea. &gt;&gt; We have the idea. I don't care what president &gt;&gt; or what prime minister or what nation. This is the thought of God. And it was God's idea. God's idea was said to Abraham, "I've given you all this land." I don't care what anybody says. That's what every Jew ought to be saying today. What God said is what I'm going to repeat. Even in the face of the bulldozers, I say God gave our father all the land from this boundary to that river to the sea. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for getting excited, but I tell you what, that burns up in my bosom. &gt;&gt; And let it go far and wide. It'll go far beyond the walls of this sanctuary. It'll go on the internet. It is already going on it. And it'll go from your mouth. &gt;&gt; It'll go across the seas. It'll have an effect. It'll have an influence. &gt;&gt; That was God's idea. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's idea of having a king, he said it'll never do any good through politics. It's rotten. God's idea of having a king, a righteous king, is right. &gt;&gt; That was God's idea. Hallelujah. We see things and you know what? It's difficult not to become not to become negative. &gt;&gt; I better not get on that or I won't won't get any further. I'd like to spend another few minutes on the message. I said I would start on choosing the harder way and I'm there now. We do have within us the power to choose the harder way. Doing the right thing, living the right life &gt;&gt; is not the easy way. I'm calling on you as individual believers to choose the harder way. You might say, well, what does that mean? Well, we'll talk about it for a little bit. And the message marriage and divorce was when you know there was a prophecy over brother Brandham in tongues at the cafeteria in Los Angeles and three people stood up and interpreted and one uh which was Danny Henry. He was an official interpreter from the French language and another woman came up. All three of the interpreters interpreted exactly the same thing. And brother brother Brandham is actually reading Danny Henry's signed note in marriage and divorce. And it starts out, the prophecy starts out and brother Brandham as you know is towards the end of his ministry said in marriage and divorce 1965 said because because thou hast chosen the narrow path the harder way. That's the opening phrase. You know the opening phrase is very important. And when you would stand before him and he would say to you, "Because you've chosen a harder way, the saints in China right at this moment know that this is the harder way." My wife, I told her for the first time just driving up here to the church, I got this note. I got this message out of China about two days ago and it's been a heavy weight on me. But she as a woman said this is such a violation that they would take that the authorities would tell a woman what she can wear and the very garment that she desires to wear is stripped from her and taken from her. That's why a prophet says it's rotten &gt;&gt; to the core. It's rotten in China. It's rotten in America. It's rotten in Canada. &gt;&gt; We have just suffered the loss of four Royal Canadianmounted police, gunned down in cold blood by a young man or a man who was brought up in a Christian home and his father said he is a devil. He started with marijuana. Started. His father said he started years ago with marijuana and we have a government that stand up and give words of compassion, have a moment silence and send dignitaries and speak nice things and at the same time are passing legislation to legalize marijuana. Whoever whoever whoever gives a scent to that bill takes responsibility for those boys death. &gt;&gt; That's a that's the just the bare naked truth. If you only had what a prophet said, a judge in Atlanta slam his his court reporter killed the deputy has died and the fourth one is in still in the hospital the last I heard and I don't know the condition but he got his gun from a woman officer &gt;&gt; in the elevator and if they had a prophet. If they'd listened to their prophet, she'd have been home baking cookies. &gt;&gt; She'd have been home maybe looking after the children. She has children. She'd have been home caring for her husband or her home or whatever more. She'd have been where she should be instead of being where she should not be and have a man overpower her because she's not. He felt sorry. He said it's the most dis it's a disgraceful thing for a nation &gt;&gt; to put a woman out in front of that trouble. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a sick sick generation we're in &gt;&gt; and we're not being negative. That's the way things are going. And my brother, my sister, there's violence in every place. Seven people swaying yesterday in a church service &gt;&gt; in church trying to worship God and someone comes in that's disgruntled with the minister and takes their lives. Oh, this word says as it was in the days of Noah &gt;&gt; and the earth was filled with violence. &gt;&gt; Filled with violence everywhere. You can take this world, but I'll have the next one. &gt;&gt; You can keep this. This is degenerating. You think it's going to improve? It's degenerating to a tribulation. &gt;&gt; And we might as well say what he says. &gt;&gt; That's what he says. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anyone who would even go into the tribulation with a trickle of God's uh call in their life said, "Well, they will pay with their life." &gt;&gt; Why would we why would we sit in an atmosphere like this &gt;&gt; and allow it to the opportunity to slide by? I say to every believer, we want to snug up. &gt;&gt; We want to do what he said to do. You want to believe in the resources that God has given you and don't let them sit idle. &gt;&gt; I thought of the man with the talents. And the one hid it in the ground. The other that was given five. And the other that was given two. They went and gained another two and another five. And the one said, "Oh, here I hid it in the ground. I didn't develop it. I didn't do anything with it. I didn't I didn't even he said at least you could have put it out to the to the lenders and we could have had the interest from the usery of it. You didn't do anything with it. God expects when he gives us something and when I have read and you have read and I have put myself personally in the book of Ephesians and a prophet declares that is your land. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with that land? Don't bury it. Don't leave it there and just say well yeah I I believe it you know we do have it. I do have the power of forgiveness. I have the power of unity. I have the power all of these things. God expects you to do something with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Develop it. &gt;&gt; Show yourself rich &gt;&gt; in Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I feel like I feel like preaching, friends, feel like preaching to the world. &gt;&gt; Those attending here today, don't just take this as another Sunday morning service. &gt;&gt; You might not get out for a long time the way I feel right now. Don't look at your watch cuz your watch will do you no good. &gt;&gt; If you're going to do anything, you better pray. &gt;&gt; Stop that, man. &gt;&gt; It's the only thing that might stop it. &gt;&gt; It's It's hard to say the truth. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit spoke through these people in tongues. Said, "You've chosen the narrow path." Was it ever narrow? lost most of all of his friends in the seals. He says, "I know that this will cost me 10,000 of my friends." &gt;&gt; He's going to say it anyway. &gt;&gt; Lost his friends. You know why? Because he had to say the truth. Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. Am I therefore the Apostle Paul? The Apostle Paul. You might say, "Oh, if the Apostle Paul was here, if we had anything but brother Biscll, if the Apostle Paul was here, I tell you what, you wouldn't accept it any different if Brother Brandham was here himself or if the Apostle Paul was here or the Lord Jesus Christ was here." Cuz you got to fight the same devil, &gt;&gt; the same doubt, &gt;&gt; and you know what they would do? They'd say the same thing &gt;&gt; because they can't say anything different than what is already written here. &gt;&gt; They'd say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to &gt;&gt; I therefore, Apostle Paul says, am I therefore become your enemy? Because I tell you the truth. Paul said that. Do you know why? Because some had become his enemy. I want you to hear real close. Some folks think, "Oh, if you just if you're really preaching it, people just flock to hear you." Don't you believe it? &gt;&gt; If you speak the truth, some will flock to hear it. But most will flock away from it. &gt;&gt; They don't want to hear the truth. &gt;&gt; They don't want to hear how they're supposed to live and how they're supposed to act and how they're supposed to dress, how they're supposed to sing and how they're supposed to preach. They don't want to hear that. &gt;&gt; I say, "We want to hear the truth." And I trust that everyone who comes here wants to hear the truth. &gt;&gt; And if it hurts, don't shove it off. &gt;&gt; Don't pass it to someone else. Say, "Amen." That's me, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Let it take the hide off my back. &gt;&gt; Don't let me get through here easy. Let me hear the truth. He said, "Tell the truth no matter how bad it hurts something. Tell the truth anyhow cuz you can always tell it the same way each time." That's what Brother Brandham told Billy Paul. He says, "And if you tell a lie, you have to go a million miles around and still you have to come back to that lie again. And you just made an awful thing." and just be honest and you can always tell it the same way because it's the truth. It was a hard time. Can I go on for a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Just a few days into the wilderness journey and the children of Israel got to Kadesh Barnea. And I'm interested to see how people in the same company, now I'm getting really touchy spot here, how the people in the same church, cuz once they got called out, they were the church. &gt;&gt; You understand? They were the church. And the people in the same church were experiencing the same thing and had completely opposing views of the event. God said to Moses, "Send out the spies. Get these honorable men, princes, leaders amongst the people and send them out. Send 12 spies out. Two come back." Well, they all come back and they say, "Oh, it is a land indeed. It flows with milk and honey." The resources are there, but we can't get to it. &gt;&gt; We can't develop them. &gt;&gt; They're just far too big obstacles in the land. I can never I can never do that. They said they begin to contrive amongst themselves, let's vote in a leader that'll take us back to Egypt. be a lot better to die in Egypt than it would be to go in there. We either want to die in Egypt or die in this wilderness. &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? &gt;&gt; I say it was mass insanity took a hold of the people. &gt;&gt; Mass insanity took a hold of the people. Why not die at least going into your inheritance? Amen. &gt;&gt; You know this man that just shot the judge in Atlanta, he went to take a reporter's car and I saw the reporter on a video clip on my my computer and he gave his testimony and he's all bruised over his eye and on his nose. Looked like his nose almost was broken. He said he just come from the hospital. They're interviewing him. He looked very much like brother Lonnie Jenkins actually in appearance and he's very clear with his thoughts. They were searching for a a green 1997 Honda. It was his Honda. And this fellow came up to him with his gun. Says, "Give me your keys." He said, "No, I'm not going to give you my keys." He said, "You give me your keys or I'm going to kill you." So he gave him his keys, got out, and the guy opened up the trunk, says, "Get in that trunk." He said, "I'm not going to get in that trunk." He said, "You get in that trunk, I'm going to kill you." And he knew in his own mind that if he got in the trunk, he'd be killed. So he decided and the guy struck him with a gun and and the gashed his eye and his nose and everything and he fell and broke his wrist. But he decided I'd sooner die running, &gt;&gt; getting free than die in that trunk. I know if I get in that trunk, I'm dead man. So I'm going to run for it. And he ran. And the guy didn't shoot. He got in the car and took off. I tell you what, these children of Israel, do you know what? They died in the wilderness because that's what they said. &gt;&gt; What they said is what they got. &gt;&gt; I'm going to just hold this thing. I'm going to just keep this chip. I'm going to just feel this way. I'm just going to have that. You'll die there. &gt;&gt; You'll die holding that thing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You need to develop the resource. &gt;&gt; I have the capacity to forgive. &gt;&gt; And you know, we kind of make light of it. We make light of it at the very words of Jesus. You know why we make light of it? Where Jesus said 70* 7 when Apostle Peter thought, "Oh, I'm really saying something. Do I have to forgive this man if he comes seven times in a day?" And then we say lightly. You know why we say it lightly? Because we haven't developed the resource. We want to make it light. It's not light. Jesus said 70* 7. &gt;&gt; And because you haven't got enough hours in the day to say it 70* 7, what he's saying is this is something that you have. It's part of my nature. It's part of my character. Oh my brother, my sister, if we could see the kind of homes and the kind of families, if we'd only live by the word of God. As I said, young people say, "It's obey your parents. Obey and honor your parents." &gt;&gt; How can I do that? My dad's so unreasonable. My mother's so unreasonable. Mother Mother screams at me. This happens. That happened. That isn't what it says. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the word is saying for you to say the same thing. &gt;&gt; And you have the capacity. You have the power within you. &gt;&gt; You know, my daddy's gone. A lot of years ago, my sister Anne is here. It's at his bedside when he left. And my daddy and I worked at the same worked in the same place. and I was his boss eventually. I was president and he was he was probably the bottom man on the ladder. Nobody ever knew that. I had people really come up and say they called him Freddy and called me Eddie. They said we wish we had that kind of relationship you have. I had other people strangers come up say are you brothers? No. I said this is my father. I was president. He was bottom man. But in my mind, he was top man. &gt;&gt; He was my father. &gt;&gt; And when my father said something, we might even disagree. We might disagree on something that never changed one biota of our relationship. It was a marvelous, marvelous relationship. And I tell you what, it doesn't it doesn't happen without some something being developed. This doesn't just come on a silver platter. It's something you have to say in your heart. I'm going to develop this. This is my father. This is my mother. You young people. This is my father and this is my mother. And by you by you you honoring the word of God and honoring them, it'll make even a big transformation. &gt;&gt; Can I just take five minutes? &gt;&gt; Five minutes more. So we got we got Israel at Kadesh Barnea and we'll leave we'll leave that there. It's harder to declare the manifested word than it is to declare the written word. Because you know we can say, "Oh, this is what the word of God says. Here's a message book. This is what the message says. This is what happened. Now, I I can show you. I'll tell you something. Malachi 4 was written here for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years. It never was a problem. I never heard that Malachi 4 was anything to dispute about till Malachi 4 came. &gt;&gt; When Malachi 4 came and a ministry just fitted, Brother Brandham, you can't find a place. You can't find one place. I challenge you. Where he says, I'm Malachi 4. He never said that, but he kept saying is what Malachi 4. Behold, when Elijah comes, he'll forun. He'll turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers. And when they begin to see and the people begin to see manifested Malachi 4, they didn't mind it written, but we don't want to see it manifested. &gt;&gt; We don't want to see it manifested. See, they'll say in here that a long hair on a woman is her glory, but they don't want to see it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We don't want to see it when they see it go by. &gt;&gt; What in the world is this? Some strange creature from space. No. No. You just saw something walk by that had their glory. &gt;&gt; And the world's not accustomed to that glory. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's a strange sight to them, that kind of glory. and they meet people with clean mouths &gt;&gt; and they see men with a radiance on their face and women's with a glory on their face and it's a strange thing in this world. &gt;&gt; I had a total total sinner said to me, "Are you from that church where these ladies go with the long hair?" That's exactly the church I go to. I know how did they tie me up with a long hair and I got short hair. Oh, there's some kind of there's some kind of affinity. There's some kind of manifestation. &gt;&gt; And they see it. Oh, my brother, my sister, this is the way of the Lord. Walk ye in it. When the tempter I'm closing now when the tempter came to Jesus said if thou be the son of God command that these stones be bread. Notice he said, "If thou be the son of God," notice now it come out of a different mouth, but it came the same words. When Jesus was on the cross, they said, "Uh, if thou be the son of God, come down from the cross." What was it? Same same spirit. &gt;&gt; The spirit that was in the tempter now was in his children. &gt;&gt; Thou be the son of God, make these stones bread. there'll be the son of God come down from the cross. So even what he said was not consistent. But you know why it wasn't consistent? Because when that son of God was moving about and came into the into the area of the gatherines. There's two fierce men, wild men that nobody could pass that way. They tore chains couldn't hold them. They're wild men, demon-possessed men. When Jesus, he didn't, he didn't do anything spectacular. He just walked there. The manifested word. When he walked into their presence, they screamed out, "What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus, the son of God?" They knew he was the son of God. Satan isn't even consistent with his with his confession. &gt;&gt; Once he's questioning it, next time he's screaming for help. No wonder. I mean, no wonder. I hope I wish you people could see what I say. No wonder when that prophet came out on the platform, he says the demons in that the demon up there and that person, the demon over here are screaming for help because they're afraid she's going to believe. &gt;&gt; Can you accept that? &gt;&gt; If you dare believe, you're going to cause demons to scream. They're going to scream for help. &gt;&gt; Why don't you do that? Do you believe? Say the same thing. That's exactly what'll happen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what'll happen. &gt;&gt; If you've harbored something, say, "Oh, God, I'm going to agree with your word. I'm going to say it." &gt;&gt; Demons just begin to scream &gt;&gt; for mercy and for help. Have you come to torment us before our time? Well, you're not going to get the ultimate torment from me, but I'm certainly going to torment you all I can. Depart from me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. harder to declare the manifested word. Jesus had disciples are with him and you're you're you're here in the congregation this morning and you sit here. Jesus had these disciples around him and when bread was multiplied, cooked fish, cooked bread, they gave it all out. There was no reproach. Everything he got into disputes and discussion and disputes, severe disputes with the Pharisees and the scribes and the Herodians and all of these people. And the disciples, they just they were part of the congregation. They sit there and listen. And then they took up stones. They never took up stones to stone the disciples. They were just associated yet. But they took up stones to stone him. the manifested word. &gt;&gt; They had had that written word for centuries, but now it was manifested. So they took up and they reproached him, spoke evil against him, said all kinds of things, and he's a illegitimate born, whatever more. But then Jesus said, you know, I've got to go. It's expedient that I go. If I don't go, the Holy Spirit won't come. But I'm going to go and I will send the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit came into them, that's why the prophet said all the time, you got the Holy Ghost. You've got the Holy Ghost. Then everything is for you. You have the Holy Ghost. Then that very Christ, everything he was on the cross, everything he was in the tomb, everything he was in the resurrection in you. &gt;&gt; Can you say it? &gt;&gt; It's in me. &gt;&gt; Everything he was on the cross is in me. &gt;&gt; That's why a prophet comes says the token is in you. &gt;&gt; Token isn't up in the heavens. The token is in some place in some office. The token's in you. &gt;&gt; You carry the token. &gt;&gt; But when that spirit came into them &gt;&gt; immediately. Now the manifested word was in their flesh. Threw them in prison, killed James, stoned Steven right away. Why? Why did they take up stones for them? Didn't take it up in all the all the other years. But now they took it up because they were manifesting the word. [Applause] It's harder to manifest a word than it is just to speak or read the written word. So, I got the tapes. I got this. I got the MP3s. The devil's not worried about that. He's worried about what gets what gets out of here into you. &gt;&gt; And then starts being lived out. &gt;&gt; I want you to go out of this place today saying, "I have been I've been given life. God thought of me for so many millions of years or tens or hundreds of millions of years. He thought of me." That's not just something nice brother Bis was trying to say. I'm telling you the truth. God created that thought in his mind, brought you on the scene to manifest the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; And Satan hates it. You have to say, "I was made for it." &gt;&gt; God loved fatherhood. And I have come as one of his children. I'm here now as one of his children. &gt;&gt; I come here to manifest it. It'll be harder than just reading it. Harder than just listening to it. I'm going to manifest it. I'm going to show it. Express it. Now, it's not just an expression. Say, "Well, I don't have it within me." Yeah, you have it. You might have to look hard at the map. &gt;&gt; You have it. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I was, you know, I I'm this. I'm British. I'm Irish. I got an Irish temper. I'm I'm Ukrainian. I'm stubborn. I got I'm German. I'm this. I'm that. I'm I'm American. I whatever." No. You're Christian. &gt;&gt; You're Christian. &gt;&gt; And you've got a land. It's called your inheritance in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And this needs to be developed. &gt;&gt; Brother Brother Mike, you come, would you please? Brother Mike wrote a song and it'll mean more to you today. You know what it was? I'll die believing. &gt;&gt; I'll die believing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll die confessing. I want you to hear it. And uh I want I want you to s seriously consider maybe there's somebody here that needs to make a make a positive stand. I'm Forgive me. I've gone over time and I'm only partway through. I've just been so consumed with this glorious thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, while brother I closed with this Wednesday and never got to it, I was saying the manifested word is harder. Now, it's hard for a lot of you folks perhaps to understand because I go back clean to a message in Phoenix from 1947. Now, just let me give you an overview while these brothers don't be distracted. 1947, brother Brandham's ministry is just breaking onto the scene. Houston hasn't happened yet. Durban, South Africa, hasn't happened yet. Bombay, India, and the blind man's eyes being created in his eyes hasn't happened yet. The throngs trying to tear his pants and clothes to get a little piece hasn't happened yet. 300,000 in Durban. The city streets choked till they have to close a 10-day meeting down to three because the city can't move. Hasn't happened yet. Seven huge stake farm trucks loaded with wheelchairs and all those. Hasn't happened yet. None of that's happened yet. The revival from 1948 to about 1958, mighty sweeping revival called the restoration of the gifts hasn't happened yet. Great moves of God, but here's what he said. Look, friends, it's hard to say that. It's hard for people to see that. And remember the Pentecostal age is a rejected age. Here he knew that a great re sweeping revival was just commencing. And he's telling the people, you talk about prophetic foresight, telling them it is a rejected age. And he says, "I hate to say that for I have never found faith in any church like the Pentecostal church." He was around his friends. He was around people who loved him. He was around people who'd die for him. He was around people who were going to give him perhaps tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even into the millions of dollars for the campaigns and to keep it going. So, I hate to say that. And all they knew was what they were in was Pentecost. That's that's where God was, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's all they knew. And he said, "But it's rejected because it's the Leodysian church age. Lukewarm. It will be prophecy." They never heard this prophecy. It will be spewed from the mouth of Christ. But God in there, God in there will draw out his people. That's also a prophecy. &gt;&gt; And I saw it spewed out of the mouth of God. But I also saw God drawing them out of there. And I'm here tonight to testify. Oh, Father, I thank you. you put something in our hearts &gt;&gt; to respond. &gt;&gt; And he begins now to tell them after that there'll be a council that'll raise up. And 1947 was the first time it even came into the minds of men, big theolog theological leaders to to to just assemble in a loose fashion. Nothing formalized. But in 1948 then his ministry sprung to go global and they had they institutionalized the world council of churches and it became a council and he forewarned them it will be a council. I tell you what, I have so many things. I hope I'm able and I hope I live long enough. I want to be able to I've got I've got a documentary called The Vatican Revealed. And I'd like to show you some things and tied right into what that prophet said, how how the Vatican will come in and take over America and how America will start to say the same thing that the Vatican says, the same thing that the Pope says. That beast coming out in in the 13th chapter will say the same thing. The beast before it said the same thing. And you have lived to see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pathway to peace is not an invention of President &gt;&gt; Bush. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an invention of the Vatican because they've been pushing it for years. &gt;&gt; Pathway to peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's pathway to destruction. &gt;&gt; I also would like to read in fact I'd like to put it on the screen for you. God help me to do all these things. It's just going through my mind. It's so hard for me to stop. I want to put on the screen for you out of the covenant. I have the covenant of the Palestinian people. I have their covenant that they do not believe in the state of Israel and they intend to push it into the sea and they intend to annihilate it. &gt;&gt; How do you have a road to peace? Road map to peace, road map to destruction. But the prince of peace &gt;&gt; shall certainly come. &gt;&gt; And we're moving right to that hour now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He's going to do it. &gt;&gt; I want you to do I want you to do I want you to think prayerfully. And if you're not in that place, I'm going to I'm going to give you an invitation. I want you to hear the words of Brother Mike's song. Sing it loud and clear. Brother Mike, [Music] Satan stands before you accusing me of sin. No pressure is unceasing. Lord, I know with whom I've been, though all should fall around me. In your word I'll stand. Your hand and mine to guide me [Music] to my promised land. [Music] I die believing the difference a token makes. I'd die believing if that's what it takes. I die believing the catching away of your bride. I die believing you're living inside. [Music] My sins recalled to memory. My thoughts won't let me be. The greatest battle ever fought rages on me. Although I look defeated now, just wait around and see the spirit of the living God. You battle for me. I die believing the difference a token makes. [Music] I'd die believing if that's what it takes. [Music] I die believing the catching away of your bride. I die believing you're living inside. Your spoken word made flesh in me. Preparing your bride for eternity. The stature of a perfect man is your plan for me. Recognizing your word in this day. called elected, anointed in place in service for the living God. The capstone we will meet. Sing it with me. I die a token makes. I die. If that's what it takes. I die the catching away of your pride. I die. You're living inside. family. [Music] Let's stand as we sing. He became me. [Music] He became me &gt;&gt; so that I might become him by grace. [Music] &gt;&gt; He became me so that I might be called him by grace. He took my place so that I through his love to take it. [Music] He became me so that I might become. [Music] No doubt there are many who the Holy Spirit has spoke to. And I realize that not as a formality, but right where you are, you can make your heart an altar, a place where sacrifices are made. And I would so urge you to join with me while I seek to lay my life also on that altar. I want to be like him. I want his flame to come and consume the sacrifice. Take the time, the resource of time, the resource that he's deposited within us. May it not remain hidden and buried, but may it come to the surface. May the talents and gifts of God be developed for the benefit of the body of Jesus Christ, this beautiful bride that our Lord Jesus purchased at Calvary. There might be others. And if you're here, say, "I need help. I don't hardly know how to pray. I don't know what I should say, but I do know I have a great need. And if you want to step forward, if you wanted to kneel, there's a good number of brothers here, be happy, and they will come forward and pray with you. We have godly deacons know how to pray. And I'll tell you what friends, there is a resource of deliverance here within the church of the living God. And there is no power that can withstand. There's no power that can continue to bind when one of God's children says, "Father, I'm coming home." Not enough devils in hell to stop you. God only knows to do business with a true heart and with sincerity, a resolve and a determination. And if you are here, man, woman, child, whoever you might be, we'll be we'll do our part. You do your part and God through Jesus Christ will do his part. We'll sing it just another time or two. He became me so that I might become by He betrayed me so that I become my gra. He took my place so that I through his love could take him. He came so that I [Music] &gt;&gt; all that I have, all that I ever can be. All that I am, all that [Music] I shall ever [Music] [Applause] love that I surrender to thee. All that I am, all that I am, all I shall ever [Music] can [Music] I know I surrender to thee.

You feel the pull. Then yield. Just surrender and God have your way. Have your way in this body of believers here this morning. How many would like to see the supernatural? I'd like to see God coming on the scene. Do your part, friend. Do your part, believer. Do your part while Satan is fighting. Let the Holy Ghost move through you in power. The church of the living God. Use that resource. Let your mouth be open in confession to Christ. I believe that all things are possible to them that believe. I believe that Satan is defeated. His head has been bruised at Calvary. He has lost his grip and power. I am free. We are free. Hallelujah. Gracious Holy Spirit, [Music] we yield our all. We give ourselves. We are your vessels. We are your body. Oh, bless the holy name. And don't let people yield now, Lord Jesus. Don't let them struggle. Don't let them hold back. Don't let them resist.

You can say, "I agree. &gt;&gt; I agree." How many here in this congregation feel that they have been moved to develop those resources that God has placed within them? That encourages me cuz I know that there'll be a change within the whole atmosphere of the congregation. Oh God, &gt;&gt; whatever it takes, &gt;&gt; refine us, &gt;&gt; mold us, &gt;&gt; break us, &gt;&gt; break us, &gt;&gt; shape us, &gt;&gt; put us in the oven once again if needs be.

I told brother Dalton the other day, I remember a certain meeting that we were in, special convention meeting, just asked him to come up and sing a song and I so missed it. I just so missed it. You know, we It's like taking a drink, like taking a drink out of a cool fountain of water. Here another hear the spirit of God to use that gift for the glory of God. [Music] We had a little gathering the other night for brother Ricardo and his mother and father were there. So nice to have them visiting you. sister was there and I don't know how many of you were here watch night service but I your father was here that service brother Ricardo and uh I was shaking his hand I didn't know didn't know brother Ricardo's father had ever been here been in church have to forgive me for that and he probably doesn't know this means anything but I'd had a song in my mind for probably a couple of days. It was I wonder if I've done my best for Jesus. And I just didn't know exactly what to do with it. And sometime I call on my wife that night. I felt a call on my sister and I just looked at Ann. I said I sometimes I fail to do something a little different. She was, you know, go for it. Go for it. And I looked real hard at her, you know, a little bit different. I said, well, you know, and she said, you folks didn't see all that, but I did. I said, well, no, I want you to come up. And what you don't know is some of you do or you don't know, my sister just had an operation down the side of her face. Long up, quite long. and they removed a a cyst. They didn't know but what it was cancerous. She had just had that operation just a few days before. So I knew I was pushing the envelope by asking you to come up and sing. But I felt so strong. And brother Ricardo, I want you to tell your daddy. He doesn't know what that meant to me. The other night I was just shaking hands with him at Ricardo's birthday and he said I was in the service watch night. I wanted you to hear this an I want the congregation to hear it. And he said you had someone I believe it was your sister. He said come up and sing. I said yes that was my sister. He said it was very moving. So I was moved. Thank him for me. have that touched me and I'm sure it means something to you an in the simplicity and perhaps with the difficulty the operation affected her throat a bit at the time still got up and sang &gt;&gt; I wonder if I done my best for Jesus I'd like you to go out from this congregation this morning knowing God's real &gt;&gt; God's close and believe me you're rich. You are rich. Rich in Christ. God bless you. Brother DJ pleased with you. Come and pray God's blessing upon us. And we're going to be refreshed and come tonight. Brother Tom Ray will be ministering.
