Are you all happy? &gt;&gt; Good. Ready to hear the word? &gt;&gt; We want to have prayer and we're going to pray for our sister, sister Felina Drossst. And she's in the hospital, but brother Tony and brother John Andy's went to pray with her. And uh we understand that she really stabilized and so much so that her son, brother Arnold Drossst, is here and he's a pastor from Chadam, Ontario. Brother Dross, would you just raise your hand so you know there? We're happy to have you this evening. God bless you. Brother Arnold Dross was at his mother's side. He's a minister of this message. Was standing there and and has said that she took her off of oxygen and so he came here to service tonight. God bless you, brother. Appreciate having you. Is your wife with you? All right. God bless you. Hi. You're welcome. Welcome. Well, I say that Sister Felina Dross is a real soldier. &gt;&gt; When I heard she was very weak and very low and the family had gathered, uh there's one thing I could say of her. She's probably one of the most perceptive and most desirous of women that I've met in the message. Just eager to hear the next little tidbit. Anything you've got. She reminds me a wee bit of uh Sister Glattis Dao that way. She just if you're with her, she wants to hear what you know, almost like wanting to pull it out of you. And I appreciate that. She's a wonderful woman. Brother Dross, we'll just have prayer. How lovely you are, Father. How lovely you are. And we are able to come this evening and say, "Our Father, which art in heaven, Lord, we are your children." &gt;&gt; And uh we do not know our next footstep, but you do know it. You know the beginning from the end. We're so thankful tonight, Lord, that our sister Dross has been strengthened and and brother Arnold and his wife, oh God, are able to be with us in service tonight. And I pray that there will be a just uh uh an illumination of grace. And may the pillar of fire be in attendance where our sister is resting just now. We pray that you'd speak to every member of the family, oh God, and give them the strength and the comfort, oh God, and let them know also, oh God, that here's a mother that has lived a life and lived a testimony and she's been amongst us, oh God, and fellowshipped around the word. We thank you for that. Pray that you'll give our brother George Dross, Lord. Give him the courage. Give him the comfort. Give him and grant him the faith, Father, at this moment. And we thank you for this answer, Lord. How many times your prophet said that just go thanking him now. I have no question in my mind that our sister Felina is thanking you. And there's a uh within her within her lips, Lord, and within her mouth is a thanksgiving to you for your goodness to her this evening. Lord, we need your goodness. We need your Holy Spirit. We need your presence. We need, oh God, that outpouring, that anointing that you will pour through myself, Father, whatever you would have to have poured in to the individual, Lord. And I pray there will be a place made and a channel open, oh God, let the fountain, oh God, be opened, I pray. and let everyone receive what they have need of tonight. And as we've already prayed in the study this evening that the sheep will be fed in the name of Jesus Christ. These are your sheep, Lord. They are this is your fold and I pray that you will bless us as we gather around the word tonight for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'll have you turn in your Bibles, please, to Isaiah the 61st chapter. and we will read uh verse two. I'll be reading verse one a little later on. No, perhaps we should read verse one as well, please. because it gives us the the spirit of the Lord. The spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek. He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn. I'm reading these verses which are so familiar to us. Then in Malachi uh 4th chapter verse 5 and six, behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. I'm reading one verse out of Isaiah once again, the fourth chapter. And if you'd like to turn to it, it's the sixth verse. And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm, and from rain. I'd like if we would read that together because it's so personal to us. And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain. God bless you as you have your seats. I had a very very specific reason for reading these uh verses. I'm going to approach a thought that I have never spoken in in my memory unless my memor is real short. I don't think it's that short. I don't believe I've ever spoken on this subject in my life. And I'm going to speak on the day of vengeance. There's a couple things that are I've been pondering and meditating on and I'm going to present it to you this evening, the Lord willing. When Isaiah said that uh we have a place of refuge and for a covert, those are similar words, but a refuge is a shelter from storm, from danger. And listen closely. And a protection from falsehood. That's an important one. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of refuge we need. This is a refuge. It's a shelter from storm where we come through tempestuous times. It's also they can be dangerous times. And we have a refuge. We have protection. And I can tell you that God has protected you when you didn't even know what was happening. And it's also a protection from falsehood. And that one I'm very grateful for tonight. &gt;&gt; If it was not for that, we would get into a lot of error and falsehood because we don't have the sufficient balance within ourselves. We thank God for the Holy Spirit that gives us the protection from falsehood. And then the covert. It's a covert. And for a covert from storm and from rain. And a covert is to be hidden. We are hid with Christ in God. We are hidden. We are concealed. And it is to be concealed. And to hide carefully. It's not something you just hide quickly. But we have been hidden very carefully, very purposefully by God in Christ. And so that really gives a a a well-rounded out uh picture of our protection and what Isaiah is speaking of here. And the reason I am approaching this and spoke of Malachi and also out of Isaiah because you remember you that are believers and are familiar with the message uh and all those that are streaming tonight. We pray God bless them. But when Jesus in the fourth chapter of Luke and he stood up in the synagogue as was his it was his that was his what he did uh that was his uh custom the Bible says and he stood up for it to read and the book of Isaiah was given to him the scroll and he found the place and read Isaiah 1 and2 only he he uh only read half of chapter of the second verse rather to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. And the Bible says, "And he closed the book and gave it back to the minister to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord." And I looked into the uh I have Hebrew Bibles and it's really is worded wonderfully when it speaks of uh to to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. In the Hebrew, it's worded this way, to proclaim the year of acceptance of Jehovah. And that puts a completely different slant on it because what what Jesus was doing to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, he's proclaiming that that he has been accepted of Jehovah. This is the accepted one. And that's why the Bible says also we are accepted in the beloved because he was accepted. You are accepted. &gt;&gt; I would like to say that the ministry that brother Brandham had in this day which was not his ministry just in particular you can't separate the message from the messenger. But the thing that I kind of closed on, if perhaps I can have you uh go back to to Sunday, is that there never been a ministry quite like this. And in this aspect, which I did not mention, that ministry never failed to be accepted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire. I mentioned this to you. the pillar of fire. Whether it was Bombay or Durban or Johannesburg or Germany or Switzerland or up in the Scandinavian countries or in Finland or any any place in North America, wherever it was, that pillar of fire came in attendance and let you and I know that that ministry was accepted by Almighty God because he's the only one who can do that supernatural &gt;&gt; and he's the only one. And he said, you know, if if what I've said is the truth, then let him come and prove that it's the truth. And and then I if God uh if God were to lead us astray and then a bunch of falsehood was preached and he came in behind and and gave evidence to it, what kind of a God would that be? He gave evidence to it because it was the truth that we were hearing. &gt;&gt; And and herein is our faith and our confidence. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he was accepted to proclaim the year not only the acceptable year but to proclaim the year of acceptance of Jehovah. And he closed the book. But then the rest of the book says and the day of vengeance of our God. And Malachi says and the day the dreadful day of the Lord. So I want to uh address those two. Uh we are living presently and you walked into this church this evening from the world that you were engaged in. But this world has been indicted &gt;&gt; by this accepted ministry. &gt;&gt; It's under indictment. &gt;&gt; Want your attention please. As little movement as possible. The world has come under indictment. The prophet has already said, "I indict this generation." I'll read those for you. But you know what? It doesn't really look like it's indicted. People aren't really living like they're under the shadows of judgment. &gt;&gt; They're just doing okay. &gt;&gt; And you know why? Because also the prophet said this is the most deceptive age. &gt;&gt; So now we have in this age has come a light a true light. &gt;&gt; And the only light that is actually true light happens to be a promise of God that is set for a certain time and then God manifests it. That is light and God spoke and that is light. God's word manifested is light. &gt;&gt; But you know there's a lot of artificial lights. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of artificial lights. Satan has a whole myriad of artificial lights. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham calls them glare. &gt;&gt; They're a glare. People are living in a glare. He tied it right to a denominational system. I would say if a if the denomination is a false light, there's multitudes of false lights. &gt;&gt; We were driving here this evening and there was very unusual sky and the moon was just peeking over some very very dark storm clouds and it was just a a magnificent site. We began to talk about, you know, the people of ancient times and how they looked into the heavens and saw all the different uh all the different configurations of the stars and and studied it and very wise people. But today, you can hardly see, you know, the stars because we've got so much artificial light in Satan's Eden. And so in the natural world, even in the natural world, you can't even see the beauty as it really is because Satan has produced us in Satan's Eden so much artificial light that we don't we rarely look up there. But people in ancient times, they always look to the heavens. &gt;&gt; They were always studying the heavens &gt;&gt; and it meant something to them. But today in the spiritual sense, Satan has he's a master of deception &gt;&gt; and he's produced so much artificial light that people don't really feel as though they're groping in darkness. &gt;&gt; One of the other promises which we have is regarding death itself. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. And Paul said, "So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory." This is the promise of God. This is for believers. But do you know that Satan has so crafted, he's such a master of deception that those that are walking in darkness and those that are walking in death, &gt;&gt; they don't really have a great fear of it. &gt;&gt; They don't really fear it because they have a false promise. &gt;&gt; They have a false concept. and Satan has mastered at at giving them a a false hope. There's all kinds of people, they don't really fear death. It's incredible walking in the day of in the day of vengeance. It's it's actually here, friends. &gt;&gt; We're walking in that day. and and Satan has also succeeded in making the people's minds numb. I would say that probably television and the technology that is in the world now and it's also directed to the youth. It's not technology to help skilled people to be better equipped for their jobs and that also. But the big thing today, you know, is young people, children, young children, and they get all kinds of games and videos. Oh, we might think that that isn't really something that needs to be spoken about over the pulpit, but I'll tell you one thing. It starts to it starts to affect their minds. &gt;&gt; It starts to affect their brain and they see all kinds of violent things happening and so violence doesn't mean a whole lot to them. &gt;&gt; Right here in our city of Suri, which is not news to anybody that lives here, but but six people just blown away here in apartment the other day. Six people killed. They don't have anybody. And a and a man from uh I believe it's from the North View Menite Church, but he's from Abbottzford. Happened to be a repairman. He's just repairing a fireplace. Just their innocent man. Could be any man from here. Two children, family. Pastor got up and spoke of him. Just a wonderful man of the community. just because he happened to be there repairing when they came in to do away with these other men and they just shot him too. And someone else from an apartment upstairs, a young man, he happened to be in the wrong place the wrong time shot him too. They're just gone. Well, sure that you know the community is shocked and it's a it's a terrible tragedy, etc., etc., but you know what? tomorrow morning's newspaper will have some other tragedy &gt;&gt; and we just we just go on from there because we're numbed by the whole thing. That's the age that we're in. That's actually the age that we're in. &gt;&gt; But can people for a moment even begin to grasp? No, I say they cannot grasp what it is to die without God. And to slip out into eternity without God, that is the most I can't even comprehend. I can't comprehend anyone even sitting in the house of God such as we are this evening. And with that prospect of even like some I've even heard say, well, you know, if I miss the rapture, I got the tribulation. You know, I'll make it. Don't count on that. &gt;&gt; And so, he has made artificial lights. He has glamorized the world through glamour and through pleasure and a multitude of false religions. He's made a dark place, not so very dark. He's made a place that's actually under the judgment of all almighty God. And I I can tell you that's a master of deception when they can have a whole generation indicted. &gt;&gt; But they don't feel that. They don't feel that way. &gt;&gt; And you and I are around them every day. And we're in that. The one thing I don't want to and it came as a really a sharp thought to me. We don't want to as believers move around in the world and be also numbed by the fact that or influenced by the fact that this world really isn't that bad. It's a very vile place. &gt;&gt; And we're not here just to complain and whine about the place. We're here to recognize that we're only transient. We're just moving through. We don't want to get too uh too rooted down. We don't want to get too uh you know what I mean, too close to anything. We want to be able to hold things loosely because we're just traveling through. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said and identified Christ of all ages. He said the the greatest marker of villains in the age in the world that we live in is a false light in this hour that we're living in trying to put us back under some kind of creed and things when we're when we're living epistles &gt;&gt; or otherwise we are epistles that's living &gt;&gt; that's been written and now living out the word of God as he promised in the hour. That's why Jesus said you are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; He said he was the light of the world. And a revelation says of the bride of the new Jerusalem and her light. Her light was it was a marvelous light. &gt;&gt; It's a word light. &gt;&gt; It's not a creed light. &gt;&gt; It's not just a doctrine light. &gt;&gt; It's not just I believe light. It's what he has said and what he has confirmed. It's a it's a living light. And we are epistles written that's been living out. Now Isaiah said to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God. And Ephesians said to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the in the beloved. He said in to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. and he closed the book like we've had we've had 2,000 years now over 2,000 years or thereabouts of being accepted. Oh, I I I want to say also where uh where we read out of out of Malachi that he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers. It's almost a paradox because that is happening turning the heart of the children back to the fathers right in a day where it says be I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day. If this is true if if this is a time and we are a people having our hearts turned back to the faith of our fathers the rest of the verse also must be true hold true that it is a dreadful day. It's not just an average day. We can talk about, you know, Luther's time and all that. That wasn't the dreadful day. &gt;&gt; The dreadful day is associated with a message turning the hearts of the children back to the fathers. This is a dreadful day because it's under the actually under the judgment of almighty God because God has already sentenced it. I looked in the Bible and my mind went sweeping over the scriptures and different accounts that I I I recall of God's dealings with his people and you know uh they went away from God and God allowed them to go into captivity. He allowed them to be slaves. He allowed them. Look at the children of Israel. Went out of that slavery, went out of that terrible bondage of Egypt and were not far distant when they were hankering and yearning to go back. &gt;&gt; Do you know why? It just didn't seem that bad. &gt;&gt; It was terrible, but it didn't seem that bad. And that is the way, you know, we don't want to get accustomed &gt;&gt; to the environment. Amen. &gt;&gt; The environment is a judged environment. &gt;&gt; The environment is a day of vengeance of our God. Not just a day of vengeance, but a day of vengeance of our God. We don't want to become comfortable &gt;&gt; with a judgment with a a generation that is under the indictment &gt;&gt; of Almighty God. We ought to be able to hear in our ears. I indict this generation. We might get accustomed to the thump thump and the boom boom and the nakedness on the street and all of these things. We get accustomed to it because we say it all the time and we're prone to become accustomed to it. But when you say it, you want to just hear those words. I indict this generation. You see a church on every corner and there a little sign out there and all the rest of it, but in behind that nice sign and in behind that nice landscaping, in behind that nice building is a creed, is a doctrine that's damning souls. &gt;&gt; Is it true? &gt;&gt; Thus, it's a day of vengeance of our God. And that's what God sees. &gt;&gt; And that's why God has taken that position. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why God has spoken it that way. &gt;&gt; He closed the book when he said he claimed to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. and he closed the book because this was the this was the time now when favor and good will and grace and they says when we beheld him full of grace and truth this was that was that era and that's what was going to happen pouring out of grace and truth and mercy and the door was opening and the Bible says uh concerning learning out of out of Malachi that before I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great not dreadful but now the great and I think we need to look at that we just need to look at the great day of the Lord and the acceptable year of the Lord it is a acceptable it was a it's a a a re a desired redemption that's what made it acceptable but it's a great time because it's large in magnitude it is large in numbers number. It's large in great things. It is to grow, to become powerful, to do great things. And you read the book of Acts and you can't you can't go very far in the book of Acts before you'd have to say it was a great day. &gt;&gt; It was a great time. The Holy Spirit came in a great time. Look at the ministry. Look at the ministry that we we have received. Look at the ministry that has taken place under that humble prophet voice. &gt;&gt; Look what's happened. &gt;&gt; It's great. &gt;&gt; I can never never become accustomed to simply relegating and putting it on the average shelf when I hear and I'll never never cease speaking about it. To me it is so marvelous. And today again I I read and I absorbed when he's coming right to the point saying and and I don't know what the rest of the message was or how the people were responding but because it was in 63 I don't expect it was all that well. And he and it was just like a semi-challenge he was making and saying that now we'll just see. would just see and he just started out and he picked it up. He said, "I didn't guess that. Don't do that. I didn't guess that." Imagine people sitting in that very atmosphere and still could have that attitude. How much more even even here we don't have that kind of spectacular demonstration. I say God is doing it. He does it in his own way, but he's not doing it where he raised a one man up for that kind of ministry. And those that tried to duplicate that got followers after themselves and it became a personality thing. We're not following a personality. We're following the word that came out of that mouth. Do you accept that? &gt;&gt; So then he took spoke to the woman directly said, "You you got a dark shadows falling you and you got cancer and you got cancer in both breasts. And furthermore, you didn't come from here. You didn't come from this city. You've come from a cold place. You've come from Colorado and your name is such and such and told her name. I'll never I can never take that and put that up on a shelf and just say that's ordinary. &gt;&gt; I say that's this age of grace &gt;&gt; is going out on the most unusual greatness &gt;&gt; magn magnificent &gt;&gt; ministry. And to think that I got called under that, you got called under that. And we ought to be the most thankful people in the world. We got called under that, &gt;&gt; under the consummation, under the at the climax of it. &gt;&gt; And the reason God did that is because there had to be warning before judgment. &gt;&gt; We come right under that warning ministry. And what comes right on right follows right after it follows right immediately after it the day of vengeance. And we most of most of us here came right up in that time. We're living in the day of vengeance. But Satan, here's my message now. Satan has been so cunning so as to make it that it does not appear to be that. &gt;&gt; Does not appear to be indicted. does not appear to be the day of vengeance. Does not appear to be a dreadful day. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think I will just read this quote. I closed on last Sunday with it. We may talk about the vindication of the ministry, but why it was, what it was for. He promised in the last days that the church would grow so close from the days of Luther and justification and Wesley and sanctification, the days of Pentecost and the restoration of the gifts right into the headstone and through that would bring forth the whole body, the resurrection of every believer. Now you know I have my confidence and my faith I got it hooked right into these kind of words. It makes me feel very very I won't say important but it makes me feel as though the time that God has allowed us to live in a time when we have been uh taken and swallowed right up and embraced by a message that's going to bring forth the resurrection that it actually is it says uh that it'll take it right into the headstone and through that would bring forth the whole body the resurrection of every believer because I've read this many times and perhaps you have not in proving his word and if you want to mark it down it's paragraph 235 and he said that you'll remember this from Sunday. That was not Jesus talking to Abraham that could discern the thoughts of Sarah's mind behind him. That was not Jesus. He'd not yet been born. But it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim. Elohim the great Almighty. And Jesus said, "As I was, as it was in the days of Sodom, now watch close. In the days of Sodom, so will it be in the coming of the Son of Man. when the son of man is being revealed. So that's been that's taken place. Not no more as a church, not no more, but the bride's called. In that day, the son of man will be revealed. That's the same time as the bride has been called. In that day, the son of man will be revealed. And he asked the question, what? to join the church to the head. Unite the marriage of the bride. The bridegroom, the bridegroom call will come right through this. Don't we talk about a ministry, people talk about brother Brandham's ministry, etc. I just want you to lay that aside for a moment and forget all of that. forget of all that you've ever heard and known and just kept this one line that says that the bridegroom call, the bridegroom call will come right through this. He's described the ministry. He said now the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the true together. That's the whole purpose of the ministry. And furthermore, I will say that is really the summon substance of the reason God ever called you into this word &gt;&gt; to unite you, unite you into Christ, to unite the two together. He said, "See, it's the son of it's the son of man, Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one, the bride." And then she'll go home to the wedding supper. She's already united. &gt;&gt; And we go to the wedding supper, not to the marriage. She's already united because he came right through this. And what was coming through that was the bridegroom call. So some saw miracles and some wanted healings and some wanted this and some they they simply wanted they laid hold of something that maybe brother Brandham said that kind of he talked about the oneness of the Godhead. They said, "Oh yeah, we're oneness. We believe that all the time." That wasn't it at all. &gt;&gt; That wasn't it at all. that was only a part of the overall message and they get a hold of that and just run off with it. He may talk about gifts and they'd run off with that. He talk about maybe baptism in Jesus' name. Brother Brandon wasn't the first person to baptize the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Multitudes did that. I knew people long before I knew the message. In fact, this debated and argued with me that had to be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, but I didn't have any revelation about it. So there were people that were doing it doing it before, but they didn't have they still had a denominational seed. &gt;&gt; They still had a denominational seed. It was not it was not some unique or or revelation that God had had just uh had had set in the form of a message. Then he said also that the true bride will be made up of thousands times thousands of people. But it will be the elect out of every church age. Every time a message went forth and the people believed it, accepted it all, accepted it in all the light it was when they were when they were sealed away until the day of redemption. And so the bride is made up of brother Brandham experience going beyond the curtain of time. He said there were thousands times thousands which are millions of people. He said one place it looked like millions &gt;&gt; that were there and that was just from his age. &gt;&gt; These were his people. &gt;&gt; The angel said these are your people these Brandhams. No these are people that these are your converts to Christ. Now, what about the bride through all the ages? &gt;&gt; Just multitudes and multitudes of people. &gt;&gt; So, that's what the message has come to do in our time. Now, but now both the day of vengeance, I just want to do the little turn now. Both the day of vengeance and the dreadful day are upon us. I'm I'm going to say some things. I want to stay close to my note because these are notes that I just have come out of my heart as of in the last, you know, day or two. Satan has refined bondage in Satan's Eden. He's refined bondage till it doesn't seem to be bondage. We're actually in a generation of slavery. &gt;&gt; People are enslaved to material things. They're enslaved to enslaved to their job. They're enslaved to all kinds of things. They're enslaved to we can talk about sports. They can talk about religion. &gt;&gt; It's a generation of slaves. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, I'm glad that I'm speaking to a group of people tonight that that I think for the most part believe that and see that. &gt;&gt; But if you would go and speak to them, they don't feel that they're in slavery. They don't feel that way. Why? Because Satan has refined the bondage. &gt;&gt; They don't feel like they're in darkness because Satan has produced artificial lights. They don't feel that they're indicted. What are you talking about? I'm I've got things going for me. I've got this is a you know I I feel good today. Dreadful, fearful to be afraid and to stand in awe. Vengeance. vengeance by God. God has taken vengeance. And there are times when he went to avenge himself, but the people didn't realize it. And this is what I want you to see. I probably don't have have time tonight, so I won't I won't approach it, but there's a very very strange very very strange scripture, and I've been wanting to preach on it. I've touched on it some months ago, but it really takes some I think it takes a spiritual atmosphere and a special uh just a special moment. But even even here when I went into the uh into the Hebrew regarding vengeance, it said vengeance by God, by Samson, and by the enemies of Judah. God coming to avenge himself through Samson was very very rare, very strange. And the Bible says he saw a woman of Timnath. How many remember I ever mentioned this to you? He saw a woman of Timnath of the Philistines and he desired her and he come back to his parents and said, "Get me this woman for my wife." They were distressed. What are you talking about Hebrew man with? You've never had a razor touch your head. You're a Nazerite. What are you talking about taking a woman of the Philistines as a wife? He said, "But she pleases me. Get her. Get her." And he wouldn't give up on it. And the Bible says that his mother and his father did not know that God was seeking to avenge himself to the Philistines. such a strange way &gt;&gt; to avenge himself. &gt;&gt; This is why it takes a spiritual mind. You really want to get into it into the depth of it. That word to avenge it is like it is like a a man that is driven by a sexual passion. and that there's no turning back. He's going to he's going to achieve this goal. And the Bible says the Bible says it was God God was going to avenge. He had his eyes set on avenging himself for what the Philistines have done to Israel. But Israel didn't realize it. They didn't realize it. Is what I'm saying to you friends is in a day of vengeance. God has set on a course. &gt;&gt; He has set on a course to destroy the wickedness of this world. &gt;&gt; We have become numb. We hear of the bombing and the slaughter and the killing and the raping and the all of these things. We become numb because we've been right in this environment. But let us not lose sight of God's goal. &gt;&gt; He's going to destroy it for this wickedness. &gt;&gt; And it needs to be said. It needs to be said. We need to have our our senses really sharpened and honed to realize that the things that we accept, God hates. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The things we become accustomed to, God hates it. &gt;&gt; The scripture says of Jesus that he loved righteousness and and conjunction word hated iniquity. &gt;&gt; Both of those things. We become very very accustomed to it. &gt;&gt; We see it everywhere. We hear it everywhere. &gt;&gt; We view it everywhere. &gt;&gt; And it's just like it's permeating you. It's it's like the kingdom of darkness and the kingdom of of of Satan just imposing this on the people on the people until until we we ourselves don't see it and view it as God's word has said it. And then we may hear a message. And we were just talking about this driving here to church and my wife had just was listening this afternoon to wave a true prophet. She said it just he said he just blasted just on and on blasted this denomination world. I said, "Well, you don't know what I'm speaking on tonight because it's a false light." &gt;&gt; Had to cry out against it. and the way the women wear and and and you go back, the Bible says that when God would turn the people and Israel would would disobey God and go after other gods and then God would turn his back on them. They didn't realize it. They didn't realize that they were in a state of going into bondage. Do you know when they went into bondage? We talk about Babylon. Babylon. They went into the bondage of Babylon. They set up businesses. They succeeded. They prospered. They learned a new language. They became completely absorbed and and assimilated in Babylon to when they were finally delivered. All of the Jews didn't come home. &gt;&gt; They said, "We're fine in this bondage. This bondage is okay. &gt;&gt; This isn't a bad country. This isn't a bad place. We've prospered. We've done all right." But they didn't see it how God saw it. We don't want to lose sight of how God saves this generation. &gt;&gt; Live our lives, do our things, work our jobs. That's what we need to do. But don't lose sight of how God sees it. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the scripture says, "And it came to pass uh when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves." Now, you see, this is what I want you to see. It isn't that God comes down with fury upon the people. When he sees people and they go after other gods or they go after the world or whatever more, you know what? God just kind of stands back. And the Bible says he let them go their own ways. He let them be a law to themselves. That's the way you want to go. It's like a father, a mother, parents to a child. All right? That's what you want to do. Fine. You go your own way. You'll find out after a while. It's not just exactly how you view it. And the Bible says they corrupted themselves. Brother Brandham talks is it's not the, you know, it's not the bruise on the apple or whatever from the outside, but it's the worm from within that makes it rotten. And so they corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them. They ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way. and the anger of the Lord. The reason I'm bringing this to you is not so much to the congregation present, but that the congregation present and the congregation that's is streaming that they might that we might have our vision focused that we might see things as God sees it. &gt;&gt; And I think it's essential. &gt;&gt; I think it's important. I think it's important as children in a home as they grow up that they begin to see things as the parents see it. &gt;&gt; The the vision of the parents needs to be you know uh uh brought into the view of the children so the children can see as the parents see. I'm speaking now that parents are are are real godly believers. And the Bible says, "And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel. And he said, because that this people hath transgressed my covenant, which I commanded their fathers, and have hearkened have not hearkened unto my voice, I also will not henceforth drive out from before them the nations other of nations which Joshua left when he died." There were several nations that Joshua left when he died. And God said he was going to leave them to try the people. And now the people turned away from God. And so God said, "I'm going to leave them here. &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave these nations here, and I will also not henceforth drive out any of these nations." And and he says, "And through them I may prove Israel whether they will keep the word and the way of the Lord to walk therein as their fathers did keep it or not." Therefore the Lord left those nations without driving them out hastily. Neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua. Peter says, "But these," speaking of of of of some, he said, "But these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that are that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption." It's not God. I don't want you to say, we talk about the day of vengeance. I don't want you to think that God is just pouring out wrath upon the earth. The vengeance that I really want you to see is that God draws back. &gt;&gt; And I would too if I were God. If I send the very best I could, if I would send the actual duplicate ministry of Jesus Christ and reveal the son of man and do the same works &gt;&gt; and the people refuse to hear, &gt;&gt; I draw back too and say, "Let you wallow in your own sin. &gt;&gt; Let your wallow have what you want." Remember that the children of Israel came out and the Bible says, see if I can read it here in Psalms. I have quite a bit of scripture to read. You're listening good in in Psalms in 78. I'm reading from verse 18. And and here's David now. He's rehearsing about the children of Israel. And he's a king. He's rehearsing what happened to them. And they tempted God in their heart by asking me for their lust or for their desire. Yay, they spake against God. They said, "Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? Behold, he smoked the rock that waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Can he provide flesh for this people?" Therefore, the Lord heard this. &gt;&gt; They were saying it, but the Lord heard it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord heard it and he was wroth. And so a fire was kindled against Jacob and the anger also came up against Israel. Now watch how a fire was kindled. Watch how it happened. They asked for flesh and God gave it to them. That's how it happened. And because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation, though he had though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, and rained down mana upon them to eat, and had given them the corn of heaven, and man did eat angels food. He sent them meat to the full. He caused an east wind to blow in heaven. Hey, this is this is God of wrath. I can hear by your silence. You don't know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; This is a God of wrath. This is how it's happening. &gt;&gt; He's giving them what they want. &gt;&gt; If you hanker and yearn and whine and whatever more, God will give it to you. &gt;&gt; It may not be the very best thing for you, but if you want it and you crave for it, God will give it to you. And sometimes people go their own direction and they find that they they become entangled and then and snared and and changed bond, you know, it's such a they get into bonds because they've gone their own direction. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And he caused the east wind to blow from heaven and by his power he brought in the south wind and he rained he reigned flesh also upon him." This is this is God's filled with displeasure and he's given them mana and he's given them water and he's given them all these things but they said uh you know can God give us a table in the wilderness and God heard it he heard it and he rained flesh upon them as dust and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea and he let it fall in the midst of their camp around about their habitations ations. So they did eat and they were filled and he gave them their own desire. He gave them their own desire. Th this was actually God's anger was being displayed. He gave them their own desire because their desire sometimes the things that we crave for aren't all that good for us. It's not really the best, &gt;&gt; but we crave for it and we yearn for it and we pull for it and we whine for it and and we complain for it and we just are so bent on a certain direction. Finally, God says, "Okay, that's what you want. I'll give it to you." Sometimes people who desired success, success isn't always the best thing. Few people can handle success. &gt;&gt; Success can be a very very deceptive thing. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says of a minister, now I'm coming to the pulpit. Says of a minister, God gives him a good ministry gives him success. Congregation of people. He's loved. He's just really, you know, he finds a place in their hearts. And he says and he he has a ministry and he has a place and he he he's loved by the people and he gets a feeling that he's he's has almost immunity. &gt;&gt; He can almost do anything he says and get away with it. What was it? Success. There isn't any minister stand behind the pulpit and wants to be a failure. &gt;&gt; He wants to, you know, succeed in what he's attempting to do. He wants to get behind the pulpit even in preaching a service. He wants to get the message across what's in his heart. He wants to get it across. I've talked to ministers many many in my day and they they were able to handle the growth. They were able to handle the you know the the church as God blessed it. But then you know one I spoke to and he just said I I was so close to the people so close and then finally when I couldn't devote the same kind of time he said I think the people became unhappy and and most of them left me and that that particular brother had a nervous breakdown he couldn't handle he could handle the success but he couldn't handle the effect of it and I and the effect it had on him. I don't know if I'd be able to handle it either. It was very very hard for him. And so uh the Bible says here that he gave them their desire and they were not he said they were not in stranged from their lust. Even that didn't it strains them from their lust or from their desire. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, while they still had the meat in their mouth, of the thing they so yearned for and called for and complained that they thought God couldn't do it, but while the meat was still in their mouth, the wrath of God came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smoked down the chosen men of Israel. For all this they sinned still. &gt;&gt; Isn't this incredible? &gt;&gt; Isn't this incredible? and believed not for his wondrous works. Therefore their days did did he consume in vanity and their years in trouble when he slew them. Then they then they sought him and they returned and inquired early after God and they remembered that God was their rock and the high God their redeemer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God achieves his purpose. God achieves his end. But I say, why do people have to go through that? &gt;&gt; Why do they have to go through that? &gt;&gt; And here was the message. My wife was listening rather a message that I was reading earlier today about Amos. And Amos is the prophet that is in the way of a true prophet. He said he lived to see his prophecy. Do we have a few more minutes? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going I'm not going to keep you long. He lived to see his prophecy. But when Amos spoke of that city, how it was going to happen, how God was going to cause the Syrians to come in and take them over and so forth like that, and how their corruption would eat them up, how their corruption would eat them up. He said, "Why?" I believe he said if it's right now, I'm looking down here upon the scripture. And if I've got this counted right, it's around 50 years after Amos prophesied. And now, what do you think? A whole generation passed before Amos's prophecy came to pass. And if you read it over, it tells you. And it happened just exactly word by word what he said. John saw the book of Revelation. It never happened in his day. But we we see it coming to pass just exactly. Daniel prophesied in his day of of his day and all down through. He never lived to say it. He said, "Go your way, Daniel. Shut up the book and close the book and you'll sleep in your lot." But uh but at the at that day you'll stand. He said, "Now you don't always God strikes as soon as he prophesies." God doesn't always strike as soon as he prophesies. Amos says, "Prophesize. I prophecy I said 50 years later it came to pass and how many things that the messenger has spoken hasn't come to pass. We've just seen the world go on. We've seen things just you know uh uh shall we say develop and evolve and we've saw all the advancement and all the scientific achievements and all the things and even in the message we've seen what's been happening. We're a part of it and I think person just has to go on and put their best efforts to it and do everything we can while God gives us life and God gives us strength but never become accustomed to the fact of what's been prophesied shall surely come to pass. &gt;&gt; And what's been spoken surely how the prophet of God described this generation it is that is the condition that God sees it in. Amen. &gt;&gt; A minister hearing brother Brandham speak and this is in the message here ye him minister was telling brother Brandham uh and he said brother Brandham do you know why your ministry is not the greatest ministry in America today and I said I don't care what it is in America. I want to know what it is in the books in heaven &gt;&gt; up there. What it is there. That's what he want to know. And this man said, this minister said, well, I'll tell you, it's because you rebuke the people in such a way and said, you ball them out and it hurts them. He said, if you just stop doing that, says then your ministry would grow and so forth. And I said, "Sir, let me tell you something. When it comes to a place that I have to compromise on the word of God, then I'll stop and leave the field and let God call somebody else to do it." How can you hold your peace? And that was his question. How can you hold your peace? When we see when we when I see the things that our young people are subjected to when I see the things that are ex that we're exposed to whether it be whether it be newspaper or whether it be internet or whether it be whatever whatever it is whether it be by music or whether it be by you know just uh uh the the your peers or your contact and and the brothers and the sisters you know it's just it's it's indescribable and I do not have the words. I do not have the vocabulary but the atmosphere that the Satan has so permeated. This is his Eden &gt;&gt; and he permeates every aspect of life trying to press and trying to permeate trying to affect our minds or to cause us to think in a certain a certain direction, a certain way to to uh look at things a certain way to and and and just like Delilah and Samson wore him down day after day, day after day until finally and if you read the account, it's It's really sad because he started he started tell her, you know, well, if you bind me and he got closer and closer and closer until finally he got to to his hair and gave her the secret. This tells me we do have we do have a special secret with God. We do have a special connection. And there's all kinds of people that have enough intelligence and sense in this world. They see the clarity of a person's nature. They see the integrity that is admirable. They see the kind of life and the kind of family. Listen friends, &gt;&gt; I just tell you, not that I have to tell you, but the world is in such a state. My grandson, Wesley Ordeal, filled out an application quite some time ago to a very, very large international corporation, Richie Brothers Auctioneers. this some years ago, a few years ago, he filled out and in that application he had to relate about his family and all the connections and his grandparents or whatever more and his brother and his sister and their family and his mother and his dad and all that. And when the people who are re who are actually analyzing and and looking at this man's uh uh his background and the family and everything, they called him in and they essentially didn't believe it. They didn't believe it because this is just h how do you have a marriage hanging together for 30 years and how do you have someone else that's married and they're not divorced and this one's not divorced and that one's not divorced and how can you come? It didn't seem real to them and they queried him very very specifically upon that application and found out that everything was true &gt;&gt; and offered him the job. &gt;&gt; You know, I may be speaking from a little different perspective than where you sit and the life that you live, but I meet a lot of people. I I speak to a lot of people. I'm called from a lot of different places. And I can tell you the world is a very sick world. &gt;&gt; And I am not speaking from a negative position. I'm speaking now from a scriptural position. This is what the word of God has said. And it shall wax worse and worse. Don't look for it to get better. It shall wax worse and worse. And God shall fold it up like a garment and put it away. That's the thus says the word of God. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And I just thought tonight it would be essential for us to hear something from this direction. We speak of the of of the ministry that God has sent, the message that God has sent and what that has done for us. And that is just wonderful. That is glorious and it's all true and we spend our time with it. But on the other hand, sometimes we become and don't don't don't look at me like it doesn't happen. We become afflicted by the environment and by what it is we encounter and it can have such an effect upon us sometime. It can it it's it's draining. The Bible says that it can be weary. It wearies us because you are affect I say don't be affected by it. That's the way it has to go. And when you see those things, say it's a generation under the day of vengeance of our God. &gt;&gt; It's a day of dreadful day. That's what God Don't be ashamed to use God's language. &gt;&gt; Elijah has come. &gt;&gt; And our hearts have been turned back to the fathers. But it happened in a dreadful time. &gt;&gt; God, give me words and give me ability &gt;&gt; to describe it. I was sent this and I'm sent uh and I'm just going to be a few minutes. I want to read a couple of things on a recent a recent trip I picked up on in the airlines at the airport or in the airplane. the International Herald Tribune and I think it's when brother Diddy and I were on our way to uh Congo and I picked up this and it was the 10th anniversary of Princess Diana and there was big things going on because she is uh been so loved by so many people and so on. And this man wrote, now this is a very very highly respected and a very conservative paper. It's a it's the international herald tribune and he wrote an article large article. I'm not going to read it off, but he calls it the blind cult of Princess Diana. and in the article and he brings it down and narrows it down to the beauty cult, the cult of beauty. And along in there, he said, "Consider the power of the beauty cult." This man is just an unbeliever. So I'm speaking to you tonight from the scripture perspective and from what the messenger has said concerning the generation. Now I'm going to read two or three articles for you to just to you know come to kind of where I'm at and get into my mindset. The people of the world they also identify it but don't have an answer. &gt;&gt; They don't have the other side. They don't have the spiritual side. They don't have the scriptural side. They have haven't got your advantage. &gt;&gt; And so this man says, "Consider the power of the beauty cult. America's network news, which once was serious, employ women whose makeup increasingly resembles the thickness of a death mask." The new NBC News financial reporter and he mentions her name is a younger version of CNBC's Money Honey and he mentions her name and is is ugled by the talk show host and he mentions another name and others who focus on her looks and not on what may be inside her head if anything. Cable networks employ Barbie doll wannabes who are blondes with short skirts and apparently little selfish self-respect. They are all interchangeable parts, virtually indistinguishable from one another. Most speak in cliches and have trouble at living anything that isn't written for them on the teleprompter. But the lip gloss and the hair look great. They are the fantasies of aging male management and middle school boys. Or am I being redundant? The Diana cult will continue until someone younger with a better story replaces her. The public always wants a better and younger story. And then he goes on to some others and he talks about a cults ultimately disappoint and the Diana cult will too. And Germaine Greet uh is Greer rather someone who wrote a book concludes by writing that Diana was a desperate woman seeking applause and no wonder so many still love her because they are seeking the same thing. This is a man of the world. I said he had quite good insight. &gt;&gt; A man by the name of Daryl Scott and whoever sent this to me, thank you. the father of Rachel Scott, a victim of the Coline High School shootings in Littleton, Colorado. He was invited to address the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee. And what he said to our national leaders during his special session of Congress was painfully truthful. They were not prepared for what he was to say, nor was it received well. It needs to be heard by every parent and every teacher, every politician, every sociologist, every psychologist, and every so-called expert. These courageous words spoken by Daryl Scott are powerful, penetrating, and deeply personal. There's no doubt that God sent this man as a voice crying in the wilderness. And the following is a portion of the transcript. Quote, "Since the dawn of creation, there has been both good and evil in the hearts of men and women, and we all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence." The death of my wonderful daughter, Rachel, Rachel Joyce Scott, and the deaths of that heroic teacher and the other 11 children who died must not be in vain. Their blood cries out for answers. The first recorded act of violence was when Cain slew his brother Abel out of the field. The villain was not the club he used. Neither is it the NCA, the National Club Association. The true killer was Cain. And the reason for the murder only can only be found in Kane's heart. In the days that followed the Columbine tragedy, I was amazed at how quickly fingers began to point at groups such as the NRA. I am not a member of the NRA. I'm not a hunter. I do not own a gun. I am not I am not here to represent or defend the NRA because I don't believe that they are responsible for my my daughter's death. Therefore, I do not believe that they need to be defended. If I believed they had anything to do with Rachel's murder, I would be the strongest opponent. I'm here today to declare that Columbine was not just a tragedy. It was a spiritual event that should be forcing us to look at where the real blame lies. Much of the blame lies here in this room. Much of the blame lies by the behind the pointing fingers of the accusers themselves. I wrote a poem just four nights ago that expresses my feelings best. This was written way before I knew I would be speaking here today. And here's what he said. Your laws ignore our deepest needs. Your words are empty air. You've stripped away our heritage. You've outlawed simple prayer. Now gunshots fill our classrooms and precious children die. You seek for answers everywhere and ask the reason why. You regulate restrictive laws through legislative creed. And yet you fail to understand that God is what we need. &gt;&gt; Men and women are three parts being. We all consist of body, mind, and spirit. And when we refuse to acknowledge the third part of our makeup, we create a void that allows evil prejudice and hatred to rush in and wreak havoc. Spiritual presences were present when our educational system when our educational system for the most uh for most of our nation's history, many of our major colleges began as theological seminaries. See what this man is doing is going back a short distance in their history and just bringing up our theological uh uh our colleges were theological seminaries. This is a historical fact. What has happened to us as a nation? We have refused to honor God. And in so doing, we open the doors to hatred, hatred and violence. And when something as terrible as Coline's tragedy occurs, politicians immediately look for a scapegoat, such as the NRA, they immediately seek to pass more restrictive laws that contribute to erode away our personal and private liberties. We do not need more restrictive laws. Eric and Dialin would not have stopped by uh Eric and Dialin, speaking of the two men, would not have been stopped by metal detectors. No amount of gun laws can stop someone who spends months planning this type of massacre. The real villain lies within our own hearts. As my son Craig lay under the table at in the school library, he saw two friends murdered before his very eyes. He did not hesitate to pray in school. I defy any law, any politician to deny him that right. I challenge every young person in America and around the world to realize that on April the 20th, 1999 at Columb High School, Columbine High School, prayer was brought back to our schools. Do not let the many prayers offered by those students be in vain. dare to move into the new millennium with a a sacred disregard for legislation that violates your God-given right to communicate with him. To those of you who would point your finger at the NRA, I give you a sincere challenge. Dare to examine your own heart before casting the first stone. Said, "My daughter's death will not be in vain. The young people in this country will not allow this to happen. very somber and very penetrating. A man I know nothing about his background, but he was bold. He was courageous to say things in front of political leaders of a of America and to let them know. He said he he he absolutely defies anybody that would try to stand up and say now is he was asking is that illegal because they prayed in school. They certainly did pray in school. Now why did I do that? I even have another one here but I'm not going to take the time. These people as far as I would know know nothing about the message and they identify what is happening and they identify it to the degree that it's very disturbing for them. They ident identify their environment that's around them and it's everywhere around them and it's distressing for them. It's disturbing for them. We don't want to just go along like we're you know we're walking through the liies and nothings. We want to see that this is a world that God has put under judgment. &gt;&gt; This is a world that God has declared the day of vengeance is not coming. It's here. &gt;&gt; And I think that we as believers cannot really accurately guide or have our lives guided unless we're aware that this is what is taking place. This is what is happening. You young people, you young couples with families and you're just beginning to raise your family, whatever you do, you need to hold this uh this scriptural view, this vision that God has given. You talk about a prophet's vision. This is part of his vision. &gt;&gt; How much of his message is coming against the things that's against God and the denominational systems? We don't cry out against it like he did. And you may be scared to ever have to say a word about it because you work with nice people, &gt;&gt; but God has never changed his mind about that system. &gt;&gt; He's never changed his mind about that system. Do you hear me? &gt;&gt; And there are nice people. They really need to hear and see the message. Whatever whatever you do, if these people not ashamed to pray in that crisis, let me say to you tonight, we're in a much greater crisis than Cola in high school. &gt;&gt; We're in a much greater crisis than the boys that are fighting in Afghanistan or over in Iraq. We're in a much greater crisis right here in Surrey or Washington or wherever you want to say. We're in a much greater crisis. You're a little quiet tonight, but I'm declaring it to you in the name of the Lord. What we have out there is a much greater crisis. Not that we go out there swinging with our fists and so on. It's not that kind of a thing, but it is the kind of a battle where we are challenged to live the kind of life we are supposed to live, to live it fervently, to live it courageously, to live it without any shame. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and let people know why you are what you are, why you live the kind of life that you live. We're not here to be silent bumps on a log. We're here to live a fiery testimony of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said amen because I believe it. &gt;&gt; And I've held you longer than I wanted to by about 15 minutes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to sing a song. I've been singing it all day. You might wonder how in the world do you come up with this song after that kind of a message? Well, it's easy because after looking at the day of vengeance and after looking at the dreadful day of the Lord, I can only think of one thing. When we all get to heaven, &gt;&gt; sing the wondrous love of Jesus. Talk about of all of his love and care. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to your feet. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sing the wondous love of Jesus. Sing his mercy and his praise in bright and blessed. He'll prepare for us a place when we all get to heaven. [Applause] [Music] That will be when we all see Jesus will sing. and shout while we walk the path to the sky [Music] when we [Music] &gt;&gt; What a day of rejoicing. There will be &gt;&gt; and when we all see Jesus we'll sing and shine the victory. The fourth verse onward to the price he uses [Music] when we all get to heaven. Our rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus. We'll sing and shout the victory. When we all heaven rejoicing that will be when we all see the victory. &gt;&gt; How many realize that we're in a in a very very real battle? Brother Brandham says of angels that in a meeting he said you can actually feel their presence and they're wanting to influence us. I said that to say this. When you go walking out where you're going to be tomorrow and you young people, some of you are not in the Byway Christian Academy. you're going to be in another school. I'm going to tell you something that probably is not new to you, but I want to I want to sensitize you to this that we are in a very very real battle. And as you're moving about tomorrow or this coming week, there will most definitely come a moment and you'll just feel a weight and a kind of a cloud and a heaviness. That's a demon spirit &gt;&gt; for the most part. That's a demon spirit. And he's setting you up. He wants to bring a much he wants to bring a much more ill effect upon you and maybe spread from you to someone else in your family between husband and wife between parents and children and that's an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; I've never hardly ever spoken like this before. Sometime you start out man starts out in the morning goes up to fill his car with gas walks in to pay the bill and there's all the girly magazines right there. Don't look surprised. That's exactly what happens. And you'll just feel a presence come. That's a demon spirit. and he wants to set that person up for a battle royale. &gt;&gt; And you know what I'm talking about is absolutely the truth. Some little thing just goes sideways in the morning, maybe even before breakfast and just cast a cloud, cast a heaviness. That's a demon spirit. And we say, "Oh, well, you know, I just uh I'm I'm just not having a good day. It's not that that's not in the word. If what the prophet has said is true and you can feel the influence of angels, don't forget those guys out there are fallen angels &gt;&gt; and they know all about worship and they're not they're not afraid that you've been here in church tonight. But they would be afraid if you take a hold of the word and become uh have your eyes and your focus and your vision sensitized. Say, I'm going to stand on guard. And the prophet says, "Know what kind of licks, what kind of how he fights." I'm telling you how he fights. That's how he fights. &gt;&gt; And if you're just going to lay back and let it happen, you'll have a terrible struggle in your spiritual life. But I'm telling you, it's something that I practice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's something that I practice &gt;&gt; and it's something that works. Sunday night after the service, I prayed for a man for salvation, our sister PJ's husband. We prayed together for salvation. And I gave him exactly the same kind of counsel. And I'm leaving you tonight with that same kind of counsel. You just you you you just watch. We're we're in a battle. Put on the whole armor of God. You'll be able to withstand all the fiery darts. Fiery darts. Yeah, they were fired at you today. Maybe you didn't even weren't even aware of it. He's firing darts at us all the time. He's trying to find a loophole someplace. But God has given us everything that we need to have victory over him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Onward to the prize before us. &gt;&gt; God bless you for being here. Thank you for your support. Thank you for filling this church up tonight and I appreciate your prayers. Let's remember the weekend our brother Caillumbi, our brother Toby's father is going to be preaching on Sunday. He'll be preaching in French, but brother Dier will be uh translating, interpreting for him. And I tell you, I was so moved at at the message that he spoke. I just uh I think even two services wouldn't really be enough, but we're going to come and hear this very very uh qualified and uh uh very mature ministry of our brother Caillumbi. Saturday is the wedding for sister Rebecca and and brother Toby Caillou. believe it's 11:00 10 1 got changed two three times it's at 1 so come early and we'll try to start at one God bless you onward to the Christ before us. [Music] [Music] And when we get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be. And when we All Jesus will sing and shout the victory. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask brother Arnold Dross. Would you please come up, brother Dross, and give us a word of greeting and close in prayer if you would please ask God's blessing upon this congregation. We need all the blessings we can get. &gt;&gt; God bless you with our heart. Amen. God bless you. Certainly been a pleasure to be here tonight and just to be with God's people. It's always uh an attributes of uh beneficial help to each and every one of us. And so good to have these words of enlightenment to better help us to understand the darkness of the world that we as the lights of God are passing through. So we'd appreciate your continued prayers for the occasion and to ourselves and our ministry there and the children of God there in Ontario. So let us bow tonight in prayer. Loving Father, we certainly appreciate the greatness of our Lord and our Savior and the benevolence of your great truth you've sent in this hour and the men of God that you have treasured with the opportunity to carry this light and to share it and to bring it forth to be a ministering spirits to each and every one of your children. And we want to thank you tonight and we ask your continued blessings upon this congregation, the ministry, Brother Ed, and the ones that are ministering with them here in this tabernacle, Lord, this oasis here in this western part of this country, Canada. And we would just pray now that you would continue to lead and to guide us toward that perfect day, oh God. If we should never see one another again on this side, we do have this great and glorious promise and this comfort that come from the scriptures, Lord, that we will all of your children that are in the hand of your father, he has given to you and none shall be lost. We look forward to that day. In the meantime, Lord, as our brother has ministered tonight, let us go forth and be an impact by being the light in this world. In Jesus name we ask. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Arnold, Brother Arnold, we're dismissing you. Thank you for your time. God bless you. I trust you've been benefited spiritually. Amen. Equipped. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Start your neighbor off with a good handshake. Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Australian.
