[Music] And uh [Music] I'm gonna ask brother Tony, brother Tony, if you'd come open the service in a word of prayer. Uh we want to remember in prayer this morning the Kirk family. Uh they're not doing well, especially Jordan who has hooping cough. That the Lord would restore them to health. Sister Cheryl um Goss uh handed me a note this morning. It says, "My mom had a stroke on Friday. I would like the Lord to use this to deal in the hearts of my family and for a speedy recovery for my mother." There's a request for the Jar Dar family. The children are as at home sick this morning. And also there's a request that we pray for brother Roland Barber from Tallaladega, Alabama. He had a heart attack. He's going in for a quadruple bypass on Tuesday morning. Uh if there's any other needs in our midst this morning, just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen. And uh if you're on the internet listening in this morning, you just take your request before the Lord as brother Tony comes. Lord Jesus, we come into your presence this morning, Lord, with hearts that are full of adoration, full of love. Oh, who is like unto thee, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords. And Lord Jesus, we've come here this morning, Lord, for no other purpose but to meet with you. Oh God, for in your presence there's fullness of joy. There's delivering power. Oh Lord God, there's revelation upon revelation. Lord, this is the place that we were born from, Father. Oh God, how you've uh illuminated our hearts to recognize who we are. That we were found in you before the foundation of the world. That we were those sons and daughters that sang for joy in the morning when the word of God was being opened. When the word of God was being revealed and we saw the great mysteries, the mystery of God in Christ, the mystery of Christ in the church, the bride, the fullness of Christ in this last days. Oh, how we have a reason to shout. How we have a reason to be happy this morning. How we re have a reason to be able to lift our voices in praise and adoration to you. For you have done all things well. You are our bridegroom. You are our lover. You are King of Kings and Lord of Lords, oh Father, Lord. And it is for this reason that we gather, Lord, to make our petitions known, Lord, because we see you high and lifted up as the great and mighty conqueror, as the one who took the keys from death, hell, and the grave. And oh Lord, in you is health, in you is strength, in you is deliverance this morning. And Father, we bring these needs to you, oh God. Father, you know there are many needs in our assembly. Oh, Father, we know that you work through these these trials, the testings, Father. And Father, we pray and we join our heart with our sister Cheryl for her mother. Lord, if it was our mother, a mother that doesn't know you, a mother that is lost and undone and go into a godless eternity unless you deal with her heart. Oh, Father, in these last days of her life, may you reveal your word to her. May the testimony of Jesus Christ and our sister Cheryl, may it come back to her. May you speak to her. Give her a gift of repentance. We pray for Cheryl's mother, Lord. Oh, Father, we have others that are, Lord, needy and body, families that are not well as this Kirk family has requested prayer. We pray for Jordan, Lord, with this swooping cough. We pray for the Dar family. We pray for others in the assembly that didn't even Lord request a prayer this morning, but they're looking to you. Their hearts are looking to you in faith. We're believing, Lord, that even the unspoken request here is known to you, Father, and that you'll move and you'll confirm that the living Christ is in the midst of us by touching these ones. We can't help but also think of our precious brother Emil Bessie, Lord. Oh father, deliver him from this demon of cancer. Lord, we know of our other sister Norma as well. Lord, we know of others that are Lord inflicted in some way or another. Oh God, there's nothing too great. There's nothing too small. But in these things, the kingdom of God comes near. In these things, we see your power, Lord, and the truth vindicated in these days. Oh Lord, we pray for our brother Roland Barber in Alabama. We pray that you'd strengthen him and any other unspoken request. We remember those that are out ministering and those that'll be ministering tonight as we think of our precious brother DJ in Seattle and brother Tom and Lord others that are gone out. Brother Timothy Dodd in Africa, brother Brad Burges in Australia. Lord, you know, brother Wayne and brother Ed Hunter in India. Lord, we pray for these brothers. And Lord, we hold them up as well as the other gifts to your body. They're dressing of how you're clothing us and how we want to be clothed this morning. How we want to put on your righteousness, Lord. How we want to be robed in the word of God, oh Father. And we pray, Lord, as we've already been holding our pastor up in prayer before you for this service this morning, oh God, we're looking to the unseen. We're looking beyond the veil. Father, this world is temporal. It's passing. But Lord, we see another kingdom. We see another body. Lord, we see another dimension, oh God, that we come from and we're going back to. Oh Lord, speak to our hearts. Strengthen our pastor, Lord. Strengthen brother, Lord. Let him have clarity of mind and thought, oh God, as he's waited upon you for this service, Lord, given himself to the word, yielded himself to you. Father, how thankful we are for men of God that'll do that. What a sacrifice it is on family. Oh Lord, a sacrifice bodily, but Lord Jesus, it's your grace. It's your gift to us to speak, Father, through our pastor. Bless him, we pray. Lord, anoint our hearts. Let there not be a weary one in the midst. And if there's any here that do not know you, having come to know this experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, God, &gt;&gt; Lord, may you move upon those ones. We need to be sealed in in these last days. Oh God, we want to make our calling and election sure. That's why we've gathered. And may you have the preeminence this morning as we commit this service to you in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you may be seated. [Music] We want to welcome everyone this morning and all those that are visiting with us. We want to make sure that you know you're real welcome this morning. Uh we've got a special uh welcome for Sister Franis. Uh I believe I'm pronouncing that right. At least I hope I am. Sister Franc's twin sister visiting for two weeks from uh London in the UK. May we get our sister to stand up and God bless you. We're happy to have you here. &gt;&gt; Trust everyone make a real welcome if you're visiting and uh we haven't recognized you. Just want to make sure that you know you're real welcome here. We've got a special this morning from our sister Elizabeth neighbor. Sister Elizabeth, why don't you come? Um one other thing the deacons have asked me announce this morning. Uh someone's parking in the handicap parking area and they're not handicapped. So, um, you know, we have a few people who are not as mobile getting around. And this morning, our brother Ed Dodd has to walk about a mile from his car because someone parked in a in a handicap parking stall. So, please, if you can get around, uh, I appreciate, you know, you may, we're not in Laos to see, uh, but, uh, you're kind of looking that way if you can't walk, uh, a little bit. And it's not even raining out this morning. So please, you know, the uh handicap parking stall is for people who have difficulty getting around. Amen. [Music] There's a pressure building underneath our wings. preparing a people to fly home. And I feel this difference in the air. Yet his spirit whispers to my soul that with patience I must still press to the goal. Be steady. It will strengthen me to know. I've got to be in condition to go home. So I surrender to the fire that brings me change. holding loose all that I possess in this season. I find rest. [Music] Soon the last mourn will dawn on the sands of time. We will stack our weapons on the bank of heaven shore. But for now we must polish our sword again, advancing onward. Even as the sun goes down, embrace the heat of battle. Taking back our ground till the captain says you've conquered. Trade your armor for a crown. I've got to be conditioned to go home. So I surrender to the fire that brings me chase. Oh you [Music] all that I possess [Music] in this season I find rest. [Music] I will take your hand across the table. There we'll cry tears of joy for the harvest our laborers reaped. And the pain and heartache we carried on the earth. Alone they seem a friend now as we kneel before the throne. They served a purpose to ready me for home. I rejoice in the testing [Music] for I will overcome. I've got to be in condition to go home. So I surrender to the fire that brings me chase. Holy lose all that I possess. In this season, I find rest. I've got to be in condition to go home. So I surrender to the fire that brings me change. All day lose all that I possess in this season I find resting loose all that I possess in this season I find Rest in rapture season. We find [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thanks sisters. God rich in mercy. Amen. Aren't you glad for what he's done for us in this day? Amen. We're getting ready to go home, saints. We want to be in the spirit this morning. Amen. And uh as we sing this song, Sister Florence and the group that sing with her, you could come and get ready. [Music] God rich in mercy. God rich in mercy, sending his son, we were undone. God rich in mercy. Oh, God rich in praise, God rich in love, sending his from heaven up, sing to all [Music] in mercy. Courage in mercy. Oh, courage in mercy. Courage in mercy. Send me his son. Oh, we were undone. God rich in mercy. Oh, God rich in praise. God rich in love. sending him from heaven above. Sing to all of men today. [Music] God rich in mercy. God rich in mercy. [Music] [Music] I was in prison, locked up in chains. Sin held me captive to sorrow and pain. Years of frustration as love passed me by. Until the master heard my heart's cry for grace. marvelous grace. I need a grace to pour it in and make me whole gravel [Music] from [Music] love. marvelous grace. [Music] I was downhearted. I was broken inside. Praying for mercy with nowhere to hide. I was a soulless searching for me with grace ever flowing and it set my soul free. It was grace, marvelous grace. I embrace to heart and make me whole. Grace, marvelous grace flows from above with love. Marvelous grace. [Music] I am forgiving. I am redeemed, [Music] a brand new creation. He saved me and he gave me a reason to sing. Grace, grace. God's grace. Grace that will pardon with grace. grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sins. [Music] Grace, marvelous grace flows from above with infinite love. Marvelous grace, [Music] marvelous gra. Marvelous grace, marvelous grace, marvelous face. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Are you thankful for God's grace this morning? Let's stand and sing it. Praise God. [Music] Praise God. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] I Oh my praise. [Music] and redeem [Music] our [Music] once again. Oh great, our earth is great. Oh mighty might [Music] be. [Music] Maybe the choir can just start us off again. Grace, grace, grace greater than all my sin. And then just help us sing it. And then you can find your way to your seats while the congregation is singing it. &gt;&gt; Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that will pardon and cleanse with it. Praise God. Praise and grace that he is greater than all our lifted up again. Great. Thank you. Grace that will grad that is greater than all our [Music] marvelous grace. We're thankful this morning beyond our words, beyond any expression that we could make, how thankful we are to God for his gracious gift through Jesus Christ. We want to welcome you all this morning. All those that are with us in spirit, perhaps not in body, but those that are with us on the internet and by whatever means and wherever else they may be in the building. I feel badly that some have to can't find seats. I heard last night some had to go to the fellowship room and I know there's always quite a few there but I think it's a better service if we can be right here to just squeeze in and make as much room as possible. Um I'm going to go directly to the uh scriptures again this morning. like to get started as early as possible. And I just want to say to the those that are singing and the choir and the musicians and all, you know, we sit here and we we get blessed by a song, but they have to do some hard work and travel and take evenings and take a lot of other time and just to come here and be a blessing for they probably spend a few hours to be a blessing in a five minute song. So, I think we want to appreciate it like it did take some time. Amen. So, we appreciate all those that sang and the sisters that sang. God bless you all. I'm going to have you turn with me to uh John's Gospel uh the 14th chapter and we're going to read a few verses. You can open your Bible to John 14. And then just before we read, we're going to pray together. John 14. We'll be reading from the first verse down to the ninth verse. Let's just have a word of prayer. Oh gracious and loving heavenly father, we address you so many different ways and then again so many times the same way, but we know that you fill every one of our expressions. However it is that we can approach you or do approach you, but we can never approach you outside of the name of Jesus Christ. Oh God, that name that's above every name. That name at which all knees shall bow. That name at which even at this instant demons are trembling. for those for fear that those of the children of God will have trust, confidence in that name. And we'll appropriate the power that is in that name. And we pray today, oh God, you'll give us insight that we might see what you have put and placed in that person of Jesus Christ. Today, Lord, I pray by the Holy Spirit, you'll make your word a reality. how we thank you for the messages that we have been hearing over this pullpit from service to service, oh God. And I pray you will continue. Take sovereign control of every vessel, Lord, and of myself this morning, to the glory of Jesus Christ, to the glory of his name, to the glory of the kingdom of God, and that God himself might be glorified, the only one and true living God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of Israel, the God who's made this land his choice. And we pray this morning, Lord, that your name will be lifted up and glorified. We give ourselves to you unreservedly. Ask you'll bless the people as they are attentive and listen. And now, Jesus, we are in your presence and we are in your hands. &gt;&gt; We say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 14, we'll begin to read at verse one. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. And whether I go, you know, and the way you know. Thomas sith unto him,"Lord, we know not whether thou goest, and how can we know the way?" Jesus saith unto him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If you had known me, you should have known my Father also, and from henceforth you know him and have seen him." And Philip saith unto him,"Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us." Jesus saith unto him, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Phillip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father, and how sayest thou, then show us the Father." Amen. May God bless us together as you have your seats. Last week I had a long title, looking to the unseen and the unseen looking to the seen. And I gave it a second title, prophet optics. And my wife said, "Well, I like that second title. It's simpler." And and I'm going to continue with that. So if you ask for last week's, it's probably going to be just under profit optics. And this week be part two of that same subject, but we're coming at it from quite a a different direction. And I just trust the Lord will help us. Uh Jesus said, "When you've seen me, you've seen the father." Now uh brother Brandham was in a bit of a discussion with someone and and uh over this very very subject and uh said well uh they were raising the question well when when I see you I don't see your wife you see because he said I and my wife are one but he said this is different because he said when you see me you don't see my wife but Jesus said when you see me you see the father. &gt;&gt; He said and that was different. He made a he made a distinction there. And I can say in the spiritual realm everyone has their interpretation uh or their uh understanding of what the scripture means. And uh if they believe that they know I just want to lay some foundations here. If they believe that they know what God is saying, then they begin to act out what what act out that kind of life if they be if they actually know because now I want to I want to give you some slides in just a moment. Uh how how can God make known his thoughts to us? That is the question so that we can see it. How can he make us to see so that we can live out that true vision? How can God how can he uh make it clear to us as individuals? Because today, of course, this morning while we're sitting here, there's churches gathered in every corner. And as I said last Sunday, if it was just in the simplistic way of reading, we could read the scripture. anyone who had normal intelligence could read the scripture. And if we all read it, if that's all there was to it, then we'd all believe the same thing because it would just be that simple. We just read it. That's what it means. And uh if you can read, I can read, we'd all read it. It'd be the same thing. But you see, the scripture is something different than that. And it requires it requires a word we use all the time. It's it's revelation. But I want to use that as it it requires some insight. It requires an internalizing of the of the vision of God. And I hope to be able to make this clear as we move through. Uh when John saw Jesus, John the Baptist, he saw a lamb. Jesus said to Philillip, "When you see me, you've seen the father." So those are two vastly different things and yet they're the same. But he when when John saw him, he actually saw a lamb. Said, "Behold the lamb." Jesus said to Philillip, "When you've seen me, you've seen the father." I want you to think about that. So, it's quite possible to be looking at something and not be able to really see see it for what it is. I don't know what Philillip if you'd asked Philillip, "What are you seeing?" He probably would have described Jesus to you and would have recognized him as being the Messiah, perhaps the son of God and whatever. You see, even even a time the timing of when John saw him. Now, John saw him as a lamb because he was ordained to see that. &gt;&gt; See that he was ordained to have that vision. God gave him that uh uh that perception and that vision and he saw a lamb. Now I'm and and I've got many many examples in the scripture. So we're going to take our time. And now a a short season had passed, not very long till Philip was looking at the same person. He said, "Now when you've seen me, you've seen the father." Well, John was making no reference to seeing Almighty God the Father. When he was introducing Jesus, he was introducing him as a lamb because that's what he was ordained to see. Now, our natural vision, I I I showed some slides and some clips and and been quite a few people have asked for the uh for the slides and things uh that I used last week and and the various mysteries. The reason I put the mysteries of the kingdom up was because there is so much question, there is so much debate upon the mysteries and here Scoffield now uh he he listed I think uh about 11 of them. Then brother Brandham goes on from there and lists a whole another series of mysteries including the uh false anointed ones believe the serpent seed he starts off with and those are mysteries because now you see we are in a different season. We're at a different time and God needed to take a certain instrument and it would be a prophetic office, a prophet instrument, prophet optics, and peel back the layers of things. I was thinking when when we saw that little clip coming from 10 million light years into space and so on and then coming down to a leaf and coming down. Of course, what was in my mind because I already had had it in my notes in the simplicity of the message here. The prophet comes and takes a si six billion souls on earth and takes the scripture many false anointed ones many Christs many Christ shall rise false Christs shall rise just takes that scripture and then with prophet prophetic optics begins to peel it back and say there's there's the blade there's the stock &gt;&gt; here's the husk &gt;&gt; here's the tossel &gt;&gt; it is. &gt;&gt; Now notice how the husk is just exactly like the seed, &gt;&gt; but it's not the seed. &gt;&gt; Oh, that was different. &gt;&gt; And that hasn't got any. And this hasn't got life in it. It's just passing through. This hasn't got life in it. Notice how it turns yellow in the harvest time cuz the life has passed out of it. And here it is moving up through all of the church ages and all the denominations and moving on and explaining to the people that's why there's no life there left. &gt;&gt; It's gone on from there. What is that? Prophet optics. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he's showing from uh from the scientist of all scientists, God Almighty, and just peeling back the layers and showing you why it's not there and and laying it overlaying it over the entire earth religious world of the earth and showing it's not there. But then saying, but but notice what went into the ground. A seed went into the ground. And notice what's here at the end time. What went into the ground was word. And notice now in the end time it has to be word. Can't be anything else. Has to be word. And notice it only went in one in the ground. But when it comes in the harvest, there's many. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's prophetic optics. &gt;&gt; And how he took these mysteries and just began to peel them back layer by layer. And if you watch it, it's so accurate. It couldn't be any more accurate than that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now Jesus said when you've seen me you've seen the father and I just want to uh I want to just take uh some slides here quickly to uh give some uh just some understanding of the words that Jesus used when he said you have known you should have known. And hast thou not known me, Phillip? And so, can we just have that slide up, please? Hast thou not known me, Phillip? which means to uh the word known is to learn to know or to get a knowledge of and to to understand. But more than that, to the Greeks, this meant to know facts. But these facts may or may not affect one's conduct. That was to the Greeks, but not to the Jew. To the Jew, true knowledge always, always manifested itself in one's conduct. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the Jew, to the spiritual Jew, it always manifested itself in one's conduct. And so when one somebody says to me, "Well, I've got, oh, such an understanding. Oh, this is such a glorious revelation. All the rest of it, I don't discount that, but I watch for it to manifest. &gt;&gt; I want to see something happen. &gt;&gt; I want to see something, you know, u being manifested in the life. And that's the evidence. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "If I if I, you know, had the spirit of Beethoven in me, what'd he say?" He'd write music. If you have the spirit of Leonardo da Vinci in you, you'll paint art. &gt;&gt; You'll just do that. You can't help that if you have the life in you. And if we have the life of Jesus Christ in us, they said that one did not know something until that fact had a practical outworking in his life. That was, "Have you not known me?" And then he that hath seen me hath seen the father. And to see is to properly to stare at. If you've seen me, you've seen the father. But this scene is that you stare at something. You ever been stared at? You almost feel uncomfortable. Well, we need to stare at the word. &gt;&gt; Literally stare at the word. It is to see with the eyes. That's only one. But to see with the mind and to perceive. And that's we're asking for today. or to become acquainted with by experience. So it's not just something you see with the eyes and it's not something that you just merely are illuminated with in the mind but it is something that you have you become acquainted with. You come to know it by experience. You've actually experienced it. And then uh this goes further. Now, we want you to note that this word gives prominence to the discerning mind. And I trust we all have discerning minds. When the physical side recedes, I have it underlined because I would like you to pay strict attention to that. Today we we are here in a church in a group of people and we Jesus when he was seen by John saw a lamb Jesus when he had Philillip there he said you've seen me you've seen the father that was at that time we have a message and that message has been internalized within a body of people here on this Sunday, January 2006. And I wonder what it is that you and I actually in all truth see when we see one another &gt;&gt; or when we see this gathering of people today to a lot of people they say it's a church and maybe to a lot of people here it's a church. If that's all you see, you've missed it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I see Christians." If that's all you see, you've missed it. Also, &gt;&gt; what do you see when you see God's people? What do you see when you see the message of say, "Oh, I I I've got a I've got a message book here. I got the token here and oh, what I'm seeing." But now when this is actually uh dwelling indwelling the truth of the word indwelling in individuals what is it that we actually see &gt;&gt; that's where we need to come to because that's when the physical the physical side really needs to recede &gt;&gt; so that the spiritual side is something where we are focused and that's what we see. Next one is everything the Christian this brother Brand speaking now everything the Christian can depend on is the unseen the promise of God that he's simply saying what we see can't be depended on &gt;&gt; we can't really fully depend on one another I trust that we can have trust and confidence in one another but we cannot depend because everything that is here is temporal and it's passing and we you might be able to depend on me today to keep my word to do something for you tomorrow I may not have the strength tomorrow you may not be around so we don't know we don't know about the future so we can't depend on one another in that in that at that level um we but he says that everything that Christian can depend on is the unseen the promise of God and We look at something that we don't see with our eyes. And by the way, if you see it with your eyes, you don't see it. See it means to understand it. &gt;&gt; And so when we see the kingdom of God is not with observation. We don't see it. If we think we see the kingdom of God, then you don't see it. Because to see it is to understand it. I cannot look at this body of people here today and understand the kingdom of God. For the kingdom of God is within you. The kingdom of God is going to manifest itself in ways that's going to surprise you and surprise me. The kingdom of God because we don't see it. We simply believe that it is here in existence because Jesus said it was. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the token message, I have one quote here which may seem unrelated, but as we go on the service today, the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost. Well, we don't see the Holy Ghost, but we see the effect of the Holy Ghost. It's unseen. &gt;&gt; It's not something that I can fully understand, but I can believe it. Right. &gt;&gt; And so today's he said the the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost, not a blood, a chemistry, but it is the Holy Spirit of God. That is the token that God requires of the church today. God must see this token. He must see it in every one of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to be coming down because I want to speak a good deal today on the on the subject of the blood. Uh and it will tie together for you. To understand, brother Brandham said to to see means to understand it. That's in the message perseverant. Now uh just to give a little bit of rehearsal from last Sunday, we uh we have different kinds of sight and different types of vision. We have sight by the natural eye. Now this is not my notes from last Sunday. I I just I go over it completely for this for this particular service today. But how limited and how restricted is our natural vision and can be obscured and can not be accurate, cannot be really clear. Then we have sight by our mind's eye. We have understanding or we have a mental comprehension. And there's a place where mental insight and understanding actually merge because you know you've had the experience well uh yeah I see it I think I see it. Yeah. And then a person keeps speaking keeps explaining and it becomes clearer clearer to you. And finally you say oh yeah I got it. I see it now. I understand it. because now you got an understanding of something that has been been uh someone has been giving to you mentally. We read the scriptures or we hear the message and we gain you know we gain some insight but you've experienced it and I have many times and that is that after months and maybe even years and then one day you read the very same scripture and oh &gt;&gt; there it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you say, "How couldn't I see that before? &gt;&gt; Why didn't I see that before?" There it is in the plainest of language. But you see, there had to be a time. And if a person walks humbly before God and hungers and thirsts after righteousness, you will be filled and you will be fed. You will drink at fountains. Amen. If you just keep the right posture in uh before God and walk softly before him and humbly and continue to hunger and continue to love him and continue to feed yourself on the word, he will open it up. He will manifest it. I mean even if we say naturally speaking you can you can uh uh you know you've had your maybe your breakfast this morning whatever more you you eat your food but it's a total mystery of what that's doing within your system total mystery what that's doing but you just believe it's doing something &gt;&gt; you just believe and then you carry right on you don't stop and try to figure everything out vision can come also by inspiration what poets I think of poets and inspired writers and inventors which I mentioned briefly and I won't won't carry on with that at all and then the vision that comes by revelation because that truly is what the believer lives on and as the prophet said revelation is more important to us than anyone can actually realize. Now what those in the scripture I would like to go back now for our benefit today to see what different individuals within the scripture what they saw what Abraham saw. We'll just start with him and what Lot saw. They saw two very very different things. Now I I read a quote for you last Sunday where and and I have it here. I'm going to bring it out just a little later on, but where Abraham actually saw Isaac and by seeing Isaac, he saw the unseen. By seeing Isaac, he was counted and believed it. He was counted righteous. Now I and I I think it's important for us and I don't want to sound repetitious because I emphasized it quite heavily last Sunday but we hear so much and I have heard so much and it it perhaps for myself but I we hear it continually that we see the scripture and we quote the promise and we just have to see the promise see the promise but it's even more than seeing the promise. It's seeing what the promise says. What the promise the evidence of the promise and we look at the evidence. That's why brother Brandham said he said in regards to healing, what do you do? You put a healed person out in front of you. He didn't say you put the promise out in front of you. He said you put the healed person out in front of you. In other words, you put the evidence of the promise in front of you. The promise promises something, but he's saying take the evidence of the promise and put that in front of you and keep your vision on that. What do you see? I see a healed person. What do you see? I see a saved person. I see a delivered son. I see a delivered daughter. I see the evidence. And now I thank God for the evidence. And I walk in the in with the with my eyes fixed on that. That's my vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God spoke to Job and this is what he said. Where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid them? Who hath laid the measures thereof? If thou knowest, or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Who laid the cornerstone thereof? When the morning stars sang together and all the sons shouted for joy, he he's saying where were you? &gt;&gt; Now, I don't think he's saying in the sense where were you? &gt;&gt; Right, &gt;&gt; you little piece of nothing. No, brother Brandham said he trusted Job. He had confidence in Job. And so I think he's trying to tell Job something. Where were you &gt;&gt; when the morning star sang together &gt;&gt; and the sons of God shouted for joy? &gt;&gt; And the prophet now prophet optics peels back the scripture. And he says then every Christian that's a real genuine Christian was with him when the morning stars sang together &gt;&gt; and the sons of God shouted for joy. Hallelujah. Every born again Christian, are you here? &gt;&gt; Born again Christian, every bornag again Christian was with him, was identified with him when the sons of God shouted for joy and the morning stars sang together. He said, "We were identified in the immortal realms with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed. I like that kind of optics. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just read it as something God was saying to Job. And so many people will take it as a negative effect upon Job, belittling Job. He wasn't belittling Job. He was letting Job know you were with me. &gt;&gt; When we laid the foundations of the world and the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy, [Applause] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was lifting him up, &gt;&gt; but he was also showing Job how great he was in two entire chapters. How great God is &gt;&gt; and that Job had a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; And you were in the immortals. I was back there with him. If I've got eternal life, I was there with him. I was identified with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy. When Job when God was finished asking Job many many questions and Job confessed he was void of understanding of the greatness of his God, this God. And he and and God asked him these questions. And Job said, "Behold, I am vile, and I I will I what shall I answer thee? I'll lay my hand upon my mouth." He just felt this was so great. I I can't even attempt an answer to this. And as we ponder the greatness of God and I just go back to the simplicity of the little clip and I make so many references to it because I wanted to spawn a thought in your mind and sew a seed and coming 10 million light years you know this is not mythology this is reality and coming right down onto a leaf on a tree and in Florida that's not mythology that's not mystic that's reality and to show it and coming down into such a minute and such a you know almost in this finite realm and yet it becomes infinite to us almost because it just seems like it was endless and they say what do you have to say about that I just say I'll put my hand on my mouth &gt;&gt; I don't understand I don't understand a god of such greatness that can make those things and I trample them under my foot worlds underfoot I have another one I'm not going to show it to you but it just shows the the things that are so insignificant that you don't you trample over them every day &gt;&gt; as you walk around do your duties. You trample over entire worlds &gt;&gt; things that are existing and living uh uh you know living insects and things and we can't even begin to comprehend it. And when you see it under that kind of microscopic uh inspection, they are they are so intricate. &gt;&gt; They are so incredible and you think you're looking at something that's four or five ft high. And the thing is is you couldn't even begin to see it with the naked eye. They're just worlds, entire worlds all involved and intricately intricately connected with one another. And we have no concept. We're just blundering on in our little space of time and little space of life. I tell you, our God is great. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And those things aren't even connected to redemption. What do you think about the blood that's connected to redemption? &gt;&gt; What do you think about the reality of salvation that's connected to our eternal life? &gt;&gt; I tell you, it is beyond our understanding. Amen. &gt;&gt; One time the Greeks came to Philillip and they desired of him, "Sir, we would see Jesus. We'd like to see Jesus. We'd like to perceive with our eyes. We'd like to understand with our senses. We'd like to gain knowledge. We'd like to gain some understanding of this Jesus. We'd like to see him. We'd like to know him. And Jesus comes with this answer which you've heard so many times but in in the context of the service this morning. Verily, verily I say unto you, except a corn and wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth bringeth forth much fruit. if it die. They never did get to see him in the as as they perceived him to be. We'd like to see Jesus. And Jesus did not offer himself because he knew that by showing himself to them they would see with their natural eye but actually would be deceived by it &gt;&gt; because they could not see Jesus the way they wanted to see him. We want to look on him and by looking on him we'll get to understand it. We'll get to know it. Now nothing has changed friends. It's the same today. Some say you about the message. Well, well, you know, I'd like to check it out. I'll tell you what, save your time. &gt;&gt; Don't even bother trying to explain it. This isn't something you can be checked out. This isn't something you can think about. Well, I like to just come and see and maybe give me a book or two and let me That's not how it's really understood. I realize that I realize that many of us did because there was a certain hunger, a certain appetite, and there was something within us that God appealed to and drew us to himself. But but if if people in their human wisdom said, "Well, you know, I've got a lot of spiritual experiences. I come from a certain church, etc., etc. I'm going to check this out. And if you're here this morning, check it out." It doesn't come that way. Jesus isn't checked out. Jesus isn't something that's discovered that way. You can't just look at it and take it for, you know, what what your eyes or what your little puny mind can grasp. &gt;&gt; Amen. So except a corn and wheat. So Jesus now is referring to like you to hold on to this. Jesus is referring to a process, a process that they all understood real well. So it's a parallel, a parable which goes parallel with a truth. Except a corn of wheat, the Greeks understood that. It was just all too simple. the except a corn and wheat fall into the ground, it abides alone. But if it dies, it bringeth forth much fruit. They might have said, "What's that got to do with seeing Jesus?" But he's referring to a process that they all understood to reveal how they would come to see or to know or to understand God. And that was that Jesus had to die and the spirit that raised him up would have to come back into the church and then the Greeks for there were many who heard heard of Christ through the through the apostles. Now in the unveiling of God, so the Greeks, brother Bram says, couldn't see him because he was hid from them in a human being. Notice his word to them. Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground, it abides alone. God veiled in the form of a man &gt;&gt; hid himself from their view. They could only see a man. But those predestinated seen God. Amen. &gt;&gt; One, he said, saw a man &gt;&gt; and one saw God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they were both right, &gt;&gt; but one could get eternal life and the other couldn't. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; One saw a man, &gt;&gt; but the other saw God, &gt;&gt; now listen closely. And it was God veiled in a human being, &gt;&gt; making both of them right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Both of them, right? He says, "But your faith in what you don't see, you believe it anyhow. God veiled in a human being. He was in that flesh and that flesh was his veil." &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; He goes on in the same message, he always was veiled, &gt;&gt; but he was veiled unto them. He was he was in his human temple. &gt;&gt; That's right. God was in his human temple. Now he says, "Now be real careful." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Be real careful. God in his human temple, God veiled. Because God, the great God, he veiled himself. I tell you what, if he can take life and veil that life in in insects and in in part of a creation we have no concept of we trample over entire worlds. If God can take life, actual just natural life and have it down and then scientists have to take their microscopes and all kinds of instruments and their optics and they start to look in their laboratories and begin to see oh all kinds of life and germs and cells and things moving. Even as Job could say uh the skin worms which was in his body though the skin worms are in his body and he knew he knew understood those things. My friends, there are things that are going on inside you right now you have no concept of, you have no idea of and men have studied it for generations and for generations trying to uh uh trying to determine what how how this functions and how that works and all of these things all of the living organisms and things that we have as humans. It's just a small part. But now God has got a profit and peeling back Yes. &gt;&gt; Taking the human taking our human understanding and peeling it back saying that won't work. You got to have a different kind of optics to look in here and then take away this human veil. And now when they take the human veil back, don't pay any attention to the veil. What do you see? Once it's once the veil is off, I see God. &gt;&gt; And the one that doesn't see it says you're a cult. It's a cult that believes that. I say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; As in the way they call heresy, this is the way I serve the God of my fathers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when we see one another, we see God in his church. That same messenger said, "All that God was, he poured into Christ. And all that Christ was, he has poured into the church." &gt;&gt; And I want to say to the church today, what do you see? What do you see? I see a brother that failed. I see a brother that stutters. I see a sister that's this. I see children that are this. Whatever more what I see, I want to peel away. Peel away that human flesh, that human failure, that human weakness. And look what's inside. What is it that they believe? What is it they have faith in? What is it they have confidence in? And when you peel that away, you'll see God. And it'll be a different thing. You see? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He not only was in his human temple. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He's in his church today. &gt;&gt; And Jesus could not have said it any clearer. &gt;&gt; I am the father and the father in me. &gt;&gt; I in you and you in me. You'll be in the Father and you'll be in me and I'm in the Father and I'm in you and you're in me. You believe that? &gt;&gt; How much planer can it get? &gt;&gt; We may not have them even the mental optics to catch it, but your faith optics can lay hold of it and believe it. And by believing it, you shall see it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You &gt;&gt; don't have to keep quoting some phrases. Now you look at the finished product. I see myself as a son of the living God. I see myself as a daughter of Jesus Christ. I see myself when you look at one another and when you look at yourself. I'm sure most people here took a glance at themselves in the mirror this morning before coming to church just to check things out. But when you see yourself, you must see yourself as the elect lady &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Mrs. Jesus, &gt;&gt; if you would, &gt;&gt; that's not just something for a preacher to scream out over the pulpit. That's something for you to believe. &gt;&gt; That's something for you to confess. &gt;&gt; And not for you to say, "Well, I have to keep saying that. Keep saying that." No, no. The principle is you see it. &gt;&gt; You see, Mrs. Jesus, you see the bride of Jesus Christ. I see a spotless church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. &gt;&gt; That's what he did. &gt;&gt; I'm glorifying him. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to glorify the enemy and Satan and brings all the all our frailties to the forefront and tells us how awful we are. We know that. Amen. &gt;&gt; They went all the people that brother Brandham had before him, the thousands and told them, revealed the secret of their heart. In most cases, they knew that that was what was wrong. He didn't reveal something to them that they didn't know. In most cases, in some cases, he did, but in most cases, they knew they had tuberculosis or they knew they had leukemia or they knew they had something and he just told them. But they knew. He did not know. And that's why he would say the thousands of times, "Isn't that true?" Because they knew it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand? They knew it. &gt;&gt; So he he wasn't he wasn't telling them their trouble to glorify the problem. &gt;&gt; He was telling them their trouble so they could get out of the problem. &gt;&gt; See, that's the key. When we stand here behind the pull pit, I'm not here to glorify our weaknesses and our frailties. We all know we got it. &gt;&gt; You know you have it. &gt;&gt; You know our biggest problem is number one. &gt;&gt; We all know that. &gt;&gt; So there's no use majoring on that. We give God the glory. Soon as he exposes the need, then a person just wants to say, "It's me. &gt;&gt; It's me, oh Lord." And I'm so glad you exposed it because I know right behind it is the answer. &gt;&gt; Right behind it is the remedy. &gt;&gt; Do you have faith? &gt;&gt; Your faith can see the remedy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We see by revelation Abel saw that it wasn't fruits. Right. &gt;&gt; He saw &gt;&gt; it wasn't fruit. &gt;&gt; He saw that it was blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet says the whole church of the living God is built upon the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ in the garden of Eden after Cain and Abel and them were turned out of the garden. Did you notice how that Cain who came and worshiped the Lord and offered a sacrifice and done all he could, very religious Cain was, &gt;&gt; but Abel, he came not with works, &gt;&gt; but by faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice &gt;&gt; than that of Cain. Yes. &gt;&gt; God testifying that he was righteous &gt;&gt; because he was s because he seen the program of God. &gt;&gt; Abel had sight. &gt;&gt; He had sight that no no instrument in any human laboratory could give him. He had sight by revelation &gt;&gt; and he saw the program of God and it was revealed to him. The Bible wasn't written then. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if Cain his brother who sat under the same teaching, they sat under the same teaching, their mother and father told both sons the same things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; He said the same teaching of father and mother and came down and brought forth fruit to make an offering. Cain had the same teaching Abel had. But in the same teaching, he saw something else. &gt;&gt; In the same teaching, &gt;&gt; Abel saw the program of God. &gt;&gt; In the same teaching, one saw fruit and the other saw blood. How different it is to hear the same teaching. &gt;&gt; The same teaching &gt;&gt; and one sees a man and the other one sees God. &gt;&gt; In the same teaching &gt;&gt; in the same message, you have a believer and you have an unbeliever. In the same message, you have a believer and a makebeliever. in the same message. I trust that we've had the preaching of the message in such a way here so that it has just sifted and filtered out because I feel such a power of of the hearts of the people that are believing. &gt;&gt; And I see those also that try to believe. I see the young ones coming up and you sit here and you're respectful. I believe that if you sit here and you listen and you say, "Oh God, my heart is open and my spirit is tender, God is duty bound to reveal it to you. &gt;&gt; And he will reveal it to you and you just hang in there. It'll be a revelation to you. You'll catch it." It maybe wasn't the first time that Abel has heard it, but after he heard it under the teaching of mother and father, no Bible written, but under the teaching of mother and father. and the spirit of God. And of course, Abel, he had a revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's by blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Abel by revelation, listen now, he saw that it wasn't fruits that brought us out of the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Something began to dawn on him. couldn't be fruit &gt;&gt; that brought us out of the garden &gt;&gt; because of fruit the almighty the divine has driven us out of this place couldn't be fruit didn't just wouldn't connect with him &gt;&gt; had to be something else &gt;&gt; maybe I'm dramatizing a little bit maybe he was out there &gt;&gt; with the sheep &gt;&gt; out there and it began to grip him. He saw that lamb, maybe saw that lamb. There's something more. It wasn't fruit, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Something much, much deeper than that. &gt;&gt; Something was witness saying, "I can't explain it. &gt;&gt; I can't explain it." But there's something in me. &gt;&gt; There's something in me that wants to take this little animal. Innocent as it is, I'm going. Yes, I'm going to take it. and he brought it to an altar. How mysterious that must have been to him. He never saw it done before. &gt;&gt; His parents didn't tell him to do it. He didn't hear a preacher. He didn't have He was being driven &gt;&gt; by something he saw. &gt;&gt; It had to be something more that drove us out of his presence. I'm going to take this lamb and baby find a rock and begin to to begin to hack at his throat and and it bleeding and blood flying and and bathing its cold as brother Brandham describes it. And God looked down and accepted that sacrifice because why? There was a lamb before the foundation of the world that was slain in heaven. And the heavenly picture and the earthly picture came together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God looked upon it and accepted it because it was what was in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; And so he took animal blood and transferred it from an animal to the earth &gt;&gt; in type &gt;&gt; of one that was coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen now. But by faith he saw By faith he saw. He didn't only say it was blood, but by faith he saw the son of God coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Abel saw the son of God coming. I tell you, that's the kind of optics I want. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we talk about his coming in this generation. And I tell you, it takes more than human mental optics. You cannot have mental your your own mind gymnastics won't get around it. You'll read it in the word of God. And another mighty angel descends and a prophet comes and begins to peel it back and say, "Notice, it's the same one that's in Revelation one. It's the same one. It's not another one. The rainbows over his head and his feet like pillars of fire. It's the same one. It's not another one. And a prophet peels it back with prophetic optics and says, "There it is, children." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let the congregation say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; You won't get this out of a human laboratory. &gt;&gt; You won't get this even by the Hubble spacecraft. &gt;&gt; This is something beyond that. &gt;&gt; This is beyond 10 million light years. This is beyond the dissecting of a leaf. This is a prophetic optics live on into the eternities and says there he is coming down that mighty angel. It's the Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Coming &gt;&gt; to take his bride out. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And that's why it comes in Revelation 10:7. He's peeling it back. The last messenger has to declare all the mysteries that have been sealed up because he has the optics to open it up. Optics that you and I don't have and the church doesn't have hasn't had for 2,000 years. The optics haven't been in the Bible school or in the seminary. These are not scholar optics. These are not religious leaders optics. These are prophet optics. [Applause] He saw the son of God coming. &gt;&gt; I can say today, I've seen the son of God coming. &gt;&gt; Open your eyes, young men. Open your eyes, young lady. Open your eyes, saints of God. This is this has already been here and been declared. &gt;&gt; Glory. I'm not asking how you feel about it. I'm saying that's what's been thus sayeth the Lord. And God came from the supernatural realm and stood at the platform and and backed it up time after time after time. It was the truth. It was the truth. And today, it's still the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He saw the son of God coming &gt;&gt; and he offered lamb, a lamb in a figurative type, seeing that Jesus was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By faith, Abraham saw Isaac. As we said before, he looked at the unseen &gt;&gt; and he saw Isaac. &gt;&gt; He didn't just see a promise, but he saw Isaac. &gt;&gt; After I want to after looking to the unseen, he called the things which were not as though they were. &gt;&gt; Amen. 10 spies, 12 of them. God sent out by the word of God through the mouth of a prophet, "Send out these spies." &gt;&gt; And they all came back. And 10 of them saw one thing and all agreed to it. And two saw something else. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "And they brought up an evil report of the land." Saw the same land. saw the same city, saw the same walls, saw the same giants, but two of them seen something different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you the spirit of Joshua and the spirit of Caleb is still here today. &gt;&gt; God's not interested in some little wishy-washy, you know, religion and I go to church and I we have some kind of programs. God's not interested in that. He's interested in men and women of faith &gt;&gt; who see something, &gt;&gt; a reality, &gt;&gt; they see it. It's not imagination. The imagination optics is no good. And the optics of the affection is no good. And the option of the optics of all of the realm of the spirit of the reasoning and the imagination and all those things that won't get you any place because that gets all blurred and cloudy. But faith, faith sees it clearly. &gt;&gt; Faith sees the evidence. &gt;&gt; If you had enough faith here this morning, you can see yourself walking on the streets of glory. I see yourself. See yourself with that great host. Hallelujah. See yourself with that great host of witnesses. See yourself greeting them. See yourself embracing them. Hallelujah. We see the evidence. the evidence. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Faith puts you there. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And if you're not ready to go, that faith will save you today. &gt;&gt; If you're bound, that faith will deliver you now. As you hear the word and say, "I'm not ready." That's all you have to say. Lord Jesus, come to me. Cleanse me. Deliver me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Release my faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They brought an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have gone to search it. It is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof. And all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature, and there we saw the giants, the son of an sons of Anch, which came of the giants, and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers. And so were we in their sight. Well, I tell you what, they turned into preachers of doom and enter and turned into false prophesiers as well. They prophesied what the giants were thinking. That's exactly what the devil, he'd just like to, he'd like to just get you to see your problems and your future and everything in the future so desperate and so impossible and such giants and such mountains and such wall cities. I can never never overcome this. And not only that, they they're going to eat me up. this world and the direction it's going. It's just going to tear me to pieces. This devil's been on my trail. Well, why don't you get on his &gt;&gt; and drive him out? &gt;&gt; I tell you what. And then people lean on lean on the uh uh I don't have anything wrong with, you know, we lean on the arm of the flesh and if it'll support you, but won't support you very long. And we have, you know, we have the world and &gt;&gt; and they have all of their instruments of aid and to help us and all the rest of it, but somewhere along the line it'll fail. &gt;&gt; And God has to take over. &gt;&gt; God has to take over. And uh so they saw their giants and they saw what the giants they said we are in in our own sight. We looked at ourselves. We related ourselves to what we saw out there and we're grasshoppers. They should have said, "You know what? When we got out there and we saw those people, we couldn't help but think, Moses, of what you said, &gt;&gt; and God has given us this land &gt;&gt; and we are going to inherit this land. We don't know how, but these guys are nothing to us. Hallelujah. We just came through the Dead Sea. We just saw rather they uh we came through the Red Sea and we've just seen the plagues of Egypt and we saw how the Egyptians look at all the gold and the jewels that they give us just to get rid of us. that gods are God. &gt;&gt; Watch out, Anch. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch out you giants. &gt;&gt; You're nothing. &gt;&gt; In comparison to the Red Sea, you're nothing &gt;&gt; in comparison to Pharaoh. You're nothing in comparison to his chariots and his armies and his horses. You're nothing. And our God destroyed them. &gt;&gt; No. But they looked at it and then put themselves in relationship to it and saw their frailty and their weakness and oh, we're grasshoppers. And God God was angry with that. &gt;&gt; And Joshua and Caleb, they were not of that spirit. &gt;&gt; They were a different spirit in them. &gt;&gt; And Caleb said, "Let's go up here. &gt;&gt; They're bread for us. &gt;&gt; Let's take it." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I say to my brother, my sister, the world may be in a bachelor condition and the world is hellbound and it's full of iniquity and becoming more iniquitous day by day. Vile, evil, violence, all the rest of it. We're not of this people. We're not of this world. We're of another land. That's according to the word of God. You're a bloodbought group. The prophet said, "You're an Exodus group." Hallelujah. You're an Exodus group. Don't let Satan cheat you out of that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There was a whole mob around Steven &gt;&gt; and the words that he was saying made the people so angry and they had all come against him, including the Apostle Paul, who was still Saul. and he was gripped by what was happening in Jerusalem and these heretical heretical Christians. And here's this young man, Stephen, a a deacon or whatever. And he was proclaiming and he preached a mighty service &gt;&gt; and they were smitten in their heart. and they come on him. And when they came and they begin to take stones and they're getting ready to stone him and Stephen says, "Behold, &gt;&gt; I see." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see. &gt;&gt; No one else saw it. &gt;&gt; I see the heavens open. &gt;&gt; I see Jesus Christ standing at the right hand of God. And what he saw, &gt;&gt; what he saw sent the man in a rage. &gt;&gt; What he saw and what you see does not please a lot of people. You say, "I see I'm not only bloodbought. I'm married to Jesus Christ. I see it. I see the evidence of it. And I'm going to walk through this world as his wife." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That makes people angry. Nash on it. They'll put all kinds of nasty things on their websites and tell all kinds of lies about our messenger prophet. And even if you try to correct it, they don't have any time for it. They don't want to believe the truth. &gt;&gt; They want to believe a lie. &gt;&gt; They nash on it. Why? It's the same Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I hope it's meaning something to you. Glory. &gt;&gt; And I see the son of God, the son of man, standing on the right hand of God. And they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord. Amos, you have to pray for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amos, brother Bram said, his bald head was beating with sweat. He came down over the hill and his eyes narrowed and he said he looked at the tourists. He looked at the tourists cuz Israel was prospering and the people were making money and they were living the high life but they were away from God. And everybody what they could see was the prosperity and the materialism and the tourism and oh man why aren't we going aren't we doing things why we're living in a you know we're buying and selling and trading and building and all of these things is like it is today &gt;&gt; but this prophet's eyes narrowed and he saw a backsliden &gt;&gt; brother Brandon mentions Hollywood he saw Hollywood that's why my brother my sister we don't want to see any Hollywood Hollywood in the church. &gt;&gt; We don't want to see any Hollywood, any traces of it anywhere. And whether it's in our dress or in our department or in our language or in our music or in our preaching, we're not here to put on a show. &gt;&gt; We're here to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amos, brother Brandham says, "That's the reason I I rake across the clergy." How can you read the same Bible I am? So did the 400 prophets down there in Israel. They read the same Bible that Micaiah read. But he was willing to spiritually take a stand. Amos in his day. Are you tired? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amos in his day, the fearless prophet of God, he walked up there to Samaria. He looked he looked over the city and he seen all the corruption. You know, whether you live in Seattle or Bellingham, Lyndon, Vancouver, or what it is, you rub shoulders with it all. &gt;&gt; And some of it's religious up to the eyebrows, &gt;&gt; religious as can be. &gt;&gt; But they'll deny Jesus Christ to be you to be baptized in his name. &gt;&gt; They'll say in one side of their mouth, they love him. Don't you dare say his name over me in the water. &gt;&gt; How does that reconcile? It doesn't come from God. It doesn't come from my Bible. &gt;&gt; And you rub shoulders with it. Listen, brother, sister, vile and perverted generation that we live in. And you want to see if you see the corruption, it'll keep you going away from it. &gt;&gt; Don't get comfortable with it. &gt;&gt; It's corrupt. &gt;&gt; Gets a little quiet. &gt;&gt; I want to see what Amos saw. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says they were presuming they were all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen church, &gt;&gt; we don't want to just presume &gt;&gt; we're all right. &gt;&gt; We want to know in the deepest recesses of our soul that we are sitting here today bloodbought, &gt;&gt; cleansed, &gt;&gt; pure, &gt;&gt; by the holy sacrifice of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just am holding myself back. And I shouldn't be holding myself back. I've got to preach for another few minutes. His eyes narrowed over his uh and his eyes narrowed over his beard and the tourists came from all over the world around to see the great Samaria. But that prophet seen it through a different eye. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, they come from all over the world and say, "Oh, the great skiing and the snowboarding and uh Mount Baker and oh, how beautiful this area is is evergreen." Of course, it's evergreen. I don't think it'll ever get brown. Last year it got brown. Anyway, I'm not going to complain. Let the Lord bounce it out. &gt;&gt; But I'm tired of this rain. I want to get that to all the people out in the internet. Almost 30 days of it, folks. Just 10 more days and we'll be up with Noah. Just hang in there. Brother Ernie traded rain for pain. I mean rain for sunshine. Sunshine for Incidentally, Brother Ernie's going to be preaching tonight. Hallelujah. Haven't heard him for some months. He's got lots on his plate. So, but they saw something different. He saw something different. We see all the tourists that come around here. But I'd like to say this morning, Lord, there's a group of people here. We see a whole lot more than the natural beauty. We see way beyond that. In amidst it, we see corruption. &gt;&gt; We see vile unbelievers. We see men, you know what you're you actually associate with people that hate God. They hate the Lord Jesus Christ that died for their sins. &gt;&gt; They would never say that, but they do. &gt;&gt; That's hard to say that, but it's the truth. &gt;&gt; And if you come right down and pin it right down, you'll find out the colors will finally show. &gt;&gt; If you get weary, I'm just going to have you stand for a moment, but You're all right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Abel saw, Abraham saw, Job saw, Amos saw. Now I want to spend the last part of the service on what God saw. God, he looked down and he saw a little lamb being sacrificed. He says there the poor little lamb just a dying bleeding and bleeding and the blood flying out like that bathing his little wool and God looked down and said God God who fills all time and space whether you go 10 million light years I can't understand this this God but I can't understand what I'm walking on how can I understand God this God looked down on on a on a lamb and something was coming out of his throat and and a and a chemistry of blood was bathing his wool and he said it's bleeding and kicking in his life throws and God looked on it and said that's right &gt;&gt; now I've been spending a lot of hours and I wish I could be more eloquent I wish I could be have a more understanding of the subject. But I have been thinking about out of this mind of God that made all of these things and manifold untold millions and millions of species of things we know nothing about. But in that mind when he made Adam and formed him out of the dust of the earth and of all of the mechanism and the systems within him, he put in his veins blood and a certain composition, a certain molecular system of blood. Blood when you're cut it will coagulate. Blood that has has the life principle in it. Blood that has held man in mystery. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Long before science understood that it was even a circulatory system. Blood heathens who knew had no education whatsoever. They always thought that blood they had blood rights. Different peoples of the earth centuries and centuries and centuries ago had blood rights because blood had something something about it. And they were interested in their in their blood brothers and and how they would make uh blood. Even today you know people want to say well if we write it in blood uh blood has something special and today in our day the blood has become an extremely intriguing and interesting substance and just this congregation here and those that are hearing me and throughout the world I can tell you that every Hey, there are millions, untold millions of technicians that are examining through the best optics they have, the blood, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they're watching at things that are moving that you and I have no knowledge of. They're watching at things that are moving. And then they write the report and send it to the doctor. And the doctor calls you and you sit in his office. He says, I don't have very good news for you. Our people have looked at your blood and you're a very sick person. You have leukemia or you have uh cickle cell anemia or you have some other blood disorder and there's great lists of them which I've looked at and I said this would boggle the people's mind. These are sick people. There's a blood and he discovered the cancer in the blood. And at the season when this thing would start to start to spiral on a high incline of diseases, knowing nothing of AIDS at that time. And God is preparing prophet optics for this generation &gt;&gt; and getting ready to send them out. And an angel from the presence of God comes to him says nothing is going to stand before your prayers. Not even cancer. &gt;&gt; Not even nothing &gt;&gt; will stand before your prayers. Not even cancer. And if you can get the people to believe, not believe in God, believe in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he was God's messenger. If you can get the people to believe, nothing will stand before your prayers, not even cancer. And that thing now, he said it's a disease of this age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And men have been studying it. And now a prophet stands with a grade seven education. Now he said it's a cell. And you maybe injure yourself and you have a bruise and a cell there and it becomes a wild cell. and that wild cell begins to sap the life or you get a tumor and a tumor uh fastens itself to the body. It's like a growth on a tree and it begins to sap the life out of the tree and that never never escapes my mind as I've stood by the bedside of those who have a cancer or a tumor and a tumor is sapping all the life and all the food that they can give that individual. It just takes the life out from them. And that's why I I've prayed I have prayed, "Oh God, give me a ringside seat. When you cast this demon of cancer into the lake of fire, I want to stand there and throw my hands up and rejoice. &gt;&gt; It's over and it's done. And that demon will never plague another person." How real this is to our brother Kim Dingwald and I never knew he would be here today whose daughter with leukemia for eight years and you have seen the video. If you haven't, you may get it. And I tell you, she's a angel of a of a young woman. And how the father and mother stood by that child and the church and the prayers of the saints from wherever and why she had to go through it for eight years. I know not. But she lives today. She lives today. God has delivered her from that today. Nothing will stand before your prayers, not even cancer. If you can get the people to believe and that same message that came out of the lips of that angel, those words still stand true this morning. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, this one died and that one died and whatever." Brother Brandham said, "If I prayed for 500 and 500 all died," he said, "By the next morning, I still believe in divine healing." We can't change it because of the circumstance we see. This is still true. This can never change. This is God's word and we see the evidence. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But there was something in God's mind. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry for the time, but I I have to go on just a little bit. &gt;&gt; And something in God's mind and he put the substance of the blood together. And then and the animal kingdom, they cannot give us a transfusion. But one human to another, we can all give each other transfusion. Doesn't matter what background we come from, what the color of our skin is. We may, he made all man of one blood. And we can give each other transfusion if that would be necessary. And God saw this. And now Abel by revelation saw it was blood. It was blood. And blood need to be shed. And he said the blood because he saw the coming of Jesus Christ. He saw another lamb. &gt;&gt; And God looked on it and said, "That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the blood was transferred from the animal to the ground." &gt;&gt; And because of that, he came under the hand of another one whose name was Cain. And Cain transferred the first human blood from a body to the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God had cursed the earth &gt;&gt; and Abel's blood couldn't redeem it. &gt;&gt; But the lamb that he saw coming could redeem it. &gt;&gt; Help me out, folks. &gt;&gt; Pull on the word. Now, &gt;&gt; Satan hates the blood, but we love the blood. &gt;&gt; The blood signifies his defeat. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every demon of hell is fearful of the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just hold it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God would take of the earth and prepare a body. &gt;&gt; But before that body would be formed, God himself wrapped himself in a human cell. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the womb of a woman called Mary &gt;&gt; and began to form a body &gt;&gt; with a holy newly created blood of Almighty God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when God said to Moses, &gt;&gt; you will slay a lamb and you'll put the blood upon the lentil and the doorpost of the door. And when I see the blood, he wasn't interested in seeing the paint of an animal on the doorpost or on the lentil. It wasn't the chemistry of the blood. But when God saw the blood, it was more than a human microscope. in your laboratory. God was looking to the blood. There was a new blood. There was a newly creation blood. He's going to create blood. And in that blood will be no disease. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that blood will not be subjected to any disease. &gt;&gt; There'll be no homophobia. There'll be no anemia. There'll be no leukemia. There'll be no age. There'll be no disease in that blood. And I'm going to redeem the earth, &gt;&gt; with this blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to redeem my sons and my daughters with this blood. &gt;&gt; I'm going to paint the earth with this blood. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to bring every son and daughter back to the back to my house &gt;&gt; with this blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No scientist and no doctor has ever looked at the blood like our father looked at the blood. &gt;&gt; When he looked at the blood, I tell you what, he saw every cell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he saw a people that would have the DNA of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And today I have the DNA of the Son of God. Every born again believer has a DNA of the image of God. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You can put yourself where you want but I put myself there. &gt;&gt; I have his DNA and in every cell of your body is the image of your entire being is your is your code. every cell of your body and the DNA comes under the examination of their kind of microscope and every cell of your body carries every part of your whole molecular makeup. &gt;&gt; And just think of it when God saw the blood. &gt;&gt; So when I see the blood, &gt;&gt; I'll pass over you. &gt;&gt; But he's looking to another day. He's looking to another time. He's looking to another blood. that was just in type. And once again, it was the blood of an animal that was transferred to the ground or to a basin. &gt;&gt; And that's blood from Genesis to Revelation. &gt;&gt; But then came the lamb, &gt;&gt; the lamb of God, &gt;&gt; who God allowed Mary to eat of the substance of the earth, and a body was formed. But in that body was the life cell of Almighty God. was the blood of almighty God quad. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then that blood was transferred from the body exactly as Cain did to Abel. So did the Romans and the Jews do to Jesus Christ and transferred that blood from a body to the earth. &gt;&gt; Where did the blood go? Blood went to the soil of the earth and bathed the earth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the spirit and the prophet says, &gt;&gt; I have all of these quotes of the prophet says there's a a blood &gt;&gt; and there's a life in the blood. &gt;&gt; And the life that's in the blood &gt;&gt; is the nature of the soul. &gt;&gt; And that life that was in the blood is the token. &gt;&gt; Remember, not the blood itself, &gt;&gt; but the blood is a sign. And when I see the sign, when I see the evidence that a life has been taken, then I'll pass over you. And in the New Testament is when I see the evidence that a life has returned. &gt;&gt; Then I'll pass over you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The life that had been taken is returned. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to pass over you. And so &gt;&gt; there is a process which I mentioned a lot earlier and I said it would mean something later on. &gt;&gt; There was a process by which the &gt;&gt; the blood it was actually before it was blood it was word. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; God created all things by his word. &gt;&gt; And so it went from word to blood. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Animal blood that Abel transferred from an animal to the ground that Moses and the Israelites transferred from the animal to the ground. And uh and uh uh that was animal blood and a human blood that Cain transferred from Abel to the ground and the Romans and the Jews transferred from G the body of Jesus Christ to the ground. But they couldn't get at the life. &gt;&gt; The life went back down into the roots. &gt;&gt; They couldn't get at the life. &gt;&gt; When they wanted to stone him, they wanted to get at the life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham says, "They don't hate me. It's my message they hate. &gt;&gt; It's a message. &gt;&gt; You're nice people, but people don't want to believe what you believe." &gt;&gt; Because I have a problem with that, &gt;&gt; but it's the life. And so now watch the transfer of the life. It went from the mouth of God from the word of God became substance and the substance some in type. And in Christ's case in reality the substance went to the earth from where it came. But God in his mind had a substance of such a construction and such a makeup such a marvel that it would intrigue all mankind. for the way of the the way of the blood, blood brothers, blood lines, all of these things. And then when Christ's blood was shed and he went to the tomb, the sephiler, and the spir holy spirit raised him, the same holy spirit that gave conception. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the holy spirit shall overshadow you, Mary, &gt;&gt; and that which is conceived in thee is of the holy ghost. So it was the life that conceived Christ. &gt;&gt; God's spirit &gt;&gt; came and there was a conception in the womb of Mary and came Jesus and he died. He's in the sephiler. The same spirit raise him up again &gt;&gt; out of the sear &gt;&gt; and he comes before his disciples and he's and they said it's a spirit. He says the spirit hath not flesh and bones. He says nothing of blood. &gt;&gt; The blood was shed. have you anything to eat? They give him a honeycomb and some fish. He eats it and passes out of their out of their vision, &gt;&gt; but it's not gone. He just passed out of their vision &gt;&gt; of what they could see there, but he still was there. &gt;&gt; He just gone someplace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister, I just tell you, I feel like doing a dance &gt;&gt; before God. How great is our God? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How magnificent. Who wouldn't want to serve this kind of God? &gt;&gt; And then and then the life from the blood essentially. So they call it the blood because the very essence of the blood is transferred now and it come back down. It comes to word again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word came into flesh &gt;&gt; into the church. &gt;&gt; And the church became the living organism &gt;&gt; of almighty God by the very substance of the blood &gt;&gt; and man listen close now. And man in all of his uniqueness of his civilization and his advancement and the prophet took us through countdown how we've advanced with our inventions and civilization went on and on and we discovered all kinds of chemicals, all kinds of substances and all kinds of inventions. And the more we discovered, the prophet simply says, the more death came &gt;&gt; and we went on the world, as Amos would see it, and I will say it today, it's gone on into its depth of its debauchery, &gt;&gt; vile, unclean. So unclean it is that you can scarcely go to a supermarket to buy food for right there at the cash desk is all the unclean magazines which your children have to see. I say God save us &gt;&gt; from this Sodom and Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; And there's nothing that can save you except he left us a seed which is the word of God which has the blood. and when I see the blood, I'll pass over you. &gt;&gt; And so he took the substance of the blood and put it back into word again. So a prophet at the end time would take and peel it all back and say, "Now here it is. &gt;&gt; It's a bleeding word. &gt;&gt; Bleeding word." &gt;&gt; And that word, I'll confirm that word in the mouth of a messenger. I'll confirm my word in the mouth of a prophet and it will work exactly as it's always worked. &gt;&gt; And the word has the blood in it. &gt;&gt; And that is what God is saying. When I see the blood, &gt;&gt; I'll pass over you. &gt;&gt; When I see that blood, I'll pass over you. &gt;&gt; And while man advanced, he discovered that he was coming with new diseases. And the more they came, the more they must examine the blood. &gt;&gt; Yes, other parts of your body, but your blood. My doctor told me once, he said, "You can have all the stress tests. You can go through all of the test for your heart, but he said, he said, until they actually do a blood test, they cannot tell if you've had a heart attack. You can have a heart attack and it won't show anywhere else, but you can't fool the blood. &gt;&gt; It will show up in the blood. The earth is racked today. It's reeling under the impact of AIDS in our generation. In the United States, there was Uh just give me a moment. These are deaths in 2003. The cumulative estimated number of deaths of persons with AIDS through 2003 is 524,060 persons, including 518,568 adults and adolescents and 5,492 children under the age of 13. And the world being what they are in fact is there is just under world leaders at a special general assembly session on AIDS in June 2011 pledged to halt and reverse by 2015 the pandemic that has cost 28 million lives. 3.1 million last year alone. 28 million. That's over half the number that died in the entire Second World War. It's a disease of this age and of this generation. Why don't you just sit quiet now? It is a immune deficiency within the blood. And so a person who gets in that state and we've had a couple uh a couple brothers not not AIDS of course but from uh their blood became totally because they had to be treated and their blood became like 100% immune lack of immunity. no immunity left said you can't be at church you can't be around any people you can't because you have no immunity your immunity system we've had to give you l we've had to give you chemo therapy etc etc so man is doing everything that he can and we're not opposed to that we're happy that he does that but it's not the answer they don't have an answer and brother Brandham said in his message it's prophet optics I see diseases coming. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That they'll find no remedy for. &gt;&gt; The United Nations can spend as many billions as they want. They'll find no remedy for it. &gt;&gt; And it is wreaking havoc. It's taking entire generations of people out of countries &gt;&gt; in Africa, in other countries. It's taking entire generations &gt;&gt; of young men and young women out of the society and setting those nations back many years. And it was civilization and the advancement and the lust for uh their lifestyle and whatever more and and because of the garden. What started in the garden can only end now in the most perverted form and they can say what they want but God has a sentence on it. &gt;&gt; And it's not a it's not a mystery that it comes to the blood. &gt;&gt; That's right. Okay, just stop. While all this advancement's been going on, the church has advanced. And while they advanced, the church started out having the word. I hope I have your attention. Having the word in it, the bleeding word. And man got involved. Man began to sew his thoughts and weakened the word and brought in false doctrine and brought in false teaching and the word and the church became immobilized and the church became sick and the church and finally a prophet comes in end time and peels it back with the optics and says you're anemic. you're pale. &gt;&gt; There's something wrong with the blood. And you tried to tell them that they don't have they don't have the remedy &gt;&gt; within the church. You don't have the remedy in the church. And your systems and your choirs and your great preachers and all of these things will not heal the church. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing, only one thing. It'll be a transfusion from Almighty God from Emmanuel's veins. And the blood of those veins came back into the word. &gt;&gt; I tell you, my brother and my sister, the blood today is nothing less than thus saith the Lord with God himself backing it up. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in what people say, thus sayeth the Lord. I've heard lots of it. I've heard all kinds of prophecies that never happened. &gt;&gt; And they can't come from God. &gt;&gt; And if you've heard them too, they did not come from God. God cannot proclaim a lie. He proclaims the truth. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I need the support of this congregation because I told you before I started, the devil hates this subject. He hates the blood. But this blood of this word has signaled his defeat. And there's not a power in hell or on earth that can withstand this word. &gt;&gt; This word, this word is destined for eternity. &gt;&gt; This word has called the bride of Jesus Christ to a rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's the blood. &gt;&gt; That blood now has been transferred back. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it came from the Holy Spirit and gave life to the word. &gt;&gt; And the believer, the word was proclaimed through the mouth of a messenger. And by believing the word which is thus sayaith the Lord &gt;&gt; through prophet optics. By believing it, you have the blood &gt;&gt; of the covenant, &gt;&gt; the blood of redemption. And the devil wants people to believe, ah, I don't have to believe that. I tell you, there is blood nowhere else. &gt;&gt; There were many messiahs in the time of Jesus Christ. There were many messiahs that had risen up. Many before, and there's been many since, but there was only one that had that blood in him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this is the blood of the covenant. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry for having kept you, &gt;&gt; but when you see the church in its anemic condition, &gt;&gt; it's hemophilic uh uh just lost the name right now, but anemic condition and there's many anemic types of blood diseases and hemophilia. You have all of these things, but they would have their their equal within the whole church order. Tell me, what is a church without the blood of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; What is a church? What is this building here? Nothing. &gt;&gt; This building would be a boore &gt;&gt; without the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What are we as a people without the purchased blood of Jesus Christ, the blood of redemption? We're nothing. We're lost decrepid humans &gt;&gt; walking on the brittle threads of time. &gt;&gt; But when we can say, "I heard a voice. &gt;&gt; I heard thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; I heard a prophet message." And he peeled back all of the mysteries and said, "Here it is, children. And if you believe it, you have life. &gt;&gt; And if you disbelieve it, &gt;&gt; there's nothing but judgment." And the people said, "His blood be upon us and upon our children," said the Jews. &gt;&gt; And suffered incredible centuries because of that statement this morning. I just want to leave you with these thoughts. I want you to ponder them. And if God allows me, I will come back. I've been along. But Acts 2:28 says, "The church purchased with his blood." &gt;&gt; Wasn't the chemistry. The chemistry is already in the ground. &gt;&gt; And Romans 3:25 says, "Through faith in his blood." Where's the blood? Do I have to try to have faith in the chemistry, the paint that went into the ground? No. God. He's got this process. It went from word into the into the body and from the body it was spilled. You know, it's strange. This is unique. Excuse me for carrying on. I realize I'm long, but this time you won't tell me to preach longer. go from the mind of God and he creates that blood in Abel and Cain transfers it from Abel to the ground. And notice what God says soon as he comes. He comes to Cain says the voice &gt;&gt; of your brother's blood &gt;&gt; crith to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. didn't say the head that you struck or the bones that you broke or whatever other member of his body for he is made up like you and I. God made no reference to any other injury of this man or how he was slain. But he said the voice [Applause] &gt;&gt; of the blood, &gt;&gt; there was something in there. You'll never find that voice in a microscope. But the word of God speaks about it. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, my brother, my sister, of all the martyrs, of all the martyrs that stood for the word, that have been slaying, their voice, I don't care whether they've been burned or drowned or eaten by lions and gone out in their waste, the voice of their blood sounds on and continues to speak &gt;&gt; and it says something significant. and way over into the New Testament speaks of the same blood of Abel &gt;&gt; that the blood of Jesus Christ speaketh better things. &gt;&gt; So even though the blood spoke out of the ground to God, God within his great infinite mercy, it's all right, Abel. It's all right. It's all right. You're in paradise. But there's coming another blood that'll replace yours, that'll speak better things. There's coming a blood of perfection. There's coming a blood of a such an insignificant I mean such incredible power that nothing can overcome the power of this blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And my friends &gt;&gt; whatever you want to think of me is fine. But when we've heard a message today we say I've heard a message. I've heard a voice. &gt;&gt; I want to close by making announcement to you. You have heard the voice &gt;&gt; of the blood &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Crying &gt;&gt; from the ground, &gt;&gt; transferred into the church and came out through a mouth of his messenger. You have heard the voice of the blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know what that does to you, but I tell you what, it brings Jesus Christ right here. I just feel like I want to embrace him and hug him and wash his feet and kiss his feet. Oh, how we love him. &gt;&gt; This blessed lamb of God. &gt;&gt; How we give him all praise and all glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why don't you stand? &gt;&gt; I want you to feel free. This is not a church building where we just come to have a meeting. This is where we come to worship him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sister Beth, I didn't see you. God bless you. Here we have talking about her and here she is sitting in the in the church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, the blood will never lose its power. No, never. No, never. Do you think you could sing it appropriately today? Jesus blood will never lose its power. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Have you heard his voice? &gt;&gt; Jesus blood. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let me hear it. No never. No never. [Applause] My Jesus blood for sin forever and will never my Jesus will never lose his power. No, no, never. My Jesus blood forever and will never [Music] for it reaches the highest mountain. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Let our sisters lift it up. [Music] Oh, [Music] great. [Music] [Applause] [Music] All the brothers. [Music] Oh, happy give him praise now. A [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] will never [Music] once again [Applause] flow. bountiful flow of Calvary &gt;&gt; and it has reached even to us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh God somehow I pray that this very atmosphere will just continue on throughout the day and may the people return. May the spirit, oh God, the Holy Spirit who has give authorship to the word of God that the word that is a bleeding word, &gt;&gt; how we thank you for it today. We thank you for your word. We thank you for all of the examples that you have left and how it has been opened up, Lord, and how you have allowed us to peer through prophet optics and to see things we could in no wise see any other way. And Lord, we give you praise as a company of people today. We say, "Praise be to God who has done this glorious thing." &gt;&gt; And you hear the voice of the blood of Jesus Christ. And we have heard that voice. &gt;&gt; And it has said spoke glorious things to us. &gt;&gt; You're justified. &gt;&gt; Oh, the voice says you're justified. &gt;&gt; The blood says you're justified. The blood says there's no sin against you. &gt;&gt; The blood says you're without spot and without wrinkle. The blood has spoken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, we bless your name, Lord. &gt;&gt; We give you praise. &gt;&gt; I ask that the people, Lord, will be able to depart this place and remain in a sacred atmosphere. I pray, oh God, that you'll send us now that we may be refreshed and return this evening. Anoint our brother Ernie mightily. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isn't it a marvelous sacred atmosphere? [Music] and marvelous friends. I hope you'll take these things just honestly in the depths of my heart. I've been just so getting so deep that just I it it trails off and I lose it. I just lose the depths of it. Greater depths. I feel like there's just so much out there. And I would encourage you, each one, reach out there and lay hold of it. Say, "God, make a reality to me what brother Biscll couldn't even say this morning. Make it a reality to me. Don't let me just and don't let yourself be satisfied just to hear, you know, the words that I've uttered. But may you say, there's some depths there that go beyond what he could utter, and only the Holy Spirit knows those." And place it into my heart, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ. I tell you, my friends, there's coming a day very, very soon. We're not going to be here anymore. You're going to be swept out of here. Redeemed, redeemed, redeemed by that blood, redeemed by that bleeding word. I say, God bless you in the name of Jesus Christ. And go be refreshed. And we'll see you this evening. Lord willing, you're dismissed. God bless you. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Music]
