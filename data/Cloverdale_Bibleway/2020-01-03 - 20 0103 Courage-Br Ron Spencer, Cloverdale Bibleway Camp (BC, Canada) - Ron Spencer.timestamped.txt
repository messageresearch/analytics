[0:02] be
[0:04] your name.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift your name, your holy name.
[0:09] We'll start with the first verse. Happy
[0:12] New Year.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you this evening. Welcome to
[0:15] the house of the Lord tonight. Trust
[0:17] everyone's feeling well. It's Friday
[0:19] night. It's 2020.
[0:22] It's only the 3, but here we are. Is
[0:26] wonderful to be in the house of the
[0:28] Lord. The watch night service was
[0:30] absolutely fabulous. The reports that
[0:32] have come in was it was the best of the
[0:34] best, brother Tom again.
[0:38] So, God bless you. It's nice to be here.
[0:41] We're privileged to have our brother Ron
[0:42] Spencer with us this evening already
[0:44] seated on the platform.
[0:48] Amen. Amen.
[0:52] Oh, this is like Christmas.
[0:55] and we get to look at the gift that God
[0:58] has sent us sitting on the platform and
[1:00] we can anticipate with great
[1:02] anticipation as he comes to the pulpit
[1:04] this evening. So, I think that's
[1:06] wonderful. We're going to have the
[1:07] junior choir that practiced and was
[1:10] ready, I'm sorry, young people's choir
[1:12] that was ready for watch night. We're
[1:14] going to have them come in a few moments
[1:15] and sing. I see our brother Peter Ivano
[1:18] is up there. We're going to have you
[1:19] come down and pray for us in just a
[1:21] minute to start the service. our pastor
[1:23] Ivan Enko from Tacoma, Seattle, Reon,
[1:26] Belleview, the whole area down there.
[1:28] It's a couple million people to be
[1:30] pastor over. It's a big job. We're happy
[1:32] you're doing it.
[1:34] Amen. So, we'll just sing this song and
[1:36] maybe another song and we'll have
[1:38] Brother Peter come and pray. We just
[1:39] want to relax in the presence of the
[1:41] Lord and drink it all in tonight. Amen.
[1:47] Lord, my heart can grow
[1:53] so far away
[1:55] and cold. His promise is true. And yet
[2:00] for me, your love is still the same.
[2:11] Lord, I bend my knee
[2:17] in awe and fear of thee.
[2:23] My head bowed down in reence to your
[2:29] name.
[2:34] Lord, I live
[2:38] your name.
[2:41] for your holy
[2:45] name.
[2:47] your home
[2:53] and
[2:59] you're the
[3:06] reason
[3:11] my comfort
[3:17] and
[3:18] keep
[3:24] Lord my heart's desire to be filled
[3:30] with the spirit by my purpose. Lord,
[3:37] &gt;&gt; I want to worship you.
[3:40] You alone
[3:47] Oh,

[3:53] to worship and adore.

[5:12] Heat.
[5:24] Hey, heat. Hey, heat.
[5:35] and king.
[5:40] The battle is the Lord's.
[5:48] There is a soul
[5:53] in time of need
[5:58] that gives me hope.
[6:02] and bring me peace
[6:07] in every trial
[6:13] through every test.
[6:18] I say
[6:24] so you are
[6:30] Yeah.
[6:40] And I remember
[6:55] the battle.
[7:00] And when the water

[7:49] and just remember
[8:03] the valley.

[9:34] Hallelujah.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Peter, if you can make your way
[9:37] down just now, that would be wonderful.
[9:42] Hallelujah.
[9:44] Oh, the Lord isn't He isn't bothered by
[9:46] storms, friends. He isn't bothered by
[9:49] winds. He's not bothered by waves. He's
[9:52] not bothered by trials that we feel are
[9:55] going to envelop us and push us under
[9:58] cuz he sees us all the way through.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; He's seen us on the other side.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; We have to see ourselves on the other
[10:06] side.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; It'll help us through these times. As
[10:09] our brother Peter comes, we do want to
[10:11] remember a request for brother John
[10:14] Lafontaine. He's in critical condition
[10:16] in the hospital in ICU for heart issues.
[10:19] So, we just want to remember him tonight
[10:22] in prayer. The Lord will hold his hand
[10:24] through this storm. Brother Peter, so
[10:26] nice to have you here.
[10:29] Pray with us tonight. Thank you.
[10:32] And let's all bow our heads.

[13:08] with somebody standing near you.
[13:11] Say, "God bless you and welcome them to
[13:13] the service." Might be somebody that's
[13:16] new here this evening. We want to
[13:18] welcome you in the lovely name of our
[13:20] Lord Jesus Christ. Those that are
[13:22] streaming and connected by way of the
[13:23] internet, want to welcome you as well.
[13:25] Oh, God bless you as you have your
[13:27] seats. If we could just have the young
[13:28] people's choir that was prepared to sing
[13:31] on watch night come on up. We don't want
[13:33] to delay the service too long. We want
[13:35] to enjoy all that the Lord has for us
[13:39] through our brother Ron Spencer this
[13:40] evening. So, we'll just have this
[13:42] special and then we'll maybe brother Tom
[13:45] will come right after the young people
[13:47] sing this evening.

[13:53] from watch night. So, we're going to
[13:54] have those on Sunday as well. We'll have
[13:56] both services on Sunday. Regular time,

[14:06] musicians, the effort, and all the hard
[14:07] work that went into watch night. Let's
[14:09] appreciate them, can we?
[14:12] Amen.
[14:20] Beautiful. All right.
[14:52] I know Lord
[14:55] your plan for me
[15:00] is right.
[15:05] And I need you
[15:08] to fulfill your
[15:11] purpose in my life.
[15:17] I submit to you my king.

[16:53] and waiting to see what you will do.
[17:02] Lord, you know what's best.

[17:57] I surrender.
[18:02] Oh Lord, I surrender my life.
[18:10] I give it all to you.
[18:13] I give it all.
[18:18] I
[18:20] surrender, Lord. I surrender.
[18:28] Oh Lord, I surrender my life.
[18:33] I give it all
[18:36] to you.
[18:39] Take my life.
[18:42] I

[18:55] I surrender my life.
[19:01] I give it all to you.

[19:45] Oh Lord, I surrender my life.
[19:52] I give it all to you,
[19:58] Lord. I surrender my life
[20:06] and give it all to you.
[20:31] Just before brother Spencer comes, I
[20:35] want to say a few words.
[20:38] And uh
[20:40] these words have to do with the
[20:42] supernatural.
[20:44] This is a supernatural gospel
[20:47] &gt;&gt; and those who have given themselves to
[20:50] it experience supernatural things. I'm
[20:54] so glad I can stand here tonight and say
[20:57] it's a supernatural gospel.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; And we have a preacher that's a
[21:02] supernatural, believes in the
[21:04] supernatural. I say God bless him. And
[21:07] God bless you for coming.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; God bless you for being here. It will
[21:12] not be in vain.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've already been prayed for. I
[21:19] have prayed for you. And we have prayed
[21:22] for you.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; I prayed for you before we came.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Prepare the people
[21:29] &gt;&gt; for this supernatural gospel. One thing
[21:32] about it, we don't know what's going to
[21:33] happen.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't know what's going to
[21:37] happen.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's going to happen, but
[21:42] we're ready for it.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; We sure are.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Dad.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful atmosphere.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; My hope is in the Lord. You can start
[21:53] playing that as we introduce our
[21:55] precious brother Ron Ron Spencer. I feel
[21:58] very privileged tonight to have I feel
[22:01] like a bookend, the father of the faith
[22:04] on one side and brother Ron Spencer on
[22:07] the other side. Amen. I'm so thankful
[22:10] that we've had a pastor that's
[22:12] influenced lives around the world. And
[22:16] not one of us on this platform would be
[22:18] what we are if it wasn't for the man of
[22:20] God in this corner right here.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he's influenced not just only
[22:25] my life, brother Ron's life, Tim,
[22:27] Brother John, but many that will be
[22:29] listening tonight. And so I know there
[22:31] will be people in Europe listening,
[22:33] there will be people around North
[22:34] America listening to this message. And
[22:36] we like to welcome you in the name of
[22:38] the Lord Jesus Christ. Join with us as
[22:40] we worship the true and living God, a
[22:43] God that is a present God in time of
[22:46] trouble. I looked at uh back in history
[22:49] here and brother Ron has a long history
[22:52] 14 years of history with us
[22:55] and I started to do this
[22:57] addition and subtraction in my life and
[22:59] I said that's a big part of my life
[23:02] and how he's affected not just my life
[23:05] my wife's life my children's life but
[23:08] your lives we can say amen and if I said
[23:13] well if have brother Ron affected your
[23:15] lives his ministry. Has his life
[23:18] affected your lives? His wife, Sister
[23:20] Connie, I know she's here. She's come
[23:22] all the way. But brother Ron, where are
[23:24] you, Sister Connie? We want to welcome
[23:26] you, too, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[23:28] Christ.
[23:30] It's a great effort. We're thankful to
[23:33] the Lord for that. So, I'd like you to
[23:36] stand as we ask Brother Ron Spencer to
[23:40] come. And of course, he doesn't need any
[23:42] real introduction to this assembly. He's
[23:45] a man of God used of God that God has
[23:48] him here for a particular reason. And I
[23:52] know that if your expectation is high,
[23:54] you're going to get what you expect. My
[23:57] hope
[23:59] is in the Lord
[24:04] within the presence of the Lord.
[24:11] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[24:17] lie.
[24:20] For whom the rageing of the seed
[24:26] of son
[24:30] living.
[24:34] He's the only source
[24:37] of life.
[24:39] Heat.
[24:43] Heat.
[25:08] Let me sing it one more time.
[25:11] I know.
[25:20] Oh,
[25:23] this
[25:36] is
[25:45] God bless you.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:50] Happy new year.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; I'd like to say boo devil.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; We're still standing.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, we are.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's targeted us in many ways to
[26:03] try to destroy our path, but we're still
[26:06] here.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; I bring you greetings from a lot of
[26:09] places and and especially home. My
[26:12] father and and many others. And just
[26:16] just before I I came out, uh, Brother
[26:19] Donnie Reagan and Brother Tim Puit and
[26:21] many many want to say hello to you.
[26:24] You're not alone in this battle. And,
[26:26] uh, we certainly love you with all of
[26:29] our hearts and are so honored to be here
[26:31] for you. And I I uh, thank you for
[26:34] coming out on a stormy Friday evening.
[26:36] And some of your lights are out, but the
[26:39] light's not out here.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We certainly love you with all of
[26:42] our hearts. I would certainly thrilled
[26:46] to have my wife with me and and uh we
[26:48] were she wasn't coming and just
[26:51] yesterday we got her ticket or two days
[26:54] ago we got a ticket and she was able to
[26:56] come and they worked it out. She sat
[26:59] right beside of me on every flight. And
[27:01] and I just for those that fly a bit, you
[27:04] know, that's supernatural within itself.
[27:06] And and so we just are so thankful that
[27:09] she's here. And so we we certainly love
[27:12] you with all of our hearts. And I too
[27:15] come with great expectation
[27:17] &gt;&gt; that God would just do some mighty
[27:19] things among us.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you will turn with me to Joshua
[27:23] chapter 1 this evening.
[27:30] I've just been burdened on my heart for
[27:32] about the last month to to speak this
[27:37] weekend on courage.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Glory,
[27:43] &gt;&gt; sir.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; And after the songs I heard sung
[27:46] tonight, it sounds like we're just right
[27:49] in tune,
[27:50] &gt;&gt; right on right on target. And so the
[27:53] words that's been said over the last
[27:55] couple of weeks here just we just fall
[27:58] right into the channel.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; And we know God knows everything.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:06] Joshua 1 and verse 5.
[28:10] I love it when God speaks to us.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; You know, it's it's a whole lot
[28:14] different when our favorite preacher
[28:16] talks to us,
[28:18] &gt;&gt; but when God talks to us, it's a whole
[28:20] different thing. Right.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; And he's always accurate.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; And and the word is not so much time
[28:30] sensitive. It doesn't have an expiration
[28:33] date to it.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; And if he's talking to Joshua, he's also
[28:37] talking to you.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's these were words to
[28:42] brother Brandham as well.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; But they're not just words to brother
[28:46] Brandham. They're words to you. Amen.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; I would like and maybe you've read this
[28:50] thousands of time, but I'd like for you
[28:52] this weekend to look at these words as
[28:55] as though God is speaking to you.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; There shall not any man be able to stand
[29:04] before thee all the days of thy life.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; As I was with Moses,
[29:13] so I will be with thee.
[29:16] I will not fail thee,
[29:18] &gt;&gt; nor forsake thee. That's enough to shout
[29:21] about the rest of the weak.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Be strong and of a good courage.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; For unto this people thou shalt divide
[29:31] for an inheritance the land which I
[29:34] swear unto their fathers to give them.
[29:38] Only be thou strong and very courageous,
[29:40] that thou mayest observe to do according
[29:43] to all the law which Moses my servant
[29:47] commanded thee. Turn not from the from
[29:50] it to the right hand or to the left,
[29:53] that thou mayest prosper whethersoever
[29:56] thou goest. The book of the law shall
[29:59] not depart out of thy mouth, but thou
[30:02] shalt meditate therein day and night,
[30:05] that thou mayest observe to do according
[30:08] to all that is written therein.
[30:12] For then thou shalt make thy way
[30:15] prosperous, and then thou shalt have
[30:18] good success.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and
[30:25] of a good courage. Be not afraid,
[30:29] neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord
[30:32] thy God is with thee whethersoever thou
[30:36] goest.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; How many would have a need this weekend
[30:39] that you just like to say, brother Ron,
[30:42] I want to just bring this to Jesus now.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; And I'm just asking a supernatural God
[30:48] to to wave across this building now.
[30:51] Almighty God, how we love you with all
[30:54] of our hearts
[30:59] &gt;&gt; and we invite you
[31:01] &gt;&gt; to come and speak to our hearts.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; We have prayed and prepared ourselves
[31:07] and studied and laid aside time and you
[31:11] spoke to our hearts.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; But now, Lord Jesus, we ask you that you
[31:16] take charge of the even the
[31:19] molecules of this room.
[31:22] Lord, I pray that you would take your
[31:24] word and place it to our hearts and may
[31:27] it go like a dart to the center part,
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Lord. And Lord, I ask you that not only
[31:36] as a speaker, but also hearers tonight
[31:38] that we could get ourselves out of the
[31:40] way.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Forgive us of our every mistake and our
[31:44] every humanity. Father,
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, we look to you now
[31:49] &gt;&gt; as we begin a new year. We look to you
[31:52] to give us the strength and you're our
[31:55] source of life, our source of strength
[31:58] and courage.
[32:00] And now we ask you, Father, that you
[32:02] touch our hearts.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Bless this audience now. We pray in
[32:07] Jesus Christ's name we ask. Amen and
[32:09] amen and amen. God bless you. You may be
[32:13] seated.
[32:18] It has certainly been an honor over the
[32:20] last last while to be able to speak with
[32:24] your pastor and and the and brother Tom
[32:27] as well and and um in meetings that have
[32:31] just been passed and and it just seems
[32:34] to go so quickly. Yeah,
[32:36] &gt;&gt; it's been such an honor to stand with
[32:38] these great men and and be with them and
[32:41] Milco, you included.
[32:44] We love you and we have so such a great
[32:47] admiration and brother Ed has been such
[32:49] a mentor to me and such a great strength
[32:52] to my life and and uh I just I just I I
[32:57] don't have enough adequate words to say
[32:59] and it would take me the rest of the
[33:00] evening to say how much that brother Ed
[33:02] has meant to me through the years.
[33:05] And uh you say, "Well, brother Ron, get
[33:08] on with business." Well,
[33:12] you see, it was just about 10 or 12
[33:15] years ago that I stood in a meeting here
[33:18] with you.
[33:20] And I begin to speak about in that
[33:22] meeting that Satan couldn't touch a hair
[33:24] of his of my head until
[33:28] he had went to my father
[33:31] &gt;&gt; and got permission to do so.
[33:34] And in a matter of a few weeks, I would
[33:37] be in a fire and now lay in a coma and
[33:40] doctors would give me up and and I would
[33:44] aspirate in my lungs and and those lungs
[33:48] would fill with infection
[33:50] and and uh and it was on the day God in
[33:54] God's great orchestration,
[33:57] it was on the day the very morning to
[34:01] which that
[34:03] that doctors would give me up and give
[34:05] me no more hope. It was that day that
[34:08] your pastor,
[34:10] &gt;&gt; right,
[34:11] &gt;&gt; was in prayer and your Mount Baker camp
[34:15] that you were buying and purchasing and
[34:18] you've enjoyed these many years that I
[34:21] would be the speaker next year.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; I love it when God speaks.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[34:31] You know, we may have our critics
[34:35] &gt;&gt; and we but you know, anybody that's been
[34:38] successful is going to have critics.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; We may have our barkers and and our
[34:44] bloggers and our nonsense that goes on.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; But I'll take vindication over all of
[34:50] their nonsense.
[34:52] Yes.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; And I would like to stand here tonight
[34:55] and just once again say because God
[34:59] dealt with your pastor
[35:02] &gt;&gt; to call my wife, my son was in one
[35:06] hospital and I was in the other
[35:09] and I was in another world.
[35:12] And uh and sister Connie would listen to
[35:15] the doctors through that through the
[35:17] next few weeks saying how much that they
[35:21] had give up and it was impossible. But
[35:24] God specializes in in impossibilities.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; And not only that I would be at the
[35:32] meeting the next year, but I would be
[35:34] the speaker
[35:36] &gt;&gt; at that meeting the next year.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To God be all the glory.
[35:44] Brother Tom and I spoke in Switzerland
[35:46] together and God just did incredible
[35:48] things there and then we were Is it okay
[35:51] to to just speak a few things and I
[35:54] didn't ask permission and generally I
[35:56] don't
[36:00] and we were in the North Carolina
[36:02] brother Joe Green's meetings who also
[36:04] send his greetings and we were at
[36:07] brother Joe's mission camp that brother
[36:09] Biscll has preached many times and
[36:11] brother Tom and myself took took that
[36:13] this year and and uh I'd like to report
[36:16] to you that he did an awesome job and
[36:18] you should be proud of that.
[36:20] But on Wednesday night, we we had the
[36:23] service and I was I was speaking and and
[36:26] I just said some things that, you know,
[36:29] if if I would be given my choice, I
[36:31] would I would ask the Lord that he could
[36:34] hide me behind a curtain
[36:36] &gt;&gt; to which that that that I you wouldn't
[36:38] even see the man or even the voice would
[36:41] be so that you couldn't tell it was
[36:43] myself.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; But but God chose men to speak through.
[36:48] gave us personalities and different
[36:50] quirks about ourselves to work that that
[36:53] you that you can enjoy. We all enjoy
[36:56] squirrel hunting and stories of the
[36:58] hunting trips. love that about the
[37:00] prophet and him telling us about his
[37:03] life and and as I was standing there
[37:06] there that night I was preaching and I
[37:08] said if God could just use us behind a
[37:10] curtain as the service would go and you
[37:14] know it just seemed like that it just
[37:17] seemed like as the service would go it
[37:19] seemed like that that that that you know
[37:22] it wouldn't be a night for an altar. it
[37:24] wouldn't be a night for for a prayer
[37:26] line or anything like that. And as I
[37:29] finished and you can go and listen to it
[37:32] if you would like, but I as I finished,
[37:34] I I just stepped off of the stage and my
[37:36] son and and my deacon and brother Joe's
[37:39] deacons would be taking me off of the
[37:41] stage. And as we were leaving the stage,
[37:43] Brother Tim, as I as I stepped past the
[37:46] curtain and and you've been there and I
[37:49] stepped past the curtain and and as I
[37:52] was walking to the office, I I felt him.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Is it okay if I just testify just a
[38:00] moment?
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think, well, it's just
[38:04] another service or it's just another
[38:06] meeting that we came to. And I think we
[38:09] miss some things.
[38:11] that God comes to every service
[38:15] &gt;&gt; and even sometimes even at the end of
[38:18] how things are beginning to operate,
[38:20] he's there to do a job and he's called a
[38:22] meeting and he's got a he's got plans on
[38:25] his mind.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; You see, when God comes, he's got plans
[38:28] and he's got a mission.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; You're extremely important to him.
[38:34] And
[38:34] &gt;&gt; as I step past and I I I walked I I just
[38:38] turned and my son my I heard my son say
[38:41] it's on now
[38:43] and I turned and brother Joe Green's
[38:45] daughter
[38:46] a daughter-in-law and son was standing
[38:49] there and the Lord just spoke some
[38:51] things to her and after after some
[38:54] things were spoken brother Tim just said
[38:57] now you'll have your baby. Mhm.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; And two weeks ago, they announced
[39:03] they're having a child.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Then I stepped through and they prayed
[39:15] for another sister. And then a then
[39:17] another brother, a young man. Brother
[39:19] Michael, you'll where you're at. Brother
[39:21] Michael, you understand this? Brother
[39:23] Dwayne Jackson, whom you know.
[39:27] and and I just took him by the hand and
[39:29] I said, "You've you've rejected the call
[39:31] for for for 17 years."
[39:35] And you need a real committal to God and
[39:38] committal to your purpose. And you
[39:40] understand those things. And
[39:43] I think he's preached 12 times, the best
[39:45] of my knowledge since that time. And
[39:47] he's quite a preacher.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; There stood Brother Gido. Brother Gido
[39:55] was standing there
[39:58] and brother Go just he just walked up
[40:01] and was you there?
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Gido was standing there.
[40:07] His son came to the Lord today.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; His son came to the Lord today. Just
[40:12] only a couple hours ago came to the
[40:14] Lord. Brother Go was standing there and
[40:17] I just spoke a few things to him about
[40:19] things that was going on and and I said,
[40:22] "Brother Go, I see a train coming
[40:26] and it's okay to get on.
[40:29] You don't you don't know what you're
[40:30] saying. Just God, just Brother Joe's
[40:34] brother-in-law, his name is Terry, and
[40:37] I've known him for decades. He's a kind
[40:39] of a he's a kind of a good old boy. He
[40:41] owns a He owned the Good Old Boy Club.
[40:45] sat in church and everybody loved him
[40:47] and everybody cared for him and but he
[40:50] just didn't know the Lord.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; You know, you can sit in church for
[40:54] years and not know the Lord.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Terry was standing there
[41:00] and and he'd been the kind of friend to
[41:03] me that he had actually invited me one
[41:06] time to go hunting in his treeand.
[41:09] Not just a treeand, but
[41:11] &gt;&gt; listen, you know you've made it. His
[41:17] boys never got to hunt in his treeand
[41:25] and I sat in his treeand a few years ago
[41:28] and sat and we had we had a good time
[41:31] later and but Terry didn't know the
[41:33] Lord.
[41:35] He watched brother Tom that night as
[41:38] those things begin to happen and he told
[41:41] me he said, "I can serve a God like
[41:44] that.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; I can serve a God like that.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; I just grabbed him.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; I grabbed him and I hugged him and I
[42:00] began to pray with him.
[42:05] And Sister Betty, she took him by the
[42:07] hand as they walked out of the building.
[42:09] She said, "We were married all of those
[42:11] years."
[42:14] And she said, "I walked out of that
[42:16] building with a different man."
[42:21] &gt;&gt; To God be the glory.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Two weeks later, he would he would they
[42:28] would discover something in his chest.
[42:30] we'd have cancer.
[42:32] And just only a few weeks ago, I I stood
[42:35] at his funeral. It was one of the
[42:37] largest funerals that I've ever
[42:39] conducted.
[42:41] And I could stand there and talk about
[42:43] eternal life. Yes, sir.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Because only a few months ago, I was
[42:48] there when it happened
[42:51] &gt;&gt; and it absolutely changed his life.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[43:01] Sometimes it just takes courage to step
[43:03] from that
[43:05] &gt;&gt; that realm of humanity
[43:08] &gt;&gt; and to take God at his word
[43:16] in 1 Peter 5:8.
[43:20] Forgive me for taking that time, but I
[43:22] kind of feel like it's going to be that
[43:24] kind of a weekend.
[43:26] He said, "Be sober.
[43:29] Be vigilant
[43:31] because your adversary the devil
[43:36] &gt;&gt; as a roaring lion
[43:40] walketh about seeking whom he may
[43:43] devour."
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Every one of us have an adversary.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; The scripture mentions fear in the in
[43:52] the scripture 600 times. So, it's real.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Satan's not a paper tiger. He's
[43:59] orchestrated.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; He's a tool in the hand of God.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; But I want to remind him here tonight
[44:06] that my God
[44:08] &gt;&gt; is infinite million times greater than
[44:11] he is.
[44:13] Amen.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; When Jesus would meet him in in Matthew
[44:17] chapter 4 and when the tempter came,
[44:19] verse three came to him and said, "If
[44:22] thou be the son of God,"
[44:24] I wanted to share this with you this
[44:26] evening. Satan really didn't know if he
[44:29] was or not.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; And he was asking him about his position
[44:36] even though he had watched him have
[44:38] supernatural births.
[44:41] So the great critic came to Jesus
[44:43] himself and criticized his birth and
[44:46] then began to question him of if thou
[44:48] be. Do you not think that Satan will
[44:51] come to you and question your
[44:54] supernatural birth
[44:57] &gt;&gt; and question your stand in your
[44:59] position?
[45:01] &gt;&gt; And if it can only get you to disbelieve
[45:04] who you are
[45:06] &gt;&gt; and what you are.
[45:10] command these stones to be made bread.
[45:13] And he answered and said, it is written
[45:15] that man shall not live by bread alone,
[45:18] but by every word that proceedth out of
[45:20] the mouth of God.
[45:23] And then the devil taking him up
[45:28] into a into the holy city, and set him
[45:31] upon a pinnacle of the temple. And he
[45:32] said unto him, If thou be the son of
[45:34] God, cast thyself down. For it is
[45:37] written, he shall give his angels charge
[45:39] over concerning thee. In their hands
[45:42] shalt thou bear thee up, and lest thou
[45:44] at any time that thou should dash thy
[45:47] foot against a stone. And Jesus said
[45:50] unto him, It is written again that thou
[45:53] shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. And
[45:56] again, the devil taking him up into an
[45:58] exceedingly high mountain, showing him
[46:00] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[46:02] glory of them. And he said unto him,
[46:05] "All these things,"
[46:07] notice this, "all these things I give
[46:10] thee, if thou will fall down and worship
[46:12] me."
[46:14] And Jesus,
[46:17] and then sth Jesus unto them, Give he
[46:19] these hints. For it is written, Thou
[46:22] shalt worship the Lord thy God, and with
[46:24] him only shalt thou serve.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; And that then the devil left him.
[46:31] And behold, he came and angels came and
[46:34] ministered unto him. I want you to
[46:36] understand as a prophet begins to share
[46:38] with us. He said Jesus did not defeat
[46:41] him with power.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; He could have took his power.
[46:48] He did not defeat him with emotions.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; He defeated him with the word of God.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason every believer can
[46:58] stand here. I'm the least in the
[47:01] kingdom. Brother Brandham said it the
[47:03] least.
[47:05] Going on their knees, the kingdom of
[47:08] hell shakes.
[47:11] Amen.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; The scripture says in James chapter in 1
[47:16] verse two, "My brethren, count it all
[47:19] joy
[47:22] &gt;&gt; when you fall into diverse temptations,
[47:25] knowing this that the trying of your
[47:27] faith workketh patience,
[47:30] and but let patience have her perfect
[47:32] work, that you may be perfect and
[47:35] entire, wanting nothing."
[47:37] Amen.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Verse 12, blessed is the man
[47:44] &gt;&gt; that endureth temptation.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; For when he has tried, he shall receive
[47:50] a crown of life,
[47:52] &gt;&gt; which the Lord hath promised to give him
[47:54] them that love him. Let no man say, when
[47:58] he is tempted, I am tempted of God. For
[48:01] God cannot be tempted with evil, neither
[48:04] tempteth he any man. But every man that
[48:08] is tempted when he is drawn away of his
[48:10] own lust and enticed. And then when lust
[48:13] hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.
[48:16] When it is finished, it bringeth forth
[48:18] death.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Courage.
[48:25] I wrote some words down and had some
[48:29] actually Andrew wrote me a little bit of
[48:31] a poem
[48:33] before coming here and I want to share a
[48:35] couple of these things and
[48:39] with you
[48:42] be strong and of good courage.
[48:47] We're believers.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; We're God's sons.
[48:54] We fight.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Ken, you're a historian
[49:00] of some sort of a sorts.
[49:02] And you know in the south we're
[49:04] fighters.
[49:08] My part of the country is Stonewall
[49:10] Jackson country.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Stonewall Jackson said, "I'm as safe on
[49:15] the battlefield as I am a home on my
[49:17] pillow."
[49:21] We don't back up,
[49:25] &gt;&gt; nor do we back down,
[49:27] &gt;&gt; we fight,
[49:30] &gt;&gt; he shelters us under his wings.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; He fights our battles.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; He wins our wars.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; We cast Satan out with Holy Ghost
[49:41] boldness. He hath authorized us and
[49:44] empowered us to use the name of Jesus
[49:47] for any need at any time. And we believe
[49:50] him,
[49:53] &gt;&gt; taking him at his word by the authority
[49:56] and casting the Satan out, reminding him
[50:00] of who we are.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; We have declared, we have been declared
[50:06] by God's vindicated prophet that we are
[50:09] an invincible army.
[50:14] never be defeated.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; He wins our battles.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; He is our victory.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "We've watched
[50:29] him as a healer.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Now watch him as a warrior." Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; If any bride is prepared,
[50:40] we are
[50:42] &gt;&gt; I don't care what we face.
[50:46] It may hurt. It may sting.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Future things. We don't know what we're
[50:52] going to have to face.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; But if God be for me,
[50:59] &gt;&gt; who can be against me?
[51:02] Deuteronomy 31 and verse 8 said, "And
[51:05] the Lord, he it is that doth go before
[51:09] thee.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; He will be with thee. He will not fail
[51:13] thee,
[51:14] &gt;&gt; neither will he forsake thee.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Fear not."
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Neither be dismayed.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "When you get
[51:27] when you got the message, keep going."
[51:30] That's right.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "Say, I can't walk up again,
[51:33] and I know I'm getting weak. Just keep
[51:35] going. Don't stop. Lay lay aside
[51:38] everything. Just keep threatening
[51:39] through, brother. You got a sword in
[51:42] your hand. Just keep chopping."
[51:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "I went to a football stadium
[51:46] one time and was going to preach and I
[51:48] stopped at the door and looked up and
[51:50] and that said, it's not the size of the
[51:53] dog that's in the fight. It's the size
[51:55] of the fight that's in the dog." Amen.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; So that's what it means to win the
[52:00] battle.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, look, look at all the
[52:05] great churches that are against this." I
[52:08] don't care what size they are.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; It's the fight that's in the dog. That's
[52:14] what counts. It's the faith in the
[52:17] individual. If you're a coward, get back
[52:20] to your little cuddle hole. Right.
[52:22] Right.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; I like how the brother Brandham said,
[52:25] "If you're a coward, just get back to
[52:27] your little cuddle holes."
[52:35] &gt;&gt; If you're a soldier, stand out there and
[52:38] battle on.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Right and wrong is engaged. Let's fight.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; We're not a bunch of wimpy.
[52:51] This age may be full of wimpy.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; We're not that.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Like Peter Cartright went into the city
[53:00] and said, "Lord, the Lord told me to
[53:03] come here and have a revival." And he
[53:05] went to that old store room and got in
[53:07] there and began to clean it up. And big
[53:10] old bully of the town, the pistol
[53:12] hanging on his side, walked down, got
[53:14] doors. And some of them, what's the guy
[53:16] going to do down there? Well, he's a
[53:18] preacher. He's going to have a meeting.
[53:19] Said, "Well, guess I'll have to have to
[53:22] go down there and throw him out into the
[53:23] street and run him out of there. That's
[53:25] all. We don't want no meetings around
[53:27] our place." So, he goes down there and
[53:29] stomped the door and Peter Cartrite had
[53:31] his coat on, you know, and he was
[53:33] washing windows and walls and a little
[53:35] bitty fella, listen, you can listen to
[53:37] brother Brandham tells and you can tell
[53:38] he's enjoying telling this story.
[53:41] And the old preacher laughing at him,
[53:43] you know, for eating chicken with his
[53:45] hands, which is etiquette today, you
[53:47] know, and so he was washing windows and
[53:49] fixing around that big bully walked
[53:50] there and pulled his coat back, pistol
[53:52] hanging on his side and said, "What are
[53:54] you doing?" He said, "Uh, I'm washing
[53:57] windows and he just kept washing
[53:59] windows, you know, and he had one
[54:01] purpose. God told him to go hold a
[54:02] revival,
[54:04] &gt;&gt; washing windows down. We don't allow
[54:07] revival around here.
[54:11] He said, "Oh, but the Lord told me to."
[54:16] &gt;&gt; He told me to have a revival. He just
[54:19] kept right on at his work. He says,
[54:20] "Well, there's one thing that you'll
[54:21] have to understand. I run this town
[54:24] around here." Oh, you do? And he just
[54:27] kept washing windows.
[54:29] Before you have have a have a revival,
[54:32] you have to whip me first.
[54:36] Well, I'll just do that next.
[54:40] and he took off his coat and he walked
[54:43] over there and reached by the collar and
[54:45] knocked him down on the floor and jumped
[54:46] up on top of him and said, "I must fight
[54:49] if I should reign." Increase my courage,
[54:52] Lord.
[54:53] Pound the tar out of him.
[54:58] You got enough?
[55:00] Yay! He got up and shook his hand and he
[55:03] got saved that night.
[55:09] Peter Cartwright came from our part of
[55:11] the world.
[55:19] He was preaching in a meeting one night.
[55:21] It was a Wednesday night
[55:24] and in the meeting there was about 30
[55:26] men walked in and wanted to shut the
[55:28] meeting down.
[55:30] And he just walked down there and begin
[55:32] to try to usher them out. And one at a
[55:35] time he whipped every one of them.
[55:40] Church was disturbed. Preachers was all
[55:42] disturbed and and they they came back on
[55:46] Sunday and nobody felt the leading to
[55:48] preach after that kind of carousal
[55:51] happened.
[55:53] Peter Cartray said, "I will."
[55:56] And he stood up that morning and he
[55:58] preached a half an hour on the gates of
[56:00] hell shall not prevail.
[56:04] And the meeting went all day Sunday and
[56:06] all night Sunday night and all day
[56:08] Monday and all night Monday night and
[56:10] all day Tuesday and all night Tuesday
[56:12] night and on Wednesday they baptized
[56:14] about 300 people.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:25] Peter Cartwright was preaching and the
[56:27] civil war was going on and
[56:31] Ulysus Srant brought many of his
[56:33] soldiers to one of his meeting
[56:36] and the pastor the pastor was sitting
[56:39] behind Peter Cartright as he was
[56:41] preaching and I'm only in my
[56:42] preliminaries now just hang with me and
[56:45] he was preaching and the pastor pulled
[56:47] on his coattail and he told him he said
[56:50] the general is in the building and he
[56:52] said I don't care who the general is. If
[56:55] he don't know Jesus Christ, he's on his
[56:58] way to hell.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; The next morning,
[57:04] Grant came to his door and knocked on
[57:06] his door
[57:09] &gt;&gt; and he opened the door and he said, "You
[57:11] know, if I had men like you,
[57:16] &gt;&gt; I'd win this war
[57:18] &gt;&gt; so much quicker." That's hard for me to
[57:20] tell being from the South.
[57:26] We still fighting that war down there,
[57:28] you know.
[57:33] But let me just say, sometimes
[57:34] difficulty gets right in your face.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; You don't realize as a minister
[57:40] sometimes what's going on behind the
[57:42] scene and the the struggles that you're
[57:45] having just to walk to the pull pit.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; And you know within yourself you can't
[57:50] do anything.
[57:52] But we have an almighty God.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "There you are.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Take the word of God and cut your way
[58:04] through every doubt."
[58:08] &gt;&gt; If that's the next job, let's get it
[58:11] done.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; The next thing I I'm going to do is get
[58:16] away from my doubts. Cut it down. That's
[58:19] my next job is to get away from all my
[58:22] frustrations away. If my senses tell me,
[58:25] well, you feel bad, the next thing to do
[58:28] is cut that thing
[58:30] &gt;&gt; away.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; I'd like to share this with you. Some
[58:41] words that just speak to me.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; I've been sick before, but I made it.
[58:46] Yeah.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; I've been broke before, but I made it.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; I've been brokenhearted before, but I
[58:55] made it.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; I've been betrayed, but I made it.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; I've been lied on, but I made it.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; I've been destitute,
[59:07] &gt;&gt; but I made it.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; I've been rejected,
[59:12] &gt;&gt; but I made it.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[59:17] Hallelujah.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; I'd say Satan's starting to get a little
[59:22] nervous.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would quote this. Must
[59:26] I be carried home to heaven on a flowery
[59:30] bed of ease?
[59:32] While others fought to win the prize and
[59:34] sail through bloody seas.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; I must fight
[59:42] &gt;&gt; if I must reign.
[59:46] Increase my courage, Lord.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; My father-in-law was Brother Homer
[59:55] Frasier.
[59:59] He was a unique individual.
[1:00:02] Your pastor was a dear friend of him.
[1:00:06] He was rough cut.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; He wasn't cultured. He definitely wasn't
[1:00:12] polished.
[1:00:15] And he was a real man of God.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; He baptized thousands in the name of the
[1:00:19] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; He believed this message with everything
[1:00:24] that was within him.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; And he preached he preached like it was
[1:00:30] going to be his last service. No matter
[1:00:32] how how young he was or how even how old
[1:00:34] he was.
[1:00:36] My father-in-law,
[1:00:39] his last service was sitting in a
[1:00:41] wheelchair with one leg gone. And I had
[1:00:44] pushed him in a wheelchair, helped him
[1:00:47] up into the up into the church, and he
[1:00:49] would take pain pills and and uh I asked
[1:00:53] him, I said, "You feel good enough to
[1:00:54] preach?" And he said, "Absolutely."
[1:00:58] And we'd roll a desk in front of him and
[1:01:00] he'd sit there and he'd take the
[1:01:01] microphone and he would preach.
[1:01:04] He defied every excuse.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; He defied every whimper
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; of anybody that's ever had a whimper
[1:01:15] about not coming to church. He defied
[1:01:17] all of that.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; He broke every rule.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; I know we're not all built like that.
[1:01:24] But his last sermon was,
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; "Be you therefore ready, for in such an
[1:01:30] hour as you think not, the Son of Man
[1:01:33] cometh. Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; It wasn't some dainty little sermon. He
[1:01:37] preached about an hour and 20 minutes
[1:01:39] from that wheelchair.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; And he told him, "If if you don't if you
[1:01:45] don't get ready, you're going to get
[1:01:46] left behind."
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; This is a war and you got to fight in
[1:01:52] this war and it's a battle.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; And he quoted, "Brother Brandham said,
[1:01:57] you're going to have to fight for every
[1:01:58] inch of ground.
[1:02:06] One day we were sitting in the back
[1:02:09] and I looked at him and
[1:02:12] you know after so much pain and so much
[1:02:14] agony and so many things and operations
[1:02:18] that he'd went through,
[1:02:21] I looked over at him and I said, "Homer,
[1:02:23] I want to tell you
[1:02:26] it's right now that you're the most
[1:02:28] vicious
[1:02:30] Cuz
[1:02:33] a wounded dog is a is the most dangerous
[1:02:36] dog.
[1:02:39] And a warrior that's got his entire
[1:02:41] lifetime behind him. I'm preaching to
[1:02:44] you now. A warrior that's got his entire
[1:02:47] lifetime behind of a battles and
[1:02:49] victories and falling downs and getting
[1:02:52] up.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; And in spite of his humanity, he's still
[1:02:56] standing. Whether you know it or not,
[1:02:58] Satan Edis is more dangerous now.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; He's more dangerous now than he's ever
[1:03:09] been.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. G.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Be still and know that I'm God.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; I'm bigger than your problem.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; I'm bigger than your circumstance.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; I'm bigger than your situation.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; This is not your battle.
[1:03:45] You don't have to handle this,
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; This is God's battle.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; God will work it out.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is be still and know
[1:03:59] that I am God.
[1:04:09] The man said, "I I just want to talk for
[1:04:12] just a little while and just to build up
[1:04:14] a Christian faith."
[1:04:16] I found out that one of the greatest
[1:04:18] hindrances that the church has today is
[1:04:20] that they're scared to death.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; What are you scared about?
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm wondering.
[1:04:30] If you'll just only realize who you are,
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; right? That's right.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have to know who you are, but
[1:04:40] you you don't know. You you know who
[1:04:44] that is sitting beside of you. Oh, you
[1:04:46] say, "Yeah, that's my neighbor. I know.
[1:04:49] I know him." All right. But he's a son
[1:04:52] of God.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Adopted by Jesus Christ into the family.
[1:04:59] That's a daughter of God sitting next to
[1:05:01] you.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And who are you?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; If you're a Christian believer
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; and you're a son and daughter of God,
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; what are you scared about?
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; No need of being scared.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; As long as the devil can keep you
[1:05:21] scared, that's all he wants to do. He's
[1:05:24] got you right then.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Spiritual amnesia, not knowing who you
[1:05:28] are.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Praise. But knowing who you are produces
[1:05:32] faith and Jesus had perfect faith
[1:05:36] because he knew who he was in the word.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "As a son and
[1:05:43] daughter of God, you have more authority
[1:05:45] than the angels that are in heaven."
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; There's sometimes that we're visited by
[1:06:00] special angels to come to and even in
[1:06:03] certain meetings. People say, "I saw the
[1:06:06] angel of the Lord when we were in
[1:06:07] China."
[1:06:10] People said they saw the angel of the
[1:06:12] Lord in that meeting. I was just in I
[1:06:15] was just in brother Tim Puitz and there
[1:06:18] was a couple saw the angel of the Lord
[1:06:19] in that meeting. He's in every meeting.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; But whether you know this or not, you're
[1:06:26] more powerful than even that.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; I know you've heard this for decades,
[1:06:35] but sometimes you need to be reminded of
[1:06:37] it.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; You need to be reminded of it.
[1:06:45] In Switzerland, we go to and we can see
[1:06:48] the the great halls of where that the
[1:06:50] all the leaders of the world come
[1:06:52] together
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; and they discuss peace. And they call
[1:06:56] them incredible
[1:06:58] powerful people that sit there.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; But I say sitting in this building is
[1:07:02] more power
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; than it's what sits in your parliaments.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Satan.
[1:07:14] can't disturb your household until he
[1:07:17] first goes to God
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; because there's a hedge about you.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Psalms 91 tells you the angels are
[1:07:27] encamped about you.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; If you can only remember who you are.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:36] Amen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; The scripture says that perfect love
[1:07:43] cast out all fear.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said love and faith is the
[1:07:47] same thing. Love and perfect fa love
[1:07:50] cast out fear which gives faith.
[1:07:54] The scripture says in in Isaiah 54,
[1:07:57] which is one of my favorite scriptures,
[1:07:59] "No weapon weapon
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; that is formed against thee shall
[1:08:03] prosper,
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:08:07] thee in judgment,
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; thou shalt condemn."
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; If Satan really realized what he was
[1:08:16] doing, he would never tempt you. Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; He He would never touch you. He would
[1:08:25] never let one of his imps. He would
[1:08:26] never let one of those spirits come to
[1:08:28] attack you because you're doing roll
[1:08:31] call on them every time they come
[1:08:33] against you.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; You will bring condemnation to them.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:08:46] Philippians 1 and verse 6. Be being
[1:08:48] confident of this very thing that he
[1:08:51] which hath begun a good work
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; and God finishes all of his programs.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; He finishes the work. Amen.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't just call you
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; to just come and start and hang on,
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; but he called you
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; to finish the work.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:34] They asked brother Brandham
[1:09:36] said, "How do you feel, brother
[1:09:38] Brandham, when you stand there and see
[1:09:40] people coming in different languages and
[1:09:42] things? Are you afraid?"
[1:09:46] No, sir.
[1:09:47] No, sir.
[1:09:49] He said so,
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Never been afraid yet.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Cuz he told me so
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; and I believe it's the truth.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Now, notice these next words. If he told
[1:10:05] me
[1:10:07] to go to the presidential graveyard
[1:10:10] and raise up George Washington tomorrow
[1:10:13] morning,
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; I'd invite the whole world.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] I'd invite the whole world to come and
[1:10:28] see it done.
[1:10:30] And I'd say bring and get every critic
[1:10:33] that you can and stand them around.
[1:10:37] You're going to see the glory of God.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Set that chair over there where you can
[1:10:44] sit down and rest a little while. He'll
[1:10:47] be here in just a few moments.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; He said Jesus never cried when they
[1:10:59] brought that maniac
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; boy to him and had epilepsy fallen into
[1:11:04] the fire. He never said, "Father, I'm
[1:11:07] your son and now you sent me here to do
[1:11:10] so and so. Can I heal this boy?"
[1:11:14] He never said, He never said that. He
[1:11:16] said, "Come out of him, Satan."
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; He spoke and the boy was well.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; When he met Legion with 2,000 devils in
[1:11:29] him, it wasn't Jesus of crying. It was
[1:11:32] the devils that were crying.
[1:11:35] If you're going to cast us out, oh my
[1:11:38] suffer us
[1:11:40] to go into that herd of swine.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus never said, "Now, father, am I
[1:11:46] able to do this?" He said, "Come out of
[1:11:48] him." And the devils took their flight.
[1:11:52] Sure, he knowed he was the Messiah.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; At the grave of Lazarus, he had been
[1:11:59] there dead four days. And he said, "If
[1:12:02] thou would have been your Lord, he would
[1:12:04] have not have died." He said, "I am the
[1:12:08] resurrection and the life.
[1:12:11] Not where, when, or how. He that
[1:12:13] believeth on me, though he were dead,
[1:12:15] yet shall he live."
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; He know who he was. He knowed what he
[1:12:20] was.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; He know that he was Emmanuel.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; He know that in him dwelt the fullness
[1:12:28] of the godhead bladily. He seen them
[1:12:30] little people there. He had seen that
[1:12:32] what God had told him them to do. And
[1:12:36] there he was. And he went down there. He
[1:12:38] never said, "No, now wait. I'll kneel
[1:12:41] down here. All of you kneel down and
[1:12:42] pray and you believe." He said, "You
[1:12:45] believe that I am able to do this?"
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; And he asked for it.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; It wasn't him. It was them. Yay, Lord. I
[1:12:54] believe that you're the son of God that
[1:12:55] come into the world. Oh my. Darius
[1:12:58] identified something's got to happen.
[1:13:00] Lazarus
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; let me just say the resurrection's going
[1:13:08] to happen
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; and every blogger
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; preach it
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; and every web page and all of their
[1:13:16] critics
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; won't matter in no way.
[1:13:25] The critic that hounds in your ear,
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; pay no attention to it.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; He spoke and the blind saw.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; The lame walked.
[1:13:48] The deaf heard.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Devil screamed and come out. The dead
[1:13:54] was raised up in everything.
[1:13:57] Why? He didn't have to pray through. He
[1:13:59] was anointed the Messiah. He was that
[1:14:02] Messiah. He knew who he was.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; He knew his position.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; He know what he was sent to do. He noted
[1:14:14] what the father had identified him to be
[1:14:16] the Messiah, to be the believer. And
[1:14:19] when he met the believer with faith, he
[1:14:21] just spoke the word and devil scattered.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Speak. Don't cry. Speak.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; He knew his God-given rots.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; We don't. He knew what he was. We don't.
[1:14:38] Moses forgot. Samson. Others understood.
[1:14:42] Joshua understood. Moses forgot. God had
[1:14:45] called to his attention to it. He said,
[1:14:47] "Why are you calling out to me? I sent
[1:14:49] you to do the job. Speak and go to onto
[1:14:52] your objection. I told you to come to
[1:14:55] this mountain. Take them children and
[1:14:57] lead them on. Just speak. I don't care
[1:14:59] what's in your way. Move it out of the
[1:15:01] way. I give you authority to do it.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; You spoke fleas and flies and creation,
[1:15:09] all things like that. Now, what are you
[1:15:11] going to hollering to me about? Why are
[1:15:13] you coming to me hollering these things?
[1:15:15] Just speak.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Watch it move.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Everything that he said, he just
[1:15:27] spoke the word and it was so. God
[1:15:29] properly had a vindicated
[1:15:32] him to be his son. This is my beloved
[1:15:35] son in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye
[1:15:39] him.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Watch him. I like this. How bravely, how
[1:15:44] majestically he stood before his
[1:15:47] critics.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Destroy this temple and in three days
[1:15:52] I'll raise it up.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Not I hope.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; I will do it.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; The same scripture that said he would
[1:16:09] raise up his body. Give us authority.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, help me preach now. Give us
[1:16:16] authority. Gave us power
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Cast out
[1:16:21] devils. They'll speak with new tongues.
[1:16:24] They'll take up serpents.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; This is not some dainty little gospel.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; This is not some social gospel.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:38] People's come too late to tell me that
[1:16:40] this message don't work.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Too late.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; You're way too late.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; This message has got everything that you
[1:16:48] need for life's journey.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to Hallelujah. You don't have to
[1:16:54] go to Barnes & Noble or some bookstore,
[1:16:57] Amazon, somewhere. Get a book. How to be
[1:16:59] successful. Apply your life to this
[1:17:02] word. Eat this book. Eat the book. Let
[1:17:06] it live.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[1:17:29] Jesus said unto him
[1:17:31] in Luke chapter 9 and verse 62,
[1:17:35] "No man
[1:17:38] having put his hand to the plow
[1:17:41] and looking back
[1:17:43] is fit for the kingdom."
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Now, it may take a bit of courage for
[1:17:51] you to even gulp what I'm getting ready
[1:17:53] to say.
[1:17:56] But just stay with me a bit.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; People that walk away don't have nothing
[1:18:02] to say.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; And I don't care what their name is.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; I may be 5 foot five, but I know where
[1:18:21] I'm standing.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:25] People that walk away don't have nothing
[1:18:27] to say.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Something interesting about this
[1:18:34] message. You walk away
[1:18:37] because it has life. They fight it.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; It's got life.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; And this is the only place that life is
[1:18:47] at.
[1:18:57] The critic didn't stop Jesus.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; It didn't stop brother Brandham.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; It didn't stop your pastor.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Now I want to bring it up to date. It
[1:19:10] won't stop you.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the doctor tells you.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when we talk about character
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; of of of courage, when we talk about
[1:19:29] courage, we we think about a man named
[1:19:31] David.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; And he really wasn't concerned when he
[1:19:37] when he walked off of the hill about
[1:19:39] what they would do at his funeral.
[1:19:45] Saul was backsliden and he had all kind
[1:19:47] of armor and he should have been the one
[1:19:49] fighting.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; I want you to remember Goliath could
[1:19:56] have stood there for years
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; with that group of people
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; but where he got in trouble was he
[1:20:04] opened that mouth
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; when David showed up.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:16] And he no doubt that morning
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; people that looked at him and thought he
[1:20:22] was such a great champion and watched
[1:20:26] him as he ate his dozen eggs that
[1:20:28] morning and his bacon and admired his
[1:20:31] great big muscles and as he put on his
[1:20:33] his sleeves and his chest and his armor.
[1:20:37] And they admired what a phenomenal
[1:20:40] warrior he was. They didn't realize
[1:20:43] today
[1:20:45] was the last day
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; that he was going to eat those eggs
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; and eat that bacon and put on that
[1:20:53] armor.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; But today was going to be his last day
[1:21:01] of boasting.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Satan, I want you to listen to this
[1:21:05] sermon.
[1:21:09] If anybody tunes in, I want Satan to
[1:21:11] listen to this sermon. I want to tell
[1:21:13] you, you're coming to the end of your
[1:21:15] road
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; cuz David has showed up.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; What an awesome audience that you are.
[1:21:30] What an awesome ministry that you you've
[1:21:33] had.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; That's challenged you night after night
[1:21:36] and day after day. Keep pressing on.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; No days to take off. Keep pressing the
[1:21:42] battle.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; You knew that it was going to get
[1:21:45] darker. You knew that it was going to
[1:21:48] get more difficult. You knew this wasn't
[1:21:51] Hollywood. You knew that there was going
[1:21:53] to be challenges in your way. But
[1:21:56] something that was predestinated before
[1:21:58] the foundation of the world ignited in
[1:22:01] your heart.
[1:22:03] And it's not you holding on, but it's
[1:22:06] him holding on to you. You would have
[1:22:09] give up.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You would have quit. You would have
[1:22:13] walked away. But that seed gene of life
[1:22:17] that God put there before the foundation
[1:22:20] of the world,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; nothing can stop it.
[1:22:36] The scripture tells us that they cut
[1:22:37] their heads off. It didn't stop them.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; They burned them at the stake. It didn't
[1:22:42] stop them.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; They fed them the lines and it didn't
[1:22:46] stop them.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; They beat him until he was totally
[1:22:57] unrecognizable as a human being.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And he had the power to call 10,000
[1:23:02] angels.
[1:23:03] He could have nodded her or weak to one
[1:23:05] of the angels and they would have turned
[1:23:07] the world upside down. But because you
[1:23:10] and I would get sick,
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Because you and I would agonize in our
[1:23:18] mortality with sugar diabetes and and
[1:23:22] depression and and all different kind of
[1:23:24] difficulties in our humanity because of
[1:23:27] us.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; He surrendered himself.
[1:23:34] And every stripe was whipping devils.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:55] I find it interesting
[1:24:00] that people want to come up with all
[1:24:01] kind of nonsense about the little boy in
[1:24:03] Finland.
[1:24:07] But when brother Brandham said, "If this
[1:24:10] little boy is not off of the ground in
[1:24:12] five minutes,
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; you call me a false prophet."
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; And then he made the quotation,
[1:24:19] "You could line up every devil in hell."
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; You can line up every devil in hell.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't stop it.
[1:24:40] Brother Lou,
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; the devil's a real believer.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz he was there.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; He was there.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; He knows that was the truth.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; He knows that was a truth.
[1:25:03] He was there.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, he was in he was in
[1:25:06] every one of those prayer lines.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; And he knew that just before brother
[1:25:12] Brandham was the angel of the Lord, the
[1:25:15] presence and the pillar of fire was
[1:25:17] going all over the building.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; And he knew
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; with all of those patients coming before
[1:25:22] him
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; that that man didn't know them. He knew
[1:25:25] that.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; And of the hundreds of thousands of
[1:25:30] times
[1:25:33] I'm never wrong.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; And he told them things that that they
[1:25:38] had forgotten. And even laying on a on a
[1:25:42] hospital operating table
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; and I I see a tall slender doctor and a
[1:25:48] a little short fatter man
[1:25:51] and they've got your kidney in their
[1:25:53] hands.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; They didn't see that.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; They didn't see that.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; They did.
[1:26:03] This was more than a gift.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; It was more than a gift.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, the devil knew.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; When our prophet would tell him, "I defy
[1:26:18] you, Satan.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; You don't have the keys to your own
[1:26:22] house."
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; And Satan knew that. He knew that.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; You don't have no arrows for your own
[1:26:28] bow. And Satan knew that he didn't have
[1:26:31] arrows for his own bow when the prophet
[1:26:33] told him, "You have no legal authority."
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you just got to square your
[1:26:46] shoulders back and look toe to toe at
[1:26:48] the enemy and tell him, "I know who I
[1:26:50] am,
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; but I also know who you are." You're
[1:26:54] defeated in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:58] Hallelujah.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, do you believe that?
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; May be redundant, but I want to ask you
[1:27:15] again.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] Yes,
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; I want you to tell your neighbor, I
[1:27:27] believe that
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; with all my heart.
[1:27:39] We was in a meeting in June
[1:27:42] at brother Jason Jackson's
[1:27:46] and just before I walked out I preached
[1:27:49] that meeting with brother Tim Puit.
[1:27:52] Just before I walked out there was a
[1:27:54] someone told us said there's a man here
[1:27:56] that's got stage four cancer and he's
[1:27:59] going to die if he don't get a miracle.
[1:28:04] He's going to die if he don't get a
[1:28:05] miracle. He had he had his daughters
[1:28:07] with him and his wife.
[1:28:10] And I preached that evening
[1:28:13] and as I preached,
[1:28:17] you know, you know yourself that you
[1:28:19] can't do anything.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; You can't do nothing.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; But you got a word
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; and you're commissioned to lay hands on
[1:28:28] the sick and they shall recover.
[1:28:31] He had just told a man in brother
[1:28:33] Jason's church that week, maybe even
[1:28:36] that day, he said, "I've been to a lot
[1:28:38] of churches and none of them believe in
[1:28:40] divine healing."
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm looking for a church
[1:28:44] that believes it." He drove he drove
[1:28:46] hours to that meeting.
[1:28:49] And
[1:28:51] he sat and listened in that service. And
[1:28:54] as he sat there,
[1:28:56] as I stepped off of the stage that
[1:28:58] evening, Brother Frank McCcomus' wife,
[1:29:01] Sister Sheila, had suffered from
[1:29:03] sarcoidosis for years.
[1:29:06] We prayed for her and God healed her.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; One after another, let me let me just
[1:29:13] tell you, brother Jason told me it was
[1:29:14] near 100 miracles happened that night.
[1:29:25] Brother Ken, I I stepped in front of
[1:29:27] that man. I walked to his pew. I didn't
[1:29:29] know who he was. And I told I told
[1:29:30] Brother Jason, I said, "Take me to him."
[1:29:33] And I walked to his pew and we stepped
[1:29:34] out at the side of the pew and and he
[1:29:38] just told me, he said, "The doctors have
[1:29:39] given me up and I have no hope." And
[1:29:43] I'm just standing here. This is my last
[1:29:45] chance.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus met a lot of last chances. Yeah,
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; He met a lot of last chances.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; He met a lot of those characters.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; And I just asked him the question, "Do
[1:30:00] you believe?"
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; And we prayed for him.
[1:30:06] And literally,
[1:30:09] literally,
[1:30:11] he walked out of that building and he
[1:30:13] went to the doctor's appointment and
[1:30:15] they told him, said, "Something's wrong.
[1:30:19] You don't have one speck
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; of cancer.
[1:30:37] Brother Ed and I just spoke at brother
[1:30:39] Ray Ericson's only just a few years ago
[1:30:41] and together. I was there just a couple
[1:30:43] of months ago. There was a man there and
[1:30:46] he and they give him up to die with
[1:30:48] cancer. His name was Coli and he said
[1:30:51] and he and he's sitting over there to
[1:30:53] the left and he came up. He's first in
[1:30:56] the prayer line. And he said, "If I
[1:30:58] don't get healed, I could I could die in
[1:31:00] the next couple of weeks."
[1:31:04] He said when he got prayed for,
[1:31:08] he said it felt like a bolt of lightning
[1:31:10] hit him.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; He said he left the building with more
[1:31:16] energy than he had felt in years.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; He was standing in the parking lot in
[1:31:22] the rain the next morning.
[1:31:24] And he was standing there to meet
[1:31:25] brother Ray Ericson. He said, "It feels
[1:31:28] like that I ate have drank 150 cups of
[1:31:32] coffee this morning.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?"
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; As we go into this weekend, let's just
[1:31:47] look at the devil.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Let's just remind Saul
[1:31:54] We've seen the dead raised.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; We've seen them come out of wheelchairs.
[1:31:59] We've seen cancers fall off.
[1:32:04] This message has got transforming power
[1:32:06] to take the worst drug addict, the worst
[1:32:09] prostitute,
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; the worst religious devil in the world
[1:32:15] and in a moment change their life.
[1:32:19] To never go back,
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; to never have to go into rehab, to never
[1:32:24] go back into those sins.
[1:32:33] Are you with me now?
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; If
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; we're not careful, we're looking for
[1:32:42] some socialized gospel
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; that is of some mambby pami,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; some psychology
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; exactly
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; of how to how to overcome your devils.
[1:32:54] I'll tell you how to do it.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You don't have to counsel with
[1:32:57] a pastor for six weeks of got to
[1:33:00] overcome. Have an oldfashioned prayer
[1:33:02] meeting.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Have an old fashioned prayer meeting and
[1:33:09] you get right with God.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Take courage and go on your knees and
[1:33:15] pull yourself up on the altar and die
[1:33:18] out to those sins.
[1:33:24] But my pride of who I am, who cares who
[1:33:28] you are,
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; general or president? If you don't know
[1:33:32] Jesus Christ, you're dying and on your
[1:33:35] way to hell.
[1:33:58] I was on my way to your place,
[1:34:01] China,
[1:34:03] and I was heading on an airplane
[1:34:07] from Denver to here
[1:34:11] and a man that was a musician
[1:34:15] He's a great musician.
[1:34:20] He was sitting beside of me and he and
[1:34:23] his wife.
[1:34:26] They had just taken some cruises.
[1:34:30] Now they're on their way home.
[1:34:34] And he's sitting there.
[1:34:37] He said, "You know, I've done got past
[1:34:38] my prime." He said, "Nobody knows me
[1:34:40] now.
[1:34:43] And he said, "What do you do?"
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; I told him and he said, "I thought you
[1:34:53] were."
[1:35:00] We begin to talk about great singers,
[1:35:04] great musicians.
[1:35:07] He said you have to understand to be a
[1:35:09] great musician or a great singer
[1:35:13] in the world. He said you have to give
[1:35:15] yourself to the darkness.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; And he said
[1:35:22] the deeper you go into the darkness the
[1:35:24] more anointed from that realm you
[1:35:26] become.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; And he said that's why the Michael
[1:35:30] Jacksons and the and he just began to
[1:35:33] name off some names. I didn't know him,
[1:35:35] but he said they kill themselves with
[1:35:37] drugs. And
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; and he said cuz they can't live with
[1:35:40] themselves.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; He said they just can't live with
[1:35:44] themselves. He said because of the
[1:35:46] darkness gets so dark.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; He said it just gets to the place.
[1:35:53] And he kind of paused.
[1:35:56] He said, "But I would say you probably
[1:35:58] live in the opposite end of that
[1:35:59] spectrum.
[1:36:06] And he said, "The more you go into the
[1:36:08] light,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; the more anointed you become,
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; You're children of the light."
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; What a powerful people you are.
[1:36:32] What an awesome group that you are.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you don't know our trouble.
[1:36:41] Really?
[1:36:47] As the Lord was giving me the sermon, I
[1:36:49] thought of Ella.
[1:36:57] You know, to the naked eye,
[1:37:00] it looks like that in her life, she's
[1:37:02] been brought much trouble.
[1:37:07] You and I roll out of our beds in the
[1:37:09] morning and don't struggle to walk
[1:37:11] across the floor.
[1:37:15] But she rolls out of her bed with much
[1:37:17] struggle,
[1:37:26] but it has developed an atmosphere
[1:37:27] around her
[1:37:31] that many of you will never get to walk
[1:37:33] in.
[1:37:35] So, who's the real
[1:37:37] courageous one?
[1:37:44] Hallelujah.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Blind Fanny Crosby
[1:37:54] could have been one of the wealthiest
[1:37:56] women that ever lived as a songwriter.
[1:38:00] She had an incredible gift to be able to
[1:38:03] to write songs that would even change
[1:38:06] history. Amen.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Governments would actually attend some
[1:38:11] of those songs that and they would
[1:38:14] embellish them.
[1:38:17] But she refused to sing for gospel for
[1:38:20] the gospel to to to even civil war
[1:38:23] music.
[1:38:24] She refused to give her gift to the
[1:38:26] world.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; It took courage. Amen.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; It took courage
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; for that blind woman living in poverty.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; When they would say, "How will you know
[1:38:45] him?"
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; You've been blind all your life. How
[1:38:49] will you know him?
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll know him. I'll know him by the
[1:38:54] nail scars that are in his hands.
[1:38:57] Yeah.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; She sat in a prison listening to the
[1:39:02] minister speak that night and they were
[1:39:04] asking her for months to write a song
[1:39:07] about
[1:39:09] coming to an altar call.
[1:39:13] An inspiration struck her in a meeting
[1:39:18] and a man screamed,
[1:39:21] "Have mercy on me.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Savior, while you're passing by,
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't pass me by.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; She would write a song that many of us
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; would be sitting in pews.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; And ministers would challenge us to step
[1:39:45] from from the place where we're at.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; And more than just make a move for
[1:39:52] Christ,
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; but to die to ourselves.
[1:39:57] and to lay our pride down and say, "I
[1:40:00] got a problem."
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think, "Why should we have
[1:40:13] an altar call?
[1:40:15] Why should we have a prayer line? Why
[1:40:17] should we do that?" I think we need to
[1:40:19] get some courage about oursel.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; This is our gospel.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; This is our message.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; This is our word
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; and every benefit that's in it is ours.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said this and let me
[1:40:40] just go just Can you give me just a few
[1:40:42] more minutes?
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "God's purpose
[1:40:47] can never be defeated.
[1:40:57] God's purpose can never be defeated.
[1:41:04] You don't know it, but you had a great
[1:41:05] impact on my life.
[1:41:09] You had a great impact. We were standing
[1:41:12] many years ago
[1:41:15] at a convention, a meeting, and you
[1:41:18] stood beside of me and told me your
[1:41:20] testimony.
[1:41:22] of how you left
[1:41:24] that system and had to leave your wife
[1:41:27] behind
[1:41:31] and you never look back.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; It took courage. Amen.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; You see, I watch about every one of
[1:41:47] these services and I see you sitting
[1:41:49] here
[1:41:52] and I see you sitting there. Oh, Brother
[1:41:55] Ron, but we just walk in and sit down in
[1:41:56] their pew. Really?
[1:42:02] When you walk in and sit down
[1:42:05] and you take your position and you
[1:42:07] remind the devil of who you are,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; and you sit down and you tell the devil,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; you will not defeat me.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, nobody knows my name. It
[1:42:22] doesn't matter.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; I don't sing and I don't preach. You're
[1:42:27] here.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And if you could just
[1:42:32] recognize that every demon in hell has
[1:42:35] did his very best.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; To stop you.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And he has to go back and explain to his
[1:42:45] boss.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; I did everything
[1:42:59] to stop him.
[1:43:01] I did everything that I could to destroy
[1:43:04] his life, his home, his job, his health.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; I did everything to stop them.
[1:43:17] But Satan, what you don't realize is
[1:43:19] there's a seed.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; There's a seed that is inside of there.
[1:43:38] Brother Peter, I've never been to your
[1:43:40] church.
[1:43:41] Maybe someday I will.
[1:43:47] It doesn't matter if there's a thousand
[1:43:49] people sitting there.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; If there's 10 there,
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; the unseen the unseen benches are full.
[1:44:03] Are you with me?
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; And we're compassion about with so great
[1:44:08] a cloud of witnesses.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; And you may stand and preach the gospel
[1:44:14] and it feel like it just goes across the
[1:44:17] platform and literally falls off of the
[1:44:19] end. You walk out so dejected and so you
[1:44:23] probably never do this, but you walk out
[1:44:24] and go, I didn't go nowhere this
[1:44:26] morning.
[1:44:28] and don't realize that thousands of
[1:44:31] devils
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; have did their best to stop you from
[1:44:38] preaching
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; and you walk to the pull pit again and
[1:44:43] you took the word of God.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; God's purpose can never be defeated.
[1:45:03] Brother Ron, tell me something from the
[1:45:05] third pull. I just did.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; I just did. Give me something deep and
[1:45:11] give me something that'll shake my
[1:45:13] world. Tell your neighbor God's purpose
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; can never be defeated. Amen.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "God challenged
[1:45:28] me to speak to those squirrels. Speak to
[1:45:30] those squirrels." And I accepted his
[1:45:33] challenge.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; I want you to say this with authority.
[1:45:36] Now, God's purpose can never be
[1:45:39] defeated.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; God's purpose can never be defeated.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to work you up.
[1:45:51] I'm not trying to work you up.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "There's nothing that can
[1:46:03] defeat it."
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Ella,
[1:46:08] there's nothing can stop your miracle
[1:46:10] from happening.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Hallelujah.
[1:46:22] Brother Ron, but I'm in a hurry for it
[1:46:24] to happen. It'll be right on time.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; You don't have to make it happen.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; You just walk right into the promise of
[1:46:35] the word of God.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; You just keep taking steps.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; We are all the way. all the way.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; So, how so happy we ought to be today,
[1:46:54] resting upon the beautiful revelation of
[1:46:57] the word of the living God, that there
[1:46:59] is things neither present nor things
[1:47:01] that can come. There's no sickness,
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; no sorrow,
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; no death,
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; no perils,
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; nothing,
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; nothing,
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; you know, it's easy for somebody to
[1:47:30] preach something that's never lived it,
[1:47:32] Mhm. Right. Sir,
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; that's the reason a lot of people can't
[1:47:34] preach in the Holy Ghost. They don't
[1:47:36] know how it what it is.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz you can't preach something that you
[1:47:41] don't have.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; But I've been there.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Heart attacks, I've had them.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Strokes, I've had them.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe this will just help you.
[1:48:01] had a stroke and
[1:48:03] I I couldn't stand to see light.
[1:48:07] I'd laid in the hospital eight days
[1:48:11] and on the eighth day during the night I
[1:48:15] was there
[1:48:17] and he came in the room.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; A nurse walked in and
[1:48:26] she had not been attending me before.
[1:48:29] Brother Sam, she walked to the side of
[1:48:31] my bed
[1:48:33] and she's using a little flashlight, a
[1:48:35] little pin light. You know what that is,
[1:48:36] Michael? Little pin light.
[1:48:39] You know, you don't you don't rest in a
[1:48:41] hospital whether you know that or not,
[1:48:42] but
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:48:46] She's using a little pen light.
[1:48:50] She said, "Mr. Spencer, are you awake?"
[1:48:53] And I said, "Yes, ma'am."
[1:48:57] She said, 'I want to ask you a question.
[1:48:59] Was you praying?'
[1:49:02] I said, 'Yes, ma'am. She said, 'I've
[1:49:04] never been a Christian, but the others
[1:49:06] have told me about you. They're they're
[1:49:09] taking care of you. And she said, when I
[1:49:11] walked in this room, I felt something
[1:49:12] I've never felt before in my life.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; And she said, I need Jesus.
[1:49:28] And I said, "Let's pray."
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; And I prayed for her.
[1:49:34] Do you know that once I prayed for her,
[1:49:38] she give her heart to the Lord, all the
[1:49:41] symptoms I had left.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; You don't know what you've got to go
[1:49:52] through. Cuz God's got a purpose.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; I want to say this to you and forgive my
[1:50:02] irreverence, but Ella
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; you've testified to people
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; and showed them a power of God that you
[1:50:13] would have never
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Right. Never. Never. You'd have never
[1:50:18] got to testify to them of the power and
[1:50:21] the glory of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; We are.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Let me just bring this to to somewhat of
[1:50:37] a climax for a moment.
[1:50:40] Brother Brandon said, "And now we are
[1:50:41] more than conquerors.
[1:50:45] We just walk right into it
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; as an inheritance more than conquerors.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; We are def we are dealing with a
[1:50:58] defeated enemy.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Sickness is defeated.
[1:51:10] Death is defeated.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Hell is defeated.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Everything is defeated.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Brother B said, "I wish I was about
[1:51:21] twice my size. Maybe I'd feel twice as
[1:51:24] good."
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "We are we are disputing
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; with a defeated,
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; conquered,
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; enemy.
[1:51:41] Hallelujah.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; How many remember Dan Daisley?
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Dan Daisy is a great great friend of
[1:51:54] mine. Yeah. Had a lot of influence in my
[1:51:56] life.
[1:51:58] I respected him because how tall he was.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; And he was about as round as he was
[1:52:06] tall. Yes, he was.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; And he had coke bottle glasses,
[1:52:12] but he preached
[1:52:15] like he was 12t tall.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; I I want to as I come to an end, I want
[1:52:24] to share a story
[1:52:27] that he shared.
[1:52:29] He said, "One time there was a cat
[1:52:32] chasing a mouse.
[1:52:37] And this cat chased this mouse all over
[1:52:40] the house,
[1:52:43] all over the counters, all over the
[1:52:44] couch, all over the floor, everywhere.
[1:52:47] And finally, that mouse ran into the
[1:52:49] wine bottle.
[1:52:53] Gle
[1:52:54] bubbles coming up.
[1:53:00] And he finally got to swim. and he got
[1:53:02] himself up on the top of that wine
[1:53:04] bottle and he said, "Where's that cat at
[1:53:08] now?"
[1:53:23] So, I flew I flew on one air yesterday
[1:53:26] for six hours.
[1:53:30] Somewhere in God's great mind, he must
[1:53:31] think that preachers must need to sit on
[1:53:34] an airplane for certain amount of time
[1:53:36] and, you know,
[1:53:39] put a computer in front of him. And the
[1:53:42] final note that I wrote for tonight was,

[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; cuz most of your family to me.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; He's been giving you difficulty.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; He's been whispering in your ears and
[1:54:16] screaming and he's been sending you all
[1:54:18] kind of trouble
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; and and shaking everything that can
[1:54:22] shake.
[1:54:25] So let's choose a meeting.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; To fall in the wine bottle.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; That's stimulation.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; I've been I've been preaching for a
[1:54:46] while now.
[1:54:48] Let me just say the devil don't care how
[1:54:50] old you are, how much gray hair you
[1:54:52] have, what your situation is, he'll
[1:54:54] still fight.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; So, you got to keep going back to the
[1:54:58] source.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much God's blessed you.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; I don't care how how great that your
[1:55:07] name is. Let me just say this to you.
[1:55:09] Without God, we're just a breath of
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; air.
[1:55:18] Thank you for coming out on a Friday
[1:55:20] night.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you,
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; young people to the oldest person in
[1:55:25] this building,
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; take courage.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Courage is under attack in this hour.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely under attack.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; But let me just say this to you. Read
[1:55:42] the book.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:45] It tells you who you are
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; and it's not some work up emotion. You
[1:55:52] are the sons and daughters of God.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said if there's one
[1:56:00] person in the building that's looking
[1:56:01] for revival,
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; God will send that entire church a
[1:56:05] revival for that one person.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; He said speak to your mountain. slay the
[1:56:12] giants in your life.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; I want to say this to you. There's
[1:56:27] nothing impossible,
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; nothing
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; impossible.
[1:56:41] Nothing, Sister Tracy.
[1:56:44] Impossible.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Impossible.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Problems. I've had a few.
[1:56:58] I've had a lot of victories.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; I've been with you with a lot of
[1:57:04] victories.
[1:57:09] Sometimes you might disappear for a
[1:57:12] little while
[1:57:14] and you might feel like that
[1:57:17] you're the only one fighting
[1:57:20] and then all of a sudden one of your
[1:57:21] comrades comes up out of a hole and he's
[1:57:24] killed 800 people in that hole.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; That's scripture whether you knew that
[1:57:29] or not.
[1:57:32] So if you fall in a hole,
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; just go ahead and keep swinging the
[1:57:38] sword.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Can I finish with this?
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Shamgar was standing there and he got
[1:57:49] whipped after year after year after
[1:57:52] year. Yeah.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; But his great great great great great
[1:57:59] great great granddaddy was sitting
[1:58:03] outside of his tent and Melzdc came and
[1:58:07] he fed him meat and gave him milk.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; And Melzdc told him that thy seed shall
[1:58:13] possess the gates of their enemy.
[1:58:16] As long as Shamgar never recognized who
[1:58:19] he was,
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; he would get whipped over and over and
[1:58:22] over again.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; But one day he looked around at his
[1:58:25] family and his wife and how wore out
[1:58:28] that she was and his children, how
[1:58:29] ragged that he was, and he realized who
[1:58:32] he was.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; The scripture said that one shall take a
[1:58:40] thousand. And because the devil is
[1:58:43] stupid, he only sent 600.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; I did that for a reason.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; I know I'm unethical, but the stupid
[1:59:00] devil comes sometimes by the hundreds to
[1:59:02] your house. But you're given that you
[1:59:05] could kill a thousand
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; one day.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Thousand tomorrow, thousand the next
[1:59:11] day.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; How do you do it? One at a time.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; One at a time. You kill one, you give
[1:59:30] you faith and confidence to kill another
[1:59:32] one. And it gives you faith and
[1:59:33] confidence to get another one. Before
[1:59:35] long, 10 and 20 and 30 and 40 and 50 and
[1:59:38] 60.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; And then you come to church like a bee
[1:59:46] and a honey and you're dancing and
[1:59:48] you're shouting and you're praising the
[1:59:50] Lord and you're in victory. And
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; what happened to them? One at a time.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; One day at a time. One victory at a
[2:00:02] time.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; It's to him that overcometh.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; To him that overcometh. Not him that
[2:00:25] surviveth,
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; but to him that overcomes.
[2:00:31] Not the him that quits and runs and
[2:00:33] fails and goes back.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; It's a him that keeps standing.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; I want to say this to you. We shall
[2:00:46] overcome.
[2:00:58] This may be a strange way to end it this
[2:00:59] evening. I want you to go, that man is
[2:01:03] talking about me.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; He's talking about me.
[2:01:17] Can we bow our heads just a moment?
[2:01:28] We'll begin again Sunday morning.
[2:01:41] I'd like to just ask you as you be very
[2:01:43] honest now.
[2:01:49] You've come to this meeting with a
[2:01:50] certain expectation,
[2:01:54] not because of a man, but you've come
[2:01:56] because of God.
[2:01:59] And you'd like to just say, "Brother
[2:02:00] Ron, I want to lift my hand before the
[2:02:02] Lord. I need him like I've never needed
[2:02:06] him before.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; I am desperate before God. I need him.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; I need him.
[2:02:36] I personally need him.
[2:02:46] Hallelujah.
[2:02:49] Everyone that raised your hands, I'd
[2:02:50] like for you to stand just now.
[2:03:08] No matter what country you're in, no
[2:03:09] matter what your situation is,
[2:03:14] sitting alone,
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; dying of cancer,
[2:03:20] God's bigger than that cancer.
[2:03:26] I'm not going to live the next week if I
[2:03:28] don't get a help. God's bigger than that
[2:03:31] situation.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; He's bigger than that.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you don't know my
[2:03:39] relationships. Things have just
[2:03:41] destroyed my life. He's bigger than
[2:03:44] that.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, it's been so long since
[2:03:48] I've had a revival in my heart.
[2:03:50] Personally, I'm ashamed. And
[2:03:54] I'm ashamed. I'm sorry. I went so far. I
[2:03:56] I didn't think I could get back,
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Satan. You're a liar.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, you're a
[2:04:08] liar right now.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Right now.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; The greatest miracle that could happen
[2:04:18] in this building tonight is
[2:04:22] That filthy habit, you lay it down.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Say, I'll not let it be a
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; make me a slave to it no more.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; I'll lay off makeup. I'll lay off
[2:04:37] worldlyism. I'll lay off pornography.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; I'll lay off all of those things.
[2:04:45] I'll lay it off. It takes courage to do
[2:04:47] that. mouth.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Almighty God,
[2:05:06] I'm ever amazed at your great power,
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; your very sovereignty to take a service
[2:05:14] and do different things with it.
[2:05:16] Hallelujah.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've watched as you've dealt
[2:05:21] across this audience backward and
[2:05:23] forwards,
[2:05:25] moved on this one and that one.
[2:05:29] Begin to deal with lives.
[2:05:34] Lord, just now
[2:05:38] we could come to this altar.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; We could have a prayer line, but you're
[2:05:43] all over this building right now.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:51] Lord, you're the one that we're looking
[2:05:52] out to right now.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking to a man.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; We reach out to you.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Touch the hem of your garment.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, our name don't even need to be
[2:06:08] called,
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; but we know that we know that we know
[2:06:11] that you've walked by our pew this
[2:06:13] evening.
[2:06:16] Father,
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; help us tonight. Lord God,
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ, give us an
[2:06:25] uncction of courage, an inspiration of
[2:06:28] courage like never before to step from
[2:06:32] the shadows of our lives
[2:06:35] and to step from that darkness into the
[2:06:38] liberty of light.
[2:06:42] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Give me that water that I'll never
[2:06:45] thirst again. Father, change my life.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Sound the jubilee.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; sound the jubilee tonight. Father,
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; break every chain.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; I quote a prophet of God. He said,
[2:07:06] "Satan, take your hands off of God's
[2:07:08] property.
[2:07:11] In the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; may that same supernatural God.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Break every perversion.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Break every adulter spirit.
[2:07:40] Break every unbelief
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; If you have to pummel us,
[2:07:51] pummel us, father.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Fill our lives with the Holy Ghost.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Like never before, Father.
[2:08:09] Lord, we commit this year.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; We don't know what this year holds
[2:08:16] for many great troubles, for many great
[2:08:19] victories.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; But may this year be a year of
[2:08:23] dedication and commitment like never
[2:08:26] before. Father,
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; may this first weekend of the year.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Father, you're here.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; You're here tonight.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; And I don't say that by just a chance.
[2:08:44] You're in this building.
[2:08:53] Oh God,
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; touch our hearts now.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Soften us.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Soften us even now.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; No matter how long we've been soldiers
[2:09:08] in the kingdom of God,
[2:09:11] come by and saturate our lives.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Minister to us.
[2:09:19] Lord, don't pass Ron Spencer by.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; I too have need.
[2:09:28] I too believe.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; As I just read it just a bit ago, I've
[2:09:36] been sick before, but I made it.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; I've been destitute before, but I made
[2:09:42] it.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; But I couldn't have made it without you.
[2:09:48] I can't even walk
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; without you holding
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; my hand.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, saturate across this
[2:10:00] building now.
[2:10:04] Touch this audience.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Touch this people.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Bless them now, I pray.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Bless them now.
[2:10:16] Won't you just reach out to him where
[2:10:17] you're at now?
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Won't you just reach out to him and say,
[2:10:31] "Lord,
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; may I be the miracle this weekend?"
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; May I be the miracle.
[2:10:47] May I be the miracle.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; May I be the miracle.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; May I be the miracle?
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; What about a revival for your church,
[2:11:03] brother Peter?
[2:11:05] What about that revival? You've been
[2:11:07] praying for that.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; You've been praying for that.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus,
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; you've been you've been praying for your
[2:11:14] home.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Lou,
[2:11:22] he knows your very heart's desire.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; He knows your very heart's desire.
[2:11:29] Hallelujah.
[2:11:31] He knows how to open doors.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:35] He knows how to open doors
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; that seem so so locked and closed.
[2:11:43] He knows how to open those doors.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He knows how to penetrate
[2:11:48] walls.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; He knows how to go where no man can go.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, spirit of God, move in our lives
[2:12:01] now.
[2:12:03] He knows how to bring prodals home.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Surely do, Lord.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; He knows how to bring them home.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; He knows how to bring them home.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Won't you just raise that loved one
[2:12:25] before you right now?
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Won't you just raise it to the Lord?
[2:12:29] Hallelujah.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Bless your holy name.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; What seems absolutely impossible now?
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Why don't you by the authority of the
[2:12:46] commission of the word of God that
[2:12:47] you've been reminded tonight, Father,
[2:12:50] bring my brother home, bring my sister
[2:12:52] home, bring my mom and dad home, bring
[2:12:55] my son and daughter home.
[2:12:58] I don't care what it takes.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; I speak from courage tonight.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; I speak from courage. Why are we crying?
[2:13:14] Speak.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Why are we crying? Speak to it.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Speak to your mountain now.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Ella, speak to it.
[2:13:28] You can't hold me.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Go before you.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; I speak in the name of the Lord. He
[2:13:44] can't hold me.
[2:13:46] Satan, you can't take our life. In the
[2:13:49] name of Jesus Christ,
[2:13:52] I rebuke the devil and I claim victory
[2:13:56] with courage in my life.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:14:14] to
[2:14:22] glory.
[2:14:42] Sior
[2:15:01] and go
[2:15:15] to
[2:15:18] the blessing.
[2:15:24] Savior, Savior. One more time. Oh,
[2:15:28] saveior
[2:15:34] my savior.
[2:15:44] Humble
[2:15:47] cry.
[2:15:58] There's thou
[2:16:00] call
[2:16:02] calling
[2:16:06] to
[2:16:08] not back
[2:16:11] me
[2:16:12] up.
[2:16:17] Are you ready to fight one at a time?
[2:16:21] You say, "Well, brother Ron closed." He
[2:16:24] said this is the weekend of the first of
[2:16:26] the year. Why did we have speaker the
[2:16:30] first week of the year? Because we don't
[2:16:32] want to bring last year's problems into
[2:16:36] this year's situation. We need some sham
[2:16:40] guards in this church to tell the devil
[2:16:43] thus far and no further. We're taking
[2:16:47] you at your promise. We are going to
[2:16:50] defeat you by the word of God. We're
[2:16:52] going to take courage tonight. We're not
[2:16:54] going to wait for tomorrow. Tonight is
[2:16:57] your night. And you can say, "Tonight, I
[2:17:00] want to be delivered. Lord Jesus,
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; tonight's my night. I don't want to
[2:17:08] bring in what was my problem in December
[2:17:11] 2019 to 2020. I want every devil, every
[2:17:17] spirit that has afflicted you that you
[2:17:20] can take the word of God and be
[2:17:22] courageous tonight.
[2:17:25] Not because I said it, because you've
[2:17:26] already heard the word.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; And don't worry about your car. Your car
[2:17:31] will still be there. Jesus is here.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus is here.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "How easy is it, Brother Tom?"
[2:17:40] Well, I've had this quote laying in my
[2:17:42] on my in my notes for three services.
[2:17:46] Just this little quote. How do I receive
[2:17:48] it, Brother Tom? How do I receive what
[2:17:50] Brother Ron brought to me tonight? How
[2:17:52] do I receive it? He said, "There was a
[2:17:55] little old woman. She had broomsticks
[2:17:58] under her arm. She was trying to get to
[2:18:01] me, but some young people got ahead of
[2:18:05] her. They wanted to get to the prophet.
[2:18:08] They wanted to get to the word.
[2:18:11] He said, "Finally, here she come.
[2:18:15] Wrinkled face, hair
[2:18:19] down, leather platted. Finally got to
[2:18:22] me. Arthritis."
[2:18:25] She was standing like that. She looked
[2:18:28] up at me, gave me the broomsticks,
[2:18:31] and kept on walking.
[2:18:37] kept on walking.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; One devil at the time, she had
[2:18:41] arthritis, but she said, "If I could
[2:18:43] just get to the word, I'll give you my
[2:18:46] problems." And she walked out of there
[2:18:48] totally healed. She straightened up and
[2:18:51] walked out. That's what we want for you
[2:18:53] tonight. Straightened up. Walk out of
[2:18:56] the house of God saying, "Satan, you are
[2:18:58] defeated tonight in the name of the Lord
[2:19:01] Jesus Christ.
[2:19:04] Amen. From the balcony right down to the
[2:19:06] front here, right to standing behind his
[2:19:08] pulpit. You ain't going to get me what
[2:19:10] you did in 1920 and 19. This is 2020.
[2:19:15] And Satan, we have heard the word of
[2:19:17] courage tonight. How many of us have
[2:19:20] been encouraged
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; to take the word?
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Ryan, you wrote that song and we started
[2:19:30] this meeting.
[2:19:32] Let's just sing that as we get ready to
[2:19:34] go.
[2:19:39] There is a soul
[2:19:42] right now in time of need
[2:19:48] that brings me hope. Hope
[2:19:53] that brings me peace.
[2:19:58] And in every trial,
[2:20:02] through every test,
[2:20:07] my savior stands
[2:20:11] in my defense.
[2:20:16] So when the road you walk,
[2:20:24] you feel sometimes
[2:20:30] your heart is just remember
[2:20:38] is greater than
[2:20:43] take her Lord. Oh,
[2:20:47] the battle is the Lord.
[2:20:52] So when the water,
[2:20:57] he's what he did in his service. He gets
[2:21:01] me caught.
[2:21:05] Come on out.
[2:21:12] my hand
[2:21:15] less I should falter
[2:21:19] and miss
[2:21:22] what you stand tonight.
[2:21:28] So in the road you
[2:21:33] and you turn
[2:21:37] all your strength is gone.
[2:21:42] God Yes sir.
[2:21:46] My
[2:21:48] God
[2:21:50] is greater than the stor.
[2:21:55] Take her is Lord.
[2:21:59] The path one more time. So in the road
[2:22:02] you walk.
[2:22:04] So in the road you walk, we're going to
[2:22:06] walk out of this church and make you
[2:22:09] tire.
[2:22:15] We've had enough saints of God and your
[2:22:18] heart feels. You remember God in his
[2:22:22] service
[2:22:25] is greater than soul.
[2:22:31] Take her alone.
[2:22:35] Remember God.
[2:22:38] God
[2:22:43] is great.
[2:22:51] Hallelujah.
[2:22:57] I believe we can praise him tonight.
[2:23:00] Hallelujah to the lamb of God. Break
[2:23:03] every chain, Lord. every circumstance.
[2:23:07] We take courage. We'll take that ox
[2:23:10] goat. We'll take that jawbone. It
[2:23:13] doesn't matter. We've got the word in
[2:23:15] our hand.
[2:23:17] Take courage, people.
[2:23:20] Take courage, young people.
[2:23:22] The battle is the Lord's. I don't care
[2:23:25] what your affliction is. The battle is
[2:23:27] the Lord's. Has he delivered you? He
[2:23:30] delivered me from drugs, from booze,
[2:23:33] from lust, from the things of life. Is
[2:23:36] he the same God? Then tonight, he can
[2:23:39] break every chain, every fatter that is
[2:23:42] in this church. It doesn't matter where
[2:23:44] you are. My God can touch you, touch
[2:23:47] your heart, and deliver you. 2020,
[2:23:53] it's over. Why don't you just say, "It's
[2:23:55] over. It's over, Satan.
[2:23:59] I'm going to take courage tonight. It's
[2:24:01] over. This sickness is over.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; You came to my address. You spoke to my
[2:24:07] heart. You had the preacher say that to
[2:24:09] me.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, Holy Spirit,
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; rain down upon a people, Lord, like
[2:24:19] you've never before. We don't want just
[2:24:22] a church service. We want you to move
[2:24:25] amongst us from the front to the back to
[2:24:29] the individual heart to every young
[2:24:32] life. Lord, that we understand that this
[2:24:36] is not our battle, but this is your
[2:24:38] battle. Amen. This is not my battle.
[2:24:42] This is not Tom Ray's battle.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; He that beginth a good work,
[2:24:49] has he begun a good work in your heart?
[2:24:53] Jesus,
[2:24:55] as we go our way with our hearts charged
[2:24:58] with faith,
[2:25:00] I pray Lord that this victory would not
[2:25:02] be just for tonight, but Lord, we take
[2:25:05] courage and grip it with our hands of
[2:25:07] faith and walk out of that assembly of
[2:25:11] the living God, saying, "Devil, you are
[2:25:14] defeated.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; You're defeated. You're trying to take
[2:25:19] away my livelihood. And I deny you in
[2:25:23] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:25:26] Trying to take my victory out of the
[2:25:28] love of this word.
[2:25:30] Lord, supercharge every heart. Bless
[2:25:33] your servant. Strengthen him. God, we've
[2:25:37] come with great expectation and you have
[2:25:39] not let us down. Lord, you never have
[2:25:42] and never will. I pray for your servant
[2:25:45] that supernatural
[2:25:47] strength Lord will be poured upon him
[2:25:51] that you will give him grace and
[2:25:53] leadership in the word of God for
[2:25:55] Saturday or for Sunday morning and
[2:25:58] Sunday night.
[2:26:00] Go with us now with the blessing of God.
[2:26:03] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we just sing that one song?
[2:26:09] Just set our wings on on the wings of
[2:26:13] faith.
[2:26:17] There there are two roads.
[2:26:21] You may
[2:26:24] here it is one by
[2:26:30] and one by
[2:26:34] just take the word of God
[2:26:39] over what you see.
[2:26:43] What you believe
[2:26:48] is what you
[2:26:52] Heat. Heat.
[2:27:06] I
[2:27:11] do not
[2:27:16] my
[2:27:25] wings of faith.
[2:27:27] So watch your knee. Watch your knee.
[2:27:34] your
[2:27:39] mountain.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Give me my mountain.
[2:27:46] Just speak the word of God.
[2:27:51] And I am
[2:27:55] just
[2:28:09] Heat. Heat.
[2:28:19] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:28:32] your
[2:28:40] sole
[2:28:45] in the sky.
[2:28:49] He does not.
[2:28:53] He does not.
[2:28:58] Oh,
[2:29:02] heat, heat.
[2:29:12] Yeah.
[2:29:14] Heat.
[2:29:32] Just
[2:29:37] my
[2:29:45] wings of
[2:29:49] Hallelujah.
[2:29:52] What a wonderful service. What a
[2:29:54] wonderful presence of God. It's good to
[2:29:57] be in the house of the Lord. I can see
[2:30:00] what David says. I was happy when they
[2:30:02] said unto me, let us go to the house of
[2:30:06] the Lord. God bless you. Come praying.
[2:30:09] Come expecting for Sunday morning. If
[2:30:12] this is how it starts, look out how
[2:30:14] we're going to finish. If this is the
[2:30:16] start of 2020, look out, Satan. I'm
[2:30:19] starting to roll up my sleeves.
[2:30:22] Where's that cat?
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Where's that cat? Listen, I've
[2:30:28] been so stimulated and revelated by this
[2:30:30] word.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; It's becoming more real and more alive
[2:30:34] than it ever has before. You can have
[2:30:36] your form.
[2:30:38] And I'm telling for preachers all the
[2:30:40] way to the back of this church, you can
[2:30:42] have your form.
[2:30:44] You can have your rig religiosities.
[2:30:47] But I want God to move in a supernatural
[2:30:50] way.
[2:30:52] We want service after service. The Holy
[2:30:55] Spirit moving, changing lives. I don't
[2:30:58] care if you got a prostrate trouble. I
[2:31:00] don't care if you got cancer. I don't
[2:31:02] care. Brother Hugh is sitting in a in in
[2:31:04] wherever he is. And brother Hugh, if
[2:31:06] you're listening to this, listen, Oral
[2:31:08] Roberts, what he used to do. He said,
[2:31:09] "Touch that television." Didn't he
[2:31:11] Ernie? Touch the television. Just touch
[2:31:13] that faith. Touch the television and
[2:31:15] you're going to be healed. I believe we
[2:31:17] can. We got more than the television. We
[2:31:19] got a television prophet. We got a word
[2:31:22] for a people. By his stripes, we are
[2:31:26] healed. Brother Hugh, you heard about
[2:31:28] fourth stage cancer and a man get
[2:31:30] healed. He's the same yesterday, today,
[2:31:33] and forever.
[2:31:36] We got a fallen soldier. I think every
[2:31:38] one of us should stand behind what we
[2:31:40] heard tonight and say, "We come against
[2:31:42] you, Satan." If one can send a thousand,
[2:31:45] two, 10,000, look at the assembly
[2:31:48] tonight. Are we believers?
[2:31:51] Are we believers? Then we believe for
[2:31:54] our brother Hugh. We stand with our
[2:31:56] brother Hugh.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; I I I don't believe that brother Rhonda
[2:32:03] even knows that what brother where
[2:32:04] brother Hugh is at this time, but he
[2:32:07] could talk about a brother that comes to
[2:32:08] church with a fourstage cancer, could
[2:32:11] die any week. We got a brother in this
[2:32:13] church under that same circumstance. So
[2:32:15] the word that met that brother is the
[2:32:19] same word that can heal that brother.
[2:32:23] That's how I believe. Saints and you say
[2:32:26] you got the doubt. Well, how do you
[2:32:27] know, brother Tom? I'd rather die
[2:32:29] believing.
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; Is that right, Brother Mike? You write a
[2:32:33] song, I'll die believing. Well, that's
[2:32:35] the kind of faith I want. I want to have
[2:32:36] faith.
[2:32:39] Amen.
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; It's time to roll up our sleeves, young
[2:32:44] men.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; It's the kind of message we need to hear
[2:32:48] to start into a new year.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham cried out, he says,
[2:32:53] "Where are those warriors that will
[2:32:54] stand by me?" That's one of my favorite
[2:32:56] quotes. And when he said that, first
[2:32:58] time I heard that, I jumped out of my
[2:33:00] seat and I said, "I'm one of those
[2:33:01] warriors, prophet." And if you want to
[2:33:04] be a warrior of the word of God in this
[2:33:06] year, let's take courage.
[2:33:09] Let's take courage. Let's take what we
[2:33:11] had tonight. Build on it. See what God's
[2:33:13] going to do for you Sunday. God bless
[2:33:16] you. God be with you. We'll see you
[2:33:19] Sunday morning. You're dismissed in
[2:33:20] Jesus name. Sorry for preaching like
[2:33:23] that. You already had preaching.
[2:35:37] Heat. Heat.
[2:35:47] Heat. Heat.
[2:35:57] Heat. Heat.
[2:36:18] Heat. Heat.
[2:37:00] Hallelujah.
[2:38:13] Heat. Heat.
[2:39:39] Heat. Heat.
[2:40:00] Thank you.
[2:40:11] Jesus Christ.
[2:40:15] Amen.
[2:40:31] Amen.
[2:41:57] Halleluat.
[2:43:11] Heat. Heat.
