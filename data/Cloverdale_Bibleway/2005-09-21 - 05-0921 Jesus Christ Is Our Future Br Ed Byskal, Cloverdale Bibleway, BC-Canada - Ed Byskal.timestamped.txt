[19:26] Chris, if you'd come and open the
[19:29] service in a word of prayer.
[19:33] Brother Peter has a testimony here. He
[19:35] just wants to thank the Lord for healing
[19:37] his knee. It has s hurt since camp and
[19:40] now is feeling perfect. He has here also
[19:43] my car was stolen our driveway on
[19:46] Tuesday and the police have recovered
[19:47] it. Please pray that the tools that uh
[19:50] are still in the car when when he gets a
[19:52] hold of it. So we want to remember that.
[19:55] Also, brother Ken Buckles has a
[19:57] testimony here. He just says, "I would
[20:00] like to thank everyone for their prayers
[20:02] for Carissa Buckles and baby." Uh
[20:05] yesterday after eight plus hours of
[20:06] labor in the hospital, the doctor
[20:09] elected to do emergency cescareian
[20:11] section. Uh because of the baby was
[20:14] distressed. There was much prayer.
[20:16] Chrisa felt something change and knew
[20:18] the Lord had answered her prayer for
[20:20] normal delivery. She asked the nurse to
[20:22] check one more time. The nurse did and
[20:24] rushed out and got the doctor and he
[20:25] delivered a healthy baby girl. 9 lb 14
[20:29] oz.
[20:32] Praise God.
[20:38] Baby's name is Lila Da. Did I get that
[20:41] right? Okay. And it says here, uh,
[20:44] mother, baby, and father are doing fine.

[21:32] Carmela. Her husband was taken to the
[21:34] hospital this evening. So we want to
[21:36] remember
[21:38] remember her husband also. We want to
[21:40] remember this is from sister Shauna says
[21:43] please pray for Stephanie Price and her
[21:46] family. She is a 39year-old mother of
[21:49] six who was extremely sick with liver
[21:51] and pancre pancreas cancer uh which is
[21:54] extremely painful. Apparently she's
[21:56] she's on the same floor as sister
[21:58] Marjorie Miller and that they told the
[22:00] family that they'd be praying their
[22:02] sweet Christian family and apparently
[22:04] they know brother Frank Fletcher's wife
[22:06] and they have written here I just don't
[22:08] believe this is by chance that she's on
[22:10] the same floor. So may God move on their
[22:12] behalf and reveal himself to them in a
[22:14] greater way. So, we want to remember
[22:17] this lady Stephanie. Brother Chris, why
[22:19] don't you come?

[24:57] the gates of the devil. Father, we thank
[24:59] you right now for the faith and the word
[25:02] that you've given us to go forth and
[25:04] seize the time. Father, we thank you

[33:32] Moses told the children of Israel, "The
[33:36] Lord shall raise up a prophet like unto
[33:40] me and him shall you."
[33:46] Truly Jesus came fulfilling all that
[33:51] Moses said, then died and rose and give
[33:55] us salvation
[33:56] to declare.
[34:00] We have a message to the world. We have
[34:04] a message to save lost souls. We have a
[34:08] message to those sick and dying.
[34:14] We've got to tell them Jesus saves. You
[34:17] go and tell them Jesus heal. We got a
[34:22] message that makes our lives worth
[34:24] living.
[34:28] Well, surely the Lord God will do
[34:31] nothing, but he reveals his secrets to
[34:34] the prophet like the one he has sent in
[34:39] our day.
[34:41] [Music]
[34:42] He fulfilled Revelation 10 and 7,
[34:46] Malachi 45 and 6. We now have the seven

[35:24] Now surely the Lord God will do nothing
[35:28] but he reveals his secrets to the
[35:31] prophets like the one he has sent in our
[35:35] day.

[37:32] This is what has made our lives worth
[37:36] living.
[37:40] This is what has made our lives worth
[37:43] living.
[37:47] [Applause]
[37:56] Amen. We're going to turn to the word at
[37:58] this time. Brother Ed's going to come.

[43:19] gladness.
[43:21] I'll serve
[43:23] the lamb
[43:25] that was slain.
[43:28] [Music]
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Let's bow just before we turn to the
[43:32] word.
[43:34] Father, we're here to serve you. We want
[43:37] to serve you in spirit and in truth. We
[43:40] have been worshiping, Lord, in spirit
[43:42] and in truth. Now we come to your word
[43:46] which is truth. It's all true. And we
[43:50] ask that its truths will sink down into
[43:53] the v inner recesses of our souls. Take
[43:57] charge of every mind and thought. Lord,
[44:00] may the thoughts of today have passed
[44:03] away. Lord, may any concerns about
[44:05] tomorrow be forgotten. And may we now
[44:08] come into your presence and say, "Only
[44:11] you, Lord. Only you. You're the fountain
[44:14] that I run to.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; We thank you with joy in our hearts that
[44:19] we're able to be here in your divine
[44:21] presence. Now take each one of us, Lord,
[44:24] myself. I pray you'll anoint me, oh God.
[44:27] Let the people be anointed to hear, to
[44:30] receive, and be benefited. Let the seed
[44:33] now fall into good ground in Jesus
[44:36] Christ's name. Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:40] Well, here we are this evening, a
[44:42] Wednesday evening.
[44:44] At least we're not
[44:47] amongst the numbers of uh I understand
[44:50] over one and a quarter million fleeing
[44:53] another hurricane
[44:56] that is swept in over the Gulf and uh
[45:00] they say it's a a storm five now and uh
[45:05] just hundreds of thousands of people
[45:08] fleeing. For some, it's the fourth time
[45:10] this year.
[45:12] You heard me about two Sundays ago, and
[45:15] I I draw a parallel between this and
[45:19] what was happening in Israel.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; And my wife and I were talking and she
[45:24] observed and I thought it was very very
[45:25] perceptive.
[45:27] But this what she had received from it.
[45:31] How that the pressure the pressure from
[45:36] this western countries and not only
[45:39] United States but from all the western
[45:40] countries
[45:42] uh but but I I would say that United
[45:44] States laid the led the charge
[45:48] to displace
[45:51] people in Israel
[45:52] &gt;&gt; and to mow their buildings down. And now
[45:56] that's exactly what's happening within
[45:58] our own coasts.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; It's being displaced by hundreds of
[46:03] thousands more than we're displaced. You
[46:05] don't touch Israel, friends. You don't
[46:07] touch Israel without being affected. And
[46:10] and the two things the two things that
[46:14] she I would say engineered was the
[46:17] removal of the people and the
[46:19] destruction of their homes. And that's
[46:21] exactly what came back. It's coming back
[46:24] even now. and may come back for it's a
[46:27] sign of the time.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; It's a sign of the time. And when God
[46:31] starts to do something, if he begins to
[46:33] use the elements, I tell you, it's a
[46:35] fearful thing to fall into the hands of
[46:37] a living God.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; And you can't we we just can't say that
[46:41] the things that are happening in the
[46:43] nations, in the world is just happening.
[46:45] It's not just circumstance. God is
[46:48] ordering all of these things that is
[46:51] taking place. And so, of course, we're
[46:53] we're sad for the people that are, but
[46:56] it I tell you, a lot of innocent people
[46:59] get caught in the in the deeds of of men
[47:03] who go against the word of God. And so,
[47:05] we're here tonight and you you want to
[47:07] be very thankful. You're here tonight to
[47:10] catch whatever the Holy Spirit will have
[47:12] for you.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, turn to
[47:16] James, please.
[47:19] uh
[47:21] the fourth chapter of James which James
[47:24] comes right after Hebrews.
[47:29] And tonight I don't know how much we'll
[47:31] preach, maybe more just study.
[47:35] We'll just see how the Lord will take
[47:37] it. Nice to have you here again, Brother
[47:40] Ernie. We've been having meetings and
[47:42] brother Ernie's been down with Brother
[47:44] Samuel Dale and a number of other
[47:46] pastors down there.
[47:49] uh
[47:50] holding up this banner.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; The fourth chapter of James, we're just
[47:57] going to start to read at the at the
[47:59] 13th verse.
[48:03] And we'll read down to verse 17, the end
[48:06] of the chapter. go to now or we would
[48:09] say come now. You that say today or
[48:13] tomorrow we will go into such a city and
[48:16] continue there a year and buy and sell
[48:20] and get gain. Whereas you know not what
[48:24] shall be on the tomorrow. For what is
[48:27] your life? It is even a vapor that
[48:30] appearth for a little time and then
[48:32] vanishth away.
[48:34] For that you ought to say, "If the Lord
[48:37] will, we shall live and do this or
[48:41] that." But now ye rejoice in your
[48:43] boastings, all such rejoicing is evil.
[48:47] Therefore, to him that knoweth to do
[48:50] good, and doeth it not, to him it is
[48:53] sin. And I want you to especially notice
[48:56] the first two verses and especially 14.
[48:59] Whereas you know not what shall be on
[49:02] the tomorrow. For what is your life? It
[49:04] is even as a vapor that appearth for a
[49:06] little time and then vanishth away. You
[49:08] may be seated and keep your Bibles handy
[49:12] if you would please because I have a
[49:14] number of other scriptures we want to be
[49:16] looking at. I want to speak on your
[49:18] future
[49:20] and because it's a very we have a very
[49:23] youthful church.
[49:25] Very youthful church. I go to some
[49:26] churches and all we see is uh
[49:29] gray-haired and white-haired and
[49:31] bald-headed people and all across the
[49:34] whole congregation. We come here and and
[49:36] the gray-haired and uh bald-headed and
[49:39] uh uh and the white-haired and all the
[49:42] rest of it can't even get a seat
[49:44] &gt;&gt; down close to the front. And I've
[49:46] noticed that quite a few have gotten
[49:48] displaced. And so we have uh naturally
[49:51] the younger a person is the more future
[49:54] they feel that they have and the more
[49:56] interest they have in the future and the
[49:59] more long range plans that they have.
[50:03] But I I like to title the message
[50:05] tonight that Jesus Christ is our future.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; I want to say very very quickly and I'll
[50:12] be making some statements that you can
[50:14] write down and keep. There are things
[50:17] coming up in your future that you did
[50:20] not expect
[50:22] for sure. There are things coming up in
[50:26] your future that are going to uh this is
[50:29] for all of us but especially our young
[50:32] people. There are things coming up in
[50:33] our future that not only did we not
[50:36] expect but we're not prepared for in our
[50:39] in our own mind in our own strength.
[50:42] We're not prepared for it. And that is
[50:45] why uh things come up in people's
[50:47] future. I'm talking about believers
[50:49] future that sets them on their head,
[50:52] turns them right upside down. And they
[50:54] said, "I never expected this." There are
[50:58] things which come up in people's future
[51:01] that only not only did they not expect
[51:03] and not only were they illprepared for
[51:06] but it simply and and not only does it
[51:08] turn them upside down but there are
[51:10] things that come up in people's future
[51:12] that turns them away from the path of
[51:14] life and that is the most tragic thing
[51:17] and I would hate to think I would just
[51:20] really dislike thinking I should put it
[51:22] that way that we would have within a
[51:25] congregation like this that we would
[51:27] have uh the prospects of such a thing
[51:30] happening. But it does happen. It
[51:32] happens to be the real world. And there
[51:34] are things that come up and people they
[51:37] you can say throw in the towel or they
[51:40] just turn their back on God or they just
[51:42] become completely despondent or I don't
[51:45] know for what all the reasons are, but
[51:47] there's a whole multitude of reasons.
[51:49] And they do because we've been here a
[51:51] long time and we've seen people and I've
[51:53] seen people turn out of the path of life
[51:55] for the most nonsensical thing.
[52:00] You have too.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; You said where's so and so? Where's so
[52:04] and so? Well, well, what did they go
[52:06] for? Well, I don't know what they went
[52:07] for, but they some of them went for
[52:09] pleasure. Some of them went for jobs.
[52:11] Some of them went for an education. Some
[52:12] of them went for this. Some went for
[52:14] money. Some went for had all kinds of
[52:16] things. And some probably don't even
[52:17] know what they went for. Some said,
[52:19] "Well, I prayed and God didn't answer."
[52:21] Uh or or you know, or or God did this or
[52:25] God did that or they blamed the
[52:26] preacher, blame the church or blame
[52:28] somebody. And you know, that's just
[52:30] exactly the way it happens.
[52:33] And you want to in fact is uh when the
[52:36] little fellas were up here singing, I've
[52:39] got my heart set right. I've got my I've
[52:41] got my mind I've got my mind made up.
[52:44] I've got my heart set right. Right at
[52:46] that moment while they were singing that
[52:49] I had on the computer resolved
[52:53] resolved
[52:54] and being determined and the Bible is
[52:57] full of it and there's one person who is
[53:00] many that were resolved all of them were
[53:02] resolved in the Bible but like Apostle
[53:04] Paul said even when he knew he was going
[53:07] to Jerusalem and he knew what because it
[53:10] had already been prophesied he knew what
[53:12] was facing him. It had been prophesied
[53:15] what was facing him. He knew there was
[53:17] bonds coming. And a man has been beaten
[53:20] by rods and beaten by stripes and been
[53:24] shipwrecked on the ocean and had been in
[53:26] hunger, had been in nakedness, had
[53:29] suffered all of these things. He knew it
[53:31] wasn't going to be blissful. He knew it
[53:34] was trouble that was coming. But he
[53:36] said, "None of these things move me.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; None of these things move me." So God
[53:42] had alerted him and informed him what
[53:44] his future was, but he said, "I have he
[53:47] wasn't concerned about the future
[53:49] because he wasn't looking for easy
[53:51] street."
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; He was just looking for the perfect will
[53:55] of God. And so we're not here tonight to
[53:58] look up for easy street or to look up
[54:00] something, you know, that is, well, if
[54:02] God blesses me, that's not the point.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; The point is that we're resolved
[54:07] whatever God decides to do. Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; So future in the encyclopedia says it is
[54:17] the future is the time yet to come.
[54:20] You might wonder why I look up some of
[54:22] these things because there there there
[54:25] is depths in its meaning that we escape
[54:28] us and are just our normal English
[54:30] language.
[54:31] Our future is the time yet to come. But
[54:34] specifically,
[54:35] specifically, the encyclopedia says it's
[54:38] the state of the soul after death. And I
[54:41] really was thankful they had those two
[54:44] statements. But in the second statement,
[54:46] they came right to the point.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Number one, it is the time yet to come.
[54:52] It's tomorrow. It's five minutes from
[54:53] now. It's next week. It's next month.
[54:56] It's next year. But specifically, it's
[54:59] what happens after death.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; That's specifically,
[55:02] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; That's your future.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; And we do have an appointment. And the
[55:08] appointment is it is appointed
[55:12] &gt;&gt; on a man
[55:13] &gt;&gt; once to die
[55:15] &gt;&gt; and after that the judgment. Well, if we
[55:18] don't die, we go in the rapture. We're
[55:21] looking for the rapture. If you're not
[55:23] raptured, one thing is certain. We're
[55:25] going to go by either by rapture or by
[55:27] way of the death. And of course, and
[55:30] then after this, the judgment. Well, we
[55:33] know that Christ was judged for us. But
[55:36] we don't want to be elusive about that
[55:38] subject because uh some say, well, how
[55:41] the message teaches Christ was judged
[55:44] for us that he was. You won't pay for
[55:46] your sins. He paid it all. There's not a
[55:48] thing that is there. But we will be
[55:50] judged for how we how we conducted
[55:52] ourselves and what we did with what God
[55:54] gave us as servants of Christ, as
[55:57] disciples of Christ. And we want to uh
[56:00] we want to be diligent about those
[56:02] things. We want to be diligent about the
[56:04] decisions that we have made. And uh I
[56:07] I'm moving forward with the young people
[56:09] as well in the service. But it applies
[56:11] to all of us. We want to be diligent
[56:13] with what God has given to us. Don't you
[56:15] not agree with that?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Everyone,
[56:21] I believe, is keenly interested in their
[56:23] in their future.
[56:25] And the question is, what does my future
[56:28] hold for me?
[56:31] Some people I find every newspaper, some
[56:33] people religiously read the
[56:39] horoscope.
[56:41] You see how I've worded that? The horror
[56:44] scope.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; I had to even think about it to try and
[56:49] say it right. I've been saying horoscope
[56:50] for so long that I had trouble trying to
[56:53] say it correct according to the
[56:55] according to the newspaper
[56:58] and um and for many it turns out to be a
[57:00] horoscope. All right.
[57:04] The horoscope is the aspect of the
[57:06] heavens with special reference to the
[57:10] positions of the planets at any instant
[57:13] from which astrologers profess to
[57:15] foretell the future especially of a
[57:19] person born at that time. Now, you
[57:22] remember brother Brandham got on a bus
[57:25] &gt;&gt; and he's standing right beside a sailor
[57:29] and he just kind of felt you you felt
[57:33] the same sometime. You just kind of felt
[57:34] strange and and you don't maybe know
[57:37] why. Maybe you never do find out why.
[57:40] Maybe someone's presence that you're in
[57:42] or maybe a situation that you're facing.
[57:45] But he was on this bus standing there
[57:48] and uh I believe he was a game warden at
[57:51] the time uh young man and this woman
[57:56] heavy set large woman looking right
[57:59] straight hard at him said I'd like to
[58:01] speak to you said do you know that
[58:03] you're a gifted person he said I I don't
[58:05] want none of that I he didn't want to
[58:07] hear any of that and this woman then
[58:10] told him you've been born under a sign
[58:12] and there's a when three planets three
[58:14] planets planets came into line when
[58:17] Jesus was born. And every time those
[58:20] planets line up, then God in in in
[58:23] remembrance of that sends a special gift
[58:25] to the earth. And you were born under
[58:27] those same three planets. He didn't want
[58:29] to have anything to do with it. He
[58:30] didn't want to hear. He said, "Tell she
[58:33] I'll tell you I'll tell you the day that
[58:36] you were born." And she gave him the
[58:39] date and the hour he was born by because
[58:43] she was a student of the planets. And uh
[58:46] he says tell the sailor when he was
[58:48] born. She said I can't. Now you know he
[58:52] didn't want to hear anything about that.
[58:53] And we don't believe in astrology and we
[58:56] don't believe in horoscopes and we don't
[58:57] believe in all that stuff. Nevertheless,
[58:59] we do believe we were born at a certain
[59:01] season when God had the planets. He had
[59:04] the stars. He had everything right in
[59:06] place. And it's amazing. We may think we
[59:09] may never know of it in this world, in
[59:11] this life. I don't expect that we will.
[59:13] But just to think, I I would far sooner
[59:16] believe that than to believe I just came
[59:19] here by an accident.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; I just dropped in. God knew nothing
[59:23] about me. God's got all this whole
[59:25] planetary system all going up there and
[59:27] all the stars and everything's in
[59:28] absolute precision and and it is so
[59:31] inexhaustible that man can't find it. He
[59:33] can't discover it. He's trying to
[59:35] discover it. And to think that that kind
[59:37] of God who is so infinite has has a son
[59:40] and a daughter born here on earth and
[59:43] and they just happen to arrive. No, I
[59:45] don't believe that. I believe he had
[59:47] absolutely everything in perfect
[59:49] harmony. And he knows exactly when you
[59:51] were born. He knows exactly that you're
[59:53] here right now. And he knows precisely
[59:55] what there is in store for you in the
[59:57] future. And he's the only one who knows.
[1:00:01] And the only assurance that you and I
[1:00:03] can have that that the future will be I
[1:00:07] won't say it be okay for us but and I
[1:00:10] won't say that it'll be easy for us but
[1:00:12] the only way that we know that the
[1:00:14] future will be as it ought to be and
[1:00:17] spiritually rewarding is that we see our
[1:00:21] future in Christ which is the word of
[1:00:24] God. And it it's much deeper than we can
[1:00:27] possibly even touch on tonight.
[1:00:30] all kinds there's all kinds of things
[1:00:32] and they uh and all nations and all
[1:00:35] peoples they always interested and in
[1:00:38] intrigued with the future and that's why
[1:00:40] they have you know fortune tellers and
[1:00:42] in China they have I think what they
[1:00:44] call the yin-yang and uh I know they
[1:00:46] also have a uh uh fortune telling sticks
[1:00:50] special sticks and there's 78 sticks and
[1:00:53] they have uh some some person knows how
[1:00:56] to handle them and supposed to be we
[1:00:57] don't believe in trying to peer into the
[1:01:00] future. But I can tell you one thing,
[1:01:02] the you cannot take the future out of
[1:01:05] the scripture.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; This Bible is absolutely full of the
[1:01:08] future. And it happens to be your
[1:01:10] future. And my future, the future of
[1:01:13] every believer and the future of the
[1:01:16] unbeliever and the future of the
[1:01:18] makebeliever
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; is all here in the scripture.
[1:01:24] Now, in preparation for our lives,
[1:01:28] we get an education,
[1:01:31] for our future,
[1:01:34] get a job for our future. We raise
[1:01:38] families because we anticipate a future.
[1:01:40] We instruct our children, and we
[1:01:43] instruct them to look ahead. Farmers
[1:01:46] plant a crop. Businessmen make
[1:01:49] investments. And they we instruct all of
[1:01:53] our uh those that are around us. We
[1:01:56] expect that they will look a look uh to
[1:01:58] the future, look ahead. And throughout
[1:02:00] our working years, people plan for uh a
[1:02:04] future or perhaps a retirement or
[1:02:06] whatever more
[1:02:08] all plans all plans somewhere along the
[1:02:12] line if Jesus Christ is not included
[1:02:15] will fail.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; And more people are finding, I would say
[1:02:20] more people's plans fail than plans that
[1:02:24] are fulfilled.
[1:02:26] How many people plan for just a glorious
[1:02:30] and absolutely ecstatic marriage and
[1:02:33] wedding and future and all the rest of
[1:02:36] it? And if you took a uh took a analysis
[1:02:40] of it, it is less than what they thought
[1:02:42] it was going to be when they stood at
[1:02:43] the altar. It's not the same thing. I
[1:02:45] know you're quiet now, but that happens
[1:02:47] to be the truth because because we have
[1:02:50] such great anticipations, but yet they
[1:02:53] fall short many times that and the
[1:02:56] anticipation is a uh our pursuit of
[1:02:59] things in the future.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; See, and then falls and spiritually. So,
[1:03:05] you know, a lot of you young men, young
[1:03:07] ladies, you you know, you just come with
[1:03:09] such a surge of energy and all the rest
[1:03:11] of it. But that's why resolve is
[1:03:14] absolutely essential because then it
[1:03:17] doesn't matter what the future is
[1:03:20] actually bringing you. You've resolved
[1:03:22] to serve God and you don't care whether
[1:03:24] it's up or down or backwards or inside
[1:03:27] out or whether it's good times or bad
[1:03:29] times. I I came I resolved I gave my
[1:03:32] life to God. I don't even have it
[1:03:34] anymore.
[1:03:36] Brother Donaldson put a $10 bill up here
[1:03:39] and somebody who wasn't got it.
[1:03:43] I I I thought that
[1:03:46] I thought someone else got it, but I
[1:03:48] couldn't see you from where I was
[1:03:49] sitting. She said, "My wife said, "No,
[1:03:51] no." One of the young boys got up there
[1:03:54] and got it. Well, now instead of instead
[1:03:57] of putting a $10 bill down there, put
[1:03:59] your life down there.
[1:04:03] You didn't give it back to Brother
[1:04:04] Donaldson, did you? No. You're smiling
[1:04:07] real big. You put in the bank.
[1:04:10] All right. And when you put your life
[1:04:12] there now, not a $10 bill, but you lay
[1:04:15] your life on the altar and say, "I'm not
[1:04:18] mine anymore. I give up everything." And
[1:04:21] the Lord comes and snatches that and
[1:04:23] says, "You're mine."
[1:04:25] And you never take it back. You'll never
[1:04:27] get it back because it's now his. That's
[1:04:30] the kind of surrender I'm talking about.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not mine anymore.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; My life is not my own.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; You have been bought with a price and we
[1:04:43] are not our own.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And whatever he determines
[1:04:47] to do, we say, "Thy will be done, oh
[1:04:50] God, on earth as it is in heaven. Do
[1:04:53] with me as you see fit." And then when
[1:04:55] you come with that kind of resolve and
[1:04:57] that's the same today and tomorrow and
[1:05:00] this week and next week and you just go
[1:05:02] steady and straight. I know I've been
[1:05:04] saying these things. I've been making
[1:05:06] reference to these things but that
[1:05:08] happens to be a foundation stone without
[1:05:11] that it's in out up down good day bad
[1:05:15] day. But when you are resolved it a good
[1:05:18] day or a bad day is all the same day. It
[1:05:21] doesn't make one scratch of difference
[1:05:23] to God and it should not make one
[1:05:25] scratch of difference to us what kind of
[1:05:27] a day it is. Everything goes backwards.
[1:05:30] It's going to you got to expect that.
[1:05:33] That's life.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; But when we think about the future,
[1:05:39] you know, usually we're thinking about
[1:05:41] uh you know things that we've prepared
[1:05:43] for and and uh we we expect uh good
[1:05:47] things to happen. I would like you to
[1:05:50] take your Bible now, please, and we're
[1:05:51] going to turn to Matthew the 6th
[1:05:53] chapter,
[1:05:55] starting at verse 25.
[1:06:08] All right. Therefore, what I'll do, I'll
[1:06:12] read the I'll read verse 25, you read
[1:06:14] verse 26, and then we'll alternate.
[1:06:16] Therefore I say unto you, notice now th
[1:06:20] this phrase, take no thought for your
[1:06:22] life, what you shall eat or what you
[1:06:25] shall drink, nor yet for your body, what
[1:06:28] you shall put on. Is not the life more
[1:06:31] than meat and the body than raignment.
[1:06:49] Are you not much better than they? And
[1:06:51] the people said, "Yes."
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Which of you by taking thought, there we
[1:06:56] have it again, can add one cubit onto
[1:07:00] his stature?
[1:07:11] And yet I say unto you that even Solomon
[1:07:15] in all his glory was not a raid like one
[1:07:18] of these.
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:33] Therefore, take no thought, saying,
[1:07:35] "What shall we eat, or what shall we
[1:07:37] drink, or wherewithal shall we be
[1:07:39] clothed?"
[1:07:50] But seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[1:07:52] and his righteousness, and all these
[1:07:54] things shall be added unto you.
[1:08:07] I want to read the dialot for the last
[1:08:10] verse. Take take therefore no thought.
[1:08:14] The digot, the original Greek says, "Be
[1:08:17] not anxious then about the moral
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; for the moral will claim anxiety for
[1:08:23] itself.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Sufficient for each day is its own
[1:08:28] trouble."
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't that perfect? Now, that puts the
[1:08:33] right kind of slant on it. Be not
[1:08:35] anxious then about the moral, for the
[1:08:39] moral will claim anxiety for itself.
[1:08:43] Don't borrow today the anxiety from
[1:08:46] tomorrow because when tomorrow arrives,
[1:08:48] you'll have sufficient anxiety tomorrow.
[1:08:51] So don't borrow it now and and bear it
[1:08:54] now. You'll have enough tomorrow.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Sufficient for each day is its own
[1:09:02] trouble. You might say, "Well, we didn't
[1:09:03] come to church tonight, uh, Brother Ed,
[1:09:05] to hear that." But that happens to be
[1:09:07] the reality. you will have a certain
[1:09:10] portion of anxiety tomorrow and you'll
[1:09:12] have enough for tomorrow. So, we won't
[1:09:14] borrow any from tomorrow for today.
[1:09:18] And then what Paul or rather what Jesus
[1:09:21] is speaking of here when he said and I'
[1:09:24] I'd like you to just notice please in
[1:09:26] the 25th verse he said take uh take no
[1:09:31] thought for your life.
[1:09:36] 28th verse he asks why take ye thought
[1:09:40] for arignment and so on. The 31st verse
[1:09:44] he said therefore take no thought
[1:09:48] and the 34th verse take therefore no
[1:09:52] thought. Say you know which of you by
[1:09:55] taking a thought you can add anything to
[1:09:57] your stature. No.
[1:10:00] And why take a thought therefore take no
[1:10:03] thought. And what Jesus is saying
[1:10:06] because the word thought is to have care
[1:10:09] or to be anxious to be troubled with
[1:10:13] cares. To be troubled with cares. This
[1:10:16] happens to be friends in this age is a
[1:10:19] plague.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; It's a plague. It's not one just
[1:10:22] touching, you know, the odd one here,
[1:10:24] the odd one there. It's like a blanket
[1:10:26] that covers us all. and and and and some
[1:10:29] perhaps more than others, but there's a
[1:10:31] anxious concern. To be anxious or to be
[1:10:34] troubled with cares or to look out for a
[1:10:37] thing, it's something that's on your
[1:10:39] mind. It's something that you're
[1:10:40] concerned with. Well, naturally, we have
[1:10:43] to be concerned. The other side of this
[1:10:45] is the the Bible tells us to be
[1:10:47] diligent. The Bible tells us to serve
[1:10:49] our employers with singleness of mind,
[1:10:52] singleness of eye. The Bible tells us
[1:10:54] that if we don't work, we don't eat. The
[1:10:57] Bible tells us all of those things, but
[1:10:59] this is taking it further. This is a
[1:11:02] anxious care, anxiety, and Jesus is
[1:11:06] saying, don't take any thought. Don't be
[1:11:08] anxious and and and filled with concern
[1:11:12] and troubled in your mind over tomorrow
[1:11:15] or over how I'm going to do this or
[1:11:17] what's going to be in the future because
[1:11:20] he doesn't want us to take. He says,
[1:11:22] "Take not thought. Why take thought?
[1:11:25] Which of you can by uh can can by taking
[1:11:29] thought can add your stature? We there
[1:11:31] are in other words we cannot achieve or
[1:11:35] accomplish what our objective is by all
[1:11:39] of this anxious concern anyway.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; And it is this kind of thing that Jesus
[1:11:46] is referring to in another scripture
[1:11:49] in Mark 4:14. if you'd like to turn to
[1:11:52] it
[1:11:56] because he's speaking about the swer in
[1:11:59] the 14th verse. Mark 4:14, the swer
[1:12:03] sweeth the seed and these are they by
[1:12:07] the wayside which the word where where
[1:12:10] the word is sown. But when they have
[1:12:13] heard, Satan cometh immediately and
[1:12:16] taketh away the word that was sown in
[1:12:18] their hearts. Now, when we read this,
[1:12:22] you can just give me your attention for
[1:12:23] a few moments. When we read this, we've
[1:12:26] had a lot of marvelous and powerful
[1:12:29] preaching just over the last few weeks.
[1:12:31] I will say that there is on a continual
[1:12:34] basis. This seed of this message is
[1:12:38] being sown in the hearts of the people.
[1:12:41] And I feel it tonight. I need to alert
[1:12:43] you and to remind others and to bring it
[1:12:46] to your remembrance
[1:12:49] that Satan is standing ready and by to
[1:12:53] steal that word
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; and have you forget it instead of
[1:12:58] pondering on it. And then he would far
[1:13:01] sooner have you distracted over here and
[1:13:03] become all wrapped up and concerned
[1:13:06] about something and have anxiety about
[1:13:08] your life or about your future and about
[1:13:10] this that you don't have control over
[1:13:12] anyway. Not that we shouldn't prepare
[1:13:14] for it. Prepare for it and and do what
[1:13:16] you can that way. But we're living each
[1:13:19] day each day without the anxiety,
[1:13:23] without the fretting, without the
[1:13:25] turmoil, without the troubled mind.
[1:13:28] Because that troubled mind is actually
[1:13:30] displacing the very mind that God wants
[1:13:33] and needs for your spiritual life.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; That's exactly true. I told you this is
[1:13:41] kind of, you know, going to be meat and
[1:13:42] potatoes, but we need that once in a
[1:13:44] while.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And so we don't take the he said that
[1:13:49] the enemy Satan cometh immediately.
[1:13:54] Verse 15. And taketh away the word that
[1:13:58] was sown in their hearts.
[1:14:00] And these are they likewise which are
[1:14:03] sown on stony ground who when they have
[1:14:06] heard the word immediately received it
[1:14:08] with gladness. And I would say there are
[1:14:11] that everyone has received the word with
[1:14:13] gladness. And that still doesn't deter
[1:14:15] the enemy.
[1:14:18] They have and have no root in
[1:14:20] themselves. And so they endure, but for
[1:14:22] a short time afterward when affliction,
[1:14:26] they didn't expect it.
[1:14:29] And persecution ariseth. That was in
[1:14:32] their future. But when they were hearing
[1:14:33] the word and oh, they were so ecstatic.
[1:14:36] They were receiving the word and they
[1:14:37] were just on such joy and excitement and
[1:14:39] all the rest of it. Oh, we're here at
[1:14:40] camp or we're here in a meeting or we're
[1:14:42] we just had a glorious service and I'm
[1:14:45] just so gripped with the oh what the
[1:14:47] pastor preached or what the special
[1:14:49] speaker spoke or one of the other
[1:14:51] ministers and we're just so moved by it.
[1:14:55] You have to make certain that it's not
[1:14:56] just moved in the emotional realm. It
[1:14:58] has to be something in the that drops
[1:15:00] down to the soul. When you hear
[1:15:02] something that enthuses and excites you,
[1:15:05] I'm going to give you some advice right
[1:15:06] now. You say and just take exactly what
[1:15:09] the prophet has said. You're a triune
[1:15:10] being and say, "Oh, God, don't leave
[1:15:13] that. Don't leave it just in my mind.
[1:15:15] Satan will take it. Don't leave it in my
[1:15:17] emotional realm because my emotions will
[1:15:20] change by tomorrow morning. But let it
[1:15:22] drop down to my soul. Let the seed come
[1:15:26] down to my soul. And once it is dropped
[1:15:29] there, it's anchored there forever.
[1:15:32] Hallelujah.
[1:15:34] And if you're not a new creature in
[1:15:35] Christ Jesus, you will become one. If
[1:15:37] you're not filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:15:38] you will be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:40] When that word, if you take that pattern
[1:15:42] and you come to a service even like this
[1:15:44] and walk out of these doors, maybe we
[1:15:46] don't have an altar call, you're not
[1:15:47] prayed for and all of those things.
[1:15:49] That's fine. You walk out. You don't
[1:15:51] need that. You just walk out of these
[1:15:52] doors. You say, "Father, I know
[1:15:55] according to the word, my eternal body
[1:15:58] was calling for this for this nutrition
[1:16:00] tonight. the spiritual vitamins that I
[1:16:03] received tonight. I needed that and
[1:16:05] that's why I was there. Don't let me
[1:16:07] just be excited. Don't let me just be
[1:16:09] enthused. Don't let me just say amen. I
[1:16:12] I'm asking that the Holy Spirit will
[1:16:14] take that word and drop it from the womb
[1:16:16] of my mind down into my soul. I will
[1:16:19] respect it. I will love it. I will
[1:16:23] cherish that word. I will ponder upon
[1:16:26] it. I'll put a note in my Bible. I'll
[1:16:28] read these verses again so I can see
[1:16:32] this person here never expected the
[1:16:35] affliction and the persecution. But when
[1:16:38] you have resolved then it doesn't make
[1:16:40] any difference. Then the next day
[1:16:42] persecution comes.
[1:16:44] Well, if it doesn't come down to the
[1:16:46] soul and you say, "Oh, I was just I I
[1:16:49] was expecting a great time. I thought
[1:16:50] we're going to have this old time. I
[1:16:52] didn't expect this. They're calling me
[1:16:53] all kinds of names or saying all kinds
[1:16:55] of nasty things or or the place that I
[1:16:57] work. This thing's going backwards. This
[1:16:59] is going sideways. I never expected
[1:17:01] that. Of course not. But we don't know
[1:17:04] our future.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; If you had never if you never even said
[1:17:08] yes to God, you still wouldn't know the
[1:17:10] future.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; So, is it better to trust him?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; And we'll go on now
[1:17:19] verse 17. and had no roots in
[1:17:20] themselves, and so endure for a short
[1:17:22] time afterward, when affliction or
[1:17:24] persecution ariseth for the word's sake,
[1:17:27] immediately they are offended. And these
[1:17:30] are they which are sown among thorns,
[1:17:32] such as hear the word, and the cares of
[1:17:35] this world. Here we are now, that same
[1:17:37] word, the cares of this world. This
[1:17:41] world is filled with cares. And I want
[1:17:44] to rise up against those cares because
[1:17:47] they're destructive to your spiritual
[1:17:49] life and mine.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; They're a tool in Satan's hand.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Your cares,
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; my cares. We all have them. And this
[1:18:00] world is is plagued with cares, one kind
[1:18:04] or another. There's something. Now, just
[1:18:06] assess it in your own mind. What what
[1:18:08] what consumes your thought? What
[1:18:11] occupies? And those things that cause us
[1:18:14] to be anxious about things that is
[1:18:18] actually robbing us of the time that God
[1:18:21] would like to take the word and instill
[1:18:23] it into us to give us faith to deal with
[1:18:26] that anxious time.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; It's not that the anxious time won't be
[1:18:31] there. Did you follow me? Did you follow
[1:18:33] that? I'm not saying that we're not
[1:18:35] going to have anxious time. I'm not
[1:18:37] saying that you're supposed to ignore
[1:18:39] it. I'm saying is that Satan uses he
[1:18:42] uses the cares and the the anxieties of
[1:18:46] life to displace the time that God wants
[1:18:50] for you as a believer so that you can so
[1:18:53] that you can contemplate and meditate
[1:18:56] and have time in the word and have time
[1:18:59] to to just uh be in the presence of God.
[1:19:02] You can be in your work. You can be
[1:19:04] amongst your duties. You can be as busy
[1:19:06] as can be, but your time, your thoughts
[1:19:08] are given over. You're not allowing this
[1:19:10] anxiety to to conquer you. And then God
[1:19:14] strengthens you so you can deal with
[1:19:16] that anxiety the way it ought to be.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; That's the order of the day of the
[1:19:21] believer's life.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; And the cares of this world and the
[1:19:31] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[1:19:34] other things entering in choke the word
[1:19:38] and it becometh unfruitful. In other
[1:19:41] words, it actually came to be fruitful
[1:19:42] state but becomes unfruitful. And verse
[1:19:45] 20, and these are they which are sown on
[1:19:48] good ground, such as hear the word and
[1:19:51] receive it, and bring forth fruit, some
[1:19:54] 30fold, some 60fold, some 100fold.
[1:20:02] And the cares of this world. Now, uh I
[1:20:04] was just looking in um a writer has said
[1:20:08] this about
[1:20:10] the cares of this world. anxious
[1:20:13] unreaxing attention to the business of
[1:20:16] this present life. That was what they
[1:20:18] set out as the cares of this world. Then
[1:20:21] the deceitfulness of riches of those
[1:20:24] riches which are the fruit of this
[1:20:25] worldly care. So there's all kinds of
[1:20:28] anxious care about life etc. And then we
[1:20:32] reap some benefits from it. That's what
[1:20:34] keeps the person going. You reap natural
[1:20:37] benefits from the cares of this life.
[1:20:41] But he said of those riches which are
[1:20:44] the fruit of this worldly care, the
[1:20:47] pleasures of life or the lust of other
[1:20:49] things entering in. And I thought this
[1:20:52] paragraph was very, very good. I'd like
[1:20:53] you to just hear it as I read it. The
[1:20:56] enjoyments in themselves may be
[1:20:59] innocent, the pleasures of life, the
[1:21:02] enjoyments may be innocent, which
[1:21:06] worldly prosperity enables one to
[1:21:08] indulge in.
[1:21:10] In other words, the prosperity of life
[1:21:13] person has an anxious cares and they're
[1:21:15] we're in a rat race in this world and it
[1:21:18] has its it has its benefits. Satan has
[1:21:21] made sure it's got some perks
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; and that keeps a person going. Hey, I
[1:21:26] can tell you some of these big
[1:21:27] corporations that are very very
[1:21:29] successful, you know how they keep
[1:21:30] their, you know, how they keep their men
[1:21:32] and keep them burned out, giving them
[1:21:33] perks, perks, perks.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; They got such wonderful perks.
[1:21:39] you know, if if I don't keep, you know,
[1:21:41] if I don't keep just exhausting myself,
[1:21:43] I don't get these perks.
[1:21:50] Hey,
[1:21:52] I was talking to a young man and he was
[1:21:55] just burning himself up. He was working
[1:21:56] 12 hours a day, every day except Sunday.
[1:21:59] 12 hours a day. Every day except Sunday.
[1:22:04] But he was they were barely paying him
[1:22:06] enough to keep body and soul together
[1:22:09] and they just had one child and just
[1:22:11] barely enough to keep paying the bills.
[1:22:15] But the car he drove was such a
[1:22:17] luxurious SUV, you know, thought, man, I
[1:22:22] can't afford to give this up. I give
[1:22:23] this up, I lose this SUV.
[1:22:25] So, I just got to keep serving this
[1:22:28] beast.
[1:22:31] I just got to keep serving it because I
[1:22:32] got this. And not only that, when I
[1:22:34] travel, I stay at the nicest hotels
[1:22:36] and eat good food. And man, I hate to
[1:22:39] lose all those perks. You You kind of
[1:22:42] get used to it, you know, walking in the
[1:22:46] five-star hotel, you know, and fivestar
[1:22:49] room and feels nice. And to think if I
[1:22:52] if I get out of this, I'm back down to
[1:22:54] three stars
[1:22:58] or I'm just down to, you know, I can't
[1:23:01] afford this at all. So they they
[1:23:03] actually keep you going. And how and and
[1:23:05] so what did those perks do? They kept a
[1:23:08] man just grinding it out 12 hours a day
[1:23:11] going home just totally exhausted.
[1:23:14] hardly any time for the wife and hardly
[1:23:16] any time for the for the kid, you know,
[1:23:19] and you know, you're just totally
[1:23:20] exhausted. And by the time you drive to
[1:23:22] work, maybe half an hour or an hour and
[1:23:25] drive away back from work, that 12 hours
[1:23:28] is 14. And by the time you eat, it's 15.
[1:23:32] And by that time, you are dead
[1:23:34] exhausted. And they'd say, "Oh, that's
[1:23:36] just four days." No, that is this week
[1:23:38] and next week and this month and next
[1:23:41] month and in six months. And then they
[1:23:42] say these perks are six months from now
[1:23:45] we're going to make you manager. And
[1:23:46] like they said, you know, that is so you
[1:23:48] can go from up eight hours a day to work
[1:23:50] 12 hours a day to when you get to be
[1:23:52] manager.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's subtle.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Sunday, you pray for me. I want to speak
[1:24:00] on the system.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; The system.
[1:24:05] And these systems become gods
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; and they bow before them and they they
[1:24:11] burn up their life for them. I better
[1:24:13] stop right there. I'm going to be be
[1:24:15] giving all the thunder away for Sunday's
[1:24:17] service.
[1:24:18] The system, the religious system.
[1:24:24] Seal my mouth right now because you're
[1:24:27] perceptive people. You're gonna say,
[1:24:28] "Oh, we know what he's going to preach."
[1:24:32] So the enjoyments themselves may be
[1:24:34] innocent which worldly prosperity
[1:24:36] enables one to indulge. These choke or
[1:24:40] smother the word, drawing off as much of
[1:24:43] one's attention, absorbing so much of
[1:24:46] one's interest and using up so much of
[1:24:49] one's time that only the drags uh the
[1:24:52] drags of these remain for spiritual
[1:24:55] things.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Only the dregs remain for spiritual
[1:24:58] things. True. And a ragged, hurried and
[1:25:02] heartless formalism is at is at length
[1:25:05] all the religion of such a person. Just
[1:25:08] a heartless uh a rather a ragged,
[1:25:12] hurried and heartless formalism.
[1:25:16] What a vivid picture of today.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; It always gets quiet when we touch these
[1:25:21] things because we're all touched on it.
[1:25:23] And you can't escape when the prophet
[1:25:25] said the pressure of this age. We have
[1:25:28] that pressure and and it's not because
[1:25:30] you want that pressure. It's because the
[1:25:34] age has that pressure.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; There's nobody here who voted to pay $3
[1:25:40] a gallon for their gas and here it's
[1:25:42] about five.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Who wanted that?
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Who wants to pay the kind of, you know,
[1:25:49] price for a roof over your head?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Who wants to pay the kind of taxes you
[1:25:54] pay I pay? Who wants to pay that? No,
[1:25:58] you didn't. You didn't try to you didn't
[1:26:00] vote for that. But that's the age you
[1:26:02] live in and that's the country you live
[1:26:05] in. It just happens to be that way. And
[1:26:07] we're caught in that web.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; And so if Satan can, he catches us in
[1:26:13] that web. And so it used to be that if
[1:26:16] you had a grade eight education, you're
[1:26:18] well educated. Very few had a grade
[1:26:21] eight education. Then it was you got to
[1:26:23] have 12 or you're not getting anywhere.
[1:26:25] And you got to have your grade 12 uh
[1:26:27] diploma. And so when I when I was in
[1:26:30] school, that was important thing to have
[1:26:32] a grade 12 diploma. Today they just turn
[1:26:34] their nose up say, "Well, I graduated
[1:26:36] out of grade 12." They want to know what
[1:26:38] further education and the college and
[1:26:41] university and whatever more and what
[1:26:43] degrees and whatever more and and I
[1:26:45] think that that's very very important in
[1:26:47] these times. But that must never become
[1:26:49] a god. Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to have said, "Well, I
[1:26:55] served I served with all my strength and
[1:26:58] all my energy on a material level and
[1:27:02] had nothing but drags left for spiritual
[1:27:05] things. I'm talking to a lot of young
[1:27:08] people here. I would like you to set a
[1:27:10] course in your life that would guarantee
[1:27:13] that God would have first place that he
[1:27:17] will have quality time in your life.
[1:27:20] Maybe at the expense of some pleasure
[1:27:22] maybe at the expense of something else.
[1:27:24] I don't know. But at at least that God
[1:27:28] and I don't believe that when I stand on
[1:27:29] the other side I will have to
[1:27:33] apologize for preaching this message
[1:27:35] tonight.
[1:27:37] I don't believe I'll have to apologize
[1:27:39] for in for just really laying it on the
[1:27:43] line
[1:27:45] and uh so that you'd have some guidance
[1:27:51] now. And here's what brother Brandham
[1:27:54] said in the Thotyron church age.
[1:27:57] He said, "A great burden of this last
[1:27:59] age." And I know that some of you that
[1:28:01] are here, of course, as real students of
[1:28:04] the message, you've heard these things
[1:28:06] many times. But remember, I'm saying
[1:28:08] them not because I don't think that
[1:28:10] we've got them. I enjoy reading it. I
[1:28:12] enjoy preaching it. Again, I enjoy
[1:28:16] being able to lay it out so that the
[1:28:19] young men and the young ladies will have
[1:28:21] this as pillars in their spiritual life.
[1:28:24] Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; A great burden and it's in the Thotyron
[1:28:28] church age. You want to make a note. 239
[1:28:31] page 239 church ages. A great burden of
[1:28:34] this last age is the pressure of riches.
[1:28:37] Now, some would say the great burden of
[1:28:39] this last age is riches. That's not what
[1:28:41] it is. The great burden of this last age
[1:28:44] is the pressure of riches. And as I said
[1:28:46] a moment ago, it's not us who designed
[1:28:49] and desired an economy that is costing
[1:28:52] so much for rent. and so much for food
[1:28:55] and and all of these things going up up
[1:28:57] up up and naturally your salary has to
[1:28:59] go up. It is a treadmill that every
[1:29:01] living person who's you know in the
[1:29:04] system they're they're on that and
[1:29:06] they've got to have a certain amount and
[1:29:08] a father who has children all the rest
[1:29:10] of it and believers of the message. You
[1:29:13] talk about a pressure
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; where our our statistics here in Canada,
[1:29:22] which was released not very long ago,
[1:29:24] proved that here in this area, a two
[1:29:28] wage earning family cannot keep their
[1:29:31] head above water.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; A two wage earning family. And here we
[1:29:37] are,
[1:29:39] I'll say for the most part,
[1:29:41] husbands, one wage earner in a family.
[1:29:46] And I say to God's glory,
[1:29:49] doing better.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; When you talk about doing good, doing
[1:29:53] better than those that are burning it up
[1:29:56] at both ends of the candle, husband,
[1:29:59] wife working, kids cast to the
[1:30:01] television or cast to the mall or
[1:30:03] wherever they're cast to. It's a whole
[1:30:05] lot better with a one-way jourer in the
[1:30:09] in the family according to the prophet's
[1:30:11] message, according to the word of God.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to say also because I know
[1:30:22] there's such an eagerness for spiritual
[1:30:24] things, I'll say to all of our young
[1:30:26] people, don't be anxious over your
[1:30:29] spiritual growth or your spiritual
[1:30:32] advancement. Don't be anxious over
[1:30:35] spiritual things so that they're a worry
[1:30:37] and a care and a concern. Just trust the
[1:30:39] God you gave your life to. I'm yours.
[1:30:42] You take me as far as you want. You show
[1:30:44] me whatever you want me to see. You
[1:30:46] reveal yourself to me, but I will hunger
[1:30:49] and thirst after you.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let that be the pattern of
[1:30:54] your life.
[1:30:58] Now,
[1:30:59] I'll tell you something else. I I
[1:31:01] believe that these little things are
[1:31:02] such lessons for us in brother
[1:31:04] Brandham's life and I take them and
[1:31:05] observe them and they're so excellent.
[1:31:09] Now
[1:31:11] he felt this you know God dealing with
[1:31:14] him in his in his capacity which is you
[1:31:18] know as a as a prophet with a message
[1:31:21] for the world. But you have your own
[1:31:24] corner, you have your own place. I have
[1:31:27] mine. You have yours. And we we will
[1:31:30] have a
[1:31:32] uh we won't understand.
[1:31:35] Listen to me now. We will not understand
[1:31:38] all of God's dealings with within
[1:31:42] yourself. You won't understand it
[1:31:44] always.
[1:31:45] God God's leadings are sometimes very
[1:31:48] mysterious.
[1:31:50] Brother Brandham even said to his wife,
[1:31:53] he said to Sister Mey, "I can't stand
[1:31:55] this anymore.
[1:31:57] I I'm I'm leaving here. I'm going up
[1:32:01] into to my cabin or up to my cave. I'm
[1:32:04] going I'm going to get away and I got to
[1:32:07] get an answer and I won't be back till I
[1:32:10] get the answer.
[1:32:13] Now, what what is he talking about? He
[1:32:15] He was talking about his future. He knew
[1:32:18] that, you know, somehow God was dealing
[1:32:20] with him, but he didn't know what it was
[1:32:23] going to come to. He didn't know what
[1:32:25] the future was in his spiritual life.
[1:32:29] Now you can just you can stay and just
[1:32:32] stew about it and and but you but he did
[1:32:34] the right thing and that is the pattern.
[1:32:37] He just got alone with God. God God by
[1:32:39] himself said I'm going to I'm going to
[1:32:41] find out from God what this is all
[1:32:43] about. I can't go any further because
[1:32:46] he'd wondered about it for a long time.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; I hope this meaning something to you.
[1:32:59] Now, God does not tell us everything
[1:33:03] about our future.
[1:33:08] Yet, he promises us a future that you
[1:33:11] would not trade for anything else.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily an easy
[1:33:20] future, but a fulfilled future.
[1:33:24] These are chosen sentences.
[1:33:28] You want to remember them.
[1:33:30] The more future you have, the more
[1:33:33] reason you have to be keen and have a
[1:33:35] keen interest in it.
[1:33:38] The will of God and the leading of the
[1:33:41] Holy Spirit in that plan can often be a
[1:33:44] great mystery
[1:33:46] and it will be.
[1:33:49] People make plans, have short-term and
[1:33:52] long-term objectives that do not have
[1:33:55] Jesus Christ at the center of their
[1:33:57] plans.
[1:33:59] The world is filled with bitter
[1:34:02] disappointment. And those kinds of plans
[1:34:05] will end up in disappointment.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; The bornagain believer has Christ at the
[1:34:12] very heart and center of their plans and
[1:34:15] never are disappointed.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "Will there be no
[1:34:20] disappointment?" There will be things
[1:34:22] happen that you never planned.
[1:34:25] But when you've made Christ the center
[1:34:27] of your plans and he is the objective in
[1:34:32] everything that you do, then whether
[1:34:34] it's a whether whatever kind of reversal
[1:34:37] or whatever happens, I'm trying to tell
[1:34:40] you friends, there are things which will
[1:34:42] pain you. There are things which will
[1:34:44] bring sorrow to you. There are things
[1:34:45] which will grieve you. But I will say
[1:34:48] that some of my greatest griefs have
[1:34:51] come from what I know the Holy Spirit is
[1:34:55] grieved with.
[1:34:57] And if you have that kind of grief, I
[1:35:00] say to you, go
[1:35:04] and bear it
[1:35:06] thankfully that you can bear some of his
[1:35:09] stripes
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; and you can bear some of his grief. And
[1:35:13] if the Holy Spirit is grieved and you
[1:35:14] are a possessor of the Holy Spirit and
[1:35:17] you are a temple of the Holy Spirit and
[1:35:19] the Holy Spirit becomes grieved about
[1:35:21] something, let me tell you something.
[1:35:23] You're going to feel it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; You're going to experience it. You're
[1:35:27] going to have it. And when you do have
[1:35:29] it, you won't want to escape it. You
[1:35:30] won't say, "Oh, God, take this away from
[1:35:32] me." And you won't say, "God, is this
[1:35:35] you or is this a devil?" I have all
[1:35:37] kinds of people. I hear it all the time,
[1:35:39] Brother Biscll. I don't know whether
[1:35:41] this is God or this is the devil. Well,
[1:35:43] when a person's life is totally focused
[1:35:47] on Christ and he is the center of
[1:35:50] everything, you will know that it is for
[1:35:53] Christ's sake, whatever it might be. And
[1:35:55] it may not be good because Christ didn't
[1:35:57] suffer everything good. He didn't I
[1:35:59] mean, he didn't experience everything
[1:36:00] that was good. Now, God spoke through
[1:36:04] Jeremiah.
[1:36:06] If you want to write it down, it's the
[1:36:08] 29th chapter of Jeremiah.
[1:36:11] And he said to Jeremiah through
[1:36:12] Jeremiah, thus saith the Lord of hosts,
[1:36:15] the God of Israel, unto all that are
[1:36:17] carried away captives. Now, how many
[1:36:20] knows what he's talking about? He's
[1:36:21] talking about Israel carried away into
[1:36:24] Babylon for 70 years.
[1:36:27] And so the Lord is speaking to all that
[1:36:31] were carried away captives whom I have
[1:36:33] caused to be carried away from Jerusalem
[1:36:34] unto Babylon. And here's what he's
[1:36:37] telling them to do. Build houses, dwell
[1:36:40] in them, plant gardens, and eat the
[1:36:43] fruit of them. Take your wives. In other
[1:36:45] words, don't stop getting married. Get
[1:36:48] married and beget sons and daughters.
[1:36:51] and take wives for your sons and give
[1:36:54] your daughters to husbands that they may
[1:36:56] bear sons and daughters that you may be
[1:36:58] increased there and not diminished. This
[1:37:00] was the instruction. What's he doing?
[1:37:03] He's telling them their future.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Get a house. Live in a house. I'm not
[1:37:08] telling you that. I'm telling that's
[1:37:10] what God spoke to them to do it. And
[1:37:12] seek the peace of the city whether I
[1:37:14] have caused you to be carried away
[1:37:16] captives. And pray unto the Lord for it.
[1:37:20] For in the peace thereof, shall you have
[1:37:22] peace. For thus sayith the Lord of
[1:37:24] hosts, the God of Israel, let not your
[1:37:27] prophets and your divers, what are they?
[1:37:30] Fortune tellers. Prophets and divers.
[1:37:34] Don't let them that be in the midst of
[1:37:37] you deceive you, neither hearken to
[1:37:40] their dreams, which and neither hearken
[1:37:43] to your dreams which ye cause to be
[1:37:46] dreamed. He said, "Don't listen to the
[1:37:48] prophets and the divers who were
[1:37:51] speaking contrary to the word that was
[1:37:53] coming from the prophet. Don't listen to
[1:37:55] it." You know, there's all kinds of
[1:37:57] voices. Let me say this. There's more
[1:37:59] voices against the message than there is
[1:38:01] for it. And a lot of those voices and
[1:38:04] influence come right from within a
[1:38:06] church. Right within the message. They
[1:38:09] give all kinds of instruction and all
[1:38:11] kinds of and tell you about you know
[1:38:13] what your future is or you know and they
[1:38:15] don't put it that way that I'm going to
[1:38:17] tell you your future. I'm a fortune
[1:38:19] teller. I'm a diver. I'm a I'm a prophet
[1:38:21] or a prophetess. They don't but all
[1:38:23] kinds of advice you know and all kinds
[1:38:25] of counsel which actually is reaching
[1:38:27] into your future to shape your life to
[1:38:31] how you're going to serve God and and
[1:38:33] all of these things. And then what
[1:38:35] happens is
[1:38:37] the outcome isn't what you expected it
[1:38:41] to be. And furthermore, furthermore, he
[1:38:44] says he said here and and neither
[1:38:47] hearken to your dreams. Everybody has a
[1:38:50] dream.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Everyone has an expectation. He said
[1:38:54] which you cause to be dreamed. And and
[1:38:57] the individual themselves, they had an
[1:38:59] aspiration. They had an expectation for
[1:39:02] a certain thing. And he and he and don't
[1:39:04] trust those dreams.
[1:39:06] Don't trust them. Just trust exactly
[1:39:09] what the word and the word alone has
[1:39:11] said.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; You know, you're here on a Wednesday
[1:39:15] night and there's always a very
[1:39:17] wonderful audience on a Wednesday night.
[1:39:19] You're here not to put in some time. You
[1:39:22] have left other things undone to come
[1:39:25] here. you have left uh valuable time,
[1:39:28] quality time you could have had with the
[1:39:30] family or doing something productive or
[1:39:33] or or or maybe some of you could have
[1:39:35] got some work done and you could have
[1:39:37] made some extra cash by by uh being away
[1:39:40] and working, but you're here in church
[1:39:42] and the reason you're here is because
[1:39:44] you want to make this a focal point in
[1:39:47] your spiritual life and you have and
[1:39:49] you've done that and that's why God will
[1:39:51] honor you.
[1:39:53] Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; But we have our dreams and our
[1:39:57] aspirations. They must come subject to
[1:40:00] the word of God. And he said, "For they
[1:40:03] prophesy falsely unto you in my name. I
[1:40:06] have not sent them, saith the Lord. For
[1:40:09] thus saith the Lord, that after 70 years
[1:40:12] be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit
[1:40:15] you and perform my good word toward you
[1:40:18] in causing you to return to this place.
[1:40:22] for I know. And brother Brandham takes
[1:40:24] this scripture. You can if you have a
[1:40:27] computer system, you can look it up. But
[1:40:30] he said this was a lovely thought. And
[1:40:32] he and God says, "For I know the
[1:40:35] thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth
[1:40:38] the Lord, thoughts of peace and not
[1:40:41] evil, to give you an expected end." God
[1:40:46] is actually prophesying, I'm going to
[1:40:48] give you an expected end. And the
[1:40:52] expected end here, the word what he's
[1:40:54] using, it is a I will give you a a hope.
[1:40:58] I will give you an expectation. I will
[1:41:02] give you an outcome. I like to say to
[1:41:04] the congregation tonight, I'm not
[1:41:06] interested in anybody else's outcome for
[1:41:08] my life.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; None of my family. They probably wish
[1:41:12] the very best for me. And you got and
[1:41:15] and I know in a congregation you you
[1:41:17] think the best. You say, "Oh, we just
[1:41:19] wish you'll just have a prosperous and a
[1:41:22] happy and a joyfilled and a healthy life
[1:41:24] and all that." And I say, "Amen." Amen.
[1:41:26] Amen. I I hope all of those things. But
[1:41:29] the real future that I want is held in
[1:41:32] his hands.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; I want his future.
[1:41:37] You want his future. And we don't know
[1:41:41] what it is, but the consecrated life
[1:41:44] will have his future unfolded in your
[1:41:48] life.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; And he says to give you an expected end.
[1:41:54] In other words, to give you a hope or to
[1:41:58] give you his outcome, to give you
[1:42:02] something that you will wait and look
[1:42:04] eagerly for. And this is wonderful.
[1:42:07] You remember when Rahab put the cord in
[1:42:10] the window? What color was it?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Scarlet, a scarlet cord, a token. Says,
[1:42:17] "Give me a token." Says, "You put the
[1:42:19] cord in the window." And the exact word
[1:42:23] that God uses in the Bible for your
[1:42:26] expectation is the exact word for the
[1:42:29] line, the cord in Rahab's window. When
[1:42:33] she looked in that window, she had an
[1:42:35] expectation.
[1:42:37] She had a hope. And her hope and her
[1:42:40] expectation did not come from the city
[1:42:43] she lived in. It didn't come from her
[1:42:46] family. It came right out of the very
[1:42:49] out of the very source of Israel. The
[1:42:51] word of God came to her and gave her a
[1:42:54] token. You will remain and all that is
[1:42:57] under this roof shall be saved. Oh,
[1:43:00] isn't that a wonderful thing? Yeah.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; And she could go to the window
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; and see that line there. You know what
[1:43:07] that line was? You know what that
[1:43:09] scarlet cord was? Was God's thought
[1:43:12] concerning her.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; God's thought concerning everyone who
[1:43:17] would be in that house. That cord was a
[1:43:21] token or a promise of God. That was a
[1:43:24] sign of God's promise to her.
[1:43:27] Hallelujah.
[1:43:29] And God is saying to us that I have
[1:43:32] given you an expected end. I've given
[1:43:36] you. I have given you. And there has
[1:43:38] never been a people that I know of.
[1:43:40] There's been no people throughout this
[1:43:42] 2,000 years of church ages that has had
[1:43:45] such an authorative vindicated voice
[1:43:49] that has given us a promise has given us
[1:43:51] a promise of a rapture of a a of an
[1:43:54] eternal life and eternal body and a a a
[1:43:58] change of this body. God has given us
[1:44:01] that in this day.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, it's in the Bible."
[1:44:05] That's absolutely right. But I'm talking
[1:44:07] it's been pinpointed now. It's been
[1:44:09] specified. It's been designated to a
[1:44:12] certain people. This just isn't
[1:44:14] something that's out there for the whole
[1:44:16] world. Now he sends a voice. Now he
[1:44:19] sends a message and says it's for these
[1:44:22] people.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; I've given you an expected end.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Something you can look at and every time
[1:44:30] you look at it say there is my hope and
[1:44:34] there is my future. It doesn't lay
[1:44:37] anywhere else.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; It's not in my school. It's not in my
[1:44:41] education. It's not in my job. It's not
[1:44:44] in my raise. It's not in my profession.
[1:44:47] This expectation is here in the word of
[1:44:50] God. And my future is in the word.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And that's when Joshua
[1:45:00] sent word and she said, "According unto
[1:45:03] your words, so be it." And she sent them
[1:45:06] away and departed. And she bound the
[1:45:10] scarlet expectation.
[1:45:14] The word is line. She bound the scarlet
[1:45:17] hope in her window. She bound the
[1:45:21] scarlet promise in her window.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it that way. The same word. I
[1:45:27] will give you an expectation. This was
[1:45:30] this was Rahab's back there. The people
[1:45:33] in Babylon had Jeremiah's words and we
[1:45:38] have a prophet's words. We have brother
[1:45:40] Brandon's words.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to just end here in a moment.
[1:45:48] Just bear with me. The hope or
[1:45:50] expectation is from God. And that is why
[1:45:53] the psalmist David said, "My soul
[1:45:57] wait thou only upon God." Now, have you
[1:46:00] ever talked to yourself?
[1:46:04] I do all the time. So, you do? Is that
[1:46:07] where these messages come from? No. But
[1:46:10] I talk to myself all the time. David
[1:46:12] talked to himself.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "My soul,
[1:46:16] wait thou upon God, for my expectation
[1:46:19] is from him." Yeah.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; So, you walk down the street tomorrow
[1:46:23] and all the people are around there and
[1:46:25] looking at you and you just say to
[1:46:27] yourself and you're all by yourself, "My
[1:46:29] soul, wait thou upon God for my
[1:46:31] expectations from him." They're going to
[1:46:34] take a side glance at you. Say,
[1:46:42] "Okay, here now here's your future.
[1:46:46] The promises of God's people are even
[1:46:49] more valid now than they were. And I'm
[1:46:52] taking these out of out of the Bible.
[1:46:55] I'll tell you in a moment where it's
[1:46:56] from
[1:47:00] now. Therefore, go
[1:47:03] and I will go. Let me ask you a
[1:47:05] question. If I can read this out of the
[1:47:07] Old Testament, do you not think it's
[1:47:09] valid for you right now? Even more so
[1:47:11] than it was there. more so today under
[1:47:15] grace than it is under law. Far more so.
[1:47:19] Far more potent.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; That was a shadow. Now this is the that
[1:47:23] was the negative. Now it's the positive.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Now therefore go and I will go with thy
[1:47:32] mouth and teach thee what thou shalt
[1:47:34] say. Your future,
[1:47:37] my people, your future
[1:47:40] involves you saying something.
[1:47:43] Your future involves you as a witness
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; because that is your whole purpose of
[1:47:50] being here and you shall be witnesses
[1:47:53] unto me.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; What is it I should say? I pray with
[1:47:57] people regularly. I'm going I'm going to
[1:47:59] visit my relatives. We're going to see
[1:48:01] unsaved friends. Pray with me so I'll
[1:48:04] know what to say. And I tell them, God
[1:48:07] may give you something to say and he may
[1:48:10] have you be silent.
[1:48:12] He may have you preach it in your
[1:48:15] action.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; He may have you just demonstrate the
[1:48:18] very Christ that's in you.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; And that will speak louder than even
[1:48:22] your words many times. And if he has you
[1:48:25] say something, may it be choice words
[1:48:28] sent by the Holy Spirit from the very
[1:48:31] throne of God to the very heart of the
[1:48:33] people of the hearer of the word. And he
[1:48:36] gave a promise. I'll be with your mouth.
[1:48:38] And I felt inspired tonight to give this
[1:48:40] to you, especially young men and young
[1:48:43] women, but to all this congregation.
[1:48:45] God's promise to us, I'll be with your
[1:48:48] mouth and I will teach you what to say.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; And I say, amen.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; That is in your future.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; That might be yet tonight,
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; but it's in your future.
[1:49:02] And he says, "And thou shalt speak."
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to notice thou shalt
[1:49:09] because that's not you have but you will
[1:49:13] you shall speak
[1:49:17] and then he says
[1:49:20] he he gave some statements concerning
[1:49:22] thou shalt said thou shalt say thou
[1:49:26] shalt stand thou shalt know that I am
[1:49:30] the Lord. Those three are powerful. And
[1:49:33] I say, God, let that be in my future. I
[1:49:37] claim that for myself. Thou shalt say,
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; This isn't some false divination now.
[1:49:46] This isn't some false prophecy. This is
[1:49:49] the truth of God's word. You shall
[1:49:52] speak.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; You shall say it.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; And God shall be with your mouth. and he
[1:49:59] shall teach you what to say. And thou
[1:50:02] shalt know that I am the Lord. Oh, bless
[1:50:06] his name.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; And I'm taking that now for myself. This
[1:50:11] next one, and thou shalt teach them
[1:50:13] ordinances and laws. Thou shalt show
[1:50:17] them the way wherein they must walk and
[1:50:19] the work that they must do. There's
[1:50:22] something for us to do.
[1:50:25] And he says, "If thou shalt do this
[1:50:28] thing, and God commanded thee so, then
[1:50:32] thou shalt be able to endure."
[1:50:37] I'm saying to every person here tonight,
[1:50:39] thou shalt, this is your future.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt be able to endure.
[1:50:49] I've been down the road a long ways
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; and I've seen
[1:50:55] elder elder men
[1:50:58] even in the message I've seen them what
[1:51:02] I would say become entangled in a way
[1:51:06] that to me brought a great deal of
[1:51:08] sadness.
[1:51:10] I certainly wouldn't want that. I've
[1:51:12] seen young people do it. I've seen young
[1:51:16] people turn aside. And I'm pressing
[1:51:18] this. I'm pressing this point real hard.
[1:51:20] I say to you, in the name of the Lord,
[1:51:21] don't you turn aside.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; You stay the course.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've been hearing you
[1:51:27] say that, Brother Biscll, and I'm going
[1:51:28] to continue to say it." You stay the
[1:51:30] course. You be resolved. And say, "I am
[1:51:33] resolved and nothing can change my
[1:51:35] mind." And you speak it because when you
[1:51:38] speak it, the devil hears it.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Don't let anything change that.
[1:51:44] Hallelujah. I've lived long enough. I've
[1:51:47] seen people go through sickness. Go
[1:51:50] through a tremendous amount of sickness.
[1:51:54] We were visiting I see our sister
[1:51:56] Slagger here. God bless her. A mother of
[1:52:00] Sister Marge Miller. And we were with
[1:52:02] Sister Marge. Uh I've I've spoken about
[1:52:06] her several times here, but
[1:52:10] my wife and I spent with uh Sister Sleer
[1:52:14] and uh and Sister Patricia Drake and
[1:52:18] Sister Shauna Grunard. We were all there
[1:52:21] together
[1:52:22] and and here's this woman. Sister Marge
[1:52:26] has been afflicted off and on
[1:52:29] and uh I believe since 1991.
[1:52:32] That's about 14 years. 14 years. And she
[1:52:36] says to me, "Read some scripture.
[1:52:40] Read some scripture." And she's reaching
[1:52:43] her little slim thin body ravished by
[1:52:47] this cancer. And really, I don't know
[1:52:50] why.
[1:52:51] Well, I don't know why that thing even
[1:52:53] is there. and she's wanting me to reach
[1:52:55] for her Bible to looking for it. And I
[1:52:57] find her Bible, big heavy Bible. I bring
[1:52:59] it out. I start to read some scripture
[1:53:02] and the presence of God comes in the
[1:53:04] room and and and there she is laying in
[1:53:07] this bed, what they would call, as far
[1:53:09] as the world is concerned, in the final
[1:53:11] stages of cancer. And she raises her
[1:53:14] little slim bony hands to the air and
[1:53:18] begins to worship God and worship God
[1:53:20] and worship God. I say friends, my
[1:53:23] brother, my sister, we haven't got a
[1:53:25] thing in the world to claim to complain
[1:53:27] about. We haven't got a thing in the
[1:53:29] world. And not one time, not one time
[1:53:34] does a does a negative thing come out of
[1:53:36] her mouth.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; A shame to a lot of people. We should
[1:53:41] not have that. And just I was leaving
[1:53:43] the other day, I just was slipping away
[1:53:46] and we were just getting ready to go and
[1:53:47] I just touched I said, "Sister Marge, is
[1:53:51] there anything we can do for you?" And
[1:53:53] those dark eyes flashed at that word
[1:53:57] just flashed. She said, "Yes.
[1:54:00] Yes, there is.
[1:54:02] Pray for my two sons."
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:09] after all those years.
[1:54:12] That is what I'm telling you tonight is
[1:54:15] a Christ centered life.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; There's no self-pity.
[1:54:22] There's no, oh, pity me.
[1:54:25] Can I do anything? And she wasn't
[1:54:27] thinking of herself. Not one word for
[1:54:30] me. Don't do anything for me. Pray for
[1:54:33] my two sons.
[1:54:36] And I made her that promise
[1:54:39] said, "I will pray for them and I have
[1:54:42] been from that time."
[1:54:48] And whether God allows her,
[1:54:51] do you think I'd be surprised she walked
[1:54:53] through those doors right now? Not one
[1:54:55] twit.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I'll be surprised if she
[1:54:58] doesn't come to church.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; I fully expect it. Fully expect it. Not
[1:55:03] at all. It's not my stubborn mind. I
[1:55:05] just fully expect it.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; She's too young to go.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; But here's a woman and I can tell you if
[1:55:11] God takes her home, it'll be like
[1:55:13] someone said, "The good ones go and the
[1:55:16] bad ones stay."
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; I have seen people go, Brother Chris,
[1:55:22] Brother Ernie, young people, I've seen
[1:55:24] them go. And you know, when they were
[1:55:26] done, I had to speak over their coffin.
[1:55:29] And you know what was going on in my
[1:55:30] heart? They were too good to stay,
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; They were just too good to stay. And God
[1:55:37] said, "I'm not going to leave them there
[1:55:38] anymore. I want them."
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Saying to the world, "You've had them
[1:55:42] long enough. I want them. I want them
[1:55:45] right with me in my kingdom."
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; We don't understand those kind of
[1:55:49] things. But that is exactly what
[1:55:51] happens.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; God takes them.
[1:55:59] And I close with this. Brother Brandham
[1:56:02] says,
[1:56:04] "Faith doesn't look at the present."
[1:56:09] Faith doesn't see this here.
[1:56:13] Faith looks to see what God wants.
[1:56:18] He says, "And works accordingly." That's
[1:56:20] what faith does. It sees what God wants
[1:56:24] and what God wants done. And faith
[1:56:26] operates through that.
[1:56:31] Listen everyone now. Faith has long
[1:56:33] range vision.
[1:56:36] It doesn't lower its sight. It holds to
[1:56:39] the target. Any good shooter knows that.
[1:56:42] He said that it it's long range. It's a
[1:56:45] telescope. It's a binocular that you
[1:56:47] don't look around here. You don't use
[1:56:50] binoculars to look to see what time it
[1:56:52] is on your watch. You don't look
[1:56:54] binoculars to see what time it is on
[1:56:56] your watch.
[1:56:58] He said you don't use it for that, but
[1:57:00] you use binoculars to look way off. And
[1:57:04] faith does that. Faith picks up God's
[1:57:06] binoculars, both of them, both sides,
[1:57:09] the New and the Old Testament. And
[1:57:11] tonight, I went into the New and the Old
[1:57:14] Testament, so you could take the
[1:57:16] binoculars of God's word and look up
[1:57:18] into not my future, not your neighbor's
[1:57:21] future, but your future.
[1:57:24] And when you look up there, you want to
[1:57:26] see at every station in your life, I see
[1:57:28] Christ. I see the word right at the
[1:57:31] center of my life. I don't see anything
[1:57:33] else. That's exactly how I've placed my
[1:57:35] life. I'm looking at those promises. And
[1:57:37] when he says, "Thou shalt," I say, "I
[1:57:39] will. Thou shalt do this. Thou shalt
[1:57:42] speak. I will speak. Thou shalt know the
[1:57:44] Lord thy God. I will know the Lord my
[1:57:46] God." Thou shalt mount up with wings as
[1:57:49] eagles. I will mount up with wings as
[1:57:51] eagles.
[1:57:55] and every promise that he made and faith
[1:57:57] sees it out yonder and faith chooses
[1:58:01] that regardless of what the present
[1:58:04] tense says here.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Faith chooses that
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; out there.
[1:58:13] Hallelujah.
[1:58:15] If I look just
[1:58:17] right around us and if you looked right
[1:58:20] around us, that wouldn't give us the
[1:58:22] inspiration to press on the upward way.
[1:58:28] We have a guiding light guiding us. And
[1:58:31] I want the musicians to come. And while
[1:58:33] they're coming, if you'll bow your head
[1:58:35] with me.
[1:58:38] Oh, how
[1:58:41] Father, you're so gracious to us. and
[1:58:46] for this uh evening Lord this Wednesday
[1:58:48] evening as we have spoken and touched on
[1:58:53] just briefly as briefly as it was on the
[1:58:57] future the people the future of their
[1:58:59] homes the future their lives the future
[1:59:02] of these young people the future oh God
[1:59:04] that you have planned and programmed for
[1:59:07] us the future of what is to take place
[1:59:10] in the earth and oh God whether it's
[1:59:14] good times or bad times
[1:59:16] Whether it is uh uh whether it is joyful
[1:59:18] times or times of sorrow, we do not
[1:59:20] know. But we say, "I am thine, O Lord,
[1:59:23] and I've heard thy voice and I've give
[1:59:25] myself entirely to you." In the name of
[1:59:29] Jesus Christ, I ask that these words
[1:59:31] will linger long in the hearts of the
[1:59:33] people. It's been spoken for that
[1:59:35] purpose. And we thank you now in Jesus
[1:59:39] name. Amen.
[1:59:42] Now, just before we come to a close,
[1:59:48] I'm sure there's maybe any one of our
[1:59:51] young men here that would if I said,
[1:59:54] "Would you like to be Peter?" Apostle
[1:59:56] Peter. You think about Peter? Or if I
[1:59:59] said, "Would you like to be Apostle
[2:00:00] Paul?" Oh my. If I could just be Apostle
[2:00:05] Paul. If I could just be Peter.
[2:00:08] Well, those are two that I chose. Jesus
[2:00:11] told the fortune of both of them the
[2:00:13] future.
[2:00:16] And he says to Peter, "When you were
[2:00:19] young, you just went wherever you wanted
[2:00:22] to go.
[2:00:24] When you're old,"
[2:00:26] so he knew just from that statement, he
[2:00:28] was going to get to be old.
[2:00:31] When you're old,
[2:00:33] they'll carry you where you would not
[2:00:36] want to go.
[2:00:38] So he knew that something was going to
[2:00:40] take place with them and tradition says
[2:00:43] brother Brham also confirms it that they
[2:00:47] crucif he said they didn't want to be
[2:00:48] crucified the way his wife his way his
[2:00:51] lord was crucified and so they crucified
[2:00:53] him upside down
[2:00:56] but that was his future and can you just
[2:00:59] imagine can you imagine now living every
[2:01:01] day of his life
[2:01:05] I got this in my future here. When I was
[2:01:08] young, I just went wherever I wanted to
[2:01:10] go. I went with all my friends. I did I
[2:01:13] did I went fishing. I did all of these
[2:01:14] things when I was young. What I have in
[2:01:17] my future is they're going to take me.
[2:01:20] Somebody's going to pack me where I
[2:01:22] don't want to go.
[2:01:24] But that is what Jesus said. And so, you
[2:01:27] know what? My if he made here's my whole
[2:01:30] service. If he made Jesus Christ the
[2:01:33] center of his life, then he could say,
[2:01:36] "Somebody's going to take me where I
[2:01:38] don't want to go, but yet I want to go
[2:01:40] there because he said I was going to go
[2:01:42] there."
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul, he's blind. He's just
[2:01:50] been smitten down by this great light.
[2:01:52] Who art thou, Lord? I'm Jesus, whom thou
[2:01:55] persecutest. It's hard for thee to kick
[2:01:57] against the pricks.
[2:02:00] and they send him into the into the city
[2:02:03] and God speaks to Ananas that he comes
[2:02:08] and pray for him and says, "Show him. I
[2:02:12] will show him what great things he will
[2:02:14] suffer for me." Those are two things.
[2:02:17] We're we're not in a real suffering age.
[2:02:20] We uh it's not an age that's really uh
[2:02:24] dedicated to that. But I believe that
[2:02:26] the believers of this message are going
[2:02:29] to have greater squeezes yet.
[2:02:32] We have plenty of squeezes now, but we
[2:02:34] going to have more squeezes yet. Do you
[2:02:36] know that what you believe, what you
[2:02:39] believe deep down in your heart and
[2:02:41] what's written in this word of God and
[2:02:43] written in this message is so foreign to
[2:02:46] this age. It is absolutely foreign
[2:02:48] language to this age. And the position
[2:02:51] that you have on things is considered
[2:02:53] abs. In fact, his brother Donaldson was
[2:02:55] just telling me he said, "You know this
[2:02:57] message?" He said, "Uhuh, I was called
[2:03:00] by a minister
[2:03:02] when we talked about how ladies live and
[2:03:04] how women of the message dress." You
[2:03:07] know what the pastor said? He said, "You
[2:03:09] people are idiots."
[2:03:11] That's really what people think. They
[2:03:14] think they think it's very, very
[2:03:16] strange. They think it's absolutely
[2:03:18] strange. They think it's wild.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; They think it's insane. True.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; In fact, it's just turned completely
[2:03:25] around because the insanity is on the
[2:03:28] streets. And here, can you imagine that
[2:03:30] people with such nakedness and such
[2:03:33] debauchery and such sin that's taking
[2:03:35] place and murders and rape and all of
[2:03:38] these things and turn around and look at
[2:03:39] believers and say, "You're crazy."
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; How the things turn from that which is
[2:03:44] clean completely to the unclean.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; And that which is clean, they call
[2:03:48] unclean. That which is unclean they call
[2:03:51] clean. That which is unclean they call
[2:03:53] normal.
[2:03:56] We live in a very abnormal age and this
[2:03:58] is not a this is not a negative message
[2:04:00] but that happens to be the reality. And
[2:04:02] so I'm talking to you about your future
[2:04:05] and it is going to intensify.
[2:04:08] If this would be the last message I'd
[2:04:10] preach, you'll recall this service and
[2:04:13] you'll say that's exactly right. We've
[2:04:15] been told that well you we kind of
[2:04:17] believed it but I feel I need to enforce
[2:04:19] it so that we don't have some euphoria
[2:04:22] euphoria you know about uh how things
[2:04:26] are going to be you know it may not be
[2:04:28] that way at all it may not just be an
[2:04:31] easy street at all it may be very very
[2:04:33] difficult times that we enter into but I
[2:04:36] say whatever it is if we've made Christ
[2:04:39] the center then then you're going to
[2:04:42] have good success.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Glory.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to sing uh Sister
[2:04:48] Elizabeth, I want to sing beautiful Star
[2:04:51] of Bethlehem.
[2:04:54] I don't have the a number. There we are.
[2:04:59] Giving a light,
[2:05:01] guiding the wise men on their way and
[2:05:04] are guiding wise men and wise ladies
[2:05:07] today. Wise believers. Let's stand,
[2:05:09] shall we?
[2:05:16] [Music]
[2:05:21] Beautiful star of Bethlehem,
[2:05:25] shining a far through shadows dim,
[2:05:30] giving a light for those who long have
[2:05:36] gone,
[2:05:39] guiding the wise. wise men on their way
[2:05:44] out to the place where Jesus lay. Oh
[2:05:49] beautiful star of Bethlehem,
[2:05:53] shine on.
[2:05:58] Beautiful star
[2:06:00] [Music]
[2:06:02] of Bethlehem,
[2:06:07] shine upon us until the glory
[2:06:13] dawn.
[2:06:16] Give us thy light to light our way unto
[2:06:22] the land. A perfect day. Beautiful star
[2:06:28] of Bethlehem,
[2:06:30] shine on.
[2:06:34] The theme of this song is that this
[2:06:36] light guides us. The theme of my message
[2:06:38] and the theme of my life and the theme
[2:06:40] of my testimony is this light
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; has guided me.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; And if it's brought us this far,
[2:06:47] friends, it'll take us straight through.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; That is your future. Hallelujah.
[2:06:52] Beautiful
[2:06:55] star, the hope of life, guiding the
[2:07:00] pilgrims through these pilgrims over the
[2:07:05] mountain until the break of dawn
[2:07:13] into the light of perfect day. It will
[2:07:18] give out a lovely way. Oh beautiful star
[2:07:23] of Bethlehem.
[2:07:30] Oh beautiful star
[2:07:35] of the hair
[2:07:39] shine upon us until the glory
[2:07:45] go
[2:07:48] and give us thy light to light our way
[2:07:52] unto the land a perfect day. Oh
[2:07:57] beautiful star Bethlehem
[2:08:01] shine on.
[2:08:06] Oh beautiful star, the hope of rest for
[2:08:11] the red
[2:08:16] glory when the ground is
[2:08:24] Jesus is now star
[2:08:28] brighter and brighter. He will shine.
[2:08:32] Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem.
[2:08:37] Shine on.
[2:08:39] Oh, shine on beautiful star.
[2:08:50] I am
[2:08:53] the glory
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:02] of
[2:09:04] the land of perfect day. Beautiful star
[2:09:10] [Music]
[2:09:12] shine on.
[2:09:15] I love the words of that third verse. Oh
[2:09:18] beautiful star, the hope of the hope of
[2:09:20] rest for the for the redeemed, the good
[2:09:25] and the blessed. Yonder in glory when
[2:09:29] the crown is given. I don't know. I'm
[2:09:33] really not interested in a a physical
[2:09:35] crown.
[2:09:38] The crown and the only crown I'm
[2:09:40] interested in. I just want to hear it'll
[2:09:43] be a crown to my head just to hear. Well
[2:09:46] done.
[2:09:47] Enter in. That's all I want to hear.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Well done.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Enter in.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. Think of it.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be worth an entire lifetime
[2:09:59] of future for that kind of a future?
[2:10:03] Brother West Nygard, I'm going to have
[2:10:05] you come up and pray a prayer over the
[2:10:06] people. Would you please when we come to
[2:10:08] the end of this chorus and song,
[2:10:14] here's your future.
[2:10:17] Oh, beautiful star, the hope of blessed
[2:10:22] for the redeemed good and blessed.
[2:10:26] Yonder in glory when the crown is one.
[2:10:35] Jesus is now a staring light. Brighter
[2:10:40] and brighter. He will shine. Beautiful
[2:10:44] star
[2:10:48] shine on. Oh, worship him now. Beautiful
[2:10:53] star.
[2:10:57] [Music]
[2:11:02] Beautiful
[2:11:06] life.
[2:11:08] [Music]
[2:11:16] Oh day
[2:11:19] star
[2:11:22] shine once more of course. Oh, beautiful
[2:11:27] star.
[2:11:32] All your presence dear Lord.
[2:11:45] I will fly away
[2:11:50] perfect day.
[2:11:57] [Music]
[2:12:00] As our brother Nygard comes to pray,
[2:12:05] I would ask that each of us and each of
[2:12:07] you pray this prayer while he prays.
[2:12:12] Lord Jesus,
[2:12:14] be the center of my life throughout my
[2:12:19] entire future.
[2:12:22] Be the very hub that all the spokes are
[2:12:26] attached to.
[2:12:28] Be everything in my future and guide me
[2:12:33] because I don't know what it is, but you
[2:12:36] know it. The beginning from the end.
[2:12:38] Brother West, please.
[2:12:41] [Music]
[2:12:44] I bless you, brother Wes. Amen.
[2:12:46] [Music]
[2:12:52] Gracious heavenly father,
[2:12:54] we are indeed the most blessed people on
[2:12:57] this earth. Father,
[2:12:59] Lord God, you've given us another time
[2:13:02] to gather together with our brothers and
[2:13:04] sisters, Lord God, around your word,
[2:13:06] Father.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Lord God, you must love us so
[2:13:10] much.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, time upon time upon
[2:13:14] time upon time, we've come here with
[2:13:16] thoughts upon our heart, upon our mind,
[2:13:18] Lord God, and your Holy Spirit has gone
[2:13:21] forth and just preached to each one of
[2:13:23] us individually, Lord God.
[2:13:26] Lord God,
[2:13:28] the evil one, Lord God, would love to
[2:13:30] get our eyes off of you, Lord, but
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; his ws have been uncovered, Lord God.
[2:13:38] Father God, you've given your army, your
[2:13:41] soldiers, Lord God, the weapons that we
[2:13:43] need, Father, to fight the enemy, Lord
[2:13:45] God. Father God, you've given us a
[2:13:48] yielded vessel in our pastor, Lord God.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Father, he knows what we have need of.
[2:13:52] You know what we have need of. You laid
[2:13:54] it upon his heart, Lord God. You set the
[2:13:56] man to the side. Your Holy Spirit has
[2:13:58] given him uncction, Lord God. And
[2:14:00] Father, we've heard, we've received,
[2:14:02] Father, and now we want to manifest what
[2:14:03] we've heard, Lord. Tomorrow morning,
[2:14:06] Lord God, tomorrow Satan's going to hit
[2:14:07] us between the eyes, Lord God. He's
[2:14:09] going to want to take our mind upon off
[2:14:11] the word that we've heard, Father. Lord
[2:14:13] God, with laser beam accuracy, Lord,
[2:14:16] Father, while it's all dropping down
[2:14:18] around us, may we keep our eye upon you,
[2:14:20] Father, upon the goal, Lord God. Father,
[2:14:23] as we're going down the road, it's just
[2:14:24] telephone poles along the side, but
[2:14:26] Father, keep us upon the road, the
[2:14:28] straight and narrow road, Lord God.
[2:14:30] Father, may we go tomorrow, Father, with
[2:14:33] you upon our mind, with you in our
[2:14:35] hearts, Father God, knowing that you're
[2:14:37] leading, that you're guiding, that
[2:14:39] you're guarding our every footstep,
[2:14:40] Father, you've been so wonderful, Lord
[2:14:42] God, to give us the word, Father. So
[2:14:45] much word, like so much good food.
[2:14:46] Father, the food drives us. But Lord
[2:14:49] God, your food is eternal life unto us,
[2:14:51] Lord God. your word, Father, as he
[2:14:53] strikes us tomorrow or whenever it might
[2:14:55] happen to be, Father, may that word that
[2:14:57] you've given to us in so many times that
[2:15:00] we've been in through these doors, Lord,
[2:15:02] the word that you've laid upon our
[2:15:03] heart, Lord, let us drop from our mind
[2:15:05] to our soul to be manifested, Lord God,
[2:15:08] let it be lived out through us, Father.
[2:15:11] Lord God,
[2:15:12] may our lives be a living testimony for
[2:15:15] you, Lord God. Yielded vessels for you,
[2:15:18] Father. Lord God, we thank you for the
[2:15:21] word that you've given us tonight, Lord.
[2:15:23] Father, we just don't want it to go in
[2:15:25] our ears and be gone. Father, we want to
[2:15:28] live it. We want to manifest it. We want
[2:15:30] to be it. We want to be sons and
[2:15:32] daughters in whom you're pleased to
[2:15:34] dwell in. Father, that's our desire. And
[2:15:37] like brother Derek said, Father,
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; we want to be
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; that picture that you have of us that
[2:15:44] was painted. We will be what you want us
[2:15:47] to be, Father. yielded vessels, yielded
[2:15:50] children of yours, Father. Lord God, now
[2:15:52] as we leave this place, Father, we ask
[2:15:55] that you go with us, Father. Each and
[2:15:56] every one of us, Lord, be with us in a
[2:15:59] special way, Father. May we go praying,
[2:16:01] Father, getting ourselves prepared for
[2:16:04] Sunday morning. Yes. Sunday evening,
[2:16:05] Lord God, praying for whoever delivers
[2:16:07] the word, Lord God, coming in
[2:16:09] anticipation, Father. We've just seen
[2:16:11] your word coming forth greater and
[2:16:13] greater and greater, Lord God, not only
[2:16:15] in the word coming forth, but Lord God,
[2:16:17] your word being made manifest in our
[2:16:19] lives, Father. Lord God, now we just
[2:16:21] take and turn everything over into your
[2:16:23] hands again, asking that you would go
[2:16:25] with us in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:16:27] Amen.
[2:16:29] Dear brother Wes, I say God bless you
[2:16:32] and may the life of Jesus Christ be seen
[2:16:35] in you by all that is around you, all
[2:16:39] that are near you. I pray that he'll be
[2:16:42] visible. He will be heard. He will be
[2:16:44] seen. And he'll do what he always did.
[2:16:46] Stir up the people.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; You're dismissed in Jesus name. We'll
[2:16:52] see you Sunday morning if not before.
[2:16:54] God bless you.
[2:16:57] Amen. God bless you, brother John.
