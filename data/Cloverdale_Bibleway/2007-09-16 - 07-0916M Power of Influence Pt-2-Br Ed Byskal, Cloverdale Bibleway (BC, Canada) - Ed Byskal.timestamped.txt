[1:09] Amen.
[1:13] [Music]
[1:16] Amen. We're here to praise the Lord this
[1:19] morning. Worship him. Amen. And uh I
[1:23] don't know what's happened this week or
[1:25] what you're looking forward to today.
[1:27] You might be like me and not sure how
[1:29] you're going to get through the next day
[1:30] or two because you got so much stuff
[1:32] going on. And uh it happens to us
[1:35] sometimes. But we want to take some time
[1:37] aside and worship God.
[1:39] And um I heard something this uh this
[1:43] week
[1:44] um someone was talking about grace
[1:48] and they said I thought it was one of
[1:51] the best analogies I ever heard. Said
[1:53] grace is described as the unmmerited
[1:56] favor of God which is kind of like
[1:59] saying that atomic bomb is something
[2:01] that blows things up.
[2:03] It's correct,
[2:05] but it's so much more deeper than that.
[2:08] Amen. And we're here this morning
[2:10] because of God's grace. When you think
[2:14] that God that created everything in the
[2:16] universe, amen, spoke worlds into
[2:19] existence and you start thinking about
[2:21] how vast the universe is, but he's
[2:24] interested in you this morning. Amen.
[2:27] That's grace. Let's stand this morning.
[2:29] We sing it together. Grace, grace, God's
[2:31] grace. number 476 on the screen.
[2:40] Oh, marvelous
[2:42] grace of our loving
[2:46] Lord.
[2:49] Grace that exceeds
[2:52] our sin and our king.

[18:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord. I'm
[18:24] going to ask our brother John Andy's,
[18:25] brother John, if you'd come and open the
[18:27] service in a word of prayer. Amen. If
[18:29] you've got a need this morning,
[18:32] we've got a God here this morning who's
[18:34] able to answer that need. and meet it.
[18:36] If you're listening in on the internet
[18:37] or in the phone hookup, amen, God is as
[18:41] close to you there as he is here. Amen.
[18:45] Fills all time and space. He knows your
[18:47] need. Amen. Even before you ask. So if
[18:50] you've got a need this morning, just
[18:51] stretch out your hand to him. Amen. And
[18:54] I believe, man, if we agree together,
[18:57] God will come on the scene and meet that
[18:59] need. Brother John.
[19:04] Father, we're here to worship you this
[19:06] morning, God. Lord, we're here to get in
[19:08] the spirit of worship, Lord, as your
[19:10] children. Lord, we've gone through this
[19:13] week, Lord, of work and school and
[19:15] living in this leodyian life, but Lord,
[19:18] we've come into your house. And this is
[19:21] a house of praise. This is a house of
[19:23] prayer. This is a house of dedication.
[19:26] This is a house that we can get out of
[19:28] ourselves and come in a spirit of
[19:30] worship. Come into the spirit of the
[19:32] word. Come into the spirit of Christ.
[19:35] Come into this place where angels are
[19:37] here. Lord, I believe you want to do
[19:39] more for us than we are even than we
[19:42] even understand with our mortal minds
[19:45] more than what we could even grasp.
[19:47] Lord, I just feel your spirit of faith
[19:49] as wanting to pulsate by your word
[19:52] within souls of men and women to know
[19:55] that we are not just mortal flesh, but
[19:58] we are sons and daughters of God. Lord,
[20:01] let that faith rise up in a people. Let
[20:04] that manifestation, God, of who we are
[20:07] come to life. Be it may it be quickened
[20:10] this morning, God. And Lord, we don't
[20:12] know the needs of your people fully.
[20:15] Some might have gone through a battle,
[20:17] through a trial, and they're here to
[20:19] give you praise and here to give you
[20:21] thanksgiving. Some might be ready to go
[20:24] into a tremendous season, Lord, of of
[20:27] difficulty or a test that you have
[20:29] allowed. Some might be right in the
[20:32] middle, Lord, of a of a of a time of
[20:34] great decision or turmoil or sickness.
[20:38] But Lord, I pray that we would be as
[20:39] Job, Lord, in the midst of his trial,
[20:42] that you'd drop down inspiration and
[20:45] dropped down a revelation. I know my
[20:48] redeemer liveth. And we believe our
[20:50] healer is in the building. this morning.
[20:52] God, we believe the deliverer is here
[20:55] with arms stretched out open. Lord, we
[20:58] believe our husband is here. All that we
[21:01] have need of. Lord, I pray that as
[21:03] you've already given us your word and
[21:06] distributed power to the church, that
[21:08] our faith would be energized to believe
[21:11] for the impossible. What doctors say is
[21:14] impossible. What men of this world would
[21:17] say and women and even our mortal minds
[21:19] can't put it together. But your word is
[21:22] true and your word is our light and it's
[21:25] a light into our pathway and we're
[21:27] taking your word on the matter this
[21:29] morning. So may there be pulsations of
[21:32] faith throughout this service that
[21:35] brothers and sisters would be delivered
[21:38] while they yet hear the word that
[21:40] healing would visit this address this
[21:42] morning God.
[21:44] Oh father, we need you, Lord. And our
[21:47] hearts are lifted up. As our brother Rod
[21:49] said, just reach out your hand, Lord.
[21:53] Both my hands are lifted up, Lord. We
[21:55] desire you to come to this house, to
[21:58] these lives of ours, and consume these
[22:01] sacrifices. We're hungry. We're thirsty
[22:05] to see the supernatural upon us, upon
[22:08] our brothers, upon our sisters, upon the
[22:12] body, upon the family, God. And I pray
[22:15] that chains, Lord, that are even now
[22:18] maybe being tried to be clasped on to
[22:21] the souls of your children, that they
[22:23] would be loose this morning. that as our
[22:25] pastor comes and as our brother Rod
[22:27] leads us into worship and as we sing and
[22:30] hear songs that there would be a great
[22:32] unified faith that you are in control
[22:36] that you are more than able that you are
[22:39] present and that you are near to
[22:42] influence us. Oh God, take us away. Oh
[22:46] God, take us into that other dimension.
[22:49] Take us beyond this flesh. God, we
[22:52] believe all things are possible and we
[22:55] are waiting for you to manifest it
[22:57] within this dimension, God, to change
[23:00] these atoms and whatever you see fit
[23:04] until that time for us to go through.
[23:08] May you give us the character and the
[23:10] surrendering and the yieldedness to let
[23:13] you have your way. Lord, we believe that
[23:16] you know your mind concerning us. But
[23:19] when you speak it and make it known, our
[23:22] hearts are ready and we are willing to
[23:25] do whatever you say. Lord, let that not
[23:27] come from our lips, but from the lives
[23:30] that are totally surrendered, totally
[23:33] yielded and you would have preeminence
[23:35] today. Bless our pastor, Lord. Bless
[23:38] those that are hurting. Our brother Ron
[23:40] Spencer, brother Matthew Spencer. May
[23:42] you bring a healing and a miracle into
[23:44] that situation. Our brother uh Murphy
[23:47] Wong and Sister Tracy, Lord, those that
[23:50] are out on the field, those that are
[23:51] laboring in the vineyard, the Seattle
[23:53] service this afternoon, Lord, may you
[23:56] pulsate within your people around the
[23:58] world. This great supernatural work that
[24:01] you are climaxing within our lives,
[24:04] Father, be manifested today in Jesus
[24:08] name. and we give you thanks for what
[24:10] you're doing.
[24:12] Amen.
[24:16] Amen.
[24:18] [Music]
[24:20] And you can have your seats.
[24:30] Our brother John Briner has a special
[24:32] for us this morning. Brother John, if
[24:33] you'd come and get ready. Um,
[24:37] we got is a video clip ready?
[24:41] You can play it anytime.
[24:44] Well, we'll just maybe welcome and then
[24:46] uh just before brother John special,
[24:47] we'll play this little video clip I
[24:48] wanted to play this morning. Um, we want
[24:51] to welcome all those who are visiting
[24:53] with us in the church here.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Come out of the state.
[24:58] The reason I say that the angel of the
[25:00] Lord's only gifted people should believe
[25:01] you. If they won't believe you, then
[25:04] you'll know the very secrets of their
[25:05] heart and they'll have to believe it.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; I broke my neck while I was bouncing my
[25:09] family.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; I started having seizures. I had flesh
[25:12] eating disease.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; The Lord totally touched me. Now I'm
[25:16] 100%.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus healed me and I have
[25:18] absolutely 100% use of all my body.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Your faith has healed you, brother. Go
[25:24] home. Jesus Christ makes you well.
[25:33] [Music]
[25:37] Jesus Christ will bring it to you if you
[25:41] will only believe.
[25:47] The website's finished.
[26:00] It is up. It is public. And that trailer
[26:05] you just saw is on YouTube.
[26:08] Uh I put it up on Friday and by noon
[26:13] yesterday, 70 people had already looked
[26:15] at it and uh we just want to get the
[26:18] last one in. Amen. And uh so uh you know
[26:23] uh go ahead take a look at it. Um the uh
[26:28] the site has now changed. So when you go
[26:30] into it, you will now get a screen which
[26:33] gives you two choices. One is the
[26:35] introduction which gives you the website
[26:38] that you'd seen before which goes
[26:40] through about a half an hour
[26:41] presentation on the message. There's now
[26:44] a link that says main site. And if you
[26:47] go into that main site, you will see the
[26:49] results of what Jeremy has been working
[26:51] on for the past six months. And we want
[26:54] to thank everyone who has helped. And
[26:56] there's too many to mention now, but uh
[26:59] there's a few that have been a real
[27:00] help. You know who you are. And we just
[27:02] really appreciate God knows who you are.
[27:04] And uh so um take a look at it and uh
[27:09] you can start
[27:11] uh continue to give out the cards. I
[27:13] will say if you do need to give out
[27:15] cards, go ahead and get cards printed on
[27:18] your own. Some people like to sit back
[27:20] and wait for other people to do stuff
[27:21] for us. Well, what what we did is we got
[27:24] uh initially brother James and Jeremy
[27:26] James Rosac up in Edmonton. He went and
[27:28] got uh we got 10,000 cards printed up.
[27:32] They lasted
[27:34] uh about a month before we give it give
[27:38] them out to everybody. They took out
[27:39] they took uh I don't know how many uh
[27:41] 5,000 7,000 to the men's meeting in uh
[27:45] in back east in West Virginia and gave
[27:47] them all out. But there is a a website
[27:50] believethe.org.
[27:52] If you go on there, you can download
[27:55] uh and this is particularly for those
[27:57] listening in on the internet. You can
[27:59] download a file which you can take to a
[28:02] printer and they can print in color as
[28:06] many cards as you want and it's pretty
[28:08] cheap to get cards printed out. So, uh,
[28:11] if you do that, make sure whoever's
[28:13] printing them runs off one or two copies
[28:15] so you can see it. Make sure the colors
[28:17] are right. Um, which is the advice we
[28:19] got from brother James Rosac. But you
[28:21] can go out and get your own cards
[28:22] printed. If you're listening in on the
[28:24] internet, you can just go on to this
[28:26] website, believethe.org, or download uh
[28:29] the file. Um it's an EPS file and you
[28:32] can uh download it and get the uh get
[28:35] the uh cards printed up and give out as
[28:38] many as you want. Amen. We want to get
[28:40] the last one in. Amen.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Brother John.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the sign this morning?
[28:49] Um the words to this song were um
[28:51] inspired to me during brother Tom's
[28:53] service last Sunday morning as he was
[28:55] preaching about the unconditional blood
[28:57] covenant.
[28:59] And as he I was nearing the end of this
[29:01] of his service and he was speaking about
[29:02] the blood I started thinking a little
[29:04] bit about the power of the blood in our
[29:07] own lives and the even as brother Ed has
[29:09] been speaking out the power of influence
[29:10] it holds over our actions and over our
[29:13] lives. And just as I sing this morning,
[29:16] just feel free to maybe uh enter in and
[29:19] remember back to the moment in the place
[29:20] when that when his blood first cleans
[29:24] your sins when he first revealed to you
[29:26] that unconditional covenant that he
[29:28] made.
[29:40] [Music]
[29:50] I remember the moment,
[29:54] Lord. I remember the place
[29:58] you lifted the veil from my heart. You
[30:03] showed me your face.
[30:05] [Music]
[30:07] and oh unforgiveness
[30:10] [Music]
[30:11] an expression of your love.
[30:15] So I won't forget your mercy.
[30:19] Lord I'll remember the blood
[30:24] cuz I remember the blood
[30:28] and I remember your grace
[30:32] when you reach through the darkness.
[30:36] Lord, I knew I was safe.
[30:41] And I saw your love
[30:44] flowing down like a fountain.
[30:49] You saved me by mercy. You gave me your
[30:52] love. I remember.
[30:55] [Music]
[31:03] [Music]
[31:14] Lord, you gave me your covenant,
[31:18] a promise so true.
[31:22] It's your word unconditional.
[31:26] Oh, it binds me to you.
[31:30] And there is a token
[31:34] you've applied to my soul.
[31:38] So I will remember.
[31:42] Oh, wherever I go.
[31:47] Cuz I remember the blood.
[31:51] Lord, I remember your grace
[31:55] when you reach through the darkness.
[31:59] Oh Lord, I knew I was saved.
[32:02] [Music]
[32:03] And you gave me your love
[32:07] flowing down like a fountain.
[32:11] You save me by mercy. You gave me your
[32:15] love. I remember the blood.
[32:19] Cuz Lord, your blood
[32:23] will never lose its power.
[32:26] [Music]
[32:28] No, never.
[32:30] [Music]
[32:32] Oh, no, never.
[32:36] For I know that your blood
[32:39] atones for my sin forever.
[32:44] And it will never
[32:47] it will never lose its power.
[32:52] Cuz I remember the blood,
[32:55] Lord. I remember your grace
[33:00] when you reached through the darkness.
[33:04] Lord, I knew I was saved.
[33:08] And I saw your love
[33:12] flowing down like a fountain.
[33:16] You save me by mercy. You gave me your
[33:19] love. I remember the blood.
[33:24] For I remember the blood
[33:28] and I remember your grace
[33:32] when you reached through the darkness.
[33:36] Lord, I knew I was saved
[33:40] and I saw your love
[33:44] flowing down like a fountain.
[33:48] You gave me your mercy. You saved me my
[33:51] love. I remember the blood.
[33:56] [Music]
[34:24] John. Amen. Going to want to hear that
[34:27] one again.
[34:30] Praise God.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; We're going to be turning the word at
[34:34] this time. Uh we've got one announcement
[34:36] which I forgot to make. Um just a
[34:39] reminder that the wedding of Brother
[34:40] Kyle Kemper and Sister Sharon Gabriel
[34:43] will be held this Saturday, September
[34:45] 22nd at 10:30 a.m. sharp.
[34:50] Sister Sharon says, "This will be a
[34:52] first. It will happen on time." So, I'm
[34:55] going to hold her to that. It has never
[34:58] ever happened to date in the history of
[35:01] this church that a wedding has started
[35:03] on time. But Sharon said, Sister Sharon
[35:05] said, "This will be a first and it will
[35:07] happen on time." So, those who would
[35:08] like to attend the ceremony, uh, it's
[35:10] going to be here 10:30 a.m. on Saturday.
[35:13] We'll be praying but we'll have a use
[35:16] this as an opportunity to speak to

[37:51] [Applause]
[37:56] Amen.
[37:58] Praise the Lord.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; He hears us when we call.
[38:04] And I can tell you what God's prophet
[38:06] said. He comes every time he's invited.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[38:14] &gt;&gt; If we really believe it, all we need to
[38:16] do is invite him.
[38:18] Invite him and he'll be here. We know
[38:22] that he is here. It's that it's us that
[38:24] has to get in tune. And that's why we're
[38:26] worshiping so we can be in tune. Amen.
[38:30] It's wonderful. Well, we announced one a
[38:33] wedding this coming Saturday. And we
[38:37] we'll be announcing another one just
[38:39] now. And that's our brother Toby
[38:41] Cailloui right here and sister Rebecca
[38:45] Cassanji
[38:47] uh somewhere in the audience.
[38:51] They would like to announce their
[38:53] wedding on October the 27th.
[38:56] That'll be a Saturday as well, October
[38:58] the 27th. and here at the church. It'll
[39:02] be at 1 100 1:00 p.m.
[39:05] Uh, and let's just be praying if you
[39:08] would for this young couple. We're
[39:11] praying that God will arrange that the
[39:14] visas, the necessary visas for relatives
[39:18] and parents will be in place and they
[39:21] will be able to arrive, excuse me,
[39:24] arrive and be here at that time.
[39:28] And I want our brother Toby's father,
[39:32] brother Caillou, who's a pastor in uh
[39:35] pastor's a really a handsome
[39:38] congregation of people. I say handsome
[39:40] because they're lovely people. And uh I
[39:43] know that when I was there about 3 4
[39:45] years ago, there was 2,000 people at
[39:47] that time just packing the place to
[39:50] capacity. And uh and and and they have
[39:54] respect. The people have respect. The
[39:56] city has respect. city of a million
[39:58] people. For those of you that don't
[39:59] know, the television, two television
[40:03] crews were there. I had had no knowledge
[40:06] of it except I saw these people walking
[40:08] around. I thought they were church
[40:10] people and uh then they televised the
[40:13] whole service, had it on prime time that
[40:17] very night
[40:19] and played it for one month.
[40:22] for one month in that city of Amujaya
[40:27] and there were people so affected
[40:30] uh I think that it's just you know God
[40:32] honoring their respect for the word of
[40:35] God which I will be speaking on uh in a
[40:39] few moments.
[40:41] Uh next Sunday we were we are going to
[40:44] have an evening service and uh it's you
[40:48] want to be careful now for the time. The
[40:50] time will be at 4:00 because we want to
[40:53] have communion and uh footwashing.
[40:57] We don't want it to be rushed and yet we
[40:59] want the people to have time if they are
[41:02] traveling some distance and those that
[41:05] might be streaming that may be in the
[41:06] Okonogan or in Eastern Washington or
[41:09] wherever that they'll have time and
[41:12] those from Seattle quite often come up
[41:15] uh as many as can.
[41:18] We need a lots of time because we have a
[41:20] lot of people and we want to be able to
[41:24] accommodate everyone and we don't want
[41:26] to rush this wonderful service.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Uh I I actually I actually felt very
[41:35] very directed. I don't know what God
[41:37] wants to do, but I can tell you that
[41:39] there's healing
[41:41] at a communion time. There's washing at
[41:44] a communion time.
[41:46] And uh so may God give us a very very
[41:49] gracious time. Make sure that none of
[41:53] your believer family miss the service.
[41:57] And if Satan tries to put one over on
[42:00] you and say, "Well, you're not really
[42:04] worthy and you didn't have a very good
[42:05] week and you had a bad day and you did
[42:07] something da da da." Just get it out of
[42:10] the way
[42:11] &gt;&gt; and be here.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. because we need we need these very
[42:16] special times.
[42:18] I I also uh saw the little clip that
[42:22] Brother Rod just showed of Brother
[42:24] Jeremy's work and a very very long time
[42:27] ago we were up at uh Brother Jeremy and
[42:31] Sister Joanna's place. That's even some
[42:33] years ago. I could see then there was a
[42:37] in incredible desire within him to uh
[42:41] set something out that was be so factual
[42:45] that you can't get around it. And I
[42:47] think they've done an excellent job. And
[42:50] so for brother Jeremy and all the team
[42:52] that worked with them, I personally want
[42:54] to also thank you. I think that it's
[42:57] uh I I think that it's really
[42:59] spectacular and I believe that God will
[43:02] reward all who labored. And after all,
[43:06] we're we're just everybody's doing what
[43:08] their part. We're doing what we can.
[43:11] That's all we're required to do. If
[43:13] you're a mother working in the home,
[43:15] that's your call. You Matthew, Mark,
[43:17] Luke, John, mother.
[43:20] I wish they said I actually would have
[43:22] liked to have heard him say Matthew,
[43:24] Mark, Luke, John, father, but he said
[43:26] mother. So, so I have to say mother. God
[43:29] bless all the mothers.
[43:31] Amen.
[43:36] Brother Tom is ministering in
[43:38] Saskatchewan and they'll probably soon
[43:41] be completing finishing their services
[43:43] as they're an hour ahead.
[43:46] and uh he's replacing uh taking brother
[43:49] Ron Spencer's place and I don't know I
[43:53] didn't hear all the comments at the
[43:54] first the service but I would like this
[43:56] congregation I have assured sister
[43:58] Connie
[44:00] and and others that we would be praying
[44:03] as a congregation I don't mean just you
[44:06] know a one minute a few words I I'm I'm
[44:10] talking about prayer
[44:11] &gt;&gt; amen
[44:12] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about getting into prayer
[44:14] and just getting into the spirit of
[44:16] prayer and praying for our brother Ron
[44:19] Spencer. He needs our prayers. And so we
[44:23] want to be praying and believing for an
[44:27] answer.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Our God is the God who gave us every
[44:31] cell in our body.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Our God is the God who put all the
[44:36] chemistry there.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; And Jesus has already paid for it. And
[44:41] brother Brandham said many times, "God
[44:44] can't heal us. He's already done it.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; He's already done it. And so we just we
[44:50] we don't ask questions why things
[44:52] happen, why it's this way. It's up to us
[44:56] as to believe and be believers. Amen.
[45:00] That's that's what we're required to do.
[45:05] Pray also if you would please uh for the
[45:08] trustees from from week to week and from
[45:11] meeting to meeting. A great deal goes on
[45:14] and a great deal of time is required by
[45:17] uh others who are involved with the
[45:20] Lord's work
[45:22] and the trustees are putting in a lot of
[45:24] time right now with regards to a number
[45:26] of things with regards to camp with
[45:29] regards to missions and overseas work
[45:32] and uh we're laboring we're we're we're
[45:35] just laboring and we want to labor in
[45:36] the vineyard labor for the master from
[45:39] the dawn till setting sun because we
[45:41] don't know how much time we have. So, we
[45:44] just everyone wants to do our best and
[45:46] the trustees have a little certainly
[45:48] have a a good deal extra right now to
[45:51] consider while we're working through all
[45:54] the hoops and the details of of the
[45:56] camp. And uh we just want the we want
[45:59] the perfect will of God. Everything
[46:02] seems to be moving along in a positive
[46:04] direction, but we uh we have some work
[46:07] to do. We don't have a lot of time to do
[46:10] it in. And so we need divine wisdom. We
[46:13] need the gift of wisdom. And I believe
[46:15] God has given us that.
[46:19] I'll have you stand. We have sung and we
[46:23] have prayed.
[46:26] And I think I'd just like to uh sing.
[46:29] We're standing on holy ground.
[46:33] [Music]
[46:38] Heat.
[46:39] [Music]
[46:43] Heat.
[46:51] [Applause]
[46:52] [Music]
[46:53] Heat.
[46:58] Heat.
[47:01] [Music]
[47:16] For we are standing
[47:20] in his presence
[47:23] on
[47:25] the earth.
[47:27] [Music]
[47:29] Our gracious and loving heavenly father,
[47:33] we believe that you have sent not only
[47:37] your presence, the holy spirit
[47:41] but angels of God
[47:44] uh around your inheritance around your
[47:47] children.
[47:49] We know that they are present. How how
[47:52] it was so emphasized
[47:55] by your messenger which was continually
[47:59] passing into that realm and in contact
[48:02] with that realm and seeking to make us
[48:05] as believers of the message to be aware.
[48:09] These five senses are only to contact
[48:12] this world. But there's another world.
[48:15] There's another realm. And we as
[48:18] believers have another sense. We we have
[48:21] a six sense and by faith we reach
[48:24] through the promise of God and we see oh
[48:27] God and feel the influence of the angels
[48:31] of God that have been sent and
[48:34] commissioned oh Lord and encamped.
[48:37] They're not visiting but they are
[48:39] encamped around your people. Not for
[48:43] some aimless reason but with a design
[48:46] with a purpose. Oh God, may we be
[48:49] energized this morning to receive from
[48:52] your word to lift your name up to have
[48:56] our desires fulfilled with the right
[48:58] purpose in mind that your name will be
[49:01] glorified. We don't need any
[49:03] self-aclaim. We don't need any credit to
[49:06] ourselves, Lord. Not at all. We want all
[49:09] the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ. And
[49:14] we would say with the songwriter, we'll
[49:16] give all the glory to Jesus and tell of
[49:20] his love. Bless the people now, Lord.
[49:22] Anoint them. Anoint me, I pray, oh God,
[49:26] as I speak, all those that are
[49:27] streaming, we are greeting them in the
[49:30] lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[49:33] praying that they too will be blessed
[49:36] together with us. Inspire us now, Lord,
[49:39] and open our eyes that we may see
[49:42] glorious things that you have for us.
[49:46] That we might be fed,
[49:48] &gt;&gt; might be healed, might be delivered,
[49:52] &gt;&gt; oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, let
[49:55] prison bars be broken. Let the prisoners
[49:58] come out, oh God. We pray father for
[50:01] brother Ron
[50:03] Spencer, his son Matthew and oh God
[50:08] special prayer for sister Connie bearing
[50:11] such a heavy load alone as she is
[50:13] without her husband and son in the
[50:15] house. I pray father you strengthen her
[50:19] and oh God create I pray new tissue
[50:23] where all is required. I pray in our
[50:27] brother Ron Lord be sustained by the
[50:30] power the virtue of the resurrected
[50:34] Jesus Christ. In thy name we pray and
[50:37] for your glory. Amen. Amen. God bless
[50:42] you.
[50:43] May open your Bibles if you would please
[50:47] to two places. I'm going to read Matthew
[50:51] 9 and 20.
[50:54] And before we read,
[50:58] I want to just make a few comments.
[51:02] I have been speaking the last time I
[51:06] spoke from Isaiah 6 where brother Brham
[51:11] reads in the year you king Uzziah died I
[51:15] saw the Lord high and lifted up and this
[51:16] is Isaiah's experience
[51:20] and that
[51:22] powerfully affected his life because
[51:26] brother Brandham said that King Uzziah
[51:28] had had a great influence on Isaiah. And
[51:32] King Uzziah was his hero. He said one
[51:35] place he said he was his buddy. He was
[51:37] his friend. And so all of these things
[51:41] go to go to tell us and he was conveying
[51:44] to us that King Uzziah influenced uh
[51:49] Isaiah and then he died and uh then
[51:53] Isaiah was influenced from above.
[51:57] Everybody's influenced.
[52:00] We all are influenced and we all
[52:02] influence somebody.
[52:05] A part of influence which I didn't bring
[52:08] last time and so I need to connect it
[52:10] now because we're coming from completely
[52:12] different direction.
[52:15] Part of influence is is
[52:19] uh to really be influenced requires
[52:22] respect.
[52:24] So I'm going to come from the direction
[52:26] of respect quite quite a uh most of the
[52:31] service this morning and respect we
[52:35] respect is a very relative word.
[52:38] uh we probably could interpret it quite
[52:42] differently from one person to another
[52:45] but respect is inseparably
[52:48] connected to a person being influenced
[52:52] by someone else.
[52:55] Respect of God's servants, we could say
[52:59] his prophets, his messengers, his
[53:01] apostles, his ministers.
[53:05] And we bring it down into the family
[53:11] between parents and children, between
[53:14] husband and wife. We bring it down into
[53:16] the church. Respect between for the
[53:20] bloodwashed.
[53:22] If we really believe what we say we
[53:25] believe. And I believe that Christ
[53:27] actually shed his blood and journeyed to
[53:31] the cross with his determined steps to
[53:34] buy you.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; That calls for something. That calls for
[53:40] me to treat you in a certain way and for
[53:43] us to treat one another in a certain way
[53:45] and to speak of one another in a certain
[53:48] way. Because in so doing, when we
[53:51] respect what God has ordained or what
[53:55] God has put in place, if we respect
[53:59] that, then we're not respecting that
[54:02] individual only. We're respecting God
[54:06] who ordained the whole thing before the
[54:08] foundation of the world. We are saying,
[54:11] "I'm in full agreement. My spirit gives
[54:14] witness, so I must have the same spirit
[54:16] that arranged all of this. I respect
[54:19] this person.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; And on the other hand, if we admire and
[54:26] respect and have awe
[54:30] for the world,
[54:32] someone of influence and someone of
[54:34] power and someone of, you know, who
[54:38] commands a great deal for one reason or
[54:41] another, they command a great deal of of
[54:44] honor in the world. And we begin. And
[54:46] they might be powerful people
[54:48] politically.
[54:50] They might be powerful people
[54:53] financially. They might be powerful
[54:55] people for whatever reason within a
[54:58] church or whatever more some religious
[55:00] organization.
[55:02] And we need to be aware that you know
[55:06] these that are called stars and sports
[55:08] stars and whatever more for you young
[55:10] people, we're not honoring the person.
[55:14] We're not respecting the person. That
[55:17] respect is flowing through to whoever
[55:19] designed this thing.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; And as far as I'm concerned and as far
[55:23] as the message is concerned, it says
[55:25] Satan. This is Satan is the god of this
[55:28] present evil age.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; And he has set all these things in
[55:31] order. And we are we we are not to
[55:34] respect that. I I realize we are to
[55:37] respect the laws of the land and the
[55:39] people who are in place and the people
[55:40] in authority and pray for the king and
[55:42] those things.
[55:44] But uh and that is having to do with our
[55:48] natural life and so on. But I think
[55:51] you'll understand it a lot clear. I
[55:53] wanted to just excuse me. I don't often
[55:55] hold you standing while I start to mini
[55:58] sermon. But uh I wanted to get that in
[56:01] place before we read.
[56:04] I'm reading from Matthew 9 and 20.
[56:11] And behold, a woman which was diseased
[56:13] with an issue of blood 12 years came
[56:17] behind him and touched the hem of his
[56:20] garment.
[56:22] For she said within herself, "If I may
[56:25] but touch his garment, I shall be
[56:28] whole." But Jesus turned him about, and
[56:31] when he saw her, he said, "Daughter, be
[56:35] of good comfort. Thy faith hath made
[56:39] thee whole." And the woman was made
[56:42] whole from that hour.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Turn with me to Luke 22
[56:50] and we're going to look at verse 63
[56:54] and 64.
[57:06] And the man that held Jesus,
[57:10] I hope you are with me.
[57:14] A woman just touched his garment. She
[57:17] said, "If I may but touch his garment,
[57:23] &gt;&gt; I will be whole."
[57:25] &gt;&gt; And now here's some men. They have the
[57:28] same person.
[57:31] the same man
[57:33] &gt;&gt; and they are they actually have him in
[57:35] their grip. They held him
[57:39] &gt;&gt; and and they held Jesus, mocked him and
[57:44] smoked him. And when they had
[57:47] blindfolded him, can you just picture?
[57:50] Can you just picture a couple of
[57:52] soldiers, some holding him and some
[57:55] putting a rag, brother Bren says, a rag
[57:57] around his face and they struck him on
[58:00] the face and asked him, saying,
[58:02] "Prophesy,
[58:04] who is it that smokeote thee?"
[58:09] Brother Brandham said, "And they felt no
[58:12] virtue
[58:15] &gt;&gt; and they had no virtue. They actually
[58:18] touched him and held him and wanted him
[58:21] to prophesy and smoke him and mocked
[58:23] him, but no virtue flowed from him."
[58:27] You may be seated.
[58:34] two events.
[58:38] One woman in a group of officers
[58:42] having an opportunity.
[58:45] Brother Brandham said about these
[58:47] events, he referred to them in in
[58:49] influence.
[58:52] He said, "Look at the soldiers.
[58:55] They put a rag over his face and set him
[58:57] out there in a courtyard and took a
[58:59] stick and struck him on the head with it
[59:04] and then passed it one to another and
[59:06] said, "If you be a prophet, prophesy
[59:09] now. Tell us which one hit you."
[59:13] And so no response at all. They could
[59:17] they couldn't feel no virtue. But the
[59:21] little woman with enough faith that
[59:23] could touch his garment, she got her
[59:26] desires. He see, he said, you see, we've
[59:29] got to be conscious of God's presence.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; And that really was the difference. One
[59:35] was not conscious of God's presence and
[59:38] the other was conscious of God's
[59:40] presence and it was the difference of
[59:43] receiving.
[59:44] In the message expectation,
[59:47] he said uh the woman touched his garment
[59:50] one time and she got healed, but another
[59:53] one hit him on the head and everything
[59:56] else and they couldn't feel any virtue.
[59:58] He said it's the way they approached
[1:00:00] him. So now in the one instance he's
[1:00:03] referring to them being conscious of his
[1:00:06] presence
[1:00:08] that's that's necessary for us. We're
[1:00:11] here in this service. We must be
[1:00:14] conscious of his presence because you
[1:00:17] have a messenger and you have the word
[1:00:20] of God also that is said he'll never
[1:00:22] leave you nor forsake you. You have a
[1:00:24] messenger who said he'll come when he's
[1:00:27] invited also saying that he is present.
[1:00:30] He is here. And I just took that it was
[1:00:33] over over about 1300 times brother
[1:00:36] Brandham declared he's here.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; That ought to register. We're not that,
[1:00:43] you know, we're not that thick. We we
[1:00:46] should say we should be able to say with
[1:00:49] everything that's in us and and say to
[1:00:52] our soul, he's present. Oh, we say,
[1:00:56] well, I might not feel it or I had a,
[1:00:59] you know, this took place this morning
[1:01:01] or I have these pressures or I have
[1:01:03] these burdens. That's just life. That
[1:01:05] has nothing to do to with keeping us
[1:01:07] from sensing his presence. His presence
[1:01:11] is is the answer for us.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; For every one of us,
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; for all that are
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; streaming wherever whatever room,
[1:01:19] whatever country, whatever conditions
[1:01:22] you may have, we have different economic
[1:01:24] conditions and every every uh every
[1:01:27] country's got uh uh different political
[1:01:29] system and all the rest of it. And we
[1:01:31] may worship differently from one place
[1:01:34] to another, but one thing for sure, his
[1:01:36] presence is the same in every place.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; And he's made an access for us to
[1:01:43] approach to him. And that should be the
[1:01:46] same in every place.
[1:01:49] He said, "And I'm I'm trying to feel."
[1:01:51] Now, Brother Brandham was saying in this
[1:01:53] service, I'm trying to feel the
[1:01:55] approach. Because he has a woman in
[1:01:57] front of him. He as a sister standing
[1:02:00] there or a woman standing there. He
[1:02:02] said, "I'm trying to feel the approach.
[1:02:05] You see what I mean? Cuz it's the way
[1:02:07] you regard it." He's talking to the
[1:02:09] woman. It's the way that you regard it,
[1:02:12] not me. But you have to respect what I'm
[1:02:16] talking about or uh uh or it's just or
[1:02:20] it just won't be. It's your approach to
[1:02:23] God. Now, he's telling her, "It's not
[1:02:25] his approach. It's her approach.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; It's your approach. It's not me who has
[1:02:30] studied. Not me who has waited on God.
[1:02:33] Not me who has prayed and and wept
[1:02:35] before God for this service, but now
[1:02:37] it's your approach.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? It's
[1:02:43] your approach to his presence. And this
[1:02:46] is what's important. And if we can bring
[1:02:48] that together, I can tell you all manner
[1:02:50] of supernatural things happen. You'll
[1:02:53] have what you need before God. I want to
[1:02:55] bring you directly into that presence. I
[1:02:57] want to bring you directly into that
[1:02:59] expectation. At the very beginning of
[1:03:02] this service, you can say, "Oh, God."
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Pastor's up there speaking, "Oh, God."
[1:03:07] He's not saying these things for idle
[1:03:10] talk. We're not sitting here just to put
[1:03:12] in some time on a Sunday morning. We're
[1:03:15] here to meet and to touch with that
[1:03:18] eternal realm. That's why we're here.
[1:03:20] And we put everything else and every
[1:03:21] other thought aside.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; We mean business with God. Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; And he said, "It's your approach."
[1:03:32] The Pharisees one time sent officers,
[1:03:36] soldiers,
[1:03:38] to actually seize and arrest
[1:03:41] Jesus
[1:03:44] and uh to bring him to them.
[1:03:49] And so when they went there,
[1:03:51] they heard some words. And I'm just
[1:03:54] going to give you some short phrases
[1:03:58] of the words of Jesus that they heard.
[1:04:02] They heard him cry out. The Bible even
[1:04:04] said he cried out in the temple.
[1:04:08] Ye both know me and you know whence I am
[1:04:13] and I am not come of myself. But he that
[1:04:16] sent me is true whom you know not.
[1:04:22] He said, "But I know him and I am from
[1:04:25] him and he hath sent me." He said a
[1:04:29] little further, "Yet a little while and
[1:04:31] I am with you.
[1:04:33] And then I go to him that sent me and
[1:04:38] you shall seek for me. You shall not
[1:04:40] find me. And where I am thither you
[1:04:45] cannot come.
[1:04:47] If any man thirst, let him come unto me
[1:04:52] and drink. And he that believeth on me,
[1:04:55] as the scripture hath said, out of his
[1:04:57] belly shall flow rivers of living water.
[1:05:02] And the officers came back to the chief
[1:05:04] priests and said, "Never a man spake
[1:05:07] like this."
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Never a man spake like this. They said,
[1:05:12] "What's the matter with you? You
[1:05:14] deceived also?"
[1:05:16] They couldn't change their mind.
[1:05:19] Never a man spake like this.
[1:05:25] There's no record.
[1:05:28] Now, and now I'm in my third experience.
[1:05:31] Number one, the woman pressing through
[1:05:34] and getting a hold of his garment.
[1:05:37] Number one. Number two, men holding him,
[1:05:41] putting a rag around his face, and
[1:05:44] having him to prophesy. You're a
[1:05:45] prophet. They say, "You're a prophet.
[1:05:46] Prophesy. Here's a stick to his buddy."
[1:05:49] And he now you prophesy who struck you.
[1:05:52] He never said a word and no virtue came.
[1:05:56] And now some men, this is a third one,
[1:05:59] and they've been sent on their special
[1:06:01] mission. Arrest this man and bring him
[1:06:04] bound to us. And they go there and they
[1:06:06] listen to these words and finally hear
[1:06:09] him crying out, "He that is a thirst,
[1:06:12] let him come to me and drink. And he
[1:06:14] that believeth on me, he said, uh, out
[1:06:16] of his belly, he that believeth on me,
[1:06:19] as the scripture hath said, out of his
[1:06:21] belly shall flow rivers of living water.
[1:06:24] And they were smitten and they went
[1:06:25] back. They couldn't arrest him. They go
[1:06:27] back.
[1:06:30] They say, "Never man spake like this
[1:06:32] man."
[1:06:34] And their leaders thought they were
[1:06:36] deceived.
[1:06:37] But there's no record that this
[1:06:40] experience ever went beyond that.
[1:06:43] There's people today that hear the
[1:06:45] message and they say, "These are
[1:06:48] astounding things. I've never heard
[1:06:50] things like that in my life. I've never
[1:06:52] heard things like the serpent Satan.
[1:06:54] That makes absolute sense. This the
[1:06:56] first time I understood the godhead.
[1:06:58] I've never Yes, I can see clearly uh uh
[1:07:02] that the baptism must be in the name of
[1:07:04] the Lord Jesus Christ. It's clear in the
[1:07:06] scripture." And they hear and they say,
[1:07:07] "I've never heard anything like this.
[1:07:10] This is astounding. This is amazing.
[1:07:12] This is this is marvelous. But it's as
[1:07:14] far as it goes.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Their experience doesn't go any further
[1:07:21] and that's as far as they're influenced.
[1:07:26] Now,
[1:07:28] there's an aspect of the message and I
[1:07:32] want to really nail this down.
[1:07:36] Not that you don't haven't heard it, not
[1:07:38] that you don't realize it, but it's
[1:07:40] something that I have to keep bringing
[1:07:43] myself up
[1:07:46] uh right in harmony with. And that is
[1:07:50] this message. The revealed word is none
[1:07:54] other than Jesus Christ.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; The person of Jesus Christ is present
[1:08:01] here.
[1:08:02] And the Bible tells us
[1:08:06] that down through history
[1:08:10] uh he showed himself in different forms.
[1:08:16] He appeared to Abraham as Melzdc. He
[1:08:19] appeared in an in a form of Elohim in a
[1:08:23] body of flesh and ate meat and butter
[1:08:26] and drank milk and spoke.
[1:08:31] Abraham at that time when he met him he
[1:08:34] fell to the earth to receive them three
[1:08:38] men but he said my Lord singular he
[1:08:42] appeared to Moses in a pillar of fire
[1:08:44] and he said who art thou Lord I am the
[1:08:46] God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and
[1:08:49] the God of Jacob but he was in a another
[1:08:52] form
[1:08:56] Nebuchadnezzar cast three men into a
[1:08:59] furnace and they went to see how they
[1:09:01] were.
[1:09:03] And I saw a form of a fourth man in the
[1:09:07] furnace. And he said, "The fourth man is
[1:09:10] in the form of the son of God."
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; How he said that or what he knew, what
[1:09:15] he was looking at, I don't know. What
[1:09:17] did he look like? Yeah.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; John the Apostle in Revelations,
[1:09:28] our age, the Leodysian age, he sought
[1:09:34] Christ.
[1:09:35] He actually saw the person Christ
[1:09:39] outside of the door in a form and he's
[1:09:43] knocking on the door seeking to get
[1:09:46] admission inside. Brother Brandon makes
[1:09:49] many references. That picture hangs in
[1:09:52] many homes and it's considered, you
[1:09:54] know, such a beautiful picture and I
[1:09:56] don't know what people feel or what
[1:09:58] emotion they have when they see him
[1:10:00] knocking on the door and have beautiful
[1:10:02] roses and flowers, you know, an arbor or
[1:10:05] something going around the doorway and
[1:10:07] it's such a beautiful picture to brother
[1:10:09] Brandham said it's a tragic picture.
[1:10:13] He's on the outside.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; And that was actually taking place in
[1:10:20] this generation when a lot of you people
[1:10:22] were living.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; When most of us actually were living and
[1:10:29] and this person, whoever it was that
[1:10:32] John saw in whatever form he is in this
[1:10:37] day, was literally pushed out. Now, if
[1:10:41] you had have stood beside those soldiers
[1:10:44] and and perhaps you'd had some kind of
[1:10:47] mixed feeling, mixed emotion about
[1:10:50] seeing this rag put around his head and
[1:10:53] seeing men start to strike him. You
[1:10:55] might have been saying that's terrible.
[1:10:57] Uh he doesn't deserve that. You might
[1:10:59] have had all kinds of feelings, but that
[1:11:01] was the form that God took upon himself.
[1:11:04] And the Bible says he took upon himself
[1:11:06] the form of a servant.
[1:11:09] He took himself the form of a man, a
[1:11:12] flesh and and when he took the form of
[1:11:15] flesh, they were able to do that in that
[1:11:17] form to strike him and so on and had no
[1:11:20] virtue whatsoever. And a lot of
[1:11:22] onlookers and people who in the
[1:11:24] following days saw his crucifixion, the
[1:11:27] people, the public waged their heads and
[1:11:29] they got no virtue.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; They they saw that they saw an event in
[1:11:35] their time. I'm bringing you to this
[1:11:37] time when there's been an event in this
[1:11:40] time in your day when that same man
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ in your day has been
[1:11:50] forcefully pushed out. We want nothing
[1:11:53] to do with this man. He's been pushed
[1:11:57] out. Think about the people who pushed
[1:11:59] him out in this day. Push the word, the
[1:12:02] word, the word, the word. He came in
[1:12:06] word form. Word form. He he had a word
[1:12:11] shape. He was he was uh uh I can say so
[1:12:16] uniquely described in word form. And so
[1:12:21] the same people and the same spirit says
[1:12:24] we will not have this man rule over us.
[1:12:29] We're going to push him out. Right.
[1:12:31] Right.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; We're going to we're going to close the
[1:12:36] doors.
[1:12:38] And that is what they did.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Now, I bring it here. Bring it to you
[1:12:43] this morning.
[1:12:46] How are you influenced by this man?
[1:12:52] What kind of influence?
[1:12:54] I thought of the world and the influence
[1:12:58] of men on our present society and this
[1:13:04] world that we have.
[1:13:07] The world has been greatly influenced
[1:13:09] and shaped
[1:13:11] by men that they consider as great men
[1:13:13] in the realm of science. I thought of uh
[1:13:17] Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton,
[1:13:19] Galileo,
[1:13:21] Stephven Hawking more currently
[1:13:25] in the realm of music, you know, you
[1:13:27] soon as you speak about music and the uh
[1:13:31] you think of Bach and Handel and
[1:13:33] Beethoven and Mozart and Schubert and
[1:13:36] Shopan.
[1:13:38] Then we have builders of faith such as
[1:13:40] Abraham,
[1:13:43] Isaac and Jacob, Moses
[1:13:46] and Elijah and David and Solomon and
[1:13:48] John the Baptist and the apostles and
[1:13:51] the messengers. And brother Brandham
[1:13:54] said of John the Baptist, he said John
[1:13:56] was the greatest man on the earth at
[1:13:58] that time. And Jesus said there never
[1:14:00] was a man born of a woman as great as he
[1:14:03] at that time and he was a prophet. He
[1:14:06] said, "You believe that?" And remember,
[1:14:08] if the word of God will come to anything
[1:14:10] in the land, it'll be a prophet.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:14:19] with all the chaos and all the
[1:14:20] confusion,
[1:14:23] the man Jesus Christ in three and a half
[1:14:28] years
[1:14:30] affected the entire earth.
[1:14:36] Unquestionably,
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; he set in motion something that was
[1:14:41] going to affect the entire earth. And
[1:14:43] people's even who are his enemies are
[1:14:45] affected by him. People who say he
[1:14:47] didn't exist are affected by him. People
[1:14:50] take up the issue and try to bring all
[1:14:52] kinds of falsehoods and about his
[1:14:54] resurre about his crucifixion, about his
[1:14:57] resurrection, h about his life and and
[1:15:00] the people who are around him. But he
[1:15:02] troubles them. He still stirs up the
[1:15:05] people. As they said in the scripture,
[1:15:07] he stirs up the people. He still stirs
[1:15:09] them up.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; He said when the Roman soldiers went
[1:15:16] back one time listening to him, he's
[1:15:19] referring to the scripture I read, never
[1:15:20] a man spake like this man. He said, we
[1:15:23] never heard man speak like this. He said
[1:15:25] it was not a man speaking. It was God.
[1:15:29] But that's what they didn't catch. They
[1:15:32] didn't come back to their leaders and
[1:15:34] say we heard God.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; They didn't pick that up.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Said never a man spake like this man.
[1:15:43] That was absolutely the truth. But he
[1:15:45] said it wasn't a man speaking. It was
[1:15:47] God. He said man didn't speak like that.
[1:15:52] He said a man tells and speaks the
[1:15:55] scripture but Jesus made the scriptures
[1:15:59] live. Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; I can say we're following a certain
[1:16:04] message.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; And one thing I'm I'm identified. I'm I
[1:16:08] don't have to make the message work. I
[1:16:10] had a messenger that made the message
[1:16:12] work
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; and I am identified with that. It
[1:16:15] doesn't say that all the apostles went
[1:16:17] and did exactly what Jesus did as they
[1:16:20] were following him. They were identified
[1:16:22] with him.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the Holy Spirit came and
[1:16:25] they went on with the ministry of Jesus
[1:16:28] Christ which continues to today.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; He said a man didn't live like this. The
[1:16:36] scripture says this here. Here it is.
[1:16:40] Man can say that the scripture says it.
[1:16:43] But that's about all man can do. So man
[1:16:46] can say the scripture says this and the
[1:16:48] scripture says that. But he's saying a
[1:16:51] man can say that that the scripture says
[1:16:54] it, but that's about all he can do. But
[1:16:57] Jesus said, "I and my father are one."
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; My father dwells in me. He that seen me
[1:17:05] has seen the father. Nobody else could
[1:17:08] say that. But I want to say hallelujah.
[1:17:11] Because of the word, because of the
[1:17:13] message that we have received on the
[1:17:16] same authority, we can say today, I and
[1:17:19] my father are one. Because we've been
[1:17:21] told we came from the genes of our
[1:17:23] father. Is that the truth? Is that what
[1:17:25] the word says? We've come from the genes
[1:17:28] of our heavenly father. We've come here
[1:17:30] to manifest whatever he has spoken of
[1:17:32] this day. God didn't just speak about a
[1:17:35] messenger. He didn't just speak about a
[1:17:37] prophet messenger. He spoke about an
[1:17:39] elect lady that would be called out by
[1:17:41] that word and that there would be a
[1:17:43] people in this season that would believe
[1:17:46] that word and they would see him. They
[1:17:48] would have right and have access to
[1:17:51] everything that he sent for this time.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; And we do
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; and it works and we see it on a regular
[1:17:59] basis.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; On a regular basis. I see Satan
[1:18:02] defeated. I see demons cast out. I see
[1:18:06] healing take place. I see miracles take
[1:18:08] place. Hallelujah. That's the God we
[1:18:11] serve.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And the scriptures live.
[1:18:19] So God,
[1:18:22] the Bible says, he took the form
[1:18:25] and being found in fashion of a man, he
[1:18:28] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:18:31] death, even the death of the cross.
[1:18:34] And I am
[1:18:37] I'm really wanting to
[1:18:41] get near to you this morning with this
[1:18:44] message
[1:18:48] because I just wonder how
[1:18:51] influenced we are and how much we
[1:18:54] respect
[1:18:57] this man.
[1:19:00] Luke 17:30.
[1:19:03] I says a preacher can speak of a
[1:19:05] scripture. So I can say Luke 17:30
[1:19:09] in that day the son of man will be
[1:19:13] revealed. But I'm going way beyond that.
[1:19:16] I'm saying
[1:19:18] how do we respect this man?
[1:19:21] Say what man? This one that has come in
[1:19:26] a form. He didn't come to you in a
[1:19:28] pillar of fire. He didn't come to you as
[1:19:31] he did to Job in a whirlwind. He has not
[1:19:34] walked into your home or come into your
[1:19:37] yard in a body of flesh. And you need
[1:19:39] the same revelation. You'd have to have
[1:19:42] a special a very very special
[1:19:50] thing happen that you'd be able to
[1:19:52] recognize and look at a man in a fleshly
[1:19:55] form and realize that God was veiled
[1:19:58] behind this skin.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Don't belittle this friend. That would
[1:20:04] take an incredible revelation.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; That to me would take a greater
[1:20:08] revelation than to believe he came in
[1:20:10] word form.
[1:20:16] And that was the trouble they had when
[1:20:18] God became flesh.
[1:20:22] And that's a trouble the Jews still
[1:20:23] have. How can God have a son?
[1:20:27] How can he have a son?
[1:20:30] And if and if this was the son, it's
[1:20:32] Christian Solomon said to me, "How could
[1:20:34] God see his son die? The one who even
[1:20:37] said, "Thou shalt not kill." How can he
[1:20:40] take and destroy his son or allow his
[1:20:42] death complete
[1:20:46] something irreconcilable to their
[1:20:48] thinking?
[1:20:53] He has
[1:20:55] actually you know as far as religion is
[1:20:58] concerned as far as church organizations
[1:21:00] are concerned
[1:21:03] you know we've got books
[1:21:06] brother but bram said this is God on
[1:21:08] written page
[1:21:12] that's God in print
[1:21:15] that tell you something
[1:21:23] What form was he in while he was outside
[1:21:25] knocking?
[1:21:27] What form? What what what do we say?
[1:21:29] Behold, I stand at the door knock. And
[1:21:31] if any man hear my voice and open the
[1:21:34] door, I will come into him and s with
[1:21:36] him and he with me
[1:21:39] indoors in a door in 1965.
[1:21:45] His ministry is just coming to a
[1:21:48] conclusion.
[1:21:50] He said, "But he but here he's outside
[1:21:54] outside are creeds and things that run
[1:21:57] him out of the church." The creeds,
[1:22:01] which is also word. But there was people
[1:22:05] believing those creeds say, "We believe
[1:22:07] them. We endorse them. We embrace them.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; We've given ourselves to them. We're
[1:22:16] identified with these creeds." If the
[1:22:18] creed says that you're baptized certain
[1:22:21] way, you're sprinkled a certain way or
[1:22:22] whatever you're supposed to do, that's
[1:22:24] what I am going to my body is going to
[1:22:26] do that. And my mouth is going to
[1:22:28] declare it because this is the creed.
[1:22:31] And in the meantime, the creed and the
[1:22:34] people in whom the creed was embodied
[1:22:38] was pushing him out, physically pushing
[1:22:42] him out. And John saw him being pushed
[1:22:45] out. John saw him finally on the outside
[1:22:48] and now we have now we have a time that
[1:22:51] has arrived in the history of mankind
[1:22:54] and a prophet is raised up said he's out
[1:22:58] outside he's outside now he's been
[1:23:01] pushed out
[1:23:04] and the messenger in whom the word came
[1:23:07] to the word comes to the prophet so now
[1:23:12] the prophet himself
[1:23:14] because he has a different word, a
[1:23:17] different message.
[1:23:19] He physically is being pushed out until
[1:23:22] he says all the doors are closed.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Said to the people in Tucson, I've been
[1:23:28] here for x amount of time, haven't had
[1:23:31] any invitation. Why? Because that
[1:23:35] scripture was being fulfilled in him.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; And now we recognize this man,
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; not the prophet messenger. We have to
[1:23:46] recognize him or you can never recognize
[1:23:48] who sent him.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus. That's why he kept saying to the
[1:23:52] man who were said never a man spake like
[1:23:54] this. He said uh I've been sent here.
[1:23:58] I'm going to the one that sent me. He
[1:24:01] that is with me. And they knew nothing
[1:24:03] about him.
[1:24:07] So he said he's been they run him out of
[1:24:10] the church but he's standing out there.
[1:24:14] Oh, I hope you can see what I'm saying.
[1:24:18] He's standing out there and here is his
[1:24:22] representative standing out there. He
[1:24:25] said he's standing out there still
[1:24:27] knocking. That's right.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; There was a messenger standing out there
[1:24:34] knocking, trying to gain entrance so
[1:24:38] that the people could hear glorious
[1:24:41] things.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; That we've heard.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I got pushed out.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; I'm glad they closed the doors on me.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad they in essentially
[1:24:56] said don't come back.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And while those doors were
[1:25:01] being closed sometimes with you with the
[1:25:03] church or the family or the religion or
[1:25:05] whatever more other doors was opening
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; hallelujah and so I just so glad to be
[1:25:11] identified
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; with the doors that God has opened.
[1:25:19] So we have felt that
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; double pressure
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; being pushed out. Said he's pushed out.
[1:25:26] He says, "And if and and he that will
[1:25:29] hear and open the door, I'll come into
[1:25:32] him and s with him and give him healing
[1:25:36] for his eyes."
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; And close and give him the riches of
[1:25:41] heaven. He that will hear me knock.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; My friends, this isn't some word. That's
[1:25:48] not a quote. This is an event.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; This is just as real as the woman
[1:25:52] touching his garment.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; It was happened to be that form that
[1:25:56] day. Now it's another form. Happens to
[1:25:59] be a word form. A word form. When you
[1:26:01] hear the message, it's actually the form
[1:26:04] of the son of God.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; That's his form.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; That's the form he decided to have in
[1:26:12] our time.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; You might say, why? Well, I think
[1:26:17] probably why this is the day of books.
[1:26:21] This is the day of advancement.
[1:26:24] This is the day when men, you know,
[1:26:27] revel in the fact that they're
[1:26:28] intelligent and they've got, you know,
[1:26:31] they've got their libraries and they've
[1:26:33] got all manner of means of transmitting
[1:26:37] information.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Text.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; So God says, "Well, okay.
[1:26:46] That's the way Satan's going to arrange
[1:26:48] it. My enemy is going to make it as a
[1:26:50] real intelligent
[1:26:52] society, a civilization, oh advanced,
[1:26:56] and they're probably going to have an
[1:26:57] image set way up. And the image won't be
[1:26:59] the form of man, it'll be the form of a
[1:27:01] brain.
[1:27:03] People are so consumed with what the
[1:27:05] brain, you know, how many cells it has
[1:27:07] and what you can do with the brain and
[1:27:09] and oh, we have things of, you know,
[1:27:11] learning and learning and pressing
[1:27:13] people to learn and higher education,
[1:27:15] higher education,
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:21] I had when I was working and I was
[1:27:25] president of a company and we had to
[1:27:28] hire some people and there was a guy
[1:27:30] down there sweeping the floor getting
[1:27:33] ready to so they could make ready an
[1:27:36] area for a sales area. Sweeping the
[1:27:39] floor
[1:27:41] and
[1:27:43] uh one executive said
[1:27:46] uh you know what that fellow is? I said
[1:27:48] no. Oh, we we got him. He's, you know,
[1:27:50] he's been going to university. He's he's
[1:27:53] either got his doctorate or he's got
[1:27:54] something else and he has all kinds of,
[1:27:57] you know, letters behind his name and
[1:27:59] all the rest, but he was sweeping the
[1:28:01] floor for me.
[1:28:03] What What was the problem? Well, he was
[1:28:05] so highly educated, he couldn't hardly
[1:28:07] find work. And I and and on the other
[1:28:08] hand, he didn't know what he wanted to
[1:28:10] do.
[1:28:11] He was a professional student.
[1:28:14] If you're a professional student, you
[1:28:16] never find out what you're going to do.
[1:28:17] He didn't know what he wanted to do yet.
[1:28:22] I don't know.
[1:28:24] I say like brother Garald. Okay. Anyway,
[1:28:28] anyway, we go on.
[1:28:40] He said in the events made clear
[1:28:43] one of the last services there's not
[1:28:45] another age
[1:28:47] another church age that Jesus was on the
[1:28:50] outside
[1:28:52] not another age
[1:28:54] hello folks
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; you are living in a time this is not
[1:28:59] some just poetic language this is an
[1:29:02] actual event there was and here's a
[1:29:04] prophet saying there was never another
[1:29:07] time in all history
[1:29:10] where he's actually put outside of the
[1:29:12] church and this is your day. So I I just
[1:29:16] if if that is true, I'm asking you what
[1:29:18] form is it? What form is he?
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; And people could get a hold of that form
[1:29:24] sufficiently understand that form and
[1:29:27] say we don't want that in here.
[1:29:32] Amen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; So if there's people that can grasp that
[1:29:38] and and and and they they see some sort
[1:29:41] of shape
[1:29:43] some and to them it's a doctrine to them
[1:29:46] it's just some words but it has
[1:29:49] sufficient shape said that's dangerous
[1:29:52] we don't want that in here there has to
[1:29:55] be another group
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; that sees that form and to them they see
[1:30:00] clearly who that form form is
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; it's not just a man walking in dust in I
[1:30:07] don't know whether he had sandals or
[1:30:09] bare feet coming to Abraham but what was
[1:30:12] it that came upon Abraham and said and
[1:30:15] fell down in the sand and said my Lord
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; what was that whatever happened to
[1:30:23] Abraham you are Abraham's children and
[1:30:27] we must see the same one
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; the same one coming to the children in
[1:30:33] the end time to res for the purpose of
[1:30:36] if it came in the purpose for Abraham to
[1:30:39] tell him Sarah's going to have a child.
[1:30:42] I'm here now to tell you that you're
[1:30:44] going to have a son
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; and here we are waiting for the son for
[1:30:48] the son. And the prophet says the same
[1:30:51] thing that now it's to restore our faith
[1:30:54] back. where the children restore the
[1:30:56] faith back and tell us the son is on his
[1:31:00] way. In fact is that messenger was here
[1:31:05] to identify the time. This is the son.
[1:31:09] It's not me. It's him.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; I'm just a man, but it's him.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; No. Not many.
[1:31:24] And I don't know,
[1:31:26] sometimes I even question whether I
[1:31:28] should say certain things, but not many
[1:31:30] grasp it.
[1:31:32] And I said before coming into the
[1:31:35] platform this morning to the pulpit, I
[1:31:37] said, "Well,
[1:31:39] if there's one, I'm going to come to an
[1:31:42] account in the scripture."
[1:31:45] And Jesus refers back to this woman.
[1:31:49] She was the widow, a Shinomite.
[1:31:52] Uh, I'm sorry she wasn't a widow,
[1:31:55] but as a Shudomite woman in the time of
[1:31:58] Elisha when I have an opportunity, Lord
[1:32:01] willing, just a little bit later on.
[1:32:04] And Jesus said, "As it was in the days
[1:32:07] of Sodom," now this is Jesus.
[1:32:10] "As it was in the days of Sodom, so
[1:32:12] shall it be at the coming of the Son of
[1:32:14] Man.
[1:32:15] When the son of man is being revealed,
[1:32:20] what has it done to your eyes?
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham asks, "When the son of
[1:32:26] man," what was he saying? He was saying,
[1:32:29] "Now, you may say, well, this is so
[1:32:32] elementary to us." No, it's not
[1:32:34] elementary where I'm going,
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; When Luke 17:30 is happening, and he's
[1:32:39] saying it is happening.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; What's happening to your eyes? I'm
[1:32:45] saying it to this congregation. I'm
[1:32:47] saying it to all that. What happened to
[1:32:49] our eyes? Yes, we heard things and maybe
[1:32:52] intellectually we understood things. We
[1:32:54] saw them in the scripture. We had
[1:32:56] revelation as we understand it. But now,
[1:32:59] where is the presence of this one? What
[1:33:02] is it that you sense this morning from
[1:33:04] this one? Are you touching this one now?
[1:33:07] I'm not interested what happened 10
[1:33:09] years ago. I'm interested what's
[1:33:11] happening now. Amen.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; I'm interested what's happening in this
[1:33:14] service.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; I'm wondering where our respect is and
[1:33:20] wondering, not that I don't see it. I'm
[1:33:22] just wondering at what level,
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; our respect is.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; We can show respect by saying, "How do
[1:33:31] you do?" And we shake hands with one
[1:33:34] another. We show respect. We may embrace
[1:33:38] a brother, a sister to a sister.
[1:33:42] We may say show honor to one another
[1:33:48] sometimes we don't
[1:33:51] I really think it greatly very much in
[1:33:53] fact is I don't think I know it hinders
[1:33:55] us very much
[1:34:00] I've been in a lot of foreign countries
[1:34:05] in India I've had people fall down
[1:34:10] and we've raised him up right away
[1:34:12] quickly. Brother Lonnie Jenkins and I
[1:34:13] had it several times.
[1:34:16] I've had others
[1:34:18] take my hand. Come. I couldn't even get
[1:34:21] off the the service. Just just close
[1:34:24] maybe the last prayer and before you
[1:34:26] could before you could almost blink. I
[1:34:29] couldn't move because the pulpit w the
[1:34:32] whole platform was absolutely crowded
[1:34:35] stuff crowded with people and people
[1:34:39] wanting to take your hand and one man
[1:34:41] took my hand and laid the hand on his
[1:34:44] children teenagers lay my hand bless
[1:34:48] bless bless them my son bless my
[1:34:51] daughter and give them blessing and I
[1:34:54] did
[1:34:56] that was his faith that was his respect
[1:34:59] And I did. And up came a a child about 8
[1:35:04] years old that fell out of a building
[1:35:07] onto concrete on his head and had never
[1:35:10] spoken a word since and said, you know,
[1:35:13] bring him, pray for him. I I haven't
[1:35:15] hardly many of you have never heard
[1:35:17] this. I prayed for him and I said, say
[1:35:19] Jesus. He said, Jesus. His his parents
[1:35:22] just went ecstatic.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Say, was it the person? No. had nothing
[1:35:28] to do with me. Had to do with their
[1:35:30] approach.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Had to do with their respect. Had to do
[1:35:33] entirely with them. What they were
[1:35:35] doing. And they it's not the person they
[1:35:37] were coming to. But in honoring that,
[1:35:39] they were honoring the God. Whatever
[1:35:41] gift it is, they were honoring the God
[1:35:42] who sent it. Says God has sent this to
[1:35:45] us here. I say God has sent this
[1:35:48] message. God has sent this messenger.
[1:35:50] God has intended that all the glory that
[1:35:53] he has and all the power
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; that he's invested in that should flow
[1:35:59] through to those who can honor it and
[1:36:02] respect it.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Have brothers here from
[1:36:11] Congo and other parts of Africa.
[1:36:14] I here in this church
[1:36:17] I find a great difference between us
[1:36:20] North Americans
[1:36:22] and these that came say from Africa.
[1:36:27] They will as men who are not children
[1:36:31] are not even young people anymore.
[1:36:35] And you young people listen
[1:36:39] and they will call me and say I need to
[1:36:41] see you brother Biscll come into my
[1:36:43] office
[1:36:46] say
[1:36:49] I'm thinking of marriage
[1:36:52] and I'm coming now to you pastor to ask
[1:36:55] you
[1:36:58] if it will be all right if I have
[1:37:01] thoughts of marriage
[1:37:04] and do you have someone in mind. Well,
[1:37:07] yes, I would like to contact. I would
[1:37:11] like to speak now to my parents, but
[1:37:13] they've come to me first. Not that I
[1:37:15] want them to come first, but they have
[1:37:19] honored the office. And I know as I know
[1:37:24] my as well as I know my own name, that
[1:37:26] the God that they honored, it just
[1:37:28] flows. It bypasses me. It just flows to
[1:37:30] them. and they're the beneficiary
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; for what they've done.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; So many times here in North America
[1:37:40] here, you know, it comes to the
[1:37:41] grapevine. Oh, you know, so and so is
[1:37:44] going with so and so. Oh, is that right?
[1:37:45] Okay. Yeah, so and so is going with
[1:37:48] where did you meet them? Oh, I met them
[1:37:50] on the internet. Good luck.
[1:38:00] Hello.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not giving you computer text
[1:38:06] language. I'm giving you the Bible.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you the form of the son of
[1:38:10] man.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; It's the message.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; The message is a man.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; He's been put out by so many others but
[1:38:22] opened the door of others.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; But there's many that are around it.
[1:38:27] There's many that look at it. There's
[1:38:29] many that sympathize with it. There's
[1:38:31] many that fellowship with it, but don't
[1:38:33] get the benefit of it.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; You may be glad when this one's over.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says very clearly that
[1:38:45] this is the day when the son of man,
[1:38:48] this day the son of man is being
[1:38:52] revealed. And I say we are still here.
[1:38:55] So he's he has not ceased being
[1:38:58] revealed. He is a man.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; He is in a form. Maybe you haven't
[1:39:04] caught the form, but he's in a word
[1:39:07] form. And you're hearing part of his
[1:39:09] form. You're seeing part of his form. If
[1:39:11] you hear a message, you'd say, "I see
[1:39:13] it." I say, "You've seen the man. You've
[1:39:15] seen a part of the man."
[1:39:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; One time you may look into his eyes. You
[1:39:22] hear the form. You see it in the form.
[1:39:24] You hear it in the word form and it's
[1:39:26] touching you and it's moving you and you
[1:39:28] see the glory of his face. the next time
[1:39:30] and maybe another message and you see
[1:39:32] the sternness and the sobriety and and
[1:39:36] the next time you see the compassion and
[1:39:38] the next time you hear words of of of
[1:39:41] warning and words of judgment not upon
[1:39:44] the people of his elect but upon it's
[1:39:47] it's a warning of judgment and you
[1:39:48] you'll realize this is a serious serious
[1:39:54] not faith not a belief not a church but
[1:39:57] this man
[1:39:59] I hope I'm making my point. This is a
[1:40:02] man, friends,
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; the son of man,
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; God in the form he decided to come to in
[1:40:10] your generation.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; I ask
[1:40:18] a couple of questions.
[1:40:20] How should we correctly respect the man
[1:40:24] Jesus Christ that's revealed amongst us?
[1:40:27] How should we respect him?
[1:40:34] Should we say, "Well,
[1:40:40] we're in church,
[1:40:42] but I've got a roast on, and I sure hope
[1:40:46] that this service doesn't go on too
[1:40:48] long. We've got this thing to do, and
[1:40:51] we've got that thing to do." I just want
[1:40:53] to say how important is that in
[1:40:56] relationship to this man.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe that this man
[1:41:02] is what this is all about here, you
[1:41:04] belong someplace else.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; We're here because the son of man has
[1:41:09] been revealed. And every minister that
[1:41:11] gets behind this pulpit, I I believe
[1:41:14] that that is his sincere purpose. That's
[1:41:16] his whole will and desire, oh God, that
[1:41:19] you will make yourself known. Amen.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Reveal something further.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; We say reveal something further. The
[1:41:26] message I say reveal something further
[1:41:28] of the man.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; The person
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; he still has feelings. He still can be
[1:41:36] put out.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; He still can be received. He still can
[1:41:40] be invited. He still can be spoken to.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; He can be communed with.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Hello, folks. When was the last time you
[1:41:53] actually communed with this man?
[1:41:57] When's the last time you had a
[1:41:58] conversation with him?
[1:42:02] This man.
[1:42:11] There was a man one day.
[1:42:15] I think he was uh I don't know. He was
[1:42:17] some little preacher that
[1:42:20] was not really noticed. I I think he was
[1:42:21] a preacher. I'm not too sure. He was a
[1:42:23] preacher.
[1:42:25] And God spoke to him in prayer
[1:42:28] and said, "I want you to go and spend
[1:42:31] this day and go to everybody and tell
[1:42:35] them I love them."
[1:42:38] And he spent that day. He said it was a
[1:42:40] remarkable day. It was incredible
[1:42:44] because of course now the force
[1:42:48] and the reality.
[1:42:50] It was something real and he could say
[1:42:53] it because it was a personal commission
[1:42:55] to him and he went out that day and just
[1:42:57] said those words. I've been sent to tell
[1:43:00] you
[1:43:02] Jesus loves you.
[1:43:04] And had a powerful effect.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; He can still be communed with. They can
[1:43:10] be spoken to.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said when Jesus in his
[1:43:18] life on earth only ask one thing of the
[1:43:20] father
[1:43:24] only one thing.
[1:43:27] Father I will that they can be with me
[1:43:32] where I am.
[1:43:34] He said he asked for your fellowship.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing he asked for.
[1:43:40] with your fellowship. What does it what
[1:43:42] does that do to you? How does it make us
[1:43:44] feel? Makes me feel like crumbling.
[1:43:48] Makes me feel like falling down.
[1:43:51] Makes me feel like turning around in my
[1:43:53] chair and falling on my knees saying,
[1:43:56] "Oh, God.
[1:44:07] I want to come to
[1:44:10] an account. Maybe you'd like to turn in
[1:44:12] your Bible and this will be
[1:44:16] it's a fairly lengthy scripture, but I
[1:44:19] want to just take it some verses out of
[1:44:22] 2 Kings the 4th chapter.
[1:44:25] And please don't read ahead of me.
[1:44:41] in the fourth chapter
[1:44:44] at the 8th verse and we're going to read
[1:44:47] some scriptures and then I'll come back
[1:44:48] to them.
[1:44:52] And it fell
[1:44:54] 2 Kings 4:8.
[1:44:57] And it fell on a day that Elisha passed
[1:45:00] to Shunim
[1:45:02] where was a great woman and incidentally
[1:45:05] it's the only time it ever appears in
[1:45:06] the scripture. A great woman and she
[1:45:10] constrained him to eat bread.
[1:45:13] And so it was that as oft as he passed
[1:45:17] by he turned in thither to eat bread.
[1:45:23] And she said unto her husband, "Behold,
[1:45:25] now I perceive that this is a holy man
[1:45:29] of God, which passes by us continually.
[1:45:35] Let us make a little chamber, I pray
[1:45:38] thee,
[1:45:40] on the wall, and let us set for him uh
[1:45:44] there a bed, and a table, and a stool,
[1:45:47] and a candlestick.
[1:45:49] And it shall be when he cometh to us
[1:45:52] that he shall turn in thither. If you
[1:45:54] just look now this way, please. We want
[1:45:58] to see the we want to see the picture.
[1:46:03] There's no place in all of the recorded
[1:46:05] story that we're going to read that she
[1:46:07] knew that he was Elisha.
[1:46:11] She didn't know that he had a double
[1:46:13] portion of the spirit of Elijah.
[1:46:17] She just perceived that this was a holy
[1:46:20] man.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; This was a holy man.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; And he's going by our place continually.
[1:46:30] And so the scripture says that she
[1:46:32] constrained him.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; She was a great woman. She was great
[1:46:38] because of her character. And she
[1:46:40] constrained him.
[1:46:43] And I was looking at that word
[1:46:45] constrained. It was that she was
[1:46:48] courageous and she prevailed upon him.
[1:46:52] She was resolute.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; She wasn't going to receive no for an
[1:46:56] answer. She was already resolved and
[1:46:59] resolute that this man must come in. and
[1:47:03] and and that she could her prayer was
[1:47:06] for no her her
[1:47:08] uh expression was for no personal gain.
[1:47:13] She didn't want him in to get anything.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; She didn't want him in because she had a
[1:47:18] certain desire for anything. She had no
[1:47:21] self-interest whatsoever. Her whole
[1:47:24] desire was to pour out a blessing upon
[1:47:28] this one who she perceived is a holy man
[1:47:32] of God.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; So many people come to the message this
[1:47:36] man.
[1:47:37] I need this. I want that. I need my
[1:47:40] family fixed. I need my marriage fixed.
[1:47:42] I need my kids. I need this. I need
[1:47:44] something financial. I need something.
[1:47:45] That's not the program.
[1:47:48] The program isn't what we need. What I
[1:47:51] want my desire. my me this that. That's
[1:47:56] not the program. And that's why many I'm
[1:47:58] announcing to you, you don't get it.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; That's not the program. The program is
[1:48:04] what can I do for him? What can I do for
[1:48:08] this word? What can I do for this
[1:48:10] message? How can I pour out my life for
[1:48:13] it?
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; It's not what he can do for me.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; She saw him not once. She saw him go by.
[1:48:26] Everything's in order.
[1:48:28] She talks to her husband. She's a very
[1:48:30] courageous woman. She's resolute. She
[1:48:33] can put on the pressure.
[1:48:36] She says to this man with double the
[1:48:38] spirit of Elijah on him. She constrains
[1:48:42] him.
[1:48:45] She had it in her. I just want to I want
[1:48:48] to give him a rest. See this man go by
[1:48:52] he's a holy man
[1:48:58] and the Bible says he comes in.
[1:49:05] We'll continue to read
[1:49:08] verse 11. And it fell on a day
[1:49:11] that he came hither and he turned into
[1:49:13] the chamber and lay there.
[1:49:16] And he said to Gahhesa
[1:49:19] his servant called this Junomite. And
[1:49:22] when he had called her, she stood before
[1:49:24] him.
[1:49:26] And he said unto and he said unto him to
[1:49:29] his servant, see now to her, behold,
[1:49:33] thou hast been careful for us with all
[1:49:36] this care. What is to be done for thee?
[1:49:39] Would you that we uh be spoken to for to
[1:49:43] the king
[1:49:45] or to the captain of the host?
[1:49:48] That's the senior officers of the army.
[1:49:51] And she answered, "I dwell among my own
[1:49:55] people." Now, I want you to look this
[1:49:56] way again.
[1:50:01] Elisha said,
[1:50:04] "Thou has been careful for us with all
[1:50:07] this care."
[1:50:09] And I took my Hebrew Bible and reading
[1:50:14] in the Greek linear Hebrew Bible
[1:50:18] says, "And you have been careful."
[1:50:20] And the Hebrew says, "And and you have
[1:50:23] trembled."
[1:50:25] And my eyes fastened on that because I'm
[1:50:28] already in the whole spirit of the
[1:50:30] service. I'm in what God is saying to
[1:50:32] me. And you have trembled.
[1:50:35] I was, how is that?
[1:50:38] And I I went and I I was studying that.
[1:50:42] And the scripture says very very clearly
[1:50:45] in the Hebrew that you have approached
[1:50:48] us trembling.
[1:50:51] you've approached us trembling with
[1:50:53] desire to serve. She came with such
[1:50:57] reverence.
[1:50:59] She just didn't say, "Oh, I see he's a
[1:51:02] man of God. I see, you know, this is a
[1:51:03] pastor. I see this as a prophet. I that
[1:51:06] that and that's probably why God left
[1:51:08] this as a record for us." She didn't
[1:51:10] say, "Oh, this great Elisha is going
[1:51:13] by." She wasn't influenced by that. She
[1:51:16] wasn't influenced by some high position
[1:51:19] that he held. She didn't know maybe that
[1:51:21] he knew the king. She didn't know that
[1:51:24] he knew the head of the army. For the
[1:51:26] prophets in those days were very well
[1:51:29] connected.
[1:51:31] She just sees he's a holy man. This is a
[1:51:34] holy man.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Come.
[1:51:39] You must eat here. I see you go by and I
[1:51:44] won't receive. I I can't receive no for
[1:51:47] an answer.
[1:51:48] This is where you pass by continually
[1:51:51] and you must Hey, is that a big thing?
[1:51:54] God put that in his word.
[1:51:56] She wanted him to eat. And every time
[1:51:59] then he went by, he turned in there
[1:52:07] and he's laying on his bed, the bed that
[1:52:10] she had her husband make.
[1:52:13] Called the woman, gaze, I called a
[1:52:15] woman. She stood in the door. What can
[1:52:17] we do for you? Gazes ask her.
[1:52:21] Can we say something to the king on your
[1:52:23] behalf?
[1:52:26] How about the head of the army? Can we
[1:52:27] say something to the head of the
[1:52:28] authorities here for you?
[1:52:31] She said, I just live here among my
[1:52:33] people.
[1:52:38] Gesa said, she hasn't got a child.
[1:52:43] She has no child.
[1:52:51] And he said,
[1:52:53] "What then can be done?" Verse 14. And
[1:52:56] Gahesa answered, "Verily, she hath no
[1:52:59] child and her husband is old." And he
[1:53:02] said, "Call her." And when he called
[1:53:04] her, verse 15, "She stood in the door."
[1:53:07] And he said, "About this season
[1:53:10] according to the time of life, thou
[1:53:12] shalt embrace a son." And she said,
[1:53:15] "Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not
[1:53:20] lie unto thine handmmaid." That wasn't
[1:53:22] being disrespectful. Says, "And the
[1:53:24] woman conceived and bear a son at that
[1:53:27] season that Elisha had said unto her
[1:53:30] according to the time of life. And when
[1:53:33] the child was grown, it fell on a day
[1:53:35] that he went out with to his father to
[1:53:38] the reapers. And he said unto his
[1:53:40] father, "My head, my head." And he said
[1:53:43] to the lad, "Carry him to his mother."
[1:53:46] And when he had taken him and brought
[1:53:48] him to his mother, he sat on her knees
[1:53:52] till noon and then died.
[1:53:56] and she went up and laid him on the bed
[1:54:00] of the man of God and shut the door upon
[1:54:03] him and went out. Now I want you to look
[1:54:06] this way. Okay.
[1:54:14] I had to ask myself
[1:54:17] reading this account,
[1:54:20] how many of us would have done that?
[1:54:26] And I had to be honest,
[1:54:28] say probably very, very, very few if
[1:54:31] any.
[1:54:35] If it had been my son,
[1:54:40] I don't know if I I don't know if I'd
[1:54:42] have gone and laid him on the prophet's
[1:54:43] sleeping bag.
[1:54:48] And this woman, this mother,
[1:54:51] her boy, they say about 12 years old,
[1:54:55] died on her knees.
[1:54:59] I can see her pick him up.
[1:55:03] She's still that resolute woman.
[1:55:08] takes that dead form,
[1:55:15] lays it on the prophet's bed,
[1:55:21] goes out and closes the door.
[1:55:24] Didn't say that she wept and wailed and
[1:55:27] got into emotional hysteria,
[1:55:31] calling on God.
[1:55:34] She closed the door
[1:55:38] and called for her husband.
[1:55:46] And she said,
[1:55:53] and she went up,
[1:55:56] laid him on the bed of the man of God,
[1:55:57] and closed the door and went out. And
[1:55:59] she called unto her husband. I want you
[1:56:01] to notice very carefully
[1:56:04] and said, "Send me, I pray, the one of
[1:56:07] the young men and one of the asses that
[1:56:11] I may run to the man of God and come
[1:56:14] again."
[1:56:16] Look this way.
[1:56:19] There's no record that she even told her
[1:56:23] husband the boy died.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; It's not in the scripture.
[1:56:30] There's no record. She said to call her
[1:56:33] husband. Send me one of the young men.
[1:56:36] Send me one of the asses.
[1:56:39] I'm going to the man of God.
[1:56:42] And even her husband said, and he said,
[1:56:45] "Why will you go
[1:56:48] to him today? It is neither new moon nor
[1:56:52] Sabbath." And she said, "It shall be
[1:56:55] well." He said, "This isn't the Lord's
[1:56:57] day. This isn't a holy day. This isn't
[1:57:01] some Sabbath or new moon. Why are you
[1:57:03] going to the man of God?
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; She hasn't told him
[1:57:08] our son died.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Now you know,
[1:57:14] you can see early in her actions and
[1:57:17] early in her words, there's the seeds of
[1:57:21] resurrection are right there.
[1:57:24] Amen.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; And that seed of resurrection, that seed
[1:57:29] of life is still in her. Why? Because of
[1:57:33] her respect
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; for the man of quad. And God looks upon
[1:57:37] it and tells and says that record in his
[1:57:41] own mind. That record shall go down as a
[1:57:44] permanent record for all peoples of all
[1:57:47] time. This is what I honor. It'll be in
[1:57:50] the word of God clearly.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; That's my form.
[1:57:55] Amen.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; It shall be well.
[1:58:03] Verse 24.
[1:58:06] And then she saddled an ass and said to
[1:58:08] her servant, "Drive and go forward and
[1:58:11] slack not thy writing for me except that
[1:58:14] I bid thee." So she went and came unto
[1:58:17] the man of God to Mount Carmel. And it
[1:58:20] came to pass, I tell you. She wasn't
[1:58:23] riding in a in a in in one of our modern
[1:58:26] automobiles, air conditioned. She's
[1:58:29] telling her young the young man that's
[1:58:32] driving, "You drive and go go hard and
[1:58:35] don't ease up for me. I'll tell you if I
[1:58:38] need you to slow down. Just keep going."
[1:58:41] And when the man of God saw her a far
[1:58:43] off, he said to Gahhesi his servant,
[1:58:46] behold yonder is that Chunomite, run
[1:58:50] now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say
[1:58:52] unto her, Is it well with thee? Is it
[1:58:54] well with thy husband? Is it well with
[1:58:56] thy child? And she answered, "It is
[1:58:59] well."
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:03] woman hasn't even told her husband that
[1:59:04] the boy's dead and he's laying up on the
[1:59:07] prophet's bed and she's on her way to
[1:59:10] Mount Carmel.
[1:59:12] Is it well with you? Is it well with
[1:59:13] your husband? Is it well with your son?
[1:59:16] It is well. And thus we have the song. I
[1:59:18] don't know if you even know it. You sing
[1:59:20] it all the time. It is well. It is well.
[1:59:23] That's why all is well.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; The brides heard the message. All is
[1:59:28] well.
[1:59:32] And when verse 27, and when she came to
[1:59:35] the man of God to the hill,
[1:59:38] she caught him
[1:59:41] by the feet.
[1:59:47] She caught him
[1:59:50] by the feet.
[1:59:53] You might say that was customary at that
[1:59:55] time. That doesn't say so.
[1:59:59] She's being driven
[2:00:01] by one thing and that is her honor and
[2:00:05] respect
[2:00:06] for the man of God. And she caught him
[2:00:10] by the feet. But Gahesa came to thrust
[2:00:13] her away.
[2:00:15] And the man of God said, "Let her alone,
[2:00:18] for her soul is vexed within her, and
[2:00:20] the Lord hath hid it from me and hath
[2:00:22] not told me." Then she said, "Did I
[2:00:26] desire a son of my Lord? Did I not say,
[2:00:29] "Do not deceive me."
[2:00:31] And then he said to Cahesi,
[2:00:34] "G up thy loins, and take my staff in
[2:00:36] thine hand, and go thy way. If thou meet
[2:00:39] any man, salute him not. And if any
[2:00:41] salute thee, answer him not again, and
[2:00:44] lay my staff upon the face of the
[2:00:46] child." And the mother of the child
[2:00:48] said, "As the Lord God, as the Lord
[2:00:51] liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will
[2:00:54] not leave thee."
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he arose and followed her.
[2:01:02] And Gahesi passed on before them, and
[2:01:04] laid the staff upon the face of the
[2:01:06] child, and there was neither voice nor
[2:01:09] hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet
[2:01:12] him, and told him, saying, The child is
[2:01:14] not awake. And when Elisha was come into
[2:01:18] the house, behold, the child was dead,
[2:01:21] and laid upon his bed. He went into He
[2:01:24] went in therefore and shut the door upon
[2:01:28] them twain and prayed unto the Lord. And
[2:01:31] he went up and lay upon the child and
[2:01:33] put his mouth upon his mouth and his
[2:01:35] eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon
[2:01:38] his hands. And he stretched himself upon
[2:01:41] the child and the flesh of the child
[2:01:43] waxed warm. And then he returned and
[2:01:46] walked to the in the house to and fro
[2:01:49] and went up and stretched himself upon
[2:01:52] the child.
[2:01:54] And the child sneezed seven times. And
[2:01:56] the child opened his eyes. And he called
[2:02:00] Gahhesi and said, "Call this Shunomite."
[2:02:04] So he called her. And when she was come
[2:02:07] in unto him, he said, "Take up thy son."
[2:02:12] That's what he told her to do. take up
[2:02:14] thy son. Then she went in and fell at
[2:02:18] his feet and bowed herself to the ground
[2:02:21] and took up her son and went out.
[2:02:28] This is an incredible. You might say,
[2:02:30] why have I lingered and why have I
[2:02:32] detailed this in such a way? Simply
[2:02:34] because we're people of habit. We're
[2:02:37] creatures of habit. We live a life in a
[2:02:40] certain order, etc.
[2:02:43] There's no record that this woman had
[2:02:46] the custom of doing that.
[2:02:49] But she identified
[2:02:52] a man with with such respect
[2:02:57] that she laid hold on more than one
[2:03:00] occasion and held him, caught him, and
[2:03:05] held him by the feet.
[2:03:09] He takes his staff and says, "Ghesi,
[2:03:12] go and lay this on the child."
[2:03:15] She said, "As the Lord liveth and as thy
[2:03:18] soul liveth,
[2:03:21] I will not let you go.
[2:03:25] You must come."
[2:03:33] That persuaded him.
[2:03:36] It wasn't that. I believe all of that
[2:03:38] happened to give us a full a full scope,
[2:03:43] a full picture of what was in that
[2:03:46] woman. And I personally believe
[2:03:51] this generation, friends, I hope I can
[2:03:54] conclude. I want to conclude the service
[2:03:56] in the next few minutes. This generation
[2:03:59] is a very disrespectful generation.
[2:04:03] This generation does not teach respect.
[2:04:07] Not of authorities.
[2:04:09] People don't respect
[2:04:12] school. Children are not taught to
[2:04:13] respect the teachers. The public do not
[2:04:17] respect peace officers. Police which we
[2:04:20] have several here.
[2:04:22] We we are not raised in homes to
[2:04:25] actually respect parents.
[2:04:29] say children,
[2:04:31] young people, I'm going to just tell you
[2:04:34] quickly. I hope I have sufficient time.
[2:04:36] Are you listening?
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; God gave me a position
[2:04:43] and my father worked for me.
[2:04:47] He was my employee. He was probably the
[2:04:50] lowest man on that totem and I was the
[2:04:52] president.
[2:04:55] But I'll just tell you, when he and I
[2:04:57] got together in the business, in the
[2:05:01] office, he was my daddy.
[2:05:05] He was my father. And I came out of his
[2:05:08] loins.
[2:05:09] And I respected him.
[2:05:12] And I had all kinds of people come and
[2:05:14] say, "I wish I had that relationship."
[2:05:19] You're like a brother. You two are like
[2:05:20] brothers.
[2:05:22] We had a wonderful relationship.
[2:05:25] But I never even knew I was a man,
[2:05:27] married man with children coming up into
[2:05:29] their teens. He was my father and I
[2:05:33] respected him as my father. I respected
[2:05:36] what he said and he respected me as a
[2:05:39] son. I wasn't just some, you know, piece
[2:05:42] of dirt. He respected me and that
[2:05:47] influenced me.
[2:05:50] Respect is connected to influence. You
[2:05:54] can't be influenced by something you
[2:05:56] don't respect. So now I come to this
[2:05:58] man, this one we call the son of man,
[2:06:03] Jesus Christ revealed.
[2:06:07] How deep is the respect? How do we
[2:06:09] respond to it?
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to go up these
[2:06:15] doors today with a change of heart and a
[2:06:19] change of of of of maybe your response
[2:06:22] and the way you treat this word.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; I've said it many times. I've said it at
[2:06:28] conventions, the tapes. That's not
[2:06:31] background music.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; That's not something just for someone to
[2:06:36] be carrying on some noise in the room.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; That's God's messenger.
[2:06:42] coming with thus saith the Lord and the
[2:06:45] presence of God. And he said, you know,
[2:06:48] I I I even said to the Lord this
[2:06:50] morning, I said, you're never one time,
[2:06:53] not one time were you ashamed, oh mighty
[2:06:57] God, to come and present yourself right
[2:07:00] there. No matter what the name of the
[2:07:02] title of the sermon was, every time that
[2:07:04] he that he called a people before him,
[2:07:07] you were there. You were there. You
[2:07:09] revealed the secret of their heart. You
[2:07:11] were there. in attendance and you know
[2:07:13] nothing about time. Same God that was
[2:07:15] theirs right here at this moment, the
[2:07:18] same time. If he could find in us the
[2:07:20] same respect,
[2:07:22] the same honor,
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; the same coming and taking him by the
[2:07:27] feet as it were, the feet of the son of
[2:07:30] man, you'll find your life turn around.
[2:07:33] You'll find you won't even have to ask
[2:07:35] for blessings. They will come.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; The woman didn't say, "My son died. My
[2:07:41] son died. Come, oh prophet, my son died.
[2:07:45] No, rather, she said, "Everything's
[2:07:47] fine. All is well,
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; but I'm here and I've got you by the
[2:07:52] feet."
[2:07:55] He knew something. He even said, "God
[2:07:57] has held it from me. I don't know what's
[2:07:59] happened." Gesa, take the stick, lay it
[2:08:02] upon the son because he saw that she was
[2:08:04] vexed.
[2:08:06] Said, "I won't let you go.
[2:08:09] You must come.
[2:08:11] I can tell you friends, that's the only
[2:08:13] way you're ever going to get anything.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; That's the only way you really really
[2:08:21] get something from God is our approach.
[2:08:27] Our respect.
[2:08:33] I'm going to be closing right away,
[2:08:36] especially for young people, not just
[2:08:38] young people.
[2:08:40] I see it.
[2:08:43] I flip through the newspaper. I don't
[2:08:45] get one to my door, but they bring a
[2:08:47] couple rags there.
[2:08:49] I see magazines on the airplane.
[2:08:52] I see it and I see the styles and the
[2:08:56] you know
[2:08:58] that become popular. I see things that
[2:09:00] become popular
[2:09:02] right away. I want to go into the other
[2:09:04] realm. I want to go into that realm of
[2:09:06] the spirit. And I say to myself, who
[2:09:10] inspired this? Who actually brought this
[2:09:13] on?
[2:09:15] I hear certain phrases and you know,
[2:09:17] we're we're a a a a joke laughter
[2:09:21] generation and not a not a whole lot of
[2:09:24] respect. Very very little. One thing I
[2:09:27] want to compliment you, the people here.
[2:09:29] I believe that there's a great wonderful
[2:09:32] respect amongst the people. But
[2:09:34] nevertheless, Brother Lance's last
[2:09:36] service was a was a quiet, very, very
[2:09:41] deep, thoughtful time for all of us. It
[2:09:44] was a serious service of how we speak
[2:09:46] and what comes out of our mouth. And I
[2:09:48] want to take that just a step further.
[2:09:50] Not only what you say, but you might not
[2:09:53] even say a word, but it's how you act
[2:09:56] and how you feel towards one another.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:01] And it's something I want you to this
[2:10:03] isn't something you can just
[2:10:04] self-generate,
[2:10:06] but it's something you want to keep on
[2:10:07] your mind. Say God sent our pastor to
[2:10:11] speak about this today and then and
[2:10:15] you're not respecting a person, not
[2:10:17] respecting a person for what they've
[2:10:19] achieved or what they've accomplished or
[2:10:21] for how they look. You're you're
[2:10:24] respecting them saying God before the
[2:10:28] foundation of the world saw this
[2:10:30] individual
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; and sent Jesus Christ to go to Calvary
[2:10:35] and have his heart stabbed and have the
[2:10:38] blood which was the purchased price to
[2:10:41] buy them and sent them at this time to
[2:10:45] sit in the same church with me and to be
[2:10:48] my brother and to be my sister to be my
[2:10:51] friend to be my my associate. Oh God,
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; let me respect them.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; And in so doing, you're respecting the
[2:11:01] whole plan of God.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; You're respecting the whole the whole
[2:11:07] plan.
[2:11:09] So you're respect you're actually
[2:11:10] respecting God because he's the one who
[2:11:14] who did all this. He's the one who sent
[2:11:15] them.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; He's the one who gave the gift. He's the
[2:11:18] one who gave the talent.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen. Amen.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not here by my own choosing.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; I would far sooner be someplace else.
[2:11:28] I'm not here by my own choosing. It's
[2:11:31] not me that wants to sit till late till
[2:11:33] midnight on a Saturday night and through
[2:11:35] the week. It's not it's not it's it's
[2:11:38] not you that necessarily want to be be
[2:11:39] here and grind through the
[2:11:42] through the border as you do for the and
[2:11:45] whatever more and move and pull up roots
[2:11:48] and be transferred and
[2:11:51] hey friends it's not because of you know
[2:11:55] just some person not because you just
[2:11:57] have some desire but there's a certain
[2:11:59] kind of respect am I making sense to you
[2:12:02] this morning and and I'm telling you
[2:12:04] that as you honor that you're honoring
[2:12:06] God and God's blessings come upon a
[2:12:09] person and you can't you can't even
[2:12:12] describe the blessings. Where are they
[2:12:13] coming from? I don't know. They just
[2:12:15] come.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; It comes upon your family. It comes upon
[2:12:18] your comes upon your home. It comes upon
[2:12:21] every aspect. And I'd say I'd say to you
[2:12:23] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:25] before God, if you catch the key and the
[2:12:27] secret of what I'm saying to you this
[2:12:29] morning, your life will be at peace.
[2:12:33] Your life will be greatly rewarded and
[2:12:36] you'll be able to say whatever the
[2:12:38] circumstances, you'll be able to say,
[2:12:40] "All is well."
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't he lovely?
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; It's all well this morning.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; You can say, "All is well."
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[2:13:08] We just bow reverently.
[2:13:18] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:13:23] We're praying to the God that is not
[2:13:27] only with us but is in us.
[2:13:32] Lord Jesus,
[2:13:36] Father God, in your in your design,
[2:13:42] and I'm seeking just to grasp in my
[2:13:45] mind, in my soul, my inner being.
[2:13:50] You've called us here. That's why we're
[2:13:53] we're not just a a bunch of humans
[2:13:56] crawling over the face of the earth, but
[2:13:59] we have been sent here by design.
[2:14:03] We've sent been sent here according to a
[2:14:06] plan. And you have written the script
[2:14:10] for this plan. You have laid it out. If
[2:14:14] it was a if it was a flowchart, you laid
[2:14:17] out the flowchart how that we should
[2:14:19] come in a certain season and we would
[2:14:23] interact with others in the same season.
[2:14:26] We we would have a certain desire which
[2:14:28] would come from you and it would cause
[2:14:31] us to make certain choices and send us
[2:14:33] in a certain direction. We would meet a
[2:14:36] certain person and oh God and that would
[2:14:40] have an effect and our lives would have
[2:14:42] an influence. And now we find ourselves
[2:14:44] here this morning. And I am I'm
[2:14:47] declaring to these people, the same one
[2:14:49] that stood there with the prophet
[2:14:51] messenger this day. You stood at the
[2:14:53] platform. You revealed the secret of the
[2:14:56] heart and you're still a revealer of the
[2:14:58] secrets of the hearts. Lord, you know
[2:15:00] what the people were thinking when they
[2:15:02] came in this morning. You know what
[2:15:04] they've gone through in the last week.
[2:15:05] And you know better, oh God, than any of
[2:15:08] us ever know what's going to be in the
[2:15:09] next five minutes. What's going to be
[2:15:11] this day? what's going to be tomorrow. I
[2:15:14] pray, oh God, you'll find hearts that
[2:15:17] are so pliable,
[2:15:20] hearts that are so agreeable,
[2:15:23] hearts that are so alert, oh God, let us
[2:15:27] not be dull, made dull by our
[2:15:30] environment, in this generation, in this
[2:15:32] society, oh God, but let us be
[2:15:34] quickened, I pray, quickened, quickened
[2:15:37] by your spirit and quickened by your
[2:15:39] word. I pray Lord you'll help me, oh
[2:15:43] God. And let our words, oh father, be
[2:15:47] seasoned. May they be seasoned by the
[2:15:50] Holy Spirit.
[2:15:52] May we re appreciate, Father, what you
[2:15:54] have done in this day. And may we
[2:15:57] appreciate the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:16:00] May we appreciate one another. I'm
[2:16:02] praying for young people that they might
[2:16:05] respect their parents and that parents
[2:16:07] will live honorable
[2:16:09] lives
[2:16:11] that spawn respect.
[2:16:15] Lord, may the ministry do the same. Our
[2:16:18] deacons and our trustees,
[2:16:21] may we always remember, Lord God, we are
[2:16:24] here as part of this form of this word
[2:16:28] form. for you've come in bride form
[2:16:32] also. Lord, I ask that it will be
[2:16:36] a very clear, very clear subject to the
[2:16:40] people, something they can take and
[2:16:43] partake of and digest.
[2:16:47] Ask that you will prepare us for the
[2:16:48] coming week, Lord, and the services and
[2:16:51] what is taking place, the meeting in
[2:16:53] Seattle today and the Lord's table
[2:16:56] communion next Sunday. Lord, I pray that
[2:16:59] you'll prepare us. Prepare us the name
[2:17:02] of Jesus Christ. And let your people be
[2:17:04] victorious over sin, over unbelief, over
[2:17:09] sickness, over death in the name of
[2:17:12] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[2:17:17] All is well.
[2:17:23] All is well. Heat.
[2:17:30] Heat.
[2:17:32] [Music]
[2:17:40] Heat.
[2:17:42] [Music]
[2:17:47] Heat.
[2:17:51] [Music]
[2:17:58] [Applause]
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:05] Once again,
[2:18:07] all
[2:18:11] sing it as your own testimony.
[2:18:16] [Music]
[2:18:19] We have heard the message of God.
[2:18:26] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:18:28] [Music]
[2:18:36] A perfect
[2:18:38] [Music]
[2:18:47] will
[2:18:50] for all.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; I feel that this is a very important
[2:18:56] time. I'm conscious of the time, but I
[2:18:58] don't want to be conscious of the time
[2:19:00] in relationship to his presence and what
[2:19:02] he's doing.
[2:19:04] Next Sunday, the communion is going to
[2:19:06] be at four o'clock, in case I didn't
[2:19:08] say. We're just going to have a short
[2:19:10] break between the services. So, those
[2:19:12] that have traveled up, traveled some
[2:19:14] distance, we'll be able to return home
[2:19:17] in good time,
[2:19:20] 4:00 next Sunday.
[2:19:23] [Music]
[2:19:26] I trust you'll take these words. This
[2:19:29] was really almost two services but I
[2:19:32] felt that I would
[2:19:35] go through it today.
[2:19:38] I want to sing uh it is well with my
[2:19:42] soul.
[2:19:47] You know I guess uh God allows us to
[2:19:49] have little experiences.
[2:19:52] I think this last week
[2:19:55] I possibly missed death by one second
[2:20:00] and it would have been certain death.
[2:20:04] I don't say that my family is not aware
[2:20:07] of it except my wife and one other
[2:20:09] person.
[2:20:12] But I turned to make a left turn
[2:20:16] and there was a young man walking across
[2:20:18] the intersection that never looked
[2:20:21] for traffic and I think maybe he had
[2:20:24] earphones in. I don't know. He was just
[2:20:26] going along very slowly
[2:20:28] and a huge
[2:20:31] uh gravel truck. I believe it was big
[2:20:35] semi with a pup trailer on behind
[2:20:39] and the light must have turned orange
[2:20:41] because he he booted it instead of
[2:20:46] instead of putting on the brakes and
[2:20:49] stopping. he decided to make it through
[2:20:51] the intersection and I was completely
[2:20:54] covering the entire lane
[2:20:59] and I just looked out my window and all
[2:21:02] I could see was grill of this huge truck
[2:21:07] and this boy is right in front of me
[2:21:09] about in his early 20s
[2:21:12] and I had two choices
[2:21:15] get three stay there and have that truck
[2:21:20] complete completely pulverize me with
[2:21:21] all this gravel and weight.
[2:21:25] Or run forward and strike this young man
[2:21:28] and knock him down or kill him
[2:21:32] or turn my wheel to the left
[2:21:36] and hit the traffic, which was just feet
[2:21:38] away cuz I was going nose tonose with
[2:21:41] the traffic that was parked there
[2:21:43] waiting to make the red light, the green
[2:21:46] waiting for the green light.
[2:21:49] And at that instant, the young man just
[2:21:53] saw the my car thrusting forward. And he
[2:21:56] took about three quick steps. And I gave
[2:21:59] my car the gas. It was going
[2:22:01] head-to-head with this car. And I just
[2:22:04] had enough space. I turned the wheel.
[2:22:08] And at that instant, this truck roared
[2:22:11] by, I would say, without exaggeration,
[2:22:13] between 40 and 50 mph.
[2:22:17] and it flashed
[2:22:19] and I
[2:22:22] it was improper, probably my fault,
[2:22:26] but I just drove off to the side of the
[2:22:28] road realizing
[2:22:31] [Music]
[2:22:32] that I could have been
[2:22:34] I could have been on the other side just
[2:22:36] that fast.
[2:22:39] I realize
[2:22:41] I don't want to go from week to week. I
[2:22:43] want to treasure every day. Want to
[2:22:46] treasure every moment. Want to treasure
[2:22:49] those that God has allowed us to walk
[2:22:52] together. I treasure this assembly. I
[2:22:54] treasure your love. I appreciate
[2:22:58] the dedicated
[2:23:01] consecrated lives that you live. And I
[2:23:04] speak this morning that you might know
[2:23:07] this one
[2:23:10] who's not a message as such. He's the
[2:23:13] son of man. The person. Lay hold of him.
[2:23:16] However you feel, talk to him. I'll feel
[2:23:19] rewarded if I know I can go out of this
[2:23:22] place and know that our Lord Jesus has
[2:23:24] been able now to commune with someone
[2:23:26] and have you speak to him differently
[2:23:30] and say this service would be more than
[2:23:33] sufficient for me, more than worthwhile
[2:23:35] for me. Lay hold of him.
[2:23:40] Other men were able.
[2:23:42] I want him to prophesy. lay hold of him
[2:23:44] not because you want something and say,
[2:23:47] "Oh Lord, do something for me. Oh God, I
[2:23:49] need this. I need that." Forget your
[2:23:51] needs. Say, "Lord, what do you need?
[2:23:54] What can I do for you? Here's a bed. Can
[2:23:57] I make something for you? Can I serve
[2:23:59] you?"
[2:24:02] Now you know. And I'm closing, but now
[2:24:06] you know. When I say if there's any
[2:24:08] blessing upon this congregation, if
[2:24:11] there's any blessing upon my own life,
[2:24:13] if there's any blessing that has come,
[2:24:16] it's become because of one one single
[2:24:20] purpose. And that is because I've always
[2:24:23] sought. And as a church, we've always
[2:24:25] sought to bless this word. We want to
[2:24:29] bless this channel. We want to bless
[2:24:31] this messenger's message. We want to see
[2:24:34] it get out to somebody else by living,
[2:24:38] by speaking, by doing every purpose,
[2:24:40] everything that we can do. Is this
[2:24:42] making sense to you? And I believe that
[2:24:44] when we do that, that showing respect to
[2:24:47] it. Amen. God blesses it. God bless you.
[2:24:51] God bless you. Thank you for your time.
[2:24:55] In peace
[2:24:57] life,

[2:31:36] I'm going to ask our brother Codle.
[2:31:38] Brother Codle, would you please come and
[2:31:40] pray a prayer upon the congregation,
[2:31:44] upon those that will be journeying to
[2:31:46] Seattle, upon the service down there,
[2:31:49] upon this people for this coming week?
[2:31:52] Did you receive something from God's
[2:31:54] word this morning? Can you take it? Can
[2:31:57] you act upon it? Will you come with a
[2:32:01] just an intensely
[2:32:05] sincere
[2:32:07] approach to God,
[2:32:10] real reverence.
[2:32:12] Let's have that for God's word. This is
[2:32:14] the son of man. That's why this church
[2:32:16] exists. That's what we're here for.
[2:32:19] Brother Codle, God bless you.
[2:32:24] Let's
[2:32:29] bow our hearts before the Lord.
[2:32:36] Father, we thank you today, Lord, for
[2:32:38] your mercy and your grace
[2:32:41] that you so richly bestowed upon us this
[2:32:44] day, Father.
[2:32:46] And Lord, we thank you for
[2:32:49] these people, Father, that you've drawn
[2:32:51] from the east and the west and the north
[2:32:55] and the south, Father, that you may
[2:32:57] plant within them that anointing,
[2:33:00] Father,
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; that they may be bold as children,
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; and stand before you, Lord, and with
[2:33:08] reverence and respect and honor
[2:33:11] to thy word and to thy prophet that you
[2:33:14] have sent in our generation, Lord. Oh
[2:33:18] God, we so thank you, Lord, for the man
[2:33:22] of God that you sent, Lord, to show us
[2:33:26] the way to give us an example, that we
[2:33:30] may also, Lord, humble our lives before
[2:33:34] you, Lord,
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; and respect your man. that is in this
[2:33:39] hour, Father, our pastors and the men of
[2:33:43] God that you've raised up in this
[2:33:45] congregation, Lord, that we may honor
[2:33:48] them, Father. And that, Lord, that our
[2:33:52] honor would also be for one another,
[2:33:54] Lord. For we all are part of you, Lord,
[2:33:57] each and every one of us, Lord.
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; Or that seed, that flick of fire, Lord,
[2:34:03] that flame Lord,
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; that is all of the same flame. Yes,
[2:34:08] Lord.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; And we honor one another, Lord. Respect
[2:34:11] one another. We love one another.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; Be with us, Father, as we go our
[2:34:17] separate ways. Father, we thank you for
[2:34:20] your blood now that covers us and
[2:34:22] protects us. We thank you for protecting
[2:34:25] our pastor, our shepherd,
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; the man of God of this house. Lord, we
[2:34:30] so appreciate that. And Lord, we ask you
[2:34:33] now to be with us and go with us and
[2:34:35] help us, Lord. Yes,
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; in every area of our lives, Lord, be
[2:34:40] with us this week. Bring us back safely,
[2:34:44] the Lord willing, on Wednesday evening,
[2:34:46] Father, and next week's Sunday service,
[2:34:50] Father, that you would also draw us,
[2:34:53] Father, those that we may speak to this
[2:34:56] week, Lord, that we would speak with
[2:34:58] grace upon our hearts and grace upon our
[2:35:02] words. Lord, we thank you, Father, for
[2:35:05] the privilege and the honor you've given
[2:35:07] us to be a part. And we give you all the
[2:35:10] glory and all the praise. In the name of
[2:35:13] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[2:35:17] And amen. Bless the Lord.

[2:35:39] different there. Embrace one another.
