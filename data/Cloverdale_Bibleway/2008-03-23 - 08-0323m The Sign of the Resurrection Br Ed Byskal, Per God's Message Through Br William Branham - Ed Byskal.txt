We want to remember Dave Daniels as he has a severe head and chest cold. So we want to remember him in prayer. If you have a need on your heart, just raise your hand as we go to prayer. Amen. Brother Burkart, if you would if you would come. Let's bow our hearts and our heads. Dear God, Father, we praise your holy name, oh God. And what a atmosphere we are in, Lord. You have come down and to fellowship with us, Lord. You have chosen a vessel this morning, a ministering angel, Father, where you come through and speak to our hearts, Lord. Father, we lay ourselves on the altar of sacrifice, Father, and may your Holy Spirit consume us with fire and burn all the tr out of us, Father. We know we are living at the very last time, Father. And we don't want to slack behind. We want to receive every word, Father. Obedient to every word that titles us to the token, and we claim it. We apply the token to our families and to our loved ones, Lord. Father, that the last ones can come in, Lord. This is the very moment, Lord. You restored the bright tree. You restored us, Lord. And the fullness of the word has come, Father. It shines so bright, Father. And burn everything out of us, Lord. And reveal yourself more closely, Lord. We desire more of you. That's what we are here for. Not to be seen, but to fellowship with you, Lord. Father, we commit this morning into your hand all our songs. May they be pleasing to you. The music mi uh musicians, Lord, as they play, Father, may it all be for one purpose to worship you, Father. The song leader alike, Lord. Lord, how we love you, Lord. Oh, we thank you for everything, Lord. And we believe, Lord, every promises is ours, Lord. As there have been a few requests read this morning, Lord, you know them, Father. Lord, and we believe you have already done the healing work, Father. We believe it's all in the word, Lord, in the body, Lord. And we believe those are healed by your stripes. I lay my hands on them and thank you for healing them. Thank you for touching them Lord and all the unspoken requests and Lord the desire of our hearts father. Lord we pray that you give each and everyone what they have need of. Father you said you will supply our every need. You are Jehovah Gyra.

You may have your seats. Apologize for having you stand for so long. Sometimes just hard to worship our Lord sitting down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Once again, I want to welcome everyone who's visiting with us. It's good, really good to have you. If you're on the telephone hookup or on the internet, we want to say uh God bless you to you as well. I'm glad you could join with us. And we have a baby dedication this morning. Those having their baby dedicated, why don't you come and get ready? Why don't we sing uh We'll not leave our little ones behind. for our father has. &gt;&gt; We'll not leave our little ones behind. For our father have them in mind. Oh, some are weak and some are feeble. Others may not feel their will not leave a single one behind. Oh, will God leave our little ones behind for our father. Some are weak and some are feeble. Others may not feel their single one behind. Let's sing it one more time. Oh, we'll not leave our little ones behind for our father. [Music] Some are some people. [Music] God bless you. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Full of expectation. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful also to be adding members not to the church but to the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh our brother Nikolai and sister Tanya are bringing their little one and uh she is named Alexis Victoria. Alexis's defender and Victoria of course is Victorious. The grandparents of uh Alexis are also here on both sides of the family. Is that correct? I wonder if we could have the grandparents stand. That's uh Wilheim and Maria Shon House and from Manitoba and also Wasili and Greta Agafonov. I wonder if we can have them stand. God bless you. Thank you. God bless you. I think it's uh important to recognize the grandparents. I'm a grandparent and I think all grandparents can say amen. And those of you that aren't grandparents, just wait a little while and you will be because young people such as uh we have here in this these parents that God has given to Alexis. They do not come by accident. And I know that the parents have a great and strong faith and have brought their children up to serve Christ. And their desire is that not only their children, but that their grandchildren and their children will come to know this Christ. Amen. In the power of his resurrection. The Bible says, "And they brought young children and uh Nikolai and Tanya, you have brought not to me, but you have brought it to Christ." That's the that's their desire. And then the disciples didn't understand and the people didn't understand why the parents were bringing the children to Jesus and they would want to have put them aside and to hold it back. They didn't think it was important. But Jesus said, "Forbid them not bring them." This is an important part. &gt;&gt; This is not a little ceremony. This is important part. We're not bringing this little one, Alexis, to some ceremony. We're bring it to Christ and Christ is here seeing this and viewing this beautiful little child. And then I wanted to say there's something there's a mystery, a secret with children that we probably would not grasp, but Jesus taught it. This mystery that's with children. And he said, "Verily I say unto you, except you be converted." Speaking to us adults now, and converted is not just repenting from sin. Except we be converted, that is have a change of mind. You know, when we become adults, we get ideas. And Jesus saying, you got to change some of those ideas and become like a little child again &gt;&gt; in simplicity and in faith. And it and there's a secret in these children except you become converted and become as little children. You shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as a little child. See, she's got her conversation. She's got the things that she's got to say. And she's not worried about me or about you or anybody else. And really, that's the way you ought to be. &gt;&gt; You ought to be able to say, "Thank you, Lord. I don't care who's around me. I'm glad for salvation. I'm glad for the blood. I'm glad for the resurrection. And you should have your thing to say like Alexis does. &gt;&gt; Become converted and become like little children. We're going to thank our Lord for Alexis. We're going to thank God that he's given her to Nikolai and Tanya. We're going to give thanks that God has given her. And we're going to pray that God will not only bless her, but make her a blessing in this home. You think she'll come to me? &gt;&gt; You want to come to me or no? No. She says, "I trust my daddy more." All right. Well, we'll just pray for her and we'll bless her. Father, how we love this little child being held by her father. You have given her such wonderful parents and grandparents that are here to witness this moment when we pray the blessing of almighty God upon her. I pray, Father, that she will be kept in good health. I pray that as she hears her mother and father speak of Jesus Christ. You will give her understanding. May she be a child of faith. May she be a happy child. May she bring joy to this home. And Lord, I pray now that you will receive her as you have given her. I pray, Father, now you'll receive my prayer as I dedicate her to you in the name of Jesus Christ. And may the blessings of Jesus Christ be upon her for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Alexis. God bless you, Tanya. Bless you, Nikolai. Amen. Amen. Amen. Our sister Les Leanne and her group have a song if you want to come and get ready at this time. Why don't we sing number uh 3:21? Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary. Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary, [Music] pure and holy, tried and true. With thanksgiving, I'll be a living sanctuary for you. [Music] [Music] [Music] I saw the su go down [Music] and in it darkness. [Music] I saw the grains of wheat a [Music] saw a little sunlight at [Music] A little more than a little more, then a little more sunlight than before. But at the breaking of a brand new dawn, I saw the fullness. I remembered what God had done for me when he took my sary. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for faithful resurrection, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a blessed consolation. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; When I found nothing of worth in me, &gt;&gt; you broke the seals at Calvary. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace, how sweet the Lord. &gt;&gt; We were lost, but now we're found. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And there is nothing wrong. Thank you Lord for the rising of the sun. [Music] I saw the s go down and I see a road before Paul left at Ephesus. He said there appear grievous wolves. The serpent found a way to break the son's influence. He preached his doctrines of life. eyes. So down and down the gospel went. He showed a little light in Sam, but many saw him at Pogamos, but the less light in Thotyra age and Lut saw him in Sadd. And it was 1750. [Music] A man by the name John Wesley. He caught a little sunlight in Philadelphia and many saw him at le [Music] one foot on sea and one on land. the fullness of the sun in the sun. Thanks for revelation 107. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; That man called William Brham. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; He took this mystery of this risen son &gt;&gt; to every king and nation. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace how sweet the sound. They that were lost, then they were found. &gt;&gt; He gave the blind the eyes to see, and they were thankful for the rising of the sun. Shalom. It's now the bright age. to his elect. It's the brightest day. We see light in this evening time. Our pathway to glory we have found. We know it's no longer a oneman ministry. The sun has risen in you and me. Revelation 108 to 11 upon us. This gospel has risen. And at the breaking of the brand new dawn, we were called out by this risen son. We have the sun in reality. We have our own testimony. We'll slip from time into eternity. From this mortal to immortality. [Music] Walk on streets in pure white. There the lamb will be the light. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. We that were lost. Now we are found. He broke the bondage from all our lives and presented at the lamb's wife. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. We were lost, but now we're found. He broke the seals from all the lies and present us at the land. Oh, we thank you, Lord. You rose from the dead. You fill us with your Holy Ghost. And we thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. You brought the seals. You called us. Oh, we thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. [Music] the song that Leah sang all I want to see. Amen. There's been a song that's been on my uh mind too that I would like to just lead into the service and I have a few comments to make before we come to the word this morning. So I hope you're not in a big hurry. Uh this is an important Sunday, &gt;&gt; important time remembering the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. If it wasn't for that, we wouldn't be here. we wouldn't have anything to sing about or worship about or to preach about. Uh some time ago, uh brother John Lee, I think and Joanna sang a song, All I Want to See Is Jesus. And uh it's 10:41 in the in the book, but those of you that know it, I wonder if you could sing it with me. And I just going to sing a a chorus or maybe if you know the verse, we could sing it. And then I have some comments and then I want to sing the chorus again. Brother Jason, would you stand with me and help me sing that? &gt;&gt; Do you want to sing the first verse? &gt;&gt; All I want to see is Jesus. That's a chorus. Just a chorus. &gt;&gt; All I want to see is Jesus. [Music] All I want to see is all I want to see is Jesus shining through. &gt;&gt; Why don't everyone stand as we sing that? &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see Jesus. All I want to see is the baby. Oh, I want to see Jesus shine through. Oh, what I want to see is Jesus. Yes, I want to see his name. It's all I want to see. Is Jesus shining through thee? &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that your yearning desire? All I want to see is Jesus shining through me. We'll just have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, as we stand here today, each of us having our own re relationship with you, we want to enter into a a closer relationship. We want to be drawn closer to you, Lord. We want you to speak secrets to your bride. Speak secrets, Lord, to each one of us. Tell us, oh God, the things that you'd want us to hear. Speak to us this morning, Father, out of your word and out of the things that are taking place around us. Move us, I pray, to another realm, another place, another dimension in Christ. Lord, you see our desires, our hearts craving. I pray today you'll give utterance to your word. I pray father in the name of Jesus you'll give good ground for the seed to fall into. I pray father you will empower us now as we speak in the name of Jesus and bind every evil power. We bind, oh God, every restrictive, every restriction, everything that the enemy would try to do and bring into captivity every thought to the mind of Christ in the name of Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit. Deliver your word, I pray. Father, I submit and surrender myself to you. I pray that you'll be glorified in you alone. No flesh shall glory in your presence. We will simply glorify the name of Jesus Christ and say we desire that you live in us Lord. Live in us I pray and have the preeminence for your glory in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you. Do you mind standing just a moment before we read the scripture? I want to uh just say a few words about the events of this last week. Uh perhaps I will have you sit down. This may take a little longer than I thought. There are times when God seems to uh set us on the sidelines and he takes absolute control of a situation or of events and you can all you can do is stand back and watch it happen. All you can do is stand back and confess we don't have anything to do with this. You've all experienced that. Sometimes something takes place in your life and you just simply don't have any control of it. It's God and God alone that's directing the affairs. This last week has been one of those times. I thought I should tell this congregation and those that are streaming and all that may hear this service how the connection took place. And I I ask God to give added grace to the O'Brien family, uh, and those that are here, the Douly family, the Stevens, because I have just a few comments, and I feel that I I feel I need to make these comments. After the accident took place, my wife and I went to spend time with the O'Brien family early in the morning and we spent about an hour and then it was very early and then we made our way home and were going to have some breakfast. My wife started to prepare breakfast and I became very very unsettled and uneasy within myself and I I felt compelled. I must go up to the site. I must go up. Uh and yet I knew because we had heard on the news already that it's completely sealed off. 16th Avenue was completely sealed off from 256th Street to 200 uh to to 264th Street and the accident took place at 258th Street. So I knew it was a a sealed accident scene and there was no access whatsoever to get there. I knew that. But yet I was so and I began to pace back and forth while my wife is preparing breakfast and I'm pacing. I am being so compelled. I must I must uh I I must get up there and I didn't know why. And my mind was saying there's no use because you can't get anywhere near it anyway. So I didn't know in my mind I didn't know why I was having this uh urge and it was an urge I could not put down and so we sat at breakfast and I can actually say I I I ate with hur so hurriedly and I thought this is you know why am I doing this but I was being and I knew it was something spiritual that was going on but I had no clue what what it was whatsoever. ever. And and I just told my wife, I have to go. Do you care to come? She said, "Yes, well, I'll go with you." So, we drove up and as we arrived to where the first initial police car was, and I could see further up the road, there were other crew uh police cruisers and some activity maybe 400 meters, 400 yards up the road. And then I noticed as I was coming up to where the barricades were, I saw that there was a small group of people that were gathered. And I thought, well, maybe just residents or people that are coming along on the road. And you know, something like this attracts people. And so I I came up and and then I started to turn because there were several cars parked and I had to turn down a street down 256th Street to park my car. And as I was just turning slowly, I saw then some of these people had cameras and uh oh, I thought that was the first time entered my mind. Excuse me. Thought, oh uh yeah, I guess there's some reporters here probably waiting. I saw their big lens cameras and they were just mingling and talking to each other. And I thought, okay, yeah, I I guess of course they'd be interested in taking some uh uh making some report of this accident. maybe they're waiting for a, you know, a toll truck or who knows what to happen and they're just sitting there mingling around each other. And so, uh, I said to my wife, I'm just going to go and speak to the police officer that's in the car. And so I just made my way and I just these people were all just talking amongst themselves and so and I just made my way through them and through the barricade uh which had an opening and came up to the police cruiser parked a few meters inside and uh it was a woman officer and she put her cap on and stepped out of the car and said can I help you? And I just told her, I said, "I'm the pastor of the three young men that were in the in this truck, and I'd like I said, I am familiar with the process, but I thought perhaps I might be able to get up and take some pictures of of the scene, and for the family's sake, so the family could have that if they wished." She said, "I can't let you go up there. I'm sorry." And I said, 'I realize, you know, I realize there's an investigation uh underway and I'm well aware of that, but I said, I thought maybe you could let me go up there. And she said, "No, I I wish I could." She's very nice. I I wish I could, but I just can't. And I said, "Okay, I I understand." And we just talked for a few more moments. I was probably with her five 10 minutes. And as I turned around and began to go back to my car, uh the reporters and the cameras, they they formed I just faced a complete wall, a horseshoe, a horseshoe wall of reporters. So, and they were right at the barricade where I could only go out. So, I I just stepped out and I just faced these and they said, "Are you a resident in the area?" because they didn't know why I would be speaking to the police officer. I said, "No, I'm not a resident. I'm I'm the pastor of these three young men." Well, it was just like you ignited uh lit a match to the gasoline and they were just questions flew from every direction and the cameras were rolling and everything and uh they said, "Well, do you know the family?" And I said, "Yes." "And have you been with the family?" "Yes." and you know and and all I want to say I just want to tell you that that's where the connection was made and they said well can we contact the family and I said no you mustn't contact the family and uh can we call you I said well yes you can call me if you wish uh I said you know here's my numbers and then I I left them well there was questions for a few minutes probably another 10 minutes and then I I excused myself and we left. Well, by the time I got here to the church, I drove then to the church to the church office and the phones were literally ringing off the wall and there was already uh four reporters had called. And while I was talking to one of those, another two reporters called and this was just within within 30 minutes, I suppose, of that time. and and I saw them on the phones and they were already on their cell phones making sending in their stories. And so when I look back and when we look back, I thought I just wanted to tell the congregation this because what was to become a media event actually became a mar a message event. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want you to you can put that phrase and tuck it away in your heart if you wish. God ordained, I believe, that original contact because he wanted to swing it, index it from the actual tragedy to something that had a spiritual impact. And I want to say to the congregation, you and I on this side of eternity will never be able to weigh the impact that it has had. In fact, is I spoke with more than one reporter, but one in particular of the main uh one of the main national uh media connections and he said to me, he said, "We're" and he went with with his hand this way. He said, "We're caught in this." literally caught in it. Also, another reporter said, "This is the only thing that we're talking about." And this is several days later, two, three days later. And they were somewhat, I will, I guess I could use a few words because I was trying to describe it as it be to take place, unfold. They were captivated. Then when they began to see the incredible strength, spiritual strength that was in the family and all that were involved. Then they wanted to come to Sunday morning service and I told them we have a very long service. I don't know if you want to set up. Well, yeah, they thought that they would, but the lady who was in charge of the whole thing for Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said, "Well, I'll talk to them to see because it took about three, four people with the truck and everything." And I said, "You know," she said, "Well, you don't want the meeting disturbed." I said, "Absolutely not. If they come here and set up a camera, they need to be here for the whole service." And uh so she said, "Well, I'll talk to them." So then I wrote it off. I said they're they're not going to come here and and you know put the whole service and even if they tape it, even if they put five minutes or use five minutes, they need to see what five minutes they want. So they're going to tape. They have to sit here for the whole thing. And I wrote it off. It wasn't until Sunday morning I learned early. They're going to be there. They're going to have the truck here and the camera people are going to be here and Canadian Broadcasting is going to going to be in the morning service and God was here. You know, God was here and I know God was here and God took over that service. They became captivated. They became fascinated. They became mesmerized. They became intrigued. What is it that these people possess? And doors blew open from every direction. And I can say about the media if they are listening or will hear this I want to commend them because I hear people you know almost with antagonistic against the media because they said they can't get anything right. &gt;&gt; I want to say to the media this time they didn't get anything wrong. &gt;&gt; They quoted the they quoted the speakers. They quoted the family. They quoted myself and they quoted it accurately and graciously and uh in fact is uh the one national television uh broadcast used these words concerning the service. The aura of strong faith in the face of terrible tragedy permeated the entire service that was marked not by uncontrollable weeping and crushing grief but by soaring hymns, articulate speakers, an unshakable feeling that Silas O'Brien was in a better place. Michelle O'Brien sang a mother's prayer with inspirational lyrics that seemed to have the congregation spellbound not only by her voice and the strength of the lyrics but also by an appropriate admiration for her courage as a that's a national television broadcast reporting on it and it's a it's a long it's a long thing. Brother Joe Walner uh heard from part of the family that's in Hawaii. They said they they they saw it on television. I didn't know that, but they said almost the entire service was on television with just they just took a little clip out of one or two of the brothers that were saying some words and showed the entire one another another sister, a woman called from Los Angeles up here to a relative and said, "I'm watching it on television right now." Wesley Ordeal called from Atlanta, Georgia and said this this very article is in the newspaper down there. I want to say to Sister Michelle that she she actually sang her song to a nation and images of the family members in prayer. The young men with their arms around each other in prayer and dedication and comfort, comforting one another was viewed not by hundreds of thousands but even by millions of people. It was carried in a national newspaper Globe and Mail which is the same as USA Today on the state side. Silas's baptism. One of the reporters said that that was like that was the epitome. That was the highlight. And they recorded him giving his testimony. And I thought, how remarkable right at Easter time, God has put the bride on display and actually didn't only hear the words, I baptize you in true baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and send that out to the multitudes and reestablish at the very same time that a pope is pouring holy water on a Muslim to give him a baptism in the titles. and hear God through a message, through a prophet's message is restoring the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and causing them to say it. &gt;&gt; And causing them to regard it. &gt;&gt; God put it on display. &gt;&gt; You didn't do that. &gt;&gt; I didn't do that. &gt;&gt; So, I go back to that original connection and then I knew why that Holy Spirit was bringing such a compulsion upon me. I couldn't I couldn't even hardly eat my breakfast. I must get there. Didn't even come to my mind. Never even dreamed my wildest dreams there was anybody out there. I thought I just have to go. I don't know why I have to go. And then from then on, I wonder how many there are here that had an opportunity has witnessed to somebody because of this. May I see your hands? Incredible. Just incredible. Something else I want to say to the congregation. There were details. It seemed that every detail of this entire event tied back somehow to the congregation, the people in the church. Our brother Randy and sister Sharon Timberman's living out in Chilowak were have some contact and speaking to their neighbor and the subject came up because it just happened and their neighbor said, "I am the paramedic. I'm the ambulance driver that was first at the site." Brother Tom Ray's mother walked into a business place in White Rock and she knows the owners of this business and the subject came up because it's in all of the leading newspapers, front page, front page stories, front page pictures and as everybody speaking so they started speaking about it. Tom's mother said, "Well, actually," she said, "we do have I personally have a connection. My son is one of the associate ministers at the church where the young men go." And the lady said, "I and my husband are the two people in the silver Honda that stopped when they had just gone in the ditch and came and stood on the road. We're the two people that stopped and asked them if we could help and they says we're all right. And they said we just went down the road and about a moment later we saw we saw the headlights of the other pickup that came by. Every detail and you realize we don't have any control of this. This is God's in control and he wants to send uh a testimony out. I thought it's remarkable the family that the family that participated. Jake giving the eulogy. It they picked up on it and they were so impressed and they they're fascinated. They're they're somehow reaching out. What is this strength? What is this peace? Where does it come from? And all of you gave testimony to it. All of you in one way or another in your singing, in the soaring anthems, as it were, the songs, it is well with my soul, I tell you. You maybe thought you were just singing it, but it was penetrating. &gt;&gt; Penetrating men and women. not only here but far abroad. And I say to the bride's been on display. &gt;&gt; Not something in the future. She's been on display. And you will never know till eternity where it's gone and who it's affected. I want to say thank you from the depths of my heart to every person that was present, every believer for the expression of Jesus Christ, for the sisters that came so instantly and willingly and prepared food and things like that. the musicians and the songs and the singing and the people that were uh tending to the sound and to the video and to everything and streaming the service of people in Scotland, in Norway, in New Zealand, in Switzerland. I had contact with all of them just very shortly where they were being part of the whole service. And I all I can say is this is the Lord's doing &gt;&gt; and it's glorious in our eyes. &gt;&gt; And we say whatever his will is, we say so be it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Would you stand with me now and we'll read some scripture. Can you turn please to 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter and we're going to begin reading at the 12th verse. 1 Corinthians 15 verse 12. Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen? And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain. Your faith is also vain. Yay. And we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God, that he raised up Christ, whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised. And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain. Ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are are of all men most miserable, but now is Christ risen from the dead. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; And become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. Thank God he became a kinsman redeemer. For also, for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order, Christ the first fruits, afterward, they that are Christ at his coming. May God bless his word to us as you have your seats. Now, just follow me closely, please. I'm going to go as quickly as possible, but I don't want to uh I don't want to miss out on what the Holy Spirit would have for us this morning. If I may just have your full attention when Jesus Christ came, the revealing, we can say the revealing of Christ when he came and was here on earth in his short short visitation. We could we could say that his life was actually his whole life, his whole ministry as the God prophet. He wasn't a prophet of God. He was the God prophet. But he was in a son of man ministry. Son of man, which is prophet office. While he was in that office, it was a very brief ministry. He was only ministered for like about three and a half years old. Although he lived you know that 33 33 and 1/2 years yet it was that ministry that was a sign I will I want to call it a the sign of the resurrection and that's the title of the message I want to leave with you this morning the sign of the resurrection so I wish to tie together the very life and ministry of Jesus Christ in a son of man prophetic ministry was the sign of the resurrection because he wasn't going to minister that long before he would have his death, burial, and resurrection. And as Apostle Paul said, if he didn't rise, then everything's lost. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't rise, if there's no resurrection, we're of all men most miserable. If we only in this life have hope, then I say, what are we doing here? We have not merely hope but our faith is anchored in the promise of God that there is a resurrection of the dead. But now I need to make a very very strong point. It is the the the ministry of Jesus Christ in revealing himself in a prophetic ministry is the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; So I want you to mark that down. And according to his own words, the words of Jesus, he said himself that when he would reveal himself again, as the son of man, in other words, a prophet's office, he said in Luke's gospel 17 and30, which you're so acquainted with here in this church, but don't let it just uh brush off because I need to I need you to tie it together in the whole context of the message this morning. Even thus shall it be when he's describing the days of Noah and the days of Lot. And he described those days they did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded. And there isn't one of those descriptions that doesn't fit this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not happening on a local little basis in some town, some city, some place, but it's happening throughout the world, &gt;&gt; throughout the earth. They're marrying, giving in marriage, taking wives, not even being married, and they're they're buying and they're selling a global h a global economy. They're planting. And with plant, they want to be able to market it someplace and sell it someplace. And the whole thing is a just a great great kind of economy that's caught the people. And it was in that atmosphere that that God said that when that would come, that's when the son of man would be revealed again. And that has taken place in the prophet's ministry and he that's why he said hundreds of times it is the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; That very ministry is indicative. It is God speaking because God is doing something that a man can't do. &gt;&gt; Even listening last night, Brother Brandham saying to to to a woman standing there, of course you're feeling strange. You're feeling that's not me. That's not my presence. That's him. &gt;&gt; And this is a testimony or a sign of the resurrection. He even told people clearly, you will see the sign of the resurrection because the whole ministry itself was an evidence to the resurrection. He said this this this healing healing itself of the body. Well, we believe in praying for the sick, laying hands upon them, whatever, or just preaching the word and you receive the promise. Believe it and you can be healed. But that's a minor that's a minor thing because you can be healed every day, but you'll you'll die sometime. But uh the the resurrection came to to give testimony to eternal life. &gt;&gt; But he said that that resurrection life, the sign of the resurrection, what is happening and that healing is a only a token evidence of the resurrection. That's what healing is. When you're healed, a part of your body is made well. That's evidence, a token evidence of the resurrection. And if you were healed perfectly every day, every day, every day, you wouldn't die. &gt;&gt; Nothing would go wrong with you. &gt;&gt; And so it's just a token evidence of the resurrection. But then when God comes in uh in that kind of a ministry and then uh reveals the secrets of the hearts of the people uh by the hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of people speaking the truth to the to the revealing the secret of the heart and the people they're caught up in what's happening but you know largely missed it because what God was doing he was trying to get the people to recognize this is a sign of the oncoming resurrection. &gt;&gt; And when you see a sign, I'll come to it in a few moments. A sign is something that points to something else. &gt;&gt; And that was what that ministry was all about. But the people got caught up with the sign and didn't see where it was pointing to. And I'm here today to talk about what it's pointing to. &gt;&gt; Now, in the message presence of God unrecognized, notice the title of it, unrecognized, he refers to the scripture, a wicked and adulterous generation seek after a sign. Notice he says they will receive a sign. what this generation for as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and nights. The son of man must be in the heart of the earth three days and nights. What sign will that wicked and adulterous generation receive? It was the very one he was talking in revealing himself as a son of man as the God prophet fulfilling the scripture. And he said this sign what what sign will they receive? the sign of the resurrection. That's the sign they received. And then he says, "And today, after 2,000 years, we still see Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection." &gt;&gt; This wasn't just another ministry. This was a sign that God sent &gt;&gt; of the resurrection &gt;&gt; because we're in the end time. The days of Noah were here are here. The days of Lot are here. Anybody would want to deny that? I say you're you you're out of touch with reality. The days of Sodom are here &gt;&gt; worldwide &gt;&gt; on a global basis. The days of Lot are here. And the days of Noah are here. We've had it for some time. And really, it's only probably since the Second World War that everything has has been uh so ignited. It's like an explosion of inventions. an explosion of of of pleasure mad people. &gt;&gt; Whether they're poor or whether they're rich, it's a pleasure mad throne. &gt;&gt; They'll spend their last dollar going to get some kind of of an entertainment, whatever. I I've been I was a missionary amongst the native Indian people. I went back there after many years. When I went there the first time, they didn't have a road. They didn't have any cars, maybe one or two amongst the whole tribe. They didn't have any televisions. They lived in little poor places. But when you'd have a service, a meeting, they packed the church every night, standing around the walls. It could be raining with a 100 mile hour wind one night. 100 mph wind driving the rain right through the boards of cracks and running across the floor in little rivlets of of water. They didn't pay a bit of attention to it. They were hungry for God. They wanted to hear the gospel and they would pack the place and line along the walls. Didn't care what kind of weather. I went back there many years later to show even the video deep called the deep. couldn't do. We got a nice audience, a nice crowd out, but we went to see the fell who had the key for the hall for the church. He's laying there on a sofa. Never even had enough time to get up. Laying there watching some football game or something. Now they got a road into the reserve. Now they got cars. Now they got televisions. And the television was worth more than the shack he was living in. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. What happened? Got perverted. &gt;&gt; The whole thing got perverted. The whole thing got twisted. The mind got didn't get converted towards holiness and righteousness. Got converted the other way. &gt;&gt; Not converted, but perverted. &gt;&gt; Might as well say amen. I'm going to preach. &gt;&gt; It changed. Everything changed. I walked out of there sad. I thought, how different in just a few years, just swallowed up with pleasure and ease and whatever more. How different. How glad I am that God found some people, found some young people. They've been through all the religion. They've been through all kinds of churches. They've been through all kinds of programs. They're not interested in programs anymore. They want a God that's a living God. &gt;&gt; They want a holy God. &gt;&gt; They want a God of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't want some ceremony. &gt;&gt; They don't want some program. Oh, we got a program for the young people. The program we have for you young people is hearing the preaching of the word of God, having experience with God. That's the program. &gt;&gt; Putting you in contact with God. That's the program. &gt;&gt; Until you have an individual experience, that's the program. &gt;&gt; It's not the world. It's not just some excitement. It's not some emotionalism. It's putting you in contact with God and giving you a hunger till you know this is a reality. &gt;&gt; And no man gave it to you and no man can take it away. It's the same program Apostle Paul had or Peter had or James had or Steven had or any of the young men that we have today or any fathers or deacons have or whatever more. That's the program. &gt;&gt; That's the only one that's for your families. &gt;&gt; We've received a sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; It's a God sign. God sent. &gt;&gt; Nothing that man could do. And Corinthians says this, which I used in the service and throughout this week. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal. And the things that are not seen are eternal. And I just say to this congregation and all that are streaming the service, what are we looking at? &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, and I'm speaking especially to the you young men and women that have been touched very deeply throughout this week, Paul so marvelously worded it, while while we look, and I was amazed with that word. and thought, "How long? How long are we going to be moved? How long are we going to be affected?" You know how long you'll be affected by this last week's events? Depending how long you look at the things that are not seen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's how long. Other than that, if you're if you get refocused back on just a natural my job and my vehicle and my car and my, you know, my future and my education and where I'm going in the world. If you stay focused on that, I'm quite convinced that there's another part of the prophet's words that said it'll pass by and you'll say, "Wasn't Elijah supposed to come? &gt;&gt; Wasn't there supposed to be a rapture?" And he'll say, "It will have already happened." &gt;&gt; You say, "How did I miss that?" &gt;&gt; Because you're focused on what you can see. &gt;&gt; Well, there's my there's my home and there's my car and there's my job. This is my future. There's my wife. There's my family. And we're just focused on what we're doing here. &gt;&gt; I have to say to you, you'll miss it. &gt;&gt; Not me. The prophet said you'll miss it. You say, "Oh, was it supposed to happen?" You say, "How can we say the things that are &gt;&gt; unseen?" The Bible's full of it. &gt;&gt; You'll know something more about it when this service is over. There is an unseen realm. &gt;&gt; What does the prophet messenger say according to Apostle Paul? If this body be dissolved, we have another &gt;&gt; said it's only 20 25 ft from his body and there's millions of people. He says television a theophony. He said a theophony because Apostle Paul is saying we have another body &gt;&gt; and we go from this body right to that body. We take one step at a time and step into the unknown realm, eternal realm. And we're in another body. the one that God had ordained for you &gt;&gt; when he made man in the first place &gt;&gt; in the image of God made he man in the image of God and he took then chapter two of Genesis took out of the earth and formed him a body and breathed into him &gt;&gt; that spirit man &gt;&gt; because this body here this is not the image of God that man that's inside &gt;&gt; that person that's inside of you Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the unseen one. &gt;&gt; And the Bible speaks about the outward man and the inner man. &gt;&gt; It's two people. &gt;&gt; You have an inner person. It's not this flesh that it's not my fingers or my ears or my nose that craves for God. It's my soul. &gt;&gt; It's the inner man that craves for God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No part of my body desired to be holy and desired after God and be pure, but the inner man did. And that's a man you have to look at. &gt;&gt; That's a man you have to be concerned with. &gt;&gt; Make sure that you're feeding the inner man. &gt;&gt; That you're listening to the desires of the inner man &gt;&gt; that God speaks to. &gt;&gt; So he said it's like a a theophony can be here right now, but you can't see it because these eyes weren't made. These eyes are made to see material things, this life. But as as we sit here this moment, voices are going through this room. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Bodies. &gt;&gt; If we had a television camera here, we wouldn't only pick up your p picture, but they'll have a picture of somebody that's sitting over in in Moscow &gt;&gt; or in Rome &gt;&gt; or someplace else, and they'll pick up their picture and send it right here. The image of that person would be seen here. with the birth marks and the clothes and the color. So, colors are going through the room. &gt;&gt; The camera doesn't invent it. It only picks up what's there &gt;&gt; and transmits it by a certain channel. &gt;&gt; And that's the channel that God wants us to be in. &gt;&gt; Not a television channel, but a channel of the Holy Spirit, which is the sixth sense. &gt;&gt; The sixth sense, which is a sense, and that's faith. You've got your feeling, your taste, your smell, your hearing, your sight. You've got those five senses. But the prophet says you have a sixth sense. It's faith. &gt;&gt; And faith claims the promise of God and calls it finished. &gt;&gt; Faith sees things that these eyes can never see. There's voices, there are sounds, there are sights, there are colors, there's forms of bodies going through the room. And it goes on to say that was here that was here in ancient times. Television was here when Adam was here. When Moses was here, when Elijah was here, when Jesus was here, and all through last 2,000 years, it was here. But they only discovered it in this time. Not because they weren't smart back then, but it wasn't for that season. But why did God allow that technology to be discovered now to present to the people and make them ready for a prophet's message that could make reference to that and say now in conclusion, listen very closely, so is Christ here. &gt;&gt; So are the angels here. &gt;&gt; So is the unseen world here. And if you live just for this life, you're going to miss that one. &gt;&gt; You'll miss that one. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And in the millennium, it will only be more real." &gt;&gt; That which even science has picked has picked up on will only become more real &gt;&gt; in the millennium. &gt;&gt; And Christ is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what why God raised that ministry up in a prophet's office. Oh, many tried to duplicate it. They fell flat in their face. &gt;&gt; I happen to know many tried to duplicate it. It's a shame and a sham. &gt;&gt; There was none that raised up &gt;&gt; and said one after the other, reveal a secret of the heart. one after the other after the other after the other for over 30 years &gt;&gt; and asked him is that the truth and it was the truth every time. &gt;&gt; When that kind of a ministry is sent then you want to know what that person speaks concerning this word is truth &gt;&gt; wasn't 50% is truth &gt;&gt; baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the only way it ever happened in the Bible. Glory. &gt;&gt; You took a chance on something else. If you haven't been baptized that way, you need to be because you're being baptized into the word. &gt;&gt; Not just into water, into the word &gt;&gt; and in the resurrection. Oh, well, we'll get into it a moment. But what the the resurrection, you know, the resurrection could have happened this morning and if it wasn't for the grace of God. If it's not for the grace of God, you wouldn't even know it happened. The resurrection took place and the women ran to anoint the bodies &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ found the tomb empty. And a young man sitting there in a white robe said he's not here. &gt;&gt; Go and tell his disciples. And they run out. Mary lingers behind sees a young man that looks like a gardener. &gt;&gt; Maybe someone like Brother Gary St. John or one of brother Don Alexander's workers or one of Vile's workers a young man in the landscaping he's a gardener says sir where have you taken him talking to the resurrected Christ &gt;&gt; and had no idea no concept that it was him Where have you taken him that I might go to him? Then just a little simple familiar thing. Mary Bonai. &gt;&gt; You want to be that kind of a person &gt;&gt; say where have they taken him? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm following in his footsteps. I'm I I'm interested in this group of people. I want to be in the fellowship of the saints. &gt;&gt; Go and tell my disciples. And then two, walking on the way to Emmas. And listen friends, that happens to be one of brother Brandham's last services. Modern events made clear. You've heard me speaking it so many times. I hope you never get tired of it. &gt;&gt; To me, it's one of the most remarkable things that this ministry that God sent as a sign of the resurrection would end &gt;&gt; with a resurrection message &gt;&gt; in December. &gt;&gt; When people are thinking about Christmas, he's speaking about resurrection. Why? Because that was his ministry, &gt;&gt; the sign of the resurrection. And there were two men on the way to Emmas, &gt;&gt; Cleopus and his friend. And they're going along. They're not talking about, "Hey, Cleopus, what did you get a raise this week? &gt;&gt; Have you got your money invested in the right place? How's things doing at school? Did you finish the courses? &gt;&gt; How's that house coming? &gt;&gt; How's the building happening? Oh, what's happening down the church? Da da da da da da &gt;&gt; had nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; They were talking about the events that had just happened. &gt;&gt; You hear me speaking this morning about the events of the last week. I look on those not merely as a tragedy to us and a loss to us, but as something that God did. &gt;&gt; And I'm looking at that and saying now, what is the purpose of God behind this? And they were troubled. We become troubled. They couldn't explain it. We can't explain it. &gt;&gt; I want to I have something special to say to you young men. You all knew Silas at different levels. Some of you were very close. Some of you only knew him by name. Some of you only knew him. We went to church. We were at camp together. We were in the same cabin together. Somebody said, "Well, we're buddies. We're with with each other all the time." And maybe as buddies, you went places and did things and so on so forth, and it would be, you say, "Well, these Christian people, these people, they don't know what we did. They don't know where we Let me tell you something. I could take you all through the scriptures and God would take certain He would just pick one. He'd take a hold of a person and let a certain event happen." What God does is not based on what he was living. &gt;&gt; God takes a person. He can take an individual. He can take an individual. It just so happened that God began to stir his life just before he was taken &gt;&gt; in a very deep way. But God has taken and they're written in the scripture. People that weren't even living for him. People had all kinds of other other ideas, other plans, other programs. and God raised it up as an example and left it in the scripture and the whole scripture is Christ. &gt;&gt; Now that's hard for a person to understand but that's a revelation you need to get. God can take I I'll show you an extreme and this is no reference to brother Silas. I'll show you an extreme. Abselum, a beloved son of King David, who tried to take the throne from his father &gt;&gt; by treachery and to win the hearts. And he had people around him that were saying, "You can do it, Abselum. You can do it. You've got the hearts of the people." And he became uh convinced and he's going to take the throne from his father. And then as the events happen, he's riding on his mule swiftly and his head is caught in a oak tree and he dies. Nothing spiritual about the man that we can see at all. But God takes the event and he uses the event and raises it up before the people. And we hear one of the most uh marvelous prayers that's issued in the scripture. Abselum, my son, Abselum, Abselum, my son. &gt;&gt; God taking right out of the bosom and soul of David the king, showing the spirit of Christ, no matter what was done against him, he would not hold it. His love was pure. And God used it in the scripture. Even though it even though the young man someone said, "Well, I I I contrived. I I spoke to Abselum. I worked with Abselum. We were working against David, which is working against God." &gt;&gt; Yet God used that event and it happens to be in the Bible. And the whole Bible from cover to cover is Christ. &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't understand that." I'm glad you don't understand it. All right. &gt;&gt; Because if God could only work within our understanding, he'd be a very small God. &gt;&gt; God works in his own mysterious ways, his glories and his glory and his power to demonstrate. &gt;&gt; And I felt urgent upon myself today to especially address the young men. You young men, whatever time, whatever future we may have, a lot of responsibility rests upon your shoulders. Not to just sit and listen, but you must say, "What does the call of God on my life for? What am I to become? Am I going to become a deacon? Am I going to become a trustee? Am I going to am I to become a witness for Christ? Am I to become a minister of this gospel? Oh God, take me and use me and make me fruitful. &gt;&gt; I don't want to live just for things. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be consumed just with things. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be taken up just with what I see. &gt;&gt; It shall surely pass away. &gt;&gt; But the things that are unseen are eternal. this resurrection of Jesus and many sermons will be spoken today and they'll talk about it as a messenger also did the greatest week in all of history but they'll be talking about history I'm talking about the greatest generation that has ever come upon the face of the earth is this golden age &gt;&gt; and that you and I I've got a lot lot of years on me. Not as many as some folks here, but I have a lot more years than you young people that fill these seats. And how glad I am. You're the ones. You have every possibility to enter in and see the resurrection. And don't forget what brother Biscll is saying to you. If you're consumed with just the physical, the material, what I see, what I taste, what I hear, and this life, you'll miss that. That's right. &gt;&gt; You'll miss it. &gt;&gt; You need to turn your focus and say, "Why did God send a messenger? What is this message all about? What is my pastor preaching about? Oh, God. &gt;&gt; From the depths of my soul, give me eyes to see into the unseen realm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let my faith reach there and touch God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I just need a few more minutes. I'm not going to be long this morning. I feel so pressed in my spirit. When Jesus came, just follow this closely. When Jesus came, the word, the very thoughts that had become word and God spoke them through the prophets in the Old Testament and they became the word of God. Then those words were merged into human form in the body of Jesus Christ. The word became flesh. It merged. That which is conceived in thee is of the Holy Ghost. And God commenced a new creation by his word. That which is conceived in thee is of the Holy Ghost. That holy thing shall be called the son of God. God gave origin to Jesus Christ. And Jesus Christ came forth in the world. And now the word there was no no body like that prior. Now the word became flesh. He lived a very short time and came now to the crucifixion because the word said he must be bruised. The word said he must be beaten. The word said he must be wounded for our transgressions. The word said and he be rejected. And he had to live all of that. And now he comes to the cross and death comes and a and a spear on his side and he gives up. No man take my life from me. I lay it down and I &gt;&gt; will take it off again. &gt;&gt; And then the spirit the spirit was was taken from him. the spirit. He He released the spirit. And now the spirit which had been which was left the body. The body the word that was made flesh. Now the spirit the word is forming the spirit and the holy spirit of God comes down into into the individuals. The church is born. And 2,000 years has gone by. Over 2,000 years or thereabouts. and the Holy Spirit has been in the church. But now there had to come a time when the the spirit and the word would become so perfectly formed in a people until that people could be identified as the bride of Jesus Christ so that the word once again now is in a in a form of human flesh. But it's another form. &gt;&gt; It's a woman form. It's a it's a feminine it's a feminine spirit as Eve was taken from Adam. So we have been actually taken from Christ. &gt;&gt; And we have his life not another life. And so in this time to achieve that getting into some swimming water to achieve that is that God had to come and personify himself. Brother Brandham makes a statement. Uh I just want you to hear this statement and then you'll get you'll get my picture and I'll show it to you in the scripture. talks about the dark ages and the reformation breaking forth. Talking about how the church as Christ died, the church went through martyrdom, went through the dark ages, and the seed had to die. And it says it came forth, it had to die so it could come forth in the reformation. Again, listen very closely. That seed as Jesus said, except except a seed die is buried, it abideth alone. But if it die, it brings forth. And he said the seed had to be buried like all seeds does. It had to die so it could come forth in the reformation again. And here it is. It came forth in the person of the reformation Martin Luther. The reformation came forth in the person of the reformation Martin Luther. The reformation came. That's how it came. God ordained that that person would be the one that would carry present and God through him would present the age of the reformation to the people and the people then could enter into it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me yet? And so it was also when the second work of grace that second work of grace, sanctification came about through the person of sanctification or we say the message of sanctification through the person &gt;&gt; of Wesley. And now we come to where the world and Christian world knows that there's to be a resurrection and there are to be some signs. Now you know stop for a moment. You can have a sign. We've got signs here. There's an exit sign here. An exit sign there. Exit sign over there. Well, you don't come into church on Sunday morning and say, "Oh, wonderful. That exit sign is still there." You don't pay any attention to it. You drive down the street and it says 184th Street or 186th Street, you don't pay any attention to it. You've gone there so many times, you just automatically turn. You're not interested in what the sign says. But if you don't know where you're going &gt;&gt; and you're going there for the first time and somebody has said you go down this 60th Avenue and then you'll see a sign and it'll say it'll say 186th Street and look hard on the right and you'll see Cloverdale Bible Way. That's the place where we're meeting &gt;&gt; and you're watching the map and you're watching every little point. But now, now the fact you don't read this sign, you don't read the street sign, it doesn't mean they're not important. &gt;&gt; It just means at that moment perhaps you don't need them as bad. &gt;&gt; And so we have spiritual signs and the prophet speaks of national signs and he refers to Israel. Oh yeah. Well, a lot of you been born since 1950, since 1960, since 1970, since 1948 when Israel was made a nation say, "Oh, that's old history." Oh, no, no, no. That's not old history. And furthermore, it's a sign. &gt;&gt; And just because you've heard it and heard it and heard it doesn't mean that it's not a sign anymore. &gt;&gt; It's still a sign. And when fire breaks loose and fire and somebody's screaming out there's fire, the place is going, you say, "Where's the exit?" &gt;&gt; And then you're really glad the sign is there. &gt;&gt; And so you hear Israel is Israel's been born a nation. The the flag of David is is flying again over Jerusalem. And this is happening. And that's happening. And the other signs have been happening. And you heard it. And you heard it. You heard it. Don't fail to get this. Don't forget it's still a sign. &gt;&gt; You maybe have heard it so often that it doesn't have the same impact, but it's still a sign. &gt;&gt; In other words, God said, "I posted the sign. I showed the sign. &gt;&gt; I let a sign come." And then come and say, "Oh, we've heard all about the prophet ministry, etc., etc., And we've heard it so many times and how he called the people forward and so on. But you want to go back and say, "Lord, give me eyes to look into the unseen realm." And when you hear him say, "This is a sign of the resurrection." &gt;&gt; I would stop. Resurrection. Oh, the resurrection morning. Oh, the resurrection morning. Oh, God. Oh God, let me be in tune. You've already posted this sign. The sign went across the nations and you called me. &gt;&gt; Don't let me be out of tune. &gt;&gt; Let me keep in focus. &gt;&gt; I want to stay in focus. And then God causes an event such as you've had in the last few days to startle you, to awaken you. &gt;&gt; I tell you why. because it says while we look and I noticed in the last week you're here praying you're here refocused &gt;&gt; and your jobs mean a whole lot less &gt;&gt; and your future is put on the back burner and it needs to stay on the back burner. &gt;&gt; You need to move the f the the resurrection to the front burner. You need to move the message to the front burner. You need to move. You need to say, "What's God's will in my life?" That needs to be on the front burner, and it needs to stay there. &gt;&gt; That's the message. &gt;&gt; You have received the sign of the resurrection. And that's why you're here. This message is a sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Not a resurrection of the past. one that's coming. &gt;&gt; One that might be here. &gt;&gt; One that could have taken place this morning. &gt;&gt; You know how real that will be? Some of you folks might be in the street. You might be in a mall. You might be in a restaurant. Some young man or some young woman walk up to you one day say, "How do you do?" So, how do you do? Do I know you? Well, perhaps not. You go to a certain certain place of worship. Yeah, that's right. And they speak often of the rapture and the resurrection. Well, we do. And you know that they're going to come and perhaps be with the believers as it was with Jesus if it repeats maybe maybe a month, 30, 40 days and mingle. Or you remember that the scripture says, "And the graves were opened and many bodies were seen in the streets of Jerusalem." &gt;&gt; I suggest to you, I ask you, who saw them? &gt;&gt; Herod didn't see them. Caiaphas didn't see them. The leaders didn't see them. They didn't go to the synagogue. &gt;&gt; It's not that you're going to come in say, "Oh, I go to Cloverdale Bible Way and I'm going to meet them there." Don't count on it. You want to be in harmony with God. &gt;&gt; You want to be in fellowship with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And this, my friends, is what's going to happen. And they will say to you, you have a certain expectation. You know that the dead in Christ are going to rise. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, our pastors told us about that. I'm one of them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. You say, "Why would I say that?" Because that's exactly what the Bible teaches. That's that's how it happened. &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, dirt's going to fly up out of the graves." There's no place in the Bible that says that dirt fell up out of the graves. &gt;&gt; It says that they rose from the dead. God changed them in their atoms &gt;&gt; and they came forth in the picture that God had for them. &gt;&gt; That's going to be unseen. &gt;&gt; Your buddies Jeremy, Joel, Nathaniel, Nathan, sorry, your buddies may not see this. You want to be sure you see it. &gt;&gt; People are saying, "Well, I wonder if I'll have enough faith for the resurrection." Let me end with this. I wonder if I'll have enough faith because brother Brandham says we haven't if we haven't got enough faith for healing. We scarcely have enough faith for healing. How are we going to have enough faith for the rapture? &gt;&gt; It's not faith that's going to just drop in at the moment you're raptured. It is this that a person has their focus while we look at things that are unseen. So I'm looking at the unseen. I'm looking at the promises of God. I'm looking at the message that God has sent. I'm looking at the sign of the resurrection. I'm looking at it today, tomorrow, this week, next week. &gt;&gt; And it's that person that's going to have that experience. And if you have that experience, you meet someone that's resurrected. You don't find you don't find Mary the disciples after they identified they had trouble identifying him. &gt;&gt; Imagine the resurrected word himself walking with you. Put yourself there. &gt;&gt; Say I'm Cleopus's friend. I'm the young man Cleopus. Heavy-hearted. Why? because all he had seen was what had happened. Jesus of Nazareth, a prophet. We expected great things. We thought greater things were going to happen. Our hopes were anchored in him. We were going to have more great meetings. We were going to have more things happened. And it didn't happen. And now our whole world fell apart. And the word began to take the word &gt;&gt; and speak the word. to those that were believers of the word. &gt;&gt; They knew what he was talking about. And they said, "Are you a stranger?" Says, "What are you sad about? What are you reasoning about?" &gt;&gt; Said, "Are you a stranger here? You don't know what has taken place just these last days in Jerusalem. Here he is, the person that had it all, experienced it all." He said, "What things?" &gt;&gt; You know why he said that? He wanted to know what was in your heart. If it all happened now, let's say the resurrection happened now. I'm really bringing this down. Let's say the resurrection happened and those that had been asleep in Christ began to mingle with believers that have received the sign of the resurrection and have been brought into sharp focus with the events of this age. And you begin to have a meeting and a discussion with them. Say what? What was you look very sad? What's happened? The families have to forgive me because I'm becoming very personal. Say, well, we've been very heavy-hearted the last few days. Been very heavy-hearted le recently. What happened? Well, very close friend, very close associate, someone we sat in church with, someone I saw baptized, someone I went to camp with was taken tragically and suddenly from us. Is that right? And what effect did it have on you? Well, frankly, it had a very serious effect on me. It's caused me to refocus my life. I've had a complete transformation. I I see things totally differently now. I heard him speak. I heard his brother speak about when he got right up and achieved a great height in his his climbing of this mountain. His the effect on him was this must be like heaven. It's had an effect on me and my focus is on the unseen things. Then our pastor got up and just preached and pounded it home and it reverberated inside my soul and I'm determined to see the things that are unseen. That's my thirst. That's my yearning. That's my craving. I'm looking to the unseen. Then you have that individual say, "You're looking at it. You are seeing the unseen. &gt;&gt; The resurrection you've longed for and yearned for has happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You think I'm crazy? That's how it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; According to the word of God, that's how it's going to take place. &gt;&gt; And they're going to be multitudes and multitudes that miss it. Right. &gt;&gt; And as a messenger said to be coming to church the following Sunday &gt;&gt; and having an altar call and thinking they're getting saved when the resurrection's already history. I said to you as a congregation as I close now this revealing and I don't want to get in trouble over this but this revealing of the son of man came in the person of the messenger &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; Martin Luther for the re for the reformation William Brham the revealing of the son of man came in that messenger in the person of that messenger and because he was faithful to the ministry and the word, we've been able to enter into it and thus we're here. Someone someone tuned me into a man on on a computer and he's walking around and and making really a boast of his association with with brother Brandham and got studs in his ear and through his lip and talking about all the supernatural and how the angel has come to him, how the pillar of fire has come to him and there isn't anything that can anchor back to the word. When I see that and I see mobs of young people swept up into it and the whole thing and some great emotional and the world and the and the banging of the bass and the drums till you can't even hear what the people are supposed to be singing and saying say, "Thank God I don't have to feed on that. &gt;&gt; Thank God I've been delivered from that. Thank God we have a message that we have. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Forget who's next to you. Thank God &gt;&gt; that he called you, that you heard his voice, &gt;&gt; that you're hearing him call today so you can look to the unseen. Thank God for eyes of faith. &gt;&gt; Ah, this world is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've heard his voice. &gt;&gt; And as Job, we can say, I know my redeemer liveth, and in my flesh shall I see him. &gt;&gt; Though the skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see him. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, don't sit in this service and miss that great time. Let's stand to our feet, shall we? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, you've been speaking to us and dealing with us &gt;&gt; almost in a strange way and we are submitting ourselves. We're just surrendering ourselves to it. However you lead, oh great Holy Spirit, you are our guide. We are the sheep of the fold. Lead us, oh shepherd. Lead us. Lead us. Take my words, oh God, not my words, but your words. Man's words will surely fail and pass away, but your words shall live forever, oh God. I pray that you'll take these few words and and and mark them indelibly upon the hearts and minds of the people. We see, Father, uh uh uh rising up, a church rising. Oh, it's a glorious church without spot or wrinkle, washed in the blood of the lamb. Oh, we hear them, Lord. We hear them not with these natural ears. And we see them, but not with these natural eyes. We see them coming. That great host, that great host, the messenger saw and mess that ran and they embraced one another. We see that host. I'm going to embrace them, Lord. We're going to embrace them, oh God. We're looking over. We're looking across the river and seeing that scene that's there. No death, no sorrow, no pain, no tears. Here we have tears, but there there be none. Oh God, our focus is there. Lord Jesus, if there's any that are in this audience today, oh Lord, not 100% certain, not 100% certain, but they would at least be honest and say, I don't want to miss that moment. I mean, I I I don't feel assured that I'm ready for it, but I don't want to miss it. I'd like to prayer. I want you to pray. I'm sincere. I want to make my life right. I want to be ready for that hour. You want to raise your hand? We're going to pray with you. Don't be ashamed. Don't be too proud to raise your hand there. I just want to be ready for that moment. Oh God, you see every heart. You see every heart even before the hand was raised. A heart of loyalty. A heart of desire. A heart Lord that yearns to be like you. Numbered in your group. numbered, oh God, with the believers with a white robed throng. Father, come by the Holy Spirit now, oh purging fire, oh cleansing flame, oh consuming fire of the Holy Ghost. Move, I pray, over this audience now. And may they forget who's next to them. May they forget it completely and call out to you, oh God, out of the sincerity of their soul. In the name of Jesus Christ, I commit them to you. I commit them to you now. Holy Spirit, take control. Take over in Jesus Christ's name. I want you as individuals say, "Holy Spirit, take full control of me. Take control of this service. May your will be done &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. In Jesus name. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh God. To your work Lord. &gt;&gt; May they find a place where they can meet you. &gt;&gt; May they speak to you out of the depths of their soul. May they say oh God what is really on their heart in Jesus name in Jesus name. Jesus name. [Music] You know, the Bible even speaks about those that come before God and the rich and God said to them, "You had your pleasure on earth. You had your blessings. You had your benefits. You had everything." I want to move that out of the out of the material realm for just a moment and say to this audience spiritually, I don't know of any people as bountifully provided for as the believers of this message. And God will say, "What did you listen to every Sunday? What did you listen to in the house of God? What did you hear? Did you feel my presence?" Well, yes, I did. What did you do with it? Did you hear me speaking? Yes, I did. What did you do when I Well, I just hung my head. I didn't say anything. Did you feel an urgency to call out and say something to me when I talked to you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Did you feel an urge to say it? &gt;&gt; Yes, I did. So, in this life, you had a bountiful life. No one so rich as that. I've traveled the world. Dear friends, let me tell you, I know of multitudes, multitudes of people that wish they could trade places with you right now. They wish they could raise their hands. The blessed people in China who are listening right now and being translated into their language, they wish they could be here. They'd love to be able to express themselves like you can &gt;&gt; and perhaps won't and they do at the risk of their own protection. Oh God, let us be thankful for what we have received. Let us appreciate this glorious, glorious truth and word that he has sent to us. [Music] I'm not here to be dramatic, but I am here to be truthful. My my same Lord, my Lord has said in his word and I can take you to many places where he called and he called and he moved and he spoke and he couldn't get a response out of people and he poured out every everything he could upon them. And then he says these words and they've always said a shudder through me. And then you'll call and his next line is frightening and I will not answer. That's written in the word of God a number of times and when I run into it, it causes me to shudder inside. And then you'll call. I've called. I led you. I fed you. I did everything. I poured out everything on you. I gave you all the land. I gave you all the inheritance. I just gave you the blessings of God. And I spoke, but you wouldn't answer. And then he tells, "Then this is going to happen. It won't always be like this. And then you're going to call and I won't answer." [Music] It's a serious moment. But that's the truth of God's word. We're not here to try to use some emotion, but we're here if he's speaking to you. I say to you, in the name of the Lord, move everything out of the way and respond. Here I am. Speak, Lord. Do what you do with me. I'm here to hear. I'm here to listen, Father. Now I've spoken things that have been resting deep on my heart and I pray father at this uh serious moment there were many serious moments Jesus even when you were speaking to your disciples and you saw the people leave you actually saw them leave and turn away from the word when their own heart was saying it's truth yet they said I I cannot I I I just can't make that decision. and I can't surrender everything. Lord, don't I'm asking you don't let it be that there's those listening to me this morning that are going to encounter that time. Oh God, I'm I'm pleading with you and pleading with them because I've poured out all my strength, oh God, seeking you and praying, Father, that you would utter words this morning that would change lives and transform them. Oh God, I commit them now to you. I commit their future to you and their eternal destiny to you by the Holy Spirit. I leave them in your care in Jesus Christ's name. In Jesus Christ's name, speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. to place. Speak my [Music] sing and I'll be quick to answer. Sing my Lord. Sing my Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord send me. &gt;&gt; This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through my treasures are laid out somewhere. [Music] The angels beckon me from heaven and I can't feel in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven is not my home, then what will I do? The angels me from heaven open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. &gt;&gt; While we're standing, while you're listening so nice, I want to tell you what brother Biscll expects. I don't necessarily expect a great big alter call. That's not it. We've seen that. You've been there. What I expect is men and women to make do business with God. &gt;&gt; Be converted. Change in your mind. &gt;&gt; Say, God, your will shall be my will. &gt;&gt; I surrender myself to you from this day forward. &gt;&gt; I'm done with the world. Let me ask especially I've been addressing young people because this has been such a focus on the young people because of Silas's life. I'd like to ask you young people. How long do you plan to live kind of what have you got in your mind? Are you going to live to be 40, 50, 60? No, I plan to live longer than that. Good. And I hope that you do. Do you plan to be healthy? Yes, I I plan to take care of myself. I want to be healthy. And you're going to live 50, 60, 70, 80 years. Let me give you some advice to do exactly what I've done. I've walked up to a tree. You say, "Now, Brother Bisco, now we sure know that something's gone up wrong upstairs. I've walked up to a tree and looked at the bark on a tree and that I I spoke to myself, that bark has been on that tree longer than I'm going to live. This tree has been here for 200 years. &gt;&gt; A tree &gt;&gt; just bought me life. You've been here 200 years. &gt;&gt; God, am I not worth more than this tree? Yes. &gt;&gt; I got to be gone in 60, 70 years. The bark has been on that tree longer than I'm going to live. &gt;&gt; You know what that makes you feel about that big? &gt;&gt; And then somehow faith anchors in. The God who caused that tree to live and to give it life and to make it strong. That God's got a life for you and got a life for me. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? There's a song that says I'm pulling hard. There's a song because I don't want a flash in the pan. There's a song that says what then? And I made a decision when I was a young man in my late teens. And I just decided the world is not a place for me. I wasn't a preacher. I was just working in a doing labor work. I didn't have a profession, but I was done with the world. &gt;&gt; My That was a weak amen. &gt;&gt; How many here came to that place? You're done with the world. &gt;&gt; That's what I like to hear. And it was different from that moment because God says, "That boy means business. That boy means what he says. And I'm going to give him the Holy Spirit because he can't live it by himself. I'm going to give him the energy. I'm going to give him the power. God wants you to make that kind of a decision. You're done with the world. &gt;&gt; You're done with sin. &gt;&gt; And if you're not, I announce to you, sin has wages. &gt;&gt; And it will surely pay you on payday. &gt;&gt; And the wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; But the gift of God is eternal life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm &gt;&gt; done with the work. &gt;&gt; I'm pulling for you for all I can. &gt;&gt; Some of you young men, perhaps young ladies, you're going to give an answer for this kind of a meeting. God's going to say, "Didn't I talk to you? Didn't I speak directly to your soul?" And you're going to say, "Yes, you did. Yes, you did." Don't ever think for a minute, oh that's just brother Biscoll, that's just the way he that's just brother Ray, brother Lance. &gt;&gt; No, it's not. It's the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't even be keeping you right now if it wasn't feeling the same the same thrust in me. It says go up to the site. Why am I going there? I say why am I saying these things? because there somebody &gt;&gt; hasn't hasn't come to that very spot. I'm going to do business with God &gt;&gt; and I am done done done with the world. &gt;&gt; Here's an example. This young man right here, I have respect for Jason because he had not surrendered his life to Christ. And for 21 years, he sat in this church. And I dedicated him as a baby. And when he was 18 and 19 and 20 years old, sometimes I'd be stepping outside while the Lord's table and communion and footwashing was being made ready. And I see him sitting sat in the service here, but he'd go out there while the communion was being Jason, are you not going to take communion? Not going to have footwashing? No. He says, no. Just as respectful as could be. And I just thought, God bless you. One day it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; One day it'll happen. And one day it happened. One day it happened &gt;&gt; and I don't even remember the day. I don't even know how it happened, brother Jason. But I'm so glad I've used your example over and over and over amongst others. If God's not dealing with you, you stay right there under the sound of the gospel. You respect it. You believe the message with all your heart. You said, "I know this is it. I'm going to stay right with it." &gt;&gt; And God will honor that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just over in the glory land et [Music] world anymore. I have no friend like you. If heaven is on my Lord, what will I do? The angels me [Music] and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. When the redeemed are gathering in, when the redeemed are gathering in, &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm back in the Bible way house. &gt;&gt; I feel at home like we've got 10 or 20 people there. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're the same kind of people. Oh, the same kind of message. When the redeemed are gathering in, you mind if I rejoice a little bit? Hallelujah. Just rejoice with me and we're going to close right away. thinking of the rapture in our blessed home when we are gathering in. Oh, how will we raise a heavenly apple in that city in the sky of the Lord every [Music] [Music] [Applause] single [Music] When our gathering, there will be a rain procession over all the [Music] are. Oh, what musical, what single that city will be ruled when dark [Applause] [Music] and wash my soul and fall. Oh, hallelujah. And how when the redeemed are gathering in saints will sing redemption and story with their voices loud and strong. [Music] The angels of the listen for they cannot join their song redeemed are gather again. For three are gathering in walk like every single [Music] sing. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want all the young people. We always start at 25 and under. I think we'll say 30 and under because we got a lot of 30 that are in our young people's group.

Enter in thou well well well done now good and faithful servant or depart from me I never knew you only two things you're going to say short isn't it not doesn't take very long to say it even if we have to be like that one man says I can't find your name in the book can't find your name. It's got to be there. And he found one Jesus Christ who stood on his behalf. Says he stood for me when I was on when they were on earth and I'm standing for him now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ddier, I wonder if you'd come and dismiss us in prayer, please. [Music] Gracious Father, we're so thankful today for your grace among us. Lord, [Music] how you would come and you'll take your word and you'll do the same thing you did when you're here, Father, [Music] to prove that you're not a God of yesterday or a God of tomorrow, but you're the God of this very hour, this very moment. Yes. &gt;&gt; And you'll take modern events happening right among us &gt;&gt; and take the word and make it plain. Touch your heart and reveal that this is your doing among us. Oh God on this resurrection day. We give you thanks to know that you're alive. that truly you've been lifted out out of history &gt;&gt; and you're an everpresent help in time of need, oh God. And we came this morning needing a touch from you, needing, oh God, a move of the spirit in our lives and praying and desiring that you'll have your own way. And we recognize that you did your work among us today. Father, those that have made a decision for you, let the great Holy Spirit, the quickening power come and recognize, oh God, their decision, knowing that they made a momentous decision. This is your way. They've chosen you today, Father. Honor them with that divine life that will stand and cause them to stand in this hour. We thank you for remembering us this day. We thank you for sending your word among us once again. We thank you for showing yourself real and alive this morning. We bless your holy name, Father. We embrace your word. We receive it, oh God, and we want to mix it with faith and watch it benefit us, Lord Jesus. Bless each one this morning. I pray your servant for being obedient and for his son and daughter of God who has come and listened attentively, oh God, we believe your word was not sent in vain, but it has accomplished its very purpose. Go with us this afternoon, Lord, and return us ready to hear again what the spirit will say to the church. We commit all things to you now and we thank you for your grace in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. We dismiss you in the name of Jesus. Do greet one another warmly with a real Christian handshake and smile. And God be with you and we'll see you this evening. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] Okay. [Music]
