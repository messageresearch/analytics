[31:40] you know those guns that were like a big
[31:41] blunderbuss you know they kind of
[31:43] you know it is
[31:44] everywhere but whatever the lord desires
[31:48] he can fine-tune that into a real fine
[31:50] sniper
[31:51] if he's so designed so
[31:53] whatever it is a big blunderbuss or a
[31:55] big shotgun or a sniper he'll do it all
[31:58] tonight amen we're going to turn to
[32:01] genesis
[32:02] 18 have a few scriptures
[32:05] that will read
[32:07] maybe a little bit from
[32:09] last time we spoke but then
[32:11] moving onwards that's why i said it
[32:13] might feel like a shotgun but lord help
[32:14] me
[32:16] genesis 18
[32:17] verse 9.
[32:22] this is abraham and sarah
[32:26] when the lord himself came to meet him
[32:30] so we'll just we'll start at verse 9 and
[32:31] he said unto him
[32:33] where is sarah thy wife
[32:35] and he said behold in the tent
[32:38] he said i will certainly return unto
[32:40] thee according to the time of life and
[32:42] lo sarah thy wife shall have a son
[32:45] and sarah heard it in the tent door
[32:47] which was behind him
[32:48] i know abraham and sarah were old and
[32:50] well stricken in age and it ceased to be
[32:52] with sarah after the manner of women
[32:55] therefore sarah laughed and herself
[32:56] saying
[32:57] after i am waxed old shall i have
[32:59] pleasure my lord being old also
[33:02] and the lord said unto abraham wherefore
[33:04] did sarah laugh
[33:06] saying shall i sure of a surety bear a
[33:08] child
[33:09] which i'm old
[33:11] is anything too hard for the lord
[33:15] imagine
[33:16] imagine he was speaking imagine taking
[33:18] that question
[33:20] my goodness is anything too hard for the
[33:22] lord no nothing
[33:24] at the appointed time
[33:27] at the time appointed i should say i
[33:29] will return unto thee according to the
[33:31] time of life

[34:10] according to the time of life it was a
[34:12] prepared time it wasn't a given date
[34:15] didn't say at this exact time but it was
[34:17] an appointed time god knew i'm going to
[34:19] return
[34:20] and there's going to be a there's going
[34:21] to be life come forth amen but we're
[34:24] hitting abraham here at a bit of a
[34:26] way forward in the story because abraham
[34:29] had been waiting
[34:31] he'd been waiting there had been some
[34:32] waiting i just want to read a couple
[34:33] scriptures if we go back to last
[34:35] last service we've spoken on uh
[34:38] hindered unhindered i should say in
[34:40] hebrews 12 1-2 we spoke from that
[34:42] scripture wherefore seeing we're also
[34:44] our compass about with so many was so
[34:46] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[34:48] aside every weight we spoke on that
[34:51] amen i pray the cement bags are dropped
[34:53] cut off and we kept running amen and the
[34:55] sin that so easily beset us and let us
[34:58] run
[34:59] and we're running
[35:01] but the next part of that is with
[35:03] patience
[35:05] with patience all right so we're running
[35:09] but with patience
[35:10] now with patience the race that's set
[35:12] before us looking under jesus the author
[35:14] and finisher of our faith who for the
[35:16] joy that was set before him endured the
[35:19] cross despising the shame and set down
[35:21] the right hand amen he endured the cross
[35:24] endure that that is to remain or abide
[35:27] not to recede or flee
[35:29] it's to preserve under misfortunes and
[35:31] trials to hold fast onto one's faith so
[35:34] this is the word endure there and if we
[35:36] keep we read a couple other scriptures
[35:38] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[35:40] time there's a time ahead you're going
[35:42] to have to endure or you're going to
[35:44] have to run with patience but there's an
[35:46] appointed time amen uh galatians 6 8 9
[35:50] says for he that soweth to his flesh
[35:51] shall reap corruption he that sowed to
[35:53] the spiritual reaper of the spirit or
[35:55] shall reap everlasting life and let us
[35:57] not be weary and well doing for in due
[35:59] season
[36:00] don't be weary but in due season there's
[36:02] a time appointed somewhere up ahead run
[36:05] with patience all right and and it
[36:09] actually in the amplified says an
[36:10] appointed season we shall reap if we
[36:12] faint not
[36:14] don't loosen
[36:15] don't relax
[36:18] our courage all right and don't be faint
[36:22] that's really patience in this age
[36:27] probably it's a little waxing thin
[36:30] not only to see a patience are you
[36:32] kidding me
[36:33] you know i got to put the ate my food on
[36:35] an eight-second ride it needs to be hot
[36:36] fast right you know it's not hot fast
[36:39] enough for you know our coffee
[36:41] long are the days of roasting over the
[36:43] fire right
[36:44] for a coffee to percolate unless you go
[36:46] hunting to our hunters but now it's
[36:48] keurig man boom snap pop dribble dribble
[36:50] done coffee now
[36:53] right patience
[36:56] that's hard it's against us run with
[36:57] patience
[36:59] it's against everything here is against
[37:01] that creation of patience you know
[37:04] it's a virtue
[37:06] people i mean my goodness my brother had
[37:07] a road rage incident in front of his
[37:09] driveway just a few nights ago and
[37:12] impatient
[37:13] trying to cut off get around someone
[37:15] doesn't like that you know i think i'm
[37:16] going too slow we'll take this and you
[37:18] know
[37:19] nobody's patient
[37:20] anymore and i'm very pretty sure the
[37:22] pandemic has probably changed that
[37:25] got even worse people are on edge
[37:28] big time fuses they're like this long
[37:30] there's nothing there
[37:32] what do you say when they blow up you
[37:34] know it's just there's nothing no wick
[37:36] no patience
[37:37] but you know this patience if we look at
[37:39] the word patience
[37:42] you know we think have patience who
[37:44] knows the song
[37:46] we all know the song right actually i
[37:48] think some of our little ones don't know
[37:49] that song so we might need to teach in
[37:51] sunday school does everybody don't have
[37:53] patience we all listened to that when we
[37:55] were kids probably none of you little
[37:56] ones did but i did it was like a snail
[37:58] right
[37:59] no nobody even heard okay some of you
[38:01] nodding your head
[38:02] showing my age that's where i learned
[38:04] the song but that's actually patience
[38:06] ain't passive
[38:08] we think patience i'm going to sit there
[38:10] i'm just going to
[38:12] you know abide my time you know not make
[38:15] any noise just be nice kind of put that
[38:16] mona lisa smile on
[38:19] you know is she is she smiling is she
[38:20] frowning what's she doing
[38:22] that's not the patience that is in the
[38:24] scripture to run with patience that's
[38:26] not it
[38:27] it's actually
[38:29] the the the word is hupo mene or in
[38:33] greek i'm no greek but what it's
[38:34] actually saying is constancy under
[38:37] suffering in faith and duty another one
[38:40] says is having the quality to stand
[38:42] facing the storm
[38:44] struggling against difficulty and
[38:46] opposition or another one is active
[38:49] spiritual resistance against satan this
[38:52] world and our own carnality that's a
[38:55] very different run with patience than
[38:57] what was probably just prior in your
[38:58] mind 10 seconds ago it's a very
[39:00] different patient that you're running
[39:02] with right so the word hoopo actually
[39:04] means underneath or to be under
[39:06] something heavy the word mino means to
[39:08] stay or to abide so you're abiding or
[39:11] staying under something that's a bit of
[39:12] a heavy load it describes a resolute
[39:14] decision to remain in one spot i'm
[39:16] blowing your mind on patience right now
[39:18] that's good but when you bring those two
[39:20] together and you bring the compound
[39:22] meaning together it's a person who is
[39:24] under some type of heavy load who
[39:27] refuses to stray from his position he's
[39:30] like it is not happening in the face of
[39:32] a storm because my position is commit
[39:36] i'm committed to my task
[39:38] that's running with patience
[39:42] regardless of how heavy the load how
[39:44] fierce the opposition how intense the
[39:46] stress how much the weight is thrown
[39:48] against you this person running with
[39:51] patience looking ahead at an appointed
[39:54] time a promise is ahead of him abraham
[39:57] ran with patience
[40:00] inwardly resolved that he's not going to
[40:03] move
[40:05] amen
[40:06] he's committed he's staying put and
[40:08] he'll never surrender
[40:10] for any reason
[40:12] that's some serious patience that ain't
[40:14] no snail slowly going across the street
[40:17] this is a whole nother level of patience
[40:20] amen so we're running when you think i'm
[40:22] running with patience or i need some
[40:24] more patience there's your definition
[40:26] it's an active
[40:28] it's an active word
[40:30] amen
[40:34] so we're just hanging we're hanging in
[40:35] there never giving up refusing to
[40:37] surrender
[40:38] and those in christ have this virtue
[40:42] because we're trusting in a god
[40:45] that has a plan set for us he knows each
[40:48] step we take he knows the plan he's
[40:50] ordained our footsteps for the footages
[40:53] of the righteous are ordered of god and
[40:54] so we can stand in the face of all
[40:56] obstacles and run a patient race
[41:00] all right man
[41:03] now
[41:05] brother branham says do you think the
[41:07] heavenly father will be defeated in his
[41:09] purpose
[41:11] even though satan has done what he's
[41:13] done
[41:14] he says it's an impossibility
[41:17] he will not
[41:18] be
[41:19] defeated
[41:20] and he's given us perfect assurance that
[41:22] we will not have to be scared
[41:25] of anything that's why we can run in the
[41:27] face of danger that's why we can commit
[41:30] to the cause and we can stand in our
[41:32] position underneath the heavy load
[41:33] because his purpose that he's placed in
[41:36] your lifebuilder tim or any of your life
[41:38] it's going to come to pass is he scared
[41:40] is he going to be defeated god's purpose
[41:42] will never be defeated so in that take
[41:44] your rest and run with patience knowing
[41:47] at the appointed time promise will come
[41:50] to pass
[41:54] but so often we don't really
[41:59] now when we talk about promise i just
[42:01] want to we're going to tuck patients and
[42:02] and running with it here here
[42:05] but when we're looking at a promise that
[42:07] god has has given you
[42:09] and you're standing in it and you're
[42:10] running indeed with patience it can get
[42:13] it can get difficult because we're not
[42:15] seeing maybe something happening
[42:17] it's just there's not i see no signs
[42:20] nothing's transpiring there's nothing
[42:22] there to give me some feedback that that
[42:24] i'm making headway it's not there it's
[42:27] invisible
[42:30] i was pondering that a little bit
[42:33] and i was thinking about the process of
[42:35] life
[42:37] and actually the growth
[42:39] of human life
[42:41] and what is happening
[42:43] and you have no clue what's going on
[42:46] right
[42:48] like what's going on
[42:51] and so i have a little video just hold
[42:53] just we'll hold it there for a second
[42:55] and i'll take this three minutes
[42:57] because i want you to realize
[42:58] as we just go through this little
[43:00] message tonight little simple wednesday
[43:02] night
[43:03] that
[43:03] regardless of what you may see or hear
[43:06] or what your five senses here feel
[43:10] something very well could be transpiring
[43:12] you just have no you don't have a sense
[43:14] to see it except your faith
[43:17] accept your faith
[43:19] the sixth sense do not rely on your
[43:22] emotions and your affections and your
[43:24] memories and your you're you're touching
[43:25] you're feeling you're hearing all of
[43:26] that because you you're gonna miss the
[43:29] fact and the strength that you actually
[43:31] need knowing by faith it's actually
[43:33] happening but i don't see it happening
[43:36] so you're gonna look at an example that
[43:37] this happens so why don't you throw up
[43:39] the video
[43:41] yeah
[43:43] all right so we have a human cell
[43:45] and it's been fertilized and has just
[43:47] split
[43:48] this is just as fertilization and now
[43:51] the cell is splitting you have no clue
[43:52] this is happening
[43:54] this is like
[43:55] within hours 24 hours actually it begins
[43:58] to divide so this has happened within 24
[44:00] hours of fertilization and every 12 to
[44:02] 15 hours
[44:05] it continues to divide
[44:09] in about five days there's about 100
[44:11] cells
[44:14] you're saying what's happening i don't
[44:15] see life coming
[44:17] you know what's happening
[44:18] at such a microscopic level you don't
[44:20] know here's about 100 cells and it
[44:22] breaks forth
[44:23] from this coding and this protection it
[44:25] has and these cells now break forth and
[44:27] they implant themselves onto the womb
[44:29] and they actually don't just plant
[44:30] themselves there it actually then goes
[44:32] right into the lining
[44:34] of the membrane and now starts to grow
[44:37] continue to grow
[44:38] and the cells now which called is called
[44:40] gastrulation this is what's happening
[44:42] here and it's going to actually now
[44:43] start splitting and there's different
[44:44] layers of the cells that now start to
[44:46] grow
[44:47] and one layer starts to become you'll
[44:49] see in the little little
[44:51] video
[44:52] one becomes certain aspects of the body
[44:54] a third the middle layer becomes a
[44:55] certain aspect of the body and a bottom
[44:57] layer becomes a certain aspect of the
[44:59] body
[45:03] showing here lungs this is all happening
[45:06] and you have no clue
[45:08] you have no clue that life is in in
[45:10] formation
[45:13] as we as
[45:14] as you're living and you're like where's
[45:15] the problem where is it but it's
[45:17] happening here now you have a teeny
[45:19] teeny little
[45:20] not even an embryo yet this is his brain
[45:22] cells you can see the brain is still
[45:24] open and all the different cells are
[45:26] being formed and they're reaching out to
[45:27] each other
[45:28] and it's kind of now your organogenesis
[45:30] you're seeing the cells form of blood
[45:32] vessels as vessels and cells start going
[45:34] to their their areas of what they're
[45:36] what they're
[45:37] meant to become here's your heart the
[45:39] little little one's heart now beating
[45:41] very early in development he's about at
[45:43] about uh four and a half weeks in or so
[45:46] he's about five a fifth of an inch long
[45:48] in 30 days he's about the size of a red
[45:50] currant
[45:52] and here his little arms now are
[45:53] starting to break forth and butt out
[45:55] from the from the main body
[45:59] organs start to go in place and we have
[46:00] this teeny
[46:01] teeny little
[46:03] aspect of a child that's being formed
[46:04] that's
[46:05] barely even at the at the end of about
[46:07] 60 days they're not even an inch long
[46:09] and a third of an ounce in weight
[46:12] cells start to recede and where it was
[46:14] webbed one time they started to recede
[46:16] and now they're not webbed the cells
[46:18] diminish in certain areas and each cell
[46:20] has a function to play and this teeny
[46:22] little one you say he's like very small
[46:24] it's like this big you have no clue
[46:27] no
[46:28] clue that this is happening
[46:30] [Music]
[46:33] that's incredible
[46:36] i marvel
[46:38] at life
[46:39] i marvel at it
[46:41] and you see something like this how on
[46:43] earth
[46:44] can someone say there's no god
[46:47] how on earth
[46:48] can someone look at that and see the
[46:50] form who tells those cells to go and be
[46:52] an arm who tells that cell to be a blood
[46:55] vessel and go to the brain and form the
[46:57] brain cells who gives it that
[46:58] intelligence you're telling me evolution
[47:01] it's garbage
[47:03] it's god himself that does that
[47:07] who who is what is the life that gives
[47:10] those cells that unction
[47:12] god
[47:14] god
[47:15] amen
[47:16] and a miracle of life it takes his time
[47:18] and all the while someone says i don't
[47:20] my mama doesn't really feel anything and
[47:22] in the first 30 days she has no clue
[47:24] what's really going on but it's
[47:25] happening
[47:27] there's an appointed time of life it's
[47:29] happening even though you might not see
[47:30] it or feel it but god has it ordained
[47:33] and his purpose will come to pass
[47:37] i want you to take that into your own
[47:38] situation say i don't know if you have a
[47:40] need and i'm not seeing it come to pass
[47:43] but maybe it's just like that little one
[47:45] maybe cell upon cell maybe little arm
[47:47] cells maybe little liver cells that
[47:49] little heart starts to pump life is
[47:51] starting to pump just a few weeks deep
[47:53] and some life now is forming
[47:55] and your answer is on the way
[47:59] hallelujah
[48:00] amen
[48:07] all along life is growing inside
[48:11] hallelujah
[48:13] now abraham we're going to step back to
[48:15] our opening scripture
[48:17] abraham been in this waiting period
[48:21] for a long time
[48:23] abraham's been spoke on a lot
[48:25] but it's there because it's eternal
[48:27] god's word is eternal and it wouldn't
[48:29] matter if you've spoken it but i branham
[48:31] spoke talked about preaching on job for
[48:33] a very long time because god's word is
[48:35] eternal you could preach on abraham
[48:37] every service and something would strike
[48:40] your soul
[48:41] you could take the same scripture but
[48:43] it's eternal and so it will do something
[48:46] for you
[48:47] every time so do not do not say well
[48:49] i've heard about abraham over these
[48:50] years many times god's got something for
[48:52] you
[48:54] amen
[48:56] so here he was 25 years in the waiting
[49:00] and it's like nothing was happening
[49:02] and we're just going to walk through
[49:03] that here's 70 janet abraham is 75 years
[49:06] old when he leaves
[49:08] all right genesis 12
[49:09] i'll make thee a great nation
[49:12] now bless thee
[49:13] thy name make thy name great this is the
[49:15] lord speaking him out bless them that
[49:17] bless thee and curse them that curses
[49:19] thee so he's going to be a great nation
[49:21] here in 12 he's leaving he leaves his
[49:22] family behind he takes lot and his in
[49:25] different ones in his family sarah 65
[49:28] abraham 75 it's not that they're really
[49:30] young
[49:31] right out of the gates
[49:35] right
[49:36] we're already starting like really a
[49:38] great nation i'm 75.
[49:40] that's not abraham's
[49:42] response that's not his response abraham
[49:45] staggered not
[49:46] at the promise as the scriptures say
[49:48] amen
[49:49] and as far as abraham was concerned
[49:51] the appointed time
[49:53] was now
[49:55] i want you to hold on to that if you
[49:56] walk out of this service and you
[49:58] remember only one thing the appointed
[50:00] time is now my faith is believing for
[50:03] now it might be working and god has an
[50:05] appointed time ahead but your faith is
[50:07] anchoring lord this hour
[50:10] this next day this next minute that's
[50:12] where my faith is and abraham walked
[50:15] with a current faith every step of the
[50:17] way by my appointed time is now
[50:21] amen
[50:24] and so he ran patiently
[50:27] hey man he ran patiently
[50:30] enduring in the face of this you know
[50:32] dismay and questions and whichever doubt
[50:35] i'm sure as we'll get into things that
[50:37] i'm sure were said to him he didn't have
[50:39] it easy but he ran patiently
[50:43] genesis 13 and the lord said our
[50:45] neighbors the lord is speaking to him
[50:46] through the different chapters
[50:49] and said unto abram after lot has
[50:52] separated now
[50:53] lift up thine eyes and look to the place
[50:55] where thou art northward
[50:57] and southward and eastward and westward
[50:58] for the land which thou seest i'll give
[51:00] to the end thy seed
[51:02] forever
[51:04] see the promise is again raised up in
[51:06] front of his face and he's still
[51:07] believing amen you've confirmed it again
[51:09] lord and i'm believing it it's today
[51:12] i could have a baby in nine months from
[51:14] today he was he was believing for it
[51:16] current faith
[51:18] unhindered faith
[51:23] for all the land which i'll see us to
[51:24] thee i will i give thee thy seed forever
[51:26] and i will make thy seed as dust of the
[51:28] earth so that if a man can number the
[51:31] dust of the earth thy seed shall also be
[51:32] numbered he was getting a lofty promise
[51:36] a lofty promise
[51:38] and he was drinking it in
[51:40] he was drinking it
[51:41] kept believing hey man he continued to
[51:43] live he continued to fight because now
[51:45] he had to go down he had to go get lot
[51:47] out and
[51:48] what if he died i got a promise i'm
[51:51] going now why could he take his 318 men
[51:54] because he knew i got a lot of seed
[51:55] coming i've got a mighty nation that i'm
[51:57] promised so guess what lord i'm coming
[51:59] to get you and my 318 trained servants
[52:02] and i'm going to take the kings and
[52:04] annihilate them and bring bring you back
[52:06] because he was promised a mighty nation
[52:08] and mighty seed so my he could he could
[52:10] go with quite caught with some serious
[52:11] confidence
[52:14] genesis 15.
[52:16] after these things the word of the lord
[52:18] came to abram in a vision saying fear
[52:20] not abram i am thy shield and thy
[52:22] exceeding great reward
[52:24] abram said lord god
[52:26] what will doubt give me
[52:28] seeing i go childless
[52:31] and the steward of my house is eliezer
[52:32] of damascus and abraham abram said
[52:35] behold to me thou hast given no seed and
[52:38] lo one born in my house is mine heir
[52:41] and behold the word of the lord came
[52:42] unto him saying this shall not be thine
[52:45] heir but he shall come forth out of
[52:47] thine own bowels and shall be thine air
[52:50] oh thank you lord he reaffirmed it again
[52:52] oh god where's where's the promise it's
[52:54] coming i've got to heir for you out of
[52:56] your own bowels amen lord and so he kept
[52:58] going current faith again he kept going
[53:01] a staggering knot at the promise
[53:04] it was an appointed time
[53:06] amen current
[53:08] always looking
[53:11] so here he goes
[53:12] and we hit chapter 16.
[53:17] chapter 16 is where we have
[53:19] sarah saying
[53:21] listen
[53:23] i'm not having a child
[53:24] take hagar
[53:30] anytime
[53:31] you inject your own thoughts or your own
[53:34] ideas
[53:35] into god's plan
[53:37] you're gonna get an ishmael
[53:40] any time and it brings disruption
[53:44] oh does it bring disruption
[53:46] never inject our own idea never well i
[53:50] don't know what god promised it and
[53:51] abraham staggered naught at it he didn't
[53:53] even know how it happened and here sarah
[53:54] and i was saying hey just to take agar
[53:56] it isn't going to be me it's going to be
[53:57] haggard it's not your scene no that was
[53:59] not the perfect plan that was not the
[54:02] perfect way and here hagar he's 86
[54:06] he's 86.
[54:08] okay we've been like 11 years that he's
[54:10] been staggering not 11 years letter
[54:12] brown says and sarah even to who the
[54:14] promised sarah being a woman which is
[54:16] the type of the church gave doubt to the
[54:17] original program of god's promised word
[54:19] you abraham my husband take under this
[54:21] beautiful maid and be her husband and
[54:23] god will give this seat a promise
[54:25] through her and i'll take the child
[54:26] bypassing one little i o to change the
[54:29] whole program he said therefore we've
[54:31] got to take every word of god as thus
[54:35] saith the lord
[54:37] every word of god don't mix it don't
[54:39] bring in man's that's why that's why
[54:41] this message came and you drew a fine
[54:43] straight dividing line
[54:45] if it was the word that's the word if
[54:47] it's man's ideas if it's on baptism
[54:50] serpent seed i don't care what it is if
[54:52] there's just something a little bit off
[54:54] it's an iota off and it's of the devil
[54:56] himself and it's there to disrupt the
[54:58] plan of god
[55:00] and sarah thinking that god would not be
[55:02] able to keep all his promises true
[55:04] oh my
[55:06] i highlighted that and sarah thinking
[55:08] that god would not
[55:10] be able to keep all his promise true and
[55:13] so she told abraham to take hagar lord
[55:16] help us
[55:17] not to doubt in the power of our god
[55:21] she actually doubted that he couldn't
[55:22] fulfill that promise
[55:24] my goodness and god it got a lot of
[55:27] issues out of it got an ishmael out of
[55:29] that
[55:30] careful
[55:32] one little aspect of our thought major
[55:34] major mess and you combine your
[55:36] direction things think things going to
[55:38] work the plan of god i said be careful
[55:40] because you might have an ishmael on
[55:42] your hands and brother braham says two
[55:44] wives doubted the promise he's talking
[55:45] about hagar and he goes but what kind of
[55:47] man was he the bible said speaking of
[55:50] ishmael was a wild man lived by his bow
[55:53] no man would conquer him untamable
[55:54] unconvertible and unregenerated he could
[55:57] not be tamed and that's exactly what
[55:59] would happen to your own ideas or what
[56:02] comes out of it it's untameable it's
[56:04] unconvertible because it's it's it's
[56:06] been combined you've mixed the word of
[56:08] god with your own ideas and it's just
[56:10] like that it would not be tamed and it's
[56:12] wild
[56:14] a wild thought
[56:16] and anything that's contrary any
[56:18] preacher any lame member any church
[56:21] that's contrary to god's word will bring
[56:23] forth a wild adulterous bunch of worldly
[56:25] hollywood who can't not stay with the
[56:26] unadulterated word because it's not even
[56:29] included in the promise
[56:32] that's as straight as it gets
[56:34] moral the story stay with the word
[56:37] that's where it is you don't want that
[56:39] you do need not need someone coming in
[56:41] with sarah doubting are you coming in
[56:43] with the devil throwing in some thoughts
[56:45] doubting the promise no sir nothing
[56:47] anything contrary that will bring forth
[56:49] an adulterous bunch of worldly hollywood
[56:51] don't mix your ideas and water things
[56:53] down well i think i could do that and
[56:55] you know it's okay to to listen to these
[56:57] kind of things it's okay to watch that
[56:58] kind of thing it's an adulterous bunch
[57:00] of hollywood
[57:02] stay away from it
[57:07] genesis 17
[57:09] again
[57:10] god speaks and says
[57:12] it's coming
[57:14] and abraham's got current faith
[57:16] he is believing that it's coming as for
[57:19] me behold my covenant is with thee and
[57:21] thou shalt be a father of many nations
[57:23] neither shall thy name more be called
[57:25] abram now he's getting a name changed
[57:27] but thy name shall be abraham for a
[57:29] father of many nations have i made thee
[57:31] and god then says about sarah and i will
[57:34] bless her and give thee a son also of
[57:36] her now he's reconfirming it more i will
[57:39] bless her and she shall be a mother of
[57:41] nations all right and so abraham now is
[57:44] is continually saying god helping him
[57:46] maybe he's dropping a word it's coming
[57:48] the promise is coming you're anchored
[57:49] your faith is holding on to it lord i
[57:51] believe you i believe you come you've
[57:53] brought me this far you've kept me this
[57:54] far i'm still believing you have a
[57:56] promise my sons my daughters my healing
[57:59] whatever it is i believe it i believe it
[58:00] but there is gonna come a point in time
[58:03] an appointed time in season in genesis
[58:06] 18 and the lord appeared unto him in the
[58:09] plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent
[58:11] door in the heat of the day
[58:15] and here's now abraham
[58:18] brother brown says a hot day
[58:20] it wasn't an easy time
[58:23] he says perhaps
[58:25] a lot of complaints
[58:27] been coming in lately from the herdsmen
[58:30] grass is all gone
[58:32] it's hot
[58:34] grass has dried up
[58:35] land is drying up
[58:37] the cattle's very thin
[58:39] water supply is about gone
[58:42] it found water hole in the holes but now
[58:44] it got so low they're trying to dig it
[58:45] out of the out of the ground where the
[58:47] water was seeping through the rocks the
[58:49] cattle still didn't have enough water
[58:52] and it was a tough time
[58:55] and he's hearing all this
[58:58] and he goes to his tent door
[59:00] and sits down
[59:02] brother bram says many times we see
[59:03] disastrous things happening like that
[59:05] especially to believers we must bear
[59:07] this in our mind
[59:09] it's satan
[59:10] trying to block the blessing
[59:13] that's on the road
[59:15] glory
[59:17] you see that happening all the troubles
[59:19] and strife and this is going on and this
[59:21] is going on this is battering your mind
[59:23] and your weight down oh god what's going
[59:25] on in this situation what's happening in
[59:27] this situation this is happening in my
[59:29] home oh what and he goes to his tent and
[59:31] he sits down but abram says he's
[59:33] probably praying
[59:35] and he said just just think
[59:37] it's just satan trying to block the
[59:38] blessing that's on the road
[59:40] same was trying to tempt them to feel
[59:42] that they'd done wrong let's let's think
[59:44] he goes let's he goes let's think that
[59:46] sarah being that she'd done what she did
[59:48] let's think she was kind of a little
[59:49] fussy that morning
[59:51] i love brother brennam's when he goes
[59:53] into the details my goodness it's
[59:55] beautiful fussy that morning she says
[59:57] you know abraham
[59:59] you know the supplies are getting low
[1:00:00] here
[1:00:01] and herdsmen says the patches are all
[1:00:03] dried up and the water holes and i think
[1:00:05] you made the wrong decision
[1:00:08] when you chose to come up here and let
[1:00:09] lot and mrs law and their family live
[1:00:11] down there with plenty
[1:00:12] while the other day or some time ago
[1:00:14] rather i went to the city and missed lot
[1:00:15] and had one of the prettiest dresses i
[1:00:17] ever seen it was styled by them
[1:00:18] egyptians and while a camel caravan came
[1:00:20] through and she got new styles there's
[1:00:22] just no such thing as them caravans and
[1:00:24] styles coming through here
[1:00:26] not up in the dry plains of mammary
[1:00:32] don't begin to rise
[1:00:34] on the things of this land
[1:00:37] right we don't belong here we don't
[1:00:39] belong in this life of ease and trying
[1:00:41] to make it easier on us this is not our
[1:00:43] home a man i'm just passing through i'm
[1:00:45] not looking at the passions of the
[1:00:47] egyptians or the fashions of wherever in
[1:00:49] france and who who knows who cares where
[1:00:51] and here brother bradman is giving a
[1:00:52] little insight he's saying maybe you
[1:00:54] made the wrong call maybe this isn't
[1:00:56] where we should be maybe we should have
[1:00:58] gone somewhere else it's real tough work
[1:01:00] out here trying to make a living and
[1:01:02] he's sitting now here praying at his
[1:01:04] tent
[1:01:05] not an easy morning anybody have those
[1:01:07] kind of mornings sometimes or sunday
[1:01:08] mornings right things is to get all
[1:01:10] fussy right because you're coming but
[1:01:12] there's a blessing on its way you're
[1:01:14] coming to church you're coming to
[1:01:15] service and satan's fighting you hard
[1:01:17] because he knows there's something down
[1:01:19] the road for you amen look at the
[1:01:21] spiritual realm don't look at this
[1:01:22] natural realm all these difficulties
[1:01:24] it's hard i get it i live there too i'm
[1:01:26] human i got flesh and blood it worries
[1:01:29] our minds but it's look up for your
[1:01:31] redemption draw of nigh let's get our
[1:01:33] eyes off this land get our eyes off
[1:01:35] these troubles and say god get me out of
[1:01:37] here
[1:01:39] [Music]
[1:01:41] my but she knowed
[1:01:45] butter brown says but
[1:01:46] if she just knowed
[1:01:49] if she just know there was more than a
[1:01:51] caravan coming through
[1:01:54] oh my she just knowed what was coming
[1:01:56] down the way just a little down the path
[1:01:58] around the bend that she couldn't see
[1:02:00] she's all fussing and wondering and
[1:02:02] worrying but down the road was something
[1:02:04] more than a caravan there was a host of
[1:02:07] the lord coming their way
[1:02:09] glory
[1:02:10] my goodness just around the corner could
[1:02:12] be the host of the lord that angel's
[1:02:14] been striving he's been fighting against
[1:02:15] the prince of persia and he's coming to
[1:02:16] give you your answer hold on don't fuss
[1:02:19] it
[1:02:21] it's coming your way
[1:02:24] and little poor abraham faithful brother
[1:02:28] didn't shake him one bit
[1:02:31] glory
[1:02:32] amen
[1:02:36] how we don't
[1:02:38] get all fussed up
[1:02:40] not shaking
[1:02:41] thought abraham says he gets in his
[1:02:43] chair
[1:02:44] sits down
[1:02:46] i see the old faithful servant
[1:02:48] bows his head maybe sarah a little fussy
[1:02:51] but he just let it go
[1:02:53] and he began to think back
[1:02:55] now here's here's a here's a little
[1:02:57] truth here's a nugget for you
[1:02:59] and he began to think back
[1:03:01] in the thick
[1:03:02] of the troubles
[1:03:05] sarah might have been all right she was
[1:03:06] all she was right the herds were having
[1:03:08] issues the grass was drying up there
[1:03:10] wasn't this wasn't false stuff
[1:03:12] but it wasn't shaken abraham
[1:03:14] won't shake sons and daughters of god
[1:03:17] that's what the word comes for to girl
[1:03:18] us up and he says
[1:03:21] but abraham says
[1:03:22] he began to think back
[1:03:25] how many great blessings
[1:03:27] god has given me
[1:03:29] he started to encourage himself in what
[1:03:32] god has done for him you get in that
[1:03:34] moment and all that fussing and all the
[1:03:36] issues of life you just take a step back
[1:03:38] you take your seat you put it by your
[1:03:39] doorway you sit down and don't you get
[1:03:41] on it yeah that's right oh that's brutal
[1:03:43] how do how are we going to get through
[1:03:45] that you sit down say wow
[1:03:47] all the goodness god has done for me all
[1:03:50] the blessings he's given me look at my
[1:03:52] home he saved me he's kept me back there
[1:03:55] he healed me back there he delivered me
[1:03:57] here he delivered my son here he healed
[1:03:59] my wife
[1:04:00] that's what he pondered on there he led
[1:04:02] me there he provided my herds with
[1:04:04] when i was in need that's what abraham
[1:04:07] pondered on oh the blessings of the lord
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:13] and here is he's doing that as he's in
[1:04:15] his mind he's worshipping and he's
[1:04:17] praising the lord in his thoughts and
[1:04:19] he's encouraging himself in what god had
[1:04:21] done for him and here he looks up and
[1:04:24] lifts up his eyes and who is coming his
[1:04:27] way lo three men coming down when he saw
[1:04:31] them look at the thoughts he was in he
[1:04:33] was already in an atmosphere he was
[1:04:36] already in the presence of god so when
[1:04:38] he looked up and he saw god himself
[1:04:40] coming down the pathway with two mighty
[1:04:42] angels he ran forward and what did he do
[1:04:44] the scripture says he ran to meet them
[1:04:46] from the tent and bowed himself on the
[1:04:49] ground and worshipped him
[1:04:51] glory when you're in that situation then
[1:04:54] you're pondering what god has been doing
[1:04:56] get up then and run to him and worship
[1:04:58] him first
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:01] hallelujah
[1:05:02] bow down to the crown say oh god i'm
[1:05:05] needy but you are the great one set my
[1:05:08] knees aside put them behind me at first
[1:05:10] i'm gonna give you the praise that first
[1:05:13] and foremost i'm gonna honor you for
[1:05:15] you're the king of glory you're the
[1:05:16] great i am you're the rose of sharon oh
[1:05:19] god i adore you and that's where abraham
[1:05:22] went that's how his encounter began was
[1:05:24] in worship when god came his way
[1:05:27] amen
[1:05:29] hallelujah
[1:05:30] [Music]
[1:05:31] oh he said my lord
[1:05:34] my lord if i found favor and thy side
[1:05:37] pass not away
[1:05:38] oh cleave to his feet god don't go past
[1:05:42] me don't just come and come by say hi
[1:05:44] abraham oh god he said pass not away
[1:05:50] oh my
[1:05:52] i say if you reach out tonight
[1:05:54] god coming by your way tonight say i
[1:05:57] need to i've come out i'm running for my
[1:05:59] tent i'm running from my door god is
[1:06:01] coming by there's an appointed time for
[1:06:04] me
[1:06:04] fall down and speak tonight and say god
[1:06:07] don't pass me by
[1:06:10] hallelujah
[1:06:12] hallelujah
[1:06:14] this is your
[1:06:16] time hallelujah
[1:06:19] and now the promise
[1:06:21] is drawing nigh
[1:06:23] to abraham
[1:06:25] the promise is drawing nigh
[1:06:27] he's been holding his faith he's been
[1:06:29] steadfast this whole time but little
[1:06:31] does he know like that mama didn't know
[1:06:34] something was growing inside of her cell
[1:06:37] upon cell but there's now coming a time
[1:06:39] something it's very near to where he's
[1:06:41] gonna feel it
[1:06:48] hallelujah
[1:06:50] is anything too hard for god
[1:06:54] oh sir
[1:06:56] now the promise
[1:06:58] comes once more and abraham worships him
[1:07:02] worships the lord
[1:07:04] communes with him
[1:07:05] breaks bread brings a calf
[1:07:08] bake some cakes
[1:07:09] and they commute around the fire
[1:07:12] and this in our opening scripture god
[1:07:14] then it says again the promise once more
[1:07:17] but now it's a little more detail
[1:07:19] now it's a little more detail i had the
[1:07:21] time appointed
[1:07:23] i will return unto thee
[1:07:25] according to the time of life so it's
[1:07:27] now narrowed down a little bit it's not
[1:07:29] just out there but now with the time
[1:07:31] appointed all right lord you have an
[1:07:33] appointed time okay at the time of life
[1:07:36] and so now abraham is he's now he's his
[1:07:39] faith is rising up a little bit more now
[1:07:41] and the promise to him has come and the
[1:07:43] appointed time was right around the
[1:07:46] corner
[1:07:49] right around the corner
[1:07:52] you know
[1:07:54] there's a right place in the right time
[1:07:58] and as we said don't settle for ishmael
[1:08:01] we need isaac
[1:08:03] wrong place wrong time
[1:08:05] right
[1:08:06] wrong time
[1:08:07] and wrong person
[1:08:09] hagar
[1:08:10] wrong time but here we had abraham with
[1:08:12] hagar was actually the right seed but it
[1:08:14] was wrong place
[1:08:16] his wrong womb
[1:08:17] at the wrong time
[1:08:18] abraham was sarah
[1:08:20] all past
[1:08:21] right seat
[1:08:23] right womb wrong time there was an
[1:08:25] appointed time for a pointed season
[1:08:27] don't rush god's plan just stay in it
[1:08:30] abraham stayed in it he staggered not he
[1:08:32] was running patiently but then the
[1:08:34] appointed time came to pass amen
[1:08:38] everything now was in place for the
[1:08:40] promise to now move forward amen and
[1:08:42] impatiently they were enduring but now
[1:08:45] now the appointed time
[1:08:47] life was now coming forth
[1:08:54] hallelujah
[1:08:58] there's an appointed time
[1:08:59] that god has an and your faith may it be
[1:09:02] so fervently anchored that it could be
[1:09:05] the next day it could be the next hour
[1:09:08] and there abraham at some point then
[1:09:11] we'll get to it here we won't get ahead
[1:09:12] of ourselves
[1:09:13] i'm going to ask you
[1:09:15] do you think abraham had mind battles
[1:09:19] all right so now when you sing father
[1:09:21] abraham had many abraham staggered not
[1:09:24] for 20 years
[1:09:25] he had mind battles too
[1:09:27] just like you do
[1:09:30] he was 99
[1:09:32] when this moment happened he was 86 or
[1:09:35] so with ishmael and from 86 to 99 with
[1:09:38] ishmael my goodness i can only imagine
[1:09:40] how he must have kicked himself man
[1:09:43] goodness what does it do how often would
[1:09:45] he have con felt the condemnation you
[1:09:47] jesus got outside of the promises satan
[1:09:49] would come there and hit him and hit him
[1:09:50] hard you think that happened
[1:09:52] happens to you it happened to him but he
[1:09:54] ran patiently he staggered not at the
[1:09:57] promise of course satan's gonna come of
[1:09:59] course he's gonna try to put
[1:10:00] condemnation on you of course he's gonna
[1:10:02] throw the thoughts on you but stag or
[1:10:03] not

[1:10:17] nations he's been holding the promise in
[1:10:18] front of him
[1:10:19] and hear that what do you think the
[1:10:20] campus said well now you have an ishmael

[1:10:49] you know what's in your mind you know
[1:10:51] you know you know what you lived through
[1:10:54] but ram says
[1:10:56] speaking about abraham when he said come
[1:10:57] out from amongst the people
[1:10:59] he says think of it doubters unbelievers
[1:11:01] they'll they'll have you in the same fix
[1:11:02] come out and separate yourself he said
[1:11:04] leave all your conscience and your
[1:11:05] senses behind like that open your mind
[1:11:08] and remember me come live with me speak
[1:11:10] with abraham coming out but he goes

[1:11:15] great battle is on now worldwide god
[1:11:18] wants his children separating themselves
[1:11:20] from what see taste smell here
[1:11:23] imaginations conscience memories reasons
[1:11:25] affections everything
[1:11:27] set it aside abraham had to set it aside
[1:11:31] whatever that is i'm staying in the
[1:11:33] promise god has promised i might have he
[1:11:35] might have made a hiccup there but he
[1:11:37] didn't waver from it he says i'm moving
[1:11:39] on from it i'm running patiently now
[1:11:48] you know faith has no hindrances
[1:11:50] i read this quote last service
[1:11:54] brother brown says faith holds on
[1:11:57] faith holds it it wields it he says
[1:12:00] now you may not be strong enough he says
[1:12:01] that arm of faith to cut a hole all the
[1:12:03] way somebody might have some great big
[1:12:05] large faith and just rock and there's a
[1:12:08] big hole in this in in the situation he
[1:12:10] goes
[1:12:11] but he goes all and walk through it some
[1:12:14] candy goes but just keep punching
[1:12:17] just keep puncting you might be able to
[1:12:20] wield some big strong arm and whack it
[1:12:22] and make a big hole but give it a speed
[1:12:23] bag
[1:12:26] and that
[1:12:27] beat by beat you're going to keep put
[1:12:28] you're going to put a little hole in
[1:12:29] there
[1:12:30] you just give the devil make him a speed
[1:12:32] bag hang him right there hang him in
[1:12:34] here hang his doubt right in front of
[1:12:35] you
[1:12:37] every morning get into prayer
[1:12:39] get your faith going you might not have
[1:12:41] the big monster arm whap
[1:12:43] but you might have enough little faith
[1:12:45] to rattle that speed bag rattle that
[1:12:47] devil
[1:12:50] amen but without faith
[1:12:53] it doesn't say without great faith it
[1:12:55] just says without faith you've got
[1:12:56] mustard seed faith that's all you need
[1:12:59] to move mountains without faith it's
[1:13:01] impossible to please
[1:13:02] him all right for he that cometh to god
[1:13:05] must believe that he is and he's a
[1:13:07] rewarder
[1:13:08] of them that diligently seek him amen
[1:13:11] you ain't coming to him on your
[1:13:13] affection or on your imagination you
[1:13:15] come to him on faith in his word
[1:13:18] amen
[1:13:20] well i don't feel good today
[1:13:22] feelings
[1:13:24] that's how we're coming it's a hindrance
[1:13:26] i tried but it just didn't work out you
[1:13:29] know i tried and never nothing happened
[1:13:31] memory cast aside
[1:13:34] well what if it just doesn't happen this
[1:13:35] time
[1:13:36] and this and this could happen
[1:13:37] imagination
[1:13:39] cast it aside
[1:13:40] amen if he doesn't agree with the word
[1:13:42] get rid of it abraham had to do the same
[1:13:44] thing i'm sure he had a whole lot of
[1:13:47] doubts he had a whole lot of
[1:13:48] opportunities for people to give him
[1:13:49] some reasons too but he had to set it
[1:13:51] aside i'm seeking a city who's builder
[1:13:54] maker is god he's making me a mighty
[1:13:56] nation god spoke to him god speak to you
[1:13:59] anchor on it
[1:14:02] mine may your faith rise i was thinking
[1:14:04] and we mentioned again but i just wanted
[1:14:06] to ponder just mention it this service
[1:14:08] as well thinking of that little
[1:14:10] lady who came before jesus
[1:14:13] verbum says she had many hindrances this
[1:14:15] little greek woman
[1:14:17] and fate and but her faith didn't have
[1:14:19] any as we said faith don't have
[1:14:21] hindrances nothing can hinder faith lots
[1:14:24] of things can be hindered you can be
[1:14:26] shaken away at your memory and it can
[1:14:28] rattle but faith is not rattlable it i
[1:14:30] don't care what random says don't care
[1:14:32] what anybody else says nothing hinders
[1:14:34] it let let's see he says some of these
[1:14:36] mites that could have happened to her
[1:14:40] she was a greek not even a jew
[1:14:43] and you can imagine she would have been
[1:14:45] very scorned
[1:14:46] scorned in the crowd what is she even
[1:14:48] doing there she would have been a misfit
[1:14:51] in that area being a greek in that in
[1:14:53] the jewish crowd and brother brown says
[1:14:54] but even when she got there jesus said
[1:14:57] i'm not even sent to your race this is
[1:14:59] better brown's words i'm not even sent
[1:15:01] to your race and besides they that they
[1:15:04] are nothing but a bunch of dogs
[1:15:07] oh my
[1:15:09] come on dude i know we've read the
[1:15:10] scripture you've read the story
[1:15:12] but dear goodness put yourself in the
[1:15:14] shoes and put your personality there put
[1:15:17] you put you there and say you're a dog
[1:15:21] and i'm not even coming to your race
[1:15:23] in this day and age that should hit home
[1:15:28] come on now
[1:15:31] but nothing
[1:15:33] your feelings your affections your ideas
[1:15:37] of what the culture aspects of the day
[1:15:39] it don't care what it is her faith is
[1:15:42] what was unhinderable
[1:15:46] oh my what would that have done what
[1:15:48] would you have done ask yourself that
[1:15:50] and be honest somebody snubbed why if
[1:15:53] you don't even get prayed for the first
[1:15:55] night you claim you ain't coming back no
[1:15:56] more this is better brandon saying that
[1:15:58] he says oh if i don't get prayed for
[1:16:00] fine then then you've got faith he says
[1:16:03] yeah
[1:16:04] now remember this tape goes all over the
[1:16:06] world i'm just not pointing my finger
[1:16:07] here i'm pointing it everywhere he says
[1:16:09] no he says no you can't even sit and
[1:16:12] listen to the meeting through you see
[1:16:14] yeah i've got faith and you can't even
[1:16:16] sit through a meeting or lots of faith
[1:16:20] this is your prophet
[1:16:24] what if she had stopped what if she
[1:16:26] hadn't pressed what if she had she had
[1:16:29] what if she hadn't worked to the crowds
[1:16:30] as we said in the scripture from last
[1:16:32] service you ran well but what hindered
[1:16:34] you as we were speaking but she didn't
[1:16:36] she was running with patience it didn't
[1:16:38] really matter what the obstacle was she
[1:16:40] had that stick-to-itiveness it was her
[1:16:42] faith that was unhinderable like abraham
[1:16:44] who said there's a time appointed for me
[1:16:46] and i'm pressing in it with my faith
[1:16:47] that i'm gonna go forward i don't really
[1:16:49] care what he calls me i don't care if
[1:16:51] i'm a greek i don't go to your race all
[1:16:53] she cared she said lord
[1:16:55] yay lord
[1:16:57] but even the dogs
[1:16:59] get the crumbs is that your faith
[1:17:01] tonight i just need a crumb god i don't
[1:17:04] really care of the situation but my
[1:17:06] faith is reaching
[1:17:10] well i'm going to be people are going to
[1:17:11] call you names if you follow him but
[1:17:13] abram goes on he says oh well you go to
[1:17:16] that church your family's going to leave
[1:17:18] you oh i follow that you follow that man
[1:17:20] jesus and mock you and scorn you nothing
[1:17:23] nothing hindered her she could have been
[1:17:25] the only greek there and that was
[1:17:27] probably was but there she was pressing
[1:17:29] through it all with patient faith
[1:17:32] reaching through and obtaining
[1:17:34] the promise
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:42] now i'm have to gird up my loins for
[1:17:44] this next part
[1:17:45] because i either go by really fast or
[1:17:48] you shut her down
[1:17:50] lord help me i'll just
[1:17:52] come to uh work our way to a close here
[1:17:58] wow
[1:17:59] i love his word it goes by too fast up
[1:18:01] here i sure hope it's not dragging down
[1:18:03] there
[1:18:04] glory glory
[1:18:06] amen
[1:18:08] amen isaiah 9 6
[1:18:10] said a virgin shall conceive
[1:18:12] and it sat there
[1:18:14] for a long time
[1:18:16] dormant
[1:18:19] nothing
[1:18:20] was happening
[1:18:22] so it seemed
[1:18:24] nothing was happening but waiting
[1:18:27] for an appointed time
[1:18:29] when that word
[1:18:31] that was spoken by a prophet would land
[1:18:35] on the correct betting ground
[1:18:37] it went forth through time and there had
[1:18:40] to be a seed in this person and that
[1:18:41] person that this wasn't quite right so
[1:18:44] god was guiding the lineages guiding
[1:18:46] where was he had a purpose in mind he
[1:18:48] had appointed time i'll tell you what he
[1:18:50] had appointed time he had appointed time
[1:18:52] for life jesus christ was to come on the
[1:18:55] scene in flesh and he's like i gotta
[1:18:56] work this out i've spoken my word but
[1:18:59] there's somebody that's gonna receive it
[1:19:02] with a with a betting ground of faith
[1:19:04] that's gonna believe exactly what i've
[1:19:06] said
[1:19:10] amen
[1:19:12] and mary received that word into her
[1:19:15] womb but abram speaks about into her
[1:19:17] virgin mind into her womb and received
[1:19:20] it first
[1:19:21] in her mind and believed it and then it
[1:19:24] started to work inside of her amen
[1:19:28] brings forth and what did it bring forth
[1:19:30] but it brought forth christ
[1:19:33] brother brahma says mary by no
[1:19:35] relationship at all but believe the
[1:19:36] promised word when she was a virgin
[1:19:38] knowing no man and the angel lord met
[1:19:40] her hail mary
[1:19:41] blessed art thou amongst the women for
[1:19:44] god is with me and she's like how is
[1:19:46] these things how shall these things be
[1:19:48] shiva said she was actually troubled
[1:19:50] troubled
[1:19:52] my goodness
[1:19:53] she said an angel lord said the holy
[1:19:55] ghost shall overshadow you
[1:19:58] it had never been done
[1:20:00] in the ages
[1:20:01] this wasn't like well you know i could
[1:20:03] see it happen before there
[1:20:05] you know oh so-and-so was healed of
[1:20:07] cancer there
[1:20:09] and so i can point back and draw
[1:20:10] strength from that no no it had never
[1:20:13] happened before she was believing
[1:20:15] something that was completely
[1:20:17] undone it was never transpired a virgin
[1:20:20] shall conceive
[1:20:23] never done in the ages but mary
[1:20:26] believed god
[1:20:28] amen mary believed god and she said
[1:20:31] behold the handmaid of the lord amen he
[1:20:34] said but here she's asked to believe
[1:20:36] that a contribution to the faith that
[1:20:38] was in abraham who believed the
[1:20:39] impossible as long as god said so that
[1:20:42] makes it right
[1:20:44] glory the appointed time for life was
[1:20:47] now coming
[1:20:49] amen but it needed a vessel it needed a
[1:20:52] vessel that could believe the impossible
[1:20:56] god needs a vessel that will believe the
[1:20:58] impossible i don't have time to go
[1:21:00] through it but there is an appointed
[1:21:01] time there was a word that came down the
[1:21:03] ages and god is looking for a virgin
[1:21:06] bride that will receive his word because
[1:21:08] the eve fell and doubted and sarah and
[1:21:11] hagar and all the types through but god
[1:21:13] said there will be a bride at an
[1:21:15] appointed time my goodness
[1:21:19] who's that it's a people that can
[1:21:21] receive the impossible
[1:21:24] and believe it well you know satan
[1:21:27] they'll all laugh at you
[1:21:28] little rosy cheek girl they'll laugh and
[1:21:31] you say oh yeah you're the bride you're
[1:21:32] going to be in a rapture you're going to
[1:21:34] be the spoken word who's the original
[1:21:36] seed uh-huh that's exactly who i am oh
[1:21:39] but they'll all laugh at you
[1:21:40] it don't really matter i ain't paying
[1:21:42] attention to it i don't have any plan to
[1:21:44] stay here right and up in judea she went
[1:21:46] you know i'm going to have a baby and
[1:21:48] before she left felt anything before she
[1:21:52] felt anything
[1:21:55] that was happening
[1:21:56] the womb was being stirred the holy
[1:21:58] ghost had planted a seed and an egg of
[1:22:00] the holy ghost and it was starting to
[1:22:02] move and she didn't feel a thing i'm
[1:22:04] having a baby
[1:22:08] because the word
[1:22:10] had already been set there
[1:22:12] you are for ordained before the
[1:22:14] foundation of the world there's a seed
[1:22:16] inside of you
[1:22:18] it's been their pre-plan and when the
[1:22:19] word of the hour came across your path
[1:22:22] it ignited something and it started to
[1:22:24] work it started to grow so i don't feel
[1:22:26] nothing you might have been in this bits
[1:22:28] of sin and then someone dropped a book
[1:22:30] or someone spoke something and something
[1:22:32] started to grow life started to grow
[1:22:34] started to manifest and at some point it
[1:22:37] started you started to see it

[1:23:10] oh mary said be according to me she was
[1:23:12] walking out of there going to be scorned
[1:23:14] and ridiculed for the rest of her life
[1:23:18] it wasn't like today where someone has a
[1:23:21] illegitimate child people don't bat an
[1:23:23] eye

[1:24:18] isaiah 9 6 to mary's day
[1:24:22] as it was in the days of lot
[1:24:25] was spoken the scriptures
[1:24:27] as it was in the days of noah who spoke
[1:24:29] in scriptures
[1:24:31] we aren't at the beginning of isaiah 9 6
[1:24:33] where it was 400 years until mary we are
[1:24:37] at the revealing
[1:24:38] of the son of man he has been revealed
[1:24:41] we are here at this day it isn't dormant
[1:24:43] anymore it hasn't been sitting there for
[1:24:45] hundreds of years we're at a very
[1:24:47] different time i wrote news flash
[1:24:49] it ain't dormant
[1:24:51] this isn't dormant seed oh sorry because
[1:24:54] when elohim appeared the promise was
[1:24:56] moments away when elohim came before
[1:24:59] abraham it was just around the corner in
[1:25:02] fact what happened we talk a lot about
[1:25:05] abraham and him staggering not of the
[1:25:07] promise but i want to tell you i can
[1:25:09] just imagine what would have happened
[1:25:10] when elohim left sodom was burned but
[1:25:13] guess what was happening up on the
[1:25:15] plains of mammary
[1:25:17] a little tinkling started happening in
[1:25:20] sarah
[1:25:21] about 30 days hence uh-huh i'm feeling a
[1:25:24] little different
[1:25:25] you are
[1:25:26] uh uh-huh
[1:25:27] things started to change i can imagine
[1:25:30] the next nine months were pure joy in
[1:25:33] that in that tent in that camp abraham
[1:25:35] was moving around
[1:25:37] i believed him and there's a promise it
[1:25:39] was growing it was growing a little bit
[1:25:41] more it was going on every day and he
[1:25:43] was really come on there was a lot of
[1:25:45] rejoicing as the word was manifesting
[1:25:47] itself and there's the same amount of
[1:25:49] rejoicing because this day when this
[1:25:51] word has been revealed to this hour it's
[1:25:53] growing and manifesting at harvest time
[1:25:56] there's a maturing going on and the word
[1:25:58] of god the seed has entered the wood of
[1:26:01] a virgin bride and it's manifesting time
[1:26:06] hallelujah
[1:26:08] it's happening inside you saints
[1:26:10] god is being manifested through his
[1:26:12] bride in this last day the song we've
[1:26:14] caught the revelation amen what to
[1:26:17] produce the word the pure word of god
