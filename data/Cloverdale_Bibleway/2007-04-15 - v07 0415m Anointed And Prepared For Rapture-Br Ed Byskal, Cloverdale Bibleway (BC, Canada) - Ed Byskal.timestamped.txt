[7:39] heart. And then
[7:41] brother Larry met me for his niece
[7:44] that's called and and asked us to pray
[7:47] and I thought he's our strong defense.

[8:42] and all the way.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; You were here before the world began.
[8:58] Above all kingoms,
[9:03] above all,
[9:05] [Music]
[9:07] above all wonderers
[9:10] the world has ever

[9:50] Protected and alone
[9:54] like a rom
[9:59] on the ground.
[10:03] You took the fall
[10:07] and thought of me
[10:11] [Music]
[10:14] crucified.
[10:17] You were crucified,
[10:23] laid behind the stone.
[10:27] You live
[10:29] to die.
[10:32] Rejected and alone like a rose
[10:39] trampled on the ground.
[10:42] [Music]

[11:22] trampled on the ground.

[11:31] [Music]
[11:32] and thought of me
[11:41] [Music]
[11:42] &gt;&gt; and ask brother Dier if you'd come and
[11:44] open the service in a word of prayer.
[11:46] You know just because we don't have a
[11:47] long list of prayer requests doesn't
[11:49] mean that there aren't needs among us.
[11:50] Amen. And we just want to let the Lord
[11:54] come and just raise our faith.
[11:57] But we do want to remember this request
[11:59] that brother Larry has put in for his
[12:01] niece. She's down in in Costa Rica and
[12:04] was in involved in an accident. Three
[12:06] lives were lost. So,
[12:09] we're just trusting the Lord will come
[12:10] on the scene in a you know in a foreign
[12:12] country and and things like that.

[12:18] every if you're sick,
[12:20] whatever you're
[12:24] whatever you'd have on your heart, God
[12:26] can meet that. Just hearing yesterday
[12:30] the prophet going through the prayer
[12:31] line and
[12:34] he was praying for a lady, she had heart
[12:35] trouble and he just said, "You, sir,
[12:39] when I said heart trouble that something
[12:40] jumped in you and you're healed, too."
[12:43] Amen. So, we just don't know what's
[12:45] here.
[12:46] Amen. We We could pray for a court case.
[12:48] There may be others and and and it could
[12:51] just be over. Amen. Pray for a sickness
[12:54] and if your faith will rise, you can
[12:56] catch that healing. Amen. God's here to
[12:58] heal.
[13:00] Meet our needs. Brother Dier, if you'd
[13:01] come, just pray over this prayer cloth
[13:04] as well.
[13:18] This morning we find oursel again in
[13:21] your court. Father
[13:23] truly within our hearts we feel oh God
[13:27] this divine worship that comes from what
[13:29] you have done for us. Lord
[13:32] when we survey the great wonders whereby
[13:34] you left the rampard of glory to come
[13:38] and walk that way. Oh God, Abgol got a
[13:41] hill. You walk it alone, but to think
[13:44] that we're on your mind and you
[13:46] considered us, oh God, for the joy that
[13:48] was set before you, Father. You despised
[13:51] that cross. You endured the shame,
[13:53] Father. Oh God, you just went all the
[13:55] way, Father, until the very last drop of
[13:57] blood came out of your vein. And you
[14:00] said it was all finished, oh God. The
[14:03] veil of the temple was rent in twin,
[14:05] father to give us back this access into
[14:08] the holy of holies that we can have, oh
[14:11] God, the right to stand within the
[14:13] shakina glory today. Father, no matter
[14:16] what your condition, dear God, we know
[14:18] that behind the veil, the light of God
[14:21] will continuously shine. We know that in
[14:24] this place, the revival is ongoing.
[14:26] Father, the mana never grows still. Even
[14:29] Aaron Roth'sblooded Father, we believe
[14:32] tonight we're st this morning we're
[14:34] standing in that very same presence.
[14:36] Lord, all things are possible. The
[14:39] supernatural is available. Oh God, that
[14:41] which is impossible, oh God, cannot
[14:44] become possible. For the God of our
[14:46] salvation is alive here this morning.
[14:49] Lord, we're depending upon you. We're
[14:51] inviting you on the scene that you can
[14:53] work a mind of wonder today as you
[14:56] minister to our lives as you touch us,
[14:59] Father, from deep inside our soul.
[15:01] Revelate us, oh God. Quicken us by the
[15:04] Holy Spirit. Let your great,
[15:05] magnificent, holy blessing rest upon
[15:08] each son and daughter of God today.
[15:10] That's the purpose of our coming father
[15:13] with empty hands. For we're not
[15:15] depending, oh God, upon any merit that
[15:17] we have, any good things that we have
[15:19] done. Oh God, our unrighteousness is
[15:22] nothing but filthy rags. But oh God, you
[15:25] have clothed us in your very own
[15:27] unrighteousness that is whiter than
[15:30] snow. God, we believe that we're
[15:32] standing accepted in the beloved. Oh
[15:35] God, Father, we look to you again this
[15:37] morning that you'll just visit us. That
[15:39] you'll take your word, inspire your
[15:42] servant, Father, for you brought us in
[15:44] this hour of this great third exodus to
[15:47] be made ready, oh God, for this change
[15:49] of body. We want to lay aside every
[15:52] weight, every burden. Oh God, everything
[15:55] that is contrary, remove it from among
[15:57] us today. Take away the leaven, Father,
[16:00] that we may be one whole lump together,
[16:02] Father, united in one mind and one
[16:05] accord that are supernatural can indeed
[16:08] move among us. Those that are bound can
[16:11] be set free. Those that are discouraged
[16:14] can be encouraged. Oh God, those that
[16:16] are lost, they can be saved tonight. For
[16:19] we know in your presence, the
[16:20] supernatural is available. And we
[16:23] believe, oh God, as we invite your
[16:25] presence today, just come among us.
[16:28] Bring glory to your great name. For
[16:30] truly there's nothing, oh God, that can
[16:32] satisfy a hungry and thirsty soul today.
[16:36] Rather, the dear pentance after the
[16:38] waterbrook are so long after you. You,
[16:41] the living God. You're the only one,
[16:44] Father, that can meet the longing in our
[16:46] soul. Nothing else will do it today. We
[16:49] confess that we're needy. We confess
[16:51] that we have no one else but you, the
[16:53] living Christ. Do your oh God, your own
[16:57] desire today among us. Just take charge
[17:00] of this meeting. We committed to you,
[17:02] Father. We do not want any hindrance
[17:04] today. No spirit to hold back. Oh God,
[17:07] the move of God among us. Take your
[17:10] perfect liberty and speak to every
[17:12] heart. Anoint your servant. Lord, we
[17:15] thank you for the word that we've heard
[17:17] even on Wednesday. Father, I just oh God
[17:19] warm our hearts that you thinking of us
[17:22] Lord in this great hour of preparation.
[17:24] Oh God, we believe this message that
[17:27] came to us. It came to prepare us oh God
[17:30] and you gave the token, the very Holy
[17:33] Spirit of God for a consolation in this
[17:35] hour. You sent back the pillar of fire
[17:38] to vindicate your word. Father, have
[17:40] your way this morning. Glorify yourself.
[17:43] Dear Jesus, touch our lives. We're
[17:46] longing for more of you and we want to
[17:48] walk out of this meeting knowing that
[17:50] our hearts did not only burn within us,
[17:52] but you came and you spoke to us. You
[17:55] came and you touched us. Oh God, you
[17:57] healed the sick and you touched those
[17:59] that are weak. Today, Father, we commit
[18:02] this meeting to you. Even those that are
[18:04] sending the request for brother Larry,
[18:07] today we unite our heart, Father, that
[18:09] his niece will find you in the midst of
[18:12] our trial. that you are the living God.
[18:14] Dear Jesus and this prayer cloth, we lay
[18:17] our hands upon it. Oh God, not oh God
[18:19] having any worth in ourselves but
[18:22] looking at your word that you have
[18:24] justified us. You have sanctified us. Oh
[18:27] God, you have put your very own spirit
[18:29] within us that we can be your
[18:30] representative in this hour. When it
[18:33] goes and be laid upon the sick, cause
[18:35] them to recover that you can be
[18:37] magnified. That you're the same God that
[18:40] walked the shores of Galilee. You're the
[18:43] same one that was in attendance with
[18:45] that prophet. You're the same one today
[18:47] among us. So we believe, oh God, that
[18:50] you'll do what you desire among us. We
[18:52] give you thanks today. We give you
[18:54] praise and glory and honor, Father. We
[18:57] magnify your great name. We salute your
[19:00] August presence, Lord. We yield
[19:02] ourselves before you in humility and
[19:05] reverence. We come laying our lives down
[19:07] at your feet. Send the fire down.
[19:10] consume our sacrifice. Oh God almighty,
[19:13] just bring glory to your name as you
[19:16] move today. We commit this day to you.
[19:19] The morning service, the evening
[19:21] service. Lord, just have your
[19:23] preeminence. Do what you have purpose to
[19:25] do today. Remove all barrier. Take away
[19:28] every resistance and just break loose
[19:31] among us. Lord, do what you intend to
[19:33] do. Father, we yield oursel today. We
[19:36] surrender. Great God. Oh Jesus, there's
[19:40] no one like you today. We just love you,
[19:43] Father. We love your appearing. We love
[19:46] the fact, oh God, that you thought of
[19:48] us. You thought of us today to gather us
[19:51] in your presence, oh God almighty. Just
[19:55] have your way. Have your way Jesus. We
[19:58] give this service unto you in Jesus
[20:01] name. And for your glory alone, we thank
[20:04] you, Father.
[20:10] can have your seats.
[20:15] Ryan, you can keep playing that if you
[20:16] would. We just have a few announcements
[20:19] as well. Want to remind everyone that
[20:22] there's no service this Wednesday, April
[20:24] the 18th. They're going to be uh doing
[20:27] some maintenance and upgrades on the
[20:29] sound system, I guess. So, that's this
[20:31] coming Wednesday. This week, the 18th,
[20:33] there's no service. So just make sure
[20:35] that you uh take note of that.

[21:22] Amen. We're just happy for them.
[21:25] And I had to think,
[21:28] you know, it's not really a
[21:31] a surprise when something that's that's
[21:33] wonderful, but you think, well, you take
[21:35] two young people that have just given
[21:37] their lives to God, and
[21:39] you know, that's just God. It's not
[21:41] really a surprise or a shock when he
[21:43] just does something like that.
[21:48] We just appreciate that and appreciate
[21:49] them.
[21:52] Let's just sing this one more time. is

[22:12] rejected and alone
[22:15] like a
[22:19] treble on the ground.
[22:24] You took the ball
[22:29] and thought of me
[22:32] [Music]
[22:35] all above all powers.
[22:39] Above all powers.
[22:44] Above all kings.
[22:48] Above all nature
[22:52] and all created,
[22:54] [Music]
[22:58] above all wisdom
[23:01] and all the ways of men.
[23:05] [Music]
[23:08] Oh, you were here before the world
[23:13] began.
[23:16] Above all kingoms,
[23:21] above all,
[23:23] [Music]
[23:26] above all wonderers
[23:29] the world has ever
[23:32] known.
[23:36] of all
[23:39] the treasures of the earth.
[23:44] [Music]

[23:53] [Music]
[24:00] Lay behind the stone.
[24:04] You live, you live to die.
[24:09] Rejected and alone
[24:13] like

[24:21] You took the fall
[24:26] and guarded me.
[24:35] Sister Natasha and brother Jeremy and
[24:37] Sister Liz have a song for us as they'd
[24:39] come sing. There is none like you
[24:47] Jesus.

[25:25] No one else can touch my heart like you
[25:30] do.
[25:31] [Music]
[25:34] I could search for all eternity
[25:37] [Music]
[25:40] and find
[25:42] there is none like you.
[26:07] [Music]
[26:15] Father,
[26:19] it's hard to see it now.
[26:23] You feel you're walking all alone, but
[26:27] he is there.
[26:31] When the storm around you rages
[26:35] and you're tossed to and fro.
[26:39] When you're faced with life's decisions,
[26:44] not sure which way to go. Stand still
[26:51] and let God move.
[26:56] Standing still
[27:00] is hard to do.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; When you feel you have reached the end,
[27:09] he'll make a way for you. Stand still
[27:16] and let God move.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; When the enemy

[27:26] And the walls are
[27:29] [Music]

[27:47] You can rest assured and be secure. God
[27:51] is moving right now.
[27:55] Stand still
[27:59] and let God move.
[28:03] Standing still
[28:07] is hard to do.
[28:12] When you feel you have reached the end,
[28:16] he'll make a way for you. Stand still
[28:24] and let God move.
[28:31] [Music]
[28:36] [Music]
[28:45] &gt;&gt; When you feel you have reached the end,
[28:49] He'll make a way for you. Stand still
[28:57] and let God move.
[29:01] Stand still
[29:05] and let God move.
[29:10] Standing still
[29:13] is hard to do.
[29:18] When you feel you have reached the end,
[29:23] he'll make a way for you. Stand still
[29:30] and let God move.
[29:35] The answer will come,
[29:40] but only in his time.
[29:46] Stand still
[29:50] and let God.
[29:53] [Music]
[29:54] Stand still.
[30:01] [Music]
[30:17] Amen.
[30:19] Not worried about so much about whether
[30:21] God will move, but it's just getting
[30:23] ourselves out of the way.
[30:28] Let's stand as brother Ed comes singing
[30:31] I love you Lord and I lift my voice.
[30:36] Amen. Anxious to hear what the Lord has
[30:38] for us this morning.
[30:40] I love
[30:43] you, Lord,
[30:44] [Music]
[30:47] and I lift my voice
[30:52] [Music]
[30:55] to worship
[30:59] you,
[31:01] oh my soul,
[31:06] rejoice.
[31:11] mighty
[31:16] in what you hear.
[31:22] Let it be a sweet
[31:25] sweet
[31:27] sound
[31:29] in glory.
[31:33] [Music]
[31:36] I love
[31:38] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord.
[31:42] [Music]
[31:43] &gt;&gt; And I lift my voice
[31:50] to worship
[31:54] you,
[31:56] oh my soul,
[32:00] rejoice.
[32:03] Take for my
[32:07] king
[32:10] in what you hear.
[32:16] There be a sweet,
[32:19] sweet
[32:21] sound
[32:23] in your ear.
[32:26] [Music]
[32:27] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord.
[32:30] I

[32:54] [Music]
[32:58] my I
[33:00] [Music]
[33:09] let it be a sweet
[33:12] sweet.
[33:21] [Music]
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Why is it wonderful to be in God's house
[33:27] this morning? Nice to see the
[33:31] church is full.
[33:33] Trust your hearts are full.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; We're waiting for the word. My heart is
[33:39] full.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; We're just looking to the Lord. I
[33:42] enjoyed the song that Sister Natasha and
[33:45] Jeremy and Sister Liz sang.
[33:48] Sometimes it's not easy to do to stand
[33:51] still, but that's so important to do.
[33:56] And uh that that's the that's the
[34:00] scripture that's in the front of the
[34:02] brother Brandham's tabernacle
[34:04] right at the front. Stand still. Know
[34:08] that I'm God.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:12] Well, I think that we'll uh just go to
[34:15] the word. We'll be done our singing.
[34:17] Thanks, brother Ryan. Musicians.
[34:21] Uh
[34:23] I would like to have you remember in
[34:25] special prayer if you would on a
[34:28] continual basis
[34:30] uh there's a a lot of brothers that are
[34:34] applying for visitation visas to come to
[34:37] the convention
[34:39] and uh we had a I have a email from
[34:42] brother Jeremiah in Zimbabwe. He just
[34:45] said things are difficult there but we
[34:48] have sent him the documents and he is a
[34:52] they're applying for visas to come and
[34:54] there's brethren from all different
[34:56] countries and some countries are just
[34:58] much more difficult to get a visa to
[35:01] come and visit here at this time. So if
[35:05] you would pray that pray this prayer
[35:08] that God will make a way and so that
[35:14] Satan cannot restrict or hinder anybody
[35:16] who's supposed to be here.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to pray that
[35:20] everyone who's supposed to be here will
[35:22] be here. And uh and then also I'd like
[35:27] you to just remember in prayer there are
[35:29] things
[35:30] and I don't know exactly how to describe
[35:32] them but there are I would say some of
[35:35] the more major happenings some of the
[35:38] more major events within the realm of
[35:41] the message especially with propagating
[35:43] and getting the message out.
[35:46] Some of the most I was most significant
[35:50] things are not spoken of over the
[35:52] pullpit because
[35:55] you know when brother like brother
[35:56] Brennham said when you say it and it
[35:59] gets out then the devil gets a hold of
[36:02] it and he sure does he gets a hold of
[36:04] it. So we just came to the conclusion
[36:07] quite some time ago. We just won't say
[36:09] anything and then finally you know it
[36:12] seeps out and there it is. Then it
[36:16] happens and uh sometimes the people
[36:18] don't even know how it happened or where
[36:20] it happened and some of the things been
[36:22] working on for two years, three years,
[36:25] four years.
[36:28] Four years. I've personally been working
[36:30] on things for four years that have not
[36:33] really been made known. And uh I'm sure
[36:36] that happens with perhaps a lot of
[36:38] places. I don't know. But that's
[36:39] something that I have found is is almost
[36:42] essential. You just quietly keep working
[36:45] at it and and and God's work just keeps
[36:48] going on. Amen. Hallelujah. I don't
[36:51] know. Well, I do know, but I know that
[36:53] you rejoice. I just don't know if you
[36:56] rejoice as much as I do when I hear how
[36:58] the how the word of God and the message
[37:00] is getting out. And quite frankly, I
[37:02] don't care how it gets out. And I don't
[37:04] care who does it. I'm just Let's get
[37:06] this over with. Amen. Let's go home.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Let's get the last one.
[37:14] I can't understand people say, "You
[37:15] can't do it. I got to do it." Oh, no.
[37:18] You do it. I'll be happy if you do it.
[37:20] You do it. Someone else does it. I don't
[37:22] care who does it. I don't care what
[37:24] preacher does it. I don't care what
[37:25] church does it. Let's just have it done.
[37:28] Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm sure I have
[37:31] your support in that. So, pray about
[37:34] these things earnestly if you would
[37:36] please.
[37:38] Amen.
[37:40] I appreciate your prayers
[37:43] uh for myself and for the services. And
[37:46] tonight, our brother John Andy's is
[37:48] going to be speaking. So, we'll pray for
[37:51] the services today. Let's just look to
[37:53] the Lord before we turn to the word.
[37:56] Father,
[37:58] we've heard the songs and have joined in
[38:01] in the worship. We prayed this morning,
[38:04] oh God, that the worship would be a
[38:07] sweet incense before you that the
[38:10] spirits, our spirits, for your prophet
[38:13] said that each one of us, we have that
[38:15] human spirit. It needs to be quietened.
[38:19] Needs to be brought into subjection of
[38:22] the Holy Ghost. Pray father today that
[38:25] the your divine spirit will take
[38:29] absolute control of every thought of our
[38:33] minds of our hearts and spirits. Oh God,
[38:37] then the word can be delivered, oh God,
[38:40] down that channel to our souls. We will
[38:43] feed. We'll be strengthened. We'll be
[38:46] benefited. The enemy will be defeated.
[38:49] We'll rejoice over his defeat. We'll
[38:52] rejoice over his loss. We'll rejoice, oh
[38:55] God, as we stand victorious. And I pray
[38:58] you'll come and give us an illumination,
[39:01] Lord. Uh give us revelation, I pray. May
[39:05] the lights go on, oh God. May the
[39:07] darkness be banished, I pray, at this
[39:11] time, for it is the rising of the sun.
[39:14] We're so thankful. We glory in what
[39:17] you're doing. Now, illuminate us, Lord,
[39:19] and anoint us, I pray, each one as I
[39:23] speak as the people here. All those that
[39:26] are streaming in that invisible
[39:29] congregation. Oh God, be so present and
[39:33] near them. May it be a sweet fellowship
[39:37] where they are as well. I pray in Jesus
[39:39] Christ's name. Amen.
[39:43] I'm going to read three places out of uh
[39:45] the book of Revelation. And you can turn
[39:48] if you will to the seventh chapter.
[39:54] Uh where we will be reading from the
[39:57] ninth verse. And when you get there, I
[39:59] just want to make a couple of comments
[40:01] before we read.
[40:03] I've been speaking to you on the
[40:05] rapture. Anointed for rapture. I want to
[40:09] speak this morning. Anointed and
[40:11] prepared for rapture.
[40:15] Now, uh, in connection with the
[40:18] anointing, brother Brandham makes this
[40:20] phrase many times and you're all
[40:22] familiar with it. I want you to just
[40:25] really think deep as we go through the
[40:27] service this morning.
[40:29] Everything that God was,
[40:32] everything that was in God rather, God
[40:36] poured into Christ. And everything that
[40:39] was in Christ, he poured into the
[40:42] believer. God above us, God with us, and
[40:45] God in us.
[40:48] This phrase actually capsulizes
[40:52] my entire subject of the of of the
[40:57] anointing.
[40:58] Because the very act of anointing of
[41:01] pouring
[41:03] into that is exactly why the anointing
[41:06] they poured the oil on and that is where
[41:10] that whole concept. So the whole concept
[41:14] that took place on earth starting with
[41:17] Jacob and working all the way through
[41:19] the scripture, Jacob anointing a stone,
[41:22] pouring oil on a stone, God commanding
[41:26] Moses to make oil, make sweet sensing,
[41:30] incense type oil, anoint the priests,
[41:33] pour it onto the high priest. Samuel
[41:36] pouring it onto King David, making him
[41:38] king. And that became the whole concept
[41:41] of the anointing. And then Jesus coming
[41:43] and saying, "The spirit of the Lord hath
[41:46] anointed me." And then he breathed upon
[41:49] the disciples before he left. And then
[41:51] the spirit of God came into the church.
[41:56] You understand? Came into the church.
[41:59] And now the anointing actually is the
[42:03] word of God impregnated
[42:06] with the very creative life of God
[42:08] coming to its desired to its ordained
[42:11] place into the believer and that life is
[42:15] ordained by God to bring about what the
[42:19] promise is for the season
[42:22] &gt;&gt; and that's what the anointing is. So we
[42:24] have received the anointing for the
[42:26] promise for this season. The promise for
[42:29] this season is the rapture and the
[42:31] change of these bodies.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; And we have received that. And so all
[42:36] that God was, he poured into Christ. All
[42:38] that Christ was, he poured into the
[42:39] church. And that is the process.
[42:43] And then there's a scripture
[42:46] in which we won't read, but I'll just I
[42:49] wanted just have your attention. There's
[42:51] a scripture in in Exodus that God
[42:55] commanded Moses. They said, "Thou shalt
[42:57] these garments," he said, "Thou shalt
[42:59] put them upon Aaron thy brother and his
[43:02] sons with him, and thou shalt anoint
[43:05] them
[43:06] and consecrate them and sanctify them."
[43:12] So now we find that the anointing
[43:16] and being consecrated
[43:18] and being sanctified, which is made
[43:21] holy, are all linked together. So I want
[43:24] to extend this this sanctifying
[43:28] of ourselves and making ourselves
[43:30] available to God. And that's really
[43:32] where we are coming to Lord willing this
[43:35] morning. And so if I kind of repeat
[43:36] myself a wee bit, I hope you won't mind.
[43:40] Now reading from Revelation the 9th the
[43:44] 7th chapter verse 9.
[43:47] After this and incidentally just prior
[43:50] from this verse one down through verse 8
[43:54] is the sealing of the 144,000.
[43:57] And then after this I beheld, and lo, a
[44:01] great multitude which no man could
[44:03] number of all nations and kindreds and
[44:07] people and tongues stood before the
[44:10] throne and before the Lamb clothed with
[44:13] white robes and palms in their hands,
[44:16] and cried with a loud voice, saying,
[44:18] Salvation to our God, which siteth upon
[44:21] the throne, and unto the Lamb. And all
[44:24] the angels stood around about the throne
[44:27] and about the elders and the four beasts
[44:29] fell before the throne on their faces
[44:32] and worshiped God, saying, "Amen.
[44:36] Blessing and glory and wisdom and
[44:38] thanksgiving and honor and power and
[44:42] might be unto our God forever and ever.
[44:45] Amen."
[44:46] And one of the elders answered, saying
[44:49] unto me, What are these which are
[44:52] arrayed with white robes? And whence
[44:54] came they? And I said unto them, Sir,
[44:57] thou knowest. See, Brother Brandon makes
[44:59] a point of that. He said, John knew the
[45:01] 12 tribes in their order, in their
[45:04] tribal order. This great vast multitude,
[45:07] he did not know who they were. Thou
[45:10] knowest. And he said unto me, these are
[45:12] they which came out of great tribulation
[45:14] and have washed their robes and made
[45:17] them white in the blood of the lamb.
[45:19] Therefore are they before the throne of
[45:21] God and serve him day and night
[45:24] and in his temple. And he that siteth on
[45:27] the throne shall dwell among them. They
[45:30] shall hunger no more, neither thirst
[45:32] anymore, neither shall the sun light on
[45:34] them, nor any heat. For the lamb which
[45:37] is in the midst of the throne shall feed
[45:40] them and shall lead them unto living
[45:43] fountains of waters and God shall wipe
[45:46] away all tears from their eyes. So now
[45:49] we have the sealed 144,000 group. We
[45:52] have this great number. Brother Brandham
[45:54] says that is the bride. And I would like
[45:56] to read then just in ver in chapter 6
[46:01] uh chapter 6
[46:04] verse 9.
[46:08] And when he had opened the fifth seal, I
[46:11] saw under the altar souls of them, now
[46:14] it's another group, see that were slain
[46:17] uh for the word of God and for the
[46:20] testimony which they held. These were
[46:22] not slain for the testimony of Jesus
[46:25] Christ. They are Jews. They were slain
[46:29] for the testimony of the word of God.
[46:31] The Bible came forth from the Jews. And
[46:35] so that's a distinct group. And uh and
[46:38] verse 10, and they cried with a loud
[46:41] voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy
[46:43] and true, dust thou not judge and avenge
[46:46] our blood on them that dwell on the
[46:49] earth?" And white robes were given unto
[46:52] every one of them. And it was said unto
[46:55] them that they should rest uh yet for a
[46:59] little season until their fellow
[47:01] servants also and their brethren that
[47:04] should be killed as they were should be
[47:07] fulfilled. That souls under the altar.
[47:10] And one last reading. Thanks for
[47:12] remaining standing. Verse uh chapter 20
[47:16] of of Revelation and verse 11
[47:24] And I saw a great white throne, and him
[47:27] that sat on it, from whose face the
[47:31] earth and the heaven fled away, and
[47:34] there was found no place for them. And I
[47:38] saw the dead, small and great, stand
[47:41] before God. And the books were opened,
[47:44] and another book was opened, which is
[47:46] the book of life. And the dead were
[47:49] judged out of those things which are
[47:51] written were written in the books,
[47:53] according to their works. And the sea
[47:56] gave up the dead which were in it. And
[47:58] death and hell delivered up the dead
[48:01] which were in them. And they were judged
[48:04] every man according to their works. And
[48:06] death and hell were cast into the lake
[48:09] of fire. This is the second death. And
[48:12] whosoever
[48:14] was not found written in the book of
[48:16] life was cast into the lake of fire. May
[48:20] God bless his word as we take our seats
[48:35] in these three scripture readings which
[48:37] we have.
[48:42] Every person
[48:43] in this building, every person under my
[48:48] under the sound of my voice,
[48:51] and every man and every woman, every
[48:53] human on earth, these three scriptures
[48:57] encompass them all.
[49:01] And that's a sobering thing. And it's
[49:03] also a glorious thing, but it's a
[49:06] sobering thing. That's why we're here.
[49:09] That's why God sent a messenger. That's
[49:13] why certain scriptures are coming to
[49:16] life. That is why we are to sanctify
[49:22] ourselves to set ourselves aside because
[49:26] we of all peoples are in a very very
[49:32] uh living in a very unique time. Living
[49:35] in a wonderful time and living in a
[49:37] dreadful time. dreadful time for the
[49:39] unbeliever and a glorious time for the
[49:42] believer. But even as believers, we're
[49:44] living in a treacherous time.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; And anyone who can support what I say
[49:50] today, I want you to support it with all
[49:52] your heart and soul.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, grip my heart and grip
[49:56] everyone else's heart." We are living in
[49:59] a glorious time for the believer. And
[50:02] yet it is a treacherous time because
[50:04] Satan has he had he is relentlessly
[50:10] doing everything he can to pressure your
[50:13] life, my life, to affect us, to afflict
[50:17] us, afflict us, to do everything he can
[50:19] to deter us, to detain us. Even though
[50:22] he knows he cannot stop us, but he will
[50:25] do everything he can to do that, to just
[50:28] be a hindrance. That's his nature to be
[50:31] an adversary. That's his nature to be an
[50:34] unbeliever because he's he is an
[50:36] unbeliever. There is no truth in him. So
[50:39] he he will not stop speaking just
[50:41] because there's no truth in him. He will
[50:43] still continue to speak and what he
[50:45] speaks is a lie because Jesus said
[50:47] there's no truth in him. But he will
[50:49] keep speaking in hopes that he can
[50:52] affect your mind and get you to believe
[50:55] something that he's saying. And even if
[50:57] he even if he even if you deny and turn
[50:59] them aside 99% he'll just keep speaking
[51:03] so he can get that 1% there. Got to try
[51:05] to stop these people and hinder this
[51:07] witness and hinder this testimony. And
[51:10] and God on the other hand has given us
[51:13] has given us I believe more than
[51:15] adequate
[51:17] uh strength and enlightenment. So these
[51:21] scriptures that we read this morning, I
[51:23] want everyone to really seriously
[51:26] understand it's not just Brother Biscll
[51:27] speaking. This is your future.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; We're reading about your future. And
[51:34] there's no one here that wants to be so
[51:38] ignorant so as to think that God somehow
[51:43] missed you.
[51:45] We all are here in one of these
[51:47] scriptures. We're not going to be. We're
[51:50] not the souls under the altar.
[51:54] We're not that group.
[51:56] We are called. And the reason why you're
[51:59] here, I trust, is that you have been
[52:02] called by a message. I young people, I
[52:06] wouldn't want you to feel, well, I'm
[52:08] here because I'm forced to be here. I
[52:10] I'm there's an imposition on me to be
[52:13] here. I'm really not interested to be
[52:15] here. If if that is your thought this
[52:17] morning, I would just say, where do you
[52:19] put yourself in these scriptures?
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Because I'm talking about your future.
[52:24] If there'd be someone here that has
[52:27] something that has God has been dealing
[52:29] with and dealing with and dealing with
[52:31] and dealing with and you've kind of
[52:33] become accustomed to having something
[52:35] that you know is displeasing to God, I
[52:37] would I I'm not going to tell you where
[52:39] we are, but I would say you are in these
[52:41] scriptures and so you need to place
[52:43] yourself in those scriptures. But if you
[52:45] say on the other hand, I am I I I I I am
[52:50] the object of the of the love and grace
[52:53] of God that has come to me when I was in
[52:55] such darkness, when I was in such
[52:57] confusion, when I was uh uh didn't even
[53:01] have a desire for it. And God came my
[53:03] way and gripped my soul. And I found
[53:06] these things glorious. I I've moved
[53:08] along and I've had my difficulties, had
[53:10] my troubles, but we've kept going on.
[53:13] And this is my ambition. This is my
[53:15] desire. And I'm consumed by it. And if
[53:18] God speaks to me, to dedicate myself,
[53:20] rededicate myself, consecrate myself,
[53:23] I'm here to be washed by the water of
[53:25] the word. I'm here. Then then you're in
[53:28] another group because God even put that
[53:30] within you. And so the word is being
[53:34] sent to us that we might uh be
[53:37] strengthened, edified, built up, and
[53:40] that the enemy will certainly be
[53:41] defeated. So this scripture and the
[53:45] message this morning encompasses your
[53:47] future.
[53:50] This life is the only time you have to
[53:54] do what you're going to do with regards
[53:57] to your eternal future.
[54:00] We are not having a second chance. We're
[54:03] not going to be improving things after
[54:06] we die. There's no special place.
[54:10] Whatever you're going to do with regards
[54:12] to your future, you're going to do it
[54:14] now.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; You want to establish that. And and so
[54:18] many of us, we're making preparations.
[54:20] We've got to prepare. We go to school.
[54:22] We get further education. We study. We
[54:25] train. We have families. And we have
[54:28] futures to think about. And we always
[54:30] talk planning for the future. Planning
[54:32] for the future. But if we plan for all
[54:35] the future with our thoughts in mind
[54:37] that it's somewhere here on this earth,
[54:39] we're really missing the whole purpose.
[54:42] Our future is on the other side.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; And we're all going to end there.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Every single one of us going to end
[54:49] there in in one of these groups that's
[54:51] described in the scripture. You're going
[54:53] to be there. Regardless of what you
[54:56] think of of of of this church or of any
[54:59] other religion or whatever more, we are
[55:02] going to be there. And if I were you,
[55:05] and this is my solemn counsel and advice
[55:08] to every person under the sound of my
[55:10] voice, I believe that our future, which
[55:13] the scripture speaks about on the other
[55:15] side, should be the centerpiece of our
[55:18] lives. It ought to consume our thoughts.
[55:22] We ought to be having it in the morning
[55:26] &gt;&gt; and in small things.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; I was I just took a little break and I
[55:34] thought, well, you know, they deliver
[55:37] several local little newspaper rags to
[55:40] my door and I don't even know how to get
[55:41] rid of them. and they just, you know,
[55:43] they drop those local little newspapers
[55:46] for the community out in front of front
[55:48] of our door and we pick them up. And so
[55:50] I was consumed and my thoughts were so
[55:52] engrossed with the message and and after
[55:55] a number of hours, you just need to
[55:57] break away. And I thought, well, I just
[55:59] sit down and I I looked at that that
[56:02] paper that was there and and I just
[56:04] said, now would I be moving towards
[56:08] sanctification
[56:09] by reading that or would I be better off
[56:12] without it? And I just decided I'd be
[56:14] better off without it.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in that paper that's
[56:17] going to sanctify me. going to tell me
[56:19] what the local stuff is and some little
[56:22] society and and and what development is
[56:24] happening here and uh who's who's
[56:27] complaining and the editorial and all
[56:29] the rest of it. It's just a little local
[56:30] harmless rag, but I just decided it had
[56:33] no contribution to my sanctification and
[56:37] had zero contribution to my message this
[56:39] morning. I said, "Let the thing stay
[56:41] there.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Chuck it in the garbage probably as fast
[56:44] as we can." Not because there's anything
[56:46] evil with it, but it just doesn't have
[56:49] any contribution to a sanctified life.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[56:55] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we know we're on the
[56:56] right track.
[56:59] In the text,
[57:02] Apostle Paul, Apostle, I'm sorry,
[57:04] Apostle uh John said, "After this, I
[57:07] beheld and lo a great uh multitude which
[57:11] no man could number of all nations
[57:16] and kindreds
[57:18] and people and tongues." Some might say
[57:22] this was a great ecumenical
[57:24] gathering, but I would like to say,
[57:26] well, it was a great multicultural
[57:28] gathering.
[57:31] North America, United States, Canada,
[57:35] they
[57:37] I won't say they pride themselves, but
[57:39] yet I think it's a terminology that you
[57:41] understand. They do pride themselves.
[57:45] like to think of themselves. I think
[57:47] both nations like to think of themselves
[57:50] as being compassionate nations. When
[57:53] there's trouble in the world, they want
[57:56] to extend themselves. If there's
[57:59] poverty, extreme poverty in the world,
[58:01] they want to extend themselves and be
[58:04] compassionate.
[58:06] And of of all countries, I think that we
[58:10] can say that they have become identified
[58:13] as melting pots for all tongues and
[58:18] kindreds and of of people and tribes and
[58:23] languages. And I was thinking of this, I
[58:26] thought in connection with the church
[58:29] that is right here, we have probably
[58:32] somewhere between 30 and 40
[58:36] actual nationalities. These aren't just
[58:38] from way way back your where your roots
[58:40] came from. These are people that have
[58:42] come from different countries and
[58:44] different nations in the world. And each
[58:48] one having their own culture,
[58:53] having their own upbringing, and then
[58:56] yet coming and we gather into one nation
[59:00] or two nations as we're represented
[59:02] here. And uh and then the nation itself
[59:07] whether it be Canada, United States, the
[59:09] nation itself begins to develop its own
[59:14] uh unique kind of culture which is a
[59:18] fusion or a blending of all of the
[59:20] cultures that have come and then it
[59:23] develops into a unique culture of its
[59:25] own.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[59:29] uh and and so you end up having uh some
[59:34] nations I mean you know that's largely
[59:37] uh they are as their name implies and
[59:42] that is their country when you say
[59:44] United States of America but I mean
[59:47] there are large vast numbers of people
[59:50] be they Hispanics or be they from
[59:53] African and whether they be from Europe
[59:56] or whatever more but it just becomes a
[59:59] huge melting pot and that in itself
[1:00:03] because the nation opened their doors,
[1:00:05] opened the open their arms as as Canada
[1:00:09] prides themselves in that too. Well,
[1:00:11] there's trouble in a there's trouble in
[1:00:13] a certain place. People are dying.
[1:00:15] People are starving. People are under
[1:00:17] the threat of a cruel a cruel dictator.
[1:00:20] So they open their arms and and take so
[1:00:23] many from be it the Soviet Union or be
[1:00:26] it from Africa or be it from whatever
[1:00:28] part of the world. Open their arms and
[1:00:30] and receive them into their nation and
[1:00:34] then that within itself develops into a
[1:00:37] very unique uh a unique type of culture
[1:00:42] of its own. You said where are you going
[1:00:45] brother Biscol?
[1:00:47] Well, many of you that are right here
[1:00:51] are here because the countries opened up
[1:00:55] and made a way for you to come.
[1:01:00] And so we can say that the nations, they
[1:01:02] like to think of themselves as being
[1:01:04] compassionate.
[1:01:06] Well, I've read of a group here.
[1:01:10] I read of a group and I beheld a great
[1:01:14] multitude.
[1:01:17] which no man could number.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; And there were all nations
[1:01:23] and all kindreds
[1:01:26] and the people and tongues and they
[1:01:30] stood before the throne and the lamb.
[1:01:32] You talk about a multicultural
[1:01:33] gathering.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; That is a multicultural gathering. And
[1:01:41] those that Apostle John saw got there
[1:01:46] because
[1:01:48] someone was compassionate.
[1:01:51] Someone said, "These people are in the
[1:01:54] shadows, living in the shadows of death.
[1:01:57] These people are living. They're
[1:02:00] starving.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; They have no spiritual food whatsoever.
[1:02:05] These people are in dire straits
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; and something has to be done.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; And first we'll make a way. We'll open
[1:02:15] up the doors. We'll send out
[1:02:18] ambassadors. We'll proclaim the
[1:02:21] deliverance and the gospel of Jesus
[1:02:23] Christ and we'll let them come in.
[1:02:27] Hallelujah. And it made a unique group
[1:02:30] of people. They're called the
[1:02:31] bloodbought.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're called the bride of
[1:02:35] Jesus Christ. They're called the body of
[1:02:39] Jesus Christ. And they're one body.
[1:02:41] They're one bread. But they come from
[1:02:43] many places, many tongues, many peoples,
[1:02:46] many kindreds, many tribes, many
[1:02:49] nations, but they're one.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Isn't it a glorious body?
[1:02:56] and how they how they got there, how
[1:03:00] they came to be in this in this vast
[1:03:03] multitude.
[1:03:06] And so I say to this this church
[1:03:12] I believe this church
[1:03:17] is unique
[1:03:19] not because of you, not because of me,
[1:03:21] not because of but because of him.
[1:03:26] And I trust that you're here because you
[1:03:28] feel God led me here. And if God led me
[1:03:32] here and God led you here and God led us
[1:03:35] to be here together such as we are, then
[1:03:38] we also need to say, "What do you have
[1:03:40] me here for?" And I can tell you it's
[1:03:43] for an eternal purpose.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's for an eternal purpose.
[1:03:47] It's for a witness. It's that the whole
[1:03:49] congregation, you as an individual are a
[1:03:52] witness, but we as a body of people are
[1:03:54] a witness. We're here to be a stable
[1:03:57] witness. We're here to be able to
[1:04:00] declare that the unity of the body of
[1:04:03] Jesus Christ is more blessed. The unity
[1:04:06] I was thinking on, I want to preach on
[1:04:08] what is the value of unity. Unity is
[1:04:11] worth more than my feelings.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Unity is worth more than the chip that's
[1:04:16] on anybody's shoulder. Unity is worth
[1:04:18] more than my ideas. Unity is worth more.
[1:04:22] Unity is is without without value. We
[1:04:26] can't put a value on it. Unity is so
[1:04:28] precious.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is why the
[1:04:32] scripture says you strive for the unity.
[1:04:34] And God has given us wonderful unity. I
[1:04:37] got thinking many times how many years
[1:04:40] that people have sat in this
[1:04:41] congregation and it's just like a decree
[1:04:44] that God has given even though Satan has
[1:04:46] tried to attack it from so many
[1:04:48] different direction we've been able to
[1:04:50] go year after year 5 years and 10 years
[1:04:55] and 20 years and go year after year and
[1:04:58] just have a be gripped with the peace of
[1:05:00] God and the stability and the enemy
[1:05:03] fights and sends his arrows and sends
[1:05:05] his targets and tries to do tries to
[1:05:07] take people down and it's as though God
[1:05:10] says you're not going to do it. I put a
[1:05:12] wall of fire about them. Hallelujah. We
[1:05:14] need to maintain that. Not so we can
[1:05:17] have a happy time. Maintain it for our
[1:05:19] testimony. Maintain it for the witness
[1:05:22] of Jesus Christ.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; It's a rarity.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; It's a rarity and you need to treasure
[1:05:30] it. You need to treasure it. You need to
[1:05:32] protect it and say regardless of what
[1:05:35] comes, I won't allow anything to divide
[1:05:38] me from my brother, my sister. It is too
[1:05:41] precious. I won't allow Satan to do it.
[1:05:44] I won't allow any devil to do it. I
[1:05:46] won't allow any instrument of Satan to
[1:05:48] do it. I'm protecting it because God has
[1:05:51] given it to us and it's a great
[1:05:52] treasure.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:01] Now
[1:06:04] in the future home
[1:06:08] in the rapture message rather brother
[1:06:10] Brandham says now we've had three
[1:06:12] raptures
[1:06:15] three raptures in the Old Testament as a
[1:06:17] witness. Enoch was one. Elijah was the
[1:06:22] other one and Jesus was the other one.
[1:06:27] Jesus being the keystone.
[1:06:30] Now, he was the keystone of the three.
[1:06:34] Says, "We all know that Enoch was
[1:06:35] translated. We know that Elijah was
[1:06:38] taken up in a whirlwind in a chariot of
[1:06:41] fire and Jesus died, buried, rose up,
[1:06:47] and lived here on earth, and then was
[1:06:49] raptured up." The keystone, there's
[1:06:53] three that bear record. Now those are
[1:06:57] the three I wanted today to take those
[1:07:00] three and in preparation for the rapture
[1:07:04] I was going to look at each one of these
[1:07:07] three which are a witness to our
[1:07:10] rapture.
[1:07:11] It happened to them, each one, Enoch,
[1:07:15] Elijah, and Jesus, so that it would be a
[1:07:18] witness to us, that this rapture is a
[1:07:21] reality and how what they did and how
[1:07:25] they prepared themselves or how God
[1:07:27] prepared them for it. I thought it would
[1:07:29] be good to look at, but I can cannot do
[1:07:32] that today because I feel led in a
[1:07:34] different direction. He said, "Now there
[1:07:36] has been
[1:07:38] one rapture already passed in the New
[1:07:40] Testament." And that's Matthew 27,
[1:07:44] chapter uh 27th chapter and the 45th
[1:07:47] verse. And it says this, "And the graves
[1:07:50] were opened. And many of the bodies of
[1:07:53] the saints that slept arose and came out
[1:07:56] of the graves after his resurrection,
[1:07:59] and went into the holy city, and
[1:08:01] appeared unto many." He said one rapture
[1:08:04] is passed and the second rapture will be
[1:08:08] the catching away of the bride and the
[1:08:11] third one is the two witnesses in
[1:08:14] Revelation 11 11 and 12 and their dead
[1:08:18] bodies laid in the streets. The two
[1:08:20] witnesses go to Israel. Their dead
[1:08:23] bodies are in the streets for three and
[1:08:24] a half days and then the spirit of life
[1:08:27] comes into them and they are raptured.
[1:08:30] are taken up into heaven. And and there
[1:08:33] are your three raptures of the New
[1:08:35] Testament. Three raptures of the Old
[1:08:38] Testament, three raptures in the New
[1:08:40] Testament. He said, "Now we're ready
[1:08:44] waiting for the rapture of the saints.
[1:08:47] And now you have an Elijah vindicated
[1:08:51] messenger." Now you say, "Well, we
[1:08:54] believe in it." And the saints have
[1:08:55] believed in it for all of these
[1:08:57] centuries. But now we have never, the
[1:08:59] earth has never had sent to it this kind
[1:09:02] of a sign, the sign of the Messiah, the
[1:09:06] sign of the resurrection. He said it.
[1:09:09] And now he he says these words, "And now
[1:09:13] we're waiting for the rapture of the
[1:09:15] saints. It's been spoken and so shall it
[1:09:20] be."
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; You know, we don't have to go any
[1:09:22] further.
[1:09:23] It's been spoken and so shall it be.
[1:09:29] The thing that must consume us is that I
[1:09:32] want to now prepare myself,
[1:09:35] sanctify myself, do everything I can to
[1:09:39] make myself available to how God is
[1:09:43] dealing, how God is speaking, how God is
[1:09:46] leading us as a group of people and how
[1:09:48] he speaks to us individually that I will
[1:09:51] be prepared for that great moment.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; We might say, well, we can do nothing
[1:09:56] ourselves. No, we cannot do anything
[1:09:58] ourselves as far as works
[1:10:01] for attaining it because it's God in his
[1:10:04] grace that gives it to us. But there are
[1:10:07] things that we do. Uh otherwise the
[1:10:09] scripture which I said on on Wednesday
[1:10:12] that they the the
[1:10:15] scripture said that they turn their
[1:10:17] heart turn their heart towards God. See
[1:10:21] and that is something that we do on a
[1:10:22] daily basis but I won't get into that
[1:10:24] right now. Then in the Sardisian church
[1:10:28] age,
[1:10:30] but the rapture, he said the rapture is
[1:10:32] not the only roll call.
[1:10:36] There are there at the second there at
[1:10:39] the second resurrection at the great
[1:10:41] white throne judgment will names be
[1:10:44] confessed. Now these are some that are
[1:10:46] not going in the rapture. They're come
[1:10:49] up before the great white throne
[1:10:51] judgment. But even here what he says
[1:10:53] about the white throne judgment. He
[1:10:56] says, "Names will be confessed before
[1:10:58] the father and his angels." He says,
[1:11:01] "Now I've been told by those who know
[1:11:04] that the sweetest sound to the human ear
[1:11:07] is the sound of a person's name." He
[1:11:11] said, "But no earthly voice will ever
[1:11:14] sound your name as sweetly as will the
[1:11:18] voice of God if your name is in the book
[1:11:20] of life." and remains there to be
[1:11:23] revealed before the holy angels. What a
[1:11:27] day that will be when we hear Jesus say,
[1:11:31] "Father, they confessed me, confessed my
[1:11:35] name before men in the days of their
[1:11:38] earthly pilgrimage. Now I will confess
[1:11:42] their names before thee and all the holy
[1:11:45] angels."
[1:11:47] I tell you friends, if we only got that
[1:11:50] this morning and went home and said,
[1:11:52] "That will be the criteria for my life."
[1:11:55] When I wake up in the morning, that'll
[1:11:57] be the criteria. I want to hear that
[1:11:59] voice. I want to hear my name called
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; before the angels, holy angels.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; I want to bring it to holiness as well,
[1:12:12] but I can't do it just now. But brother
[1:12:15] Brandham says that God is so holy that
[1:12:17] the angels look dirty.
[1:12:22] That's holy.
[1:12:24] That is holy. The anointing
[1:12:28] sanctifying the people,
[1:12:32] consecrating them is part of the
[1:12:35] process. God, he cannot diminish in his
[1:12:38] holiness. He cannot diminish in his
[1:12:41] sacred presence. He can't. But what God
[1:12:45] does is he his grace is magnified by
[1:12:49] taking the likes of us and bringing us
[1:12:52] through the process of cleansing until
[1:12:55] we are acceptable in his presence. That
[1:12:59] to me is the most glorious thing that a
[1:13:01] God that's so holy, a God that's so
[1:13:04] righteous, a God that's so
[1:13:07] unapproachable is a God that can stoop
[1:13:10] down and make a way for the likes of you
[1:13:12] and I to come into his presence and call
[1:13:16] us holy, a holy people. You're a holy
[1:13:19] generation. How wonderful that is. But
[1:13:23] we never want to lose sight of the
[1:13:24] holiness of God. We never want to lose
[1:13:27] sight of that so that we would become
[1:13:30] careless. And this world is is
[1:13:33] determined to make us
[1:13:36] dull concerning God's things, occupied,
[1:13:39] busy, consumed. And that's why this
[1:13:42] dangerous. It's not there's nothing
[1:13:43] wrong with being busy. We're all busy.
[1:13:46] But we don't want our busyiness. We
[1:13:48] don't want the things that occupy our
[1:13:50] lives to make our to to so consume us
[1:13:53] and and snare us and trap us. so that
[1:13:56] our thoughts are consumed with a place
[1:13:59] that we're not going to spend here very
[1:14:00] long.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; We're going to go out of here very soon.
[1:14:03] Friends, I'm talking about being ready
[1:14:05] for a place where you're going to live
[1:14:07] for eternity.
[1:14:17] In these scriptures we read this
[1:14:18] morning, the plan of redemption
[1:14:22] has been completed.
[1:14:25] The plan that was in the mind of God
[1:14:29] has been completed and we're into
[1:14:32] another civilization.
[1:14:34] This civilization, as you know, and I
[1:14:37] need to really be as emphatic as
[1:14:40] possible, this civilization is of Satan.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Every government is of Satan.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't want to hear me say that,
[1:14:51] but that is the truth. And as I was in
[1:14:54] Ottawa and that's a s the seat of
[1:14:57] government for our country and I said to
[1:15:00] the people you know just down the street
[1:15:04] just over here in our parliament
[1:15:07] the party that's in now it has a certain
[1:15:10] voice and they may institute good things
[1:15:14] and whatever more. We have nothing to
[1:15:16] say about that. We're not into politics.
[1:15:18] But then soon as maybe that government
[1:15:21] moves out or that administration becomes
[1:15:23] defeated, another president or another
[1:15:25] prime minister comes in, they'll have
[1:15:27] another voice. They'll set aside some of
[1:15:29] the things that the last government had
[1:15:31] and they'll institute new things and
[1:15:33] it'll be another voice. We're going in
[1:15:35] another direction. We're Republican.
[1:15:37] We're liberal. We're Democrat. We're
[1:15:40] conservative. We're this. We're that or
[1:15:41] the other thing. And they'll have a
[1:15:43] different voice. But I was saying to the
[1:15:45] people in Ottawa, this church has one
[1:15:48] voice. Although although we are here
[1:15:51] today multicultural, this church has one
[1:15:55] voice. And it doesn't change with one
[1:15:58] administration to another. We're under
[1:16:00] the administration of the son of man.
[1:16:02] We're under the administration of our
[1:16:04] husband, the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:16:07] we'll have one voice today. It'll be the
[1:16:09] same tomorrow, this year, and next year.
[1:16:12] And it'll be the same when we're carried
[1:16:14] away into a rapture time.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; But in the
[1:16:23] in the message, things that are to be,
[1:16:26] he said, I want to prove to you that
[1:16:27] education and science,
[1:16:30] civilization, all of these things, I'd
[1:16:33] like you to notice, please, this phrase.
[1:16:36] I take what the prophet of God says with
[1:16:38] great seriousness. I digest the very
[1:16:42] phrasing.
[1:16:45] I want to prove to you education and
[1:16:47] science and civilization
[1:16:49] and all of these things that we
[1:16:53] seemingly so enjoy today. I'm glad he
[1:16:57] put that seemingly
[1:16:59] that we seemingly so enjoy
[1:17:04] is of Satan and will perish.
[1:17:08] I seemingly enjoy my car
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; and I seemingly enjoy the fact that you
[1:17:16] all have cars and able to get here
[1:17:18] today.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; I I seemingly enjoy that we have a
[1:17:24] comfortable place with an atmosphere
[1:17:26] that we're not shivering too cold and
[1:17:28] we're not, you know, too hot in here and
[1:17:31] we've kind of got things balanced out. I
[1:17:34] seemingly enjoy that the sound system,
[1:17:36] you know, works and so on and you're
[1:17:38] able to hear it and all that, but I
[1:17:40] can't say that I enjoy it because I know
[1:17:43] there's a better
[1:17:45] there's a better place to worship and
[1:17:47] there's a better way to travel.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; You want a Ford or a Chrysler or do you
[1:17:54] want to travel like a thought?
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "Oh, I can't even
[1:17:59] imagine that." Well, few years ago, they
[1:18:01] couldn't even imagine a man going up in
[1:18:03] a
[1:18:05] up in space. They couldn't even imagine.
[1:18:07] It was just out of their thoughts, out
[1:18:08] of their mind. Can you imagine people
[1:18:10] actually going up on on things that are
[1:18:13] are literally volatile rockets and being
[1:18:16] thrust up into space? Why? We couldn't
[1:18:18] have thought of that. I mean, even as a
[1:18:20] kid, you'd have thought that was insane.
[1:18:28] I used to say when I was a boy, I was a
[1:18:30] little tikeke. You know how the how the
[1:18:32] kids come up with phrases? See, they
[1:18:35] have little sayings. And when I was a
[1:18:37] kid,
[1:18:39] they'd say, "Go like 60." And my dad had
[1:18:43] thunk me right on the head. Edward,
[1:18:45] don't say that. You know, nobody can go
[1:18:47] 60.
[1:18:52] That's in my lifetime. I got thunked on
[1:18:54] the head many times. Don't say that. You
[1:18:57] know, nobody can go 60.
[1:18:59] That's always brought up.
[1:19:03] 60.
[1:19:04] They're saying 0 to 60 in how many
[1:19:06] seconds?
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Things have changed.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; But is it better? No, it's not better.
[1:19:12] They're racing down the streets killing
[1:19:14] people. And they the whole country gets
[1:19:16] up in arms because maybe one person gets
[1:19:18] killed and and the and the booze and all
[1:19:20] the liquor and all the rest of it kills
[1:19:22] more. And they kill even in the wars,
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; but they don't do a thing about it.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; This civilization is of the devil.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; And there's another civilization.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; And he says, he says, "So there will be
[1:19:33] a civilization in the world that we're
[1:19:35] going to." Are you going there?
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; That we're going to.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Are you going there?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; You ought to be enthused about it.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Are we going there? There's a
[1:19:51] civilization that we're going to, but it
[1:19:54] won't be this kindness of civilization.
[1:19:56] For in this civilization, we have
[1:19:58] sickness. We do. And if you're sick here
[1:20:00] today, the civilization we're going to
[1:20:03] doesn't have it. In fact, is there's a
[1:20:05] power there's a power that has come to
[1:20:08] us from that civilization that tells us
[1:20:10] we can defeat that sickness in this
[1:20:13] civilization.
[1:20:16] There's sorrow, there's lust, there's
[1:20:18] death. Everything in this civilization's
[1:20:20] wrong. But in the civilization that
[1:20:23] there will be there'll be none of these
[1:20:26] things.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; At one time all of these things were a
[1:20:31] great mystery secret in the mind of God.
[1:20:34] But now it's been completed.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; And God begin to bring forth his
[1:20:39] thought. And now I just want to rehearse
[1:20:42] and summarize. God begin to bring forth
[1:20:45] his thought.
[1:20:47] God help me now.
[1:20:52] You followed me all right thus far?
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to think I'm too far
[1:20:56] way off on left field someplace. But God
[1:21:00] began to bring his thought now. Now I I
[1:21:02] I want to just take how brother Brandham
[1:21:06] says we take this little picture and I
[1:21:08] need to go back to it and this great
[1:21:11] eternal being little light like spun off
[1:21:15] of it. He said that was the logos.
[1:21:18] Another place he says that was the
[1:21:21] anointed word.
[1:21:23] Another place he says that was the son.
[1:21:25] The son, not the s u n but the s o n.
[1:21:30] That was the son. That's why John one
[1:21:32] can say in the beginning was the word
[1:21:35] and the word was with god and the word
[1:21:38] was god and all things were made by him.
[1:21:42] Because that and that's why Jesus when
[1:21:43] he came he says I proceeded from the
[1:21:45] father I proceeded I came out from the
[1:21:48] father now we have a prophet telling us
[1:21:50] how that happened in this great being
[1:21:53] eternal being that no one could
[1:21:54] understand no one could grasp out from
[1:21:57] at some place in the great vast
[1:21:59] eternities God
[1:22:02] was going to begin his creative and and
[1:22:04] out from him came that little white
[1:22:07] light the logos the word the anointed
[1:22:10] word and it's coming out. It's it's the
[1:22:13] son. It's the son of God. It's the
[1:22:16] attribute coming out from God that's
[1:22:18] going to create and God began to create
[1:22:22] all of these things. And then
[1:22:25] the fall,
[1:22:27] the transgression,
[1:22:29] and still even in that mind of God and
[1:22:32] that logos which he sent out was also
[1:22:34] the full redemption. Not only was he
[1:22:37] going to create and he knew it would
[1:22:40] fall, but within that within that very
[1:22:43] attribute he sent out was also the
[1:22:45] strength and the power for full
[1:22:46] redemption to bring it all back.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful?
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; You're following that real close now.
[1:22:53] And so the fall comes and God comes to
[1:22:56] an Abraham and gives him a promise to
[1:22:58] him and his seed. And and it's always a
[1:23:00] promise. It's the word because it's the
[1:23:01] logos which came out from God. And now
[1:23:04] he's he's actually going to create he's
[1:23:06] going to build a masterpiece. Oh my, you
[1:23:09] have to help me. I got so much I I've
[1:23:11] got to try to get it all said here in a
[1:23:13] little while. And then comes an Isaac
[1:23:16] and then a Jacob. There's the three
[1:23:18] corners. Joseph is going to come.
[1:23:19] Joseph's perfection. But Jacob, he's
[1:23:21] he's a shyster and he's actually running
[1:23:23] from his he's running from his uh from
[1:23:26] his brother. And he lays down.
[1:23:29] And when he lays down, he takes a stone
[1:23:31] for a pillow and and he has a dream and
[1:23:35] he dreams. And in his dream, the
[1:23:38] ladder's on earth and it goes into
[1:23:41] heaven.
[1:23:43] And he sees angels descending and
[1:23:45] ascending, messengers coming down and
[1:23:49] going up. And he awakens. And he says,
[1:23:53] "This is none other than the gate of
[1:23:55] heaven. This is the house of God. Now,
[1:24:00] this has gone through his mind because
[1:24:03] he's dreamed it. It's in his mind. What
[1:24:06] God is doing, God is actually
[1:24:10] causing him, not forcing him, but
[1:24:12] causing him to do something because he's
[1:24:16] going to express what was actually in
[1:24:20] the mind of God. It came out of the mind
[1:24:22] of God. And and what was coming out of
[1:24:25] the mind of God is that he was pouring
[1:24:28] out of himself which needed to be
[1:24:31] identified on earth as a pouring as an
[1:24:34] anointing. So Jacob gets up and he takes
[1:24:37] the stone that his head was on. He
[1:24:39] thought I I've had an experience. This
[1:24:42] has gone through my mind. This is
[1:24:44] something that I must not forget. This
[1:24:47] is a special place. This is the gate of
[1:24:49] heaven. I'm going to come back to this
[1:24:51] place. I'm going to remember this place.
[1:24:54] This is the This is the house of God.
[1:24:56] I'll call it Bethl.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; What'll I do to identify this place?
[1:25:02] I'll take this stone that my head was on
[1:25:05] when all of this went up and I'll pour
[1:25:07] oil upon it. And that was the first
[1:25:09] instance of anointing because God was
[1:25:11] giving an act on earth which actually
[1:25:14] was out from his own sort, his own bosom
[1:25:17] because God was pouring out
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; onto the earth. of his own self.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; And so he pours it out. Then as I said
[1:25:26] earlier, then then it moved on to Moses
[1:25:29] making the oil for the anointing. Then
[1:25:32] further anoint the priests. Anoint them
[1:25:35] because there's going to be a priesthood
[1:25:37] that will be anointed someday. And
[1:25:39] that's why the scripture says you're a
[1:25:41] you're a holy priesthood.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're an anointed
[1:25:44] priesthood.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; You follow me? And then you'll take the
[1:25:48] high priest and now you'll anoint him
[1:25:50] because Aaron the the Aaronic priesthood
[1:25:54] would end and the Melzdc priesthood
[1:25:56] which was the Lord Jesus Christ would
[1:25:58] come and that's why he comes in Luke the
[1:26:00] 4th chapter starts right out he says
[1:26:03] this he just coming of age the first
[1:26:07] thing he does comes into the synagogue
[1:26:09] as was his custom watch in the synagogue
[1:26:12] if you ever been in a synagogue they
[1:26:14] have a table over here and the scrolls
[1:26:16] are brought out the Torah brought out
[1:26:18] and rolled out and and and the one who
[1:26:22] stands to read. That's what the bar
[1:26:24] mitzvah is all about. When a young
[1:26:26] Jewish boy comes to age, when he's going
[1:26:28] to be able to come and take and read the
[1:26:31] scroll and so Jesus now, a young man, he
[1:26:35] comes and stands at the table and the
[1:26:37] Bible says the priest brought to him as
[1:26:40] it was in birth pains. He couldn't find
[1:26:42] it in his new Bible. And the priest
[1:26:44] brought to him the word and he's looking
[1:26:46] for a scripture. Brother Brandham's
[1:26:48] looking for a certain scripture wanting
[1:26:50] to preach birth painans. He can't find
[1:26:52] the scripture. And then the priest
[1:26:54] brought him the book and he found the
[1:26:56] scripture where it is to read. And the
[1:26:58] next time he reads this day is the
[1:27:00] scripture fulfilled in your ears because
[1:27:02] now it's unveiling to him what's
[1:27:04] happening. And Jesus came. They brought
[1:27:06] the scroll to him. And the Bible is very
[1:27:09] specific. Says, "And he found the place
[1:27:12] where it was written that the Lord hath
[1:27:16] anointed me. The spirit I'm anointed.
[1:27:19] The spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:27:22] because he hath anointed me." And he
[1:27:25] begins to identify what he's been
[1:27:26] anointed. In other words, it's been
[1:27:28] poured into me and I'm pouring it out
[1:27:31] now. I'm anointed to deliver the
[1:27:33] captive. I'm anointed to heal the sick.
[1:27:36] I'm anointed to loose the prisoner out
[1:27:39] of his prison. Hallelujah.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; And then as he comes to the end of his
[1:27:44] short ministry, he breathes upon the
[1:27:47] disciples to signify that the very
[1:27:49] breath of God will not only be breathed
[1:27:52] onto them, but will breathe into them.
[1:27:54] And you go and tarry until the Holy
[1:27:56] Spirit. And when the spirit of God came,
[1:27:58] it was the very spirit of the creator,
[1:28:00] the spirit that was in Jesus Christ came
[1:28:03] into the believer. And that is why the
[1:28:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost is such a
[1:28:08] significant and important part because
[1:28:10] that is the new birth.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; That's the plan.
[1:28:26] the plan of redemption.
[1:28:31] Now, brother Brandham says in uncertain
[1:28:34] sound
[1:28:36] it there's a phrase which we all have
[1:28:38] heard. There's two things that are
[1:28:41] certain. Death in taxes.
[1:28:46] You've heard it.
[1:28:48] And he says, "Oh no,
[1:28:51] taxes
[1:28:52] isn't too certain. the Lord may come.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Not many here pay taxes.
[1:29:01] You'd be rejoicing.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; I said taxes aren't too certain.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; The Lord may come.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Sounds better. He says they can charge
[1:29:12] it off then
[1:29:14] all over. Then they said death is
[1:29:16] certain. No sir, death isn't certain.
[1:29:20] No, indeed there might be a rapture.
[1:29:23] Then there's no death. Death isn't
[1:29:25] certain. No, no. He says, "Not in this
[1:29:28] day."
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; It was many years ago, but not now.
[1:29:33] Death is not too certain.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Death is not too certain.
[1:29:39] And the people said, "Amen.
[1:29:42] So be it."
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; One thing is certain.
[1:29:54] that after this brief life, we'll either
[1:29:57] be
[1:30:00] with God or separated from him. And my
[1:30:04] entire purpose in life is to see that
[1:30:06] people are make their calling and
[1:30:09] election sure.
[1:30:12] What preparation has God made for us?
[1:30:15] And this is the preparation that I've
[1:30:16] been speaking about.
[1:30:18] The anointing that's been poured out
[1:30:20] onto us. This preparation, this
[1:30:22] anointing that I've been speaking about
[1:30:24] is God's preparation to return us back
[1:30:28] in our full position as sons and
[1:30:31] daughters of God. The scripture says,
[1:30:33] Apostle Paul speaking to all that be in
[1:30:36] Rome, beloved of God, called to be
[1:30:40] saints.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Not just called to be a church, called
[1:30:46] to be saints. And then he said to the
[1:30:48] Corinthians unto the church of God which
[1:30:51] is at Corenth to them that are
[1:30:54] sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be
[1:30:59] saints. Hallelujah. We're not called
[1:31:01] just to, you know, just to kind of make
[1:31:04] our way and stumble along through life.
[1:31:06] We're we are sanctified in Christ Jesus.
[1:31:10] Separated. Sanctified means set apart
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; for the exclusive right of the one who
[1:31:17] set you apart.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; We are under his we are part of his
[1:31:21] exclusive property.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Sanctified,
[1:31:28] consecrated to him, set apart. Say,
[1:31:31] well, how do we do that?
[1:31:34] Well, I think we ought to examine our
[1:31:37] our life, our agenda, the things that we
[1:31:39] are engaged in and just say, you know,
[1:31:42] is this fully necessary or could I spend
[1:31:46] this time is
[1:31:49] is this really what he wants me to think
[1:31:51] about? Is this really what he wants me
[1:31:53] to uh you know, we have our lives to
[1:31:56] live. And if we're a farmer, be the best
[1:31:59] farmer you can. Housewife, be the best
[1:32:01] housewife. whatever God has led you to
[1:32:04] be, but don't let it be your master. Let
[1:32:08] it be your servant.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Don't let it tell you how you're going
[1:32:12] to live your life and how you're going
[1:32:14] to serve your God, lest it become an
[1:32:17] idol.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Anything can
[1:32:24] become an idol.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Your car can become an idol. Your home
[1:32:28] can become an idol. Your church can
[1:32:31] become an idol. Anything that is put
[1:32:33] ahead of God becomes an idol. Your
[1:32:37] family can become an idol.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; So, we want to move all those idols out
[1:32:46] of the way.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; So, we're called to be saints. And he
[1:32:54] says in Timothy, who hath saved us and
[1:32:58] called us with a holy calling, not
[1:33:01] according to our works, but according to
[1:33:04] his own purpose and grace, which was
[1:33:06] given us in Christ Jesus before the
[1:33:10] world began. And so now
[1:33:14] I want to move
[1:33:16] to this question in view of
[1:33:21] this holy calling.
[1:33:26] I felt to really make this service that
[1:33:30] God would grant that this atmosphere,
[1:33:32] this service would be indeed different
[1:33:35] and perhaps even sober because I want
[1:33:38] you to think so deeply that when you
[1:33:41] leave here, it will have stayed with you
[1:33:44] and it will affect your thoughts and
[1:33:47] affect your future.
[1:33:50] In view of this holy calling
[1:33:54] and in view of the fact that we're
[1:33:57] living in the season that we're in,
[1:34:00] a rapture season,
[1:34:03] and we're seeking to prepare ourselves
[1:34:07] for that time. And I really quite
[1:34:09] frankly don't believe that we can just
[1:34:11] be Sunday go to meeting Christians and
[1:34:14] have that happen. I believe this is a
[1:34:16] daily thing. You only come here to
[1:34:18] become instructed and you go home to
[1:34:21] live it out.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; You go to your work and live it out
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; your in your daily life. But in view of
[1:34:28] this season and in view of the coming of
[1:34:30] the Lord, the question is what
[1:34:33] preparation
[1:34:34] should we be making for the rapture?
[1:34:39] in questions and answers.
[1:34:45] Uh
[1:34:48] oh yes, here here I was I was giving the
[1:34:50] actual quote where brother Brandham now
[1:34:53] talks about
[1:34:55] uh how the anointing came down to us.
[1:34:58] But I want to I want to slip away from
[1:35:00] that and return back refer back to
[1:35:05] where Jacob now has the dream and he
[1:35:08] sees the angels descending and ascending
[1:35:12] and he rose up because now
[1:35:17] I even had to quote brother Brenham said
[1:35:21] let me be an angel
[1:35:24] descending
[1:35:26] for the purpose of of that service
[1:35:30] and I thought of all of the times now if
[1:35:33] that was if that was the first instance
[1:35:37] I hope you don't I don't lose you if
[1:35:39] that was the first instance when Jacob
[1:35:42] the first inclination
[1:35:45] of anything that had the concept of
[1:35:49] anointing was when he saw angels
[1:35:53] ascending and descending
[1:35:56] now Here we are
[1:35:59] all these
[1:36:01] centuries and thousands of years later
[1:36:04] from Jacob's time. Here we are sitting
[1:36:07] in the building and we can say we're
[1:36:09] part of the lineage of Abraham, Isaac,
[1:36:13] and Jacob. We're part of that holy
[1:36:17] lineage. And here we are. And we're
[1:36:20] gathered here around a message.
[1:36:23] We're gathered here around a word
[1:36:27] and we wouldn't be here had we if we had
[1:36:30] any question or doubt
[1:36:33] that we are here because there has been
[1:36:37] angels ascending
[1:36:40] and descending.
[1:36:45] The seven seals, the opening of the
[1:36:48] seven seals
[1:36:50] is actually a centerpiece
[1:36:52] to the message.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; I can say the opening of the word is the
[1:36:57] shift in the message.
[1:37:01] I think it's more than curious that
[1:37:04] brother Brandham's ministry, listen
[1:37:06] close now, he had all his years of
[1:37:09] ministry in the first pull and the
[1:37:12] second pull and then coming up and some
[1:37:15] don't think that a third pull has
[1:37:16] happened. Listen, I got news for you. He
[1:37:18] even said that the angel when the sword
[1:37:20] came in his hand says this is the third
[1:37:22] pull.
[1:37:24] And now when that happens and the seals
[1:37:27] are open, he he actually has literally
[1:37:31] the same amount of time. God allows him
[1:37:34] to remain on earth the same length of
[1:37:36] time as the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:37:41] from 63 to 65 about three and a half
[1:37:45] years and then he's gone.
[1:37:48] the ministry of Jesus Christ on earth
[1:37:51] and now a a messenger revealing the son
[1:37:53] of man. You see
[1:37:57] the actual revealing of the son of man,
[1:38:00] he would not have been revealed because
[1:38:02] the son of man is the word. He would not
[1:38:05] have been revealed without a third pull
[1:38:08] or the opening of the word. And in the
[1:38:11] opening of the word, we have it because
[1:38:13] he said the seven angels, he said they
[1:38:16] came from the eternities in just a
[1:38:19] flash. Just a split was the word he
[1:38:22] used. Just a split. You talk about
[1:38:25] descending. They're not busy climbing up
[1:38:27] and down ladders. It came in just a
[1:38:29] split
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; and the word opened up.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; And the and and the message even said it
[1:38:36] himself that
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; the seals Christ took the seals off
[1:38:41] himself.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; He unveiled himself. The bridegroom
[1:38:45] making himself known to the bride. Not a
[1:38:47] courtship anymore. Not even just a
[1:38:50] marriage anymore. But this is
[1:38:52] postmarriage.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; He's coming to the bride,
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; showing who he is.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; She's a virgin bride. Pregnates her with
[1:39:01] the pure word of God. What is it?
[1:39:04] Pouring himself
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; into her
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; by the word which from the beginning was
[1:39:10] the logos that came out infused with the
[1:39:14] life and the power to bring forth the
[1:39:17] promise of the day. And the promise of
[1:39:19] the day is I'm going to take you to my
[1:39:21] place. I've prepared a place and I'm
[1:39:24] taking you to my place. And he pours in.
[1:39:27] The end messenger has to come and pour
[1:39:30] that word in. It is the anointing. I say
[1:39:33] it's like a final act.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? The final act. The
[1:39:38] mighty anointing poured into the bride.
[1:39:42] She receives the seed. She changes her
[1:39:44] status. Hallelujah. From a widow, from a
[1:39:48] harlot, from whatever. She's changed her
[1:39:51] status to the wife of the lamb of God
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; and has received the engrafted word, the
[1:39:59] anointing poured out into her, the word
[1:40:03] poured into her with the power to take
[1:40:05] her back to her home.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; And that's the whole cycle of
[1:40:11] redemption.
[1:40:13] When God be to pour out that little
[1:40:15] logos that came out from him, that
[1:40:17] little light, the sun,
[1:40:19] he knew then what he was going to do.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; And here we are. They say at the final
[1:40:25] stage. Here we are at the end of time.
[1:40:29] Oh my brother, my sister, it's the end
[1:40:33] time. We could sing it is the evening
[1:40:35] time. It's later than we think.
[1:40:43] Hallelujah.
[1:40:52] Hallelujah.
[1:40:57] I mentioned this to you before a couple
[1:41:00] of services. I want to emphasize it now
[1:41:02] in the in the framework of the message
[1:41:05] this morning.
[1:41:06] That was why the Hebrews,
[1:41:10] they got the concept, they got the
[1:41:12] understanding, they got the belief that
[1:41:14] when the oil
[1:41:17] was taken and poured on to the head
[1:41:21] of the king,
[1:41:23] then that pouring became synonymous.
[1:41:26] The word anointed became synonymous with
[1:41:29] king. If you said king, he had to be an
[1:41:34] anointed one because that's how he
[1:41:35] entered into his king position. So to
[1:41:39] the Hebrews when he said he's anointed.
[1:41:41] So when Jesus came on the scene says the
[1:41:44] spirit of the Lord hath anointed me,
[1:41:46] those Jews knew what he was saying.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; He's setting himself up as a king.
[1:41:52] That's why Pilate when he was on the
[1:41:54] cross wrote over the cross and nailed it
[1:41:56] on the cross. Jesus of Nazareth, the
[1:41:59] king of the Jews. They said, "Take it
[1:42:01] down. Say that he said he was king." He
[1:42:04] said, "What I've written, I've written.
[1:42:06] It's going to remain there as a
[1:42:08] testimony. He was the king. He hadn't
[1:42:11] come into that office, but he was the
[1:42:13] king." Because he was the anointed.
[1:42:16] He was the Messiah. And the woman at the
[1:42:18] well says, "I know when the Messiah
[1:42:20] comes, he'll tell us everything. I that
[1:42:23] speak am." And I can say to you today,
[1:42:26] the Messiah
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; came.
[1:42:29] The Lord himself came and delivered his
[1:42:34] word to us. William Brandham didn't
[1:42:35] deliver. He was the mouthpiece.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; It was the Messiah
[1:42:40] pouring out his word, pregnantating his
[1:42:43] bride, giving her the very word that's
[1:42:47] infused with the power to change. You
[1:42:50] say, "Well, we're waiting for the
[1:42:51] change." You have it in your body now.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; It's like a It's like a time time
[1:42:58] capsule.
[1:43:00] waiting for the moment, that time, that
[1:43:03] moment arrives, you receive the word.
[1:43:05] That's what I'm anxious. Make sure you
[1:43:07] receive the word. That's something you
[1:43:09] can do. Don't sit here and just be a
[1:43:11] lump on a log. Don't sit here and just
[1:43:13] be an attendant in the service. You must
[1:43:15] receive the engrafted word. And it's
[1:43:18] that word. It will burst to life. It
[1:43:21] will change the atoms in your body.
[1:43:24] You'll pass into another realm.
[1:43:27] Hallelujah. a faster realm. That's his
[1:43:30] promise. And Elijah came and said, "It
[1:43:33] shall be."
[1:43:36] Can you say, "So, you believe it? I
[1:43:40] believe in the rapture. I believe in the
[1:43:42] change of the body. It is bulk. It's
[1:43:45] been spoken. And so shall it be."
[1:43:50] I didn't say it. Not even William
[1:43:53] Brandham said it. The Messiah said it.
[1:43:56] That's where people get mixed up. They
[1:43:57] can't get that sorted out.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was a man who fished.
[1:44:04] Brother Brandon was a man who said, "I
[1:44:05] made a lot of mistakes." But that
[1:44:07] Messiah made no mistakes.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; That word is absolutely true. You can
[1:44:12] count on that. You better count on that
[1:44:13] more than you count on your next
[1:44:15] paycheck. More than you count on your
[1:44:17] education or your next job. You count on
[1:44:19] what he said,
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; cuz that's going to happen. You might
[1:44:23] lose your job tomorrow. You might lose
[1:44:24] your health tomorrow. But you won't lose
[1:44:26] this word.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You won't lose this word.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; He transferred. That's why it was a
[1:44:35] transferral and they put that oil down
[1:44:38] as a prophet in the had to be a prophet
[1:44:41] because he was the agent and God spoke
[1:44:44] to him. Take the oil, pour it on the
[1:44:46] head of this young lad,
[1:44:50] David.
[1:44:52] They caught that transferal. Whoever
[1:44:54] sent the agent,
[1:44:56] whoever sent the agent, whoever sent
[1:44:59] Samuel, whoever spoke to him to come to
[1:45:02] this house, to come to this address,
[1:45:04] whoever spoke to him was going to
[1:45:07] supernaturally transfer something to
[1:45:09] that young lad David and make him king,
[1:45:13] make him whatever from shepherd to king.
[1:45:16] And when the when a prophet of God came
[1:45:18] in this day and began to pour out that
[1:45:21] word, that word has a power and you
[1:45:24] possess it now to take you from where
[1:45:26] you are into that eternal realm.
[1:45:30] Hallelujah.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; It's not something you generate. It's
[1:45:36] not something you work up. It's not
[1:45:38] something that you're you can do. It's
[1:45:40] something that God has given.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is believe it.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Accept it.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:49] [Music]
[1:45:55] Hallelujah.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Jacob anointed a stone.
[1:46:02] He anointed a stone.
[1:46:07] But there's another stone.
[1:46:10] It's the stone that the re that the
[1:46:12] builders rejected.
[1:46:14] There's another stone that is the
[1:46:16] anointed one. It's called a precious
[1:46:19] stone. He's called a sure foundation
[1:46:22] stone. He's called a tried stone. He's a
[1:46:25] true stone. Hallelujah. Our anchor, our
[1:46:29] one that's anointed is not some stone
[1:46:31] that's in some wilderness. It is the
[1:46:33] Lord Jesus Christ. And he said in Peter
[1:46:36] that he's the head of the cornerstone.
[1:46:39] And the scripture says in Revelation
[1:46:41] 21:11, speaking about the bride and the
[1:46:45] new Jerusalem having the glory of God
[1:46:48] and her light, not his light now, but
[1:46:50] her light. How to get to be her light.
[1:46:53] It was transferred by the anointed word
[1:46:57] from him to her.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; She had to have his light.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; It was his light, but he gave it to her.
[1:47:06] Now at the end of the age is called her
[1:47:08] light.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Your light. And her light.
[1:47:13] What was it like? He said her light was
[1:47:16] like unto a stone.
[1:47:18] Most precious.
[1:47:20] Hallelujah. She become like him.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; You know when two people live together a
[1:47:29] long long time like I and my wife, they
[1:47:33] start looking like each other.
[1:47:36] She's got white hair. I got white hair.
[1:47:37] We can blame each other. If you hadn't
[1:47:39] got white hair, maybe mine still be
[1:47:40] black. You got white hair. I have to
[1:47:42] have white hair. We kind of look the
[1:47:44] same. Kind of get glasses look the same.
[1:47:45] Walk down the street and people say,
[1:47:46] "Now that's a nice brother and sister."
[1:47:49] No, actually we're husband and wife.
[1:47:52] Oh,
[1:47:56] you're going to think I'm sure enough
[1:47:57] crazy, but I've seen people have had
[1:47:59] animals long enough and and and they'll
[1:48:02] pick a dog that look just they'll pick a
[1:48:04] dog that looks just like them.
[1:48:14] We've just been with him. We've been
[1:48:17] with him
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; in so in such a way we've walked with
[1:48:21] him. We've come to know him so much that
[1:48:25] you start to act like him. You begin to
[1:48:27] talk like him. You begin to think like
[1:48:30] him and you look like him. It's her
[1:48:33] light.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; You're the light of the world. You're
[1:48:36] the light of the world. Is that what the
[1:48:38] word says? You're the light. Where'd you
[1:48:40] get it from? It's transferred to you.
[1:48:43] Been transferred by an anointed word.
[1:48:45] You have the light.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; It's like a precious stone.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; In the infallibility. Oh, I love this.
[1:48:53] I've got to close pretty soon, but in
[1:48:54] the infallibility of God's word said,
[1:48:57] Jacob lays down. God shuts him off,
[1:49:00] gives him a coma of a vision. And he
[1:49:03] looked up and he saw a ladder fastened
[1:49:06] up in heaven to God's throne and reached
[1:49:09] all the way to the earth. and angels
[1:49:12] ascending and descending on the ladder
[1:49:14] up and down. Now it says all through the
[1:49:17] years we find out that this is a
[1:49:19] beautiful promise here that God had
[1:49:22] promised a way of escape, a ladder to
[1:49:26] climb, a sure foundation. God promised
[1:49:30] it, but it was hooked in glory to the
[1:49:32] throne of God. But where could he find a
[1:49:35] place on earth to hook it?
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Where could he find a place on earth to
[1:49:39] hook it into? He said he tried to hook
[1:49:41] it one time to a Jewish nation and found
[1:49:44] out that he couldn't do it. And he he
[1:49:47] couldn't hook it up on Abraham. Little
[1:49:49] fellow sitting there backslid little shy
[1:49:52] lying treating his wife the way he was.
[1:49:54] He couldn't hook it there. He said he
[1:49:56] promised the seed and the seed in Jacob.
[1:49:59] But he couldn't hook it into Jacob the
[1:50:01] surer. He couldn't hook it into the
[1:50:03] temple. Jesus said there'll be a time
[1:50:05] when there won't be one stone left upon
[1:50:07] another. So he couldn't hook the ladder
[1:50:09] into the temple. He tried the patriarch
[1:50:11] David and he and he took Ba Sheba for
[1:50:14] her wife and had Uriah her husband
[1:50:16] killed everything he tried to hook it
[1:50:18] into. It couldn't wouldn't anchor but oh
[1:50:21] hallelujah the prophet said there'll
[1:50:23] come a stone out of Zion.
[1:50:28] Are you enthused about this? There come
[1:50:30] a stone. The ladder has been hooked into
[1:50:33] the the stone. A tried stone. A proven
[1:50:37] stone. a precious stone. A stone most
[1:50:41] precious, my friends. That's that's our
[1:50:44] stone.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; He said he hooked it into Jesus Christ.
[1:50:51] And there it's anchored and there's no
[1:50:54] slipping. There's no sliding. There's no
[1:50:57] way of it getting away.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; He said it's hooked by God above and by
[1:51:03] the Son of God beneath.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; That beautiful language. It's hooked by
[1:51:09] God above and by his son beneath. He's
[1:51:12] hooked it and you can't fail. Look, he
[1:51:15] said there's great companies of angels
[1:51:18] up and down here ascending and
[1:51:20] descending, picking up the weary and the
[1:51:22] sick, healing their bodies and showing
[1:51:25] showing visions and mighty signs and
[1:51:28] wonders. And it can't fail. It can't
[1:51:30] slip. It can't slide. You're safe. God
[1:51:34] said so and that settles it forever.
[1:51:47] I love this language.
[1:51:49] It's hooked
[1:51:51] around the heart of God in heaven.
[1:51:55] It's hooked around the Son of God on
[1:51:58] earth.
[1:52:00] And we're brought into it through the
[1:52:02] Son of God. And we ascend to him.
[1:52:07] can't fail. There's no failing to it. It
[1:52:10] doesn't rest upon what I do. It rest
[1:52:13] upon what he did.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; And it's already finished.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:52:29] I think probably
[1:52:32] I'm going to wind it down
[1:52:35] because there just you know that one
[1:52:37] thing about the message there's no it's
[1:52:39] hard to find a starting place. I spend
[1:52:41] so much time trying to find a starting
[1:52:43] place and I know once I get started I'm
[1:52:46] going to find a harder time finding a
[1:52:47] stopping place. That's about where I am
[1:52:49] right now.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll just conclude with this.
[1:53:00] He says when anything's going to happen
[1:53:03] on the earth first God sends a messenger
[1:53:08] and that messenger is anointed by an
[1:53:11] angel.
[1:53:14] So now already the messenger is
[1:53:16] anointed. In other words,
[1:53:19] wouldn't you feel a little special
[1:53:22] if someone come to your door and said,
[1:53:25] "I've been sent
[1:53:28] by the president. I've been sent by the
[1:53:30] prime minister."
[1:53:34] This must be a special message.
[1:53:37] In fact is I have here
[1:53:40] I have here an invitation
[1:53:43] for you.
[1:53:45] This invitation is to some very very
[1:53:49] special event. There's only going to be
[1:53:51] a handful of people there. Going to be
[1:53:53] very few that's invited. And every
[1:53:56] statement that they make makes it even
[1:53:58] more special.
[1:54:00] Came to your house, came to your
[1:54:01] address.
[1:54:04] Said, "How are you chosen?" Well, it's
[1:54:07] actually a rare system that we identify
[1:54:10] people, but out of this entire city,
[1:54:13] you're the only one. You mean I'm only
[1:54:16] one in a million?
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; And so you're the one that's been
[1:54:19] chosen. There's only going to be a few
[1:54:21] at the table. And when is it? Oh, that
[1:54:25] is uh next Tuesday. Oh, that's too bad.
[1:54:29] You know, I I'm going over visiting some
[1:54:32] friends on Tuesday. You know what's
[1:54:33] going to happen? You're going to say,
[1:54:35] "I'll be there.
[1:54:37] I'll call I'll call my friends and say,
[1:54:38] "Sorry, folks. I got another
[1:54:40] appointment. I got something more
[1:54:42] important." Well, right now is what
[1:54:45] that's why it means something very very
[1:54:47] significant to me. I don't just talk
[1:54:49] about brother Brandon was another man
[1:54:51] who came and ministered.
[1:54:53] A messenger came said he'd been anointed
[1:54:56] by an angel. Something poured into him
[1:55:00] and the angel which he told you many
[1:55:03] times. The angel he said you know who it
[1:55:06] is.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; It is the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the
[1:55:11] Holy Spirit standing right there at the
[1:55:14] platform. And I was the age of some of
[1:55:16] you fellas here, 14, when I heard that
[1:55:19] for the first time. They said, "Brother
[1:55:21] Brandom will not do anything until the
[1:55:24] angel has come to the platform.
[1:55:29] I've seen it so many times, friends, and
[1:55:31] he'd just be talking.
[1:55:34] Nice to be with you.
[1:55:36] So happy for the invitation we received.
[1:55:39] Now we're here just to be a blessing to
[1:55:41] the people be going on and on. They
[1:55:43] might say, "You know what? I'm waiting
[1:55:45] for go on and on. This is a nice
[1:55:47] country, etc., etc. I've just seen it so
[1:55:50] many times." So now you watch. He just
[1:55:53] go, he just be in the middle of this
[1:55:55] conversation like that. He just go like
[1:55:56] this. He's here.
[1:56:00] And a whole holy hush just fell on the
[1:56:03] people. He's here.
[1:56:06] Need to see sometime. We didn't hardly
[1:56:08] know what world he was in.
[1:56:11] So, bring the bring the patient, bring
[1:56:14] the first person,
[1:56:16] bring the card, you know, the person and
[1:56:19] then then begin to reveal the secret of
[1:56:22] their heart. See, he didn't have that on
[1:56:25] his own. It was the angel that was
[1:56:28] anointing him. And now the angel, he was
[1:56:32] told by God, you go and wait. you go
[1:56:35] west for and he says this
[1:56:42] and he had a vision.
[1:56:45] Now this is just so natural. They were
[1:56:47] out hunting Havalina hogs.
[1:56:50] Brother Fred Sothman, brother Jean
[1:56:52] Norman is with them. They're just out
[1:56:53] there. They haven't made their
[1:56:56] preparation isn't to be in a suit
[1:56:59] and neither was their preparation
[1:57:00] especially to be in hunting clothes.
[1:57:02] That's just what was happening. But he
[1:57:05] knew that he was supposed to be out
[1:57:06] there. And then he said,
[1:57:10] "Brother Sothman hadn't gotten his hog."
[1:57:14] And they were so determined to get him
[1:57:17] that hog. So determined. And even with
[1:57:20] all of that, but he said, "But it didn't
[1:57:24] happen." And he said, "And the the Lord
[1:57:28] had told him, you must sanctify
[1:57:31] yourself."
[1:57:33] So instead of getting all and you know
[1:57:35] getting a hog and the hunt was
[1:57:37] successful and all this, God kept it
[1:57:39] from that because God had told him you
[1:57:43] must sanctify yourself for the
[1:57:45] visitation of those angels.
[1:57:48] Sanctifies you must set yourself aside.
[1:57:52] So maybe instead of say, "Well, I got
[1:57:55] something to do. I got to I got to do
[1:57:56] something." Maybe you don't got to do
[1:57:59] it.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Maybe you can set yourself aside.
[1:58:03] Sanctify yourself. Sanctify yourself is
[1:58:06] not trying to get yourself in some holy
[1:58:08] holy position and rise way up in some,
[1:58:12] you know, false humility or false
[1:58:15] holiness. It's not that. It's just going
[1:58:17] about doing what you'd normally do. your
[1:58:20] sisters wash the dishes and prepare your
[1:58:21] lunch and do all this and then there
[1:58:23] comes a times that well I could uh uh
[1:58:26] maybe I should go out and uh then you
[1:58:29] just feel something little strange just
[1:58:32] feel another presence. No,
[1:58:36] I think I'll just set myself aside
[1:58:39] and I'll hear God. What would you have
[1:58:41] me to hear? I sense that you're near.
[1:58:45] I sense you're wanting to say something
[1:58:47] and you just watch him.
[1:58:50] You invite him because now you start
[1:58:53] putting into practice what a messenger
[1:58:55] said. You invite him and what's he said?
[1:58:59] Every time he's invited, he comes.
[1:59:02] You give him a real invitation
[1:59:05] and he will come. And that is part of
[1:59:09] sanctifying yourself. The Lord willing,
[1:59:11] I'll get to it. I know you've read about
[1:59:14] Josiah. I asked you to read about Josiah
[1:59:17] and I'll come to him. That young man
[1:59:21] touched my heart so deeply because he
[1:59:25] cleansed. He cleaned it. Even when he
[1:59:28] had them destroy their idols, he said,
[1:59:30] "Bring them in front of me. I actually
[1:59:33] want to see you do it. I want to see
[1:59:36] you." He He was rejoicing.
[1:59:40] young man in his in his teen years
[1:59:43] rejoicing that Israel was being
[1:59:45] cleansed. I say to this congregation,
[1:59:48] let's sanctify ourselves.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Let's make ourselves ready for what God
[1:59:53] has. You say, "What has he got?" I don't
[1:59:55] know. Maybe it'll be the change.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; That's what we're living for. And as I
[2:00:01] said on Wednesday, you'll never regret
[2:00:03] making those steps, taking those steps.
[2:00:06] Now, you'll never regret it. And God
[2:00:09] will bless you. And I say, God bless you
[2:00:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:00:14] And may these words sink down deep and
[2:00:17] anchor in your heart. May we be a holy
[2:00:20] sanctified people to God. A real
[2:00:23] testimony. Let's be a credit to this
[2:00:26] message in this end time. There's enough
[2:00:29] stripes been laid upon his back. There's
[2:00:32] enough evil that's been cast upon him.
[2:00:35] Let's let us just stand as real true
[2:00:41] believers and be a real credit to this
[2:00:44] gospel, this message. Do you feel the
[2:00:47] same?
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand, shall we?
[2:00:55] The musicians may come.
[2:01:02] We'll bow our heads. And while our heads
[2:01:04] are bowed,
[2:01:08] I want to say to every person
[2:01:12] within the sound of my voice,
[2:01:15] don't let
[2:01:17] don't let any pride stand in the way.
[2:01:22] Don't let Satan work on the facts. Say,
[2:01:25] "Well, oh, you're you're regarded as a
[2:01:29] real strong believer."
[2:01:32] But if God is speaking to your heart, I
[2:01:35] ask you to surrender to him now. If God
[2:01:38] is touching something,
[2:01:41] don't be ashamed to ask someone to
[2:01:44] forgive you. Don't be ashamed to just uh
[2:01:50] answer positively with a yay Lord. Speak
[2:01:55] Lord and I will answer. Speak Lord and I
[2:02:00] will do it. This is what I prayed my
[2:02:03] precious precious believer friends. I
[2:02:07] prayed this morning that God would move
[2:02:09] in such a way and just so that we would
[2:02:14] lay aside everything of our own
[2:02:17] feelings, of our own thoughts, our own
[2:02:19] ambitions, and say, "Speak, Lord, and I
[2:02:22] will answer."
[2:02:25] I wonder if we could just perhaps sing,
[2:02:28] "Speak my Lord. speak my Lord and I'll
[2:02:30] be quick to answer thee and then you
[2:02:33] just keep your head bowed if you would.
[2:02:35] I'm sure that you know the
[2:02:38] chorus.
[2:02:42] Speak my Lord and I'll be quick to
[2:02:44] answer thee.
[2:02:48] Speak my Lord.
[2:02:54] Speak my Lord.
[2:03:00] Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[2:03:09] Speak my Lord.
[2:03:14] Speak my Lord.
[2:03:20] Speak and I will answer.
[2:03:25] Lord,
[2:03:26] send me.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing it once again.
[2:03:31] Speak my Lord.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. Speak my Lord.
[2:03:42] Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Speak my
[2:03:56] speak my
[2:04:01] [Music]
[2:04:02] speak and I will answer
[2:04:09] me. Our
[2:04:13] dear Lord Jesus Christ, it is in your
[2:04:15] holy righteous name,
[2:04:19] name of our masterpiece, redeemer, the
[2:04:23] name that was spoken first by an angel
[2:04:26] sent from the very presence of God. You
[2:04:29] shall call his name Jesus, for he shall
[2:04:31] save his people from their sins. Lord
[2:04:34] Jesus, here we stand today. An audience
[2:04:39] of people that have been redeemed by the
[2:04:42] blood of God, by the blood of the lamb,
[2:04:46] standing here washed. Oh God, you have
[2:04:50] standing here called. You have called
[2:04:53] and all we could do is answer. Here am
[2:04:55] I. Here am I. Take me. Cleanse me. Wash
[2:05:00] me. Send me. Anoint me, oh God. Here we
[2:05:04] are standing as a body of the redeemed.
[2:05:07] A multicultural group of people from
[2:05:10] many, many countries, many different
[2:05:13] languages, many different tongues, but
[2:05:16] we have one voice. It's the voice of the
[2:05:19] gospel of Jesus Christ, which you've
[2:05:22] delivered to us in this hour. Cause us
[2:05:24] to be a faithful people. cause us. Oh
[2:05:27] God, there may be those here and I know
[2:05:29] there are that are not filled with the
[2:05:32] Holy Spirit. Fill them, oh God. Move out
[2:05:35] all the debris. Move out all the
[2:05:37] hindrances and fill them with the Holy
[2:05:39] Ghost. Give them such a hunger. I pray
[2:05:42] that you'll put such a hunger, Lord. Put
[2:05:44] such a hunger, oh God. I'm praying for a
[2:05:47] hunger, oh God, in every life. I'm
[2:05:49] praying for a thirst, oh God. We hunger
[2:05:54] and thirst after you. I pray father
[2:05:56] you'll put it displace everything else
[2:05:59] Lord and let the hunger uh be the
[2:06:02] predominant thing in the people's lives
[2:06:04] father may they find themselves taking
[2:06:06] up the word may they find themselves
[2:06:09] hearing may they find themselves
[2:06:11] meditating and thinking upon the
[2:06:13] promises that you've made they find
[2:06:16] themselves speaking with their mouth
[2:06:18] Lord not my will thine be done I'm
[2:06:21] seeking to know your will just show me
[2:06:23] what you'd have me to do. What would you
[2:06:26] have me to do? Speak, Lord, and I'll do
[2:06:27] it. Let this be the very beat of the
[2:06:30] heart of the people. I pray in the name
[2:06:33] of Jesus. Let the words today, oh God,
[2:06:35] that have been so solemnly spoken, let
[2:06:38] it take root in the hearts of every
[2:06:40] individual, oh God. I thank you for
[2:06:42] their sincerity. Thank you that they are
[2:06:45] here. Thank you that they are your
[2:06:48] children. You've called them to be
[2:06:49] saints. And now, Father, I commit the
[2:06:52] word that has been spoken to the to the
[2:06:56] administration of the Holy Spirit, take
[2:06:59] it and place it in every heart, I pray,
[2:07:01] in good ground. And may it bring forth,
[2:07:03] may it bring forth in the name of Jesus
[2:07:06] Christ. Let it bring forth fruit for the
[2:07:10] kingdom of God. We thank you for it in
[2:07:14] Jesus name. Let it be glorified.
[2:07:17] Amen.
[2:07:19] Hallelujah.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Do you have something to think about?
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:34] I want company.
[2:07:37] I've been thinking very very deeply.
[2:07:42] May we all move as one body. It says the
[2:07:46] says a shepherd must be first partaker
[2:07:48] of the fruit. That's only first
[2:07:50] partaker. Everyone else is to partake.
[2:07:53] So may you be also participant in that.
[2:07:56] I'm sure that you will be. I want to
[2:07:58] sing brother Ryan.

[2:13:16] for.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; It's not a pipe dream. It's not a myth,
[2:13:21] not some mystic thing. It's a reality.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Have you ever walked down the street
[2:13:32] looking for someone who's resurrected? I
[2:13:34] have. Say, "Are you crazy?"
[2:13:38] It's going to be crazy to a lot of
[2:13:39] people.
[2:13:43] So someone comes in
[2:13:46] and you're sitting in a maybe having a
[2:13:48] bite to eat with another believer to say
[2:13:50] it's going to be a glorious time. My
[2:13:52] goodness, we don't know when it's going
[2:13:54] to happen. It's become the centerpiece.
[2:13:56] Brother Bisll said this is a centerpiece
[2:13:57] of our life. And here we are. Our whole
[2:13:59] mind is captivated. We're working but
[2:14:02] our whole mind's captivated. Some nice
[2:14:04] young man walks in. How do you do?
[2:14:10] Oh, do I know you? Well, you should.
[2:14:14] You will in a couple of minutes
[2:14:20] and the other ones maybe unbeliever
[2:14:22] sitting beside you say trying to figure
[2:14:25] this one out says, "Well, who are you?"
[2:14:28] "Well, I'm I'm one of the resurrected
[2:14:30] saints. I I went to the same church you
[2:14:32] go to. I I'm one of the resurrected
[2:14:34] saints." The other fellow scooted his
[2:14:36] chair out of there and let me get out of
[2:14:37] here right quick.
[2:14:39] that spook them out. But you say, "Hey,
[2:14:42] this is what I'm living for. This what
[2:14:45] I'm living for." Hallelujah. It's gonna
[2:14:47] happen just like that. Isn't that what
[2:14:49] happened when Jesus rose? Just you're
[2:14:51] walking walking along sad, heavy, and
[2:14:55] stranger come right along beside.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; What? What are you talking about? Oh,
[2:15:02] are you a stranger here?
[2:15:04] You stranger.

[2:15:10] what things he said. And they they begin
[2:15:14] to tell him everything that happened. He
[2:15:16] wasn't very long. Wasn't very long
[2:15:19] before they're You think they're
[2:15:21] screaming and shouting? I think they
[2:15:23] were.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; As we got to leave here, we got to find
[2:15:26] the others. We got to tell them what's
[2:15:27] happening.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
