[6:25] Amen. Number 1128, Brother David. Want
[6:29] to greet everyone in the name of our
[6:30] Lord Jesus. It's wonderful to be here
[6:32] again this morning. Looking forward to a
[6:34] wonderful time. We have one service, so
[6:36] we better put in 100% this morning.
[6:38] Amen. We have no agenda other than what
[6:40] God wants for us this morning. Why don't
[6:42] we stand and sing? In Christ alone, my
[6:44] hope is found.
[6:47] Oh, in Christ alone,
[6:50] my hope is found.
[6:54] He is my light, my strength, my song.
[7:00] This cornerstone,
[7:03] this solid ground
[7:06] burn through the fiercest proud
[7:10] and stone.
[7:12] What heights of love?
[7:14] What depths of peace? When fears are
[7:19] still,
[7:20] when striving cease.
[7:23] My comforter,
[7:26] my all in all.
[7:30] Here in the love of Christ
[7:33] I stand
[7:38] in Christ alone
[7:41] who took on flesh.
[7:44] Oh fullness of God in helpless
[7:48] faith.
[7:49] This gift of love
[7:52] and righteousness
[7:55] those born by the ones he came
[7:59] to save till on that cross
[8:04] and Jesus died.
[8:06] The wrath of God was satisfied.
[8:12] For every sin
[8:15] on him was laid.
[8:18] Here in the death of Christ I live.
[8:22] Let's sing the third verse. There in the
[8:24] ground. Oh there in the ground
[8:29] his body lay.
[8:32] Light of the world by darkness
[8:36] lay. and bursting forth in glorious day
[8:44] up from the graveyard
[8:46] [Music]
[8:54] [Music]
[9:06] with the precious blood. And why don't
[9:09] we sing that verse once again? There in
[9:11] the ground. Oh, there in the ground
[9:17] his body laid.
[9:20] Oh, light of the world by darkness
[9:24] flame.
[9:25] Then bursting forth in glorious day.
[9:31] Up from the grave he rose
[9:35] again.
[9:36] And as he stands
[9:39] in victory,
[9:42] since curse has lost
[9:45] his grip on me, for I am his
[9:51] and he is mine.
[9:54] But with the precious blood
[9:57] of Christ,
[10:00] no guilt in life. No guilt in life.
[10:05] spirit death. Oh, this is the power of
[10:10] Christ
[10:11] in me from life.
[10:16] Final breath.
[10:19] Jesus commands my destiny.
[10:24] No power of hell,
[10:27] no schema of man
[10:30] can never
[10:33] be me from his hand to return
[10:38] or call me home.
[10:42] Here in the power of Christ, no power of
[10:45] hell. Oh, no power of hell. No scheme of
[10:51] man
[10:52] can ever
[10:55] be from his hand till he returns
[11:01] or calls me home
[11:04] here in the power of no power of hell
[11:07] once more. Oh no,
[11:12] no sche

[22:33] Amen. We're going to go to prayer at

[22:37] come take these requests for us before
[22:39] the Lord? I want to remember Sister
[22:42] Peggy Dale. She's having trouble with
[22:44] her back. It's a request from her
[22:45] brother Ernie.
[22:47] And also, please pray for my aunt Gene
[22:48] in North Carolina. She was burned in a
[22:51] cooking accident on Thanksgiving Day and
[22:52] is in a hospital and she needs to have
[22:54] skin grafts on the burned areas of her
[22:56] body. His desire that God would do a
[22:59] work on her behalf and also a request
[23:01] from the Esther Heisen family. Please
[23:04] pray for brother Ruan. The surgeon will
[23:06] decide tomorrow whether the end of his
[23:07] right index finger should be amputated
[23:09] or not. Just ask that God would move on
[23:11] his behalf and that the surgery would
[23:13] not be required. Amen. Ask what you will
[23:16] and it shall be given. And why don't we
[23:18] sing surely the presence of the Lord is
[23:19] in this place. If there's something on
[23:21] your heart that you'd just like to raise
[23:22] before the Lord as our brother Daniel
[23:24] would come, just let it be known with an
[23:25] uplifted hand. Amen.
[23:28] Oh, surely
[23:31] the presence
[23:33] of the Lord is in this place.
[23:38] I can feel his mighty power
[23:44] and his grace.
[23:48] And I can hear the rush of angel wings.
[23:54] I see glory
[23:57] on each face.
[24:00] Surely
[24:02] the presence.
[24:04] The Lord
[24:07] is in this place.
[24:10] Oh, surely
[24:13] the presence
[24:15] of the Lord is in this place.
[24:20] I can feel his mighty power
[24:26] and his praise.
[24:30] I can hear the rush of angel wings. I
[24:36] sing glory
[24:38] on each face.
[24:42] Surely
[24:44] the presence
[24:46] of the Lord
[24:48] is in this place.

[25:04] Precious heavenly father, we come before
[25:07] your presence, Lord.
[25:10] Oh God, knowing oh God who we are,
[25:13] Father, knowing that you took us from
[25:16] the dust of this earth, oh Father, and
[25:19] there is nothing good in us, oh Lord
[25:21] Jesus, to approach your presence.
[25:24] If we come, oh Lord Jesus, as we are,
[25:27] it's only because of your grace, oh God.
[25:30] You have purchased us, oh Lord, by your
[25:32] precious blood. You are the one who made
[25:35] us who we are to this morning, Father.
[25:38] And we come to glorify your name, oh
[25:40] God. We come to lift up your name,
[25:43] Father, because thou yourself are
[25:45] worthy, Lord. There is no one else like
[25:47] you, oh God. That is why, oh Lord, your

[33:06] Oh, and I could search for all eternity,
[33:12] Lord,
[33:14] and find that there is none like you.
[33:23] [Music]
[33:28] little bit of a confession to make.
[33:32] It's hard to get up here. And the more
[33:35] you're out, the harder it is.
[33:38] I was coming down this back hallway here
[33:40] last last Sunday. I just thought I sing
[33:42] a song and uh it didn't transpire and
[33:46] brother Michael Andes I just said to
[33:50] tell tell Ryan that uh you know I'll
[33:53] have one ready in the next week or so.
[33:55] And so on Wednesday, uh,
[34:01] um, Brother Derek pointed over like
[34:04] that. Brother Mike, we got that song
[34:05] ready. And, uh, Brother Ken reminded me
[34:09] as I'm going down the hall here, he
[34:10] says, man, you had a shot fired. Are you
[34:12] ready yet?
[34:14] I don't know how he missed me, but it
[34:16] wasn't my turn.
[34:19] Anyway, I just uh
[34:21] [Music]
[34:23] pray you be blessed and
[34:25] [Music]
[34:28] pressing through this world of darkness,
[34:32] a pilgrim in its place.
[34:36] I dare not stop a single moment. Weary
[34:42] of the pace,
[34:45] striving ever onward, upward, I rest
[34:50] upon my knees
[34:54] to thank him for his guiding hand and
[34:58] pray, Lord, strengthen me.
[35:03] Looking back, I see the cross where he
[35:07] paid the price for sin.
[35:11] Just ahead, the amber light. His voice
[35:16] calls from within.
[35:19] You're not asked to set the pace or
[35:24] blaze uncharted land.
[35:28] Just stay in line and follow course. My
[35:32] footprints in the sand.
[35:36] Many I fear have altered course since
[35:41] starting on this way.
[35:45] Turned aside by cares of life or
[35:49] pleasures of the day.
[35:53] Keep me Lord that I lear not though
[35:58] temptors seek to sway.
[36:02] Draw me ever onward upward as I press
[36:07] this rugged way.
[36:10] Looking back, I see the cross where he
[36:14] paid the price for sin.
[36:19] Just ahead, the amber light. His voice
[36:23] calls from within.
[36:27] You're not asked to set the pace or
[36:31] blaze uncharted land
[36:35] to stay in line and follow close my
[36:40] footprints in the sand.
[36:44] You're not as to set the pace or blaze
[36:48] uncharted land.
[36:52] Just stay in line and follow close my
[36:56] footprints in the sand.
[37:00] Just stay in line and follow close my
[37:05] footprints in the sand.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Mike.
[37:19] Amen. We're going to sing When I See the
[37:21] Blood. We're going to invite our brother
[37:23] Chris and sister Held a Christ friend to
[37:24] come have a family dedication.
[37:28] Amen. Maybe as they come, why don't we
[37:29] just sing this, we'll turn the service
[37:30] to our brother Tom for the dedication.
[37:34] When I
[37:37] see the blood.
[37:41] When I
[37:44] see the blood.
[37:48] When I
[37:51] see the blood,
[37:55] I will pass. I will pass over you. When
[38:01] I see the blood. Oh, when I
[38:06] see the blood.
[38:09] Oh, when I
[38:13] I see the blood.
[38:17] And I
[38:20] see the
[38:24] pass
[38:27] over you.
[38:29] [Music]
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[38:36] is coming.
[38:39] All will be there.
[38:42] eats
[38:45] justly his duty
[38:52] blood of the lamb
[38:55] and I will pass will pass over you.
[39:01] Oh, when I
[39:05] see the blood,
[39:08] when I
[39:11] see the blood,
[39:15] when I
[39:18] see the blood,
[39:21] I will pass. I will pass over you.
[39:28] [Music]
[39:32] Brother Chris and sister Hilda Celikum
[39:35] are standing here with their family
[39:38] and I thought it was very appropriate
[39:40] that we would sing a little chorus like
[39:41] that for the family. We not only have a
[39:44] baby dedication, Josiah, but we also
[39:47] have a family dedication of the
[39:49] Celicums. And I and I believe that's
[39:52] very appropriate
[39:54] uh for a dad's wish and desire for his
[39:57] children, for his wife, and for his
[40:00] children. How many believe that we're in
[40:01] an Exodus hour?
[40:04] &gt;&gt; So, this is very appropriate, isn't it?
[40:06] &gt;&gt; God dealing with dad, God dealing with
[40:09] the family, realizing that there will be
[40:11] a lamp for a home.
[40:13] And God has given a great revelation to
[40:15] brother Chris. And by that revelation,
[40:18] he's brought his family under the blood.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; What a protection that is, brother
[40:24] Chris.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; What a protection that is. But in his
[40:29] arms is their new addition to this great
[40:32] family,
[40:34] Josiah.
[40:37] And Josiah means Jehovah that heals.
[40:42] But standing here are two also fine
[40:44] young men. And we have Jonathan and
[40:47] Joshua.
[40:48] And Jonathan is 14 years old and means
[40:51] Jehovah has given.
[40:54] And the next son is Joshua. Jehovah is
[40:58] salvation.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; And the third son has come and the name
[41:02] is Jehovah Heals. So I I I I see uh a
[41:07] tremendous pattern here
[41:09] &gt;&gt; that Jehovah's given salvation
[41:13] &gt;&gt; and he's the healer of the family
[41:17] &gt;&gt; body, spirit, and soul. Brother Chris
[41:24] Josiah,
[41:27] the Bible says here in 2 Kings 23 and 25
[41:30] said there were no king before him that
[41:34] turned to the Lord with all his heart
[41:37] &gt;&gt; and with all his soul and all his might
[41:38] according to all the laws of Moses.
[41:42] Neither after him arose there any like
[41:44] him.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:51] healing
[41:53] Jehovah
[41:55] or healer. Brother Bram said in the
[41:58] midst of shalom, brother Chris, sister
[42:00] Hilda,
[42:01] he said, "I don't know." He said, "I
[42:04] don't know how he's going to do it, but
[42:05] his spoken word will be a vindicated
[42:09] when the son of righteousness shall
[42:10] arise with healing in his wings."
[42:14] And the healing part, there will not be
[42:17] a physical healing as you think as
[42:19] somebody's got a sickness, but it will
[42:22] be taken away from them.
[42:25] That's what he's doing now. Jehovah, our
[42:30] healer. But the whole creation will
[42:33] change.
[42:34] This mortal will put on immortality and
[42:38] old age will jump into youth.
[42:43] Where did brother Brandham say that? He
[42:45] said in the message shalom.
[42:48] We have a protection under the blood. A
[42:51] daddy has put the blood on the door.
[42:54] He's put it over his family. Jesus
[42:56] Christ, the bleeding lamb. Revelation 5
[42:59] has come forward. And brother Chris has
[43:01] taken that revelation and put it over
[43:03] his family and has desired then the very
[43:06] life of that word to be his protection,
[43:10] to be his strength, to be his salvation,
[43:13] to be his healing.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; For God has given you a lamb.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; May God bless your home, Brother Chris.
[43:23] Brother Chris, the moment that Brother
[43:25] Chris has received this message, there's
[43:28] always two kinds of people. There's the
[43:30] givers and there's the takers. Well, I
[43:33] want to say to you in the presence of
[43:35] God that this man's a giver.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; He's been giving to the church, given
[43:40] his life, he's given his family. He's
[43:43] given his all.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; May God bless this home.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; God bless this child.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:52] Our
[44:06] dear precious heavenly father,
[44:10] when I see the blood, I'll pass over
[44:12] you.
[44:15] credling within my arms a life that you
[44:17] have blessed our dear brother Chris and
[44:20] sister he
[44:22] pray for this child
[44:25] &gt;&gt; that God that he would jump from this
[44:27] body into a new body
[44:30] &gt;&gt; that will be his promise Lord
[44:33] &gt;&gt; that father as he's raised under the
[44:34] sound of the gospel
[44:37] may he be a tribute
[44:39] may he be a compliment
[44:42] may he be a blessing to the family. And
[44:45] Father, I'm praying for this child that
[44:47] you will keep your hand upon him
[44:51] &gt;&gt; from a very young age
[44:53] and that Jehovah that heals, our Jesus
[44:56] Christ, our healer, will ever guide and
[45:00] keep protect Lord. Keep your hand upon
[45:04] him and may he be blessed in this home
[45:08] as his mother and father
[45:11] will be used to speak of that name. That
[45:14] name above all names, our lovely Lord
[45:16] Jesus. Bless this child as we dedicate
[45:18] him now to you in this little dedication
[45:22] service. Lord, may there be a wall of
[45:24] fire around him
[45:26] &gt;&gt; keeping him under the very presence of
[45:28] Jesus Christ. bless this child now in
[45:31] Jesus name.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; May you join with me now as we dedicate
[45:40] the family.
[45:49] And when I see the blood,
[45:54] brother Chris stands here with sister
[45:55] Hilda,
[45:57] their sons, Lord Jonathan, Joshua, now
[46:00] Josiah.
[46:02] May the circle never be broken.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; May this family, Lord, serve you with
[46:07] all their mind, all their soul, all
[46:09] their strength. Lord,
[46:10] &gt;&gt; may the grace of God go before them
[46:12] always, Lord. May they be their credit
[46:14] to the gospel. May the glory of God rest
[46:17] upon them, Lord, as they have come this
[46:19] morning to be dedicated, not just as a a
[46:22] little baby here, but as a family.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; May it be a tribute to the gospel. May
[46:27] your glory be seen upon them.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; And Father, as those that will come into
[46:31] their presence, whether it be in their
[46:33] home,
[46:34] &gt;&gt; by their way, may they sense the very
[46:36] glory of God. Would you use them to
[46:39] further the kingdom? Lord, as you bless
[46:41] Brother Chris, grant to him wisdom and
[46:43] leadership, Lord, and Sister Hilda, as
[46:46] you draw her closer to you, the boys.
[46:49] May you blanket them with your presence.
[46:51] We dedicate this family now to you for
[46:54] the glory of God. Bless them in Jesus
[46:57] name. Amen.
[47:01] Amen.
[47:08] Is it true?
[47:19] Amen. We're going to invite the choir to
[47:21] come and sing for us just before brother
[47:23] Biscll comes. As they come, why don't we
[47:25] sing All to Jesus, I surrender.

[1:00:51] glor.
[1:00:53] [Music]
[1:00:58] Hallelujah.
[1:01:00] Isn't he wonderful?
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't he worthy?
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Choir.
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:11] Praise his name. Wonderful Lord Jesus.
[1:01:13] How appropriate.
[1:01:16] We're so thankful for the leadership of
[1:01:17] the Holy Spirit.
[1:01:20] Last week, I don't know what it meant to
[1:01:23] you, but
[1:01:25] I just felt from the morning before the
[1:01:27] service even to have brother Mike Gier
[1:01:30] come up and pray. And I think brother
[1:01:32] Michael you didn't expect that the Holy
[1:01:36] Spirit would just you know start brew
[1:01:39] moving and breathing over the whole
[1:01:41] congregation
[1:01:43] and the marvelous thing about it is that
[1:01:46] is that was the scripture
[1:01:48] and I
[1:01:51] and they sung a new song.
[1:01:54] See, when he took the book,
[1:01:57] then they sung a new song.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And that indeed was a new song. I don't
[1:02:02] believe you've ever done that before,
[1:02:03] Brother Michael. That wasn't you. It was
[1:02:06] God,
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit, and the sound in the
[1:02:11] auditorium
[1:02:12] was just uh something that put chills
[1:02:16] down your back. And I tell you what, you
[1:02:18] know, when we give ourselves and yield
[1:02:20] ourselves to the Holy Spirit, and the
[1:02:23] thing is, you might do something
[1:02:24] unusual. We don't do it unusual to be
[1:02:27] unusual.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; We do it because he's worthy.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; He's absolutely worthy of anything that
[1:02:35] you can offer him today.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:02:42] Well, I certainly enjoyed the song and
[1:02:45] the worship and the dedication.
[1:02:49] So, we're going to just have you join
[1:02:52] with me in prayer once more and then
[1:02:55] we'll go to the word.
[1:03:00] How lovely you are, Lord Jesus. How
[1:03:02] lovely you are.
[1:03:05] There isn't enough words in our
[1:03:06] vocabulary.
[1:03:09] We could say with the songwriter, oh for
[1:03:12] a thousand tongues,
[1:03:14] then even a thousand tongues would be
[1:03:16] inadequate to speak of your glory, your
[1:03:20] majesty.
[1:03:21] Lord, these puny, insignificant minds
[1:03:24] that we have today. They need to be
[1:03:26] illuminated. And I pray you'll expand
[1:03:29] the boundaries of our thought. I pray
[1:03:32] that you'll cut all the ties to this
[1:03:34] natural material world. I pray that you
[1:03:37] will cause us, oh God, to truly rise
[1:03:40] into heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:03:43] May we peer into the beyond, oh God. May
[1:03:47] we peer into our eternal home, Father. I
[1:03:50] pray, Father, in the name of Jesus
[1:03:52] Christ, that you'll take absolute
[1:03:54] control of the service. And as we have
[1:03:57] felt your presence in your nearness, now
[1:04:00] I pray you'll anoint me, oh God, to say
[1:04:02] what needs to be said. I pray that the
[1:04:05] hearers, Lord, will be quickened by the
[1:04:08] spirit of God. In the name of Jesus
[1:04:11] Christ, we dedicate ourselves to you
[1:04:14] now. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank
[1:04:18] you, musicians. If you would turn in
[1:04:20] your Bibles, please, I'd like to read
[1:04:22] from the Old Testament in the book of
[1:04:26] Ruth,
[1:04:28] 2 chapter,
[1:04:30] and we'll read from verse 8 to 12.
[1:04:41] And we'll read some verses out of
[1:04:43] Revelation 5 as well. And this is the
[1:04:47] third part
[1:04:48] and perhaps the last part of the lamb
[1:04:52] takes the book and speaks.
[1:05:09] So we'll read from Ruth, the book of
[1:05:12] Ruth first,
[1:05:15] chapter 2, verse 8. Then said Boaz unto
[1:05:19] Ruth, "Hearest thou not, my daughter. Go
[1:05:23] not to glean in another field, neither
[1:05:26] go from hence, but abide here fast by my
[1:05:30] maidens. and let thine eyes be on the
[1:05:33] field that they do reap, and go thou
[1:05:37] after them. Have I not charged the young
[1:05:41] men, that they shall not touch thee? And
[1:05:44] when thou art a thirst, go unto the
[1:05:47] vessels, and drink of that which the
[1:05:49] young men have have drawn. Then she fell
[1:05:53] on her face and bowed herself to the
[1:05:56] ground, and said unto him,
[1:06:00] Why have I found grace in thine eyes,
[1:06:03] that thou shouldest take knowledge of
[1:06:05] me, seeing I am a stranger? And Boaz
[1:06:09] answered and said unto her, It hath it
[1:06:12] hath fully been showed me all that thou
[1:06:15] hast done unto thy mother-in-law since
[1:06:17] the death of thine husband, and how thou
[1:06:20] hast left thy father and thy mother, and
[1:06:23] the land of thy nativity, and art come
[1:06:26] to unto a people which thou kneest not
[1:06:29] here to far. The Lord recompense thy
[1:06:33] work, and a full reward be given thee of
[1:06:35] the Lord of the Lord God of Israel under
[1:06:39] whose wings thou art come to trust.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Let's read then in Revelation the 5th
[1:06:45] chapter also, please. Uh we'll read the
[1:06:48] first nine verses.
[1:07:01] And I saw on the right hand of him that
[1:07:03] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:07:06] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:07:09] seals. And I saw a strong angel
[1:07:12] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:07:13] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:07:16] seals thereof.
[1:07:18] And no man in heaven nor in earth,
[1:07:21] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:07:23] the book, neither to look thereon. And I
[1:07:27] wept much because no man was found
[1:07:30] worthy to open and to read the book,
[1:07:33] neither to look thereon. And one of the
[1:07:36] elders sth unto me, weep not, behold,
[1:07:40] the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root
[1:07:43] of David hath prevailed to open the
[1:07:45] book, and to loose the seven seals
[1:07:47] thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the
[1:07:50] midst of the throne, and of the four
[1:07:52] beasts, these are four living creatures,
[1:07:55] four living ones. And in the midst of
[1:07:58] the elders stood a lamb, as it had been
[1:08:00] slain, having seven horns and seven
[1:08:03] eyes, which are the seven spirits of
[1:08:05] God, sent forth into all the earth. And
[1:08:08] he came and took the book out of the
[1:08:10] hand of him that sat upon the throne.
[1:08:13] And when he had taken the book, the four
[1:08:16] beasts and four and 20 elders fell down
[1:08:19] before the lamb, having every one of
[1:08:22] them harps and golden vials full of
[1:08:24] odors, which are the prayers of the
[1:08:26] saints. And they sung a new song,
[1:08:29] saying, Thou art worthy to take the
[1:08:31] book, and to open the seals thereof. For
[1:08:34] thou was slain, and hast redeemed us to
[1:08:37] God by thy blood out of every kindred
[1:08:40] and tongue and people and nation. God
[1:08:43] bless you as you have your seats.
[1:08:54] The reason for reading these two
[1:08:57] scriptures
[1:08:59] is because they both relate to the same
[1:09:03] event
[1:09:05] and in the breach which is just
[1:09:09] the breach which is just prior to the
[1:09:12] seals. Now I'd like I said last Sunday
[1:09:15] or last Wednesday
[1:09:17] and I really I won't be coming to this
[1:09:20] subject I don't believe again. So I
[1:09:21] would like I would like to deposit in
[1:09:25] you things that you can really ponder
[1:09:27] and think about.
[1:09:30] First I would just ask you do you
[1:09:32] believe your name was in the book?
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; That's an important question. And if it
[1:09:38] if your name was in the book, then God
[1:09:42] has already sent this messenger who's
[1:09:44] come and gone
[1:09:46] uh to declare
[1:09:48] uh and to bring you the word that will
[1:09:50] provide you the life that was written in
[1:09:52] the book.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; And that literally is the very thing
[1:09:56] that called you. You felt called. You
[1:09:59] felt drawn when you heard this message
[1:10:03] or this call or whatever title you want
[1:10:06] to give it. You felt that pull. You felt
[1:10:08] that drawing. That was because the lamb
[1:10:11] was claiming you
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; and confirming, I have bought you and
[1:10:16] you're not your own.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; You belong to me. And now the book of
[1:10:20] life become the lamb's book of life.
[1:10:28] the fifth chapter
[1:10:30] of uh Revelation and the book of Ruth
[1:10:33] both
[1:10:35] they are transitional they are trans
[1:10:39] transitional
[1:10:41] events that are happening and I want to
[1:10:44] make that a little more clear now
[1:10:46] because I I I I decided I would start
[1:10:49] right off with waters that I'm swimming
[1:10:52] in and I just uh I want to just present
[1:10:57] it to you
[1:11:02] in the seals.
[1:11:04] Brother Brandham preaches the breach and
[1:11:06] then launches into the seals first,
[1:11:08] second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and
[1:11:10] seventh and had questions and answers
[1:11:13] between the sixth and the seventh and
[1:11:16] the seventh seal. Then there's a
[1:11:18] junction also between the sixth and
[1:11:22] seventh seal in the Bible which is the
[1:11:24] seventh chapter and the 144 calling of
[1:11:27] the 144,000
[1:11:30] and then the eighth chapter of
[1:11:33] Revelation simply starts out and says
[1:11:37] that
[1:11:39] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[1:11:41] there was silence in heaven about the
[1:11:44] space of half an hour.
[1:11:46] Now, brother Brandham, excuse me, he
[1:11:49] says there are times when it almost
[1:11:52] would appear as though the seventh seal
[1:11:54] isn't opened.
[1:11:56] Uh, I would say that I believe that it's
[1:11:59] open because we know things about it now
[1:12:01] that we never knew in the past.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; But perhaps not completely fulfilled.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; And so we can say then he would say,
[1:12:10] well, we know it's not open.
[1:12:12] And in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:12:14] revealed.
[1:12:16] He said God's great mystery of how it's
[1:12:20] a secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody
[1:12:23] knowed nothing about it. Even the angels
[1:12:26] didn't understand it. See, he didn't
[1:12:29] reveal it. That's the reason under our
[1:12:32] seventh mystery, when the seventh seal
[1:12:34] was opened, there was silence. Jesus,
[1:12:38] when he was on earth, they wanted to
[1:12:40] know when he would come. And he said
[1:12:43] it's not even the son himself don't know
[1:12:47] when it's going to happen. See God has
[1:12:50] all of this to himself.
[1:12:53] It's a secret and that's the reason
[1:12:56] there was silence in heaven for a space
[1:12:58] of half an hour and seven thunders
[1:13:00] uttered their voices and John was even
[1:13:02] forbidden to write it. see the coming of
[1:13:05] the Lord.
[1:13:07] That's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[1:13:09] or how he will come and when he will
[1:13:13] come. It's a good thing that he doesn't.
[1:13:17] Now, it might sound like a conflicting
[1:13:20] uh paragraph, but it's not really if you
[1:13:22] think that we know we we didn't know
[1:13:27] previously that the seventh seal is
[1:13:30] referring to his coming. So that you
[1:13:32] know but it is it is a process and it's
[1:13:35] the process that we don't understand.
[1:13:38] Excuse me.
[1:13:40] Now there's silence between
[1:13:44] Malachi and Matthew
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; 400 years.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; That's silence.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; So we could say there's silence between
[1:13:57] the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[1:13:59] There's silence between. Why there's
[1:14:01] silence, we don't know. God's kept that
[1:14:03] to himself.
[1:14:05] But it is transitional
[1:14:07] because the next thing that's going to
[1:14:09] happen from Malachi over to Matthew is
[1:14:12] Elijah's going to be on the scene who's
[1:14:14] the forerunner.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; And we can say it's silence, but it's
[1:14:19] not inactivity.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And that's an important statement. God
[1:14:24] can be silent, but it doesn't mean
[1:14:26] nothing's happening.
[1:14:28] The most important things can be
[1:14:30] happening in silence.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; We make a lot of racket doing something
[1:14:37] and and brother Brandham says one place
[1:14:40] and God draws up maybe billions of tons
[1:14:43] of water in total silence just with the
[1:14:47] sun shining on the earth
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; and he just draws up all this water from
[1:14:51] the oceans and everything. It's a huge
[1:14:53] thing. We're glad he does. We get some
[1:14:55] rain. Maybe we're not so glad. But
[1:14:57] anyway, we got a lot here.
[1:15:00] Uh so it doesn't mean there's
[1:15:03] inactivity.
[1:15:04] So there's silence in the opening of the
[1:15:07] seventh seal doesn't mean nothing's
[1:15:09] happening. Oh well, there's silence. So,
[1:15:11] you know, I guess there's nothing
[1:15:13] happening. No, the probably the most
[1:15:15] important things in the in the world are
[1:15:17] happening. And so the transition from
[1:15:20] law to grace,
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; what a great thing that was. the
[1:15:24] transition from Malachi to John the
[1:15:28] Baptist in a short short ministry but
[1:15:31] his concluded it's a transition here
[1:15:33] comes John the Baptist and people start
[1:15:36] getting baptized never were baptized
[1:15:38] before and he introduces and he he says
[1:15:41] behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:15:42] the sin of the world what kind of a
[1:15:45] transition is that that's in his first
[1:15:46] coming but who knew he was coming in the
[1:15:49] in the time that he was being uh formed
[1:15:52] in the womb of of Mary the Virgin and
[1:15:55] then being birthed and lived for another
[1:15:57] 30 years and another three and a half
[1:16:00] years and uh only a handful of people
[1:16:03] knew who he was and only a only a very
[1:16:06] few had the revelation of truly who he
[1:16:09] was. So some saw him as a prophet, some
[1:16:12] saw him as a good man, some saw him as a
[1:16:14] great teacher, some saw him as a
[1:16:16] carpenter's son, and they had all a
[1:16:18] whole array of things about him and they
[1:16:21] had not I would say that whatever that
[1:16:23] was, God kept that sealed and they still
[1:16:26] didn't realize who he was. Just a
[1:16:28] handful of people. Now
[1:16:31] I was I have been really looking into uh
[1:16:36] into the book of Ruth. I've been reading
[1:16:38] it and reading it because in the in the
[1:16:42] uh in the message of the breach, brother
[1:16:45] Brandham goes back to the book of Ruth
[1:16:47] because that is where Boaz was doing the
[1:16:51] redemptive work and I was very curious
[1:16:54] and interested and I just kept pouring
[1:16:56] over it and pouring over it and pouring
[1:16:58] over it and reading it prayerfully and
[1:17:01] when I just seem to you come to a log
[1:17:03] jam but I don't stop at that. I just
[1:17:06] keep looking to God to see uh because
[1:17:10] when you have a prophet turning to it,
[1:17:12] you know that there's something there.
[1:17:14] So, I wanted to see the first things
[1:17:17] that Boaz said to Ruth. And as he moved
[1:17:21] forward towards his redemptive work
[1:17:24] before he took her to be his wife, I
[1:17:28] want to see what was what precluded
[1:17:31] that. And then so we have it prior to
[1:17:35] him taking her and when he actually took
[1:17:38] her. I I compare that because it's
[1:17:41] perfect to comparing it to when the lamb
[1:17:44] took the book because it was your name
[1:17:48] that was in the book and you were
[1:17:50] destined to become his wife
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; and he took the book and Boaz took Ruth
[1:17:58] and both are the same thing. He didn't.
[1:18:00] When he took Ruth, he turned her that
[1:18:04] watch the transition. He turned her from
[1:18:08] a Moabitete to an Israelite.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; When he took her, he turned her from a
[1:18:15] widow to a married woman.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; When he took her, he took her from a
[1:18:20] barren a barren woman to one who was
[1:18:25] pregnantated with his seed. Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; And I don't suppose anyone probably
[1:18:31] realized
[1:18:32] and I found it very very interesting as
[1:18:35] far as the scriptures concerned. I'm
[1:18:37] certain that's not the last words that
[1:18:40] Boaz spoke to her. But in the scripture,
[1:18:43] it is the typing of the redemption work.
[1:18:48] And and and Boaz does not speak to her
[1:18:52] or in in the record of the Bible. I'm
[1:18:54] speaking in the record after he took her
[1:18:57] to wife. From there it's silence.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; And it is the coming Christ is coming
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; from uh from the redemptive work which
[1:19:10] is being reflected in Boaz to the king.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Revelation the fifth chapter is going
[1:19:19] that's why it's a closed book in
[1:19:20] revelation five. It's going from the
[1:19:23] redemption, he's redeeming you, me. He's
[1:19:28] also obtaining himself a wife. There's a
[1:19:31] transition. And through the bride of
[1:19:34] Jesus Christ because that's the
[1:19:36] conclusion of his his act as the
[1:19:39] redeemer. And then he comes now on the
[1:19:42] scene as king.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; And he goes to the Jews as king. So we
[1:19:47] are living in if you believe the
[1:19:49] scripture and believe what the prophet
[1:19:51] has said we are in a transition period
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; and where we are in the transition
[1:19:57] period we do not know alto together but
[1:20:00] I can tell you there will be a time
[1:20:02] it'll be the last service preached as
[1:20:05] far as this message is concerned but
[1:20:07] will not be the last service they will
[1:20:09] continue on having services continuing
[1:20:12] on having altar calls continuing on
[1:20:14] singing and choir such as we had Today
[1:20:17] we'll all they'll all be we won't I
[1:20:20] trust we won't I'm saying that in faith
[1:20:22] but they'll still go on worshiping and
[1:20:24] still go on and the prophet said
[1:20:26] thinking they're getting saved.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; So that is that is after that's way far
[1:20:31] in the transition period and and you
[1:20:35] have to understand we are not going to
[1:20:38] have the Jesus that is so much uh put
[1:20:43] forward in the religious world. I think
[1:20:46] the religious world has missed the mark
[1:20:48] completely
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; and they missed it certainly when they
[1:20:51] turned down the very messenger God sent
[1:20:54] to them.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; So it's a transition period and uh and
[1:21:04] there's good reason why God is silent
[1:21:06] about it. Now you know some marvelous
[1:21:09] things take place. When I said that
[1:21:12] there's silence, it doesn't mean that
[1:21:14] nothing's happening. Now, I hope you
[1:21:17] understand
[1:21:20] uh
[1:21:21] you mothers that have had children and
[1:21:25] you mothers and fathers when your wife
[1:21:29] has got that little
[1:21:32] infant within her and they'll go down to
[1:21:36] the hospital
[1:21:38] and with the technology they have today,
[1:21:42] they can put headphones on you. And I I
[1:21:45] had never experienced it before until it
[1:21:48] was uh with uh brother Marco and Sharon.
[1:21:53] And Sharon has these three children
[1:21:56] within her. And we went down to
[1:21:59] children's hospital. They put headphones
[1:22:00] on us. And here are these little
[1:22:03] creatures.
[1:22:05] It just so incredible.
[1:22:08] And they put and they put the move the
[1:22:11] instrument over one and they know
[1:22:13] exactly where to move it. They're
[1:22:15] watching the monitor and move it over
[1:22:16] the other and I'm hearing kath
[1:22:22] and I can scarcely believe that that
[1:22:24] little thing can make that much noise.
[1:22:27] But soon as I take the headphones off
[1:22:28] it's total silence.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; But something's happening.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Something's actually happening.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; And there is and and then there's the
[1:22:37] next one. and they measure exactly the
[1:22:39] amount and the intensity of it and the
[1:22:42] frequency of it and everything else. You
[1:22:44] talk about things going on.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; So you might think in the kingdom of
[1:22:49] God, well, we're going to church and
[1:22:51] we're here in Bible way and we're going
[1:22:53] to have a preach or we're going to have
[1:22:55] someone preach and so on so forth. Let
[1:22:56] me tell you something, friends. In the
[1:22:58] realm, there's a whole lot more going on
[1:23:01] than what you're hearing.
[1:23:04] It might just be a kathump kathump
[1:23:05] kathump to you, but something's forming.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Something's happening.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; And he's going from redemption from
[1:23:11] redeemer to king.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you, though we may fail
[1:23:16] in a lot of areas, that will never fail.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; He's gone. He's on his way. That's why
[1:23:22] the messenger came. He sent this
[1:23:24] messenger to announce to you
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; that he's going from redeemer to king.
[1:23:30] Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:38] Well, that's kind of a start where I
[1:23:40] feel to feel to perhaps go.
[1:23:44] So, I'm interested in what the lamb says
[1:23:46] and I will perhaps speak a little bit
[1:23:48] more about that uh uh this morning in
[1:23:52] this final message.
[1:23:55] So now Boaz as the kinsman redeemer of
[1:23:59] no Naomi got Ruth uh as a gentile bride.
[1:24:04] Now to some of you this is very very
[1:24:05] elementary but then there's uh uh
[1:24:09] perhaps people who have heard it for the
[1:24:12] first time or people on the internet
[1:24:14] that are streaming or young people that
[1:24:17] are are hearing it maybe at a time now
[1:24:21] that means more to them.
[1:24:24] Now, brother Ben Brandham said about
[1:24:26] this uh book, he said it's the abstract
[1:24:30] title deed to eternal life
[1:24:33] and your name and all that your name
[1:24:36] represents
[1:24:38] was in that book. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; The record of life by your natural birth
[1:24:45] because that is the book of life
[1:24:48] and which what it signifies
[1:24:51] and this him taking the book signifies
[1:24:54] the removal of all that you inherited by
[1:24:57] your natural birth.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Now in the invisible union you've heard
[1:25:01] this before and just please I'm not
[1:25:04] going to say forgive me but I I'm I'm
[1:25:07] going to say I feel inspired. I'm not
[1:25:09] speaking from notes of Wednesday or from
[1:25:11] notes of last Sunday or previous notes.
[1:25:13] I go all pouring over it and prayerfully
[1:25:17] what God would have for this meeting for
[1:25:20] this time
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; and for those of you that are here. So
[1:25:24] he said now your old book and you want
[1:25:27] to say my old book
[1:25:31] is gone with your old union. Thank God
[1:25:34] we had an old union that's gone.
[1:25:38] and your name has been transferred. And
[1:25:41] I say, "Thank God our name has been
[1:25:45] transferred." He said, "Do you mean to
[1:25:47] tell me that my old book?" And he breaks
[1:25:50] it. He said, "God put it in the sea of
[1:25:52] his forgetfulness." And I want to say,
[1:25:55] "Praise be to God." That there's a part
[1:25:58] of our life and he knew exactly what to
[1:26:01] put in the sea of his forgetfulness. And
[1:26:03] if you want to hang on to it, that's up
[1:26:05] to you. But I would say that's your
[1:26:07] worst mistake.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; We I'm thank people. What's the sea of
[1:26:11] God's forgetfulness? Quite frankly, I
[1:26:13] don't care
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; as long as he says it's in the sea of
[1:26:16] his forgetfulness. That's what's
[1:26:18] important to us today.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; It's in the sea of his forgetfulness and
[1:26:22] you stand perfectly before God. I'm glad
[1:26:25] it's not just a preacher saying that.
[1:26:28] I'm glad it's someone who declared the
[1:26:31] power of God, the pillar of fire in
[1:26:34] attendance with it. I like to have the
[1:26:36] supernatural in attendance, knowing that
[1:26:39] the supernatural was with him and he
[1:26:41] could say, "You stand perfectly before
[1:26:43] God." That does something for us.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Your name is now in the new book, not
[1:26:50] the book of life,
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; but the lamb's book of life. And that is
[1:26:54] why he said also this is the most
[1:26:57] sublime act the most sublime act that
[1:27:02] your sins and everything you inherited
[1:27:06] all the weaknesses frailties and
[1:27:08] idiosyncrasies and complexes and
[1:27:11] everything that you inherited all the
[1:27:14] iniquity knowing and he said knowing to
[1:27:17] do right and not to do it all iniquity.
[1:27:20] The fact that he could take that and
[1:27:23] remove that and put it in the sea of
[1:27:25] your his for his forgetfulness to me
[1:27:28] that is remarkable and that has to be
[1:27:31] the most sublime act. Not the book of
[1:27:33] life but the lamb's book of life. What
[1:27:36] the lamb redeemed not the old book of
[1:27:38] your old your natural union but your new
[1:27:43] bride. Hallelujah. Your new life is in
[1:27:47] the lamb's book of life. your marriage
[1:27:50] certificate.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Where your true
[1:27:56] eternal germ from the beginning takes
[1:27:59] hold."
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Not your natural germ that was in your
[1:28:02] forefathers, but your true eternal germ.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; I'm claiming that.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; I'm claiming that everything that we
[1:28:11] look at, we see ourselves uh you know in
[1:28:14] as humans. We see ourselves as humans.
[1:28:17] We all have our weaknesses and frailties
[1:28:21] and whatever more. But I'm so thankful
[1:28:24] whether we see the whether we see the
[1:28:27] evidence and the full evidence. We say,
[1:28:29] "Well, I'm I'm saved. You know, I quit
[1:28:32] drinking or quit smoking and quit this
[1:28:33] and quit that and all the rest of it."
[1:28:36] There's a lot of good people in the
[1:28:37] world. There's a lot of people that
[1:28:39] don't do those things. And that's not
[1:28:41] the evidence we're looking for. We're
[1:28:43] looking for a life that lives above
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; the life of this world
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; and that is our possession. He said in
[1:28:54] the breach, excuse me, please. The
[1:28:57] abstract title deed to eternal life
[1:28:59] means it it your life is searched all
[1:29:04] the way back to its beginning.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; And it didn't begin with Adam.
[1:29:10] It began with our heavenly parent,
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; our father which are in heaven.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And when sin has been confessed, he said
[1:29:22] it searched all the way back. And when
[1:29:23] sin has been confessed and fallen into
[1:29:26] the blood of Jesus Christ, it gives an
[1:29:29] abstract right straight back to the
[1:29:32] creator again.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; That's where it went back to
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; to the creator. What was in the
[1:29:40] creator's mind when he saw on down in
[1:29:43] centuries? You say, "Well, it's a long
[1:29:45] time." No, it's not a long time. To God,
[1:29:47] a thousand years as a day, and even with
[1:29:50] with God, there is no time. He's
[1:29:53] eternal. There's no beginning. There's
[1:29:55] no end with God. You maybe can't grasp
[1:29:59] that, but that is the truth. I can't
[1:30:01] grasp that. There's no beginning or end
[1:30:04] with God. And so God,
[1:30:07] your life has come straight back to him.
[1:30:10] You, he is the, he's the author of your
[1:30:13] life. And what he intended for you and I
[1:30:17] is not the life that we have here now.
[1:30:20] That's why he's going to destroy the
[1:30:21] enemy. He's going to take every sin that
[1:30:25] is imposed upon his children. And the
[1:30:28] prophet said he's going to nail that
[1:30:30] right back on the author of sin, who
[1:30:33] Satan himself You say, "Well, do you
[1:30:35] want to sin?" No, I don't want to sin. I
[1:30:38] don't want to have unbelief. I don't
[1:30:40] want these things. If you were asked,
[1:30:42] "Do you want to go uh and and live on
[1:30:45] earth? Do you want to fight your way? Do
[1:30:47] you want to battle your way through life
[1:30:50] and all of its burdens and all of its
[1:30:52] things and and and you want to struggle
[1:30:54] with the flesh?" You'd say, "No,
[1:30:56] preserve me from that. I don't want
[1:30:58] that." But he didn't ask you about that.
[1:31:01] God sent you here in the midst of the
[1:31:04] even now. God sent you here in this
[1:31:06] Leodysian age in this very vile, dark,
[1:31:11] wicked age. He sent you here, but he
[1:31:14] didn't send you here and then leave you
[1:31:16] powerless. And I'm going to be coming to
[1:31:18] it. He gave us power
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; to live in this life
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; and to be victorious.
[1:31:24] and the things that we fail in and the
[1:31:27] things that Satan imposes upon us. God
[1:31:31] knows that and that he's not your enemy
[1:31:34] only. He's God's enemy.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; And God's going to take his enemy and
[1:31:39] the thing that his enemy did to his
[1:31:41] children and he's going to make him
[1:31:43] responsible for the whole thing.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Now, you need to accept that.
[1:31:52] Now, there's three different species
[1:31:54] around the throne. We read Revelation 5.
[1:31:58] There's three different species. That is
[1:32:00] a quote out of the Revelation series.
[1:32:04] And the first at this throne is four
[1:32:06] living creatures.
[1:32:09] Outside of that is 24 elders sitting on
[1:32:12] their thrones.
[1:32:14] And around this this great host of
[1:32:17] angels around the throne.
[1:32:20] He said there everyone different one
[1:32:23] from the other there is angels,
[1:32:26] elders and living creatures. Now for for
[1:32:31] you that are accustomed to studies and
[1:32:34] as accustomed to studying and your
[1:32:37] school of halls of learning and so on,
[1:32:39] there's three species around this throne
[1:32:43] and and and now this scene is very very
[1:32:46] important to you because you're
[1:32:48] involved.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; You are very much involved. This
[1:32:52] happened God didn't do this for himself.
[1:32:54] He did this for you. Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; So these and in the in the book of
[1:33:02] revelation which is a book of symbols.
[1:33:04] It's filled with symbols. There are two
[1:33:08] uh there are there is the word which in
[1:33:12] the English is beasts and you'll find it
[1:33:14] several times. There's four beasts and
[1:33:17] then it'll say beasts. And there's two
[1:33:20] different words in the Greek for beasts.
[1:33:23] And one is like a wild animal,
[1:33:26] untameable.
[1:33:27] You cannot tame it. It's a wild beast
[1:33:30] and it always represents the evil part.
[1:33:33] The other is zoo. Z O N or Z O N which
[1:33:38] is a living creature. And that always is
[1:33:41] on the on the on the sight of God. So
[1:33:46] and and the reason why the word beast is
[1:33:49] used is because the beast in the
[1:33:50] scripture always represents power.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; So it's a power whether God gives you
[1:33:56] power.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Or it's a power whether Satan exercises
[1:34:00] power.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; So one is a power of darkness and the
[1:34:03] other is the power of light.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. ones of power. And as
[1:34:07] civilization has moved all through the
[1:34:10] centuries, Satan has through
[1:34:12] civilization and developing up to
[1:34:15] Satan's Eden, he has moved in with all
[1:34:18] kinds of uh uh, you know, been waves of
[1:34:21] of change and things that have happened
[1:34:24] all through, you know, we've had uh
[1:34:27] we've had this kind of revolution and
[1:34:30] this kind of war and struggles and all
[1:34:33] of these things. And don't say they
[1:34:34] aren't powers. They are powers,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; but they're evil powers
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; because they brought slavery and
[1:34:42] calamity and bondage and all kinds of
[1:34:45] hideous things happening right now while
[1:34:47] you're sitting here peacefully. There's
[1:34:49] people rioting by the tens of thousands
[1:34:52] and hundreds of thousands because
[1:34:53] they're wanting to achieve freedom or
[1:34:56] democracy or something. Sure.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; And there was uh you know the time of
[1:35:01] the Renaissance and then we've had the
[1:35:03] time of the Inquisition and multitudes
[1:35:06] and here we have uh uh Second World War.
[1:35:10] Many of you have, you know, you've read
[1:35:12] about it. Some of you have perhaps lived
[1:35:14] through it. I understand and this is uh
[1:35:18] I understand by by the
[1:35:21] uh not scientific but the actual
[1:35:23] statistics that there was 54 million
[1:35:27] almost the double population of of
[1:35:30] Canada
[1:35:32] 54 million perished in that war.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible?
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; And what did it achieve? Well,
[1:35:40] industrialization.
[1:35:42] But what did it really achieve? 54
[1:35:45] million people, folks.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; That's almost in Well, it is. It's
[1:35:51] incomprehensible.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; And these are powers. And the prophet
[1:35:58] said it was a birth pain.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; But these are powers that have been
[1:36:02] imposed upon humanity
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; and incredible things have taken place.
[1:36:08] And then the dark ages over a thousand
[1:36:11] years. You know, I think it would wake
[1:36:13] us up if we just each one were pitched
[1:36:16] into the dark ages for about a week.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; We'd know what we're talking about, what
[1:36:21] the preacher is talking about this
[1:36:23] morning. If you just had one week in the
[1:36:25] dark ages, you'd come here this morning
[1:36:28] alert.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; You'd say, "Ah, thank God I'm free of
[1:36:32] the dark ages."
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; If you just had one week of it. And
[1:36:36] during the dark ages and now the prophet
[1:36:40] of God and and we know clearly that it
[1:36:43] was a great move of Satan to always
[1:36:48] remember one thing. Satan has an enemy
[1:36:50] too. And his enemy is God.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; And he's against
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; everything that's righteous and holy.
[1:36:57] And he's he's trying to stamp it out,
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; trying to make it difficult for people.
[1:37:03] You might think, "Oh, I don't want to be
[1:37:05] in the dark ages." Let me tell you
[1:37:07] something. You're in a more difficult
[1:37:10] age.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; You're going to try to That didn't work.
[1:37:16] So, he's going to work something else.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; He's going to work ease.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Make it so pleasant.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Anything that your flesh wants,
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; he'll have a new food on the market.
[1:37:30] He'll have a new something. He'll have a
[1:37:32] new toy. He'll have something. And he'll
[1:37:35] just keep you on the treadmill because,
[1:37:38] you know, I got to get this and I got to
[1:37:40] get that. And for some, for some it's
[1:37:42] money, and for some it's education, and
[1:37:46] for some it's uh, you know, pleasure.
[1:37:48] And for some, it's something else. But
[1:37:50] he's got the whole the whole world as it
[1:37:54] were, gripped by that uh uh spirit of
[1:37:58] this age. And the prophet said that this
[1:38:02] age spiritually is and the and the Lord
[1:38:06] Jesus spoke of it wretched,
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; naked,
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; blind,
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; and don't know it.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; So they're deceived. What can be worse
[1:38:15] than that?
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; And here God, he's not going to leave
[1:38:20] his chosen or his elect. And if we are
[1:38:23] that, I pray by his grace we are. He's
[1:38:25] not going to leave us here powerless.
[1:38:28] He's not going to leave us here blind.
[1:38:30] He's going to give us insight
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; so you can see it.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Are we making some headway?
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; So the four living creatures, he said
[1:38:42] the different definitions of these
[1:38:44] beasts here looking back into the
[1:38:46] original one is the animal in the Greek
[1:38:49] and like wild animals and this other one
[1:38:52] is living creatures. So now a beast
[1:38:55] represents power as I said a few moments
[1:38:57] ago
[1:38:59] and down through time which I just
[1:39:02] reiterated. Now I'd like to read what he
[1:39:05] says in the sixth seal. He said we find
[1:39:07] those beasts. Now he refers to the
[1:39:10] there's four horse riders and the first
[1:39:14] came out on a uh a red horse I believe
[1:39:18] then a black horse and a pale horse. We
[1:39:21] have the uh uh we have four horse riders
[1:39:25] and he calls them and the Bible calls
[1:39:27] them beasts. We find those beasts or
[1:39:28] horse riders how they rode each one. One
[1:39:32] sent out on his ministry in political
[1:39:36] powers
[1:39:38] uniting religious powers and political
[1:39:41] powers together.
[1:39:43] And in case you think that that is just
[1:39:45] something that we slide over lightly,
[1:39:48] there are untold
[1:39:51] hundreds of millions of people in
[1:39:54] various religions. And if they do not
[1:39:57] believe in Jesus Christ and the
[1:40:00] sacrifice of Christ, that religion has
[1:40:03] deceived them.
[1:40:05] [Music]
[1:40:11] political powers uniting religious
[1:40:14] powers and political powers together. He
[1:40:18] says, "And we find out, we find out God
[1:40:21] sent his power to combat it."
[1:40:25] Hallelujah.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Now, we're in kind of a study, and I'm
[1:40:33] not going to be uh concerned about your
[1:40:36] response, but I I want I I pray that
[1:40:40] you'll really let this anchor down very
[1:40:42] deep. And do not put this is not
[1:40:44] history. This is present tense.
[1:40:50] And these things are active in your
[1:40:52] world with your friends, your family,
[1:40:57] and perhaps some that are even here or
[1:40:59] those listening to the voice. And and
[1:41:02] for those of you, it might surprise you.
[1:41:04] There are hundreds and hundreds and
[1:41:06] hundreds of people that see these
[1:41:09] services, some live. And within within
[1:41:13] one week of the archive, there's
[1:41:16] probably at least another 300 locations
[1:41:20] that will hear this in the next week.
[1:41:22] And within two weeks up around maybe
[1:41:24] around 400 plus locations that are
[1:41:27] hearing this service and and it's not
[1:41:30] imposed on anybody. If they want to hear
[1:41:32] it, fine. But it goes to show there are
[1:41:34] people who are hungry. And I get emails
[1:41:37] I get emails from maybe Central America
[1:41:41] or one from Europe or or wherever more
[1:41:44] and uh and we're just happy if we can be
[1:41:47] a blessing to them. So we say God bless
[1:41:49] them.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; But there are people that are hungry.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; And he said we find these beasts or
[1:41:57] these horse riders. They rode out each
[1:41:59] time and they increased friends. They
[1:42:03] increased the last horse rider which was
[1:42:06] a pale horse rider is it and it's death
[1:42:10] the rider is death.
[1:42:14] We live in a very crucial time
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; and we need to preach and preach as as
[1:42:22] straight and as honest and be as sincere
[1:42:25] as possible because we are seeking to
[1:42:28] save people from this present evil age.
[1:42:32] Amen.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; And then he says about from this phrase,
[1:42:39] we find out God sent out his power to
[1:42:42] combat that. I'm saying this to you
[1:42:45] today because I'm well aware there's
[1:42:49] some that have received this power and
[1:42:55] some have not received this power. I say
[1:42:58] to you sincerely, if you have not
[1:43:01] received it, you will not survive
[1:43:03] spiritually.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; You must be endued with what God sent to
[1:43:09] combat the age or you'll never combat
[1:43:12] it.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Impossible.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; You cannot combat it with your own
[1:43:20] thoughts or your own works or your own
[1:43:22] reasoning or this is the way I see it.
[1:43:24] I'm not interested in how anybody sees
[1:43:26] it. I'm interested in what a vindicated
[1:43:30] messenger said about it.
[1:43:32] [Music]
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; I address you young men say, "Well, I'm
[1:43:37] young and I that doesn't mean anything."
[1:43:40] Young men fall just as harder harder
[1:43:42] than someone else.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Young ladies, I'm I'm I'm, you know,
[1:43:46] I've got my youth. I've got my beauty.
[1:43:48] I've got this. I've got that. I've got
[1:43:50] my education. Doesn't mean anything.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; You'll fall just as hard and maybe
[1:43:55] harder.
[1:43:57] because you'll end up wounded and end
[1:43:59] up, you know, in whatever you do, take
[1:44:03] the heed of the Holy Spirit.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Take the call of God now.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; And if you have any question that you
[1:44:11] have received this power to combat the
[1:44:14] age, you'll just be sucked in. And you
[1:44:16] say, "Well, I don't feel it. I don't
[1:44:18] sense it." Do you know why? The spirit
[1:44:20] of this age is deception.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; You're not going to feel it. you maybe
[1:44:25] won't even awaken to it. You'll just be
[1:44:28] lulled on down through this generation
[1:44:31] say everything's a-ok. Okay, that's what
[1:44:33] they thought. We're rich and we're
[1:44:35] increased with goods and I've got this
[1:44:37] and we've got our friends and we've got
[1:44:39] our fellowship. We've got our church and
[1:44:42] that's all you need.
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; But he said
[1:44:50] we find out that God sent out his power
[1:44:53] to combat it. Why do I repeat this? I'm
[1:44:55] repeating it because you need it.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; I need it. And then he asked this. How
[1:45:01] could man do anything else besides the
[1:45:04] power of God that had been released to
[1:45:08] them?
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, I wept
[1:45:11] when I begin to read that
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; because I too was young.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; I was the age of these young men. And
[1:45:20] all through even through the teens, I
[1:45:22] remember same devil
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; back then as there is now.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; And I I recall, you know, why don't you
[1:45:29] do this? And I'd say, yeah, why don't I
[1:45:32] do that?
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; And then I'd ask myself, well, you know
[1:45:35] what? I really don't I'm really not
[1:45:37] interested.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Somehow it's just not in me.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; I I'm not interested in that. But I had
[1:45:44] other interests. And what is it? How can
[1:45:48] you do anything else
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; than that which the spirit of God has
[1:45:52] put on you or pushing you in that
[1:45:55] direction?
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; And oh, how I thank God.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it doesn't just come, you
[1:46:02] know, on a on a golden platter. But if I
[1:46:04] were you and I would persuade anybody
[1:46:06] here today under the sound of my voice
[1:46:09] that you become urgent with it and you
[1:46:12] become sincere with it. Say, "Oh God, I
[1:46:15] give myself. Release that power upon me.
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; How can they do anything else besides
[1:46:25] the power of God that had been released
[1:46:27] to them?" And I said, "How can we do
[1:46:29] anything else then? Uh than besides the
[1:46:32] power of God that has been released to
[1:46:34] us."
[1:46:36] In the fifth seal, he spoke about the
[1:46:37] martyrs down through the ages who
[1:46:40] suffered terribly.
[1:46:42] We could speak about them
[1:46:45] and I have read and it's it's just so
[1:46:50] brutal. It's just incredible.
[1:46:53] He said how how they they suffered
[1:46:55] terribly. But what were they? He asked
[1:46:58] the question. He said they were under
[1:47:01] the inspiration of the spirit of God.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; And I say we don't need it any less in
[1:47:06] this day.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; They went to the They went to the stake
[1:47:10] and were burned. They went to the wild
[1:47:12] beast and were torn aunder. They they
[1:47:15] suffered all kinds of hideous things and
[1:47:18] we don't have that. But the soft age
[1:47:20] that we're in can be even more deceptive
[1:47:23] than that age.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; That age was either bend or be broken.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Deny it or die.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; And it was a clear-cut decision. And
[1:47:33] sometimes that would be easier
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; if somebody came in here today and said,
[1:47:38] "You deny this message. Deny this
[1:47:40] gospel, deny this Christ, or I'm going
[1:47:43] to shoot you. I'd say fire away.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Fire away.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; I have no fear of that whatsoever.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; But this age that you're in, this age is
[1:47:56] a subtle age. This age is a serpent age.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Really, a serpent age. He's just working
[1:48:04] it and and and weaving his way through
[1:48:06] every part of society. every part is
[1:48:09] hardly a clean thing.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; You can't look at a newspaper because
[1:48:14] there's segments of it that's unclean.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe you just want to get the news.
[1:48:19] There's no such a thing as just getting
[1:48:21] the news
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; because they've got everything. It's
[1:48:24] it's it's a merge. It's homogenized. So,
[1:48:26] you can't separate it.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; It's a wicked age.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; You go to your school or you go to your
[1:48:35] entertainment or you go to your sports.
[1:48:37] What some of the sports there's there's
[1:48:39] nothing sinful with the sport, but it
[1:48:41] becomes sinful
[1:48:42] [Applause]
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; down through the ages. It says they were
[1:48:49] under the inspiration of the spirit of
[1:48:51] God, the power. And don't forget this
[1:48:55] church. It's not me saying it. He said
[1:48:58] it. I want to say to you, listen to him.
[1:49:01] Just let me echo the prophet's words for
[1:49:03] a moment. And don't forget this church
[1:49:06] and you brethren on tape. I want you to
[1:49:09] examine this. How could man do anything
[1:49:13] else besides the power of God that had
[1:49:17] been released had been released upon
[1:49:19] them? And this message, friends, is not
[1:49:22] word only, but it is actually a power.
[1:49:26] And that's what I've been seeking to
[1:49:28] preach to you and bring to you that
[1:49:30] there's an essence
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; within the word, within the message,
[1:49:34] within the letter, reading between the
[1:49:36] lines, getting something more than just
[1:49:39] the face value of it.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; There is a power.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; I'm a married man. I'm glad it's not
[1:49:49] just a certificate on the wall. I'm glad
[1:49:52] there's something that sustains us when
[1:49:55] things get rough
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; and things will get rough.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; I'm glad as a church and as a body of
[1:50:02] people. Let me tell you friends, I don't
[1:50:04] care what you see or what you hear. The
[1:50:07] bride of Jesus Christ is the chosen
[1:50:10] elected bloodbought
[1:50:12] body of Jesus Christ wherever they are.
[1:50:16] And it's not my choosing. It's his
[1:50:18] choosing. He's already done it.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; And I accept that.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; I love that. He loves it. I love it.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; These four living creatures are
[1:50:35] protectors.
[1:50:37] And you never get this, never get this
[1:50:41] outside of a prophet.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Never get it. And watch now clearly. And
[1:50:47] after you know
[1:50:49] person does some uh does some study and
[1:50:53] does some prayer and so on so forth and
[1:50:56] over the years
[1:50:58] but in the revelation series
[1:51:02] he goes back and he says now I'm going
[1:51:04] right to Genesis
[1:51:06] excuse me when Adam sinned and he drove
[1:51:09] out the man and he placed at the east of
[1:51:11] the garden of Eden cherubams
[1:51:14] and a flaming sword which turned every
[1:51:17] way. See the four beasts. There's only
[1:51:21] four ways you can go. East, north, west,
[1:51:24] and south. These cherubams had a flaming
[1:51:28] sword at the gate of the garden to keep
[1:51:30] the way of the tree of life.
[1:51:34] Soon as they had fallen, there was
[1:51:37] protectors to keep not just the tree of
[1:51:40] life, but the way of the tree of life.
[1:51:43] Adam lost his way. Didn't know how to do
[1:51:47] things. Didn't know how to achieve.
[1:51:50] Didn't know how to order his sunship.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; You can have the most talented person,
[1:51:56] but perhaps they won't know what to do.
[1:51:59] You can give someone uh uh some people,
[1:52:04] I guess they win the lottery or
[1:52:06] something, and I often think, do they
[1:52:08] know what to do with it? Uh some people
[1:52:11] are gifted gifted people but they don't
[1:52:14] know exactly what to do with their gift
[1:52:16] and uh uh so now Adam lost his sunship
[1:52:21] and he says the four beasts they turned
[1:52:23] every way or the four these were
[1:52:26] cherubams
[1:52:28] then uh I have a I have a slide here if
[1:52:33] we can I'd like to show slide 10 if I
[1:52:35] could Please.
[1:52:40] This is the
[1:52:44] This is the tabernacle
[1:52:47] in the middle.
[1:52:51] And we could spend some time on it, but
[1:52:52] we won't. The outer court, the inner
[1:52:55] court, and then the holy of holies and
[1:52:57] the pillar of fire over it. But the but
[1:53:00] the 12 But the children of Israel are
[1:53:03] divided into 12 tribes.
[1:53:07] And there are
[1:53:10] uh
[1:53:11] on on each side they're divided. And I
[1:53:14] have the I have the names here.
[1:53:17] Said you'll notice Dan is the head of
[1:53:19] three tribes. Jude is the head of three
[1:53:21] tribes. Reuben is the head of three
[1:53:23] tribes. And Ephraim is the head of three
[1:53:25] tribes.
[1:53:27] Has 12 tribes of Israel. See each one of
[1:53:30] their banner. Now, they had each one of
[1:53:33] those those tribes, the head of each
[1:53:38] tribe had a banner.
[1:53:41] And the banner of Judah was a lion. The
[1:53:44] banner of Reuben was man, the banner of
[1:53:47] Ephraim, an ox, and the banner of Dan
[1:53:52] was an eagle. And that's exactly the
[1:53:54] tribes of Israel camped around guarding
[1:53:58] this earthly guards of the right to the
[1:54:02] ark.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; This is the ark and these tribes are
[1:54:06] around it. God is representing that he's
[1:54:09] always now we've moved all the way from
[1:54:11] Eden where there's flaming cherubams
[1:54:14] protecting the way of the tree of life
[1:54:16] which was the word. And now God has
[1:54:19] chosen one man. We don't understand that
[1:54:23] God chose one man, Abram and changed his
[1:54:26] name to Abraham. Says, "I'm going to
[1:54:28] give you a son and out from him came the
[1:54:31] patriarchs and out from him came this
[1:54:34] lineage right here." And then and he
[1:54:37] gives he gives the commandments on a
[1:54:40] tablet of stone and that's in the Holy
[1:54:42] of Holies in an ark. And there's the
[1:54:45] mercy seat.
[1:54:47] And there's the little ark, which is
[1:54:49] just a little box. And the tablets of
[1:54:51] stone are there. And that's written by
[1:54:53] the finger of God. And these tribes,
[1:54:56] what God is showing all down through
[1:54:59] this and just it's so beautiful. He's
[1:55:02] showing that the word will always be
[1:55:05] protected.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; The purity will always be protected.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; The power of it will always be
[1:55:12] protected. Amen.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; And then that word, the Bible says the
[1:55:19] word became flesh.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; He's not satisfied just to have it in in
[1:55:24] tablets of stone. He wants to write it
[1:55:27] and he's determined to write it in the
[1:55:30] very fleshly tablets of the heart of his
[1:55:33] people that he will call every age.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; All right, you can take that off just
[1:55:39] for now.
[1:55:42] And finally, here comes Jesus Christ,
[1:55:44] the word in flesh. And God surrounds him
[1:55:49] with the record of Matthew, Mark, Luke,
[1:55:54] and John.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; And Matthew takes, you've heard me say
[1:55:59] it here before, but Matthew takes the
[1:56:01] record and the lineage of Jesus in his
[1:56:04] kingly
[1:56:06] line.
[1:56:08] Jesus Christ, the generation of Jesus
[1:56:11] Christ, the son of Abraham, the son of
[1:56:13] David. That's his kingly line. And that
[1:56:16] was because he was anointed.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; He was un he was under the power and the
[1:56:21] influence to write of him as king.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; So that was lying.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; You read to you read into Mark. Listen,
[1:56:31] you know, he starts out even Luke starts
[1:56:33] different. But you read Mark,
[1:56:37] the beginning of the gospel of Jesus
[1:56:38] Christ, the son, as it is written in the
[1:56:40] prophets, behold, I send my messenger,
[1:56:42] starts right off
[1:56:45] in in service and labor and ministry.
[1:56:48] Because Mark was anointed with the
[1:56:51] sacrifice and the ox,
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; the labor.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Luke, some say he was Luke the
[1:56:57] physician. I do not know. But he takes
[1:57:00] the lineage of Jesus Christ through the
[1:57:02] human lineage because he's anointed with
[1:57:06] the man, the spirit of the man. And
[1:57:09] John, he is the spirit of the eagle
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; in the beginning.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; In the beginning
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; was the word and the word was with God.
[1:57:20] He goes way back, not when, you know,
[1:57:22] this lineage started or this lineage
[1:57:25] started or his service on earth. He goes
[1:57:27] back to the beginning. In the beginning
[1:57:30] was the word and the word was with God
[1:57:32] and the word was God.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John protectors
[1:57:42] of the word. The life coming into the
[1:57:44] church at Pentecost. And they were the
[1:57:47] protectors as it were of what was to
[1:57:50] take place in the book of Acts. in the
[1:57:53] revelation series again the four gospels
[1:57:55] are the framework to back Pentecost Mark
[1:57:59] Matthew Mark Luke and John he said them
[1:58:02] four guards come and was writing and
[1:58:05] writing everything that they seen coming
[1:58:08] to pass telling it just like it is how
[1:58:11] it is going to happen and what was going
[1:58:14] to take place
[1:58:16] they were the they were the framework
[1:58:19] now in Revelation 4
[1:58:22] 7.
[1:58:24] Maybe you might want to turn to that in
[1:58:26] your Bible rather than just have me read
[1:58:27] it.
[1:58:41] Read verse six.
[1:58:44] This is what John saw in heaven. And
[1:58:46] before the throne there was a sea of
[1:58:48] glass like unto crystal. And in the
[1:58:51] midst of the throne and around about the
[1:58:53] throne were four beasts. There's a four
[1:58:56] living creatures full of eyes before and
[1:58:59] behind. And the first beast was like a
[1:59:02] lion. The second beast like a calf. And
[1:59:05] the third beast had a face of a man. And
[1:59:08] the fourth fourth beast was uh like a
[1:59:12] flying eagle.
[1:59:15] And uh
[1:59:19] in the revelation series he said
[1:59:21] remember God's four guards of the ark or
[1:59:24] the mercy seat. John saw how many? Four.
[1:59:28] He seen four. Four living creatures. And
[1:59:32] four is the number of the earth. Four is
[1:59:36] an earthly number. Now follow this very
[1:59:38] closely please. It's a number of earth.
[1:59:42] A number of deliverance.
[1:59:45] deliverance. He said, "Now keep that in
[1:59:47] your mind." Deliverance. There was three
[1:59:49] Hebrew children in the fiery furnace.
[1:59:53] The but the fourth one come, it was
[1:59:55] deliverance.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Lazarus was in the grave three days, but
[2:00:00] when the fourth one come, he was
[2:00:02] delivered.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Four is God's number of deliverance. So
[2:00:06] it showed that these beings must have
[2:00:09] been something about the earth. In other
[2:00:12] words, they were connected to what was
[2:00:15] happening on earth.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; And now in the in the book of
[2:00:19] Revelation, now as we've read, are you
[2:00:22] with me?
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Just pinch your conscience a moment. Now
[2:00:26] around in the throne is four living
[2:00:29] creatures. Those that's not just
[2:00:31] something symbolic back there. They
[2:00:34] symbolize
[2:00:36] uh anointings. They symbolize powers
[2:00:39] that God has sent. And you're either
[2:00:43] under one of them or not.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; And the one the last one was flying
[2:00:48] eagle.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; The last one is an eagle because the
[2:00:51] fourth is spells deliverance.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; And if there ever was an age that needs
[2:00:57] to be delivered, we need to be delivered
[2:00:59] from the from the sentence of
[2:01:01] corruption.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; We need to be delivered. And the prophet
[2:01:05] comes. Now, here comes a vindicated
[2:01:08] messenger telling us this is the time
[2:01:12] that the Adams will change in human
[2:01:15] bodies. Why is he saying that? Because
[2:01:17] he's he's under the inspiration of the
[2:01:19] fourth power. He's under a prophet
[2:01:22] inspiration speaking to a generation of
[2:01:25] people that God is determined to deliver
[2:01:28] from the grip of death.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; You can either have it
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; or deny it. And you can go to a grave if
[2:01:37] you want. I want a resurrection.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; And the fourth. And now we've gone in
[2:01:44] just a few moments. We've gone all the
[2:01:46] way from Genesis when they're protecting
[2:01:49] the way of the tree of the life. And now
[2:01:51] we have a messenger saying those
[2:01:54] cherubams,
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; those cherubams, you know where I'm
[2:01:57] going.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Those same cherubams. He said, now do
[2:02:01] you believe him?
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Do you believe him? He said they are
[2:02:05] here now
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; driving driving you
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; to the tree of life.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Not keeping you from it but driving you
[2:02:16] to it. I say, "Oh God, let that power
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; grip every soul with under the sound of
[2:02:24] my voice."
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; That's the power to give deliverance
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; from Satan's Eden. deliverance from this
[2:02:32] present evil age.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; And they've been all the way all the
[2:02:37] way. It was back there. You say, "Well,
[2:02:39] oh, I'd love to been back in the days of
[2:02:41] Jesus." That was, and I'm not belittling
[2:02:43] that was simply Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[2:02:46] John. We want to go beyond that.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; We want to go beyond their record.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that we're in this time.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. when we're under another
[2:02:57] inspiration,
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; we're under another power.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; And that power, friends, has been sent
[2:03:03] for you to protect that life that's in
[2:03:05] you. And that's one thing as it was with
[2:03:08] Job. Oh, Job. All the things that Job
[2:03:13] went through and Satan came and says,
[2:03:15] "Yeah, but you're protecting him if you
[2:03:18] just let me get at him." And God gave
[2:03:20] him release. And then finally, he still
[2:03:23] couldn't be broken. Then then Satan came
[2:03:25] back to God and say you let me touch his
[2:03:28] body. A man will give up anything for
[2:03:30] his body. And he and he afflicted him
[2:03:33] and stripped him of everything. Stripped
[2:03:35] him of his respect. Stripped him of his
[2:03:37] position. Stripped him of his wealth.
[2:03:40] Stripped him of his family. And then
[2:03:43] finally with a body full of sores and
[2:03:45] boils and sitting on an ash heap, he
[2:03:48] still wouldn't deny God.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Lord giveth and the Lord
[2:03:53] taketh away. Blessed be the name of the
[2:03:55] Lord. And after he hath tried me, I'll
[2:03:57] come forth as pure gold.
[2:04:00] And his wife tried to get him to deny
[2:04:02] God. And he would not deny God.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God prevented Satan from He
[2:04:08] said, "But you cannot touch his life."
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; And God may God may allow Satan to pull
[2:04:16] you through a knot hole. He may bring
[2:04:19] you through some very difficult times.
[2:04:21] But there's one thing that I can declare
[2:04:24] on the authority of God's holy word. He
[2:04:27] cannot touch your life.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; That gene that came from God is
[2:04:34] protected
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; and there's no power that can get to it.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; We can say yes. There's three Hebrew
[2:04:47] children and the fourth one was
[2:04:48] deliverance. Lazarus was in the grave
[2:04:51] three days and the fourth one was
[2:04:52] deliverance. And we can say and there
[2:04:54] was three p there was three powers sent
[2:04:57] uh all through the 2,000 years of this
[2:04:59] gospel of grace. But when the fourth one
[2:05:01] came, there's deliverance.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to preach it,
[2:05:07] folks. There's deliverance for this
[2:05:09] body.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; There's deliverance for this there's
[2:05:13] deliverance from death.
[2:05:15] It's been spoken. I'm going to continue
[2:05:18] to preach it. There has to be a people
[2:05:20] that will declare it.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; This is what my father has said.
[2:05:28] [Music]
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Listen to the Apostle Paul. We shall not
[2:05:32] all sleep.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; There's somebody that's not going to
[2:05:36] sleep.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; I would like you to be able to claim
[2:05:39] that for yourself.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; I'm still claiming it. We shall not all
[2:05:45] sleep, but we shall all be changed
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; at the last trump.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; We're not going to coast our way into
[2:05:56] that. We're going to fight our way into
[2:05:58] it.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; But the power has been released. And we
[2:06:02] say, I say with the prophet's words,
[2:06:05] what can we do? How can we do anything
[2:06:07] else?
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; That's been what's been released on us.
[2:06:17] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:06:35] Once again in the fifth seal,
[2:06:38] brother Brent makes a reference to
[2:06:40] Apostle Paul
[2:06:42] and he said, "I know that after my
[2:06:44] departing that wolves are coming to
[2:06:47] enter in among you, brethren, teaching
[2:06:50] perverse things and it'll it'll draw you
[2:06:53] away." And the scripture, the actual
[2:06:56] scripture, for I know this that after my
[2:06:58] departing shall grievous wolves enter in
[2:07:02] among you and not sparing the flock. He
[2:07:06] said, "Look at that stern little old
[2:07:08] apostle standing there, his his backbeat
[2:07:13] full of stripes, his eyes watering,
[2:07:17] but he could see farther than the
[2:07:19] telescope, claiming out there yonder
[2:07:22] that they can see 120 million light
[2:07:24] years of space, but he could look plum
[2:07:26] into eternity."
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Doesn't that do something for you,
[2:07:32] friends?
[2:07:33] He says, "The martyrs down through the
[2:07:35] ages and they suffered terribly." I'm
[2:07:38] I'm reading it again. And they were
[2:07:40] under the inspiration of the spirit of
[2:07:42] God. I'm saying this because I'm not
[2:07:45] just here to preach a service. I'm
[2:07:47] making a declaration. There's nothing
[2:07:50] that Satan can throw at the bride of
[2:07:52] Jesus Christ, but what she will be
[2:07:54] victorious over it.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is. Hallelujah.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Whether it be suffering, whether he
[2:08:05] tries suffering, or whether he try all
[2:08:07] the pleasures of life and the easy the
[2:08:09] easy road, there'll be something within
[2:08:12] the believer that'll deny it and turn
[2:08:15] away from it.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; And as was sung this morning by the
[2:08:19] choir and the singers, we want to
[2:08:22] surrender all.
[2:08:25] He said if God sends a certain spirit
[2:08:27] among them that's the only thing that
[2:08:29] they can work by is the spirit that
[2:08:32] works among them. He says and now we'll
[2:08:34] prove to you by the history of the
[2:08:37] church and by the opening of the seals
[2:08:39] and the powers that let loose. He said
[2:08:42] and watch exactly the church. Hello
[2:08:46] church. He said, "The church responded
[2:08:50] to the anointing and they couldn't do
[2:08:53] anything else." Saying the same thing,
[2:08:55] but he's saying it another way.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; The church responded.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, church.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; I declare to you the anointing of this
[2:09:06] age has been abundantly poured out.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; And I urge you to respond to it.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Say, "How can I respond to it?" Just
[2:09:15] open your heart and say, "God, pour it
[2:09:18] in.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; God, here I stand and here I am. Pour it
[2:09:22] in.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Pour the strength within me.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Pour the expression of Jesus Christ. I
[2:09:30] want to live this word.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; We cannot do it on our own. Pour it in.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Here I am.
[2:09:42] Amen.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Said, "First was the lion that roared in
[2:09:47] the pure adulterated word." That was the
[2:09:50] first that came in the first age book of
[2:09:55] Acts. And the second was the ox, and
[2:09:57] that was the beast of burden. And it
[2:09:59] also was a sacrificial beast. And they
[2:10:01] willingly walked up there and died.
[2:10:06] You have perhaps read of some. I have
[2:10:08] read of some.
[2:10:10] And some of them are truly
[2:10:13] so gripping that makes a person feel
[2:10:18] that we don't we don't endure anything.
[2:10:22] Harley
[2:10:23] says they didn't care because the spirit
[2:10:26] of the church in that day was sacrifice
[2:10:28] labor and they walked up just as freely
[2:10:32] as they could walk anointed with the
[2:10:35] true spirit of God of that age.
[2:10:39] How many here have heard or read about
[2:10:42] I believe it was five missionaries
[2:10:46] that went down to South America. They
[2:10:49] landed a little plane. It was the Ala
[2:10:51] Indians
[2:10:52] and they were all slain.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; How many have read about that? Heard
[2:10:57] about it? Good number.
[2:10:59] Well, the wife the wife a wife of one of
[2:11:03] those five
[2:11:05] her and her father made a trip to Alaska
[2:11:08] and they stopped in Dawson Creek and she
[2:11:11] spoke in my church
[2:11:13] and told and I spent some time with her.
[2:11:16] It was very very remarkable and since
[2:11:19] then she's become very well known. But I
[2:11:22] spent time with her. But the thing was
[2:11:25] her husband and the others that were
[2:11:27] there, they knew it was very dangerous.
[2:11:29] They knew that their life may be taken,
[2:11:32] but they freely gave themselves to it.
[2:11:37] And they were determined to bring the
[2:11:39] gospel to these men.
[2:11:42] And this woman and another one of the
[2:11:44] wives after their husbands were slain
[2:11:48] right there on the shore on the on the
[2:11:51] sandbar of a river,
[2:11:53] they went back there.
[2:11:56] They went directly back there and gave
[2:11:59] their lives and started getting the
[2:12:02] scripture in their language. And some of
[2:12:05] them got converted and they had they
[2:12:08] have had they've started in a remarkable
[2:12:10] work. Those those women they gave
[2:12:13] themselves because they wanted to they
[2:12:16] they knew that that was the mission that
[2:12:18] their husbands that was their passion.
[2:12:21] That was their entire life and they
[2:12:23] sacrificed their life to reach these
[2:12:25] people that had not heard of the gospel
[2:12:27] of Jesus Christ and they turned around
[2:12:29] and gave themselves for it. and they
[2:12:31] were and they were very much blessed in
[2:12:33] their work.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; That's not, you know, that's not
[2:12:37] centuries ago. That's in recent recent
[2:12:41] time.
[2:12:43] So I'm saying there are still people
[2:12:45] that, you know, give a lot of sacrifice.
[2:12:53] We have quite a few people here at part
[2:12:55] of the church from originally from
[2:12:58] Congo.
[2:13:00] The last two ministers that were martyed
[2:13:05] were martyed in Congo
[2:13:08] and they were two Pentecostal ministers.
[2:13:10] And you know how long ago that was? Just
[2:13:12] 1962.
[2:13:17] I was in Toronto
[2:13:19] and those two men were hacked and and
[2:13:21] and the one was pleading
[2:13:24] the one was pleading nothing against the
[2:13:26] Congalles people. These were these were
[2:13:28] rebels and renegades that were armed.
[2:13:31] And one was pleading, "Take me, not him.
[2:13:35] Please take me, not him." Cuz they were
[2:13:38] just going to take take him. And he he
[2:13:41] was so uh so persistent. So they they
[2:13:45] hacked them both. Both of them died with
[2:13:48] machetes. That was just 1962.
[2:13:51] God has always had and just think of it,
[2:13:53] the seals hadn't even come. There were
[2:13:55] people who were following brother
[2:13:57] Brandham's ministry at that time. But
[2:14:00] since then, since that time, a message
[2:14:04] has broke on the earth, friends. And I'm
[2:14:06] going to speak very very plainly. I'm
[2:14:09] I'm not going to uh shy away from
[2:14:11] anything. When this message struck my
[2:14:15] heart and my soul, I felt first here in
[2:14:20] Cloverdale. I felt
[2:14:23] here's this whole movement called the
[2:14:26] hippie movement,
[2:14:28] flower power, and they found out that
[2:14:30] that movement didn't satisfy.
[2:14:34] They found out it it was a dead end. And
[2:14:37] they had they had they had cast off the
[2:14:42] the
[2:14:43] monetary life of their parents, the life
[2:14:46] of ease of their parents because their
[2:14:47] parents had come out of hardship. And
[2:14:50] now the industrial age had come on and
[2:14:52] they were making money and having buying
[2:14:55] a boat and buying this. And the hippie
[2:14:57] movement came said we don't want that.
[2:14:59] We're we're tired of that. We don't want
[2:15:01] and we're not interested in this
[2:15:03] education. We're not interested in
[2:15:04] authority. We're not interested in law.
[2:15:07] We're not interested. We just want to
[2:15:08] live a happy happy life. Happy hippie
[2:15:11] life. And that came and you know just
[2:15:13] everybody just using uh the next
[2:15:16] person's you know we'll sing in the
[2:15:17] sunshine and we'll laugh every day and
[2:15:19] all of these songs that became popular
[2:15:21] at that time because they didn't want to
[2:15:23] become attached. So we just know
[2:15:25] everybody by their first name and we
[2:15:27] kind of you know eight or 10 all throw
[2:15:29] their funds together and rent a great
[2:15:31] big house and all the rest of it. But
[2:15:34] then I drove down the highway. I'm just
[2:15:36] telling you exactly how things happen. I
[2:15:39] drove down some of these highways and
[2:15:40] I'd see big stones painted on. I saw
[2:15:45] several times and painted in great big
[2:15:48] blazing great big bold letters. Jesus
[2:15:52] help us now. That was like a dart to my
[2:15:55] heart.
[2:15:59] I was doing okay.
[2:16:02] I had a business that God was
[2:16:03] prospering.
[2:16:05] I I could have forgot the world. Then
[2:16:08] I'd say another stone. Jesus, help us
[2:16:11] now.
[2:16:13] And God was telling me, you have the
[2:16:16] answer
[2:16:18] that you got tapes. You've got a
[2:16:20] message. You have an answer.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; And you know that that's what they need.
[2:16:25] And then the rest is all history that we
[2:16:27] opened up the Bible way Cloverdale Bible
[2:16:30] Way house for one purpose to find
[2:16:32] somebody that was out of that whole
[2:16:34] movement and they could live there by
[2:16:36] themselves live there rather as their
[2:16:38] family and and perhaps I see David
[2:16:41] McAdams from the Tri Cities. Brother
[2:16:44] Roger Smith and Emily came I don't know
[2:16:46] if you knew them. They came right from
[2:16:48] that place and they were a couple.
[2:16:50] They'd been the whole they'd gone
[2:16:52] through the whole thing. They've been
[2:16:53] into drugs and the whole works. I said,
[2:16:55] "There's a house here. You can live in
[2:16:58] it." And and and we turned it into a
[2:17:00] boy's house and then a boy's house. And
[2:17:02] then another little place we had and
[2:17:04] that became a boy's house. Another place
[2:17:06] became a girl's house. Another place
[2:17:08] became another boy's house. And I'll
[2:17:10] tell you what, it was a ragged bunch of
[2:17:13] people. But that was the birth.
[2:17:16] And this man here was one that's why he
[2:17:19] tells his testimony. he come in and and
[2:17:23] brother Ken Ardal was another one. I
[2:17:25] won't say that they were in that hippie
[2:17:27] thing, but they were in the probably the
[2:17:29] the kind of the final stages of it, but
[2:17:33] they they knew that, you know, education
[2:17:36] wasn't it. Education's necessary. Get
[2:17:39] all you can,
[2:17:42] have success, have your promotions, earn
[2:17:45] all you can, give all you can. do do
[2:17:48] whatever you can, but it will not
[2:17:50] satisfy that alone.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; And I I just said, you listen to those
[2:17:56] tapes. You get down, get locked into
[2:17:58] those tapes. I want to say to this
[2:18:00] church,
[2:18:02] there might be a lot of people that
[2:18:03] can't give you right advice, but what's
[2:18:06] on those tapes will never turn you away.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; What's on that message will never never
[2:18:12] do you damage.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; I declare to you, it will strengthen
[2:18:16] you.
[2:18:18] You'll get insight you won't get any
[2:18:20] other place.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; And if you just get a hold of that and
[2:18:25] immerse yourself in that and you want to
[2:18:28] say, "Well, you know, it's not real to
[2:18:30] me and I'm I'm I'm this thing hasn't
[2:18:32] been re," you need to get into the right
[2:18:34] source.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; And don't think coming here just Sunday
[2:18:37] and listening to a sermon is the answer.
[2:18:39] You need to hear those messages.
[2:18:43] And once you open your heart to that,
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; you'll be a different person.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; You'll be different person in 6 months.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that was the spirit that
[2:18:56] God released
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; upon this age.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; And I say that without shame, without
[2:19:04] apology, and without hesitation. I would
[2:19:07] urge everybody under the sound of my
[2:19:08] voice. It'll never do you any damage.
[2:19:11] It'll do you good.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; It's the heavenly spirit of almighty God
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; that he poured out. It is your
[2:19:20] protection
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; that is the last of the protectors. And
[2:19:26] that protection that came in this time
[2:19:28] by a prophet voice is also number four
[2:19:32] deliverance.
[2:19:33] [Applause]
[2:19:37] The smartest people we have on earth
[2:19:39] can't figure out the presidents and the
[2:19:42] premers and the kings and whatever they
[2:19:45] are. They can't figure their way out out
[2:19:47] of wallowing in this economic chaos that
[2:19:50] we're in.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; We're going to be in a couple days in in
[2:19:57] in Europe and where they have the the
[2:19:59] euro. They don't even know if the euro
[2:20:01] is a dollar is a monetary uh uh
[2:20:05] instrument is going to exist.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; They want it to.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; America wants it.
[2:20:13] Friends, they can't figure their way out
[2:20:16] of the dilemma. And the biggest dilemma
[2:20:18] in this the biggest dilemma on this
[2:20:20] earth is what Israel and the
[2:20:24] Palestinians and 160 million Arabs
[2:20:27] around them what they will settle for.
[2:20:30] And you think that all this uprising
[2:20:33] you know be it Tunisia,
[2:20:36] Egypt,
[2:20:37] Libya and on and then continues to
[2:20:41] erupt. Isn't it amazing
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; that it is those very nations that have
[2:20:48] such opposition to Israeli statethood?
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God allows that
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; to be a distraction.
[2:20:57] [Applause]
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; And what does Israel has less to worry
[2:21:01] about when they're fighting amongst
[2:21:03] themselves?
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; And if you read this Bible, it will tell
[2:21:08] you that it's not me shouting this out.
[2:21:11] It's this says that Ishmael will be a
[2:21:14] wild man
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; and he'll have every man against his
[2:21:18] brother
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; and that's exactly what they're doing.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; It's every man. It's the fulfillment of
[2:21:24] this.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; This Bible says this would happen.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; And then what hour are we living in?
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; What is the time that we're living in?
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; We're right there.
[2:21:46] Okay, I'm going to close right quick.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; The power that's released upon us. I
[2:21:52] want to just talk about that for just a
[2:21:54] moment. The power that's been released
[2:21:55] upon you, not will be, has been.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; And this is what this is what God is
[2:22:03] expecting of people when they hear about
[2:22:05] it. He presents it to them. Don't turn
[2:22:08] it down. Don't take it casual. Don't
[2:22:11] say, "Well, I'll, you know, I will when
[2:22:13] I can or when I have time or whatever
[2:22:14] more." God's not interested in that.
[2:22:17] When he presents it to you, that's his
[2:22:19] time.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; And you want to get locked into his
[2:22:22] time.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham just uses
[2:22:34] little simple things. Please don't miss
[2:22:37] this, but he talks about a eagle. He'll
[2:22:40] see the storm clouds coming and he
[2:22:42] soarses way above it. I've seen it
[2:22:43] myself. I've seen them I've seen them
[2:22:45] just soar and hit a certain wave uh
[2:22:49] certain
[2:22:51] uh wind and it just disappear in a few
[2:22:54] seconds and soar way above the thunder
[2:22:58] clouds and the storm clouds.
[2:23:02] If you got any eyes, we got a lot of
[2:23:05] storm clouds around us.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; We have storm clouds.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; I have heaviness in my heart because of
[2:23:17] the storm clouds.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; There's people in this church that
[2:23:20] struggle.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Things are difficult
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; and I feel for them.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; They're facing difficult times.
[2:23:32] workwise
[2:23:34] and the economy.
[2:23:37] Some are facing sickness. As we sit
[2:23:41] here, we have very dear friends and
[2:23:44] relatives that are staring death in the
[2:23:47] face. Don't say we don't need a power.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; We need the power of this one.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:23:56] I would say most everybody here is
[2:23:58] connected to somebody who has not yet
[2:24:03] got the assurance of eternal life.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; And I want to declare without apology,
[2:24:11] we have the answer.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; We have the devil's answer.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; And they need to be delivered.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; I look out across this congregation. I
[2:24:22] know that you have you have children,
[2:24:24] you have brothers, you have sisters, I
[2:24:26] have grandchildren, and they need to be
[2:24:29] delivered. They need to be delivered.
[2:24:31] We're very late in the hour, friends.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; We need to be If we've been earnest,
[2:24:37] let's be more earnest.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; If we prayed, let's pray more earnestly.
[2:24:42] [Applause]
[2:24:50] Can I have about another five 10
[2:24:52] minutes? I know I've been quite long,
[2:24:54] but just give me another few minutes.
[2:24:57] I'm interested. I'm very very interested
[2:25:00] what took place between Ruth and Boaz
[2:25:03] because I told you at the very beginning
[2:25:05] I was going I wanted to I wanted to kind
[2:25:07] of turn my my thoughts towards what did
[2:25:12] Boaz say?
[2:25:14] And he said to he said to Ruth this I'll
[2:25:18] just give me a moment here.
[2:25:23] And these were his first words to her.
[2:25:28] Let thine eyes be on the field that they
[2:25:30] do reap, and go thou after them. Have I
[2:25:35] not charged the young men that they
[2:25:37] shall not touch thee?
[2:25:40] Oh, I'm sorry. And and Boaz said unto
[2:25:42] Ruth, "Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go
[2:25:45] not to glean in another field, neither
[2:25:48] go from hence, but abide here fast by my
[2:25:51] maidens." In other words, he's saying
[2:25:54] also, I want you to listen to me. I want
[2:25:57] you to hear me. And I I began to go and
[2:26:00] I wanted to I wanted to find out
[2:26:04] what uh what what the message came to
[2:26:08] us. And in the deity of Jesus Christ and
[2:26:12] a prophet says, "And I tell you today,
[2:26:14] friend, hear my word." There is a
[2:26:18] drawing power not from the church, not
[2:26:22] from the pastor, but from glory. And
[2:26:25] this baptism of the Holy Ghost moving
[2:26:28] down in that life channel to draw up a
[2:26:32] church. What is it? It's the power of
[2:26:35] God, the access to his life, Zoe.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; And he made it very simple. He said,
[2:26:41] "Hear my word." Amen.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; In choosing of a bride, at the end of
[2:26:48] it, he said, "I've stretched out further
[2:26:50] tonight on this than I have at any other
[2:26:53] anything else, any other time before the
[2:26:57] public because I've had a great a great
[2:27:00] freedom in these meetings." He said, "If
[2:27:02] you believe me to be God's prophet, you
[2:27:05] listen to what I've told you. If there's
[2:27:08] one little tinkle of feeling in your
[2:27:10] hearts, and I'm sounding, I'm echoing
[2:27:12] that. If there's one little tinkle of of
[2:27:15] feeling in your heart, and he said, you
[2:27:18] go to God right now and you do it,
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; that cannot get any simpler and you do
[2:27:24] it,
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; let me tell you, if you'll honor that,
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; you'll receive the benefit of it.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Let thine eyes be on the field that they
[2:27:34] do reap, and go after them. Why? Because
[2:27:37] that's how she was going to be
[2:27:38] sustained. That was her life. You stay
[2:27:41] in this field.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; You stay in this field and you'll
[2:27:44] experience redemption.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; It's all right. I'm still coming to the
[2:27:54] good part.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; And I'm bouncing back and forth. And
[2:28:02] when he took the book, the four beasts,
[2:28:05] all four anointings all through the
[2:28:07] ages, and the four and the four and 20
[2:28:10] elders fell down before the lamb, and
[2:28:14] every one of them having harps and
[2:28:16] golden vials full of odors, which are
[2:28:19] the prayers of the saints, and they sung
[2:28:21] a new song. Brother Mike Gier when he
[2:28:24] when he prayed and he finished praying
[2:28:26] coming to the end of his prayer and
[2:28:28] something came upon him and he broke and
[2:28:30] then the audience and it it was a sound.
[2:28:33] It was a unplanned sound. It was an
[2:28:36] unplanned worship and it was
[2:28:38] uncontrollable worship. Wasn't something
[2:28:41] where I said, you know, worship the
[2:28:43] Lord. This was something that was
[2:28:44] uncontrollable. And furthermore, I'm
[2:28:47] I've never talked to him about it, but I
[2:28:50] can say under the witness that I had, he
[2:28:52] couldn't stop it.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; You couldn't have stopped it, Brother
[2:28:56] Mike. And there a time or two, you know,
[2:28:58] kind of you wanted to maybe slacken it
[2:29:01] off, but then it just came with another
[2:29:02] surge.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; And I knew what I felt. I got in my car
[2:29:07] and my wife said that what happened to
[2:29:10] brother Mike Gier. That was actually
[2:29:13] just exactly what happened in the
[2:29:14] scripture. And soon as they took the
[2:29:16] book and a realization that this was
[2:29:19] this was the redemption taking place.
[2:29:22] Soon as they realized that then they
[2:29:24] just let loose and they couldn't help
[2:29:26] themselves and they fell down. And the
[2:29:29] Bible tells us,
[2:29:32] "And Boaz said to Ruth,
[2:29:36] and Boaz said to Ruth, you'll stay here
[2:29:40] and you'll you'll stay with my maidens
[2:29:43] and you'll glean." And he gave extra
[2:29:46] extra corn for her. And the Bible says,
[2:29:49] "And she fell on her face." That's what
[2:29:51] the four living creatures. Now she fell
[2:29:54] on her face and bowed herself to the
[2:29:56] ground and said unto him, "Why have I
[2:29:59] found grace in thine eyes that thou
[2:30:02] shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I
[2:30:04] am a stranger?" Friends, this is not a
[2:30:06] story. This is a woman
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; that fell down before another man on her
[2:30:10] face.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Why have I found grace in thy sight?
[2:30:14] There isn't anything that you and I
[2:30:16] could do to to overemphasize
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; our our respect and our obesence to God
[2:30:25] himself.
[2:30:28] Oh God.
[2:30:43] I tell you what, friends.
[2:30:56] I found myself in places in life
[2:31:04] and to get down and pray
[2:31:11] wasn't sufficient.
[2:31:15] And you're at a point, you're at a time,
[2:31:18] you reach something and you end up on
[2:31:21] your face. Yeah,
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; you end your end up prostrate.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; Full body length prostrate.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; You're not there for twominut prayer.
[2:31:32] You're not there for five minute prayer.
[2:31:35] You're there as long you're there until
[2:31:38] there's a release and you know you've
[2:31:40] touched God.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; And you listen to me friends.
[2:31:46] Some of you young people need to find
[2:31:47] that spot. Amen.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the best news you could
[2:31:53] ever hear.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; Some of you need to find that spot.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; I can see that the that the deception
[2:32:02] and the and the enemy and his cunning
[2:32:05] ways to come and and you we get
[2:32:08] satisfied with life and don't do it.
[2:32:11] [Music]
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going down the easy way. Don't do
[2:32:15] it. Amen.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; What should I do, brother Ed? Find your
[2:32:20] spot.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; Find a place at his feet.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; Ask him to cover you with his curt.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Get down and say, "What mercy, what
[2:32:31] grace is this?"
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I've been born into it."
[2:32:36] You've been there. It's not because of
[2:32:39] any good that you've done that you have
[2:32:42] Christian parents or or the church that
[2:32:44] you have. You need to have a personal
[2:32:46] experience with God. I will never
[2:32:48] apologize for this.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; I'll never apologize for this, friends.
[2:32:52] This is the greatest favor I could do
[2:32:54] you. You find that place.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; And when she realized what grace this
[2:33:02] was, maybe you have never experienced
[2:33:04] before understanding the grace of God in
[2:33:08] this generation that God would pour out
[2:33:11] upon you, upon us unworthy creatures.
[2:33:14] the power the power to to be to to uh uh
[2:33:19] to miss uh the corruption that's in this
[2:33:22] world. I'm so glad. I'm so thankful I'm
[2:33:26] not subjected to his darts.
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; We're not subjected to his wicked ways.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; I say in the name of Jesus Christ that
[2:33:35] the power of hell be broken.
[2:33:39] [Applause]
[2:33:43] [Music]
[2:33:48] You can go and take this home if you
[2:33:50] would.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Take this home with you.
[2:33:55] And she and I'm closing with this.
[2:33:59] And you've perhaps heard me speak it
[2:34:00] before.
[2:34:08] When Boaz came,
[2:34:11] when Boaz came and
[2:34:14] came right to the point, he had the
[2:34:16] wherewithal, he had the wealth. He was
[2:34:19] sufficient to
[2:34:21] to redeem her. He said, "But there's
[2:34:24] someone who's closer.
[2:34:26] There's a kinsman who's nearer to you."
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; And you have one that's nearer to you,
[2:34:34] too, because you were first born in a
[2:34:37] natural birth. Right?
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; And you were born with a human nature.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; You were born with whatever you were
[2:34:45] born with.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; And I've been I've been preaching upon
[2:34:48] this, but now I'm coming to a
[2:34:50] conclusion. This is the last service on
[2:34:52] it. You were born with whatever you
[2:34:56] inherited
[2:34:57] from your human lineage. Maybe not from
[2:35:00] your parents, grandparents, on down the
[2:35:03] line. We were born with it. I say to you
[2:35:06] in the name of the Lord, don't allow
[2:35:09] anything
[2:35:11] don't allow anything that's come down
[2:35:12] the line to prevent you from giving your
[2:35:16] whole being
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; to the to the word of this hour.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; Give yourself to it completely and
[2:35:23] you'll never you'll never regret it.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Don't allow anything to stand in your
[2:35:29] way.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; And there was a nearer kinsman. But
[2:35:32] notice now and and Boaz said if you can
[2:35:37] you redeem Naomi which was an Old
[2:35:39] Testament figure can you redeem her?
[2:35:42] Said yes because under the Old Testament
[2:35:45] was only the blood of bulls and goats.
[2:35:47] And they could have continued to do
[2:35:48] that. He said notice he said if you are
[2:35:52] going to redeem Naomi you also have to
[2:35:54] redeem Ruth the Moabitis.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; And he said I can't do that. I might mar
[2:36:00] my own inheritance. The truth was he
[2:36:02] didn't have the wherewithal
[2:36:05] to change her.
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't have the wherewithal to change
[2:36:09] her from a moabitete to an Israelite. He
[2:36:12] didn't have the power to change and and
[2:36:14] and that would have to follow into the
[2:36:17] into the New Testament. He didn't have
[2:36:19] the power to transform a sinner to a
[2:36:22] Christian to a saint.
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; I can't do it. And boy says, then I
[2:36:27] will.
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. then I will.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he did.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; There's a song
[2:36:39] uh
[2:36:43] there's a song we can have the musicians
[2:36:45] come
[2:36:47] and it's a
[2:36:50] I just want to read a couple of the
[2:36:51] verses. I know in whom I've believed.
[2:36:55] I know not why God's wondrous grace to
[2:37:00] me he hath made known, nor why unworthy
[2:37:04] Christ in love redeemed me for his own.
[2:37:08] I don't understand at all is what the
[2:37:09] songwriter sang, but I know in whom I've
[2:37:11] believed. And then another verse, I know
[2:37:15] not how the spirit moves, convincing men
[2:37:18] of sin, revealing Jesus through the
[2:37:22] word, creating faith in him. I don't
[2:37:25] know how it all works, but I know it
[2:37:28] does work.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand with me, please?
[2:37:43] I realize that, you know, a lot of the I
[2:37:45] just wanted to make these statements to
[2:37:48] you and have you be able to think about
[2:37:50] them and let you know how serious and
[2:37:54] sincere I am about it.
[2:37:57] I just feel that
[2:38:03] we need some examples.
[2:38:05] [Music]
[2:38:11] I know that we appeal often to our young
[2:38:13] people, but you are the
[2:38:16] you're really the answer
[2:38:20] to a lot of things within this
[2:38:22] congregation.
[2:38:26] And you need to step forward.
[2:38:29] You don't need to slack off. You need to
[2:38:32] step forward.
[2:38:37] Is it okay if I talk to you this way?
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll is calling for you to
[2:38:43] step forward. Not not just one or two as
[2:38:46] a whole group. Say, "Well, I don't I
[2:38:48] don't really feel like it. And what do I
[2:38:50] do?" And so on. I'm not interested in
[2:38:51] what you feel like. I'm interested in in
[2:38:54] in saying to you that this is the hour
[2:38:58] that is that is necessary. This is more
[2:39:01] than just a social gathering. Amen.
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to gather socially.
[2:39:06] We're here and and I want I want you to
[2:39:08] become uh examples to others.
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; Say, "What would you like to see?" I'd
[2:39:13] like to see
[2:39:15] the body of believers of this
[2:39:17] congregation
[2:39:19] become so fervent for God.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; Can you become more too fervent? I don't
[2:39:25] think so.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for what I have seen.
[2:39:28] I'm thankful for the witnessing that's
[2:39:30] gone on. I'm so thankful, Brother
[2:39:33] Matthew Redell, for taking some
[2:39:35] leadership and and gathering people
[2:39:38] together and going out on the streets.
[2:39:40] I'm thankful for that. I want to I would
[2:39:43] like to see uh uh I would like to see
[2:39:47] young men and young ladies, you
[2:39:50] especially when you get up into your mid
[2:39:52] into your late teens, the world has so
[2:39:54] much to offer you, but it's not good.
[2:39:58] It's not good. And so
[2:40:02] are are you hearing me?
[2:40:05] [Music]
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; Bar none. I'm not I'm not just speaking
[2:40:09] this to a few. I speak this to the
[2:40:13] congregation as a whole, but largely to
[2:40:15] the young people, young men, young
[2:40:18] ladies. And I I I see
[2:40:22] the reason I say this is because I see
[2:40:24] that everything that Satan has, he
[2:40:27] throws it out to the feet of the young
[2:40:29] people
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; really to they're not out after people
[2:40:34] my age or middle age or whatever more.
[2:40:36] They're, you know, they try to sell you
[2:40:38] life insurance or something, but we're
[2:40:40] talking about young people. Have fun and
[2:40:42] everything's just a great big hilarious
[2:40:44] time and and friends, it's not that way.
[2:40:48] you get on down the road, you'll find
[2:40:50] you need this power that God has
[2:40:52] released upon the church. You need this
[2:40:54] power. You thank God for this service.
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in having just a big
[2:40:59] habool of time. You know, I'm in
[2:41:01] interested in conveying something to
[2:41:03] you. So when you walk out these doors,
[2:41:06] you'll say, I'm going to do something
[2:41:08] substantial. I'm going to make a
[2:41:10] turnaround. Yes, brother Biscll, it's
[2:41:13] been true. The enemy has just been
[2:41:15] wearing on me. Somebody's wore down.
[2:41:18] Somebody is uh uh you know got friends.
[2:41:21] Let me deal with this friend thing for
[2:41:23] just a moment. A real friend is someone
[2:41:26] that is a Holy Ghost friend.
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; And outside of a Holy Ghost friend,
[2:41:30] they're not a Holy Ghost friend.
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; I've had too many experiences. That's
[2:41:41] why I stand here sometimes silent.
[2:41:46] I had a close
[2:41:48] [Music]
[2:41:51] family member of mine
[2:41:55] [Music]
[2:41:58] and she was attractive
[2:42:03] and I could see the the world was
[2:42:06] getting a hold of her
[2:42:08] and she was caught up with her beauty
[2:42:12] and I stopped her on the street
[2:42:16] in a large city
[2:42:18] early in the morning when everyone's
[2:42:20] just going every direction to work and
[2:42:22] men in their briefcases lying every
[2:42:25] direction.
[2:42:26] And so I just said, "We're standing
[2:42:29] right on the corner of the street." And
[2:42:32] I wasn't I wasn't making much success
[2:42:34] getting through to her. I said, "You see
[2:42:36] all these people? Do you see all these
[2:42:38] men?"
[2:42:40] I said, "There's probably all kinds of
[2:42:42] them would take you and sleep with you
[2:42:44] tonight
[2:42:45] and violate your body
[2:42:48] and they kick you in the ditch the next
[2:42:50] morning." That's what that means.
[2:42:54] In other words, you need to wake up. Let
[2:42:56] me You might say, "Well, that is kind of
[2:42:58] crass." Let me tell you something.
[2:43:01] That's mild compared to what Satan has
[2:43:03] in mind for you.
[2:43:05] [Music]
[2:43:07] That's mild compared to what Satan's got
[2:43:09] in planned for you.
[2:43:11] &gt;&gt; You fellas to go go you go Satan's way.
[2:43:13] I'll just tell you something. There'll
[2:43:15] be a day you'll remember these words I'm
[2:43:17] speaking and you'll regret it.
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; You'll regret going Satan's way.
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; The way of the transgressor is
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; hard. Say it again. Hard.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; The wages of sin is
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; death. And when God poured out the kind
[2:43:35] of anointing he has in this age to give
[2:43:37] you life
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; and to escape that,
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; then we cannot take that lightly.
[2:43:43] &gt;&gt; We want to be you want to be able to
[2:43:45] fall on your knees and say, "What grace
[2:43:47] is this?"
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; That you'd allow me to escape this.
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:43:58] I'll put you on the line.
[2:44:02] know not why God's wonderous comes to me
[2:44:10] he has made known
[2:44:14] nor why
[2:44:16] worthy Christ
[2:44:22] for is
[2:44:34] that he is able
[2:44:37] to
[2:44:48] [Music]
[2:44:50] hold my How the spirit
[2:44:57] of sus.
[2:44:59] [Music]
[2:45:26] which I will be
[2:45:29] until
[2:45:34] we sing as we sing the last two verses.
[2:45:37] Brother David McAdam,
[2:45:39] you desired prayer this morning. We're
[2:45:42] going to pray with you if you make your
[2:45:44] way forward. I've known brother David
[2:45:47] McAdam for a long time. And this is the
[2:45:49] first time he's been, I believe, in this
[2:45:51] church. And he comes from the Tri Cities
[2:45:54] in Washington area
[2:45:56] and
[2:45:58] had a serious accident many years ago.
[2:46:03] And we want to pray for our brother
[2:46:05] David. He's he'd been in a lot of pain,
[2:46:09] tremendous pain, and he just decided he
[2:46:12] didn't want to be on these all these
[2:46:13] painkillers so on. And you'd feel the
[2:46:16] same way. And so I'd like brother Andes
[2:46:20] if you'd come, brother Tom, brother
[2:46:21] Ernie, and Brother David has heard you,
[2:46:25] Brother Ernie, and heard almost all the
[2:46:26] ministry here and he's been very
[2:46:28] affected by it. And we know who we've
[2:46:32] believed in, Brother David.
[2:46:36] God bless you.
[2:46:39] We'll sing the next verse, please.
[2:46:44] I know
[2:46:46] what a good or
[2:46:51] reserve for me.
[2:46:56] We wait for golden days before his face.
[2:47:04] I see.
[2:47:07] I know.
[2:47:10] I believe
[2:47:13] and ever say
[2:47:16] that he is able
[2:47:19] to keep
[2:47:22] which I will
[2:47:24] [Music]
[2:47:32] &gt;&gt; brother Ryan would you sing only believe
[2:47:35] please let's sing as a congregation only
[2:47:37] believe and if you just direct your
[2:47:39] faith this way if you would please the
[2:47:41] whole congregation direct your faith if
[2:47:43] you would towards our brother David if
[2:47:46] you would
[2:47:49] only
[2:47:51] be
[2:47:54] [Music]
[2:47:56] holy
[2:48:02] all things are possible Oh,
[2:48:08] holy
[2:48:10] de.
[2:48:12] [Music]
[2:48:20] Oh God,
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; oh God. Oh God,
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; all things are possible.
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:48:34] holy
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus is our brother David.
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:48:42] &gt;&gt; Just speaks to you now and said heal me
[2:48:45] Lord.
[2:48:47] We say, Lord Jesus, we agree with his
[2:48:50] words.
[2:48:51] &gt;&gt; And we agree with what you spoke on
[2:48:53] Calvary. You said, "It is finished."
[2:48:56] You're the one that paid the full price.
[2:48:59] &gt;&gt; You're the one, oh God, that left
[2:49:01] nothing undone.
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; You knew in every footstep that he would
[2:49:06] ever take.
[2:49:07] &gt;&gt; You knew what he would endure through
[2:49:10] life.
[2:49:11] &gt;&gt; Oh God, you have been his companion.
[2:49:14] You've been his friend. You have been
[2:49:16] the one, oh God, that has looked after
[2:49:18] him, watched after, watched over him.
[2:49:21] And now we pray in the name of Jesus
[2:49:23] Christ.
[2:49:25] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we agree the brethren and lay
[2:49:28] hands upon our brother that you will
[2:49:30] take and remove the pain that he's been
[2:49:33] suffering in his body. Oh God, as a
[2:49:36] result of this accident years ago and
[2:49:39] now, Father, I pray that he will be
[2:49:42] delivered by the mighty deliverer by the
[2:49:45] redeemer. God, this is not the life that
[2:49:48] you intended for him, the one you have
[2:49:50] written in the book. Father, I pray, oh
[2:49:52] God, that he may experience the complete
[2:49:55] deliverance from it, Father, and may the
[2:49:58] pain dissipate from his body in Jesus
[2:50:01] Christ's name and for your glory.
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; We agree together.
[2:50:09] &gt;&gt; We agree together.
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; And we'll give you all the glory. Lord
[2:50:13] Jesus,
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:50:19] I believe.
[2:50:22] Lord,
[2:50:25] I believe.
[2:50:29] All things are are
[2:50:33] [Music]
[2:50:41] Lord
[2:50:43] I
[2:50:47] Lord
[2:50:49] I
[2:50:51] [Music]
[2:50:54] all things are possible.
[2:50:58] [Music]
[2:51:07] God bless you.
[2:51:09] I trust the word wasn't too direct and
[2:51:12] yet I wanted real direct.
[2:51:15] Hallelujah.
[2:51:16] Let's bow our heads together.
[2:51:20] And now, Father,
[2:51:22] these are your people. These are your
[2:51:25] children.
[2:51:27] And I'm asking, oh God, that blessings
[2:51:30] will be poured out upon them. I pray
[2:51:33] that you'll bless their homes, bless
[2:51:35] their circle of friends, bless them, oh
[2:51:38] God, with an influence. May the Holy
[2:51:41] Spirit influence them. Each one as we
[2:51:44] give ourselves to you. And as the songs
[2:51:48] were sung earlier in the worship, I
[2:51:50] surrender all.
[2:51:52] Oh God, I think of the spirit that came
[2:51:55] upon that gentile moabitis Ruth and how
[2:52:00] she fell. Oh God, out of no one was
[2:52:04] asking her to do that, but out of her
[2:52:06] own spirit realizing how privileged she
[2:52:11] was, how what a benefit had come her way
[2:52:15] and what grace is this. And we say, "Oh
[2:52:18] God, what amazing grace that caught our
[2:52:21] spirit, caught our soul while it was in
[2:52:25] its free fall. You caught it and took a
[2:52:28] hold of it. Oh God, how we thank you for
[2:52:31] redemption. We thank you, Lord Jesus. I
[2:52:35] want to thank you in public. I want to
[2:52:37] thank you. I thank you for reaching out
[2:52:39] your hand and taking the record of my
[2:52:42] life. Oh God, I thank you for taking, oh
[2:52:45] God, the book into your hand and
[2:52:48] redeeming it in as your prophet said and
[2:52:50] taking it within yourself. And now we
[2:52:53] want to declare we have a love, such a
[2:52:56] love for you, Lord. I pray that you will
[2:52:58] go with the people as they are dismissed
[2:53:01] being the only service that we have
[2:53:03] today. May they have an afternoon,
[2:53:05] Father, of fellowship around your word.
[2:53:08] I pray that you'll bless, oh God,
[2:53:10] especially as I directed many of my
[2:53:13] comments today to the young men and the
[2:53:16] young women of this congregation.
[2:53:19] Father, I pray that they will do
[2:53:21] business with you. Perhaps go back to
[2:53:23] their rooms and kneel at their bed and
[2:53:26] pray through until they feel, oh God,
[2:53:29] that you have come and answered them.
[2:53:32] Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:53:34] Christ, I resist every enemy. I resist
[2:53:38] every spirit that would try to seduce
[2:53:41] and and to bring them down, oh God, or
[2:53:44] to cause them to seek an easier way.
[2:53:47] Lord, I pray that they will do as your
[2:53:49] prophet messenger did when he was spoken
[2:53:52] to and you you he you gave to him. You
[2:53:55] spoke to him and said, "Because you've
[2:53:57] chosen the harder way, but it's my way."
[2:54:00] Lord, we're here tonight. I wanted this
[2:54:03] afternoon to go your way. Lord Jesus,
[2:54:06] we're not interested in what pleases
[2:54:08] man, but we're interested in what
[2:54:10] pleases you. Father, in the name of
[2:54:12] Jesus Christ, I commit the words that
[2:54:15] have been spoken to you and the people
[2:54:16] that are present now.
[2:54:19] I ask, Father, that their hearts will
[2:54:22] turn to you more completely, more fully,
[2:54:25] more surrendered,
[2:54:27] Jesus, for all of us. Call us, woo over
[2:54:31] us. I pray by your Holy Spirit's drawing
[2:54:35] in Jesus name.
[2:54:38] Amen. Amen.
[2:54:42] Hallelujah.
[2:54:43] [Music]
[2:54:45] Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord.
[2:54:50] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:54:54] Lord we thank you Lord.
[2:54:58] [Music]
[2:54:59] Or we could just sing may Lord I lift
[2:55:02] your name your holy name
[2:55:07] [Music]
[2:55:18] all your
[2:55:21] want to praise your holy name
[2:55:26] Jehovah.
[2:55:30] God,
[2:55:31] [Music]
[2:55:39] the
[2:55:41] great
[2:55:45] [Music]
[2:55:53] [Music]
[2:55:55] my God
[2:55:57] Let's
[2:55:59] [Music]
[2:56:06] just conclude in worship. Lord Heat.
[2:56:09] Heat.
[2:56:23] Heat. Heat.
[2:56:33] Yeah.
[2:56:36] Heat.
[2:56:50] My God.
[2:56:55] [Music]
[2:57:03] Isn't he lovely?
[2:57:05] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to greet one another. And
[2:57:07] when you do, have a resolve within your
[2:57:10] own heart. You're going to be an
[2:57:12] influence to influence others. I would
[2:57:15] like to invite
[2:57:17] [Music]
[2:57:19] you into this wonderful
[2:57:22] wonderful release of the Holy Spirit.
[2:57:25] I'd like to invite you to become a
[2:57:29] participant.
[2:57:31] If you haven't experienced
[2:57:33] the power of God,
[2:57:36] friends, I just want to say to you as a
[2:57:38] testimony,
[2:57:40] I probably experienced
[2:57:43] a release of the Holy Spirit even over
[2:57:46] the last few months that has been a
[2:57:48] surprise. It's been a shock to me. Said,
[2:57:52] "Oh God." And that's why I speak with
[2:57:55] such ferveny because I love him so much.
[2:57:58] ought to have one more time,
[2:58:01] &gt;&gt; one more opportunity to persuade
[2:58:04] somebody
[2:58:05] &gt;&gt; to give their all to him.
[2:58:09] &gt;&gt; I want to shake hands with you on the
[2:58:11] other side.
[2:58:13] And I want to be able to hear. Thank
[2:58:15] you, brother Ed. Thank you for that
[2:58:17] service. Thank you for crying out with
[2:58:20] all the energy that God will give you.
[2:58:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:58:26] &gt;&gt; Some have said to me, you're speaking
[2:58:27] like you're a 40 or 50 year old man.
[2:58:29] It's not that so much. I guess there's
[2:58:32] just something within me. Oh God, if I
[2:58:35] could just take a hold of you and carry
[2:58:37] you to that place.
[2:58:39] And God, I know that there's some needs
[2:58:41] and whatever you do, I don't want this
[2:58:43] to be just an emotional moment, but I
[2:58:46] want you to go from here and do business
[2:58:47] with God. You find a place where you're
[2:58:50] alone with God. Find yourself a place
[2:58:53] where you just say, "God, turn me into a
[2:58:55] fanatic." It'll be so fervent for you.
[2:58:59] Can you say amen for me? God bless you.
[2:59:01] Greet one another. You're dismissed in
[2:59:04] Jesus name.
[2:59:09] [Music]
