TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Psalm 139 to the chief musician a Psalm of David oh Lord thou Hast searched me and known me thou knowest my downsitting and mine Uprising thou understandest my thought a far off thou compassest my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but lo oh Lord thou knowest it all together thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain unto it wither shall I go from thy Spirit or wither shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yay the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou Hast possessed my Reigns thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous of thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee surely thou Wilt slay the wicked oh God
