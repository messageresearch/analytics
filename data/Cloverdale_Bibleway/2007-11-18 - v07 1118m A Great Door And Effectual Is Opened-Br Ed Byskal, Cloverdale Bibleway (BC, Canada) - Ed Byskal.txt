[Music] Man, I'm gonna ask Sister Linda and Sister Florence, uh, come help me sing a song. Brother Ryan, you know, when you win a victory like Moses did, Lord told Moses, he said, "Go into Pharaoh, for I've hardened his heart, the heart of his servants, that I might show these signs before him." That was the reason he hardened his heart, so he could show the signs. and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy sons sons what things I have wrought in Egypt and my signs which I have done among them that ye might know that I am the Lord. So you know when these victories happen you know we need to start we need to rehearse them. &gt;&gt; You know in Joel prophet Joel says tell your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children &gt;&gt; another generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's restored. Amen. And we have the we've got the victory this morning, saints. We're going to sing this little song. We've sung it before and and uh I want to make sure everybody knows it. So when we sing the chorus uh together, you know, you can sing it. This song just keeps going over and over in my mind. And uh trust that you'd uh sing along with us this morning. You can have your seats. [Music] Many times I've questioned certain circumstances or things I could not understand. [Music] Many times in trials, weakness blurs my vision. That's when my frustration gets so out of hand. But it's then I am reminded that I've never been forsaken and I've never had to stand one test alone. As I look at all the victories, then the spirit rises up in me. And it's through the fire my weakness is made strong. Oh, he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. Oh, he never offered our victories without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. So just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give in. Just hold on. My Lord will show up. &gt;&gt; Yes. And he will take you through the fire again. I know within myself that I would surely perish. Oh, but if I trust the mighty hand of God, he'll shield the flames again. again. He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. &gt;&gt; He never offered our victories without fighting, but he said help would come in. So saints when yours when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary he says just give it [Music] our Lord will show up &gt;&gt; and he will take you through the fire. Can you help us sing this morning, saints? &gt;&gt; He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. Oh, he never offered a victory without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. [Music] Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give in just our Lord will show up &gt;&gt; and he will take you through the fire. [Music] He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to [Music] &gt;&gt; He never offered our victories without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. So just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give our Lord will show up &gt;&gt; and he will take you through the fire. Say one more time. He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to ride. [Music] He never offered our victories without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give just our Lord will show up this and he will take you through the fire again. So just remember, just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give justice for us. My Lord will show up &gt;&gt; and he will take you through the fire again. &gt;&gt; Just hold on. Just hold on. &gt;&gt; Hold on. My Lord will show up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he will take you through the fire again. &gt;&gt; Hold on. &gt;&gt; Hold on. My Lord will show up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he will take you through the fire. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Man, you might have a trial you're going through this morning. Amen. The Lord's here to meet your need. Amen. We got some requests here this morning. We want to take before the Lord. I'm going to ask brother Dier if he'd come and take these requests before the Lord. We don't remember our brother Daryl Drake. He's been in a hospital since Friday afternoon undergoing tests and so far all the tests are negative or normal except he's got elevated sugar levels in his blood and he's uh being transferred to Children's Hospital on Monday for more tests and they believe he's become a diabetic. Amen. And we want to stand with the Drake family. Amen. And say we got the victory this morning. Amen. who want to stand against this thing. Amen. We got a testimony from Sister Amelia. Wants to thank God and all the church, Brother Tom, Brother John for praying for my son Dario. He has a test and the cancer's gone. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. The Hoverer sisters want us to pray for their brother and uh he needs deliverance. Amen. So want to join our hearts with them this morning. If you've got a need this morning, you just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer. If you're listening on the internet, man, and you've got a need this morning, amen, you feel like you're in the fire, the Lord's there with you. Amen. And and he knows every need, amen, this morning. So and ask brother Dia if you'd come and open the service in prayer. Father, we thank you this morning. How we appreciate your grace in our lives, oh God. How grateful we are to you, the living God. for you thought of us and you considered us in this hour, Father, to come and make yourself known and come and open our eyes, allowing us to see this bright shining light, your very own revelation, oh God, that we can, Father, realize that we came from you and here we are being made ready to go back to where we belong. Father, &gt;&gt; you have secured our victory. Oh Lord Jesus, you wrote it in your very own blood. Father, when dare you drop even that very last drop, you said it was finished, oh God, to give us the assurance this morning that there's nothing that is written against us, Father. You banish the ordinances, oh God, that was written, Father, against us this morning, that we can come in liberty, Father. We can come in freedom, oh God. We can come to sing and to celebrate this mighty victory that is belonging to us. That is becoming real every day. Father, that is becoming such a personal thing in our lives that we know the enemy is nothing but a bluff this morning that the children of God have overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the testimony of our mouth this morning. We're testifying that we're more than able by what you have done for us. Father, we can stand here, oh God, redeemed, Lord, knowing that you have sent us, Father, through the fire, but you have allowed us to see your mighty hand, your hands of deliverance, your hand of power, Father. So, we are thanking you this morning, Lord. We're coming to celebrate your grace, to celebrate this victory. Father, we're just so glad to know that you made this thing so sure and secure that there's no doubt in our minds this morning that you're more than able, Father, to meet every need, to touch every life. Oh God, we come believing, Father, we can go back rejoicing, oh Father, come among us this day and minister to every need. Remember, Father, the burden that we're carrying, for you are more than enough to us. You are the great Jehovah Jara. You have already made provision. Father, if we can but believe this morning, we can go out rejoicing, Father, knowing that all things is well. Our God has given unto us even exceedingly beyond all we can think of as this morning, Lord. Father, we're remembering the needy one this morning. Our brother Dar Father, we know this is nothing but the enemy, but we're claiming total victory this morning, Father. Come, oh Jesus, and touch him in such a way that a testimony will come back even as you did with sister Amelia's son, riding him of that cancer, oh God, that it is nothing to you, oh God. We curse that enemy this morning. We ask for total deliverance and that your name can be glorified as the testimony comes back in the house of God. We claim that this morning. We receive it, Father, and we thank you in advance, Lord, that it's already been done. And that your name, oh God, is that strong tower where we can go and find safety and refuge this morning. Have your way, Father. Bless the gathering this morning. Remember your servant, our pastor, as he's coming to stand at his post of duty, Lord. Anoint the man of God. Let the human element be moved out of the way that a divine channel can be open and revelation can be imparted to us this morning. We want to hear from heaven, Lord. And we know as we've gathered this place, we believe your presence is here to do all that our hearts are longing for. It's you that we want to see, Lord. Make yourself known once again. Come and anoint us, Father, to receive that hidden mana and to be strengthened in the inner man. We love you this morning, Lord. We just bless your great name. We appreciate this privilege of standing in your presence, Lord. We ask that you have your preeminence. You lead in all things, Lord, and that you glorify your name once again, by doing the supernatural among us, Lord. This is your gathering, Father. You say that the gathering of the people will be unto you. So, we commit the service under your great hand and asking that you have your way in Jesus name. We thank you father. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have your seats. Want to welcome everyone this morning. Happy to have each and every one of you here. And uh those that are visiting with us, we just want to extend a real warm welcome to you. Uh the choir is going to sing for us this morning. Uh so if they would come and uh and uh get ready. We have one announcement this morning or two. Um we are happy to announce that we have another member of the body of uh this church this morning.

Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll I'll have you just take your seats for a few moments before we we reading the scriptures. Uh we want to remember our brother uh Leon and brother Don de Ga. Uh also brother Allan who most of us know and sister Stephanie their mother uh it is the Alan and Dawn and Leon's stepfather passed away yesterday and so they have gone to be uh with their mother in Toronto and uh the the gathering of the families today he was Jewish Gerald Cohen and they they have a they have a burial almost immediately after the person has passed away within a number of hours. So that is taking place today. So I would ask the congregation we have already had prayer for them. we have spoken and prayed with Sister Stephanie last night and uh so a lot of you sisters are very close to Sister Stephanie and I I couldn't help but think and in connection perhaps with the message this morning how marvelous it was that uh many here know the testimony but I'll just be very brief with it. Here's brother Leon, a young man uh wanting to see the world, wanting to travel, fine, handsome young fellow. And uh so he travels from South South Africa to Europe and he tours Europe. And while he's in Europe, he sees uh uh some kind of a notice in the media that the that uh Oh, I know. I'm sorry. First he thought, well, I'll I'll I'll extend my vacation. I'll go and travel across America. And dur and in this time he's in Los Angeles. And while he's in Los Angeles, he picks up a newspaper and sees that the World Council of Churches is having uh which they only have once every six years is having their uh conference in Vancouver. and that there will be 3,000 delegates and besides 3,000 delegates will be uh thousands more of visitors and people who will be attending and all kinds of groups are invited of these delegates. Even the Palestinians had a they had a a a table or a booth there. And then there were workshops and meetings of all kinds and then uh great gatherings of meetings and world leaders that were speaking. And so Leon thought, "Wow, this is going to be quite an event." And he always had some kind of, you know, spiritual craving that he couldn't explain. I'll go there. This this must be something only happens once every six years. And he does. He comes and he's wandering around amongst all these thousands of people. And there was about somewhere between 40 and 50 of the congregation here and the brothers that were burdened to do something. And we always tried to attend some of these significant gatherings. When Billy Graham was here, we did. When the Pope was here, brothers from the church did till the police stopped them. if you can believe it. And uh so there they were, 40, 50 of the brothers handing out message books and so on. And everybody who are delegates, they were given big bags because everyone had something to give out. So they had these big bags and they just open their shopping bag up and we could deposit a book in it. And who knows what country they went to. Hundreds of countries. And uh but Leon was one of those. He was standing there like a little lost sheep and uh the brothers got a hold of him and I think then he came to live with brother Milo for a number of weeks and he stayed here for some months. His vacation ended but his real vacation started. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh brother Leon has been with us ever since. And then he got burdened for his family and he went home. His mother gave her heart to Christ, came to the knowledge of the message, became a part of brother Billy Ratif's church, and uh Don gave his life to Christ, Allan gave his life to Christ, and they're working on one more brother. So, uh it's wonderful how God does things, isn't it? We're so thankful for that. Uh we're going to need uh some volunteer help. And uh this is starting from tomorrow morning, Monday the 19th on through to December 30th. Now, we know that no one can volunteer for that period of time, but uh we need some brothers. Uh we'll only need three at a time, but we would like as many brothers as would be available that could make themselves available a day or a couple of days between now and the end of the year. If you would please meet Brother Chris Peterson, he will be at the at the office and just to take your name and when you might or be be available and he could call on you and they want to draw draw up a schedule. Uh there it's just some labor work and that we have to uh do some uh work at the camp which we knew we had to do having to do with the septic systems etc. But we've got the uh the people there and they have the equipment etc. But we just need some we don't it doesn't require a lot of skill. Uh but uh uh you may gain some skills and then we could use you more. And if you're not in shape, if you say, "Well, I'm not really in shape." This will help you. You will get in shape. uh you will be fed the pay according to brother Chris unfortunately you won't receive any earthly remuneration but eternal benefits are great &gt;&gt; and they're available from our ultimate employer have openings for three people but we don't want just three to show up because we need to schedule some along the way and great opportunity for advancement into other volunteer construction project based on performance. So, Brother Chris, I hope that you are inundated with manpower. Amen. And uh for those that are on this side of the border, uh arrangements are being made so that uh even those that are more skilled will be able to assist down there. Amen. Isn't the Lord wonderful? We're just going to see how the service goes this this morning. And uh I have a a a video of the Congo. It's only 13 minutes, but I'm not going to show it before the word. We will just see how the service goes. And uh if we don't have time this morning, perhaps this evening after the service, we can show it. Uh those of you that were not able to be in the service when brother Murphy uh spoke, it was un unfortunate. I know that many were feeling, well, we'll stream. We'll be at home and stream, but it was a service we didn't stream for obvious reasons. And uh uh that's that's all we could do. We just couldn't stream that service. So uh we apologize. And yet we can't really fully apologize. There are things that we have to do and take uh take certain measures. Amen. Well, I would like to ask you to stand once again if you would. And let's sing we place thee in the highest place. Thanks, brother Ryan. I'd like you also if you'd remember uh remember I and my wife, my wife and I and uh actually our daughters are going to attend with us to brother Donnie Reagan's and I'm to speak the uh Thanksgiving meetings there. And I'd just like to say to the congregation here, I'm very very thankful to be alive. I'm thankful to be able to once more proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm glad that God gives us the strength and has given us the revelation of his word that is to me so priceless and becomes more priceless. And as I move through the service this morning, I would like to ask God to give you just a a a sense of what's on my own heart because I believe we're in a great time. We are in a great time. We're in a a marvelous day. And you're not here by accident. You didn't come into the message, you know, by a fluke of some kind. You came in by design. You believe that? came in by absolute design. And so we want the one who designed all of these things to move us in the direction that he would have us to be moved. Amen. We place in the highest place. We place you in the highest place for you. &gt;&gt; You alone Lord are the great highest. We praise you. [Music] All and we come to you and we worship [Music] &gt;&gt; once again we place you in the highest. Oh God, we look for you on a great high and we praise you. [Music] I above all else. High above all [Music] and we come to you. We worship at your feet. Let's just look to him with our hearts lifted up and open. But as we come to the word and those things that are on your heart, he sees and knows. Father, once again we add our prayer to the prayer brother Dier prayed and to the prayers that were lifted up from not only this congregation that is visible but that congregation which is part of your body Lord that even at this moment their hearts are tied and linked to our hearts via the internet. I pray, oh God, you'll see the burdens that we have and the praises that we have and the worship that we have and the victory that we're rejoicing in. Oh God, we do pray for brother Leon, Brother Don, and Sister Stephanie, their mother, Brother Allan, and those, oh God, who have a sense of loss and a sense of grief, but yet we know that you are the comforter and you're the lifter up of our head. And I pray Lord you lift up their hearts today father as they are together. I ask Lord that there will be such a supernatural visitation and such a virtue that will be poured into them. Grace upon grace upon grace. And I pray father that a supernatural measure will be their portion. We're thinking of uh Sister Rebecca and brother Tony, sister Rebecca's sister Shirley, her husband is in need. A great burden, Lord, for an and Ba. Lord, I pray for brother Ba who's not feeling all that well either. Strengthen him, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, we have this right. And I pray Lord you'll give supernatural strength to my sister Anne. And father oh God at this moment that they might know that when they pray you hear. And when you hear you answer Lord I pray for Shirley's husband Lauren in the state that he's in. And even at this moment Lord as critical as it might be to humans yet we put everything into your hands into your care and into your keeping. And we can say this with assurance. Thou doest all things well. And we say yay and amen to that scripture. You do all things well, oh God. Giver of every good gift. I pray you'll give us a measure now of the Holy Spirit, Lord. Something that is even beyond what we think we can contain. May it just uh may it just possess us so completely. I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll drive back the forces of the enemy. And may all darkness and doubt disappear. May it dissipate. I pray you'll bring every human spirit into subjection to the Holy Spirit and take every thought, oh God, bringing into captivity to the mind of Christ. In Jesus Christ's name, I pray you'll give, oh God, utterance for my lips today to speak what you have said for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Please take your Bibles if you would and I would like you to turn to uh Revelation the 3 chapter and we're going to start at verse 7. And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia, write these things saith he that is holy, he that is true. He that hath the key of David. He that openeth and no man shutth and shutth and no man openeth. I know thy works. Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it. For thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie. Behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth. Behold, I come quickly, and hold fast uh hold fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown. Him that overcomemeth will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from God, from my God. And I will write upon him my new name. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit uh saith unto the churches. I read one more scripture please in 1 Corinthians the 16th chapter which is the last chapter of that book in just verse 9 apostle Paul is concluding some instruction and he says for a great door and effectual is opened unto And there are many adversaries. I like you to notice it's a great door. It's effectual and are many adversaries. And whatever door God opens for you, it's a great door in that it's a supernatural opening. That's what makes it great. It's supernatural. It's not something you did. It's a great door. It is an opening. And thirdly, it will be uh secondly, it will be effectual. It will be effective. And thirdly, there will be adversaries. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. I'll need your undivided attention, which I thank you for meeting from meeting, but there are some times when you just don't want anything to escape the people. So if we could have just as little movement as possible once you get settled and the scripture which we read as you uh that are familiar with the message are well acquainted that the Philadelphiaian church age brother Brandham said was the age of brotherly love and also the age of the open door. It was the age of a great missionary effort. And so I want to I want to make quite a few references, excuse me, to that age. But you must not think, oh, that's just the last age and has no reference to us. Because in the Philadelphia church age in the church age book and I will be taking quite a number of quotes both out of the church age book and also to the Philadelphiaian the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church ages be and and uh uh because he made certain statements there that are very very uh very powerful and pertinent to us right now and to this church. So he said, "I have set before thee an open door." Said, "I want to look at these words again." See, he'd referred to them before. I want to look at these words again. This time, though I though I am not going to disassociate them from missions, I'm going to bring you a thought which carries deep into the last stage. Now, that's a key phrase for me. I'm going to look at these words. I I placed before you. I put set before you an open door which was distinctly God's u message from the Lord Jesus Christ to the messenger of the last age. But he said, I want to look at this uh these words again. And he said, I'm not going to disassociate those words I set before you an open door. I'm not going to disassociate those from missions from missions but I'm going to bring you a thought which carries deep into the last age so it carries forward deep into this age and that's why we need to uh look at it very prayerfully this morning and he went on to say as I have already stated this age now I'm coming to a major principle here a major thought that brother bring brother Brandham brings in as I've already stated this age which was speaking Philadelphiaian age melts into melts into the last age. It was this age Jesus said I come quickly and to the last age he was going to finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. according to Romans 9:28 said notice how this verse of Revelations 3:8 goes open door little strength and name. He said the open door has to do with all three. So the open door now he's tied that directly to the last church age. He said and this one melts into this one. He uses the phrase lapping over and he used that of all the ages. One laps over and kind of feathers off into the other, fades into the other. And of course, we have that with we're not uh unfamiliar with that in in uh in the realm and the area of shall we say technology and inventions and things that have happened. You'll see why I'm saying this at this point in just a few moments. But things in the world because as knowledge has increased and knowledge has been gained, you'll find that one uh one type of invention just doesn't just pass off the scene just cut off like that and something absolutely new just comes. It is one increases into the other. You understand the the technology we have of this generation, you know, something is introduced and it's introduced in a very primitive way and then as as knowledge is gained and it's refined and and increased and all and and finally you have some some you know uh uh shall I say magnificently example of what started maybe a few years ago. Well, in the church age, you find it's the same thing. And that the door, the open door has to do with all three of the open door, a little strength. The open door with a little strength, the word and the name, all three. Now just to digress from that for a moment. In the world there is really only two powers in the message of the uh greatest battle ever fought. And these are just selected phrases out of out of a paragraph there. He said there's only two powers in the universe. There's only two powers and there's only two kingdoms. All the rest of the little minor things are connected with either one of these two powers. Every war, every disorder, everything that comes along is either controlled by God's power or Satan's power. And that is the power of life and the power of death. I need to make that statement because I want to build on this fact of these two kingdoms in the sense that we are living in both at the same time. The countdown in the message of countdown, brother Brandham records spiritual advancement. This is a key thought. Now he connects spiritual advancement moving in concert with scientific advancement. We've gone from the horse and buggy to the rocket or the spaceship or whatever more over men in space. And while that was happening, the gospel also was advancing. And he said, why asked one place, why didn't this invention happen many centuries ago? He said they wouldn't have believed it back then. Right? &gt;&gt; See, and then why didn't God reveal the things that are revealed to you now way back in Luther's age? It wasn't for that age. And the people wouldn't, unless the people had uh unless God had ordained that there would be a people that could be illuminated at that level, they wouldn't have believed it back then. And you wouldn't have believed the messenger. You would not have believed Luther if you if you had the calling you have now. Luther said terrible things about the Jews. Smoked a pipe and drank beer. &gt;&gt; And I just don't think you'd be following that kind of a messenger. &gt;&gt; But the people at that time did &gt;&gt; and that was for them at that time. And yet he was a great messenger from God. &gt;&gt; And the rest of it you leave to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You follow that? And so in the in the message things are to be the prophet said now in this world that we live in its education, its science, civilization, all of these things that we so seemingly enjoy and we do enjoy them. You enjoy the vehicle you drive perhaps. I expect you do the home that you live in and the conveniences which we have which science has brought to us education has brought to us and the thing that the things that you do know you're glad that you know you don't want to know less in this day what you've achieved what you've learned and what man has passed on down through the centuries to us we don't want less we're happy we have what we have but these two kingdoms are are going simultaneously in concert one with the other. And we are living in a world that has both the kingdom of God and life and the kingdom of Satan and death. &gt;&gt; And we are in contact with both of them. And he said these things that we so seemingly enjoy today is of Satan and will perish. &gt;&gt; This civilization, he goes on to say, is by Satan. And so I want you to see there's a there's a band here uh of uh of of uh of the kingdom of the world. It's the science and all of these advancements which are of Satan but it is here in this present world. And that is why Jesus said we are in the world but we are not of the world. &gt;&gt; You follow that of course and I need to lay this. He said Genesis 4 proves it. Cain's son started this this civilization, building cities and organs and so forth. And civilization came by knowledge. Knowledge is what the devil sold Eve in the Garden of Eden and can and caused her to transgress God's commission. The Eden that God created, the Eden that God looked upon and saw and said, "It's very good." was not this one. &gt;&gt; It was the one he had finished. &gt;&gt; And when he completed it, he looked upon that kingdom. He looked upon that realm, which was a supernaturally created realm. He and he looked on it and said, "It's very good. And that is happens to be the pattern or the example that we can look for or look at and use as an example. Now because that perfect creation was lost in the fall, hear me. Because that perfect creation was lost in the fall of man. We do not really know fully what it was really like. you would agree with me thus far. And God has given us in the last day. He's given us some special prophetic insight into some of the things that took place back there and what kind of a uh what kind of a kingdom, what kind of a uh uh uh a government administration that we are going to because we now have here heard things of of the millennium. We've heard things of Eden that we haven't heard before. H how sin came, the original sin which has given us such an insight into the sacrifice, into the blood, into the high priest uh and his office uh of what Jesus came to do. We have such insight into that and what the new Jerusalem will be like and what the millennium will be like. We we've heard those things. You hear those things. We hear of our theophony which is right near us and tying it back to Apostle Paul. If this tabernacle of this house be dissolved, we have another eternal in the heavens. What glorious truth and yet brother Brandham didn't invent those words. He simply as a prophet was directed and anointed to bring us to that word because it's for the people of this age. And that's why you didn't hear it perhaps in your previous life or when I said not previous life but your earlier life and whatever church denomination you were in. So now there's much that could be said about the order and the perfect harmony of the first Eden. Brother Brandham says in the Garden of Eden was God's economy of innocence. And that's an important statement in my service this morning. It was an age of innocence. So this economy when God looked on it and said it's very good. It was an age. It was an era of innocence, of purity, of holiness. It was just natural to be holy. &gt;&gt; There was no sin. And that's why it was so magnificent in its harmony because automatically fellowship was there with a holy God and a holy child, a holy son and his bride. It was a marvelous. We can't all we can do is try to imagine what that was like. But here comes a prophet. I've never heard anyone else call it an economy of innocence. An age of innocence. It's a marvelous statement &gt;&gt; really when you think about it because innocence is the condition of being free from evil. &gt;&gt; And all you and I can do as people who were born sinners is try to imagine what that's like to be free from evil. &gt;&gt; Never having a thought of any kind that comes and afflicts you. Never having some attitude that raises up within you. Never having a moment when your heart feels wrong about something or someone or some issue. There were no issues. &gt;&gt; There was no there was nothing to taint the mind. Just think the mind of of the of Adam and Eve had instant and immediate contact with God. Nothing was they never had to say forgive me father. &gt;&gt; They never had to give any kind of they never had a taint upon them. Oh, we can only imagine that. But how marvelous that that was the age of innocence. And so that was the only age. And to be innocent is blameless, pure, clean, faultless, guiltless, never had a thought of any guilt on their mind. Harmless, immaculate, righteous, sinless, spotless, virtuous. Now as I have given those various words which are the meaning of innocent, you have some idea then why a prophet messenger in this day came and used those same words concerning the bride of Jesus Christ that she is innocent. She's guiltless. She's spotless. She's virtuous. She's pure. She's holy because this word of God who this word of God that was disbelieved back there had to be believed again and we had to come the full cycle &gt;&gt; in the message masterpiece. Now I'm moving very very carefully. He said his enemy came into this marvelous age of purity, innocence, and his enemy, God's enemy, crept in &gt;&gt; and he said he came in and found this great masterpiece and by deceit he crawls under the garden wall, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then he marred this beautiful masterpiece. It was he called it the masterpiece family and Satan came in and he marred it so that it fell. And the Smyrnian church age said Adam took innocence and turned it into guilt. And this one speaking of the second Adam, Jesus Christ, he took guilt &gt;&gt; and turned it into righteousness. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Adam took a paradise and turned it into a waste howling wilderness. But this one &gt;&gt; is coming back to turn an earth &gt;&gt; rocking and reeling with destruction into another Eden. &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you in that Eden innocence will reign once again. It'll be another age of innocence. He'll be an age of purity, holiness, righteousness where none of the past will be, the scripture says, remembered anymore. &gt;&gt; What a joy it is to for us to sit here and have that promise right there, not only before us, but in us. &gt;&gt; No more tears. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No more sorrow. &gt;&gt; No more aching heart. &gt;&gt; No more guilt. &gt;&gt; No nothing even rising up within. Welling up within. It's gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's passed. &gt;&gt; And to the believer, we can say the victory's already won. &gt;&gt; The joy bells are already ringing. &gt;&gt; And your faith claims the promise. Like the little child claims the ice cream cone. just promised to it. I'm going to Daddy's going to buy an ice cream cone and they're delighted with it. &gt;&gt; Oh, they're happy. They start clapping their hands. &gt;&gt; We can clap our hands. We already have this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's already ours. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Adam took a life of fellowship and joy with God and turned it into a desert, a spiritual dark, darkness, and brought forth all sin, moral decay, pain, and suffering and delusion and corruption and wars within the souls of man. So the first Eden had innocence and then the second Eden will have innocence restored. If we consider and think about for a moment the age that we are living in and compare it with the age of innocence, we get some idea of what crept under the garden wall. Say, well, I can scarcely compare an age of innocence. It's hard to even imagine it because of the age that we're in contact with. It's a terrible vial. We can scarcely you can scarcely a evade and ev avoid or evade. They're are going to impose it on you in the restaurant and in the malls and in the newspaper and through all sorts of media and out of the mouths of your peers whether they're women or men or children all kinds of vulgarity and innuendos and stories and whatever more and it's going to be imposed on you &gt;&gt; whether you like it or not. This is the age. And so that we have a a a a twophase double kingdom. One a layered one on top of the other. We're living in this one, but there is another one. And the believer is living in that one. &gt;&gt; Satan's kingdom. was not established immediately. But everything that we see and experience today was in Satan's evil heart and mind when he crept under the garden wall. Everything you see today was in his intention when he crept in. It didn't happen immediately in Eden, but it it had its beginnings there. What we see today had its beginnings at that time. And I can say that everything that God had in his mind when he created the perfect Eden, hear me now. Everything he had in his mind when he created that perfect Eden is still in his mind. And he will not be deterred. He will not be deterred aside. He will restore it completely. I heard the song that Sister Leslie Anne sang in the choir. I will restore. I think we could say it as a as a phrase of a faith in our heart. I will restore, sayeth the Lord. Let's say it together. I will restore, sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah. It's not Ed Biscal or you saying it. It's the Lord said it. I will restore, say the Lord. What will he restore? He'll restore that first Eden exactly as the age of innocence. It will be in all of its glory and purity. And by God's grace, we will be there. says, "And Cain," this is how it began, "and Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bare Enoch, and Enoch builded a city." Notice how close we have an Enoch also that was is a type of the bride, the seventh from Adam. But you'll find in Cain's lineage, there's almost duplications of the same. It still is today. &gt;&gt; So close. that even the elect would be deceived if it were possible. &gt;&gt; Thank God it's not possible. &gt;&gt; And Cain knew his wife and bear bear Enoch. And Enoch and Enoch builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch. And Enoch builded a city. Here's what a city is. Now things are changing. Now I'm introducing this kingdom that we live in and that we deal with. A city in the ancient times was a a walled perhaps a a ring of houses that was joined by a wall. And the wall of course is for protection. But a city is understood as being a wall or fortified place. protecting a group of houses or other social structure, economic or political or administrative structure. Now, we have something introduced that God did not introduce. He didn't introduce a city, but Cain's son introduced a city. A city is a place that has a social development sufficient to support the population and sustained by enough uh different food resources because you get a group of people. Now there comes the responsibility of how do we care for them and and uh we have now the concerns of not just a family or perhaps a tribe of people because in ancient times you know you'd have a family and then the family would grow and it would be the extended family you'd have the seniors there and the children and the grandchildren and perhaps the great grandchildren. Finally it would get large enough. So this was almost like Abraham became regarded as a as I mean he almost had a tribe of people because he had all of his men. Remember when he armed 300 that were I believe it was 300 that were uh raised up born in his own in his own household or his own encampment. So they would have encampments then it would get you know uh they would they would unify perhaps with another and finally they would get to be a city. So now as soon as you had a city then the structure a structure had to come into place. The people had to design a structure to be able to start to care for the people. And so they would need perhaps security because there would be a other one that now wants to take this one's better wells and better feeding uh places and grazing lands. And so now war is introduced. And because war is introduced, military has to be introduced and a structure to care for the people that was outside of God's original program. &gt;&gt; You see where I'm going? &gt;&gt; There had to be something introduced to care for the people. And so the cities, the city serves as a religious center, as a cultural center, as an economic center, and a base for military. Who's going to care for us? Who's going to look after this administration? Who's going to who's going to guide it? Who's going to watch over this? And so finally, uh, cities required more and more development. And finally, there'd be nations. And that's why nations fought against nations. And that's why the scripture says they'll there's a place in the time they'll teach war no more. such as we have. And so now you have to see and then the Bible speaks of the cities of the Amorites and the cities of the Hittites. And these cities then grew to be kingdoms. And the Bible says God speaking to the woman after the fall says and and to the woman he said I will not multiply I will greatly multiply because he said to Adam and Eve be fruitful and multiply but now after the fall he said you will greatly multiply and sorrow thy sorrow and thy conception I'll multiply thy I'll multiply ly thy sorrow and thy conception, and in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children. Then it wasn't long, but into Genesis 1, Genesis 6 and1 rather, and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, and they looked upon them, and saw they were very fair. And so then there was a union between Adam's lineage and Cain's lineage. I should say Abel or Seth's lineage and and Cain's lineage and then God looked upon that. But now I just want you to see the multi multiplication and the cities and the kingdoms which had to result out of that. And we don't just want to say city, kingdom, nation. We want to think about what kind of system managed, looked after, cared for, and that the people became subjects of that system, that government system. Now, in the end time, friends, in the end time, I'm taking a quantum leap to the end time. And you have a messenger came, every government &gt;&gt; is of the devil. education, science, the things that we so enjoy because it's all in this realm. It's all in this dimension that was introduced when Satan came under the garden wall. He had that plan and now it has risen to its apex, shall I say, at the end time until until even a prophet would have to come and say, "This is Satan's Eden. Whether you like it or not, &gt;&gt; we seemingly enjoy some of the things. He's not saying don't enjoy it. I mean, do do the best that you can. But we we as believers must bear in mind this kingdom is designed by Satan. &gt;&gt; And I should have a hearty &gt;&gt; amen to that. &gt;&gt; We work in it. We receive salaries for it. We have to live in homes. We utilize the technology. We utilize the advancement. We utilize the education. But we must not be tied to it. &gt;&gt; We must not have it dictate to us. &gt;&gt; Because we are of another kingdom &gt;&gt; and that kingdom is within you. &gt;&gt; That kingdom is a holy kingdom. It's contrary to this kingdom. And that is why the flesh is contrary to the spirit because the flesh is tied into this kingdom and the spirit is tied into another kingdom. So in questions and answers, he said, "Now those people speaking of the great signs and wonders in Israel." And then he sent men to spy out uh spy out one out of each tribe. Now we have the tribes of Israel. And Moses is now he's now uh at at Kadesh and he's sending these spies out to to see this land. And when they came back they had a bunch of grapes taken by two men. Took two men to pack it. And when they went back, instead of rejoicing, because they had a taste of the grapes, instead of that, they went back to their tribes and said, "Oh, but we have seen great walled cities of the Philistines or of the Hittites or of the Parizzites." And they said, "And they are giants and we look like grasshoppers beside them." Says they he said they went to the borderline. They were borderline believers and they came up to the real thing and saw the promise and felt that their they weren't weren't able to go over and take the promise. I said that because although that was back in Moses time that happens to be here today. November the 18th I believe 2007 is exactly the same thing for exactly the same reason. They were seeing the development of this kingdom uh of this operational kingdom that Satan was putting into place. Here we are looking back maybe 3 4 thousand years and now they were coming to a rather primitive but they saw a walled city. Men had gathered themselves into walled cities and they had they had made themselves to appear fearsome and these people had perhaps fought wars and taken lands and had slain other tribes and whatever more and now there are wall cities. Now here's God's people operating in another level having a prophet with the word coming from another dimension &gt;&gt; telling them go into that land and take it. I have given it to you. But when they saw what the other kingdom had established, they became fearful. &gt;&gt; How many people have not received this message because they've seen their great denominational system? &gt;&gt; Said, "How how do we how do we do this? How how do we uh you know, I I have a certain apprehension within me because this is so well established. How many ministers saw this and and and brother Brandham even said they spoke with him. I've spoken with them. I've spoken to one that was my pastor in Toronto and I and my wife sitting in the room talking about this very message. And he was so moved in his heart. He said, "I never saw such things as I saw in brother Brandham's meetings in Windsor." And he knew it was the truth. And out of his wife's mouth and God bless her very is a woman. She's concerned about home and things. She's and his name was Edmund. Well, Edwin, remember our pension? Because they were getting up in years and they had to think about their future and the system guaranteed them their retirement &gt;&gt; and they had to think about their system and had to think about their future and that bound them to it. &gt;&gt; And he wasn't able to listen to his heart. The grapes taste wonderful. I never saw such power. I never felt such presence. I've never seen such truth as I seen this message. But there's a fear. There's an apprehension in my heart. &gt;&gt; And that's the two kingdoms &gt;&gt; abiding at the same time. We've seen great walled cities and they became borderline believers. Now we arrive at time when the civilization that was introduced by Satan in Eden is putting fear into their hearts. And I don't want to just say outside of this church, outside of those that are listening to the voice, but as soon as we say and we bring the things that are imposed upon us, we say, "Well, how will we live? If I listen to my heart, how will I survive? If I move there, how will I h how will I sustain myself? If I pay my tithes, how am I going to pay my bills? And things that are clearly in the word of God and but we become fearful. We become apprehensive because the system that we're living in has imposed other things upon us. Now it's quiet, but you ought to be getting more boisterous all the time. &gt;&gt; This world has imposed. And remember, it's not this world. It's Satan in this world. &gt;&gt; This is Satan's kingdom, &gt;&gt; Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; And we stand against it with everything that's within us because we are not of this world. We're not of this kingdom. We're not part of this Eden. Thank God for that. I want to declare it. &gt;&gt; And yet I believe use it. Use it all you can. Use the mammon up. Use it for the kingdom of God. Use it for the betterment of your family. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Make all you can. Give all you can. &gt;&gt; You're here as a instrument. &gt;&gt; Get all you can here and pass it up into the next kingdom. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you don't understand me, just hang on to your seats. You will in a little while. They said, "These spies said, we came to the land whether thou sentest, and surely it flowth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it. Surely it flows with milk and honey." this kingdom that God, these promises that God has given us flows with milk and honey. Now, many people hadn't got there yet, but they had to believe the spies. Maybe some of you folks haven't experienced, you know, uh, all the glories and the marvelous thing and say, "Oh, I wish I could have that." Well, that's fine. You just keep drudging on and you'll have it, too. &gt;&gt; It'll be yours as well. You keep believing the promise and you'll come to where the others have come. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe it, well, then you won't enter into it. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great. And moreover, we saw the children of Anch there. Sometime when we look out in the world and we see as David did. David was a marvelous king of Israel but he looked at others and he wondered how do the evil people who live so wickedly do so well. Why is it that they prosper? Why is it looks like they don't have the same problems that we have? But then he considered the end. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what you need to think about. You need to keep the end in front of you. Hallelujah. And when you look at the end, you realize they're having their best time right now and you're having your worst time right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. This is your worst time. It's not that bad when you think it's my worst time because I have my savior walking with me. I have the token within me. I've got the message of the hour. This is not that bad. We can survive anything. Whether it be in life or whether it be in death. Whether we live a short time or a long time. This is God's time that he put us here. &gt;&gt; I'm staying fairly close to my notes for a specific reason because I felt very very directed of God in this thought. I want you to hang on to it. Listen to it closely. The system necessary to operate our society is contrary to spiritual life. I want to say that again. The system that is necessary to operate our society, it is contrary to spiritual life. That is why Apostle Paul says the spirit and the the carnal man, they're at war with one another &gt;&gt; because the carnal man can never please God in that sense of the world in that sense of the word. And the spirit cannot that that holy spirit within us cannot feel at home in the world that we have to live in. And so we as individuals we have this uh uh we have this what do I say this uh feeling within ourselves that is uh it it's a it's not one of complete union. We can't be in union with the world. The system for example imposes demands upon the people that often choke the life of the spiritual blessing. The whole system of civilized of civilization requires a higher level of education, &gt;&gt; a higher level of skills which are not available in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Right? So that is why what we have now, you know, we've developed into cities and we've developed into nations and we've developed into all different of types of identities. But and so we require things the the organism requires things that was not required in the wilderness when we were just an encampment. If you can put yourself back say we were just an encampment of rural people. We didn't need all of these things. We didn't need to be taxed to the eyebrows to support our police and our firemen and our protection and our highway systems and all those things. I'm I'm not saying that these things are wrong. We are here. God put us in this place. But he does not want us to be so imposed that system so imposed upon us that it just chokes out the spiritual part. And I have a very specific reason for bringing this this way. Many good wholesome young people, for example, good wholesome young people that lived on the farm. And if you go to the prairies of the Midwest, you'll find that the farms are are vacated. The buildings are just being whitened with age. And the people have left the farms and have moved to the &gt;&gt; cities. But when they come to the city, they have certain things imposed on them that never was out on the farm. &gt;&gt; If you got angry out at the farm, you might take a stick and throw it at the cow or take an old root off the ground and strike a tree and wear off your, you know, anger, but that's about all you could do. Wasn't a whole lot to do. You look lost. The reason I can preach it, so I've been there. &gt;&gt; I've been out in the wilderness and things may be, but there isn't very much to aggravate you. &gt;&gt; There's not much to trouble you out there. Not much to even get annoyed about. You know, I get upset if I needed a prairie chicken to eat and I missed him. That was about it. But I missed that shot. Missed that nice chicken. and really frustrating. Stomp your foot, hit a tree, bang your gun on the ground. But what are you going to do? But not here. Not so now. I mean, you can give a person a piece of your mind and got cut off on the highway and all the rest of it. Hey, you're paying for that highway. Might as well enjoy it. &gt;&gt; The only reason you're quiet is I'm coming to your address. coming right to your address &gt;&gt; and I've just started &gt;&gt; and turn my watch over &gt;&gt; if I go to tonight. Brother Tom, many good wholesome young person went to the city. Then when they went to the city ah they become street wise. Now they knew how things worked. They went into the college and then they found all about the you know the unisex and uh the and uh how you know things aren't the way it was at home and they get a whole new a whole new education and now they know things that mother and dad didn't weren't able to teach them. They've learned a whole lot of things. But you know, in uh the final analyses of that is it didn't really do them good. &gt;&gt; Many went there with good morals, good standards and a and a wholesome attitude and a respect for the gospel, a respect for humanity, a respect for their fellow man. And much of it they lost it all. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it's not necessary." No, that might be true. But nevertheless, that's what happened. And what I'm trying to say is that that this whole band, this whole realm, this whole system of this world is has been designed by Satan to sap that out of a person. &gt;&gt; And spiritual amnesia, my God, help me. I've got a ways to go. He says the church has got a bad case of spiritual amnesia. He said it's got into a place of Leodysa again, back into that rich place like Israel was when it was poor and had to trust God for everything. It could do any everything that God and he broke it. It trusted God. He said then God was with it and it was and it was spiritually moved on. Spiritually moved on. But when it got rich, here's what happened. their cities built up and their women got immoral. Notice how he puts that. When they got rich, their cities built up and their women became immoral and men permitted it and their preachers let down the bar and they denounced the prophets and that's the kind of condition they got into. You know, you ought to take that phrase. It's in spiritual amnesia. Brother Brandham wasn't just lipping off some thoughts, loose thoughts. that's somehow disjointed. This was an absolute clear pattern when they got rich. And here's what happened. Their cities built up. They got finer places and their women got immoral. That's what happens in a in the cities. And their men permitted it. And their preachers let down the bar and they denounced their prophets. That happens to be a very distinct pattern of what happens. And Satan designed it. That's precisely what he planned when he crawled under the garden wall. &gt;&gt; They'll become groups. They'll become tribes. They'll become cities. They'll become nations. And they'll set up a whole system and and it will be an economic system. I'm going to design it. It'll be a military system because I'm going to design it. Their protection and so on. It designed by Satan. When the fall came, and I don't want to spend much time on this, but I'll just want to mention it. when the fall first came and and Adam and Eve now had to be driven out of this place of innocence and this age of innocence. The Bible says that they put that God placed cherubams and it says that it was on the east side of Eden where he placed these cherubams and I was very very keenly interested. I don't know if I can explain it to you just right, but east in this case is not merely east as in as opposed to west. But east in the Hebrew is that which was before from the from the ancient time or a for time or before. In other words, God was going to keep it original, &gt;&gt; right? He was not going to allow this word of life, this tree of life to be tampered with. &gt;&gt; And how in Satan's Eden today, man with his knowledge has taken this book and d this is Christ. &gt;&gt; This is exactly what was in the tree of in in the Eden as the tree of life. And they've tampered with it and they have modified it. And they have so changed it till you can go to a Bible bookstore and hardly recognize the words of this book. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; Because they have changed it. But God God guaranteed there would be an original word. &gt;&gt; And he was going to put he's going to put cherubams in the four time in the ancient time to keep it as it was &gt;&gt; and that less they less they would tamper with this. And it and he closed it to them. Closed the door &gt;&gt; and drove them out. &gt;&gt; And now a prophet comes in this end time to reveal or to open up &gt;&gt; that which was locked up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said today those same cherubams &gt;&gt; are here now &gt;&gt; to drive you back to that tree. Let's give God a praise offering. &gt;&gt; The same cherubam here now. Here now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why doesn't the congregation say same cherubam &gt;&gt; here now? &gt;&gt; Here now &gt;&gt; to drive me back &gt;&gt; to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's exactly the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; How could they be here now? Because now there was the original word coming back &gt;&gt; to the people. &gt;&gt; And that is why the system, the denominational system had to reject it &gt;&gt; because they could find no place to unify with it. &gt;&gt; It was man's system &gt;&gt; designed by Satan. &gt;&gt; And he had that in his mind when he crawled under the garden wall. &gt;&gt; Is it clear? Well, I think I've stayed enough along on that. Oh, he said, "Oh, come take the tree of life." Instead of those instead of those cherubams guiding this throne, they're out here seeking, trying to run the people, guard to the throne, trying to bring them through the gate. &gt;&gt; Back to the tree of life again. &gt;&gt; The gate that was closed, my brother, my sister, has been unlocked. &gt;&gt; The door that was locked is now open. &gt;&gt; You don't have to try to push on it. It is open. God has opened it. &gt;&gt; Ah, this is the day of the open door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's open for you. All the benefits are open for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, come. This is Elijah saying, "Oh, come to the tree of life." What kind of invitation do we need? Do you think how many people came when Jesus said, "Come unto me all ye that are burdened and heavy laden." Do you think they came? Not many. You're sitting here today and you hear a prophet's message. Oh, come. Not just come, not come to him. Not come to his church, not come to just the way he thinks things are, but come back to the tree of life because the gate has been opened. Not only that, he described it with such magnificent language. When Adam and Eve left, you young people read literature. You've never read literature like this. Never. And he says he can see them. And as a prophet, I believe he could see them. And he says, "Now they're walking out of the garden and they've got the skins that God himself clothed them in. And the skins are slapping against the great manly legs of Adam as he walks out. that perfect physique and that beautiful woman that Eve was and and puts her head over on her husband's bosom and the tears now dropping down onto her and her tears dropping down onto her body and mingling with the blood from the skins that they've been clothed on. And a prophet describes them exiting, leaving Eden and saying they can cry now. &gt;&gt; God saw that. &gt;&gt; I've always been moved when I read that. I thought, how sad, how terribly sad that is. But I I would be very very sad if we didn't have the same one who drove them out to come and say, "I'll make all things new, &gt;&gt; and there'll be no more tears. &gt;&gt; There'll be no more crying. There'll be no more sorrow." Why? because he knew that the same age that were standing there with a flaming sword, he would bring back a messenger with a flaming sword in his hand and break loose the door and send the people back in back to the tree of life again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell you what, folks, if you're not, I trust you do enjoy it, but I'm going to enjoy this word. &gt;&gt; I'm going to enjoy my salvation. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely glorious. Oh, thank God for the cherubams, the angels of the Lord that are driving us back to the tree of life &gt;&gt; here now. &gt;&gt; Oh, I say God, that your angels minister &gt;&gt; faith &gt;&gt; to the heart that needs faith. Another thing and I'm just dropping these in because I haven't got time to go into it but I bring this in so that you'll understand another important statement which happens to be one of the great stumbling blocks of the world in regards to the message and brother Brandham talks about one age being ushered into the other th this age is is fading out and it's lapping over this age and this age is picking up and carrying on to its new its new realm, its new uh what it is that it's supposed to or will actually bring into being. So, one age is being ushered out, the other age is being ushered in. And there is, as he said, there's no cut off date where this just ceases and then something else happens. When did the computer come? I'm going to talk about it in a moment or two. When did it come? Well, it's been coming all the time. It's been coming for a lot of years. It's it's come from, you know, some very very primitive thing to now we have it, you know, we have it on our pocket. When did this one age quit? That's why brother Brandham says the age of the open door. &gt;&gt; He said that promise and everything that was said there comes deep into this age. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; Now he says in the church age and here's the here's the one everybody not here but all kinds of people came. They sat in my office right here in this building and says William Brham said that 1977 will usher in the millennium. I said that's that's exactly what he said. And if you under understand usher in usher out, then you understand what usher in means. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said to him, I said, "The bride." Well, let's say we're having a wedding and and and and so someone is standing there and the bride is getting out of the car out in the parking lot and uh and a man stands up and says, "The bride is now being ushered in," which is perfectly fine. Maybe she's coming through the doors in the foyer. The bride is being ushered in. Or he's coming through the double doors here. The bride's being ushered in with an eternal God. Is that a day, a week, a month, a year, 10 years, 15 years? &gt;&gt; Samuel was 12 years old. Some of our people know this. I preached this at the in the log church. Samuel was 12 years old. God called him three times in the evening. And then in the morning, Eli, which was the priest, now this was a prophet, but he's just coming to be a prophet. He's just a boy about 12. So he comes and Eli knows knows what to do, you know, when God speaks, but he couldn't receive the word. &gt;&gt; He had no capacity to receive the word. He was now aged and his sons had become sons of bal. They' become very wicked and he hadn't he didn't have enough courage to straighten them out or to disassociate them himself from them. And so he said to Samuel in the morning, "You tell me what he said to you. And if you don't tell me, may it be worse upon you." I'm just paraphrasing it. And Samuel told him everything. Really, what he had to tell him was, "God's done with you, and God's done with this office of the priesthood, and he's going to change it." It was about 16 years or longer from that time. No, there's more. 16 I'm coming to. I think it was about 25 years that Eli then was sitting in a chair, got word that his sons had been killed in a in a war and the ark had been taken. And when the war the ark had been taken, then he fell over backwards, broke his neck and died. What was happening in that 25 years? In that 25 years, the office of the priest was being ushered out &gt;&gt; and the office of the prophet was being ushered in. It wasn't just cut off and start &gt;&gt; in the New Testament. If you had been standing there and that's what I asked this reporter of the of the of a Christian ecumenical newspaper sat here to question me on brother Brandham's ministry and I I said to him about ushering in. I said and I went through the bride thing with him. I said now uh let's go to the scripture and you're a reporter. Now you're a reporter. You're standing there and you hear Jesus and you see him weeping over Jerusalem, standing on Mount Olives and he's weeping and he's saying, "Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou this killst the prophets. If you'd only known your day of visitation, at least this your day of visitation, but now it's gone from you. Now it's passed from you." I said, "What would you report in your newspaper?" You'd say, "Jerusalem's finished. I heard it myself. I heard it right out of the mouth of the Messiah myself. It's finished. And then comes the disciples. And then comes Jesus saying, "Try ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high." And then in Jerusalem, 3,000. And these are devout Jews that came to worship there. 3,000 are converted in one day. What would you say then? This is just a couple months down the road. So now and two months down the road, it doesn't look like it's over with at all. They're having the greatest revival. They've never had anything like this. And the Holy Spirit has come. Now it's happened. I said, "Now we'll just go down about 16 years down the road." And now here's Apostle Paul, this mighty first church age messenger. And Apostle Paul comes and uh and and then he speaks to the Jews. And he says to the Jews, "It was necessary, it was needful for us to preach the gospel to you first, but seeing that you have counted yourself unworthy of eternal life, henceforth or from now on, we turn to the Gentiles." &gt;&gt; I think it's the 13th chapter, 14th chapter of Acts. And then you go to the 14th chapter it is. And the Bible says, "And they journeyed to Iconium and went into the synagogue and preached there, and many devout Jews believed on them." &gt;&gt; So I said to this reporter, when did it end? &gt;&gt; When was God done? But I said, "One thing for sure, and I say to you today, one thing for sure, the Jewish age did fade out, &gt;&gt; and the Gentile age was ushered in." And we just happen to be at the other end of the scale. The Gentile age has received a gentile messenger who said it's over. And it is indeed over and it's being ushered out. And you came in that time. &gt;&gt; And the Jewish age is being ushered in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One is being ushered out and the other is being ushered in. And exactly what he said is exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the people can say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Are you rejoicing yet? &gt;&gt; I want to preach you happy. &gt;&gt; Give me a few more minutes, please. &gt;&gt; Now he said this in order to understand the wealth of meaning involved in quotation. Behold, I set before you an open door, and no man can shut it. We must recall what has been said about each age running over into another. He's coming right into this ushering in. In order to understand the wealth of behold, I set before you an open door. Now, folks, this is not a lesson. This is not just some teaching. This isn't just going back over learning something about a previous age. I'm talking to you about the very day you're in, the very seat you're sitting in. This is applicable to you this morning. &gt;&gt; We must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another. There is an overlapping, and that's the word he uses now, a melting or a fading into rather than an abrupt end. and a clear-cut start. This age particularly flows into the next age. The Philadelphiaian age particularly of all the ages flows into the next one which is ours. So what he's saying I want to say something of the wealth of this open door. There is a treasure. There is something special. There's something spectacular about this. I place before you an open door. And now a messenger saying that is fading into this one. &gt;&gt; This has special. Are you giving me your undivided attention? This has special meaning for you, for us. He says, "Not only does this age overflow into the last age, but the last age in many respects simply a carrying on of the sixth age. The seventh age is very short. Your age is very short. It gathers up into itself in one quick work all the evil of every age &gt;&gt; and yet all the reality of Pentecost." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It brings everything forward. So everything comes. This is the aggregate age. That's why it's Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; And this is the aggregate, the sum total of everything that came on the day of Pentecost. Hallelujah. I thought I heard a testimony here. Somebody was prayed for for cancer and they were healed. &gt;&gt; That should be happening. I heard a testimony here and saw it on there and people in the congregation didn't understand the pictures we showed of Brother Ron Spencer. They thought someone even said, "Was that brother Ron Spencer some time ago?" No, that was Brother Ron Spencer about 35 days after he was burned. &gt;&gt; That was about 35 days after he was laying laying in in there that he didn't know he'd live. you've been praying for brother Gary Walker and they and the medics that flew him by helicopter from the accident said they thought that he had gone and they said he's gone all the way from death to where he is today. Hallelujah. Sitting up in bed speaking to his wife. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God. &gt;&gt; These are realities. And here's the wealth of meaning. He said it gathers it up for a quick work. And then in the Philadelphiaian age, he says, he goes on to say, because that you have taken my word and lived it and thereby become patient, I will keep you from the hour of temptation. He says, now here again, we see the overlapping of the two ages. For the promise has to do with the end of the gentile period. The promise has to do with the end of the gentile period. The gentile age or period he uses which culminates in the great tribulation. Can I have about 15 minutes? &gt;&gt; I want to just come quickly to the age of the open door. Our open door &gt;&gt; says that no man in heaven or in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book. Who's the book? &gt;&gt; Who's the book? &gt;&gt; Christ. That word is in us. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the door." Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says when the 10 foolish virgins, five wise, five foolish I should say, heard the cry, the bridegroom cometh, five had oil and went in. Five did not have oil and did not go in. The Bible says the door was shut. Christ or the word was shut. How has the word shut? The word is shut when it's fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; God never fulfilled the same promise twice. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; And if it gives a certain promise that Christ will come, he's not going to come again. He came once. The promise in the scripture, I'll send you Elijah or I'll send you a voice in the wilderness concerning John the Baptist. When John the Baptist was born and soon time, short time later he was beheaded, it was gone. &gt;&gt; That's fulfilled. And what if people said after he was gone, "Oh, I want to believe that. I want to believe that. I believe what Isaiah said. I believe it. Oh, God, forgive me. Cry all you want. &gt;&gt; The door is closed." &gt;&gt; Understand? And that's why that's why how many times in the message how many times he said even after the rapture has happened, there will be people God grant. This is my prayer while I preach. God grant there won't be anybody here have to say it. I thought Elijah was supposed to come. I thought there was supposed to be a rapture. Every time. Every time. Do you hear me? Brother Brandham said it'll be over. &gt;&gt; He never once said, "Oh, they'll reopen it." &gt;&gt; Never once will be reopened. &gt;&gt; The door is shut. And the Bible says, "And they went seeking oil." And brother Brandham said further and very clearly it was happening right in this day. &gt;&gt; That very event. And the bridegroom has come. And whether you realize it or not, you've gone into a very special place. &gt;&gt; And from here we go to the supper. &gt;&gt; From here we go to the supper. We're already shut in with him in a secret place. We're already in heavenly places. And from here we go to the supper. That's all. Hallelujah. From here we go to the supper. &gt;&gt; Says, "Now we can see that Jesus is the door. He is the door of the sheep." And notice that it speaks now of the door opening. What is it? What is that but a revelation of him? A door opening. A revelation of him. And that revelation is opening up to bring us strength &gt;&gt; to ultimate to illuminate the word and to glorify his name. &gt;&gt; You have I said before you an open door. He says you have a little strength. Brother Brandham says it involves all three. The word and the name. And now he says that has gone deep into this age where the revelation and the illumination of him, excuse me, is absolutely complete. &gt;&gt; And he illuminates the word and brings glory to his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ and his power of his coming at the end time was sealed up until this time. the revelation of Jesus Christ. Now these are his words. He he said you have I've set before you an open door. And this is what the open door he said that has such a deep meaning for this time because the al ultimate of the open door he says here is the is the uh the open door has to do with all three. He said it is the revelation, the opening up to bring us strength, to illuminate the word and to glorify his name. The revelation of Jesus Christ and of his power, of his coming and of the end time was sealed up until this time. And that and that's what he's come to do. That's what he has come to do. It's hid from the scholars, &gt;&gt; but the vision has been sealed till right now. &gt;&gt; The vision's been sealed till right now, and it's been made open. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said when he prayed, I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and the prudent and has revealed them unto babes. I hope I can just lift you up into your thoughts, high into your thoughts for a moment. I thank thee, Father. Here's the word. The door himself &gt;&gt; standing on earth &gt;&gt; in a physical form. The very door &gt;&gt; of the sheepfold standing the very door the very word in flesh standing saying I thank you father that you've closed this door. Other words I thank you that you've hid it. Why? because he was he was addressing what came under the other system that crawled under the wall. I'm glad they couldn't figure out the tree back then and they can't figure it out now &gt;&gt; and they can't figure out today. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham addresses the five foolish virgins and he said the question was are they lost? He said no they're not lost. Now, even Pentecost should learn something about that because he's got them out in outer darkness. They're in outer darkness. They haven't got light. &gt;&gt; And he is the light. But are they lost? Eternally lost. No. Said they're not. &gt;&gt; He said they're the only thing they didn't have was oil, &gt;&gt; but they're clean in every other aspect. He says they're the same. &gt;&gt; That gives us a lot of comfort. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; They are not lost. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so, friends, that helps us out. &gt;&gt; It teaches us how to uh h how to conduct ourselves around others. If they don't see the message, don't force it down their throat. &gt;&gt; God has to give them the revelation. If he doesn't give them the revelation, it's up to God. &gt;&gt; Even some that respect the respect the message and respect what it produces and respect the messenger of the hour. And if somebody just speaks in vile terms against the messenger, against the word, just walk away from it. &gt;&gt; Don't even force them. &gt;&gt; Now, okay, now here we are. God help me. Here's these whole two realms that have been going. Jesus identified one and said they they can't see the word and so on. All right. Uh in Paul's day they had ships so he used the ship. In Luther's day they had just come through with the the Gutenberg press and they used the press but no one age. Here's here's the church ages now. Can you see the church ages? One just coming into the other. Here comes a messenger and he goes back and he shows how scientific achievement took place here. One advancement, one invention mel melted into the other one and the church ages one melted into the other one into the other one. And the second last one says I give I place before you an open door. And now a messenger comes and says and he pulls that back and says that has very deep meaning up here now because it was in this age when that open door was going to be fully made open and revealed who that door was and what the purpose of it was. So it had to be at this time in the meantime all of this advancement is taking place and and one thing didn't just you know one thing just didn't end another one started. So, I thought I would just take a a couple and probably some of you know this uh have read some of these things. But here's just a few of the wise men, wise men of the world, knowledgeable men, men of high office, men who know what they're talking about. And they were talking about I wanted to know what they said about the the advancement of the computer world and so on. Thomas Watson, the chairman of IBM. He ought to know something. Chairman of IBM in 1943. Don't think that's back in the dark ages. I was living in 1943. He said, I think there is a world market for maybe five computers. is IBM chairman of IBM. I think in the world there's a world market for about five computers. The popular science mechanics or popular mechanics magazine had an article they said while a calculator is equipped with 10,000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons. Said computers in the future may have only a thousand vacuum tubes and weigh only one and a half tons. What what can you say? Oh, we've come a long ways. &gt;&gt; And spiritually I say we've come a long ways. The editor in charge of business books for Apprentice Hall, which one of the greatest and largest publications, said, "I've traveled the length and breadth of this country and talked to the best people, and I can assure you that data processing is a fad that won't last a year." When they when the microchip came out, an engineer of advanced computing systems division of IBM says, "But what what is it good for?" I think I have one right here. I don't know. There's my sound system. I guess I haven't. He says there's this Ken Olsen, president and chairman and founder of Digital Equipment Corporation in 1977. He said there's no reason why anyone would want a computer in the home. How many computers do we have in homes here? I'd like to see your hands. Boy, he he didn't see what was going to be in your house. And furthermore, he didn't see what was going to be on your computer. He didn't dream that there'd be a voice of a man coming through on that computer. He didn't dream because that had been shut out from him. &gt;&gt; If you'd have told him just from 1977, that's not long ago. How many people were here in 1977? I mean alive in 1977. Let me see your Oh, look at all these old-timers. My goodness. You were here in 1977 and you had the president and chief executive officer of digital systems saying that there isn't any use for you to even have one in your home. You think for a moment if you got back then said, "I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Ken Olson, president. I respect you, but you haven't got a clue. I'm going to sit I'm going to sit in my computer and I'm going to be able to actually I'm going to pull up uh I'm going to pull up messages of a prophet of God that have been translated in other languages and they're actually coming down into my computer. They're coming down on a on a daily basis. They're coming down and I even have the voice of that messenger on there &gt;&gt; and I listen to over,00 sermons on there. Can you believe that? He'd say, "Ah, nonsense. Do you know who you're talking to? And then you have to say, you know who you're talking to. &gt;&gt; Don't lose me now. &gt;&gt; And Bill Gates. I thought that that last name, my wife was struck by it, was quite unique. Gates. Bill Gates. He opened up quite a gate, didn't he? for this system down here, but perhaps didn't realize there's going to be a group of people up here going to tap into that. So, we're going to use that for a purpose you never dreamed would ever be possible. All these voices, all this vulgarity, it does me a great deal. I'm not just preaching now. I'm going to unload the burden of my heart. It does me a great deal of satisfaction right in the midst of all that evil to push that voice through, to push it through in this language, to push it through in another language, and let the people around the world hear it. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I want to say to this church, you haven't got a clue where it's going. &gt;&gt; I don't mean just where it's going geographically, where we're going &gt;&gt; with this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By God's grace, I believe that in the future days, and not very far in the future, there'll be people be able to pull it down and and and and print it in their language. &gt;&gt; All over the world, there'll be no borders for the message at all anymore. You think that's where it's going? That's exactly where it's going. I see where there will be hundreds, maybe even thousands of individuals and pastors and and lay men and people burdened for the word that'll be in charge and they'll be printing out this message and giving it out to their out to the people of their area. Where will they be pulling it from? Right from the heavens &gt;&gt; where it should come from. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God, his people is is amazing. I don't know if you've been on and you you hear the very first tape, the very first tape that is that's even made and the first words out of Brother Brandham's mouth is they've got some kind of a new gadget here &gt;&gt; called a tape recorder. &gt;&gt; They got some kind of a new gadget. His first words on the first recorded message, they've got some kind of a new gadget called a tape recorder. and men that were faithful but didn't realize they began to record that and everybody got into the tape business or Roberts and Katherryn Kman and everybody got in disposing and sending off with their tapes etc etc but I tell you there's an allegiance there's a loyalty to what God gave uh this messenger and that voice and in the days of the voice &gt;&gt; of the seventh angel I tell you I weep every time I take people up there with brother Murphy brother Timothy brother Ivan these brothers that are translating and brother Murphy is is is o overlaying the voice over and other brothers whether they be in voice of God studios or where they are anywhere in the world. I'm so thankful to God that that voice is going up in the midst of all this other nonsense and in the midst of all this other rift wrath in the midst of all this violence is a pure word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you listening to me? A bleeding word. In the midst of all of that is a bleeding word. &gt;&gt; It's called Christ. The door's been opened and no man can shut it. &gt;&gt; No man can shut it. &gt;&gt; They've tried to shut it. &gt;&gt; They've tried to say all kinds of nasty things, but the more they said, the further it went. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And today over a hundred million websites and billions of pages, billions, you never live long enough. Science is moving on and education at such a at a such a pace. And the prophet said in the image to the beast, he said, "We're moving on. Science is moving on. Education's moving on. And the gospel is moving on. &gt;&gt; I hope you're as excited about this as I am. &gt;&gt; I want to tell this church today because I have a personal a very personal burden in my heart. I believe I'm going to live to say it. I believe there'll be a access to the message. Might say, "Well, it's on the internet now. You haven't seen anything yet. You haven't seen anything." see people in little corners of the world where they can scarcely get it. I can see that the translations will be coming in to a center and they'll be able to tap in and those translations will be in their language will be downloaded in a matter of hours &gt;&gt; and I'm speaking about ourselves in India. We get a translation and it might take weeks or months before we can get it printed and distributed. Do you hear what I'm saying? I'm talking about a translator maybe in India giving a translation. It'll be uploaded and downloaded into a person's into their computer and being printed within hours of the brother having it finished. &gt;&gt; Brother Timothy Maul right now is in the Vietnam. Do you know that I know that I know the men I I've been in Singapore. I know the men that have struggled to get the message into Vietnam. And here God somehow brings a man by into this church. This is the door. This this to me is a great door. He didn't know my name. He didn't know the name of this church. I didn't know his name. He never asked to meet us or anybody here. Timothy M. I never asked to meet him. I didn't know he existed. He brings God brings the two together for one great purpose of his. And then what is the purpose? to get that gospel out, to get that message out, to get that word out, and to have several hundred now, over 300 messages in Vietnamese, and he's there right now with pastors and giving them access and people over there translating the messages, and he's correcting them. We have three translators, if not four, in China that are translating, three of them full-time. One is in New Zealand every day. Every day translating every day. and they come and pass back and forth on this great great system that that this uh the system of the world has opened up to us. But God is using it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the days of Jesus, it was the Roman Empire, the great Roman Empire. And in a in the age of the open door prior to that, we have the great British Empire. And they according to what I was able to discover there was 85 nations 85 nations countries all of Canada is one Australia is another New Zealand is another the entire continent of India was another but 85 were in that British Empire you say they colonized the world and the all the kingdoms of the world had war and strife and fighting over it but at the same time God was in it. God was allowing it because those people who would never have spoken English now had to speak English. And English becomes the language of business. Lingui English is the language of the travel industry. &gt;&gt; Let me give you I have I have a statistic right here. China has more English-speaking people in it today than the United States has. Do you know why? Because they're whole. They're obsessed. They're gripped by business. Business must go ahead. And China is a great dynamic force today. It is an incredible dynamic force. And so the second language in all of China is for English to be taught. &gt;&gt; So they're teaching English to the people. Why? So they can have the economic system down here working. But why is God allowing it? God wants it. God's promoting it. So those people can hear also the messenger &gt;&gt; and we're in support of it. This church ought to ought to be thankful to God that God, you give a tithing, you give an offering, you give something, you give of yourself. I'm calling this morning on this church. I'm calling on the people of this church to give themselves physically and unreservedly to whatever God may call you to do. We cannot do this by one or two people or 10 people. We got very devoted people, incredibly devoted people. And if you just say, whether I mop a floor or whether I have a shovel in my hand or whether I just count out some books or whether I look after this or whether I'm just able to only pray and give of my offerings, I let you know, friends, I want you to know it is it is far worth far more than anything else you can accomplish in this world. &gt;&gt; I think of the brothers that give themselves give themselves freely. Deacons give themselves. Trustees give themselves. We need you. &gt;&gt; We need you. And I'm done. I've been long. I have been gripped by this scripture and a great door and effectual is opened unto me. Brother Timothy or rather brother Murphy when this is already burning on my heart down Murphy'sboro and brother just brother Murphy and myself sitting and I said to brother brother Derek may have been there but I said to brother Murphy did you ask to meet me said no and I said and I never asked to meet you I didn't I didn't know you from anybody and yet your footsteps are ordained in such a way and we meet and all I'm not able to do what you're able to do. I don't know Chinese, but I know there's 1.3 billion people over there and the fact that we're able to even reach a handful. Incidentally, yesterday some of our people were arrested. pastor and some of the people as they came out of the water of baptism were taken right then yesterday day before yesterday Friday. You can't go over there and shake their hand and say, "I'm going to pray for you." You can't get to where they're being held. But one thing for sure, listen. One thing for absolutely certain on every person listening. The prophet of God said that that age of the open door is coming deep into this age. &gt;&gt; And he wanted to get the meaning of the open door to us. It says the meaning of the open door. It is in you have little strength. the word, the revelation, the illumination of the word. And he he he gave and the word itself, those three things, those people have embraced what they've heard. &gt;&gt; And what they've heard has come from the brothers that fellowship right here in this church. It has come through people such as brother John Lei, brother John Sacker, brother brother Murphy, brother and to us don't make the mistake of saying well you know yeah there are brothers etc. Don't belittle what God is doing through these brothers. It is an enormous work and don't belittle what God is doing in your own in your own circle. You may say, "Well, what what are we able to do?" I tell you, every member of the body of Christ have their part. I don't care what it is. I don't care if it's one of these children that puts 25 cents in the mission offering plate. It's going to go someplace. It's going to go to a good cause. And furthermore, I say to this congregation, we give more out for missions than comes in the missions missions offering. It goes more than that goes out. Now, brother Brennham, he spoke about that last age and he says they're handing out tracks and handing out booklets and handing out things and they built schools and built these kind of things over there and Bible schools and so on. Says we're not into that. But let me just make one very clear distinction. when you hand out a message because he said it's the preaching of the gospel with power. And he said when you hand out I'm saying when you hand out a message book, you're handing out a sermon. &gt;&gt; You're not handing out a tract. &gt;&gt; You're not just handing out a book that somebody wrote. That that message book happens to be preaching. &gt;&gt; It is preaching and the clearest preaching that I know of. And then the works need they absolutely have to have ministry. Brother Tony has gone and will be going again I think to India and uh and there's something being planned right after the first of the year because there's there's great needs amongst the ministry and amongst the churches for those things. Brother that's why brother Timothy's over there now. That's why brother Murphy goes every year there. And I'm I just say to the congregation, I had a very very very heavy heart when brother Murphy was over this year and we had the first time to share it when when he was with me in Murphy'sboro and I said I was very burdened for you and quite frankly I'm not one to be dictated by fear but I was I was somewhat fearful that you'd be arrested because when we were arrested. They told us that if a Chinese if a Chinese who has a dual citizenship is arrested, they said we will they do away with the Canadian passport and deal with them as as a a national. They said they've been in prison for over a year and do not have a date set even for a court hearing. Brother Murphy told me while he was there and was now planning to make a trip to a certain place to be with a certain man that that man had a phone call from the police saying we know that this Murphy is coming there and if he does there is big serious trouble and that brother called brother Murphy said don't come. Now, that's just how how critical it is at times. And I just said to Brother Murphy, you happen to be Brother Brandham's voice to that nation. &gt;&gt; As far as I know, there's not another single one tape of Brother Brham's voice going over there from anywhere else. I don't know if there is. If there is, I don't know anything about it. But now we have here, and I I and I'm trying to close. I have here is a very very unusual gathering. Very unusual church. There's people of probably between 35 and 40 nations in this church. That happens to be very unusual. Number two, there's people here probably 40% from the from the US side. Probably at least 40%. And I tell you, you you may have wondered sometime why in the world are we here? Well, one reason you're here is because you've been a great great comfort to me and you've been a great asset to this church and you have brought an essential uh something essential from the American culture that we don't have and it was needful for getting the message where it is today. And I felt I needed to express myself. I groan each time I go across the border. And I know that you do. But I'll just tell you in the name of the Lord. Your labor is not in vain. &gt;&gt; Time you spend at the border is not in vain. Your giving is not in vain. Your presence is not in vain. You've come to the you've come to the to the to to the vineyard at this season. We all have. We've come to the v vineyard at this season like Esther did. And we're here on behalf of those that are still striving to be to be liberated and be found and be found and to be set free. And I will say to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, if if I don't live to see it, you will if the Lord Jesus terries. And you'll be hearing of this message going into places and corners of the earth that have hitherto been completely unthought of into distant places into the interior of China into Europe and places where it's so restricted. This message is going to go and I I I'd like to have a yay and amen from you if you believe it. Every last elected seed will come. &gt;&gt; And I would like to think that this is a unique place. I didn't design this place. I didn't ask you to come here. God brought you here. &gt;&gt; I didn't even ask to come here myself. I thought I lost my my better sense, my better judgment when I came here. We're all strangers and pilgrims. &gt;&gt; I came 3,500 miles to be here. And many of you did. We didn't choose that. I sit back and I marvel in this congregation. Very few people from this. Brother Brandham said, "How many people from Jeffersonville?" Just a handful. How many people here from Cloverdale? Just a handful. How many people even here from this area that were that aren't here because of the church? Just a handful. But then if we said, "What about the rest of you?" Those are the ones out of the Jefferson Valley Tabernacle. They're the ones that really took a hold of it and spread and got under the burden. And I would say, "God bless you as a congregation. God bless you in your homes. God bless you in your labor. God bless you and your spiritual walk with God. And I trust that the meetings and the things that God does here are divinely ordained of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And I trust you will accept this &gt;&gt; out of the bosom of my soul. &gt;&gt; That's the only way it's going to happen. And that's the way it is happening. But I but but I don't want you to restrict your vision this morning. These men were wise that thought of the the system of this world. And I'm closing with this. They were wise men. And then now the things that they said just a few years ago are humorous. Our young people are humored. Bill Gates telling you you there isn't a person that needs over 640K. And I say there isn't a person who raised their hands that has 640K. You're in the gigabytes. multi- gigabytes. You're into doing things that he didn't even dream of just a few years ago and he's still not an old man. Likewise, spiritually, let us not be, you know, restricted and bound in our mind. Let's see the possibilities. The door of opportunity is open to this congregation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not just going to go on. There's more happening under just under the current than you even realize. I want you to I want you to catch a hold of that vision and say, "God, I may not understood everything was in my heart, but I'm going to believe what Brother Bisll was saying this morning. I'm going to believe it. I'm going to support it. I'm going to pray for it with all my heart and soul. I'm going to pray for those that are involved. I'm going to pray for those that give themselves. If I can't do anymore, that's one thing I can do." God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand for our I'm sorry I was a half an hour over what even intended on being the musicians here. We had a phone call this last week and a lady was on the phone. She said, "I understand I heard from somebody that you people used to have this log log house log church down here." Said, "Yeah." She says, "Well, there's a huge chandelier." I had the chandelier made. It's about 16 to 20 feet across with just a whole big ring of lights and up at the top's probably about a six foot chandelier. said, "We'd like to give it to you. You just want to come and take it down." So, some of you old-timers that know how heavy it is. You can be the next ring of volunteers. If we decide to take it, we got to just take it down and dismantle it. It's not much. Just a little job. Did I see your hand up, brother David Laws? Yeah. Good. Good. I got one of her. How great is our God? How great is his name? Let's be here on early this evening. Hallelujah. We don't know what God's I've asked God today already to take over control of the meeting. Take over control. Hallelujah. How great is our God? How great is his name? He's the greatest forever the same. He roll back the water by sea and you put your trust in me. How great is our God. God his name. He's the greatest forever. He [Music] will [Music] sing that last verse again. And I was all locked into the first verse with my eyes shut. So help me sing this last one again. How great is our God. How great is his word. He's the greatest. [Music] And [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Hallelujah. Going to ask our brother Bohan, brother Andrew's father, if you'd come and pray for us to do that. How great is our God? [Music] and he [Music] moan to ask God's blessing upon the congregation. May the Holy Spirit have prevail in every single life. Amen. Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you that you have called us at such a time as this. Lord, father, we thank you that the open door has embraced us. You stood at the door, Lord Jesus, and you received us. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we accepted you. We came to know you. You made known yourself to us. &gt;&gt; You revealed the Godhead to us. &gt;&gt; Father, today we see you moving in your church. &gt;&gt; We see you moving in this congregation. We see you moving with the message in its last throws, Father, across this world. &gt;&gt; And we are recipients of this message &gt;&gt; and we are carriers of this message. Eternal Father, how blessed we are today to be involved. How blessed we are to be included. And Father, as we come to the next phase, we pray that the same glory that brought us to this stage would be the same glory to take us to the next stage. Father, we come humbly being unworthy before you. And Lord, knowing that our lives are just fading out too and that the end is approaching us, Father, and there's a desperation in our hearts that Lord, we must accomplish what was planned and prefigured before for us. And so we pray today that the spirit of the Lord God will give us the next step and you will show us the next door and the next opening and the next father and the next and the next and oh God we will be oh Lord worthy servants to proceed into these open doors. We thank you for this message. We thank you for this challenge this morning. &gt;&gt; We thank you for our pastor and with the revelation you have given to him. Oh God, you have brought us mysteriously unto this place. And father, the spirit of the Lord God is in this place. Father, help us. We pray as we go give us jouring mercies now in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. Thank you so much. We bless you. We just miss you in Jesus name. meeting has been long, but I want you to be get a little refreshment and rest for this evening. If you see those from on the other side of the border and they wish to stay for this evening, give them an invite to your place. God will bless you for it. Things we can do. God bless you. You're all dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] [Music] Come on now. [Music] took place and lodged a piece of steel in his arm against the main nerve and lost use essentially of his arm. is in incredible incredible pain. I wonder brother DJ would you come also brother Andy's brother Ernie brother Cotle why don't you come and join us All right.
