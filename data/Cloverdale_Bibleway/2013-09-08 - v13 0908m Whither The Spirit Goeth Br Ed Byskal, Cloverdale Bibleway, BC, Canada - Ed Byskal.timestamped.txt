[13:25] When the Lord does something, it's
[13:27] permanent. When we do something, it can
[13:29] fade. It can be temporary. But when he
[13:31] puts his stamp,
[13:32] &gt;&gt; it's over.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; When the world stamps you, they've
[13:36] stamped you. But we've made a choice.
[13:38] We've made a decision. We're going the
[13:39] Lord's way.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Father, I see that you are drawing
[13:48] a line in the sand. And I want to be
[13:52] standing by your side,
[13:56] holding your hand. So let your kingom
[14:00] come.
[14:02] Let it live in me. This is my praise.

[18:30] you, Lord, for salvation this morning.
[18:33] We thank you for the blood, Lord. We

[19:30] serve a risen savior?
[19:32] &gt;&gt; He's not just in the world today, but
[19:33] he's living
[19:35] &gt;&gt; in you and me. Hallelujah.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's something to be excited
[19:39] about, friends. Lord, you can get pumped
[19:42] up about anything, but God can give you
[19:45] a real revelation by the stimulation of
[19:47] his Holy Ghost
[19:49] &gt;&gt; that can do something for you. Amen. We
[19:52] love you this morning with a great love.

[20:16] A real father loves his son so much.
[20:19] [Music]
[20:21] and he gave himself for you and for me.
[20:25] I have brother Tim come this morning.
[20:27] Pray over the request this morning.
[20:31] Amen. We just ask that the Lord would
[20:33] come and do something so supernatural
[20:35] that you can't miss it.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; He's done it so many so many times. We
[20:41] have thousands of tapes and we can't
[20:43] miss it. But he said one more time.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll come and show himself to us
[20:48] this morning. If we would gather
[20:50] together in his name, he'd be found in
[20:52] our midst.
[20:54] Want to remember a prayer request.
[20:56] Steven Laura Martin, their 5-year-old
[20:58] son, just drowned.
[21:02] It's brother Merl, Earl Martin's
[21:04] grandson.
[21:05] Remember that request this morning,
[21:09] asking for prayer for brother Henry
[21:11] Hayes, Ryan, Brother Ryan's uncle,
[21:13] undergoing chemo radiation. He's been
[21:16] told it would uh damage his hearing and
[21:19] functions and glands. Praying that the
[21:22] Lord would bring him through this
[21:23] process. Rekindle the fire within him.
[21:26] Amen. That's from the Hayes family. Want
[21:29] to remember brother Bus in Ethiopia. I'm
[21:32] sure something else will be said, but
[21:33] he's texted in a request. Just remember
[21:36] them in prayer. Hold them up in prayer.
[21:38] When God is moving, so does the enemy.
[21:40] Amen. And God is moving in Ethiopia. So,
[21:43] we want to remember those requests this
[21:45] morning. If you don't have a request on
[21:47] your heart, thank him.
[21:49] Just thank him this morning. He's done
[21:51] so very much for us. We want to give him
[21:55] thanks, Brother Tim.
[22:02] Amen. Let's let's bow our heads in a
[22:04] word of prayer.
[22:06] [Music]
[22:09] Wonderful redeemer,
[22:12] you are the lover of our souls,
[22:16] as we are standing here in your
[22:17] presence, we have arisen as worshippers
[22:20] before the King of Kings and the Lord of
[22:22] Lords to acknowledge and glorify your
[22:26] holy name. For you are worthy of all
[22:30] praise, all adoration.
[22:33] All of our love is poured out before
[22:35] you, oh God. We love you with all that
[22:37] we are.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, that we sense and
[22:41] feel and we and you are a God that can
[22:43] be felt, but we believe that you love
[22:45] us, oh God. And we're so thankful, Lord,
[22:48] that it wasn't some good thing that made
[22:50] you love us. You always loved us. We
[22:52] were in your mind before the foundation
[22:54] of the world. You were mindful of us
[22:56] this morning. And because of that, Lord,
[22:58] it wasn't something, Lord, that we could
[23:00] ever do that would make you unlove us.
[23:02] Oh God, thank you for your grace. So
[23:05] God, thank you for your mercies. As we
[23:08] come into your presence, we want all
[23:10] things to be under the blood. Lord, if
[23:12] there be any trespasses, if there be any
[23:14] any shortcomings this morning, let it be
[23:16] under the blood this morning. Oh God, we
[23:18] want to come into your presence
[23:20] unhindered. We want you to have your way
[23:22] without reservation. We want the spirit
[23:24] of God to move in power and in
[23:27] demonstration this morning as our pastor
[23:29] comes to the sacred desk. We just asking
[23:32] Lord for a special portion. Lord, you're
[23:35] here. We're here. We just believe that
[23:37] the supernatural shall take place and
[23:40] even now is taking place. If there's any
[23:42] needs in the congregation, Lord, may you
[23:44] meet them even now as they hold it
[23:46] before you, Lord. Lord, may your word
[23:49] answer every question. I was reading in
[23:52] your prophet's message this morning
[23:55] where he said, "Everyone that really
[23:58] believes is healed."
[24:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, may you grant faith
[24:04] &gt;&gt; that everyone that is sick this morning,
[24:06] there's no need that they would go from
[24:08] this place sick. Oh God, may healing be
[24:12] poured into every life. Oh God,
[24:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, we remember this man that's
[24:18] undergoing chemotherapy.
[24:20] Lord, you're the same yesterday, today,
[24:21] and forever. May you deliver him from
[24:24] the cancer. And Lord, may you give him
[24:26] the victory, not only naturally, but
[24:29] Father, may you spiritually come to his
[24:31] life. I don't know where he's at
[24:32] spiritually, but may you be his savior,
[24:35] his redeemer, and his Lord.
[24:38] And Father, be with Brother Basobosi in
[24:41] in Africa, oh God, in Ethiopia. They're
[24:44] gathering today. Lord, may the new
[24:47] believers be quickened by your word. Oh
[24:49] God, may the ministers be inspired.
[24:53] Lord, may the word go forth in power and
[24:55] in demonstration,
[24:57] even quickening your elect in that
[24:59] country. We thank you for the open door.
[25:01] We give you praise. We thank you for
[25:03] stretching forth your hand to touch your
[25:05] bride there. And Lord, we heard of a
[25:07] family this morning that lost a little
[25:10] child.
[25:12] Some things, Father, in life are just
[25:14] hard to understand.
[25:17] But Lord, our prayers, our hearts go out
[25:19] to that family. May you, the everpresent
[25:23] one who is our comfort, be their comfort
[25:26] this morning, oh God. Lord, may you meet
[25:29] the need. Comfort the mother, the dad,
[25:33] oh God. Lord, may there be something
[25:35] said or done. May there be a presence
[25:37] just come into their midst that Lord
[25:40] they'll know that you've got everything
[25:41] under control and all things happen for
[25:44] a purpose and out of them all you work
[25:46] something good and Lord we commit them
[25:48] into your hands asking your blessing now
[25:51] upon the service upon the ministry of
[25:54] the word upon the remainder of the song
[25:55] service for your glory in Jesus Christ's
[25:58] name amen
[26:04] yes if we can have the deacons come
[26:07] prepare to receive the morning offering.
[26:10] We just pray over that as they after
[26:13] they come. We're going to have a baby
[26:15] dedication this morning. Praise the
[26:18] Lord. Brother Ryan and Sister Yolena are
[26:20] going to have their little one
[26:21] dedicated.
[26:24] Why don't we sing as the deacons are
[26:25] coming getting ready? Great is thy
[26:27] faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness.

[26:36] Great is thy faithfulness,
[26:39] [Music]
[26:40] oh God, my father.
[26:45] There is no shadow
[26:49] of turning
[26:52] with thee.
[26:55] Thou changest
[26:58] not. Thy compassions
[27:02] they fail not.
[27:05] As thou hast been, thou forever
[27:12] will be.
[27:14] Let's bow our heads in prayer. Heavenly
[27:17] Father, we commit this offering to you
[27:18] this morning, Lord. the tithes that'll
[27:21] be placed from the hearts, Lord, of the
[27:23] brethren, Lord, that have labored by
[27:26] their hand even this week, even
[27:29] yesterday. Father, we pray that you
[27:31] would multiply it, Lord, that it would
[27:33] go forth and be used for the purpose in
[27:35] which you desire it. Lord, may souls be
[27:37] one to your kingdom. May those that need
[27:40] to be empowered be strengthened by it,
[27:42] Father, as they give. We pray that you'd
[27:44] bless them in Jesus' name. Amen.
[27:49] Sing the chorus together.

[27:53] is thy faithfulness.

[29:53] special for us.
[30:08] [Music]
[30:22] When I first began to walk with the
[30:28] Lord, I did not fully trust him.
[30:37] how he longed for me to
[30:41] understand
[30:44] that
[30:45] I could.
[30:50] So through
[30:52] the valley
[30:55] he led me
[30:58] [Music]
[31:00] afraid as I
[31:02] could be
[31:05] till I felt his loving arms
[31:12] embracing
[31:14] [Music]
[31:20] See, I've been through enough to know
[31:25] that he'll be enough
[31:28] for me.
[31:31] [Music]
[31:35] He's come through too many times
[31:40] that puts my mind
[31:43] at ease
[31:46] for good.
[31:49] Oh, and I'll stake my very life that
[31:54] he's going to take care
[31:58] of me.
[32:04] I've been through enough to know that he
[32:10] be enough
[32:12] for me.
[32:17] How could I ever
[32:21] doubt a God whose hands hold the
[32:27] universe?
[32:31] And why would I ever
[32:35] question his
[32:37] ability?
[32:40] [Music]
[32:43] There's no place
[32:46] that I can go that he does know the
[32:53] things that trouble me.
[32:57] He's always aware
[33:01] of where I am
[33:05] and what I need.
[33:09] I believe him now.
[33:12] After all these years, he's been so
[33:17] faithful. He's proven to be true.
[33:22] Never more will I doubt or question why.
[33:29] Cuz I've seen him work before and I know
[33:34] what my God can do.
[33:42] See, I've been through enough to know
[33:47] that he'll be enough for me.
[33:53] [Music]
[33:57] Yes, he's come through too many times
[34:02] that puts my mind
[34:05] at ease
[34:07] for good.
[34:11] and I'll stake my very life that he's
[34:17] going to take care
[34:19] of me.
[34:25] See, I've been through enough to know
[34:29] that he'll be enough
[34:33] for me.
[34:39] Yes, I've been through it enough to know
[34:44] he'll be enough
[34:48] for me.
[34:54] [Music]
[35:02] Amen. And we certainly want to take the
[35:04] opportunity to welcome each and everyone
[35:06] that's visiting this morning.
[35:09] Say God bless you. Those that are on the
[35:11] internet hookup and the telephone
[35:13] hookup, certainly say God bless you as
[35:15] well this morning. We'll invite our
[35:17] pastor to come, brother Ryan, your wife,
[35:19] sister Elena, to come for the baby
[35:21] dedication. Maybe we can sing as they're
[35:24] coming. Jesus loves me. This I know.
[35:28] Amen.
[35:31] Jesus loves me. This I know.
[35:37] For the Bible
[35:40] tells me so.
[35:43] Little ones to him belong.
[35:48] They are weak, but he is strong.
[35:54] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[36:00] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[36:05] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[36:10] [Music]
[36:17] Amen.
[36:19] Well, we need another part here. And
[36:23] here he is.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Ryan. Sister
[36:28] Yolena.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[36:37] Brother Ryan and Sister Yolena uh have
[36:40] not only brought their daughter
[36:44] who they prayed for
[36:46] before they knew it would be a daughter.
[36:48] They prayed that God would give them a
[36:50] child. and and here we are privileged to
[36:54] dedicate the child and I believe
[36:57] there'll be other relatives here and
[36:59] grandparents and we're so thankful to
[37:02] have them here as well to witness this.
[37:06] Uh we're not here just to
[37:10] you know to view and to be participants
[37:13] that way but to be participants
[37:16] and to make your presence felt.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; You know we want this child and all
[37:23] children
[37:25] &gt;&gt; to feel and believe me they are very
[37:27] sensitive to an atmosphere. Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan and uh sister Elena have
[37:36] named their child Elana.
[37:39] That's first name. Elelliana Jewel.
[37:43] Uh Elelliana is actually feminine for
[37:45] Elijah. It's a Hebrew name
[37:49] and meaning my God has answered
[37:52] &gt;&gt; or my God has answered me.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful? Every time
[37:57] you call your daughter, you'll be
[37:59] saying, "My God has answered me."
[38:04] I think that'll have quite an impact.
[38:06] You've got all the you got all the
[38:08] preachers saying, "Amen."
[38:11] And uh the second name was Jewel. So I
[38:14] looked up Jewel and I said, "Juel in the
[38:16] English means jewel.
[38:19] Jewel in the French means jewel."
[38:22] &gt;&gt; And Jewel in the American language means
[38:25] jewel. And I thought, well, I'll just
[38:27] keep going till I find something. And
[38:28] finally, in the Latin, it means
[38:30] precious.
[38:33] So, we we have Elelliana.
[38:36] God has answered me with something
[38:39] precious.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; And that is indeed
[38:44] brother Ryan. I I felt that this was uh
[38:48] proper to mention that he said the Lord
[38:51] dropped jewel in his heart as he as a
[38:55] second name during work one day and he
[38:58] confirmed it while I was listening to
[39:00] brother Brandham in the fifth seal and
[39:03] he quotes and brother Brandham says you
[39:06] know they call me a woman hater but I'm
[39:08] not but I just think a good woman is a
[39:11] jewel and then further on he said I
[39:14] think a woman, a nice woman that holds
[39:16] herself right and walks like a lady.
[39:19] She's an example of a jewel of the
[39:22] earth. I like I like anything that's
[39:25] graceful and I think a woman that holds
[39:27] her place and tries to be a lady is a
[39:30] statue of honor.
[39:34] So it's our desire,
[39:37] brother Ryan has continued, that she
[39:38] would grow to be a young woman
[39:42] of virtue and character,
[39:45] a true jewel in God's crown,
[39:50] the Bible says, uh, Sister Yolena and
[39:53] Brother Ryan when it was Hannah who was
[39:58] about to have Samuel
[40:01] and, uh, she said, said, "For this child
[40:03] I prayed,
[40:05] and the Lord hath given me my petition
[40:08] which I asked of him that was a son."
[40:13] And in this case, you did not know what
[40:15] God would give you. But I know and I had
[40:18] the I had that complete witness when I
[40:21] wrote these words down for this child.
[40:23] You have prayed
[40:25] and God has given you this child
[40:28] &gt;&gt; and he has a purpose in it. And so I
[40:30] would like to say you've asked for this
[40:33] child and God has given you this child.
[40:36] And may she be better to you than seven
[40:39] sons.
[40:43] May she be blessed with the quiet spirit
[40:45] of her mother Yolena.
[40:47] And I'm sure we all agree with that. For
[40:50] the Bible says, "For an ornament, the
[40:53] ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is
[40:56] in the sight of God of great price.
[41:00] And may God give her the voice to sing
[41:03] and lift up the spirits of the
[41:05] heavy-hearted brother Ryan. May she be
[41:08] gifted and play skillfully
[41:11] music.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; And I pray that'll be a wonderful
[41:14] combination.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; And we're going to pray that God will
[41:18] bless her.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Do you think she'll allow me to hold her
[41:20] or
[41:22] face?
[41:23] &gt;&gt; My is she ever decked out?
[41:29] That beautiful.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our head heads in prayer.
[41:34] Heavenly Father,
[41:37] how we thank you that we can hold Jewel.
[41:41] Elelliana jewel.
[41:43] God has answered me. Jewel. Oh God, we
[41:48] thank you for your spirit that makes
[41:49] even these uh these types and these
[41:53] times very precious because you have
[41:56] said that you took them up in your arms
[41:58] and you blessed them and I have taken
[42:00] Eleana up in my arms that I might bless
[42:03] her. Oh God, I am unworthy, Father, to
[42:06] be a servant of yours, but you did it
[42:09] and now we have this honor. I pray that
[42:12] you'll bless both father and mother, our
[42:14] brother Ryan and sister Yelena, and
[42:16] you'll give give them, oh God, such
[42:20] wisdom as they bring her up from day to
[42:22] day. I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:25] Christ that as you have given them given
[42:28] them this child, now they return it to
[42:31] you. And I dedicate this child,
[42:33] Elelliana Jewel, in the name of the Lord
[42:36] Jesus Christ. and may she ever serve
[42:39] you. Keep her from the uh stains of the
[42:44] world. Keep her from the hurts of the
[42:46] world. Keep her, oh God, in the
[42:48] presence, your presence. In the name of
[42:52] Jesus Christ, we ask it.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; See there, you didn't have to be
[43:00] nervous.
[43:04] God bless you, brother Ryan.
[43:07] God bless you, Elena. Amen.
[43:12] Hallelujah.
[43:16] It's always a pleasure to do that.
[43:21] I wanted to mention also that the
[43:24] service for brother Brad brother
[43:26] Langanger, my brother-in-law, it's uh
[43:29] it's somewhat involved. So, we have
[43:31] simply put it on the notice board. We've
[43:35] enlarged it and put it on the on the
[43:37] bulletin board because there are
[43:39] directions and times and things which
[43:42] you probably wouldn't remember. And uh
[43:45] it's uh they are having a
[43:50] uh viewing in Abbottzford on Tuesday
[43:56] late afternoon evening
[43:58] and then you'll have to get the address
[44:00] for that and then there's an in
[44:02] interament
[44:04] in Murrayville
[44:06] on Wednesday
[44:08] morning I believe at 10:30 11
[44:12] and then it's followed by uh they're
[44:15] going to have then a memorial service
[44:17] Wednesday afternoon at the Church of
[44:19] Living Word on in Abbottzford. So all of
[44:24] those addresses and times are are on the
[44:28] bulletin board. And I I thought if I
[44:30] even if I read it and gave it out, you
[44:32] wouldn't remember it. So I have given
[44:35] you uh we've put it up there for
[44:37] everyone to to have and then you can
[44:41] write it down.
[44:43] and thank you for your prayers. I
[44:46] received an email from uh Shirley this
[44:49] morning, the eldest daughter, and just
[44:52] thank for the prayers and and uh brother
[44:55] Tony in the in the directions that he
[44:58] always also wanted to thank any anyone
[45:01] and everyone for their prayers and we've
[45:03] certainly been praying for them as a
[45:05] family.
[45:07] Uh it's a wonderful opportunity to be
[45:10] able to pray for someone that perhaps
[45:13] otherwise you might not think of them,
[45:15] you know, but when at a time like this,
[45:17] if we were going through a situation
[45:20] similar, I would appreciate people
[45:22] praying for us. Uh amen. I also need to
[45:27] bring you special greetings
[45:30] and I'll just excuse me. I'll just do
[45:33] this quickly. From brother Ron and
[45:36] Sister Connie Spencer, from Brother Tim
[45:40] and Sister Karen Puit, from Brother
[45:43] Joseph Green and his wife Rexan,
[45:47] from Brother Charlie Spencer and his
[45:49] wife, that's father to uh Brother Ron
[45:53] Spencer. I just want to say one thing
[45:55] about Brother Charlie Spencer. He's a
[45:57] he's not a very visible person. He's not
[45:59] one you hear about often, but he's a man
[46:02] that I greatly, greatly admire. He's a
[46:06] man of incredible faith. When Ron
[46:10] Spencer, brother Ron Spencer, fell out
[46:14] of fourth floor building, landed on the
[46:18] concrete on concrete and was just broken
[46:22] up and crushed and rushed to a hospital.
[46:26] And they called the father and the
[46:29] doctors met the father as he came to the
[46:32] hospital just into the hospital. It's
[46:34] how it happened. I've confirmed it many
[46:36] times. And brother Charlie Spencer came
[46:39] in. The doctors met him and the way it
[46:42] is today doctors don't want you to be
[46:44] under any illusion of what the situation
[46:47] is. They said, "Mr. Spencer, we just
[46:50] want you to know your son will never
[46:51] walk again."
[46:54] And brother Charlie Spencer looked up at
[46:56] the doctor, not in disrespect, but he
[46:58] said, "Sir, you just don't know who
[47:01] you're talking to."
[47:04] Said, "I'm a son of God."
[47:06] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Where's my son?" And he
[47:09] walked in to his son in the emergency
[47:12] behind the curtain and whatever more.
[47:14] And Ron told me this, and brother
[47:17] Spencer told me this, but Ron told it to
[47:20] me several times. He said, "My dad
[47:22] looked at me." He said, "I'll never
[47:24] forget his words." He said, "You are my
[47:28] son and I am a son of God and you and I
[47:34] are going to walk out of this hospital
[47:36] tonight."
[47:38] And furthermore,
[47:40] both Ron Spencer, who had just fallen
[47:42] out of fourth floor building, and his
[47:44] dad walked out of that hospital that
[47:47] night, and brother Ron Spencer went to
[47:50] work Monday morning.
[47:53] [Music]
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:00] Praise God.
[48:02] Listen, friends, our God's a living God.
[48:05] That's all there is to it.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; And nothing shall be impossible with
[48:09] God.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Frasier
[48:16] and his good wife, that's Conniey's mom
[48:18] and dad, brother Mike Walls from
[48:21] Washington DC, a pastor there. And
[48:24] another brother was also there. I don't
[48:26] even have all of their names. Brother
[48:28] Joseph Hammed sent a text and wants to
[48:31] be remembered to you. and brother Benny
[48:33] Perry phoned and I and and I just can't
[48:37] remember them all. So, I just have to
[48:38] ask you to thank God for God's servants.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; And when you pray, thank God not only
[48:45] for the bride of Jesus Christ, what he's
[48:47] gone in your life or what done in your
[48:49] life, but listen friends, these are
[48:52] people if you're a son and daughter of
[48:55] God, you're going to spend eternity with
[48:57] them.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; And that's by God's grace.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful?
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Well, I think I'll just have you stand
[49:06] and we're going to pray and turn to the
[49:08] word. Thank you, brother Ryan.
[49:18] Dear heavenly father, how we thank you
[49:20] for this special time
[49:24] once more when we can gather together,
[49:27] be here in a place that we call a
[49:29] sanctuary. It is a sanctuary in the
[49:32] sense that we have not only come to
[49:35] worship you but we've come to separate
[49:36] ourselves from all the activity of the
[49:39] world our work our responsibilities
[49:42] and those things that occupy our mind
[49:46] uh moment by moment during the day and
[49:47] we feel under the pressure of time and
[49:50] everyone is so busy and there's so much
[49:52] to do but we come here now to rest
[49:55] &gt;&gt; we come here to hear your voice
[49:58] &gt;&gt; we come here and I am praying praying
[50:00] especially this morning that the Holy
[50:01] Spirit, the spirit of God, the very life
[50:05] force of the word of God will come and
[50:08] take charge of our minds and charge of
[50:12] our beings and take charge of this
[50:14] service, God. Remove all formality away,
[50:18] Lord, and just sweep in and do what you
[50:21] would like to do. We care not about the
[50:24] order of the service, Lord. Somebody
[50:26] wants to get saved or delivered in the
[50:28] middle of the meeting, it will certainly
[50:30] not be out of order with us, just have
[50:32] your will done in the name of Jesus
[50:35] Christ and we will give you all the
[50:38] glory. We thank you for the ministry,
[50:40] Lord, of the brethren as they minister
[50:42] from service to service and to have our
[50:45] brother Tom back. We pray that you will
[50:47] strengthen him as he comes to deliver
[50:49] the word this evening. We know the
[50:52] difficulties. Father, I just pray that
[50:54] you will overcome every one of those
[50:56] difficulties and you'd help him to
[50:58] minister. Oh God, thank you for the
[51:00] service Wednesday night. Our brother
[51:01] John have been so blessed by the word.
[51:04] Father, our brother Tim Dodd and how he
[51:06] has ministered and taken uh the two
[51:09] portions of service and how we've been
[51:12] so fed. I pray that you will bless this
[51:15] congregation and those of the bride of
[51:17] Jesus Christ around the world. And may
[51:20] all who are within the sound of my voice
[51:22] and especially here in this building
[51:24] will have a a a special appreciation for
[51:28] what you have done and what you are
[51:29] doing. In Jesus Christ's name,
[51:32] &gt;&gt; we ask that your name will be lifted up
[51:34] and glorified and we thank you for it in
[51:38] Jesus name. Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I looked down and saw I believe
[51:43] our sister Elaine McKenzie. So Jane
[51:46] McKenzie, why don't you raise your hand?
[51:49] Do you see that hand?
[51:53] &gt;&gt; She said she first heard the gospel in
[51:56] my mom and dad's house and I was
[51:59] probably four or five years old. I hate
[52:02] to talk about that, but you know, here
[52:03] we are. And Sister Elaine McKenzie, she
[52:07] said, "The first time I heard about the
[52:09] message was in Cloverdale Bible Way in
[52:12] the Log Church." Mhm.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Those are always precious moments to me.
[52:16] And something that I'll just say
[52:18] personally, after my mother's funeral, I
[52:22] was taken over to your mom and dad's
[52:23] house.
[52:25] Yes. That's wonderful. And her mom, they
[52:29] haven't got it in the written down, but
[52:31] I remember vividly her mom sang at my
[52:35] mom's funeral. So, God bless you, Sister
[52:38] Lane McKenzie. She's strong and quick
[52:41] mind and sharp and we visited and and is
[52:45] here today. I appreciate that. God bless
[52:47] you. God bless you. They say yes. Thank
[52:51] you. Thank you. They say uh some friends
[52:54] are like silver and some are gold, but
[52:55] there are some that are platinum.
[52:59] Amen. All right. and I'll have you turn
[53:01] in your Bibles if you would please to
[53:03] John's Gospel
[53:07] uh 3rd chapter. Now, will you all
[53:10] promise to help me this morning?
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We uh
[53:19] before we read, I'll try to tell you
[53:21] where I'm going.
[53:24] And I I need to tell you I need to tell
[53:26] you where I'm trying to go. So you can
[53:29] kind of use your imagination while I
[53:31] speak and say, "Oh, that that's where
[53:33] he's going. Let's hope he gets there."
[53:36] Amen.
[53:39] Uh I want to speak on this subject
[53:42] whether
[53:43] whether the spirit goeth. That means
[53:46] where it goes. Whether the spirit goeth.
[53:50] taken from the text which we'll read.
[53:53] Jesus saying, "Everyone that's born of
[53:54] the spirit, the spirit is like the wind
[53:59] bloweth where it listeth. You hear the
[54:02] sound thereof, but you cannot tell from
[54:05] whence it came and whether it goeth."
[54:09] And I have seen moves of God
[54:12] &gt;&gt; blow in
[54:14] &gt;&gt; and everyone gets caught up in it and
[54:18] then it's it blows out.
[54:21] But man
[54:23] builds a structure
[54:26] and to keep the movement moving
[54:30] and get caught up in the structure
[54:34] &gt;&gt; rather than what the structure was
[54:36] created for
[54:38] &gt;&gt; which was to carry the word of God for
[54:41] that season
[54:43] &gt;&gt; and become distracted and the structures
[54:46] become known as denominations.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:50] So I want you to just think about that.
[54:52] So we'll read from John the 3 chapter
[54:54] please
[54:56] starting with verse one. There was a man
[54:59] of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler
[55:02] of the Jews. The same came to Jesus by
[55:05] night and said unto him, "Rabbi, we know
[55:08] that thou art a teacher come from God.
[55:10] For no man can do these miracles that
[55:12] thou doest except God be with him."
[55:16] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[55:18] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[55:21] a man be born again, he cannot see the
[55:23] kingdom of God." Nicodemus saith unto
[55:26] him, How can a man be born when he's
[55:29] old, can he enter the second time into
[55:31] his mother's womb and be born? Jesus
[55:35] answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[55:37] you, unto thee, except a man be born of
[55:40] water and of the spirit, he cannot enter
[55:43] into the kingdom of God. That which is
[55:46] born of the flesh is flesh, and that
[55:48] which is born of the spirit is spirit.
[55:51] Marvel not that I say unto thee, you
[55:54] must be born again. The wind bloweth
[55:58] where it listeth, and thou hearest the
[56:01] sound thereof, but can not tell whence
[56:05] it cometh, and whether it goeth, so is
[56:09] everyone that is born of the spirit. And
[56:13] it says, "The wind bloweth where it
[56:15] listeth. The dagot says this, the spirit
[56:20] breathes where it will,
[56:24] and you hear its voice,
[56:26] but know not whence it comes or where it
[56:30] goes.
[56:31] Thus it is with everyone who is born of
[56:35] the spirit." Amen. May God bless his
[56:38] word. Have your seats. And please just
[56:41] try not to be distracted at all the rest
[56:45] of the service. If there's any movement,
[56:47] if you try to keep focused,
[56:54] I'm going to move along quite quickly
[56:56] because I have considerable ground and
[56:58] you'll need just to stay from from one
[57:01] sub one one phrase to another.
[57:05] The Holy Spirit of God is
[57:08] the life force
[57:12] or the power that manifests and brings
[57:15] forth the spoken word of God to life.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God is the life force.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; It's the power that manifests and brings
[57:26] forth the spoken word into life.
[57:30] And incidentally, I want you to be
[57:33] mindful that the spoken word of God,
[57:36] everything was created by the spoken
[57:38] word of God. And God said, do we all
[57:41] agree?
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said that the
[57:46] only thing that Satan could not do was
[57:48] create.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; He was God's right-hand man. Is that
[57:51] what he said?
[57:53] &gt;&gt; And the only thing he could do was not
[57:55] create. So he did not have access to the
[57:59] spoken word of God.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; And when he was cast to the earth, there
[58:03] was war in heaven. And Satan wanted to
[58:05] be lifted up. And he said, "I'll be like
[58:07] the most high." The only thing he
[58:09] couldn't do was create. Obviously,
[58:11] that's what he wanted to do.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; And so he's cast to the earth and he
[58:15] ends up in Eden. That's the first record
[58:18] we have. Why is he in Eden? Because
[58:20] that's where the spoken word was doing
[58:23] creative things. He wanted to be there.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly the first thing that
[58:29] he touched when he approached Steve is
[58:32] hath God said.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; And so it's no surprise that whenever
[58:40] the spoken word of God, wherever it is
[58:43] coming and moving in the earth, you'll
[58:46] find that is where Satan tries to uh
[58:50] focus his full attention there. And that
[58:54] is the proof. That is the proof that
[58:56] that is the spoken word of God.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; And so now when you have a message,
[59:01] you've received a message. Say God has
[59:04] not only spoken his word, he's
[59:06] vindicated that this is his spoken word.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; You're going to find Satan right there
[59:12] trying to tamper with that word. He's
[59:15] not he's not interested in all this
[59:17] other stuff that he's got.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; You'll find it. And so as believers, we
[59:22] shouldn't say, "Oh my goodness, I never
[59:24] thought." Of course you did.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Of course you know that's where he's
[59:29] going to be.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Of course you know he's going to attack
[59:32] that. Of course you know that he's he
[59:35] always has. Why wouldn't he do that?
[59:37] &gt;&gt; And then when Jesus who was that word in
[59:40] flesh came, who comes to see him right
[59:44] after he's baptized? Satan himself.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed of it. He comes right
[59:49] there. How brazen, how bold, how proud,
[59:54] &gt;&gt; how filled with whatever. And to think
[59:56] that he's changed his character. Not a
[59:58] bit. And wherever the spoken word of God
[1:00:00] is, you'll find that's where he is.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; I want everybody who believes it to
[1:00:07] declare that you believe that. In case
[1:00:09] there's any sitting on the fence,
[1:00:10] they'll think about it. Wherever the
[1:00:12] spoken word of God is, that's where
[1:00:14] you'll find him.
[1:00:17] Amen.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God now can move over the
[1:00:22] whole earth or the spirit of God can
[1:00:24] move in a certain area. The spirit of
[1:00:27] God can raise up a nation and cause a
[1:00:29] nation to fall. The spirit of God can
[1:00:33] breathe and blow in as it has recently.
[1:00:36] I I want to I hope I come to you young
[1:00:39] men and ladies from SFU. That's not
[1:00:42] something that you just generated.
[1:00:45] That's the spirit of God that just blew
[1:00:47] in there. And you better take a hold of
[1:00:49] it and appreciate it, respect it while
[1:00:51] it's happening because finally the day
[1:00:53] will come and you'll say, "Wither did it
[1:00:55] go?"
[1:01:05] the supernatural happenings and all that
[1:01:08] the Holy Ghost
[1:01:10] does as a result of the move of God.
[1:01:14] Everything that the Holy Spirit does as
[1:01:16] a result saves individuals and maybe
[1:01:20] young people. They get a little older.
[1:01:22] They marry. They have children. families
[1:01:25] grow. Now we have families. Now we have
[1:01:28] now we we have things that we need to
[1:01:30] do. We have families and so on. So we
[1:01:33] need perhaps a Sunday school. So a
[1:01:35] Sunday school is set up. We we need a
[1:01:37] place to worship now because there's
[1:01:39] quite a few people that have gathered.
[1:01:41] So we get a place, we get a building or
[1:01:43] something else. And now the children
[1:01:45] need to be educated. And so perhaps
[1:01:47] there you do a let's have a school or
[1:01:50] let's get them together. And so there's
[1:01:52] a school or there's this and that and
[1:01:54] the other thing and then you find that
[1:01:57] that
[1:01:59] if the spirit of God if the people don't
[1:02:02] have the focus
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; of why this exists
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; this exists only because they had a
[1:02:10] message in the first place.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; They had the spoken word which they
[1:02:14] embraced which is the person of Jesus
[1:02:16] Christ. If they ever lose sight that
[1:02:19] that is Jesus Christ and lose lose that
[1:02:23] first love and lose that first
[1:02:25] connection. If they lose that they if
[1:02:27] they lose that then the rest of it just
[1:02:30] moves on as a structure
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; and then people become consumed with the
[1:02:36] structure. Oh, we need this. We need to
[1:02:38] fix the building. We need another. We
[1:02:40] need this. We need that. Uh the the
[1:02:43] music. We need to change this or
[1:02:45] something and embellish it and make it
[1:02:47] nicer and make it this better. And and
[1:02:49] now suddenly all the structure becomes
[1:02:52] the focus.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And we say whether did it go. Right.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; The message
[1:03:02] The message as a body and as a movement
[1:03:06] is that a crisis at this moment.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And the crisis in is involved. I'm
[1:03:12] dealing with it in this service.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; And when you see and you look out and
[1:03:19] you say, well, you know, then then then
[1:03:22] people become all taken up. Well, da da
[1:03:24] da this is happening over there and da
[1:03:26] da da this is happening over here and
[1:03:27] this is what has that's just exactly
[1:03:29] what Satan wants. He wants people to
[1:03:31] become all consumed and all involved
[1:03:34] with with the traps trapings of this and
[1:03:37] that and the other thing. That's not
[1:03:39] what's important. What's important is
[1:03:41] that that first initial fire and zeal in
[1:03:44] life
[1:03:45] is maintained. That's what necessary in
[1:03:48] a home. That's what's necessary in the
[1:03:50] individual life. It's not more buildings
[1:03:53] and more churches and more this or that
[1:03:55] that well we have churches and we have
[1:03:58] more churches and that's right and as
[1:04:00] long as the move continues but it is
[1:04:03] absolutely absolutely essential that the
[1:04:06] people who've been called by this voice
[1:04:10] re remold it fast in their heart this
[1:04:14] voice is the voice of my beloved
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; and I can never be moved from that
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; and it is this beloved that I'm consumed
[1:04:22] with. It is this lovely spoken word that
[1:04:25] I'm consumed with. It's this message of
[1:04:27] the hour and that's the purpose of our
[1:04:30] existence. That's why we have a
[1:04:32] building. That's why we have a
[1:04:33] broadcaster. That's why we have
[1:04:35] everything.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And as we're sitting here right now,
[1:04:39] that's what's happening to fail in many
[1:04:42] places because Satan would do everything
[1:04:45] in his power and he's so subtle. He just
[1:04:47] he comes in when there's been growth and
[1:04:50] there's been missions and there's been
[1:04:52] expansion. But you know the life of this
[1:04:56] congregation or the life of any believer
[1:04:59] must be that it is reaching out to one
[1:05:02] more lost one, one more lost one. One
[1:05:05] more lost one. And and as we're sitting
[1:05:07] here this moment and sitting here this
[1:05:10] moment, the meeting, the first one that
[1:05:12] we've had that we've actually had uh
[1:05:15] physical to do with has just happened in
[1:05:18] Ethiopia this morning.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And brother Basubi from Uganda has gone
[1:05:24] to Ethiopia. He went there for his
[1:05:26] honeymoon. And and I tell you, there's a
[1:05:28] young man just burning up. He's about 30
[1:05:30] years old. and he and when we invited
[1:05:33] him to come to Canada or United States
[1:05:35] both he couldn't he couldn't get a visa
[1:05:37] to either place but he had to go to
[1:05:39] Nairobi to in Kenya to get his visa and
[1:05:43] he met a brother by the name of brother
[1:05:44] Paul and brother Paul is with him
[1:05:47] brother Paul had some connection in
[1:05:49] Ethiopia and he found some from Nairobi
[1:05:51] that have been going to Ethiopia why am
[1:05:54] I talking about that not to give you
[1:05:56] some information but to let you know and
[1:05:58] he said please pray for us there's a
[1:06:00] woman that's bound with a demon of port
[1:06:02] polio and he had polio in one leg and
[1:06:06] we've prayed for her and we need prayer.
[1:06:08] We need strength and he's calling on
[1:06:10] this congregation. He's calling on you
[1:06:12] sitting here now. Pray for this woman.
[1:06:15] Pray for us. This is a He says the fires
[1:06:18] are burning and they're baptizing some
[1:06:20] people. They've and he got into a
[1:06:22] church. He got into a church, a
[1:06:24] structured church that has 500 churches,
[1:06:28] Protestant churches in in there. and
[1:06:30] he's dealing with the pastor of that
[1:06:32] local church and they had a senior
[1:06:34] bishop over it. But the local pastor got
[1:06:37] hungered got hungry for this message and
[1:06:40] there gave him some message books. I
[1:06:43] tell you what, we need to hold these
[1:06:44] brothers up in prayer. Say, "Oh God, let
[1:06:47] the flame of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; burn and cause them to say things, cause
[1:06:53] them to speak, take control of their
[1:06:55] mind, take control of their tongue
[1:06:58] because it's a sweep. It's never swept
[1:07:00] there before that we know of or that God
[1:07:02] has never opened the door to us. But
[1:07:04] that but the one thing for sure, one day
[1:07:07] will come when you'll turn around and
[1:07:09] say, "Wither did it go?"
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; It's not the same. And then by that
[1:07:15] time, you know, men and that that is
[1:07:18] exactly the critical spot. That's
[1:07:21] exactly the critical spot where Satan
[1:07:23] comes in and anoints the human mind. And
[1:07:26] then the mind men take it and say,
[1:07:28] "Well, we need to have, you know, we
[1:07:30] need to keep this ministry going, so we
[1:07:32] need more ministers, so we build a Bible
[1:07:34] school
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; and we need to for our children." And
[1:07:38] and and then they're sick. We we might
[1:07:40] as well be in the hospital business. So
[1:07:42] we have a hospital. And brother Brandon
[1:07:44] says, "I have nothing against that.
[1:07:46] That's all fine. That's all good. But
[1:07:48] that wasn't it."
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; friends. It's the person of Jesus
[1:07:55] Christ. It is the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:58] Ghost.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; And that Holy Ghost is as real today as
[1:08:01] the day it brought you into the kingdom
[1:08:03] of God.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we need to nurture that
[1:08:08] relationship. We just need to nurture
[1:08:10] it. When you're in a message, say,
[1:08:12] "Well, I'm I'm reading message books. I
[1:08:14] read three or four a day." No, that
[1:08:16] doesn't impress me. I'm happy that you
[1:08:18] do, but I would sooner have you read
[1:08:20] three or four pages and become so
[1:08:23] acquainted and have that person so speak
[1:08:25] to you that that you're just affected.
[1:08:28] Your life is changed and you come under
[1:08:31] the transforming power of almighty God
[1:08:35] and say, "I'm not the same person I was
[1:08:37] a month ago."
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Such a faith, such a stability has come
[1:08:43] to me.
[1:08:48] And that's why it's so critical to hold
[1:08:50] to the original word
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; and to move with it because the original
[1:08:55] word will continue to move and you can
[1:08:58] move with it
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; in the message Christ is the mystery of
[1:09:01] God revealed prophetus said the first
[1:09:04] thing that God wanted to reveal what he
[1:09:08] wanted to reveal himself to the people.
[1:09:11] Secondly, to have the preeminence in the
[1:09:13] body of believers and that is his bride
[1:09:16] that he might live in people.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And then thirdly, to restore the kingdom
[1:09:21] to its rightly position that fell by sin
[1:09:25] by the first Adam back to where he
[1:09:27] walked in the cool of the evening with
[1:09:30] his people and talked with them and
[1:09:32] fellowship with them.
[1:09:35] He speaks of Moses and he said he was a
[1:09:37] complete prisoner to the chains of God's
[1:09:41] word. Oh, I love those words.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And we can we're not talking about Moses
[1:09:47] now. We want to talk about one another.
[1:09:50] Want to talk about yourself. Say, God,
[1:09:53] let me be a prisoner
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; in the chains of your word.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Could we make that a prayer this morning
[1:10:01] as I say it again? Let me be in chains
[1:10:05] love chains
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; of your word. Let me be a prisoner to
[1:10:10] that person. The living word
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; let me move with him.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; And whether you go, let me go.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; And when you leave, I'll leave with you.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:25] Jesus said, "When the spirit of truth is
[1:10:27] come, the spirit of truth, that is the
[1:10:30] life that animates the truth."
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; That's what gives the truth life.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; When the spirit of truth is come, here's
[1:10:38] what he will do. He will guide you
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; into all truth,
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; into all truth.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; And he shall not speak of himself.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; He won't say spirit, spirit, spirit,
[1:10:50] spirit. He'll say word, word, word,
[1:10:52] word.
[1:10:54] And whatsoever he shall hear, that shall
[1:10:57] he speak. And lastly, he shall show you
[1:11:00] things to come.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; So Jesus said,
[1:11:10] "We cannot tell from whence it cometh
[1:11:15] and whether it goeth.
[1:11:18] wentes from where from what from how and
[1:11:21] why.
[1:11:24] Now I want to give honor to God and I
[1:11:27] move just quickly through the word. The
[1:11:28] Bible tells us in the beginning that the
[1:11:30] earth was
[1:11:33] without form and void and darkness was
[1:11:36] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[1:11:38] of God moved upon the face of the water.
[1:11:41] I need to make a point. So I'm starting
[1:11:43] right at the beginning. I'm going to
[1:11:44] take it through several places now very
[1:11:46] quickly.
[1:11:48] And the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:11:50] face of the waters. And God said, "Let
[1:11:52] there be light." And there was light.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "If if he said,
[1:11:56] "Let there be light." And there was a
[1:11:58] fog, then it wasn't God's word.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; God, what God's word it'll bring in. The
[1:12:03] Bible says, "And God saw everything that
[1:12:06] he had made, and behold, it was very
[1:12:08] good. And the evening and the morning
[1:12:11] were the sixth day."
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:14] Thus the heavens and the earth were
[1:12:16] finished, and all the host of them,
[1:12:21] and whether the spirit went, we know
[1:12:23] not,
[1:12:24] but creation was completed.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; The sun didn't stop shining, and trees
[1:12:31] didn't stop growing,
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; and the birds continued to sing and fly
[1:12:36] and produce, and so on and so forth. God
[1:12:39] didn't have to keep moving and brooding
[1:12:41] over the earth. He brooded over it and
[1:12:43] it happened and it was done.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; It was a finished creation.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; That's the point I want to make.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; It was a finished creation.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; See, God moved over over the people and
[1:12:55] and I don't want to get ahead of myself,
[1:12:57] but God moves over the people and he
[1:12:59] says uh uh this is the message of the
[1:13:01] hour. This is the evening time light.
[1:13:03] This is this is the last messenger and
[1:13:06] so on so forth. He doesn't have to come
[1:13:07] and say it every week.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to say it every day. It
[1:13:11] just keeps on moving.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; It's up to the people who get the
[1:13:14] revelation to keep moving with it.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely vital you keep moving
[1:13:19] with it. Otherwise, it just gets to be a
[1:13:22] structure.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; What do you do? I go to church. Where do
[1:13:24] you go? I go to a message church. No,
[1:13:26] it's not a message church anymore.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; It's just a building.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; There's lots of buildings.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:13:37] And thus the heavens and the earth were
[1:13:39] finished in the host of them. And on the
[1:13:40] seventh day, the Bible says, God ended
[1:13:43] his work which he had made.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; It was finished. And he rested on the
[1:13:49] seventh day. And the spirit of God
[1:13:51] ceased its work of creating or brooding
[1:13:55] over the earth. It was done. Whether it
[1:13:57] went, I don't know,
[1:14:00] but it was finished. It was a completed
[1:14:02] work. The creation was a completed
[1:14:05] creation. And from that time, the sun
[1:14:07] continued to shine. The earth has
[1:14:10] continued to bring forth and man has
[1:14:12] continued to multiply. The spirit of God
[1:14:15] moved in the season of creation. The
[1:14:18] wind came to breathe the breath of the
[1:14:22] creation over the face of the earth. And
[1:14:24] it was so.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God displayed in various
[1:14:29] ways depending entirely upon what God
[1:14:32] had ordained to take place at that time.
[1:14:36] The spirit of God entered into Egypt one
[1:14:38] day in the form of Joseph.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Whence it came,
[1:14:46] they didn't know.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; But it finally came to the place after a
[1:14:52] few events which you can read about. And
[1:14:55] Pharaoh has his dreams and there's a man
[1:14:58] with the wisdom of God in him. And
[1:15:01] Pharaoh finally said, and Pharaoh said
[1:15:03] unto his servants, can we find such a
[1:15:06] one
[1:15:08] uh a man in whom the spirit of God is?
[1:15:12] And they made him ruler and Egypt under
[1:15:15] him became the superpower.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; It blew in
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; and made it a superpower.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; And then as it began to leave, they said
[1:15:27] came a king that knew not Joseph. Right.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; You're following me?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; And they knew not Joseph. And then look
[1:15:37] what happened to Egypt. Then they began
[1:15:39] to resist God. And God breathes in in a
[1:15:42] different form in the form of Moses. Now
[1:15:46] a prophet with a spirit of God in him.
[1:15:49] And the word and the spirit of the word
[1:15:52] and the word in his mouth
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God is with him. And
[1:15:56] it breathes into Egypt 400 years later
[1:16:02] and the children are in bondage and he
[1:16:04] comes in there. Let my people go.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that word had to be
[1:16:11] animated. It had to happen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; It just couldn't be some empty words. It
[1:16:16] couldn't just be a structure. Well,
[1:16:18] we'll manage somehow. No. Let them go.
[1:16:21] And
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; when this message came and spoke to the
[1:16:25] demons that control your life, said,
[1:16:27] "Let my son go.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Let my daughter go."
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; There's no way all hell could hold you.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; There was no way. Hallelujah. God was
[1:16:38] speaking.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when we talk about
[1:16:44] vindication to this message, friend,
[1:16:46] don't you ever ever give vindication a
[1:16:49] second place. Vindication was God
[1:16:51] proving that that was him speaking, not
[1:16:55] someone else speaking. That's why
[1:16:57] cancers died and dropped to the floor.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Talking to Sam Ray yesterday and he said
[1:17:06] he just was moved and directed to he
[1:17:09] hear a a deep call of the deep again.
[1:17:12] And I had just finished reading it that
[1:17:13] day, yesterday, reading about and
[1:17:16] brother Brand was talking to the one
[1:17:18] woman and he says, "Now this here, it's
[1:17:20] God. It's not a story, friends. It's God
[1:17:23] proving who's speaking.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; We don't want to hear just a man.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; If you came here to hear me, you're
[1:17:30] missing it.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; We only have one focus, and that has to
[1:17:34] be the one who came and brought this
[1:17:36] message.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's important. The
[1:17:40] building's not important. All the
[1:17:42] structures not important. What is a
[1:17:44] deacon board? There's all kinds of
[1:17:46] deacon boards. What's a trustee board?
[1:17:48] There's all kinds of trustee boards.
[1:17:50] What are some musicians? Nothing. What's
[1:17:52] the all the singers? It's only what God.
[1:17:55] It's only putting forward the focus. And
[1:17:58] if we lose the focus, we have nothing
[1:18:00] but a dead f a dead structure.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Let me just drop this in physically
[1:18:07] speaking. And some nations are more
[1:18:09] benefited than others. But in a nation,
[1:18:12] we have all kinds of benefits.
[1:18:15] Social network. I'm not talking about
[1:18:17] internet. I'm talking about network for
[1:18:20] the unemployed and for the sick and the
[1:18:22] afflicted and for those that have, you
[1:18:25] know, the aged and and all of these
[1:18:27] different things. We have a a social
[1:18:30] network. And we have this and that. And
[1:18:32] we have, you know, clubs and communities
[1:18:35] and different societies and different
[1:18:38] things to meet the need of the people.
[1:18:41] But when the life,
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; hear me? When the life in your body is
[1:18:47] gone, you don't need any of that.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; It's all still there. But it's just a
[1:18:53] dead framework to you. Even this body,
[1:18:57] even this body, God's given you all of
[1:19:00] this structure and a breathing apparatus
[1:19:02] and a mind that sends signals and your
[1:19:04] muscles move and all of these things
[1:19:06] happen. It's just for to animate the
[1:19:09] life.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; It's to express the life. And God gave
[1:19:14] it cuz he wanted to fill you with the
[1:19:16] Holy Ghost
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; and you express another life.
[1:19:21] And when this body dies, all of it, all
[1:19:24] this is is just a a framework.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; It's just a dead framework.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; And that's why a prophet could say of
[1:19:32] the denominations and everything just a
[1:19:34] dead framework.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Meaningless framework.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; I need support from you.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; This is the message.
[1:19:45] And God breathed in and breathed into
[1:19:48] Egypt
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; through Moses and came and said, "Let my
[1:19:53] people go."
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There had rose up a king that knew
[1:19:58] not Egypt.
[1:20:05] But here came another one.
[1:20:08] Now, and God now has is coming in
[1:20:10] another form. It's coming in a prophet
[1:20:13] form.
[1:20:15] And this prophet says now to this this
[1:20:18] system that has forgot God, he says,
[1:20:21] "For this cause, for this for this very
[1:20:24] deed, and for this cause have I raised
[1:20:26] thee up,
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; I raised you up.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; I raised this cruel system up.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; To show my to show you my power
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; and that my name may be declared
[1:20:39] throughout all the earth.
[1:20:42] And it'll be declared because these
[1:20:44] people you say are mudbers and slaves.
[1:20:46] I'm going to take them out of your hand.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; I raised you up as a great nation one
[1:20:51] day and you forgot God.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Think of it America. Think of it Western
[1:20:56] world. Think of it Le Oysia that
[1:21:01] [Applause]
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; I raised you up for the purpose. But if
[1:21:05] you lose the focus, why was the
[1:21:07] Constitution written? Why did men of
[1:21:10] God? Why did they go come to Plymouth
[1:21:12] Rock? Why did they find a new world? Not
[1:21:15] for a better life. For freedom of
[1:21:18] worship. We want to worship our God. Why
[1:21:22] are we gathering here? If we're not
[1:21:24] gathering here to worship our God, it's
[1:21:26] nothing but a dead structure to you.
[1:21:32] It is that life that will give you the
[1:21:34] honor and the respect that is due to the
[1:21:37] deacons that stand in the door and and
[1:21:39] the men who lead in the song service and
[1:21:42] say, "Thank God I can be here where the
[1:21:44] Holy Ghost is directing and hear a
[1:21:47] brother pray and see a minister stand up
[1:21:50] and preach the word of God." Oh God, how
[1:21:53] much I respect you and thus I honor
[1:21:56] them.
[1:22:06] Egypt today is not as it was.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Egypt today is in chaos.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Egypt today is slaying one another.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; While you're sitting here, they're
[1:22:18] trembling.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; While you're sitting here, they don't
[1:22:21] have hardly a place to of peace,
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:30] And the Lord spake to Moses and said,
[1:22:33] "I've called during this time when they
[1:22:36] were bringing the children out. My
[1:22:38] goodness, help me."
[1:22:40] And and and God wanted to have a place
[1:22:43] where he could move in and have the
[1:22:45] people and identify a spot. He says,
[1:22:48] "You have them build a tabernacle for
[1:22:51] me." We need a certain kind of a
[1:22:54] structure. It's not the structure that
[1:22:57] was important. It was the God that was
[1:22:59] going to come into the structure.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; You build him a tabernacle. And this is
[1:23:05] what he said. And so I have called Belal
[1:23:09] the son of and the son of her of the
[1:23:12] tribe of Judah. And I listen to me. You
[1:23:17] young men listen to me now. And I have
[1:23:20] filled him with the spirit of God in
[1:23:23] wisdom and in understanding and in
[1:23:26] knowledge and in all manner of
[1:23:29] workmanship.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; I know you drive into this yard and you
[1:23:34] say, "Oh, oh, there's the school.
[1:23:36] There's the school." I can tell you
[1:23:38] something. That scripture came into
[1:23:41] being in the last 24 months while men
[1:23:44] who didn't know how to do things under
[1:23:46] the guidance of brother Kim Dingwall and
[1:23:49] this congregation outside of four
[1:23:52] concrete walls did all the design work
[1:23:54] and all the things and say oh brother
[1:23:56] Kim my what wonderful wisdom I I took
[1:23:59] more people in to show them what brother
[1:24:01] Dingwall had had made and so on. I laid
[1:24:04] floor with with with people carpet and
[1:24:07] some of the young men here and brother
[1:24:09] Joseph and young men came didn't know
[1:24:11] the first thing about it in in no time
[1:24:14] they do better and laying the floor for
[1:24:16] the gymnasium here comes a professional
[1:24:19] man that's all they do is a business and
[1:24:21] tell brother Kim they said you're a
[1:24:23] young man lay that floor better than my
[1:24:26] man
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; and those lines on the floor are
[1:24:31] absolutely precision
[1:24:33] and people who are who are doing brother
[1:24:36] Mark Powell and brother brother Sam
[1:24:38] Waldner and so many many others and
[1:24:41] they're bending bending uh uh tubes and
[1:24:45] conduit and bending it this way that
[1:24:47] way. I took two men in there. They were
[1:24:50] here on another subject. They were here
[1:24:52] on some real estate and they walked in
[1:24:54] and I said, "Let me show you the church,
[1:24:56] the school." And walked into the school
[1:24:59] and there was his mouth just hanging
[1:25:01] open. I said, "Outside of four concrete
[1:25:04] walls, the brothers and sisters from the
[1:25:06] church had did this place. They can't
[1:25:09] believe it." And we were in a an
[1:25:11] electrical place. And the man was just
[1:25:13] standing there looking and he's looking
[1:25:15] at all these conduit pipes going up just
[1:25:18] dozens of these pipes and bending and
[1:25:20] twisting and going this way. They were
[1:25:23] looking at the work of either brother
[1:25:25] Mark Powell or Brotherh Sam Walder, one
[1:25:28] of them. Anyway, and he looked at all
[1:25:30] those pipes. He said, "It's beautiful."
[1:25:36] I thought, "I'm just showing him the I'm
[1:25:38] just showing him the building and he's
[1:25:40] looking at all these pipes and his
[1:25:42] friend says to me, he's electrician.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Where did that come from?"
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, those brothers did a good
[1:25:53] job." No, no, you haven't got the same
[1:25:55] God.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same God says, "I've
[1:26:01] anointed them. I've given them wisdom.
[1:26:03] I've given them so they know how to and
[1:26:05] they know how to work with steel and
[1:26:07] iron and brass and and gold and silver
[1:26:10] and and and how they will put the
[1:26:12] curtains together and how they will sew
[1:26:14] it. I gave them wisdom. That whole
[1:26:16] chapter is full of it. And because I've
[1:26:18] given them wisdom, they'll build a
[1:26:20] tabernacle." It wasn't the structure
[1:26:22] that was important. It was the God that
[1:26:25] was in the structure.
[1:26:29] and I will dwell with them. And for you
[1:26:31] school teachers and Mr. Tash and and and
[1:26:35] and the and all of the staff, it's not
[1:26:38] just the framework or the people in
[1:26:41] bodies that are there. It's the God
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; that has determined
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; my children, my little ones, my beloved
[1:26:51] ones shall not be under the influence of
[1:26:54] this demon power. If it's at all
[1:26:57] possible, I will have it under the
[1:26:59] influence of the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; My spirit.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Friend, you think I'm pumping for a
[1:27:09] school? You're mistaken for BCA. Not a
[1:27:12] chance for CBW. Not a chance. That's not
[1:27:16] it. It's the God that breathed in and
[1:27:19] blew in and caused this to have its
[1:27:21] existence. We exist for his sake. We
[1:27:25] exist for his purpose.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; And then the time of the prophets, the
[1:27:37] the Bible says in prophecy, you have to
[1:27:39] help me. I'm so moved. I'm so affected.
[1:27:43] And the prophecy came not of old time by
[1:27:46] the will of man, but holy men of God
[1:27:49] spake as they were moved by the Holy
[1:27:52] Ghost.
[1:27:54] And thus we have an Old Testament. They
[1:27:57] were moved by the Holy Ghost, but
[1:27:59] someone moved on someone else who could
[1:28:01] write
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; and they were scribes and someone moved
[1:28:05] on someone else so they might interpret
[1:28:08] it and give it to another person in
[1:28:10] another language. And thus,
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; the Bible came to us in the Hebrew
[1:28:16] language.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; And I'm coming now. And the spirit of
[1:28:18] God moves through the land raising up
[1:28:21] empires,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; kingdoms,
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; and nations for his purpose. And when
[1:28:28] he's done, they pass off the same.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; And thus my title, whence goeth it,
[1:28:38] whence does it go? Whether does it go?
[1:28:41] We don't know.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; But I can tell you for sure it comes.
[1:28:46] And I can tell you for sure people
[1:28:48] become distracted
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; and make nations and whatever more. And
[1:28:52] I can tell you for sure it goes.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; And it goes to pick up some more of
[1:28:59] God's elected
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; and the church of God moves on.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God moves through the
[1:29:11] land raising up empires, kingdoms, and
[1:29:14] nations. and they rise and fall
[1:29:16] according to God's plan, keeping the
[1:29:19] focus of his will, which is his word,
[1:29:22] proven and vindicated word.
[1:29:26] I became interested
[1:29:28] and you'll have to you that are students
[1:29:30] now.
[1:29:32] You'll hear a little history that
[1:29:34] perhaps you didn't get at school. says
[1:29:38] that ancient Greek culture
[1:29:41] dominated much of the known world
[1:29:45] before the time of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:48] And at this time, Greek culture and
[1:29:50] influence and power was at its peak in
[1:29:55] Europe and Asia, experiencing
[1:30:00] and progress in the arts,
[1:30:05] and exploration
[1:30:08] and literature,
[1:30:10] in theater, in architecture,
[1:30:14] in music, in mathematics, in philosophy.
[1:30:18] And in science, does it sound familiar?
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; As at the time of Jesus,
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; it reached its peak.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Why did it reach its peak?
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Because there was someone that was going
[1:30:35] to be energized and say, "We need this
[1:30:39] Old Testament Hebrew translated into the
[1:30:42] Greek because this is the language of
[1:30:44] the people." And that's why it's called
[1:30:46] the LXX because there were 70 scholars
[1:30:50] which this gentleman, this politician
[1:30:55] uh just forget his name just now. I
[1:30:57] don't forget it but I can't say it
[1:30:58] exactly. And he instructed and assigned
[1:31:02] them to put the Old Testament into
[1:31:04] English.
[1:31:06] Tommy, I believe it was if I'm saying
[1:31:08] that's right.
[1:31:11] And and then the and then this history
[1:31:13] says it is often considered a period of
[1:31:17] transition.
[1:31:19] This period when it had reached its peak
[1:31:21] sometimes even of decadence
[1:31:27] or degeneration
[1:31:29] and decadence is a luxurious
[1:31:32] self-indulgent.
[1:31:34] Does it sound familiar?
[1:31:37] describes a decline
[1:31:40] due to erosion of moral
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; ethical and sexual traditions.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; I say friends, we've arrived again.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; But that happened at that time for one
[1:31:54] purpose. God allowed that kingdom. It
[1:31:56] blew in and that kingdom in Greek be
[1:31:59] Greece became a great a great kingdom
[1:32:03] and it actually gave birth to the Roman
[1:32:05] kingdom at about 31 BC just before
[1:32:09] Jesus. Why? Because Rome had to come
[1:32:12] into dominance to crucify the savior.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Where's Rome today?
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Where's Greece today? Where's all the
[1:32:24] philosophers? Where's all these wise
[1:32:26] men? Where's all of this? And whether it
[1:32:30] went
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; they know not.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; I can tell you it did come.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you it did go.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; And from whence it came, they can't
[1:32:43] really say.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; And they may say, "Well, man, you know,
[1:32:47] man, we established schools and
[1:32:50] universities and colleges."
[1:32:53] I tell you what, even in the United
[1:32:55] States of America, Canada, the Western
[1:32:57] world, it's only it's only given what it
[1:33:00] is for one purpose. That's because God
[1:33:02] knew he was going to send a message at
[1:33:04] this hour. And the only important thing
[1:33:07] is the spoken word of God.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; And so the prophet comes up and begins
[1:33:16] to speak the first message that's
[1:33:17] recorded, faith is the substance. And he
[1:33:20] says his first word, "We have a new
[1:33:22] gadget."
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; The tape recorder.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; You think the tape recorder was made for
[1:33:28] the military? Not a chance.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; And the world says that the that the uh
[1:33:34] uh computer was made for the military.
[1:33:36] Not a chance.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; The computer was made that that spoken
[1:33:39] word, that prophet's message would get
[1:33:42] up into the heavens and go completely
[1:33:44] around the earth. And that's the
[1:33:46] purpose.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:54] And God raised up a nation whose spirit
[1:33:57] was to seek wisdom. For the Bible says,
[1:34:00] "For the Jews require a sign, but the
[1:34:03] Greeks seek after wisdom." God gave them
[1:34:07] that spirit.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching a little bit of what I
[1:34:12] preached to brother Tim Puit at the
[1:34:14] camp.
[1:34:15] And one thing that for all those in
[1:34:19] America,
[1:34:20] America,
[1:34:22] and I said this to them, I said, "One
[1:34:25] thing that I've admired about America is
[1:34:28] their uh loyalty
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; and patriotism.
[1:34:33] I I I admire that patriotism."
[1:34:36] Yay. USA, the greatest on earth. We have
[1:34:41] the World Series and the World and the
[1:34:44] World. I said I'll say to you is I said
[1:34:46] to them it's not the world
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; the USA happens to be 4.46 of the
[1:34:52] population of the world little less than
[1:34:54] 5%. The World Series and 5%
[1:34:59] excuse me
[1:35:02] don't make me an enemy now you're my
[1:35:04] best friends.
[1:35:08] 4.46%
[1:35:11] God
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; made America. what it is.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; And part of their patriotism is if it's
[1:35:19] made in the USA, we've got to get it to
[1:35:22] the world.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; We got to export it. And they're
[1:35:26] anointed with economics. But God gave
[1:35:28] them that spirit because he was going to
[1:35:31] send a prophet out of their soil. And
[1:35:34] that message must be exported.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; In every language.
[1:35:44] And this is not just missions, friends.
[1:35:47] This is the focus of this congregation.
[1:35:50] It's the focus of the message. And if we
[1:35:52] lose our focus, we just become a
[1:35:55] structure.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; And if you lose the focus, you just
[1:36:00] become a structure.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, it might be your neighbor. It might
[1:36:06] be some child. Who cares who it is? But
[1:36:09] God has you here and has you raised up
[1:36:12] in this generation for a specific
[1:36:15] purpose.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Don't lose that focus.
[1:36:29] God breathed
[1:36:34] into those words
[1:36:40] of the Old Testament
[1:36:43] because one of them the spirit moved
[1:36:44] upon him.
[1:36:47] And
[1:36:49] hold on to some of these words. The
[1:36:50] burden,
[1:36:52] the burden
[1:36:54] of the word of the Lord
[1:36:56] that came to Malachi.
[1:37:01] Behold,
[1:37:03] the days cometh, says the Lord, and I
[1:37:06] will send you Elijah the prophet,
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; to turn the hearts of the children, the
[1:37:12] fathers to the children,
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; and the children to the fathers. That's
[1:37:17] a spoken word of God.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; But it came by burden. It didn't come
[1:37:23] lightly. It didn't come because a person
[1:37:26] just felt flippant about it
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; or felt at ease in Israel about it.
[1:37:31] You're burdened with the word.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; 400 years of silence.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; And now a prophet is going to speak.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; What's this congregation say?
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; I say amen to that. Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; It blew in.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; 400 years of silence. Whether did it go
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; and the word of God came as holy men of
[1:37:58] God were moved by the Holy Spirit. But
[1:38:01] for 400 years there was no movement.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; And whether it came, they didn't know
[1:38:10] where it came from. But they knew by the
[1:38:12] vindication of this prophet of God, he
[1:38:14] is a prophet and so we will ascribe his
[1:38:17] words and keep it.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; And then 400 years of silence and then
[1:38:22] whether it went I don't know. And here
[1:38:24] it came again.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; And John the Baptist
[1:38:29] raised on the scene. Strange.
[1:38:32] And a wind
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; blew into Israel.
[1:38:38] And they came out of Jerusalem and all
[1:38:41] of Judea and Samaria to see this man
[1:38:46] baptizing. Who was it? Whether did it
[1:38:49] come?
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; And he came to introduce one. He said,
[1:38:55] "There's one among you that's greater
[1:38:57] than I who's who left it. I'm not worthy
[1:39:00] to unbear undo. And I baptize you with
[1:39:04] water, but he shall baptize you with the
[1:39:06] Holy Ghost and with fire." Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; And soon that spirit went out
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; and the masses ceased
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; and all of Judea and Samaria didn't come
[1:39:17] anymore.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And he got a bad name.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Did you hear? He's thrown in jail.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. And did you hear that he had his
[1:39:29] head cut off? He'd been killed. A young
[1:39:32] man. And some probably said just so
[1:39:36] tragic.
[1:39:37] You know, I enjoyed hearing him. I was
[1:39:40] really pricricked when he spoke. I knew
[1:39:43] there was something to it.
[1:39:47] Sorry, folks. Are you listening?
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And whether did it go?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; But he did his work
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; and he was gone.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Right. Whether did the spirit go? And
[1:40:05] now here it was
[1:40:08] in one.
[1:40:10] He says, "I am the life.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; I'm the resurrection.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; I'm the living bread that came from
[1:40:17] heaven.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; No one could say that. Here come a
[1:40:20] different." Now, there's a different
[1:40:22] spirit. And he proved it
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; and there was a vindication to it.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; And people believed on him.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; And then he was getting ready to leave.
[1:40:32] and he stood in end of John's gospel
[1:40:41] and he breathed on them
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; right
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; that act
[1:40:50] it happened in the old testament when
[1:40:52] God breathed
[1:40:54] into Adam and he became a living soul
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; now there was a life there
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; to animate the framework.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; And that was at the conclusion of the
[1:41:09] old creation.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; And now at the beginning of the new
[1:41:15] creation, the creator himself breathes
[1:41:18] on them and say, "Receive ye the Holy
[1:41:21] Ghost."
[1:41:24] because it's his life that must be uh
[1:41:28] perpetuated through them. And they
[1:41:31] cannot do it with human life. They must
[1:41:34] do it with the life of God.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; And if this church exists for any other
[1:41:40] purpose, we're nothing but a church.
[1:41:44] [Applause]
[1:41:51] And he says, "Don't go out and preach,
[1:41:55] but tar in Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:41:57] with power
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; from on high."
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; And I want you to notice, friends,
[1:42:04] here's election.
[1:42:08] Don't think that I'm I don't think I'm
[1:42:10] haywire. No,
[1:42:12] he breathed on them.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; They weren't the only people around,
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; but he breathed on them.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:42:25] Because they were waiting for his words.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; They had heard his words. You have the
[1:42:31] word of eternal life.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; This is a different word.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; It's got to be a different church.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; It's got to be a different kind of
[1:42:38] ministry. This has to have the focus of
[1:42:41] the message in every message. This is
[1:42:44] the message of the hour.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And he breathed on them
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." John
[1:42:51] John, I was appreciated your testimony.
[1:42:55] God began to deal with you. Don't ever
[1:42:57] forget that.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; That's that's exactly that's him.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Keep in communion with him.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Keep in communication with him.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. You'll go through the
[1:43:08] fire. You'll go through anything. There
[1:43:11] are no circumstance in earth that can
[1:43:14] get that can hinder or or take away from
[1:43:17] that life.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:43:23] help me.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Satan hates wherever the spoken word is.
[1:43:30] And if you think you're going to have a
[1:43:31] church without difficulty, if you think
[1:43:33] you're going to have a gathering that
[1:43:35] harbors the spoken word of God, saying,
[1:43:37] "We're going to live it. We're going to
[1:43:39] give a testimony to it. We're going to
[1:43:41] give expression to it. We're going to
[1:43:43] see that it gets out, and the burden of
[1:43:46] the word of the Lord shall be our
[1:43:47] burden. You will not do it without
[1:43:49] persecution. You will not do it without
[1:43:52] reproach. You will not do it with every
[1:43:54] without the things that Jesus suffered.
[1:43:56] We'll suffer it all. But we suffered
[1:43:58] with joy.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me folks in the balcony?
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Raise your hand in the balcony so I
[1:44:08] know. Hallelujah.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; I want to see this same life, this same
[1:44:15] Holy Spirit coming in this building
[1:44:17] today.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching to hear my voice. I'm
[1:44:22] preaching that I might that he might
[1:44:24] confirm what I've said
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; as the absolute truth.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; And if he speaks conviction, he'll come
[1:44:30] to convict the world of sin. And if he
[1:44:33] comes with conviction, you get rid of
[1:44:35] that conviction now by confessing it.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; And the only way to get rid of it is to
[1:44:40] repent. This place is a living body of
[1:44:43] believers.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; And this place is a place of prayer.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Just get rid of that conviction.
[1:44:53] Forgive me, Lord. What's difficult about
[1:44:55] that?
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Lord.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for my last condition.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for the things I've spoken.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for the attitudes I've held.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; It's not worth it.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; We want to be a pure, clean vessel.
[1:45:23] And the spirit of God moved over that
[1:45:24] part of the earth in a local place in
[1:45:29] called Palestine for the specific
[1:45:31] purpose to turn the hearts of the
[1:45:33] fathers to the children. I said, "Did he
[1:45:35] do it?"
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Did he do it?
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; One more time. Did he do it?
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Faithful
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; spirit of Elijah. Amen.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; He says, "And they were baptized of him
[1:45:52] in Jordan, confessing their sins." Once
[1:45:55] that was accomplished, the breath of the
[1:45:57] wind of God moved on.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Whence did it go?
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Whether did it go?
[1:46:04] I don't know.
[1:46:06] But that was God life.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; And he's going to continue.
[1:46:13] I'm coming to your address, young men.
[1:46:16] You hang on to your seats.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; It's got to pass off to somebody.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Young ladies,
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; young families
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; to take your place.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Not to hold a structure together
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; to give framework
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; through which the life of God
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; in this living spoken word can continue.
[1:46:40] Amen.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, we have to have jobs. And the God
[1:46:43] goes to that job.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; God goes to that bus, brother David. God
[1:46:50] goes to that house. God goes to that
[1:46:52] shopping center. You sisters, God goes
[1:46:54] there.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; And you have to know that when you're
[1:46:57] wheeling that cart around, I have God in
[1:47:00] me.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. This thing is Satan's Eden, but I'm
[1:47:03] greater than Satan's Eden.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:47:10] You're in school, in the education
[1:47:12] realm, and whatever more. Uh, but don't
[1:47:15] forget, you've got a purpose in this
[1:47:17] life.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And your purpose isn't just for higher
[1:47:20] education. For higher education that you
[1:47:22] might attain something else, per
[1:47:25] eternal, permanent for the kingdom of
[1:47:27] God.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus was leaving, then he
[1:47:31] breathed on them and said, "Receive ye
[1:47:34] the Holy Ghost."
[1:47:36] And there's a notation here. Just as the
[1:47:38] original creation was completed, the
[1:47:42] original creation in Genesis was
[1:47:44] completed by an act of God. So the new
[1:47:47] creation was completed by an act of God
[1:47:50] in flesh.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; The head of the new creation.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful, friends? That's
[1:47:56] where we came from. Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; And when they were all gathered together
[1:48:05] in one place in one accord,
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; a mighty rushing wind and I'm sorry. I'm
[1:48:13] very sorry. Just comes to me now.
[1:48:16] There's two places in two messages and
[1:48:19] but one in spec in particular. Listen
[1:48:22] close. I believe it's West Palm Beach,
[1:48:27] Florida.
[1:48:30] And my I asked my wife, I said, "Find
[1:48:32] the place." We found the place. We
[1:48:34] failed to get it to the brothers on
[1:48:35] time. I want you to hear it. And the
[1:48:38] prophet of God is speaking about the
[1:48:40] Holy Spirit coming and the wind of God
[1:48:42] and the mighty rushing wind and it just
[1:48:44] goes
[1:48:47] right through the building louder than
[1:48:50] the people's praises and everything
[1:48:52] else. I tell you,
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; do we have a message that's confirmed
[1:48:57] and confirmed and confirmed over and
[1:48:59] over? How many times does he have to do
[1:49:02] it?
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; How many times like like Tommy Osborne
[1:49:06] says, "How many times does God have to
[1:49:08] do it for people to believe?"
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; I heard it once, he said.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; We've heard it many more times and he
[1:49:15] didn't even hear what we have heard.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:22] And they were gathered in the upper
[1:49:24] room.
[1:49:25] And there came a sound as a rushing
[1:49:29] mighty wind,
[1:49:32] and it filled all of them
[1:49:36] that were in the place. and the rushing
[1:49:40] wind. It says it says of this
[1:49:46] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:49:48] and they were all in one accord in one
[1:49:49] place and suddenly suddenly whence it
[1:49:52] came we know not
[1:49:56] I don't know where it came
[1:50:00] a sound from heaven as of a rushing
[1:50:02] mighty wind and it filled all the house
[1:50:04] where they were sitting and there
[1:50:06] appeared unto them cloven tongues lick
[1:50:07] as of fire and it sat upon each one of
[1:50:10] them and They were all filled with the
[1:50:12] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:50:14] tongues or languages as the spirit gave
[1:50:17] them utterance, a rushing mighty wind, a
[1:50:20] new message. The greatest week in
[1:50:23] history in all of history has happened.
[1:50:26] The first time that a man that a god,
[1:50:29] the God man
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; has lived, died, and rose again. And the
[1:50:35] prophet and the messengers of that there
[1:50:37] were the apostles all of them well known
[1:50:41] and unknown those that had been visible
[1:50:44] those were not very visible and they
[1:50:46] said and we are witnesses
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; this thing happened and we are witnesses
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; somebody could have said well you
[1:50:54] produce it that's beside the point
[1:50:56] that's irrelevant we are witnesses of
[1:50:59] what God did
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; that's what we are witnesses of what he
[1:51:04] did
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; and they said a rushing wind. And this
[1:51:08] rushing wind is to carry some burden.
[1:51:12] The burden of the word of the Lord.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; This is a rushing wind to carry a
[1:51:16] burden.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; We don't know how far or how long, but
[1:51:20] we've been sent to carry a burden.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; And it is to move by bearing with the
[1:51:27] suggestion of force and speed. And the
[1:51:30] prophet said it's an urgent message. Do
[1:51:32] you people of Cloverdale Bible way
[1:51:34] accept it? It's an urgent message.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; We haven't got lifetimes to carry it.
[1:51:40] You've been called at this late hour.
[1:51:42] Late late hour in a place that's it's a
[1:51:45] duplicate of what it was in the in the
[1:51:47] great Greek kingdom in the great Roman
[1:51:50] kingdom. It has sunk down into
[1:51:52] immorality into filth and such
[1:51:55] vulgarity. I'm almost ashamed to live
[1:51:58] here. Listen friends, I was in New York
[1:52:01] a few days ago. I was at LaGuardia
[1:52:04] Airlines, uh, LaGuardia Airport, rather,
[1:52:07] and and we had a little time and I said,
[1:52:09] "Let's get a little bite to eat." And
[1:52:12] there's a place and you could sit down
[1:52:13] on this side and and you could receive
[1:52:15] your bun or sandwich or something over
[1:52:18] here, just help yourself sort of thing
[1:52:19] and pay your bill.
[1:52:22] So I walked up and and the place was
[1:52:25] just absolute tens of thousands of
[1:52:28] people and the noise
[1:52:31] and and at first do we want to get
[1:52:33] something to eat? So I said to the lady,
[1:52:35] uh,
[1:52:37] can can we sit down here someplace?
[1:52:39] Well, yeah, you can sit. I said, is do
[1:52:41] they wait on us here? Well, yeah, you
[1:52:43] just sit down. I said, will you take our
[1:52:45] order? No, you you just punch it on the
[1:52:47] iPad. I looked on every table had iPad
[1:52:51] and I I just didn't want to
[1:52:54] do anymore. I got an iPad and my wife
[1:52:56] has an iPad and I said I said to her,
[1:52:58] "What happens if you don't know how to
[1:53:00] run it?" Oh, she says, "I'll help you."
[1:53:03] So, we sit down. She goes, "Oh, it's not
[1:53:06] working. It's I can rub it all off. Get
[1:53:09] another page. Start all over again."
[1:53:11] Finally, some pictures came up. She
[1:53:13] says, "You know what? What do you want?"
[1:53:15] So,
[1:53:16] I can't smell the picture. I mean,
[1:53:21] I guess we I guess we'll have that. So,
[1:53:23] you just poke that. And I thought, man,
[1:53:25] where are we? Where are we? And then and
[1:53:28] then then we sat there. Our order is
[1:53:30] gone now. We poked the right thing. And
[1:53:33] and we we sat there and and the music
[1:53:36] then then then I'm listening to all the
[1:53:38] sounds. I'm trying to I'm trying to
[1:53:39] decipher the different sounds because,
[1:53:42] you know, I could have been stoned deaf
[1:53:45] and I'd have still heard plenty.
[1:53:50] And some woman was screaming out her
[1:53:52] lungs on the other side. I was just
[1:53:53] wishing somebody should put her out of
[1:53:55] her misery.
[1:53:57] That's just terrible. That woman must be
[1:54:00] suffering something terrible. And she
[1:54:02] just screaming out.
[1:54:07] And I thought I couldn't understand a
[1:54:09] word. And then over here they're
[1:54:11] announcing the late flights and
[1:54:13] everything was late. So the flights and
[1:54:15] they were competing with her and they
[1:54:18] were telling that this flight has
[1:54:19] changed and you go down to A19 and you
[1:54:22] know and and I couldn't even make it out
[1:54:24] and I looked at the people. I saw how
[1:54:26] everyone was dressed and so on and I
[1:54:28] just began to see a whole big picture.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; We're in hell.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; We're in hell. I said I said this is a
[1:54:36] combination of hell and an and insane
[1:54:38] institution all at the same time.
[1:54:41] I said to my wife we are in an insane
[1:54:43] institution. She says absolutely we're
[1:54:45] an insane institution. I said all this
[1:54:47] noise and everything get me out of here
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; as fast as I can. I'm just getting to be
[1:54:52] a nervous wreck.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Blessed quietness.
[1:55:00] Holy quietness.
[1:55:03] What assurance in my soul
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; on the stormy sea. He speaks peace to
[1:55:11] me. And how the billows
[1:55:14] ceased to roll.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Well, the billows wouldn't cease to roll
[1:55:18] there. So, I got up and left.
[1:55:24] But in the midst of this chaos,
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:55:28] And I thought much about this
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God blew in.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Spirit of God blew in
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; to the Lord Tweeds High School.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; And there's several ste sitting here
[1:55:43] yet.
[1:55:45] Who all went to the Lord Tweeds High
[1:55:47] School?
[1:55:49] Would you raise your hands?
[1:55:52] One,
[1:55:53] two.
[1:55:58] Janet, did you go to Lord?
[1:56:01] David, three,
[1:56:03] I know. Linda went Marilyn. You went.
[1:56:06] Where's your hand? What's that mean?
[1:56:11] Anita,
[1:56:13] people are ashamed to have gone to that
[1:56:15] school.
[1:56:19] But you know what happened?
[1:56:21] A wind
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; was it?
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; A wind blew in.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; A wind blew into that school. I'm
[1:56:31] talking about a wind, a breath of God.
[1:56:34] And they started coming and and and the
[1:56:37] wind had blown upon yours truly. And we
[1:56:41] had an empty house downtown and that
[1:56:44] became Bible Way House.
[1:56:47] And this wind,
[1:56:49] this wind, they came, they came stoned
[1:56:53] and they came drunk. One was so drunk he
[1:56:58] was 6'5 or 6'6 and he'd hover over
[1:57:01] Maryland back there and and you know,
[1:57:04] ridiculed her about some stuff. And and
[1:57:06] I got fed up. I said, "You tell that big
[1:57:09] guy. You tell him the next time he comes
[1:57:12] to you, you look up in his face and you
[1:57:15] tell him, "My father said I'm to tell
[1:57:17] you you're a chicken.
[1:57:21] You're not a great big hulk. You're a
[1:57:22] chicken. You're afraid to come to that
[1:57:25] place." And he was afraid. Doesn't
[1:57:27] matter how big, how strong, how
[1:57:29] muscular, how many steroids a person
[1:57:32] takes,
[1:57:34] they're scared.
[1:57:37] and he himself walked up and was
[1:57:38] standing before the hedge and he
[1:57:41] actually fell over the hedge drunk
[1:57:45] without coming in. But you know what? He
[1:57:48] came in.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; He blew in
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; and God blew into his life.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Furthermore,
[1:57:56] 530 of the prophet's messages were
[1:58:00] cleaned. I'm talking about cleaned by
[1:58:03] him, filtered by him in a room. Took
[1:58:06] four years.
[1:58:08] Whether did it come, I don't know.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know how it happened. Whether
[1:58:13] did it go, I'm not sure. But I can tell
[1:58:15] you one thing. It happened.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about young men from school,
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; With a mind to do something for God.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:31] just being available. Can I just finish,
[1:58:34] please? Can you give me another few
[1:58:35] minutes?
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Have we got that 90 second clip?
[1:58:51] This This is just a informal. I I didn't
[1:58:54] do this. I just found this. It it shows
[1:58:56] uh
[1:58:58] just the spreading of of of uh
[1:59:01] Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism and so
[1:59:04] on, Islam.
[1:59:06] Uh if we don't have it, I'll let's
[1:59:09] continue on
[1:59:12] here. We'll need the lights right down.
[1:59:18] That was quite self-explanatory.
[1:59:25] birth of Abraham and Judaism and that's
[1:59:27] where it was conquest of Katan Canaan
[1:59:33] that's Africa uh North Africa and the
[1:59:38] Arab states h ch India over here and
[1:59:41] there's Hinduism death of Jesus
[1:59:47] and Christianity
[1:59:48] and just immediately following that then
[1:59:51] Christianity
[1:59:53] that Buddhism over east and China and
[1:59:57] Christianity.
[1:59:59] The birth of Muhammad and Islam, Islam
[2:00:02] now in green, Islam spreading like that.
[2:00:06] Muslim conquest, Muslim conquest, Muslim
[2:00:09] conquest and Islam came over there. in
[2:00:13] Christianity.
[2:00:18] Christianity versus Islam they say and
[2:00:22] watch Christianity.
[2:00:25] This is just Christianity as a whole.
[2:00:27] Those that believe
[2:00:30] believe in Jesus Christ,
[2:00:35] missions abroad,
[2:00:43] Israel founded. Can you find Israel?
[2:00:48] Not a very big spot.
[2:00:51] That's where it all started.
[2:00:54] Abraham was there. The prophets were
[2:00:56] there and they sent this word. Look at
[2:00:58] where it went. All right, you can turn
[2:01:00] it off.
[2:01:16] I'm going to close in a few minutes, but
[2:01:18] I'm not done quite.
[2:01:21] Brother Brandham said in the message,
[2:01:22] "Look,
[2:01:24] if you can focus your camera till you
[2:01:26] can see that," he was speaking of
[2:01:28] something specific. He says, "And know
[2:01:30] it cost the life of God
[2:01:34] himself when he made his life here.
[2:01:37] Didn't have to give it up. He laid it
[2:01:40] down freely. He was God." Listen,
[2:01:43] church, he was God. He didn't have to
[2:01:47] die, but he did it freely. Amen.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Gave his own life that he might bring
[2:01:54] sons to him.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; That his work might continue on. That
[2:01:58] his work might continue on. May I say it
[2:02:01] again
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; to you that are alive in this day? That
[2:02:04] his work may continue on.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Not a bunch more structure.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; But his work.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; His work. He is the word. He is not just
[2:02:18] a Bible or just not just books and not
[2:02:21] just tapes. He's a living word, the
[2:02:24] spirit of truth.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; And the work that I do, John 14:12, the
[2:02:30] work that I do, you will do also. If the
[2:02:34] things could be done like that and you
[2:02:36] can see him and see him only
[2:02:40] and see him only, I'd like to I'll take
[2:02:43] John's
[2:02:47] John often asks you to say a word. Could
[2:02:50] you say only for me?
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Only to see him only. Now let's say him
[2:02:58] only.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Him only.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Not the church.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Not that church. This church, not that
[2:03:06] denomination, another denomination. Him
[2:03:09] only. Amen.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; If we can see him only,
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; then you'll get your camera in focus.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Not till you see him only.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; When you see him only, then you'll know
[2:03:25] my camera's in focus. My life's in
[2:03:28] focus. Now I have purpose for this
[2:03:30] structure. Now I have purpose for the
[2:03:33] church I go to. And I'm happy to clean
[2:03:36] it or do whatever I have to do because I
[2:03:38] see him only.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; And he says a camera in focus to see a
[2:03:49] place to where God can use you
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; certainly.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Now in these last days and I'm closing
[2:03:57] with this and this was really the heart
[2:04:00] of my message. You are here.
[2:04:04] You may be here as guests.
[2:04:07] Some may have come as a result of the
[2:04:09] baby dedication or whatever more. You're
[2:04:12] not here because the baby was dedicated.
[2:04:14] You're here because God wanted you to
[2:04:16] hear this.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; You may have just been invited or you
[2:04:22] may be visiting for the first time. God
[2:04:25] wants you to hear this.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm I'm closing in just a few
[2:04:30] moments, but give me your attention.
[2:04:34] Oh, here comes now
[2:04:37] another wind
[2:04:39] begins to blow. Here's a boy.
[2:04:42] God works in such strange way you
[2:04:44] couldn't duplicate it again.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; And he's carrying water to his father's
[2:04:50] still.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; His father's a bootleggger.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; His father's an alcoholic.
[2:04:57] The family is Catholic. And he's
[2:05:00] carrying in two little cans water to the
[2:05:03] still to make more alcohol.
[2:05:06] He says, "And I heard
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; a wind blowing."
[2:05:16] And it was real still everywhere. And I
[2:05:18] wondered where that sound was coming
[2:05:20] from. It was a tall tree that I was
[2:05:23] sitting under.
[2:05:25] And I stepped back to look around to see
[2:05:28] where that was coming from, where the
[2:05:31] wind was coming from. and about halfway
[2:05:32] up the tree about the size of a barrel
[2:05:35] and the leaves were going around and
[2:05:38] around. You know, it could have been
[2:05:40] Moses telling the people while I was
[2:05:42] standing there and the sheep were behind
[2:05:44] me and I I was standing there with my
[2:05:46] staff and I I saw this bush and it
[2:05:49] looked like it was on fire and I I drew
[2:05:52] I was attracted and it drew near I drew
[2:05:54] near to it and there was a flame that
[2:05:56] was burning and suddenly I heard a voice
[2:06:00] [Applause]
[2:06:02] I'm the God of Abraham,
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Remove your shoes.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, friends, a challenge to
[2:06:12] you. They believed him.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Believed him to action.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Believed him to say, "What did he say?
[2:06:27] That's true.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; And about halfway up the tree, about the
[2:06:32] size of a barrel, the leaves were going
[2:06:34] around and around and around, milling in
[2:06:36] the tree. And a voice came out of the
[2:06:38] tree saying, "Don't you never smoke?"
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; That voice,
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; hear me had you specifically in mind.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; That's the all knowing God. that voice
[2:06:52] had you in mind because knew that one
[2:06:55] day I'm going to speak to some other
[2:06:57] people.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to use this vessel. I'm going
[2:07:03] to send out this voice. I'm going to use
[2:07:05] technology that's just being invented. I
[2:07:09] will use that which Cain has devised in
[2:07:12] Satan's Eden. I will use it, but it'll
[2:07:15] be my voice that will be going out and
[2:07:18] people will be quipped by my voice.
[2:07:22] And they shall love my voice.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; And it will be the voice of the
[2:07:28] bridegroom.
[2:07:29] [Applause]
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; And to others, they will hate the voice.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; And some will say, "Oh, he's a good
[2:07:38] teacher, nice preacher, so he he screams
[2:07:41] or he does this." But others will say,
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; "Well, what did he say?
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; I love that voice.
[2:07:49] Amen.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; What have we done, brother Mike?
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Hear this message.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Don't you never smoke or drink
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; or defile your body in any way? There'll
[2:08:05] be a work for you to do
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; when you get older. And I want you to
[2:08:11] bring I want to bring you to Miami,
[2:08:13] Florida. Not to Miami, West Palm Beach,
[2:08:16] Florida. I want to play. I will still do
[2:08:19] it, Lord willing. And when it comes over
[2:08:22] these speakers, I guarantee you, you're
[2:08:24] going to get goosebumps.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; That's the voice and the messenger that
[2:08:32] was sent
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; in this day
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; to you folks.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; To you folks,
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; to you young men, ladies, you folks. You
[2:08:41] folks, us folks.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; That's the voice.
[2:08:47] That's the focus.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose that all this
[2:08:51] structure even exists.
[2:08:53] [Applause]
[2:08:55] [Music]
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; And whether he goeth,
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; I trust to go with him.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[2:09:10] believeth on me, the work that I do
[2:09:12] shall he do also, and greater works than
[2:09:15] these shall he do, because I go to my
[2:09:17] father.
[2:09:21] Now listen real close. I'm at the
[2:09:23] actually the hub of my whole service.
[2:09:26] I spent so much time and then God raised
[2:09:30] up. There has to be people that will
[2:09:32] raise this voice.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; So I will I will introduce
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; a Pentecost. And the wind blew into
[2:09:39] Isuza Street. How many have heard of
[2:09:41] Isuza Street?
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Show me your hands. And the wind blew
[2:09:45] into Isuza Street. Go on Google and go
[2:09:48] to Isuza Street and read what happened.
[2:09:50] And uh and the wind blew into Isuza
[2:09:52] Street. And uh it was a black brother
[2:09:55] that was the pastor had one eye and only
[2:09:58] one eye. Brother Bam, Daddy Seymour, and
[2:10:00] he was standing there. But it had also
[2:10:02] happened in a in a Kansas, I believe, in
[2:10:05] a Bible school uh run by a brother
[2:10:07] Parnum. And there were there was other
[2:10:10] early Pentecostal fathers, and Pentecost
[2:10:13] blew in. And they were having this uh
[2:10:16] they were having like what would be a
[2:10:17] seminar, but they were having gatherings
[2:10:20] and they were having prayer meetings and
[2:10:22] they prayed earnestly. And this woman,
[2:10:25] one woman in Isuza Street began to speak
[2:10:27] in an unknown language. And they didn't
[2:10:30] know what was happening. And then it
[2:10:32] just went like a flame. Went like a
[2:10:34] fire. But the focus went from the life
[2:10:37] that was causing that to speaking in
[2:10:40] tongues. You had to speak in tongues.
[2:10:43] And so they became distracted. They
[2:10:46] became distracted. And then we got to
[2:10:48] establish. We got to establish and have
[2:10:50] Bible schools and train men. And we got
[2:10:52] to have meetings. And we've got to
[2:10:53] establish churches because people have
[2:10:55] to speak in tongues. That became the
[2:10:58] focus. That was only something that God
[2:11:00] did at that time. Are you with me? Do
[2:11:03] you understand it?
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; But God had a further purpose. Listen
[2:11:06] now, I'm preaching. And God had a
[2:11:08] further purpose. He was raising up a
[2:11:10] whole movement. A whole movement that
[2:11:13] would be all over the earth called the
[2:11:15] great Pentecostal movement. The last
[2:11:17] age,
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; the Leodysian age. that would receive
[2:11:24] the messenger
[2:11:26] and hear him and give open doors. And
[2:11:30] because of that, and he said, "You
[2:11:31] Pentecostal people received me." He
[2:11:33] said, "I was as one born out of due
[2:11:36] season for you." But the purpose was to
[2:11:39] advance the spoken word.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Now, a prophet is in the land. And this
[2:11:47] whole movement suddenly has a new
[2:11:49] purpose. And they thought, "Oh, this man
[2:11:52] will cause our movement to grow, our
[2:11:55] organization to grow." God's not
[2:11:58] interested in the organization. He not
[2:12:01] interested in the denomination.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; He raised it up like he raises up
[2:12:06] empires and nations and kingdoms to give
[2:12:09] advancement to his word.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; And they moved his word
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; and it faded off the scene
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; and began to decline.
[2:12:20] and go into a backsliden state.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; And in 1952,
[2:12:25] God raises up the Christian Businessman
[2:12:28] International by Deus Shakarion. Why?
[2:12:32] Because God knew the organization would
[2:12:36] shut the door and they'd use a
[2:12:38] non-denominational group of businessmen
[2:12:41] to give it to to advance it and to keep
[2:12:44] doors open until the message could be
[2:12:47] heard. Amen.
[2:12:50] [Applause]
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; And he raised up certain men like Carl
[2:12:54] Williams. And Carl Williams said to the
[2:12:57] Christian businessman, he was a powerful
[2:12:59] man in Phoenix. And he said, "If you if
[2:13:01] you close the door on William Brandham,
[2:13:03] I'm leaving."
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; And I was I was present in some of the
[2:13:10] last last times know the difficulty. And
[2:13:13] you can feel the air turns almost
[2:13:15] acidic.
[2:13:19] because they're even closing the door
[2:13:22] because God hear me now. Because God
[2:13:24] knew there'd be another fresh breath of
[2:13:28] air, another breeze of the Holy Spirit,
[2:13:31] and people like you and I would begin to
[2:13:34] see this is God's message.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; This is the word of God. This is the
[2:13:40] opening of the scripture. This is the
[2:13:43] opening of the word of God.
[2:13:46] [Applause]
[2:13:48] and we enter into a relationship with
[2:13:51] what is in the book.
[2:13:53] [Applause]
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Now, here's where I'm going to lose some
[2:13:57] of you, and I hope I don't lose anybody.
[2:14:14] I came to you Pentecostal people
[2:14:20] kind of late.
[2:14:24] I'm one born out of due season,
[2:14:31] but I remember reading history in Isuza
[2:14:33] Street.
[2:14:52] Now I want you, he said
[2:14:55] him speaking,
[2:14:58] visitors and all, young people, mothers,
[2:15:01] listen close. I want you all
[2:15:06] to be very careful here
[2:15:09] and see this.
[2:15:12] God has promised
[2:15:15] that at the end time Malachi 4
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; is going to be fulfilled.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; It has to be for it has to it is the
[2:15:26] spirit quickened word of God
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; spoken by the prophet of Malachi.
[2:15:33] Jesus referred to it.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; It's just before Christ comes the second
[2:15:38] time.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; And by the time Jesus comes,
[2:15:44] all scripture must be fulfilled.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; The Gentile dispensation will be in its
[2:15:52] last church age.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; That's why there'll be no more after
[2:15:56] Pentecost.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; And you can't denominate this message.
[2:16:00] It doesn't say people can't leave it or
[2:16:02] backslide or whatever more. You can't
[2:16:05] denominate the message. You may be left
[2:16:07] with just a structure. But the you can't
[2:16:10] denominate the message because the
[2:16:12] message is Jesus Christ. Nobody can
[2:16:14] handle and and put Jesus Christ into a
[2:16:16] human framework.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; When they think they have whether he
[2:16:21] went, he's gone
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; and all they're left is holding an empty
[2:16:25] framework. Oh, we got a church. We got
[2:16:28] singers. We got this beautiful choir.
[2:16:30] All the rest of it
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; doesn't mean a thing.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; The gentile dispensation will be in its
[2:16:40] last age when that messenger of Malachi
[2:16:43] for Malachi comes.
[2:16:45] And here's three lines.
[2:16:48] And I want you to hear it. You've heard
[2:16:49] it many times perhaps, but maybe no time
[2:16:52] like this.
[2:16:54] He will be right with the word.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care how many ifs, buts,
[2:17:03] whatever these human little puny,
[2:17:05] insignificant minds try to figure out
[2:17:08] about the word of God. You only show
[2:17:10] your ignorance by even asking.
[2:17:12] [Music]
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; The first thing you need to deal with is
[2:17:17] all the vindication.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:20] deal with him saying to this woman,
[2:17:22] "Deal with what I heard and or what
[2:17:24] brother Sam heard, what I read uh
[2:17:26] yesterday morning, deal with this one."
[2:17:29] And he tells her all about her her her
[2:17:31] illness and disease and so on. Then he
[2:17:34] says, "And
[2:17:36] don't they call you Eva?"
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; York.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; And you live at 613
[2:17:46] 6th Street.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Answer that.
[2:17:50] Where did that come from?
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; What's that got to do? Oh, it was a
[2:17:56] beautiful building. It was a great
[2:17:58] auditorium. The the sound system was
[2:18:00] this or the uh or the air conditioner
[2:18:02] was that? Who gives a care?
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; The messenger
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; was speaking.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; And you think that woman said, "Well, I
[2:18:13] I think the carpet's the wrong color."
[2:18:16] No. She was so anxious. Yes, my name's
[2:18:18] Eva. And yes, my last name is York. And
[2:18:22] yes, I live at 613. And she could go out
[2:18:24] of there saying, "God spoke to me.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. That's why we're
[2:18:35] in existence.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose." Amen.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; And he he will take this messenger will
[2:18:46] take
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; this now close. This is not a preacher
[2:18:49] just preaching.
[2:18:51] He will take the whole Bible.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; He will take the whole Bible. Friends,
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know what means this to you, but
[2:19:06] without this, you're going to be nothing
[2:19:09] but a teaspoon of dust and ashes.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; He will take the whole Bible
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; from Genesis
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; to Revelation.
[2:19:27] He will start at the serpent seed.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; That's where it started.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; And he will carry on. He will carry on
[2:19:35] from the serpent seed. He will carry on
[2:19:40] through the scripture
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; through every move and every breath of
[2:19:43] God, every breath that blew in, kingdoms
[2:19:48] rose, kingdoms fell. God's men came. The
[2:19:51] Savior came and he will carry on to the
[2:19:54] very end
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; to the to the messenger
[2:19:58] in
[2:20:01] the latter rain,
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; the teaching rain.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; The rain is there will be a messenger in
[2:20:11] the latter rain.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; I said to my wife, "Isn't there a song
[2:20:16] they used to sing? That was a a a song
[2:20:19] in the world. Just a whirly song.
[2:20:21] There's a a a voice in the wind. Yeah. I
[2:20:26] think that was it. Voice in the wind or
[2:20:29] sound in the wind or was that Margaret
[2:20:33] voice in the wind? I said they didn't
[2:20:35] know what they were saying.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; There is a voice in the wind.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; I heard that voice.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; And I'm not ashamed, friends. I'm not
[2:20:45] ashamed in the least to say I'm not
[2:20:47] ashamed in the least to say that voice
[2:20:50] has holding power.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what kind of wind or
[2:20:55] what kind of persecution or what happens
[2:20:57] to you. The voice in the wind, the voice
[2:21:01] in that breeze will hold you and you
[2:21:04] come through
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; and whether it come
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; I do not know.
[2:21:15] And we had a whole wind blow through the
[2:21:19] school and they even said what's
[2:21:20] happening.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Do you know down Lord Twemer school they
[2:21:24] put up banners of some of the young
[2:21:26] people who've been changed transformed
[2:21:28] overnight.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Listen to me kids
[2:21:34] in grades 8 through to 12. Almost 25
[2:21:38] came
[2:21:40] and almost 25 were killed
[2:21:43] one for one.
[2:21:46] And when the wind went,
[2:21:49] you say that was tragic.
[2:21:52] There was a young man
[2:21:54] and he came
[2:21:57] and he was affected
[2:21:59] and he
[2:22:02] he wanted to he wanted to believe. He
[2:22:04] knew that something was to it.
[2:22:07] and he came and I was there and we just
[2:22:09] finished our little service. The place
[2:22:11] was packed. People were sitting up on
[2:22:14] the steps. In fact, we didn't have room
[2:22:16] for them. 50, 60 people. It was a wind.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; They couldn't help themselves. Brother
[2:22:23] Jim, they couldn't help themselves. They
[2:22:25] were just attracted and drawn like bees
[2:22:28] to the honey.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Kyle, I'm here to say to you,
[2:22:32] it's a wind in Victoria.
[2:22:35] And where it come from, we don't know.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; And when it's gone, you can never bring
[2:22:39] it back. You can have better musicians
[2:22:41] in a nicer place, in a nicer structure.
[2:22:44] You cannot repeat what's happening
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; you at SFU. I say you want to thank God
[2:22:53] for what's happening at SFU
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; and just realize that there's a there's
[2:22:57] a messenger in the wind.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not just speaking idle words,
[2:23:05] friends. And I said to this young man,
[2:23:08] I knew that the Holy Spirit was on him.
[2:23:12] And the little flighty girl that was on
[2:23:15] his arm was a Baptist minister's
[2:23:19] daughter.
[2:23:20] She just had too much religion.
[2:23:23] And she just said, she grabbed him by
[2:23:25] the arm right while I was talking to
[2:23:27] him. She said, "Let's get out of here."
[2:23:30] And she walked out. They jumped in their
[2:23:31] car, drove up to drove up to Cam Loops,
[2:23:35] and the car went off the road and he was
[2:23:37] killed.
[2:23:41] Is that the end of it?
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; As far as I know, I don't have any more
[2:23:47] story to tell, but I can tell you she
[2:23:50] will stand before God on the day of
[2:23:53] judgment and give answer for saying,
[2:23:56] "Let's get out of here." when the
[2:23:59] messenger in that breeze was trying to
[2:24:01] speak to him, trying to persuade him,
[2:24:04] and I don't know where he is. Friends,
[2:24:06] when the Holy Spirit's moving, there's
[2:24:08] one thing for us to do. Move.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Move with it.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; We don't pay any attention to the
[2:24:15] structure.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; And that's what happened. When the Holy
[2:24:19] Spirit moved and groups had been formed
[2:24:22] and churches been established and
[2:24:24] ministers have been recognized and
[2:24:26] deacon boards and all kinds of things
[2:24:28] and musicians and everything and the
[2:24:30] structures all in place and then they
[2:24:33] and and it's a it's a critical moment
[2:24:35] that Satan can come in and start to use
[2:24:38] the human reasoning say, you know, well,
[2:24:40] we don't feel the same, but we got to
[2:24:42] keep it going.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; Just got to keep this thing going. Yeah.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; And they'll find find another preacher
[2:24:47] and find another this and find a song
[2:24:50] leader and find something else. And we
[2:24:52] got to keep this going because we got to
[2:24:53] keep it moving.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; That's when it's empty structure.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; And God's not a God. I have the words of
[2:25:09] a prophet who said, "I hate a powerless
[2:25:11] church.
[2:25:12] [Music]
[2:25:15] and hearing you young people being
[2:25:17] Friday night and just sitting at the
[2:25:19] back and seeing over a hundred maybe 150
[2:25:24] young men and young women and those
[2:25:26] counselors that were at the camp
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; and hearing the various testimonies and
[2:25:29] hearing your testimony John.
[2:25:33] God bless you.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you young people. I was just
[2:25:38] in a meeting and I'm ending with this
[2:25:39] truly. I was just in a meeting at
[2:25:41] brother Spencer's and the people coming
[2:25:43] from different places and the place was
[2:25:46] packed and several hundred people there
[2:25:48] and a lot of the ministers and and
[2:25:51] brother PR took two services. I took two
[2:25:53] services and uh
[2:25:56] brother came up to me and he said,
[2:26:00] "I heard you preach once
[2:26:05] and he said, you told me how
[2:26:08] you had a a relationship
[2:26:11] before you were married as a young man.
[2:26:13] You had a relationship with God and the
[2:26:16] Holy Spirit would just spirit of God
[2:26:18] would just move on you." and I worked
[2:26:20] for the Hudson's Bay Company in a
[2:26:23] gatorial.
[2:26:24] I was manager, assistant manager and um
[2:26:28] and the grosserian. So I was in charge
[2:26:30] of the produce
[2:26:35] and the Holy Spirit would come on me and
[2:26:36] I want to I want to express myself so
[2:26:39] bad.
[2:26:41] I just want to tell him how much I loved
[2:26:43] him and thank him for it. I just saw
[2:26:46] beauty everywhere.
[2:26:50] That was the messenger in the in the
[2:26:53] wind.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; And I had to get away from everybody. I
[2:26:57] got to get away. Got to get away. And I
[2:26:59] go between the stacks of the groceries
[2:27:02] and sat and stand there and weep and
[2:27:04] tell him. And here's a man 50, 60 years
[2:27:10] later
[2:27:12] talking to me a few days ago. He said,
[2:27:15] "I never forgot that."
[2:27:18] He said, "That's what I want."
[2:27:21] And he said, "And you and I said, ' And
[2:27:22] I'd go into the cooler." Yeah. He said,
[2:27:24] "You said you'd go in the cooler where
[2:27:26] it was so cold and I knew people
[2:27:29] wouldn't come in there." And I just go
[2:27:32] in there and talk to him.
[2:27:34] And I can tell you, friends, that same
[2:27:37] one that I'm talking about, this is not
[2:27:40] tears of joy or tears of sorrow. They're
[2:27:43] just tears of love.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; And he's still the same today.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking this way because I'd
[2:27:51] love to introduce him to you.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; I'd love for you to be able to know him
[2:27:56] in the same way.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; And you can.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham says, "Don't miss
[2:28:06] this.
[2:28:09] This prophet
[2:28:10] will take
[2:28:13] the whole Bible
[2:28:15] from Genesis
[2:28:17] right through to the messenger
[2:28:21] in the rain.
[2:28:23] To me, that's the crux. That's the whole
[2:28:25] message.
[2:28:27] Why do the message churches exist?
[2:28:30] For one purpose,
[2:28:35] on behalf of him.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:28:47] And I'm absolutely
[2:28:50] consumed
[2:28:52] life.
[2:28:54] Nothing in life means anything outside
[2:28:58] of him.
[2:28:59] people saying, "Well, these are falling
[2:29:01] away and these have this to say and that
[2:29:04] have that to say and that that has
[2:29:06] nothing to do with it, friends."
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; When you when when when you have a
[2:29:11] relationship with him.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; And without that, without without him,
[2:29:18] this is dead.
[2:29:20] A dead framework. The church, everything
[2:29:22] else a dead framework.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me?
[2:29:27] Yes,
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; it's him.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; And when we say the word, we're talking
[2:29:31] about him. A person.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; A person. I've been saying this week and
[2:29:37] saying, "Lord,
[2:29:41] all I want to know is I'm pleasing you.
[2:29:44] I don't care what anyone else thinks. I
[2:29:46] just want to please you." Amen.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Here in this church of Cloverdale,
[2:29:53] if we ever should lose the focus,
[2:29:58] the focus is him.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; The focus is him. Amen.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus,
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; I've tried to speak of you
[2:30:16] through this entire service
[2:30:20] when the wind blew
[2:30:22] all through these places and countries
[2:30:25] and nations and kingdoms and churches
[2:30:27] and seasons and times. s
[2:30:32] and when the wind blew and you raised up
[2:30:34] a Luther and they had a message, the
[2:30:36] just shall live by faith. And that was
[2:30:37] their theme. The just shall live by
[2:30:39] faith shall just shall live by faith.
[2:30:43] But you moved on and now here we are and
[2:30:46] we have a messenger who said there can't
[2:30:48] be anymore.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; And we see that everywhere.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; There can't be anymore.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; And we've entered into a relationship
[2:30:56] with you, Lord. And I'm here standing
[2:30:57] here not as a young man but as a senior.
[2:31:02] And I'm so thankful,
[2:31:04] so thankful. I can declare before these
[2:31:06] people,
[2:31:08] you're more real,
[2:31:10] more precious,
[2:31:12] more wonderful.
[2:31:15] I just want to adore you. I want to give
[2:31:18] you all the praise. You're the same
[2:31:22] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:31:24] Some want to focus that just on healing,
[2:31:26] but you are the healer. And for every
[2:31:29] sick person here, may they rise in the
[2:31:31] name of Jesus Christ and be healed by
[2:31:34] the divine physician, Jesus Christ.
[2:31:39] For any that are here and out of out of
[2:31:41] fellowship with you, Lord, I do not want
[2:31:43] to close this service as a Sunday
[2:31:45] morning service. I want to come to a
[2:31:48] close with you speaking to them and to
[2:31:50] let them know that you are here to step
[2:31:53] beside them now and so that they will
[2:31:55] sense and feel you and know you and you
[2:31:57] will create within them such a desire
[2:32:00] such an intensity and they say Lord I
[2:32:02] must I must have you beside me. I must
[2:32:05] have you in me. Oh come and those that
[2:32:08] may not have the baptism or the
[2:32:10] infilling of the Holy Spirit sweep in.
[2:32:14] Oh God, sweep in. Fill these structures.
[2:32:18] Fill these vessels with the holy divine
[2:32:22] spirit of God.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; Cause us to be the kind of reflection
[2:32:28] that you have. God the prophet
[2:32:31] messenger.
[2:32:32] He he is gone. But we are here. We are
[2:32:36] here to complete this age.
[2:32:39] Father in the name of Jesus I commit
[2:32:42] everyone here for you and to you in
[2:32:46] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:32:53] I want to sing in a more in a moment
[2:32:56] pleasing.
[2:33:00] Now while you're quiet and while you're
[2:33:01] listening just listen
[2:33:05] just come to my mind. you didn't say it.
[2:33:08] And I said, "Yes,
[2:33:10] didn't say it.
[2:33:16] We can't duplicate
[2:33:19] what we speak of in the quotes.
[2:33:22] Your name is Eva,
[2:33:24] last name York.
[2:33:26] You live at 6136th Street." I can't
[2:33:30] duplicate that.
[2:33:32] And
[2:33:35] I could say whether it went,
[2:33:38] I don't know exactly.
[2:33:40] I just know there never was a ministry
[2:33:42] like it. And like Tommy Osburn said,
[2:33:46] "Don't mistake me. That will not happen
[2:33:48] again."
[2:33:49] And he said something very strong. He
[2:33:51] said, "That was God. God walked our way.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; God in flesh once again."
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:59] friends. That ministry passed off the
[2:34:02] sane. And then and then there was a wave
[2:34:05] and there was a move and there were
[2:34:07] people, please excuse the personal
[2:34:10] reference, but there was a brother
[2:34:11] sorrel
[2:34:13] in Australia. There was a Perry Green
[2:34:17] from Bulmont, Texas in Tucson.
[2:34:21] There were other men. There was a
[2:34:22] brother Gunther over in Saskatchewan.
[2:34:25] There was a brother Willard Collins that
[2:34:27] took the church.
[2:34:29] and Jeffersonville
[2:34:31] and there were others and they began to
[2:34:35] carry on and now the word had to be it
[2:34:39] had to be introduced.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; It had to be spoken of
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; and another era came into being and
[2:34:48] there was a lot of mechanics involved.
[2:34:51] There was uh we had to find and seek out
[2:34:54] men that could interpret and translate
[2:34:56] and have a certain education and try to
[2:35:00] find them in Finland and try to find
[2:35:02] them in Poland and try to find them in
[2:35:04] India and several in India for the Tamil
[2:35:07] and Telugu and the Hindi and all the
[2:35:09] different languages and God helped us.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; Did this a man do this? No. 30 years
[2:35:18] friends
[2:35:20] is a messenger
[2:35:22] in the wind.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; If I started to tell you
[2:35:27] and I and my wife were speaking this
[2:35:29] morning, I said, "This has been a most
[2:35:31] supernatural gospel."
[2:35:34] I could not even begin to write the
[2:35:38] miracles and supernatural things and God
[2:35:42] speaking directly and saying this these
[2:35:45] certain words and it happens
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; because it was him
[2:35:50] [Music]
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; right
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; I want to close but I want to also tell
[2:35:55] you there's another era
[2:35:58] [Music]
[2:36:00] brother
[2:36:02] brother brother Lee Vale is gone on
[2:36:07] a lot of other men that were around
[2:36:10] brother Brandham are gone.
[2:36:15] And those that now were with him and
[2:36:17] those that can say I was a witness.
[2:36:21] I stood there and I saw that and I heard
[2:36:24] that your grandpa, Sister Joy,
[2:36:28] Brother Joe
[2:36:30] Riley
[2:36:32] recently gone
[2:36:35] and other men
[2:36:38] have gone. It's another whole era
[2:36:42] that is passing off of the same and we
[2:36:45] do not have much more time. And and and
[2:36:48] as that happens, listen to me now. As
[2:36:51] that happens, I'm burning up with this.
[2:36:53] As that happens, people tend and and and
[2:36:57] Satan gets in right then. That's a
[2:36:59] crisis moment. Gets in right then and
[2:37:02] tries to just index the people to human
[2:37:07] reasoning and human intelligence and to
[2:37:10] structure the thing to keep it going.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. This messenger, the
[2:37:17] Lord Jesus Christ, will never need a
[2:37:20] human structure to keep him going.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; Whence he came, I know not. And whether
[2:37:26] he goeth, I know not. But I can tell you
[2:37:29] one thing, he will keep moving until
[2:37:31] there's a until there's a a a union at
[2:37:35] the marriage supper of the lamb. He will
[2:37:37] keep taking this bride forward until
[2:37:40] there's a trans there's a transformation
[2:37:42] of of the changing of these bodies. It's
[2:37:45] going to happen.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen.
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; You young ladies believe it.
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; This side believe it.
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; This is what we believe.
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; And this is the driving force.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; And it's the only force.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we? Please. We sing.
[2:38:07] Pleasing. Pleasing.
[2:38:14] Let me be pleasing
[2:38:18] to you.
[2:38:21] Let everything
[2:38:23] that
[2:38:25] you
[2:38:27] be pleasing
[2:38:30] to you.
[2:38:32] [Music]
[2:38:38] Let everything
[2:38:41] I pursue
[2:38:45] bees.
[2:38:49] [Music]
[2:39:08] Everything
[2:39:10] I
[2:39:12] do
[2:39:13] [Music]
[2:39:15] pleasing
[2:39:17] to you.
[2:39:19] [Music]
[2:39:21] Pray
[2:39:23] [Music]
[2:39:26] everything
[2:39:28] I pursue
[2:39:32] be pleasing
[2:39:36] [Music]
[2:39:38] to you.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; This lesson before we close, we're going
[2:39:42] to sing it. Going to sing I surrender
[2:39:44] all in a moment.
[2:39:49] Some of you know real well, and I'm
[2:39:52] going to make a statement. Don't go out
[2:39:53] of here the way you came in.
[2:39:57] You come in here hungry. You come in
[2:39:59] here dry. You don't need to go out that
[2:40:01] way. Say, "This is going to change as of
[2:40:05] this moment." You know what I've been
[2:40:07] doing? Dedicating myself in the even the
[2:40:10] last few days. So, I want to be pleasing
[2:40:12] to you, Lord. I don't want to be I don't
[2:40:15] want to be obsessed with taken up with
[2:40:17] structure. I don't want a structure. I
[2:40:20] want you. I want the person. I want
[2:40:23] somebody I can feel.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody I can love. Somebody who can
[2:40:27] respond back.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; If you haven't got that, I'm going to be
[2:40:31] praying for you. Not after you leave.
[2:40:34] I'm going to pray for you while you're
[2:40:35] here. Going to ask all that God has
[2:40:38] spoken to in a very specific way if you
[2:40:41] want to come. And we'll just have a word
[2:40:43] of prayer. It It's good for you to take
[2:40:46] a step, hides out. It takes and exposes
[2:40:50] and just says, "I'm just I'm done with
[2:40:52] this. I'm just not going to stand here
[2:40:54] back in the shadows. I'm going to walk
[2:40:56] up there. I'm going to identify myself.
[2:41:00] I want God to meet with me.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, I want this kind of
[2:41:03] relationship. I want the messenger
[2:41:05] that's in the wind.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; That's what I want in my life.
[2:41:13] We'll sing I surrender all. And then
[2:41:14] we're just going to have prayer and then
[2:41:17] we'll dismiss at that time.
[2:41:21] [Music]
[2:41:26] Jesus
[2:41:28] Christ
[2:41:35] to him.
[2:41:37] [Music]
[2:41:43] I
[2:41:44] will
[2:41:47] love
[2:41:49] and trust in
[2:41:54] his presence.
[2:41:59] Sing
[2:42:00] [Music]
[2:42:07] [Music]
[2:42:21] to meior.
[2:42:29] I
[2:42:31] surrender
[2:42:33] all
[2:42:36] and I'd like a few brothers would you
[2:42:39] come and just join me here
[2:42:42] going to pray for these people.
[2:42:45] We're going to pray together. Just stand
[2:42:47] here. Brother Tom, I think we just stand
[2:42:49] and we'll just pray together
[2:42:54] if two or three are gathered.
[2:42:56] I want you people to know we not may not
[2:42:59] be able to touch you all, but there's
[2:43:02] one here has already touched you.
[2:43:05] [Music]
[2:43:07] And I've asked him and I'm asking him.
[2:43:11] We don't know exactly what's what's
[2:43:13] pulsating in your heart, but he feels
[2:43:15] every vibration.
[2:43:18] And I'm sure if the God's prophet was
[2:43:19] here and took you by the hand or spoke
[2:43:22] to you, he would say, "I feel a welcome
[2:43:23] spirit.
[2:43:26] You're welcoming this spirit. You're
[2:43:27] welcoming this messenger.
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; The messenger that was in the prophet.
[2:43:32] The messenger that was in the spoken
[2:43:34] word. The messenger that's in the wind.
[2:43:37] The messenger in in the word. Not just a
[2:43:39] Bible, but the messenger,
[2:43:42] my Lord Jesus,
[2:43:45] blessed Holy Spirit.
[2:43:47] These people that have stepped out of
[2:43:49] their seats have come forward and
[2:43:52] something beating in their heart,
[2:43:54] something beating in their heart. Touch
[2:43:57] them, oh God. Touch them with the divine
[2:44:00] touch. Touch them down into the soul
[2:44:03] realm. Oh God, further than the
[2:44:05] emotional realm, touch them in the soul
[2:44:07] realm, oh God. Oh transforming light,
[2:44:11] transform
[2:44:13] these lives, oh God, to be shining
[2:44:16] brilliant vessels. Transform them into
[2:44:20] torches of the message of the hour.
[2:44:23] Transform them, oh God, until their
[2:44:26] mouth will speak forth the glories of
[2:44:29] the Almighty Quad. Speak, my Lord.
[2:44:33] Speak, my Lord. Touch them, I pray.
[2:44:37] Touch them, oh God. Let the Holy Spirit
[2:44:40] fall. Fall like a cloud upon them and
[2:44:44] fill them with the Holy Spirit. Refill
[2:44:48] with the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus
[2:44:51] Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[2:44:54] resist every hindrance. I resist every
[2:44:56] hindrance. And say to the people, be
[2:44:59] loosed in Jesus Christ's name. Be loosed
[2:45:03] to express and make known your heart's
[2:45:06] desire. be loose to express your love to
[2:45:10] him. This holy one of Israel. This holy
[2:45:14] one of Israel. Oh, bless his holy name.
[2:45:18] Jesus, my Jesus, how we love you. How we
[2:45:21] love you. Oh, lovely messenger in the
[2:45:25] wind of God. Lovely messenger.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you Lord. Lord,
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; we thank you Lord.
[2:45:36] Oh God. Hallelujah.
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; You speak to him and he'll speak back to
[2:45:41] you.
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; You speak to him, he'll speak back to
[2:45:45] you.
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; If your brothers feel to pray for
[2:45:52] different ones, it's fine. If you feel
[2:45:54] to pray for different ones, that's fine.
[2:45:56] Wherever God lead you. If you feel to
[2:45:59] pray for anyone, it's fine. Okay.
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:07] Why don't you sing in faith? Take a step
[2:46:09] of faith.
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; Everyone here so thankful all you young
[2:46:14] men raise out to say, "Oh God, what
[2:46:17] brother Bis was speaking about today.
[2:46:19] Let me participate. Let me have let me
[2:46:21] possess that in Jesus Christ's name."
[2:46:24] Yes. Hallelujah. Why don't you lay hands
[2:46:28] on one another? Why don't you lay hands
[2:46:30] on one another?
[2:46:32] Why don't you pray for one another?
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; Fathers and men, deacons, and whatever
[2:46:37] more
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; while we lay hands on one another.
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; You sisters and pray for one another.
[2:46:45] Hallelujah.
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come near. Come near. Elijah
[2:46:50] said, "Come near, oh God. Come near to
[2:46:54] me. Touch me, oh God, with a living
[2:46:57] fire, with a living flame.
[2:47:00] Oh my god, my God.
[2:47:04] My God, my God, my God.
[2:47:07] How we have need of this. How we have
[2:47:09] need to make contact,
[2:47:11] contact with the holy, the holy one of
[2:47:14] Israel. Contact with the God of Abraham,
[2:47:17] God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.
[2:47:20] [Music]
[2:47:24] Now we need to see you, Lord. Now we
[2:47:26] need to see you. Thank you that we see
[2:47:30] you. We see you, oh lovely one. We hear
[2:47:34] your voice, oh Lord,
[2:47:39] &gt;&gt; we hear your voice.

[2:53:43] This is the evening time.
[2:53:45] [Music]
[2:54:04] evening time.
[2:54:08] It's later than we think.
[2:54:13] The bride is preparing
[2:54:17] for Lord.
[2:54:21] [Music]
[2:54:23] All things are already
[2:54:27] [Music]
[2:54:29] my
[2:54:35] [Music]
[2:54:39] time.
[2:54:41] Sing here to here.
[2:54:44] This is the
[2:54:46] time
[2:54:50] that we
[2:54:53] think the Christ is prepared
[2:54:58] for the Lord.
[2:55:04] All is already
[2:55:09] the bright
[2:55:14] he that
[2:55:16] [Music]
[2:55:17] the time is here. Just once more.
[2:55:24] This is the
[2:55:26] time.
[2:55:28] is greater than
[2:55:33] all the right is prepared now
[2:55:38] for the Lord to me
[2:55:43] and all things are
[2:55:48] the bride who I hear.
[2:55:53] Oh, he that hath the ear to hearing
[2:55:58] time is here.
[2:56:02] [Music]
[2:56:03] We do not know what the next hour
[2:56:06] holds or what the next afternoon or this
[2:56:09] afternoon holds.
[2:56:10] [Music]
[2:56:13] But I pray that God's presence.
[2:56:18] The very nearness of this one go with
[2:56:21] you and that you'll have the testimony
[2:56:23] even tonight coming to the service. It's
[2:56:26] different.
[2:56:29] And that's what I caught from you young
[2:56:31] men and the young ladies that were
[2:56:32] speaking at the at the Friday night
[2:56:35] meeting. And I was moved by some of the
[2:56:38] sisters that got up as well.
[2:56:41] But a common phrase that was is
[2:56:42] different. What happened to me is
[2:56:45] different. I've had a lot of things. I
[2:56:48] trust it'll be different with you.
[2:56:51] And let it be known to you. This was not
[2:56:53] a sermon.
[2:56:55] I announce to this congregation
[2:56:58] that the
[2:57:00] era
[2:57:02] within the message
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; is is changing
[2:57:07] and Satan knows that
[2:57:10] &gt;&gt; and he tries to inject human reasoning
[2:57:13] and human skills and human abilities to
[2:57:16] keep the structure going. And I want to
[2:57:19] announce the structure is not important.
[2:57:21] Amen.
[2:57:22] &gt;&gt; The structure is only a means to advance
[2:57:24] and further the messenger Jesus Christ
[2:57:29] &gt;&gt; him that's in the voice in the wind. God
[2:57:32] bless you with this mess. Father,
[2:57:37] I know the hearts have been really
[2:57:40] reached out and took a hold
[2:57:44] speaking in faith and you're responded.
[2:57:46] You've responded to it and you're
[2:57:48] answering and it will indeed be
[2:57:50] different for them. I pray that you'll
[2:57:53] just cause the level of revelation to
[2:57:56] intensify from one service to another.
[2:57:59] You you'll bless the ministers that
[2:58:01] minister to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:58:03] Anoint them mightily, I pray. Dismiss us
[2:58:06] now that we might come back refreshed
[2:58:08] this evening in Jesus Christ's name with
[2:58:12] blessings now. Amen. Amen. God bless
[2:58:17] you. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:58:19] We'll see you this evening.
