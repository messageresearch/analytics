[0:01] I'll turn to Ephesians uh the first
[0:05] chapter and then I've got one verse
[0:07] there and one verse in Ephesians the 4th
[0:11] chapter and just before we read we'll
[0:14] have prayer once
[0:16] again father we're bringing ourselves
[0:19] before you we want our lives to please
[0:22] you we want oh God the words that are
[0:25] uttered now let them be uttered by the
[0:27] Holy Spirit I believe we're not asking
[0:30] too much when we say holy ghost take
[0:34] control holy spirit have control of
[0:38] speaker and hearers alike and I ask oh
[0:41] God that you will just uh uh bypass this
[0:45] human bodies work through them but
[0:47] bypass oh God let there be no hindrance
[0:50] or any restriction whatsoever May there
[0:53] be a mighty mighty outflow of the Holy
[0:56] Spirit through the Living Word at this
[0:59] time time in Jesus name in Jesus name we
[1:03] give ourselves to you and yield
[1:05] ourselves completely amen amen all right
[1:10] in Ephesians
[1:12] now the first chapter and
[1:16] verse uh
[1:18] 13 and let's read it together in whom ye
[1:22] also trusted after that you heard the
[1:26] word of Truth The Gospel of your
[1:29] salvation
[1:30] in whom also after that you believed you
[1:34] were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[1:37] Promise after that you believed you were
[1:40] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise
[1:44] and then if you'll turn just over to the
[1:46] fourth
[1:57] chapter and the 30th verse
[2:00] and we'll read that together as well and
[2:03] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[2:06] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[2:10] redemption let's read that again and
[2:13] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[2:16] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[2:20] redemption amen you may be
[2:25] seated I want to speak and I'm going to
[2:28] give you the title right away
[2:33] because it takes this subject from a
[2:35] little different
[2:37] direction and I just will need your
[2:39] undivided attention and and you pray for
[2:42] yourself and pray for me but pray that
[2:45] we will be able to uh obtain the uh
[2:50] everything that God has here for us I
[2:53] want to speak on sufficiently
[2:56] impressed by the Holy Spirit
[3:00] sufficiently impressed by the Holy
[3:03] Spirit the prophet said that the Holy
[3:06] Spirit himself the holy spirit is a seal
[3:10] now I want to I want you to think in
[3:12] terms of the seal in two
[3:15] ways uh to be impressed to an impress or
[3:20] an
[3:21] imprint you know that is a seal also I I
[3:24] had some uh slides actually of various
[3:27] seals ancient seals some seal from
[3:30] Jerusalem some King's seals and uh they
[3:35] they could determine by the writing
[3:37] that's on the seal where the seal came
[3:40] from or whose it was and if a person was
[3:43] making a certain document or a certain
[3:46] sending letters and you'll find in in
[3:49] the Book of Esther uh the the king seal
[3:54] was used to seal the document by hmon to
[3:58] slay the uh the Jews and then that was
[4:02] reversed and even though it it says in
[4:05] the same in the same scriptures that it
[4:07] could not be reversed what had been
[4:09] sealed by the king but the king hadn't
[4:11] sealed it he had given his ring to hmon
[4:13] and hmon did it and uh and then when uh
[4:16] then the then the king gave Esther
[4:19] control of Hon's household and hmon was
[4:23] hung on his own Gallows and it was
[4:26] reversed the commission was reversed or
[4:29] the sentence of death on the Jews was
[4:31] reversed and it was sealed with the uh
[4:34] King's signate but I'm thinking now of
[4:38] the the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit
[4:41] we're sealed by the Holy Spirit I'm
[4:44] thinking in terms I would like your
[4:46] thoughts to go in this direction that
[4:48] the Holy Spirit impresses you
[4:54] sufficiently and that you yield
[4:57] sufficiently because it is a continual
[5:01] work in a person's life and as a person
[5:04] yields to the Holy Spirit it makes a
[5:07] further imprint or deeper imprint and
[5:11] the scripture tells us that we are
[5:13] sealed by the Holy Spirit uh and brother
[5:17] brandom says in one place and I'll I'll
[5:19] come to the quote a little later on
[5:22] where he says I wonder if we're
[5:25] sufficiently impressed and we need to be
[5:28] sufficiently impressed in order for the
[5:32] for our lives to be
[5:34] imprinted by that
[5:37] impression you understand it's an
[5:39] impression in uh in the printing
[5:42] business they use that they call it when
[5:44] uh papers going through the press that
[5:47] it's imprinted it's an impression that's
[5:49] made and the imprint the impression
[5:52] gives words on the paper or on the
[5:55] document and uh and and that's what the
[5:59] uh that's what an imprint in the in the
[6:02] in the the way that I want to have it
[6:05] described that we are impressed by the
[6:08] word or by the spirit of this age or
[6:12] sealed by the holy spirit so uh I I
[6:16] would like to go into not only the seal
[6:19] part but the impression part to impress
[6:23] or to form to fix by pressure and there
[6:27] this age is a pressure age and we are
[6:32] not to yield to that pressure there's
[6:36] pressure from every direction and we are
[6:39] not to allow Our Lives we're going to
[6:41] feel it but not allow Our Lives to be
[6:45] imprinted by that pressure and that's
[6:48] where I'll be coming from I'd like to
[6:49] speak a little further on that and then
[6:52] the seal the Seal of God or the seal
[6:55] that's put on a person and remember it's
[6:57] not only the Seal of God there's also
[7:00] the mark of theast
[7:04] Beast and we'll be touching on
[7:08] that now the Bible tells us I'm going to
[7:11] have you turn in your Bible
[7:14] also uh to uh the book of
[7:17] Acts and uh first we'll turn to the 24th
[7:27] chapter chapter 24 and verse uh
[7:35] 24 and this is Paul before fesus or uh
[7:41] Felix I think maybe it was yes
[7:45] Felix and after certain days when Felix
[7:49] came with his wife
[7:52] jusa uh which was a Jewish Jewish he
[7:56] sent for Paul and heard him concerning
[8:00] the faith in Christ and as he reasoned
[8:04] of righteousness Temperance and judgment
[8:07] to come Felix trembled and answered go
[8:11] thy way uh for the go thy way for this
[8:15] time when I have a convenient season I
[8:18] will call for thee and you can read the
[8:21] scripture that convenient season never
[8:23] came right but Felix was impressed amen
[8:29] with Apostle Paul but he wasn't
[8:32] sufficiently
[8:33] impressed he didn't move any further
[8:36] than that if you'll turn with me over to
[8:39] chapter 26 of uh the book of Acts and we
[8:45] find it's very very interesting I won't
[8:48] uh go any further into it than uh just
[8:51] to touch the highlights but if we start
[8:53] with verse one then a grippa said unto
[8:56] Paul Thou Art permitted to speak for
[8:59] thyself then Paul stretched forth the
[9:02] hand and answered for himself I think
[9:06] myself happy King AG grippa because I
[9:09] shall answer for myself this day before
[9:12] thee touching all the things whereof I
[9:16] am accused of the Jews and then he goes
[9:19] into his into his background into the
[9:23] kind of uh life that he lived as a Jew
[9:26] as a Pharisee and then he goes into his
[9:29] uh uh into his the meeting of the Lord
[9:33] the pillar of fire on the road to
[9:35] Damascus and then he'll he comes down to
[9:39] verse
[9:42] 26 I'll read verse 25 and he said I am
[9:46] not mad because fesus has said he was
[9:49] mad and he said I'm not mad most noble
[9:52] fesus but speak forth the words of truth
[9:55] and soberness I'd like you now just to
[9:57] think of Paul uh before these Great Men
[10:01] before these men of authority before
[10:04] these Kings uh before these Governors
[10:07] and whatever more and but you can see
[10:09] the urgency you can see his fervency you
[10:12] can see his Zeal he spoke with such
[10:16] conviction I've met him I I was uh I was
[10:20] so zealous I was a Pharisee of the
[10:22] Pharisees and uh and I I lived my life
[10:25] and I reproached the Christians and I
[10:28] cons sended to their death and sent some
[10:31] of them and caused them to blaspheme and
[10:34] I mean he was speaking with such
[10:35] conviction and so then when he comes and
[10:38] and speaks and he says in verse 26 for
[10:41] the king knoweth now that's King Agrippa
[10:43] for the king knoweth these things before
[10:46] whom also I speak freely for I am
[10:49] persuaded that none of these things are
[10:51] hidden from him for this King was not
[10:55] for this thing was not done in a corner
[10:58] king of gri
[11:00] believest thou the prophets AG grippa
[11:03] didn't even get a chance to answer I
[11:04] know that thou believest and then a
[11:07] grippa said unto Paul almost thou
[11:10] persuadest me to be a Christian and Paul
[11:14] said I would to God that not only thou
[11:17] but also all that hear me this day were
[11:21] both almost and all together such as I
[11:24] am except for these bonds amen he he
[11:28] impressed those people they were mly
[11:31] impressed and you can see the king
[11:34] himself saying Paul
[11:37] almost almost thou persuadest me to be a
[11:41] Christian he came so close he was so
[11:44] impressed but he wasn't sufficiently
[11:47] impressed I will tell you the Christian
[11:49] businessman uh throughout this land that
[11:52] had had brother brandham there to the
[11:54] meetings and he preached for them and
[11:57] they saw the sign you ought to you ought
[11:59] to read this book or even hear it on
[12:01] tape birth pains because you can see the
[12:04] message is in birth pains right then and
[12:07] those people are so silent because he's
[12:09] talking about Esau and he's talking
[12:12] about Cain and he's talking about those
[12:14] that never went far enough and that and
[12:17] that the world is in a birth pain again
[12:20] I don't want to go there too much this
[12:22] morning because that's where I will be
[12:24] going and and and I can say that the
[12:26] message is in a birth pain
[12:30] amen the message is in a birth pain and
[12:34] the prophet of God was in a was bringing
[12:36] a message that was in a birth pain
[12:38] because if it's in a birth pain it's
[12:40] bringing forth A New Life a new life and
[12:44] and the birth pain that we're into right
[12:46] now and you can be pondering this
[12:48] because this is where I'm going to be
[12:49] coming to the world is in a birth pain
[12:52] it's in travail but travail will bring a
[12:56] new world behold I make a new Heaven and
[12:59] a new Earth and we're rejoicing because
[13:02] that's where our vision is hallelujah I
[13:05] make a new Heaven and a new Earth and
[13:08] I'm impressed with the word that's
[13:10] bringing that new Heaven and new earth
[13:12] I'm impressed with the message Allelujah
[13:17] amen then when the prophet gets to the
[13:20] end of this message he just says well
[13:23] now he just takes it and you can feel
[13:26] the air is so tense and there's so much
[13:28] resistance there but he just has a
[13:31] prayer you can feel a atmosphere just
[13:34] changing then he just starts he calls
[13:36] people out one after the other by their
[13:38] name well the people they were so they
[13:42] were so impressed with that so impressed
[13:45] with what they saw but not sufficiently
[13:48] impressed to receive what was being
[13:54] spoken
[13:57] now a seal
[14:00] is an impression used to seal as I said
[14:03] earlier a letter or documents or to seal
[14:05] a
[14:06] life as long as the seal is in place the
[14:09] contents will remain a mystery unless
[14:12] the seal is broken the contents will
[14:15] remain a mystery and as
[14:18] humans as humans we are very very
[14:22] subject and prone to be
[14:25] impressed and I can tell you that we are
[14:28] impressed with
[14:29] all kinds of
[14:32] things it is said and I can't prove this
[14:35] but this is what I understand from my
[14:38] research that we retain
[14:42] 10% of what we
[14:45] read
[14:46] 20% of what we
[14:49] hear 30% of what we
[14:53] see and 50% of what we hear and
[14:57] see say 70% of what we
[15:01] say and 90% of what we say and
[15:07] do I understand that that is why this
[15:12] age and that is why we say soon as we
[15:15] say Hollywood we think of
[15:18] movies that was a master Stroke Of
[15:21] Satan to take written things and written
[15:24] books and put them into visual form as a
[15:29] a master Stroke Of Satan and it was a
[15:32] further Master stroke to bring that into
[15:34] the front room of houses and it's a
[15:38] further Master stroke you can see how he
[15:41] is using and devising his kingdom around
[15:45] the
[15:46] visual and putting it on your hip in the
[15:49] way of or in your pocket or in your
[15:51] purse in the way of a a an i iPhone or
[15:56] whatever more and people have such
[15:59] visual such access to the visual I
[16:02] understand that we only uh only catch a
[16:06] fraction of what we hear as far as
[16:09] retaining it but what we see we're very
[16:12] impressed with but I was reading and and
[16:15] and pondering this because God uh he
[16:19] moved away Jesus was physical and they
[16:23] saw God In the Flesh but it did not
[16:27] convert them right and it even took the
[16:31] disciples they had to keep watching it
[16:34] watching it and watching it but it was
[16:36] more than watching him they had to hear
[16:39] him and it was the hearing that actually
[16:42] brought the vision to
[16:46] them and as I was studying I I was
[16:48] reading of of of some uh Jewish scholar
[16:53] speaking of the the the Mount Si and I'm
[16:58] going to be I want you to think about
[17:00] that now because when Moses came to the
[17:03] burning bush the Bible says he saw the
[17:06] bush and it was burning but didn't
[17:09] wasn't consumed and he was attracted and
[17:12] said I will turn now and see this great
[17:18] sight and it is said that we as humans
[17:23] we are uh we are attracted to that which
[17:27] we physically see but that is only at
[17:31] the natural
[17:34] level because we are physical beings and
[17:37] like brother Bram said you've never seen
[17:39] me and I've never seen you the real you
[17:43] the real me that goes beyond this
[17:47] physical body of Flesh when we see
[17:50] something we see something acted out or
[17:53] you would see something on a screen
[17:55] that's not reality
[18:00] and it is said that what you hear is
[18:03] more powerful even than what you see
[18:06] because what you see is is it it is
[18:11] restricted to uh uh what you what you
[18:15] see is restricted to I'm thinking
[18:18] something else that's why I'm stumbling
[18:19] around a wee bit but it's restricted to
[18:21] the visual aspect you can if you see
[18:24] something as a witness you have to see
[18:27] something or have to hear something as a
[18:30] witness you see a certain accident you
[18:33] and and you see certain things happen
[18:36] but they say it's it's it's remarkable
[18:39] that uh in a courtroom a judge is he he
[18:43] doesn't go by what he sees he doesn't
[18:46] see what actually H took place and a and
[18:49] he only hears he hears testimony because
[18:54] the hearing has a greater capacity
[18:58] because you're not limited to just what
[19:00] you saw right you're going to have to
[19:02] think about this for a moment when when
[19:04] Moses came before the bush he said I
[19:07] will turn aside now and see this great
[19:10] sight but it was not the seeing of the
[19:13] pillar of fire that transformed him it
[19:17] was The Voice Hallelujah and the voice
[19:21] he couldn't Define The Voice There Was
[19:23] No Object there wasn't any particular
[19:26] shape but he heard a voice I am the god
[19:30] of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god
[19:33] of Jacob and that changed
[19:37] him and I have
[19:39] seen I've seen the the the the the
[19:43] burden I've heard with my ears I've
[19:45] heard and I'm sending you down to
[19:48] deliver these people so it was it was
[19:51] what the person heard which was greater
[19:54] look at the first pull and the second
[19:56] pull of the prophet's Ministry what what
[19:58] an astounding Ministry 33 years and the
[20:02] people saw it but it didn't change
[20:05] them then the third pole was not Vision
[20:09] the third pole was not visual it was
[20:12] voice in the days of the voice can you
[20:16] say Amen in the days of what you hear
[20:19] because what you hear doesn't have the
[20:21] limitation of the visual part and so
[20:25] people maybe saw lights and saw all
[20:27] kinds of uh pH PHA and whatever more how
[20:30] many people saw the
[20:33] cloud perhaps multitude saw the cloud
[20:36] maybe Millions saw the picture of the CL
[20:38] mystery Cloud over Arizona it didn't
[20:41] mean anything to them and even the
[20:43] prophet said they don't know what it's
[20:44] all about but a voice came out of that
[20:48] for us hallelujah and the voice is life
[20:53] changing the voice can take the false
[20:57] doctrine that you've been raised up in
[20:59] and all of these false things and simply
[21:02] he caused that to vanish in a moment of
[21:05] time there's such power in that voice
[21:08] and those you that were ins snared and
[21:10] trapped in all kinds of religion even
[21:12] from childhood I know it myself and I
[21:15] heard that I had such questions about
[21:17] the baptism about the godhead and I only
[21:20] had to hear some words I had to hear
[21:22] some words I didn't need to see any
[21:26] phenomena I didn't need to see a cloud I
[21:29] didn't need to go to any special place I
[21:32] just needed to hear the word and the
[21:34] word is with power Hallelujah and the
[21:37] Holy Spirit is behind the word and it
[21:40] impressed
[21:41] me and left its imprint on me and once
[21:46] you're once you're stamped with that
[21:49] stamp uh you're marked forever
[21:52] Hallelujah and we can sing the song I am
[21:54] marked marked marked I'm marked now
[21:57] Wherever I Go
[22:00] yes
[22:01] sir
[22:04] Hallelujah as humans we're impressed
[22:06] with things and I'm just going to run
[22:08] over a few things we'll come back to the
[22:11] message side but we're impressed with
[22:17] success someone has said can you measure
[22:20] success with in
[22:21] wealth there are many unhappy rich
[22:24] people in the
[22:25] world what about Fame the tab IDs are
[22:29] full of the sorted details and you can't
[22:32] go buy a a grocery store and pay your
[22:35] bill without seeing all the tabloids
[22:38] that are there and they're
[22:40] wretches they are lives that are
[22:43] wrecked and they've they're called
[22:46] celebrities they're not celebrities
[22:48] they're fallen
[22:50] stars and if they were your neighbor you
[22:53] probably wouldn't want to live near them
[22:55] for the debauchery that they live in and
[22:58] here they have it out there like this is
[23:00] something and you ought to buy this I
[23:02] tell you what it's
[23:05] sickening and they're taken up with the
[23:07] material the material realm their Fame
[23:11] is all associated with
[23:14] things and
[23:17] falsehood and glamorous life often pulls
[23:22] people into degradation and
[23:25] despair Hebrews the 11th chapter
[23:29] tells us of famous people in my book
[23:33] celebrities in God's book there are
[23:35] celebrities they're called Heroes of
[23:38] Faith they're celebrities and here's why
[23:41] they're celebrities by Faith H Allelujah
[23:45] Faith sees the invisible Faith looks
[23:48] into another realm you got that
[23:51] faith not just Moses and Abraham and
[23:54] Sarah you have that faith it looks into
[23:57] another Realm
[23:58] and because of the things that you hear
[24:01] the message of the hour you see things
[24:03] that others don't
[24:05] see and by faith Moses when he came uh
[24:09] when he was come to years he refused to
[24:12] be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[24:15] he refused to be be a celebrity by this
[24:19] world he refused even success and power
[24:24] that he could have had but choosing
[24:26] rather to suffer Affliction with the
[24:29] people of God than to enjoy the
[24:32] pleasures of sin for a season esteeming
[24:35] the reproach of Christ greater riches
[24:38] than the treasures of Egypt greater
[24:41] riches Egypt had all the gold and and
[24:44] own the land and own the people owned
[24:48] everything we don't have the Democracy
[24:51] doesn't have the kind of life that they
[24:53] lived and the kind of the way the people
[24:55] were controlled and even over there now
[24:57] in some of the Middle East countries
[24:59] it's princes and and these people they
[25:02] own cities right they own
[25:07] towns friend of
[25:09] mine a Jewish man living in Los Angeles
[25:12] which I've talked to you about him but
[25:16] he's a very very dear
[25:18] friend to the uh Prince of
[25:23] Morocco and a few years ago I was with
[25:26] him and he had just returned from there
[25:28] in the prince of Morocco and this way
[25:30] they do business he was going to give
[25:31] him the cell phone industry for the
[25:34] whole nation if he would get a
[25:37] corporation in the United States to come
[25:38] and build two cities he wanted two
[25:40] cities and there were 25,000 that would
[25:43] accommodate 25,000 people per City they
[25:47] were his cities like in the Old
[25:50] Testament the king had the cities and
[25:52] the people would live there and pay uh
[25:56] pay their rent or whatever to the to the
[25:59] king and into the treasury for their
[26:01] living place we don't have that kind of
[26:04] mentality here but that's that's what
[26:06] they did and and in in Moses time Moses
[26:10] wasn't only had all of this position and
[26:13] perhaps the next Pharaoh those were all
[26:16] things which were visible the wealth was
[26:18] visible all of the Power and his
[26:21] position and his celebrity position but
[26:24] he turned that aside for the reproach of
[26:28] Christ and he considered that the
[26:30] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[26:33] the treasures of Egypt the treasures of
[26:35] Egypt were physically uh visual could
[26:39] see could be seen But the treasures of
[26:42] Christ could not be seen I say to you
[26:45] here we are in this materialistic
[26:47] generation let's not get
[26:50] hooked let's not get hooked on what you
[26:53] see because it surely is passing away it
[26:57] will pass away away right and it many
[27:00] much of it has passed away many people
[27:03] had their rsps and their 401ks in the
[27:06] states and it vanished in a little
[27:09] simple meltdown overnight it vanished
[27:12] much of it vanished and people today
[27:14] well you can get I get an old age
[27:16] pension they take it all back for me
[27:18] because I'm still preaching but there it
[27:20] isn't enough to buy it isn't enough to
[27:22] buy your food and fuel for your
[27:26] car you know the Canadian government we
[27:29] give you an old age pension thank you
[27:32] very
[27:33] much you live in this area what would
[27:36] what would you get for $1,000 a month or
[27:39] $900 and something dollar $900 and
[27:42] something dollars in this Society in
[27:44] this day what would you do with
[27:47] $900 you can't even rent a basement
[27:49] sweetheart for
[27:51] that and you're supposed to live you're
[27:53] supposed to eat you're supposed to drive
[27:54] a car you're supposed to and you work
[27:56] all your life and pay into it this
[27:59] world it's
[28:01] gone Hallelujah and the faster it goes
[28:04] wherever it's going and it needs to be
[28:08] renovated by a holy
[28:10] fire glory to God did you ever think
[28:13] what's out in space right now going
[28:16] through this room is is
[28:18] images and they might be over in some
[28:20] other country if we had a television
[28:22] here you pick them up that's what the
[28:24] prophet said he had a television you'd
[28:26] pick it up you bring a radio you pick up
[28:28] all the voices all the rest of it and he
[28:30] said in the in the future home that he
[28:33] said there's going to be a that Peter
[28:35] speaks of a fire he said it won't just
[28:37] be a literal fire it'll be a holy fire
[28:40] because it's going to purge the heavens
[28:43] and I can tell you that all those voices
[28:45] will be gone but the voices of the
[28:48] Saints which have the word of God will
[28:51] never leave that space they're there
[28:54] eternally brother Bam's voice is there
[28:56] eternally every Declaration of every
[29:00] Born Again believer that spoke in the
[29:02] name of the Lord even my voice today
[29:05] will never be cleansed out of that by
[29:08] that fire it'll remain there because the
[29:11] scripture says heavens and earth will
[29:12] pass away but my word will never pass
[29:19] away but we get
[29:22] impressed with success and I find it I
[29:26] find it even amongst believers
[29:29] oh they were so
[29:34] successful should I stop or should I
[29:37] carry
[29:40] on and intelligent people people got got
[29:44] you know they can put things together
[29:45] and they've got such retention of mind
[29:48] and all these things listen if you've
[29:50] been given intelligence praise the Lord
[29:53] use it for God's glory if you've been
[29:55] given wealth use it for God's glory if
[29:58] you've been given success use it for
[30:00] God's glory but that don't strive for
[30:10] it in the pool of Bethesda the message
[30:13] pool of
[30:15] Bethesda brother Brandon says the more
[30:17] humbler you get and the less you know
[30:21] about the things of the world the better
[30:23] off you are in the sight of God
[30:28] I didn't get very many amens about that
[30:31] because maybe the world got too much of
[30:32] our mind already says the humbler you
[30:37] get and the less you know about the
[30:39] things of the world the better off you
[30:42] are in the sight of God he said the
[30:45] greatest success I ever had was amongst
[30:48] people who hardly could read or write
[30:52] but now I'm not have I'm not trying to
[30:55] support my ignorance or prejudice es
[30:59] we're not trying to support that we're
[31:01] not supporting ignorance and he says it
[31:03] many many times but he says but I'll say
[31:06] the biggest hindrance to the Gospel of
[31:09] Jesus Christ has ever ever had has been
[31:13] this modern day
[31:16] education not that education is of the
[31:19] of the devil but it sure takes a lot of
[31:21] people
[31:22] there and I'm not going to soften it up
[31:25] I'm going to say what he said amen he
[31:27] said said that's exactly right even in
[31:30] the ministry they've explained
[31:32] everything out of the Bible the blood
[31:34] the days of Miracles the powers it's all
[31:37] explained out how's explained out by you
[31:40] know cultivated cultured Minds we don't
[31:43] want that we want to have those things
[31:46] in our possession it belongs to us it's
[31:49] part of our
[31:51] inheritance in a power of transformation
[31:54] he said now I'm not trying to support
[31:56] ignorance but did you know that
[31:59] Civilization notice what he says
[32:01] civilization Science Education and the
[32:05] things that we cherish so great today is
[32:09] the very instrument of Satan that's
[32:13] right he said even civilization he said
[32:16] civilization never come by God
[32:19] civilization came by Satan and I'll
[32:23] prove that to you by the word in just a
[32:25] minute civilization is not a God can we
[32:29] say amen he said for let me show you in
[32:32] this civilization the more civilized we
[32:35] get as we work through science we are
[32:39] always killing ourselves and he says
[32:42] this civilization has built up to this
[32:45] Pinnacle now and we've got death in this
[32:48] civilization we've got sin in this
[32:50] civilization we've got sickness in this
[32:53] civilization and that can't be of God
[32:56] and I say Amen
[32:58] amen God's got it sorted out God's got
[33:01] it fixed out the higher we get in
[33:03] Civilization The More Death that's
[33:05] associated with it and he said that
[33:07] Civilization will have none of these
[33:12] things I just touch it now that's why
[33:17] we're in a
[33:18] travail that's what causes the travail
[33:22] that's upon the believer we're in a
[33:25] travail and Jesus spoke of it but he
[33:28] says but you will have joy there will be
[33:31] a travail but you'll have joy I'm just
[33:34] going to leave it
[33:38] there in the in uh we're impressed with
[33:43] beauty we like nice
[33:48] things and God of this evil age he said
[33:51] the sons of God saw the daughters of men
[33:54] not Daughters of God Daughters of men
[33:58] the daughters of men that they were
[34:00] beautiful and it caused the sons of God
[34:03] to fall into this delusion and took them
[34:06] kind of women and married them and it
[34:09] brought an age of prostitution just like
[34:12] it is today like it was in Sodom like
[34:15] it's predicted to be uh predicted to be
[34:18] today that when men and women of this
[34:21] day swap wives and they don't like this
[34:24] wife and they go over to Reno Nevada and
[34:27] get married and divorce and that one and
[34:30] marry again in 15 minutes and women so
[34:34] pretty that they're almost irresistible
[34:37] and what is it the devil see Satan still
[34:40] in Beauty now that doesn't mean we're
[34:43] all put out of a machine like so many
[34:45] sausages or whatever everybody has their
[34:48] own appearance and whatever more but the
[34:52] the fashion of the world is is designed
[34:56] to take whatever attri God gives a
[34:59] person man women both especially women
[35:02] and to and to beautify them beyond what
[35:06] they actually are and that's what men
[35:09] fall for and they fall for something and
[35:11] they the hair now forgive me but when
[35:15] they marry them or whatever they find
[35:18] that's not what they
[35:23] married you folks live in the same world
[35:25] I live in right
[35:28] and they find out it's completely
[35:30] different they find out the person is
[35:32] different the color of their hair is
[35:34] different and their face isn't that
[35:37] color anymore and get all the Max Factor
[35:40] washed off and that's not how they look
[35:43] and no wonder you know and maybe the man
[35:46] himself I don't know I I better get off
[35:48] this subject pretty soon but anyway the
[35:51] Bible says that in James in in the Book
[35:54] of James it says for if there come unto
[35:57] you and your assembly a man with a gold
[36:00] ring in goodly apparel and there come in
[36:03] also a poor man in Vile reignment and
[36:07] you have respect to him that wearth the
[36:09] gay clothing and say unto him sit thou
[36:12] here in a good place and say to the poor
[36:15] stand thou there or sit here under my
[36:18] foot stol are you not then partial in
[36:21] yourselves and are become judges of evil
[36:24] thoughts hearken un hearken my beloved
[36:27] bre
[36:28] hath not God chosen is asking a question
[36:32] has not God chosen the poor of this
[36:35] world rich in
[36:38] faith Hallelujah the poor of this world
[36:43] rich in faith and hes of the Kingdom
[36:47] which God hath promised them that loved
[36:49] him God is impressed with poor
[36:53] [Applause]
[36:54] people God's impressed with people
[36:58] that are poor not just poor but rich in
[37:08] faith but you have despised the poor do
[37:11] not rich men oppress you and draw you
[37:14] before the Judgment seats do not they
[37:17] blaspheme and and that worthy Name by
[37:20] which you are
[37:22] called so we are not to be
[37:25] impressed listen as a pastor
[37:28] as a minister of the Gospel you know you
[37:31] you have people I I'll never forget some
[37:34] years
[37:35] ago and it's very fresh on my
[37:38] mind there was
[37:41] a we had a convention Brother Don osbor
[37:44] arranged a convention in Phoenix at the
[37:46] convention
[37:48] center and uh there
[37:50] was uh 11 12 1300 people coming to the
[37:54] meetings I was a stranger to most of the
[37:57] people I knew some of the
[38:00] ministers but there was
[38:02] a uh and we had a radio broadcast down
[38:06] there and so I was interviewed at the at
[38:10] the radio
[38:12] station and the woman it was a
[38:15] manageress over the station and she said
[38:18] I have been asked to ask you some
[38:21] questions from a woman
[38:24] Minister and she said do you mind and I
[38:26] said well no I better go and get my
[38:28] Bible then if I'm going to have to
[38:30] answer the questions and I knew for sure
[38:32] it be onto the serpent seed or on you
[38:34] know something like that so I went and
[38:37] got my
[38:38] Bible and that
[38:41] woman I found out that her
[38:43] son was a Believer and went to the
[38:47] church in Flagstaff
[38:49] Arizona and so she she was well-versed
[38:53] in uh in the message teachings and so on
[38:57] on and so then she came to the meeting
[39:01] and brought a friend of hers and this
[39:03] friend of hers they said we'd like to
[39:06] see you after the service so I said fine
[39:09] and we just went into a little Al Cove
[39:12] there while the people were it was just
[39:14] immediately after the service
[39:18] and
[39:20] uh this woman The Other Woman very
[39:23] nicely
[39:25] dressed I was impressed
[39:29] she had on a suede powder blue
[39:32] suit you know just light sueded the
[39:36] whole
[39:37] suit and she was I could see that suit
[39:41] cost a lot of money I can see right away
[39:44] she wasn't poor and so they wanted to
[39:47] talk and they had been in brother
[39:49] brenham's meetings both of them over at
[39:52] the other Church in Phoenix uh church or
[39:55] maybe some of you from down there would
[39:56] remember
[39:58] uh brother Outlaw wasn't that his church
[40:01] brother Randy right and they both went
[40:03] to Brother Outlaw's church and uh they
[40:06] had been firm Oneness Believers and then
[40:10] things got you know kind of got went
[40:12] sideways and so on so
[40:14] forth and so she then begin to her
[40:18] turned out that her husband was the
[40:22] manager of General Motors for three
[40:25] entire countries over in the Middle East
[40:28] someplace or something and he had passed
[40:31] away and left her very very
[40:34] wealthy and so she was concerned about
[40:37] some of this and as she was speaking I
[40:41] guess the Lord you know just gave me
[40:43] some insight I said well what she had
[40:47] these stalks you know and she she had
[40:50] three own three television
[40:53] stations and and right away soon as she
[40:56] said your three television stations I
[40:59] said what's bothering you is the
[41:02] booze the booze
[41:06] advertisements well she says if I had
[41:08] the money in the she just completely
[41:10] caved in said if I had the money in the
[41:12] bank how do I know where the bank's
[41:13] putting the money I said yeah but you
[41:15] happen to know and and those
[41:18] advertisements you're you're M making
[41:21] profit of those advertisements and
[41:23] you're putting forward alcohol and booze
[41:26] on radio on your television stations and
[41:30] that was exactly
[41:31] it she was very very very nice about it
[41:34] and all the rest of it but did did that
[41:36] mean anything to me the fact that she's
[41:39] in a beautiful suit or the fact that
[41:42] you're dressed the way you are hey we're
[41:44] worth probably with inflation about 60
[41:49] CS we want to remember that we're not
[41:52] worth a whole
[41:54] lot it's your soul
[41:57] that's worth everything and I can tell
[42:00] you I never I just it it didn't have any
[42:03] effect on me whatsoever fact that she
[42:05] had all this wealth or anything I didn't
[42:07] count out to it a bit didn't have any
[42:09] interest in it I've never had any
[42:11] interest in it they are what they are
[42:14] and and uh the thing that would have
[42:16] meant something to me is if she would
[42:17] have said I heard I heard in the service
[42:21] tonight I heard something and and by
[42:24] hearing it have her life imprinted
[42:27] [Applause]
[42:29] am but you can see having all of that
[42:33] wealth left to her put her in an
[42:36] impossible
[42:42] situation impossible for the natural
[42:44] person I hope this is making some sense
[42:46] to
[42:48] you we're impressed with skills and with
[42:52] abilities we're impressed with I'm
[42:55] impressed with self sacrifice if I find
[42:59] people and Men even they may not be
[43:03] people of the message but they've been
[43:05] somehow they've laid their lives down
[43:07] and uh in a self-sacrifice and they've
[43:09] turned their back on what they could
[43:12] have been or could have done I'm I'm I'm
[43:15] impressed with humility and I'm
[43:18] impressed with Simplicity the Bible says
[43:22] in the scripture that holy men of God
[43:24] spake as they were moved moved they were
[43:29] impressed and they were moved for the
[43:32] prophecy came not of Old Time by the
[43:35] will of man but holy men of God spake as
[43:39] they were moved by the Holy Ghost and
[43:42] these holy men of God for the most part
[43:45] many of them were slain by their peers
[43:48] right right they were considered
[43:50] failures in their generation
[43:54] right true
[43:57] brother Bren tells an account of
[44:02] U I think there was uh some young
[44:06] boys says he was reading an
[44:09] article and there was a home and there
[44:11] was five boys born in this home some of
[44:15] you know where I'm going but don't draw
[44:17] a conclusion to it five boys were born
[44:21] in this home and as soon as the oldest
[44:24] got old
[44:25] enough he went to the Navy off to the
[44:28] Navy he
[44:29] went the second one followed and the
[44:32] next one until all five all five went to
[44:36] the
[44:37] Navy and there was no Marines or navy
[44:40] men in their family and the mother and
[44:43] father couldn't understand just why
[44:45] these boys everyone wanted to go to the
[44:51] Navy there was a real fine investigation
[44:54] made of this in other words a really
[44:56] query
[44:58] why this happened and I came to find out
[45:00] in the
[45:01] bedroom where these boys all were
[45:04] brought up in this bedroom there was a
[45:07] beautiful big picture
[45:09] hanging hanging there of a big ship
[45:13] sailing on quiet calm
[45:17] sea and it so impressed those
[45:21] boys that they went to bed at night
[45:25] looking at this picture
[45:28] it was on their mind to sail that quiet
[45:32] soothing
[45:33] sea and along the morning when they
[45:36] arose the first thing that they could
[45:38] look at was that ship making her way
[45:41] through the quiet calm sea and it
[45:45] impressed the boys so it impressed them
[45:49] so right that each one became a sailor
[45:54] now he said if a picture will impress
[45:57] boys to become Navy men Sailors of the
[46:00] sea what ought the picture of the Lord
[46:03] Jesus Christ
[46:09] do now listen friends we've got to
[46:12] really you know be down to Brass tax
[46:15] with this all through the Old Testament
[46:18] they heard the word of God and holy man
[46:20] of God removed and Prophets spake in the
[46:22] name of the Lord and they killed them
[46:25] and and all through their all they had
[46:27] was word word word and then the word
[46:30] became flesh the word didn't impress
[46:33] them sufficiently and the flesh didn't
[46:35] impress them sufficiently because it was
[46:37] it was confined to the person they saw
[46:40] and there was no Beauty in him that we
[46:43] should be attracted to him there was
[46:45] nothing he he didn't have the perhaps
[46:48] the size and and the physique and the
[46:51] demeanor that impressed anybody we see
[46:54] somebody in their their weal built and
[46:58] they just look you know the picture of
[47:00] health and the picture of beauty we
[47:02] become impressed and we shouldn't get
[47:04] impressed we shouldn't allow ourselves
[47:07] to be impressed by that I'm I'm sounding
[47:10] Out a warning in the message today we
[47:14] don't want to be impressed in fact is I
[47:16] can tell you I I strive the other way
[47:20] around I I don't tell a lot of people
[47:23] about you know even what God has done in
[47:25] the Supernatural and what is happening
[47:27] in the message because I don't want the
[47:30] success to impress them amen because
[47:34] that's what that's not what's supposed
[47:36] to draw a
[47:39] person sir I see people come in here
[47:43] sometimes I've had lots of unbelievers
[47:44] come in here and they looking here and
[47:46] they walk in the doors and say
[47:49] oh and I just I just get done with that
[47:52] as quick as possible I'm not interested
[47:55] in people getting impressed
[47:58] a man came into the log church one day
[48:01] and he came into the little uh in the
[48:04] little room where we were doing the
[48:06] cleaning up of the tapes and all the
[48:08] tapes were in along the walls all in
[48:12] their numbers and everything and he
[48:14] walked in like
[48:17] this and he just stopped like he came
[48:20] into the presence of something and he
[48:22] looked
[48:24] around he said to me sir
[48:27] I don't know what's on these
[48:29] tapes but whatever it is means a great
[48:32] deal to you
[48:35] people it's a real treasure to you and I
[48:38] said it is he was he was impressed so
[48:43] impressed with the way that we were
[48:45] treating the word of
[48:48] God prophet of God said to the people
[48:51] and I I and and I'm saying I'm preaching
[48:54] to myself are we sufficient ly
[48:57] impressed five young men were
[49:00] sufficiently
[49:01] impressed and they were so
[49:03] impressed with the image of the ship
[49:07] that had actually transformed their
[49:09] lives into
[49:11] Sailors they became in other words the
[49:14] vision became a natural
[49:17] event they became Sailors surely the
[49:22] Christ that we see by the voice that we
[49:25] hear the message that we've received we
[49:28] can say so many times in the days of the
[49:30] voice the we can Rejoice about that but
[49:33] in the days of the voice what we should
[49:35] be able to say is what I heard
[49:38] transformed me into the image of Jesus
[49:41] [Applause]
[49:43] Christ and that's what the message is is
[49:46] to for that's what it's to do it's to
[49:49] transform us into something else
[49:53] right I see
[49:58] and I see brother Josh God bless you
[50:01] brother Josh we had a nice time the
[50:03] other evening and then you were texting
[50:06] me in the morning and said what do I do
[50:08] now I don't hardly think there's
[50:11] anything to say that's why I didn't text
[50:13] you right back because it sounds to me
[50:16] like God did it all
[50:18] already he was wondering what to do it
[50:21] is just amazing brother Josh sitting
[50:23] right here we had about an hour or or
[50:26] better the other night from about 10:30
[50:28] to about
[50:30] 11:30 and uh and I just said some words
[50:34] to him about the direction of his life
[50:36] and he's been studying in college
[50:39] University or college for five years and
[50:42] it would be another few years but he has
[50:44] such a desire to do something for God
[50:47] and uh and he'd like to be here I hope
[50:50] you don't mind me saying this brother
[50:51] Josh he would like to be here he said I
[50:53] feel so much apart he said the people
[50:55] were so welcoming and had such a
[50:59] wonderful time spiritual time out at the
[51:02] out at the camp and and has been with
[51:04] the other in homes and families etc etc
[51:08] and I said well you have a hunger for
[51:09] God he said I do that is my main hunger
[51:13] I want to be able to do something for
[51:15] God I want to be able to do something
[51:17] that's good that's real good but we
[51:20] mustn't let you know whether it be
[51:22] college or education or work or business
[51:24] or money or success or popularity or
[51:27] fame put a cramp on that so I just
[51:31] concluded with brother Josh and that it
[51:33] fits my message I'm not I'm not saying
[51:35] it because it spoke with him I said that
[51:39] that that your education must be your
[51:42] servant your job must be your servant
[51:46] your business must be your servant and
[51:48] you only have it to further your main
[51:51] purpose on life and your main purpose on
[51:53] life is be
[51:55] transformed by the power of
[51:58] God I tell you what friend success has
[52:00] taken a lot of people away from God and
[52:04] downhill we don't want that kind of
[52:07] success I mean if we have enough to eat
[52:09] and we have a place to sleep we want to
[52:11] be happy about that but what we want to
[52:14] do is say what I'm impressed with is
[52:16] what I've heard and that that hasn't
[52:19] given you any specific image it keeps
[52:21] changing as time goes on and you find
[52:24] that this message this Christ
[52:27] he's
[52:28] adequate for any situation today
[52:33] tomorrow for success for the best
[52:35] economy for the worst economy for any
[52:38] meltdown he's he he's he's more than
[52:42] that he's greater than those things are
[52:45] you willing to say Amen to that he's
[52:48] greater than your
[52:49] education Hallelujah put God first I'll
[52:53] never never apologize for saying put God
[52:56] first
[52:58] am put it ahead of successor put it
[53:01] ahead of your beauty or put ahead of
[53:03] your
[53:17] youth in the message Spirit of Truth he
[53:21] said I've always made this statement I
[53:23] was glad got a hold of me I was glad
[53:26] that God got a hold of me before the
[53:27] church
[53:28] did hard to tell what I'd have been but
[53:32] I was thankful to the leadership and the
[53:35] direct contact that the Holy Spirit
[53:38] impressed my life with before I even
[53:41] surrendered it the Holy Spirit kept the
[53:44] order of things the Holy Spirit
[53:46] impresses a
[53:48] person and he was impressed even before
[53:51] he surrendered it in other words the
[53:53] surrendering came as a result of him
[53:55] being impressed
[54:00] and God gave a
[54:02] world a
[54:05] prophet and he lived a prophet's life
[54:08] and I'll say something further he lived
[54:10] a holy prophet's life and he had
[54:13] thousands and tens of thousands of
[54:15] enemies that would have loved to put a
[54:17] finger on him but the more they examined
[54:20] him the clearer and the purer his life
[54:22] was and they couldn't find anything
[54:26] right be it popularity be it money be it
[54:29] women be whatever could not find a thing
[54:32] with his life thank God for a holy
[54:36] prophet to speak a holy message we have
[54:39] confidence in that message but I will
[54:42] say this he said I'm glad that God got a
[54:45] hold of me before the world did before
[54:47] the church did before religion did why
[54:50] because religion stamps an image on a
[54:53] person it gives them their thought and
[54:56] their
[55:02] ideas is this all
[55:07] right in the message that called out he
[55:10] was relating about
[55:13] India and he said in India instead of
[55:15] having fences they have
[55:19] walls and their barns Are Made of Stone
[55:22] many of
[55:24] them and where the cattle would stand
[55:26] around in the shade of the wall all the
[55:29] cattle and the Sheep took off to the
[55:31] middle of the field and the little birds
[55:34] that had their nest in the coves of the
[55:37] barns flew away out into the forest
[55:42] before the earthquake
[55:44] happened because the walls would fall on
[55:47] them he said there was no one to drive
[55:51] them out there was no literal sign
[55:55] nothing that they saw to show that there
[55:58] was an earthquake coming but being that
[56:00] God takes care of his own how many of
[56:04] his own are here this
[56:06] morning God knows where you're at God
[56:09] knows your financial sit God knows your
[56:12] condition God knows all about
[56:14] that let's praise
[56:17] him and he does this for birds and he
[56:19] does this for cows and
[56:23] animals and he says he cares for his own
[56:26] they had a
[56:27] feeling and they were impressed by the
[56:31] Holy Spirit to get out of way from the
[56:35] trouble can you imagine a prophet saying
[56:38] the birds and the animals were impressed
[56:41] to get away from it I can tell you
[56:44] friends for a lot of the stuff I see
[56:46] today I get afraid of
[56:50] it come
[56:52] on you need to pray Holy Spirit impress
[56:56] me
[56:56] to move away from that to get clear of
[56:59] it if there's a question get away from
[57:03] it should I wear that if there's a
[57:05] question about what you should wear move
[57:08] away from
[57:09] it if there's a question about what
[57:11] you're doing just move away from
[57:14] it you know why I don't have newspapers
[57:16] come to my own I buy one occasionally
[57:19] but I don't have newspapers because I
[57:21] can't go through newspaper without
[57:23] feeling I've been defiled
[57:29] yes there's something there you see in a
[57:32] newspaper in the Vancouver son or the
[57:34] province or or your paper and by the
[57:37] time you're through it you feel defiled
[57:39] or advertising something or they're
[57:41] saying something and they're
[57:43] Godless and they mock what I
[57:46] treasure and I just feel I shouldn't
[57:49] expose myself and let the world and let
[57:51] Satan in the world mock my faith and
[57:54] mock my belief
[58:06] in the pergan church age and here's
[58:08] where my text
[58:14] is he said I wonder if we're
[58:17] sufficiently
[58:18] impressed with the word in our midst
[58:22] right
[58:27] the word in my
[58:28] brother the word in my
[58:31] sister the word coming over the
[58:34] pulpit I've been impressed not only
[58:37] impressed I listened to Brother John
[58:39] Andy's preach in the last couple weeks I
[58:42] listen to brother Tom preach I listen to
[58:46] brother Ron Spencer preach and the
[58:48] preaching of the word affects me very
[58:52] deeply but I'm preaching this to myself
[58:55] now this morning
[58:56] it's not enough to be in church and have
[58:59] your heart and spirit touched and moved
[59:04] it needs to be moved
[59:07] sufficiently so that you go out and do
[59:09] something about
[59:12] it once the man of God's been behind the
[59:14] pulpit and delivers his soul then it's
[59:17] up to the people to go out and say now
[59:19] my life take shape to how I was
[59:24] impressed I said this morning before I
[59:27] came to the pulpit what would you have
[59:29] me to do I feel affected in certain ways
[59:33] what would you have me to do I want to
[59:35] what would you be pleased with and it's
[59:38] not always
[59:41] easy it's not always the easy way
[59:44] sometimes it's the harder way and when
[59:47] the Lord spoke in a tongue and Inter
[59:50] interpretation through Danny Henry said
[59:54] because you've chosen the harder way and
[59:58] it's been your own choosing why would it
[1:00:00] be harder because there could have been
[1:00:02] success he could have been one of the
[1:00:04] greats of the world but he turned it
[1:00:07] down to stay with a little band of
[1:00:10] people poor people maybe disorganized
[1:00:13] people in his Tabernacle I went there
[1:00:16] and there see about maybe 400 450 people
[1:00:19] and I know this man standing up there
[1:00:21] could have 400,000
[1:00:30] I was
[1:00:31] impressed I was impressed with that kind
[1:00:33] of a
[1:00:35] life
[1:00:37] amen I wonder if we're sufficiently
[1:00:39] impressed with the word in our
[1:00:48] midst and the message went what went ye
[1:00:52] out to
[1:00:53] see he said John was man
[1:00:57] enough to be meek and humble he was man
[1:01:01] enough to stand on the banks of
[1:01:03] Jordan he didn't need a great synagogue
[1:01:06] or a place to preach he was humble he
[1:01:10] took the bright blue
[1:01:12] skies he took the bright blue skies he
[1:01:15] was humble enough that he didn't call
[1:01:18] upon the people to have to have so much
[1:01:21] money to Pastor their church he lived
[1:01:24] off of the grass Hoppers and wild honey
[1:01:28] and Jesus
[1:01:29] said what did you go out to
[1:01:34] see now he was zeroing in what was it
[1:01:37] that impressed you why did you go out
[1:01:41] there he didn't have fine clothing so it
[1:01:44] wasn't that he didn't speak nice flowery
[1:01:47] message so it wasn't that and he was
[1:01:50] pinning them down what is it you went to
[1:01:53] see and I could even say in message here
[1:01:56] birth pains if all those men were here
[1:01:59] I'd like to ask them that whole group of
[1:02:01] people why did you invite
[1:02:04] him it wasn't his nice language it
[1:02:07] wasn't his grammar it wasn't his command
[1:02:10] of the English it wasn't even as he said
[1:02:13] I'm not a preacher I can't put things
[1:02:15] together it wasn't that it wasn't a
[1:02:17] flowery message what did you go out to
[1:02:20] see the same reason those Pharisees went
[1:02:22] out to hear John because there was
[1:02:24] something in their heart deep down
[1:02:26] inside of saying he speaks the
[1:02:30] truth there was something inside saying
[1:02:33] God is with this
[1:02:36] person and I say to you this morning do
[1:02:38] you have do you have sufficient within
[1:02:41] is this God or is it
[1:02:45] Satan who is it that's speaking to you
[1:02:48] is it the Holy Ghost behind the pulpit
[1:02:51] is it ad viscal if it is vacate this
[1:02:54] place if it's just brother Tom Ray John
[1:02:57] Andes brother Ernie vill and wer these
[1:02:59] other brothers brother uh brother Murphy
[1:03:03] then just vacate the
[1:03:05] place now let me tell you this is an
[1:03:07] upto-date
[1:03:08] gospel it's an upto-date
[1:03:10] gospel I'm hewing to the
[1:03:14] line brother Kim asked me you remember
[1:03:18] brother Radu the other part of this
[1:03:20] story is brother Kim I'll just share
[1:03:23] some with the people I was just going
[1:03:26] into the meeting in
[1:03:27] Switzerland and I had counseled with
[1:03:29] brother Ru he had a spiritual question
[1:03:32] he was a minister and he also been a pro
[1:03:35] a translator and oversaw the translation
[1:03:38] for the voice of God actually and and
[1:03:42] when I was coming to the service Sunday
[1:03:43] morning he had a suitcase in his garment
[1:03:47] bag and he's walking I said where are
[1:03:49] you
[1:03:51] going we said we we're we're driving
[1:03:53] back to Romania
[1:03:56] oh I said
[1:03:58] that don't do
[1:04:00] that you know well he said you know and
[1:04:02] he began to get a little uh uneasy and I
[1:04:06] said brother brother Murphy's preaching
[1:04:08] this
[1:04:10] morning and I said okay he says I'm
[1:04:13] going to stay and he just dropped his
[1:04:16] bags and walked into the meeting with
[1:04:18] his wife and brother
[1:04:21] Murphy
[1:04:23] unleashed the burden of his soul
[1:04:27] and that man was
[1:04:28] smitten he told me after I'm so glad I
[1:04:31] stayed and then he wanted to see can we
[1:04:34] get these Romanian language messages on
[1:04:37] the Hub and that's how all that all
[1:04:39] happened he got so stirred he became so
[1:04:42] impressed with what he
[1:04:44] heard out of our brother Murphy's mouth
[1:04:47] that he was moved to
[1:04:49] action Hallelujah and because he was
[1:04:52] moved thousands of other people will
[1:04:55] hear the message and see it and print it
[1:04:58] and have it before them I say praise be
[1:05:00] to
[1:05:02] God we're not talking about something 40
[1:05:05] 50 years ago or something pie in the sky
[1:05:08] in the future we're talking about God on
[1:05:10] the scene now and it doesn't happen
[1:05:13] without work hard work not just
[1:05:17] preaching but work labor do what you can
[1:05:21] for God you'll never regret it
[1:05:25] make yourself
[1:05:30] available and then the prophet says in
[1:05:32] this message can I have just a few more
[1:05:34] minutes
[1:05:35] please he said John was mad enough and
[1:05:38] then he said Jesus said what did you go
[1:05:39] out to see did you go out what did you
[1:05:43] go out to see he asked it twice a person
[1:05:44] that would give give in to the Pharisees
[1:05:48] a reed shaken by every
[1:05:50] wind go in with the
[1:05:53] Sadducees when they came in one day he's
[1:05:56] this and another day he's that
[1:05:59] no he didn't go to see nothing did you
[1:06:03] go to see somebody dressed fine no an
[1:06:07] intellectual no what when you to
[1:06:12] see and he said go show John what's
[1:06:15] happening he said to
[1:06:17] the the man that John had sent cuz John
[1:06:20] was in prison go show John What's
[1:06:23] Happening Here the lame walk the blind
[1:06:25] see the deaf hear the dead are raised up
[1:06:29] and the poor has the gospel preached to
[1:06:33] them did this kind of a Ministry he
[1:06:36] could have had the world at his feet but
[1:06:38] the poor have the gospel preached to
[1:06:41] them blessed is he who is not offended
[1:06:43] in Me Oh my he said that was the sign of
[1:06:47] the Messiah that was the sign to show
[1:06:53] him this was the sign of the Messi I
[1:06:56] that the deaf here and the blind are
[1:06:58] healed and and the gospel the poor have
[1:07:01] the gospel preached to them go and tell
[1:07:03] John this because John will recognize
[1:07:06] that's the sign of the
[1:07:10] Messiah
[1:07:18] friends you and
[1:07:22] I have had of all the people's on the
[1:07:26] earth we have had the sign of the
[1:07:31] Messiah it could not have been
[1:07:34] clearer than what you have it you have
[1:07:37] it on your you have it at home you have
[1:07:39] the evidence of it on home I have it
[1:07:41] here in this little booklet we have seen
[1:07:44] the sign of the
[1:07:46] Messiah and when you hear it when you
[1:07:50] hear it and when I hear him and brother
[1:07:53] brandham cries out to these people in
[1:07:56] this
[1:07:58] message he
[1:08:01] says who is that who can do that he's
[1:08:05] crying out a man can't do
[1:08:07] that a man can't tell these people their
[1:08:11] name who's doing that he was trying to
[1:08:13] get them to say see the sign of
[1:08:16] Messiah it's Jesus
[1:08:19] Christ and some were affected and
[1:08:21] they're impressed and you can hear the
[1:08:23] response they didn't respond to the
[1:08:24] preaching of the word but they responded
[1:08:27] when the secret of the hearts were made
[1:08:29] known and that because that was visible
[1:08:31] they could see
[1:08:33] it but when I hear it I see my beloved
[1:08:37] bridegroom I see the one I'm United to I
[1:08:41] love him I love that that atmosphere
[1:08:45] that it brings I love that Supernatural
[1:08:48] I'm connected to we're connected to an
[1:08:51] eternal Realm
[1:08:53] [Applause]
[1:08:57] I want to preach and yet I I want to
[1:09:02] quit that's what my that's what our soul
[1:09:06] is linked to an
[1:09:09] invisible and when we hear the word all
[1:09:12] we have to do is hear it and we see
[1:09:15] it the hearing is more powerful than the
[1:09:19] physical Vision because the physical
[1:09:21] Vision attracts and as impresses the
[1:09:24] natural man
[1:09:26] oh he's well dressed oh listen to the
[1:09:28] music listen to where listen to what he
[1:09:30] knows listen to his intellect listen to
[1:09:33] his skills here and we see all that and
[1:09:35] the natural mind goes ooh oh oh oh we're
[1:09:40] so impressed we need to lay that aside
[1:09:43] and we need to hear the word and hear it
[1:09:46] we hear so much hear the word hear the
[1:09:47] word eat the book and so on so forth
[1:09:49] what I'm saying is not so much volumes
[1:09:52] of what you go through it's what you
[1:09:55] hear when you hear it and I want to ask
[1:09:59] you when you hear the next time ask
[1:10:03] yourself what is it I'm
[1:10:07] seeing what is it do I see
[1:10:11] here and does that Vision affect
[1:10:15] you Jesus said what did you go out to
[1:10:19] see I don't mean to be too
[1:10:21] direct but what did you come here for
[1:10:24] this morning
[1:10:26] that's really where we're at what did
[1:10:28] you why did you
[1:10:30] come why are you here why is this your
[1:10:36] church why are you professed to be a
[1:10:38] message
[1:10:40] believer or you
[1:10:48] know I just can't let
[1:10:50] go I just can't let go
[1:10:55] I just can't let go
[1:10:59] am I've seen someone I love too
[1:11:03] much just can't let
[1:11:05] go I won't give him up for
[1:11:08] anything take the whole world but give
[1:11:11] me this
[1:11:14] Jesus take all the success and take all
[1:11:17] the wealth and take all the money and
[1:11:19] take all this stuff it's all just a
[1:11:21] bunch of trash that's right that's right
[1:11:25] if God gives it to you use it for the
[1:11:27] kingdom of God amen hallelujah
[1:11:32] amen and if he doesn't give it to you
[1:11:35] don't let that stop you don't let don't
[1:11:37] let your life be given over to strain
[1:11:40] for it that are going to eat up my
[1:11:43] energy and eat up my life and learn all
[1:11:46] I can learn and and get as far as I can
[1:11:49] in this world no that's not what it's at
[1:11:58] but there is a group of
[1:12:03] people that are impressed by what they
[1:12:08] hear and by hearing they have seen
[1:12:14] him brother brandom as God
[1:12:19] said the
[1:12:22] poor and how he esteemed them
[1:12:26] and the gospel was preached to them that
[1:12:28] is why it wasn't that the people
[1:12:31] rejected brother Bram it was that he
[1:12:34] chose the harder
[1:12:37] way if he could have just they just
[1:12:39] wanted him to adjust two or three things
[1:12:41] he could have adjusted and had tens of
[1:12:44] thousands of people but he chose to be
[1:12:47] with
[1:12:48] you he chose to be with the likes of
[1:12:51] us the sign of Messiah was given to us
[1:12:55] the sign of the Resurrection was given
[1:12:57] to
[1:12:59] you Jesus saying that's what Jesus
[1:13:02] saying blessed are
[1:13:04] you for what you see am blessed are you
[1:13:09] for what you hear and blessed are you
[1:13:12] that you can give your life
[1:13:15] amen to be a testimony for
[1:13:24] him Lord
[1:13:26] willing I want to come
[1:13:29] too and I didn't spend I didn't spend
[1:13:32] the time that I
[1:13:37] could there are those that are giving
[1:13:39] their life
[1:13:44] entirely to the mark of the
[1:13:46] beast brother brandham said they get
[1:13:50] marked and they give themselves to
[1:13:53] it and you think think the mark of the
[1:13:55] beast is some awful creature no no is a
[1:14:02] Slicker the churches are full of it the
[1:14:06] churches today are full of it friends I
[1:14:09] don't have to tell you that you know
[1:14:11] that you're in some special place I
[1:14:12] don't want to tell you that I simply
[1:14:14] want to tell you the Believers of this
[1:14:16] message they don't know how to be
[1:14:19] thankful to the degree that we ought to
[1:14:21] be thankful that I'm not getting some
[1:14:24] imprint
[1:14:26] of some man's idea or some some
[1:14:30] denominational uh Bible school that has
[1:14:34] been taught people been taught some of
[1:14:36] the there's a people that have been
[1:14:37] taught by the Holy Spirit you want to
[1:14:40] say thank God I am where I am thank God
[1:14:43] for the Revelation that has come to my
[1:14:44] heart and soul you can't be taught a
[1:14:47] revelation that has to come to you by
[1:14:51] God said the promise of God is a seal to
[1:14:54] those
[1:14:55] who are the Seed of
[1:14:57] Abraham the promise is a
[1:15:04] seal I'm just going to I'm going to
[1:15:06] close in a few
[1:15:13] minutes the
[1:15:16] serpent when he approached
[1:15:20] Eve he said you know has God said so he
[1:15:24] he came with his Doctrine did God say it
[1:15:27] was a
[1:15:29] question and she said well we can eat of
[1:15:31] all the trees we not to touch the treats
[1:15:34] in the midst of the
[1:15:36] garden and and then he he appealed to
[1:15:40] her it'll make you
[1:15:42] wise and you'll be like
[1:15:45] gods and brother bradam said she didn't
[1:15:48] know but she wanted to know she didn't
[1:15:51] have the knowledge but she wanted to
[1:15:52] have the knowledge and so that that
[1:15:55] that's what caused her to
[1:15:57] yield and she was left with the
[1:16:01] imprint you follow
[1:16:03] me and the Bible says the Bible says
[1:16:06] then she looked and she
[1:16:09] saw the
[1:16:11] tree and it was it was pleasing to her
[1:16:13] it was pleasant it appealed to
[1:16:17] her and then you're sick because of
[1:16:22] that you've been to funerals because of
[1:16:25] of
[1:16:25] that the police penitentiaries are full
[1:16:29] of full of men and women because of that
[1:16:34] we don't we don't understand we don't
[1:16:36] grasp the penalty of this and we don't
[1:16:38] understand the benefit of being free
[1:16:41] from it
[1:16:43] Hallelujah and he was cast out of the
[1:16:46] garden and he and and and the one he was
[1:16:50] being you as an instrument for was cast
[1:16:52] out of
[1:16:53] Heaven he was cast Out of Heaven out of
[1:16:56] the presence of God and then and then
[1:16:59] Adam and Eve they had to go out of the
[1:17:01] presence of God because now they had the
[1:17:03] mark of the one who had been cast out of
[1:17:05] Heaven they had his mark his mark on
[1:17:08] them but God who rich in Mercy made a
[1:17:12] way
[1:17:13] back Hallelujah
[1:17:32] when you go out from here
[1:17:34] today and you are in
[1:17:37] your workplace and in this
[1:17:41] world I would just do everything within
[1:17:43] my whole
[1:17:44] being to have
[1:17:46] you
[1:17:48] say God deal with me because he can only
[1:17:51] deal with an individual on an individual
[1:17:53] level
[1:17:55] deal with me and we're so different one
[1:17:57] from the other deal with me in such a
[1:18:01] way something spoke to me in the
[1:18:04] service I was impressed with something
[1:18:06] that was said and I am praying and
[1:18:09] asking God that you will ask him to take
[1:18:13] those word take that phrase take that
[1:18:15] quote and shape my life amen to I will
[1:18:20] be in the shape and the I'll be in the
[1:18:22] image of the Lord Jesus Christ the word
[1:18:25] for this day
[1:18:29] amen
[1:18:35] hallelujah
[1:18:40] hallelujah you know it's um I'm just
[1:18:43] trying to close but there's a a thing or
[1:18:46] two out
[1:18:56] I spoke to you earlier of
[1:18:58] Moses and the Bible says this because I
[1:19:01] have the words here in front of
[1:19:04] me he saw the burning bush and the angel
[1:19:07] of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame
[1:19:09] of fire out of the midst of the Bush and
[1:19:11] he looked and behold the bush burned
[1:19:14] with fire and the Bush was not consumed
[1:19:18] and Moses said I'll turn aside now and
[1:19:20] and and see this great sight why the
[1:19:24] bush is not not burned and the Lord saw
[1:19:27] that he turned aside to see and God
[1:19:31] Called to him out of the midst of the
[1:19:33] Bush and said Moses Moses and he said
[1:19:36] here am I and he said draw not nigh
[1:19:39] hither put off thy shoes from off thy
[1:19:42] feet I have a point I want to make here
[1:19:44] for the place whereon thou standest is
[1:19:46] Holy Ground moreover he said I am the
[1:19:50] god of thy father the god of Abraham the
[1:19:54] god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and
[1:19:57] Moses hid his face for he was afraid to
[1:20:02] look upon God now please get my point as
[1:20:06] I close now he was attracted to this
[1:20:09] site because that was his visual part he
[1:20:12] was attracted to the site visually
[1:20:15] attracted why the bush isn't consumed
[1:20:19] and so he he moved to to look at this
[1:20:21] now he hears a voice and the one is
[1:20:24] identifying I'm the god of your father
[1:20:27] I'm the god of Abraham the god of Isaac
[1:20:30] and the god of Jacob and when he heard
[1:20:33] when he heard that now it was the voice
[1:20:36] that was speaking to him I want to
[1:20:38] impress this congregation we can't put
[1:20:41] enough sufficient emphasis on the voice
[1:20:46] that you are are our privileged to
[1:20:51] hear Hallelujah it is the power of of
[1:20:55] transformation in this
[1:20:57] hour it will change your life it will
[1:21:01] change your home it will change your
[1:21:05] future the power of transformation is in
[1:21:09] the word and when he heard who it was
[1:21:12] that was speaking then the scripture
[1:21:14] says that he hid his face for he was
[1:21:17] afraid to look upon God now he was
[1:21:21] seeing something from what he heard that
[1:21:24] didn't see when he saw
[1:21:27] it and that is why even the world
[1:21:32] recognizes that there's a greater effect
[1:21:34] on a person from what they can hear
[1:21:38] spiritually if we hear it
[1:21:41] spiritually in the word I trust
[1:21:44] that God will take this to your heart
[1:21:47] amen and now if you want to if you would
[1:21:51] like I would request that you perhaps
[1:21:53] hear birth pains
[1:21:55] and the world falling
[1:21:57] apart and I want to speak on the two
[1:22:01] aspects I want to speak on the
[1:22:03] travail and the
[1:22:08] joy and a Believer feels
[1:22:12] both a Believer feels both we feel the
[1:22:16] travail you're in the world and and and
[1:22:20] your contact with the world is a travail
[1:22:23] to you I just just want to get your mind
[1:22:25] in that in that direction and and I can
[1:22:29] I can take instances out of the
[1:22:30] scripture which I won't do right now but
[1:22:33] it's it's a travail and it's a struggle
[1:22:36] it's like a Warfare but the Bible tells
[1:22:39] us Jesus said that Joy comes when a
[1:22:45] Manchild is born and that's why I'm
[1:22:47] trying to get you to see friends when
[1:22:50] you hear the message you shall I say in
[1:22:55] the name of the Lord see the
[1:22:59] Manchild you'll see
[1:23:03] him
[1:23:05] hallelujah
[1:23:06] hallelujah and then we forget the
[1:23:09] travail because of who we
[1:23:12] see and if you've got things that are
[1:23:14] troubling you and pressing on you and
[1:23:17] the world and all of its all of its
[1:23:20] issues just remember you have access
[1:23:24] amen
[1:23:24] [Music]
[1:23:25] you have access as a believer that you
[1:23:29] can channel into that will cause this to
[1:23:33] vanish away Hallelujah doesn't mean that
[1:23:36] it's not there but you see something
[1:23:39] that's beyond
[1:23:40] that Hallelujah God bless you let's
[1:23:45] stand shall
[1:23:51] we I trust that you've been affected by
[1:23:54] the message but I would like you to be
[1:23:58] sufficiently I would like to hear a
[1:24:01] testimony I've gone from this place you
[1:24:04] know it affected my life to a to the
[1:24:07] degree God spoke to me God impressed me
[1:24:12] and now I'm letting that imprint my life
[1:24:16] Hallelujah the Seal of God the Seal of
[1:24:18] the Holy
[1:24:19] Spirit heavenly father I pray for the
