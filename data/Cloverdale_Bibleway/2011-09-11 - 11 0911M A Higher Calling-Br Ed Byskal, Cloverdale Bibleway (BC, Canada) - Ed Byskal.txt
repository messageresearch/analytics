Amen. If you have a need upon your heart this morning, maybe make it known by the uplifted hand. Amen. Brother Kyle, why don't you come? &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we love you. We're so thankful for salvation, Lord. That you saved us from our sins and our trespasses, God. We just wandered around this world clueless, Lord, but you you saved us, God. And I'm so thankful for that, Lord Jesus. God, you gave us a down payment, Father. And we're looking forward to receiving our full inheritance, Lord Jesus. Oh, God. The world is in such a awful state, Lord. You see it, Lord, all over the globe in the Middle East, God. And Father, even in New York today, Lord Jesus, but oh God, we know that you're in control, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, we have confidence in you, oh God. We may not understand everything, Father, but we know that you're in control and that you love us, God. And Father, we love you with all our mind and our heart and our soul and our strength, Jesus. Where we're weary, Lord, where we're burdened, where we're tired, Lord, where we fail, Father, may you just give us strength, Lord. Pour in the oil, Lord. pour in the wine, Lord Jesus. And help us continue on down the path, oh God. Just just a little bit longer to go, God. Let that that second wind come inside of us, God. And Father, just raise up the weary, God. Help those who are in need, Lord Jesus, whether it's financial, God, or in their body, Father. Oh, God. You're more than able, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, you own the cattle on a thousand hills, Father. And you created the the heavens and the earth, Lord, with no problem. It didn't even cause you to sweat, God. You're so mighty and powerful, Lord Jesus. and that you're so humble that you have such a desire to come amongst us this morning, oh God, and to speak through us through our pastor, God. I just pray that you'd help him, Lord. Give him strength, Father. Give him liberty. May he find that channel, God, just above and beyond his notes just to be able to speak to us, God. And may you be able to receive it, Father, and walk out these doors stronger, Lord, uplifted, God, more able to live in this wicked world. And Father, would you help the prayer request, Lord, for the human message, this man, God? Oh, Father, just reach out to him, Lord Jesus. So reach out to all the unspoken prayer requests on our hearts, God. You know, our families and different things, God, but we we thank you, Lord, and we love you. We appreciate that you've allowed us to come here this day, Lord. May we give it to you, Lord. The afternoon and the evening service. May you just be glorified and honored in all we say and do, Lord. We love you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. As you have your seats, I have a couple of announcements to go over with you real briefly. We have a special this morning by Sister Jessica and Sister Charity Caldwell. So maybe as I'm going through the announcements, they can come and get ready. do want to remind everybody that um next Sunday evening communion and footwashing will start the service at 400 pm sharp to try and accommodate all those that'll come in from the outlying area Seattle Tacoma Federal Way and down in that area the saints will come and join us.

Your holy name God the in highest. &gt;&gt; You're my king. &gt;&gt; I lift your name this morning, Lord. Oh Lord, I your holy name. You're the great I &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? Hallelujah. We're happy to have brother Kim Dingwall back &gt;&gt; from a very hurried trip in India. And uh Brother Kim, I'd like to have you come down and just uh uh say a word. I tried to think of a phrase that would encompass Brother Kim's trip. And I came up with a phrase. I think it's very fitting. God was with him. Isn't that all we need? &gt;&gt; If I could say to you this coming week, God will be with you. &gt;&gt; Everything's okay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And uh God was certainly with brother Kim. I just wanted to have him say a word about that. And then uh I want to I just just got this from China within probably the last hour and I want to say a word about that. I want to say a word quickly about brother, our brother Ivan. He's just boarding a plane now and he's going to be gone for about 2 or 3 months uh in China. Uh so I want to say to the congregation here, the congregation that is streaming, it's wonderful. It's a great privilege and honor to be entrusted that we could have men and send resources send our prayers and lift these people into the presence of God &gt;&gt; by our prayer. &gt;&gt; And for us to worship around that &gt;&gt; we're worshiping today not only because God is here but because God is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only that God is with us but God is with them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're so happy that God was with our brother Kim on this journey. Take a moment, please, brother Cameron. &gt;&gt; I know you could take all morning, but we'll we'll &gt;&gt; I won't you won't. Let's Amen. Well, it's certainly good to be home among the saints here. Um but you know, when you travel and you're spending time with believers, you always feel at home. I felt as at home in India as I do here because when you're in the presence of the Lord, you're at home. &gt;&gt; Amen. I told the believers that when I was there at Brother Isaac's church. I said, "I feel so at home here because I always feel at home in the presence of the Lord, you know." &gt;&gt; So, we uh I don't even know what day we left. It's been a blur for me for the last couple of weeks. Anybody know what day I left? I can't remember what day I left. Um but we left. We spent a couple of days getting there. Um it was a it was a rush trip so unfortunately we weren't even be able to get a a comfortable itinerary so we just had to take what we could get. So we uh we left took a couple of days to get there and then um the the purpose of the trip we're just making a major transition in India as you know we had for many many years 30 years or more a printing operation and uh you know doing work there was a printing operation in Chennai with the Glattis DA memorial building that was there and a large printing operation with the large press and uh we're just making a big transition in India now how we distribute the message. And so the last time I was there, we sold the printing equipment and we've been dispersing the inventory of books all around the world. There was almost a million books in stock when we when we went and uh we've been sending books all over India. The books are better in the hands of the believers that speak the language than they are on the shelf on the other side of the country. &gt;&gt; So we've been shipping the books out um all all over the country. we were left over with close to a 100,000 English books that they didn't have much need for in India. So they those are being shipped as we speak to West Africa to uh go to Ghana to all the believers that are are in need of books in West Africa in uh in the English language. So when when we when we arrived we had some uh it you know doing a transaction in India you know I've done many land transactions but you know this was a learning experience for me to uh go to go to India we sold the Glattis Dal memorial building and uh with the intention of setting up a a new distribution in uh in Chennai for that region and more regional distribution for the message as opposed to one centralized location in Chennai. So we went to sell the building and of course you know it's altogether different than here in here land titles keeps all the records for all the transactions from the land. In India the land titles doesn't keep any of that. They actually when you when you post a transaction they give a copy of it back to you and then you have to keep that copy forever. And so if I sell you a piece of land I need to prove that I actually bought it and the person back. So they call those parent documents and they go all the way back to the 50s. So those were all locked up in a safe deposit box that we didn't have access to just because of the way things were. And we tried last time to get access to those documents and couldn't. And this time we found bank uh favor with the bank manager and he went to the person in charge and he just said open that box. And they we were able to get the we were able to get the documents and and and make the land transaction. And uh at the same time the brothers had identified another piece of property to purchase to put up another building. So, so those of you who have been involved in a building project here for the last year or so, about the time we're finished here, you can all come to India and we're going to build another one in India. Little different construction method, but you're all welcome to come and join in on that project. So, we've identified that that piece of property and have an engineer working there to do some drawings and get ready for us. So, we'll start construction of that later this year. And uh brother Isaac um has a trustee in his church uh his name is brother Michael who's been on the board over there for a number of years and he's just uh between the burden that brother Isaac has to get it to get the message out. You know when I spent time with brother Isaac I felt like I was with brother Biscllow or brother Hildebrand the way their desire is to see the word just pushed pushed out to all the all the different believers. Brother Isaac is just working working. He's a busy man. He goes uh you know he he he preaches in his own church three times a week. Then he preaches outreach services almost every day in different different cities and uh you know they've established many works all over all over their area of India in the south of India and they've uh you know been building churches. I went to I went to one of the churches. I mean it was a church building that they put up. It had uh it was about a 2,000 square foot church that holds three or 4 hundred people and uh it just you know it just to to see the maturity there you know the deacons are in place and the trustees and the ministry and and just it just an absolutely established an established work there from that center where the word will be able to go out from they're currently involved in three building projects right now building three churches across the southern part of India and I'm saying that because you know if you felt to contribute to that that would be a wonderful thing. Um, for about $22,000, they can put up a a a building that's about 2,000 square ft and and they're putting up really nice nicely finished buildings. It's a, you know, a brick and mortar building. So those those projects are going on throughout India and uh it was a it was it was really a a good trip from a standpoint of moving forward with where we want to move with getting the message out across the country but also spending time among some of the believers and just seeing you know I I went to India the first time in 1983 and so to be there now and to see the maturity of the believers like to be in the congregation there you felt as at home as you were here you know the the presence of the Lord or the level of the ministry of the word, the the the lives of the people, the dedication. Um, it just it it it was a real encouragement to me to to see that. So, uh, Brother Michael has, uh, been running the affairs of the William Brandham Good News Society is what the what it's called there in India, um, since, uh, since I was there last time. And, you know, communication's a little spotty with the people in India. So, you know, we're we were wondering here, you know, how are things going? What's going on? a few spotty emails back and forth. When I got there, I just rejoiced to find out that they had translated, printed, and distributed 20 messages in the last about nine months. &gt;&gt; So, that was really exciting. They're doing Hindi um they're doing Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu messages and printing them and sending them out. And and the difference now with the churches being a little bit more more mature, what they're doing is um every time they print, they translate and then they print a few thousand copies of a book and they they find a church somewhere in southern India that sponsors each individual book and they print their name on the back and out they go. So the local the local believers in India have have really stepped up and are really you know um hopefully making us obsolete over there you know as the as they take ownership and they take they take the ownership for the drive to actually get the message out. So seeing that level of maturity happening among the body there in India was that was the exciting part for me on on this particular trip. So, we just ask that the Lord be with them. And like I say, they're uh they're they're not really even asking for help. Uh they just finished a church that was that was one of these churches that they built. They raised all the funds within India to get that one done. And uh you know, just among all the believers in India, but you know, there's there they've got more people that need churches than they can actually get done. So, you know, any help that we could offer and and of course, one of the there's there's a brother who got saved about 4 years ago and and uh he's actually running the the construction projects for them and they're doing the projects much like what we're doing next door. Um sometime maybe we'll show you a video of it. Um it would be an encouragement to you sisters to realize there are things you can do. You know, over there you see these sisters and they're you remember how we pumped the concrete here? We had that big machine and pumped the concrete. Well, the way they pump concrete is the brothers mix the concrete in the machine. They pour it on the ground and then the sister puts it in a bucket which passes to the next sister up up all the way up to the top and they pour it in and they just they were doing a whole slab 2,000 square ft like that, you know. So, uh and and the whole church involved the pastor's wife, you know, um carrying gravel on the top of her head in a in a in a in in a pan and and the whole church just completely involved. So when you see that, you really want to get behind and do what you can to help them. Like the one project is just getting a little bit stalled right now because they're just short on funds. They're all standing there willing to work. And like I say, when you look at the group that's working, I think there's probably 200 or so people in the church and there was 150 of them on the site working. Everybody from the little kids to the they were all just there working together. And so when you see that, that's not people just sitting back saying, "Well, I hope somebody builds a church for us." you know, they're just all working towards it and doing what they can and and so uh it was it was wonderful to see and wonderful to be a part of. So, we'll like to give you a little more information a little later. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless. &gt;&gt; Well, we're privileged. Uh, I don't regret I don't regret for a moment all the 30 years we've been laboring there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I know 30 years sounds like a long time, but it's gone by just like that. And we don't regret one moment of it. Uh, just quickly, if I can just take this moment, please. Brother Murphy just sent this. He said, "I just finished the meeting in Da Dao Dhou Sichuan province and then he's going down to Sanzen tomorrow." Uh he said, "By God's grace, I've been ministering uh just the word and asked the people to keep their eyes uh keep their eyes heavenly, not earthly." And I thought that was good. He also went and met Sister Asenth's mother. And she has, as you know, she's been struggling with cancer. But brother Ivan told me last night that his his mother, who's a doctor, Brother Ivan's mother is a doctor and has been checking her and saying that she's been getting stronger uh all the time. And uh Brother Murphy said that the cancer cells in her lung is under control. But uh but uh uh they she has certain challenges and struggles and we want to pray for her that she's not depressed by these things. Uh he said, "I was communicated with brother Ben. Here's what I want you to hear and rejoice over." Oh, brother Ben is one of the young men there who's ministering. He's right now in Hanan Province and there are more than 110 people received this message in the last two weeks. Actually, brother Caleb and brother Ben, brother David went to this place last year while I was with brother Elvie in the south. And people in this place are brother Ben's friends. He's a young man that was in college and heard the message in college. Said they received this message gladly but were not baptized. Some of the people were students in the college and when they left they started to read the message. The leader is a woman preacher. After she read it for a few months, she phoned Brother Ben. See how necessary it is to have the message. You understand? &gt;&gt; If they don't have ministry, they need to hear that word. And that's the best way for for them to receive it. And after she'd received it for a few months, now notice the effect. Then she phoned Brother Ben while he's in Hanzhao for the youth camp. And so, Brother Ben went to this place, expounded the message to them, and 70 people were baptized. There was 110. Now, there's 70 baptized. I'm talking about in the last few days. Then, Brother Ben went to the other two places on September the 3rd and uh and 16 people were baptized. He went to another place on September the 9th and there were 23 baptized. He's continuing this trip at this moment. I don't know how this is going to unfold, but I can see the Lord is moving mightily. Brother Ben said he can only share with the people what the Lord has made real to him because he's only been in the message a year. But he said that he would invite me, that was brother Timothy, I mean brother Murphy rather, uh to go with him after the October convention to those new places and to further establish them in the word. He closes by saying, "I saw the Lord is moving in a miraculous way so far and the spirit of unity is binding the brothers together and let the let the and let the people forget about their own idea and disagreement and looking forward to the high calling from the Lord." Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand and let's just join our hearts in that. Of course, we were just singing uh Lord I lift thy name God. Elohim. You're the great I am the lamb. my comfort can. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Heavenly Father, we come to you because in ourselves we are nothing. We realize that we are totally dependent upon the almighty Holy Spirit. We pray that the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; the spirit of God &gt;&gt; that has been in attendance with the bride of Jesus Christ, the blood washed, bloodwashed group, we pray, Father, that today you will take and anoint your children. We've come here, Lord, not to meet with one another and not to hear man's words, but we've come, oh God, that we might have the very thought of God, the very attribute thought of God to drop down into our souls, Lord. Move us, I pray, and may we yield to the moving of the Holy Spirit. I pray there will be a yay yay in our hearts, oh God. We will say, "Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Take me, oh God. I come surrendered. I come to yield myself. We've come here, Lord, not to put in time on a Sunday morning. We've come here not as a formality. We have come here because the message is urgent and we believe we need to be strengthened. We do not know what kind of battles we will face in the coming days. But we pray that you'll make this entire audience of congregation of people a victorious people. Father, we can only believe in victory. Father, our Lord Jesus Christ is a mighty conqueror. You raised and oh God took conqueror. You conquered death and all all that withtood you. And I pray, Father, you'll be with Brother Murphy today. Be with Brother Ivan as he travels. Father, be with the pastors in Vietnam, in Africa, in Europe, and all over the world. Oh God, and especially here in our country. We need you, Lord. There's wickednesses on every side, oh God, but you're greater. Light is greater than the darkness. Pierce the deepest darkness, oh God. And I pray you'll banish all confusion. Anyone standing here that may be bound in the name of Jesus Christ. Set them free at this moment. I pray, Father, by the power of the living Christ. And may the resurrection of Jesus Christ be proven here today. We pray father your will be done anoint speaker and hearers in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You take your Bible. I want to turn to Philippians the third chapter. In the closing comments of brother Murphy, he said they were looking forward for the high calling. Is that better? Looking forward for the high calling. And he didn't know, of course. Uh, I'm speaking to you today, the Lord willing, on a higher calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I want to start reading in the 10th verse. that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death. If by any means I might attain under the resurrection of the dead, not as though I had already attained either were already perfect, but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us read that 14th verse together. It'll do us good. I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll not need to turn, but I'm going to read two verses out of Romans 11 and 28. As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes, speaking of Israel. But as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. &gt;&gt; So the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance. I will read two verses out of Job while you just listen. If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time. I will wait till my change come. Thou shalt call and I will answer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou wil have a desire. Thou wil have a desire to the work of thine hands. Thou shalt call. &gt;&gt; I will answer. &gt;&gt; And we will answer. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats. There can be no answer until there is a call. You can't answer unless there's been a call. &gt;&gt; So the call is first. It's not us seeking God or him seeking us. &gt;&gt; He calls. &gt;&gt; We answer. &gt;&gt; That's the program. &gt;&gt; Acts 2:39 said, "For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." There's callings in life. Some of the students from the school, they're not in school this year because they have finished their studies and so they're looking forward to whatever is out there for them perhaps to try to determine what their call in life is. And uh there are some professions and uh professions in life that are they can be a job or they can be a calling. And I think in some of the areas of of the professions of the world there is it's more pronounced say doctors, nurses, caregivers, those that work in a compassionate uh those jobs that require compassion. Some are in those jobs and I know that you will agree with this. Some are in those positions as a job. They're interested in what they're earning. They're interested in the next increase. But there are others that are in it because they feel a calling. &gt;&gt; They would do it for less money. &gt;&gt; They they they don't watch the clock. They go beyond the call of duty because it's a calling to them. They feel it within them. And and then there are those that are I always think of teachers in school. Uh there are some of those and it's exactly the same thing. Some are in it because it's a job. They go at the starting time and they leave at the quitting time. But there are others that feel a call of God. They feel uh those those especially we have here. I know they are here because they feel a call. And and furthermore, they're not interested so much in the in what they're earning are because I'm sure all of them are earning less than the teachers that are out in the in the uh in the public schools. Uh then there are those that are in the ministry and a ministry can be a call and it can be a job. I want you to know and I'm sure that you do know the brothers that stand behind this pulpit aren't here for a job. &gt;&gt; They could go out in the world and do something different, perhaps do something better, but they feel a call on their life. Brother Bram talks about uh talks about uh preachers that weren't receiving the message because they were afraid on the basis of a meal ticket. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are not here for a meal ticket. &gt;&gt; How thankful we are about that. And so long then there's a it it says concerning a calling that it's an inner urge or a strong impulse especially one believed to be divinely inspired to accept the truth of Jesus Christ. There's a a calling within some people and I don't want to get on to that now. I that'll be perhaps the next service or another service. uh it's a strong urge to follow a particular career or to do a particular a particular type of work an occupation a professor a profession or or a career as such then as far as the callings and hearing the call I want to just expand your thought for a moment while I'm introducing this uh that to hear the call is not just something that happens in life because the Bible says Jesus speaking, "Marvel not at this. For the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice shall hear his voice long after the hearing, the faculty of hearing has gone." &gt;&gt; Amen. and all the bones and the eard drum and the structures of the body have deteriorated and gone to nothing more than ashes. There's some substance there's some essence of the creation of God that even after that body is buried and gone to the sea or gone in gases by burning or gone to dust in a grave. Jesus said, "Marvel not at this, &gt;&gt; for the day is coming." &gt;&gt; For the day is coming, the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice. &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's a voice. &gt;&gt; That's a call. &gt;&gt; And you're going to answer it. &gt;&gt; Believer, unbeliever, make believer's going to answer that call. And so we'll be talking about that a little further on going beyond the camp. I think of uh politicians. Politicians are perhaps there's some there with a call. I don't know. They feel that they want to better the world or better their country, better their state. And the prophet said, "Going beyond the camp, we need another Abraham Lincoln. We need another John Quincy Adams. We need somebody who will stand regardless of which way the wind's blowing. &gt;&gt; We need somebody to stand regardless of which way the votes are going &gt;&gt; or what the people think. We need preachers that'll preach from conviction. &gt;&gt; We need those that will speak because of truth. Right. &gt;&gt; And he said that will give their honest conviction. Today a denominational preacher, he said though you show him in the word the truth, he don't know what to do and he's afraid he will lose his meal ticket. &gt;&gt; So people preaching for a meal ticket, preaching for a position, preaching perhaps for the honor or their position in life. He said we need men and women today &gt;&gt; that's burly with the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody that will stand and tell their conviction and point out what's right and what's wrong. &gt;&gt; Whether the word of God's right or whether the denomination's right. &gt;&gt; In the ministry of the five-fold ministry, God has ordained offices &gt;&gt; and has placed a calling. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a calling first in the life of those called to those offices. If there isn't a calling in the life, there are some that are perhaps preaching or holding a position that because they're they have a certain gift or a certain talent or or people look up to them. That has nothing to do with the calling. It might be the person who is uh having difficulty putting things together, can't speak exactly uh right or whatever more. It it has nothing to do with human ability. It has to do with the call of God. &gt;&gt; And if the call of God is there, God's going to back it up. &gt;&gt; Doesn't it's irrelevant what kind of education they had. Well, they can't go. He talked about those wanting to go to missions and they couldn't go until they had reached a certain status and certain qualification, certain level of education. That has nothing to do with it. In fact, is that might be the biggest deterrent, &gt;&gt; the biggest uh you know hindrance rather than the biggest help in the message the voice of the sign. But brother Brandham refers to Moses being elected and being called. Then he refers to Jeremiah said to God speaking to Jeremiah before you were formed in your mother's womb, I ordained you to be a prophet to the nation. And John the Baptist was identified in the scripture. He's the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord. And so was all the offices of God. all the offices of God. Those you mothers, fathers, offices that God has established. And if they are, he said, if they are called of God, then they're educate, if they're educated into it, it's only cannon fodder. &gt;&gt; So those are powerful words. &gt;&gt; Just uh just being educated, he said it's just cannon fodder. It can't be nothing. If it's a meal ticket, then you sell your birthright for a meal ticket. You'll compromise to go with an organization or some group. &gt;&gt; But if it's of God, you'll stand by that word regardless because you were born to stand by it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Moses, no one else could take his place. No one else could do the job. He was ordained to do it. And brother, sister, so I include everyone here. If you've got eternal life, you were ordained to do a certain thing. &gt;&gt; Maybe a good housewife. How many housewives we have here? Many. Maybe something else. But nobody can take your place. &gt;&gt; God has called has made you God has made you a place. And don't try to take somebody else's place. &gt;&gt; So that's a call of God. I believe that every believer is here under the call of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every believer. And those of you that are on uh on the internet as well live streaming this service right now, I want to emphasize a higher call. That's what the message is. &gt;&gt; A higher call. &gt;&gt; Amen. their calling in life. And now here we'll include everyone. I have a few quotes I want to show here, please. I know thy works, thy labor, and thy patience. The scripture reads, "As he walks in the midst of his church, he is aware of the suffering of his people and he cares." &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he cares? &gt;&gt; And it was the days of captivity in Egypt when he heard their cries. He who never changes still hears the cries of the oppressed as he walks among them. &gt;&gt; I tell you, this God doesn't change. This God doesn't get weary. &gt;&gt; This God doesn't He's not asleep. &gt;&gt; This God's not tired. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And listen to me, friends. Regardless of how many times you've called, he's fully prepared to hear your whisper today. &gt;&gt; Who never changes, still hears the cries of the oppressed as he walks amongst them. The very word labor signifies a weariness through oppression. I want you just to stop there for a moment. I've talked to enough of you people that are here. I've talked to enough people in my lifetime and this age is going to be identified and earmarked as a time of weariness &gt;&gt; because of the pressures of life. There's no simple. You can go to the farmer. You can go to the You can I I have made many journeys during the time when brother Bud Southwick was still living going up to the people that are guides, hunting guides, and out in the wilderness and trappers and all. You think, "Oh, this is just wonderful. What a nice laid-back life." Don't fool yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I They were getting under so much pressure and the horses need to be fed and this has to happen. I got to fix this piece of machinery. I thought, my goodness, let me go back to the rat race. &gt;&gt; You think that's humorous? That's exactly the truth. I've been with farmers. I thought, let me out of here. They were just so concerned. I got to fix the barn. I got to do this. We got to do that. And the women were busy and the kids were busy and everybody was busy. It's It's nothing you're going to You can't get away from it. &gt;&gt; If you think it's a life of ease and everything's laidback, go out and spend some time with Brother Derek and Sister Debbie. They just have such a laid-back life back there in Mount Baker at the foot of Mount Baker. They just look up there at Mount Baker every day. It's so nice. &gt;&gt; Some of you folks need to go out there. &gt;&gt; It's just so laidback. You'll be up to your arms and suds in the washing dishes or something. They'll be having another crew coming in or who knows what's what's taking place. And he said here through the weariness and through oppression. God's people and I have this underlined God's people do not only work for him in a labor of love but they suffer for him with joy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do remember that friends. These are not idle words. When you suffer, expect some joy. &gt;&gt; Don't be wearied with it. &gt;&gt; He said they are patient in bearing the yoke. &gt;&gt; God's people. &gt;&gt; You know why they're patient in bearing the yoke? You're called to it. &gt;&gt; This first age suffered great persecution. It had to work hard to preach the gospel and shed forth truth. I want to just stop there, friends. We're not here to have a Sunday school picnic. &gt;&gt; We're here to work hard &gt;&gt; to get the gospel out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's so much that I could say and fact is I have to say it. We're not working on a school building because uh it's some great achievement or something we have to build. I'm thinking I think I can only think of the young people and the children and the little innocent lives. And when I think of that, I think every one of these minds that I can prevent from hearing the trash and hearing the vulgarity and hearing the cursing and hearing the evil things and and prevent their eyes from seeing the sights and their ears from hearing those words. I feel it's an honor. Amen. &gt;&gt; I feel it's actually worth our labor. &gt;&gt; I think it's worth our all of our giving. When I think of every believer and I get a book and can send that, whether it be the hub or whether it be a disc or whether it be a piece of paper, I don't care. But as long as we can get those words in front of someone else's eyes and prevent that soul from all the wounds and the trouble and the turmoil and get a flow of strength coming into them, getting a divine uh virtue coming into them. To me, that's a the most worthy that's a higher calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any soul that we can reach for the gospel. He said their high calling in life, their high calling in life was to serve God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when their hopes in this life were blighted, they were patient and committed all to him who had promised a lasting recompense in heaven for what they had given up for him on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you reading the same words? You weren't reading all the same words. I got caught up here. God's people do not only work for him in labor of love, but they suffer with him. They suffer for him with joy. &gt;&gt; They are patient in bearing the yoke. The first age suffered great persecution. It had to work hard to preach the gospel and shed forth truth. Their high calling, I hope you can just take and make that your personal message today. Their high calling. Put your name in there. My high calling w is to serve God. And when their hopes in life were blighted, and I will say that they will be blighted, they will be uh wearied, they were patient and committed all to him who had promised a lasting recompense in heaven &gt;&gt; for what they had given up for him on earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in the message believing God uh brother Brandham said God said he's speaking to Abraham come out Abraham and go into a land and he was looking for a city whose builder and maker was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now he makes this phrase. Now, if that was what we would refer to in the natural life would be, I'd say instinct. That Abraham, he perhaps had an instinct. He said, "You'd naturally call it that instinct." He said, "We call it leadings of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; So now I put those two together. Say there's a high calling, a higher calling. And I want to announce to this congregation, whether you are aware of it at this moment or not, there's an instinct, &gt;&gt; there's a leadings of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; There's an instinct within the believer &gt;&gt; to to answer to that call. &gt;&gt; We are being called, not have been called, but we are being called to a higher calling. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to refer to a number of number of areas in life where there's a higher calling. This message encompasses every area of life that I have ever encountered as far as myself. It's touched every part of my life. It touches our home. &gt;&gt; It touches how we live. It touches how we act, how we speak, how we worship, &gt;&gt; how we dress, how we conduct ourselves, our demeanor. and we have a touch with we we are touched within ourselves when we cross that border and we say that's not exactly what Christ would do but there's a faithful Holy Spirit that's speaking to the individual and telling us that we've crossed the border we we say that Lord forgive me I'm sorry for that wash me cleanse me don't you experience that &gt;&gt; do you know why it's not just a conscience but it's an instinct it's a spiritual ual instinct because if it's just conscience, you find some that can do it and they don't have any conscience about it because that's just natural instinct. That's just a natural instinct. But there's something that's much deeper than that and it's a spiritual it's called the leadings of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The believer has a has the leadings. a person that's been called by God's voice. God sends his spirit to give them leadings of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God called him out from among his people, out of a land, his own homeland, from his people. Moses, now I'm going to make some statements of different ones. I want to go down through some individuals and then into certain areas of our lives. Moses was a higher calling than Egypt. &gt;&gt; The children of Israel, the people, they were living in Egypt. They had their families in Egypt. They had children in Egypt. They had the they had life to support in Egypt. But when Moses came around, he was a higher calling. And the and the prophet said, "God called Israel out of Egypt." &gt;&gt; All these people came forth. Every one of them was delivered, crossed over the Red Sea into the wilderness, and when they got ready, listened. They listened to Moses' message and started to march. Amen. speaking of justification. And they came to the Red Sea. He said the blood and they went through the Red Sea and behind them all the task masters was laying dead. This is just about 3 days from the promised land right before them, less than 40 miles. I say that's a higher calling &gt;&gt; than making mud in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Where you are today is a higher calling than where where you folks were not very long ago. Some of you a few months ago, maybe others months or years ago or or a lifetime ago. But where you are today, I say in the authority of God's word, you have you have abided by. You have heard a higher calling. &gt;&gt; There has been something within you, an instinct, something you cannot explain. You don't even know why you said yes when you did. &gt;&gt; But there was something within you that was demanding it. There was something within you that was saying, "This is true." &gt;&gt; There was something within you that was willing to say, "I'm giving myself to this." &gt;&gt; You didn't understand that. You didn't understand what the cost would be. You didn't even understand. Perhaps some of you that have been in the way a long time, you say, "If I'd known this way back then, I wonder if I would have said yes." Yes, you would have. &gt;&gt; God knew. All right. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In three kinds of believers, he said, if you would have lived in the days of Moses, you would have believed Moses message &gt;&gt; after it had been proven after it had been proven and have vindicated by God. &gt;&gt; But would you want uh but would you have went with Kora or Dayan and them and said, "You're not the holy one. You're not the only holy one. There's other people that can do these things. H and uh and and you do it, too. But he said, you'd have to be the one uh that you are tonight. You'd have to make the choice. &gt;&gt; Would you be going with Moses or would you be going with Kora and Dayan? &gt;&gt; But you you made the choice because of the call in the message stand still. And this was here in Canada. This was preached. Not long after that, he said some 40 years the people would not receive Caleb and Joshua because under Moses' message &gt;&gt; came other ones that God was raising up. &gt;&gt; And there was a Caleb and a Joshua. And they said the right thing. &gt;&gt; They said, "Stand still. &gt;&gt; See the glory of God." &gt;&gt; He said, "They're just bread for us." &gt;&gt; While others were saying, "We're like grasshoppers." &gt;&gt; These said, "We can do it. We can go in. let's go in and take the land. Why hesitate? &gt;&gt; And they had to wait because the others uh didn't believe. And he said, we find Joshua representing grace &gt;&gt; or some propitiation. So I'm saying that Moses was a higher calling than Egypt. &gt;&gt; Now I'm saying Joshua was a higher calling than the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you agree with that? But Joshua's commission came after Moses had died. Moses, my servant, is dead. So we said, we find Joshua representing grace or some propitiation that it could not exist in the same time the law was in existence. &gt;&gt; You can't have grace and law at the same time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to be under grace. &gt;&gt; I want to be under grace. God's the initiator and the inventor of grace. &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither does any message that forwards the people on ever coincide with the past message. &gt;&gt; It will not do it." &gt;&gt; There he says that's where you have trouble today. And he says Joshua could not at all become into his ministry until after Moses was gone. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham's ministry encompassed which I will come to in a few moments. It encompassed Moses ministry. &gt;&gt; It was a delivering ministry. Brother Brandham's ministry encompassed Joshua's ministry. &gt;&gt; You understand that? Brother Brandham's ministry encompassed the ministry of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were just identical &gt;&gt; in every pattern, every way. Are you with me, friend? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to see it was a higher calling. Always a higher calling. The people could not continue under Moses' ministry of the law and get into the promised land. They needed some grace to take them into the promised land. And Jesus, I will say that Jesus, because I want to hurry along here, Jesus was the embodiment of the higher calling. &gt;&gt; There was every every characteristic of the life of Jesus. No wonder he was the perfect one. He was the masterpiece. He was the embodiment. He was the Godhead uh uh fully Godhead bodily. He He was He was everything that we long to be. &gt;&gt; It says in it it says of Jesus that that uh he was he was the masterpiece the prophet calls him. But then after Jesus was lived his life out, you'd think, well surely uh that was the highest. We can't go any higher. That's the that's the headstone. &gt;&gt; But the thing was it hadn't been conveyed to all the people. &gt;&gt; So after Jesus was here, he showed himself again to the Apostle Paul &gt;&gt; on the road to Damascus. Who art thou Lord? I'm Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whom thou persecutest? &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul comes on the scene. And I would like to say that Apostle Paul not a higher calling than Christ but higher in that he was bringing to the people what Jesus Christ was &gt;&gt; the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; So Paul was a higher calling by introducing grace over law &gt;&gt; and bringing the gospel also to the Gentiles, &gt;&gt; grace over works. And so Paul had to say these things. For by grace &gt;&gt; are you saved? &gt;&gt; Are you saved? &gt;&gt; How many are saved? &gt;&gt; You were saved by grace. &gt;&gt; By grace are you saved. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for that. &gt;&gt; Through faith &gt;&gt; and that not of yourself. &gt;&gt; In fact, as I will add, not adding to the scripture, but often in spite of yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; By grace are you saved through faith and not of yourselves. &gt;&gt; It is the gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A higher calling &gt;&gt; than works. &gt;&gt; And those who still attempt to achieve something or gain something by from God through works, you can't work it. That's why people say, "Well, as soon as I get victory over this, then I'll serve God." Forget it. &gt;&gt; It comes by grace. &gt;&gt; Are you saved through faith? You must believe it &gt;&gt; and then you'll receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a little more difficult but the scripture that Paul spoke and if by grace then it is no more of works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise grace is no more grace. &gt;&gt; But if it is of works then it is no more of grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise work is no more work. &gt;&gt; So if it's of works it's not of grace. If it's grace it's not of works. That's really the summary of that verse. If it's of grace, it's not of works. &gt;&gt; You can't mingle the two. The two won't live together. &gt;&gt; In Timothy, 2 Timothy 1:9, who hath saved us and called us &gt;&gt; with a holy calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which is given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God had this program in his mind. Long before you arrived, before your forefathers arrived, before the foundation of the world, God had a plan that he was going to give his children. He was going to receive them by grace. He was going to call them and instill in them an instinct. &gt;&gt; A six sense. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now I just want to come quickly to the messengers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can take this off please. The invisible union. in the invisible union. Brother Brandham says, "So has it been in God in his church." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Justification under Luther. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's pulling the bride out. Now &gt;&gt; he's creating his bride. &gt;&gt; Justification under Luther. I will say Luther was a higher calling than the dark ages. And I think that you wouldn't have to have much of a revelation to agree with that. It was a higher calling &gt;&gt; than the dark ages. &gt;&gt; He says, "So it has been God and his church justification under Luther, justification, sanctification under Wesley." &gt;&gt; And they they say, now I'm just repeating things that you know well, but I want to put them in a certain structure. So I say Wesley was a higher calling when Wesley came and began to speak to the people who had believed in the just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; But he's speaking of this and it's called commonly called the second work of grace &gt;&gt; because Wesley called them to holiness. &gt;&gt; He said the evolution of the spirit being given more and more. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if he says it's more and more it's it's a higher calling. &gt;&gt; It's a better it's a more needful thing because the body is building coming to the head which is Christ the body of Christ. So Luther was a higher calling than the previous age and Wesley he said is the se second work of grace. Look what he done. He said he introduced holiness to the church. And so now I think I have just laid a bit of a foundation. So I want to suggest to you and emphasize to you the high calling of God onto our message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The high calling of God. I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling. Amen. &gt;&gt; of God &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. Christ Jesus is none other than the word. It's either &gt;&gt; a Bible that's mysterious or a book that's been revealed. &gt;&gt; And I will say revelation a little ahead of myself right now, but revelation is higher than intellectual concept. &gt;&gt; I press toward the mark. So of the high calling of God &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. And the scripture says, "Surely the Lord God &gt;&gt; will do nothing." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he revealth his secret &gt;&gt; to his servants, the prophets. &gt;&gt; Amos 3:7. &gt;&gt; Surely the Lord God, I press toward the mark of the calling of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the scripture saying, "But God, this God will do nothing." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Till he reveals his secret to his servants, the prophets. &gt;&gt; So now we've got it narrowed down what the channel is. &gt;&gt; And it says in the Hebrew, and the Hebrew twists it a little bit differently. This is word for word out of the Hebrew scriptures. For not will do the Lord Jehovah a thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For not will do the Lord Jehovah a thing unless he reveals his secret counsel to his servants, the prophets. &gt;&gt; So whether it's in the Hebrew, whether it's in the English, it's simply very it's it's within everybody's grasp. God won't do anything &gt;&gt; until he reveals it to his servants, the prophets. To me, that must be the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; It'll be in the word. It will be in Christ Jesus. But he will only reveal Christ Jesus. He will only reveal these attributes. He'll only reveal this marvelous embodiment &gt;&gt; of perfection &gt;&gt; which much of it is secret. Much of it is beyond our understanding. The people didn't understand him. That's why they crucified him. He was a mystery to the people. &gt;&gt; He's still a mystery to the people. And you can't learn him. &gt;&gt; He's revealed. &gt;&gt; That's why revelation is higher than learning. Revelation is higher than some teaching. &gt;&gt; Are you in agreement with me? &gt;&gt; It's a higher calling. He'll do nothing. There's no higher. Take it back, please. There's no higher order to reveal the word than prophets. Just a moment here. Okay. Notice the very day. Is this what we have up here? Here we are. Notice the very day when his messenger not when he starts on on on not when he starts on the but when he when he begins to declare his message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The first pull healing. The second poll prophesying. The third pull opening of the word. Let me just stop there a moment. The second pull is a higher calling than the first. &gt;&gt; And the first pull is a higher calling than whatever you were in before. &gt;&gt; There had to be a first pull. &gt;&gt; And it was a great healing ministry. &gt;&gt; And I'll put it in the natural. A great healing. Healing is higher calling than sickness. &gt;&gt; Healing is a higher calling. If you're if you're here sick and afflicted today, there's a higher calling for you. And it's under this word. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is calling you to a higher perhaps it's just physical, but it's it's still part of it. &gt;&gt; If you're here and you're sick and you're afflicted, I want to bring you to the reality. There's a higher calling going out even at this moment. &gt;&gt; A higher calling for you. &gt;&gt; Which is to be well. &gt;&gt; It may not happen in instant, but it could. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just feel like staying on that. God's greater than that disease. &gt;&gt; God's greater than that affliction. &gt;&gt; We'll deal with the physical for a moment. The first pull. God's greater Hallelujah. I don't know what it may be that may be afflicting a person. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Milo. God's greater than that has been afflicting you. &gt;&gt; We've been praying for you. Are there others here who needs healing? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; God's greater. Your hand is up. Your heart is there. God's greater than that. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He's a mighty healer. He's the mighty conqueror. He raised for our justification. He He He was crucified. And by his stripes, you are healed. &gt;&gt; That's God's word. &gt;&gt; And this Bible has to be effective. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is here to make it effective. &gt;&gt; We're not here to have church. We're here to see the manifestation of God in his body, in his people, in his church. You on the internet, you're sick and afflicted. This Bible says, "I am the Lord that health thee. Rise in the name of Jesus Christ." We're called under this message. People say, "Oh, well, the first the first pull that was just back there. That was just, you know, that don't don't minimize that. There's multitudes of people in the third poll that need the first one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we want to have a church that has all three. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We don't want We don't want to say, "Oh, I'm up here in the third pole, but you haven't even got the first one, &gt;&gt; and Satan's beating you all up." &gt;&gt; I said, "Satan has no right. &gt;&gt; He has no right to this body, this vessel of God. Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; I want to thrust him out. I want to see him defeated. Brother Nathan, the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We're not preaching just because uh we want to pass air out of our mouth and say words. Not a bit. We're preaching because this is the truth &gt;&gt; of God's word. &gt;&gt; And then he receives glory. &gt;&gt; Let the Lord Jesus be glorified. Glory to God. Lord, &gt;&gt; may we hear testimony &gt;&gt; of the marvelous healing power of God. &gt;&gt; Sister Aaness, mother still struggling with those cancer cells. And we speak in the name of Jesus Christ. May those cancer cells die. &gt;&gt; We don't care whether it's in this building or in China. &gt;&gt; Let those cancer cells die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've been praying for Sister Karen's brother, Lyall Thicken, in the name of Jesus. May God be glorified. May faith come to his heart. Hallelujah. Under this message, the first pull came with healing in his wings. &gt;&gt; Let's never forget that. &gt;&gt; Let's not let Satan beat you up. You might be feeling just wonderful today, but you might be in some affliction tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And in this age, such a tormenting age, the emotional &gt;&gt; age of men and women's minds under such pressure. They're right on the edge of collapse. And they're right on the edge of coming apart and all these things. Let this not be a part of the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; There's more strength There's more healing. &gt;&gt; There's more power. &gt;&gt; There's more deliverance. Hallelujah. God can strengthen the human mind and that whole emotional realm. You don't have to feel on the edge. &gt;&gt; I'd sooner have you go out of this place today feeling and knowing in your inner man, in your soul. I'm the conqueror &gt;&gt; through Jesus Christ, my Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a higher calling. &gt;&gt; And the second pull, revealing the secret of the heart. &gt;&gt; You weren't expecting this perhaps when I started out. You might not have thought it was going to come so direct. But the same Holy Spirit, for it's the word of God that's quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the the dividing of soul and spirit. The same God who heals a body knows what your soul and your spirit needs. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your conscience, you got a guilty conscience. May God cleanse that conscience. By the power of the Holy Ghost, your memory, you got bad memories. In the name of Jesus Christ, we speak to those memories. The Holy Ghost is here to purge out that channel. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let it flow. &gt;&gt; Let it come. Say yes now. Yes, God. &gt;&gt; Come, oh God. Let the Holy Spirit cleanse that channel, &gt;&gt; that memories, &gt;&gt; let it be gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That imagination, &gt;&gt; that conscience, &gt;&gt; that affection, some ill affection in the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; may Satan be smitten &gt;&gt; in that reasoning. Oh, we can reason all kind. Your reasoning won't get you any place. There's multitudes of atheists and agnostics &gt;&gt; and doubters that are laying in the graves today &gt;&gt; with the earthworms of the worms have destroyed their body. Where did their reasoning get them? Nowhere. &gt;&gt; Revelation &gt;&gt; is higher &gt;&gt; than reasoning. &gt;&gt; This message came. &gt;&gt; It can only be It cannot be imagined. It cannot be reasoned. &gt;&gt; It can't be learned. If you can only learn it, someone can unlearn it for you. &gt;&gt; It's something in fact is when God sends something he says this can only be revealed. You can only get this by revelation. &gt;&gt; Then he's not going to hold revelation back from you. &gt;&gt; He's going to give you the revelation. &gt;&gt; So I am saying revelation is part and parcel of the call. &gt;&gt; I called you. I'll reveal it to you. &gt;&gt; Just rejoice in that. &gt;&gt; Say, "Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're going to reveal it to me. &gt;&gt; If it's not today, maybe tomorrow, but you're going to reveal it. &gt;&gt; I don't understand it, but you're going to cause me to understand it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The third pull, &gt;&gt; the opening of the word, the mysteries revealed. I want to get this. There's no more higher order &gt;&gt; to reveal the word than prophets. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I will do nothing. &gt;&gt; Your Bible school will never discover it. Your church and all the men with their robes and their collars and whatever more this suit or anybody's suit, it's not going to reveal it to them. &gt;&gt; The highest order. There's no higher order. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're under the highest order? &gt;&gt; We're not talking about a government. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about politics. &gt;&gt; We're not talking even about some religious order. &gt;&gt; You're under a prophet order. &gt;&gt; And there is no higher order &gt;&gt; than a prophet. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And I'm not talking about some prophet that just has multitudes of people. I'm talking about a proven, vindicated prophet &gt;&gt; that would stand on the platform before thousands of people and say if he doesn't come now and confirm what I've spoken the truth, I am a false prophet. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of prophet. There's no higher order than thus saith the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Until this last age, the people under their messenger, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; will be &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; the final voice &gt;&gt; to the final age. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then God sent Wesley and he was a voice with the word in his day. &gt;&gt; The people who looked uh who took his revelation from God became the living epistles read and known of all men &gt;&gt; for their generation. We weren't back there. But when the Methodists failed, God raised up others. And so it has gone on through the years until &gt;&gt; say the word until. &gt;&gt; In the last day, &gt;&gt; there is again another people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's again another people &gt;&gt; in the land &gt;&gt; who under their messenger &gt;&gt; will be the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; We're not here to be silent. Your life speaks. &gt;&gt; How we live and conduct ourselves speaks. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't mind if I say some anything. &gt;&gt; Anything. &gt;&gt; Clothing. Being clothed &gt;&gt; in a godly manner &gt;&gt; is a higher calling than nakedness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our little girls are going to school in short shorts. &gt;&gt; Clothing &gt;&gt; is a high order. &gt;&gt; A prophet of God has said &gt;&gt; they cause men to lust after them. They will stand before God as a prostitute. &gt;&gt; And in the prayer, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; lead us not into temptation. That's exactly what he's trying to do. &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, God, we don't preach a clothesline gospel." Jesus did. &gt;&gt; Women were dressed like women. &gt;&gt; Men dressed like men. &gt;&gt; You'd be surprised. We have people that are not even converted drive by here, come into this church, and say, "I see your children the way they're dressed." &gt;&gt; Why? Because it spoke a message to them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One of those men was Brother Phil Girtson's dad &gt;&gt; came here and says, "What kind of church?" Timothy's dad. &gt;&gt; You boys stand up. &gt;&gt; And brother Phil Girtson's now is one of the senior teachers &gt;&gt; in this school. &gt;&gt; That's how your father came to be uh amazed. How are these children dressed? &gt;&gt; Why did he see that? because he knew it was a higher calling. &gt;&gt; Than the nakedness that's in the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You young men, &gt;&gt; you young ladies, you hear the words that come out of the mouths of people. How thankful I am to God. It's not something some constraint that you put on it. It's a life that's in you &gt;&gt; and you don't have any desire for that. Why? Because you come under a message that's a higher calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. You heard another voice &gt;&gt; when it spoke to you and said, "Go to the water &gt;&gt; and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; 110 in one place in the last two weeks and 70 in another place and 16 in another place. I thank God. &gt;&gt; I thank God that even from this assembly, we've been able to send out men with the gospel under their messenger &gt;&gt; and people have heard the voice. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Oh, that's just a few people. One and three, one, one and a quarter billion people in China." You ought to know it. I just tell you, and this is on the internet. The authorities know about us. &gt;&gt; And they had a concern, &gt;&gt; naturally. They have a concern those because they're afraid it'll go like a prairie fire. &gt;&gt; And it will. &gt;&gt; But it only goes to the elect. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; How can you tell us as believers? &gt;&gt; How can Satan even put it in our minds? Well, just relax and be easy about it when we're out trying to get the last ones in. &gt;&gt; They might be in Seattle. They might be in London. They might be in Tacoma. They might be in Beijing. We don't care where they are. &gt;&gt; We got a commission to go and find them. &gt;&gt; We say, "God bless brother Ivan. Maybe he'll find it. God bless brother Murphy. Maybe he'll find it. Maybe brother Timothy, maybe brother Dioa. I don't care who finds it. And if we can give them some help, &gt;&gt; if we can give them prayer, &gt;&gt; if we can give them some resource or some encouragement, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; God is guiding your footsteps and guide you to connect with somebody that needs you at that time. &gt;&gt; You that are here and those of you that felt led of God to move in, we needed you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God needed you. &gt;&gt; I needed you. The people needed you. &gt;&gt; Brother Kim, we needed you. &gt;&gt; Brother Ernie, we need you. &gt;&gt; We need men. Congregation. We need you. &gt;&gt; You may be sitting there never even saying uh uh you know demonstrative or saying an amen or up off your seat. That's fine. We need that strength. &gt;&gt; We need that resource. &gt;&gt; We need that brotherhood. &gt;&gt; You sisters, we need that godly Sisters, we need you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God leads you here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Brother Jean, Sister Sephora felt led of God bring their family here under a lot of pressure, a lot of strain, but we needed you. I say that not because there's anything in my mind specifically. You may think we've done a lot for you, but God needed you. The body of Christ needed you. you that are out there on uh on the internet and you write letters and send sometime before I leave this church I have one or two emails already. Oh, how the message spoke to me. I know the other brothers have it as well. How the word spoke to me. I needed it. Not only that, we need them. &gt;&gt; We need your prayer. We need your We need your giving. We need your resource. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Not giving financially, but giving of yourself. You brothers that have been giving of your time, you young men, you sisters out there, I tell you what, we take we take unconverted men there are contractors and they see what has happened and they're absolutely dumbfounded. &gt;&gt; They're brought to speechlessness. &gt;&gt; They can't believe that the people were able to construct that place. &gt;&gt; Hey, and we have contractors and they said we couldn't do it in 12 months. We couldn't do in 12 months what you've done in 11. &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because as it was in the scripture, God put a spirit, a willing spirit upon the people and they gave themselves. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, this is just a building." Exactly. But you know what they're going to hear in that building? They're going to hear the name of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're going to see things that are and and and we're we're preventing them. We're closing off their vision from the world and the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Yes, they'll come in contact with it, but we want them to be strong. Why are you here? So that the ministry can preach the word and you can absorb that word. You can yield to the spirit of the word. &gt;&gt; I can only I can only say the words. The Holy Ghost has to come in behind it &gt;&gt; and and and and and anchor it in your heart. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; You take that off now. As Moses was given two signs, &gt;&gt; prophet said, as Moses was given two signs to vindicate his ministry, so will you be given two signs &gt;&gt; under under their messenger. Amen. &gt;&gt; Will be the final voice. &gt;&gt; Our messenger was given the two signs as Moses was given. &gt;&gt; You can say that people talk the Mormons talk about Joseph Smith and the Muhammad uh Islam has Muhammad as as their prophet waiting for him to come back. Uh there isn't any of those men that said thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is according to the scripture. None of them came and said, "Be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; A true prophet came. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was vindicated &gt;&gt; with two signs. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you'll be given two signs. And by these two signs, And by these two signs, listen to this friends. &gt;&gt; And by these two signs that people will believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "And I believe it's the same angel of the covenant." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he told me, he said, "As Moses was given two signs to vindicate his ministry, so you'll be given two signs." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And by these signs, &gt;&gt; the people will believe. And there it is. &gt;&gt; I believe it's the same angel of the covenant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Says it twice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I stand as Joshua. &gt;&gt; Amen. We I said Joshua had a higher was a higher order or a higher calling. &gt;&gt; God called the people under Joshua to a higher calling. &gt;&gt; And don't forget friends, when people failed to hear or put sufficient emphasis on what their messenger was saying, they were not they did not benefit. Amen. &gt;&gt; They did not receive the benefits that God had for them. &gt;&gt; And he and the and the prophet said, "Oh God, I pray now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I stand as Joshua in the valley &gt;&gt; and say, "The land is good." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're under that messenger. &gt;&gt; The land is good. The land is your life &gt;&gt; in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your messenger said your life in the Holy Ghost is good. &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that? It's good. &gt;&gt; Don't live some second rate life. &gt;&gt; Call the devil a liar. &gt;&gt; Your life in the Holy Ghost is good. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you friends, I'm on the war path. I'm against the enemy &gt;&gt; that tries to afflict you &gt;&gt; when you've left here. Tries to take away from your from your victory and your joy and your peace. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray now I stand as Joshua in the valley. &gt;&gt; Amen. The land is good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're going over after it. &gt;&gt; Lord, here we come in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I cast out the spirit of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And ask that there won't be a feeble one left &gt;&gt; for God's glory. &gt;&gt; That prayer wasn't just then. That prayer is just as effective today &gt;&gt; because we are agreeing with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; He tried to bring us to misery if he can. &gt;&gt; Not only not only adults, &gt;&gt; young people, &gt;&gt; listen to me, friend. Just on the news a few days ago, the grand chief of one of the native tribes of Canada was on national radio pleading for some help. because they had about three suicides in a few days and they were 15 years old because it's hopeless. &gt;&gt; They don't see any I'm talking to you young people. It seems hopeless. There doesn't seem to be a future for them. Oh, how they need this gospel. &gt;&gt; How they need to hear what you're hearing. &gt;&gt; The devil speaks. He He doesn't, you know, just say, "Well, I'll only start speaking to them after they're 10 years old." They speak to you when you're five and when you're eight and when you're 10 and when you're 12, when you're in your in your teens, and it just intensifies. And I'm teaching you here today, say no to him. &gt;&gt; Say, "My mind is closed to you &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus." &gt;&gt; You need to say it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said it on the platform. I said, "Satan, I resist you. &gt;&gt; I resist you. &gt;&gt; You're my enemy. &gt;&gt; You're the enemy of these people. &gt;&gt; The scripture says to resist the devil." &gt;&gt; And conjunction word, he will flee from you. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, the devil this and the devil that and the devil that." Get above that. I'm telling you under the message of your messenger, there's a higher calling. &gt;&gt; There's a higher calling. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So, the last messenger I've got to quick write close now because we have a service this evening. Brother Tom is going to be ministering. We want to give time for that. give time for you to be able to get home and or get out and have a little refreshment. But the last church age messenger and his message, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; is a higher calling than anything that preceded it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Dear friends, &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters in Christ, &gt;&gt; bloodbought bride of Jesus Christ, you have been called under the highest calling. Your president, your prime minister, your governor, your representative cannot call you to this. You have been called by God &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus revealed &gt;&gt; under a vindicated messenger &gt;&gt; proven that could speak. Thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't turn from that. Turning from that, now you come into a state of hopelessness. &gt;&gt; Satan would like you to forget &gt;&gt; these words. Don't forget this message. &gt;&gt; Receiving a word, receiving the word for healing, I must go quickly. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said is a higher order. He said the American people are taught that you lay hands on them and I guess you'll just have to do that. That's all I know. I'm trying to get you to believe. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get you to believe &gt;&gt; on believe it on a higher order to accept it without laying on of hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just believe it and walk away. There's a higher order. &gt;&gt; Believe the word. &gt;&gt; Believe this word. &gt;&gt; And you can walk away. &gt;&gt; It's done. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Revelation is a higher calling &gt;&gt; than intellectual learning. What's happening future home? Oh, he said to make known his prophets, all his manifestation because it's his attributes of his thoughts expressed now. And here it is in this little woman. He's talking about the little woman at the well. She was one of his attributes. &gt;&gt; And there was a priest &gt;&gt; representing the light. There's a priest representing the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had learned it from the Bible. &gt;&gt; He had learned that God was God. &gt;&gt; He had learned that holiness was right. &gt;&gt; And he was learned that there was a law of God. He learned it because his intellectual conception. Don't sit here and just learn these things. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Holy Spirit, I hear it. I understand it. But I need it to be quickened." &gt;&gt; Come and make it alive. &gt;&gt; You can argue a person out of something they learned. &gt;&gt; You cannot argue it out of them once it's been revealed. &gt;&gt; Once it's revealed, &gt;&gt; you'll never get it taught out of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do I believe in the prophet? Cuz the Bible speaks of it. &gt;&gt; Malachi speaks of it. &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke of it. &gt;&gt; Isaiah spoke of it. We see it and we believe it because it's it's a prophecy in the scripture. &gt;&gt; And it told what he would do. And then one rises on the scene in that season and does those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he was born of the right lineage. He was a Levite and he only knowed it by intellectual conception. And when the light of the hour, see, he learned it by what had happened, not what was happening. &gt;&gt; One thing I'm thankful for in this church, friends, we don't come to church because of something that has happened, &gt;&gt; but we are here because it is happening. And when he found what was happening, his denomination said nothing about it. Therefore, he had no representation of it. &gt;&gt; But there was a redeemer on earth at that time to redeem those attributes of God. &gt;&gt; And she received it. &gt;&gt; How thankful we ought to be. &gt;&gt; How thankful we should be that church the country is filled with churches. They're not preaching that they are the final voice to the final age. They're not preaching to the people and telling them, "You're under the messenger, vindicated, proven messenger." The third exodus is a higher calling than the first or the second. &gt;&gt; The change of this body is higher than the physical body you have right now. Hello folks. You got dressed today, refreshed yourself and came to church. The change of this body, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; is a higher calling &gt;&gt; than the body that was formed in your mother's womb. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We look at these children. We look at these infants that are born and and Sharon and Marco have received their family all at once. But I look at those little fingers and look at a toe about 316 of an inch long. You just can't believe all those bones are in there. &gt;&gt; It almost takes a revelation myself to believe. And I look at that, look at the little creatures and think and look at that little ankle and foot. Can't believe all these bones are in the foot. And then, you know, we're smart people. See, where'd it come from? Where did all those bones come from? How come this child knows just exactly, you know, when to breathe and when to and do all these things? Just a miracle. The change the change of your body is more important than the body you're sitting in today. &gt;&gt; This body will age. &gt;&gt; That one will re will will annihilate aging. &gt;&gt; This body gets sick and weary. That body never will have that. &gt;&gt; This mind is subject to deterioration or depression or whatever more. That body knows nothing about it. The people called of God under this age under this message are promised that body. &gt;&gt; In fact is it is the spoken word that will change this body. &gt;&gt; When a man or woman hears the word of the hour and says, "I don't believe it." &gt;&gt; You know what they've just done? They've just put a big X across the chains of their body. Right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, well, no, you know, we don't want to don't become a bleeding heart now. We'll stay with the word of God &gt;&gt; because that's unbelief." &gt;&gt; And no unbelieving &gt;&gt; man or woman can enter into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; You have to be a believing person &gt;&gt; and believe on him whom God hath sent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Is this congregation believing congregation? You're believing this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember this. Remember this that God cannot change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the unchangeable God. &gt;&gt; Times change. &gt;&gt; People change. &gt;&gt; God is infinite. He cannot change. He must remain the same yesterday, today &gt;&gt; and forever. &gt;&gt; He must always remain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now here I have underlined. Now you see here how his message comes because he doesn't change &gt;&gt; how his message comes. How he sends his message. &gt;&gt; Number one, how his message comes. &gt;&gt; How he sends his message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can't change that. He's always done it. &gt;&gt; He will always remain the same. That's the way he always does it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And remember, when does he do it? Just before the destructions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just at the end of the age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's when he sends his message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when he sends his message. Listen folks, &gt;&gt; to call &gt;&gt; out &gt;&gt; his people. Yeah. &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, this messenger came. &gt;&gt; He came and had this great ministry, etc., etc. I could stop at every junction." I say, "Well, there was a whirlwind in a tree." And that is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. I sat with a woman that was actually a close friend, brother Brandham's before he was married. He called her his girlfriend. I asked him, "Did you know he was a prophet?" She said, "No." She didn't know what that meant. I said, she said he and she opened up her purse and took out a picture of him, the one with the bandana around his neck. It was signed by him. She looked at the picture, looked over my head, and said, "I still love him." I thought, "You said the right thing." I said, "What did he did he ever speak to you?" Yes. She said, "He told me that he would hear a voice in the tree in the trees." And here in the message, you can find it. He's a boy, eight years old, I believe, carrying water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz his father was a bootleger and he carried water to his father's still. Think of it. that had God wasn't God wasn't concerned or bothered about that where he's carrying water and he hears the voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't ever smoke or drink or defile your body in any way. For when you get older, I have a work for you to do. &gt;&gt; You know what that was for? For you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God spoke that for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he was establishing from childhood &gt;&gt; a messenger that would be worthy of the message he was going to carry for you &gt;&gt; that he could come and finally say and they will call out the message to the messenger always came at the end of the age before destruction. &gt;&gt; He's preserving you from destruction. &gt;&gt; Sending a message. Believe it friends &gt;&gt; to call you &gt;&gt; and there will be a people &gt;&gt; so that you under that messenger &gt;&gt; then become the last voice &gt;&gt; final voice &gt;&gt; to the final age &gt;&gt; I don't care who you are when you go out of this service today and and go to your place of duty tomorrow or wherever you are you're walking around into the shopping center wherever your voice &gt;&gt; I want you to remember what brother Bisco says today the final voice &gt;&gt; to the final age &gt;&gt; hallelujah Amen. Peace is a higher calling than distress. Unity is a higher calling than division. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There should have been a lot of amens out of that. &gt;&gt; Unity doesn't come along just by a natural sequence of events. It comes by prayer and labor. &gt;&gt; Amen. faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And unity is not union and unity is not compromise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to think about that. I've needed to think about it. You &gt;&gt; unity is not compromised. &gt;&gt; Unity is something when the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; begins to work in the hearts of men and women. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Family members. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it was President Bush and those are that are not his friends or and I don't take any position there. But those who were not his friends kind of mock his statement and it's amazing that it statement was made in this in this age at this time and they apparently I think his father even swed the seeds of it that this was a they were like initiating or inaugurating a new age. This is the new age and it became a phrase that is spoken all over the new age. New world order &gt;&gt; was the phrase. What they didn't realize is that God intercepted their national politics &gt;&gt; with the highest order of his word. &gt;&gt; There's none higher &gt;&gt; than a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; Not just a prophet. All kinds of people claim prophets. Not someone claiming to be a prophet. I'm talking vindicated, &gt;&gt; proven &gt;&gt; by signs and wonders and by especially the unfolding. &gt;&gt; We have all kinds of prophets, but un unfortunately or perhaps fortunately in their mouth this isn't revealed. &gt;&gt; Just think about it. &gt;&gt; You can put a tape on or hear a voice or read a message book. I' I've sometime have it playing in my car and I'm driving down the freeway and cars are zooming every direction and I just feel like the most &gt;&gt; privileged guy on the planet. &gt;&gt; I just listen to that. I say, "Look at all these folks going. They're all wound up." And here I am listening &gt;&gt; to a vindicated messenger &gt;&gt; and before I get from point A to point B, something in this opens up again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and I my spirit is quickened, my soul is quickened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And just to know, you've been called &gt;&gt; to hear it. &gt;&gt; You've been given the understanding of it. &gt;&gt; You're not learning it. The Holy Spirit is with you in your car, in your bedroom, in your easy chair in the front room revealing it to you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Revealing doesn't come with under a lot of tension or got. No, you just sit there and let God do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Try it out, folks. &gt;&gt; It works. &gt;&gt; It actually works. I'm so thrilled and happy about it. I'm just here about them. Earthbound Earthbound creatures were not that. And I'd like you to just maybe go home and you can add this list would have gotten so long that God has called you. There isn't anything in the message. There isn't anything that you confront. There isn't anything that number one. Number one, God has God has when he called you, he called you to a higher calling than anything that you confront. &gt;&gt; Then he also in that calling, he gives you the wherewithal to obtain it. &gt;&gt; Friends, I don't care what it is. I've really cons I've really thought these things over and I I I'm just looking at my notes here because there were so many other things that that God was impressing me that I wanted to convey to you, but you will do it yourself. You're going to confront something. As soon as you run into a snag, I want to see this congregation stronger and more victorious. Amen. And soon as you run into a pressure, you think you're not going to run into pressure. You'll be in pressure this next week. You'll be in some kind of pressure. When it comes, I want you to say, "I've been called &gt;&gt; to a higher calling than this pressure. &gt;&gt; I have a substance. I can't even name it. I have an essence. I have a power within myself that's greater than this pressure." &gt;&gt; A sickness strikes you and you say, "I don't feel good today." You say, "I've been called to a higher calling than this sickness. I don't care what it is. I don't care what kind of disease it is, what kind of infirmity it is." Friends, I want to see this congregation rise on your own. Believe the word that's been spoken. You don't even need to be prayed for. You say, "Brother Ed, I believe that." &gt;&gt; And you may not need it at this moment, but you might need it five minutes from now. Amen. &gt;&gt; I drove down the highway yesterday and came on right on a bad accident. There's one car over on its roof right on the main intersection of 40th and 176 just getting ready to turn. Ambulance there, fire engine there, about four or five police cars there. Had one fellow out. I think they had them laid out in the ditch and the car was on its roof. Another car was all smashed up. That's the intersection. I always have to come to church on. I've always told my wife, I said, she said, "When are they going to put a light here?" I said, "After a few people get killed." That was about two days ago. And here I don't know whether the man got killed or or what happened and don't know anything about the occupants. But every time I see that, I say somebody's plans drastically changed. this man, this woman, this people, these children were just on their way. Everything changed. &gt;&gt; It's when something I don't believe in just calling on God in an hour of disaster. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't want to get right with God or get on good talking terms. Leave this church and don't leave this church till you're on good talking terms. So that when something comes and it will come, &gt;&gt; then you'll be able to say, "Father, &gt;&gt; father, here I am. &gt;&gt; I'm your son." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've just heard a minister. I've just heard our pastor. I've just heard the preaching of the word that and that that not merely encouraged me, but instilled within my soul &gt;&gt; a higher calling. &gt;&gt; And you've called me to something higher than this. And the essence of it is found in that message. &gt;&gt; And I read it. Listen, when you read it, it's not it's not just for learning. &gt;&gt; It's for revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've got to close, but I have to say this. The reason why he brings it to you is because you have representation. Brother Brandham said the priest was had no representation. &gt;&gt; She had representation. And that's why you can speak and make a claim. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm here because I'm a part of a family. I never had to join the family. You don't have to join the family. You don't have to join the church. You don't have to join the bride. You've been born and and and you were ordained to it before the foundation of the world. You were ordained to it. &gt;&gt; And God knew everything you're going to face. &gt;&gt; And he sent a word so that you could live higher than above. higher and above that which you're confronted with. &gt;&gt; God did not intend, listen to me, did not intend for us to succumb &gt;&gt; and to bend down &gt;&gt; and to be bowed over &gt;&gt; and to become impotent &gt;&gt; and to become unhappy and to become restricted &gt;&gt; and to become all all twisted up in our nature. That is not the life of a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to claim it right now while you're sitting here. &gt;&gt; Something is coming in your mind. Something is coming in your memory that you've had. You've had something you've been wrestling with. Say, "I want deliverance from that before I leave this church." &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you people, I'm not preaching. I'm telling you, you have a right to it. &gt;&gt; Jesus died for it. He sent all of his apostles to preach it. He sent his messengers to restore it. And in the last one, before destruction comes, &gt;&gt; and it will, &gt;&gt; friends, I'm trying to I'm closing right now, &gt;&gt; but it will. &gt;&gt; I think I'm a serious thinking person. I don't think that North America can survive what she's going through right now. People saying when the squeeze comes, believe me, the squeeze is on. Amen. &gt;&gt; The hurricanes, &gt;&gt; the tornadoes, &gt;&gt; the storms, &gt;&gt; the economy in Europe and in North America, the United States, and they say, "Well, how will they ever survive?" They just right now, and they're even said so, print more money. How are we going to pay off these debts? How is Canada going to pay off its debts? How are they how are they going to pay off in the US 14 trillion dollars? How are they going to pay it off? Even the interest is hundreds of millions of dollars in just a short period per per month. I think how are you going to continue to support all of this? Your messenger and you are one that have come up onto the message said about 40 years ago &gt;&gt; they're broke &gt;&gt; and their grandchildren and you are the grandchildren &gt;&gt; will be paying off the debt &gt;&gt; attempting to pay off the debt. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen friends. &gt;&gt; And where do these storms and where does all this come from? God knows these storms and and earthquakes. One here on a few days ago, a couple days ago on Vancouver Island and and and something something really startled me because I heard about three or four people on the phone and they were from different places reporting and you know what they said? They said the ground began to shake and we became instantly sick. and someone said it and they're way up here and someone else maybe 100 miles away or 200 miles away and saying the same thing and I was standing out and everything began to tremble and I became sick. A man was saying it. A woman was saying it and they're all in different places. I've never heard that before. I've heard of people being in big earthquakes. Never heard of anything. You know, this was 6.4 25 miles down to earth. A good shake. this this country. We may have a we may have a super one. &gt;&gt; All the scientists say so. &gt;&gt; Just don't sit in this church and find yourself having to call on God in that moment. &gt;&gt; Say, "I made it right ahead of time. &gt;&gt; I listen to the word." &gt;&gt; And I want to say something to you. The son and daughter of God is greater than bullets, &gt;&gt; greater than earthquakes, &gt;&gt; greater than storm. &gt;&gt; Atomic bomb could land on your house &gt;&gt; and you'd still be safe &gt;&gt; as a child of God &gt;&gt; or go immediately into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; God's greater. &gt;&gt; Why? Because his children &gt;&gt; are called to a higher calling. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet, shall we? &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we have rejoiced. &gt;&gt; Lord, as I spoke these things that are a reality to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray, oh God, it'll be a reality to the people. &gt;&gt; I pray that they will be so energized. and as I have some refreshment and come back to the house of God, be here for our first evening service. Lord, as we're coming to this uh uh this season of the year and we're having a Sunday evening service, oh God, this is the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; This is not just a time we're here to preach and and have a little service. This is the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; May the people talk about the wondrous things that you have done. And I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll bless the word to the people now. Father, I pray that they will take it in. They will breathe it within their inner being. &gt;&gt; And may it be a reality to them &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to sing when we all get to heaven. &gt;&gt; You have to sing it. I hope it's not that new to you, &gt;&gt; but I have been singing this. The service is not over. So just remain here, please. All right. When we all get to heaven, get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be. And when we hold Jesus, we'll sing and shout the victory and sing the wonder of Jesus. his mercy and his in the bright together and we all see and shout. And while we on the field we all And when we all see Jesus, we sing and shout equally. Let us then be true and faithful. The same serving every day. Just one of him in glory will be all the day. And we all see Jesus. We'll sing and shout the victory. One word to the right before us to be willing to open. We shall receive and we all see Jesus will sing and shout. I have to give you just one more. I just can't let you go without giving you one more. Hardships are a higher calling &gt;&gt; than a life without them. &gt;&gt; The trial of your faith being much more precious, higher order, &gt;&gt; than that of gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know what I was going to do? I was going to go down to a currency exchange and get a a block of gold, but I couldn't quite afford it. But I thought I'd like to get it up here and put it on the platform. And I just know that there'd be glistening eyes, man, if I could just get that and take it home. Well, you got something more precious than that. And you're going to go home with it. And it might be a trial. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's more precious. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; You already got it, folks. &gt;&gt; You got a whole brick of gold in your pocket. &gt;&gt; You go home with it. &gt;&gt; It's more precious than gold. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask Brother John Andy to come and ask God's blessing upon you. We're dismissed. Heavenly Father, what words, Lord, we've been hearing from your heart, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, how you must love your people and how you must desire us to come into a secret place with you, God, of oneness. As we are just in prayer before the service at our home this morning, we didn't want just a gathering of people, just another service, just another church meeting. We wanted you to come and speak to us, Lord. That was the hunger. That was the thirst. God, we can say at the end of this service, you have met our hearts cry. You have given us food, Lord. You've given us a word in due season. You've prophesied into our hearts what we have need of, God. You've given us wings to fly. You've given us healing for our bodies. Given us deliverance for our souls, given us answers to questions. You've discerned our very thoughts, Lord. And we want to say thank you, Jesus. We're not beggars. We're not children. We're sons and daughters crying abba father groaning for that new body in that other place. Oh Jesus on this 911 we thank you for your amazing grace the leadership of the Holy Ghost that saw each one of us and provided a way out of this chaos of this world that we're not looking back but we're remembering and seeing what you have right here among us. present word, present food, your shakina glory, your presence is among us. And how we desire to live in that even today, God, that every seed and every believer would receive the full benefits of the word that we've been hearing. God, take us all the way into that shikina glory place, into that faith realm where all things are possible. God, let us receive what you have for us. Lord, even this afternoon, God, our first evening service. But Lord, let us be an assembly that does not just gab and talk and gossip or talk about our frivolous things of life. But let us learn to come aside and labor in your spirit and refresh our hearts, God, in our bodies because there's a word tonight for us, Lord. There's a season as you walked with Adam and Eve in the cool of the evening when so many is caught up in frolic and loose living that we can come back again and hear from your heart, God. Words that are prepared for our lives as we so desperately need in this hour, God. And we hold on to them with everything that's within us, Lord. And a greater sincerity and sobriety, God. The screams of death are all around us down the streets of Leoda. Young people and older ones, they are without hope and despair. But you've given us a Passover lamb. And you've given us a message, God, that we can eat it in quietness, Lord. And under the sound of your presence of the pillar of fire, God, just as fresh as it ever was. &gt;&gt; Refresh our pastor, God. We thank you for the gift within his life. We believe one day, God, soon that we'll be on the other side gathered under this banner with our pastor and the ministry that you have led us into our new bodies. We will not be ashamed then and we're not ashamed now. &gt;&gt; And the ministry you've given us, God, this great banner that we can be free, God, of our burdens and our cares and hear from your heart, God. We don't take it lightly. So be with our brother Tom this afternoon, Lord. Lord, give him a word in due season, God, as we cradle these gifts, Lord, for ourselves and our families, that you would speak thus sayaeth the Lord, in 2011, God, that we would be able to go out and say, "I've heard from God. I've been in your presence, Lord, and you've spoken to our lives, and you answered the cry of our hearts." Go with every life now. go with every individual that's heard your message this morning, those on the internet, those that are on the phone, hookup, even those that are among us. God, I just pray that every need would be met as we go this afternoon, Jesus, shouting, "Hallelujah and thank you, Jesus. Praise the Lord." And we cover it with our praise and our prayers, God. Go with us now, Jesus. Sink it deep into our daily lives. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. We're sending you with God's blessings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we'll see you this evening. Greet one another. Let the word be uh established in your heart. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. Turn away. Mhm.
