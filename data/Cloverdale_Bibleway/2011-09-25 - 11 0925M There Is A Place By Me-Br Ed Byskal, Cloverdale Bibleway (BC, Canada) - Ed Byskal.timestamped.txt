[12:06] Ask brother Matthew or deal to come and
[12:08] open the service in a word of prayer.
[12:11] Couple of prayer requests need to make
[12:14] the church aware of this morning. Sister
[12:16] Norine Stewart has passed away Friday
[12:18] evening in Edmonton. Desire to remember
[12:20] the family in prayer there and the
[12:23] saints.
[12:25] Brother Ernie Villa Noeva was been very
[12:28] sick since last night asking that the
[12:31] church would pray for him. Sister
[12:33] Shannon Smounts has asked that we pray
[12:35] for a friend named Gina. She has a
[12:37] growth and possibly cancerous that will
[12:39] be removed on Wednesday for analysis.
[12:42] She's very scared. Her son is three and
[12:44] a half years old and she worries that he
[12:47] could lose his mom.
[12:49] Sister Shannon told her about the
[12:51] prophet and of God's healing.
[12:53] Please pray certainly for her salvation
[12:56] and healing and peace to her soul and to
[12:58] her spirit. We want to remember that
[13:01] need this morning. If you'd have a need
[13:02] upon your heart this morning as we go to
[13:04] prayer, just have faith in God and reach
[13:08] out and touch the hem of his garment.
[13:10] Amen. God bless you this morning.
[13:14] [Music]
[13:19] how we love you this morning, Lord.
[13:22] Father, we just love your presence, oh
[13:24] God.
[13:26] Lord, we're desiring your leadership,
[13:28] Lord Jesus.
[13:30] Lord, where would we be, Father, if we
[13:32] didn't have one, Father, that we had
[13:33] confidence in that was leading us each
[13:37] step of the way, oh God?
[13:40] Oh, Father, we're so thankful to be
[13:42] called the wife of Jesus Christ this
[13:43] morning.
[13:46] Hallelujah, Lord. Hallelujah, Lord. How
[13:49] we love you this morning, Father.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; For your grace, Lord Jesus. Oh Lord,
[13:55] where would we be, oh God?
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Oh God, you've directed us each step of
[14:01] the way, Lord Jesus.
[14:04] Father, where we would fall and make a
[14:05] mistake, Lord, you're there quickly to
[14:07] pick us up, oh God, by a word, oh God,
[14:10] that would come forth, Lord,
[14:13] Lord, and deliver us, Father. Lord, we'd
[14:16] ask that you'd forgive us this morning,
[14:18] Lord, of our Lord, our failings, Lord,
[14:21] of our sin, oh God. Lord, we just want
[14:23] to be washed, oh God. Lord, we want to
[14:26] be clean before you this morning, Lord
[14:28] Jesus.
[14:30] Lord, and before we would ask, Father,
[14:31] we just want to thank you, Lord,
[14:34] we want to come before you this morning,
[14:36] Lord, and worship the King of Kings, oh
[14:39] God.
[14:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord, you're
[14:43] worthy of our praise, Lord Jesus.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelu, hallelujah. We want to worship
[14:50] you, oh God,
[14:52] the great King of Kings who died on a
[14:54] cross for our sins, Lord Jesus. But
[14:58] you're with us here this morning, Lord.
[14:59] In our hearts, Lord. We've come
[15:01] together, Lord. Our licks of fire have
[15:02] come together, Lord. Expecting you to do
[15:05] great things in our midst, oh God.
[15:08] Lord, it might be not something big that
[15:10] we see, Lord, but it might be a silent
[15:12] movement in someone's heart, oh God.
[15:14] What greater work could there be, oh
[15:16] God, than that, Father? Oh God, there's
[15:18] requests here for healing, Lord, for
[15:21] ones who have lost loved ones, Father.
[15:24] Lord, but the greatest Lord is that
[15:26] souls, Father, would be saved for your
[15:28] kingdom, oh God. Lord, there's ones
[15:30] around the world in China right now, the
[15:32] brothers in China, in different places,
[15:35] Lord Jesus, doing work for you, oh God,
[15:37] for your kingdom, Lord. Lord, we here
[15:40] can pray for them, oh God. That you'd
[15:42] strengthen them, Lord. Father, I believe
[15:44] that each of their footsteps is
[15:46] directed, Lord, to exactly where you'd
[15:47] want them to be, oh God. that you touch
[15:50] that one, Father, a soul crying out for
[15:53] for truth, oh God. Lord, where else can
[15:56] they find truth, Lord? We just so
[15:58] privileged to have it, oh God, all these
[16:00] years, Lord. So we thank you, Lord, for
[16:03] truth, Lord. For a prophet that was
[16:05] sent, oh God, in this last day, Lord, to
[16:08] reveal you, oh God, to us, Father. Lord,
[16:11] we never want to take it for granted,
[16:12] Lord. We don't want to take your word,
[16:15] your message for granted, Father.
[16:18] Oh Lord, be with us this morning. Lord,
[16:20] as your word would come this morning,
[16:22] Lord, we want our hearts to be open,
[16:23] Father. Speak, Lord, your word that we
[16:26] would have need of for this very moment,
[16:29] oh God. Lord, we don't want to miss even
[16:31] a small thing that you'd have for us,
[16:33] Lord Jesus. So may we be alert, oh God.
[16:36] We hold the man of God before you, Lord.
[16:39] Lord, we don't want to see the skin this
[16:41] morning, Lord. We want to see Almighty
[16:43] God. Have your way, oh Father. Have your
[16:46] way, Lord Jesus.
[16:49] Lord, we worship you and we thank you,
[16:50] Father. Have your way this morning in
[16:52] our midst. We pray. We give you all the
[16:54] glory and all the praise in Jesus name.
[16:57] Amen.

[19:05] far of a drive to make it every day from

[20:01] Praising my Savior
[20:07] all the day long.
[20:14] [Music]
[20:29] [Music]
[20:42] How wide
[20:44] is your love
[20:47] that you would stretch your arms and go
[20:51] around the world?
[20:54] [Music]
[20:55] And why
[20:58] for me
[21:01] would a Savior's cry be heard?
[21:05] I don't know
[21:09] why you went where I was meant to go.
[21:16] I don't know
[21:18] [Music]
[21:19] why you love me so.
[21:26] Those were my nails. That was my crown
[21:31] that pierced your hands and your brow.
[21:36] Those were my thorns. Those were my
[21:40] scorns. Those were my tears that fell
[21:45] down.
[21:47] And just as you said it would be,
[21:52] you did it all
[21:54] for me.
[21:58] And after you counted the cost,
[22:02] you took my shame, my blame
[22:07] on my cross.
[22:20] How deep
[22:22] is your grace
[22:24] that you could see my need and choose to
[22:29] take my place?
[22:32] And then
[22:35] for me
[22:38] these words I hear you say,
[22:42] "Father, no,
[22:45] forgive them for they know not what they
[22:50] do.
[22:52] I will go
[22:55] because I love them." So
[23:02] those were my nails. That was my crown
[23:07] that pierced your hands and your brow.
[23:12] Those were my thorns. Those were my
[23:16] scorns. Those were my tears that fell
[23:20] down.
[23:22] And just as you said it would be,
[23:27] you did it all
[23:29] for me.
[23:32] And after you counted the cost,
[23:37] you took my shame, my blame
[23:42] on my cross.
[23:45] [Music]
[24:03] Those were my nails. That was my crown
[24:08] that pierced your hands and your brow.
[24:13] Those were my thorns. Those were my
[24:16] scorns. Those were my tears that fell
[24:21] down.
[24:23] And just as you said it would be,
[24:27] you did it all
[24:30] for me.
[24:33] And after you counted the cost,
[24:37] you took my shame, my blame
[24:42] on my cross.
[24:52] But after you counted the cost,
[24:56] you took my shame, my blame
[25:01] [Music]
[25:03] on my
[25:05] cross.
[25:07] [Music]
[25:21] [Applause]
[25:31] I think it's in effort.
[25:36] Why don't we stand together this morning
[25:39] as we invite our pastor to come change
[25:42] the order of the service. We'll just
[25:44] sing Ellie
[25:45] Elohim.

[30:48] moments.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; We were saddened today to hear about uh
[30:59] Sister Noren Stewart.
[31:02] Uh it was so sudden and she just
[31:05] collapsed in the home and she's a young
[31:08] woman
[31:10] must be in maybe 40s early 50s and uh
[31:14] &gt;&gt; I think
[31:16] I said no. Okay.
[31:50] I'm going to sing that song. There's be
[31:52] no wires in heaven.
[31:55] I think that's quite an inspiration.
[31:57] Don't you?
[32:01] Who wants wires in heaven?
[32:05] I think about some of the performers
[32:08] that goes on and even even us preaching.
[32:11] I wonder whatever would happen if the
[32:13] pull the plug out.
[32:16] Well, we still have to preach.
[32:18] Amen.
[32:20] Uh we're just talking about sister Noren
[32:22] and I we're so acquainted with her
[32:24] mother and father for so many many
[32:26] years, real pillars in the church in
[32:29] Edmonton, brother Harold Hillbrand's
[32:32] church even before there were any other
[32:34] churches there and uh the Ellis family
[32:38] just such a wonderful family and I know
[32:41] acquainted with many of you. So let's
[32:44] remember them. It's even when you even
[32:47] when you expect someone to leave, it's
[32:51] not pleasant.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; It's always a there's a grief and a
[32:55] sorrow. We don't sorrow as others who
[32:57] have no hope. The Bible says, but I can
[33:00] tell you God can pour in just marvelous
[33:04] measure of grace and that we we really
[33:07] pray for them. But the Bible says if one
[33:09] suffer then we all suffer. If one
[33:11] sorrows, we all sorrow. If one rejoices,
[33:13] we all rejoice. So we just we really
[33:16] want to remember remember them
[33:19] and uh also one of the family of uh the
[33:23] Dick family a brother Abe Dick perhaps
[33:25] sister Aenitha I don't know uh brother
[33:28] Abe Fzen I think has gone
[33:31] and I don't know how many others of the
[33:33] Fzen family it was uh brother Jake Dick
[33:38] uh fam his brother-in-law his
[33:40] brother-in-law that passed away they
[33:42] were not believers as such but I and
[33:44] good Christian people and he had passed
[33:47] away. So some of them are driving today
[33:49] to go up to the funeral which will be
[33:51] around uh outside of Prince George I
[33:53] think towards Vanderhahoof someplace. So
[33:56] these these times come as a prophet of
[33:59] God said you know we can't predict these
[34:02] times sometimes it's a younger person
[34:06] sometimes it's an older person but I can
[34:08] tell you in none of us and that's why we
[34:11] want to take every service as a glorious
[34:15] opportunity
[34:17] we're here we have breath in our lungs
[34:20] we have a a some ability within our
[34:23] bodies we want to be sure that we give
[34:27] God the thanks that we're here and that
[34:30] we're able and we have a willing heart
[34:34] and the Holy Spirit, we cherish the Holy
[34:36] Spirit. Let's make every moment count
[34:39] for God.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure that you're in agreement
[34:43] with me there. Well, we we've had the uh
[34:48] the saints from Israel have been here
[34:50] with us and uh we're so happy to have
[34:54] them each one. Uh brother Sergey and
[34:57] brother if sister Julia and her husband
[35:01] brother Roman their their daughter Tea I
[35:05] believe is is correct. And uh I just
[35:09] wanted to have uh perhaps uh I'd like to
[35:13] have brother uh Sergey and brother if
[35:16] Kenny if you would come forward please
[35:18] and come and stand here. We'd like I
[35:21] just want to have prayer uh with them.
[35:24] They're leaving. I think sister Julia
[35:26] and brother Roman are leaving right
[35:28] after the service. They leave today and
[35:32] uh and brother Fenny and brother Sergey
[35:36] leave tomorrow. And so I'd like to just
[35:39] have the two brothers if they would come
[35:41] forward. They've been carrying the load
[35:43] of the work. And if they would come
[35:46] forward, I'm going to have brother
[35:49] Eugene
[35:51] uh come and if you'll just come here,
[35:55] you brothers come and help. And
[36:06] this is a unique thing that's taking
[36:08] place
[36:09] in Israel.
[36:12] And these brothers and their people
[36:15] gather on a regular basis. and they've
[36:19] had to move a time or two
[36:21] because uh uh the Orthodox Jewish people
[36:25] don't like to have that kind of services
[36:27] where they're singing and worshiping
[36:30] uh Christian meetings taking place. But
[36:33] then they also have been uh distributing
[36:37] material of the prophet's message and uh
[36:42] and he said that they will receive this
[36:45] message.
[36:46] Uh it's perhaps not exactly the way we
[36:50] anticipate it. We do not know how he
[36:52] will do these things, but we expect that
[36:56] uh that God's will, he God's got it all
[36:59] mapped out,
[37:00] &gt;&gt; and I believe it's right on schedule.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I really do. I wonder when we can
[37:05] have a microphone for them. I'd just
[37:07] like them to say a word of greeting
[37:08] before we
[37:19] just give a word of
[37:28] I greet you all in the name of Lord
[37:30] Jesus Christ.
[37:35] Uh I'm very p privileged to be here with
[37:37] you.
[37:48] It
[37:48] &gt;&gt; is a great privilege for me to be here
[37:50] amongst you and uh partake of the word
[37:52] of God that's ministered by the uh local
[37:55] ministers here.
[38:02] When we were first here for the first
[38:04] service,
[38:10] we were so uh so blessed to be here and
[38:12] we're so filled uh filled by the word
[38:16] that was preached
[38:28] that we didn't uh we didn't want to
[38:31] leave. We just wanted to stay here and
[38:32] be ministered and uh receive the
[38:35] ministry of the word that's preached
[38:36] here.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; We just wanted to pack up our families
[38:44] and move here and be amongst you all.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; We really felt that we're part of the
[38:54] family, that we're all just a whole
[38:56] people here.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:05] I remember when I uh met brother Sergey
[39:17] when I was uh sharing my plans with him
[39:19] that I want to take my family and move
[39:21] to go to Israel and uh spend some time
[39:23] there.
[39:28] He said, "You cannot do that
[39:35] because you're needed uh by your brother
[39:37] and sister in the church
[39:42] and eternal life is to live for others.
[39:45] [Laughter]
[39:49] I just kind of destroyed my plans.
[39:58] No,
[40:03] it's
[40:15] okay. He said that his plans were
[40:17] ruined, but the will of God took first
[40:20] place.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[40:29] as I heard in one of the uh sermons that
[40:31] the word of God is like snow.
[40:37] It falls on uh invisibly on on parts of
[40:41] our lives
[40:45] and we come and listen and we think that
[40:46] nothing's changed.
[40:53] And it comes a moment that something in
[40:55] our uh in our thinking and understanding
[40:57] just breaks apart
[41:04] and the will of God becomes the first
[41:06] place
[41:15] &gt;&gt; and uh towards the end of the service I
[41:17] I feel more responsibility to be there
[41:20] in Israel.
[41:29] Like brother Milo said, it is a
[41:30] privilege for us to be uh Jewish uh
[41:33] believers in Israel.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; And many people want to uh be u like
[41:46] Jewish, but they're not and want to live
[41:48] there.
[41:59] And uh
[42:06] &gt;&gt; sometimes we forget in and like in in
[42:09] the times when the days are gray and the
[42:11] days are dark and we just forget about
[42:12] that that it's a privilege for us to be
[42:14] live there.
[42:18] I also want to say
[42:28] &gt;&gt; that uh I was uh I was shocked or
[42:31] surprised by the size of your
[42:33] congregation,
[42:38] by the size of your houses that you live
[42:40] in
[42:46] Because in Israel we have such small
[42:48] places
[42:51] where we live and the restaurants and
[42:53] everything's so so mini. He said
[43:00] because everything is so expensive.
[43:07] At first we were gathering, you know, at
[43:09] each other's houses
[43:15] and after a while it was impossible. So
[43:16] we uh rented a little uh little house to
[43:19] gather in.
[43:27] And most of our tithes goes just to just
[43:29] to pay for this place that we're
[43:31] renting.
[43:40] We might not agree on many things
[43:42] amongst the their brother and sister,
[43:44] but we do agree that we need a bigger
[43:46] place.
[43:57] Because when somebody comes to visit us
[43:59] or somebody new comes,
[44:02] &gt;&gt; we we become very uncomfortable and it's
[44:05] not enough room
[44:13] and we believe that it's the will of God
[44:15] for us to be praying for a bigger place.
[44:26] We we believe that we could dream and uh
[44:28] wish for the will of God.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; So we we have a we have a right to
[44:37] expect something from the Lord.
[44:42] I also want to send greeting from all of
[44:44] our church.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; I should have said that first.
[44:53] This is the first time speaking such a
[44:54] big audience. I'm very nervous.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; May the Lord richly bless you.
[45:03] [Applause]
[45:13] &gt;&gt; I also want to send greetings from our
[45:15] church in Israel.
[45:17] Our
[45:20] church is uh slowly growing and new
[45:23] people are coming
[45:29] and the problem is they're not they're
[45:31] not Jewish and they want to bring uh
[45:33] Judaism into Christianity.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; This is a problem.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; I know that there is a lot of work in
[45:45] Israel.
[45:50] Today when I was studying the Bible, I I
[45:53] saw something in the in the book of
[45:55] Romans
[46:00] that um Apostle Paul's um wishes was to
[46:08] &gt;&gt; was to uh um
[46:15] uh was to to awaken Israel and and the
[46:18] the the work in Israel.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; I believe that uh if if you're Jewish
[46:33] and you're really Jewish and you're in
[46:36] Israel,
[46:41] &gt;&gt; I believe that we're there for the
[46:42] witness of the Jewish people.
[46:50] to witness that there is a a a living
[46:54] God and there is a living word and not
[46:57] traditions that they're living by.
[47:10] And uh we will try very very hard to be
[47:14] a witness to the Jewish people to show
[47:17] that there is a living word for the
[47:20] Jewish nation
[47:25] to to awaken their desire for the living
[47:28] God.
[47:31] There's too much politics, too many
[47:34] things going wrong but going going
[47:36] around. But they forgot about God.
[47:43] We don't have some kind of a a just of a
[47:45] teaching. We have a living God.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Because denominations they have forms
[47:55] and rituals, but we have a living God.
[48:03] And what denominations cannot do, God
[48:07] can use his bride
[48:09] &gt;&gt; to do in this end time.
[48:17] Many denominations, they want to convert
[48:19] Israel, but they cannot because they're
[48:20] denying
[48:23] &gt;&gt; they they're denying life.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; And I believe in that. Amen.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; I am very happy to uh to commune with
[48:35] you.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; I am very grateful to brother Milco.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; If he was Jewish, I would have taken him
[48:46] with me to Israel.
[48:53] We have a General Victor. We also have a
[48:56] Marshall Victor.
[48:57] I mean, uh, Marshall Mil, I'm sorry.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless him.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; We'll be happy to see you on the land of
[49:08] Israel.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "Try to save up some money and
[49:15] come to Israel to see Israel.
[49:20] You showed us uh the beauties of this
[49:22] country.
[49:25] Israel also has beauties of its land
[49:30] &gt;&gt; especially beautiful uh the Jerusalem at
[49:35] night.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Welcome to Israel.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; I'm also happy to uh to have
[49:49] communication with your ministers.
[49:55] I see that the Holy Spirit is moving
[49:57] through them.
[50:01] On Friday, we attended a prayer meeting
[50:09] and many people uh were praying because
[50:11] they have serious problems or needs.
[50:15] I know that the uh devil just always
[50:17] falls upon you
[50:19] &gt;&gt; and he is our enemy.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:26] I I once read a sermon, greater Solomon
[50:29] is here.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; When he said that when Israel um
[50:36] recognized the the gift of God and
[50:39] Solomon
[50:42] and they united around this gift,
[50:47] &gt;&gt; God uh just tamed all their all their
[50:49] enemies, calm down all their enemies.
[50:54] And not one dog was able to uh move with
[50:57] move his tongue.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; And if you see God in that and you unite
[51:05] together
[51:10] and God will solve all of your problems.
[51:14] For God there is nothing impossible.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; He is a great God.
[51:23] If he promised something to us, he is uh
[51:26] he cannot fail his promises.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. Uh stay
[51:34] together, stay united.
[51:39] Stay with the with with the ministry
[51:41] that was given to you by God.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:48] [Music]
[51:55] We'll just ask everyone to stand while
[51:57] we're going to have a prayer for our our
[51:59] brothers together.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; We're going to pray united that the Holy
[52:06] Spirit will anoint them and anoint the
[52:10] believers
[52:12] in Israel.
[52:15] Oh God, Lord, though we may not be
[52:18] present there, but you are present
[52:20] there, you will be with them as they
[52:22] make their journey home. You will anoint
[52:25] them, oh God. And we are praying that
[52:28] your word, the message that you have
[52:30] sent, the vindicated message, the proven
[52:33] message, the re message that reveals
[52:36] Jesus Christ. Reveal it to our brethren.
[52:40] Oh God, I pray that you'll anoint them.
[52:43] Father, pray as brother Sergey stands to
[52:45] minister as he has that you will anoint
[52:48] him. Father, I pray, oh God, our brother
[52:51] Evan, Lord Jesus, that the burden he
[52:54] has, oh God, and the desire he had to be
[52:57] there. I pray that you'll fulfill that
[53:00] desire, oh God. Pray that you'll anoint
[53:03] them each time that they gather. Lord, I
[53:06] pray that your Holy Spirit will make
[53:09] known your purpose and your will. What
[53:13] you've spoken through your prophet, it
[53:16] shall indeed come to pass in the name of
[53:19] Jesus Christ. I pray your blessing upon
[53:22] all, Father.
[53:25] And I pray, oh God, that your work will
[53:28] prosper. Lord,
[53:29] &gt;&gt; keep them in good health. Lord,
[53:31] &gt;&gt; give them good traveling mercies, Lord.
[53:35] Bless our brother Roman, sister Julia
[53:37] and their daughter. Pray oh father they
[53:40] will know that this was your will
[53:43] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Amenus.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We dedicate you to God's service.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[53:54] God bless you. Bless you. Amen. Bless
[53:58] you. Brother Abinney.
[54:01] I have just I want to send back.
[54:12] We have a brother who's not here,
[54:15] brother Mike Vineyard,
[54:18] and he's uh he's very very gifted. He
[54:22] makes knives
[54:24] and he made for whatever reason I don't
[54:27] know he made two knives
[54:29] with the star David on them. They're
[54:32] just absolutely knives. These are
[54:34] handmade right from nothing. And then he
[54:38] showed them to me and he said, "I
[54:40] thought I'd like you to have one and I'd
[54:42] like to send one to Israel."
[54:45] So I looked at them. I kept them on the
[54:48] counter
[54:50] &gt;&gt; and I said, "These belong in Israel."
[54:54] And I I want our brothers to have one
[54:58] each and these have been handmade by a
[55:01] brother in the church. He's not here
[55:03] today. And the reason why I'm doing this
[55:05] publicly is they're probably streaming
[55:07] the meeting and I want him to see it.
[55:11] So, Brother Mike Vineyard, God bless
[55:13] you. And I'm going to give these to our
[55:16] brothers here.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[55:20] and don't carry them in your pocket on
[55:23] the airplane.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. Whichever one you like.
[55:31] Okay. And when you open it,
[55:34] &gt;&gt; it locks. And you have to push that off
[55:36] to the side very carefully.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you.
[55:46] God bless you. Do you need Do you know
[55:48] how to take it back?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[55:58] [Music]
[56:01] [Applause]
[56:08] &gt;&gt; They're dual purpose. If they need a
[56:10] shave, they can do it also.
[56:14] Well, I thank you for your time and
[56:16] allowing us to take time. If you'll open
[56:18] your Bibles, I want to read. And I have
[56:21] something that's very, very much on my
[56:23] heart. I don't want to uh prolong the
[56:26] service any longer than we need to, but
[56:29] we didn't want to shorten it up either,
[56:31] not to recognize our brothers. Uh this
[56:34] is a rare opportunity.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Do you agree? It's a rare opportunity. I
[56:38] want to turn to the book of Exodus, the
[56:41] 33rd chapter.
[56:42] And we're going to begin reading at the
[56:44] 11th verse.
[57:05] Would you bow with me? And we want to
[57:07] pray.
[57:09] Father God,
[57:12] this is more than a formality.
[57:15] We are here seeking to move in the
[57:17] channel of the Holy Spirit of God.
[57:22] Father, we're asking and inviting you
[57:24] now to take absolute control. Lord, you
[57:28] have been with us through the worship
[57:30] service and the singing, the music, and
[57:33] all that has been taking place. And now
[57:35] the prayer with our brethren who are
[57:38] representative of the people in Israel.
[57:41] We're asking your grace and blessings
[57:44] upon them and now upon this
[57:46] congregation, upon those that are
[57:48] streaming this service at this time or
[57:52] will listen to it in the future days.
[57:54] Praying oh God that you will take the
[57:58] human instrumentality.
[58:00] Use father my lips. Use oh God the
[58:05] hearing of the people. I pray that it
[58:07] will sink further than the hearing and
[58:10] not stay in the remain in the mind but
[58:13] it will go down to the realm of the
[58:15] soul. And may it may it be life, oh God,
[58:19] to the soul for the Holy Spirit is the
[58:22] spirit of prophecy. And I pray that
[58:25] you'll give quickening power to the
[58:27] prophecy of your word for our time.
[58:29] Lord, let us see the message in another
[58:32] and a beautiful new light. In Jesus'
[58:35] name we ask it. Amen. And all the people
[58:38] said,
[58:39] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. We'll begin
[58:42] reading at the 11th verse. And the Lord
[58:44] spake unto Moses face to face as a man
[58:47] speaketh unto his friend. And he turned
[58:50] again into the camp. But his servant
[58:53] Joshua the son of Nana a young man
[58:55] departed out uh departed not out of the
[58:58] tabernacle. And Moses said unto the
[59:01] Lord, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up
[59:03] this people, and thou hast not let me
[59:06] know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet
[59:09] thou hast said, I know thee by name, and
[59:13] thou hast also found grace in my sight.
[59:16] Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have
[59:18] found grace in thy sight, show me now
[59:21] thy way, that I may know thee, that I
[59:25] may find grace in thy sight, and
[59:27] consider all, consider that this nation
[59:30] is thy people. And he said, excuse me,
[59:33] my presence shall go with thee, and I
[59:36] will give thee rest. And he said unto
[59:38] him, if thy presence go not with me,
[59:42] carry us not up hence.
[59:45] For wherein shall it be known here that
[59:48] I and thy people have found grace in thy
[59:50] sight? Is it not in that thou goest with
[59:53] us? So shall we be separated, I and thy
[59:57] people, and from all the people that are
[59:59] upon the face of the earth. And the Lord
[1:00:01] said unto Moses, I will do this thing
[1:00:04] also that thou hast spoken, for thou
[1:00:07] hast found grace in my sight, and I know
[1:00:10] thee by name. And he said, "I beseech
[1:00:13] thee, show me thy glory." And he said,
[1:00:17] "I will make all my goodness pass before
[1:00:20] thee, and I will proclaim the name of
[1:00:22] the Lord before thee, and will be
[1:00:25] gracious to whom I will be gracious, and
[1:00:27] will show mercy on whom I will show
[1:00:30] mercy." There's a profound statement
[1:00:32] that is happening here when God said,
[1:00:34] "I'll uh I will pass. I'll let all my
[1:00:37] goodness pass before thee." It has
[1:00:39] incredible depth which we can't go into
[1:00:41] at this time. Verse 20. And he said,
[1:00:45] "Thou canst not see my face, for there
[1:00:48] shall no man see me and live." Because
[1:00:51] when Moses said, "Show me thy glory."
[1:00:54] God knew that he wanted to see him face
[1:00:56] to face. And thou canst not see my face,
[1:01:00] for there shall no man see me and live.
[1:01:02] And the Lord said, "Behold, there is a
[1:01:06] place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a
[1:01:09] rock, and it shall come to pass while my
[1:01:12] glory passeth by, that I will put thee
[1:01:14] in a cliff of the rock, and will cover
[1:01:17] thee with my hand while I pass by, and I
[1:01:21] will take away my hand, and thou shalt
[1:01:24] see my back parts, but my face shall not
[1:01:29] be seen." And I want to speak to you
[1:01:33] from out of the 21st verse. There is a
[1:01:37] place by me.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; May God bless his word. And as you have
[1:01:42] your seats,
[1:01:51] Moses had really desired, greatly
[1:01:55] desired. This is one of the most
[1:01:57] touching and wonderful
[1:02:00] uh passages of scripture, recorded
[1:02:03] scripture of conversation between Moses
[1:02:07] and God. And Moses is is is like he's
[1:02:11] asking a special special favor.
[1:02:15] Show me thy glory. It's so touching.
[1:02:19] It's so uh uh moving. I mean, when you
[1:02:22] think that a man has been on the mount,
[1:02:24] a man has stood before the burning bush.
[1:02:27] He stood where no person has ever stood.
[1:02:31] standing in the divine presence of God
[1:02:34] in such a way and receiving a command to
[1:02:36] take an entire nation out of a
[1:02:40] superpower, out of the hand of Pharaoh,
[1:02:42] the ruling power of the earth, and
[1:02:46] deliver this people, and take this rod,
[1:02:48] your shepherd's rod, and you will
[1:02:51] deliver them, and you'll be my voice,
[1:02:53] and you will speak. And when you speak,
[1:02:56] it will be the same as me speaking. and
[1:02:58] you will say, "Let my people go." It was
[1:03:02] an incredible thing. And God would say
[1:03:04] that he spoke to Moses like it spoke to
[1:03:06] no other person, right from his lip to
[1:03:09] his ear. And he yet he desired to see
[1:03:13] the glory of God or the face of God
[1:03:17] which Moses could not see. That and that
[1:03:20] was going to be reserved. In 1 John 1:1
[1:03:24] it says that which was from the
[1:03:27] beginning which we have heard John
[1:03:29] speaking now the apostles writing which
[1:03:32] we have heard which we have seen with
[1:03:35] our eyes which we have looked upon and
[1:03:39] our hands have handled of the word of
[1:03:42] life. Uh the apostle is saying we have
[1:03:46] seen something. In other words, my point
[1:03:48] to you is that God has now come down in
[1:03:53] such a fashion that there was such a
[1:03:56] transparency. So, so close. God was just
[1:04:00] veiled behind the skin of one called
[1:04:03] Jesus Christ. How close he came, how
[1:04:07] close he was for them to see him face to
[1:04:11] face. And man had never been that close
[1:04:15] to see the masterpiece itself,
[1:04:18] the absolute masterpiece, the perfect
[1:04:20] image of almighty God standing before
[1:04:24] them. But it goes to show and it's a
[1:04:26] warning to us that God can come very
[1:04:30] very near and yet people are too dull
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; or too blinded
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; or too occupied to see it
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; or have taken it too much for granted
[1:04:42] and become too uh too casual about it
[1:04:46] and they failed to see what's in their
[1:04:48] day and oh they talking about Moses and
[1:04:51] the great time about Moses and the God
[1:04:54] of Moses. Moses was standing in front of
[1:04:56] them.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; And it's a it's it's behooving to us.
[1:05:01] I'm going to say some things today and
[1:05:03] you might think that I'm uh on track or
[1:05:06] way off track, but the prophet messenger
[1:05:10] that has brought you into this
[1:05:12] fellowship that God has used, God has
[1:05:17] used our prophet of this day and he
[1:05:21] stood and made it to this scientific
[1:05:25] uh disbelieving
[1:05:27] uh shall I say suspicious
[1:05:29] age. this age of so much psychology
[1:05:33] question everything
[1:05:35] even question themselves psychology I
[1:05:38] just want to say psychology is of the
[1:05:40] devil
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; that's frankly what I believe you don't
[1:05:45] question the devil asked the first
[1:05:47] question and man has been asking
[1:05:48] questions ever since you don't get
[1:05:51] answers just by asking questions you you
[1:05:53] have to learn and experience an answer
[1:05:56] from God and God's answers I said the
[1:05:59] other day The last service is not always
[1:06:02] what we uh think it to be,
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; but he came so so close. And in this
[1:06:08] generation, which is the fulfillment of
[1:06:11] Revelation 10:1, and another mighty
[1:06:14] angel descended and his as and he said
[1:06:17] it's the same one of Revelation 1. His
[1:06:20] face was as the sh sun son that shone in
[1:06:24] its strength. this face of God now and
[1:06:28] and the apostle, it was the apostle that
[1:06:31] saw it on the aisle of Patmas when he
[1:06:33] had this vision when he saw the Lord
[1:06:35] Jesus Christ, he said, "When I saw him,
[1:06:39] he fell as one dead." That's the effect
[1:06:41] that it had. And and the and brother
[1:06:44] Brandham speaks of the seven personage,
[1:06:47] the description of his person, seven of
[1:06:50] them. and starting uh his eyes and his
[1:06:53] hair and and his feet like brass that
[1:06:56] burned in the furnace and you can you
[1:06:58] can read it in Revelation chapter 1. We
[1:07:01] haven't time, but the last one was his
[1:07:04] face.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; And there were seven of them, but the
[1:07:07] last one was his face. Because the last
[1:07:10] age, the last time, there's never been a
[1:07:13] day like this day.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; There's never been a light like this
[1:07:16] light.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; And I want to present to you today and
[1:07:20] all who are listening to me, whoever
[1:07:22] will listen, let me say this.
[1:07:25] If others
[1:07:27] of the human race that believe that they
[1:07:31] have a prophet, including 1.3 billion
[1:07:35] Muhamadans, if they had word, I just
[1:07:39] want you to use your imagination. If
[1:07:41] they got word today that they had
[1:07:44] discovered and found where Muhammad
[1:07:47] their prophet stood in public and called
[1:07:51] people out and told them their life and
[1:07:56] told them their diseases and told them
[1:08:00] they were healed and told them that they
[1:08:03] were praying for someone and that person
[1:08:05] was in another city and told them all
[1:08:08] these things accurately.
[1:08:10] line by line by line, what do you think
[1:08:14] 1.3 billion Muhammadans would be doing
[1:08:17] today? I'll tell you, they would be
[1:08:19] scouring it. They'd be studying it. They
[1:08:22] would be seeking it out. They would be
[1:08:25] listening to every detail. They would be
[1:08:28] telling everybody. They'd be on the
[1:08:30] internet. They'd be on every social
[1:08:32] apparatus to try to make it known what a
[1:08:36] great thing has happened.
[1:08:40] And there's a danger
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; that we have it so common that you may
[1:08:45] even have access to it and don't take
[1:08:47] time to hear it.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; That's what God's going to hold this
[1:08:52] world accountable for.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; That's what God's going to hold it
[1:08:56] accountable for. I came down. I stood by
[1:09:00] you. I presented it to you. It couldn't
[1:09:03] have been clearer. I proved it over and
[1:09:06] over and over again. But you were too
[1:09:08] busy or too occupied or became too
[1:09:10] common to hear it. Don't fall into that
[1:09:14] trap.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Even in one service,
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; how many Mormons are there in the world?
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Good people, fine people. Their prophet
[1:09:30] didn't do in his entire life
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; what William Brham did in one service.
[1:09:37] Now it's on your hands.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Now it's on your hands.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Muhammad in all of his time. You say,
[1:09:48] "Oh, well, they didn't have uh they
[1:09:50] didn't have uh the advance. They didn't
[1:09:53] have the scientific advancement. They
[1:09:56] didn't have the advancement when when
[1:09:58] Elijah was here or Moses was here. But
[1:10:01] God still stood by them and proved that
[1:10:03] they were God's prophet. They were God's
[1:10:06] mouthpiece because what they spoke came
[1:10:09] to pass
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; whether it was a day away or whether it
[1:10:13] was a thousand years later or 800 years
[1:10:16] later but it came to pass.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] said, "There's a place by me."
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; And I saw another mayy angel come down
[1:10:31] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:10:33] rainbow was upon his head
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; and his face was as it were the sun,
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; and his feet as pillars of fire.
[1:10:42] I've been thinking of a word and I I
[1:10:44] it's a word that we do not use very
[1:10:46] commonly but it's called it is spoken
[1:10:50] investature instead of investment
[1:10:54] it's where it comes from also but it's
[1:10:56] investature and investature is when they
[1:10:59] will call someone at a special
[1:11:03] uh arrangement they will call someone
[1:11:07] and they're going to uh honor this
[1:11:11] individual
[1:11:13] we and and they're going to at a special
[1:11:16] time the queen of England on special
[1:11:19] occasions she will call a number of
[1:11:22] people for uh a a program or a ceremony
[1:11:26] of investature and then they become
[1:11:29] maybe from a common person they become a
[1:11:31] knight or they become something else. uh
[1:11:35] they will do it in in Canada and the
[1:11:37] United States. They do it and they come
[1:11:40] they they are they receive the order of
[1:11:43] Canada or the highest uh a highest order
[1:11:47] that they will pass on to a person in
[1:11:50] America because it's some recognition
[1:11:54] perhaps of something they have done or
[1:11:56] the life they have lived and then
[1:11:59] they're not only known anymore as just
[1:12:01] an average person on the street. this
[1:12:04] person has been honored and lifted up
[1:12:07] into a into a different status.
[1:12:12] That's an investature.
[1:12:14] The it is uh the the act or formal
[1:12:19] ceremony of conferring
[1:12:22] the authority and symbol of a high
[1:12:25] office on an individual. Or it is the
[1:12:29] adornment
[1:12:31] or the act of presenting with a title or
[1:12:35] with the robes or an insignia something
[1:12:38] that identifies them insignia of an
[1:12:41] office or rank. It is a formal entry
[1:12:46] into a position or a certain office.
[1:12:50] It's a dignity that's uh conferred upon
[1:12:53] this individual.
[1:12:55] Now just hold your seats.
[1:12:58] The book of Revelation
[1:13:01] is the investature,
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; And Revelation chapter 1 describes the
[1:13:12] one that's going to do the investing.
[1:13:14] Amen.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 1
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; said his face was as the sun that shone
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; and his hair was white like wool
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; and his eyes as flames of fire
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; and his body and his garment was dressed
[1:13:30] in radiant garment.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; But he's going he has something to say.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; He has a word to deliver
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; to the earth that he created
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; and the humanity that covers the earth.
[1:13:43] He has a message to bring to them. And
[1:13:46] he has things that he has kept sealed in
[1:13:49] the mind of God for all of these
[1:13:52] centuries. But now is going to come a
[1:13:54] certain time in a season that they will
[1:13:57] not be held secret anymore. And he's
[1:14:00] going to raise up someone who by the
[1:14:03] world's standards has no has no e
[1:14:06] education and is ignorant as far as
[1:14:09] words and as far as as far as scholastic
[1:14:12] abilities concerned because it cannot be
[1:14:15] confused with man's wisdom. He's raised
[1:14:18] him up for this generation in an age of
[1:14:22] intellectualism
[1:14:24] in an age of advancement. And he comes
[1:14:27] and God proves that he is advanced far
[1:14:30] beyond science. He says things that no
[1:14:33] scientist has said yet. He has wisdom
[1:14:36] concerning the medical world. He begins
[1:14:39] to talk about cancer and the cancer
[1:14:42] cells and how they become wounded and
[1:14:45] begin to uh sap the life out of the
[1:14:48] body. And he declares that he has been
[1:14:51] visited by an angel who told him nothing
[1:14:55] would stand before his prayers. Not even
[1:14:57] cancer which is the a disease of the
[1:15:00] age. And he spoke to the cancer spoke to
[1:15:04] the bodies and the cancer dropped on the
[1:15:07] platform. It was a vindicated ministry.
[1:15:11] Hallelujah. And that ministry was found
[1:15:13] in Revelation 3. It was found in
[1:15:16] Revelation 5. It is found in revelation
[1:15:19] 10 and all through and revelation became
[1:15:23] an open book
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; because there was a people
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; a selected people
[1:15:35] elected individuals
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; when they give an investature the queen
[1:15:40] of England will call x number of people
[1:15:43] for her birthday because her birthday
[1:15:46] has come and She wants to endow a number
[1:15:49] of people with an investature and they
[1:15:52] sometimes touch them. They sometimes
[1:15:55] touch them. And I can tell you that this
[1:15:58] investature of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:01] as an elected people and he took the
[1:16:04] book that had been closed and he opened
[1:16:08] the book and said, "I invest upon
[1:16:11] investature. You are being changed from
[1:16:14] church to bride.
[1:16:20] Hallelujah.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And you're entering another office.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; You're going from bride to wife.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; And you have all the rights of the
[1:16:34] kingdom.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be just what you
[1:16:42] think you are. You're going to be what I
[1:16:45] tell you you are.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Have you got my thought?
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Come
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; now
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; and stand by me
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; because there's a place by me.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have to stand
[1:17:04] where you stood. You don't have to be in
[1:17:06] that despondency and discouragement. You
[1:17:09] don't have to be in that same old pit
[1:17:11] you were in. You don't have to be
[1:17:13] plagued by those complexes. There's a
[1:17:16] place by me
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; and that place is a place of peace.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; That place is a piece of deliverance.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; That is a special place.
[1:17:29] [Applause]
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:32] [Music]
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; And to her was granted
[1:17:37] that she should be arrayed in fine
[1:17:39] linen.
[1:17:40] They put robes on people.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; This is a a wonderful occasion. They're
[1:17:46] going to come before the president of
[1:17:47] America and receive a medal around their
[1:17:50] neck and beautiful ribbons and they
[1:17:53] dress them and array them in beautiful
[1:17:56] robes and they come walking up amongst
[1:17:58] the people and the people are dazzled as
[1:18:01] they look upon these uh selected ones,
[1:18:05] these elected ones. But I'll tell you
[1:18:07] one day, my brother, my sister, you even
[1:18:11] recognize it now. People recognize the
[1:18:14] bride of Jesus Christ. You are
[1:18:16] different.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; You look different.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; You speak different.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; You are different.
[1:18:25] [Music]
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said it. It's a fulfillment of his
[1:18:28] words. You are of this world. You are in
[1:18:32] this world, but you're not of this
[1:18:34] world.
[1:18:35] You don't belong here.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus is telling you clearly, you're for
[1:18:40] another place. I've prepared the place
[1:18:44] and I'm preparing you for that place.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And we know it from the scripture. Even
[1:18:52] holy angels will stand silent as the
[1:18:56] bride
[1:18:58] adorned bride in her gown of the word of
[1:19:02] God. Hallelujah.
[1:19:05] Redeemed ones, glorious ones, ones
[1:19:09] who've overcome the world. Hallelujah.
[1:19:13] One who's overcome all the things of
[1:19:15] this life.
[1:19:17] One who's overcome it.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Here come the overcomers.
[1:19:24] Here come the victorious ones.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Here come the ones that Lucifer could
[1:19:31] not deceive.
[1:19:36] Hallelujah.
[1:19:38] Hallelujah.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Here come the ones. Some of them
[1:19:43] came up through school and the halls of
[1:19:46] education and they came up through
[1:19:49] economics and they came up through
[1:19:51] difficult times but they denied Satan at
[1:19:54] every front.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; They would not bow. They would not bend
[1:20:03] and they would not burn.
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:11] [Applause]
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Is this just a pipe dream?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; It's just some mysterious thing. It's a
[1:20:19] reality
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; and it's for you.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; And if Satan has taken the reality of it
[1:20:25] away from you, you don't you you start
[1:20:28] rejoicing now.
[1:20:32] This is mine.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; This is mine.
[1:20:38] [Music]
[1:20:39] [Applause]
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And to her was granted that she should
[1:20:44] be arrayed
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; in fine linen,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; clean and white.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; For the linen is the the fine linen is
[1:20:53] the righteousness of the saints. And
[1:20:55] Abraham believed God
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; and it was counted to him. He didn't
[1:21:00] earn it. It was counted to him. It was
[1:21:03] attributed to him
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; that he was righteous.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; He lied, but he was righteous.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; He had a backsliding time, but he was
[1:21:13] righteous.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; His believing was stronger than every
[1:21:16] other weakness.
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:31] Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] [Applause]
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Jacob had his He was called a shyster.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Prophet said he was called a shyer.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; You've seen me do it. That one page
[1:21:42] between the Old Testament, New
[1:21:43] Testament.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Over here was animal blood,
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; but here was the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:50] And none of the things that they did
[1:21:51] over here could pass through Calvary.
[1:21:56] Not a single thing.
[1:22:00] In fact, it's God like rubbed it in the
[1:22:02] s in Satan's face.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; David took Bath Sheba,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; but over here she's called a mother of
[1:22:10] Jesus Christ.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:22:16] That's your Bible. And that's my Bible.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; There's not one of the things, not one
[1:22:26] of the records the other side of Calvary
[1:22:28] that can come through that shield of
[1:22:30] blood.
[1:22:31] [Music]
[1:22:32] [Applause]
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; And there came unto me one of the seven
[1:22:38] angels, which had the seven vials,
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; full of the seven last plagues, and
[1:22:44] talked with me, saying, Come hither. I
[1:22:47] will show thee the bride, the lamb's
[1:22:50] wife.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She has been there has been
[1:22:54] an investature
[1:22:55] conducted in revelation and she has
[1:22:59] passed from just a woman that was
[1:23:01] forgiven. She's passed through the bride
[1:23:03] and has passed from a bride in a bride
[1:23:07] perhaps that has been, you know, has
[1:23:10] been betrothed, but she's passed beyond
[1:23:12] that into a wife. And she's a virgin
[1:23:16] wife.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; The same as Mary
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; virgin. But she's been pregnantated by
[1:23:22] the seed of her bridegroom.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And bringing forth the son
[1:23:28] of God
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; in his next office.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; For he'll pass from that to become king.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; He's her husband, but he's king of
[1:23:38] Israel. Amen.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; So I speak to you brothers and those of
[1:23:41] you from Israelise
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; in the power of transformation. He said,
[1:23:47] "Now we find everything in order."
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; God spoke it
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Let there be Let there be.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Let there be an an Eden
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; and let there be a beautiful flowers.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Let there be my son in my own image. And
[1:24:02] let him stand oh there over in the
[1:24:05] Garden of Eden. and let his bride, it's
[1:24:08] God speaking, let his bride stand by his
[1:24:12] side.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; You think you're sitting in a seat. Let
[1:24:17] me tell you something, friends. The one
[1:24:19] that descended, that spoke it in
[1:24:21] Revelation 10. He's descended because
[1:24:24] there was a people that were ready to
[1:24:26] stand by his side.
[1:24:29] I'm identified. I stand by the side of
[1:24:32] this Lord Jesus Christ. I'm identified
[1:24:35] with this word.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:41] [Music]
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Nothing can move
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; this woman.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; It's not church.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Don't sit here feeling this is just
[1:24:53] church.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; We're not having church.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; We're a we're we're moving in our
[1:24:58] capacity.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; We're a different kind of people. Not
[1:25:02] because I'm saying it, because God said
[1:25:04] it.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; I say to you, who is this bride?
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; I say to you, who is this spotless one?
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; I can tell you there'd be You think the
[1:25:16] Palestinians are dancing on the street
[1:25:18] because a representative, Mr. Ababas, is
[1:25:22] standing in the United Nations to
[1:25:24] declare that there's going to be they're
[1:25:26] going to declare a Palestinian state in
[1:25:28] Israel. and they're they're praying and
[1:25:30] dancing in the streets and having such a
[1:25:33] time. What a scene it is at the at the
[1:25:37] hopes or the anticipations of statehood.
[1:25:40] Listen friends, we're not we don't have
[1:25:42] some man.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; We don't have some man on our side. We
[1:25:47] have the king of kings.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; We have the one who hung on Calvary. We
[1:25:53] have the one, the one who came out of
[1:25:56] the tomb, who's invited us and said to
[1:26:00] you through this word, through this
[1:26:02] message, there's a place
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; by me.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Would you like to stand there?
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Would you like to stand by this
[1:26:12] bridegroom?
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; There's a place.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; There's a place by me.
[1:26:24] I'm the alpha.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; I'm the omega.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; I'm the beginning.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm the end.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; I'm the answer
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; to all of the world's dilemas.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Come and stand by me.
[1:26:40] [Applause]
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:49] Revelation is not just a book in the
[1:26:51] Bible. Revelation is where this person,
[1:26:55] these elected ones,
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; have been called to an investature
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; where she's robed in a different robe
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; and given a different title
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; and passed from one office to another
[1:27:07] office. My brother, my sister, if you
[1:27:09] miss this service this morning, if you
[1:27:12] miss the depths of this meeting in its
[1:27:14] simplicity, you're going to miss what
[1:27:16] God has for you.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Philadelphia church 8, the bride goes
[1:27:29] wherever the bridegroom is.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; She will never be left by him. She will
[1:27:38] never be left by him.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Hello. Some of you folks who felt he
[1:27:42] hasn't been near you.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Here's a vindicated prophet's word. She
[1:27:46] will never be left by him.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; I'm driving it home. I'm not trying to
[1:27:54] preach. I'm not trying to preach it. I'm
[1:27:56] not trying to convince you. I just feel
[1:27:58] inspired of the Holy Spirit cause these
[1:28:01] people to see it.
[1:28:05] [Music]
[1:28:06] It's a simplicity of it. She will never
[1:28:09] be left by him and she will never leave
[1:28:12] his side.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; She will share the throne with him.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; She will be crowned with the glory and
[1:28:20] honor.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; You talk about an investature.
[1:28:25] You might go to a graduation and have a
[1:28:27] little scroll rolled up and someone
[1:28:31] touch your head with your cap on and say
[1:28:35] you have now passed. You have now
[1:28:38] achieved a certain status and now you're
[1:28:40] to be recognized as Dr. So and so or
[1:28:44] master so and so or whatever more. I
[1:28:48] want to be touched by this word that
[1:28:51] says that have it handed down on my
[1:28:53] mind. You are now the spotless bride of
[1:28:56] Jesus Christ. And I I give you an
[1:29:00] investature of eternal life before the
[1:29:04] foundation of the world. But now I'm
[1:29:06] passing the knowledge on to you. You are
[1:29:08] invested. I am also in this investature
[1:29:12] letting you know that you are sinless.
[1:29:18] [Applause]
[1:29:20] You want to keep your sin, keep
[1:29:22] disbelieving.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; You want to be free from it, believe
[1:29:25] what I'm saying now.
[1:29:29] This is the invested chart.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; There's no sin in this word.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; And she's being invested with this word.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to pregnantate you with
[1:29:41] this word
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; and you're going to bring forth the
[1:29:44] word.
[1:29:52] Why can't we get excited?
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Now I know why I was guided in such a
[1:30:05] way. I had I had some pictures I was
[1:30:08] going to show you on the slides and I
[1:30:10] decided no, these are great places.
[1:30:12] There are physical places that have
[1:30:15] special meaning.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Physical places. There's the pyramids of
[1:30:20] Egypt or the Great Wall of China who I
[1:30:25] and my wife, we walked on the Great Wall
[1:30:28] of China. I tell you what, it's awe
[1:30:31] inspiring when you stand there and go up
[1:30:34] these steps and see these thousands of
[1:30:36] people and you get up to a certain peak
[1:30:38] and you just see it go down the valley
[1:30:40] and up the other ridge and over that
[1:30:42] hill and you can catch glimpses of it.
[1:30:45] It goes on. I said to brother Murphy,
[1:30:47] "How long does this wall go?" Said,
[1:30:50] "5,500
[1:30:52] miles." And I looked down to see each
[1:30:55] individual stone.
[1:30:58] man had to take that stone by hand and
[1:31:01] place it there and another one in some
[1:31:03] mortar. Stone by stone by stone. 5,000
[1:31:09] 500 miles, 8,100 kilometers
[1:31:13] of wall and with thousands of uh lookout
[1:31:18] places. Just incredible.
[1:31:21] And this was done by man for protection,
[1:31:25] for security. But they didn't find
[1:31:29] China's had her wars. She hasn't found
[1:31:32] the peace. But there's a place
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; by me,
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; a place of safety,
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; a place of assurance.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; If you don't have full assurance today,
[1:31:44] deny the place you're in and say,
[1:31:47] "There's a place that's been set aside
[1:31:49] for me by him."
[1:31:52] [Music]
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; He that descended. Hallelujah. He is the
[1:31:57] one
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; that said he has a place
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; by him.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; They have places. Victoria Falls, a lot
[1:32:07] of people go to Niagara Falls and
[1:32:10] there's places that inspire
[1:32:14] people. There are other places. Now I
[1:32:18] want those are physical places but there
[1:32:20] are other places that are symbolic
[1:32:26] and they inspire very very deep
[1:32:31] movements at the moment when a person is
[1:32:33] there because it calls for a man or
[1:32:36] woman. It calls for a person to come and
[1:32:39] stand.
[1:32:41] in a holocaust museum in in Israel.
[1:32:46] There's Yadvashm.
[1:32:48] That's the Holocaust Museum. And if you
[1:32:51] go there, you'll only be one of 1
[1:32:53] million over 1 million people a year.
[1:32:57] Each year goes through that museum.
[1:33:00] Covers about 45 acres of property. And
[1:33:04] there different kinds of uh museums. A
[1:33:07] few days ago, we had the 10th
[1:33:10] anniversary
[1:33:12] uh of of the World Trade Towers, and it
[1:33:16] still is it's more than inspiring. It's
[1:33:18] just unbelievable.
[1:33:20] I have seen and watched these towers go
[1:33:24] down and I can scarcely believe that all
[1:33:26] that steel,
[1:33:28] all that millions of tons of steel could
[1:33:32] just crumble as those top floors were
[1:33:36] belching out their evil smoke uh done by
[1:33:40] just 19 men. 19 men and flew those
[1:33:44] aircraft. And they planned, they they
[1:33:48] studied, they studied to become pilots.
[1:33:52] They studied in Florida. And it's
[1:33:54] amazing to me how that America, the
[1:33:58] system of America, they're so open, such
[1:34:01] an open society, so generous, received
[1:34:04] these people, and gave them status in
[1:34:07] America. And they studied and studied
[1:34:10] how to fly with it with it in their
[1:34:13] mind. I'm going to fly as a pilot, a
[1:34:16] plane for my faith into this corrupt
[1:34:20] nation and do what they could to destroy
[1:34:23] it and wiped out almost 3,000 people,
[1:34:26] 2900 and some people who are killed in
[1:34:30] the planes and the various things. Just
[1:34:32] a few days ago, you young people live to
[1:34:34] see it. You can see it on your computer.
[1:34:37] And uh and the people come by and they
[1:34:41] come by solemnly.
[1:34:43] They come by, they're not dancing.
[1:34:46] They're not hearing some wild music.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; This is a different This is a time of
[1:34:52] somnity.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; This is a time to remember.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; This is a time to be affected
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; by what happened. And they walk past
[1:35:01] those hundreds and hundreds of names at
[1:35:05] this memorial and they bring flowers and
[1:35:08] they weep and they have different
[1:35:11] experiences because some have lost
[1:35:14] fathers
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; and mothers and brothers and sisters and
[1:35:17] family or friends and they walk past
[1:35:21] this and the last few days have been
[1:35:23] filled with it as they walk past is a
[1:35:27] serious moment for America
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; and they saying, "Never again. Never
[1:35:32] again, we shall rise." The words of the
[1:35:35] president of the United States,
[1:35:38] he used some scripture at this solemn
[1:35:42] time and at heart-wrenching
[1:35:45] time for the nation.
[1:35:48] And he quoted from Psalms 46
[1:35:51] the words, "God is our refuge and
[1:35:54] strength,
[1:35:55] a very present help in trouble.
[1:35:59] Therefore, we will not fear, though the
[1:36:03] earth be removed and though the
[1:36:04] mountains be carried into the midst of
[1:36:07] the sea." Those are the words that he
[1:36:10] spoke in and in in in a way to let the
[1:36:14] world know that this thing has not
[1:36:17] broken our will. And this thing has been
[1:36:20] done by evil men with evil ambitions.
[1:36:24] But America, and I will say, as long as
[1:36:26] America would honor God,
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; God would honor her. But she has turned
[1:36:32] down
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; a message
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; by a man
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; who God raised up out of their soil
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; that was sent by God to make this book
[1:36:42] live.
[1:36:44] [Applause]
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; I want you to be get ready to declare it
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; as some of you have already. You declare
[1:36:56] it.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; I'm with you.
[1:37:00] I believe what you're saying, brother
[1:37:01] Visco.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I believe in this messenger.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; I believe he made this word live.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; I want you to go home thinking about 1.3
[1:37:12] billion Muhammadans and and about those
[1:37:15] that serve Islam and they're all
[1:37:18] throughout the earth. There's plenty in
[1:37:19] this country and also in America and
[1:37:21] Europe. Many, many of them. If they
[1:37:24] found, if they discovered Hey kids.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes, sir.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; If their parents discovered
[1:37:33] the words of Muhammad
[1:37:37] and that he actually faced the public
[1:37:42] and called people out by their name,
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; and said, "This is why you're here."
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; And I see you traveling. You're
[1:37:52] traveling from the east coming west to
[1:37:55] be here in this meeting. And you have
[1:37:59] sister, you have a letter in your purse
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; and that purse is from your daughter
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; and told you not to come here because I
[1:38:07] was coming to this city. If Muhammad had
[1:38:10] said such a thing, you wouldn't be able
[1:38:12] to control those people.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; By the way, and everybody listening to
[1:38:18] me on the internet and ever will listen
[1:38:21] to me, you got it on your shelves. You
[1:38:23] got it beside your bed. You got it in
[1:38:26] your car. You've got this in your car.
[1:38:28] Why did God do this?
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; It was to shake you and I
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; to move us to let us know the time of
[1:38:36] investature has come.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; And we are no longer to be a church
[1:38:41] member.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; We're to be a member of the body of
[1:38:44] Jesus Christ.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; We're to take our responsible position.
[1:38:49] We've been robbed with a different robe.
[1:38:52] We've got a different insignia. We've
[1:38:54] got a different identification.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends?
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; I'm praying that God will do something
[1:39:04] different here this morning in your
[1:39:06] heart as you say, I accept that.
[1:39:10] [Music]
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; I don't need to see your hands. I don't
[1:39:20] need to see your rise. I don't need to
[1:39:22] see you enthused. But God needs to see
[1:39:24] what's happening in your heart.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; And if something happens in your heart,
[1:39:32] usually there will be some kind of
[1:39:35] expression.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Even if you nod your head,
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I don't need you to nod your head. I
[1:39:40] don't need you to raise your hand. But
[1:39:42] if you want to stand and you want to
[1:39:44] scream out praise be to God.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; I say God bless you. However, however,
[1:39:50] God will minister to you.
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; So, there are physical places, but there
[1:40:00] are places
[1:40:02] also that are physical,
[1:40:05] but they have a they have a depth.
[1:40:10] People go to Sunset Mountain,
[1:40:13] they go to Sabino Canyon,
[1:40:16] they go to different places.
[1:40:19] I don't read in the scripture where they
[1:40:21] ever went back to the burning bush or
[1:40:23] where Moses ever went back to it.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; But it was certainly sacred at that
[1:40:27] time.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Take off your shoes.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; The ground you stand on is holy ground.
[1:40:34] It was only holy while God spoke with
[1:40:37] his prophet.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; When he left there, there was no more
[1:40:40] holiness on that ground.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Right now, today, this place has become
[1:40:45] a holy place.
[1:40:48] This is not just Cloverdale Bible Way.
[1:40:50] This is a holy place
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; where God seeks to convene. God has
[1:40:56] convened a meeting
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; to speak to whoever has ears to hear.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; And if you will hear and open up your
[1:41:05] heart and open up your soul, not only
[1:41:08] your mind and ears, but your soul, God
[1:41:11] has something to say to you.
[1:41:15] Amen.
[1:41:19] [Music]
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; The Temple Mount.
[1:41:26] I went up there with Rabbi Richmond
[1:41:30] on Temple Mount. We tried to go once
[1:41:32] before. They wouldn't let us. And then
[1:41:35] they had opened it up so we could go.
[1:41:39] And as we went,
[1:41:42] he said, "We cannot pray. We Jews cannot
[1:41:46] pray up here."
[1:41:48] But he said, "I want to pray with you.
[1:41:52] So I will pray as we walk. We will
[1:41:55] pray." And we just continued to walk. We
[1:41:58] had people secret service watching
[1:42:01] because him being a rabbi probably
[1:42:04] watched more than other people. And as
[1:42:06] we walked, he prayed and he thanked God
[1:42:10] that he could be walking to we could be
[1:42:12] walking together on the holy mount
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; and we will walk around the entire
[1:42:19] circumference of this mountain because
[1:42:23] God, we are claiming this mountain.
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'd walk around the
[1:42:31] church, but you'd lose sight of me if I
[1:42:33] went out the door. So we claimed the
[1:42:36] whole mountain. Glory to God. That's
[1:42:39] according to the word. I was so happy to
[1:42:42] walk around that mountain, claiming this
[1:42:45] mountain with a rabbi. Hallelujah. Who I
[1:42:49] trust makes is one of the 144,000.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; But there's others that claim that
[1:42:54] mountain and the Palestinians, the Arabs
[1:42:57] claim that mountain because it is the
[1:43:00] Dome of the Rock. I was in India. I
[1:43:03] can't take time with this because it's
[1:43:06] too much to say but I was in India and
[1:43:08] uh brother David was there remember we
[1:43:11] went to that temple and oh quite a
[1:43:13] number about 14 of us were there.
[1:43:15] Brother Tom Brown was there and and and
[1:43:18] we went to this temple. They said that
[1:43:20] there's a uh he has a 100,000 followers,
[1:43:24] this guru, this leader. And uh and and
[1:43:28] we went to people rolling on the floor,
[1:43:30] marble, marble everywhere, offering
[1:43:33] boxes, our offering boxes, kindergarten.
[1:43:36] And the way incidentally when you leave,
[1:43:38] don't forget it even though it is small.
[1:43:41] They had offering boxes this high about
[1:43:44] this square. They're big all steel with
[1:43:47] great big padlock on it. I almost got a
[1:43:50] revelation.
[1:43:52] My they got a lot of faith to put
[1:43:54] offering boxes like that. They were
[1:43:55] positioned at different places. And then
[1:43:58] they they uh what are all these people
[1:44:01] coming here for? I'm going to cut it
[1:44:03] real short. So they said, "Well, this
[1:44:06] place here, all these people are lined
[1:44:07] up and they're all in red and they're
[1:44:09] moving through here and uh and they all
[1:44:12] had to have some ashes put on their
[1:44:14] forehead and all of these ceremonial
[1:44:16] things." And then as we came up, there
[1:44:18] was a little we little we tiny square
[1:44:22] box of a room
[1:44:26] and that was the Holy of Holies.
[1:44:29] And I thought, "What is it so holy in
[1:44:32] there?"
[1:44:33] And there was a rock
[1:44:36] about that big sticking out of the
[1:44:37] ground. And they were rubbing it with
[1:44:40] all kinds of uh spices and things and
[1:44:44] rubbing it ochre. I think they were
[1:44:46] rubbing it with ochre. And it was just
[1:44:48] kind of brown and yellowish ochre and
[1:44:50] rubbing this stone.
[1:44:52] Thousands and thousands. Some of them
[1:44:54] had just walked over 200 miles.
[1:44:58] We saw them on the road walking in long
[1:45:01] lineups to come up and get some ashes
[1:45:04] put on their head and and see that
[1:45:08] stone.
[1:45:10] I said
[1:45:13] I didn't want to be rude. I said, "Wow."
[1:45:17] I said, "I could take these people to
[1:45:18] Saskatchewan and show them a mill of the
[1:45:20] million of these stones
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; that the wind blew and left the stone
[1:45:25] out of the That's what they told I said,
[1:45:27] "Well, what what's so special about the
[1:45:28] stone?" "Oh, a big wind blew through
[1:45:30] here once and left this stone appearing
[1:45:33] out of the ground." I said, "Well, of
[1:45:35] course it appeared out of the ground. If
[1:45:37] a strong wind blew and blew the dirt
[1:45:39] away, there's a stone was there." No, it
[1:45:42] became a holy place, a holy of holies.
[1:45:46] What do you think those people, if that
[1:45:47] man has started to say to the people,
[1:45:50] "Thus saith the Lord,
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; this is what happened. This is why you
[1:45:56] came and began to reveal the secret to
[1:45:58] their heart. I tell you what, friends,
[1:46:01] people are following. They don't know
[1:46:02] what they're following. Are you with me?
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; I'm putting the emphasis. People have
[1:46:06] been saying to me recently, it seems
[1:46:08] that you've been putting the emphasis on
[1:46:09] the message. You want to believe it.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; There's never been a message like that
[1:46:14] message. There's never been a time that
[1:46:16] almighty God, God of the universe,
[1:46:19] creator of all things, there's never
[1:46:21] been a time he sent a man, a human, to
[1:46:23] the earth and said, "I'm going to stand
[1:46:25] by you,
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; and I'll never leave you,
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to I won't let the words
[1:46:31] out of your mouth drop to the ground. It
[1:46:34] shall come to pass."
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, friends, there's a
[1:46:39] few things that haven't come to pass
[1:46:41] yet. Don't wait till they do. I expect
[1:46:43] to be moving out of here. California is
[1:46:46] going to sink into the ocean.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; California is going to sink into the
[1:46:50] Pacific. I'm not I don't even look to
[1:46:53] see if there's been a tremble here or
[1:46:54] shake there. Whatever more the shake
[1:46:56] came by way of the word of God.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; It will weep its way. The ocean will
[1:47:02] weep its way into the desert.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; That's thus sayith the word of God.
[1:47:11] It's already been proven.
[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; And so we have these places that that
[1:47:20] are bring us to a state of awe and
[1:47:24] wonderment,
[1:47:26] a little place and people come there and
[1:47:29] it's very sacred and very moving for
[1:47:31] them.
[1:47:33] These are places where
[1:47:37] when they walked by the towers and saw
[1:47:40] those names, they thought about the men,
[1:47:44] they thought about the firemen,
[1:47:46] they thought about the police, they
[1:47:48] thought about all these people and uh
[1:47:51] Canadian Broadcasting, they had a
[1:47:53] program. It was really incredible. They
[1:47:56] worked for all these years, for these
[1:47:58] last 10 years. Don't know if you had one
[1:48:01] in America like it or not, but they got
[1:48:04] the voices.
[1:48:06] They got all they compiled all the
[1:48:08] voices
[1:48:10] of the people that were phoning from
[1:48:11] home with the people that were in the
[1:48:14] building and the people that were in the
[1:48:16] airplanes and all they put put it all
[1:48:19] together in one program. It's about one
[1:48:21] or two hours long. Don't ask me for it.
[1:48:23] I don't have it. It's a Canadian
[1:48:25] Broadcasting Corporation. And I listened
[1:48:28] to those people speak. I listened to
[1:48:30] fathers and husbands speak to their
[1:48:32] wives and and how and and how calm they
[1:48:36] were. And then some got urgent and they
[1:48:38] couldn't speak and they they were they
[1:48:40] were being completely consumed with with
[1:48:42] dust and choking and they couldn't they
[1:48:45] one said, "Well, go to the stairwell. Go
[1:48:48] to the stairwell and go down two, three
[1:48:50] floors." And he went to the stairwell
[1:48:52] and came back and said, "There is no
[1:48:54] stairwell. It's collapsed." about three
[1:48:57] floors of the stairwell has collapsed.
[1:49:00] People were in all of these states. I
[1:49:01] can tell you that as they walked past
[1:49:05] that memorial,
[1:49:07] this is what they were thinking.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; They're thinking about these people,
[1:49:12] they're thinking about the children that
[1:49:14] remained.
[1:49:17] And so my point now, listen closely
[1:49:21] because this is a major crux in the
[1:49:23] service.
[1:49:24] My point is that we can come to a place
[1:49:29] where we ponder
[1:49:34] something that's happened.
[1:49:37] And I want I want everyone in this
[1:49:40] congregation
[1:49:42] that's ever been touched
[1:49:45] by him,
[1:49:47] I want you to go back
[1:49:49] now in your thoughts
[1:49:52] to the service
[1:49:54] to the servant of God who was speaking
[1:49:57] or to the place where you were sitting
[1:50:00] or out
[1:50:02] maybe in nature someplace.
[1:50:05] You were sitting by yourself. You may
[1:50:07] have been sitting in the quietness of
[1:50:08] your home.
[1:50:11] There was some moment
[1:50:13] when you knew that the almighty one had
[1:50:18] come very near.
[1:50:20] I want you to ponder about that.
[1:50:24] I want you to ask yourself
[1:50:28] and ask him,
[1:50:31] why did you do that, Lord? I know it was
[1:50:34] you.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:36] Why did you touch me?
[1:50:41] Why did you touch me?
[1:50:45] What was the purpose?
[1:50:47] The road has not been easy since.
[1:50:52] It was not easy for Abram. It was not
[1:50:56] easy for the ones of the old. It was not
[1:50:58] easy. They had their hardships,
[1:51:01] but you touched them.
[1:51:04] The Bible tells us that Abraham
[1:51:08] when he went away from his land and his
[1:51:10] country and his people
[1:51:13] I'm going to make this I'm right down to
[1:51:15] your address.
[1:51:17] I think so much of brother Joe and
[1:51:19] Sister Eileen Waldner, Sister Kathy
[1:51:25] and others but there was five of them
[1:51:27] and their children.
[1:51:30] David came afterward, but there was
[1:51:31] Anita
[1:51:33] and Julie, I believe, and they flew the
[1:51:36] family. We had to send them tickets
[1:51:40] and they arrived in the little log
[1:51:42] church on a Sunday. We had to get a man
[1:51:45] because they were in a very tight colony
[1:51:48] and a breather believer brother, brother
[1:51:52] Jake Wall from Edmonton. He was in
[1:51:54] Winnipeg and he drew he drove the car in
[1:51:57] and they all jumped into the car just
[1:51:59] with their shopping bags.
[1:52:03] Brother Joe, Sister Eileen,
[1:52:06] that's one of the reasons I continue to
[1:52:08] honor you with such a deep respect.
[1:52:12] They left mother.
[1:52:16] They left all their friends,
[1:52:19] left their relatives,
[1:52:22] and drove out
[1:52:24] with a finality
[1:52:27] of perhaps never returning again.
[1:52:30] Do you know why? Somebody touched them.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; And I'll never forget, sen, excuse me
[1:52:41] for using your testimony, but there are
[1:52:43] things that I remember and I'm going
[1:52:45] back. I'm pondering things today.
[1:52:48] And she walked into the foyer, the
[1:52:50] little log church,
[1:52:53] and tears were streaming down her
[1:52:55] cheeks.
[1:52:57] And she looked at me like this and she
[1:52:59] said, "These are not tears of sorrow.
[1:53:02] These are tears of joy."
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; I never forget that. And it's been
[1:53:08] glorious ever since.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; And God has answered many of their
[1:53:12] prayers and will continue to answer
[1:53:14] them. and given them their family. I
[1:53:17] tell you friends, this is a living God.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; This is a living way.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; And people who embraced and loved and
[1:53:24] loved that Lord Jesus loved that message
[1:53:26] long before they were around any other
[1:53:28] believers. Long before they were in this
[1:53:30] kind of an atmosphere, they believed it.
[1:53:33] I want you to go back where you were
[1:53:35] touched.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:40] On occasion, I've I've said to my wife
[1:53:43] just once or twice, I said to my wife,
[1:53:48] I'm just going I'm going for a drive
[1:53:53] and I actually drove several hundred
[1:53:54] miles
[1:53:57] and it was a beautiful fall day
[1:54:00] and I was waying farther north and I
[1:54:02] stopped my pickup and I got out on the
[1:54:05] bank and the sun was shining and the
[1:54:08] colors of God's God began to paint
[1:54:13] the scenery with his brush somewhere
[1:54:17] yellow and bronze
[1:54:19] and the dark green of the spruce and the
[1:54:22] lake big lake out in front of me about
[1:54:26] 700 miles north of here
[1:54:28] and I laid on the bank.
[1:54:31] This is what I said. This was one of the
[1:54:33] moments I'm seeking to bring you to this
[1:54:35] morning.
[1:54:37] I said, "Father,"
[1:54:41] I went back
[1:54:43] said, "That was you.
[1:54:45] That was you back there. I know that was
[1:54:49] you." Because there's no sense, there's
[1:54:52] no feeling, there's no atmosphere like
[1:54:55] that. I know that was you.
[1:54:58] Then there was a time at further down it
[1:55:00] was all completely different. But I know
[1:55:02] that also was you.
[1:55:05] And then I moved forward and I said,"I
[1:55:08] know that was you."
[1:55:12] And by the time I had gone through three
[1:55:15] or four
[1:55:17] of those experiences,
[1:55:22] I began to feel a different presence.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; It wasn't me. It was different presence
[1:55:27] around me.
[1:55:29] And father, I know this is you.
[1:55:35] Then you can ask your questions. Why did
[1:55:37] you call me?
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; What would you have me to do?
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, that that atmosphere
[1:55:44] leaves you so humbled,
[1:55:49] so quiet, and so peaceful.
[1:55:54] It's a wonderful atmosphere.
[1:55:57] And friends, if you haven't had that
[1:55:58] experience, you young people, if you
[1:56:01] haven't had that experience, oh, if I
[1:56:04] could take you,
[1:56:07] I'd like to take you to him.
[1:56:10] I'd like you to begin to feel that.
[1:56:17] Dear friends, I don't even feel like I'm
[1:56:19] preaching.
[1:56:21] I need to talk to you.
[1:56:23] I just yesterday I just just need to
[1:56:26] talk to the people.
[1:56:29] That's precisely
[1:56:31] why this message was sent.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Not to give you a different doctrine or
[1:56:37] a different church,
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; but to draw you into this atmosphere.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; For in this atmosphere, Brother Roy, the
[1:56:45] supernatural is happening. In this
[1:56:48] atmosphere, your natures will be
[1:56:50] changed. In this atmosphere, what you
[1:56:52] hunger and crave for will be satisfied.
[1:56:55] [Applause]
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; That's what the church needs.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; We don't need better music or better
[1:57:04] this or better that.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; We just need his presence.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; We want to have the meetings until he's
[1:57:11] so pleased that he's comfortable.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; And I've come amongst you.
[1:57:21] Tell you what, friends, everything else
[1:57:24] just passes off the scene.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says of Abraham
[1:57:32] that he journeyed
[1:57:35] and he came to a place.
[1:57:39] I'll never get through this message. I'm
[1:57:41] just going to stop. I'm going to watch
[1:57:43] my time.
[1:57:47] He journeyied and he came to a place and
[1:57:49] he built an altar and the Bible says and
[1:57:52] there he worshiped. Hold that.
[1:57:56] Then the Bible tells of his other
[1:57:58] movements
[1:58:00] and you read
[1:58:02] and he returned again. He returned
[1:58:04] again. He went back to where he had been
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; as I was saying to you. He he went
[1:58:11] physically. You can go back mentally.
[1:58:13] You go back in your mind. These people
[1:58:16] that go to the Holocaust Museum or go to
[1:58:19] the Dome of the Rock or go to these
[1:58:22] other places, the that physical stone
[1:58:25] and that physical place doesn't mean
[1:58:27] anything but what it symbolizes, what it
[1:58:30] means of what has happened there. And
[1:58:33] they believe and they come to that rock.
[1:58:34] This is where Abraham offered his son
[1:58:36] Isaac. And they think about that and
[1:58:39] they're going back and they and they
[1:58:41] also anticipate the temple being rebuilt
[1:58:44] and the temple is going to stand here
[1:58:46] and there's a rejoicing. Well, Abraham,
[1:58:48] he had been God had promised him a land.
[1:58:51] God had promised him a land. Hold hold
[1:58:54] it closely, friends. God had promised
[1:58:55] him a land. A land. I'm a wanderer. I'm
[1:58:58] a pilgrim. I'm a sojourer. And God has
[1:59:01] promised me a land. I've got to worship
[1:59:03] him. I've got to thank him. I got to
[1:59:05] build an altar here. I want to remember
[1:59:07] this place. And he built an altar and he
[1:59:10] worshiped God who gave him that promise.
[1:59:13] And then he traveled. He traveled and he
[1:59:15] had all kinds of problems. He traveled
[1:59:18] and he goes wherever he puts his foot,
[1:59:21] he keeps traveling and he comes back and
[1:59:23] he comes back to the same spot. And at
[1:59:26] that spot, what does he remember? God
[1:59:28] promised me a land. God promised you a
[1:59:31] life in the Holy Ghost. And maybe you
[1:59:33] walked around a lot over the last few
[1:59:35] years. And you haven't seen that life in
[1:59:37] the Holy Ghost, but you're a son or
[1:59:39] daughter of Abraham. You don't forget
[1:59:42] the promise of God. He wouldn't forget
[1:59:44] the promise. God gave me this promise
[1:59:46] that I would inherit this life. I would
[1:59:49] inherit this land. And now I will I will
[1:59:52] come and I'll build another altar and
[1:59:54] I'll worship God once again. Why?
[1:59:57] Because he believed that was the truth.
[2:00:01] And Jesus when he come on the scene, he
[2:00:04] says they that worship him must worship
[2:00:07] him in spirit and in truth.
[2:00:11] [Music]
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; It's what God has said.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; And I say to you the truth, the only
[2:00:16] truth that I know that God vindicated.
[2:00:19] If you have another one, you're
[2:00:20] obligated to show it to me. But God
[2:00:23] stood behind one man. Well, God stood
[2:00:25] behind this prophet of God, William
[2:00:27] Brandham, and confirmed every single
[2:00:30] service.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; And proved it.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; We're not following
[2:00:38] old wives fables.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; We're not following some mystic strange
[2:00:44] stuff.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; We're following what God from another
[2:00:47] realm came on the scene and proved it
[2:00:50] and confirmed it and said clearly, "It's
[2:00:53] me. Amen.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; And all we're doing, we're saying, "You
[2:00:59] drew me into this."
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you young people, you were
[2:01:03] born into it.
[2:01:05] I'd go back there.
[2:01:11] Some of you are not very young. You may
[2:01:14] have been past 50 now, but you were born
[2:01:17] into a believing message. Those of you
[2:01:21] that are seated here and have children
[2:01:24] that were born into your family
[2:01:31] and they're not serving God,
[2:01:34] you have a right this morning.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; You have a right in this service.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "Our pastor is preaching and I
[2:01:42] believe that word
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; and I dedicated those children."
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, I dedicated those children. God
[2:01:48] bless you, brother Wes. God bless you. I
[2:01:51] think see you, Sister Violet. God bless
[2:01:53] you. I don't care how far people get
[2:01:56] from God. I want you to sit here today
[2:01:58] and say, "I believe that promise.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; It was thus sayeth the Lord to me. I've
[2:02:04] got loved ones. I've got children. I've
[2:02:06] got loved ones. And I'm holding fast to
[2:02:08] them."
[2:02:10] [Music]
[2:02:12] In the name of Jesus Christ. In the name
[2:02:15] of the God of Elijah. In the name of the
[2:02:18] God and father of my Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:02:20] In the name of the God of William Brham.
[2:02:23] That name is none other than the Lord
[2:02:25] Jesus Christ.
[2:02:28] [Applause]
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; And I claim them.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; I'm here friends to speak to you to do
[2:02:35] business for the kingdom of God.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have time. Our time is
[2:02:42] slipped away.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; But there's a whole another part of this
[2:02:48] service and the prophet of God and where
[2:02:52] this service came from.
[2:02:54] And I'd love to have brought up some
[2:02:56] quotes for you and show them on the
[2:02:58] screen, but you understand English.
[2:03:02] You understand my language.
[2:03:04] He says the God's
[2:03:07] only
[2:03:09] only
[2:03:11] provided
[2:03:12] place of worship.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; There is no other place.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; And he said if God has only one place,
[2:03:22] it's not in a church
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; and it's not a Presbyterian or the
[2:03:26] Baptist or the Pentecostal or the
[2:03:28] Catholic. They all have their belief and
[2:03:33] people hold to those beliefs because
[2:03:36] they believe that those are right and we
[2:03:38] respect them for believing and holding
[2:03:41] to their beliefs. But that is not the
[2:03:44] place that God spoke to when he said to
[2:03:48] Moses in that you will offer your
[2:03:50] sacrifice in the place that I choose.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my point to you is God
[2:03:58] in this generation chose who he wanted
[2:04:02] to stand beside.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; And my confidence that he stands by me
[2:04:12] is because I'm standing with the word
[2:04:14] that came out of the mouth of him who he
[2:04:17] said he will stand beside.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; And we stand there.
[2:04:25] Hallelujah.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; And as I think about that,
[2:04:30] I think about a log.
[2:04:33] I think about a place
[2:04:35] just where a little dirt trail ended and
[2:04:39] walked off into some grass.
[2:04:44] You forgive me,
[2:04:46] but that's the kind of service we're
[2:04:48] having.
[2:04:50] I think about a young man 26, 27
[2:04:56] that had all kinds of questions.
[2:04:59] Questions?
[2:05:01] My heart was so heavy. I saw what I
[2:05:04] thought was the best churches in the
[2:05:06] country going into a into a downward
[2:05:10] slide. And you could preach as hard as
[2:05:13] you want. It seemed there was no way to
[2:05:15] turn it around.
[2:05:22] And I was sitting with a man
[2:05:26] about this far away
[2:05:29] and he said he came to me.
[2:05:32] I was so glad.
[2:05:34] I was sitting beside somebody who he
[2:05:37] could come to
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; say you have some questions. You have
[2:05:43] three and these are I've been telling
[2:05:45] you quite a bit about that. I've told
[2:05:47] that several times in the last few
[2:05:49] weeks. Why? Because, friend, everything,
[2:05:52] my faith is pinned and hinged on a
[2:05:56] living God.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just come here to church
[2:05:59] and this is a Wednesday night meeting
[2:06:01] and this is a Friday night service or
[2:06:03] prayer service. That isn't it. We want
[2:06:06] to come into this house of God and
[2:06:08] expect to see answers to our prayers. We
[2:06:13] want to see our lives grow. We want to
[2:06:17] see things take place.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need supernatural
[2:06:22] answers,
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; do we not?
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; And let's be open for them. Let's be
[2:06:30] ready for them.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; But he said clearly, there's only one
[2:06:34] place
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; and Jesus said, and I and that place,
[2:06:39] I'm not speaking of a physical
[2:06:40] structure. I'm not speaking of this
[2:06:42] building. The only place is this
[2:06:45] message. Not just a representation of
[2:06:47] the message, not just a professing of
[2:06:49] this message, but someone that is
[2:06:51] drinking in
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; what this prophet said
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; and holding fast to it
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; and letting that word become alive in
[2:07:00] you.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[2:07:07] dear friends,
[2:07:09] I want to close by saying this.
[2:07:16] This word actually
[2:07:18] can be activated
[2:07:21] and it falls into a heart that is falls
[2:07:24] down into the inner being and a person
[2:07:28] becomes you can feel them moving. You
[2:07:31] have to give time to it.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; You have to ponder it.
[2:07:37] You have to give time. You have to think
[2:07:39] about it.
[2:07:41] Let it go from the mind down to the
[2:07:42] heart.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; If it don't, it just becomes a it just
[2:07:45] becomes a mental belief.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; And church just becomes an activity. And
[2:07:50] you can have a school and you can have
[2:07:52] all these things and you can have a camp
[2:07:53] and go on and on and on. It's more than
[2:07:56] just having meetings. It's more than
[2:07:57] just special services. It's more it's
[2:08:00] more than all of these things. I just
[2:08:02] want to tell you if and and and if you
[2:08:04] will take this say I'm going to act upon
[2:08:07] that and I'm going to let that I'm I'm
[2:08:09] going to let the the words even if it's
[2:08:12] just one phrase.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; If it's just one phrase
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; uh you read in a message and just one
[2:08:17] phrase.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; I urge people there's brothers I've
[2:08:20] spoken to and ministers I've spoken to.
[2:08:23] They say, "Well, h how how do you know?"
[2:08:26] Well, sometimes this service just came
[2:08:28] as one phrase.
[2:08:32] There's a place
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; by me.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; And I just begin to ponder.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a place.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; There's a place Moses is saying, I want
[2:08:46] to see your face.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; He's heard and he's talked to God and
[2:08:50] God's talked to him. What a man. What a
[2:08:53] place he's been in. And he said, "But I
[2:08:56] I want something more. I want to see
[2:08:57] your face.
[2:09:02] Maybe you can't catch it. It was
[2:09:04] reserved for this generation.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; They will see him
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; face to face.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; The countenance and the shining
[2:09:15] countenance was for the last age.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; And I say to you, I announce to you as a
[2:09:22] congregation of people that God sent
[2:09:25] this messenger. That's why he was in
[2:09:27] such close proximity to him all the
[2:09:30] time.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; That's why, man. Listen to it. Go ahead.
[2:09:34] Go home. Get the get the prayer line
[2:09:36] tapes. You young people. Just listen to
[2:09:38] them. And then as you're listening, say,
[2:09:40] "Father, help me to grasp why you did
[2:09:43] this
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; in my generation. You didn't do it with
[2:09:47] Martin Luther or or or or all of the
[2:09:51] other greats or Wesley. You didn't do it
[2:09:53] even by the apostles this way. You did
[2:09:55] it this. You didn't even do it yourself
[2:09:57] quite like this, but now you're doing
[2:10:00] it.
[2:10:02] [Music]
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; I think people have missed it.
[2:10:06] Seriously.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; When they said, "Oh, well that's just a
[2:10:09] second pull." I can tell you they're in
[2:10:11] the third pull and they don't even have
[2:10:12] that.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; That wasn't just a second pull. That was
[2:10:15] his presence
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; signifying that he was there present
[2:10:18] with the with and he wouldn't he he he
[2:10:21] wouldn't he wouldn't wherever he went.
[2:10:23] it was it was Houston or whether it was
[2:10:25] Bombay or whether it was Durban or
[2:10:27] Johannesburg or wherever it was
[2:10:31] to have a man
[2:10:37] to have a man just say how do you do
[2:10:39] friends
[2:10:41] I can't do anything
[2:10:44] until he comes
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; well was that God there already yes that
[2:10:49] God was there
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; another preacher could have said God is
[2:10:53] present
[2:10:55] But then when you have a a a a special
[2:10:58] vessel
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; and listen, he's special not so we could
[2:11:01] make him special. He's special because
[2:11:03] God was doing it on your behalf.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; I want you to say that to yourself. God
[2:11:10] did this for me.
[2:11:13] [Music]
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; They just say he's here.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; It was different from that moment on.
[2:11:22] Amen.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Sydney Jackson said in South Africa two
[2:11:25] 300,000 people he'd say he's here and he
[2:11:29] said just a somnity
[2:11:31] a sacred feeling a sacred atmosphere
[2:11:34] fell over that he said even the dogs and
[2:11:36] the animals where there's always the dog
[2:11:39] fights and things going on and because
[2:11:41] it's out in the open air and he said
[2:11:44] even the animals were totally silent
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; you could hear a pin drop why is God a
[2:11:50] creation
[2:11:52] taking authority over every spirit of
[2:11:54] man, even over the animal kingdom,
[2:11:57] because now God was going to speak
[2:12:00] through his vessel to people in the name
[2:12:04] of Jesus Christ. Do not miss this
[2:12:06] service. Do not miss what I'm saying
[2:12:08] now. Take it with all seriousness and
[2:12:11] say, "Oh God, go home to your home. Drop
[2:12:14] down on your knees. Get alone with God."
[2:12:17] and saying, "Help me to get what brother
[2:12:18] Bisco was speaking of this morning. I
[2:12:21] want to I want to be saturated. I want
[2:12:23] to be permeated. I want, oh God, that
[2:12:26] divine presence
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; to be my constant guide.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; And I honor you, Lord.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; We'll bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[2:12:40] how
[2:12:42] how real you are,
[2:12:44] how marvelous you are.
[2:12:47] And you're not done. And we're not
[2:12:48] closing this service yet at this moment.
[2:12:51] But I pray that your spirit now, Father,
[2:12:54] begin to brood as you did in the first.
[2:12:56] You brooded and brooded until a
[2:12:59] beautiful lily came forward came up out
[2:13:02] of all of the muck and all of the mud.
[2:13:06] And we have all this environment. Lord,
[2:13:08] we go out of this place. We may go to a
[2:13:11] place to eat or we may go. There's that
[2:13:13] music and there's these images
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; and here's this conversation
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; and we just start feeling as though
[2:13:20] we're being soiled.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Oh God, hide us in the rock.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; May the people find a cliff in the rock.
[2:13:35] Lord, when you pass by, we'll not see
[2:13:37] the backward parts, but we'll see the
[2:13:40] Son of Man, in all of his glory, in all
[2:13:43] of his beauty,
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; face to face
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; with Christ, my savior.
[2:13:50] Oh, bless your name, Lord.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; We thank you for this time together. And
[2:13:55] I pray again, Lord, with this
[2:13:57] congregation for the the our precious
[2:14:01] brothers and sisters that are returning
[2:14:03] back to Israel. May they go knowing they
[2:14:07] are there on a mission.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; They are there, oh God, and all the
[2:14:11] powers of hell will be uh sailed against
[2:14:14] them. But we have no fear.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Our confidence is in you. We've seen the
[2:14:20] devil try to attack, oh God. And we've
[2:14:23] seen you, as your prophet said, you
[2:14:26] should see him in battle one time. We've
[2:14:28] seen you in battle, oh God. We've seen
[2:14:31] such glorious victories. Hallelujah. Who
[2:14:35] wants to say hallelujah with me? Who
[2:14:37] wants to see glory to God? Come, Lord
[2:14:40] Jesus, come. Come, I pray. Meet the
[2:14:43] hunger and the thirst of the hearts, oh
[2:14:46] God, in the name of Jesus Christ. Your
[2:14:50] perfect will be done. Meet every need,
[2:14:52] Lord. There's some great needs. There's
[2:14:54] homes. There's great needs in homes. Oh
[2:14:57] God, take control. Take charge. Father,
[2:15:00] I I I I sense, Lord, that they're
[2:15:03] lifting up these requests to you even
[2:15:05] now. I'm praying with you, believers.
[2:15:07] I'm praying with you, saints. Go out and
[2:15:10] reach, oh God, these that may be uh
[2:15:13] doing their own thing today. Reach them
[2:15:15] for your word has said that the spirit
[2:15:17] of God when he's come, he will convict
[2:15:20] the world of sin. Convict these oh God,
[2:15:23] of unbelief. Convict them of the
[2:15:25] direction they're going. Turn them
[2:15:27] around
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; Bring, I pray, Father, a sense of
[2:15:34] reality to them. Take the bl darkness
[2:15:37] and the blindness away.
[2:15:39] Oh God, will this congregation pray with
[2:15:41] me?
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; We've got a number of people. We've got
[2:15:45] young men and women. We've got some
[2:15:47] homes. We've got some families. We need
[2:15:49] to see them delivered. Let's call on
[2:15:51] deliverance. You pray in your way. You
[2:15:54] pray in your way. You pray because
[2:15:55] brother Biscuit's making a request. Pray
[2:15:58] for some of these please in the Jesus
[2:16:01] name.
[2:16:02] I'm waiting for you to pray.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Let the congregation pray.
[2:16:08] Call on God.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; May they find no no peace or
[2:16:19] satisfaction in the world. Oh God, let
[2:16:22] their next drink be a bitter one. Oh
[2:16:25] God, that do whatever needs to be done
[2:16:28] physically, even to their bodies. Cause
[2:16:31] their sleep to go from their eyes.
[2:16:33] Disturb them in the night time.
[2:16:36] Oh God, turn them I pray. Let this
[2:16:39] church become a praying church. Oh God,
[2:16:42] in the name of Jesus Christ, let the
[2:16:44] will of the unbeliever be broken. Oh
[2:16:48] God, let it be broken. May the spirit of
[2:16:51] God break the stubborn will of man in
[2:16:54] the name of Jesus Christ. I take charge
[2:16:56] over every unbelieving spirit in the
[2:17:00] name of Jesus Christ against every
[2:17:02] critical spirit that the will and the
[2:17:05] word of God may have perfect liberty.
[2:17:09] Cleanse, oh God, with a holy fire,
[2:17:13] cleanse your children. Let there be a
[2:17:16] melting, oh father.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:17:24] Put a burden upon the hearts of the
[2:17:26] people, Lord.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; That they might enter into earnest
[2:17:29] prayer.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Oh God, there's husbands that need you.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Pray for these husbands, oh God, that
[2:17:36] need you.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Wives that need you.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Children that need you, oh God, because
[2:17:43] of what we've heard and what we've
[2:17:44] received.
[2:17:52] Bless your name.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Oh God.

[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; You will be victorious.
[2:19:43] Sister Diane and brother Claude.
[2:19:47] God met you, Brother Claude, out in the
[2:19:49] wilderness.
[2:19:52] God told you who he was.
[2:19:54] You go back to that time.
[2:19:58] Think about that. Meditate upon that.
[2:20:00] Why did you speak to me?
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Why did you give me such a miracle?
[2:20:06] Hallelujah. That God still hears you.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; at this time. I need God to hear me.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; I'll ponder about the time you touched
[2:20:26] me.
[2:20:27] I remember when you touched me,
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; you laid your
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; hand of message
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; your message hand. You laid it upon me.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; You in and then investature.
[2:20:42] You made known
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; your secrets.
[2:20:47] And now you're my friend
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; that sticks closer than a brother.

[2:21:21] Face
[2:21:22] to face. What will it be?
[2:21:26] [Music]
[2:21:29] When
[2:21:31] with rapture I behold
[2:21:36] him Jesus Christ who died
[2:21:42] for me.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; All who know it sing it please. Face
[2:21:49] to face shall I behold
[2:21:54] him
[2:21:56] far
[2:21:58] beyond the starry sky.
[2:22:04] Oh face

[2:22:34] the darkling veil between.

[2:23:10] beyond the star.
[2:23:15] Oh,
[2:23:17] face
[2:23:19] to face in all his glory.
[2:23:25] I shall see him by
[2:23:30] and by. I want the congregation to know
[2:23:34] just lift it up at the top of your voice
[2:23:36] this next verse. When what rejoicing in
[2:23:40] his presence?
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; What rejoicing in his presence?
[2:23:49] [Music]
[2:23:50] When our strength and pain
[2:23:56] [Music]
[2:23:58] when
[2:24:00] the broken ways are
[2:24:06] and the dark things shall
[2:24:10] be.
[2:24:14] Oh, face
[2:24:16] to face shall I behold
[2:24:21] him
[2:24:23] far
[2:24:24] beyond the starry sky.
[2:24:31] Faith
[2:24:33] to face in all his glory.
[2:24:39] I shall see him by

[2:24:58] beyond the starry sky.
[2:25:03] Oh

[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; I'd like you as a my dear friends and
[2:25:24] brothers and sisters in Christ if you'll
[2:25:27] just join me as we get ready to close
[2:25:29] now and I'll ask brother John Andy's to
[2:25:31] come and close. I love you, Lord,
[2:25:36] and I lift my voice
[2:25:38] [Music]
[2:25:39] to worship you,
[2:25:42] oh my soul. I love you, Lord.
[2:25:48] Love
[2:25:50] you, Lord.
[2:25:54] And I live
[2:25:58] my voice.
[2:26:03] to worship
[2:26:08] you,
[2:26:10] oh my soul.
[2:26:15] Rejoice,
[2:26:18] take joy,
[2:26:21] my king.
[2:26:23] [Music]
[2:26:25] Hear
[2:26:27] what you hear.
[2:26:31] [Music]
[2:26:32] Let it be a sweet,
[2:26:36] sweet
[2:26:37] sound
[2:26:40] in your ear.
[2:26:46] Oh, I love you, Lord.
[2:26:52] Oh, we love you, Lord. We love you.
[2:26:56] We love you, Lord. We love you. Oh, we
[2:26:59] lift our voice to you, Lord. You worship
[2:27:06] me,
[2:27:07] [Music]
[2:27:08] oh my soul.
[2:27:13] Rejoice
[2:27:19] [Music]
[2:27:23] [Applause]
[2:27:26] you
[2:27:28] [Applause]
[2:27:30] make me a sweet
[2:27:35] sound
[2:27:37] in
[2:27:39] [Music]
[2:27:41] Hallelujah Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, we love you today, God.
[2:27:49] [Music]
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, this is what we pray about in our
[2:27:56] secret closet.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; This is what's been in our hearts, God.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just talk about living
[2:28:06] in your presence. We want it to be a
[2:28:09] reality, Jesus. Our hands are lifted up,
[2:28:12] Lord, because our words fall so short of
[2:28:15] what
[2:28:16] is in our hearts right now, Jesus,
[2:28:20] when we'd like to steal away and just be
[2:28:22] all alone with you and not speak before
[2:28:25] the crowds.
[2:28:27] [Music]
[2:28:29] But we must confess in the congregation
[2:28:32] that this is exactly what has been in
[2:28:34] our hearts, God. a groaning
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; to be one in your presence. That our
[2:28:39] words and our hearts and our lives would
[2:28:42] live continuously,
[2:28:44] [Music]
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; continuously.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; Not come in and go out, not come to a
[2:28:51] church address and hear a sermon or go
[2:28:54] to a camp or and then go live a
[2:28:57] different life.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; That's not our desire, God. We want it
[2:29:02] to be automatically and continually
[2:29:05] [Music]
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; moment by moment, minute by minute.
[2:29:10] Lord, we are desiring that Jesus. And to
[2:29:13] have our pastor come and speak it, to
[2:29:15] have the other ministry labor in this
[2:29:18] channel of your will and your purpose,
[2:29:21] to have those ushering arms and wings of
[2:29:24] your spirit
[2:29:26] getting us into this place. God, we can
[2:29:30] only confess, Lord, your will be done,
[2:29:33] Jesus, as you've been beckoning,
[2:29:35] beckoning to us from the bedroom. Lord,
[2:29:38] we don't want to just talk about it. We
[2:29:41] don't want to just talk about a prayer
[2:29:43] life and not have it. We don't want to
[2:29:45] talk about a secret place and not have
[2:29:48] it. God, this is our moment. This is the
[2:29:51] hour, God, for your people to come into
[2:29:54] this place where it's you and us alone.
[2:29:58] Jesus, deliver us from churchianity,
[2:30:01] Lord, and complexes and spirits of the
[2:30:03] enemy, Satan trying to block it on every
[2:30:06] hand
[2:30:08] as we know this is the mind of the
[2:30:10] spirit. Help us to get into the channel,
[2:30:12] Jesus, of getting out of the way, God,
[2:30:14] and laying all the sin down at this
[2:30:16] altar.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, there will be a people
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; that will know you and your power.
[2:30:27] Lord, where our heart is trembling right
[2:30:29] now because there will also be a people
[2:30:33] to claim this.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; And never experience it. And though
[2:30:38] they've been all around it and so close
[2:30:40] to it, you never knew them.
[2:30:44] Don't let that be one of us, Lord Jesus.
[2:30:47] God, help us, Lord. We know it's
[2:30:50] predestination.
[2:30:52] We know there's a seed and we believe
[2:30:54] that, God. Then there will be seed
[2:30:57] results, Lord, and there will be seed
[2:30:59] responses at the end time of your word.
[2:31:03] God, let the token be distributed to
[2:31:05] every life. We have a burden for our
[2:31:07] children, for our young people, for our
[2:31:10] families, lest we miss it.
[2:31:14] [Music]
[2:31:17] God, help us, Lord Jesus. May the Holy
[2:31:20] Ghost be in our hearts today. May our
[2:31:23] hearts go out of this building and go to
[2:31:25] where we live, where we work on an
[2:31:27] airplane, God, in our homes, Jesus, in
[2:31:32] our cars, God. May the personal presence
[2:31:35] of Jesus Christ, we're inviting you
[2:31:38] right now, God,
[2:31:41] [Music]
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; come out of the pages,
[2:31:45] become a living manifestation in our
[2:31:47] lives, God,
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; anoint the seed in our souls, Lord. Yes.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; Let us tremble, God, in our homes, in
[2:31:55] our lives. Let the effects of your
[2:31:57] presence
[2:31:59] cause our mouths to be closed when words
[2:32:02] that ought not to be spoken are ready to
[2:32:05] come out. Lord, let a character of
[2:32:07] Jesus, let the nature of God get a hold
[2:32:10] of these hearts, God,
[2:32:12] when some are trying to get away,
[2:32:17] we're wanting to run too
[2:32:20] today. Lord, let it be recorded, Jesus,
[2:32:23] that we love your appearing and we'd
[2:32:25] want more of your word in our lives,
[2:32:27] God. It just seems like this service has
[2:32:30] no end. There's no period. There's no
[2:32:32] amen to it. We wanted to continue on
[2:32:35] this afternoon, God. You take our
[2:32:37] precious brother Tom, Lord, and use his
[2:32:39] gift, Lord, as is a hunger of our lives,
[2:32:43] Lord, to come into your presence more
[2:32:45] and more. And each one of these gifts,
[2:32:47] Lord, that get out of the way. Help us
[2:32:49] to get out of our way, God. And it gives
[2:32:52] us entrance into your very presence,
[2:32:54] Lord. We're hearing from our theophanes.
[2:32:58] [Music]
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; Dear Jesus,
[2:33:02] soften our hearts with oil.
[2:33:05] Quiet us, Lord.
[2:33:08] Let us get into a place where we wait on
[2:33:10] you, Lord.
[2:33:14] Jesus God,
[2:33:16] we want to touch you, Lord. We want to
[2:33:18] reach out, Lord.
[2:33:20] [Music]
[2:33:22] Our brother Biscoll held up his hand,
[2:33:24] Lord, this morning. He was inches away
[2:33:26] from your prophet. Most of us never had
[2:33:29] that experience.
[2:33:32] But you have answered our questions.
[2:33:34] You've given us the answer. We have been
[2:33:37] face to face and our generation with the
[2:33:40] mighty angel.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:44] That is our testimony.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; We are face to face with you right now,
[2:33:48] God.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; You are that close to us, Lord, and
[2:33:52] nearer. You are in our hearts. So go
[2:33:55] with us, Lord, to our homes and our
[2:33:57] places, God. May there not be frolic and
[2:34:00] foolishness. May there not be room for
[2:34:02] wrong decisions now. May there not be
[2:34:05] times, Lord, of of unbelief and sin,
[2:34:08] God. We people run out so quickly and in
[2:34:10] a few minutes it's it's like it's gone.
[2:34:13] Don't let that happen, God, and our
[2:34:15] promised land, Jesus. But let it so
[2:34:18] reach into our souls, Lord, that it'll
[2:34:20] become our daily meat, God, and our
[2:34:22] bread and our our food, Jesus.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; For we drink from you, and we can never
[2:34:28] be the same. Go with us now, God. We
[2:34:30] have many loved ones, and there's
[2:34:32] burdens many carry here. We carry them
[2:34:34] with us, Lord, until we see your
[2:34:38] supernatural hand outreach, God. We'll
[2:34:41] we'll continue to believe for the
[2:34:42] impossible. And our faith is in you,
[2:34:45] Jesus. Our faith is in your word, God.
[2:34:48] May this rapture anointing and your
[2:34:51] spirit that's upon your word within our
[2:34:53] hearts carry us, God. Continue to be
[2:34:56] with us as we go now. Go with every
[2:34:58] life, even on the internet, Jesus. those
[2:35:01] that are away from us or on the phone,
[2:35:03] hook up our friends, our family, and
[2:35:05] your elected seed go with them today,
[2:35:08] Jesus. And may every
[2:35:11] seed that is redeemable
[2:35:14] find a place, God, of yielding us to
[2:35:16] you.
[2:35:18] Bless our pastor and bless every life
[2:35:20] that's waited in this service and
[2:35:22] worshiped you. May our lives be a
[2:35:24] worship and may we live that amen in our
[2:35:28] actions, God.
[2:35:30] We commit this word to you today. Go
[2:35:33] with us now. And our visitors, God, and
[2:35:35] our precious friends from Israel,
[2:35:39] God, go with them, Jesus.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; May they win their land. May they fight
[2:35:44] for their inheritance.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; May they not give in
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; to the powers of darkness that would
[2:35:51] fight against them. But as we also fight
[2:35:54] in our place, may we send them forth to
[2:35:57] fight in their place as overcomers
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; under this great banner of the mighty
[2:36:03] angel that's come down. Bless us now as
[2:36:06] we go in Jesus precious name.
[2:36:10] Amen.
[2:36:11] [Music]
[2:36:15] We want to send you with God's blessings
[2:36:17] and especially to
[2:36:20] brother Roman, sister Julia. God give
[2:36:24] you safe journey. God bless you in Jesus
[2:36:26] name. You're all dismissed. God bless
[2:36:29] you. We'll see you at 5:00. Amen.
