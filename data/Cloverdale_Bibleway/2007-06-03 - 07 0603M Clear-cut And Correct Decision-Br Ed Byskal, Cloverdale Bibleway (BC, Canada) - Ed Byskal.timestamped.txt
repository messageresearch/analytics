[15:25] lift it before the Lord as we go to
[15:28] prayer. Amen. He's able to meet every
[15:30] need. Brother DD if you come.
[15:37] Let's pray together.
[15:43] Father, there's no better place than in
[15:45] your presence this morning. Lord,
[15:48] it is a privilege to us, oh God, to know
[15:50] that we can stand before the living God.
[15:54] Open our hearts, oh Father. Open our
[15:56] mouths and know that you're attentive to
[15:58] the cry of your children.
[16:00] Father, you're not a God of wood or
[16:02] stone, but you're living alive among us
[16:05] today. We know that the never failing
[16:08] presence of Jesus Christ is even here
[16:11] now. So Lord, we lay aside every weight,
[16:15] every sin, every unbelief, every
[16:17] distraction, oh God. And we want our
[16:20] mind and hearts to focus upon you.
[16:23] Knowing that, oh God, when you are here,
[16:25] anything can take place. Lord, all
[16:28] things are possible. Even as we sang, we
[16:32] know that that's the song the angel
[16:34] father connected with in such an unusual
[16:37] way. It became the theme of this great
[16:40] message of redemption. Oh God. So this
[16:42] morning, we're sang that we believe. We
[16:45] believe that you're here, Father. For
[16:47] those that come to you must first
[16:49] believe that you are. And you are a
[16:51] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[16:53] after you, Father. And this morning,
[16:56] we're seeking for the living God. For
[16:58] you to come and minister to us, Father,
[17:01] for you to open up the windows of
[17:03] heaven, and send down a blessing,
[17:05] Father, that'll make a difference in our
[17:07] lives, oh God. For without you, Father,
[17:10] we are nothing. That's our confession
[17:12] today. So we say, "Come, Lord Jesus.
[17:15] Come and see every hearts today. Oh God,
[17:18] minister to us according to your riches
[17:21] and glory. Break loose upon us once
[17:23] again. Father, let your Holy Spirit
[17:26] touch everyone this morning that when we
[17:28] come to the end of the gathering, we'll
[17:31] know with assurityity that God was among
[17:33] us. Father, we believe the supernatural
[17:36] will take place. Even as your word will
[17:38] be declared by your servant this
[17:40] morning, we just pray that you give him
[17:42] uncction. God, give him liberty. Give
[17:45] him strength, Father, and give him
[17:47] leadership, oh God, to say those things
[17:50] that you know are so necessary for us at
[17:53] this time, Father, beyond, oh God, the
[17:55] need that we're conscious of ourselves.
[17:58] You know what we have need of, dear
[18:00] Father. So we say, have thine own way.
[18:03] Prevail upon us today. And let your
[18:05] word, Father, be delivered with such
[18:07] power that the sick will be healed. And
[18:10] those that are discouraged, they can be
[18:12] encouraged this morning. And those that
[18:15] are wayward, they can be brought back in
[18:17] the middle of the road to walk again
[18:19] with you in fellowship and communion in
[18:22] this late hour. Father, we just want you
[18:25] to have preeminence today. We have
[18:28] committed this service to you, and we
[18:30] believe you've never failed us yet. We
[18:32] just know that you'll take charge once
[18:35] again. Have your way today as we lay our
[18:38] hands upon this cloth. Unworthy as we
[18:40] are, but we know that we cover by the
[18:43] blood today. And you have given us the
[18:45] promise that oh God that when we ask for
[18:48] anything in your name, you shall do it,
[18:50] Father. So when it shall be put upon the
[18:53] sick, let them recover, Father, and let
[18:56] your name be glorified. For we know
[18:58] you're still keeping your word this
[18:59] morning. You're attentive to your
[19:01] promise, Lord, to make it sure to the
[19:04] air of the promise today. We ask that
[19:06] you'll give a confirmation to each one
[19:09] that is seeking a touch from you by your
[19:11] word this morning. We know your word is
[19:14] powerful. There's no limit to what you
[19:16] can do. So, we just come, Father,
[19:18] opening our hearts, dear God, saying,
[19:20] "Feed the hungry soul. Give us that
[19:23] hidden mana that only you can provide in
[19:26] this hour. Oh Jesus, would you have your
[19:29] way today? We love you, Father. We
[19:31] appreciate you, Lord. We just commit the
[19:34] service to you. Bless each one, Father,
[19:36] in this building and those connected by
[19:39] phone or hookup and by internet today.
[19:42] We just ask you'll be mindful of each
[19:44] believer today for we've come to do
[19:46] service, Father, to just lay our lives
[19:49] on your altar. Let your fire consume us
[19:52] and let our sacrifice today be
[19:54] acceptable in your sight. We love and
[19:57] appreciate you. We give you thanks this
[19:59] morning, Lord. There's no God like you,
[20:01] Father. We're so glad to stand in your
[20:04] presence and know that Father, this is a
[20:07] place where we belong. So touch everyone
[20:09] today. The service is done and we give
[20:12] it all to you, Father. Prevail upon us,
[20:15] Lord Jesus. Oh heavenly king, we want
[20:18] you today as the deer pentest after the
[20:21] water brook. Truly our souls hunger for
[20:24] the living God. Who can satisfy like
[20:27] Jesus? Only you this morning. So have
[20:30] your way. We abandon ourselves unto your
[20:33] great care, asking that you'll have your
[20:35] way, Jesus. Have the preeminence that
[20:38] you long to have among your people and
[20:40] touch your servant as you speak through
[20:43] him and you receive your word in our
[20:45] heart. We thank you in Jesus name. Amen.

[31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So happy to be here gathered with
[31:24] you again this morning. Uh
[31:28] just we missed home of course but we
[31:31] weren't far from your prayers because I
[31:34] know that you were praying and that
[31:36] meant a great deal to us. I'm going to
[31:40] be saying a little bit about uh our
[31:43] journey, the services and so on in just
[31:46] a few moments. But uh would like to uh
[31:50] ask you to do something for me. We are
[31:54] less than one month from the convention
[32:00] and I want to ask that the congregation
[32:04] will take special time in prayer
[32:07] in your own prayer closet or if you are
[32:12] visiting with someone I'd like the man
[32:15] of the house if he would just take
[32:17] leadership and say the pastor has asked
[32:20] us to have special prayer for the
[32:23] convention.
[32:24] for the direction for the presence of
[32:26] the Holy Spirit that the supernatural
[32:29] will be in attendance. We are not
[32:32] gathering to just hear a lot of words or
[32:34] to gain a bunch of information. We want
[32:37] God to be glorified. That's what we want
[32:40] to see take place. So I'm asking the
[32:43] congregation to take this month now from
[32:46] now till the convention and through the
[32:48] convention and ask for special prayer uh
[32:52] for direction and if you will please
[32:55] pray for me. We have a lot of weighty
[32:58] matters that are resting upon our
[33:01] shoulders. We want to make uh the the
[33:04] correct and uh wisest uh decision in
[33:08] these matters. And so if you would do
[33:11] that, I'm sure that you will because I'm
[33:13] requesting that you will do that.
[33:17] We will have prayer also before we turn
[33:20] to the word in a few minutes. We want to
[33:21] be remembering our brother Ron
[33:23] Peterson's twin brother, brother Dawn.
[33:27] He uh had a a severe heart attack, I
[33:30] understand, and they took him in and and
[33:32] have done a u uh surgery, heart surgery.
[33:37] Um I believe it's a triple bypass or
[33:40] something that has been done. I don't
[33:43] know all the details but I know that the
[33:45] operation has been uh completed and
[33:48] brother brother Don is uh brother Ron is
[33:53] speaking to brother Dawn about uh other
[33:56] issues in his life and and he wants us
[33:59] to pray for him. pray that he will come
[34:02] into a place of real fellowship with
[34:05] with God once again. And uh so I'd like
[34:10] you if you would join with me in
[34:12] remembering brother Dawn. Also before we
[34:17] uh go to prayer and before I say
[34:18] something more on the uh on the on the
[34:21] trip uh I want to make announcement
[34:24] regarding the Sunday services. And next
[34:27] Sunday, which is June the 10th, we will
[34:30] be having two services. But then from
[34:33] June the 17th, which is the following
[34:36] Sunday, we'll be going to one service
[34:38] because the US students are out. the
[34:42] borders are in they're already very very
[34:45] crowded and we'll be going we you know I
[34:48] talked to brother I talked to brother uh
[34:51] Tim Puit and they had gone to one
[34:53] service on Sunday but he said they
[34:55] started like having camp meeting because
[34:58] he took so much time in the Sunday
[35:00] morning service and he said he felt so
[35:02] liberated to really speak his the full
[35:05] message that God had given him. He said
[35:07] they were just having a camp meeting
[35:09] every Sunday. And so that was I I really
[35:13] appreciated that. But we'll be doing
[35:15] this just for our uh the summer and from
[35:19] the 17th of June because then we're also
[35:24] very very busy preparing for the s for
[35:28] the convention. And there are people
[35:30] that are coming prior to the convention.
[35:33] They'll be coming the last latter part
[35:35] of June at different schedules and
[35:37] remaining after the convention. Some are
[35:40] not going till maybe the 10th or 11th or
[35:42] on into that week. We already have about
[35:45] 67
[35:46] confirmed ministers that are coming
[35:49] already and they're confirming as their
[35:51] visas become available. uh and uh
[35:54] brother Cesar who we were concerned
[35:57] about uh from Brazil. Brother Cesar H
[36:00] and his wife both got visas. We're very
[36:03] very delighted about that. And so we'll
[36:06] be receiving them early and we're going
[36:08] to have a very full schedule. So if
[36:10] you'll just remember starting June the
[36:13] 17th will be one service and it'll be
[36:16] through June, July, and August until
[36:18] school starts after our family camp.
[36:23] And so that is that uh that much of that
[36:27] schedule. Now before I uh
[36:32] say anything further about the uh the
[36:34] the trip because it was a very very full
[36:37] trip, a very
[36:39] very intense schedule and uh and I have
[36:44] some slides for you as well. But I'll
[36:46] ask you once more if you'll rise if you
[36:49] would please. And I want to have prayer.
[36:54] Father, as I stand before this audience
[36:57] of people today
[37:00] and those that have joined us in the
[37:03] invisible audience but not invisible to
[37:06] you, those that are streaming feeling a
[37:10] part of the service this morning. I want
[37:13] to thank you for the prayers that have
[37:15] been uttered. Oh God, as I and my wife
[37:18] were on duty elsewhere, and I pray,
[37:22] Father, that today you will uh place a
[37:26] blessing, a double portion upon the
[37:29] congregation, oh God, of your spirit.
[37:32] Without you, we testify we are nothing
[37:36] and we can do nothing. We can achieve
[37:39] nothing. Works means nothing. We need
[37:42] your Holy Spirit and we have your Holy
[37:45] Spirit. We need your word and we have
[37:48] your word and now we ask that your Holy
[37:51] Spirit will take that word and just
[37:54] cause it to be a a flame within us. Oh
[37:57] Lord, I pray that you will do a greater
[38:00] thing for each individual. And as we've
[38:03] already prayed, Lord, in the study, I
[38:06] pray that you will come in such a
[38:08] personal way. We have personal needs,
[38:11] Lord. Every person's need is different
[38:14] one from another. And Lord, who all are
[38:17] under the sound of my voice, I call upon
[38:20] you, oh God, in the name of Jesus
[38:24] Christ, that you will do something very
[38:26] special for each individual. And may we
[38:30] come with expectation today, Lord. We're
[38:33] not wanting to have a God of history. We
[38:36] don't want a God of the future. We want
[38:39] a God that is now and present with us. I
[38:42] pray, Father, for Brother Ron Peterson's
[38:44] brother. I ask, oh God, that you will
[38:47] visit uh Brother Don in a special way
[38:51] and that you will talk to him, that you
[38:53] will you'll draw him and woo him, oh
[38:56] God, touch him physically. And there may
[38:58] be other physical needs that are here,
[39:00] Lord, spiritual needs. I pray, oh God,
[39:03] you will meet them as we've already
[39:05] heard our brother Dier pray. But now,
[39:07] Lord, I want to blend my voice, oh God,
[39:10] with his voice and the voices of all
[39:13] that are here and say, "Oh God, here we
[39:16] are, Lord. We're here to hear from you
[39:18] and we're here to receive from you. Your
[39:21] will be done now in Jesus Christ's
[39:23] name." Amen. While you're still
[39:26] standing, I'm going to read scripture
[39:28] that we will turn to after the uh the
[39:33] slides have been presented, but we'll
[39:36] read it while we're now standing out of
[39:38] Genesis the 24th chapter
[39:48] and we will read from the
[39:52] uh 58th verse of a short reading. ing
[39:56] just the three verses 58, 59 and 60.
[40:02] And Eleazar has gone now and has
[40:07] uh found Rebecca
[40:09] and he's with Rebecca's family and he's
[40:13] told them that he doesn't want them to
[40:15] hinder him. He must return immediately.
[40:19] And they called Rebecca and said unto
[40:22] her, "Wilt thou go with this man?" And
[40:25] she said, "I will go." And they sent
[40:29] away Rebecca, their sister, and her
[40:32] nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his
[40:35] men. And they blessed Rebecca, and said
[40:38] unto her, "Thou art our sister. Be thou
[40:43] the mother of thousands of millions, and
[40:46] let thy seed possess the gate of those
[40:50] which hate them. Amen. God bless you.
[40:53] You have your seat. You'll remember
[40:55] those scriptures, please.
[40:57] when we'll be coming to the word
[40:59] shortly.
[41:05] We arrived in Usuzbekiststan
[41:08] uh in Tascant Usbekiststan
[41:11] and it was late in the evening uh
[41:15] it was right getting close to midnight
[41:18] actually around probably 10:30 11:00 in
[41:21] the evening
[41:22] and uh
[41:25] uh when we had arrived God so
[41:27] supernaturally had mercy on us and
[41:30] arranged a taxi for us and how it
[41:33] happened was
[41:35] uh my wife and I are just going out uh
[41:38] of the airport and I'm kind of one to
[41:42] kind of go with the flow, but our
[41:44] luggage was some of the last luggage to
[41:47] come off. I'm I'm uh I'll just wait with
[41:51] the slides please for a few moments if
[41:53] you don't mind as I want to give a
[41:56] little bit report here first and uh so
[42:01] uh because our bags were some of the
[42:03] last to come off. We came out of the
[42:06] airport last. We were just with the
[42:08] there was only a couple of the
[42:10] stragglers behind us or with us sort of
[42:12] thing. In fact is I think it was only
[42:14] one other couple. the whole plane load
[42:16] had already gone and dispensed with. And
[42:19] of course, you're in a new airport. So,
[42:20] we're just kind of following, you know,
[42:22] whoever whoever there's a few people.
[42:24] And I thought for certain that I'll find
[42:26] some airline ground staff there and
[42:29] there'll be a there will be somebody to
[42:31] speak to and I'll just ask them to
[42:34] assist me to get a taxi or a shuttle or
[42:37] whatever more into the city. Well,
[42:39] because our bags were the last coming or
[42:42] some of the last coming off. We were the
[42:44] last coming out of the airport and I
[42:46] just was going with the people. It's all
[42:48] kind of dark and not too well lit. And
[42:50] as we moved on, uh uh I I found myself
[42:54] outside. Uh you know, I was waiting.
[42:57] There were some people waiting to
[42:58] receive, you know, guests, etc. When I
[43:01] got outside, uh there was people waiting
[43:03] there, too. But I think they were like
[43:05] taxi drivers and I don't know who all
[43:07] just around the airport. Not a lot of
[43:09] them, but maybe 15, 20. And so when I
[43:13] got out there and I realized I'm outside
[43:16] and uh there is no counter to go to and
[43:19] there is no ground staff and there's
[43:20] nobody to ask and and and I'm just
[43:23] looking at a a group of men and I know
[43:25] that there are taxi drivers all looking
[43:28] to take somebody into town. So, uh, and
[43:31] I can't, uh, I certainly can't speak
[43:34] their language, and they, most of them
[43:35] speak Russian.
[43:38] So, there was a, a couple right beside
[43:40] me that had come off the plane. They
[43:41] were just like one step behind, and a
[43:44] young man greeted them, and I thought,
[43:46] well, that's their son. And I I just
[43:47] looked at them real quickly and it
[43:49] looked like uh it looked like maybe they
[43:51] looked a wee bit alike and they were
[43:53] definitely Europeans and uh or
[43:56] Americans, one or the other. And they
[43:57] were embracing and they were just having
[43:59] such a jubilee over seeing one another
[44:01] and all my and I I was in desperation.
[44:05] So right while they were hugging one
[44:07] another and just saying all of their
[44:08] nice things, I excuse me.
[44:11] and they kind of shocked and stopped.
[44:13] And I said, "We need to I I need some
[44:17] help to get a taxi to a hotel." And this
[44:21] tall young man who was greeting these
[44:23] people, he said, "Well, I'll help you."
[44:26] I said, "Oh, that's that's that's
[44:28] wonderful." Uh, I said, "Well, I said, I
[44:31] need to get a taxi to go into the into
[44:33] the into a hotel in the city." And he
[44:35] says, "Okay." So, he starts speaking to
[44:37] some of the men. this one comes and the
[44:39] other one comes and there's a
[44:40] conversation breaking up and they're
[44:42] all, you know, it's just a bunch of
[44:44] jabbering to me. And so I'm I'm just
[44:46] sitting there innocent. I said, "I'm
[44:48] sorry, you know, to this other couple.
[44:49] I'm sorry to interrupt your your
[44:51] greeting." Oh, they said, "That's fine."
[44:53] And uh and so he's busy and he's trying
[44:55] to, you know, converse with these
[44:57] people. And I can see even he's having a
[44:59] little bit of a struggle conversing with
[45:01] them. And and in in the den of the
[45:03] conversation, everything I hear kind of
[45:05] in a broken broken language, Eddie Bis.
[45:11] And and where'd that come from? you
[45:14] know, kind of I'm sitting here in the
[45:16] middle of this foreign country where
[45:18] that voice that sounded I didn't I
[45:19] couldn't even tell where it came from
[45:21] cuz all these men are kind of, you know,
[45:23] vying to get a a job driving us in. And
[45:28] uh so so this this man, he turns and he
[45:31] he and and he didn't even understand
[45:33] what those words meant. Idis, it was
[45:35] another language to him. And I said I
[45:38] said, "That's that's that's my name. Who
[45:40] who said that?" And then I heard, you
[45:42] know, pastor. And so this man turned to
[45:44] me, says, "Are you a pastor?" And I
[45:46] said, "Well, yeah, yeah, I am." He said,
[45:48] "Well, you know, this man," and I was
[45:50] looking at a young man's face and and uh
[45:52] and he was a believer. He'd been sent
[45:55] there to meet me, but he couldn't speak
[45:57] a word of English, and I couldn't speak
[45:58] a word of his language. And uh uh and
[46:02] and the man who was talking he I I
[46:06] learned later that he had been in
[46:07] Usuzbekiststan for 10 years. So he spoke
[46:10] Usuzbck, but this young man only spoke
[46:12] Russian and couldn't speak. So now we
[46:15] had a triangle of difficulties cuz they
[46:17] couldn't understand each other either.
[46:19] So they were trying to stumble around
[46:21] and he was trying to, you know, he was
[46:22] looking this way looking the taxi driver
[46:24] looking at me looking the young man has
[46:26] been sent to meet me and he just can't
[46:28] sort it out. And he said, "Look," he
[46:30] said, "I'll take you to the I'll take
[46:33] you to the uh to the hotel. I got a
[46:36] van." I said, "Well, can you do that? I
[46:38] don't want to put you out. It's quite a
[46:39] few miles." "No, no, no." He says, "I'll
[46:41] take you." He said, "I got a van. We'll
[46:43] just load everything in the van and I'll
[46:44] take you." So, in a few minutes here, I
[46:47] and my wife are in with this other
[46:49] couple who were on the airplane with us,
[46:51] with the man who met them, who I
[46:52] interrupted, and a fellow that I can't
[46:54] speak to and he can't speak to very
[46:57] well. and they're sitting in the front
[46:58] seat and we're all driving into task
[47:00] camp. And I thought, God, I think you
[47:03] your ways are way above my ways. And so
[47:07] I asked him, I said, "Well, you know,
[47:09] uh, well, how come you're here in how
[47:11] come you're here in uh, Usbekistsan for
[47:13] 10 years?" He said, "I'm a missionary."
[47:16] I said, "Well, wonderful. Praise the
[47:18] Lord." He says, "And the people I just
[47:19] met," he says, "that's our that's a
[47:21] pastor and his wife." Well, wonderful. I
[47:24] said, "Where are they from?" I said,
[47:25] "They're from Taber, Alberta." Oh my
[47:28] This is getting close to home. And they
[47:30] said, "And so I said to them, I said,
[47:31] "How do you know him? Is he your son?"
[47:34] "No, no," he said, "he's just a he he's
[47:36] a missionary from Alberta. He's from
[47:38] Calgary or Edmonton." "My goodness,
[47:40] you're speaking my language. You know, I
[47:43] understand this part of the world." And
[47:45] here we are all in a few minutes in a
[47:48] van driving into the hotel. And I just
[47:51] thought, you know, only one only one
[47:53] person can arrange that and that has to
[47:55] be God Almighty. And there I was on the
[47:58] airplane kind of concerned and worried
[48:00] about, you know, cuz I knew Brother
[48:02] Peter Ivan was coming over to be
[48:04] interpreter and to be with us and all
[48:05] the rest, but he wasn't arriving for
[48:07] another two days. And so we were going
[48:10] to just kind of rest and recuperate and
[48:13] get adjusted to the 12 hours change of
[48:15] time from here to to Usbekistan.
[48:19] And uh and so we got names, we exchanged
[48:23] the names and and he was trying to find
[48:25] out then from this young man, brother
[48:27] Dimma sitting in the front seat, you
[48:29] know, h you know, he was trying to get
[48:31] how are you connected? You know, you
[48:33] can't say a word to each other. So what
[48:35] is the connection? You don't have an and
[48:38] I could hear the I could hear the name
[48:40] brother coming up, you know, and so I
[48:43] was wondering, well, I wonder what kind
[48:45] of testimony this is. Anyway, some
[48:47] connection is being made and God, you
[48:50] you you do these things and we don't
[48:52] know what's happening exactly, but I
[48:54] just trust you for it. And so that's how
[48:56] our that's how we had a taxi prepared by
[48:59] God himself that took us to the airport.
[49:01] We arrested uh we arrested rather and
[49:04] adjusted to uh and we're almost arrested
[49:06] too. We took pictures where we
[49:08] shouldn't. And uh we waited for brother
[49:11] Ivano's uh arrival, brother Peter. And
[49:15] then uh brother Anatoli drove from uh
[49:19] Novi uh Novi it is and uh came it was a
[49:24] 7-hour drive and uh then he came to meet
[49:28] brother Peter and we all flew then to
[49:30] Bukar which is another city and from
[49:33] there it's about an hour hour and a half
[49:36] drive to Novi uh Novoy Novoy I'm sorry
[49:41] it is and there we had uh meetings We
[49:45] start with meeting on Friday. We arrived
[49:47] there Thursday. Had meeting Friday,
[49:48] Saturday, Sunday.
[49:51] And then Sunday evening, there's always
[49:54] big surprises. So, Brother
[49:58] Anatoli says, "My son is getting married
[50:00] on Sunday evening, and we want you to
[50:02] conduct the wedding." I said, "Well,
[50:04] that's quite impossible because I said,
[50:06] I can't to begin with. I, you know, I'm
[50:09] speaking through an interpreter." No,
[50:11] no, no. I said, "That's fine. That's
[50:12] what we want." He said, 'We want to see
[50:14] how you do a wedding and you know how
[50:17] how the believers do a wedding. And I
[50:18] said, 'N no, it won't be the way we do a
[50:21] wedding. I said, 'You just do it and
[50:22] I'll be there and bless the bless the
[50:25] couple with you. No, no, no, no. Please,
[50:27] brother, you have to do the wedding. So,
[50:30] uh, brother Peter Ivanenko became the
[50:32] official, uh, Russian marriage man, I I
[50:36] believe, because he he had to go through
[50:38] all the vows and everything, but he did
[50:40] a masterful job, and I was so thankful.
[50:43] Uh, I was thinking of you, brother
[50:45] Diddy, yesterday.
[50:48] He he uh he just did a masterful job of
[50:52] uh of uh helping us and being very
[50:55] present in all of the meetings. and
[50:57] about maybe 12 15 hours a day uh because
[51:01] he was right there at our side all the
[51:03] time in personal conversations with
[51:05] brother Anatoli and other deacons or
[51:08] officers of the church and whatever more
[51:10] and he was just uh indispensable. on
[51:13] Monday
[51:15] uh on Monday at 9:30 we had a meeting
[51:18] with the uh mayor of of the city of
[51:21] Navoy
[51:23] and uh and we had about a half an hour
[51:25] together and that was actually quite a
[51:27] critical meeting because I'll show you
[51:30] his picture in a few moments but uh it's
[51:34] so God's ways are so supernatural and I
[51:37] want to take enough time just to share
[51:39] this with you if you don't mind brother
[51:42] Uh, brother Anatoli
[51:46] came to the knowledge of the message
[51:47] while he was a a pastor, Pentecostal
[51:51] pastor of a group. So when he came to
[51:54] the message,
[51:57] uh, the bishop in Taz Kent apparently
[52:02] came to the government and said,
[52:04] "There's a a cult group that has risen
[52:08] up and they need to be shut down."
[52:11] and uh and they're not registered.
[52:14] So, a letter came from the ministry of
[52:17] ed of of religion
[52:21] to the mayor and the mayor called up
[52:25] brother Anatoli. It turns out that the
[52:28] mayor and brother Anatoli worked
[52:31] together as young men in the same
[52:33] factory for 10 years and they were
[52:36] buddies.
[52:38] They were real close friends. And so he
[52:41] calls brother Anatoli and said, "Anati,
[52:44] we have a problem and you you need to
[52:47] come here. I need to see you." So when
[52:49] he saw him, he says, "You see this
[52:51] letter?" He said, "You know, they're
[52:53] going to shut you down. So you have to
[52:55] do something." So then he traveled,
[52:58] brother Anatoli traveled to Tashant, saw
[53:01] the authorities and said, "We're not
[53:04] we're not a fact is we do things
[53:07] according to the scripture that the
[53:08] bishop and his group doesn't do." And he
[53:11] went to the bishop and told them,
[53:13] "Listen, you know, you call us a cult.
[53:16] You're the people that don't even
[53:17] baptize according to the scripture. The
[53:20] scripture says you baptize him in the
[53:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you
[53:23] don't do that." And so he he was able to
[53:27] he just came he faced the thing right
[53:30] front you know face to face with the
[53:33] right people and then applied for
[53:35] registration for their church and became
[53:39] uh they became registered in uh and we
[53:42] did know that they had be we knew that
[53:44] they had become registered but we didn't
[53:45] know how it had happened and so I just
[53:47] wanted to fill you in with that because
[53:49] brother Tony and he and sister Rebecca
[53:52] came back had given us the information
[53:54] that they had become registered and I
[53:55] knew that but I didn't know all of the
[53:57] details and I thought this was marvelous
[53:59] because God once again doing it his own
[54:02] way. Isn't that wonderful? And he just
[54:04] had and little would we know that maybe
[54:08] 20 years ago you're working beside
[54:10] somebody who one day is going to be in a
[54:13] key position not a believer but in a key
[54:16] position to on behalf of the message and
[54:18] on behalf of the gospel. God's ways are
[54:21] wonderful.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he arranges things. He's even
[54:24] doing it now which we're not aware of.
[54:28] And so we had this uh very fine meeting
[54:30] with the with the mayor. Uh and then on
[54:34] Monday after that we spent between five
[54:36] and six hours with the trustees and the
[54:39] deacons and their wives. And then
[54:42] Tuesday we traveled to Buchar and then
[54:45] traveled on to Taz Kent from there.
[54:48] Brother uh Peter was with us now. And on
[54:51] Wednesday, uh, brother Anatoli after
[54:55] taking us to Buchar, then he drove back
[54:58] home and and then drove all night to
[55:02] drive to Taz Kent because he wanted to
[55:04] go to the US embassy and try and get
[55:07] visa for his wife and son. He has a visa
[55:10] for America and he and anyone who has a
[55:13] visa for United States can pretty well
[55:15] automatically get one for Canada because
[55:17] the immigration process has has become
[55:20] pretty well seamless and so they can
[55:22] just go to the embassy in in Seattle and
[55:24] get visa for Canada but he didn't have a
[55:27] visa for his wife or his son and he
[55:29] wanted them both to come and be here at
[55:31] the convention and that was quite an
[55:33] experience. We never got into the uh
[55:36] into the embassy. However, brother Peter
[55:39] did and uh and then we got them an
[55:42] appointment. We don't know just exactly.
[55:44] They have now an earlier appointment and
[55:46] that was the purpose of getting them
[55:48] there. So, we pretty well spent
[55:49] Wednesday doing that. Thursday, we flew
[55:51] to Frankfurt and were met by brother
[55:53] Rodel.
[55:55] Roald who met us and uh drove we drove
[55:58] then to Beaslesburg. They had prepared a
[56:01] real lovely uh uh apartment there and
[56:04] Beaslesburg is just real quiet uh
[56:06] village of a thousand people on the edge
[56:08] of the uh black forest and they have the
[56:11] apartment supplied with food and flowers
[56:14] and you know nice things for us and it
[56:16] was just really really lovely and I I
[56:19] want to say that we are so grateful to
[56:21] brother Rodel and and his uh sister and
[56:25] his wife for their hospitality. It was
[56:28] just uh they just did everything that
[56:30] was possible to do for us and to let us
[56:34] get be ready for the meeting. We were
[56:36] also very much encouraged and
[56:38] strengthened to have brother Chris and
[56:40] Sister Sigret Peterson come and be
[56:42] there. It was always an encouragement
[56:44] when you see uh someone from home and we
[56:48] were strengthened by their presence. uh
[56:50] we had meetings uh four meetings in
[56:52] Germany Saturday night, Sunday morning,
[56:55] Sunday evening and on Monday morning and
[56:59] then we met with the ministers after the
[57:02] after the Monday service as well on into
[57:04] Monday evening. Then they had a a
[57:07] lunchon with the ministers and uh
[57:10] meeting with them from different they're
[57:12] from different countries several
[57:13] different countries and there were about
[57:15] eight or nine uh countries where the
[57:17] people came from. It came from Poland,
[57:20] Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, France,
[57:22] Lithuania, and so on. But we so
[57:24] appreciated our time there. And brother
[57:26] Rutald will be coming with uh one of uh
[57:31] a brother that's been assisting him, a
[57:33] young man that he cultivated up.
[57:34] Actually, he's a Russian brother. His
[57:38] name is Brother Sergey, and he speaks
[57:41] German fluently. So he has been brother
[57:43] Rotoald's personal interpreter and has
[57:46] been ministering and been working in the
[57:48] office. But uh and you can pray for
[57:52] brother Sergey if you would. Uh he had
[57:56] received an invitation more than an
[57:59] invitation a request to come and pastor
[58:02] uh the church in Moscow. And so brother
[58:05] Roald was struggling with that at the
[58:07] time. Uh
[58:10] we also had a it was a real pleasant
[58:15] thing for both I and my wife. We had an
[58:18] opportunity to meet uh the saints that
[58:20] stream and they stream I believe every
[58:23] Sunday from Switzerland our morning
[58:26] service now. No doubt they are and I
[58:28] would like to just greet them because
[58:31] they they have felt so close to us and
[58:35] and uh you know you can't say everything
[58:39] but we had an opportunity to meet them
[58:40] and we've caught a few emails from them
[58:43] not many but just a few and now we're
[58:45] able to see their face and when uh
[58:47] brother Jason
[58:49] uh Ashdown stood here and told the
[58:53] testimony how God had after I think
[58:56] about eight years had given conception
[59:00] to Sister Emmy and uh and that they had
[59:03] a child. Here was this couple, one of
[59:06] the couples and it was actually
[59:08] son-in-law to the to the first couple
[59:12] that were beginning to stream and these
[59:15] other people were not streaming. their
[59:17] son-in-law was not streaming, but he
[59:19] told them, he said, "You you should, you
[59:21] know, we're being very blessed by these
[59:23] meetings." And, you know, things happen
[59:24] in people's lives and maybe they feel
[59:27] just a wee bit cautious, but so they
[59:29] decided to stream and and and then they
[59:33] get they get really gripped by the
[59:37] atmosphere and the word and the
[59:39] ministry.
[59:40] And then here in the song service,
[59:43] Brother Jason gives testimony. And here
[59:45] they are 12 years. I believe it's 12
[59:48] years and his wife's barren and have
[59:52] been prayed for. And so they took heart
[59:55] and said, "Look what God has done." They
[59:58] took heart and said, "Now we will, you
[1:00:00] know, we'll be prayed for again." And
[1:00:02] here they embraced a child. And brother
[1:00:05] Jason said to Emma, I Emmy, I was able
[1:00:07] to just just put my hand on the cheek of
[1:00:10] that child and say, you know, the
[1:00:12] promise of God answering faith. And I
[1:00:14] was really thankful. That was just
[1:00:16] really really special. And so it was a
[1:00:19] real joy to see them face to face. I
[1:00:21] appreciate that. Can I just go through
[1:00:23] these slides quickly with you now? And
[1:00:26] uh I don't want to take up too much
[1:00:29] time, but we don't also we don't want to
[1:00:31] be too time conscious. I won't be any
[1:00:34] longer than we need to be.
[1:00:39] So that's brother uh brother Anatoli and
[1:00:42] brother Peter just in the restaurant
[1:00:45] there. This is the hotel in the hotel
[1:00:48] lobby when we met uh of the believers
[1:00:54] part of the congregation.
[1:00:57] That's the way they have their song
[1:00:58] service. They have several that are are
[1:01:00] leading. That's uh more of the
[1:01:03] congregation from the other side
[1:01:06] worshiping
[1:01:07] uh brother Peter translating for me
[1:01:13] and uh is just to give you some idea of
[1:01:17] the and this building uh I just stop
[1:01:20] here for a moment they have u uh during
[1:01:25] the Soviet rule they had apartments that
[1:01:28] they provided for workers and Apartments
[1:01:31] were almost given to the people free. So
[1:01:35] you have these apartments four or five
[1:01:36] stories high and then in between the
[1:01:39] apartments is like a little area with
[1:01:41] some trees, a large sandbox for
[1:01:44] children, a closed lines if the ladies
[1:01:47] like to hang out their clothes. And so
[1:01:49] it's just a little people space between
[1:01:52] each of these apartments. These are long
[1:01:55] apartment blocks. And actually it was
[1:01:57] very very nice. They had it arranged.
[1:01:59] Well, between this one block of
[1:02:01] apartments was a huge um public washroom
[1:02:06] where people could go from their
[1:02:08] factories etc and shower. But because
[1:02:11] each apartment had their own bathroom
[1:02:13] and shower in them even though they're
[1:02:15] quite sparse and and so this place this
[1:02:19] building became a place that was just in
[1:02:21] total disrepair. It was just dirty and
[1:02:24] tore down and was coming apart. And so,
[1:02:28] Brother Anatoli, when he was being put
[1:02:31] out and was seeing the message, this
[1:02:34] place was sitting between two of these
[1:02:37] apartments. And it's really, you can see
[1:02:39] the size of the building, but they had
[1:02:41] to do enormous amount of work. The
[1:02:43] ceiling was not nearly as high as you
[1:02:45] see it right now. And so he went to the
[1:02:49] authorities and said, "Listen, you know,
[1:02:50] this was a big public washroom. It's a
[1:02:53] it's a it's an eyesore. It's just a
[1:02:55] terrible site here, and we would like to
[1:02:57] fix it up, but we need it for a church,
[1:03:00] and so we'd like you to give it to us.
[1:03:01] It's still for the people, and and if
[1:03:04] you'll give us this, we'll fix it up."
[1:03:06] So they actually gave him this site, and
[1:03:09] this is the place he's had, this church.
[1:03:11] They had to pay for all the work and
[1:03:13] everything else. And actually you
[1:03:14] assisted a wee bit here from the church
[1:03:16] as well for them. But but this is the
[1:03:18] building that God has given them. And
[1:03:20] underneath they got a a small balcony
[1:03:23] and underneath it's unfinished and it's
[1:03:26] a very old but underneath is a is a full
[1:03:28] full basement that is unfinished. No
[1:03:31] floor in it. But it was wonderful that
[1:03:33] God gave them uh this place is one of
[1:03:35] the officers of the church. This brother
[1:03:37] here and his wife. They just uh I I
[1:03:40] really felt for him. He's come from a
[1:03:43] very hard life and he's a caretaker.
[1:03:45] Kind of looks after the place every day,
[1:03:49] but he lives with his with three other
[1:03:53] families in a in a in an apartment.
[1:03:58] And uh another one of the brothers, two
[1:04:01] brothers at work, one brother I believe
[1:04:04] is a deacon. The first brother
[1:04:08] uh they were having prayer with us at
[1:04:10] this time. Here's some of the children
[1:04:13] singing.
[1:04:15] Their children are so much like our
[1:04:17] children. Brothers giving a dedication
[1:04:20] of a child. And uh that is actually
[1:04:23] their song leader there that's handing
[1:04:25] his child to brother Anatoli.
[1:04:33] Here's the baptismal started. And I was
[1:04:36] very impressed with the baptismals. I
[1:04:38] wasn't there at the site because this
[1:04:40] was far from the city and I was
[1:04:43] preparing for the evening service, but
[1:04:46] they baptized 19 people
[1:04:49] and I thought that was wonderful. That's
[1:04:51] not a result of our meeting. That's a
[1:04:53] result of his work and I thought that
[1:04:56] was wonderful. It went right from a a
[1:04:59] teenager, but most of them are adults.
[1:05:02] And he said 60% of them were Muslims.
[1:05:08] And the eldest lady was 83 years old and
[1:05:11] could not wait to get baptized. So I
[1:05:14] said, "Praise God for that."
[1:05:18] Oh, let me just go back here a moment.
[1:05:21] This is the brother right here. Uh the
[1:05:27] Yeah, second from the right in the blue
[1:05:30] jeans. He was the one who was waiting at
[1:05:32] the airport. His name is brother Dimma.
[1:05:36] And that's about all I can say about
[1:05:39] him.
[1:05:42] This is brother
[1:05:45] the bride uh that brother Anatoli's now
[1:05:49] his daughter-in-law. That's her father.
[1:05:52] And I think he's one of the trustees or
[1:05:54] deacons of the church. He's one of the
[1:05:55] officers of the church. Uh and uh so
[1:06:00] we're praying here for the couple in the
[1:06:02] wedding. That's brother Anatoli's son.
[1:06:07] And here's uh their group of young
[1:06:10] people singing,
[1:06:12] children singing.
[1:06:14] This is also the group that were
[1:06:16] baptized. Now they called them all
[1:06:18] forward, gave their names and gave each
[1:06:20] one of them a a flower, presented them
[1:06:23] with a flower or a small bouquet in
[1:06:26] remembrance of their baptismal, which
[1:06:28] was very nice. as one of the trustees,
[1:06:32] uh, main deacons. On the premises also
[1:06:35] is a is an oven. Actually, a little
[1:06:38] bakery and three young fellas run this
[1:06:41] bakery. They're not I don't believe
[1:06:43] they're members of the congregation, but
[1:06:46] they make bread every day uh in this
[1:06:50] bakery and then the people come out and
[1:06:53] uh and pick up this bread and I can tell
[1:06:55] you it is a really wonderful bread. Uh
[1:06:59] while we were at uh one of the visiting
[1:07:02] at one of the people's places, they
[1:07:03] said, "We'll show you a silkworm
[1:07:04] factory." And this was it. Those are
[1:07:07] silk worms
[1:07:09] uh producing silk and they eat these uh
[1:07:13] mulberry tree branches and they're
[1:07:15] they're taking big loads of these
[1:07:18] branches into these places and then they
[1:07:20] just get it's u just sage brush and
[1:07:25] these uh silkworms go into the sage
[1:07:27] brush and then you see the cocoon there
[1:07:28] and and that's where they get silk. Uh
[1:07:32] this is the
[1:07:35] might look like the interior of a lovely
[1:07:37] hotel. This is the subway in Tash Kent.
[1:07:41] And I tell you, it is clean. Big
[1:07:44] chandeliers hanging all down. You won't
[1:07:46] find any subway like that in North
[1:07:48] America, I don't think. And there's
[1:07:51] another shot of it with a train and a
[1:07:53] woman sweeping. And we took uh we took
[1:07:56] two shots and had the police right in
[1:07:58] front of us. You don't not supposed to
[1:08:01] take pictures of the subway. And uh
[1:08:04] another refreshing thing is uh you could
[1:08:07] scarcely see a woman in a pair of pants.
[1:08:10] They're all in dresses and a lot of them
[1:08:12] lot of them long probably over 50 60% of
[1:08:15] them. Uh the the area there is is what
[1:08:19] was known as the Silk Road coming from
[1:08:22] uh Asia. And uh and th this place here,
[1:08:27] this this gate, behind this gate was
[1:08:30] actually a stomping place on the Silk
[1:08:33] Road. And across the road from it is a
[1:08:37] well. And this is a well. We read about
[1:08:40] Rebecca coming to the well. It may have
[1:08:42] been like this because it's the same
[1:08:45] kind of the same idea. down inside here
[1:08:49] uh
[1:08:51] down from where Sister Biscll is
[1:08:53] standing is the water in there and they
[1:08:57] build that dome up over it and that is
[1:09:00] the well at 9:30 on uh Monday morning I
[1:09:04] said I met with the mayor this is the
[1:09:05] mayor of Navoi and there he is with his
[1:09:08] good friend so it's more than just a
[1:09:11] meeting it was a wonderful opportunity
[1:09:13] to confirm to the mayor
[1:09:16] that uh of the message and he said that
[1:09:19] he has seen the DV he said I've seen the
[1:09:21] DV DVD of the church and the meeting
[1:09:24] that uh an brother Anatoli spoke there
[1:09:27] and here we are sitting on the floor
[1:09:30] they put the normally they put the food
[1:09:32] on the floor they said but they put it
[1:09:34] up about 8 10 in so we could get our
[1:09:36] legs under the table we're sitting on
[1:09:39] the floor with a cushion behind our back
[1:09:41] and that's fine but we were there for
[1:09:44] about 3 hours.
[1:09:46] Uh that was before we had a break and
[1:09:49] then we had a break and went to the
[1:09:51] silkware farm just down the street and
[1:09:53] came back and sat there for another two
[1:09:54] hours. So we were in that room at that
[1:09:58] table for 5 hours and now they asked me
[1:10:02] to speak to the trustees and the deacons
[1:10:05] and so on. So uh that's what we did.
[1:10:09] an abundance of uh nuts and raisins and
[1:10:12] so on in the marketplace and uh
[1:10:16] that's it.
[1:10:19] So now you have a little bit of an idea.
[1:10:20] You've been to Usuzbekistan.
[1:10:23] God bless you. All right,
[1:10:31] I think we did pretty well. took about
[1:10:34] 15 20 minutes and give you a bit of an
[1:10:36] idea.
[1:10:43] Let's just have a a word of prayer once
[1:10:45] more, please.
[1:10:48] Lord, it has been our
[1:10:51] uh great privilege to be able to uphold
[1:10:53] your name in other places as well as
[1:10:57] home. But here we are at our post of
[1:11:00] duty and we confess that we can do
[1:11:03] nothing here unless you guide us. We
[1:11:07] have already sanctified this day and set
[1:11:09] it aside for you
[1:11:12] this evening. Lord, as our brother Lance
[1:11:14] will come, we've already prayed for that
[1:11:15] service. We've prayed for him. We've
[1:11:18] prayed for the congregation. And now,
[1:11:21] Lord, I pray for them and for myself
[1:11:23] that you will now give words of
[1:11:25] utterance. We thank you for the
[1:11:27] testimony of this people and I pray that
[1:11:30] the light may shine out from this place
[1:11:33] many many places throughout the world is
[1:11:35] my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:38] Amen.
[1:11:41] And they called Rebecca
[1:11:43] and said to her, "Wilt thou go with this
[1:11:46] man?" And she said, "I will go.
[1:11:49] I want to speak to you this morning and
[1:11:52] I have already felt the divine presence
[1:11:55] of God as I as I studied not only on
[1:11:59] this subject but as I had prayer before
[1:12:02] I came into the platform. I just felt a
[1:12:06] very sweet and wonderful close presence
[1:12:09] of the Lord. And I've asked the Lord
[1:12:12] that he will convey that to each of you
[1:12:15] on a personal basis. We don't want a
[1:12:18] historical God. We need a God that is
[1:12:22] with us right now and here. A God that
[1:12:25] is doing supernatural things. And I'm
[1:12:28] absolutely determined that that's the
[1:12:30] way it must be.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:12:34] I want to speak to you and I've given a
[1:12:37] title to this subject and it simply is a
[1:12:40] clearcut
[1:12:42] and correct decision. Brother Brandham
[1:12:45] makes reference to Rebecca and he said
[1:12:48] it was a clearcut. He makes reference to
[1:12:50] Ruth also. It was a clear-cut decision.
[1:12:54] Don't ask me to leave you. Ruth said to
[1:12:56] Naomi, "Your people will be my people.
[1:13:00] Your God will be my God. Where you live,
[1:13:03] I'll live. Where you die, I'll die. Your
[1:13:06] land will be my land." It was a clearcut
[1:13:09] decision. And I was impressed with that.
[1:13:11] He speaks of a clear-cut. And uh I've
[1:13:14] added correct decision because I'm even
[1:13:17] going to add another couple adjectives
[1:13:19] to that as we move along. We are faced
[1:13:23] with constantly every day. Every person
[1:13:27] is faced with having to make decisions.
[1:13:31] We make decisions. Some are more
[1:13:33] important than other decisions. When we
[1:13:36] travel such as we have just on this
[1:13:38] trip, we're always interested in finding
[1:13:41] out what the weather is like and what is
[1:13:44] the expected uh conditions that we are
[1:13:48] going to be faced with because we're
[1:13:50] making decisions based on you're going
[1:13:53] to make a journey. You make a decision
[1:13:55] based on the weather. You might make a
[1:13:57] decision that's based on your finances.
[1:14:00] You make a decision that's based on
[1:14:02] other personal matters. And we are
[1:14:05] always faced with decisions. We we are
[1:14:08] faced with decisions about where are we
[1:14:10] going to live, where are we going to
[1:14:13] move. Uh we need to have uh we need to
[1:14:16] have into consideration where our
[1:14:19] children are going to go to school or
[1:14:22] where is the church. And these are
[1:14:24] fairly important decisions. There are
[1:14:27] some decisions which are even much more
[1:14:30] important than that. And that is there
[1:14:32] are some decisions we only make once in
[1:14:35] our life. There are decisions concerning
[1:14:37] marriage and those are very critical
[1:14:40] decisions. But the decision about I will
[1:14:44] go that that decision that Rebecca made
[1:14:48] she only made once and then all other
[1:14:52] decisions became subject to that one
[1:14:54] decision. Will you go with this man? I
[1:14:58] will go. And it was over. Amen.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Didn't matter whether it was a camel or
[1:15:03] a Cadillac or whether it was she going
[1:15:07] to live in a tent or live in a palace.
[1:15:09] She didn't ask, "What are what's it
[1:15:11] going to be like when I get there? What
[1:15:13] am I to expect? What does he expect of
[1:15:16] me?" She just said the decision was,
[1:15:18] "Will you go with this man?" And her
[1:15:21] quick clear-cut decision and a correct
[1:15:24] decision was that I will go. It's only
[1:15:27] made once in a lifetime. And it changes
[1:15:30] the course. It changed the course of her
[1:15:34] life forever.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; And not only her life, but it changed
[1:15:38] the course of the life of many others.
[1:15:41] And I want you to just hold that in your
[1:15:44] mind as we move through this decisions.
[1:15:47] When it comes to a major or major
[1:15:51] spiritual decision, let it be known to
[1:15:55] every person here. Your decision is not
[1:15:58] just to yourself. Your decision will
[1:16:02] affect the lives of others, many others
[1:16:05] in fact around you. And God has ordained
[1:16:09] it to be that way. Now, brother Brandham
[1:16:13] referred to her time, this Rebecca's
[1:16:17] decision, and he said that that she was
[1:16:21] called to a decision time. You see
[1:16:24] sometimes it is not even uh circumst
[1:16:27] your circumstances it may be
[1:16:29] circumstances and often it is that God
[1:16:32] has arranged and God brings you to a
[1:16:36] decision time. In fact is when that
[1:16:38] happens you may think that you can be
[1:16:41] neutral but you cannot be neutral.
[1:16:44] Brother Brandham also said about the
[1:16:46] people that were in the service and I'm
[1:16:48] going to say it to you that are here
[1:16:49] this morning. You'll make a decision
[1:16:52] before you leave this building.
[1:16:55] You'll decide that I believe that word.
[1:16:58] You'll decide. The pastors asked me to
[1:17:01] pray. I am going to pray. I'm going to
[1:17:04] take that to heart. You'll decide on how
[1:17:07] the service how the Holy Spirit I know
[1:17:10] before coming here to the service that
[1:17:13] the Holy Spirit is going to take this
[1:17:15] subject and deliver it to your doorstep.
[1:17:18] and you're going to look at it and say,
[1:17:20] "Now, what do I do with it?"
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; And you're going to be forced to a
[1:17:24] decision. You won't be able to remain
[1:17:26] neutral. And and and the prophet said,
[1:17:29] and I'll say it this morning, it's
[1:17:31] impossible, impossible for you to walk
[1:17:33] out of these doors the same as you
[1:17:35] walked in.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; It's good that we're brought to a
[1:17:41] decision. It's good that we're faced
[1:17:43] with decisions. It's not bad. It's
[1:17:45] wonderful that God would that listen,
[1:17:48] there's multitudes of other people that
[1:17:51] wish they were sitting in your seat this
[1:17:53] morning.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Lots of people wish they were sitting in
[1:17:55] your seat. Wish they could hear
[1:17:57] something with hope,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; something that's positive, something
[1:18:02] that we know has been done. And we know
[1:18:04] that God did it.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; God brought this message. God vindicated
[1:18:11] it. We didn't have any hand in that. God
[1:18:14] brought it in our season. Brought it in
[1:18:16] our time. Those of you that are young
[1:18:18] people and you say, "Well, I'm here
[1:18:20] because my parents are here." You want
[1:18:22] to thank God your parents ever heard
[1:18:24] this word and that you've been brought
[1:18:26] up in such a home. Hallelujah. You want
[1:18:29] to thank God that God had that kind of
[1:18:31] grace upon your life so that you can
[1:18:34] say, "I didn't do a thing. God brought
[1:18:36] it by my way. But now, because he
[1:18:38] brought it by my way, I can't remain
[1:18:40] neutral. I have to make a decision about
[1:18:43] this and my decision shall be the same
[1:18:46] as Rebecca's decision. I will go
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; and it'll be clear-cut and it'll be
[1:18:53] sudden and it'll be irrevocable.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; This cannot be changed. I'm making my
[1:19:00] decision and my decision is to I will go
[1:19:05] with this man. This man, the Lord Jesus
[1:19:08] Christ, this man. And God sent a man to
[1:19:11] this generation and I'm not ashamed to
[1:19:14] say I've heard what brother Brandham has
[1:19:16] said and I'm following that
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; and my life has been greatly blessed.
[1:19:22] Other people can say whatever they want
[1:19:24] to say. I say the blessings of God, the
[1:19:27] blessings of Abra, the God of Abraham,
[1:19:29] Isaac, and Jacob, the blessings of that
[1:19:32] God,
[1:19:33] any supernatural being that can stand at
[1:19:36] the pullpit and tell a man the secrets
[1:19:39] of the hearts of the people and give
[1:19:41] them a solution to their dilemma and
[1:19:44] their and their questions and their
[1:19:46] confusion, such as it was to myself. I
[1:19:49] serve that kind of God. That's the kind
[1:19:51] of God that I want. He'll be God of my
[1:19:54] life and I'll say I will go with this
[1:19:56] man.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; A decision is the actual act of
[1:20:03] deciding.
[1:20:06] It is a decisive result.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; It is the quality of being positive and
[1:20:12] firm.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; But not waffling around. Well, you know,
[1:20:17] God hates that kind of thing. Quite
[1:20:20] frankly, I don't care for it either. I
[1:20:22] like people, well, maybe I think it's
[1:20:24] all right. You know, I kind of
[1:20:25] sympathize with it. And I I just don't
[1:20:28] get off with that kind of thing. I like
[1:20:30] a person that sees the issue and says,
[1:20:33] "I'll go with this. I'll decide for
[1:20:35] this. I'm going to be affirmative about
[1:20:38] this. I'm going to be positive about it
[1:20:40] and I'm going to be firm with it. My
[1:20:42] decision will not change."
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:49] And a a decision is the ability to
[1:20:51] choose or decide about things in a clear
[1:20:54] and definite way without too much
[1:20:57] hesitation or delay. And I think any
[1:20:59] hesitation or delay is too much.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; When Rebecca started out that morning,
[1:21:07] she could not even begin to have
[1:21:10] imagined what her day was going to bring
[1:21:14] her. just couldn't even have imagined in
[1:21:16] her wildest dreams.
[1:21:20] She just going to get water going in her
[1:21:23] normal normal course of life. And that's
[1:21:26] the same with you and I. We don't know.
[1:21:29] You didn't know this morning when you
[1:21:31] got up that that brother Bis was going
[1:21:33] to speak upon decisions. And there isn't
[1:21:35] a person here that's not faced with some
[1:21:38] kind of decision. And some of them much
[1:21:40] more important than others. Some of them
[1:21:42] are critical because they don't only
[1:21:43] involve you, they involve others.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; But those that involve the dealing of
[1:21:49] God in your life are is far far more
[1:21:53] important.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; She could not have imagined that before
[1:21:58] that day
[1:22:00] before that day was before the sunset
[1:22:02] that day that her life was going to be
[1:22:05] turned completely upside down. And this
[1:22:08] was, I will say, the the the single most
[1:22:12] important decision of her entire life.
[1:22:15] She would be made that day. Will you go
[1:22:18] with this man? She said, "I will go."
[1:22:25] Now, I I realize that we have a mixed
[1:22:27] audience. When I say mixed, I'm not
[1:22:29] talking about male female. I'm talking
[1:22:30] about people at different places,
[1:22:33] different positions in their spiritual
[1:22:36] walk.
[1:22:38] Some here may not even be born again.
[1:22:42] That is very true. Some here, and when I
[1:22:45] speak of this, I want you to think of
[1:22:49] the
[1:22:50] your physical being, your individual
[1:22:54] being. You are the same as the
[1:22:58] tabernacle in the wilderness because the
[1:23:00] tabernacle in the wilderness was only a
[1:23:04] shadow of the place where God will dwell
[1:23:07] because he told he told Moses, you'll
[1:23:09] make a certain kind of a tabernacle that
[1:23:11] I will dwell there and I'll be with
[1:23:14] these people. The purpose was in that
[1:23:16] tabernacle be a place where God and the
[1:23:18] people could have a contact. And the
[1:23:21] high priest was the critical part had to
[1:23:23] have the prophet and the priest. And the
[1:23:25] high priest would go in and with blood
[1:23:28] uh sprinkling the blood on the vessels
[1:23:31] etc. And he would go in from the outer
[1:23:33] court to the inner court and to the holy
[1:23:36] of holies. And in the holy of holies
[1:23:39] that was the place that God would meet
[1:23:41] the people. Now uh and I would just like
[1:23:44] to say this morning we have within a
[1:23:47] congregation we have outer court outer
[1:23:50] court dwellers that is in the outer
[1:23:52] courts and people some they just dwell
[1:23:55] in the outer court. Brother Brandham
[1:23:57] says they hunger for God. They love to
[1:24:00] fellowship they love to worship. They
[1:24:03] will do all of those things but he said
[1:24:05] and and they and they eat the mana. They
[1:24:08] eat the mana, but the mana doesn't hold
[1:24:11] for them. Their experience doesn't hold.
[1:24:15] It's up and then it's down. And they
[1:24:17] feel full and then they feel empty. And
[1:24:20] it's up and down and up and down. And
[1:24:22] it's a very, very unpredictable life.
[1:24:25] That's outer court dweller. And then
[1:24:27] there's an inner court dweller dweller.
[1:24:30] The next court, inner court. And in the
[1:24:32] inner court, uh, let me just compare.
[1:24:34] The outer court had no roof on it. It
[1:24:37] had no covering. And so if the sun was
[1:24:40] shining like we have today, it was a
[1:24:43] beautiful day. This is a good day. The
[1:24:45] sun's shining and I feel great. I feel
[1:24:48] good. This is a wonderful day. I feel
[1:24:50] upbeat. What's that got to do with it?
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; I feel great. Things have happened and
[1:24:57] it's it's really good and the sun is
[1:24:59] shining.
[1:25:02] But the next inner court, it had a
[1:25:05] better light because it was a
[1:25:07] candlestick. And the candlestick, but
[1:25:10] the even brother Brandham says the
[1:25:11] candlestick wasn't a perfect light
[1:25:13] because it had to have oil. Had to keep
[1:25:16] pouring oil into it. And if it ever run
[1:25:18] out of oil, ever run out of that, then
[1:25:21] the light went out. And so it was it was
[1:25:24] a better place, but it wasn't the
[1:25:26] perfect place. And then you you're still
[1:25:30] subjected to, you know, maybe go
[1:25:32] faithful for a while and then things run
[1:25:35] out and it seems like the spirit runs
[1:25:38] out. And in these two courts, you know,
[1:25:40] there are places where we are we are
[1:25:42] being dictated to by maybe our feelings.
[1:25:45] Somebody hurt me or somebody uh didn't
[1:25:48] do me right and and and and we're
[1:25:51] wounded by something. And that kind of
[1:25:53] stays there. And as time goes on, then
[1:25:56] we our oil seems to run out, our joy
[1:25:59] runs out, our peace runs out, we become
[1:26:02] distressed, we become filled with
[1:26:04] anxiety and all of these things, and I I
[1:26:07] want to say this morning, and I'm coming
[1:26:09] to it far earlier than I wanted to, but
[1:26:12] anybody that's dwelling in the outer
[1:26:14] court where, you know, we we enjoy the
[1:26:16] fellowship, we have the services, and my
[1:26:18] friends are there, my peers are there,
[1:26:20] etc., etc. You know, this is kind of our
[1:26:23] circle. This is our kind of our
[1:26:25] environment. But but but it it doesn't
[1:26:28] hold. That won't hold. You can have
[1:26:30] wonderful friendship and wonderful
[1:26:31] fellowship in the church, but that won't
[1:26:33] hold you. Those things will change.
[1:26:36] Those conditions will change. You might
[1:26:38] say, "Oh, I love the worship in the
[1:26:39] church. It's really enthusiastic, and I
[1:26:42] love to get there and sing." That'll
[1:26:44] change.
[1:26:46] Those things don't hold. Say, "Oh, I
[1:26:48] love this brother preaching. I love that
[1:26:50] brother preaching. I love brother Fiscus
[1:26:52] preaching. I love brother Tom or brother
[1:26:54] Lance's preaching or brother Dia or
[1:26:56] whoever more. Brother brother brother
[1:26:58] John and brother Tony and I I you know
[1:27:01] we have our favorite that'll change
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; cuz they're not there forever. But
[1:27:06] there's one thing that will not change
[1:27:08] and that is when a person makes their
[1:27:10] decision a firm decision. I will follow
[1:27:15] I will go this direction. this revealed
[1:27:18] Christ, the son of man has been revealed
[1:27:21] in this prophet's ministry, I will
[1:27:23] follow that
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; and that will not change.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; So, we get, you know, we have these
[1:27:32] things and there are things that you you
[1:27:34] need to think about, you know, if
[1:27:36] everything's going right and
[1:27:38] everything's going good, but what
[1:27:40] happens when everything becomes
[1:27:41] negative? What happens if the whole
[1:27:43] thing crumbles and collapses on you? You
[1:27:45] know, we've had a a roaring economy and
[1:27:48] it's been all great and everybody's
[1:27:50] doing fine and making big salaries and
[1:27:52] what happens if that if that goes the
[1:27:55] the reverse? What happens if the house
[1:27:57] you have becomes worth only half of what
[1:28:00] it's worth today? What hap is that going
[1:28:02] to change things spiritually for you?
[1:28:04] Say, "Oh, well, I got to move now. I
[1:28:06] can't be near that. I can't be near a
[1:28:08] church anymore. I got to move out in the
[1:28:10] boondocks." You better think of that
[1:28:12] ahead of time. I tell you one thing is
[1:28:15] for me in my house I'm not going to be
[1:28:17] far from the house of God at any time.
[1:28:20] I'm going to be where I can be amongst
[1:28:22] the saints where I can hear the
[1:28:23] preaching. I don't care whether I'm
[1:28:25] preaching if if the time goes on I'm not
[1:28:27] able to preach anymore. You think I'm
[1:28:29] going to move off and retire someplace.
[1:28:31] I'm going to be where I can hear the
[1:28:33] word of God. I need my soul fed.
[1:28:37] You need your soul fed. You got to make
[1:28:40] that kind of decision. And if you're if
[1:28:42] you're inward, things are going fine,
[1:28:44] everything's going great, you've got to
[1:28:46] move. You need to take a decision this
[1:28:48] morning. I'm moving from the outer
[1:28:50] court. I'm moving to another location.
[1:28:53] And if you're in the inner court and
[1:28:55] say, "Well, I've had a, you know, I've
[1:28:56] had a taste of the Holy Spirit, etc.,
[1:28:58] etc., and all of these things." But you
[1:29:00] need to move from that inner court
[1:29:02] because there's another place that's far
[1:29:04] better than either of those places, and
[1:29:06] it's called the Holy of Holies. It's
[1:29:09] called a special place. And the prophet
[1:29:11] said, he said, "Have you ever been near
[1:29:13] somebody that's been in there?"
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter whether it's Monday
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; or Sunday. Doesn't matter whether it's
[1:29:21] Wednesday or Thursday. Has nothing to do
[1:29:24] about the job. Has nothing to do about
[1:29:26] the finances. Has nothing to do about
[1:29:28] how people treat you. Doesn't have
[1:29:30] anything to do with anything else. None
[1:29:33] of the circumstances or the environment
[1:29:35] of life changes the man or the woman
[1:29:38] that's in the inner cart. in the holy of
[1:29:41] holies.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; He said the shakina of glory doesn't
[1:29:46] depend on the oil and doesn't depend on
[1:29:48] the sunshine. The shakina of glory is
[1:29:51] always the kind of glory whether what
[1:29:54] time of the day it is what the
[1:29:56] conditions of our life or what you're
[1:29:58] faced with. The shakina glory will
[1:30:00] remain steadfast.
[1:30:03] Amen.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; And outside, friends, outside you get
[1:30:08] the mana. They picked up the mana every
[1:30:11] day. And if they tried to keep it, it
[1:30:13] bred worms and stank and it would melt
[1:30:17] also. You had to get it every morning.
[1:30:20] But God told Moses, you'll collect some
[1:30:24] mana and you'll put it in a pot and
[1:30:27] you'll take it into the Holy of Holies
[1:30:29] where the shakina glory is. And that
[1:30:32] mana never went bad. That mana was
[1:30:35] always fresh. I tell you friends, when
[1:30:37] you're in the Holy of Holies and you
[1:30:39] have moved into that location, you'll
[1:30:42] come into the house of God, somebody
[1:30:43] sitting right beside you, they'll say,
[1:30:45] "Ah, I don't understand this stuff. This
[1:30:47] is not for me." And your soul is just
[1:30:49] throbbing. Oh God, this is such a
[1:30:53] wonderful food that I'm receiving. My
[1:30:57] Oh, God. Can it get any better? Because
[1:30:59] there's something there's a you've come
[1:31:01] into the glory. You've come into the
[1:31:03] glory cloud. There's a kind of glory of
[1:31:06] God is around us. Hallelujah.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it'll be on one person
[1:31:10] won't be on the next one.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; And if I was one that wasn't feeling
[1:31:14] that that place, that sacred place, I'd
[1:31:17] say, I'm moving.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; I've made a decision. I made a decision
[1:31:23] today. I'm moving out of this place
[1:31:26] where I'm so affected and afflicted by
[1:31:29] all of these other things. I'm moving
[1:31:31] out of this place. I'm moving into the
[1:31:33] Holy of Holies and I'm there to stay.
[1:31:38] I will go and I'm not going to turn
[1:31:41] back.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; That's the decision.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; You may go through a long hard trial. I
[1:31:50] went through one right here in
[1:31:52] Cloverdale. right here. While I preached
[1:31:54] a lot of you people, I went through one
[1:31:57] and it was about seven years long.
[1:32:01] Say, "Well, Brother Biscll, you never
[1:32:02] indicated it." I didn't have to. I just
[1:32:05] knew at some point in time, there's
[1:32:09] going to be light at the end of the
[1:32:11] tunnel.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; And the same shak kind of glory that I
[1:32:15] experienced with God before I went into
[1:32:18] this dark place,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; it'll be the same when I come out.
[1:32:22] Hallelujah.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; He can't change. That's just a kind of
[1:32:28] glory.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; I say glory.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; You folks, you surely understand why I
[1:32:37] want to worship him.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; I've experienced this.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; It's not a bunch of words. This isn't a
[1:32:42] sermon. It's a reality.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; It works. If I didn't have that kind of
[1:32:49] a God, I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't
[1:32:51] serve that kind of a God. This God is a
[1:32:54] living God.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; It's a God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[1:32:58] This is a God of William Brown. This is
[1:33:00] a God of Elijah. He's a friend.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; He's a guide. He's a comfort.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; He's all of these things.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; I've made my decision.
[1:33:13] And the husband must be first partaker
[1:33:15] of the fruits. I partaken of this and I
[1:33:18] tell you this God is a living God. This
[1:33:22] God's a reality and this God is worthy
[1:33:25] of your decision. A positive decision,
[1:33:28] an affirmative decision and a sudden
[1:33:31] decision.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; I will go
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; and I'll follow him all the way.
[1:33:38] and I don't know what the journey is
[1:33:39] going to call for, but I'm prepared and
[1:33:43] I've made my resolved choice and I'm
[1:33:46] done.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And God sees that.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; And then her her relative said to her,
[1:33:58] they blessed her,
[1:34:00] said, "You're our sister.
[1:34:03] Be thou the mother of thousands."
[1:34:05] talking to a young woman hasn't got a
[1:34:07] child.
[1:34:08] Be the mother of thousands of millions
[1:34:12] and let thy seed possess the gates of
[1:34:14] them which hate you.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:34:20] way on down the road, folks,
[1:34:22] there were people that came
[1:34:25] out of the lineage of Rebecca and Isaac
[1:34:32] and they began to possess the gates.
[1:34:34] Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; of their enemies.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; There was a strange power. There was
[1:34:40] something that was there was a force
[1:34:42] that was with them. There was a blessing
[1:34:44] upon their lives, a blessing upon their
[1:34:46] family, a blessing upon their tribe. And
[1:34:49] they didn't even know why.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; And all of that blessing was hinged back
[1:34:55] on these three words. I will go.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; It wasn't anything that they did. It
[1:35:02] wasn't that somebody could say, "I'm a
[1:35:04] valiant warrior. I'm a mighty man with a
[1:35:07] sword. I can sling a I can sling a stone
[1:35:10] with such accuracy. I can split a hair
[1:35:12] with it. I I'm a great mighty warrior of
[1:35:16] that had nothing to do with it. It had
[1:35:18] to do with this decision that this woman
[1:35:20] made. Young woman made. I will go."
[1:35:26] And that God spoke back because you'll
[1:35:29] go,
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; speaking to your own relatives,
[1:35:32] your seed will possess the enemy's
[1:35:35] gates. Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; You know, we're all here today
[1:35:50] and I am
[1:35:52] I'm really quite moved
[1:35:56] and I don't feel like
[1:35:58] preaching my whole sermon to you.
[1:36:04] And if I would say to each of you and we
[1:36:06] sat down and I'd say, "How come you're
[1:36:09] here?"
[1:36:11] You'd say, 'Well, you know,
[1:36:14] I worked in a certain place. I drove a
[1:36:16] bus or I worked in a sawmill. I worked
[1:36:19] in a factory.
[1:36:22] I lived in a certain apartment and there
[1:36:24] was a man, a sister there, a woman
[1:36:26] there.
[1:36:28] I was in a colony and somebody sent
[1:36:30] books in there and that's how I came.
[1:36:33] Well, no, that's not really how you
[1:36:34] came.
[1:36:42] There was a man
[1:36:46] and this man
[1:36:48] was a little humble prophet
[1:36:52] who was offered
[1:36:54] status and position and wealth and fame
[1:36:59] and anything he wanted. if you'll just
[1:37:02] come and join us. And he made some very
[1:37:05] hard decisions.
[1:37:07] I can't do that.
[1:37:10] All you have to do is just adjust a
[1:37:13] little bit of your doctrine.
[1:37:15] Some minor things. They said, "What
[1:37:17] minor things?" Well, about the Godhead,
[1:37:20] the Trinity, and the baptism.
[1:37:25] And they said, "If you can just adjust
[1:37:27] that doctrine, you won't worry over
[1:37:30] another financial thing for the rest of
[1:37:33] your life."
[1:37:37] He said, "I do. You call those things
[1:37:40] minor?
[1:37:42] I can't do that."
[1:37:47] And he made some very, very hard
[1:37:49] decisions.
[1:37:52] Very, very hard decisions.
[1:37:55] And then in a meeting of men that were
[1:37:57] not even really accepting of him, they
[1:37:59] were opening the door for him called the
[1:38:01] Christian businessmen international.
[1:38:02] They opened the door many, many places,
[1:38:05] but they love the gift.
[1:38:07] They love to dwell in the outer court.
[1:38:11] Or in the inner court, they love to feel
[1:38:14] the effect of the spirit and have the
[1:38:16] spirit and speak in tongues and have all
[1:38:19] of the matter of gifts and so on. And
[1:38:21] they made a mistake thinking that what
[1:38:23] he was demonstrating was a gift. And so
[1:38:25] they were wanting him to demonstrate
[1:38:26] that gift and show that gift. And while
[1:38:29] when he delivered the word, there was
[1:38:32] resistance. They didn't want that word.
[1:38:36] And a man spoke out
[1:38:39] in tongues.
[1:38:42] And another man came up and gave the
[1:38:46] interpretation
[1:38:48] to this message that was given in
[1:38:49] tongues. It was spoken in French
[1:38:53] and a French interpreter for the United
[1:38:56] Nations was there in this businessman's
[1:38:58] meeting
[1:39:00] and he came forward
[1:39:03] and began to deliver uh the
[1:39:08] interpretation.
[1:39:12] A translator
[1:39:26] started out like this.
[1:39:33] because thou hast chosen
[1:39:37] the narrow path
[1:39:40] and the harder way.
[1:39:43] Thou hast walked of your own choosing,
[1:39:49] he said. Then he broke in other words, I
[1:39:51] didn't have to do it.
[1:39:53] I can side in or go with them if you
[1:39:56] want to, but I want to stay with the
[1:40:00] word.
[1:40:02] And the interpretation goes on, thou
[1:40:04] hast picked the correct
[1:40:07] and precise decision
[1:40:10] and it is my way.
[1:40:14] Because of this momentous decision,
[1:40:19] a huge portion of heaven awaits thee.
[1:40:26] He says, "I happen to think now." He
[1:40:28] says, "Now that's what I wondered
[1:40:30] about."
[1:40:31] I want you to listen very closely
[1:40:34] when it came out and a huge portion of
[1:40:37] heaven awaits thee. Said, "That's what I
[1:40:42] wondered about.
[1:40:44] When I die, will it be?
[1:40:48] Then I happen to think heaven's not
[1:40:50] portioned off to different portions to
[1:40:54] us up there.
[1:40:56] Heaven is the kingdom of heaven
[1:41:00] and that's within us
[1:41:03] one waits for.
[1:41:06] What a glorious decision thou hast made.
[1:41:10] This in itself which will give and make
[1:41:13] come to pass the tremendous victory
[1:41:17] in the love divine.
[1:41:20] And in this few lines,
[1:41:23] God has spoken through a supernatural
[1:41:26] act of people who know nothing about
[1:41:29] what they're saying. One speaks in
[1:41:31] French and two get up and translate it
[1:41:35] and they don't know what the other is
[1:41:38] saying. And in these few lines, God has
[1:41:42] spoken of his correct decision,
[1:41:46] his precise decision,
[1:41:50] his momentous decision,
[1:41:52] and a glorious decision.
[1:41:56] And I think we want to we want to just
[1:41:58] focus on that a moment. A correct
[1:42:00] decision,
[1:42:01] a precise decision,
[1:42:04] a momentous decision, something of
[1:42:06] incredible weight
[1:42:09] and a glorious decision.
[1:42:13] It is as though it evolves.
[1:42:16] And he says he wondered then when I die,
[1:42:19] is there a portion of heaven? No, he
[1:42:21] said it's not proportioned off.
[1:42:24] It's the kingdom of heaven and the
[1:42:27] kingdom of heaven is within you. This
[1:42:30] was 1961.
[1:42:36] What was in him?
[1:42:38] What was in him
[1:42:41] was a call and a word and a message.
[1:42:47] Uh a commission from God, a commission
[1:42:50] by an angel. You'll take a ministry of
[1:42:55] healing to the world which he had but
[1:42:57] what was in him
[1:43:00] you are here today
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; as a result of what was in him then
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; what was in him
[1:43:12] and the decision which he made said the
[1:43:15] kingdom of heaven is within him and and
[1:43:18] you'll you'll wait
[1:43:20] and following this Friends, from this
[1:43:24] time forward, I would say things were
[1:43:26] changing in a very dramatic way in
[1:43:29] Brother Bram's ministry. And shortly
[1:43:32] after this, I was with him. He had then
[1:43:35] he had beyond the curtain of time, the
[1:43:39] experience of beyond the curtain of
[1:43:40] time. Follow closely.
[1:43:44] And when he as soon as he went, he's
[1:43:46] looking at his body, has his hand behind
[1:43:48] his head. What's he saying? He said to
[1:43:51] himself, "Bill Brandham, if you're going
[1:43:53] to do anything for go, you're 52. If
[1:43:55] you're going to do anything for God, you
[1:43:57] better get up and get moving." And in a
[1:43:59] moment,
[1:44:01] in a moment, he's standing and his body
[1:44:04] is standing there and he's standing
[1:44:06] outside. And while he's about 20 25 ft
[1:44:08] from his body, he sees millions of
[1:44:11] people. People
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; the consequence of what was in him.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Millions of people. And he said, "Who
[1:44:20] are these?" He said, "These are your
[1:44:22] people. Are these broms?" No,
[1:44:26] not that kind that is in you.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; You get my point?
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Not the physical that is in you. These
[1:44:34] are your converts to Christ.
[1:44:38] what was in him
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; because of a decision,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; an irrevocable decision. I'm going to
[1:44:46] give myself unreservedly, and I will say
[1:44:48] no to anything that may disqualify or
[1:44:52] invalidate or change my course. I have
[1:44:55] set my course for the kingdom of God,
[1:44:58] and I cannot be changed. Regardless if
[1:45:02] it's money, regardless whether it is
[1:45:04] obvious success, regardless of whether
[1:45:06] it's friends and fame and fortune, I
[1:45:09] have no interest in going that
[1:45:11] direction. I'm going to give my all. I
[1:45:14] I'm resolved. I will go
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; with this one that's revealed himself to
[1:45:20] me. And because of that decision,
[1:45:24] Rebecca made a decision. And because of
[1:45:26] her decision, people all down through
[1:45:29] the centuries, because of the scripture
[1:45:32] that was written, they possessed the
[1:45:34] gates of their enemy. They had victories
[1:45:37] they knew nothing about. They knew they
[1:45:39] had victories and they could not even
[1:45:41] tell why the blessing was there.
[1:45:48] Jesus said to Peter, "Peter, Satan hath
[1:45:51] desired to have you to sift you like
[1:45:55] wheat, but I have prayed for you."
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; That had nothing to do with Peter's
[1:46:02] strength, Peter's resolve, Peter going
[1:46:04] to do things for God. It was that he had
[1:46:07] already been prayed for by the Lord
[1:46:09] Jesus Christ, your faith will not fail.
[1:46:13] And God told his faithful messenger,
[1:46:15] "This message is going to bring forth a
[1:46:17] bride. And she's going to be a virgin
[1:46:19] bride. She's going to be a victorious
[1:46:21] bride. She's going to be a raptured
[1:46:23] bride."
[1:46:25] That's not because you and I sit here
[1:46:26] and say, "I'm going to do great things
[1:46:28] for God. I'm something special." No.
[1:46:30] What made us special is someone else's
[1:46:32] decision.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; We might even be here because God heard
[1:46:38] somebody else.
[1:46:40] Yes.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Some of you that are here married with
[1:46:43] families,
[1:46:45] you may have say, I I have such a
[1:46:48] blessed life. God has been so good to
[1:46:50] me.
[1:46:53] And we always start to measure and say,
[1:46:55] you know, what did I do? And how can I
[1:46:58] please him more?
[1:47:00] You've heard me say it before.
[1:47:02] Sometimes, friend, you know, God just
[1:47:04] declares something. He just declares
[1:47:07] something.
[1:47:09] the woman that the woman that came in
[1:47:13] and broke the oil upon Jesus.
[1:47:17] Listen, what was in her heart? And
[1:47:19] Brother Brham describes it. Says, "This
[1:47:21] isn't right. Jesus with dirty feet. This
[1:47:25] is terrible. He h how did he get past
[1:47:28] the flunky? How did he get past the
[1:47:30] people? How do he get past the host? He
[1:47:32] hasn't had his feet washed. He hasn't
[1:47:34] been received. He hasn't been He hasn't
[1:47:37] been welcomed as a guest. He's sitting
[1:47:39] over there in a corner. How is this? And
[1:47:43] she was and tore up about it. And she
[1:47:46] wasn't willing. She I mean, she wasn't
[1:47:48] worthy. But she went and she got this
[1:47:50] priceless oil. Someone else might have
[1:47:53] said, "I know that woman. That woman
[1:47:55] hasn't got a very good reputation. How
[1:47:57] do you think she bought that oil?" Jesus
[1:47:59] didn't care how she got that oil. It was
[1:48:02] what was in her heart. And she ran in
[1:48:04] and poured that oil over him. And she
[1:48:07] began to fall at his feet and wash wash
[1:48:10] his feet with her tears. And brother
[1:48:12] Brandon said her hair came down while
[1:48:14] she was kissing his feet. And he's
[1:48:16] kissing his kissing his feet.
[1:48:19] He went like that. And her hair fell
[1:48:21] down and she's beside himself. He said,
[1:48:24] "She's a mess." And her tears and the
[1:48:27] dirt from the road and the pathway and
[1:48:30] the the dung from the animals and
[1:48:32] everything. and she's wiping his feet.
[1:48:37] Jesus said, "She's anointed me for the
[1:48:40] burial."
[1:48:42] And this will be told throughout all
[1:48:44] generations what she has done. It wasn't
[1:48:47] a major decision on her part. She just
[1:48:50] did something that she had to do because
[1:48:52] this situation just isn't correct. This
[1:48:54] isn't right. Our Lord Jesus, he deserves
[1:48:57] more. He deserves something better. And
[1:48:59] I'm going to do what I can do.
[1:49:02] Yeah.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; And God takes over
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; and connects that. We're here tonight.
[1:49:08] We're here today, friends, because a
[1:49:12] little man
[1:49:15] said no
[1:49:18] to a whole lot of fame and popularity.
[1:49:21] And you're here to today with eternal
[1:49:24] life because there's another man called
[1:49:27] Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:49:30] And this one, Jesus of Naz Naz Nazareth,
[1:49:33] is no different. He's the same one that
[1:49:35] was revealed through the messenger.
[1:49:38] That's why he raised him up. But this
[1:49:40] Jesus of Nazareth, the Bible says he set
[1:49:43] his face
[1:49:45] as though he would go to Jerusalem. And
[1:49:48] nobody, no one could change that.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Peter was ready to take his weapon,
[1:49:54] which he did do. He was ready to ready
[1:49:57] to go to war. He's ready to kill for it.
[1:50:10] I'm not done.
[1:50:15] The kingdom of God is within you.
[1:50:21] I got thinking about your decisions and
[1:50:24] mine.
[1:50:28] what you think about your decision.
[1:50:32] Some of you have made some very
[1:50:33] momentous decisions. Some of you have
[1:50:35] made some very costly decisions.
[1:50:38] Some of you have moved across
[1:50:41] a continent. Some have moved across the
[1:50:44] seas.
[1:50:46] Some have tore up their roots. Many have
[1:50:49] tore up their roots and their their
[1:50:52] comfort zone
[1:50:54] and has
[1:50:57] changed and even come to a totally
[1:51:00] different strange culture.
[1:51:04] Even from say the Bible belt of the
[1:51:06] United States up to Washington is a it's
[1:51:09] a total culture shock. To come from
[1:51:12] California up a couple 1500 miles is a
[1:51:16] culture shock.
[1:51:18] To come from Manitoba or Saskatchewan or
[1:51:22] from some other place is a culture shock
[1:51:25] ourselves was a culture shock. We
[1:51:28] weren't accustomed to this. Why God
[1:51:30] wanted us here? I do not know other than
[1:51:33] I I see what is here and I see what is
[1:51:35] happening and what has happened. We've
[1:51:37] come here at what would be called
[1:51:40] materially a great cost. The decision
[1:51:44] was a weighty decision. It was a very
[1:51:47] very considered considerable decision on
[1:51:50] our part. But I want to bring you to
[1:51:52] another place and that is
[1:51:56] you have what you have
[1:51:59] because a messenger came and was
[1:52:01] faithful and he said I will do it.
[1:52:05] I'm going to stay faithful to the call.
[1:52:08] I'm going to stay faithful to the
[1:52:09] commission. And because of that
[1:52:11] decision, a message came.
[1:52:15] And then God in his great sovereign plan
[1:52:19] caused that message to reach you
[1:52:21] someplace.
[1:52:23] Every person is different. Some of you
[1:52:26] heard it in your own home. Some of you
[1:52:27] heard it in the factory. Some of you
[1:52:29] heard it elsewhere. But it was the same
[1:52:31] message. And it came to you and the Holy
[1:52:34] Spirit began to deal with you and call
[1:52:38] you and say, "Will you go? Yeah.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; And he was waiting for that decision.
[1:52:43] Will you go? And you maybe sometime you
[1:52:46] even come into the house of God and even
[1:52:48] perhaps even this morning and God by the
[1:52:50] Holy Spirit is saying to you, will you
[1:52:53] go? Will you actually follow this Christ
[1:52:57] with everything that's in you? And then
[1:52:59] others of you and many of you have
[1:53:02] already come to that place. And you I'm
[1:53:04] addressing now. You have within you the
[1:53:08] kingdom of God.
[1:53:10] And there's a portion of heaven that
[1:53:13] awaits you. And the kingdom of heaven is
[1:53:17] already within you. But there's a
[1:53:18] portion that awaits you because, and
[1:53:22] this is what I need that you must
[1:53:23] realize this morning from your decision.
[1:53:28] Let me liken it and give you one
[1:53:30] example. Moses made a decision. He had
[1:53:33] to make a decision.
[1:53:36] And the Bible says he chose rather
[1:53:40] to suffer with the people of God,
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; to be identified with them and to to to
[1:53:47] suffer need and to suffer want and to
[1:53:50] suffer uh disparity.
[1:53:54] He He was in the palace. He was on the
[1:53:56] Persian carpets. He was in the marble
[1:53:58] pillars. He had the education of Egypt.
[1:54:02] He was a mighty man. He was a warrior.
[1:54:05] But the decision was are you going to
[1:54:07] let this you must let go of this
[1:54:12] and you must there was something in him
[1:54:15] and the Bible says he looked out upon
[1:54:17] his brethren
[1:54:19] while he was in his finery and while he
[1:54:21] was in his comfort zone he looked out on
[1:54:24] his brethren and something inside that
[1:54:27] identified with them they're my brethren
[1:54:30] and I must do something and he kills an
[1:54:32] Egyptian hides him in the sand and fleas
[1:54:35] is a vagabond out into the wilderness
[1:54:38] and there becomes a sheep herder and
[1:54:42] spends 40 years out there. Then one day
[1:54:46] he says he meets a pillar of fire. The
[1:54:49] same pillar of fire that brought you
[1:54:52] what you believe today.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Not different. This isn't a story. God
[1:54:57] knows nothing about time. He knows
[1:54:59] nothing about a burning bush back there
[1:55:02] and a message that you heard today. You
[1:55:04] understand what I the the you understand
[1:55:06] the way I'm phrasing that? It isn't the
[1:55:08] time that he's aware of. It's the same
[1:55:10] one the same one that spoke to Moses has
[1:55:13] spoke to you. And in Moses in his
[1:55:16] decision, the whole the whole body of
[1:55:20] people rested in his bosom.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; And when he made his decision,
[1:55:29] those people were not worse off for it.
[1:55:32] But in his decision, in the very word
[1:55:34] that is used in the Greek, Moses
[1:55:37] choosing rather to suffer with the
[1:55:40] people of God, Moses chose rather than
[1:55:43] enjoying the pleasures of sin, he chose.
[1:55:46] And the Bible, the very word that the
[1:55:48] Bible uses is that in that choosing,
[1:55:51] it's it's an elevating. It's a lifting
[1:55:53] up. And in Moses' decision, he took he
[1:55:57] took slaves.
[1:55:59] Are you hearing me? In that decision
[1:56:02] which was in him, he took slaves and
[1:56:05] lifted them up out of bondage and
[1:56:08] brought them into liberty. In that
[1:56:11] decision was the movement of a people
[1:56:14] from Egypt and cruelty and bondage and
[1:56:18] confusion and darkness. He brought them
[1:56:21] into light. He brought them into his
[1:56:23] poor possession. He brought them to the
[1:56:25] boundaries and Joshua took over and took
[1:56:28] them in. We've had a prophet with a
[1:56:31] Moses commission and a Joshua
[1:56:33] commission.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You understand?
[1:56:38] And because of the decision that was
[1:56:40] made, we are here today. The liberty
[1:56:42] that you have, the pleasure that you
[1:56:45] enjoy, oh my God, help me. The the the
[1:56:47] the the blessings that you experience,
[1:56:51] they came because somebody made a
[1:56:53] decision.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; And now it's your decision.
[1:56:59] I thought of several
[1:57:01] in this congregation that are sitting
[1:57:03] here. I saw one walk in,
[1:57:06] a young man with his family this
[1:57:09] morning.
[1:57:13] And while I studied,
[1:57:18] I thought of some of the people of this
[1:57:22] congregation
[1:57:24] and I felt compelled to tell you that
[1:57:29] because of a decision you have made
[1:57:33] or one that you may yet have to make,
[1:57:36] there's people
[1:57:40] hanging in the balance
[1:57:42] of that decision. decision.
[1:57:46] You make that same decision of those
[1:57:48] three words. I will go and nothing will
[1:57:52] change this. I will follow this man
[1:57:55] Jesus Christ as he's been revealed in
[1:57:57] this word and nothing can deviate,
[1:58:00] nothing can thwart, nothing can change
[1:58:02] my course. I will serve it with all my
[1:58:05] energy and all my resources and all my
[1:58:08] strength and every day all of breath
[1:58:11] that I have in my body. I shall serve it
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; and a light goes on
[1:58:20] and begins to radiate out from you
[1:58:22] because of that decision
[1:58:24] and someone else
[1:58:27] is sinking. someone else. Maybe your
[1:58:29] family, maybe your own family.
[1:58:32] Mothers and fathers, maybe your own
[1:58:34] children. I say with my heart bleeding
[1:58:37] today, I've seen parents make such
[1:58:41] terrible decisions
[1:58:43] and have pulled their own children out
[1:58:46] from the house of God and would sooner
[1:58:49] see them sacrifice to devils
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; than to fellowship with people because
[1:58:54] they put a chip on their shoulder or get
[1:58:56] something get some feeling or some
[1:58:59] resentment or whatever more. I do not
[1:59:01] know. But that thing that they want to
[1:59:03] hold in your heart seems to be more
[1:59:04] important than the very life of their
[1:59:06] children.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching it straight, friends.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; And some of you that are here and many
[1:59:15] of you that are here,
[1:59:18] the decision that you have made,
[1:59:22] you hold to that
[1:59:25] without any error or change. You hold to
[1:59:28] that decision because that decision has
[1:59:31] light and it'll start to lift up. You
[1:59:35] may not even see it in your lifetime,
[1:59:36] but it'll start to lift up. Rebecca
[1:59:39] didn't see all the people that possessed
[1:59:41] the gates of the enemy. And the gates of
[1:59:43] those that possessed the gates of the
[1:59:44] enemy and had those glorious victories
[1:59:46] never got to see Rebecca. But it was
[1:59:48] because God had declared it. And God has
[1:59:50] spoken. And I say to you today that to
[1:59:53] any man, any woman, any young person
[1:59:55] that makes the kind of decision, stay
[1:59:58] with it.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; I need you to help me just a moment.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; If you're if you're a Holy of Holies
[2:00:12] dweller,
[2:00:13] let me announce to you the mana will
[2:00:17] never get stale. Amen.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; I've traveled
[2:00:24] a good deal and I see people
[2:00:28] and the message kind of becomes hoham.
[2:00:32] You know, do you have anything else
[2:00:33] that's new
[2:00:35] because the mana seems to have gotten
[2:00:37] stale to them. This mana never gets
[2:00:41] stale to me. This message never gets
[2:00:44] stale to me. It's always fresh. It's
[2:00:47] always fresh. I always get strength from
[2:00:49] it. I'm quick and vi.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Some people say, "What year was that
[2:00:54] when he spoke it?" I don't care what
[2:00:56] year it was.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; It's what it does to me.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; It's a living word.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; What it did to me. What it does to me
[2:01:07] every day.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; I I feel like a blessed man.
[2:01:24] My children are here.
[2:01:28] I'm going to say this to some of you
[2:01:29] young people for your direction, for
[2:01:32] your leadership.
[2:01:34] And to perhaps to others to their shame.
[2:01:38] Some young people make major decisions
[2:01:40] in their lives. Don't talk to anybody.
[2:01:44] I'm 18. I'm 19. I'm 20 years old. I can
[2:01:46] make up my own mind. I can make my own
[2:01:48] decision. God have mercy on you.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; I hate using personal things, but
[2:02:01] brother Brandham used them often.
[2:02:04] There's a little announcement up on the
[2:02:06] billboard. You probably all have seen it
[2:02:10] concerning my daughter Marilyn and and
[2:02:12] brother Dave.
[2:02:18] My daughter who's passed 50 years old
[2:02:21] called me on a telephone.
[2:02:24] She says, "Dad, I need to see you right
[2:02:27] away." She would not even make one step
[2:02:32] or one not even one waiver of a of a
[2:02:36] decision, major decision her life to she
[2:02:40] talk to her daddy. Amen.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Dad, I need to see you. And she said,
[2:02:45] "Whatever you say, I will do."
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; I said, "God in heaven,
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; you see that?" And you might say, "Oh,
[2:02:53] you're a blessed man, Brother Biscll."
[2:02:55] Well, I'll tell you what. I quite
[2:02:58] frankly, and I've told this before, and
[2:03:00] I'm not trying to be lengthy with you,
[2:03:02] but I personally I personally believe
[2:03:06] this is exactly what I personally
[2:03:07] believe. I want you to listen closely.
[2:03:11] I believe that the blessings of God that
[2:03:14] may be on our lives, on your life, on
[2:03:17] the church or whatever, whatever
[2:03:20] whatever it is, I do not think it's
[2:03:23] something that you and I did that was
[2:03:26] great.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; I think I think I I go back and I'm only
[2:03:31] preaching now what I believe for a long
[2:03:33] time.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; I've asked the Lord
[2:03:40] Maybe my father prayed.
[2:03:43] Maybe my mother before she died at 32,
[2:03:46] maybe she prayed. Maybe she laid her
[2:03:49] hand on me. Said, "God,
[2:03:52] I give you this son." I don't know.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; I do know that brother Brandham prayed
[2:04:01] for me.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you're fortunate. The
[2:04:06] same God heard whoever prayed for you.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; And long before I had any knowledge
[2:04:16] that the spirit of Elijah had come to
[2:04:18] visit the earth again, long before I
[2:04:20] knew that, there was just something in
[2:04:22] my heart.
[2:04:24] I'm going to connect this to you now.
[2:04:26] Right now, there was something in my
[2:04:28] heart. I want to do something good for
[2:04:31] this man.
[2:04:33] I'd like to give him a rest.
[2:04:36] I'd like to give him a rest. I'd like to
[2:04:38] just He He must be so burdened. And in
[2:04:41] the m in the midst of all of that, I'm
[2:04:42] tore up. I'm tore up. Serpent seed.
[2:04:46] Surely, Brother Brandham, that's got to
[2:04:48] be a terrible terrible. That That's just
[2:04:51] got to be a terrible statement and a
[2:04:54] gossip that somebody's trying to spread
[2:04:56] about him. I wouldn't believe that. We
[2:04:58] don't talk about those things behind the
[2:05:00] pullpit. I believe somebody's trying to
[2:05:02] spread a bad rumor about him. And that's
[2:05:04] what's in my heart. And I'm sitting with
[2:05:07] him and I'm actually silently praying.
[2:05:11] God, I hope I see what happens on the
[2:05:13] platform. I hope that you don't reveal
[2:05:15] that to him. I don't want him to see all
[2:05:17] those doubts. I don't want him to see
[2:05:20] all of that. But overriding all of that,
[2:05:23] I want to give this man of God a rest. I
[2:05:25] just want to take him up and give him a
[2:05:27] rest. I didn't realize at the time I'm
[2:05:31] taking a vessel that the very I hope you
[2:05:35] don't think I'm way offbeat.
[2:05:38] I didn't realize I I'm taking the vessel
[2:05:41] in which a huge portion of the kingdom
[2:05:44] is in and I myself against my own will
[2:05:49] against my own knowledge I'm a part of
[2:05:52] that kingdom is what's going to come out
[2:05:54] from there and a message is going to be
[2:05:56] blasted and the opening of the word is
[2:05:58] going to come I'm going to be the
[2:06:00] product of that word and I have no
[2:06:02] knowledge of it
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; what about the Shounomide woman about
[2:06:07] the woman and she says to her husband,
[2:06:11] "There's a man of God." She didn't know
[2:06:13] it was Elijah. She didn't know it was a
[2:06:15] prophet. Didn't know it was a the word
[2:06:18] of God was in him. There's a man of God
[2:06:20] when he's going by. Surely, can we do
[2:06:23] something good? Can we have a bed? Can
[2:06:25] we have a candle? Can we have a picture?
[2:06:27] Can we just do whatever we can do?
[2:06:31] See, God doesn't ask us to do things we
[2:06:33] can't do.
[2:06:35] Eleer, God's servant, didn't ask Rebecca
[2:06:38] to do something she couldn't do. She
[2:06:40] coming with a picture of water. Can I
[2:06:42] have a drink? Yes, certainly. Quick,
[2:06:46] sir, you have a drink. Oh, I'll water
[2:06:48] your camels also. And the Bible says she
[2:06:50] ran. She know this is a hot, draggy day.
[2:06:53] My goodness. You know why' I say that?
[2:06:56] She ran to give the water. And picture
[2:06:58] after picture after picture. Do you ever
[2:07:00] water a camel?
[2:07:03] You kids know anything about camels? Do
[2:07:05] you know how much water they hold? Go
[2:07:07] home and get it on your Wikipedia or
[2:07:09] something.
[2:07:11] Say, "Brother Bisco, you're an old man.
[2:07:12] Do you know anything about Wikipedia?"
[2:07:14] You stick around. I know lots.
[2:07:17] [Music]
[2:07:19] At least my computer knows lots.
[2:07:23] And she fills them all up.
[2:07:27] Little did the woman, the Shunomite
[2:07:29] woman, didn't Little did she realize
[2:07:31] that out of that same mouth that she was
[2:07:35] giving a pitch of water to, that she was
[2:07:37] giving a bed to, that she was giving a
[2:07:39] rest to. Little did she know that out of
[2:07:42] that same mouth, she was actually
[2:07:45] ministering to the very vessel
[2:07:49] that would speak the word and call his
[2:07:52] friend his servant Gahaz call the woman
[2:07:55] says you'll embrace a child
[2:07:59] spoke life
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; where there was not life you'll have a
[2:08:03] child who did that I say she had a she
[2:08:06] made a decision I want to do what I can
[2:08:09] do just what I can do. It wasn't a works
[2:08:13] program. She had it in her heart. She
[2:08:15] wanted to do what she could do.
[2:08:18] And friends,
[2:08:23] I've said to you before and I just feel
[2:08:25] like I'm I come home and I feel at home.
[2:08:29] And I said it while I was away this time
[2:08:33] because when you get away you always,
[2:08:34] you know, you find there's there's
[2:08:37] politics and there's difference of
[2:08:39] opinions and difference of feelings and
[2:08:41] things. And not that I encountered much
[2:08:43] of it at all, but you just see how
[2:08:46] things are and you can have it right in
[2:08:49] your own home. You can have it right
[2:08:52] within this congregation.
[2:08:54] But I prayed and I said, and I would
[2:08:56] recommend this to anybody,
[2:08:59] when I cross over,
[2:09:03] I want to be able to just hear.
[2:09:06] I'd like to hear it from brother
[2:09:08] Random's lips.
[2:09:10] And most of all, I want to hear it from
[2:09:12] the very lips of Christ Jesus Christ who
[2:09:15] said it to a woman said, "You did it's
[2:09:18] all right. You did what you could.
[2:09:25] You mean you're not going to talk about
[2:09:26] all the struggles and the failures?
[2:09:31] You're not going to talk about my
[2:09:32] weaknesses and my flaws.
[2:09:35] All I want to hear is you've done what
[2:09:38] you could. And this congregation,
[2:09:40] friends, you're a body of people. You're
[2:09:42] a group of people. But I say to this
[2:09:44] congregation, as a body of people,
[2:09:47] as long as we're here and as long as God
[2:09:49] has called us to be here, we will.
[2:09:51] That's my determination
[2:09:53] as a body of people. We will do what we
[2:09:55] can.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; This convention is not to be some big
[2:09:59] grand splash. That's not it at all. It's
[2:10:02] we want to do what we can. We want to
[2:10:04] bring brethren together that have never
[2:10:06] been together. We want to bring brothers
[2:10:08] together that would otherwise never have
[2:10:10] an opportunity to be together. We want
[2:10:12] to expose them to some longstanding and
[2:10:15] true tried ministry that have held to
[2:10:18] the middle of the road and they've not
[2:10:21] wavered and I think that they I think
[2:10:23] that they have something to contribute
[2:10:24] to these other brothers and it's going
[2:10:26] to be very costly for us but I've kind
[2:10:29] of threw that aside just said you know I
[2:10:32] feel that these brothers and those who
[2:10:33] can come we need to come and contribute
[2:10:35] this to them and as I know
[2:10:43] you may have somebody in your family
[2:10:48] and maybe I'm going to address the young
[2:10:50] people.
[2:10:54] Those of you young people who have
[2:10:57] real loyal and godly parents
[2:11:01] and follow this word with everything
[2:11:03] that's in them, you want to go out from
[2:11:04] this place and thank God for it.
[2:11:07] But there are others who maybe your
[2:11:08] parents are not where they should be or
[2:11:10] mother or dad is not where they should
[2:11:12] be. And maybe they're even in a
[2:11:14] backsliden condition. Maybe they're
[2:11:16] walking away from God. Maybe they're not
[2:11:18] even saved.
[2:11:20] Let me say to you in the name of the
[2:11:21] Lord
[2:11:23] the decision. If you have not made that
[2:11:25] decision, you need to take that
[2:11:26] decision. Say, I will
[2:11:29] I will follow this man with everything
[2:11:33] that's in me.
[2:11:35] And that decision will burst into a
[2:11:38] light
[2:11:41] and your family,
[2:11:44] your father, your mother, your peer, or
[2:11:47] someone who's near you will see that
[2:11:50] light. They'll see that
[2:11:53] constant beam.
[2:11:56] And let me say to you, and I feel that I
[2:12:00] should say this, someday you'll find
[2:12:02] that I'm speaking the truth, for you'll
[2:12:04] arrive on the other side. And brother
[2:12:07] Brandham, when he saw all these people,
[2:12:09] he he didn't say, "Praise God. Look at
[2:12:12] all the converts that God gave me." No,
[2:12:14] he said, "Who who are these?
[2:12:17] Who are these people?
[2:12:20] They're your converts." Nothing goes by.
[2:12:22] Didn't you recognize her? No. Huh? Who's
[2:12:25] she? She was an old woman. When you led
[2:12:28] her to Christ,
[2:12:30] he when he led her to Christ, he wasn't
[2:12:32] saying, "Oh, glory to God. I'm going to
[2:12:34] have a wonderful inheritance and a
[2:12:35] wonderful reward on the other side."
[2:12:37] That wasn't even in his mind. He was
[2:12:39] just doing what he could at the moment.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; And you'll arrive. You
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; You will arrive on the other side. And
[2:12:49] you say, and someone will run up and
[2:12:52] say, "Oh, glory to God." in the highest.
[2:12:56] I am so glad now to greet you and to
[2:12:58] meet you and say, "Who are you?"
[2:13:02] You didn't know it,
[2:13:05] but you worked beside me.
[2:13:08] You didn't know it, but I sat in school.
[2:13:12] You didn't know it,
[2:13:15] but we lived on the same street. You
[2:13:18] didn't know it, but we played soccer
[2:13:19] together.
[2:13:21] You didn't know it, but there was
[2:13:23] something that was emanating out from
[2:13:26] you. You didn't know it, but I went to
[2:13:28] my room. When I got alone with away from
[2:13:32] my friends and I got alone, I said, "Oh,
[2:13:35] God,
[2:13:36] if I could only live like that." And one
[2:13:40] day I too met him. But it was the light
[2:13:45] that was that was beaming out from you.
[2:13:49] I believe that you young men and I'm
[2:13:52] speaking to you young women in the name
[2:13:55] of the Lord, you need to be the light in
[2:13:59] your home. And there's parents here
[2:14:02] to live such a dedicated and just follow
[2:14:06] that word. You don't know where it's
[2:14:08] going to take you, but the word is
[2:14:09] number one. I'm following it. You don't
[2:14:13] know it, but it's casting out a light.
[2:14:15] It's going to bring under going to bring
[2:14:17] your family. is going to bring others
[2:14:19] under the blessing of God and they won't
[2:14:21] even know it. And God will say, "I'm
[2:14:23] doing this on this man's children. I'm
[2:14:26] doing this. I'm doing this in this man's
[2:14:29] family because his choice pleased me so
[2:14:33] much. Blessed art thou because you have
[2:14:37] made that kind of a decision." I say
[2:14:39] it's a correct decision. It's a precise
[2:14:42] decision. It's a momentous decision and
[2:14:46] it's a glorious decision. And you will
[2:14:49] meet something that's in you now that's
[2:14:51] causing you to do that. You'll meet the
[2:14:54] fruit of it again on the other side.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:15:03] That's my message.
[2:15:29] I'm so glad
[2:15:31] Brother Brandham made that decision.
[2:15:38] And if he had not made that decision, I
[2:15:40] wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be here.
[2:15:42] This church wouldn't be here. So what
[2:15:45] you see today and what we are today is
[2:15:48] because a man made a decision.
[2:15:51] And that's not sufficient.
[2:15:53] Every one of us are faced with the same
[2:15:56] decision. And I say from this service,
[2:15:59] you cannot walk out the same person.
[2:16:04] God have mercy on the man, the woman,
[2:16:06] the boy, the girl that thinks they can
[2:16:08] walk out of here just be nonchalant.
[2:16:10] Say, "Well, that's okay. That's Brother
[2:16:12] Ed." No, I tell you, it's not Brother
[2:16:13] Ed. It's the Holy Ghost.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; And he's the one who's talking to us and
[2:16:21] speaking to us.
[2:16:25] Don't just go along now. So, I'll put it
[2:16:28] off because I'm going to give you
[2:16:30] brother Brandham's words again.
[2:16:33] When God brings you to this kind of a
[2:16:36] place,
[2:16:38] you if you don't believe me, you'll
[2:16:39] believe him. You cannot remain neutral.
[2:16:44] There is no such a thing as remaining
[2:16:46] neutral.
[2:16:48] Now, it's a full full surrendered
[2:16:50] commitment.
[2:16:52] I will go.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[2:17:10] I feel as though you're calling, Lord
[2:17:13] Jesus.
[2:17:16] And it's your voice that we hear.
[2:17:23] And I don't know who all you're speaking
[2:17:25] to,
[2:17:28] but I do believe it's most of us here.
[2:17:35] And Lord, I know that I want this I want
[2:17:39] this whole truth.
[2:17:42] I want it just branded upon my own heart
[2:17:44] and on my own soul.
[2:17:48] I don't want to just preach something,
[2:17:49] but I want to be able to live it.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; And for all that are here, Lord, we are
[2:17:55] here.
[2:17:58] And I would say that most of us have
[2:17:59] some loved ones
[2:18:03] that we're burdened for. We're burdened
[2:18:05] for.
[2:18:07] But more than just a prayer, more than
[2:18:10] just a prayer,
[2:18:12] help us to live that kind of dedicated
[2:18:15] and surrendered life.
[2:18:18] Holy, holy, surrendered.
[2:18:21] And let the light of our decision
[2:18:23] emanate out from us, oh God. I'm asking
[2:18:27] that it'll have an effect, have an
[2:18:29] effect upon others, oh Lord. But before
[2:18:32] that can even happen, we need to come,
[2:18:34] oh God, to that place. Maybe some are
[2:18:37] living here and they've just lived in
[2:18:38] the outer court and they realize it's
[2:18:41] not good enough.
[2:18:43] I'm too dependent upon. I'm too
[2:18:47] I'm I'm I'm too persuaded by things that
[2:18:49] are around me,
[2:18:52] too. Oh God, I pray that you will bring
[2:18:56] now the Holy Spirit in such a way.
[2:19:01] I'm asking oh father
[2:19:04] now bring it to the people in such a way
[2:19:08] the man the woman the family
[2:19:11] the individual oh god
[2:19:15] that they will say I'll go with you Lord
[2:19:17] I'll follow you all the way
[2:19:21] I pray you'll receive us now Lord
[2:19:29] I want to have you sing with me. I'll go
[2:19:33] with him where my savior leads me. Where
[2:19:37] he leads me, I will follow.
[2:19:40] I'll go with him.
[2:19:42] I will follow. I will follow all the
[2:19:45] way. And you just mind the Lord for the
[2:19:48] rest of the service as we are coming to
[2:19:50] a close.
[2:19:52] [Music]
[2:19:53] You may need prayer. You may not have
[2:19:55] surrendered your life to Christ. You may
[2:19:58] need prayer in this moving moment. I
[2:20:01] don't want you to come as a result of
[2:20:02] emotion, but I want you to come
[2:20:05] like Rebecca did.
[2:20:08] I will go. I'm prepared to go all the
[2:20:10] way.
[2:20:16] I can hear
[2:20:20] my savior
[2:20:24] calling.
[2:20:27] I can hear
[2:20:31] my savior
[2:20:34] calling.
[2:20:38] I can hear
[2:20:44] [Music]
[2:20:52] with him
[2:20:55] all
[2:20:57] the way.
[2:21:00] I'll go with
[2:21:04] him through
[2:21:06] the garden.
[2:21:08] [Music]
[2:21:11] I'll go with
[2:21:14] him through
[2:21:16] the garden.
[2:21:20] I'll go
[2:21:22] [Music]
[2:21:24] in through
[2:21:26] the heart.
[2:21:31] I'll go with him.
[2:21:34] [Music]
[2:21:42] Brother Brandham said that when Jesus
[2:21:44] went to the garden, that's when he made
[2:21:47] his great decision.
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:21:52] Not my will,
[2:21:55] but thine be done.
[2:21:59] And I feel so strange.
[2:22:02] I feel like God is speaking to
[2:22:06] some people.
[2:22:08] And I'm going to invite you. I'd like to
[2:22:10] pray with you. But I think part of your
[2:22:12] decision might be that someone around
[2:22:15] you,
[2:22:18] someone in the congregation, maybe a son
[2:22:20] or a daughter
[2:22:22] [Music]
[2:22:24] or a wife or a husband
[2:22:26] need to see you.
[2:22:29] Say, "Excuse me, I need to get out.
[2:22:32] I want to make a I want to make a public
[2:22:35] declaration
[2:22:38] that I've made that resolve
[2:22:41] and let these people know, let God know
[2:22:46] this is irreversible.
[2:22:50] And however long God will have me here
[2:22:52] on the earth, I will stay at my
[2:22:55] position.
[2:22:58] Do I have your attention?
[2:23:01] going to sing it once again. I will
[2:23:03] follow and if you feel just to make that
[2:23:06] surrender, you can raise your hand
[2:23:09] or come and I'd love to pray with you.
[2:23:14] We're going to pray a prayer of
[2:23:15] sanctification, of dedication.
[2:23:19] And by this you'll be saying, I haven't
[2:23:21] been haven't been dwelling really where
[2:23:23] I ought to be dwelling.
[2:23:26] And I want to I want to give expression
[2:23:30] to the Holy Spirit's call in my life
[2:23:32] this morning.
[2:23:35] where he lives.
[2:23:40] [Music]
[2:24:00] We are
[2:24:04] [Music]
[2:24:09] with you.
[2:24:11] [Music]
[2:24:18] hear him calling. I can hear
[2:24:24] myior
[2:24:27] calling.
[2:24:29] [Music]
[2:24:31] I can hear
[2:24:35] myior
[2:24:38] calling.
[2:24:41] Heat. Heat.
[2:24:52] I
[2:24:55] [Music]
[2:25:03] perhaps some of you young people you can
[2:25:04] come right up here on the platform if
[2:25:06] you wish. Just come and make a little
[2:25:08] more room if you will.
[2:25:11] [Music]
[2:25:14] You just come up on the platform if you
[2:25:16] wish. Just come and stand here. Make a
[2:25:18] little more room.
[2:25:22] Brother Nathaniel, that's fine. Just
[2:25:23] come and stand here.
[2:25:26] [Music]
[2:25:28] I can hear
[2:25:32] my Savior
[2:25:35] call.
[2:25:38] [Music]
[2:25:40] I go with him.
[2:25:44] [Music]
[2:25:52] I'll go with
[2:25:55] him through
[2:26:00] that great decision.
[2:26:05] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:26:07] [Music]
[2:26:15] Heat. Heat.
[2:26:22] [Music]
[2:26:35] where he leads.
[2:26:38] Heat. Heat.
[2:26:41] [Music]
[2:26:48] Yeah.
[2:26:56] Heat.
[2:27:06] Oh, I
[2:27:09] [Music]
[2:27:19] feel to do things differently. Perhaps
[2:27:21] some of the brothers, some of the
[2:27:23] fathers, some of the deacons, if you'd
[2:27:24] come and join me in prayer, come up.
[2:27:28] Just
[2:27:30] sister can come up as well to another
[2:27:32] sister.
[2:27:34] I just listened to a service the other
[2:27:36] day. Brother Brandham had all the people
[2:27:38] lay their hands on one another. He even
[2:27:40] stopped and said, "There's somebody
[2:27:41] here." Ask God their hand. No one has a
[2:27:43] hand on them. Lay a hand on them. Pray
[2:27:46] for them. Identify yourself with their
[2:27:49] need. I say these people are here and
[2:27:52] and you can I'd say throughout this
[2:27:54] congregation, if you join, would you
[2:27:55] join with me in prayer at this time?
[2:27:58] Would you join with me in prayer? Come.
[2:28:01] There's young young men and women here.
[2:28:04] I tell you friends, I'm glad that I'm
[2:28:06] not I'm not having to talk to a bunch
[2:28:08] out on some skateboard seeing what new
[2:28:10] thing they can do or down at some beach
[2:28:13] or someplace else. They're here in the
[2:28:15] house of God in this beautiful day. I
[2:28:17] say the very least we can do is say, "Oh
[2:28:19] God,
[2:28:21] oh God, come and fill this group of
[2:28:23] people." You can't remain neutral. You
[2:28:26] can't remain neutral, friends. Not my
[2:28:29] word. You can't remain neutral.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; It's a time, the decision, the way
[2:28:35] momentous decision being made. Don't let
[2:28:38] it be just the emotion of the moment.
[2:28:40] It's a decision that's being made. I
[2:28:43] know what I speak of.
[2:28:46] I've been there. I've made that kind of
[2:28:49] a decision.
[2:28:52] And I believe that I'm persuading you
[2:28:54] today with everything that's in me. And
[2:28:56] the angel of the Lord, the same angel of
[2:28:58] the Lord that
[2:29:01] the prophet said, "It was the angel of
[2:29:02] the Lord that persuaded Rebecca."
[2:29:05] It's not me trying to persuade you. It's
[2:29:07] the angel of the Lord that is seeking to
[2:29:10] persuade you. And there's a struggle.
[2:29:13] Have you ever gone through a major
[2:29:14] decision with such a struggle? Oh, such
[2:29:17] a weight that comes on you, but then
[2:29:20] there's a voice inside is calling you to
[2:29:22] do the right thing. Do the right thing.
[2:29:25] Don't count the cost. Do the right
[2:29:28] thing.
[2:29:29] [Music]
[2:29:43] I look to this congregation
[2:29:46] to enter into deep prayer.
[2:29:50] raise your soul, your heart, your hands,
[2:29:54] and pray for the those that are around.
[2:29:58] If as though it was your last moment,
[2:30:00] your last time on earth, I want to have
[2:30:03] I want to be I want to be a vessel. I
[2:30:07] want to be a tool. I want to pray for
[2:30:09] someone.
[2:30:14] are dear Lord Jesus.
[2:30:20] It's your voice that is being heard
[2:30:25] and down in the inner being, inner realm
[2:30:29] of the soul.
[2:30:32] Believe you've spoken, you've talked,
[2:30:34] you're saying words. I don't know
[2:30:36] exactly what you're saying,
[2:30:40] but you're speaking to the individuals
[2:30:42] in their own way.
[2:30:44] You're talking their language, Lord.
[2:30:49] You're calling them to a higher plane,
[2:30:53] another life.
[2:30:55] You're calling them, Lord. And even
[2:30:57] today, we are here as I've spoken. We're
[2:31:01] here as the result. We're we're here as
[2:31:03] the consequence of the blessing of God
[2:31:06] upon this message, upon this word.
[2:31:10] Lord, with everything that's in us, we
[2:31:12] just want to be faithful. We want to be
[2:31:15] faithful. And these that have come and
[2:31:18] these that are kneeling, these that are
[2:31:19] standing and throughout this
[2:31:20] congregation and out in the streaming
[2:31:23] land, Lord, where people are streaming,
[2:31:25] oh God, come into the rooms, come into
[2:31:28] the places, oh God, hear this
[2:31:30] congregation as they now pray, oh
[2:31:33] Father, and do all manner of
[2:31:35] supernatural works amongst us. Loose
[2:31:38] them that are bound. Save them in the
[2:31:41] name of Jesus Christ. You cannot hold
[2:31:44] them any longer. This congregation, the
[2:31:47] sons and daughters of God, call for the
[2:31:50] deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:31:53] we rebuke you, Satan. You have no place,
[2:31:56] no power. You cannot hold them
[2:32:01] through Jesus Christ. They are set free.
[2:32:06] They are set free.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; You shall know the truth, and the truth
[2:32:11] shall set you free.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; He that hath the son hath life.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; He that hath not the son hath no life.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; You're the light of the world, Lord
[2:32:24] Jesus. And you've said, "We're the light
[2:32:25] of the world." Let this light now shine.
[2:32:31] Let the mouths of the people begin to
[2:32:33] testify.
[2:32:35] Let them say, "Satan, you are a liar."

[2:52:41] refreshment
[2:52:43] and then this evening let the glory
[2:52:45] cloud let the shakina
[2:52:47] settle down upon us as we sit and hear
[2:52:50] your word
[2:52:52] in Jesus Christ's name.

[2:53:10] Luke 17:30, the son of man revealed.
[2:53:13] Will you follow him? I will go. And with
