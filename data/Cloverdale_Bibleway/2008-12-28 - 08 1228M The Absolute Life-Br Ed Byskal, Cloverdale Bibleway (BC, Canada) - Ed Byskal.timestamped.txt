[8:24] Praise your name, Lord.
[8:27] Hallelujah. I'm going to ask brother
[8:29] Ernie Villanoeva, Brother Ernie, if
[8:30] you'd come and just open the service in
[8:33] a word of prayer. If you have a need on
[8:35] your heart, a burden, just raise your
[8:37] hand as we go to prayer. Brother Ernie,
[8:42] let's bow our heads.
[8:44] [Music]
[8:47] Father, we come before the throne of
[8:49] grace today with thankful hearts
[8:53] for the love and grace and mercy that
[8:55] you have shown to us for including us in
[8:58] this great supernatural plan, a
[9:01] predestination, Lord, showing us the
[9:05] wonders of the future of eternity, Lord,
[9:08] and giving us a a clear picture of your
[9:12] blueprint, Father, giving us an and
[9:14] absolute. And thus sayaeth the Lord.
[9:17] Lord, we see the world crumbling all
[9:19] around us. We see what's happening in
[9:22] Israel now. Lord, we we see the the
[9:25] nations beginning to come against Israel
[9:28] to condemn her, Lord. And Lord, these
[9:30] are all signs. We have tomorrow's
[9:32] headlines in our hands today to the
[9:35] voice of a vindicated prophet. And Lord,
[9:38] how blessed we are, how thankful we are
[9:40] for a church and a church family and a
[9:43] ministry, Lord, that feeds us and
[9:46] stimulates that revelation in our
[9:48] hearts. And Lord, we
[9:52] want to also thank you for all those
[9:54] that are visiting with us on the
[9:56] internet, Lord, the the extended family,
[9:58] those are on the phone hookup. We pray
[10:00] Lord that every need that is here in
[10:03] this building in divine presence and
[10:05] also all across the world on the
[10:08] internet. We pray that great faith would
[10:10] rise in their hearts that they would
[10:12] believe that whatever their need is and
[10:14] we all have needs, Father, even if it's
[10:16] a need of more of you. I pray God that
[10:19] today the desires of everyone's heart
[10:21] would be met. And Lord, we pray for the
[10:24] man of God that would come to minister
[10:27] the word. We pray that he would come
[10:29] into an atmosphere that has been bathed
[10:32] with prayer and with with believers that
[10:34] are ready to take their little lick of
[10:37] fire, Lord, and add it to the the fire
[10:39] that that is a minister, the ministers
[10:43] of light, Father. Just just give him a
[10:46] liberty and a freedom and an anointing,
[10:48] Lord, to enter right into the word, not
[10:50] have to battle any spirits, Father. And
[10:53] let us walk from this place, Lord. each
[10:55] one of us be be aware, Lord, that that
[10:58] angels are here in this building ready
[11:00] to minister to us. Lord, how thankful we
[11:03] are for this supernatural life, Lord.
[11:06] It's the only thing in the world that
[11:07] sounds too good to be true. And yet, the
[11:09] glory and the wonder and the majesty of
[11:11] this word will not fully be revealed to
[11:14] us until we step on the other side. We
[11:17] thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord, for
[11:18] those that are here visiting. We welcome
[11:21] them, Lord. We pray for those that are
[11:23] here in need of healing, in need of
[11:25] deliverance, or in need of salvation.
[11:27] Lord, let this be the day those that are
[11:30] holding the token over their family.
[11:31] Lord, let this be the day that great
[11:34] faith would rise in their souls to
[11:36] believe that all the promises of God are
[11:38] yay and amen. And we thank you for all
[11:41] this, all these blessings in your
[11:43] precious and holy name of our Lord Jesus
[11:46] Christ. Amen.

[13:32] God bless Elizabeth.
[13:38] [Music]
[14:26] The room grew still
[14:29] as she made her way to Jesus.
[14:33] She stumbled
[14:35] through the tears that made her blind.
[14:42] She felt such pain.
[14:47] Some spoken anger, heard folks whisper,
[14:52] "There's no place here for her kind."
[14:59] Still on she came through the shame that
[15:04] flushed her face until at last
[15:08] she fell before his feet.
[15:15] And though she spoke no words,
[15:18] everything she said was heard
[15:22] as she poured her love for the master
[15:26] from her box of
[15:30] alabaster.
[15:31] [Music]
[15:35] I've come to pour
[15:40] my praise on him
[15:43] like oil
[15:45] from Mary's
[15:47] alabaster box.
[15:52] Don't be angry
[15:55] if I wash his feet with my tears
[15:59] and dry them
[16:02] with my hair.
[16:07] You weren't there
[16:11] the night he found me.
[16:14] You did not feel what I felt when he
[16:19] wrapped his love all around me. And you
[16:25] don't know the cost
[16:27] of the oil
[16:29] in my alabaster
[16:33] box.
[16:41] I can't forget
[16:43] the way life used to be.
[16:47] I was a prisoner to the sin that held me
[16:51] bound.
[16:56] I spent my days
[16:59] poured my life without measure
[17:03] into a little treasure box.
[17:07] I thought I'd found
[17:12] until the day
[17:15] when Jesus came to me and healed my soul
[17:20] with the wonder of his touch.
[17:25] So now I'm giving back to him all the
[17:30] praise he's worthy of. I've been
[17:34] forgiven.
[17:35] And that's why I love him so much.
[17:41] [Music]
[17:43] I've come to pour
[17:48] my praise on him like all
[17:53] from berries.
[17:55] I love Esther B.
[18:00] Friends don't be angry if I wash his
[18:04] feet with my tears
[18:06] and ride them with my hair.
[18:15] You weren't there
[18:18] when Jesus found me. me. You did not
[18:23] feel what I felt when he wrapped his
[18:27] loving arms around me. And you don't
[18:32] know the cost of the oil.
[18:37] No, you don't know the cost of my
[18:42] praise.
[18:47] You don't know the cost
[18:50] of the oil
[18:53] in my alve Master
[18:58] Brianna,

[26:59] audience of people that have come out in
[27:01] this uh well we won't say much about the
[27:03] weather will we
[27:05] &gt;&gt; but I I will say this much I thank God
[27:08] for it you know why kind of quietened
[27:11] everybody
[27:12] &gt;&gt; found yourself a lot less active
[27:16] &gt;&gt; and I think God just wanted that
[27:18] &gt;&gt; so I don't want you getting mauled in
[27:20] the malls
[27:22] &gt;&gt; I just don't want you're tramping all
[27:24] over and doing a whole bunch of, you
[27:27] know, agitation and visitation. Just
[27:29] want you to be quiet at home. And uh I I
[27:33] thought it was wonderful.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why it stayed as long as.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you find that way?
[27:40] &gt;&gt; And then when you haven't had uh you
[27:41] know, haven't been around each other and
[27:43] haven't had fellowship and you miss
[27:44] services for a while and say, "Oh, I'm
[27:47] just here to drink it in."
[27:50] That's exactly the way I feel. Amen. And
[27:52] I'm just going to have you have your
[27:53] seats for a few moments. And we have u
[27:57] uh
[27:59] I guess it's just all right if we take
[28:01] our time today. Like brother Brandham so
[28:03] often says you're just so nice to talk
[28:05] to. He didn't just didn't want to hardly
[28:08] get to the word. Sometimes I just kind
[28:09] of waiting on it, you know. I just came
[28:12] in and I see our sister Jean Watkins
[28:14] here. Uh Sister Lisa's mom and our
[28:18] friends and wish her husband. Brother
[28:20] Eddie was here. Sister Jean, why don't
[28:22] you stand? I'd just like to recognize
[28:25] our dear friends.
[28:27] God bless you.
[28:30] Thankful for the Lord bringing you
[28:32] through what he's brought you through as
[28:34] well. We were praying for you, Sister
[28:36] Jane. God bless you.
[28:39] And uh someone we've been missing for a
[28:41] while, too, is Brotherh Scott Maloney.
[28:45] Where's Brother Scott?
[28:47] I'd like to have you stand, Brother
[28:49] Scott. Brother Scott just graduated from
[28:51] the Academy of the Royal RCMP.
[29:02] So, I guess he's going to follow in
[29:04] dad's footsteps. Is that a good plan,
[29:06] Brother Sean?
[29:09] A big question mark hanging over your
[29:11] head right now.
[29:13] Well, uh, fine young man. And, Brother
[29:16] Scott, we're proud and happy for you.
[29:20] And uh we know fine young men like this
[29:23] come from a good upbringing. And so a
[29:26] lot of credit to mom and dad, sister
[29:28] Janet and brother Shawn.
[29:31] And brother Scott is uh going to be
[29:33] posted up at Burns Lake, Northern
[29:36] British Columbia.
[29:38] And as much as we would like to have had
[29:40] him here, sometimes God overrules
[29:44] our likes and our wishes and even those
[29:47] of mom and dad,
[29:50] uh, friends, church, pastor, he just
[29:52] overrules it. And then all we can do is
[29:55] sit back and say, "All right, Lord. Now
[29:57] what?" You know that his plan and his
[30:00] ways are so far above our ways. And I
[30:04] can tell you for sure that the footsteps
[30:06] of the righteous are ordered of the
[30:08] Lord.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you you believe that, don't
[30:14] you?
[30:15] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[30:18] Some of you may be a little hesitant.
[30:19] I'll say it again. The footsteps of the
[30:21] righteous are ordered of the Lord.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he does all things well.
[30:31] Uh we received an email. I got an email
[30:36] uh of what was just what's just happened
[30:39] in the last last few days. And I uh
[30:43] Brother Derek, brother Dier, and and uh
[30:47] Brother Kim received this email as well,
[30:51] Brother Tony.
[30:54] And uh I I want to show uh we have about
[30:58] three pictures we can show and we'll
[31:00] show this first one.
[31:03] Uh this is uh
[31:06] this is a group in Shishuan province
[31:11] and uh
[31:13] it's a fairly fairly young group. And
[31:15] then there's a we have a picture just of
[31:17] a tribal uh picture that they sent also.
[31:22] Have the next picture please.
[31:26] There's just a tribal gathering and of
[31:28] some kind. I don't have a lot of
[31:30] information. And then there's a small
[31:32] group that's gathered in Shanghai also.
[31:36] There they are. Uh look like some very
[31:40] very fine people. Now we can take that
[31:45] off. And I'd just like to read this
[31:50] uh brother. This is from brother Murphy.
[31:53] You might remember these two brothers
[31:55] that I shared in my last report when I
[31:58] came back
[32:00] about two brothers he spoke of and I'm
[32:03] going to miss I'm going to omit their
[32:06] names
[32:07] and uh
[32:09] they were a seminary one was a seminary
[32:12] student who believed this message
[32:16] two and a half years ago and the other
[32:19] brother is a young man who started to
[32:21] print the message in his own church and
[32:24] help other churches to start their own
[32:26] printing stations.
[32:28] They went to different places after I
[32:31] left in November. And the Lord really
[32:33] blessed their trip. They visited some of
[32:36] the churches that I plan to visit. See,
[32:38] now this just goes back to what I said a
[32:40] moment ago. Brother Murphy had plans and
[32:43] these were places he felt he needed to
[32:45] go and so on and be there. And he says,
[32:48] 'I had planned to visit and didn't have
[32:51] time to do it in my last trip. One of
[32:54] the highlight is when they went to the
[32:57] southwest part of China,
[33:00] there were many minorities uh lived in
[33:03] this province, God gave them an open
[33:06] door to visit one church and in the uh
[33:10] myo tribe,
[33:12] that was the tribe picture you saw. And
[33:15] to their surprise,
[33:17] excuse me, to their surprise,
[33:21] uh,
[33:23] the church leader asked them if they can
[33:27] preach to their more than 600
[33:29] congregation on Sunday.
[33:32] Those tribal people have their own
[33:34] language, but most of the people speak
[33:37] and understand Mandarin, too.
[33:40] They lived far from the civilization in
[33:42] the mountains and it took days of travel
[33:45] for the brothers to get there. They
[33:48] printed a sackload of messages, message
[33:52] books before they left and also
[33:55] duplicated 600 message DVDs of the
[33:59] recorded voice over messages. Those
[34:03] voice over happen right up here.
[34:06] And one time I told brother Murphy,
[34:09] you will reach more people from this
[34:13] little office than you'll ever reach in
[34:15] your lifetime.
[34:17] And I said, Apostle Paul reached more
[34:20] people from prison writing letters than
[34:25] he ever could have during his missionary
[34:28] journeys, which he had to make as well.
[34:30] That one doesn't take away from the
[34:32] other, but it's where the emphasis was.
[34:34] And he reached more people from prison.
[34:37] In fact is I said to him, Apostle Paul
[34:41] reached even to you and me.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; How thankful I am
[34:47] &gt;&gt; for the letters that Apostle Paul wrote
[34:49] in prison
[34:51] &gt;&gt; and he spanned millennium
[34:54] &gt;&gt; of time and and reached my heart and I'm
[34:57] so thankful for that. And if time shall
[35:00] go on, who knows what God wants to do
[35:03] with this message. So they duplicated
[35:06] these 600 recorded voice over messages.
[35:10] But after they duplicated all the DVDs,
[35:12] they started to get worried because they
[35:14] came to this new these new places
[35:18] without knowing anybody.
[35:20] How are they going to pass out all these
[35:22] DVDs?
[35:24] But by faith, they believe that the Lord
[35:26] is in control.
[35:29] After the preaching, they gave the
[35:30] message books and DVDs as a gift that
[35:34] packed in a little box to the ministers.
[35:39] There was an old minister from another
[35:41] province just happened to be in his
[35:43] church while the two brothers preaching.
[35:47] He came over the next day and wants to
[35:49] listen more. After he heard the brother,
[35:52] he said, he said, "You should write down
[35:56] what you said and print it in a book.
[35:58] It's wonderful."
[36:02] Then it gave the brother a chance to
[36:04] witness to him and he said, "Actually, I
[36:06] don't need to write in a book. It's
[36:08] already wrote in a book." And he pulled
[36:11] out the message and DVD and gave it to
[36:13] him. And the old minister asked them to
[36:16] come to their church and minister soon.
[36:20] Then these two brothers went to another
[36:22] city and that city is brother Ivan's
[36:25] hometown.
[36:27] There are three selfurches.
[36:30] There are three three selfurches in that
[36:33] city and have thousands of members. It's
[36:37] a it's a Christmas time then and as a
[36:41] tradition all those home all those
[36:44] church churches will have a big
[36:46] celebration during Christmas Eve which
[36:49] will draw thousands of people.
[36:52] So these two brothers decide to pass all
[36:55] the their books and DVDs outside the
[36:58] church. They packed up all the books and
[37:02] DVDs in their backpack and started off.
[37:06] That sounds familiar, I'm sure, to
[37:08] brother John Lei. They arrived to one
[37:11] church and stand outside of the gate and
[37:14] started to pass out the books to the
[37:16] people. And as they went in, they almost
[37:20] caused a riot. So many people swarmed
[37:24] and reached out their hands and
[37:26] hollered, "Give me one. Give me one."
[37:29] Soon they passed out about 200 of books
[37:31] and DVDs.
[37:34] This encouraged these brothers. They
[37:36] immediately run to another church which
[37:38] on the other side of the city. But when
[37:41] they arrived there, the church service
[37:43] already started. So they have to wait
[37:46] outside till the service is over.
[37:49] But they soon notice that there are many
[37:52] police and police cars with the lights
[37:55] flashing around the church. And they
[37:58] don't know what they are going to do.
[38:00] But they decide if we already are here
[38:03] we can't back up. So they started they
[38:07] stand beside the gate and wait for the
[38:09] people to come out. And when the service
[38:12] is over all the people started to come
[38:14] out. The two brothers start to hand over
[38:17] books and DVDs to the people. No more
[38:21] than a few books. And there was a
[38:23] security guard with the uniform came
[38:26] toward them and said, "What are you
[38:28] doing?
[38:30] What are you passing?" The brother
[38:32] became very nervous. But before he
[38:35] realized what happened, he suddenly
[38:37] said, "You want to know? Here's the
[38:40] book. Go read it." And the guard took
[38:43] the book and took a and took a look at
[38:46] the book and then looked at him and he
[38:49] said, "Can I help you pass it out?
[38:54] The brother gave him a handful of books
[38:56] and this security guard started to pass
[38:58] it out. Then more guards came over and
[39:01] get the books and started to pass it out
[39:03] and all the books and all the DVDs
[39:05] passed out by no time.
[39:10] [Music]
[39:13] Hallelujah.
[39:19] Praise God.
[39:21] Well, the thing that they feared didn't
[39:24] really come upon them. And brother
[39:26] Murphy says, "These two brothers felt
[39:29] very disappointed after the whole thing
[39:31] was done. They said, "Why did we only
[39:34] duplicate 600 DVDs? We should duplicate
[39:38] at least 6,000."
[39:40] So God has his way. Praise the Lord.
[39:44] Says, "I know thy works. Behold, I've
[39:46] set before thee an open door, and no man
[39:49] can shut it. For thou hast a little
[39:51] strength, and hast kept my word, and
[39:54] hast not denied my name. Amen. Isn't
[39:58] that wonderful?
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; And we're going to be hearing from
[40:02] brother Tony.
[40:04] I spoke to brother Tony this morning and
[40:06] asked him to give me a a day when he'll
[40:09] be available in his schedule so we can
[40:11] hear what's taking place in Lebanon and
[40:17] Middle East. See what God is doing. I
[40:20] love the way God works.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; I love the way God does things.
[40:25] Unexpected.
[40:27] Before we turn to the word, I have you
[40:30] stand and I want to sing the anchor
[40:32] holes. Brother
[40:35] [Music]
[40:51] [Music]
[41:03] Oh
[41:04] [Music]
[41:14] my
[41:21] god.
[41:25] [Music]
[41:32] Of course. Once again like to ask you
[41:34] personally, have you been there?
[41:37] &gt;&gt; I've fallen on my knees
[41:40] &gt;&gt; when I faced the raging seas. And when
[41:43] you did, you discovered something. You
[41:46] discovered the anchor holes.
[41:49] It's going to be in line with what we're
[41:51] preaching this morning. The Lord
[41:52] willing. We'll sing it again. Sing it to
[41:54] the Lord. Sing with all your heart. The
[41:58] earth
[42:01] [Music]
[42:09] [Music]
[42:11] is
[42:18] Yeah.
[42:24] Heat.
[42:32] [Music]
[42:35] The ra
[42:45] [Music]
[42:52] I'll have you bow your heads with me as
[42:54] we join together in prayer. Our dear
[42:57] Lord Jesus Christ, our redeemer, our
[43:01] savior, the masterpiece
[43:05] from whom we have been struck. This
[43:08] peace, this bride peace is a part of
[43:11] you, oh God. Father, today we have a
[43:16] sense of such deep thanks and gratitude
[43:22] that for your mercy, your long suffering
[43:25] to us and how you have opened your word,
[43:31] how you have opened the book to us.
[43:34] Lord, for the people that have gathered
[43:35] today, I pray that there will be
[43:37] something that has been said delivered
[43:40] by the Holy Spirit. I pray to the heart
[43:45] to the inside of the inside Lord. Uh we
[43:48] do not want to just have a time when we
[43:51] feel good or when we feel a sense of uh
[43:56] uh just and thanksgiving for being
[43:58] together. That is wonderful. But Lord,
[44:01] we want to partake of your presence. We
[44:06] want to partake of the body word of the
[44:09] son of man. Let us eat that heavenly
[44:12] mana, oh God, that bread that was sent
[44:15] from heaven. And I pray, oh God, by the
[44:18] Holy Spirit, you will remove all
[44:21] formalities.
[44:23] Remove, oh God, any hindrance. I pray in
[44:26] the name of Jesus. Crush every obstacle,
[44:29] oh God, that the Holy Ghost may take
[44:32] control of every life, Father, from the
[44:36] youngest to the eldest. And Lord, as we
[44:38] submit ourselves, as I stand here at the
[44:40] post of duty, pray, oh God, you will
[44:44] take my lips to speak what you would
[44:46] have said. And the ears of the people,
[44:49] may they hear, not only hear, but may
[44:51] the hearts receive, oh father, do an
[44:54] eternal work. as we read of the and
[44:58] speak of the brothers in China and other
[45:01] parts of the world. Oh God, having
[45:03] brother Tony and sister Rebecca back
[45:05] here amongst us, Father, pray that
[45:08] you'll remember those that they have
[45:10] spoken to and witnessed to. Pray, oh
[45:13] God, the life that is within the word
[45:15] itself, the life of the seed. I pray it
[45:18] will just continue to work. Lord, may it
[45:21] be watered. And Lord, Father, I pray
[45:23] that you will take this congregation of
[45:25] people and all, oh God, who are standing
[45:29] with us now in prayer, those that are
[45:32] streaming the service, I pray that you
[45:34] will mightily come into the room where
[45:36] they are and anoint them, each one,
[45:38] Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Now, may
[45:41] the word, Lord, may the author of the
[45:43] word come and give us the depth and the
[45:46] meaning of it. I pray for the benefit of
[45:48] your body, the precious bride of Jesus
[45:51] Christ, and to all glory will go to you
[45:55] in Jesus' name. Lovely name. Amen. Amen.
[46:00] God bless you. Uh if you'll take your
[46:02] Bibles, please, and turn to First John
[46:07] the first chapter.
[46:19] And then we're going to turn to Luke's
[46:21] gospel,
[46:25] 1 John 1. And we'll start at the first
[46:28] verse.
[46:31] That which was from the beginning,
[46:35] which we have heard, which we have seen
[46:38] with our eyes, which we have looked upon
[46:41] in our hands have handled of the word of
[46:44] life. For the life was manifested,
[46:48] and we have seen it, and bear witness,
[46:51] and show unto you that eternal life,
[46:54] which was with the Father, and was
[46:57] manifested unto us, that which we have
[47:00] seen, and and heard, declare we unto
[47:03] you, that we all that ye also may have
[47:07] fellowship with us. And truly our
[47:09] fellowship is with the father and with
[47:12] his son Jesus Christ.
[47:16] Turn if you would also to Luke the first
[47:20] chapter
[47:24] and I was going to read
[47:27] a number of verses. Well, perhaps we can
[47:29] take time.
[47:31] We've just come through the Christmas
[47:33] season
[47:34] and uh when the these verses have been
[47:37] read
[47:38] uh a great deal, but I want to
[47:41] especially have you notice one verse.
[47:44] We'll start at verse 26.
[47:49] And in the sixth month, the angel
[47:51] Gabriel was sent from God
[47:54] unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth.
[48:00] to a virgin espouseed to a man whose
[48:03] name was Joseph of the house of David.
[48:05] And the virgin's name was Mary. And the
[48:08] angel came in unto her and said, "Hail
[48:11] thou that are highly favored.
[48:14] The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
[48:17] among women." And when she saw him, she
[48:20] was troubled at his saying, and cast in
[48:23] her mind what manner of salutation this
[48:26] should be. And the angel said unto her,
[48:28] "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found
[48:31] favor with God.
[48:34] And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
[48:37] womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt
[48:40] call his name Jesus.
[48:43] He shall be great, and shall be called
[48:45] the son of the highest. And the Lord God
[48:48] shall give unto him the throne of his
[48:50] father David. and he shall reign over
[48:53] the house of Jacob forever, and of his
[48:55] kingdom there shall be no end." Then
[48:59] said Mary unto the angel, "How shall
[49:02] this be, seeing I know not a man?" And
[49:06] the angel answered, and said unto her,
[49:09] "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
[49:13] and the power of the highest shall
[49:15] overshadow thee. Therefore also that
[49:19] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[49:23] shall be called the son of God. Amen.
[49:27] God bless his word and bless you as you
[49:28] have your seats.
[49:32] One thing I want you to remember also
[49:34] Wednesday night the service will begin
[49:36] at 9:00. We have watch night service
[49:39] Wednesday night and we're going to have
[49:41] a wonderful time.
[49:43] I was just wondering been really
[49:46] contemplating the order of the service.
[49:48] We've had a lot of singing and worship
[49:50] in the past and we'll have a number of
[49:53] different ones participating that way.
[49:56] But I felt to have uh the ministering
[49:59] brothers take about 15 minutes each and
[50:03] just say something that is very specific
[50:05] on their hearts. And I heard brother
[50:07] Brandham say the same thing. And I was
[50:09] just contemplating it and I come it's
[50:11] amazing you come and I was listening to
[50:12] a message and he said now he said uh
[50:15] we're going to have a watch night
[50:17] service and I guess we'll be hearing
[50:18] from a number of the ministers and I
[50:21] thought that was just what is exactly
[50:23] was on my mind. So I believe we have the
[50:25] mind of God. I want to bring to you uh
[50:29] something that I've been pondering
[50:32] and sometimes our thoughts are not just
[50:34] real real specific. They're not real
[50:37] clearly defined, but you feel you feel
[50:41] within your spirit, the Holy Spirit.
[50:44] It's like a something evolving,
[50:46] something developing. And sometimes it
[50:49] is it comes to you where there's just
[50:51] more emphasis being laid upon something.
[50:54] And over the past actually I can say
[50:57] over the past number of years I have
[51:00] increasingly
[51:02] become conscious and aware that for
[51:06] myself
[51:07] uh in life and with whatever ministry
[51:12] God allows me to have whatever influence
[51:14] I may have. I wish to influence people.
[51:18] I wish to instruct people. I would like
[51:21] to I feel it increasingly important to
[51:25] counsel people and and here today in my
[51:29] place and office of pastor of this
[51:31] church, I feel I need to emphasize
[51:36] the the the message itself.
[51:40] The we we speak of the message, we quote
[51:44] from the message, but I the the message
[51:48] has rapturing faith in it.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; The message is more important to you
[51:55] than you will ever realize in life.
[51:58] And I want to speak on the absolute life
[52:03] the message has within itself. And I'm
[52:06] sure you perhaps have said or have heard
[52:08] said the message has a life of its own.
[52:12] And that is true. And that life is an
[52:16] absolute life.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham preached on the
[52:19] absolute but I want to speak on the
[52:22] absolute life. Now the uh the the word
[52:27] absolute it might it might be relative
[52:29] to different people. You see it in a
[52:32] think of it in a different way. But the
[52:34] an absolute
[52:37] is it's total,
[52:40] it's complete,
[52:42] it's unqualified
[52:44] and it's supreme.
[52:48] And we need to really think about that
[52:50] because there are parts I have I have
[52:53] experienced
[52:55] uh even within my own self
[52:58] there are things which have been spoken
[53:00] and said by the messenger
[53:03] and it it it really runs opposite to
[53:08] your whole upbringing.
[53:10] it runs sideways to everything that
[53:14] people stand for in this in this time
[53:17] that we're in.
[53:19] And then and then so there's a tendency
[53:21] within a person to kind of you know uh
[53:25] maybe lessen the importance of that but
[53:28] yet it is important and then you may
[53:30] even you hear something you say oh my
[53:33] and then as time goes on you'll find out
[53:36] that's exactly
[53:38] &gt;&gt; what the messenger said
[53:40] &gt;&gt; and now you wake up to it and you find
[53:42] out because of the things that you
[53:44] experience. But an absolute is also
[53:48] having total power and authority. An
[53:52] absolute is not dependent upon anything
[53:56] else that doesn't depend on anything
[53:59] else or it's not qualified by anything
[54:02] else. It is an absolute within itself.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; There are two phases
[54:11] of of natural human life. There are two
[54:15] phases that re that within a human
[54:19] uh and I'd like to bring that to you
[54:22] like we've just read now that Jesus was
[54:25] born but we also know that Jesus the
[54:30] life of Christ was reflected all through
[54:33] the centuries of the Old Testament.
[54:36] The life of Christ was in Abraham. It
[54:41] was reflected in Isaac. It was
[54:43] reflected. But I will say this, it was
[54:46] not absolute in that it was not
[54:49] complete.
[54:50] It was not unqualified.
[54:53] Those are men, they made mistakes and
[54:56] they they they failed. But yet the life
[54:59] that was in them kept moving on because
[55:02] it had to come to a time when this son
[55:06] would be born. Amen.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; And when he was born, then the life, the
[55:12] absolute life became manifested.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; There was no sin found in him. There was
[55:18] no error found in him. Oh, they thought
[55:21] that he did wrong. They thought that he
[55:23] spoke wrong. They perceived that he was
[55:26] weak. They perceived that he was perhaps
[55:28] too mellow. But the life that was being
[55:31] demonstrated was absolute life
[55:36] &gt;&gt; in the natural
[55:38] in the human uh not human but in the in
[55:41] in just natural life that we have around
[55:43] us in with flowers and botany life and
[55:47] whatever more the seed goes into the
[55:50] ground
[55:52] and then it goes through various stages
[55:54] of growth
[55:56] &gt;&gt; and uh and and I'll give some quotes
[55:58] just a in a few moments and it'll come
[56:01] up as a little as a the seed breaks open
[56:05] and the pulp pours out. It doesn't
[56:08] resemble the seed. It's not it doesn't
[56:12] feel like the same substance. Doesn't
[56:14] have the same appearance
[56:17] and and there's nothing that resembles
[56:19] the seed. And yet the life is in it. And
[56:22] then comes the blade. The blade's not
[56:24] the same color. The blade's not the same
[56:27] shape. The blade doesn't have any
[56:30] resemblance to the seed that went in the
[56:32] ground, but it is it is from the seed.
[56:36] So the life is there. It's moving up
[56:38] through the stalk. It comes into the
[56:40] head. It comes into the tassel. It comes
[56:43] into the actual shock that carries the
[56:45] seed and and it begins to look more and
[56:48] more like it, but yet it's not the seed.
[56:51] So the life, excuse me, the life of the
[56:54] seed is in it, but it's not in its
[56:57] absolute form.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; You follow me? It's not absolute yet.
[57:02] But then when the seed that went in the
[57:04] ground is seeded once again in the
[57:07] harvest time, then it becomes absolute
[57:09] because it has now matured to its full.
[57:12] It looks like it, it feels like it, it
[57:15] tastes like it. It is the same.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; We can say it is it. Amen.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; And uh knoweth it not the message
[57:25] knoweth it not. And if you'll just bear
[57:28] with me, I'm just going to take my time
[57:31] &gt;&gt; and when we run out of time, I'll quit
[57:34] and we'll pick it up uh uh right away.
[57:37] Again, in knoweth it not, he said,
[57:40] brother Brandham said, I was in my
[57:42] father. I was in my grandfather and and
[57:45] and my grandfather's grandfather
[57:50] by seed. I was in that and I was in
[57:54] Christ. You were in Christ from the
[57:56] foundation of the world. He was in his
[57:58] grandfather and his grandfather's
[58:00] grandfather. But the life that God had
[58:03] ordained that would come into the world
[58:05] and be a mouthpiece as a messenger was
[58:08] not in its absolute form. Right. Right.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; It was there. They didn't perhaps even
[58:14] know it. Uh it hadn't become manifest.
[58:18] So we don't know how it's, you know,
[58:19] what animation it's going to have, how
[58:21] it's going to act, what kind of
[58:22] character it is. You were in your great
[58:25] your your great-grandfather's
[58:26] grandfather also. But it was not, it was
[58:29] not absolute till you came on the scene.
[58:32] When you came on the scene, it was
[58:34] manifested.
[58:37] And then he said in Satan's Eden,
[58:39] "Therefore, that was God's purpose to
[58:42] display his attributes in fellowship.
[58:46] When I was in my father, I knew nothing
[58:49] about it. But when I became his son and
[58:53] was born of him, I was a I was an
[58:57] attribute, a part of my father, and you
[59:00] are a part of your father." And as
[59:03] children of God, we are a part of God's
[59:07] attributes that was in him, made flesh
[59:10] like he was made flesh, so we can have
[59:13] fellowship one with the other as a
[59:16] family of God upon the earth. And that
[59:19] was God's purpose at the beginning.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; You see, it has to come, the seed has to
[59:26] come a full cycle because that was God's
[59:29] purpose at the beginning. And so when a
[59:32] seed of wheat, as I said a moment ago,
[59:34] is buried in the earth, uh that's part
[59:37] of God's program. But that is not his
[59:40] purpose for that seed. That purpose, the
[59:43] purpose for that seed is so that it will
[59:45] be seed once again.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; And the seed is not air with the shock.
[59:52] Uh just bear with me as I go through two
[59:54] or three more of these quotes. He said,
[59:57] "A stock is not the grain. Neither is
[1:00:01] the tossel the grain. Neither is the
[1:00:05] shock the grain, though each each time
[1:00:09] it matures, it looks more like the
[1:00:12] grain. The stalk doesn't look like the
[1:00:16] grain." Then when then what comes forth?
[1:00:19] The tassel, a little bulb, it looks more
[1:00:22] like the grain than the blade does.
[1:00:25] What comes forth next? The shock. It
[1:00:28] holds the grain and it matures the
[1:00:30] grain. Said, "Now look back there at the
[1:00:33] promise that God made to Abraham of thy
[1:00:36] seed." God said to Abraham, "Thy seed,
[1:00:40] speaking spiritually." He says, "Any of
[1:00:43] us know that he was speaking of Christ,
[1:00:46] not Isaac, through his faith seed. Thy
[1:00:50] seed shall inherit," you see the
[1:00:53] promise. and in leadership
[1:00:55] says the first corn of wheat, the
[1:00:57] bridegroom, I read these different ones
[1:00:59] because there's a different something's
[1:01:01] implied in each of the each of these
[1:01:03] quotes. The first corn of wheat, the
[1:01:06] bridegroom, had to fall into the earth
[1:01:09] in order to rise again. So did the first
[1:01:12] bride that was born at Pentecost and had
[1:01:15] to go through the dark ages like any
[1:01:18] other seed be buried. They had to die.
[1:01:22] they must do it. But it started
[1:01:25] sprouting again in Luther in the first
[1:01:27] reformation. It didn't look like the
[1:01:30] seed that went in,
[1:01:33] but it was the light of that day.
[1:01:36] And the the stalk then went out into the
[1:01:39] tassel Wesley and from the tsel it went
[1:01:42] into Pentecost, the shock. See, it's
[1:01:45] more more and more like the seed. But
[1:01:48] then when Luke 17:30
[1:01:51] came on the scene,
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; that looked just like the seed,
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; that acted just like the seed, that did
[1:01:58] just like what the seed did. And
[1:02:01] furthermore, I'll say it tasted
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; the same as the original seed. When I
[1:02:06] read the word of God and I taste of
[1:02:09] Christ by revelation by the Holy Spirit
[1:02:12] and the Holy Spirit reveals what the
[1:02:15] messenger has spoken, it tastes exactly
[1:02:17] the same.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; It tastes the same. It looks the same
[1:02:25] because it is the same.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; The life of the grain finally comes up.
[1:02:32] The Bible says in Mark 4:28,
[1:02:35] "For the earth bringeth forth fruit of
[1:02:38] itself, of herself.
[1:02:40] First the blade, then the ear, and after
[1:02:42] that the full corn of the ear."
[1:02:47] So although the appearance changes
[1:02:51] from one form to another,
[1:02:54] yet the life the life itself is an
[1:02:58] absolute life. Although the appearance
[1:03:01] changes, the life is an absolute life,
[1:03:04] but you don't see it in its absolute
[1:03:07] form.
[1:03:12] The manifestation
[1:03:14] may not yet be in its absolute or mature
[1:03:18] condition. I'm laying all this
[1:03:20] foundation for a very specific purpose
[1:03:23] and and it's it's a very very broad
[1:03:26] subject.
[1:03:28] The blade is a manifestation of the
[1:03:30] life.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; but it's not the life
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; in its absolute form.
[1:03:40] We can have all kinds of manifestations
[1:03:46] and it is a manifestation of the life
[1:03:50] but it is yet not the absolute
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; because
[1:03:57] uh there are so many things that we as
[1:04:00] even as believers can experience
[1:04:03] within the realm and I'm now just
[1:04:05] touching on another subject I want to
[1:04:07] come to massive subject I'm still
[1:04:10] struggling ling to get around it. But
[1:04:12] there's so much so much
[1:04:15] of of of our entire generation is just
[1:04:20] literally permeated with
[1:04:23] a part of our life which is come from
[1:04:28] this second realm.
[1:04:30] We feel things, our emotions,
[1:04:34] our conscience and our memory and all of
[1:04:36] those things. So much of it comes from
[1:04:39] that. If if we if we feel good after a
[1:04:42] service that oh we're really happy or
[1:04:45] something else then we think we had a
[1:04:47] tremendous service. It might be a
[1:04:49] service where you didn't feel anything
[1:04:51] was your best service
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; because God is not necessarily working
[1:04:56] in that realm. so much of it and I can I
[1:05:00] can take you which I I just have to be
[1:05:02] careful now and draw back but I can tell
[1:05:04] you that this entire age
[1:05:08] and we can we can say much of it
[1:05:10] actually came from the whole Hollywood
[1:05:12] entertainment thing
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; you know we adapt things we we hear it
[1:05:18] and we see others do it and so we do it
[1:05:20] and uh and uh uh but it's not
[1:05:23] necessarily something that is coming
[1:05:25] from the absolute life
[1:05:30] I better leave that there.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; And so we don't want to live at that
[1:05:35] level.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; There's another level.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; It's a deep deep thing that God God just
[1:05:42] does it. When a man and a woman does
[1:05:45] business with God, it's something that
[1:05:47] is a transformation that takes place
[1:05:50] inside.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; And we're we're new creatures in Christ
[1:05:54] Jesus. And it doesn't depend on if we
[1:05:58] feel good, we don't feel good, things go
[1:06:00] well, they don't go well. Has nothing to
[1:06:03] do with that.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; It is a it's a fact that uh that God and
[1:06:07] man have become one.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; So he said again, the stock is not the
[1:06:19] grain, neither is the tel the grain.
[1:06:22] See, it's manifestations, but it's not
[1:06:25] the grain.
[1:06:27] If you're spiritual, you'll just get
[1:06:28] where I'm going. The grain, though, each
[1:06:31] time it matures, it looks more like the
[1:06:34] grain.
[1:06:36] I speak of Christ. Brother Brandon was
[1:06:39] speaking of Christ and the infallibility
[1:06:41] of God's word. Said, "Look at Jesus to
[1:06:45] identify himself as the stone that would
[1:06:47] never let the promise slip. this stone
[1:06:50] that would anchor forever and forever
[1:06:54] God's coveted and promised people. He
[1:06:57] said, "As long as I am in Christ Jesus,
[1:07:02] I'm anchored." That's why he's saying
[1:07:03] the anchor holds. As long as I am in
[1:07:06] Christ Jesus,
[1:07:08] as long as I am in the absolute,
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; not as long as I'm in some manifestation
[1:07:18] of the absolute,
[1:07:20] well, things are going fine. I feel
[1:07:23] good. My spirits are high. I'm thinking
[1:07:26] positive. Uh, this has happened.
[1:07:29] Circumstances are okay. That has nothing
[1:07:31] to do,
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; nothing to do with what I'm talking
[1:07:35] about. Really, nothing to do with the
[1:07:38] Bible.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; When God does a work in an individual's
[1:07:44] life, it's an eternal work.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; The economy isn't going to change it.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; My circumstances aren't going to change
[1:07:53] it. Nothing can change it. My age
[1:07:57] doesn't change it. Whether I'm young and
[1:07:59] I'm strong or whether we're old and
[1:08:02] feeble or whether we're sick or whether
[1:08:04] we're healthy, that has nothing to do
[1:08:07] with what God has done in an
[1:08:09] individual's life.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; We may have these other things, all of
[1:08:14] these things. And listen, friends, you
[1:08:16] know as well as I do, they're passing
[1:08:18] away.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; It's all passing away. There will be a
[1:08:22] day that this this building you're
[1:08:23] sitting in, which we've had glorious
[1:08:25] times in, it will be nothing but dust
[1:08:27] and ashes.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; That's exactly the truth.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; These bodies that you are sitting in
[1:08:34] today are going to be a teaspoon of
[1:08:38] ashes. Unless it's a change by a by a
[1:08:40] rapture act,
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; it's all passing.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; You know, we want to we want to we want
[1:08:46] to come to that reality and live in that
[1:08:49] reality.
[1:08:50] You have this body for one purpose and
[1:08:54] that is that so that God can move and
[1:08:57] push through that that absolute life in
[1:09:00] you and to bring us to a manifestation
[1:09:03] that's just like the seed because we
[1:09:06] become that.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; And Satan is working over time to see
[1:09:12] that it doesn't happen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; You must not let the things of this life
[1:09:16] or of this world affect it in any way.
[1:09:19] Amen.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; And how can I be sure that I won't
[1:09:22] affect it? Well, that's what the purpose
[1:09:24] of this service today is.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; And so the prophet says, "As long as I'm
[1:09:30] in Christ," he said he he was that
[1:09:33] anchor place where Jacob's ladder where
[1:09:36] the promised seed would be.
[1:09:39] He said he was God's eternal promised
[1:09:43] seed.
[1:09:44] He was that sure stone, the perfect
[1:09:47] foundation that God's truth would be
[1:09:49] anchored in and all the devils of hell
[1:09:52] and anything else could never move it.
[1:09:55] So while the life is moving up through
[1:09:58] the seed
[1:10:01] he said in the fundamental foundation
[1:10:04] he said Adam never had to be sick.
[1:10:08] He never had to die. He never had to
[1:10:11] worry.
[1:10:12] He never had a headache. He never had a
[1:10:15] fear. Now, I know I've just gone through
[1:10:18] the one and a half sentences, and I know
[1:10:20] I've covered everybody in this
[1:10:22] congregation.
[1:10:26] He just climbed up into the arms of
[1:10:28] father
[1:10:30] and just like a child, everything was
[1:10:33] his. And whatever he asked, why he just
[1:10:37] got it? Everything obeyed him because he
[1:10:39] was God's child. and the child is the
[1:10:43] heir of all things. Now,
[1:10:49] I'd like to know if the next few words
[1:10:50] are absolute.
[1:10:52] Now, when man fell, when man fell, he
[1:10:56] lost this.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; And now what he lost in the fall, Christ
[1:11:05] came as a redeemer.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Are we still absolute?
[1:11:11] Is it still an absolute?
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "Did you ever stop to think
[1:11:18] what Christ redeemed for us?
[1:11:21] He gave us everlasting life. He brought
[1:11:24] us back to eternal fellowship and
[1:11:27] relationship to God, to be his sons and
[1:11:29] daughters again, to restore back all
[1:11:32] that Adam lost in the fall." I say
[1:11:36] that's the absolute speaking.
[1:11:43] say the absolute is here.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; In the message absolute, brother
[1:11:49] Brandham refers to a number of
[1:11:50] absolutes.
[1:11:53] One, he says a signal light is an
[1:11:54] absolute
[1:11:57] whether it's green or whether it's red.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; And when that light turns red,
[1:12:06] it means you must stop.
[1:12:10] There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[1:12:13] You need to stop.
[1:12:15] Not creep forward, but stop.
[1:12:20] And when it turns red, you can go or
[1:12:24] green rather. You can go.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; And that's an absolute.
[1:12:32] Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; So it's uh when it changes a person is
[1:12:37] free by law
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; to do it. He said the ship has a anchor
[1:12:43] and the anchor is an absolute. He says
[1:12:45] when and when difficulties arise like we
[1:12:48] have now.
[1:12:50] He said it is an anchor. It's something
[1:12:53] that holds holds you something that
[1:12:56] you're tied to. It's a promise that we
[1:13:00] have been tied to the word of God. And
[1:13:03] it's just like the anchor is the
[1:13:06] absolute to the ship in a time of storm.
[1:13:10] So we have an anchor and the anchor must
[1:13:14] be to a promise.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; It must be to this is what you said.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; This is what has been spoken.
[1:13:26] He says, "A umpire in a ball game is an
[1:13:30] absolute."
[1:13:33] There's an absolute in a ball game. It's
[1:13:35] an umpire.
[1:13:38] Sometimes
[1:13:40] we don't like his decision either.
[1:13:47] And this is very very important.
[1:13:49] Sometimes we don't like the decision of
[1:13:52] the empire.
[1:13:55] Why wouldn't we like it? Because we'd
[1:13:59] say, "I don't think it was a strike."
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; How do you call that?
[1:14:07] That didn't even go across the plate.
[1:14:09] Well, that's the way you saw it.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; But one is an absolute. And he says,
[1:14:18] "That's an absolute
[1:14:20] to the ball game.
[1:14:24] But it's that way. Anyhow, the umpire
[1:14:26] his decision is the final word.
[1:14:29] And then he one more which I want to
[1:14:31] refer to because he had quite a number
[1:14:33] of them. But one is the Supreme Court.
[1:14:38] He says our Supreme Court is an
[1:14:40] absolute.
[1:14:42] It's an absolute. It's the final end of
[1:14:46] all arguments in this nation.
[1:14:51] their decision is an absolute in our
[1:14:54] Supreme Court.
[1:14:56] He said, "That's right.
[1:14:58] I Oh, I know sometimes we don't like
[1:15:01] it." So, he's coming to the same thing
[1:15:03] again.
[1:15:05] Sometimes we don't like it, but it's an
[1:15:08] absolute anyhow. Yes, sir. And then I
[1:15:12] want to bring it the third thought.
[1:15:16] He said, "What if we didn't have that?
[1:15:21] Then what?
[1:15:23] What if we didn't have
[1:15:26] the Supreme Court? Then what?"
[1:15:30] Well, we would be back to the time
[1:15:33] the time of the judges
[1:15:36] when everybody did what was right in
[1:15:39] their own mind. That's the way I see it.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Well, and you have a right to that.
[1:15:47] And unfortunately the prophet speaks
[1:15:50] very very clearly in the church ages
[1:15:53] that Leodysa the outstanding feature of
[1:15:57] Leodysia was it was an age of the
[1:16:00] people's rights.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; This is a very sensitive subject because
[1:16:05] you have been reared in a whole age when
[1:16:09] the entire atmosphere is the people's
[1:16:13] rights. That's right, sir.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; The children have rights.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Women have rights.
[1:16:25] And in fact, in some ways, we're
[1:16:27] thankful for that. We're happy that
[1:16:31] people have rights because on the one
[1:16:34] hand the rights have been established by
[1:16:38] this nation of freedom
[1:16:42] for our protection.
[1:16:45] But yet on the other hand those freedoms
[1:16:48] can extend until they turn around and
[1:16:50] sting us
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; and go and go contrary. While I may not
[1:16:56] have the ability to describe this the
[1:16:58] way I would like to, but these rights of
[1:17:01] the land of America, we say North
[1:17:03] America,
[1:17:05] our countries
[1:17:07] and and the western world have rights
[1:17:09] and they believe in freedom. But I
[1:17:12] noticed that these nations that had, for
[1:17:14] example, communism in them and were held
[1:17:17] under a stern dictatorship and took all
[1:17:19] the rights away from the people. I I
[1:17:22] find it's it's it's it's a well-known
[1:17:24] fact that they had a whole lot less
[1:17:26] immorality.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; This congregation should have said, "I
[1:17:32] would think you're more intelligent than
[1:17:34] that."
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Had a whole lot more
[1:17:37] a whole lot more a whole lot less
[1:17:40] immorality
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; until Cruchef, I believe it was, refused
[1:17:44] to go to a can can show in America cuz
[1:17:46] he didn't want to see the immorality.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Freedom. Freedom can if it's allowed to
[1:17:53] go beyond its benefit becomes becomes a
[1:17:57] a deterrent. It becomes a a detriment,
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; not a not a benefit.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Is it correct? Amen.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Moscow is one of the most dangerous
[1:18:09] cities in the world today and it's
[1:18:12] filled with and and and controlled they
[1:18:15] say by mafia
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; because the freedoms have come and it
[1:18:21] has become a violent place
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; but it was not that way under communism.
[1:18:26] So, so now here is the uh paradox that
[1:18:30] the freedom has breeded all of this sin
[1:18:33] and corruption and violence.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; And so now we have people's rights,
[1:18:38] individual rights. So we have the rights
[1:18:41] of uh the rights of of the young people,
[1:18:45] the rights of children
[1:18:47] and the rights are put in place so that
[1:18:51] a child doesn't need to be abused
[1:18:55] physically
[1:18:58] and then that protection which is there
[1:19:00] for their protection.
[1:19:03] I speak in the presence of men who are
[1:19:06] enforcers of the law. So I want to try
[1:19:08] to be as accurate as possible.
[1:19:12] So it's there for their protection. But
[1:19:15] then on the other hand, a child, a young
[1:19:19] person may say,
[1:19:21] uh, my parents put too much restriction
[1:19:24] on me. They put too much restraint on
[1:19:26] me. and they start involving the
[1:19:29] authorities and it turns to their damage
[1:19:32] and to their detriment and begins to
[1:19:35] tear apart a family that is supposed to
[1:19:37] protect.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't that so?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; We have very very stringent laws and
[1:19:46] regulations
[1:19:48] for the protection of women and wives
[1:19:52] and I'm thankful we have that. Some have
[1:19:56] been terribly abused and it's a big
[1:19:59] thing today. But still that very that
[1:20:03] very segment of the laws and the
[1:20:07] regulations
[1:20:08] if it's used improperly or with an ill
[1:20:12] it can actually be the very instrument
[1:20:14] that divides.
[1:20:16] I've had situations where husbands
[1:20:19] didn't want wives to leave, but the very
[1:20:22] law that protect them is the one that
[1:20:26] sent them away
[1:20:28] and protected them to go away.
[1:20:33] I've had I've been involved
[1:20:36] where I sat across from a a leading
[1:20:40] leading
[1:20:42] uh attorney in the city of Vancouver.
[1:20:47] I said,
[1:20:49] "This man does not want this home to be
[1:20:53] broken.
[1:20:54] This man will do anything in his power.
[1:20:58] This is a fine husband, a man of
[1:21:02] integrity,
[1:21:04] and he doesn't want to lose the family.
[1:21:08] This man, this attorney, lawyer, reached
[1:21:11] around and pulled two huge volumes out
[1:21:15] of his wall cabinet, threw one down,
[1:21:19] grabbed the other one, threw one down,
[1:21:22] and said, "These two comprise the laws
[1:21:25] of British Columbia,
[1:21:28] and there is not, thank your
[1:21:30] government," he said. There is not one
[1:21:33] paragraph
[1:21:34] in these laws, two volumes like this,
[1:21:38] not one paragraph
[1:21:42] that is given
[1:21:45] on what the husband is wanting to do to
[1:21:47] hold the family together.
[1:21:50] And I was stunned to silence.
[1:21:53] I stood and looked at those two volumes.
[1:21:55] He said, "Just thank your government."
[1:21:56] He said, "There's not one law." So now
[1:22:00] we have what could we say? What am I
[1:22:04] speaking about?
[1:22:06] That was the rights
[1:22:09] of a wife,
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Two huge volumes, but there was nothing
[1:22:13] in there to speak of the rights of the
[1:22:15] husband who wanted to keep it together.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; That was a woman's rights.
[1:22:21] And it's unfortunate that we are living
[1:22:23] in such an age where the criminals have
[1:22:27] rights.
[1:22:29] And you know as well as yourself, I
[1:22:30] might as well say it. I'm saying it
[1:22:31] publicly.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; In some cases, the criminal has more
[1:22:35] rights than the victim.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Victims suffer incredibly,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; but there doesn't seem to be a voice for
[1:22:45] them. Why? I'll say why in two words.
[1:22:48] Satan's Eden.
[1:22:51] That's right.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; And you could raise up an Abraham
[1:22:54] Lincoln and George Washington in every
[1:22:56] county and you'll never turn it around.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; You could raise up the great men of the
[1:23:02] past and they will not turn it around
[1:23:04] because this is what has been foretold
[1:23:06] in the scripture. This is the way it's
[1:23:09] going. This is the way it is. But we as
[1:23:11] believers want to make sure we're not
[1:23:13] tainted
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; by that.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be in that mentality.
[1:23:19] Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; We want to find
[1:23:22] the source of our wisdom from an
[1:23:25] absolute life.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Even in the last I thank you for your
[1:23:30] prayers. I thank you for your time. We
[1:23:32] took some time of rest much much needed
[1:23:34] rest. But I spent a lot of time
[1:23:37] meditating and pondering and I just
[1:23:39] determined the same oldfashioned thought
[1:23:41] that comes to my mind so very very many
[1:23:44] times. I don't feel a part of this
[1:23:47] world.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; This world has become an unwelcome
[1:23:52] place. Increasingly an unwelcome place.
[1:23:54] I don't think like them.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; This Bible isn't written by them.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; And if you want a solution, it can only
[1:24:04] come from the absolute life.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And this is what happened. I thought of
[1:24:12] this world in a in in a such a lost
[1:24:15] condition and keeping this uh uh
[1:24:18] Christmas season which is just wrong
[1:24:21] time of the year and everything else. We
[1:24:22] understand that. We're not going to get
[1:24:23] into that. But I thought how many people
[1:24:26] and I trust that the believers can
[1:24:29] realize that we are they're remembering
[1:24:33] a time that's long past
[1:24:36] says and you shall bring forth a son
[1:24:40] and his name will be called Jesus.
[1:24:44] What a marvelous thing. Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; We've waited all these centuries and
[1:24:50] finally the life and that's why John
[1:24:54] said the life was manifested
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; and we saw it.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; And we handled it
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; how marvelous it is in the springtime
[1:25:05] when the plants start to come forth. But
[1:25:08] oh, we wait. We wait till the blossom
[1:25:10] comes and the and the bloom comes out
[1:25:12] and and the and we see the flower and
[1:25:14] all of its radiance and its glory and
[1:25:16] its color and its shape. Finally, the
[1:25:19] life has been manifested
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; and it's absolute.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; What was in the seed is now manifested.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; We have an absolute.
[1:25:35] So the Supreme Court's an absolute for
[1:25:37] the nation.
[1:25:39] What if we didn't have that? Well, then
[1:25:42] you would have, as I said, it was in the
[1:25:45] days of
[1:25:47] of the of the judges.
[1:25:52] Caleb's nephew was a judge.
[1:25:57] Uh
[1:25:59] uh another one, Yer, he was a judge of
[1:26:02] Israel. Jeffa judged Israel for six
[1:26:05] years.
[1:26:07] Deborah was a prophetess.
[1:26:10] Elon judged for 10 years. And Samson
[1:26:14] judged Israel for 20 years. And here's
[1:26:17] what brother Brandham said about this
[1:26:18] time.
[1:26:20] Each one has his own absolute.
[1:26:26] It's just like it was in the days of the
[1:26:28] judges. Every man done what was right in
[1:26:32] his own sight. In the days of judges,
[1:26:36] every man had his own absolute. Every
[1:26:39] man had his own absolute.
[1:26:43] He did just what he wanted to do and
[1:26:47] that's the way it is. Now,
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; I want to just stop there a moment.
[1:26:53] Here's brother Brandon preaching.
[1:26:56] You know, brother Brandon preached to
[1:26:59] several hundred thousand
[1:27:02] in Durban.
[1:27:04] Several hundred thousand people actually
[1:27:06] heard him, but I don't know what that
[1:27:08] message was that never caught me.
[1:27:12] He preached in Bombay manifestations.
[1:27:15] Brother Sydney Jackson said, "Brother
[1:27:16] Brandon prayed a mass prayer and there
[1:27:19] was miracles taking place till 2 and 3
[1:27:21] in the morning." Wonderful. Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; But that never caught me.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Bombay. They started to tear the clothes
[1:27:30] off. Brother Brandham even told me tried
[1:27:31] to tear pieces off his pants, but that
[1:27:34] never caught me.
[1:27:37] Was it a manifestation of the life?
[1:27:39] Absolutely. But it didn't catch me.
[1:27:44] I've heard probably several thousands of
[1:27:46] messages
[1:27:48] in my lifetime from my childhood till
[1:27:50] now. I've heard thousands of messages
[1:27:53] by men,
[1:27:56] good men.
[1:27:58] I'm sad to say,
[1:28:01] I'm really sad to say I heard perhaps 30
[1:28:05] or 40 of brother Brandham's
[1:28:07] in life
[1:28:13] and I couldn't remember what he said.
[1:28:19] I probably can remember. You might think
[1:28:22] what a memory you have. I might be able
[1:28:24] to remember 10 messages
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; that I've heard men preach
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; because it never got me.
[1:28:35] But the message when
[1:28:38] when the life became manifested
[1:28:41] and I I saw a life. I see a life. You
[1:28:44] know, you read a book. I don't just read
[1:28:46] a book. I see a life.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; I handle the life.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; I feel the life. I feel the throb of the
[1:28:55] life. It's not a bunch of intellectual
[1:28:57] stuff to me.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; It's not something I I'm I find so many
[1:29:02] that try to find it to see if it fits
[1:29:03] with what they think. You're in the
[1:29:05] wrong
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; You're in the wrong channel. We're not
[1:29:09] here to find out if it if what the
[1:29:10] prophet said fits with what we already
[1:29:13] think because you're trying to merge the
[1:29:15] absolute with your reasoning.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Doesn't work.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Doesn't work. Sorry folks. Doesn't work
[1:29:22] where you can't you can't you can't
[1:29:24] blend uh you can't blend the absolute
[1:29:27] life with some leodysian upbringing.
[1:29:30] And we've all been brought up in this
[1:29:32] whole atmosphere. It isn't as though we
[1:29:33] haven't been tainted. That's why we need
[1:29:35] to be in the house of God. And let our
[1:29:37] minds be washed
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; from the whole atmosphere of this
[1:29:41] generation. Let it come across. Let it
[1:29:44] sting us if it needs to.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Let it correct us. Say, "Oh God, here I
[1:29:49] am.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Cleanse me."
[1:29:52] Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; If you come here for any other purpose,
[1:29:55] if you come here because it's a, you
[1:29:56] know, this Christmas season or a holiday
[1:29:58] season or whatever more, you're here for
[1:30:00] the wrong reason.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; If you're here just because you know
[1:30:04] your friend is here or your parents are
[1:30:06] here, whatever more, I won't say it's
[1:30:08] the wrong reason. I'm glad you're here,
[1:30:09] but you really need to open your heart
[1:30:12] and say, "Oh, God, wash me from the
[1:30:16] whole thought of this generation, from
[1:30:18] the whole atmosphere of it." because
[1:30:20] it's so contrary to your plan, your
[1:30:24] program.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Everybody had their own way of thinking.
[1:30:36] Brother Brandham said about the spirit
[1:30:37] of Leo Dea.
[1:30:41] Now, he says the name Leodya, I I hope
[1:30:44] you understand. And I'm taking my time
[1:30:46] and doing it a little different than I
[1:30:47] normally do. But he said the name
[1:30:50] Leodysia, the people's rights or justice
[1:30:55] for the peoples. He said, "Was there
[1:30:57] ever an age like the 20th century church
[1:31:00] age that has been that has seen all
[1:31:04] nations rising up and demanding equality
[1:31:08] socially and financially?"
[1:31:11] When the ancients called Leodysia the
[1:31:14] metropolis, it was looking forward to
[1:31:17] the one world government that we are now
[1:31:20] setting up.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; I believe that's an absolute statement.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon was saying that long
[1:31:28] before perhaps they might have just been
[1:31:30] thinking about this in their bed
[1:31:31] chamber, but God made it known to a
[1:31:34] people who would receive it as God's
[1:31:36] word. He made it known to us. They were
[1:31:38] setting it up. They were thinking about
[1:31:40] it back then. They were scheming it back
[1:31:43] then. We see it happening right now.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; All these conferences which are
[1:31:47] happening on a regular base. I don't
[1:31:48] even pay any attention to them. The G7s
[1:31:50] or the G8s or whatever more, they're
[1:31:53] going to do what they're going to do.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; They're going to do what God has
[1:31:56] ordained them to do.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; But let us not as the bride of Jesus
[1:32:00] Christ get caught in their trap.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; It's not a good thing that's going to
[1:32:04] happen.
[1:32:11] that they're setting up right now. As we
[1:32:14] think of that city being the location of
[1:32:16] a great church council, we see
[1:32:19] foreshadowed the ecumenical move taking
[1:32:22] place today wherein very soon we will
[1:32:25] see all the so-called Christians come
[1:32:28] together. Indeed, the church and state,
[1:32:31] religion and politics are coming
[1:32:33] together. The tears are being bound and
[1:32:36] the wheat will soon be ready for the
[1:32:39] corner.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; now, don't don't anybody here think,
[1:32:43] "Oh, I know exactly where we're at." You
[1:32:45] haven't got a clue where we're at.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; You may just feel things moving in a
[1:32:49] certain direction, but on down the road
[1:32:51] you find out what what you had
[1:32:52] determined today wasn't it. We don't
[1:32:54] want to be there.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; You don't want to say, "Well, I have a
[1:32:57] right to figure out just exactly where
[1:32:59] we are." You don't know exactly where we
[1:33:01] are. I don't know where we are. I do
[1:33:03] know one thing that the absolute has
[1:33:05] been manifested and the word has been
[1:33:07] spoken and it is unfolding and all I
[1:33:09] want to do I want to be part of the
[1:33:11] unfolding.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; So even if we take one little step just
[1:33:15] one little step and another little step
[1:33:18] we're moving the right direction. That's
[1:33:20] the main thing.
[1:33:24] And then he went on to say
[1:33:28] the city it was a city of earthquakes.
[1:33:31] Leodia
[1:33:33] such earthquakes has finally destroyed
[1:33:35] it. This age will end in God shaking the
[1:33:40] whole world that has gone off to make
[1:33:43] love with the old harlot.
[1:33:45] Oh,
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; what powerful words.
[1:33:52] We have all kinds of predictions
[1:33:56] in these next few days. There'll be all
[1:33:57] kinds of predictions
[1:34:02] of what the future holds.
[1:34:05] And when we read last year's
[1:34:07] predictions,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; yeah, uh you'll see how many of them
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; were off base.
[1:34:15] And what the world considers as great,
[1:34:18] it's not very great.
[1:34:23] The city was rich and endowed by the
[1:34:26] wealthy. It was full of culture and
[1:34:29] science abounded.
[1:34:31] How like today the churches are rich and
[1:34:34] the worship is beautiful and formal but
[1:34:37] cold and dead. That's why I say don't
[1:34:41] want to slip into cold dead formal
[1:34:43] religion. Right.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; I far sooner have somebody from the
[1:34:49] depths of their soul give glory to God.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Don't leave it to the next person to
[1:34:54] pray for you. When we stand to pray,
[1:34:56] there ought to be some words in your
[1:34:58] mouth.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; There ought to be something coming out
[1:35:00] of your heart saying, "God, I have a
[1:35:03] desire. I don't care how simple the
[1:35:05] prayer is, but the whole congregation
[1:35:07] should be in prayer." I hope I'm not
[1:35:09] preaching this just for exercise. The
[1:35:11] whole congregation should be in prayer.
[1:35:13] Don't do it just because uh we're do it
[1:35:16] one time, but we ought to hear the word.
[1:35:19] The absolute has spoken.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Says, "And the worship was beautiful,
[1:35:27] but cold and dead. Culture and education
[1:35:29] had taken the place of the spirit-given
[1:35:32] word. And faith has has been superseded
[1:35:35] by science." Faith has been superseded
[1:35:38] by science. That's why we don't see as
[1:35:40] much as we see. You go to some places
[1:35:42] and they don't have all the scientific
[1:35:44] advancement. They don't have everything
[1:35:47] that perhaps we have medically speaking.
[1:35:50] And not that we're opposed to that.
[1:35:51] Thank God for it. If I wasn't well, I'd
[1:35:54] probably want to go and see what a
[1:35:56] doctor would have to say about it
[1:35:57] because I've been able to be uh great
[1:35:59] help. And and so, Brother Brandham had a
[1:36:01] wonderful balance about that. But on the
[1:36:03] other hand,
[1:36:05] God begins just where man can't go any
[1:36:10] further.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; That's just where God begins.
[1:36:16] You may be here
[1:36:19] and you're beyond or a doctor can't find
[1:36:23] out
[1:36:24] and you don't have an answer for it,
[1:36:27] then we have a place.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; We have an absolute life.
[1:36:33] an absolute and all the attributes of
[1:36:36] him are available and can be accessed by
[1:36:41] the believer.
[1:36:50] And he says that the culture and
[1:36:52] education have given place to the spirit
[1:36:54] given word and faith has been superseded
[1:36:57] by science so that man is a victim of
[1:37:02] materialism. He says, "In every
[1:37:04] attribute, listen to this statement now.
[1:37:07] In every attribute, ancient Leodysia is
[1:37:11] found reborn in the 20th century." And
[1:37:16] we're in the 21st century. Every
[1:37:19] attribute.
[1:37:21] You hear me?
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Every attribute
[1:37:25] of ancient Leodysa has been reborn.
[1:37:29] And you have to cope with it. You have
[1:37:32] to deal with it. There isn't a person in
[1:37:35] under the sound of my voice that is
[1:37:37] exempt or immune from the forces of
[1:37:42] Leodya.
[1:37:43] We're we're we're not of that. We
[1:37:46] haven't been born of that. But I can
[1:37:48] tell you that Satan in Satan's Eden,
[1:37:52] listen to me now. In Satan's Eden, Satan
[1:37:56] who who the prophet says is a slicker.
[1:38:00] He's don't try to tackle him on the
[1:38:02] word. He knows more about the word than
[1:38:04] you do. He doesn't have revelation, but
[1:38:06] he just knows it intellectually.
[1:38:08] He's He's got all of those things at at
[1:38:10] at his his access. Don't forget, he was
[1:38:13] a fallen angel. He knows all about
[1:38:15] worship.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; He knows all about worship. And he has
[1:38:21] he has cultiv cultivated
[1:38:24] and designed a generation to be this one
[1:38:29] which also the prophet says is the most
[1:38:31] deceitful of all the most deceiving of
[1:38:35] all generations. And so Satan has linked
[1:38:38] together Leodysa and the attributes of
[1:38:41] Leodysa to make the most deceiving age
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; possible.
[1:38:48] And that's the age that we're in.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying all of this to say, you
[1:38:54] might say, well, my what a service, uh,
[1:38:58] Brother Biscol, that you're speaking
[1:39:00] this morning, and it's it's for a it's
[1:39:02] for a good purpose. And that purpose is
[1:39:05] there's only one way. There's only I'm
[1:39:08] absolutely convinced there's only one
[1:39:10] way for a believer to escape the effects
[1:39:14] of this generation and that is by the
[1:39:16] absolute life that was manifested again
[1:39:19] in this day and came to us in the form
[1:39:22] of a message.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; And the end time message still meets end
[1:39:27] time conditions.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; There's end time more end time
[1:39:31] conditions than we could ever ever put
[1:39:34] down in paper.
[1:39:36] uh we couldn't be able to write and
[1:39:38] describe it adequately but the end time
[1:39:41] message has to meet the end time
[1:39:44] conditions.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And I know that there are situations
[1:39:55] which you have faced which you have gone
[1:39:57] through and it looks as though you come
[1:39:59] to an absolute impass.
[1:40:02] It seems like there's no answer.
[1:40:05] And I can say, and you can repeat, well,
[1:40:07] the end time message meets the end time
[1:40:10] conditions.
[1:40:13] And maybe some say here, well, you know,
[1:40:15] I I tried to do that. I tried to believe
[1:40:17] that. And and uh
[1:40:20] nothing happened.
[1:40:23] What do we do then?
[1:40:27] Well, I know only one thing to do.
[1:40:32] Just feel feel the tug
[1:40:35] and make sure that the anchors in a
[1:40:37] promise
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; and let the let the winds rage.
[1:40:44] Let the impossibilities
[1:40:46] come
[1:40:48] and let everything
[1:40:51] dash away. But I have an anchor.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; When that wave comes, I feel I feel that
[1:40:59] anchor. Brother Ernie.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; And I would sooner die. I'd sooner pass
[1:41:04] off the scene feeling my anchor chain
[1:41:08] than let it be affected or something to
[1:41:10] come out of my mouth that that that
[1:41:13] denied the promise of God.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Making a register.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Can I go a few more minutes, please?
[1:41:26] I can go back in the scripture talking
[1:41:29] about what the people thought was right.
[1:41:33] And uh
[1:41:38] there was a time when Moses, he sent out
[1:41:41] the spies. This is well known to you.
[1:41:44] Moses sent out the spies to spy out the
[1:41:47] land and to come back with the report
[1:41:50] and find out about the people and find
[1:41:52] out about the cities. And he gave them
[1:41:54] specific things that they should come
[1:41:56] back. And they came back and they gave
[1:41:59] an evil report. The Bible says, "And
[1:42:01] Caleb stilled the people before Moses
[1:42:04] and said, "Let us go up at once and p
[1:42:07] possess it, for we are well able to
[1:42:09] overcome it."
[1:42:11] And uh and the men that went up with him
[1:42:14] said, "We be not able to go up against
[1:42:16] the people, for they are stronger than
[1:42:19] we." And they brought up an evil report
[1:42:22] of the land which they had searched uh
[1:42:26] unto the children of Israel, saying, The
[1:42:28] land through which we have gone to
[1:42:31] search it is a land that eateth up the
[1:42:34] inhabitants thereof, and all the people
[1:42:36] that we saw in it are men of great
[1:42:39] stature.
[1:42:41] And there we saw the giants and the sons
[1:42:44] of Anch which came the giants. And we
[1:42:49] were we were in our own sight as
[1:42:52] grasshoppers and we were and so were we
[1:42:55] in their sight. Now this happened to be
[1:42:58] they were they were they were stretching
[1:43:00] and reaching
[1:43:02] uh their mandate far beyond what Moses
[1:43:05] told them to do. Moses didn't tell them
[1:43:07] well you go there and when you see the
[1:43:09] people tell us how you felt when you saw
[1:43:11] them.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Tell us how you think they looked upon
[1:43:15] you. He didn't ask him to do that. He
[1:43:18] said, "Do this, this, and this." But
[1:43:20] they came back and they added a whole
[1:43:21] lot more to it and said, "Well, this is
[1:43:23] how we feel." And and and so I want you
[1:43:26] to notice then and all the congregation.
[1:43:30] Look at the effect of this. Now,
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; it's amazing what a few words
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; my wife and I,
[1:43:43] you don't mind, just a little personal
[1:43:44] thing. Our dishwasher just ground to a
[1:43:47] halt.
[1:43:49] Quit.
[1:43:52] He says, "Oh, it's not pumping the water
[1:43:54] out." I said, "There'll be nothing
[1:43:56] wrong." I said, "You know, just push
[1:43:58] that. We're going to run through a cycle
[1:44:00] all the rest of it." And I had the
[1:44:02] answer. We're going to scrape all this
[1:44:03] water out. So, we got rid of all the
[1:44:04] water and just start the thing up again.
[1:44:08] So, she hits the button and we wait and
[1:44:10] it goes through the whole cycle. We go
[1:44:12] there. There's all that water laying in
[1:44:13] the bottom again. So, you know what you
[1:44:15] do? You call the right man. So, we
[1:44:17] called the repair man. Says, "Uh, how
[1:44:19] long have you had it?" "Oh, we've had it
[1:44:21] about 18 years." He said, "Forget it.
[1:44:23] It's not worth it." Said, "By the time I
[1:44:25] get there and I buy any parts and fix
[1:44:27] that thing," he said, "It's better you
[1:44:29] just go and buy a new one."
[1:44:32] And he said, "It won't be worth it." So,
[1:44:33] we we go looking for dishwashers.
[1:44:36] And we look at this one and now there's
[1:44:39] more makes and more models and more
[1:44:42] buttons and more stuff and more this and
[1:44:44] more of that and this one has a fan and
[1:44:46] this one has a dryer and this one has
[1:44:48] that and I just stand back and let my
[1:44:50] wife absorb it.
[1:44:54] I think that's absolute, isn't it? That
[1:44:56] women are made to absorb those kind of
[1:44:58] things, Gary.
[1:45:01] So I try to understand it and my but she
[1:45:03] she's you know she knows what she wants.
[1:45:06] So this is better. That is better.
[1:45:08] That's better.
[1:45:10] So we go to another store. Let's go to
[1:45:12] this store. Let's go to that store. We
[1:45:13] go another store. And up comes another
[1:45:15] salesperson.
[1:45:16] And uh do you handle this mate? Cuz she
[1:45:19] kind of focused on one said I think that
[1:45:21] I really like the you know what it has
[1:45:23] and it has just certain uh things that
[1:45:26] that that really are good for me. So So
[1:45:30] we focused on one. We said that's the
[1:45:32] one. So we go to another store and a
[1:45:36] lady comes up and said, "Well, did you
[1:45:38] ever hear of this make?" Oh, yeah. She
[1:45:39] said, "We used to handle it." Used to.
[1:45:42] Why don't you handle it now? Said, "I
[1:45:44] sold one. Sold it to a plumber and he
[1:45:47] brought it back.
[1:45:53] You got it.
[1:45:56] Yeah, you got it. We didn't buy it.
[1:46:00] We didn't buy it." And we got out in the
[1:46:02] truck and driving down the road and I
[1:46:05] said, she said, 'You know, it's amazing
[1:46:07] how I feel so different about that one
[1:46:09] now.
[1:46:12] I said, "Isn't that incredible that just
[1:46:15] a little sentence from a woman that we
[1:46:18] don't know? Well, we don't know her at
[1:46:21] all. And yet that sentence is locked in
[1:46:24] our minds and has made us complete feel
[1:46:28] completely different
[1:46:30] about that thing and we didn't buy it.
[1:46:33] And I I just took off from that. I said,
[1:46:35] you know, isn't it amazing
[1:46:38] how you can hear something about
[1:46:40] somebody
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; and it may not be right.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; It may not even be true. Right?
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; And you may find out later that it
[1:46:55] wasn't true,
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; but it still leaves a shadow.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; What a curse.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; But we have rights. We can say what we
[1:47:05] want.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; This is our right to express ourselves.
[1:47:10] We're in the land of the free.
[1:47:13] I was reading what some men and and I I
[1:47:16] don't know. Everything's a blog today.
[1:47:19] I think it's a good word, blog.
[1:47:23] I don't know where the word come from,
[1:47:25] but anyway, everybody's got a blog.
[1:47:28] And I I go on to search out something
[1:47:31] and searching out something about the
[1:47:32] message that end up with somebody's blog
[1:47:36] about brother Brandham. So, you said it
[1:47:39] right. He's wrong on the Trinity and
[1:47:42] he's wrong on this and he's wrong on the
[1:47:44] serpent seat and all this and and
[1:47:47] not one piece of scripture, not one
[1:47:50] thing from the absolute, but everybody
[1:47:53] has a right to say what they want to say
[1:47:56] and to spew all across the world and
[1:47:58] across the nation and across people. I
[1:48:00] say, you know what? It's a it's a
[1:48:03] marvelous miracle that anybody comes to
[1:48:05] the message
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; through all this stuff through all this
[1:48:09] garbage and here out of all of this
[1:48:11] trash here comes beautiful lives just
[1:48:14] blossoming out.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; I think glory to God. I look upon this
[1:48:19] congregation say how in the world did
[1:48:21] you even get here?
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; I've had people even come to me and say
[1:48:28] I found out so much bad things about
[1:48:30] brother Brandham. I find out I I I had
[1:48:32] to find out there must be something
[1:48:34] about him
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; or there wouldn't be people so opposed
[1:48:38] to it.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; But everybody has a right say what they
[1:48:45] want, feel what they want. And it's just
[1:48:47] amazing. I didn't say this merely to be
[1:48:50] humorous, but I say this to be truthful.
[1:48:52] We need to be very careful. I think
[1:48:56] silence
[1:48:57] is a bliss.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Keep what you think about somebody else
[1:49:05] to yourself.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Make that make that one of your
[1:49:13] laws within yourself.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; I would sooner have someone
[1:49:17] non-communicative
[1:49:20] than someone say the wrong thing
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; because it affects you.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; It affects you.
[1:49:28] In fact is I'm such a believer in that
[1:49:31] that when I hear things that I even know
[1:49:36] has an element of truth,
[1:49:39] I don't respond.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; I just listen. Mhm. Okay.
[1:49:46] Well, you don't have the whole story.
[1:49:48] That might be what I say
[1:49:50] because
[1:49:52] uh it's not going to do any good.
[1:49:55] just not going to do any good.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; But we have rights.
[1:50:00] We have rights.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; And that that right to express, you
[1:50:04] know, and say whatever you want to say
[1:50:06] and spew it to wherever you want to spew
[1:50:08] it, it's a bad one.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; It's not a good one.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; It doesn't benefit the body of Christ.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; The absolute speaks.
[1:50:18] says, "Whatsoever things are lovely,
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; whatsoever things are of a good report."
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever things are true, a lot of
[1:50:27] things are true, but they're not lovely.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; A lot of things are true are not of a
[1:50:33] good report.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; But whatsoever things are true,
[1:50:36] whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
[1:50:39] things are of a good report, think on
[1:50:42] these things. That's absolute life.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:50:47] Did Jesus major on the weaknesses of his
[1:50:50] disciples?
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Did they have them? They all had them.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; And who better
[1:51:00] could have said it
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; because what he would have said would
[1:51:03] have been exactly the truth.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; But you know what? It wasn't all lovely.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus didn't speak it.
[1:51:22] I'm just going to take a few more
[1:51:24] minutes.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; So all the congregation
[1:51:28] at the word of these spies, they lifted
[1:51:30] up their voice and they cried and the
[1:51:33] people wept that night and all the
[1:51:36] children of Israel murmured against
[1:51:38] Moses and against Aaron. Oh my,
[1:51:42] what an effect this had. Amen.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; What an effect. So now they were
[1:51:48] anticipating
[1:51:50] something.
[1:51:54] Okay, I'll say it. Said, "Bring it down.
[1:51:57] Bring it home, Brother Ed." Okay, here
[1:51:59] we are all in anticipation of the
[1:52:01] rapture.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:52:07] Each year that goes by with me, I say,
[1:52:09] "Oh, God." I think about how Brother
[1:52:11] Brandham anticipated and desired it and
[1:52:13] how Brother Daddy Dao and I sat with
[1:52:16] Sister Glattis Dao and how they desired
[1:52:18] how she desired the rapture, the change
[1:52:21] of the body. And I think of all of those
[1:52:24] ones and then, you know, I can get the
[1:52:26] thought, well, why should I think that
[1:52:28] I'm going to make it? Well, I I have a
[1:52:31] promise. And I'll tell you what, it's
[1:52:33] not just a it's not just a wishful
[1:52:34] thought. Uh I I know there are some
[1:52:37] things that I know very purposefully and
[1:52:40] I know I know that the message came to
[1:52:43] prepare people to prepare people for
[1:52:46] that.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; I know that's why it came and so I'm
[1:52:50] living in the midst of that message and
[1:52:52] I can I have every right this is where
[1:52:54] my rights are. I have my right to anchor
[1:52:58] my faith into that promise.
[1:53:02] And if I go by the way of the grave, I
[1:53:05] go by the grave way of the grave with my
[1:53:07] anchor in that promise that I am living
[1:53:10] in the era. I'm living under a message.
[1:53:14] I'm living under a messenger's
[1:53:16] announcement.
[1:53:18] And I have a right to have my anchor
[1:53:20] there.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; You have a right to have your anchor
[1:53:24] there. And then things may come, winds
[1:53:26] may come, all kinds of difficulties may
[1:53:29] come that will test that. And then you
[1:53:31] begin to think, "Oh, maybe I can't go in
[1:53:34] right now." Or or or or something's
[1:53:36] happening that's going sideways.
[1:53:41] That is when a person has to be
[1:53:43] especially careful.
[1:53:47] Especially careful. I'm speaking like a
[1:53:49] daddy now.
[1:53:51] I've I've I've witnessed parents
[1:53:56] and they oh they were so
[1:54:03] so joyous,
[1:54:05] so fulfilled
[1:54:08] when they had their little family around
[1:54:10] them
[1:54:12] and their children were all just in the
[1:54:15] house of God. And then as time went on,
[1:54:20] they began to exercise their own rights.
[1:54:24] And now the son is not sitting there
[1:54:26] with the dad anymore.
[1:54:29] And the daughter is not sitting with her
[1:54:31] mom anymore. And the family unit looks
[1:54:34] completely different.
[1:54:40] Okay,
[1:54:42] maybe you can't change that. You can't
[1:54:45] physically lay hold of them.
[1:54:48] You can't do what in your heart you'd
[1:54:51] like to do to set them there and say,
[1:54:52] "Listen, you're gonna you're going to
[1:54:54] come to church
[1:54:56] because they have their rights to
[1:54:58] express who they are and be who they
[1:55:00] are, be do what they want to do." But
[1:55:03] what should that do to your anchor?
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, nothing.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; It should not cause your faith to Wayne.
[1:55:14] It should not cause your enthusiasm to
[1:55:16] die. It should not cause your flame to
[1:55:19] become dim.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; You ought to come to the house of God.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; And be just as fervent as you ever were.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; And and and and envision them to be
[1:55:34] sitting right there beside you. Let your
[1:55:37] faith reach into the other channel and
[1:55:40] see them on the other side.
[1:55:45] Hallelujah.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Just had a few words with brother Gary.
[1:55:48] Brother Gary, excuse me, but I
[1:55:50] appreciate it. And we got talking about
[1:55:52] I said, "How's your mom and dad?" Well,
[1:55:54] this is happening. That's happening. But
[1:55:57] he says, "I know they're going to be
[1:55:58] there."
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; That's the anchor, brother Gary.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; That's the I see them on the other side
[1:56:06] because he said it.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; He told me to ask it. He told me to ask
[1:56:11] largely. He told me to ask and not doubt
[1:56:14] and I've asked and I'm believing it.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What's wrong to believe for
[1:56:19] the impossible?
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget brother Andrew from
[1:56:26] South Africa
[1:56:28] was standing here. One of our colored
[1:56:30] brothers and he stood in the church. I
[1:56:33] think maybe in the log church. It's
[1:56:35] amazing. I don't know what he preached
[1:56:36] on. I can't remember the service at all.
[1:56:40] But I know one thing he said. He said,
[1:56:42] "I'm not going to die."
[1:56:45] And the whole congregation just
[1:56:47] he felt it.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't don't take that away
[1:56:52] from me.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; That's my faith.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm believing. Don't take it
[1:57:00] away from me." I said, "God bless you,
[1:57:03] Brother Andrew. I'm not going to take
[1:57:05] that away from you. You have every right
[1:57:07] to say that because your anchor's in the
[1:57:09] promise.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; The absolute life has come.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; And I'll say we say Luke 17:30 and the
[1:57:18] revelation of the son of man and all
[1:57:19] these things. I want to put it in
[1:57:21] another context this morning as I just
[1:57:23] try to wind up. That was an absolute
[1:57:25] life.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; People don't like the absolute part of
[1:57:29] it, but I love the absolute part of it
[1:57:31] because what would we do without it?
[1:57:34] Amen.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Where would we be without it?
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; We'd be subjected to everybody's
[1:57:40] thoughts.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; I have advice all the time.
[1:57:48] Say, "Well, you need to do this. You
[1:57:50] need to do that." If I were to ask them
[1:57:52] for a scripture or something from the
[1:57:53] absolute, where's your absolute?
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; They never thought of an absolute. It's
[1:57:59] just the way I see it.
[1:58:01] Quite frankly, I'm not interested how
[1:58:03] you say it.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not even interested how I see it.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; I need to say it from the absolute.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; And on the other hand, it's unfortunate,
[1:58:13] but there'll be times that I have read
[1:58:16] expressly what the messenger has said to
[1:58:19] me. It's an absolute for this
[1:58:21] generation.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; And have people even in this
[1:58:26] congregation claiming to be believers
[1:58:29] look at it and
[1:58:33] doesn't mean anything to them.
[1:58:35] So, they don't do it
[1:58:38] or they won't even believe that we ought
[1:58:40] to do it.
[1:58:42] And I needed to say today
[1:58:45] the absolute
[1:58:48] we have an absolute for the home.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; And I don't care. You say, "Well, this
[1:58:54] happens, that happens, this that husband
[1:58:56] and this wife and that thing and the
[1:58:57] other thing is fine." All right, folks.
[1:59:01] And many of you have come from homes,
[1:59:03] but there's an absolute that's been
[1:59:05] revealed
[1:59:07] for the structure of a home.
[1:59:11] And you husbands
[1:59:13] are heads of home. And you are
[1:59:16] responsible
[1:59:18] to lead a spiritual life that your
[1:59:22] children and your wife can honor
[1:59:25] and and have have faith and confidence
[1:59:28] in. And wives likewise have a
[1:59:32] responsibility by the absolute to be
[1:59:35] obedient women to and follow their
[1:59:38] husbands as they follow the Lord. I mean
[1:59:42] the spirit, we don't want the spirit of
[1:59:44] this age to afflict
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; our sisters.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible spirit.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; I lived in my short life,
[1:59:55] you know, I was away here could get some
[1:59:57] of the CNN news and this whole e
[2:00:00] economic meltdown and things and things
[2:00:02] were going on
[2:00:04] and it was a startling thing. Forgive me
[2:00:06] for this, but I saw quite a bit of
[2:00:08] newscasts and just trying to keep a
[2:00:11] breast of what was happening. And you
[2:00:13] know, all the anchor the anchor almost
[2:00:16] all the anchor news people are women.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; I said, why aren't they home baking
[2:00:27] cookies?
[2:00:31] and the world economics and the anchor
[2:00:35] on world economics were women.
[2:00:39] I tell you what friends, you might say
[2:00:42] and don't think for a moment what's
[2:00:43] wrong with that. That's very wrong.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; That's completely backwards.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; That's completely backwards.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; That's why the world is in the state
[2:00:53] that it's in. Right. Right.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; And look what brother Brandham said
[2:01:00] about women police.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; And whether you like it or not, you have
[2:01:06] to accept that
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; because it's a part of our rights.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; But it's still wrong according to the
[2:01:15] absolute.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; It just goes completely sideways.
[2:01:21] But we have we have an order. There is
[2:01:24] an order
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; for a home.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; There's an order for home. And there's
[2:01:29] no you saying, "Well, what about this or
[2:01:31] what about that or what about what I've
[2:01:33] experienced?"
[2:01:34] I would just say to you, let your
[2:01:37] anchor,
[2:01:39] let your anchor be hooked to the
[2:01:42] promise. Make sure that it's the
[2:01:45] promise. You young people and children.
[2:01:49] Oh, listen. I'm not interested what what
[2:01:52] our nation says your rights are. I'm
[2:01:54] interested what this says your rights
[2:01:56] are. And your rights are to honor your
[2:01:59] father and your mother
[2:02:02] and listen to them that are godly. And
[2:02:04] if you have an unsaved father or mother,
[2:02:07] you pray for them or maybe both of them.
[2:02:10] I've had lots come to the me. I looked
[2:02:12] at some pictures of our early days in
[2:02:14] the early congregation and I can tell
[2:02:17] you that there were young young men and
[2:02:20] young women that came to the knowledge
[2:02:22] of the message and lived so so fervently
[2:02:25] for Christ. When I when I see those
[2:02:28] brothers from China, it it's it's not
[2:02:31] because everything is going great for
[2:02:33] them. Things may be going completely
[2:02:37] reverse for them. may be going
[2:02:39] completely wrong for them, but they're
[2:02:42] they're out there doing what they can,
[2:02:44] getting the message out to the people
[2:02:45] that they're able to get them out to.
[2:02:47] And I honor that and I respect that. And
[2:02:50] here in this congregation, we have, you
[2:02:53] know, this absolute life. Don't don't
[2:02:55] worry with what I'm saying. This
[2:02:56] absolute life covers every part
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; of every person's life that's in this
[2:03:02] building.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Every part of our life. It covers every
[2:03:07] area of our circumstances, whatever they
[2:03:10] might be.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; And there isn't anyone that has the
[2:03:14] answer for absolutely everything. There
[2:03:16] isn't. But the absolute life, even if it
[2:03:21] Oh, I I I I have to take a few minutes.
[2:03:24] Even when brother Brandham refers to
[2:03:26] Mary
[2:03:29] calling Jesus for her brother Lazarus
[2:03:32] who was dying and Jesus didn't come,
[2:03:34] didn't come. They didn't understand that
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; and they could have lost confidence in
[2:03:40] him.
[2:03:43] Your friend is sick
[2:03:46] and the master himself does not come.
[2:03:49] I can assure you
[2:03:54] if I did that be a lot of folks here
[2:03:57] really think bad
[2:04:01] say of when if I ever needed my pastor
[2:04:06] to come it was now and he didn't come I
[2:04:09] only put it in that you might say well
[2:04:11] you're not Jesus Christ and I can say
[2:04:13] well that's that's correct Jesus knew
[2:04:15] what he was going to do
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; but yet the the feeling of the people
[2:04:20] didn't change.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; They had a right to feel disappointed.
[2:04:24] But then Jesus came too late. He's been
[2:04:28] dead now.
[2:04:31] And brother Brandham says about he said
[2:04:35] that she had an Martha had an absolute
[2:04:39] in him.
[2:04:41] Even though he's gone,
[2:04:45] but I know
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; whatever you ask
[2:04:49] She had an absolute. Whatever you ask,
[2:04:53] God will do it. See, she had an
[2:04:56] absolute. Even though she didn't know
[2:04:57] how it was going to happen,
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; she didn't know when it was going to
[2:05:01] happen, but she knew that he was the
[2:05:03] resurrection and the life. She had an
[2:05:05] absolute.
[2:05:07] And that is something that we
[2:05:10] were I I'm thinking about this new year,
[2:05:13] friends.
[2:05:16] Lay aside your own thoughts, your own
[2:05:19] opinions.
[2:05:21] Lay that all aside. And especially, I
[2:05:24] plead with you. Lay aside your own
[2:05:26] reasonings.
[2:05:29] And you say, "Okay, now you've told us
[2:05:31] what to do on that side. What would you
[2:05:32] recommend we do?" I recommend I
[2:05:35] recommend with an unqualified statement,
[2:05:38] absorb yourself in the message. Amen.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Just become absorbed with the message.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you now I'm I'm giving you my
[2:05:49] own personal.
[2:05:52] I spend a lot of time in the message
[2:05:56] and I s sometimes sit there and I ask
[2:05:58] myself now
[2:06:00] am I reading this because I know I have
[2:06:02] to study for a message? Am I reading
[2:06:04] this because I know am I reading these
[2:06:07] quotes because I need a subject?
[2:06:10] This will make a great sermon, but is
[2:06:13] this why I'm reading these quotes?
[2:06:15] Because that would be the wrong purpose.
[2:06:18] Sometimes I say, "No, I'm reading these
[2:06:20] quotes." You say, "Do you talk to
[2:06:21] yourself?" Yeah, I talk to myself all
[2:06:22] the time.
[2:06:27] Why are you reading these quotes?
[2:06:29] Well, I'm reading these quotes because I
[2:06:31] want to say I want to see what he said
[2:06:34] about this. And that's a good reason.
[2:06:38] I'm reading these quotes because I'm in
[2:06:40] a certain situation. I want to find out
[2:06:42] did brother Brandham say anything about
[2:06:44] this situation. I want to say how he
[2:06:46] approached it.
[2:06:48] And sometimes I can't find anything
[2:06:51] that he said about a specific thing.
[2:06:53] Maybe I'm going through something or I'm
[2:06:55] feeling something. I don't find anything
[2:06:57] exactly like that. Then then okay, what
[2:07:00] do you do?
[2:07:02] You feel the tug of the anchor.
[2:07:06] Say, are you at home in this world? No.
[2:07:09] Do I like the world's answers? Not a
[2:07:11] bit. I don't feel a part of the world at
[2:07:14] all. I Okay, where what am I anchored
[2:07:18] to? Where's that anchor chain? Give it a
[2:07:21] good tug.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; And I find it's I find it's anchored to
[2:07:25] a promise.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; And I know that I know that this message
[2:07:31] dealt with every situation. I may not
[2:07:33] know the answer. I may not find exactly
[2:07:36] what the answer is, but I know that the
[2:07:38] I can say this, the absolute has come.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; And whatever there is in this coming
[2:07:47] year, the absolute has the absolute life
[2:07:52] has been fully manifested.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; I've seen it.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; We've heard it.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; We've tasted of it
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; of the word of life.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; How wonderful.
[2:08:04] I just want to I I just want to take
[2:08:06] about four or five minutes and then I
[2:08:07] want to close.
[2:08:10] For you that are Canadians,
[2:08:12] I'm I'm just saying it this way because
[2:08:15] there's a word I want to use that's not
[2:08:17] maybe as common
[2:08:20] uh to to
[2:08:23] other people from other nations. And the
[2:08:25] word is repatriate.
[2:08:29] Repatriate
[2:08:31] is to bring back.
[2:08:34] And the actual meaning of repatriate is
[2:08:36] this. To send somebody back to his or
[2:08:40] her country of birth,
[2:08:43] the country of which he or she is a
[2:08:45] citizen
[2:08:47] or the country from which he or she
[2:08:51] arrived.
[2:08:53] Israel happens to be a nation
[2:08:56] that has since the second world war
[2:09:01] has really exercised
[2:09:05] uh the principle of repatriation and
[2:09:08] that is
[2:09:09] Jews that have never been in Israel.
[2:09:13] They may have never been there, but
[2:09:15] they're in Europe. They're in Russia,
[2:09:18] they're in United States, and they've
[2:09:22] had a very, very high rate of success
[2:09:24] even even up till recently to repatriate
[2:09:28] their citizens back to Israel,
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; And part of the program is they pay
[2:09:35] everything.
[2:09:37] We pay it because you're a citizen. Even
[2:09:40] though you've never been here, you are
[2:09:41] in another country. You've been raised
[2:09:43] under another under a whole another
[2:09:46] constitution, but you are a citizen of
[2:09:49] this country.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Right? Yeah.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to ever forget
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; whatever you have lived, whatever
[2:09:57] circumstances you find yourself in,
[2:09:59] however you've been raised, whatever
[2:10:01] your background is, I can say to you,
[2:10:04] though you came maybe from Africa, South
[2:10:08] Africa, Europe or England or Germany or
[2:10:10] wherever you've come from, God has
[2:10:13] repatri repatriated you. And we had in a
[2:10:17] Canadian constitution. Our constitution
[2:10:21] because we came under the British
[2:10:23] Commonwealth. Our constitution was in
[2:10:26] England. The constitution of this nation
[2:10:29] was in England. And one of our prime
[2:10:32] ministers, Pierre Elliott Trudeau. It
[2:10:35] seemed that it he he became obsessed
[2:10:38] that they needed to whether it was his
[2:10:40] French background or what it was but he
[2:10:42] was obsessed that that constitution
[2:10:45] needs to be here needs to be back in
[2:10:48] this country. We need to be uh we need
[2:10:51] to have a degree of independence that it
[2:10:54] doesn't give us when this constitution
[2:10:57] our constitution for Canada rests over
[2:10:59] in England. We need to we need to
[2:11:02] separate. We need to cut this umbilical
[2:11:04] cord and we need to become a nation of
[2:11:07] our own. And it was a huge huge
[2:11:10] something that will be forever
[2:11:12] remembered as long as time goes on in
[2:11:14] the Canadian history when and they
[2:11:16] called it when our constitution was
[2:11:20] repatri repatriated from England and
[2:11:23] brought over here.
[2:11:25] And that was a that was a huge thing.
[2:11:27] and every Canadian citizen was uh you
[2:11:30] know uh understood it in in in their own
[2:11:34] unique way I I guess I would say but now
[2:11:37] we have a the spiritual aspect of it
[2:11:41] and this uh uh I'm coming to the close
[2:11:44] of my service
[2:11:46] but when God decided to send not Malachi
[2:11:50] 3 but Malachi 4
[2:11:54] he was repatriate repatriating ing the
[2:11:58] citizens.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; You've never been to the other side.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; You haven't seen it. You haven't danced
[2:12:07] on the hills of glory.
[2:12:10] But that is your real home.
[2:12:15] And I can tell you as spiritual Jews,
[2:12:20] spiritual Jews from all over the world,
[2:12:23] it was never far from their heart or
[2:12:25] from their mind or from their mouth.
[2:12:28] Home, Israel,
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; we must go back.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; That's there's something within me
[2:12:34] calling me there. It's all I can think
[2:12:36] about. It'll be hardship, but I must go
[2:12:38] back because I'm part of that. I'm part
[2:12:41] of their I I I'm I'm I'm part of their
[2:12:44] nation. I'm part that is a part of me.
[2:12:46] That is my whole life. And they lived
[2:12:48] for that moment. They saved for that
[2:12:50] moment. They put away everything they
[2:12:52] could. And they left everything
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; for that moment.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; They even left family.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; They left all their things they may have
[2:13:02] inherited.
[2:13:03] I remember speaking to
[2:13:06] one of the
[2:13:08] men that I saw who was head of a kibutz.
[2:13:12] His name was Kaman.
[2:13:14] And he said, "My father was quite a
[2:13:17] wealthy man in Austria.
[2:13:20] And he was part of I was I was one
[2:13:23] brother of several, I think four, and my
[2:13:26] my father had a successful tailoring
[2:13:28] business selling men's clothing." And he
[2:13:32] said it was uh it was understood that I
[2:13:35] would I would inherit and and and take
[2:13:37] over the business. But he said something
[2:13:40] came over me. That's exactly how he said
[2:13:42] it. Something came over me in 1939
[2:13:47] that I must come back here. And he left
[2:13:50] everything.
[2:13:52] He left everything. He left all the
[2:13:55] wealth that might have come his way. He
[2:13:57] didn't know that God was directing him
[2:13:59] and brought him right back. And he he
[2:14:01] went to a kabutz and spent his life
[2:14:03] working there. And I was I was
[2:14:05] privileged on our trip to Israel to meet
[2:14:07] one of his sons,
[2:14:09] one of his sons.
[2:14:11] But he was
[2:14:13] there had to be an act of repatriation.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:14:18] in my mind and I've been pondering this
[2:14:22] as I close now. God in his mind
[2:14:28] as he was sending this voice knowing
[2:14:31] that it's going to be heard
[2:14:34] throughout the lands in different ways
[2:14:36] but I'm going to bring them from this
[2:14:38] land because remember
[2:14:42] the Canadian Constitution was
[2:14:44] repatriated
[2:14:46] that is bringing back what was lost
[2:14:48] bringing back returning it back to its
[2:14:50] homeland.
[2:14:52] There was a there was a
[2:14:55] an original word which came
[2:14:59] and it was it's been lost over all these
[2:15:02] generations.
[2:15:03] He said, "Listen, let me let me just
[2:15:06] wind this up. I'm doing my best."
[2:15:10] He said, "There had to be a Supreme
[2:15:11] Court. There has to be an absolute. If
[2:15:14] we didn't have it, what would we do?
[2:15:16] What would we do if we didn't have it?
[2:15:18] It had to be returned. what was lost had
[2:15:21] to come back. What would we do if we
[2:15:24] didn't have Do I Do I exercise
[2:15:26] everything that everything that Adam
[2:15:28] lost? No. I I don't see it personally in
[2:15:31] my life. But does that mean that I
[2:15:33] should not as an individual believe what
[2:15:36] was spoken whether I have it now or
[2:15:39] whether I have it on the other side is
[2:15:41] really irrelevant to me. My anchor and
[2:15:44] my anchor chain is hooked into the
[2:15:47] promise that everything that was lost by
[2:15:50] the first Adam has been returned and
[2:15:53] repatriated back. Hallelujah.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; By the second Adam
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; absolute
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; life
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; absolute attributes
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; healing. If you're here and you've been
[2:16:09] uh and you're held down by some kind of
[2:16:11] a bondage,
[2:16:13] let it be announced
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; under the repatriation
[2:16:18] of our constitution,
[2:16:20] that thing doesn't have power over you.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; That sickness doesn't have a right to
[2:16:27] your body.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; The constitution has been repatriated.
[2:16:35] The promises have been returned.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30. Finally, the son has been
[2:16:42] manifested,
[2:16:43] [Music]
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; and thou shalt bring forth a son,
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; and thou shalt call his name Jesus.
[2:16:50] He'll save his people from their sins.
[2:16:52] And I say to you today on the authority
[2:16:55] of God's revealed word, the
[2:16:58] constitution, our constitution, of our
[2:17:00] nation, our Christian nation has been
[2:17:03] repatriated. And that's the law I live
[2:17:06] under.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; I give glory to him.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to you? I was touched
[2:17:20] in a special way. But what does it mean
[2:17:22] to you? You know, all of you that are
[2:17:24] here, you know, and I know and you've
[2:17:26] heard it so many times. He took the
[2:17:28] book.
[2:17:31] What was it in God's mind when he was
[2:17:34] showing John and John's looking? John's
[2:17:37] weeping. No one can take the book.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Weep not John. The lion of the tribe of
[2:17:43] Judah has prevailed.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Looks to see the lion sees a lamb.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; And you know that that was physically
[2:17:51] taking place
[2:17:53] during the prophet's ministry.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what took place. Yes.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; What was it? It wasn't brother Brandham
[2:18:01] reaching and taking his Bible. It was
[2:18:03] the lamb in his ministry.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; Actually taking taking the book. It
[2:18:10] wasn't one of our prime ministers of
[2:18:12] Canada going over and receiving the the
[2:18:15] Constitution of the United States. It
[2:18:17] was the lamb himself
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; repatriating,
[2:18:21] taking back the book.
[2:18:25] Amen.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, worthy, worthy, worthy is the lamb.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; And he took the book.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he's doing. He's
[2:18:37] repatriating, taking it back. And that
[2:18:39] was in the ministry of the messenger.
[2:18:41] And you are here, friends, today. Don't
[2:18:44] let the devil, don't let the atmosphere
[2:18:46] of this world impose something on you.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Even in the midst of it,
[2:18:55] Maybe it looks like your circumstances
[2:18:57] around you spell defeat.
[2:19:00] Be like the young slave boy. The young
[2:19:03] man,
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; he ate with all the others.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; He had all the circumstances of being a
[2:19:10] slave.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; But he would not bend to it.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; He held his shoulders back. He put his
[2:19:16] chest out. He was different because he
[2:19:18] come from a different land.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; He had a different culture.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; Don't whatever you do bow down and
[2:19:28] become uh become burdened and heavy and
[2:19:30] overweighted with the circumstances
[2:19:33] around this world. Deny them.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; I'm from a different country.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; I have a different citizenship.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; I'm under a different constitution.
[2:19:47] Amen.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; And remember,
[2:19:50] when the laws and the liberties,
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; the laws and the liberties of your land,
[2:19:56] and we're happy for them, but remember,
[2:20:00] bear it in mind. Don't forget these
[2:20:02] words, they all shall pass away.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; And your liberties may change in
[2:20:10] Washington tomorrow morning. Your
[2:20:12] liberties in Canada or other parts of
[2:20:15] the country may change. You may say,
[2:20:17] "Oh, it's becoming more liberal." Or,
[2:20:19] "No, it's becoming more tight." Who
[2:20:20] cares what happens?
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; They'll do what they're going to do.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; But your liberties under this
[2:20:26] constitution that I'm speaking of that
[2:20:28] was repatriated under Luke 17:30. It was
[2:20:31] the revealing of the son of man.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; It came back. The life came back. The
[2:20:39] whole ministry came back. All the
[2:20:41] attributes have been displayed. They've
[2:20:43] come back.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; An absolute life.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; We're not sitting here today, oh, just
[2:20:49] a, oh, how wonderful. Praise the Lord.
[2:20:51] Getting a good feeling over that. No,
[2:20:53] it's for you in every daily life, every
[2:20:55] part of your life.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm so fervent about it, friends.
[2:21:08] I'm so fervent. I'm having a hard time,
[2:21:09] but I am closing. So fervent about it.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; It is yours.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; It is mine.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; Like brother Gier sings, I'll die
[2:21:25] believing it.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Or I'll be changed believing it.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; I'll be raptured believing it. But it's
[2:21:31] what I believe. It's what I want you to
[2:21:33] believe.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:37] Just don't let anything that comes by
[2:21:38] your way or anything comes across your
[2:21:40] path change that.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand as we sing once again.
[2:21:45] We're going to pray first. And I wonder,
[2:21:47] brother Jason, if I can have you helping
[2:21:49] me, please.
[2:21:55] Let's just bow our heads.
[2:21:58] There may be somebody
[2:22:01] and whoever you might be
[2:22:04] here amongst us today
[2:22:07] said, "Brother Ed, I believe what has
[2:22:09] been spoken
[2:22:11] and I believe that this this absolute
[2:22:14] has come and been spoken on my behalf. I
[2:22:18] believe it with everything that's within
[2:22:19] me. And I am standing here today and I
[2:22:22] want to declare
[2:22:25] my full agreement and belief and faith
[2:22:30] in this constitution, this pro this this
[2:22:34] promise of God. I raise my hands to
[2:22:38] heaven
[2:22:40] in defiance
[2:22:42] of this age and in defiance of all that
[2:22:46] the world would try to impose upon me. I
[2:22:49] raise my hands in defiance to every
[2:22:53] device of the enemy,
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; to every lie of Satan, and in the name
[2:22:59] of Jesus Christ. Oh God, both of my
[2:23:02] hands raised up because I want to stand
[2:23:04] with a testimony tonight, today, this
[2:23:07] morning, that I am in direct opposition
[2:23:10] to what the enemy would impose upon this
[2:23:13] your blood bought. These people, these
[2:23:16] people, oh God, have been purchased with
[2:23:17] your own blood. They've been purchased
[2:23:19] with the most costly uh costly price.
[2:23:23] And so I pray, Father, in the name of
[2:23:25] Jesus Christ, that every attribute of
[2:23:28] that life will become in full in full
[2:23:31] force in every life. Lord, I know there
[2:23:34] are some here that are suffering
[2:23:36] physically, oh God. And while that may
[2:23:38] be considered a minor thing for some,
[2:23:40] for them that are suffering, it's a very
[2:23:42] important, a major thing. I we we deny
[2:23:45] the enemy. We resist the enemy. Oh God,
[2:23:49] I pray that you'll come to their aid. Do
[2:23:51] the supernatural. We're calling for a
[2:23:53] miracle. We're calling for miracles.
[2:23:56] Will the congregation call with me? We
[2:23:58] need miracles. Oh God, let these
[2:24:01] miracles take place. We rejoice, oh God,
[2:24:04] in this complete power. I pray, Father,
[2:24:07] that it will be done for the glory of
[2:24:10] God. Thank you for what you have done.
[2:24:12] We thank you, Lord, for the glorious
[2:24:15] things that you have done. And yet,
[2:24:17] we're looking for more, oh Lord Jesus.
[2:24:21] Thank you for your word. Thank you for
[2:24:23] your absolute that you have sent. And
[2:24:26] now I pray father that as the people
[2:24:28] ponder and they think and meditate upon
[2:24:31] these things that you will cause it to
[2:24:34] be reverberate within them a life oh God
[2:24:39] the life that has come to seed once
[2:24:42] again in Jesus name. Jesus name.
[2:24:47] Hallelujah.
[2:24:49] Hallelujah.
[2:24:52] Like to sing that one once again
[2:24:53] brother. The anchor holds.

[2:27:46] we have. I was looking for the song. I
[2:27:48] have an anchor that keeps his soul
[2:27:50] steadfast and sure while the billows
[2:27:52] roll.
[2:27:54] By the way, uh let's sing the little
[2:27:57] chorus. Uh I have an anchor in my life
[2:27:59] holding to a solid rock 365.

[2:29:50] Thank you. I couldn't find it. There.
[2:29:52] The brothers found it.
[2:29:54] Let's sing that chorus. We have an
[2:29:56] anchor that keeps the soul steadfast and
[2:29:58] sure while the billows roll. And I'm
[2:30:01] singing this for a purpose.
[2:30:04] I think we either need it,
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; will need it,
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; have needed it.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've come through. Have you come
[2:30:13] through some storms?
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; 208 may give us some storms. 209 may
[2:30:19] give us some more.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; But I have an absolute says we'll crest

[2:30:51] fastened to the rock that cannot move.
[2:30:56] grounded perfectly in the Savior.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; Just a moment. How many don't know that
[2:31:03] song?
[2:31:05] Oh my.
[2:31:07] Don't Don't feel bad about raising your
[2:31:09] hand. I can tell you one thing. Your
[2:31:11] prophet knew it.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:15] Just had to say that, did, didn't I? All
[2:31:19] right. Here's one that he sang.

[2:32:12] afternoon. Brother Tom will be speaking
[2:32:15] 5:00.
[2:32:17] We'll just pray.
[2:32:20] What a delight it is, oh God,
[2:32:23] for me just to bow
[2:32:26] with each of these dear ones.
[2:32:29] How precious they are to you. Father, I
[2:32:32] ask in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll
[2:32:35] forgive us our errors, our sins, our
[2:32:38] iniquities.
[2:32:40] Let the word now just wash us and
[2:32:42] cleanse us. And we are testifying, Lord,
[2:32:44] all of these people that have come this
[2:32:46] morning and have spent this perhaps
[2:32:48] lengthy service. And we've come, oh God,
[2:32:52] driven these highways, but we've been
[2:32:55] desiring that something be anchored in
[2:32:58] our soul. I pray father that you will
[2:33:00] make your promises alive.
[2:33:04] Quicken the minds to them and do all the
[2:33:08] things that we need done and dis
[2:33:11] disperse us now from this service Lord
[2:33:14] with your grace upon our lives in Jesus
[2:33:16] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. We're
[2:33:20] dismissing you. Thank you for your time.
[2:33:21] Thank you for your patience.
[2:33:23] You've been really attentive and I just
[2:33:26] wanted to get this far with this
[2:33:28] message. God bless you. You're dismissed
[2:33:30] in Jesus name.
