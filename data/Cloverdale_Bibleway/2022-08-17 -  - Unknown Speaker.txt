sister ann the family the church back home and it's really an honor to be here and brother tom said it's from glory to glory how many believe that it is from glory to glory victory to victory amen so i was going to ask how many have a pentecostal jubilee and i don't want to say since last camp since last night so i'm asking you the question how many have a pentecostal jubilee since last night don't be shy now come on we're at camp and i'm not talking about the organization i'm talking about an experience a life-changing experience amen many people can say a lot about it amen but i think listen to what the prophet says if pentecost started off back there with that kind of a free and going free-hearted and free in the spirit and everything i think you better go and you do your first works over again get back to the old landmark again where it started listen i'm not done yet come back again to believing in god come back to letting the holy spirit have its way in your heart to worshiping god in the spirit and doing like they used to do get that old starchy indifferent feeling away from you get that old starchy feeling away from you maybe some people don't like it when i say it but like brother brother wayne said it you have to take the whole book the whole message amen so get that that starchy feeling in different way from you amen oh you can't have a church like that you can have believers like that well hallelujah i don't want to have a dead church god intended for his church to be a living church of the living god he said because i live ye shall live also amen amen amen so i'm not dead this morning and he is not dead and you i've seen i've said it many times to young people and i saw you jump and we were talking with brother murphy we see young people jump wow it's like they have springs under their shoes and they're playing volleyball get in the atmosphere amen but what about the word when the word's been opened up amen when we hear the word something on the inside is babbling and say amen amen and he's worthy of my praise amen listen we are at the end of the road and we thank god for some caleb some joshuas that's ready to go over how many are ready this morning to go over not stand here oh and another no we gonna go over possess the land possess the inheritance amen hallelujah go over and bring back the evidence hallelujah it's a great land thank god for people who's crossed over out of their old formal shackled down ungodly church let me drop some bombs here a moss back condition you can look it up i checked it in the dictionary i don't want to have a moss back condition hallelujah he continues brother he says got to a place where they stepped over in canaan's land and eat a lot of good grapes i feel good when i read that you know what he says eat a lot of good grapes that even make you slobber in the pulpits so don't think i'm acting crazy don't think i'm i'm out of myself ahead of me or whatever you may name it i'm a fanatic i'm a holy roller you name it what hey the prophet said slobber in the pulpit but now it's not only for the pulpit it's for all of us amen i'm not i don't want to be bolted down i don't want to be oh i'm afraid to say amen no i want to say amen let it be so hallelujah amen amen hallelujah some of the good old-fashioned drunk on the wine like peter drang that day of pentecost when the power of god took over the church that's the pentecostal jubilee hallelujah so ready let's have church hallelujah let's open our our bibles maybe some are here this morning and and mom and dad said you have to go to camp or some are here and i just want to meet somebody or no matter what the reason is one thing is sure god has an appointment with you here and god never fails and if there is anything we've received a blessing yesterday god was so good to us but we want another blessing this morning amen so no matter what it is amen isaiah he speaks about the spirit of heaviness so if there is anything left yet here that is is bolting you down that is keeping you bound any spirit of heaviness my prayer is this morning that it may be changed amen in a garment of praise as thus said the prophet isaiah in a garment of praise hallelujah and i want to talk about the main thing jesus christ while you go to the book of ephesians 1 i just want to tell you story before we read it where brother branham he speaks about probably you heard it about this poor man and he he found this flower and he takes this flower and this flower says you know whatever you ask i'll give it to you of course it's a story and i hear this man he says well if i'm a poor man if you could open this mountain and i could find gold riches i would be such a happy man so the mountain opens up here he goes he sees all this gold diamonds whatever you name it takes as much as he can but the flower said i will always have to be with you now he takes whatever he can carry goes out flower says hey don't forget me now oh yeah while he comes back oh there's still another bigger diamond let me take that one so i must show my friends i'm no poor man anymore i'm a rich man now flower says don't forget the main thing here oh yeah that's right maybe in my left pocket i still have some space left take some more eventually he goes out flower says don't forget the main thing he said oh shut up and goes and everything closes because he forgot the main thing now i'm talking spiritually brother branham uses it as a story as an example but i'm talking spiritually here don't forget the main thing the main thing of camp is we can have activities they're wonderful we love them but the main thing is to have jesus christ to have a life-changing experience amen we can have activities and other activities amen but one encounter with god is changing you completely and that's what these meetings are all about amen so ephesians 1 verse 17 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of our understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints verse 19 and what is the exceeding greatness and and and the lexicon in greatness says megatoss meaning magnitude the exceeding magnitude of his power then the the lexicon says dynamis it's a force a miraculous power a strength a resource a host listen not done yet power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature so and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and had put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that fill it all in all the amplified of verse 22 and 23 says and he put all things in every realm in subjection under christ's feet and appointed him as supreme and authoritative head over all things in the church which is his body the fullness of him who fills and completes all things in all may god add the blessing to the reading of his word let's have a word of prayer our dear heavenly father lord once again we counted such a great honor and privilege lord to be standing here on holy ground father lord this is not just another meeting lord this is an encounter with you father lord we know that we are standing on holy ground angels are all around father because you are here to meet us to bless us to fill us to change us and lord god we pray oh may you give us a greater revelation lord to each and every one of us father may we know our position lord and father god may you take full control over the service lord and take take me out of the way father and may you speak through me lord god and oh break break the bread of life to us father how thankful we are lord we ask these things in the wonderful name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen you may be seated so for a title this morning is it okay if if we had the first round yesterday night so if is it okay brother wayne mentioned the whipping sorry brother wayne that's powerful i i rather use the word knockout so this is the second round so if it's okay with you but we're all together in this let's have a second knockout come on church let's have a second knock out because oh how thankful we can be amen that a mighty angel came down a mighty angel came down and revealed me who he was amen when the word was opened up when the seals were broken it was revealing christ who he was amen and i'm a part of christ so it's revealing who i am it's important we read the word it's important we listen to what god wants to say to us so we know who we are because we live in an age loudly see an age where where everything becomes lukewarm and it comes to such a point where even in the message well the days of miracles have passed you know we live in a time where well you know at the time of brother branham a lot of miracles happen and nowadays well when i pray i don't even know if lord will answer and and i've asked and and i prayed and and i don't know if god is is still working that is satan the spirit the antichrist spirit trying to work on your mind telling you that he is dead that god is dead but i'm here this morning to say that he is alive god has never lost his power are we going to see what god's plan is for us amen we heard it last night those that know their god they will do exploits [Music] come on so the moment you doubt the weapon says the prophet he's got you then so the moment you start so i'm gonna deal with all these these spirits where oh god doesn't save anymore god doesn't seal anymore god doesn't heal anymore god doesn't bring backsliders back that's nonsense that's nonsense god is still the same this morning so i'm gonna bring it from another corner amen and for a title i'd like to take i speak jesus hallelujah amen let me remind you we're fighting a defeated enemy is that all that that makes me want to shout we are fighting a defeated enemy now brother david i'm i'm going through hearts and some hardship so what he's still a defeated enemy so i'm going to read a few verses here colossians 2 verse 9 for in him dwell at all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power now daniel 2 34 thou saw still that a stone was cut out with our hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces matthew 21 42 you don't need to just listen jesus said unto them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes matthew 21 44 and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will ground him to powder 1 peter 2 6 wherefore also it is contained in the scriptures behold i lay in zion achieve cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded or shall not be put to shame or to a blush so there's no reason for us to be put out of blush or have shame no no i speak jesus he is still the same god now we see the image you can say well that's in the book of daniel it's a prophetic book brethren says i chose the book of daniel because it was a pre-shadow of the great day that we're living in now the gentile age and everything in the gentile age just how one kingdom will succeed to another until it come down to the very end days that we are living in now so we see amen it goes from gold the head of gold the breast of silver the ties of brass legs of iron the feet of iron and clay so it's it's a the gentile age but where are we at now amen i don't want to go in all the details because that's a sermon in itself amen but just where are we at now brother branham he speaks in conference he says chris and you've heard that before but just i'm just building up here khrushchev means in russia dirt or clay eisenhower means the head of this is iron iron and clay they couldn't mix together they won't cleave one to another the next thing left is the stone to be cut out the coming of the lord to roll into this image and mash it into pieces so what time are we living in the end of the end time that's what is left this stone to come and mash it to pieces let's continue that stone the christ jesus that stumbling stone to the word a stone of an offense a laughing stone a stumbling block to the church but precious stone now sisters you all love stones i know the bigger the diamond the bigger the sapphire the bigger the ruby the more you love it ah come on yes but we're talking here about a more precious stone which is christ jesus so nothing against liking a diamond and and oh i have nothing against that but i'm preaching about somebody who is more precious than gold more precious than anything than anything this world can offer it's a precious stone a load stone to the believer a stone of assurance a stone of rest now listen a lodestone i checked it up you know what the definition is of a lodestone a piece of magnetite or other naturally magnetized mineral able to be used as a magnet or other definition is a person or thing that is the focus of attention or attraction what's the attraction on mount baker camp there is an attraction and it's a reality it's not something makeup it's not just an emotion it is a reality it is a life may there come forth this great issue of this rock that is cut out of the mountain without hands so it doesn't need any help of any man god builds his own church man can build kingdoms i've been last week we were in france somewhere we visited a stronghold of the 11th century that sounds old and it is old well whatever was in his room was remaining so man can build tremendous beautiful things but they don't last but what god builds is eternal so don't build your hopes on sinking sand but build everything on the solid rock i stand hallelujah it'll crush these gentile kingdoms to the ground all these kingdoms spiritual kingdoms natural kingdoms and the rock will cover the whole earth it will be purified purified air those who the rock crush will be ground into powder and those who fall upon that rock shall have a solid foundation that's the foundation i want to be building on brother branham talking about this lodestone magnet he says i'm thinking about another great magnet hallelujah someday there'll be a sound like a rushing mighty wind and here he will come and all those that are magnetized to his spirit will go up to meet him in the air those that are shackled down with sin those that are aluminum aluminum church members so we don't want to be church members i'm a church girl well that's that doesn't help you a thing i want to count well so what if that's why you came i went to camp you will go out and you say i was at camp but if you come under such desperation i want to meet god i had struggle in my life i'm fighting with this giant with that giant but time has come i will take possession [Music] is it possible oh yes i'll prove it by the word those that are shackled down with sin those that are aluminum church members will never make it oh my what a day that will be keep my soul magnetized lord with your spirit above all things that should be our soul desire keep my soul magnetized to you lord the song that was cut is ready to come at any time he says and when it comes what does it do it does away with this gentile age amen it's all over and god completely quits dealing with them my god gives us this time amen to be ready but there will be a time that it's over with so we're not playing games here it's serious yes it is it's all over and god completely quits dealing with him what does he do then he takes his church the holy ghost filled and only those that are filled magnetized as the prophet said with the holy ghost will be raptured that's why he uses a prophet this example of a magnet a stumbling stone some make fun of it laugh about it but it's a load song to the believer it's a magnet there's virtue in it amen because he wants to attract his people to himself we've got to be magnetized to the headstone and the headstone is the holy ghost christ and every one of us that's got the magnetism of the holy spirit when that stone strikes the image the church will flee to it back into glory what is he doing he's painting us a picture and what is it a holy ghost filled church he foreordained before the beginning of the world to appear yonder in his glory and one of these great mornings oh some good morning when time will be over i fly away we've sung that and sung that and sung that but it's a reality amen and you i we are gonna live it [Music] some of these great mornings he will sweep down true from the heavens amen hallelujah like a great magnet and we'll pick up that little church that has been persecuted hang her yonder in the hall of fame and when she goes to the sky she's shouting whoa so she's not sitting down buckle down shackled down bound down no i will not bow down i will not bend down i will give glory to god and either you worship satan or other you worship god either you talk satan's language either you talk god's language but as for me and my house i will serve my lord satan hates hates it when we speak about the oneness of god he just gets so angry at that see the oneness of god all that god was yes he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into his church there you are that makes him all one come on now the oneness of the goddess is all the way from genesis 1 1 to revelation 22 21 as god was in christ listen christ in you when what god did in christ christ does in you but wayne touched on that saying lord don't let him go too far jesus said at that come on help me now church what day come on we can say this day this friday morning this day that's this day at that day when this revelation is made known those that know their god they will do exploits amen hallelujah you will know that i am in the father and the father and me and i and you and you and me that's this day oh brother david i've heard that before well you know what i've heard that before i've preached it before maybe i didn't preach it here or at cloverdale or somewhere else but i even believe it more now than when i preached it last time like brother wayne said amen we're not becoming weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker we're becoming stronger and stronger abraham's seed he grows stronger and stronger in the faith because a mighty angel came down with an open book amen to give us perfect faith [Music] so he is the great magnet the messiah and we are the messiahs i am the vine you are the branches he is a messiah and a messiah amen amen and once they come one you know a magnet is most powerful when it's in contact that is god's incredible math so no matter what class you're in i'm going to make it very easy mathematics for believers you know not for dummies for believers one their head and one makes one oh brother david you will miss your exam well i don't care about missing my exam but i'm sure i will make it to the rapture because one my head is christ he's a great messiah he's a big magnet amen when he unites with his bride they're no more twain there is one body hallelujah we see the bride uniting says the prophet uniting with the word why the word is god and as the word as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hearer of the word they come together in a union they unite like a wedding you see they're getting ready for a wedding they become one the word becomes you you become the word what day this day what's the secret very simple the word is in the bride you had a you had a wedding recently huh what was it two weeks ago brother tom you're your sister no yeah i just went and when brother tom presents may i present to you for the first time in public mr and mrs forgive me i forgot i forgot the name but mr and mrs jesus christ there was such a rejoicing i can hear i could hear them scream oh no that's only for the the sorry for the african people that's rubbish [Music] that's only for a certain nationality no don't give me that because if you will not give our lord praise these rocks will cry out and when this uniting is going on just like brother brown and says there will be shouting there's gonna be shouting now and there's gonna be shouting there all the hills of glory rory glory now when two omnipotents meet what happens the miraculous takes place listen a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent mark 11 20 22 says whatsoever things you say listen now my title i speak jesus now whatever things whatsoever things you say and dumb doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you have said [Music] what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together to omnipotence something's got to shake and something is happening right now something is shaking what is shaking satan's kingdom satan shackles he's holding you bound but they're shaking and you're gonna be loosed in jesus name [Music] something has to happen let's continue whatsoever you'd say with a create with whom ah with that creative power of the omnipotence of god knowing that he's promised it did he did he promise you something no come on you can do better than that did he promise you something and he said it in his word it creates a power you know when you take god at his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not and it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met there he stands [Music] so don't tell me the days of miracles are old don't tell me that god doesn't heal anymore that god doesn't save anymore that god doesn't seal anymore that god doesn't restore families anymore that god doesn't bring black sliders back anymore don't give it to me my god is still the same [Music] christ is that stone he wasn't born of man he was born of god and he's coming for a church that's been reborn again by the spirit of god listen now i'm joining you brother with a wayne cause the strength of that headstone runs all through the church like a magnet [Music] where's our strength coming from our strength cometh from our lord glory glory oh maybe i feel weak this morning don't rely on your senses don't rely on your feelings did you feel it no he said did you believe it and i said yes lord i believe it i believe it hallelujah so many people today they put their trust in all kinds of things they go see a specialist what's called a specialist a professor a doctor i have nothing against them a counselor who has a doctor degree oh i beg your pardon yeah there's no place for satan here anyway oh let me check on google what what what google says about the message let let me check on google you know let's google it it's become common language let's google it let's google it what what daniel 2 meant or what daniel when he said those are know their god they will do x let's google it you know what i believe google he's an egyptian so many people live under bondage under bondage of internet amen let me see and here we have a mighty angel coming down with an open book revealing all the secrets all the mysteries they're a slave of google but i faced the book no facebook no i'm not talking i face the book what does he say about me i can do all things through christ who strengthens me he is my strength the headstone the power amen the magnet amen his power flows through amen amen i take god's word god's promise above anything else the doctor says you have cancer i take god and he says by his stripes i am already here let's see what google says how i can overcome in this age google will say impossible but my word says i am more than an overcomer [Music] so who do you want to believe google equals satan think of it the if the people of israel if they would have gone to the pharaoh and says well you dow great one pharaoh i don't know how they they talk to the pharaoh but anyway trying to explain it to you what do you think about god sending a deliverer well that's satan that's google but it's satan because that's exactly how he he treats you he's playing with your mind well what you know what do you think about singing a deliverer and and impossible i have the greatest army i am the strongest on this whole world we'll come to a little later how god deals how god works god he is almighty so brother branham he says let us fit ourselves to meet that cornerstone that's why we are here we want to be ready do you want to be ready do you want to be ready we're not playing games brothers and sisters no matter how young or how old you can be this is serious because the bible says in revelation his wife has made herself ready so god made everything he gave everything to his bride to prepare herself to adorn herself so that spiritual union of christ and his church now when that flesh is becoming word don't fall asleep on me now i told you already that one has a jet lag it's me and the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated just what the bible said would happen in this day we just all said it together what day this day amen and he says here amen exactly what the bible said would happen in this day and it's happening day by day meeting after meeting so this is the second round total knockout and when i say total knock knockout it's not because of the preacher total knockout for each and every one of you you start claiming your god-given privileges start naming it i speak jesus over my sickness i speak jesus over my family i speak jesus over my trouble come on church there is power in the name of jesus hallelujah glory glory we know the jews are in their homeland the gentile apostasy has already taken place brother branham says we have a president like we have that doesn't only apply to the us that applies to canada to france to everywhere we have the presidents that we have we have a nation that's broke up like we have atomic bombs are hanging in the hangars and we have a church that is lukewarm but we have a church of people that's pulled their selves together at mount baker camp hallelujah we have a ministry that patterns the ministry of jesus christ for to catch that stone when he comes he says what's left to happen it can happen any minute any minute we see that the disciples they received a promise jesus told him go wait in jerusalem until you are endued with power so they knew they needed something so here they go to the upper room and the bible says they were in one accord that didn't mean they had a meeting and let's sit together and you know brother wayne what did he mean when he said i will send you power and let's have a meeting and we'll discuss you know like the council the council of nicaea where let's let's talk about what the bible means what god means what the message means what the the message is so clear it's only people that try to take the message and make it of non-effect thinking they have deep revelations might as well drop these bonds they have one thing in common and that was we need that power what happened once they got the experience acts 4 7 says and when they had set them in the midst they asked you know the story about the lame man by what power or by what name have you done this a man lame year in year out sitting there and now rejoicing shouting dancing in the spirit acts 4 10 says be it known unto ye all and to all the people around the world it says of israel i'm saying of all the world that by the name of jesus christ whom he crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him that this man stand here before you whole and it ain't done verse 11 says this is the stone which was set at nod of you builders and which has become the head of the corner hallelujah the prophet says it may be later than we think so i i hope you realize that this is a state of emergency the president's loved or the the government's love to say it when covert was around state of emergency but here the prophet says it's maybe later than we think you see that's exactly scriptural the stone with our hands cut out of the mountain and so on of these days it's going to be that way when you're going to stream for something i said to them you've already had that time god has constantly warned you time after time i even said it to my own kids why do you quote that brother david so we realize that we need jesus christ in our lives he gave dominion over all things we know adam and eve and he gave he they had dominion over all things he has lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain satan took it over but brother i love that end part brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god who will come back and take it over again now how many do we have at camp that can say amen i'm one of them don't do it don't do it for brother david don't do it for bread of tom don't do it for them don't you confess to god what you believe amen who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of god will me be manifested what time is this this day this time let's take an example in the bible moses coming back to egypt google moses has an encounter with a burning bush the burning bush had what moses lacked now here he receives word where you will go and you will deliver my people and we see in the bible it says i believe it's exodus 4 where moses starts negotiating where he says i i'm i'm the least of of you know i i have no capacity no capability whatsoever i i i cannot even speak properly i have no power no might of myself i and god just reminds him who tell me moses who created your mouth it's not enough so moses continues i have nothing what do you have in your hand a rod well go and deliver my people now lord this is not really a weapon of mass destruction this is the most powerful army in the earth all over the world and i'm going with a stick now moses let me remind you if they ask you who sends you i am not i will be not i was i am that i am this morning he is still the i am amen for each and every one of you he is still the i am therefore i speak jesus he goes out now somebody crosses moses where are you going moses well going down to egypt to take over a one-man evasion we all love that story but now it's a one man a one woman battle against all these principalities the word has been spoken is being preached but it's our own battle brother wayne touch on it we have our giants in our lands in our land but we have to fight them going down a one-man invasion going down to take over egypt and he he links it it's like going to take over russia the best mechanized units in the world was right there but god told him i'm going to send you down to take over moses nah you're not serious brother david you're not serious have you lost your mind oh yeah i lost my mind i've got christ's mind amen that's what matters we have to be renewed in our mind amen when the word is being spoken we say i believe it lord because satan attacks here so moses if he would have walked by his mind by his intellect his intelligence he would have stayed home but who had the victory at the end now what that stick was in moses hand listen now church don't get quiet i mean what that stick represented this arm of mass destruction is the name of jesus christ to the born-again church i speak jesus do you hear me moses had a victory with a rod but now we have the name of jesus for our battles come on and of course we have carnal impersonators of the message that's what the prophet says just like moses had to face them here he comes let my people go i'm the deliverer god sends me i am sends me let my people go moses come on let's be serious throws down the rod oh we have some people that can do the same thing okay continue the quote carnal impersonators of the message try to mimic the same thing without knowing where it's coming from i love that notice the same shepherd staff that fell on the ground eat ate up the other snakes where was them snakes at they were rods on the floor and there was only one rod picked up both heavens and earth will pass away said jesus but my word shall never pass away god shows day and day in day out time and time again his supremacy you following when jesus came to jerusalem still building up it's got plenty of time he came into jerusalem and everybody was hosanna hosanna and there we can see already the same antichrist spirit working don't worship him that's where he says if they won't cry out those stones will cry if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out what was it listen now the very rock that was hewed out of the mountain without hands was coming rolling into jerusalem come on now and us little rocks was drinking from it hallelujah how many are thirsty here this morning i'm not speaking naturally here because once you drink of this water that this rock gives you will never thirst again [Music] amen so he was coming and amen these little rocks was drinking from it speak to the rock and it will bring forth its water [Music] so now later on we can see israel they go through hardship they go through problems amen and brethren says amen the people in the testing time drops away like israel did i have a trial i'm i'll drop everything no don't drop everything listen to that quote the people in the testing time drops away like israel did they think that god has left them oh what a lie satan brings in your mind makes you think that god doesn't love you anymore that god doesn't forgive that god doesn't save that god doesn't feel that god doesn't deliver us that's what satan tries but remember the rock never left israel israel left the rock and it forgot about the rock being with them all the time it wasn't out of speaking distance [Music] come on now it wasn't out of speaking distance it wasn't out of hearing distance it wasn't out of seeing distance and neither is christ with the church today he is not out of speaking distance so what are you going to say speak to the rock this morning i speak jesus over my trouble i speak jesus over my sickness i speak jesus over my situation start confessing it start believing it start thanking god for it the problem is we walk by reasoning too uh much david i spoke last last service you know i i i confessed the victory but let me continue to build up a little okay because god is not out of speaking distance he's not out of hearing distance he is still present help in a time of trouble he's a very present help if you're sick speak to the rock if you're sin sick speak to the rock if you're weary speak to the rock see the rock the driest place in the wilderness but he said speak to the rock and i believe sorry brother wayne i added in my notes so i'm going to quote it again i believe that there's a church on its road this morning a power of the living god where man will speak the word here and there and it will flash like lightning come on saints [Applause] satan can't bluff me anymore am i the only one or are we just the only ones bluffing i'm not made of that stuff says brother i'm not that bluffs i'm made of that stuff that he creates i'm his workmanship it'll flash like lightning amen amen amen oh if the church could ever get to that place to where it solemnly rests upon god's eternal word to be the truth what a difference there would be are you hearing me what a correcting there would be what a cutting away where there it would be that's why it's coming to a minority we see people dropping left right thousand may drop my left ten thousand my right but i'm going all the way i'm going all the way i started on this journey many years ago amen by god's grace he will bring me all the way hallelujah amen now he continuously says what a joy there would be what a power there would be when men and women would take god at face value what he said is the truth no matter what the circumstances look like that has nothing to do with it god said so that settles it [Music] enough with this nonsense the time of miracles are gone enough with it he is still god therefore i speak jesus and annie no matter what the circumstance may look like amen in this camp i speak jesus amen there is no other name is a name above all names what should be our attitude amen oh the countdown is on and he said he starts counting 10 9 8 they won't be crying but there will be singing and shouting and praising god i think the brothers reminded you last night there's nothing against true worship i'm not talking about emotion i'm talking about true worship when the people of god got delivered out of years and years of bondage they didn't go out there you know oh well you know poor me they were rejoicing they were shouting so what about us what about us when we see god's plan for us in our lives noah let's take another example he received the promise of god he was building an ark amen he was not only working a miracle but he was preparing for a miracle did we come to camp preparing for a miracle now maybe if you didn't come i'm i'm i'm just preaching the word of god but saying encouraging you come to church prepared for the miraculous the phenomenal to take place because god is still god this morning and still tonight until i'm leaving we're leaving this place so noah he was getting ready for a miracle and the church today is not only having miracles but it's preparing for a miracle the coming of the lord jesus and the rapture of the church and he says he says give me a church come on now ready visualize to see signs and to see the omnipotent god the great power of god moving amongst the people oh the rapture will be an easy thing explain me how will it don't worry about explanation the prophet tells me it's an easy thing i was i am no more we might get into that later today oh my it'll be a regular routine listen of following the scriptures and the plans of god the word of god can never fail remember christ and the true church is a continuation of a book of acts through who through us he is the power but now the magnet the magnetism goes from the head through us from the messiah to them through the messiahs come on now glory christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts and he knows that's why satan hates this revelation like brother wayne reminded us the people who know who have a revelation of who god is who they are that's why brother abraham says when the bride will know her position the rapture will take place so there's something about knowing who you are and god gave he came down and gave us an open book so we can see what is written about us not what we think about us not what anybody can say about me he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she stands for what she stands for and what she can do are you hearing me what she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army and satan will be powerless before her [Music] doing exploits dwayne mentioned its military maneuvers so we are we are on a battleground this morning i hope i have some soldiers with me this morning to kill some giants in the land and when i say some soldiers that includes the sisters too i know it was only the men who were sent out on the front in the field the battlefield but i'm talking to all of the brothers and sisters so don't let us alone on the battlefield i need you you need me we all need each other now listen every demon will obey god it has to but everything obeys god and it'll obey you if you have faith oh really is that for me brother david well that's what the word of god tells me now what is the will of god there is only one way to know his will and that is that is by the word of god lamentations 3 37 says who is he that sayeth and it cometh to pass when the lord commanded it not there it is if it isn't the word you can have it so we can ask we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it is in his name [Music] there it is again jesus the name is the word the will let's just say the prophet you can't separate god and the word they are one by god's grace we've been introduced to deity deity itself jesus christ revealing jesus christ in him dwelleth oh my and everything that was in god he poured out in christ everything was in christ he poured into his church so when the spirit board spirit-filled man and fate takes the word into his heart and places upon his lips it's the same come on now how many wants to say it with me it's the same as deity speaking glory i speak jesus if you have any petition you do it in his name and if you ask it in his name the father will give it if you believe he will give it it's deity speaking every mountain has to go come on church satan cannot stand before that man or woman whoa hallelujah all power is given unto me but it's yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant with you and it can never fail come on church you want to talk about a covenant let's not stay bolted down because the great magnet is here oh all around us amen he made us a covenant an unfailing covenant an everlasting covenant if you ask anything in my name amen so it can never fail if you take god's word and you take it by faith and you speak it by faith satan cannot stand before you [Music] come on what what is your desire little bride [Music] what do you have need of little bride speak jesus come on now when the seals were open glory revealing christ revealing i'm a part of christ we're a part of christ that's where he said i'm not going to call you any more church but miss jesus christ you want to talk about authority believe me when my wife goes somewhere and she pronounces my name she has the authority now what about the bride miss jesus christ when she speaks my husband said do you think satan can stand with his army he can stand upon your field amen upon your land if you take the word of god let me remind you amen we were there before satan was so if we remind him who he is when she gets a true revelation of who she is and what she stands for satan is powerless hallelujah this is not a fairy tale it's not just something nice to hear it's a reality you speak the word and i will perform it this is my covenant and it can never fail amen amen there will be a time where he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man but now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed pride and the bridegroom anointed by what accepting what eve turned down coming back with the anointed world thank god for the word of god for the revealed word of the hour if that doesn't make those so-called believers of the message shout where the shields were broken where i can see my name in the book the thunders out of their voices now i know i can see where i come from where i'm coming if that doesn't make you shout out well i'm not gonna feel sorry for you but let me have a good time because when god is moving when god is working oh it's bubbling it's a power it's a reality it's a life hallelujah divine glory now if you count me a fanatic from today on the very same thing that i'm speaking off will be done there will be a power put into the church and now is coming where the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there hallelujah i don't need to wait until tonight come on church i don't need to wait another day if you take god's word not intellectually i hear the word of god and something him is saying amen to that word i will confess i will speak jesus and i'm getting ready for the miracle i'm rejoicing for the miracles i'm worshiping for the miracle we many many many man joshua was silent six ages [Music] but the sevens and the voice of the seven messenger come on when he begin to sound there's worshipping they're shouting and the walls have to crumble down [Applause] some people think i'm pentecostal well that's why i gave you the quote what brother branham says i was on the way in the plane coming over i don't know why i'm insurance but lord knows brother brandon was talking about this lady this catholic lady saying oh brother brown how can you be identified with this noisy bunch of groups so don't be quiet on me now this noisy bunch this noisy group i'm sure i mean they can't go to heaven oh brother brown says you know if the blessed mary had to go up there to receive the holy ghost and act like a drunk woman how much more you've got to have it so there's nothing wrong amen being stimulated by this wine wine of stimulation being drunk of this wine they were staggering what have you been drinking david i've been at mount baker camp i've been hearing god telling me i've been speaking jesus came and i've been speaking jesus to my trouble to my problem to my mountain and i'm having the victory now brother david you didn't see it oh yes i'm i'm thanking god even before my eyes can see it because i know my god never fails he cannot fail he can never fail he can never fail he's still in speaking distance so it's up to us to speak to the rock in the old testament and exodus we can see the old badger skin it hit the glory of god from the people because it was skin that held it the glory of god was behind the skin but now the glory of god is behind what skin your skin come on really yes let's continue it is the invisible union the same jesus send jesus in bride for now maybe you think that you're a nobody listen the devil's trying to hide you

salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven among men whereby we must be saved an african brother one time he gave me i loved the story he says you know when a lion teaches the

he does it all for us now he says we are his victory he wants us to rejoice he wants us to have a victory dance not just the dead david dance david dance all right but it wasn't just for david don't get quiet he wants us to rejoice over the victory that he got right but we are proof of his victory you are still here it is proof that what we are victorious over brother david my family or my situation oh my this or my dad i'm not listening to that i'm listening to what the word of god tells me we are proof of his victory amen amen he himself is working through us manifesting himself he is the same yesterday today and forever john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that i will do that the father may be glorified in the son and if ye shall ask anything amen i would like to hear you young people and all the people and all the people say that by faith if you ask anything anything in my name i will do it philippians 2 verse 9 says wherefore god also had highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee shall battle the things in heaven the things in earth the things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father i speak jesus few more moments almost done there's something about the name of jesus when mary when she received the word luke 1 38 says and mary said behold excuse me behold the handmaid of the lord now excuse my english but i'm taking it like this behold i am handmade by the lord i am his workmanship his bride is his workmanship i am handmade by the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed when mary goes to her friend elizabeth to tell her what happened listen as soon as she said jesus maybe the musicians can come as soon as she said jesus the power of the holy ghost fell hallelujah the moment she pronounced jesus the power of the holy ghost fell and the little dead baby in the mother's womb began to leap for joy [Music] you want to tell me i can't leave for joy i can't rejoice when i speak jesus if the name of jesus first spoke by a human lips will bring life to a dead baby what it ought to do to christians who are born again young people are you hearing me this morning when you pronounce the name of jesus something is happening why don't we stand rod brown says in perseverance and just as soon as the human name of god jesus oh i love how he says amen the human name of god jesus was spoke by mortal lip out of human being now i'm making it personal how many human beings do we have here how am i we still have mortal lips but that's what he shows us here as an example amen was spoke by mortal lips out of human being a dead baby came to life in the womb of a woman and receive the holy ghost what will it do to the born-again church of god there is power in the name of jesus when i was getting ready for camp why brother david do you take this this message because the lord told me a few weeks down for you pray about it seeking the will of the lord lord what do we need what do you want to tell your people and i i had to travel and you know i remember brother wayne was telling the giving the testimony one time he was sitting in a plane and i think he was listening to a message and and all of a sudden the spirit came down i am barabbas so god works in mysterious ways sometimes but we have to be sensitive enough to hear his voice we sang it before i love his voice do we really love his voice are we sensitive enough to hear his voice this morning so that we apply it that we live by the word of god so i was sitting i was traveling and i was sitting in the lounge i was praying i was too early i thought you know the the security was going to take long and anyway i was sitting there and listening to some music said lord what do you want me to preach and here comes the song i speak jesus and believe me saints such an anointing came down i was weeping i was worshiping i was paralyzed on my chair i didn't care who was sitting on my left or my right maybe they called me crazy but i don't care he was there i knew god wanted to tell us there is power in the name of jesus the name above all names but if you can put it on your lips believe and speak the word it's deity speaking through your lips you know in possibilities they melt like a snowball on a red hot stove says the prophet when fate steps in maybe if sister ava charity and the group if you if you can come forward we're at camp we will do things a little different but i'm winding up here so stay stay focused on the word mark 16 tells us and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name whose name in my name it's not because they're coming forward we keep on preaching we keep on saying amen to the word in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take they shall take up serpents and they dre and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover in my name speak jesus in the name of jesus we have the victory let me wind up with a few quotes in jesus name we have listen that came in the middle of the night in jesus name we have you name it you name it we have you name it every redemptive blessing that he gave me so brothers and sisters you start naming it in jesus name and don't tell me tell you goliath how little how much of a bluff he is in jesus name you know a little example and then i'll wind up with one more quote david was a little boy david in the bible was a little boy but he had to meet his goliath so it doesn't matter how tall how big how strong david was little but he served a big god and here he comes here were some stones that were predestinated for before the foundation of the world that god shaped perfectly hmm i love predestination god was through the ages preparing this atomic power because a goliath was coming before david brett abraham says he took up five stones which is grace f-a-i-t-h in g-e-s-u-s and he starred it goliath might hit his boasts and david says here you come with all your armor a big spear big sword here you come in this final age with all these gadgets with all these this divertism and all these things but boost satan i'm coming i hope i have some irons here you know that can say i'm coming to face you goliath in the name of jesus i don't need a big armor they tried it on him no i cannot trust that but there's one thing i'm coming with that's with the name of jesus and he prophesied and let us prophesy again church he prophesied he said and this day i'm gonna cut your head so why don't you confess it this morning this day i'm gonna cut your head and i'm gonna feed you to the fowls of the air i speak jesus final quotes i don't know if you want to start playing brother ryan anything that satan has put upon you in the way of sickness or whatever it is every born-again person has an abstract warrant has a warrant from god and the holy spirit is here to put any devil out no matter if it's cancer tumor cataract whatever it is the holy spirit will put him out if you serve notice are you hearing me church
