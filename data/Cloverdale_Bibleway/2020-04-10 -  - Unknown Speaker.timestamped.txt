[1:17] you
[1:17] [Music]
[1:20] there was a time of my life I was
[1:22] separated from everything including the
[1:26] young lady that I thought I might marry
[1:28] I didn't know but I was God it was about
[1:33] eight months long and during that eight
[1:37] months I had a very very unusual walk
[1:42] with God I guess I would say very
[1:46] unusual I had a rule and I worked in
[1:52] store right below and the Hudson's Bay
[1:56] had bought out my father-in-law he
[2:01] became my father-in-law but he was just
[2:03] the owner and I I was working in the I
[2:11] was manager the produce department
[2:16] and when noontime came I would go up to
[2:21] my room
[2:22] and give the first half hour of my lunch
[2:25] time in prayer and it was just something
[2:30] very special it isn't something that I
[2:32] and advise others or admonish them it
[2:35] was just something that I just did I had
[2:38] longed for it I craved for it I even you
[2:41] know would pinch him the moment so I
[2:44] could be longer there and I would slide
[2:48] out the other chair for the Lord Jesus
[2:51] to sit on and be there and when when the
[2:56] work was over I would sometimes go out
[2:58] and walk and woods or walking there
[3:01] around the creek and just look at the
[3:03] flowers or something and just be
[3:06] overwhelmed at the beauty of it and weep
[3:09] and he said so that was the kind of
[3:11] experience we had and then God was
[3:15] moving in such a way that denominations
[3:18] was nothing it was the people you know
[3:22] if there was a hunger and a desire for
[3:24] God and we under we heard that there was
[3:28] a meeting or I
[3:29] heard that there was a meeting taking
[3:30] place in northern Alberta and there was
[3:35] about 300 350 miles from Laurel we were
[3:39] and I waited till when work was over on
[3:44] Friday and then I took off on my
[3:47] motorcycle that was the only trouble
[3:49] only transportation I had and it was
[3:54] cold and I was suffering from
[3:58] hypothermia I didn't know what what I
[4:01] was and I went to tell about two o'clock
[4:08] in the morning and then I would see if
[4:13] our light flicker or you know way in the
[4:16] distance and I thought oh my goodness
[4:18] I've always was so bashful to do that
[4:22] and then there was one right beside the
[4:24] road a little log house and so I pulled
[4:26] in there real quick it was in the middle
[4:29] of night and the light was on and I
[4:33] leaned my bike up against the log house
[4:35] and tapped on the door and I just heard
[4:39] some voice inside come on him so I
[4:42] opened the door and there was a guy with
[4:44] his feet up on a table reading a book
[4:46] and so I said well I I said I'm just
[4:50] pulling up and I was very cold North
[4:52] almost freezing to death and all he said
[4:55] yeah I said I thought maybe I could bunk
[4:57] here for the night yeah he said you can
[5:01] have a room here and he was a bachelor
[5:03] made a big breakfast in the morning and
[5:06] and I set off the next day and it had
[5:08] snowed that night and so in the
[5:13] afternoon and the Sun was coming out and
[5:15] people were splashing you know spraying
[5:17] me with wet snow and water and so on but
[5:23] I did that to get to a meeting
[5:28] and it was in that waiting that no God
[5:31] confirmed that God had given me the
[5:38] young woman who was my wife to be my
[5:40] wife and I was feeling a call I guess
[5:47] and I can't identify what the call was I
[5:52] think it evolved into you know when I
[5:58] began to speak to my wife and we were
[6:05] actually riding in a car then I'll go
[6:08] back and I said well I wanted her to
[6:11] know I would not be able to give her the
[6:14] kind of life that she knew and that
[6:17] she's experienced and that she's had
[6:20] with her father being a businessman and
[6:23] being in business and so on
[6:24] I said I can't give you that kind of
[6:27] life I said I've been called a preach
[6:29] and that's probably the first time I
[6:32] said that to her I've been called a
[6:34] bridge so I think that now in retrospect
[6:38] I was I was feeling that Paul III I
[6:43] didn't you know we didn't have the
[6:45] example of someone behind the pulpit and
[6:48] someone preaching but it was just a deep
[6:53] hunger for greater things of God and the
[6:59] life that God had for you know what
[7:01] there was you know available and so I
[7:09] was actually frustrated on the bed and I
[7:13] was in great sobs you know just exposing
[7:18] my soul to God and I didn't know what to
[7:23] do I remember taking off my watch and I
[7:26] put it on the bed and I took my billfold
[7:29] out and I put those on the bed and I
[7:32] just surrendered it to God I said my
[7:35] time and what
[7:38] I put in my hands was going to be his
[7:45] and I can't I can't describe any special
[7:53] extended thing from that but I think God
[7:58] sees that and then he just sets your
[8:00] life in a certain course and allows
[8:02] certain things to happen and and he
[8:06] knows that blessings are not going to
[8:10] upset you
[8:11] or they're not going to drive you in a
[8:14] wrong direction you you handle that you
[8:19] and then you you become a trustworthy
[8:25] steward of the things of the kingdom of
[8:29] God God has to have people that can
[8:32] handle funds can handle business the
[8:37] gospel itself is not it's not something
[8:40] that is conducted on you know God can
[8:47] take little buddy and he can take lunch
[8:50] so yeah I just it was something I
[8:54] experienced that was before we were
[8:56] married
[8:59] [Music]
[9:09] [Applause]
[9:15] [Music]
[9:25] you
