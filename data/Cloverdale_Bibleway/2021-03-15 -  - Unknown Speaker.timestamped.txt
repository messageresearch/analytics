[23:43] perfect way tonight
[23:44] you can get your your bibles we're going
[23:47] to turn to luke 14.
[23:49] very familiar passage of scripture
[23:57] i told my son it's gotten very very very
[24:00] old
[24:01] coming into the sanctuary empty yeah
[24:04] it's just
[24:05] so it was old a long time ago
[24:08] it was a long time ago but we will press
[24:11] on
[24:12] no matter what the battle no matter what
[24:13] the trial no matter what it is
[24:15] we've pledged allegiance and covet ain't
[24:18] going to waver nobody's allegiance to
[24:20] the lamb of god god bless you brother
[24:21] john good to see you amen
[24:23] all right we're going to read luke 14.
[24:27] we're going to start it
[24:31] verse 16
[24:35] then said he unto him a certain man
[24:38] made a great supper and bade
[24:42] many and sent his servant at the supper
[24:45] time to say to them that were bitten
[24:47] come for all things are now ready
[24:52] verse 18 and they all with one consent
[24:57] began to make excuse
[25:01] they began to make excuses i'm just
[25:03] going to stop there we'll continue to
[25:04] reading
[25:05] but we'll just pray then we'll let you
[25:06] have your seats
[25:09] heavenly father lord lord one more time
[25:13] we've prayed much
[25:14] these last few days not knowing lord
[25:17] what you have in mind what is in store
[25:19] but only you alone do and so lord we as
[25:22] your people
[25:23] lord as your servants standing here lord
[25:25] tonight just want to give you our all
[25:26] and
[25:27] yield our every aspect of our being to
[25:30] you lord the people
[25:31] coming lord desiring lord a word from
[25:34] the great shepherd tonight
[25:36] so lord would you open your word to us
[25:39] lords
[25:40] parable as we would say that you spoke
[25:42] many years ago but just as real today
[25:45] as it was the moment you spoke those
[25:47] words lord
[25:48] somewhere in israel and so lord tonight
[25:51] would you speak to us
[25:53] and would you lord just bring us just a
[25:55] little bit closer to you lord
[25:57] find maybe that little lost lamb that's
[25:59] lord needing you tonight we pray
[26:01] in jesus christ's name amen amen you may
[26:05] be seated
[26:07] amen all right so this is a like i said
[26:09] a parable
[26:12] that we've known very well and and here
[26:15] the
[26:16] the great supper the king matthew 22
[26:19] also talks speaks
[26:20] jesus gives this account matthew 22 and
[26:23] he speaks of a great supper
[26:25] and a great invitation that goes out and
[26:27] bidding many to come
[26:29] and he says all things are ready but
[26:31] abraham says now god made everything
[26:33] ready
[26:33] you don't have to wait for a thing he
[26:35] said it's all fixed
[26:37] heaven's already prepared he said your
[26:39] healing's ready
[26:40] the jubilee is ready tonight he says
[26:42] hallelujah god's great healing campaign
[26:44] it's ready for you tonight he said
[26:46] christ
[26:46] has been slain his blood has been shed
[26:49] he said all
[26:50] things are ready right now hey man he
[26:53] said come
[26:54] come he's bidding he's bidding he said
[26:55] come and they're a bit and i was
[26:57] better brown talks about it he talks
[26:58] about eisenhower you know if eisenhower
[27:01] had sent out an invitation and i was
[27:03] thinking well you know there's probably
[27:05] different ones today that we would
[27:07] be compelled here we have the king of
[27:09] all kings
[27:10] compelling here a parable and it's i how
[27:13] ironic it is is that jesus christ
[27:15] himself was giving this parable
[27:16] and saying the great invitation went out
[27:19] and he's standing there
[27:20] the king and an invitation is going out
[27:23] as he was there on
[27:24] on on earth at that very moment as these
[27:26] words are being spoken he's saying come
[27:28] all
[27:29] come for all things already and i
[27:30] thought you know how would we respond
[27:33] i wonder how they all responded there
[27:34] they probably listened to his words and
[27:36] maybe some didn't really understand what
[27:38] what the parable meant and uh and it
[27:40] maybe went over their heads and
[27:42] and and i wonder what hap what's
[27:43] happening now even as
[27:45] as the call has gone out through the
[27:48] ages
[27:48] come come all things are ready
[27:52] jesus christ bidding come unto me all ye
[27:55] that are weary
[27:56] and are heavy laden i'll give you rest
[27:57] come and he's calling i
[27:59] i wonder how many have just ignored
[28:03] the invitation and and and passed it
[28:06] aside
[28:07] and how they how they would you know
[28:09] probably not even hitting their radar
[28:11] i wonder if if someone i just i looked
[28:14] up he said who who are the celebrities
[28:16] now or the you know the big people today
[28:18] if there was an invitation that went out
[28:19] you know someone
[28:20] blasted on and it hit your instagram uh
[28:23] account or your twitter account or your
[28:25] facebook account
[28:27] and you know and some some some who
[28:29] knows who i
[28:30] i wrote a handful of names down that i'm
[28:32] sure even right at the top of the list
[28:34] is still
[28:34] justin bieber still top of the list
[28:36] looks like uh
[28:37] i'm sorry but it looks like a devil in
[28:39] flesh with tattoos everywhere and
[28:40] everything else and
[28:41] 160 plus million people following him on
[28:44] one of his
[28:44] social media accounts but if he sent an
[28:46] invitation said come
[28:47] to my home for a feast i wonder what the
[28:51] response
[28:52] would be it would be just like
[28:53] instantaneous every seat
[28:55] was be filled done gone no more room at
[28:57] the inn because
[28:58] it would be filled and i went through
[29:00] just different people billy ellis
[29:03] she sings a song when she sings
[29:07] good girls go to hell that's the title
[29:10] of one of her songs good girls go to
[29:12] hell
[29:14] if any one of our children or anybody
[29:17] would even know that person or even have
[29:19] the two seconds time to even go beyond
[29:21] what i looked at
[29:22] you need an encounter with god
[29:26] someone is saying good girls go to hell
[29:27] saying that's satan himself
[29:30] singing through the flesh someone's that
[29:32] has given themselves over
[29:34] to a spirit a demon spirit singing songs
[29:37] anointed from the pits of hell
[29:39] good girls go to hell and
[29:42] that's exactly right
[29:48] olivia rodriguez ariana grande duane
[29:51] the rock johnson gave an invitation
[29:54] come to my house tonight i got a party
[29:57] that's going on
[29:58] oh you'd bet people would be there
[30:01] without a bat of an eye
[30:03] and as fast as they could but here the
[30:06] king of kings
[30:08] has sent an imitation out
[30:11] and it's like who who
[30:14] how many people don't even know who
[30:16] jesus christ is
[30:18] don't even know and here we drop into
[30:20] the next part of the scripture
[30:23] and they all with one consent began
[30:26] to make excuse my
[30:30] commandment make excuse now excuse is to
[30:33] explain
[30:34] a fault or an offense in the hope
[30:38] of being forgiven or to try and justify
[30:41] something and a lot of times then when
[30:42] we
[30:42] make an excuse we generally blame goes
[30:45] into that
[30:46] blame is par part of excuses many times
[30:48] they're really connected together
[30:50] because an excuse is blame happening and
[30:53] so
[30:54] people you know they have to declare um
[30:56] or feel they need to say someone or
[30:58] something
[30:59] is responsible for the fault or the
[31:01] wrong so in that justification or in
[31:03] that excuse
[31:04] they they start passing blame and
[31:06] assigning responsibility
[31:08] for something that happened maybe an
[31:10] unfortunate situation or some phenomena
[31:12] or something
[31:13] and so the the blame is very part of a
[31:15] part of
[31:16] an excuse and i'll use those maybe
[31:18] tonight a little bit
[31:19] interchangeably or together and just you
[31:22] know pray the lord just
[31:23] grant you understanding now blame it's
[31:25] an excellent excellent defense
[31:27] mechanism you know as we use it in
[31:29] excuses
[31:30] because it helps preserve your sense of
[31:32] of self-esteem
[31:34] because you're avoiding actually
[31:36] awareness of maybe
[31:38] a flaw of your own or maybe one of your
[31:40] own failings
[31:41] and so that's what blame does it that's
[31:43] why instantly something goes wrong and
[31:45] whoa but it's that
[31:46] that's the problem right there because
[31:48] it's a defense mechanism
[31:51] and it's all just easier straight up
[31:52] easier to blame someone else and accept
[31:54] the responsibility
[31:55] that's just human nature there and so
[31:58] it's you know there's more effort
[31:59] involved
[32:00] in accepting you know part of it or that
[32:02] you're actually at fault than just
[32:04] you know uh putting the blame somewhere
[32:07] else so
[32:07] so more efforts involved in accepting
[32:09] the fact that you're actually at fault
[32:10] and so instead of that you just blame
[32:12] someone else for it and so
[32:13] that's you know where blame and what
[32:16] blame really
[32:17] is and so a lot of ways again to
[32:19] separate
[32:20] your responsibility from something so
[32:22] you make an excuse
[32:23] and why you don't want to do something
[32:25] and it's a knee-jerk reaction for humans
[32:27] in in many ways you know we just don't
[32:29] want to do that we could be
[32:31] you know walking down a sidewalk we
[32:32] might slip or trip or maybe we're using
[32:34] our phone
[32:35] and we're walking down the road and
[32:36] you're losing the phone and uh any and
[32:38] you know what you're just you're so
[32:39] glued in that you walk into the car
[32:41] and it's like who parked the car there
[32:43] it's like well
[32:45] you're the problem you got your nose in
[32:46] your phone and you have no clue where
[32:48] you're going so it you know but instant
[32:50] it's just human nature just instantly
[32:52] wants to
[32:52] blame or make an excuse well that's the
[32:55] problem it wasn't me
[32:56] right you know how many people have been
[32:58] late for work
[33:00] [Laughter]
[33:02] you don't have to raise your hand but i
[33:04] can tell you generally the response is
[33:06] not
[33:07] you know it's totally my fault i slept
[33:09] in too late generally that's not the
[33:11] response it's
[33:11] something else you know breakfast
[33:12] spoiled it burned i had to clean this up
[33:14] something didn't have my clothes
[33:15] wash my spouse didn't do it for me they
[33:16] didn't iron my shirt it's something it's
[33:18] somebody else's problem
[33:19] generally why you're late for work and
[33:22] uh
[33:22] but nobody just wants to admit you know
[33:24] what i slept in got into bed too late
[33:25] and didn't get up to bed or get out of
[33:27] bed earlier
[33:28] right so we're just we make these
[33:29] excuses children
[33:32] if we do a bad test i can tell you the
[33:34] first thing you don't say is you know
[33:36] what
[33:36] i didn't even study at all it's the test
[33:38] was too hard the teacher's too strong
[33:39] it's a grade level above me
[33:41] it really is just not my fault that's
[33:42] probably where it usually goes it's
[33:44] instant
[33:45] it's just like immediate for a human to
[33:47] just throw the excuse out
[33:49] and you know even here we're living in
[33:51] covet right now
[33:53] and guess what they want to so find
[33:54] covert patient zero because they just
[33:56] want to point
[33:58] he's the problem he he caused this whole
[34:00] world the issue we got to find
[34:02] patient zero you know because no one
[34:04] wants to to
[34:06] barely any burden or you know
[34:09] responsibility for maybe that they they
[34:12] spread something or whatever you know
[34:13] nobody's
[34:14] you know i don't really have a i'm not
[34:15] pointing victims but that's the world is
[34:17] consumed to try to find that you know
[34:19] big
[34:21] groups of people trying to search out
[34:23] patient zero
[34:24] you know and so this this is because we
[34:26] want to cast blame or make excuse
[34:29] for you know for a problem and it eases
[34:32] somehow you know a lot of times in an
[34:33] excuse
[34:34] it actually it eases our conscience
[34:37] right it eases our conscience because
[34:39] you know it helps us dismiss or set
[34:42] aside the fact that we knew we had some
[34:44] responsibility
[34:45] and so we make an excuse we play some
[34:48] blame or
[34:49] over here and it just yeah yeah see
[34:51] that's the problem
[34:52] you know and and it kind of eases it and
[34:54] it and it pushes that down
[34:56] when really though deep down we know i'm
[34:58] actually i don't want to own up for
[34:59] maybe something i'm responsible for
[35:02] one person he said he said excuses are
[35:05] short-term
[35:05] vehicles of happiness they bring with
[35:08] them immediate satisfaction
[35:10] at the expense of something greater down
[35:12] the line
[35:13] and so there is a quote on an excuse
[35:16] short-term
[35:17] short-term vehicle of happiness but you
[35:19] know it can delay something that's
[35:20] coming down the pipe
[35:21] that that you really don't want to deal
[35:23] with and so here
[35:25] in ma in luke 14 we had some excuses
[35:29] being made
[35:30] and they all with one consent began to
[35:32] make excuse
[35:34] and i always wonder what you know why
[35:36] were they making excuse i just pondered
[35:38] that a little bit i wondered
[35:39] you know what is it they didn't they
[35:41] obviously did not even want to come
[35:45] they all had an excuse immediately of
[35:48] why why i don't want to be there
[35:50] like you know an excuse is usually is is
[35:53] there because you know a lot of people
[35:54] hey do you want to come here now you
[35:55] know what
[35:56] i got to i'm just tied up you know they
[35:59] don't
[35:59] generally don't want to you're not
[36:01] priority
[36:02] you know and and i'm circumstantial i'm
[36:04] generalizing but and a lot of times an
[36:06] excuse is made just
[36:07] because maybe it is not really any
[36:09] really desire to be there anyway and so
[36:10] they make this
[36:11] these excuses of the king
[36:16] and he says well the first one says i've
[36:18] got i've got some cows
[36:20] i've got some cows and i must prove them
[36:22] some oxen
[36:23] i must prove them my i've got a lot of
[36:26] work
[36:27] i've got a whole lot of work to do i got
[36:29] a new job and i need to you know i'm
[36:31] just so i'm just so zoned in and focused
[36:33] on it
[36:34] i got a difficult schedule uh pray go to
[36:37] church
[36:38] wednesday night nah i i got i i'm really
[36:41] in the zone here
[36:42] i you know kovitz on i've got i'm
[36:44] working day and night now it's the
[36:45] weirdest schedules
[36:46] and i got to prove i've got to prove
[36:48] these ox and i've got so many different
[36:50] cares of my life
[36:52] that's what his excuse was i've got
[36:55] these oxen
[36:56] and i must prove them i have these these
[36:58] uh
[36:59] these cares that i must must tend to and
[37:01] we're talking oxen back in the day like
[37:03] prove your oxen this wasn't like it was
[37:06] a major excuse
[37:08] you had four cows or four oxes and you
[37:10] had to you know
[37:11] these are these are to be honest these
[37:13] are also some nobles i'd imagine or
[37:14] something and you know you don't got to
[37:16] serve and i can go prove your ox
[37:17] and go put a put a yolk on them it's a
[37:19] weak excuse
[37:20] is what i'm trying to point out it was a
[37:22] weak excuse
[37:24] someone says i bought some land i bought
[37:26] some land
[37:29] leave my possessions i bought a little
[37:31] bit of land i got to go seek it out i
[37:32] got to go
[37:33] look at it he and he says what is his
[37:35] excuse he says
[37:36] i have bought a piece of ground and i
[37:38] must needs go and see it
[37:39] okay well that means you bought it sight
[37:42] unseen which is a very irresponsible and
[37:44] unstewardly like thing to do is just go
[37:46] buy a piece of land you've had to have
[37:47] seen it
[37:48] already
[37:51] i've got some potential in my land
[37:54] in my life i i gotta go try and achieve
[37:57] it
[37:58] it's maybe what he's saying i i got
[37:59] something that i that i that i need to
[38:01] do i got some talent
[38:03] some passion for something i i need
[38:05] that's more important right now
[38:06] i gotta go achieve or or maybe uh you
[38:09] know see how much further i can
[38:11] i can you know do whether it's my job or
[38:13] maybe some sport or something
[38:15] i got a plan for my future i've got this
[38:17] big investment and i go see it see what
[38:19] i can do with it
[38:20] and so he gave a another one person gave
[38:24] another
[38:24] weak excuse to reject the invitation to
[38:28] reject
[38:29] the bidding i must needs to go and see
[38:33] my land and if we go back in those days
[38:36] i'm trying to just give some
[38:37] simple little parallels very quickly but
[38:40] you know
[38:42] that's what it was said and they were
[38:43] sitting on a hillside somewhere maybe
[38:45] you're on a shore somewhere
[38:46] and he's saying i gotta go see my land i
[38:48] just that would have sounded so
[38:49] ridiculous
[38:50] as an excuse and i think that's i
[38:51] believe jesus was trying to show
[38:53] this was a pretty petty petty thing that
[38:56] he was putting out in front
[38:57] now next one he said i've married
[39:03] another said i bought oxen the third
[39:05] says i have married a wife
[39:08] and therefore i cannot come you know
[39:11] this one
[39:13] some some might say well that seems to
[39:15] be maybe a little bit more of the
[39:16] of the best of the three excuses
[39:20] uh you know there's
[39:23] but i thought about that i said you know
[39:24] if that man had married somebody that
[39:26] was worth her salt she would have wanted
[39:28] to see the king
[39:30] she said the king just called the king
[39:32] just wanted us to come who we're going
[39:35] no but instead that wasn't the case
[39:38] he used her as an excuse for one and
[39:41] maybe maybe because he had no desire to
[39:42] even bring her to the
[39:44] bringer to the king's court maybe the
[39:45] court king wouldn't even approved
[39:47] maybe with some wife from some other
[39:48] kingdom maybe it was some something that
[39:50] was uh you know
[39:51] not not actually if you want to get him
[39:54] saying maybe you're marrying someone
[39:55] that's
[39:56] not in the same line maybe not believing
[39:58] what he was believing
[39:59] how can two are together less to be a
[40:01] greed and he's married maybe somebody
[40:02] that
[40:03] he should not have and here his eyes
[40:06] have been turned maybe it's friendship
[40:07] nowadays maybe your eyes of his eyes
[40:10] were off the king
[40:11] suede is focused maybe maybe this
[40:13] relationship has swayed
[40:14] his focus and so the king wasn't
[40:16] important to him anymore what the king's
[40:17] desire was not important anymore
[40:19] it was all now this area of his life
[40:22] and it was an excuse that he made
[40:26] to not heed the bidding that the king
[40:28] had made
[40:29] and i asked
[40:34] was that of any of those valid excuses
[40:37] just give me thumbs up or thumbs down
[40:39] for everybody to say are those valid
[40:40] excuses
[40:43] no exactly thank you and did the king he
[40:46] said you know what
[40:47] that's okay
[40:51] i totally get it i completely understand
[40:54] those excuses
[40:55] you know i'll let it go now in matthew
[40:58] 22 he was so
[40:59] roth he destroyed them
[41:02] he was so roth he destroyed them and so
[41:05] i want you
[41:06] to just as we go through this portion of
[41:09] the evening
[41:09] service tonight i want you to lay your
[41:12] excuses down maybe that has been holding
[41:14] you back from accepting
[41:16] the invitation that jesus christ has
[41:18] sent and given out and ushered out
[41:20] through the through the word and through
[41:21] the message i want you to lay it down i
[41:23] don't care what it is i want you to
[41:24] through the course of the night
[41:25] if something if you've if you've been
[41:27] there something's been there and i want
[41:28] you to
[41:29] put it i want to imagine a bit of a
[41:30] scale and i want you to put that on a
[41:32] scale
[41:33] and when you say where is that where is
[41:35] my excuse
[41:37] level up where is that and i want you
[41:39] just to do that i want you
[41:40] i want you to push back all this that
[41:43] what satan is going to try and put in
[41:45] your mind
[41:45] and try and oh no it's because of this
[41:48] oh no
[41:49] but that blame this is why you have to
[41:52] do that no i want you to push all that
[41:53] side and try and go back to
[41:54] what you're actually responsible for and
[41:56] the king has said
[41:58] come come i'm inviting you
[42:02] and what is holding you back from that
[42:06] you know these were situations that
[42:09] in this in the parable that you know
[42:11] they have
[42:12] they had were a part of but you know
[42:16] there's many things
[42:17] i know that many people you're in
[42:19] certain life situations
[42:21] and maybe your your family life
[42:24] or some sort of uh relationship
[42:28] or something that you've grown up and
[42:30] it's actually not even your fault
[42:32] that you're in a certain circumstance
[42:34] you actually have justification it's you
[42:36] know
[42:36] justifiable blame it's like well because
[42:38] of this this is my circumstances that
[42:40] i'm in
[42:41] and i had nothing to do with this i
[42:42] didn't even make make the decision or
[42:44] make the choice to be here
[42:46] and you know maybe some hurt or maybe
[42:49] some issue and
[42:50] i was thinking a few services ago we
[42:51] speak spoke on wounds
[42:54] and and the wounds that have wounded you
[42:55] we spoke on that
[42:57] but in my mind and i almost i was just
[42:59] thinking yeah
[43:01] jesus knows you're wounded and you can
[43:02] go back to that service
[43:05] but the wounds still are no excuse
[43:10] the wounds are still no excuse for you
[43:12] to falter
[43:14] for you to step back for you to to
[43:17] wane in your faith for you to backslide
[43:20] and get cool
[43:21] nothing nothing that they that any of
[43:23] these
[43:24] these people in this parable gave in as
[43:26] excuse nothing that you've gone through
[43:28] in life
[43:28] no circumstance no no situation somebody
[43:31] hurt me
[43:32] somebody wounded me i'm in a family
[43:34] situation i can
[43:35] barely even get to church i can't even
[43:37] squeak no nothing
[43:39] is not one thing on this planet that is
[43:42] justification
[43:43] to say and so therefore i actually can't
[43:46] i i can't uh i can't live for christ
[43:49] there's not one thing
[43:50] not one situation not one broken heart
[43:54] not nothing that is that's going to be
[43:56] set there and god's gonna be like
[43:57] you know because i'll let that go
[43:58] nothing nothing
[44:00] will justify an excuse to backslide
[44:03] nothing will justify
[44:04] you for your cooling off nothing i don't
[44:07] care covet i don't care nothing well i
[44:08] can't go to church i can't
[44:10] i can barely um get get time work
[44:12] schedule is so weird uh we can't come
[44:14] and sit
[44:14] in the pews i don't see my friends i
[44:17] don't have my my social network at
[44:18] church
[44:19] i don't care that is not an excuse for
[44:21] you to cool off
[44:22] in your walk with god nothing i want i
[44:24] will repeat it
[44:25] over and over maybe through the service
[44:27] there's not one thing in this day and
[44:28] age
[44:29] that god is going to be like yup it's
[44:31] okay
[44:32] it's okay that you backslid it's okay
[44:34] that you stepped away
[44:36] and you and you cool down in your walk
[44:38] with me it's just it's okay
[44:40] never will that happen never
[44:46] and so do not use some situation like to
[44:49] prop up
[44:50] in your mind or put out there and allow
[44:52] the devil to be like well because of
[44:54] this
[44:54] it's okay and you and you kind of yeah
[44:57] your conscience is sued yeah i know i i
[44:59] cuz i do that or because of that
[45:00] situation no nothing
[45:03] nothing will be there and hold candle
[45:06] at the end of time
[45:10] woman at the well she had every excuse
[45:12] in the book i would think
[45:13] to say why she's had a rough time we've
[45:15] spoken her before
[45:16] you've heard her spoke on many times she
[45:18] had a rough life we spoke about it
[45:20] she probably had enough enough in her in
[45:23] her in her life to say
[45:25] look at all this surely this gives me a
[45:28] you know a pass
[45:29] there was no pass she had a burning
[45:31] desire
[45:32] there when grace came her way and he
[45:34] said if you have this water
[45:37] that i give you oh that sparked
[45:39] something in her
[45:40] and that's that's that's the seed inside
[45:43] that is like that's what i'm looking for
[45:45] regardless of all the situations around
[45:47] me that's what i need
[45:48] she was she was responding to the call
[45:51] immediately regardless of her situations
[45:54] regardless
[45:55] regardless of her hurts and her pains
[45:57] rahab brother brandon i think talks
[45:59] about her
[45:59] as well and her rough situations of
[46:01] where she
[46:02] went out and and why she maybe had to be
[46:04] in the streets etc
[46:05] excuses but when two messengers came by
[46:08] her way
[46:10] all her excuses didn't matter she says
[46:12] give me a token
[46:14] and if you on the internet sister chair
[46:16] you did such a phenomenal job
[46:18] as rahab i need a true token give it to
[46:20] me that's all she cared about
[46:22] not well you know i have a rough life
[46:24] and i know i
[46:25] if i put out there people are going to
[46:26] persecute me and i don't really put no
[46:28] no there's not no excuse or anything
[46:30] she says give me a true token and that
[46:33] responded to the messengers of her day
[46:35] amen
[46:36] you know the hebrew boys they were they
[46:38] were you know put
[46:41] in a situation foreign land captured
[46:43] slaves
[46:46] when in rome do as a romans right let's
[46:49] uh eat like the babylonians and we know
[46:51] we just got to fit in here a little bit
[46:52] went and laid to see it kind of got to
[46:54] do it like the latest scenes you know
[46:55] fit in and you know do no that was not
[46:58] their focus
[46:59] they didn't care about the surroundings
[47:00] they didn't care about what what their
[47:02] the circumstances around them were but
[47:04] when it came time to stand
[47:06] and when the pressure got hot and when
[47:08] covid came and it was said you got to do
[47:10] this and you've got to do that
[47:11] oh oh well well you must succumb to that
[47:15] bow that is not what they did
[47:19] they did not bow to the issues of their
[47:21] time they said my
[47:22] walk is just as strong now as it was
[47:25] when i was in israel
[47:26] my stand and my fervency for jesus my
[47:29] stand for jehovah has not faltered
[47:31] even though i got nobody around me but
[47:32] my two little brothers and when the fire
[47:34] got hot
[47:35] they didn't know the fire was going to
[47:36] come seven times hotter didn't really
[47:38] matter
[47:39] they were resolved well you know what
[47:41] should we should we
[47:42] it's just maybe too much maybe we should
[47:44] just
[47:46] let her cool down a little bit and then
[47:48] we can you know
[47:50] deal with it afterwards no all the way
[47:52] they pledged allegiance
[47:54] all the way didn't matter what it
[47:56] whether it was easy times
[47:57] medium times or really difficult times
[47:59] or you're burning to death time seven
[48:01] times harder
[48:02] it was all the way amen
[48:05] who's here all the way said i don't
[48:07] really care what's going on i don't care
[48:08] what's happening around me
[48:10] i'm going to be like shadrach i'm going
[48:11] to be like meshach i'm going to be like
[48:12] a bendigo and i'm going
[48:14] all the way seven times hotter because
[48:16] when it got really hot
[48:18] that's when the son of god the fourth
[48:21] man
[48:21] that we haven't been able to sing that
[48:22] song for a long time fourth man in the
[48:24] fire
[48:25] that's when he came on the scene is when
[48:27] they said i obey the word of god
[48:29] i'm standing like like a rock on my on
[48:32] my conviction
[48:33] and then god honored him and said i'm
[48:35] beside you
[48:36] in these hot times
[48:44] you know i said well
[48:48] you know my family is it's a difficult
[48:50] time
[48:52] you know it's a little bit cool you know
[48:55] mom and dad doing this and that and
[48:56] i know where my brothers and sisters are
[48:58] whichever maybe you got some family
[48:59] situation i don't know
[49:01] but i was thinking about gideon because
[49:04] i've just gone through i have a thompson
[49:05] chain bible
[49:06] you know and so when you look at a verse
[49:08] it changes you all the way through
[49:09] so when you're looking at excuses it
[49:12] weaves you all the way through
[49:13] i get all excuses right through the
[49:15] bible where did where did that
[49:16] where did that apply where did it apply
[49:18] so we just weave the scriptures to them
[49:20] boom
[49:20] hairlines gideon hairline's gideon
[49:24] if you want to turn we'll follow i'm
[49:25] going to be in judges 6 for a little bit
[49:38] all right gideon you know
[49:43] children of israel did evil on the side
[49:44] of the lord
[49:46] midian was there so was israel had sown
[49:49] and the medianites came up and the
[49:50] malachites and the children of the east
[49:53] and they encamped against them and
[49:54] destroyed the increase of the earth
[49:56] tilde coming to gaza left no sustenance
[49:59] neither sheep nor oxen or ass
[50:01] for they came up with their cattle and
[50:02] their tents and they came
[50:04] as grasshoppers just to give you an
[50:06] image there as grasshoppers
[50:08] they came which means they just came in
[50:09] and just just sucked the land
[50:12] dry pretty much of all of its sustenance
[50:14] and just just
[50:15] nothing left for the for the little
[50:17] little guys you know these grasshoppers
[50:18] come in and they take over
[50:20] and this is the scripture saying that
[50:21] it's grasshopper it's like a plague for
[50:23] the multitude for both they and their
[50:24] camels were without number
[50:26] and they entered into the land to
[50:28] destroy it
[50:29] so here they are coming in just like
[50:32] satan does
[50:33] trying to come in they they hadn't done
[50:36] israel hadn't done right on the side of
[50:37] the lord
[50:38] enemy comes starts coming in and he
[50:40] ain't gonna stop for nothing
[50:42] and so he's coming in now and suck and
[50:43] dry the substance of the land
[50:45] just like satan will try and come in and
[50:46] give you a you give him a little crack
[50:48] he's gonna blast the door down and he's
[50:50] gonna take a mile and he's gonna start
[50:52] sucking your spiritual life dry like a
[50:54] horde of grasshoppers okay that's what
[50:56] he's going to do why because their
[50:57] hearts turned away
[50:59] and so then satan finds a way in
[51:01] entering
[51:02] and israel wasn't greatly impoverished
[51:04] because the minionites
[51:06] and are cried unto the lord so they got
[51:08] to a point
[51:10] may you get to a point if your land your
[51:13] spiritual land
[51:14] is in this crisis moment may you get to
[51:16] the point where your heart turns
[51:18] back and you start crying unto the lord
[51:20] lord i need you now my life
[51:22] is in ruins i've got grasshoppers all
[51:24] around me satan is trying to suck
[51:26] me dry of my life i need you now
[51:29] that's what israel did they're crying
[51:30] out lord i need you now
[51:33] and the lord sent a prophet brother
[51:35] branham says it doesn't even have a name
[51:37] he said he sent a prophet with his word
[51:39] to them he said it didn't matter but it
[51:41] was god's messenger
[51:42] for them at that hour he sent a prophet
[51:44] on the children of israel saying
[51:46] thus saith the lord god of israel i
[51:47] brought you out of egypt trying to let
[51:49] him know
[51:49] i was i was the true god i brought you
[51:52] out of israel
[51:53] of egypt i i did these things i formed
[51:56] you i brought you forth out of bondage i
[51:57] delivered you from the egyptians out of
[51:59] the hand that oppressed you
[52:00] i drave them out from before you i was
[52:02] the one who parted the red sea
[52:04] i was the one who brought jericho's
[52:06] walls down he's trying to show them
[52:08] who what are you serving i am the true
[52:10] god i did this for you
[52:12] and he's saying i am the one that can
[52:13] take care of this situation
[52:15] amen but he said and he said to them i
[52:16] am the lord your god
[52:18] fear not of the gods of the amorites in
[52:20] whose land you dwell
[52:22] but ye have not obeyed my voice
[52:26] so god's saying this is what i've done
[52:28] for you
[52:29] but he turned away from me and here
[52:32] gideon is an angel of the lord appeared
[52:36] unto him
[52:38] and he said the lord is with thee
[52:41] thou mighty man a valor
[52:46] david you got that slide for me
[52:50] almighty man of valor he was
[52:55] no screen okay
[52:58] mighty man of valor where was gideon
[53:02] gideon this are examples of a wine press
[53:06] okay on your left side
[53:10] if you're looking at this screen the
[53:12] other side
[53:13] this big open area is a threshing floor
[53:17] okay so gideon the mighty
[53:20] man of valor that the lord
[53:24] has just told him who he is is in a
[53:27] little hole
[53:27] somewhere these are just examples of a
[53:30] wine press
[53:31] threshing wheat now threshing wheat was
[53:34] something to be done
[53:35] wide open spaces so everybody can see
[53:37] and you're throwing the weed in the air
[53:39] and the chaff is going the air and it
[53:40] comes back down
[53:41] and it needs space it needs space
[53:44] but gideon is not this mighty man
[53:47] of valor is in a teeny little hole
[53:51] something like this trying to get
[53:53] thrashed wheat
[53:54] very very difficultly i'm sure in these
[53:57] the constraints of it
[53:59] why because he's scared he's scared of
[54:02] the midianites
[54:03] they're everywhere and if they see him
[54:05] threshing wheat they're gonna come and
[54:07] take it
[54:08] like a grasshopper so he's here in a you
[54:10] know in a wine press
[54:11] he should have been on a threshing floor
[54:13] just to give you an idea when you hear
[54:15] that and you read that in scripture all
[54:16] right
[54:18] because that's what it says and there
[54:19] came an angel of the lord unto uh
[54:21] under an oak tree was an opera that
[54:23] pertained to joash
[54:24] the abbasid and the son of gideon
[54:26] threshed wheat by the wine press
[54:28] to hide it from the midianites and so
[54:31] he's hiding
[54:32] scared i gotta do this got a lot of
[54:35] excuses why he should be
[54:36] and now he's a mighty
[54:39] man a valor god sees way
[54:43] beyond your little circumstances and he
[54:44] sees writing the heart he knew there was
[54:46] a lot more there in gideon
[54:47] than just maybe the outside
[54:49] circumstances there
[54:55] now gideon something was in his heart
[54:58] again he might have been threshing there
[54:59] he said i just gotta eat my
[55:01] get some food up for my family and he's
[55:03] trying to trying to do this but i know
[55:05] in his heart he said lord
[55:06] i know he's a real god you're the god of
[55:08] moses
[55:09] you're the god that delivered us out of
[55:11] egypt he knows that because his question
[55:13] when the lord says you mighty man of
[55:16] valor
[55:17] and the scripture says and and he said
[55:19] oh my lord
[55:20] if the lord be with us why then is this
[55:23] all be following us
[55:24] and where be all his miracles he knew
[55:26] there was a real god
[55:27] he knew there's a god that could deliver
[55:29] because he believed the word
[55:31] that was had gone before him and brother
[55:33] braham says where are these things he
[55:34] says in other words
[55:34] i'm a man maybe 50. he said and i heard
[55:36] them talk about a god that worked
[55:38] miracles and i
[55:39] went to a church i believe the priest
[55:40] and i believe the prophets i believe the
[55:42] written word and the scrolls
[55:43] and i read in the scrolls where god when
[55:45] he come along his people
[55:46] something takes place amen gideon didn't
[55:49] know
[55:50] but that man sitting there under this
[55:51] oak tree amen was the g
[55:53] was the lord that's what it says in the
[55:55] scripture and the lord
[55:57] looked upon him and he said go in this
[55:59] thy might
[56:01] and thou shalt save israel from the hand
[56:04] of the midianites have not i set thee
[56:08] thou mighty man of valor go in this thy
[56:11] might
[56:13] have not i sent thee and here's
[56:18] i'm sure i know well we know because the
[56:20] next verse i'm going to read it
[56:23] mighty man of valor he knows he's in
[56:25] this little wine press
[56:26] he's trying to hide he's he's probably
[56:30] he's trying to figure a man of valor
[56:31] mighty man because then he says
[56:33] unto him oh um wherewith shall i save
[56:37] israel behold my family is poor
[56:40] i got zero stature here i don't have any
[56:42] money to fund an army
[56:44] i got nothing i'm poor i have no
[56:46] sustenance
[56:47] other than this teeny little bit of
[56:48] wheat or whatever i'm trying to thresh
[56:50] in a little hole somewhere where i
[56:52] should be doing wine and
[56:54] he says i am the least i am the smallest
[56:57] i am nothing in my father's house but
[57:00] god has just said no you're a mighty man
[57:01] of valor
[57:02] and you're now going to save the uh save
[57:05] israel from the hand of the midianites
[57:06] here's his he's using his ex giving
[57:08] excuses right into god's face
[57:12] saying no no no you got you got it wrong
[57:14] i'm poor
[57:16] i got i'm the least i i i can't do this
[57:18] no no
[57:19] and you know the lord didn't say oops
[57:23] right wrong guy wrong area i'm gonna
[57:25] move on because somehow i made a mistake
[57:27] uh you're you're clearly not the right
[57:30] one you're hiding no that wasn't the
[57:31] case
[57:32] he knew exactly who gideon was he knew
[57:34] exactly what he placed in him
[57:35] the excuses that maybe he had in the
[57:37] front of his of his mind
[57:38] little circumstantial things but deep
[57:40] down gideon was indeed a mighty man of
[57:42] hour and i don't really care
[57:44] where you might be and you might be
[57:45] thrashing your little wheat somewhere
[57:47] barely squeaking out some spiritual
[57:49] existence in your little world but you
[57:50] are a mighty man or a mighty woman
[57:52] of valor and god sees a knock on your
[57:54] door and say no you're going to be
[57:55] delivered from the hand of the many
[57:57] nights you need to step
[57:58] up and accept my word because i'm
[57:59] telling you you are mighty
[58:01] and you will deliver i will deliver you
[58:03] by your hand out of the midianites
[58:07] god didn't say oops to him and he's not
[58:09] saying oops to you oh yeah
[58:10] you know you know you're right you're
[58:11] right here i picked the wrong one no
[58:13] you're going to conquer laodicea he said
[58:15] you're going to stand dominant in this
[58:16] age you're going to stand on my word
[58:18] you have the faith in you to defeat the
[58:20] enemy anytime anywhere any place that's
[58:22] in you and i'm telling you you are
[58:24] mighty in laodicea
[58:25] accept god at his word don't give some
[58:28] lame excuse
[58:29] that satan put it to your mind well look
[58:31] at what your situation is how do you do
[58:32] that you're
[58:33] you're low you're like you're you're way
[58:35] down there on the scale of families and
[58:37] and this and that that's what that's
[58:38] what gideon said my family's low you
[58:40] know he wasn't low in god's mind
[58:42] god came to him he didn't come to some
[58:44] other family he came to gideon
[58:46] in a little wine press in his little
[58:47] hobble somewhere fresh and wheat and
[58:49] said
[58:50] mighty man a valor you're going to go
[58:52] and conquer and you know who came behind
[58:54] him we'll skip way ahead
[58:55] just says my mind is going there because
[58:56] what it's how many boys have
[58:58] been i've been a child and said would
[59:00] they pull their sword out when they're a
[59:01] kid
[59:02] instead of the sword and the lord and of
[59:04] gideon
[59:05] who's done that me i have a man as a
[59:07] little kid because his gideon sword you
[59:09] knew he had a mighty hand
[59:11] but you remember he was in the winepress
[59:13] scared stiff at one point
[59:14] and that's the transformation that god
[59:16] can do in your life amen when you just
[59:18] believe on his word
[59:22] where begotten all those miracles gideon
[59:26] you know recognize that he was the
[59:27] miracle he was a miracle transformation
[59:30] that god was saying no no i'm taking you
[59:32] from here and you're gonna become the
[59:34] miracle
[59:35] the miracle that took place in him but
[59:37] he had to believe what the word said
[59:39] he was but abram says now they had to
[59:42] believe
[59:43] they had to believe the prophet's word
[59:44] and obey it before they could see god's
[59:46] miracles
[59:47] and today you can't go here under false
[59:49] makeup and saying wow
[59:50] jesus is not the same yesterday today
[59:52] and forever days and miracles have
[59:53] passed that doesn't really happen here
[59:55] anymore no such thing as baptism of holy
[59:57] ghost i don't see the lord dropping
[59:58] like fire and and tongues of fire it is
[1:00:01] just not true he says no you've got to
[1:00:02] obey it
[1:00:03] and when you obey god takes care of the
[1:00:05] rest
[1:00:07] that's first don't be some skeptic well
[1:00:09] no no god's saying you obey my word
[1:00:11] first
[1:00:12] and then i'll come behind it gideon had
[1:00:15] to obey
[1:00:16] god's word and step into that step into
[1:00:19] the vision that god had said you're a
[1:00:20] mighty man of valor he had to accept
[1:00:22] that
[1:00:22] and obey that and walk in that and then
[1:00:25] the manifestation of it came
[1:00:27] down the road israel had to obey
[1:00:32] jericho they had to walk around the
[1:00:33] walls god said
[1:00:35] i'll take care of it but you march they
[1:00:38] had a march
[1:00:39] they'd obey that first israel jericho
[1:00:42] didn't crumble immediately
[1:00:43] they marched day one to two to three to
[1:00:44] four to five to six and then seven times
[1:00:47] they had to do that obeying first
[1:00:51] noah had to obey it obey god
[1:00:54] a piece of wood by piece of wood and
[1:00:57] then the flood came then the miracle
[1:00:58] miracle rain
[1:00:59] who knows about rain no god no one had
[1:01:01] to obey first
[1:01:02] so you act on his word and you'll see a
[1:01:04] real miracle something will start to
[1:01:06] take place when you act upon it and
[1:01:09] gideon cast his fear down
[1:01:11] he cast all the excuses down anything
[1:01:13] that he had and he cast that down
[1:01:15] admitted or not
[1:01:16] and god's because god said you're going
[1:01:18] to take care of the midianites
[1:01:22] lord bram says throw talking about moses
[1:01:25] he says throw down your stick
[1:01:27] throw down your staff he said in other
[1:01:29] words he says get
[1:01:30] rid of everything that's around you amen
[1:01:33] he says
[1:01:34] let god saying let me have it he's
[1:01:36] saying oh i got an awful temper
[1:01:38] give it a god he says oh he knows how to
[1:01:40] quiet down he's like oh i got a whole
[1:01:41] lot of lust
[1:01:42] he says he knows how to take that away
[1:01:44] just put it in his hands
[1:01:46] and watch what a miracle can do
[1:01:49] just give it to him throw your excuses
[1:01:51] or some crutch or whatever down
[1:01:52] give it to him and he'll take care of it
[1:01:54] amen
[1:01:55] obedience comes before the miracles
[1:02:02] thank you david you can take that down
[1:02:09] everyone says well where's all these
[1:02:11] miracles we give a thousand dollars to
[1:02:13] anybody that will permit
[1:02:15] a permit it will produce anybody that
[1:02:17] will permit will
[1:02:18] produce a miracle you he says
[1:02:21] someone said i'll give you you know give
[1:02:23] a thousand anybody who will permit and
[1:02:24] will and do a miracle
[1:02:26] potter brown says you poured deliberated
[1:02:28] backslidden twice dead plucked it by the
[1:02:30] roots
[1:02:32] he says how are you ever going to see a
[1:02:34] miracle until you become one
[1:02:36] i love it a miracle of god's grace to
[1:02:38] take an unbelieving doubter
[1:02:40] and fill him with the holy ghost if you
[1:02:41] want to see a miracle
[1:02:43] he says become a miracle amen that's
[1:02:46] where the miracle for that's what gideon
[1:02:47] become
[1:02:48] he become the miracle and god said rise
[1:02:50] up mighty man of valor
[1:02:52] there was the miracle and he says where
[1:02:54] are all the miracles you just have to
[1:02:55] look right
[1:02:55] at him i'm starting to obey the word oh
[1:02:57] look at this i'm the miracle now my fear
[1:02:59] and all of my unbelief or my excuses of
[1:03:02] whatever it was for here but now
[1:03:03] he was taking his sword and leading the
[1:03:05] charge amen and that's exactly for you
[1:03:07] don't give a bunch of excuses
[1:03:09] you become the miracle by acting on
[1:03:10] god's word in your situation
[1:03:14] the same power that saves you
[1:03:17] heals you delivers you comforts you
[1:03:21] it's the same one same one
[1:03:27] he says and you know down in your heart
[1:03:29] that supernatural work has been done
[1:03:31] when jesus christ enters enters your
[1:03:34] body
[1:03:34] and you become a living oracle of jesus
[1:03:37] christ you
[1:03:38] entomb the holy ghost inside of you and
[1:03:40] you're walking like gideon did now
[1:03:42] on his word he says and you know then
[1:03:44] down in your heart that a supernatural
[1:03:46] work has been done
[1:03:47] by a supernatural being when you once
[1:03:48] drank you smoked you lied
[1:03:50] you and you women loved the world so
[1:03:51] much you kept wearing makeup and your
[1:03:53] long or short hair he says and doing
[1:03:55] other things you did and find out
[1:03:56] something happens

[1:07:27] man you have the same thing because it's
[1:07:28] jehovah shalom is what he but it
[1:07:31] gave it an offering and a peace offering
[1:07:34] and he says jehovah
[1:07:35] shalom he is my peace that's where that
[1:07:38] is from

[1:07:40] promise as gideon
[1:07:42] amen he's my jehovah shalom i shall
[1:07:46] not die
[1:07:51] you know but there's some work to be
[1:07:52] done and gideon couldn't dilly dally
[1:07:55] around
[1:07:56] because that same night and it says
[1:07:59] the same night the lord said unto him
[1:08:02] take thy father's block
[1:08:05] and the second block that's seven years
[1:08:09] old
[1:08:10] and he told him he needed to do some
[1:08:12] business
[1:08:13] because his family his father's family
[1:08:16] was not in order
[1:08:18] and so here now he had to actually do
[1:08:20] something
[1:08:21] he had to do something he had to start
[1:08:24] taking back
[1:08:25] he said i had to start saying okay we're
[1:08:27] not we're not all right here
[1:08:29] god's wanted to do a mighty work and
[1:08:30] something caught fire in him
[1:08:32] he says he's a god of miracles he's
[1:08:34] alive right now today
[1:08:35] but god's saying you got to clean up
[1:08:36] here you're gonna you're gonna do a
[1:08:37] little bit so you're gonna go down
[1:08:39] and you're gonna tear down the idols
[1:08:41] you're gonna tear down the groves
[1:08:42] you're gonna go down there with the
[1:08:43] bullock and you're gonna take the
[1:08:44] bullock to seven years to have a bullock
[1:08:46] of seven years old that's still in their
[1:08:48] possession this fellow was hidden for a
[1:08:50] very long time
[1:08:51] because he had been snatched very
[1:08:53] quickly by the immediate knights
[1:08:55] seven years okay he's gotta have been
[1:08:58] hidden somewhere
[1:08:59] or he wouldn't have survived so this was
[1:09:00] a precious block
[1:09:07] it doesn't really matter what it is how
[1:09:09] something that you've held
[1:09:11] is so present some some circumstance or
[1:09:14] some passion
[1:09:15] or some idol in your life
[1:09:18] god is saying take it all and he took
[1:09:21] his
[1:09:21] men and servants yeah he had some
[1:09:22] servants and he took him in the night
[1:09:25] he was he it was being a little a little
[1:09:27] cautious he
[1:09:28] took him in the night took him all down
[1:09:31] and tore
[1:09:32] down the groves and the idols and he
[1:09:35] took the bullock the groves has actually
[1:09:37] cut them down that would have been
[1:09:38] like trees and and like a an area they
[1:09:41] would have uh you know
[1:09:42] worship their idols in and such if you
[1:09:44] look into it it's it's like
[1:09:46] they would have been very precious uh
[1:09:47] groves because these are areas that they
[1:09:49] would
[1:09:50] worship their god and he cut him down
[1:09:52] and then used that
[1:09:53] uh for the for the for the fire for the
[1:09:55] for the sacrifice and took that seven
[1:09:57] seven year old bullock and sacrificed
[1:09:59] him on the lord

[1:15:38] like gideon
[1:15:39] and be a mighty man of valor in this day
[1:15:41] and age cut it back
[1:15:45] scripture says god hath chosen the
[1:15:48] foolish things of the world to confound
[1:15:49] the wise
[1:15:50] moses he blamed his inaccuracy
[1:15:53] inadequacies of his speech
[1:15:55] excuses we're talking excuses gideon has
[1:15:57] excuses
[1:15:58] moses he has excuses a lot of excuses
[1:16:00] god says no no i've chosen the foolish
[1:16:02] things of the world to confound the wise
[1:16:03] i've chosen the weak things of the world
[1:16:05] to confound them that are mighty so you
[1:16:07] think you're weak
[1:16:08] you think you're low you think you're
[1:16:09] you're inadequate
[1:16:11] that's god's way he put you in scripture
[1:16:13] and the base things of the worlds
[1:16:14] and the things which are despised hath
[1:16:16] god chosen yey and the things which are
[1:16:18] not
[1:16:18] to bring to not things that are amen he
[1:16:21] god chooses the weak so that he can show
[1:16:23] his power through a surrendered life
[1:16:25] that's exactly what he wants he said
[1:16:27] well i'm not spiritual enough
[1:16:29] who who's setting the level of
[1:16:30] spirituality
[1:16:33] is that just some excuse on your mind
[1:16:36] no no no god god came to the humble the
[1:16:39] poor
[1:16:40] and the wretched that's a good place to
[1:16:42] be
[1:16:43] the thing that i'm no no you'd be humble
[1:16:45] you think you're poor in spirit that's a
[1:16:47] god came god
[1:16:48] forgot the pharisees who thought they
[1:16:49] were wise and and high and
[1:16:51] in their in their inner religion no no
[1:16:53] god didn't come to that he came to the
[1:16:55] humble and to the meek
[1:16:56] and to the wretches and the poor he said
[1:17:00] well i can't live it
[1:17:01] nope you can't but you can with him you
[1:17:04] can with him
[1:17:05] problem is you maybe just haven't
[1:17:06] surrendered and you've held on to maybe
[1:17:08] maybe he's a little idol maybe it's a
[1:17:09] grove
[1:17:10] but you need to fully surrender and then
[1:17:12] he can do it through you
[1:17:13] i said well it's too early
[1:17:17] i've got life to live a life before me
[1:17:22] and then you go through that and then
[1:17:24] the devil was like
[1:17:25] no i'm too far gone say god doesn't even
[1:17:28] want me
[1:17:29] satan plays me on both sides you're too
[1:17:31] early so you can't forget about it now
[1:17:33] he goes now you go far in times too this
[1:17:35] is the devil
[1:17:35] he's the devil he's going to hit you on
[1:17:37] either side you need to recognize it's
[1:17:39] just an excuse
[1:17:41] because you know you need god and this
[1:17:44] is an excuse that he's put in it's just
[1:17:45] like
[1:17:45] i have cows i need to prove them i have
[1:17:48] some land i need to go look at it
[1:17:49] that's all it is you've put your excuse
[1:17:51] on the scale
[1:17:55] i don't think i've ever heard a
[1:17:56] christian someone else in here can tell
[1:17:59] me

[1:18:08] filled them with the holy ghost
[1:18:09] and they are just consumed with jesus
[1:18:12] and they all want to be an ambassador
[1:18:13] for him
[1:18:14] they're a steward of his grace as we
[1:18:15] spoke on and they're just walking to
[1:18:17] victoria's life have you ever heard
[1:18:19] someone like that say you know what
[1:18:21] i just i should have delayed longer

[1:18:25] never let satan tell you it's too early
[1:18:27] you you need to have some fun first
[1:18:29] because then he's going to play on you
[1:18:30] and be like yeah you're too far gone
[1:18:31] have fun bud
[1:18:32] you you missed it he'll play on you on
[1:18:34] both there are two rotten excuses that
[1:18:36] he's planting and trying to blame those
[1:18:38] situations
[1:18:38] you need to see what they are see
[1:18:40] through it say that's just a devil
[1:18:41] hindering me from a victorious walk with
[1:18:43] god
[1:18:46] and it's a barrier and you're living
[1:18:48] miserable because of it
[1:18:50] because you've tried to maybe give some
[1:18:51] excuse shift the blame out there
[1:18:53] try to justify your reason or faltering
[1:18:55] or backside whatever just to ease your
[1:18:57] conscience
[1:18:58] it's just an excuse and if i want to put
[1:19:00] it on the scale
[1:19:01] i would say as scripture your excuse has
[1:19:04] been weighed in the balance
[1:19:06] and has been found wanting that's where
[1:19:09] your excuses
[1:19:13] and i want you to keep that in your
[1:19:14] heart like i said it might be for one
[1:19:18] i stood on a pulpit several years ago
[1:19:21] and i had a man of god speak some very
[1:19:24] specific words to me
[1:19:25] and i said i don't have anything to say
[1:19:28] i got nothing to say
[1:19:29] he says he'll put the words in your
[1:19:30] mouth i said i said i can't do this
[1:19:33] but i said for one i said i'll do this
[1:19:36] just for one
[1:19:37] i don't care if it's one ten years from
[1:19:39] now i don't care if the one is already
[1:19:40] found i don't know
[1:19:41] but lower my focus i'll go for one so if
[1:19:43] the 99 are in that little sheet fold i'm
[1:19:45] calling for one i'm saying your excuse
[1:19:47] your excuse has been weighed in this
[1:19:48] balance and is found wanting
[1:19:51] and god is saying come come unto me
[1:19:53] you're heavy laden
[1:19:54] satan's pouring it on forget the excuses
[1:19:57] there's no excuse valid
[1:19:59] come unto me i will release you of your
[1:20:01] burden i'll release you of your sin
[1:20:03] and eternity is in the future for you if
[1:20:06] you just
[1:20:07] come and accept the bidding of my
[1:20:10] invitation
[1:20:17] i'm going to just go a little quicker
[1:20:19] now
[1:20:22] you know the rest of this
[1:20:25] parable of matthew 22 there there's
[1:20:28] different accounts of same parable and
[1:20:31] it goes to the end
[1:20:33] and uh and the robes are sent out
[1:20:37] scripture says to go there from the
[1:20:39] highways and the byways they they they
[1:20:40] dismissed it they excused it they
[1:20:42] they had some issues uh things better
[1:20:44] they had that they had
[1:20:46] they found better than to come to this
[1:20:48] great feast this great invitation
[1:20:49] and so king said go in the highways and
[1:20:52] the byways and compel them to come and
[1:20:53] i'm compelling
[1:20:55] god is compelling they rejected the
[1:20:57] imitation
[1:20:58] hey come god's saying come on to me he's
[1:21:00] now compelling from the highways and the
[1:21:02] byways
[1:21:03] and the lowly and the wretched and the
[1:21:04] weak he saying come come unto me come to
[1:21:07] my feast
[1:21:07] and he says in the king now he's going
[1:21:09] through his guests are here
[1:21:14] and he said unto him friend oh come as
[1:21:17] thou
[1:21:18] hither not having a wedding garment
[1:21:22] here's a person who came to the feast he
[1:21:24] heard the call he was intrigued maybe he
[1:21:26] had a desire of some sort
[1:21:28] you know hell there was a feast and he
[1:21:30] came
[1:21:32] but for some reason some reason some
[1:21:35] excuse that he made up in his mind
[1:21:37] i couldn't even contrive one he felt he
[1:21:39] didn't need to come by
[1:21:41] the way to come by god's provided way
[1:21:44] he felt you know what i'm good enough
[1:21:46] what i'm in
[1:21:47] is good enough i think we did a skit on
[1:21:49] it and i think that whoever was acting
[1:21:51] said he called me in this and so i
[1:21:54] should be just fine to be there in my
[1:21:56] same way in my same clothes if i was
[1:21:58] good enough to be called with this
[1:21:59] clothing on i'm good enough to be at his
[1:22:00] face with his clothing on
[1:22:02] you know i don't know he he's something
[1:22:03] in his mind some excuse
[1:22:05] he felt was valid that he did not come
[1:22:08] by
[1:22:09] the way he didn't have to come and i god
[1:22:12] forbid
[1:22:12] that something in your mind says you
[1:22:14] know i don't need it i didn't come
[1:22:15] you know i'm a good person i don't need
[1:22:17] to be baptized
[1:22:18] why you know why should i wear long hair
[1:22:20] i you know i fit in here pretty well i'm
[1:22:22] a good person
[1:22:22] you know why do i need to change my
[1:22:24] robes why do i need to adjust you know
[1:22:25] who i am a little bit no no
[1:22:27] no no i'm going to read to you the next
[1:22:30] bit of scripture
[1:22:33] i'm going to read you a quote first but
[1:22:35] ibrahim says
[1:22:37] the only they only had one way
[1:22:41] he said no not 960 different ways but
[1:22:44] jesus
[1:22:45] he said i am that way. the king's son
[1:22:48] the bridegroom stood there at the door
[1:22:49] received the invitation
[1:22:50] each one of them come with an invitation
[1:22:51] the bridegroom received the invitation
[1:22:52] the father had given he said he had
[1:22:54] handed out the bridegroom the bridegroom
[1:22:55] in return put a robe on he's just
[1:22:56] explaining kind of how this
[1:22:58] worked on the east oh my he put a robe
[1:23:00] on everyone that's good bad rich poor
[1:23:01] whichever
[1:23:02] he said now this rope is none other than
[1:23:04] the baptism
[1:23:06] of the holy ghost he says that's the
[1:23:08] robe
[1:23:09] and so just giving you just so you're
[1:23:11] very clear
[1:23:12] that's the robe you need for this great
[1:23:15] invitation
[1:23:16] for this great banquet for this great
[1:23:18] feast and there is no excuse because
[1:23:20] what happened
[1:23:21] what happened was the scripture says
[1:23:25] and he was speechless
[1:23:30] at that moment there was no valid excuse
[1:23:37] and he stood there and said friend why
[1:23:40] come a style sitter not having a wedding
[1:23:42] garment
[1:23:44] and everything that maybe he brought up
[1:23:46] in his mind through his life why he
[1:23:47] could be the way he was why he could
[1:23:49] live the way he did
[1:23:50] what he like he could do the way he did
[1:23:52] he justified it and he said well because
[1:23:53] of this circumstance because of that
[1:23:54] this is the way i am and then all of
[1:23:56] that came to play he said
[1:23:58] wait a second you're going to stand
[1:23:59] before god at one point and say well
[1:24:01] friend
[1:24:02] why didn't you come by though by by me
[1:24:04] why didn't you come
[1:24:05] through the way why didn't you come
[1:24:07] through jesus christ i i bid i called
[1:24:09] and even if you came i would have put a
[1:24:10] robe on you
[1:24:11] if you came the right way god's provided
[1:24:14] way
[1:24:15] and he stood there and scripture says he
[1:24:18] was speechless
[1:24:21] he said lord do not
[1:24:24] be there at that moment where you are
[1:24:26] speechless
[1:24:29] now i'm going to turn a little bit of a
[1:24:31] corner
[1:24:32] i'm going to praise help me this corner
[1:24:42] lord said on the adam we're gonna go
[1:24:43] back to the beginning
[1:24:45] he says where art thou and he said i
[1:24:47] heard the voice in the garden and i was
[1:24:49] afraid because i was naked and hid
[1:24:51] myself
[1:24:52] we're talking excuses and he said who
[1:24:54] told me that that was naked
[1:24:56] hast thou eaten of the tree where have i
[1:24:57] commanded thee that thou should does not
[1:24:59] eat
[1:25:00] and the man said the woman
[1:25:03] whom thou gavest
[1:25:06] the woman whom thou gavest he's speaking
[1:25:08] to god
[1:25:10] and he's making an excuse and actually
[1:25:11] putting blame but
[1:25:13] you gave me the woman and she gave me
[1:25:16] the tree and i didn't eat
[1:25:18] the lord said unto the woman what is
[1:25:19] this that that was done and the woman
[1:25:21] said
[1:25:22] the serpent beguiled me and i did eat
[1:25:26] beguiled we know that's he's subtle he
[1:25:28] was a subtle and he and he and he
[1:25:30] he deceived her in in in uh in a way and
[1:25:33] he beguiled her into it and moments
[1:25:34] where she could say i really didn't even
[1:25:36] know what i was doing
[1:25:37] he beguiled me his fault
[1:25:42] be with him and the lord said unto the
[1:25:46] serpent because that was done this thou
[1:25:47] art cursed
[1:25:48] above all cattle above all the beasts of
[1:25:50] the field upon thy belly thou shalt go
[1:25:52] in the dust thou shalt eat you know he
[1:25:54] didn't even ask him
[1:25:55] he didn't say now why did you no he just
[1:25:56] said because he did this didn't even
[1:25:58] give him the time of day to speak
[1:26:03] god here i can hear them going down the
[1:26:05] garden eating
[1:26:11] he says i can hear him going down
[1:26:12] through the garden something like this
[1:26:13] clap clap
[1:26:14] you've read the quote he said what is
[1:26:16] his bloody skin slapping his leg and i
[1:26:18] could see all that great space
[1:26:20] less eternity come forming down like a
[1:26:22] funnel like four
[1:26:23] little letters of l-o-v-e and he loved
[1:26:26] his children so much
[1:26:27] until he couldn't turn them away and he
[1:26:30] says stop
[1:26:32] i'll put enmity between thy seed i love
[1:26:35] how brother bradham dramatizes that we
[1:26:37] can just read through the scripture
[1:26:38] and we can read through but he curses
[1:26:40] the serpent and he listens to their
[1:26:41] excuses
[1:26:42] curses the serpent and it's like all oh
[1:26:45] it's just
[1:26:46] everything's in chaos right there at the
[1:26:47] moment he's here god is in all this
[1:26:49] great eternity and it just funnels down
[1:26:51] into four little
[1:26:52] l o v e and he loved his children so
[1:26:55] much he could he said stop
[1:26:57] i'll put enmity between thee and the
[1:26:58] serpent seed thy seed in the serpent
[1:27:00] seed he said promising a redeemer
[1:27:03] amen and i'll it shall bruise thy head
[1:27:05] and thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:27:06] oh i'm so glad there was that extra
[1:27:08] scripture it didn't end right there he
[1:27:10] says no
[1:27:10] no no i'm going to take care of
[1:27:12] something here and he says stop
[1:27:14] and he places a promise and a prophecy
[1:27:17] and i want to just talk about that here
[1:27:19] now
[1:27:23] their excuses didn't stand anything e
[1:27:26] adam eve it didn't matter the penalty
[1:27:29] was
[1:27:30] you transgress you die and the blame
[1:27:34] didn't really matter you could pass the
[1:27:36] blame but abram says
[1:27:39] they tried why the woman you gave me the
[1:27:41] serpent beguiled me he was the one that
[1:27:43] had the affair he did this he said they
[1:27:45] went right on to judgment just the same
[1:27:48] and now the blame they tried to pass the
[1:27:50] blame
[1:27:51] on and here
[1:27:55] god is saying oh no no he said stop
[1:27:58] and he gives a scripture and he says no
[1:28:01] no
[1:28:02] i gotta do something and hear god i was
[1:28:05] reading
[1:28:06] just about us and he's and here if you
[1:28:08] read in leviticus
[1:28:09] they had this is what they had
[1:28:13] they had to put a they had two goats two
[1:28:15] kid goats
[1:28:16] and they had to do a um a ceremony they
[1:28:19] they sacrificed one
[1:28:20] and one was a scapegoat this is where
[1:28:22] scapegoat come is in the scripture
[1:28:25] and it says he shall take two goats
[1:28:28] present them before the lord of the door
[1:28:30] and abe and aaron will cast lots upon
[1:28:32] the two goats one lot for the lord one
[1:28:34] for the scapegoat
[1:28:34] and aaron shall bring the goat upon the
[1:28:36] lord at which the lord's lot fell and
[1:28:38] offer him for a sin offering
[1:28:39] and but the goat on which the lord fell
[1:28:41] to be a scapegoat shall be presented a
[1:28:43] lie before the lord make an atonement
[1:28:44] and let him go for his scapegoat and
[1:28:47] what he did
[1:28:47] aaron would take that goat that was
[1:28:49] chosen as a scapegoat
[1:28:51] and he would take both his hands upon
[1:28:53] the head of the live goat
[1:28:55] and he'd confess over him all the
[1:28:56] iniquities of the children of israel
[1:28:58] and all their transgressions and all
[1:29:00] their sins i'm reading scripture putting
[1:29:01] them upon the head of the goat
[1:29:03] and send him away by the hand of a fit
[1:29:04] man in the wilderness and that goat
[1:29:06] shall bear upon him all the iniquities
[1:29:09] all the sin
[1:29:10] unto a land not inhabited and he shall
[1:29:12] go let the goat
[1:29:14] go in the wilderness but ibrahim says
[1:29:16] his soul was cast in hell speaking of
[1:29:18] jesus because he was a castaway
[1:29:20] he was the scapegoat of the old
[1:29:22] testament who put their sins upon the
[1:29:23] people
[1:29:24] upon the scapegoat and turned them out
[1:29:25] into the wilderness to die jesus
[1:29:27] was the scapegoat who had the sins of
[1:29:30] the people upon him and was cast away
[1:29:31] and went into hell to suffer tortures
[1:29:33] and his body went in the great
[1:29:34] grave to pay the price and i was just
[1:29:36] pondering that he said oh lord
[1:29:38] because i was thinking of the blame here
[1:29:39] adam and eve were trying to put some
[1:29:41] blame and trying to
[1:29:42] make an excuse for what they did and
[1:29:44] they were there was no excuse they it
[1:29:46] didn't
[1:29:46] it wasn't valid here god was oh oh no no
[1:29:49] stop i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm
[1:29:51] gonna
[1:29:51] make a way for this before the
[1:29:53] foundation the world is this was
[1:29:54] already on his mind and he goes and i
[1:29:56] just imagine here in
[1:29:58] israel someone if this they had done
[1:30:00] this and they let this goat escape go go
[1:30:02] into the into the wilderness here
[1:30:04] and some would say well uh you know
[1:30:06] bring up some issue or some circumstance
[1:30:08] or something they did and
[1:30:09] well you know i didn't know if i did
[1:30:11] that and someone maybe is bringing up
[1:30:13] some excuse of why
[1:30:14] they did or didn't do something but he
[1:30:16] said wait a second no no no
[1:30:17] no no that was late on the goat that was
[1:30:20] that was that was that those iniquities
[1:30:22] were laid on the goat
[1:30:23] that's what aaron did he laid his hands
[1:30:25] and confessed all the iniquities of the
[1:30:26] children israel and that person could
[1:30:27] say no no no
[1:30:28] that's in the wilderness that was put on
[1:30:31] that was put on the scapegoat
[1:30:32] i don't need an excuse cause it's
[1:30:34] already this but he took that
[1:30:36] he put it's on the goat it's the goat's
[1:30:38] problem he could say that
[1:30:40] he could say that and i just thought my
[1:30:43] my
[1:30:43] when you come to jesus christ when you
[1:30:46] come to jesus christ
[1:30:48] you can satan can throw on what about
[1:30:49] this what about that you're like oh well
[1:30:51] i you know i but i wasn't
[1:30:53] i didn't mean to do that but it was this
[1:30:54] issue no no no
[1:30:56] you don't need you don't need an excuse
[1:30:58] you don't need to worry about it there's
[1:30:59] no need to cast blame on nothing
[1:31:01] because jesus christ was our scapegoat
[1:31:05] oh my goodness i just said oh lord i can
[1:31:08] just imagine
[1:31:10] imagine that feeling of being able to
[1:31:12] say no no no he took my sin
[1:31:14] oh my goodness i'm just i don't want to
[1:31:17] speak in that
[1:31:18] just a little bit because i can imagine
[1:31:21] i had this happening in my notes here
[1:31:23] look i'm going to skip ahead hear the
[1:31:24] bleeding lamina i can just imagine
[1:31:26] and he's getting whipped and he's
[1:31:28] getting smacked
[1:31:29] and he's getting beaten and he's getting
[1:31:31] and here's the bleeding clam
[1:31:33] hear the bling lamp and you know what he
[1:31:34] didn't do he's the only one that could
[1:31:36] say it
[1:31:37] and he could get the weight of the whip
[1:31:38] him on the back and they're just tearing
[1:31:39] his skin
[1:31:40] and he can say oh it's not my fault
[1:31:44] it's michael's fault
[1:31:47] he's the only one that could say that
[1:31:49] because he was the innocent lamb
[1:31:51] of god and he could sit there and he
[1:31:53] took he could take the and he could have
[1:31:55] screamed out
[1:31:56] no it's not it's orang's fault why am i
[1:31:58] taking this pain
[1:32:04] but he didn't do that horn
[1:32:09] he didn't do that he took it all he took
[1:32:12] it all
[1:32:13] because the satan can come and say what
[1:32:15] about that
[1:32:17] no no i am blameless i am smallest
[1:32:21] he took it the scapegoat took it go deal
[1:32:24] with him he can't because he conquered
[1:32:27] death
[1:32:27] and hell in the grave stripped him of
[1:32:29] his keys and arose into heaven
[1:32:31] satan don't have even the opportunity
[1:32:33] and he couldn't even if he tried
[1:32:35] amen that's the scapegoat that's why you
[1:32:37] need to come that's why you need to be
[1:32:39] bitten that's why you need to say yes
[1:32:40] i'm running to through the way i'm
[1:32:42] running to jesus christ
[1:32:44] because if you cannot point to the
[1:32:46] scapegoat
[1:32:47] oh god your excuses won't matter
[1:32:52] and you will stand speechless because
[1:32:54] you'll have nothing to say
[1:32:56] i want to be able to say look to the
[1:32:57] lamb of god who bore my sin
[1:33:00] who bore my shame that's why the
[1:33:02] scriptures say who
[1:33:03] can lay anything to the charge of god's
[1:33:06] elect you can't
[1:33:07] satan can't because he took your blame
[1:33:09] and you
[1:33:10] don't have any
[1:33:13] that's why you're blameless and you
[1:33:16] don't need an excuse
[1:33:17] because he's had a lamb who took
[1:33:22] your sin and your shame
[1:33:26] hallelujah musicians you can come
[1:33:34] i'm so thankful he didn't say it's
[1:33:36] michael's sin
[1:33:38] he should be the one bearing this he
[1:33:41] should be hanging on this cross right
[1:33:42] now
[1:33:43] why am i taking his why no no
[1:33:47] he took it from me because he loved me
[1:33:50] he took it for you
[1:33:52] because he loved you
[1:33:56] and there's now now
[1:33:59] there's therefore now this moment
[1:34:03] this moment no condemnation
[1:34:07] you have no guilt no shame no excuses
[1:34:11] why you need to only have some
[1:34:12] something on your conscience because he
[1:34:14] took it all and he surrendered it down
[1:34:16] to him
[1:34:17] amen there will be one person that'll be
[1:34:20] one person
[1:34:21] one day we'll be rendered speechless i
[1:34:24] read the scripture
[1:34:25] the serpent he didn't even get any time
[1:34:27] and he didn't get he didn't get the time
[1:34:28] of day to even say nothing
[1:34:29] and i just kind of chuckled and said no
[1:34:31] and he didn't he was cursed
[1:34:32] so he couldn't even talk anymore nothing
[1:34:34] god took it away he couldn't even
[1:34:36] down the rest through history he
[1:34:37] couldn't even say nothing else he could
[1:34:39] never account to ever talk about the
[1:34:40] time he could never bring it before eve
[1:34:42] nothing god said he didn't even give him
[1:34:43] time today to say anything
[1:34:44] and cursed him to the ground and and
[1:34:46] took just completely changed him
[1:34:48] and it's nothing to say i just thought
[1:34:52] lord
[1:34:52] my he adam and eve probably had enough
[1:34:56] time in their minds
[1:34:58] oh what do we do to have to have that
[1:35:00] still being able to to confront them
[1:35:02] with their problem
[1:35:03] or what happened in the garden but god
[1:35:04] said no i rendered him to nothing
[1:35:06] but you know satan he took that role
[1:35:09] real well
[1:35:10] his accuser of the brethren and the
[1:35:12] scripture says
[1:35:13] day and night he's still trying to cast
[1:35:17] well look at that they doing this look
[1:35:19] at that they doing that
[1:35:20] look at this they're doing that he's
[1:35:21] still trying day
[1:35:23] and night before the lord that's what
[1:35:25] he's trying to do scripture says
[1:35:28] in revelations for the accuser of our
[1:35:31] brother
[1:35:32] is cast down
[1:35:35] which accused them before our lord god
[1:35:37] before our god
[1:35:38] day and night he tried
[1:35:42] he tried i don't know why he didn't get
[1:35:44] the fact
[1:35:45] that someone that has put their hands on
[1:35:48] the sacrifice
[1:35:49] said i'm sorry but my sins were laid
[1:35:52] upon the scapegoat
[1:35:53] and i don't have any excuse to give you
[1:35:56] because it's all on jesus
[1:35:57] he took it all for me i don't know what
[1:35:59] you're saying devil because he's trying
[1:36:01] to bring stuff up
[1:36:02] from god god's saying i don't i don't
[1:36:04] hear it either because it can't
[1:36:05] penetrate
[1:36:06] through the blood he just he must be
[1:36:08] standing there day and night and it just
[1:36:10] must be mute
[1:36:11] it just must be silence and he looks
[1:36:13] like he's speaking all the time
[1:36:14] but god's like i don't know what you're
[1:36:16] saying hey what a waste of his time
[1:36:18] but he's trying constantly constantly
[1:36:20] constantly and he i want you to
[1:36:22] recognize
[1:36:23] that that's the same he might do that to
[1:36:24] you but you need to realize
[1:36:26] just do it like god is doing in heaven
[1:36:28] sorry i can't hear you
[1:36:29] because it can't penetrate the bloodline
[1:36:32] that can't get through the stream of
[1:36:33] blood
[1:36:34] from calvary he he finished it it's over
[1:36:37] he's a mute may he be mute to you
[1:36:44] he's mute because you are blameless
[1:36:48] you are blameless and one day
[1:36:52] one day
[1:36:56] one day he will be rendered speechless
[1:36:59] and he'll have nothing more to say and
[1:37:01] be cast in a lake of fire
[1:37:04] and because of scripture after that the
[1:37:07] scripture after that
[1:37:12] says because they overcame him by the
[1:37:14] blood of the lamb
[1:37:16] that's how you overcome them and that's
[1:37:19] how you render him speechless
[1:37:21] and there's no valid excuse you stand
[1:37:23] there
[1:37:25] free free
[1:37:30] amen amen i always pray that
[1:37:35] you are here tonight
[1:37:39] and i pray maybe god has allowed just
[1:37:41] the fog to clear
[1:37:43] and you can get real honest
[1:37:46] and say yeah you know what i've put some
[1:37:48] excuses out there
[1:37:50] and they i want you to look at them real
[1:37:53] hard and say
[1:37:55] because i'm going to tell you again
[1:37:56] there's no
[1:37:58] valid excuse
[1:38:01] and by the grace of god i pray that you
[1:38:03] can set it there and say lord
[1:38:05] that's just not worth it it's just not
