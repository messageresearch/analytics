[13:45] and find my tri.
[13:52] Oh, so thirsty

[14:07] if I wander.
[14:11] Far away from

[17:28] Oh

[17:35] my

[17:44] god.
[17:50] [Music]
[17:58] Hallelujah.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Set your desire this morning that he
[18:03] would just have his way. That you would
[18:04] have full liberty in our midst this
[18:06] morning.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, pour your spirit out. We pray.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Have your way, oh God. Whatever your
[18:13] mind for this service will be, Lord,
[18:15] that is our desire. Oh God,
[18:18] &gt;&gt; come Lord Jesus.
[18:20] Hallelujah. We welcome you, Lord. We
[18:23] welcome you into our midst, oh God.
[18:26] Lord, we lift your name in worship this
[18:29] morning for we love you, Lord. We love
[18:31] to sing your praises, oh God.
[18:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[18:37] Blessed be your name, oh God. You are
[18:40] worthy, Lord Jesus. Worthy, worthy,
[18:44] worthy is the Lord.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you have a need this morning, why
[18:47] don't you just lift your voice and
[18:48] worship, saints? Hallelujah. He inhabits
[18:51] the praises of his people. Hallelujah.
[18:54] And where the spirit of the Lord is,
[18:56] there is liberty this morning.
[18:58] Hallelujah.
[18:59] Hallelujah. Just take your knee and lay
[19:01] it at his feet and be free. Oh, be free
[19:04] to worship this morning. Hallelujah.
[19:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[19:10] Bless your name, Lord Jesus.
[19:12] Hallelujah. We love you, Lord. How we
[19:15] love you, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[19:18] Hallelujah.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[19:22] Hallelujah. Glory to your name.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; His presence is so wonderful, saints. I
[19:28] believe the supernatural is taking place
[19:30] even now.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're not
[19:34] looking to another time. Amen. Not I
[19:36] was, not I will be, but I am. He's here
[19:38] this morning. Amen. To do the work in
[19:41] our midst.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just going to go to prayer
[19:43] in this atmosphere this morning.
[19:46] Hallelujah. I wonder if our brother John
[19:47] Andy's Lord Brother John, would you just
[19:49] come and open the service for us in a
[19:51] word of prayer? We do want to remember
[19:53] unspoken prayer request from our sister
[19:55] Violet Laws this morning
[19:58] and also our sister Lydia Colenbrunner.
[20:02] She's worked in the Switzerland
[20:03] convention and she has a special request
[20:04] for a physical need this morning. Amen.
[20:07] I just wonder if the brothers would also
[20:09] come and prepare to take the morning
[20:10] offering.
[20:12] Amen. Maybe as they're coming, can we
[20:14] just sing, Lord, I lift your name, your
[20:16] holy name.
[20:19] [Music]
[20:22] The whole Lord I live
[20:29] in worship now as we go in prayer. Oh
[20:32] holy
[20:35] name
[20:36] [Music]
[20:42] my God
[20:49] for your great
[20:53] I
[20:54] am
[20:56] you are the is
[21:03] my God.
[21:06] [Music]
[21:10] Can we sing? Lord, I lift your name just
[21:12] once more. We go to prayer now. Lord, I
[21:16] lift your name.
[21:20] [Music]
[21:21] I lift your holy
[21:26] [Music]
[21:28] Oh
[21:31] my god.
[21:44] [Music]
[21:45] You are the ris
[21:51] and my comfort.
[21:53] [Music]
[21:57] Can I hear?
[21:59] [Music]
[22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's a need on your heart
[22:02] that you just want to lift before the
[22:04] Lord with an upraised hand. Amen. He
[22:05] sees every hand this morning. Brother
[22:07] John. Thank you.
[22:11] Heavenly Father,
[22:14] our father,
[22:18] we're here today because you have
[22:21] birthed us
[22:23] by your word.
[22:26] You screamed over this generation.
[22:29] Where is the generation that will love
[22:32] me, will love you,
[22:35] Lord? And here we are.
[22:39] It's only by your grace and your mercy
[22:42] that a blood came dripping down into
[22:45] this hour with a power of that bleach to
[22:48] take away all of our sin, all of our
[22:51] past. Only God can do this. Only a
[22:56] miracle can do this. Only a creative
[22:59] voice.
[23:01] Oh Jesus, we're humbled today that you
[23:05] have raised us up to be your wife. It's
[23:08] making ourselves ready. We're falling on
[23:11] the rock today. We're falling on you,
[23:14] Lord Jesus.
[23:16] This world is falling apart all around
[23:19] us. Satan's Eden has come to choke. The
[23:24] tree of knowledge is coming to so many
[23:26] hearts and lives, bringing death. He's
[23:29] riding through the land on his pale
[23:31] horse. And we're so grateful for a
[23:33] message. We're so grateful for a light
[23:36] that's come on in this darkness. We just
[23:39] feel like our souls are crying out
[23:41] hosanas and praises. We just feel like
[23:44] lifting up our voices, Lord, and
[23:47] shouting, "Thank you, Jesus." At the
[23:50] same time, Lord, there's tears. Our
[23:53] heart, Lord, is so grateful. We so
[23:57] appreciate you, God. We so love your
[24:00] appearing, God. What you've done in this
[24:03] day, Lord Jesus. You have spread your
[24:06] wings over us. Lord,
[24:08] [Music]
[24:10] we want to run into your pavilion today.
[24:13] Lord, those that are strangers, those
[24:16] that are weary, those that are broken,
[24:18] that your healing, strength, and virtue
[24:22] will lift up every soul that is weary.
[24:25] Every life that Lord needs a touch from
[24:27] you, our hands are lifted up, Lord. Our
[24:30] lives are naked, Lord. You have come to
[24:34] collect those that are honest in heart,
[24:36] Lord Jesus.
[24:38] Come to our hearts, Lord Jesus. That is
[24:41] the heart of the matter, Lord. That you
[24:43] would come and change us. Give us a new
[24:45] desire. Give us a new longing. That when
[24:49] your word comes as it was on the day of
[24:52] Pentecost, Lord, here we are. Lord, the
[24:55] calendar says it's Pentecost 50 days
[24:59] from Easter. Lord, let there be a life
[25:02] quickening among us. Lord Jesus, not
[25:05] just 2,000 years ago, but to recognize
[25:08] that a message has come to take a people
[25:11] into a body change. And these things
[25:13] that are on our hearts, these needs,
[25:15] these things that are so little to you,
[25:18] God, you're the creator. You're the
[25:20] healer. You're the dissolver of all
[25:23] doubts. Lord, you could just breathe a
[25:25] word, just a thought, Lord, and
[25:27] everything would just vanish, Lord.
[25:32] But you've chosen to come in the souls
[25:34] of men and women. But by that creative
[25:37] spoken word, now we would speak and we
[25:40] would have desires. We would have
[25:42] yearnings.
[25:44] It's the same thought, the same word,
[25:47] same atmosphere that is in heaven is in
[25:50] the service right now, permeating
[25:52] through our bodies and healing us,
[25:55] taking cancers away, dissolving, Lord,
[25:58] everything that would be out of order in
[26:00] our systems, Lord. Oh Jesus, our healer.
[26:03] Lord, by your stripes, we are healed.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Lover of our souls and deliverer of
[26:11] everything that is ungodly or evil. your
[26:14] dissolver of everything that is filthy
[26:16] or of Satan's kingdom. May the Holy
[26:19] Ghost, Lord, come through this
[26:21] atmosphere. Take hearts and break them
[26:23] down to nothing. Take all of us, Lord
[26:26] Jesus, for we are in need of a touch
[26:28] from you.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; To circumcise us,
[26:32] &gt;&gt; circumcise our souls, Lord.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; May the power of God strike us today,
[26:37] Lord Jesus. Consume us, holy fire.
[26:43] be with these needs, Lord. Our sister
[26:45] Violet has an unspoken request. Touch
[26:48] her family and touch her life.
[26:52] Sister Lydia Coen Brener, we spoke her
[26:55] name, Lord, with other believers on
[26:57] Friday, but once more, Lord, she's
[27:00] probably listening right now. We are a
[27:03] family. We are a body, Lord. the very
[27:07] mention of your name of Jesus. You can
[27:09] come into her system, Lord. And you're
[27:12] the great doctor and physician, what's
[27:14] causing the mass to leave and what's
[27:16] causing these things in her body. You
[27:19] know everything about it. We're under
[27:21] your great microscope today. Lord, I
[27:24] pray that you would touch Sister Lydia.
[27:27] Go out through the internet and
[27:29] throughout all the hundreds of the
[27:30] souls. Even in this building, God, we
[27:33] lift up our hands. There's unspoken
[27:35] requests. There's needs. Lord, we are
[27:38] not ashamed, Lord, to testify that you
[27:41] alone are the answer to our lives. The
[27:44] very lover, love of our soul is Jesus.
[27:49] Would you take our pastor today? Take
[27:51] the gift in his life and the channel
[27:53] that you predestinated for us to find
[27:56] the answer to our needs. May our
[27:58] children and our young people, may the
[28:00] middle-aged and the older ones find
[28:02] access into your presence today, Lord,
[28:05] that every need could be met. Lord, we
[28:08] want to put our all into this service.
[28:11] Strengthen the weary. May we be focused
[28:14] on you, Lord Jesus. Look and live.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; May you come through the songs, come
[28:20] through the worship. Bless this
[28:22] offering, Lord. The tithes and offerings
[28:25] of your people. Bless them. Bless every
[28:28] worshipper today. May we forget about
[28:30] ourselves and those around us. May we be
[28:33] locked into you, Lord Jesus. We're here
[28:36] to listen.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; We're here to obey. We're here to submit
[28:41] ourselves. We're here to say amen to
[28:43] your word and
[28:45] &gt;&gt; become material within our lives. we
[28:48] bless your name and break the bread now
[28:51] that's going to be spoken to us Lord and
[28:53] take the vessel and strengthen him and
[28:56] all of us we pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[29:01] [Music]
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe just as the brothers take up
[29:08] the offering and you have your seats we
[29:09] can sing. Sweep over my soul. Sweep over
[29:11] my soul sweet spirit. Amen.
[29:16] Oh, sweep over
[29:19] my soul.
[29:22] Sweep over
[29:24] my soul.
[29:27] Sweet spirit.
[29:30] Sweet over my soul.
[29:36] For my rest is complete.
[29:42] While I sit at your feet,
[29:46] sweet spirit,
[29:49] sweep over
[29:51] my soul. Sing it again. Sweep over my
[29:55] soul. Sweet over
[29:58] my soul.
[30:00] Sweep over
[30:03] my soul.
[30:06] Sweet spit.
[30:08] be over my soul.
[30:15] My best
[30:17] is complete
[30:19] while I sit at your feet.
[30:25] Sweet spirit,
[30:27] sweet over my soul.
[30:34] Just want the Lord to have his way this
[30:36] morning. And we do have an announcement
[30:38] want to remember um please announce that
[30:41] everyone is invited Thursday evening
[30:43] July the 18th 2013 to Mountain Baker
[30:46] Bible Way Camp for Brother Timothy Andy
[30:48] Sister Jessica Caldwell's wedding and
[30:50] reception. There's a signup sheet to
[30:52] RSVP on the bulletin board with all the
[30:53] details. Amen. God bless brother Tim.
[30:56] Sister Jessica looking forward to that.
[30:59] Amen. Did we have any luck brother Aaron
[31:01] with I had a number of requests. Um,
[31:04] someone that can't quite cross the
[31:07] border yet that
[31:10] we're looking. Do we have it?
[31:13] This is Elelliana. So, she'd love to be
[31:15] here, but she can't be here yet.
[31:19] Praise the Lord.
[31:22] Amen. God's been good to us. Praise the
[31:25] Lord.
[31:26] Amen. There's been a song on my heart
[31:28] that I've been feeling to sing for some
[31:30] time. Amen. And could we just sing Have
[31:32] Thine Own Way, Lord, as we just before I
[31:35] sing that, we turn the service to
[31:36] Brother Ed, I'm going to sing a song
[31:37] that the Lord's laid on my heart for
[31:39] you. And uh we Amen. It's just been
[31:43] heavy on my heart. And after brother Tom
[31:44] spoke this last Wednesday on trials and
[31:48] being molded by the potter, I said,
[31:49] "Okay, Lord, it's it's the right time."
[31:52] Ultimately, we just want to be
[31:53] surrendered to what God wants to do in
[31:55] our lives. Amen. Amen. And so as we sing
[31:57] this song, just keep that in your heart
[31:59] that we truly just want God to have his
[32:01] way this morning. Oh, have thine own
[32:05] way,
[32:07] Lord.
[32:10] Have thine own way.
[32:15] For thou art the water
[32:22] and I am
[32:24] [Music]
[32:28] Lord hold me and
[32:31] make me
[32:35] after I will
[32:41] what I am way.
[32:48] He has still once more. I'll have thy
[32:52] will. Oh, have thy own way,
[32:58] Lord.
[33:01] Have thy own way.
[33:06] For thorn
[33:08] [Music]
[33:19] holy and
[33:22] [Music]
[33:26] after I will
[33:30] [Music]
[33:34] Hey,
[33:36] [Music]
[34:12] I just wanted to briefly share a little
[34:14] bit of the inspiration
[34:16] behind this song. It's called the
[34:19] breaking and it has to do with the clay
[34:22] and the potter and
[34:26] how we may not always understand but the
[34:28] heart of the believer is thankful for
[34:30] the breaking thankful for what God does
[34:32] in our lives. And the Bible says in
[34:34] Jeremiah 18 that the word which came to
[34:36] Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and
[34:38] go down to the potter's house and there
[34:40] I will cause thee to hear my words. Then
[34:42] I went down to the potter's house, and
[34:44] behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.
[34:46] And the vessel that he made of clay was
[34:48] marred in the hand of the potter. So he
[34:50] made it again, another vessel, as seemed
[34:53] good to the potter to make it. Then the
[34:55] word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Oh
[34:56] house of Israel, cannot I cannot I do
[34:59] with you, as this potter, sayeth the
[35:01] Lord, behold, as the clay is in the
[35:03] potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, oh
[35:05] house of Israel." And then a very
[35:07] familiar quote, brother Brandham says in
[35:08] the Smyrnan church age. The cloudy skies
[35:11] and storms of life are no signs of God's
[35:13] disapproval. Neither are bright skies
[35:15] and still water signs of his love and
[35:16] approval. His approval of any of us is
[35:18] only in the beloved. His love is
[35:20] elective which he had for us before the
[35:22] foundation of the world. Does he love
[35:24] us? Oh yes. But how shall we know? We
[35:26] shall know because he said so and
[35:28] manifested that he did love us. For he
[35:31] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[35:33] spirit, placing us as sons. And how
[35:35] shall I prove my love to him? I love
[35:37] this part. By believing what he said and
[35:40] by conducting myself with joy amidst the
[35:42] trials that he and his wisdom allows to
[35:45] come to pass. And that's why the
[35:47] believer can say, "Lord, I thank you for
[35:48] the breaking because we know that it's
[35:50] making his mind come to full fruition in
[35:53] our lives." Amen. God bless you.
[36:01] For every vessel there's a season
[36:09] where the potter takes and molds and
[36:13] breaks and shapes it once again.
[36:17] [Music]
[36:19] And though I may not know the reason,
[36:27] there's much that I can't see.
[36:31] He knows what's best for me.
[36:37] He has a purpose for the fires we pass
[36:43] through.
[36:45] So I thank him for his love for me. That
[36:50] brings me to
[36:54] the breaking.
[37:00] [Music]
[37:04] Sometimes he leads beside still waters
[37:09] [Music]
[37:12] and causes me to rest and sleep in
[37:16] pastures soft and green.
[37:19] [Music]
[37:21] Sometimes he leads me through the fire.
[37:28] Yet even there I've seen
[37:33] that still he walks with me.
[37:38] It doesn't matter how the potter molds
[37:43] the clay.
[37:45] His plans for me are perfect. So I yield
[37:50] to him and say,
[37:54] "Though the storm around me rages, I'm
[37:58] anchored to the rock of ages. When it
[38:03] seems there's no escaping,
[38:06] Lord, I thank you for the breaking. When
[38:11] the sky is red above me, I'm reminded
[38:16] how you love me. And when it seems my
[38:21] world is shaking, Lord, I thank you for
[38:25] the breaking. Lord, I thank you for
[38:30] the breaking.
[38:32] [Music]
[38:40] I've watched the fires that surround me
[38:47] serve only to cleanse and remove the
[38:51] things that I don't need.
[38:56] And I've seen the waves that crash
[39:00] around me.
[39:03] Though violent they may be, they serve
[39:08] just to wash me clean.
[39:11] [Music]
[39:12] The driving wind can only drive me to my
[39:18] knees.
[39:19] And it's in the darkest nights that I
[39:23] most clearly see.
[39:27] That all the storm around me rages. I
[39:32] anchor to the rock of ages. When it
[39:37] seems there's no escaping,
[39:40] Lord, I thank you for the breaking. When
[39:45] the sky is red above me, I'm reminded
[39:50] how you love me. And when it seems my
[39:54] world is shaking, Lord, I thank you for
[39:59] the breaking. Lord, I thank you for
[40:04] the breaking.
[40:08] And as you take me and break me, I'm
[40:12] becoming more like you.
[40:16] So Lord, hold me and hold me. So your
[40:21] likeness will shine through. And when
[40:24] I'm broken,
[40:27] I'm open to the things you want to do.
[40:32] Don't break me,
[40:37] Lord. Break me,
[40:41] [Music]
[40:46] my maker, too,
[40:51] the rock
[40:53] of ages.
[40:57] And through each test and every trial, I
[41:02] know you're with me all the while. I see
[41:06] now what you're undertaking.
[41:09] So Lord, I thank you for the breaking.
[41:13] Through the pain and all molding,
[41:18] I can see your will unfolding. A
[41:21] masterpiece is what you're making. Lord,
[41:26] I thank you for the breaking. Lord, I
[41:30] thank you for
[41:33] the breaking.
[41:36] Oh,
[41:39] thank you for the breaking, Lord.
[41:47] I know a masterpiece
[41:50] is what you're making. Lord, I thank you
[41:55] for the breaking. Lord, I thank you for
[42:02] the breaking.
[42:05] [Music]
[42:27] [Applause]
[42:33] Oh, we thank God for the breaking.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:38] Glad that you're all here this morning.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Glad that the Holy Spirit is here.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'll ask you to rise
[42:48] and we're going to go directly to the
[42:50] word. We only have one service today
[42:54] &gt;&gt; and one service next Sunday because of
[42:57] the long weekend and the traffic and so
[42:59] on. And we brother John Andy's is going
[43:02] down to Reon this afternoon for the
[43:05] evening service there. So we pray that
[43:08] uh there won't be too much of a hold up
[43:10] at the at the border lineup. Uh we trust
[43:14] it'll just be better. Um we also want to
[43:17] remember brother Tim Dodd that's in
[43:19] Germany right now having services with
[43:22] uh brother Pankin. Brother Pankin
[43:25] happens to be brother Dystra's
[43:28] son-in-law.
[43:30] And brother Dyster as you know has been
[43:32] very very ill and is uh has has not
[43:36] recovered his strength as far as I know
[43:38] as yet. So, we just want to remember
[43:42] brother Tim Dodd that God will use him.
[43:44] It's a difficult trip. We just got back
[43:46] from uh Moscow and then two two and a
[43:50] half weeks later he's uh made another
[43:52] trip and he'll be coming back here on
[43:55] Tuesday. So, you know, the physical body
[43:58] we don't have the uh perhaps the same
[44:02] challenges that they had in the days of
[44:04] Wesley riding horses for ever so long.
[44:08] But I'll tell you, the planes are no joy
[44:10] trip.
[44:13] Brother Jim, I'm amazed that you make it
[44:16] back and forth.
[44:20] So, we want to remember that. Also, I'd
[44:22] like to
[44:24] say that uh we really appreciate the
[44:28] brothers that participated in the Friday
[44:30] night service from SFU and what God is
[44:34] doing there. And I can tell you it's not
[44:37] only happening in little local areas. I
[44:40] have uh uh I've been in contact constant
[44:43] contact for probably about the last four
[44:45] years with uh with the brother Basabosi
[44:48] in Uganda
[44:51] and uh I won't spend much time with that
[44:54] but he was that was the wedding that
[44:57] brother Tim Dodd took while the group
[45:00] from the from the school went over to
[45:02] Uganda and it was really really
[45:05] remarkable and incidentally pastor Ibali
[45:08] will be here June June the 23rd,
[45:12] that weekend of June the 23rd where uh
[45:16] to he wants to well we actually we put a
[45:20] lot of pressure on him to he was going
[45:22] to be your midweek and we said no you
[45:24] must be here on the weekend because that
[45:27] is the graduation weekend and these
[45:29] young people didn't go over there to
[45:31] work on your ceiling and then for you to
[45:33] miss out on us here. So he had to
[45:36] rearrange his ticket and pay a little
[45:37] bit extra and and so he will be here
[45:39] that weekend and ministering that Sunday
[45:42] uh the weekend of the 22nd 23rd in
[45:45] there.
[45:47] Uh so you'll remember that also
[45:50] uh this brother Babosi he's he just came
[45:53] out of Ethiopia. he got married and then
[45:57] you know because I had been uh texting
[45:59] him back and forth and brother Tim do
[46:01] been texting him as well about Ethiopia
[46:04] and brother uh Chimpaka brother Jean
[46:07] Chimpaka who uh I feel heavy this
[46:10] morning he should be here in the service
[46:13] and he was denied a visa in New York and
[46:17] had to return to Africa where he's
[46:19] working in Chad and uh the Chimpaka
[46:23] family is here this morning And we want
[46:25] you to know that we're heavy in our
[46:27] hearts with you and we're going to be
[46:28] praying that God will tear down the
[46:31] barriers.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; And let him be here with his family.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, he had a burden also
[46:38] because Chad is right near Ethiopia.
[46:41] And uh so brother Tim Dodd walked into
[46:45] my office one day not too long ago and
[46:47] he said, "What's what's going on with
[46:48] Ethiopia?" And I said, "Well, I don't
[46:50] know, but I'm hearing quite a bit about
[46:52] it." and he says, "Well," I said, "It's
[46:54] come up three times this last week for
[46:56] me." And uh so
[47:00] we were sharing it with brother
[47:02] Basaboosezi and he said, "Well,
[47:05] he said, "I haven't mentioned it to my
[47:07] bride yet cuz he wasn't married, but he
[47:09] said, I think I'd like to take my
[47:11] honeymoon up there."
[47:14] So, so he got married and took his honey
[47:17] took his wife, new wife to Ethiopia on a
[47:19] honeymoon trip and he just was preaching
[47:22] a house on fire. I tell you what, he
[47:25] stirred up the place, stirred up the
[47:27] people and he got he got a Pentecostal
[47:29] evangelist and he started gave him a few
[47:32] me just met him. So, he gave him a few
[47:34] messages and he said, you know, if that
[47:36] means anything to you and get back in
[47:38] touch with me. that evangelist came back
[47:41] 200 kilometers to see him said, "I've
[47:44] never heard such things as this." And
[47:46] that just started a real stir in his
[47:48] heart. Then he met a he met a lady and
[47:51] and he brother just said to me, he said,
[47:54] "If she was a man, she'd be a preacher."
[47:57] He said she just he said, "I've never
[47:59] met anyone that caught the revelation so
[48:01] clear as she caught it." And uh and so
[48:05] anyway, then he got an open door into a
[48:08] Lutheran church, maybe through her, I
[48:10] don't know, but he got in Lutheran
[48:12] church and he had two translators and I
[48:14] think it was this woman was translating
[48:16] into one language and the pastor was
[48:18] translating into another language and
[48:21] bus is preaching and of course he just
[48:22] comes right down on the message. He
[48:25] starts delivering the message and
[48:27] finally the Lutheran pastor said, "I
[48:30] can't I can't say that."
[48:33] So they had a bit of a discussion at the
[48:35] platform about what what should happen
[48:37] and I don't know exactly how it ended up
[48:39] but I can tell you one thing Ethiopia
[48:41] will never be the same.
[48:43] That's all I can tell you. So I sent him
[48:46] back. I said they gave many accusations
[48:48] against the Lord Jesus but they gave one
[48:50] that was correct and they said he stirth
[48:54] up the people.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He stirs up the He still
[48:58] stirs up the people.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he'd be praying for brother
[49:02] Busabosi. He he he just spoke in fact as
[49:05] they're streaming the service right now
[49:06] from Kenya and he spoke at a church in
[49:09] Kenya on his way home. God bless all
[49:12] these workers.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Let's have a word of prayer. Heavenly
[49:16] Father,
[49:18] we just sent such a lovely spirit and
[49:22] presence because we believe and know
[49:26] that you are here. You said you'd be
[49:29] here. you would you always keep your
[49:32] appointments. Your messenger told us you
[49:34] keep the appointments. And I pray,
[49:37] Father, that you will send a double
[49:40] portion of the Holy Spirit upon every
[49:43] hungry and waiting heart. And I am
[49:46] waiting. I am just so hungry for you. We
[49:49] love your presence, Lord. And we pray
[49:51] that you will bless the people in a very
[49:54] special way. May this be a a day that we
[49:57] will remember. I ask Father you'll take
[50:00] the word now and anoint us to receive
[50:04] and to speak in Jesus Christ's name.
[50:07] Amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I'm reading one scripture
[50:14] and it's found in 1 Thessalonians 4:16
[50:17] and then I'll have you have your seats
[50:19] but keep your Bibles please open and
[50:21] ready because we have quite a number of
[50:23] scriptures we'd like to refer to.
[50:35] 1 Thessalonians 4:16.
[50:44] For the Lord himself
[50:46] shall descend from heaven with a shout,
[50:51] with the voice of the archangel,
[50:53] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[50:56] in Christ shall rise first. This is a
[51:00] declaration of victory.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; The dead in Christ shall rise first. I'd
[51:06] like to read that again and put some
[51:08] emphasis
[51:09] uh on certain phrases. For the Lord
[51:13] himself
[51:15] shall descend from heaven.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; So that's the Lord himself shall descend
[51:20] from heaven. Notice please with a shout
[51:26] &gt;&gt; with the voice the archangel.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; The Lord isn't the archangel because he
[51:32] couldn't be a kinsman redeemer
[51:35] &gt;&gt; and be an angel.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; There was no angel that could fill that
[51:39] place. No angel could take the book of
[51:41] redemption. It is the Lord himself
[51:46] because it was God himself.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Out of the bosom of the father
[51:50] &gt;&gt; came the redeemer.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; He is he is that one. And and so it was
[51:57] no angel. Incidentally, this is the
[51:59] first time in the Bible that the word
[52:02] archangel appears. And it appears when
[52:07] there's a declaration for the dead in
[52:10] Christ shall rise. Just hold that
[52:13] please. You may have your seats.
[52:18] I'd ask for your absolute full attention
[52:21] and I'll do my best. I've I'm
[52:28] just don't know exactly what all God
[52:31] will have me to say and how far I shall
[52:33] go. But uh uh you'll give me some
[52:37] allowance and if you don't agree, well,
[52:40] that's fine. I mean, you just I'm not
[52:42] going to try to pound something home to
[52:44] you that you, you know, have difficult,
[52:46] but just open your heart and think about
[52:48] some of these things and you'll have to
[52:50] follow it very very closely.
[52:54] So now we have this scripture. The first
[52:57] time that an archangel appears in the
[53:00] Bible,
[53:02] Gabriel said he came from the presence
[53:04] of God, but didn't say he was an
[53:05] archangel. I believe he is. The prophet
[53:09] said he was, but he says now the first
[53:13] time that this is mentioned and he and
[53:16] the Lord himself is descending with a
[53:18] shout. That's not all all not in an
[53:21] instant or a flash or all in a moment a
[53:23] time. We do not know that. Uh and with
[53:27] the voice of the archangel
[53:30] and the trump of God and with the trump
[53:33] of God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[53:38] first. There's a mass victory
[53:42] in that death is conquered.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we want to just go back to the
[53:48] beginning.
[53:51] Our first parents,
[53:54] Adam and Eve, had eternal life.
[54:00] And at some point in time, we don't have
[54:02] a timeline and we don't need one. We
[54:04] just need what the Bible says. But at
[54:07] some point in time,
[54:11] uh, a fallen archangel,
[54:14] Lucifer,
[54:17] began to speak
[54:19] to the wife
[54:22] and uh, begin to speak to her and and
[54:28] sew a seed of unbelief.
[54:32] He found a voice by you the utilization
[54:36] of the serpent, a created being. And he
[54:39] was a created being. He was the one
[54:42] right next to God. And now he comes to
[54:44] the one that's right next to man.
[54:47] And he takes control of him. And this
[54:51] now this battle which had taken place in
[54:54] heaven says Michael and his angels
[54:58] fought against Lucifer and his angels
[55:01] and overcame him and cast him and he was
[55:04] cast out of heaven and now they have
[55:07] come to the earth and have come to Eden
[55:10] in the earth. They've come to Eden and
[55:14] so now as the prophet said the battle uh
[55:17] of angels fell upon humans. And now we
[55:21] are seeing the first encounter
[55:24] of a fallen archangel
[55:27] beginning to bring the attack and the
[55:30] battle upon humans
[55:34] and as a result of that death came and
[55:38] he was the author of death.
[55:41] He is the tree of death.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; The tree of knowledge was the tree of
[55:46] death.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the more knowledge we get, the
[55:49] more death we encounter.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; True.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And so
[55:57] this is the conversation with our first
[55:59] parents who had eternal life
[56:04] and was given the tree of life to eat
[56:06] from.
[56:08] And they're visited by
[56:10] uh this serpent who has the voice
[56:17] and is the instrument through the voice
[56:19] for the voice of a fallen archangel.
[56:23] Have we followed thus far?
[56:26] And here is the conversation in brief.
[56:33] Genesis 3:1. You won't have to look.
[56:35] Just listen.
[56:37] And the serpent was more subtle than any
[56:40] beast of the field. And he said,
[56:42] &gt;&gt; this is abbreviated now. And he said to
[56:45] the woman, "Hath God said?"
[56:51] And the woman said unto the serpent, "We
[56:55] may eat of every tree of the garden of
[56:58] the trees of the garden." And the
[56:59] serpent said
[57:02] unto the woman, "You shall not surely
[57:05] die."
[57:08] That's why
[57:10] the Apostle Paul, the first church age
[57:13] messenger,
[57:14] &gt;&gt; had to establish
[57:16] &gt;&gt; the Lord himself,
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[57:18] &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven with a shout
[57:21] &gt;&gt; and with a voice and with a trump of
[57:24] God, and the dead in Christ shall rise.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; And they heard the voice, verse 8, and
[57:37] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[57:40] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[57:42] day.
[57:45] I'm going to speak to you on the voice
[57:48] of the archangel
[57:50] as a title and a subject is turning over
[57:54] every stone.
[57:57] We've had many people here and I have
[57:59] not I don't believe I've said it
[58:00] publicly but when we've had people come
[58:04] for prayer that have serious
[58:08] situations
[58:09] very serious in the last few days I used
[58:12] it I even sent it overseas
[58:16] because we've been praying for sister
[58:18] Lady Koulen Brunner in Switzerland and
[58:22] she is a wife of brother Daniel who is
[58:26] one of the main brothers. He works with
[58:29] brother David Mayor in getting the
[58:33] conventions together over there and
[58:35] they've had the burden and the vision
[58:37] for it and his wife young wife they have
[58:40] one child and she has come down with uh
[58:44] and has been attacked over a period of
[58:46] time over a period of actually a few
[58:48] years but she came with such
[58:50] excruciating pain they thought it was in
[58:53] her back and so on they're not and the
[58:55] doctors can't find out what's wrong but
[58:57] she was actually losing body mass and
[58:59] could hardly walk in the last few days.
[59:02] And uh different ones entered into
[59:05] prayer as we did as well. I heard this
[59:07] morning that she uh the pain had
[59:10] subsided and we're thankful for that.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; But uh but what I I I sent a message to
[59:18] them whenever I have a serious situation
[59:21] or one myself which I have I take the
[59:25] message be certain of God. Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says in there, and
[59:30] I'll give the quote a little later on,
[59:33] he said that how many times that he
[59:36] himself
[59:37] &gt;&gt; has turned over every stone.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And when you have turned over every
[59:42] stone and gone over and and then if
[59:45] something is you find something that is
[59:47] you're questioning, it may not be
[59:49] exactly right. He said, then he would
[59:51] repent over it and and make it right and
[59:54] whatever more. He says, "And then if God
[59:56] still remains silent,
[59:58] then you have to be certain of God."
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And so now in this account that we have
[1:00:05] here, I hope you're able to follow with
[1:00:07] me. Now we have the first sin taking
[1:00:12] place. And now we have the turning over
[1:00:15] every stone. And God is prompting it.
[1:00:19] And the Lord God called unto Adam and
[1:00:21] said unto him, "Where are you?
[1:00:25] And he said, "I heard I heard thy voice
[1:00:28] in the garden and I was afraid because I
[1:00:31] was naked and I hid myself."
[1:00:35] And he said, "God speaking, who told you
[1:00:38] you were naked?"
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; He wasn't naked,
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; but they I when I Excuse me. He was
[1:00:51] naked, but he was veiled. They were
[1:00:53] veiled. You understand? And that's what
[1:00:56] he want to know. Who told you that?
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; That you were naked.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; And uh and uh and he said, "Have you
[1:01:03] eaten of the tree? Have you partaken of
[1:01:06] this?" And the man said, "Well, the
[1:01:08] woman gave it to me." They're turning
[1:01:10] over every stone. The woman gave me it
[1:01:13] and uh
[1:01:16] and gave me the tree, and I did eat. And
[1:01:17] the Lord God said unto the woman, "What
[1:01:20] is this that thou hast done? It's not
[1:01:23] ever, you know, what you thought.
[1:01:26] What is this that thou has done?" And
[1:01:28] the woman said, "The serpent beguiled
[1:01:30] me." And I did eat. And so that's how
[1:01:34] they began to turn every stone to find
[1:01:36] out where the source of things were,
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; where the problem is. Brother Brandham
[1:01:42] said when people came up before him, he
[1:01:45] said, "Now if you have any sin,"
[1:01:48] he said, "don't don't come if you have
[1:01:50] any sin you're hiding because because
[1:01:53] this will uncover it.
[1:01:58] Satan came to Eve and began to reason
[1:02:01] against the word of God." That's one
[1:02:03] statement brother Brandham makes. He
[1:02:06] said again, "Satan told Eve enough to be
[1:02:09] deceitful.
[1:02:10] He told her the truth, but not all the
[1:02:13] truth
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; in true vine and false vine. He said the
[1:02:18] biggest lie that was ever told is one
[1:02:21] that's got a whole lot of truth in it.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Now, the biggest lie was ever told was
[1:02:27] what Satan told Eve
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; in the way of a true prophet. He said
[1:02:33] Eve began to reason and Satan said like
[1:02:37] this. Now
[1:02:39] he's going back in the conversation. Now
[1:02:41] he said, "Now you don't you don't know
[1:02:45] because you haven't had any schooling
[1:02:48] yet. I'm a professor of the seminary
[1:02:51] over here."
[1:02:52] And I tell you, we've learned some
[1:02:55] things out there. We've learned that God
[1:02:58] is so good.
[1:03:00] We've learned in our seminary that God
[1:03:02] is so good. He doesn't expect you to do
[1:03:05] all that he wrote here. He doesn't
[1:03:08] expect that.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; And then in 27, Genesis 2:7 says, "For
[1:03:16] in the day that thou eateest thereof,"
[1:03:19] this is what God had told them, "for in
[1:03:21] the day that thou eateest thereof, thou
[1:03:23] shalt surely die."
[1:03:26] And now we take a step. For the Lord
[1:03:28] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:03:31] shout, with a voice of the archangel,
[1:03:34] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[1:03:37] in Christ shall rise.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; No, I've just given you this for a bit
[1:03:43] of a a bit of a basis
[1:03:46] in the rapture message. And you must
[1:03:48] remember the rapture message is right
[1:03:50] now at the end of 33 years of ministry.
[1:03:54] Getting a people, calling out a people.
[1:03:56] Do you believe that that was sent to
[1:03:57] call out a people
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; now? He's telling a group. He's telling
[1:04:00] that group of people which I believe
[1:04:03] that we are part of that.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; And in the rapture message, this is the
[1:04:09] first time that he takes it just like
[1:04:11] this. He said three things happens. A
[1:04:14] shout, a voice, a trumpet has to happen
[1:04:19] before Jesus notice now before Jesus
[1:04:22] appears.
[1:04:27] And he said Jesus does all three of them
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; when he's descending.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; So I just want to say amen to all of
[1:04:36] those things.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; You don't have to figure it out, but
[1:04:39] just say amen to it.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; A shout. He said, what is a shout? It's
[1:04:44] a message going forth. That's the shout.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Already happened.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:52] He said
[1:04:54] uh the shout it's a message going forth
[1:04:58] first the living bread of life bringing
[1:05:01] forth the bride that will produce a
[1:05:04] people.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Now brother Brandham could have said
[1:05:08] that maybe nothing would have happened.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; There'd be no call. There'd be no people
[1:05:13] come out. There'd be no people that
[1:05:15] would be gripped
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; as as the believers. I'm talking about
[1:05:20] believers of the message.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about some of this limp
[1:05:25] nonsense that goes on. I'm talking about
[1:05:27] people that are fervent committed.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; And it has done something for them.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; And even though even though they might
[1:05:36] at some time say this is too hard, we
[1:05:38] just heard of the song of the breaking.
[1:05:40] Sometime you think I can't go any
[1:05:42] further, but you do.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; I can't bear another thing. But you do.
[1:05:49] I ought to just give this up. But you
[1:05:51] can't.
[1:05:53] [Applause]
[1:05:54] [Music]
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; For thou hast the words of eternal life.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Where would a person go?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And even when everything fell apart for
[1:06:08] the disciples, everything fell apart for
[1:06:10] the disciples. Their leader was gone.
[1:06:12] The leader was dead. He was in a tomb.
[1:06:14] uh the great apostles that were with
[1:06:17] them and participated in the miracles,
[1:06:19] they were all hiding and secretary of
[1:06:22] the church had committed suicide and
[1:06:25] everything. The whole country was just
[1:06:28] uh while there were mobs that were
[1:06:30] coming for healing, now there's mobs
[1:06:32] that are crying for his blood and his
[1:06:34] death. And you couldn't find a more
[1:06:36] dismal situation than that. But he said,
[1:06:40] could they go back to their old
[1:06:42] synagogue and the old formal thing and
[1:06:44] the old dead thing? They couldn't go
[1:06:45] back. There's no place to go.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; I would ask you, where will you go?
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Where would you go? Jesus even invited
[1:06:56] them to go.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; He even said to his leaders, "Will you
[1:07:00] leave?
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Where will you go, Brother
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; John? Brother Tom, where where will you
[1:07:06] go?
[1:07:08] Where we go?
[1:07:09] can't go from where we come out of.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; So he said so the and the second is a
[1:07:18] voice of the resurrection. He comes with
[1:07:21] a shout
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; and with a voice and with a trumpet
[1:07:26] doesn't say that he is the voice even
[1:07:28] though that he is. You have to
[1:07:30] understand what I'm saying. He's more
[1:07:32] than just the voice.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; He's also the resurrection. Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the resurrection." But
[1:07:39] kind of how do you relate that he he's a
[1:07:41] person
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; at that point? He's a person.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; And we know that he's actually God. He
[1:07:47] came out from God. God can be whatever
[1:07:50] form he desires to present himself in.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; So the second is the voice of the
[1:07:58] resurrection. the same voice and I've
[1:08:02] spoken over many many months now and God
[1:08:06] said some of the first verse first three
[1:08:09] verses in the Bible and God said what
[1:08:12] did he say
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; what did anybody hear
[1:08:17] and people today trying to sort out you
[1:08:19] know this little technicality and that
[1:08:22] little you'll never figure God out the
[1:08:24] further you go the more ignorant you
[1:08:26] show yourself as being
[1:08:28] a little teaspoon of ashes up here
[1:08:30] trying to figure out these things.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; This is eternal God.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; If God wants to, he could just have
[1:08:39] another universe. And maybe he has. I
[1:08:41] don't know.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Who are we?
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Who are we? Little specks on a little
[1:08:47] globe. It's even a marvel that God even
[1:08:51] found us in this great expansive
[1:08:53] universe of his creation. But not only
[1:08:56] did he find us, this was the place he
[1:08:57] selected as a a womb for his seed. And
[1:09:01] that's why Satan came here because this
[1:09:03] was the this was the uh result of the
[1:09:06] spoken word. He's always lusted and
[1:09:08] hungered after that spoken word.
[1:09:10] Wherever that spoken word is, that's
[1:09:12] where you'll find him.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And so the second thing is the voice of
[1:09:21] the resurrection. the same voice
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; uh the loud voice that called Lazarus
[1:09:27] from the grave.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Same voice.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; And the third, he says, "Now the third
[1:09:36] is the trumpet, which always is the
[1:09:38] feast of the trumpets is calling the
[1:09:40] people to the feast. And that'll be the
[1:09:43] bride's supper, the lamb's supper with
[1:09:46] the bride in the sky."
[1:09:48] The first thing comes forth is this
[1:09:50] message calling the bride together. I
[1:09:53] say hallelujah.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you folks, but I'm on
[1:09:57] my way to a supper.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; You're on your way to a supper.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; You're not just here to attend church.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; We're on our way out of here.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; This world is a a chaotic mess. Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And so the first thing comes forth is a
[1:10:18] message calling the bride together. The
[1:10:20] next is a resurrection. The sleeping of
[1:10:22] the sleeping bride, the ones died back
[1:10:25] in other ages and they're caught
[1:10:27] together and the trumpet, the feast of
[1:10:29] in the heavens in the sky. Why? Uh
[1:10:32] that's the thing that takes place,
[1:10:34] friends. Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Just a maybe four or five more, six
[1:10:41] hours for him to speak and then his lips
[1:10:44] will be sealed.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; So the message is turning over every
[1:10:50] stone in Satan's Eden.
[1:10:54] God himself came down with his voice in
[1:10:58] his Eden and turned over every stone
[1:11:00] until he traced it down and find out
[1:11:03] who's responsible for this.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Are you responsible, Adam? Well, woman,
[1:11:09] you gave me, she gave it to me. Are are
[1:11:11] you responsible that serpent gave it to
[1:11:13] me? Okay.
[1:11:17] Does God just drop it there? No. Then he
[1:11:18] goes to the serpent. So he said, "Oh,
[1:11:20] you're the respon responsible."
[1:11:23] And then he prophesies.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; I'll put enmity between you and the
[1:11:29] woman and between your seed and the
[1:11:32] woman's seed. Anybody that discusses
[1:11:35] serpent seed to you, just take him to
[1:11:36] that scripture and say, "When you tell
[1:11:38] me what that is, then I'll I can talk to
[1:11:40] you further." Not until then. And this
[1:11:43] is God Almighty himself talking to the
[1:11:45] serpent,
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; which he's not talking to a snake in a
[1:11:48] tree.
[1:11:50] Come on, folks.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; He's talking to an intelligent being
[1:11:55] that even knew his word. Did God say
[1:11:57] this?
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; The one that knew enough to question it
[1:12:00] and sew a seed of doubt. And so now in
[1:12:03] the in this time, in this end time, I'm
[1:12:06] I'm making statements going to you're
[1:12:08] going to have to think about it. This
[1:12:10] message
[1:12:12] really is uh turning over every stone in
[1:12:17] Satan's Aiden.
[1:12:20] Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; You see this great degradation taking
[1:12:24] place and immorality taking place
[1:12:26] through the voice
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; coming and asking the question and being
[1:12:31] direct in this time. Where'd that come
[1:12:34] from?
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; And they turn it over and turn another
[1:12:37] one over. Well, I got it here. This what
[1:12:39] my this is what my preacher says. This
[1:12:41] is what the priest says. This is what
[1:12:44] someone else says. You have a prophet
[1:12:46] come says it come right out of where
[1:12:48] they got taught.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; There are seminaries
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; and all of that theology
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; and all this ecumenical movement
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; and all this uniting together is only
[1:13:03] depicting the weaknesses. And you can't
[1:13:05] take a whole bunch of weaknesses
[1:13:07] together and make a strength.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; It only gets more weak,
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; more evil. And the scripture says, "And
[1:13:16] things shall wax worse and worse."
[1:13:19] [Applause]
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Is this all right, friends?
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; So
[1:13:29] I had to think about this. So obviously
[1:13:31] you will.
[1:13:33] So when the Michael when the war that
[1:13:37] took place in heaven and and uh Lucifer
[1:13:40] is cast out,
[1:13:43] I've been pondering this.
[1:13:46] I said, and I have it here in my notes,
[1:13:49] Lucifer's office was left vacant.
[1:13:55] He's not there anymore,
[1:13:58] but he's here.
[1:14:01] So he lost his position, but he didn't
[1:14:04] lose his power to deceive
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; because he carried on with that right
[1:14:09] away.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; His his his fallen nature or whatever.
[1:14:13] And I cannot explain all those things,
[1:14:15] but he set about to what what he was
[1:14:18] doing what he was doing and the battle
[1:14:19] he was doing there and deceiving angels
[1:14:21] and and bringing them down and casting
[1:14:24] them them following him or them being
[1:14:27] cast out with him. Then he com he
[1:14:30] continues with this same program.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; And he's been quite successful
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; not some little wimp
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; and people make a make some joke, you
[1:14:46] know, with a fork and a and cloven hoofs
[1:14:49] and a tail. Forget it.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; He has permeated every area.
[1:15:00] of your life.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; You got money in your pocket. He's in
[1:15:06] the economy.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; He's in the industry. He's in the
[1:15:15] economics.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; You have an ID card in your pocket. He's
[1:15:20] in the politics.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; We all have to have education.
[1:15:28] And he's in that system.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; And you may be quiet now, but you'll
[1:15:34] probably get quieter before I'm done.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; You're the one that's going to have to
[1:15:40] have a sword, a word that can divide
[1:15:43] between.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Between the word. For the word of God is
[1:15:51] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:15:53] two-edged sword, piercing even to the
[1:15:56] dividing of sunder of the joints and
[1:15:58] marrow and of the uh of the soul and the
[1:16:01] spirit.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; So many times we said not the body and
[1:16:04] the spirit, but the soul and the spirit.
[1:16:08] Your soul was made to receive the
[1:16:11] engrafted word of God.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; But the system that's out here wants to
[1:16:16] permeate and wants to uh wants to
[1:16:18] homogenize
[1:16:20] your life until you can't find that
[1:16:22] dividing line. But listen now, I'm going
[1:16:24] to make a statement. Only believers of
[1:16:27] the revealed word of God know where that
[1:16:29] line is.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; And they've got a six sense that tells
[1:16:34] them thus far, no further.
[1:16:38] I will use you, but you will not use me.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; I am in the world, but I'm not of the
[1:16:45] world.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; I'm here. I'm getting an education. I'm
[1:16:48] getting a living. I'm working. I've I'm
[1:16:51] I'm in business. I'm in this. I'm in
[1:16:53] that. But I will remain by the Holy
[1:16:56] Spirit the master of my life, of my
[1:16:59] home, of my children. Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; How many years ago
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; the school system right here in this in
[1:17:08] this area sent word that that uh my
[1:17:12] daughters had to participate in dancing
[1:17:15] because they have now made dancing part
[1:17:17] of the curriculum and they sent word
[1:17:20] because they knew that my position on
[1:17:22] it. They sent word and said and this
[1:17:25] will form part of their um part of their
[1:17:28] marks.
[1:17:31] So if they're not in it, they're not
[1:17:32] going to get the marks.
[1:17:34] And I said, I I wrote a letter. I sent
[1:17:37] it to teachers. I sent it to the
[1:17:38] inspector. And I sent it to about eight
[1:17:41] ministers in this area. Not one minister
[1:17:44] wrote back.
[1:17:46] And I said,
[1:17:48] finally, I was exasperated. I said, who
[1:17:51] is playing the music for the dance? The
[1:17:54] Pentecostal pastor's children.
[1:17:57] because he didn't want them
[1:17:59] participating, but they were playing the
[1:18:00] music
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; at the music. I'm not degrading him. I'm
[1:18:04] just saying that's what was happening.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; And so I said, I wrote a very stern
[1:18:10] letter and I said, you are responsible
[1:18:13] to teach my children
[1:18:16] what they need to know with regards to
[1:18:19] the basics of human life, reading and
[1:18:22] the writing and the arithmetic.
[1:18:24] But I and my wife are responsible for
[1:18:27] their social life and we will keep that
[1:18:30] to ourselves.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; You have nothing to do with their social
[1:18:34] life.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; And so they simply told the teacher, we
[1:18:39] can't participate.
[1:18:41] And so the teacher said, "There are
[1:18:44] those of you that are cannot participate
[1:18:47] and so you can go and and and bounce a
[1:18:50] volleyball or something up on the plat
[1:18:52] on on the stage and the rest of them in
[1:18:54] the gym were going to do this." Well,
[1:18:56] guess what? A whole bunch of the young
[1:18:58] guys, all the young fellas, they all
[1:19:00] went up there. They would sooner bounce
[1:19:01] the ball and do all this stupid dancing
[1:19:04] stuff. And he said, and and the and the
[1:19:06] instructor teacher said, "No, no, no."
[1:19:08] He says, "Come on back." He says, "I
[1:19:09] know that you can." No, they didn't want
[1:19:12] to. The whole thing, the whole thing
[1:19:14] absolutely collapsed in three weeks. It
[1:19:16] was all over. I say, listen, friends,
[1:19:20] God God knows where the line is. You
[1:19:23] know where the line is. You've got
[1:19:24] something within you that witnesses
[1:19:26] that. We need to listen to that voice.
[1:19:28] Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; So in Acts, I said now the the
[1:19:36] archangel's office of Lucifer apparently
[1:19:39] was left vacant. Uh but he carried on
[1:19:42] with his thing. Listen to this. In Acts,
[1:19:45] there's another one whose office was
[1:19:47] left vacant and his name was Judas.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; And this is what happened there.
[1:19:53] That he may take part of this ministry.
[1:19:56] So they're selecting another person or
[1:19:58] drawing lots. The the apostles are that
[1:20:01] he may take part of this ministry and
[1:20:03] apostilhip from which Judas by
[1:20:05] transgression fell.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; So did so did Lucifer fall
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; by transgression and which Judas by
[1:20:14] transgression fell that he might go to
[1:20:17] his own place. And they gave forth their
[1:20:20] lots and the lot fell to Mattheus and he
[1:20:23] was numbered with the 11 apostles. And
[1:20:25] we know that the prophet comes in this
[1:20:27] day and says that was their choice. But
[1:20:30] God's choice was Apostle Paul.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; And Matthews didn't write the
[1:20:36] scriptures, but Apostle Paul wrote most
[1:20:38] of the New Testament.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And the Bible speaks in Jude and says,
[1:20:45] "Yet Michael the Archangel," and that's
[1:20:47] only the second time in the Bible that
[1:20:48] the word appears. at Michael the
[1:20:51] archangel when contending with the devil
[1:20:53] he disputed about the body of Moses and
[1:20:56] durst not bring against him a railing
[1:20:59] accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; and uh in the revelation series they
[1:21:06] said the voice that summoned John to
[1:21:09] come up
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; the same voice that said to John come up
[1:21:13] is the same voice that summons the
[1:21:15] church someday summons the church come
[1:21:18] up.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Also, the same voice that summoned John
[1:21:22] to come up is the same voice that
[1:21:24] summoned the dead Lazarus out of the
[1:21:26] grave. The same voice of the archangel.
[1:21:29] Jesus of Nazarus isn't going to stand
[1:21:31] here and say, "Let all the dead in
[1:21:33] Christ rise." It's a voice. It's a It's
[1:21:36] It's a voice that God sends. And then
[1:21:38] there comes a junction of time
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; where where the word that's been spoken
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; and it's been declared. God doesn't have
[1:21:47] to come back and say it or make a sound
[1:21:49] again. It's already been spoken.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; The thus sayeth the Lord has been spoken
[1:21:57] and he descends. He descends with a
[1:22:00] shout.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; And the shout it wasn't him in the
[1:22:04] skies. It was a It was a messenger, an
[1:22:06] angel on earth
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; that was speaking the word and saying,
[1:22:11] "Thus sayaith the Lord."
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; There's a pillar of fire between I and
[1:22:17] the person,
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; and I'm speaking through that pillar of
[1:22:20] fire. I tell you what, friends, there
[1:22:22] isn't another living person that's had
[1:22:24] that kind of indication.
[1:22:27] [Applause]
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; I say, thanks be to God,
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; we have that kind of indication.
[1:22:36] Aren't you happy for that?
[1:22:39] [Applause]
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; The same kind of voice that summoned
[1:22:48] Lazarus out of the grave and the same
[1:22:49] voice of the archangel.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Christ is the voice of the archangel.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Christ is the voice of the archangel.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Voice of the archangel. He says, "Oh,
[1:23:04] the trumpet voice of Christ summoned
[1:23:07] John to come up and the same voice
[1:23:10] summoned Lazarus."
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks in Jeremiah. Now, ju
[1:23:17] just to digress for a moment, but we'll
[1:23:19] follow along on exactly the same.
[1:23:22] And it said through Jeremiah 29:10, he
[1:23:26] said, "For thus sayith the Lord, that
[1:23:27] after 70 years be accomplished at
[1:23:30] Babylon, I will visit you and perform my
[1:23:33] good word toward you in causing you to
[1:23:37] return to this place. For I know the
[1:23:40] thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth
[1:23:42] the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of
[1:23:46] evil,
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; to give you an expected end." And then
[1:23:51] then shall you call upon me,
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; and you shall go and pray unto me, and I
[1:23:57] will hearken unto you. Isn't that
[1:23:59] incredible? And you shall pray unto me,
[1:24:02] and I will hearken unto you, and you
[1:24:05] shall seek me and find me when you shall
[1:24:09] search with me for me with all of your
[1:24:12] heart. And that is the very words that
[1:24:16] gave rise to this entire message.
[1:24:19] I wanted to know who is God searching
[1:24:21] for
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; and who are we and what are we searching
[1:24:24] for and I thought of you young people
[1:24:26] and the graduation and and uh now more
[1:24:30] responsibility falling upon your life
[1:24:32] what what what uh profession or what
[1:24:36] direction should I go uh where am I
[1:24:40] headed and you've got decisions and
[1:24:42] weighty things upon your mind
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; and some of you are even now searching
[1:24:48] And I want to admonish all that hear me
[1:24:52] within the congregation and now all that
[1:24:54] are streaming and will ever hear. We
[1:24:57] need to go on a massive search
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; to search out everything that God has
[1:25:03] spoken about our eternal home
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; and our eternal life.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; We need to search that much more than
[1:25:10] what we're searching just for our
[1:25:11] natural things.
[1:25:14] how we how we put so much effort
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; in seeking out every last thing of a
[1:25:19] human life. But we need to search out
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; these spiritual things.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; I have been uh I've been blessed lately
[1:25:28] because
[1:25:30] I've been in the message for so many
[1:25:32] years and in the scriptures and when I
[1:25:35] sit down and study it just comes from so
[1:25:38] many directions because I've become
[1:25:40] familiar with it. And you might say,
[1:25:41] "Well, they you're a minister." Anybody
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; can become I've talked to women and all
[1:25:47] they've done, they've just heard the
[1:25:49] messages and heard the tapes and and
[1:25:51] they just uh they just open their mouth
[1:25:53] and it just comes out from every
[1:25:55] direction. I've always admired that.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; And I think that's wonderful.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; And we need to seek out
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; the little things that God has said
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; and my prophet calls them nuggets.
[1:26:09] Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; I read of a man. I heard of him at first
[1:26:14] on the news and I looked it up a wee bit
[1:26:17] the other day. A man his by the name of
[1:26:19] Forest Fan.
[1:26:22] He was dying with cancer. This is very
[1:26:24] recently.
[1:26:26] He was dying with cancer and decided to
[1:26:28] hide a fortune.
[1:26:30] It's in excess of million dollars. some
[1:26:32] things that may be two million
[1:26:35] in gold and treasures
[1:26:38] in the mountains just out of Santa Fe,
[1:26:41] New Mexico.
[1:26:43] And he's announced it all over. It's
[1:26:45] been on CNN and everywhere.
[1:26:48] And uh and then he wrote a book.
[1:26:52] He wrote a book with the clues
[1:26:55] of where it is.
[1:26:58] Everybody wants that book.
[1:27:04] And they're not just reading like a
[1:27:05] newspaper. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No,
[1:27:08] they're not reading like a newspaper.
[1:27:10] They're searching every possible word.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; I was talking to brother Mark Matul. He
[1:27:19] won't mind me mentioning his name. And
[1:27:23] they're streaming the service this
[1:27:24] morning because we're out of the camp
[1:27:26] actually. So we say, "God bless you,
[1:27:28] brother Mark, and for telling me this."
[1:27:31] He didn't know that I might use this,
[1:27:34] but he said that we were talking about a
[1:27:37] certain situation, a certain thing. He
[1:27:40] said that he had done he had taken
[1:27:42] because, you know, he's been in the
[1:27:43] police force. He said we were
[1:27:47] I took a course. He said a very intense
[1:27:50] course.
[1:27:51] and he said this course was actually
[1:27:53] written by a man from a Jewish
[1:27:56] background and he's a he's an absolute
[1:28:00] considered I think like a world
[1:28:02] authority on interrogation
[1:28:06] and he said this man said and brother
[1:28:10] brother brother Mark was so locked into
[1:28:12] what this man had said and so on so
[1:28:14] forth I think he probably didn't weren't
[1:28:16] catching right at then at that moment
[1:28:18] that that was almost word for word what
[1:28:21] Brother Brandham said at the beginning,
[1:28:23] he said, "This man has said man was not
[1:28:26] made to lie."
[1:28:29] And he said because he's not constructed
[1:28:32] to lie. Brother Brandham said, "Man was
[1:28:34] not made to lie." And he says the lie
[1:28:37] detection equipment, a lie detector
[1:28:41] will prove that because you can have and
[1:28:44] you can get your alibi absolutely
[1:28:47] flawless and you can speak with such
[1:28:50] confidence. But that that vibration will
[1:28:54] show there. It will show that you're not
[1:28:57] speaking the truth when you answer a
[1:28:59] certain question. This man had a just a
[1:29:02] little different. He said man was not
[1:29:04] made to lie. And he says and that will
[1:29:07] show up. He said it it comes down and
[1:29:10] registers and out of his mouth comes the
[1:29:12] words and it comes into the vocabulary
[1:29:16] and and at a certain point in
[1:29:18] interrogation. He will give a clue and
[1:29:21] it's up to the interrogator to find out
[1:29:25] what word was used that actually was the
[1:29:28] key to the deception.
[1:29:33] And uh that wasn't the end of the story.
[1:29:37] He apparently got a message. Brother
[1:29:41] brother Mark was taking this course and
[1:29:45] he took a certain instance, a certain
[1:29:47] happening that took place
[1:29:52] and he said he he he put that in a in a
[1:29:55] section by itself. And he said, "This is
[1:29:58] an account
[1:30:00] of of of this whole program on a certain
[1:30:04] case. And if you can determine there's
[1:30:07] one word in here that is the key to the
[1:30:14] deception and shows that it was not
[1:30:17] correct." And he said, "If you can find
[1:30:20] it, I will give you a very special
[1:30:22] gift."
[1:30:24] And brother Mark said that he I said,
[1:30:26] 'Well, what happened?' He said, 'Well, I
[1:30:28] I just poured over it and I studied it.
[1:30:31] He says, ' And I found the word.
[1:30:34] You did? I He said, "Yeah, I found the
[1:30:37] word." And I went back to him. I said,
[1:30:39] he said, "I I found the word. I'm sure I
[1:30:42] found the word." And the word was and a
[1:30:46] N d.
[1:30:48] And they connected two things. He
[1:30:50] connected two things together and it
[1:30:52] didn't quite register.
[1:30:55] And so he said to this professor or this
[1:30:58] instructor, he said, "The word and."
[1:31:01] He said, "You're correct. That is the
[1:31:04] word."
[1:31:05] He says, "Well, what kind of a prize do
[1:31:08] I get?" And he gave him a a large
[1:31:10] postcard
[1:31:12] about like this. He didn't know I was
[1:31:14] going to say all this, and I didn't
[1:31:16] expect to say it all either, but I gave
[1:31:17] him a large postcard. And on the
[1:31:19] postcard is a drawing of a a room. All a
[1:31:22] drawing. He said, "A few years ago,"
[1:31:26] this man said, "A few years ago, a
[1:31:29] Soviet
[1:31:30] uh Russian jet pilot flew one of their
[1:31:34] latest jets into Iran."
[1:31:37] And how many have heard about it? Yeah,
[1:31:40] I see. I heard about it. and he said he
[1:31:44] flew it into Iran and uh I think maybe
[1:31:47] sought asylum or whatever more I don't
[1:31:49] know but the whole thing I remember it
[1:31:52] it was a huge international kurfuffle
[1:31:55] and I didn't know what the result of it
[1:31:58] was but the result was I think that the
[1:32:00] US allowed them to take the pilot back
[1:32:04] and maybe kept the plane I do not know
[1:32:07] but I know this that he they
[1:32:09] interrogated him in a KGB B
[1:32:13] interrogation room. And he said while he
[1:32:16] was being interrogated, he drew the
[1:32:19] room. And he said, "This is the first
[1:32:22] picture of the inside of a KGB
[1:32:26] investigation room where he was being
[1:32:28] interrogated." He says, "I'm giving it
[1:32:31] to you."
[1:32:32] So, so he got that that is his prize.
[1:32:35] But I thought of this uh Mr. fan. Do you
[1:32:38] do you mind me taking being myself a
[1:32:42] little bit?
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; I thought of this Mr. Fan here. And so
[1:32:45] he wrote a book of his memoirs.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; And the key to where the treasure was
[1:32:55] was in there. Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; And they haven't found it yet, but
[1:32:59] they're scouring and all kinds of people
[1:33:02] are going trying to find this uh
[1:33:05] treasure of a million dollars. Can you
[1:33:07] imagine what they're going to? And
[1:33:10] people that go out in the ocean and
[1:33:12] track and measure things and try to find
[1:33:15] the location of old wrecks so they can
[1:33:17] find some sunken treasure.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; We have hidden treasure.
[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:26] If there was a drugstore, the prophet
[1:33:28] said, if there's a pharmacy down the
[1:33:30] street that said, "We have an injection
[1:33:33] that will give you eternal life."
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's enough ignorant
[1:33:37] people that would line up.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Thinking it might be, what do you got to
[1:33:42] lose?
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; And it'll be people. And now God in his
[1:33:50] extended mercy, listen to me folks, God
[1:33:54] in his mercy and extended grace said,
[1:33:58] "I'll do it again. I'll do exactly what
[1:34:01] was happened in the life of Jesus
[1:34:03] Christ. I'll do it again. I'll do it.
[1:34:06] It'll it'll follow the same pattern.
[1:34:09] I'll take a man that has no history of
[1:34:12] education. I'll take a man out of
[1:34:14] poverty. I'll take a man that you never
[1:34:17] heard about
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; and I'll just begin to endow him with
[1:34:21] supernatural power and wisdom of things
[1:34:25] and he'll speak about the heavens and
[1:34:27] speak about and speak to the storm and
[1:34:29] and cause the sea to become quiet and
[1:34:32] all these things you have that I told
[1:34:35] you
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; a few weeks ago
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; holding it in my heart for 50 I told you
[1:34:41] I saw a storm in four days in that storm
[1:34:45] stom four days locked in the tent.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Four days of just saturated and and and
[1:34:53] God dealt with it. And the prophet said,
[1:34:55] "It's over."
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; I would not be behind this pulpit this
[1:35:00] morning
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; if that wasn't over.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's over and we'll ride out
[1:35:06] of here dry."
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm here as a testimony today to say
[1:35:10] that happened
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; in my lifetime.
[1:35:14] And I saw the sky turn absolutely blue.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; I took off my rainwear. I took off my
[1:35:20] other garments and rode out in my shirt
[1:35:23] sleeves because it was actually hot.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Friends, I tell you what, God has gone
[1:35:31] beyond measure
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; to confirm to us
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; this is the hour.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; There's never been a day like this day.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; And Mr. Finn afterwards found himself
[1:35:47] cancer free.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; But he didn't take it all back. But he
[1:35:54] wrote his memoirs and said it's there.
[1:35:56] And we have we have we have not only
[1:35:59] God's memoirs, but we've got God's word.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; There's two aspects to a search.
[1:36:07] And uh in Jeremiah which I read, he
[1:36:10] said, "And you shall seek me,
[1:36:12] and you'll find me when you seek for me
[1:36:16] with all of your heart."
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And that search is to to seek with care.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; This is not listening to a tape for
[1:36:25] background music.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; That's why I've always been against
[1:36:29] that. I think we ought to listen to it
[1:36:31] prayerfully.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; We ought to read the word and put
[1:36:35] ourselves in the scripture. Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; I would urge you to do that.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a search.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; It shouldn't be this quiet.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Search
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; to inquire.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; And also, if you're searching, if you
[1:36:51] lost something, one thing that you'll
[1:36:53] do, you'll go back over the same ground,
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; the same territory,
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; and you'll frequent it again and again.
[1:37:03] You see the law enforcement and the
[1:37:06] police department when there's been some
[1:37:08] heinous heinous crime, they go back and
[1:37:11] forth. They pour over and they'll pick
[1:37:14] up the least little clue.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; And the prophet starts speaking about
[1:37:20] son of man, son of David, son of God.
[1:37:24] And you know what he calls it? These
[1:37:26] nuggets.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; I wonder if you found out it was a
[1:37:29] nugget. Yeah.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; And some people look at something, they
[1:37:32] don't realize what's worth.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; They don't realize it.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; You may not even realize the value of
[1:37:38] this message.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; You may not realize the value of the
[1:37:42] quotes that I'm coming to or the
[1:37:44] scripture or the or the continuity of
[1:37:47] them.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; So, we search it and we seek God in
[1:37:55] prayer. We practice and study it. and
[1:38:00] seek God also with application. It's not
[1:38:03] just head knowledge.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; I just read I just read when I was
[1:38:14] coming home from Russia
[1:38:16] and they were concerned about the
[1:38:19] incredible number of young people
[1:38:21] between 18 and 25 that don't have work
[1:38:24] in the world. It was news, major news on
[1:38:28] the Canadian news broadcasting system
[1:38:31] this last week. 12.6%
[1:38:35] of the of the population is without
[1:38:38] employment. And this is a youth that are
[1:38:40] unemployed. And they said that the
[1:38:43] entire population of America now about
[1:38:45] 350 million people
[1:38:48] in the age of 18 to 25 that number of
[1:38:52] people are without work in the world.
[1:38:54] And it's having a shift in the
[1:38:56] demographics of the of the world and
[1:38:59] it's it's it's it has a ripple effect of
[1:39:01] problems and the professor or whoever
[1:39:05] was speaking and writing this article
[1:39:07] it's in the economist magazine I believe
[1:39:09] or the Herald Tribune from Paris and
[1:39:12] they were saying this is a massive
[1:39:14] massive problem and it it brings a
[1:39:17] delusion not a delusion but a
[1:39:20] disheartenment to the to the people. And
[1:39:22] I said we have to find some way
[1:39:25] to close the gap between the world of
[1:39:29] education
[1:39:31] and the world of work.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Huge gap between the two.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Because a person can become so educated.
[1:39:39] This is where a believer has to draw the
[1:39:41] line
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; and know how far
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; and for what is the purpose.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; My purpose is to live godly to be an
[1:39:48] example there. Yeah.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; And my first purpose is that I'm a son
[1:39:52] of God. I'm a daughter of God.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach it.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; And I would say to the young ladies,
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; if you go for further education because
[1:40:03] you haven't got anything to do now, go
[1:40:05] for further education. You should make
[1:40:07] absolutely certain that it's something
[1:40:08] that will add to motherhood.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Hello. Right.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going to learn philosophy and and do
[1:40:19] what? I'm going to go into the sciences.
[1:40:22] Well, I'd help you raise your children.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; The great Apostle Paul says, "I would
[1:40:28] that the younger women marry."
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; And bear children
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Well, it's not popular maybe anymore.
[1:40:41] We're not we're not talking about what's
[1:40:44] popular.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; We're talking about what the scripture
[1:40:47] says.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; And God has hidden his treasures
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; in his word.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; And they're there, but Satan has come
[1:40:55] along and said, "Well, that's not really
[1:40:57] the end thing to do. We're not into the
[1:41:00] end thing.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; We're into the eternal thing."
[1:41:10] And then there's the other side of
[1:41:11] searching and that is search me oh God.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; King David said and know my heart.
[1:41:19] Obviously there were some things that he
[1:41:21] perhaps didn't fully understand. Know me
[1:41:24] and know my heart and try me and know my
[1:41:27] thoughts.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; And that was a that was a different
[1:41:31] different meaning.
[1:41:33] examine me thoroughly and search me out
[1:41:37] and to be ascertained.
[1:41:39] You know, I've I've used it here over
[1:41:41] the pulpit because the Bible says, "And
[1:41:44] and God did tempt Abraham." He didn't
[1:41:47] tempt him with evil. He assayed him as
[1:41:50] you do with a mining ore. And you grind
[1:41:53] it until it's fine powder.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, your song broken. Not just
[1:42:01] broken, ground down. It says that our
[1:42:06] Lord Jesus Christ, this this uh wheat of
[1:42:10] life,
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; this grain of wheat
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; was ground until it became fine powder
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; to make the loaf
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; a bread
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; for us.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; He was acquainted with grief.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't visit. He wasn't visited with
[1:42:28] grief. He was acquainted with grief
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; and acquainted with disappointments and
[1:42:33] suffering
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; and we hid as it were our faces from
[1:42:38] him.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; He was despised and rejected of men.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; You want him to be your Lord?
[1:42:50] I do.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; I do indeed. And David said, "Search
[1:42:55] me." Apostle Peter said, "Beloved, think
[1:42:59] not strange concerning the fiery trial
[1:43:02] which is to try you as though some
[1:43:04] strange thing happened to you."
[1:43:07] When brother Brandham talked about
[1:43:09] turning over every stone and be certain
[1:43:10] of God, just let me just quickly read
[1:43:12] this because I have so much more I have
[1:43:14] to get on to here very quickly. He says,
[1:43:18] he says, when we've confessed all of our
[1:43:20] sin and we've met every requirement that
[1:43:23] God requires, we believed on God,
[1:43:26] there's a circumstance has to be met and
[1:43:29] it's according to his will and we've
[1:43:31] confessed our sin and we've made all
[1:43:34] we've made all the wrongs that we have
[1:43:36] did right and done everything that we
[1:43:39] know how to do. every requirement that
[1:43:42] God had made or asked, we have met that
[1:43:45] requirement. And yet he lays silent. He
[1:43:48] just won't answer.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; And he goes on, he says, I'm sure that
[1:43:53] I'm speaking to peoples this morning who
[1:43:57] have come to that place.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, I've been
[1:44:02] there many times myself.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice?
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; I've been there many times myself. He
[1:44:10] said, "When I've went back and traced my
[1:44:13] life," and this is the only place I find
[1:44:15] this phrase that came my subject this
[1:44:18] morning and turned over every stone
[1:44:22] and I'd find that I did something wrong
[1:44:25] and I'd go and confess it and say, "Lord
[1:44:27] God, I'll make it right." And do so and
[1:44:31] then come back again and say, "Now,
[1:44:33] Lord, thou art God, you'll answer me.
[1:44:36] Surely I've met every request that I
[1:44:39] that you've required me to do and every
[1:44:41] requirement I've met it and still he
[1:44:45] won't move.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Seems to set silent. That's when you've
[1:44:49] got to be sure that he is God
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; and don't be discouraged.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; The only thing is that in your heart be
[1:44:58] certain of God.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; I thought that is so encouraging.
[1:45:06] friends,
[1:45:08] when I had a slip disc in my neck that
[1:45:11] went against the spinal cord and the
[1:45:13] doctor said, "We'll get your bed as
[1:45:15] quick as possible
[1:45:18] and sign this piece of paper, put it off
[1:45:21] me sign to relieve them of any
[1:45:24] responsibility because it's a dangerous
[1:45:26] thing touching the spinal cord."
[1:45:30] And I said, I walked out of his office.
[1:45:34] I said, "Is there any possibility that
[1:45:36] it no?" He said, "There's no possibility
[1:45:38] that improve." He said, "I have to go in
[1:45:40] here and take bone from your hip or bone
[1:45:43] from a cow and fuse those together
[1:45:47] and suck the disc out that's pressing
[1:45:51] against the cord." And he said, "That's
[1:45:55] the only way."
[1:45:57] And I was walking. I had to have my arm
[1:45:59] up over my head.
[1:46:02] I walk into the car and I got in the car
[1:46:05] and now here starts my search.
[1:46:09] I said, "Take me to the church."
[1:46:15] I came and stood right here.
[1:46:18] And I had the three brothers that were
[1:46:20] here come and and stand with me. And I
[1:46:23] said,
[1:46:25] I'm following I'm following exactly what
[1:46:28] I say to people when they are in
[1:46:29] desperation.
[1:46:32] Follow the scriptures to the letter.
[1:46:35] And the scripture says, "Is any
[1:46:37] afflicted, let him pray."
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; I want to say that to the congregation.
[1:46:43] When you get afflicted, you pray.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Don't call on somebody else. Don't get
[1:46:51] on the telephone. Don't get on Facebook
[1:46:53] and some other nonsense. You pray.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Is any sick among you? Let him call.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; That's the clues
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; to the treasure.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; And I said to the three brothers, I have
[1:47:11] not asked you to come here to pray for
[1:47:14] me.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; I said, I want to follow the scripture
[1:47:17] to the letter. I have come here to pray.
[1:47:21] Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; And I ask you to pray with me.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; I said, "I'm not sick. I'm terribly
[1:47:28] afflicted."
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; And I knelt and prayed. Nothing
[1:47:33] happened.
[1:47:35] I lost 10 pounds in the next two weeks.
[1:47:37] I went back to the same doctor. I said,
[1:47:40] "We're here. I'm here for the
[1:47:41] operation." He said, "But how are you?"
[1:47:43] I said, "I lost 10bs in the last two
[1:47:46] weeks if that means anything." But he
[1:47:48] says, "But you're you well," he says,
[1:47:49] "Come in the next room." and he began to
[1:47:51] examine me. He said, "But you're no
[1:47:52] worse." I said, "Dr. Chan, Dr. Richard
[1:47:55] Chan at Colombian Royal Colombian
[1:47:58] Hospital,
[1:47:59] one of three specialists."
[1:48:02] I said, "I've come here for the
[1:48:03] operation."
[1:48:04] But he said, "But you're no worse."
[1:48:08] I said, "But I'm no better." And I was
[1:48:11] just testing it because the Lord had
[1:48:12] already told me
[1:48:16] and a voice speaking through my own
[1:48:18] voice. Hallelujah.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; I said, "If thou wilt, thou can make me
[1:48:23] whole." And he said, "Through me, I will
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; be thou whole."
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; And I stood here behind this pulpit and
[1:48:29] spoke to this congregation said, "Not
[1:48:31] better, not improved, but whole."
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; I want you to know I stand here today 16
[1:48:38] years later,
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; having never had a doctor touch that
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; that boy.
[1:48:46] I go hunting with my son-in-laws. I go
[1:48:49] riding the quad and I'm absolutely free.
[1:48:52] And they tell me three of my discs have
[1:48:56] three of my vertebrae have no discs
[1:48:58] between them. I don't know. I don't
[1:49:00] understand it. But I know that my
[1:49:02] author, author of life,
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; has sent a word.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; I don't have anywhere else to turn.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not against doctors. I go to them
[1:49:14] frequently. Not infrequently, but I go
[1:49:16] to them, take their advice. But all then
[1:49:19] there's a time when a man can only go so
[1:49:22] far, my prophet said, and that's when
[1:49:25] God starts. That's where he begins.
[1:49:28] Hallelujah.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; And when this life is fading away and
[1:49:36] man can do nothing for you and your
[1:49:38] loved ones can do nothing for you,
[1:49:40] there's another one, the author of
[1:49:42] eternal life. Hallelujah. He's already
[1:49:44] spoken the word of the resurrection.
[1:49:48] [Applause]
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; I've received that word.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; You've received that word of the
[1:49:54] resurrection which is beyond this life.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Excuse me for getting excited, but this
[1:50:06] this is worth being excited.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us of another search
[1:50:11] that went on. Abraham I I'm not near
[1:50:15] over. I'll have to probably take another
[1:50:16] service. But Abraham looked for a city.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; And how he looked for a city.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; He never occupied it. Friends,
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; I want you to really stick this down
[1:50:27] your heart. He never occupied it, but he
[1:50:30] continued to look for it.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, I won't read it
[1:50:34] all, but the prophet said he looked for
[1:50:36] it because he had met the king of that
[1:50:39] city. He met Melzdc. He said, "I know
[1:50:43] that city is some place.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; I know heaven is some place.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know exactly where, but I know
[1:50:51] it's some place.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; He told me about it.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; And I also met the king of that city.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; I met the king.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; I've heard him speak.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; I've heard him speak. I've heard his
[1:51:07] voice.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; And I can never deny it.
[1:51:11] Hallelujah.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; And so Abraham, father Abraham,
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; I too follow in the footsteps of faith.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; I look for the same city.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I say, I'll meet you in
[1:51:24] that city.
[1:51:29] [Music]
[1:51:29] [Applause]
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; That one single encounter,
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; we say, "Oh God, we need you every day.
[1:51:37] We need you to meet us. We need you to
[1:51:38] bless. We need you to speak. No, that
[1:51:41] one encounter Abraham encountered
[1:51:44] Melchisedc once
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; and that put him in such expectation he
[1:51:50] never deterred from his direction.
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; God give us children of Abraham.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; He searched for this city and remained
[1:52:02] faithful to the vision
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; even though he did not occupy it. Then
[1:52:11] I hope you're not too weary.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Then our Lord Jesus said to leaders and
[1:52:16] men who ought to have known better, I'm
[1:52:18] saying to you and you young people, I
[1:52:21] address you because you've got minds
[1:52:22] that are far beyond mine. You want to
[1:52:25] really absorb this and
[1:52:29] your use of studies and your used
[1:52:34] uh accustomed to retention. you retain
[1:52:37] these things. Jesus said,
[1:52:40] "Search the scriptures."
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; For in them you think you have eternal
[1:52:48] life.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; It's almost reading their minds if you
[1:52:52] want to put it that way. They were they
[1:52:55] go to the synagogue like we're sitting
[1:52:56] in church. You have eternal life. Oh
[1:52:58] yeah, I have eternal life. He said,
[1:53:00] "Search the scriptures
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; because they are the ones that testify
[1:53:04] of me. They're the ones that tell me
[1:53:07] tell you that I'll be here at this time.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:53:16] I don't want to lay any heavies, but
[1:53:19] those those of you that are seated here
[1:53:21] in this congregation and those that are
[1:53:23] on the internet that don't really have a
[1:53:27] real good solid clue of what the prophet
[1:53:30] of God, God said, I'll send Elijah the
[1:53:33] prophet. Amen.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; I'll send you
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; And he'll turn your heart
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; back to the faith of the fathers.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; And if you say today, I need to have my
[1:53:48] faith turned back to the faith of the
[1:53:50] original fathers.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Then the book is here. The memoirs are
[1:53:54] here.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; The history is here.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; The future is here.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God has come. And he
[1:54:02] said that in one of the last message I
[1:54:04] think it is things that are to be he
[1:54:06] said God has so spoken so clearly and
[1:54:11] and he says I've given you the places.
[1:54:13] I've given you the addresses. I've given
[1:54:16] you I've given you all the statistics.
[1:54:19] He told people where they were from. He
[1:54:21] told everything. Revealed the secret of
[1:54:24] their heart. He said God like God can do
[1:54:26] no more. And I want to say friends, if
[1:54:29] God could have sent something better, he
[1:54:31] would have.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; He has sent his best.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; He's already sent his best.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; He can do no more to get you to heaven
[1:54:41] than what he's already done.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; So search the scriptures.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; For in them you think you have life. And
[1:54:51] it is in modern events made clear. And
[1:54:53] I'll read it for you. Remember he comes
[1:54:56] in three sons names.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; He came first in the name of the son of
[1:55:00] man. Never called himself the son of
[1:55:02] god. He acknowledged that of course but
[1:55:05] he says now he come after the day of
[1:55:07] pentecost came back in the form of the
[1:55:09] holy ghost supernatural spirit. Now he's
[1:55:12] the son of god
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; in the millennium. He'll be son of David
[1:55:17] sitting upon the throne of David.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; He said he's come come son of god son of
[1:55:22] man son of David. Oh, the Bible is full
[1:55:26] of these nuggets.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Do you sit here this morning and have
[1:55:31] not discovered that was a nugget?
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; That's a greater treasure than if I gave
[1:55:35] you a a whole brick of gold.
[1:55:37] [Applause]
[1:55:41] for you to come to the realization
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; God sent a son of man revealing Jesus
[1:55:47] Christ
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; and did all of these things that I can
[1:55:51] hear it I can read it I can assimilate
[1:55:54] it in my mind oh what a day I'm in
[1:55:59] [Music]
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; he said,
[1:56:07] "Am not I tonight, just listen to this,
[1:56:10] please.
[1:56:11] Am not I tonight trying to tell you word
[1:56:16] by word, even to the position, the
[1:56:20] place,
[1:56:21] the names,
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; the numbers, everything else, and all of
[1:56:27] the signs of times, and everything that
[1:56:31] were right here at the end time. That's
[1:56:34] what all of that signed was for. The
[1:56:35] sign of the Messiah, the sign of the
[1:56:37] resurrection that we're right here.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "Surely you can see what I'm
[1:56:44] talking about."
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look, that's so plain. It
[1:56:48] should need no more identification." He
[1:56:50] said,
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; when he was here on earth, he said,
[1:56:53] "Search the scriptures.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; In them you think you have eternal
[1:56:57] life." Amen.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; And there they
[1:57:00] testify
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; of what I see.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; I hope you're able to follow me.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Please, will you stay with me another
[1:57:09] few minutes?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; I have a I have a key thought,
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; a key part of this message. But just
[1:57:15] before I do, God did a search also.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; He waited through a lot of mud and filth
[1:57:22] and dirt to find you.
[1:57:25] [Music]
[1:57:28] He waited through a lot of doctrine and
[1:57:31] teaching and nonsense
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; to find us.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Each one of us
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; when I think of this, I would never
[1:57:47] known it without the message.
[1:57:49] And there's one sitting on the throne,
[1:57:54] the original
[1:57:56] life.
[1:57:58] Almighty God
[1:58:01] is taken back into his control, the
[1:58:05] ownership,
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; of the earth,
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; and all of his children.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; And he has the record of it
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; in a book. This is a book of redemption.
[1:58:18] Let me tell you friends, you know
[1:58:20] exactly what I'm talking about when I
[1:58:21] say they're trying to conserve water.
[1:58:24] They're wanting to purify the earth.
[1:58:27] They're wanting to go green. What are
[1:58:29] they wanting to do? They're wanting to
[1:58:30] redeem the mess that has been
[1:58:33] accumulated.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot redeem the earth he
[1:58:38] polluted.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; This is the book of redemption.
[1:58:47] This is the one who created in the first
[1:58:49] place
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; and he's the only one that knows how to
[1:58:52] renew it.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; And the pro and his prophet said he'll
[1:58:54] renew it by fire.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Water wouldn't do it. He'll renew it by
[1:58:59] fire.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; And he'll even burn the heavens
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; and all your war games and all of this
[1:59:05] filth and all this pornography.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Don't let it worry you, friends. It's
[1:59:10] going to pass off the scene in a holy,
[1:59:13] holy fire of God.
[1:59:17] God's going to destroy it.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; And so they searched through heaven
[1:59:31] and found a savior.
[1:59:33] [Music]
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; One of the services we arranged for
[1:59:37] brother Brandham,
[1:59:39] a native brother, got up and sang.
[1:59:42] He said it's the first time he sang and
[1:59:45] I'm going to let you hear him sing.
[1:59:49] One of the most beautiful voices.
[1:59:52] And this is what he said. This is what
[1:59:55] he sang. And the reason I have him sing
[1:59:56] it is because
[2:00:01] they searched through heaven
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; and found one.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Only one. No archangel,
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; no saraphim,
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; none of the ones that even stood in the
[2:00:15] presence of a holy God
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; could take that book.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; And a bleeding lamp. He said, "Where was
[2:00:22] he?"
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Came from the eternities.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; He'd been in battle.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Wasn't in battle for himself. He was in
[2:00:31] battle for you and for me.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:39] in the song and you'll hear it. Oh, what
[2:00:41] a savior.
[2:00:48] These are his comments
[2:00:54] and give us plenty of volume, please.
[2:01:07] I'm a little bit stage right
[2:01:10] Mike right first time I ever saw sang a
[2:01:14] song to a big congregation
[2:01:17] but praise God he's within my soul
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; and I know that I could stand up for him
[2:01:25] and say that I am saved
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[2:01:30] I've been saved now
[2:01:32] for
[2:01:35] year,
[2:01:37] two months, 3 months. Praise the Lord.
[2:01:40] It's been a wonderful,
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; wonderful servant him.
[2:01:46] I'm going to sing. What a taste you are.
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:02:00] One star was straight
[2:02:04] [Music]
[2:02:06] in dark.
[2:02:11] No hope within.
[2:02:19] [Music]
[2:02:21] They searched through heaven
[2:02:26] and they found a sing
[2:02:30] God. He save
[2:02:35] the soul
[2:02:37] like heal.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a savior.
[2:02:48] Oh hallelujah.
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; In his heart was broken.
[2:02:57] [Music]
[2:03:03] His hands were nail
[2:03:07] [Music]
[2:03:13] he
[2:03:18] for
[2:03:19] me.
[2:03:22] He left the father
[2:03:27] with all his rich tears.
[2:03:31] With calmness sweetness
[2:03:34] [Music]
[2:03:40] came down from heaven
[2:03:45] and gave his life
[2:03:49] to still
[2:03:52] last.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:58] Oh, what a savior.
[2:04:03] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:04:08] His heart was broken.
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:13] Unal.
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:18] His hands were nailed.
[2:04:22] He sat with him.
[2:04:25] [Music]
[2:04:27] He gave his last love
[2:04:32] for me. Oh my goodness.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Yet we walking
[2:04:42] out to the crushing
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:46] his hands will lead me.
[2:04:52] for
[2:04:55] I'll join the chorus
[2:05:00] in that city
[2:05:05] and sing after
[2:05:09] [Music]
[2:05:11] more.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a savior we are.
[2:05:21] Hallelujah.
[2:05:25] He was strong.
[2:05:33] [Music]
[2:05:35] He has forg. Because
[2:05:40] he died
[2:05:42] for
[2:05:45] He's
[2:05:46] [Music]
[2:05:55] over again, please.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a savior.
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:07] Hallelujah.
[2:06:08] [Music]
[2:06:10] His
[2:06:12] hands were broken
[2:06:16] and
[2:06:19] [Music]
[2:06:21] his hands were never
[2:06:26] heavily
[2:06:27] [Music]
[2:06:36] for me.
[2:06:43] Brother Brandham walked out from behind
[2:06:46] just a little wall just came out this
[2:06:48] way.
[2:06:50] You could hear it if you hear the tape.
[2:06:51] He said wouldn't be much of a preacher
[2:06:54] if you couldn't preach after that.
[2:06:58] He told me it was the best meeting he'd
[2:07:00] had in that whole series coming up the
[2:07:02] coast from California, Oregon,
[2:07:04] Washington, then amongst the native
[2:07:07] people.
[2:07:10] I want to conclude by and it won't be a
[2:07:13] down. It's rather an upside of this
[2:07:15] service.
[2:07:18] Are you ready? Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[2:07:24] first Peter, Peter's recording it, of
[2:07:27] which salvation the prophets have
[2:07:29] inquired and searched diligently,
[2:07:32] who prophesied of the ga grace that
[2:07:35] should come unto you, searching
[2:07:39] what or what manner of time the spirit
[2:07:42] of Christ which was in them did signify
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; when it testified beforehand of the
[2:07:50] sufferings of Christ and the glory that
[2:07:54] should follow.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus, as he was just moving up to his
[2:07:58] sufferings just before the cross, just
[2:08:02] moving up to his sufferings, this was
[2:08:03] written just after just moving up to his
[2:08:06] sufferings. He said, "Father, glorify
[2:08:09] thyself." Then came there a voice from
[2:08:11] heaven and those that stood by said, "It
[2:08:14] thundered." And the prophet in the seals
[2:08:17] goes back to that scripture
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; when in the revelation 10 there were
[2:08:21] thunders
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; a voice like thunder
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; and he he said he goes back to that he
[2:08:28] said see what the thunder is it's the
[2:08:30] voice of God
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; this message
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; came as a result of the voice of God
[2:08:38] it's not the voice of a man it's not the
[2:08:40] voice of an institution it's not the
[2:08:42] voice of a seminary it's the voice of
[2:08:45] God.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; And thus the Holy Spirit witnesses into
[2:08:50] your heart and your soul that this is
[2:08:53] not a man.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; This did not come from a book.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; This is the voice of God speaking
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; and it comes like a thunder
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; from God.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit in you is signifying
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; and is signified. And the spirit of God
[2:09:14] that's in you is searching,
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; scanning, scanning the horizon
[2:09:20] concerning what and what manner of time
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; is this that this glory which should
[2:09:27] follow.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; For the bride, the woman is the glory of
[2:09:31] the man.
[2:09:33] The Holy Spirit is witnessing
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; inside of us, searching out that this is
[2:09:40] the season of that scripture to be
[2:09:43] fulfilled.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; And it is being fulfilled.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; It is being fulfilled.
[2:09:52] [Applause]
[2:09:55] [Music]
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Let us be awakened
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; to this season that we're in. Amen.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; The prophets prophesied of the grace
[2:10:05] that would come.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God that was in them
[2:10:08] spoke of the sufferings of Christ and
[2:10:10] the glory that should follow. And
[2:10:13] through the inner vision by the Holy
[2:10:16] Spirit, the prophets saw something
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; and they saw everything I would say from
[2:10:22] Adam, what Adam lost being restored back
[2:10:25] again. They said, uh, the spirit that's
[2:10:28] in us
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; is witnessing that this is to be
[2:10:32] restored.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; And the prophets one after the other
[2:10:35] died and another one died. But they said
[2:10:38] the spirit that's in us is witnessing
[2:10:41] that this is to be restored.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, just pray that God give
[2:10:48] me a strengthened voice now.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; This is the crux of this message because
[2:10:53] it's coming home to your address. The
[2:10:56] thing that you have felt in your heart
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; that you might feel call it exuberance
[2:11:00] or you might call it a positive feeling.
[2:11:02] It's none of that. It's way beyond that.
[2:11:05] It's the spirit of God testifying of the
[2:11:09] things that have been written concerning
[2:11:11] redemption in this book.
[2:11:14] It's testifying
[2:11:16] in this day that this is the hour when
[2:11:19] he will glorify himself again. God will
[2:11:23] glorify himself again
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; in another age
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; through another people
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; and in the midst of Satan's Eden
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; when everything imaginable is vile
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; and wretched and demoralized and wicked
[2:11:41] and even the integrity of man has gone
[2:11:45] away in that hour I'll come back
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; in that hour I'll speak again.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; In that hour it will not be a man's
[2:11:58] voice. It'll be my voice.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; And thus you have heard it. Said that's
[2:12:03] not me speaking.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Not a man, folks.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Not a man.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; I'm here telling you not a man.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; It's a voice.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hope you forgive me. That's the voice of
[2:12:20] the archangel,
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; a major angel
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; speaking.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God has not entrusted this
[2:12:28] message to any other voice.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; This voice.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; And you are the privilege of the earth
[2:12:37] to have heard these things.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; You're the elected lady of Jesus Christ.
[2:12:44] And the spirit that's in you, even in
[2:12:47] the midst of your difficulties, in the
[2:12:48] midst of your failures, the spirit
[2:12:50] that's in you says, "This is the season.
[2:12:54] This is the time. And this is the
[2:12:56] message."
[2:12:59] Hallelujah.
[2:13:00] This is the resurrection hour.
[2:13:05] [Music]
[2:13:05] [Applause]
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; I won't send it again. I won't do it
[2:13:11] again.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[2:13:14] You won't hear it again.
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:17] [Applause]
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; God's not sending another messenger.
[2:13:21] It's not another man that'll raise up.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; You got what you're going to get.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; We better search it out
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; and believe it
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; with everything that is within us.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Search it out.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Find these nuggets that God has left.
[2:13:41] this great treasure
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; that he's left.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; I think that those prophets, they must
[2:13:50] have seen and they couldn't have put it
[2:13:53] into words, but they it was witnessing
[2:13:56] to them of the glory. They must have saw
[2:13:59] the early church rise
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; in the New Testament
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; with the pure word of God. Oh, those
[2:14:07] prophets calling backsliden Israel to
[2:14:10] back into into line once again. They
[2:14:12] must have thought, "Oh, that'll be so
[2:14:15] glorious to live in that hour when when
[2:14:17] God
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; when God, not only the spirit that's
[2:14:22] moving me, but when God will come into
[2:14:24] humans.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; I wish I could live to that hour." They
[2:14:30] would say,
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; they saw the church rising. They saw it
[2:14:34] going in his tower. They saw the signs
[2:14:37] and the wonders and the miracles. Oh
[2:14:40] God, if we could live to that hour, but
[2:14:43] it was not for them.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; They had to go back out and face a
[2:14:48] backsliden people,
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; hardened people who were refused to be
[2:14:52] moved by their by the word of God that
[2:14:54] was in them.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; They couldn't bring them to expectation.
[2:14:59] And Apostle Peter picks it up. the
[2:15:02] spirit that was in them.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; And I think that they saw prophet said
[2:15:07] the reason why the early church had
[2:15:08] healings, miracles, and visions and
[2:15:10] power is because the living word of God
[2:15:12] in the form of the lion of the tribe of
[2:15:14] Judah
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; riding out to combat that
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; to combat.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; I'll make an announcement.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; You have more than sufficient within you
[2:15:24] to combat that out there. Amen.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it's SFU or a high
[2:15:30] school or some other damnable place. You
[2:15:33] have more than sufficient in you to
[2:15:36] withstand it.
[2:15:39] [Applause]
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; So in heaven,
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; the angels call. They must have seen it.
[2:15:50] They must have seen the book
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; in the hand of the original owner
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; and the spirit that was in them saying
[2:15:57] there's one there's one that can take
[2:16:00] that book.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; No wonder no wonder a great angel of
[2:16:06] this hour. And don't misunderstand me.
[2:16:09] You will never put brother Brandham on a
[2:16:11] pedestal that God put him on.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; He gave him the leading position. And
[2:16:16] there was an angel in this hour. A
[2:16:18] strong angel.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; A strong angel in Revelation 5. He said,
[2:16:23] "Let him
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; if he will,
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; if he will,
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; let him
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; come now and take the book."
[2:16:37] And whether you want to believe it or
[2:16:38] not, he came
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; and took the book
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; and released the seals and opened the
[2:16:45] book
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; and sent the word down
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; to an angel
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; and spoke the word.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; He said he will come
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; with a shout.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; He will descend with the voice,
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; not the voice. He imparts a voice to
[2:17:02] another.
[2:17:04] You better listen to me. The
[2:17:06] resurrection's already been spoken.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; That's the order of the rapture.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; The resurrection's already been spoken.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; All God has to do is just bring it to
[2:17:18] the crux of the crossing of the time.
[2:17:21] The timing
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; the dead in Christ could be walking the
[2:17:26] streets before you get out of this
[2:17:28] meeting. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; If you miss this, you'll miss that.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Don't miss this.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Don't miss what you're hearing now.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Don't let it go over your head.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Don't become dull and slow.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Say, "This is for me.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; This belongs to me.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; This is mine.
[2:18:00] Hallelujah.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; I won't let any man take my treasure.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; This is my treasure.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Belongs to us.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's yours, children.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; God can do nothing more.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; He'll give it to you
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; with such liberality as he has.
[2:18:26] And the spirit that's in you is
[2:18:27] witnessing
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; that what I'm saying is the truth.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; And what this message speaks is the
[2:18:33] truth.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Even when you don't understand it, you
[2:18:36] agree with it and you say it's the
[2:18:38] truth.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:47] [Applause]
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; The prophet right in the bridge, he's
[2:18:53] coming to the fields. the opening of the
[2:18:56] seals and he's saying the call went out.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; The call went out.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; The call went out throughout heaven.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Who's worthy? Who could tell us that?
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Who can tell us that but a prophet who
[2:19:10] can see into that realm
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; and the call has gone out. Amen.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; If a man can stand here on earth, he can
[2:19:18] hear what doctors are saying a week ago
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; or a month ago.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; He can hear what's going on in heaven.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Said there's a call.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; A call has gone out for somebody who's
[2:19:31] worthy.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Michael's standing there. Gabriel's
[2:19:37] standing there. No angel,
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; no archangel, he said.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; But God himself, that which came out
[2:19:46] from his bosom
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; and became the son of man, the son of
[2:19:50] God,
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; he came said, "Give me the book.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Give me the book."
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; I shed the blood. Give me the book.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; There's no other way.
[2:20:05] [Applause]
[2:20:09] I've paid for the book.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; I paid for the content.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[2:20:16] [Music]
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to cut I'm going to shut it
[2:20:21] down in a few minutes, but I have much
[2:20:24] more to say
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; next time. And you've read Revelation
[2:20:30] 10:1 many, many times.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; 1 through7. You've read it many, many
[2:20:34] times. I'd like to put some emphasis on
[2:20:37] it if you would please.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Would you allow me to do that?
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; This one that came and took the book.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; He says he could say, "I've been offered
[2:20:47] the world.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; I've been offered
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Satan came and tempted me. This same
[2:20:53] fallen archangel came to this one and
[2:20:56] tried to tempt me.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; And they showed me all the glories,
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; all the philosophy,
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; all the political power,
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; all the superpower,
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; all the political power, all the wealth.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Think of it. All the enticements. He
[2:21:13] showed him everything.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; But he could not persuade him.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; And he only asked for one thing. Satan
[2:21:21] only asked for one thing. This fallen
[2:21:23] archangel only asked for one thing. Fall
[2:21:25] down
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; and worship me
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; and you'll have it all.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Can you realize, friends,
[2:21:34] what that meant?
[2:21:37] He was willing to give up everything.
[2:21:39] All the glamour of Hollywood,
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; all the beauty and fame of those people,
[2:21:47] all the stardom of all the sports and
[2:21:49] all the people and all of those who have
[2:21:52] won gold and silver and bronze at the
[2:21:56] World Olympics
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; throughout the centuries. I'll give it
[2:22:00] all to you.
[2:22:04] I'll give you hundreds of millions and
[2:22:07] billions of people
[2:22:10] if you'll just fall down and worship me.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; If you can understand that or try to
[2:22:18] comprehend that, then you'll understand
[2:22:20] what was in his mind when he was in
[2:22:22] heaven
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; and wanting say I'll ascend and I'll be
[2:22:26] like God. He wanted to be worshiped. And
[2:22:29] that is why the scripture tells us in
[2:22:31] revelation this dragon and the dragon is
[2:22:34] not some ugly dragon that you think of.
[2:22:37] The Bible tells us in the Greek language
[2:22:40] it is a fabulous beast.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; All of the glory and all the gold and
[2:22:47] all the artwork and all the attention
[2:22:50] and all the wealth of the world is found
[2:22:53] in her.
[2:22:55] Amen.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; The mother harlot
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; and the mother of harlots.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Those that have followed along have the
[2:23:03] same baptism,
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; have the same understanding of the
[2:23:06] godhead. And the whole thing is pagan
[2:23:08] from beginning to end.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; Her holidays are pagan.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Everything, even the dress,
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; the dress code of the bishops and the
[2:23:18] popes and all of that is all pagan.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Thank God for deliverance.
[2:23:28] I know what I'm talking about, friends.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about. They
[2:23:32] tried to make me as a boy kiss the idols
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; and something was in me telling me that
[2:23:38] is not right. I'm not kissing this piece
[2:23:40] of wood.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; They must have seen all of that.
[2:23:57] So, here we are.
[2:24:01] Now, follow me real close.
[2:24:05] And I saw another mighty angel
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; clothed
[2:24:12] with a cloud.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; And a rainbow upon his head. Not a
[2:24:17] rainbow over his head, a rainbow upon
[2:24:19] his head. The rainbow is the covenant.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; This is what's in his mind.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; The covenant,
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; the word
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; has come down that this enemy, this
[2:24:31] fallen archangel has tried to
[2:24:34] contaminate
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; and tried to dilute, tried to adulterate
[2:24:39] and denominationalize.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; And now he's descending with a rainbow
[2:24:44] right upon his head. I'm coming to
[2:24:46] restore this. Hallelujah.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said it was Christ.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; And now listen.
[2:24:58] And the rainbows upon his head and his
[2:25:00] face was as it were the sun.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Please stay with me. As it were the sun.
[2:25:06] And he said it's the same as in
[2:25:07] Revelation one. His sun shining in its
[2:25:11] strength. Amen.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Because that is a that is a symbol and a
[2:25:16] declaration of judgment.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; Now listen close. As it were the sun and
[2:25:22] his feet as pillars of fire.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; And in Revelation one as feet there were
[2:25:27] pillars of fire as burning and a brass
[2:25:30] there were brass
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; burning and brass has always been
[2:25:33] judgment. The brass serpent
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; uh on the pole in the wilderness. the
[2:25:38] sea of brass but became glass
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; because it was judgment.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; All right, are you follow it close? And
[2:25:46] his feet now and his head as it were.
[2:25:50] The head is a word that is used in the
[2:25:53] phrases relating to capital and extreme
[2:25:56] punishment. Please follow this very
[2:25:58] closely. anything supreme, chief,
[2:26:02] prominent of persons, master, lord, of a
[2:26:06] husband in relations to his wife, of
[2:26:08] Christ, the Lord, of the husband and the
[2:26:12] church of things, and of the
[2:26:14] cornerstone. He's a cornerstone. Now,
[2:26:17] he's coming. He's coming with the word
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; and with the with the symbols of extreme
[2:26:23] judgment
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; for two reasons. So that the bride
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; who has a messenger on earth, follow it
[2:26:31] close,
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; could have that messenger declare, you
[2:26:35] never sinned in the first place.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he that is descending is
[2:26:42] coming with extreme judgment.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Not on the individual, on he will turn
[2:26:48] over every stone
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; and come to the beginning and say, "You
[2:26:53] serpent are the one. you Satan. And that
[2:26:56] is why the dragon, the old devil and and
[2:27:00] the Satan has cast into the lake of
[2:27:03] fire. He bundles them all together in
[2:27:06] the book of Revelation and destroys them
[2:27:08] because it's extreme judgment
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; so that he can tell you,
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; not a church member,
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; but a part of the body of Jesus Christ.
[2:27:18] So to tell you,
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; you're not responsible.
[2:27:24] Hallelujah.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; If you repent,
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; you're not responsible.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; The blood and he that's descended is the
[2:27:32] one who shed the supreme price.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; And the supreme price, oh God, give me
[2:27:39] your voice. The supreme price paid for
[2:27:42] the extreme judgment.
[2:27:46] Your sin
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; has come under the extreme judgment
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; of the judge himself,
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; the worthy one,
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; the wicked one.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; So he could say, "You're free.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; You're pure.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; You're without spot
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; and without wrinkle
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; or any such thing.
[2:28:08] [Applause]
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:28:13] Amen.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; And extreme judgment
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; because just beyond
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; just beyond
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; is a lake of fire
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; where he's going to be done with.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; The old devil, the serpent,
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; that dragon,
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; all of it and all that followed him
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; going to become go into complete
[2:28:38] annihilation.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; And all I can say to you friends
[2:28:42] There's coming a time
[2:28:45] you'll never be troubled with it again.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; And never be troubled again.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; And he took the complete and extreme
[2:29:03] death penalty for our son sin. Now,
[2:29:07] here's the one.
[2:29:09] And the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; at his very presence.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; And the supreme judge coming now to
[2:29:17] judge a godrejecting world.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "Warning, then
[2:29:24] judgment."
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But but but but but in the
[2:29:30] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[2:29:33] that's why he had to send that seventh
[2:29:35] angel
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; to let the people know this one is the
[2:29:38] one that's descending.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; That's why at the end of his ministry,
[2:29:41] he said he does all three when he's
[2:29:42] descending. Does all three of them.
[2:29:45] [Music]
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; And his countenance was as the sun
[2:29:50] shineth in his strength. And he had in
[2:29:52] his hand a little book open. And he set
[2:29:55] his right foot upon the sea and upon the
[2:29:57] earth. And he cried with a loud voice as
[2:29:59] when a lion roar. And when he cried,
[2:30:01] seven thunders uttered their voices. The
[2:30:04] open book. And even the voice that he
[2:30:06] cried is the result of a book that's
[2:30:09] open.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; If the book had not been open, he
[2:30:11] wouldn't have had anything to say. But
[2:30:12] now the book is open. He's got something
[2:30:14] to say.
[2:30:16] [Applause]
[2:30:16] [Music]
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; And he cried with a loud voice.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; And when he cried, seven thunders
[2:30:22] uttered the voices. And when the seven
[2:30:23] thunders uttered their voices, I was
[2:30:25] about to write
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; and a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up
[2:30:29] those things. Don't write them."
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the
[2:30:34] seventh angel,
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; when he shall begin to sound, all the
[2:30:37] mystery of God will be made known.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; Well, my time is gone.
[2:31:16] I'd like I'd like to have carried on.
[2:31:20] That which is in me,
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; that spirit which is in me is
[2:31:24] testifying.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; And urging to you, I'm not here to
[2:31:28] preach a sermon. That spirit that's in
[2:31:30] me is testifying.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; There will never be another message like
[2:31:34] this ever.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; There will never be vindication like
[2:31:36] this ever. So catch it. That vindication
[2:31:39] is such a treasure to you, friends. Such
[2:31:41] a treasure.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; Such a treasure. Amen.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; This might be a surprise to you, but I
[2:31:48] sat and had coffee with Brother Roger
[2:31:50] Smith yesterday. We spent about an hour
[2:31:53] together. We had a wonderful time. Just
[2:31:55] a wonderful time. And and he just said,
[2:31:58] "Well, let's go for coffee." We both
[2:32:00] arrived at the same place. He was just
[2:32:02] going out and I was just coming in. He
[2:32:03] said, "Let's just go and have coffee." I
[2:32:05] said, "Sounds good." We sat and talked
[2:32:07] and fellowship. He got talking about the
[2:32:10] opening of the word and he got talking
[2:32:13] the vindication. He says the vindication
[2:32:14] that's it. He says, you know, people try
[2:32:16] to belittle the vindication. Hey, I tell
[2:32:19] you what, I'm so thankful for every
[2:32:21] supernatural vindication.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That's the manifestation
[2:32:26] of this God that we love.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I've got to stop her. I
[2:32:32] won't get stopped.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Amen.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could sing uh
[2:32:42] let's sing a verse. They searched
[2:32:44] through heaven and found a savior. Would
[2:32:48] you sing it with me?
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; And then we'll close
[2:33:04] it. It is. Oh, what a savior.
[2:33:15] Through sin dark valley
[2:33:18] [Music]
[2:33:21] within
[2:33:22] [Music]
[2:33:25] I see.
[2:33:29] They searched through heaven.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:33] and found a
[2:33:37] wonderful save
[2:33:43] like
[2:33:45] oh hallelujah
[2:33:52] hallelu
[2:33:58] [Music]
[2:34:01] on Calary
[2:34:05] his hands were
[2:34:08] star
[2:34:10] his life was
[2:34:14] he
[2:34:16] [Music]
[2:34:22] now just so that you know that that
[2:34:24] pianist that was playing and just came
[2:34:27] right on with such an introduction that
[2:34:29] was sister Biscoll
[2:34:32] And I was sitting right behind him
[2:34:33] playing my guitar.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say you were there? Yes, we were
[2:34:39] there. Hallelujah.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; And if I could do if I had the power,
[2:34:43] I'd just transfer you all there for a
[2:34:45] most wonderful moment and hearing our
[2:34:48] our brothers sing. Charles brothers, his
[2:34:50] three brothers, they made some records
[2:34:53] and so on so forth. And we're going to
[2:34:55] try to get some of them for you as well.
[2:34:57] All right, the next verse.
[2:35:02] He left the father
[2:35:06] with all his
[2:35:10] [Music]

[2:36:08] for
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; death chilly waters death chilly water
[2:36:17] I'll soon be crossing
[2:36:21] his hand will
[2:36:28] [Music]
[2:36:33] Yes, we will give you that praise
[2:36:39] and sing.
[2:36:44] God bless you saints. God bless you. Oh
[2:36:48] myior.
[2:36:52] Oh hallelujah.
[2:36:59] [Music]
[2:37:14] He gave his life
[2:37:19] for you.
[2:37:22] Wonderful. Brother Tom, would you close
[2:37:24] in prayer, please? Brother Tom, close in
[2:37:26] prayer. God bless you.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; Have a wonderful day.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. His presence.
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; My cup has not only been lifted up,
[2:37:40] Lord, but it's full this morning.
[2:37:43] And Lord, I trust every cup that's been
[2:37:45] present this morning is lifted up,
[2:37:47] filled, running down.
[2:37:51] We've heard your word and it's stirred
[2:37:53] deeply within our hearts this morning.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; What a voice we have received in this
[2:38:02] hour. What a voice, Lord. And there are
[2:38:05] men that you have raised up, Lord, that
[2:38:07] are sounding forth the same trumpet,
[2:38:10] an instrument of the voice.
[2:38:13] Lord, let that resurrection take place
[2:38:15] with amongst us, Lord.
[2:38:18] Father, that's our expectation. That has
[2:38:20] been our yearning. And Lord, as we've
[2:38:23] heard the word this morning, it's just
[2:38:24] brought it closer. Lord, the next hand
[2:38:27] we shake,
[2:38:30] the next meal we take,
[2:38:33] Lord, we're expecting
[2:38:35] at any moment a change within the atoms.
[2:38:40] And so, Lord, as we've heard the word
[2:38:42] and we've so reveled in it, we're so
[2:38:44] thankful for your servant, thankful for
[2:38:46] a man of God, Lord, that has yielded
[2:38:48] himself to you. I pray, God, that as
[2:38:51] we've taken deeply, we've drunk deeply
[2:38:53] of your word that we can truly say with
[2:38:56] thanksgiving in our hearts, it's good to
[2:38:59] been in the house of the Lord. So,
[2:39:02] Father, as we have tucked these nuggets,
[2:39:05] as we heard this morning, deep within
[2:39:07] our hearts, may we ponder them, may we
[2:39:10] revel in them, may we speak about them.
[2:39:13] May it not just be, Lord, a a service
[2:39:15] this morning and go out and forget
[2:39:18] what's spoken, but may there have been a
[2:39:20] great deposit of the Holy Ghost within
[2:39:22] the hearts of your children. That their
[2:39:24] hearts are also burning, Lord. that they
[2:39:27] could run six miles to proclaim the
[2:39:29] resurrection is on. May we run and hold
[2:39:34] this message dear. Lord, we're thankful
[2:39:36] again for the assembling of the saints,
[2:39:39] for each one that is here this morning.
[2:39:41] May they go with burning hearts.
[2:39:43] Thankful that you have done Lord a great
[2:39:47] thing within our lives this morning in
[2:39:50] Jesus' name. Amen. So I'm casting all my
[2:39:55] cares on you.

[2:41:20] That's what
[2:41:24] testify
[2:41:26] might.
[2:41:31] Is he alive?
[2:41:33] And he's coming back for you and me. I
[2:41:36] think we can sing him one more time for
[2:41:37] his. And so I'm casting all my cares on
[2:41:43] you.
[2:41:46] I know
[2:41:48] you love me.

[2:42:22] He's risen
[2:42:25] and he's coming back for you and me.
[2:42:33] I think we can rejoice this morning.
[2:42:36] Hallelujah.
[2:42:38] speaking to us, dealing with us, and
[2:42:41] moving us into deeper depths and higher
[2:42:44] objectives in the word.
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; To God be the glory. Great things he has
[2:42:48] done.
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tuck the word in your heart this
[2:42:52] morning. Don't let it go. Don't let the
[2:42:53] devil rob you when you go out these
[2:42:55] doors. You go over in your mind what
[2:42:58] those nuggets that God had deposited in
[2:43:00] your little strip bag and you start
[2:43:02] polishing them over lunch,
[2:43:05] over this afternoon, and you start
[2:43:08] dwelling on these things
[2:43:11] because I believe we are in that season.
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:17] Catch us away, oh Lord. Let that chariot
[2:43:20] of God's fire come down and swing low.
[2:43:24] You'll never regret it, Brother West.
[2:43:26] We'll have a shouting rejubile at that
[2:43:29] time. God bless you. Greet one another.
[2:43:32] Nice to see you all here this morning. I
[2:43:34] know God's here and I'm thankful for his
[2:43:36] presence and for your presence. You're
[2:43:39] dismissed in Jesus name.
