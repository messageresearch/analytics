[0:00] King James Bible the Book of Genesis
[0:04] chapter 17 and when Abram was 90 years
[0:07] old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram
[0:10] and said unto him I am the almighty God
[0:13] walk before me and be thou perfect and I
[0:16] will make my Covenant between me and
[0:18] thee and will multiply thee exceedingly
[0:21] and Abram fell on his face and God
[0:23] talked with him saying as for me behold
[0:27] my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt
[0:29] be father of many nations neither shall
[0:32] thy name anymore be called Abram but thy
[0:35] name shall be Abraham for a father of
[0:37] many nations have I made thee and I will
[0:39] make thee exceeding fruitful and I will
[0:41] make nations of thee and Kings shall
[0:44] come out of thee and I will establish my
[0:46] Covenant between me and thee and thy
[0:48] seat after thee in their generations for
[0:50] an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto
[0:53] thee and to thy seat after thee and I
[0:55] will give unto thee and to thy seat
[0:57] after thee the land wherein thou art as
[1:00] stranger all the land of Canaan for an
[1:02] everlasting possession and I will be
[1:04] their God and God said unto Abraham Thou
[1:08] shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou
[1:10] and thy seed after thee in their
[1:12] Generations this is my Covenant which ye
[1:15] shall keep between me and you and thy
[1:17] seed after thee every Manch child among
[1:19] you shall be circumcised and ye shall
[1:22] circumcise the Flesh of your forkin and
[1:24] it shall be a token of the Covenant
[1:26] betwix me and you and he that is 8 days
[1:29] old shall be circumcised among you every
[1:31] Manchild in your Generations he that is
[1:34] born in the house or bought with money
[1:36] of any stranger which is not of thy seed
[1:39] he that is born in thy house and he that
[1:42] is bought with thy money must needs be
[1:44] circumcised and my Covenant shall be in
[1:46] your flesh for an Everlasting Covenant
[1:49] and the uncircumcised Man Child whose
[1:51] flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised
[1:54] that Soul shall be cut off from his
[1:56] people he hath broken my Covenant and
[1:59] God said unto to Abraham as for Sarai
[2:01] thy wife Thou shalt not call her name
[2:04] Sarai but Sarah shall her name be and I
[2:07] will bless her and give thee a son also
[2:09] of her yay I will bless her and she
[2:12] shall be a mother of Nations Kings of
[2:14] people shall be of her then Abraham fell
[2:17] upon his face and laughed and said in
[2:20] his heart shall a child be born unto him
[2:22] that is 100 years old and shall Sarah
[2:25] that is 90 years old bear and Abraham
[2:29] said unto God oh that Ishmael might live
[2:31] before thee and God said Sarah thy wife
[2:35] shall bear thee a son indeed and thou
[2:37] shalt call his name Isaac and I will
[2:39] establish my Covenant with him for an
[2:42] Everlasting Covenant and with his seed
[2:44] after him and is for Ishmael I have
[2:47] heard thee behold I have blessed him and
[2:50] will make him fruitful and will multiply
[2:52] him exceedingly 12 princes shall he
[2:55] beget and I will make him a great nation
[2:57] but my Covenant will I establish with
[2:59] Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee
[3:01] at this set time in the next year and he
[3:04] left off talking with him and God one up
[3:07] from Abraham and Abraham took Ishmael
[3:10] his son and all that were born in his
[3:12] house and all that were bought with his
[3:14] money every male among the men of
[3:16] Abraham's house and circumcised the
[3:18] Flesh of their foreskin in the self-same
[3:20] day as God had said unto him and Abraham
[3:24] was 90 years old and nine when he was
[3:26] circumcised In the Flesh of his foreskin
[3:29] and Ishmael his son was 13 years old
[3:32] when he was circumcised In the Flesh of
[3:33] his foreskin in the self-same day was
[3:36] Abraham circumcised and Ishmael his son
[3:40] and all the men of his house born in the
[3:42] house and bought with money of the
[3:44] stranger were circumcised with him
