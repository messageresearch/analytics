[10:30] offering and as the brothers prepare to
[10:32] bring that same God. Oh, the same God
[10:37] who spoke to the woman at the well.
[10:43] He's the same God
[10:46] whose wonders
[10:48] are too many
[10:50] to tell.
[10:52] Oh, sing God

[10:59] sea.

[11:12] the same God who spoke to the woman at
[11:19] the well

[11:23] who wonders
[11:25] too many
[11:27] to tell.
[11:29] The same God
[11:34] raing pressing.

[11:59] who wonders
[12:02] to many.
[12:06] Oh, the same God
[12:08] who guarded
[12:10] the raing
[12:12] sea.

[12:19] with me.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That same God's in this building
[12:27] tonight.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; He's very nigh to you.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; As our deacons, ushers come forward for
[12:32] the offering. We just want to give us
[12:35] unto the Lord as part of worship. If you
[12:37] have something you'd like to give for
[12:38] the for our camp, just expenses of our
[12:42] camp. I know the Lord would appreciate
[12:44] your worship. It's part of our worship.
[12:48] Amen. We'll bow our heads.
[12:51] Lord Jesus, there just seems to have
[12:53] been a sacredness expectation for these
[12:56] meetings, God. Even for this week, Lord,
[13:00] as you spoke to your disciples to come
[13:02] aside,
[13:03] Lord, and you spoke to them, I pray that
[13:06] as we've come aside from the world, and
[13:09] even tonight, Lord, our hearts are just
[13:12] beating with anticipation.
[13:14] I know it's just unanimous throughout
[13:17] this building. Lord, we're here for one
[13:19] purpose, and that is for you to be
[13:21] lifted up. Lord,
[13:22] &gt;&gt; we want our lives to be emptied out of
[13:25] the world and out of oursel. We don't
[13:28] want to be caught up with looking around
[13:29] or to one another, but we want to look
[13:31] to Jesus, take off any mass that would
[13:34] not be true. We just want to look into
[13:37] your face and have you speak your word
[13:40] into our lives. Whatever we have need
[13:43] of, we just pray that you would come
[13:45] individually.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; You're such a great God that you know
[13:49] how to come down in a little way, small
[13:52] way to each one of us so that we
[13:54] understand. Lord, you've been so good to
[13:56] us. Lord, you you've done miracles so
[13:59] great to save our souls and redeem us,
[14:03] heal our bodies, deliver our spirits.
[14:06] You've come to our lives and transformed
[14:08] us. We just want to give back to you
[14:10] tonight in our worship, in our giving,
[14:13] in our praises. Lord, if it's all we've
[14:15] got to just lift our hand and shout
[14:18] hallelujah and praise the Lord, it's
[14:20] it's a privilege, Lord. It's it's an
[14:22] honor to serve you, Lord Jesus.
[14:26] Bless the giving, Lord. And those that
[14:28] can't give that they would just give in
[14:30] in their amens tonight. And and the
[14:33] appreciation just maybe somebody tonight
[14:35] would give their life to you.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; Somebody rededicate themselves. Someone
[14:41] like our brother Jason, Lord, that you
[14:43] would deliver them, Lord, of of vices
[14:46] and enemies hold. That would be
[14:47] wonderful tonight, God. that you would
[14:50] just overshadow this tin and this
[14:52] grounds and those that are connected
[14:55] with us with the great August presence
[14:58] transforming presence. Bless every man
[15:01] and woman, boy and girl. We just quieten
[15:04] ourselves for your word. Speak to us.
[15:07] Anoint the vessel and bless this
[15:10] offering for the glory of God that you
[15:12] would multiply it and meet the needs in
[15:16] Jesus name.
[15:18] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[15:23] Seats
[15:26] the great eastipator
[15:31] just on the great emancipator as they're
[15:33] taking the offering up.
[15:39] Oh, once
[15:42] my heart and soul were fed
[15:49] by
[15:51] the binding chains of sin.
[15:57] Oh,

[16:08] me free to worship him.

[18:55] the great Emanuel
[19:01] and that's the song of the redee.

[31:18] &gt;&gt; You're the living water, Lord. You're
[31:21] the living water,
[31:27] the everflowing
[31:29] fountain
[31:33] for the comforter and counselor.
[31:39] Won't you take the king
[31:45] of God of the Holy Spirit?
[31:53] We are in your presence.
[31:59] Fill us with your power.
[32:06] inside
[32:08] of me.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord Jesus,
[32:20] &gt;&gt; as I hear the prophet of God say,
[32:25] you brother, you sister,
[32:28] &gt;&gt; he's come to you just now.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; You have a welcome spirit.
[32:37] You welcomed him and he came.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, here on this Saturday evening
[32:44] tonight,
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you for what you've done
[32:48] in the meeting so far.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; But here we stand in this moment of
[32:54] time.
[32:56] This service could change our lives
[32:59] forever.
[33:02] Oh God, tonight
[33:04] we bring our needs before you just now
[33:09] &gt;&gt; come by our way. Oh God,
[33:12] &gt;&gt; come by where we're at, Father.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know our needs. We don't even
[33:18] have to express it, but you know our
[33:20] needs.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; And Lord, what we're lacking tonight is
[33:25] more of you.
[33:27] There's not a one in this building or
[33:29] under the sound of my voice that don't
[33:31] need more of you.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray that we could enter into
[33:37] the inner veil.
[33:39] that every demon and principality and
[33:42] power would be bound,
[33:45] every chain of darkness,
[33:47] every spirit that would be against the
[33:50] word of the Lord would be brought down
[33:54] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[33:57] Sound a jubilee tonight in our ears, oh
[34:00] God.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're a slave no longer.
[34:07] Oh God, I pray that you would just come
[34:09] and anoint your vessel.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Anoint your children tonight.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, we welcome you here just now.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Forgive us of all of our sins and our
[34:21] attitudes.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[34:27] minister to us.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; I just pray we're worthy
[34:32] Lord by your blood in Jesus name.
[34:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[34:42] Hallelujah.
[34:44] I believe that he's here.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you will turn with me this
[34:50] evening to
[34:52] Luke chapter 9 verse 26 this afternoon.
[35:00] You had a good time.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:08] Luke chapter 9 verse 26.
[35:12] I would like to look this evening. I
[35:14] started this in Edmonton. Of course, you
[35:16] never get finished
[35:20] on the last service. I'd like to look at
[35:22] the dispute over our body.
[35:29] Luke 9 verse 26.
[35:33] For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and
[35:36] of my words, of him
[35:39] shall the Son of man be ashamed,
[35:43] when he shall come into his own glory,
[35:46] and in his fathers, and of the holy
[35:48] angels.
[35:51] But I yet tell you of a truth, that
[35:54] there be some standing here, which shall
[35:57] not taste of death,
[35:59] &gt;&gt; till they see the kingdom of God. Yeah.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass about 8 days after
[36:06] these sayings, he took Peter and John
[36:11] and James and went up into a mountain to
[36:14] pray. And as he prayed, the fashion of
[36:17] his countenance was altered, and his
[36:20] raignment was white and glistening.
[36:23] And behold, there talked with him two
[36:26] men, which were Moses and Elias,
[36:30] who appeared in glory, and spake of his
[36:34] deceas, which he should accomplish at
[36:37] Jerusalem. But Peter and they that were
[36:40] with him were heavy with sleep. And when
[36:43] they were awake, they saw his glory, and
[36:46] the two men that stood with him. And it
[36:50] came to pass as they dis departed from
[36:53] him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it
[36:57] is good for us to be here, let us make
[37:00] three tabernacles, one for thee, one for
[37:03] Moses, and one for Elias, not knowing
[37:06] what he said. And while he thus spake,
[37:09] there came a cloud and overshadowed
[37:12] them. And they feared as they entered
[37:15] into the cloud. And there came a voice
[37:18] out of the cloud saying, "This is my
[37:21] beloved son. Hear him."
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Jude verse 9. And and if you'll just
[37:28] hang there just a moment and I'll read
[37:30] this one scripture for you. While
[37:33] Michael the Archangel when contending
[37:37] with the devil, he disputed about the
[37:41] body of Moses, dur not bring against him
[37:45] a railing accusation,
[37:48] but saith the Lord rebuke thee. You may
[37:51] be seated this evening.
[37:57] Scriptures that are very pertinent to
[37:59] our hour and very upto-date. I I'd like
[38:01] to share them with you. Revelations 12
[38:05] and verse 7. And there was a war in
[38:07] heaven.
[38:09] And Michael and his angels fought
[38:11] against the dragon. And the dragon
[38:13] fought and his angels and prevailed not.
[38:17] Neither was their found
[38:20] anymore in heaven, their place in heaven
[38:22] anymore in heaven. And the great dragon
[38:25] was cast out, that old serpent called
[38:28] the devil, and Satan, which deceiveth
[38:31] the whole world. And he was cast out
[38:34] into the earth, and his angels were cast
[38:37] out with him. And I heard a loud voice
[38:40] saying in heaven, "Now is come salvation
[38:43] and strength, and the kingdom of our
[38:46] God, and the power of his Christ. For
[38:50] the accuser of our brethren is cast
[38:53] down, which did accuse them before our
[38:57] God day and night. And they overcame him
[39:03] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[39:06] of their testimony, and they loved not
[39:09] their lives unto death.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We believe it.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Revelations 5 and verse one. And I saw
[39:19] in the right hand of him that sat on the
[39:21] throne a book written within and on the
[39:24] backside sealed with seven seals. And
[39:26] right there the denominations are
[39:28] already lost.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Now they don't have a clue. But a bride
[39:33] has been has an open book.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; And I saw a strong angel procla
[39:38] proclaiming with a loud voice, who is
[39:42] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[39:45] seals thereof? No man in heaven, nor in
[39:50] earth, neither under the earth, was able
[39:52] to open the book, neither to look
[39:55] thereon. And I wept much because no man
[40:00] was found worthy to open the book and to
[40:02] read. No prophet, no angel, no king,
[40:08] &gt;&gt; no potentate, no ambassador, no
[40:11] Hollywood star,
[40:14] &gt;&gt; none of them.
[40:17] Amen.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; And one of the elders said unto me,
[40:22] "Weep not. Behold, the line of the tribe
[40:26] of Judah, the root of David, hath
[40:28] prevailed to open the book." Brother B
[40:30] said, "Our names," not only were the
[40:32] mysteries of God in there, but our names
[40:35] was in that book. and to loose the seven
[40:38] seals. And I beheld, and lo, in the
[40:41] midst of the throne, and of the four
[40:43] beasts, in the midst of the elders stood
[40:45] a lamb, as it had been slain, having
[40:48] seven horns, and seven eyes, which are
[40:50] the spirits of God, sent forth into the
[40:53] earth. And he came, and he took the book
[40:55] out of the right hand that sat upon the
[40:56] throne. And when he had taken the book,
[40:58] and the fourth beast, and the 24 elders,
[41:01] fell down before the lamb, having every
[41:03] one of them harps and golden vows full
[41:06] of odors, which are the prayers of the
[41:07] saints. And they sung a new song, and we
[41:10] can.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Thou art worthy to take the book.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; How many times we sing it, thou art
[41:17] worthy,
[41:18] &gt;&gt; thou art worthy, oh God, to take the
[41:21] book, and to open the seals thereof. For
[41:24] thou was slain and hast redeemed us to
[41:27] God by the blood and by every kindred
[41:30] tongue and people and nation.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love the Lord this
[41:34] evening?
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us?
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter nine just very very
[41:44] hastily.
[41:46] And it came to pass after eight days
[41:48] these sayings. He took Peter and John
[41:50] and James and went into the mountain to
[41:51] pray.
[41:53] And as he prayed, the fashion of his
[41:55] countenance was altered.
[41:58] And his raignment was white and
[41:59] glistening. And behold, there talked two
[42:01] men which were Moses and Elias
[42:06] who appeared in glory and spake of his
[42:08] decease
[42:10] which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
[42:14] I just want to lay a few foundation
[42:16] things here if I if I may.
[42:19] Here stands two representatives, the law
[42:22] and the prophets.
[42:24] Elijah being the elder servant, the very
[42:27] spirit of Christ himself.
[42:30] Moses being a man that is called the
[42:32] greatest prophet to ever live of the Old
[42:34] Testament. Here's a man that literally
[42:37] becomes the mouthpiece of God. Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Here's a man that the that he begins to
[42:43] write the first five books of the Bible
[42:45] and he goes back into Adam and he
[42:47] watches God create the heavens and the
[42:49] earth and and it was good and he watches
[42:52] the evolution of how God evolutes and
[42:54] how that he he creates every every seed
[43:00] every seed of every grass every flower.
[43:03] He watches the whole zodiac come into
[43:06] position. Moses is watching this and
[43:08] he's being anointed to write these
[43:10] things down, maybe not understanding
[43:13] even maybe a tenth of what he's even
[43:15] writing down. And then God begins to
[43:18] evolute even to the highest species,
[43:20] which was his very image. Let us make
[43:23] man in our own image. And he created
[43:26] Adam a spirit being. And and they had
[43:29] incredible fellowship. and and and he
[43:31] created him a perfect paradise for him
[43:33] to be the keeper over and to to to rule
[43:36] the atmosphere and the animals and and
[43:39] and we realize that there had been war
[43:41] in heaven and Satan was cast into the
[43:44] earth. So as an amateur god, he was the
[43:47] keeper of all of that. And so we realize
[43:50] as and I'm just going to make a leap
[43:52] here just now. He he we realize is he he
[43:56] takes his place with his wife. And
[44:00] brother Brandon said he was not
[44:02] deceived. His eyes were wide open. He
[44:04] takes his place with his wife in the
[44:08] fall.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Knowing that God would kill her. You see
[44:13] that was an attribute laying on the
[44:15] inside of Christ.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He longed to have a wife.
[44:22] He would be a kinsman redeemer
[44:25] &gt;&gt; and Adam would leave the presence of
[44:28] God. But before he would leave the
[44:30] presence of God, God would give him a
[44:33] covenant
[44:34] &gt;&gt; that the woman's seed will bruise the
[44:36] head of that serpent.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And God in in even the garden
[44:43] promises Calvary. Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; We heard last night as Adam and Eve are
[44:49] walking out of the garden and the bloody
[44:52] sheep skins are slapping around their
[44:54] legs and the blood is dripping down off
[44:57] off of them. God moves. And one place,
[45:01] Brother Brandham says, Brother Brandham
[45:03] says, "I'll go with you."
[45:10] &gt;&gt; I will go with you
[45:13] &gt;&gt; as a promise. I'll come as your kinsman
[45:16] redeemer. Adam, I'll restore you back.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; All of his rulership,
[45:25] all of his control. Adam knew never knew
[45:28] what it was to sweat. He never knew what
[45:31] it was to have an agony. He never knew
[45:33] what it was to have a backachche. He
[45:35] never knew what it was for the literally
[45:37] the the the grass to be and the and the
[45:40] thistles and the thorns. He never knew
[45:43] what it was to turn the ground. He never
[45:45] knew what it was to have animals to now
[45:48] turn to pray upon him.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; He never knew the things that you fight
[45:55] right here tonight.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; He never knew time element.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; He never had to be in a hurry.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; He never had to worry. He never had to
[46:06] to struggle with personal feelings.
[46:08] Amen.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; But when he leaves the Garden of Eden
[46:12] now, this this chain of sin begins to
[46:16] come upon his life.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[46:24] &gt;&gt; As a little child, we begin to read and
[46:26] brother Brown uses a text called
[46:28] Teaching on Moses.
[46:30] He begins to he begins to deal with us
[46:33] all as children.
[46:37] Just forgive me for taking just a little
[46:38] while to lay this in, but
[46:41] he begins to take a text of of of
[46:45] Moses's mother and father.
[46:49] They had now been in Egypt for about 400
[46:52] years.
[46:54] And it was more than a legend.
[46:56] And it was more than a story that God
[47:00] came to Abraham and sit with him lip to
[47:04] ear. and he blew a body and stepped in.
[47:08] This man having no father or mother
[47:11] &gt;&gt; and and God spoke to Abraham how their
[47:14] ch his children, how he would be the
[47:16] father of nations,
[47:18] how he would how that his children would
[47:21] go into to slavery into bondship
[47:25] and it would be about 400 years.
[47:28] But God promised that he would send them
[47:30] a deliverer.
[47:33] And so and so, but remember there's some
[47:35] covenant that is made with Abraham. Thy
[47:39] seed shall possess the gates of their
[47:41] enemy.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; All of this is laid in their mind and
[47:45] it's carried from one generation to
[47:47] another generation. And they begin to
[47:49] teach teach this to another generation
[47:52] as I read the text last night. I am the
[47:55] God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. I
[48:00] am the God of Jacob. I am the God of
[48:03] Joseph. And it came down 400 years. And
[48:07] brother Brandham said, Joseph, looking
[48:09] at his death, said, "Don't you bury me
[48:12] here.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Don't you bury me down here in Egypt,
[48:18] you carry my bones.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; You carry my bones back to the promised
[48:24] land."
[48:27] He said a many a many of Jewish slave
[48:31] Israelites would walk by walk by that
[48:34] lead casket
[48:37] &gt;&gt; and they'd lay their hands over on that
[48:40] lead casket
[48:42] and said Joseph's dry bones laying on
[48:46] the inside of that casket laying
[48:48] crumpled up in that casket said they'd
[48:51] lay their hands on that lead casket and
[48:53] with a promise in their heart.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; What are these days?
[49:02] &gt;&gt; We have a promise.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; We're not going to be down here in Egypt
[49:07] forever.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; This is not our forever existence.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; We're not going to be here forever.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; We didn't bury this in the ground. We've
[49:19] got this above ground that one of these
[49:21] days we're going to carry this coffin.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; He said they'd walk by with their their
[49:32] back with stripes all over where they
[49:35] had been beat by their taskmaster.
[49:39] They had struggled through their days.
[49:42] No doubt watching their family famish in
[49:44] many different ways.
[49:46] struggles of life, but they lay their
[49:49] hands on that casket.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; It was their covenant with God.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Our God,
[49:59] &gt;&gt; their covenant with God.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Was a man named Amra.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; He was Moses's father.
[50:13] A revelation be to strike in his heart.
[50:17] predestinated.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; He begin to feel the pull of the hour.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; And it was just more than a
[50:24] chronological order. But he begin to
[50:27] feel the pull of the hour and he begin
[50:30] when he come in from work, Brother Bram
[50:32] said he would climb up in his little
[50:33] attic and he would call on Jehovah.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; He would cry out to God.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; You promised.
[50:44] You promised us a deliverer.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; You promised my great great granddaddy
[50:50] Abraham.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; You promised Jacob. You promised Joseph.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; You promised me.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; It's good when we can get on our face
[51:07] &gt;&gt; and have a private interview with God.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; One night,
[51:16] one night while in prayer, an angel of
[51:19] the Lord came and gave him specific
[51:22] instructions.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; How that he was going to send the
[51:27] deliverer through his home.
[51:34] The scripture bears out the baby would
[51:37] be born.
[51:39] They couldn't keep the baby.
[51:42] because Pharaoh would kill it because it
[51:44] knew there was a certain time order.
[51:47] A deliverer was coming. He would kill
[51:50] the babies. So God has an incredible
[51:52] sense of humor.
[51:55] Said, "Put the baby
[51:57] in the basket. Put tar all over this
[52:00] basket. I want you to take it and put it
[52:02] in that crocodile infested waters."
[52:08] Gabriel, I I need you to come and stand
[52:11] on this basket.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; I need you to line up 10,000 angels up
[52:18] and down this water.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; I need you as this basket weaves its way
[52:26] down this waterway and the and the
[52:30] alligators comes up and and the other
[52:32] animals would come up to take a nip of
[52:34] it. Gabriel, you take your foot and you
[52:37] push them back down.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; No doubt they didn't have an idea. Those
[52:45] animals didn't have an idea that
[52:48] something could hit them like that.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; You see, they held dominion,
[52:56] but this little lad inside of this
[52:58] basket
[53:00] &gt;&gt; was a prophet from his birth.
[53:06] He'd wind up in the house of Pharaoh.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; He would grow up with personal ambition.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; With incredible education.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; He would sit at the right hand of
[53:16] Pharaoh and kind of even become an
[53:18] architect and an engineer and and be
[53:21] able to be in the in the decision making
[53:23] of how things work.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; But his mother had laid a foundation.
[53:31] She had laid a foundation and told him
[53:33] of a testimony.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And she'd carry him through.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; She'd carry him through the scriptures.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; And she'd talk about Jehovah meeting
[53:42] Abraham who was his shield, his buckler,
[53:46] the name changer. Jacob wrestled with
[53:49] the angel of the Lord.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Saw a ladder come down.
[53:54] Hallelujah. Joseph, Joseph and all his
[53:58] portrayal how that he came and and and
[54:00] all of that and he began to lay in a
[54:03] prison 19 years
[54:05] &gt;&gt; listen not knowing what he was doing but
[54:08] God preserved life for us
[54:12] &gt;&gt; we've been here 400 brother said and due
[54:15] to the lapse of the condition of the age
[54:17] there was a lapse of time he said
[54:19] because it was so wicked and he said and
[54:22] he says he says now no doubt She laid it
[54:26] in his heart. And let me just say this
[54:28] to you. Many times we as parents do our
[54:31] very best to lay it in your hearts
[54:35] &gt;&gt; and it becomes quotes and scriptures and
[54:38] pictures on the wall and powerful
[54:40] sermons. But we need God to take that
[54:44] word and make it live. Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; The scripture says in Hebrews chapter
[54:55] 11, by faith Moses,
[55:00] refused to be called the son of
[55:02] Pharaoh's daughter,
[55:05] choosing rather to suffer the
[55:06] affliction.
[55:08] You know, when Paul is is anointed to
[55:12] write that scripture,
[55:15] if we're not careful, we don't take in
[55:17] the 40 years of the human struggle.
[55:24] 40 years of molding,
[55:26] &gt;&gt; getting Egypt out of Moses,
[55:30] &gt;&gt; 40 years of teaching Moses a lesson,
[55:33] &gt;&gt; cuz God's not in a great big hurry.
[55:35] Right.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; We get in a hurry. God's not in a great
[55:39] big hurry.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; He's got to get a man willing to submit
[55:44] himself totally to God.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Before he can send him with a donkey and
[55:50] his wife and a child and go into Egypt
[55:53] as a one-man invasion, he's got to have
[55:56] him 100% submitted to God.
[56:04] Now, now we realize
[56:07] they were under the blood of bulls and
[56:09] goats.
[56:13] He could feel the spirit of God, but he
[56:16] didn't have something in him to make him
[56:18] live, right?
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Get anointed.
[56:23] But we can very quickly point pick out
[56:26] in the scriptures that Moses was
[56:28] hightempered.
[56:30] Moses was stubborn. Probably nobody in
[56:33] the building suffers from any of those
[56:35] things.
[56:38] But Moses as he begins to watch how God
[56:42] had with had a relationship with Adam,
[56:45] no doubt he envied that position.
[56:51] And in his entire life, whether it was
[56:53] standing before Pharaoh and watching his
[56:56] staff be turned into a serpent and
[57:00] swallow up their serpents as he as he
[57:03] calls for plagues and watches those
[57:05] things happen. As he goes to to a red
[57:08] sea and watches watches God preserve two
[57:12] million people and open up the sea to
[57:16] which to which they walk across on dry
[57:18] land. Even theologians today still can't
[57:21] get that figured out. But with our God,
[57:23] he can do anything.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Go across and go through a desert and
[57:29] travel 40 years in that desert. Never,
[57:33] as we said last night, never building a
[57:35] Walmart, which is phenomenal. Never
[57:38] having to buy new shoes, never having to
[57:40] have new clothes. Are you with me now?
[57:43] Amen.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; But listen, he watched all of that
[57:47] humanity come and he heard their
[57:49] murmuring. He heard their complaining.
[57:52] He saw their idol worship.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even constructing the temple
[57:58] exactly like he had saw it in heaven and
[58:01] watch the continent sending of God come
[58:03] down. A pillar of fire, a cloud. He had
[58:06] been in the very presence of God when
[58:08] God took his finger and wrote upon the
[58:11] stones. Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; He had been there, brother Tim, when God
[58:16] held him in the cliff of a rock,
[58:20] &gt;&gt; because it was Moses's desire,
[58:24] &gt;&gt; it was his desire to see God,
[58:30] &gt;&gt; after all that God did,
[58:33] &gt;&gt; through his life,
[58:34] &gt;&gt; through his hands,
[58:37] &gt;&gt; through his vocal cords,
[58:39] &gt;&gt; he still wanted to see God. Amen.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; You know, Moses struggled with something
[58:53] that me and you struggle with
[58:56] one another.
[59:00] Shock.
[59:04] Come on.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; It disappointed him to hear murmuring.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; It disappointed him
[59:17] to see people
[59:19] do the wrong things.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; But yet in his disappointment, God says,
[59:28] "Pull back Moses. I'm going to destroy
[59:30] him." He said, "Hey, hey, wait a minute.
[59:32] They're your people,
[59:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:36] &gt;&gt; They're your children.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; And the same guy that will stand in the
[59:40] breach.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Satan anoints his flesh.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Just like he anoints your flesh.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; And in that crisis, you you're not
[59:53] married. Some of you are not married.
[59:54] But let me just say this to you. You
[59:56] will overcome every devil in hell and
[59:58] then go home.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:02] And the queen of your life
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; who has changed diapers all day long.
[1:00:09] Goo and God and
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; will push the wrong button.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And as much as you have deity laying on
[1:00:24] the inside of you, your flesh
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; will disappoint you.
[1:00:34] You see, there's a dispute for your body
[1:00:36] going on.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Moses, no doubt.
[1:00:44] No doubt doubt in my mind. Listen, once
[1:00:47] he left his house, which Brother Ram
[1:00:50] says it must have been a time back there
[1:00:51] on the back side of the desert.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Zapora with a high temper. Let me just
[1:00:57] say this to you. Him being a prophet
[1:00:59] didn't impress her a whole lot.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; I read a story here a while back that
[1:01:08] there was a president of America back in
[1:01:11] the 30s. And I don't call his name. I'm
[1:01:13] not here for politics.
[1:01:16] But his mother-in-law always hated him.
[1:01:19] He never could please his mother-in-law.
[1:01:22] She thought he wasn't good enough for
[1:01:24] her daughter. here. He was a president
[1:01:27] of the United States.
[1:01:30] He was a statesman. And yet he wasn't
[1:01:33] good enough for her daughter. He said
[1:01:35] there was never peace in his own home.
[1:01:37] I'm sure Moses kind of felt like that a
[1:01:39] day or two in his life.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Is there a spot anywhere where there's
[1:01:43] peace at?
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; I got a reason. Here we go.
[1:01:54] Two men are at this conference.
[1:01:56] The other one is is Elijah.
[1:02:00] He was a man born of woman
[1:02:04] just like you and I.
[1:02:06] Sins of the fathers passed down to him.
[1:02:10] Spirit of God anoints his life even from
[1:02:14] a child.
[1:02:16] He raises up
[1:02:18] and God anoints him in an incredible
[1:02:20] way.
[1:02:22] You see, when Joshua destroyed the
[1:02:24] children of Israel destroyed
[1:02:27] destroyed Jericho,
[1:02:29] Joshua stood there and cursed the man
[1:02:33] that would rebuild
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; this city.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; It so happens in Elijah's days, there's
[1:02:41] a political uprising that comes on the
[1:02:43] scene. Israel is in a backsliding
[1:02:46] condition and Ahab goes to the throne
[1:02:50] and he marries an idolatrous woman named
[1:02:53] Jezebel.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; And one of the things that Ahab does
[1:02:56] that brings the judgment of God on him,
[1:02:59] he commisss a man to go and rebuild
[1:03:02] Jericho. And if you'll notice within
[1:03:05] just only just a couple of scriptures,
[1:03:07] here comes Elijah.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's a covenant written
[1:03:13] with Joshua. I'll curse the man.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; I'll curse the man that rebuilds the
[1:03:19] city. There's a reason. Just up on that
[1:03:22] hill is going to be the mount of
[1:03:24] transfiguration.
[1:03:26] And so here here here comes a here comes
[1:03:30] Ahab and he has it rebuilt. Has him to
[1:03:33] re start reconstructing. And here comes
[1:03:35] the prophet of God and he says it will
[1:03:39] not even rain or do fall until I call
[1:03:43] for it.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Immediately he becomes unpopular.
[1:03:58] You see, the nation had came to a spot
[1:04:00] where it had forgot God.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; And they had begun to build strange
[1:04:05] denominational idoltor worshippers.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, they had their bail.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, they had their emotional time. Oh,
[1:04:13] they had their great speakers.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; They had men that was incredible
[1:04:19] speakers that could come and stand. They
[1:04:21] had schools of the prophets and and they
[1:04:24] would come. But God sent them a
[1:04:26] mouthpiece called Elijah.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; He was the very voice of God through a
[1:04:33] human vessel.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; But listen, even in that voice, here was
[1:04:38] a man. Here was a man that was moody.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Here's a man that struggle with his own
[1:04:45] flesh
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; even after the day. And you know these
[1:04:49] stories very well, but I'm just
[1:04:50] rehearsing them just for a few minutes.
[1:04:52] Even after after he stands before Israel
[1:04:56] and declares unto them,
[1:04:59] let's see who really is God.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Let's see who really is God.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Let's see who God is with.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; If he is with Baal, let's all serve him.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:16] Let the God that answers by fire.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Watch what they do. They build their
[1:05:24] altars.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Listen. And their altars is very close
[1:05:28] to God's altar.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; And they get and they begin to worship
[1:05:32] and they begin to whoop it up. They
[1:05:35] begin to cry. And Elijah gets anointed.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; It's dangerous when a man of God gets
[1:05:42] anointed.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. He gets anointed and he begins to
[1:05:46] make fun of him.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Your God must be on vacation.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Your God's not answering you. You need
[1:05:55] to scream a little bit louder.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; And they did everything and begin to cut
[1:06:02] themselves.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; And Elijah, when they were done and they
[1:06:06] were exhausted and their time was up,
[1:06:09] Elijah tore down their altar.
[1:06:12] Hallelujah. He tore down their their
[1:06:15] idolatrous worship.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; We need to tear down every bit of
[1:06:20] denominational ideas,
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; every school of thinking. Are you with
[1:06:24] me?
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; The things that we hang on to that's not
[1:06:28] according to the word of God. The
[1:06:30] carryover that just tear it down.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Just completely surrender ourselves to
[1:06:36] the word of God.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; He tore down those altars. He rebuilt
[1:06:41] that altar. Let me just say this. The
[1:06:43] greatest thing you can do in your home.
[1:06:45] If your home has lost its revival, if
[1:06:48] it's lost its prayer, if it's lost the
[1:06:50] voice of the prophet of God has become a
[1:06:53] stranger in your house, rebuild the
[1:06:55] altar.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Rebuild the altar.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; How long has it been?
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; How long has it been since you felt the
[1:07:07] presence of God in your home? I'm not
[1:07:09] just talking about at church. I'm not
[1:07:11] just talking about in your pew. How long
[1:07:13] has it been since he came?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm going to preach to you. Here we
[1:07:24] are.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; I tell you what we'll do.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; We'll buy a book for our financials and
[1:07:32] we'll we'll we'll we'll go this guy's
[1:07:34] got a great idea and he's got an answer
[1:07:36] and it's got 500 pages in it. We'll give
[1:07:39] $50 for it. And he's only got a theory.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; We'll go to the self-help sections.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; And we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll read
[1:07:51] what a psychologist says,
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; perverted in his mind. And we'll begin
[1:07:56] to think how to raise children.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; If we're not careful, we'll go to some
[1:08:01] some trinitarian
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; school of thinking. how to raise
[1:08:08] children.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And before long, Dr. Dobson's in our
[1:08:12] home.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Dr. Dobson's ruling our lives. Are you
[1:08:19] with me now?
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Some denominational idea. We're not
[1:08:23] raising denominational chickens here.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, but I want to keep my
[1:08:29] children out of drugs. And I I want to
[1:08:31] keep them away from the wrong kind of
[1:08:32] friends. I want them to get the spirit
[1:08:34] of God. I want them to know this
[1:08:36] message. Keep them in the presence of
[1:08:39] God.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Keep them in the presence of God. Your
[1:08:44] home was given to you.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; It was given to you. Are you with me
[1:08:48] now? I'm a littlehead now. It was given
[1:08:51] to you for your sanctuary. When you come
[1:08:54] home from the day and all the cares of
[1:08:56] life are over with, you come in, you
[1:08:58] walk in, you're in fellowship with your
[1:09:00] wife, you two come into relationship
[1:09:03] with God.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Bring your children into that atmosphere
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; that they call this place home and not a
[1:09:11] prison.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; In the message, there should never be a
[1:09:17] marriage counseling seminars.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Our home should be so strong by the
[1:09:22] presence of God.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just say we should
[1:09:30] not tolerate even losing one of our
[1:09:32] children to drugs. one of our children
[1:09:35] to the world.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, I want every one of
[1:09:40] you to make it.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for a percentage to go
[1:09:46] out of here. I want every one of you.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not satisfied.
[1:10:07] They find Elijah in a cave.
[1:10:13] A cave
[1:10:15] despondent.
[1:10:18] And only God can bring him out of his
[1:10:20] depression.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; I know nobody here suffers from
[1:10:24] depression.
[1:10:28] nervousness,
[1:10:31] but they're chains from hell.
[1:10:38] God would find his prophet under a
[1:10:40] juniper tree,
[1:10:44] under a juniper tree. Here he was and he
[1:10:47] was praying.
[1:10:49] You know, sometimes we as human beings,
[1:10:51] we would quit if we could.
[1:10:55] Yes, sir. We'd quit if we could.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; If we could quit, we'd quit because
[1:11:00] that's our natural flesh.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; We We say, "I have had enough.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; I have had enough."
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Elijah
[1:11:12] got himself under a juniper tree. And he
[1:11:15] began to cry out to God, "Let me die
[1:11:18] like my fathers." God didn't have
[1:11:20] plannings for dying ever in his life.
[1:11:23] Amen.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; You see, in God's big picture, Elijah's
[1:11:29] never going to die.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; But here's a man
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; that hasn't seen, I'm going to ride off
[1:11:36] in a chariot in a few days.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; He hasn't caught the revelation. So,
[1:11:40] he's praying completely against the will
[1:11:43] of God. Let me die.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Let me die like my fathers.
[1:11:52] And God calls
[1:11:54] the angels.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; And he searches all through heaven.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; And he says, I want the angel with the
[1:12:06] softest hands.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; I want the angel with the softest hands.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; I want you to come here and I want you
[1:12:16] to rub Elijah's brow.
[1:12:20] He's having a bad day.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; I want you to rubbish blow.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; I want the best cook in all of heaven.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; He searched through Virginia.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Through the Shannondoa Valley.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; It was close.
[1:12:43] He went through Chef Raymond. It was
[1:12:46] close.
[1:12:49] He went through your community and it
[1:12:51] was close
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; and he found the angel.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; That was the best cake maker.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; And said, "Bake him some cakes."
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Let me show you what a condition Elijah
[1:13:07] was in.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; God had to wake him up and serve him by
[1:13:10] angels. And he went right back to sleep.
[1:13:14] wake him up and serve him by angels. And
[1:13:16] he went right back to sleep.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; They preached some incredible sermons
[1:13:26] while they were on in life.
[1:13:33] Forgive me for my folly for a couple of
[1:13:34] minutes here,
[1:13:38] but today
[1:13:42] the lamb of God
[1:13:46] has felt to go up on the side of a
[1:13:48] mountain.
[1:13:52] And he takes three witnesses,
[1:13:57] Peter, James, and John.
[1:14:01] And they go up on the side of the
[1:14:02] mountain and God begins to
[1:14:07] talk with Jesus the man
[1:14:11] because now the blood of bulls and goats
[1:14:13] that session's over with.
[1:14:16] And John has declared, "Behold the lamb
[1:14:20] of God that takes away the sins of the
[1:14:24] world." Right.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; All of the strains of humanity,
[1:14:30] he's going to pay for
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; he is going to buy the abstract title
[1:14:36] deed.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; He's going to purchase it.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; When the angel screams, "Who is worthy?"
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; No man was worthy.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Boaz plays the part.
[1:14:49] Joseph plays the part of our Lord going
[1:14:53] through the prison
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; being sold for 30 pieces of silver.
[1:14:58] Jonah goes into the belly of a whale.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Three days.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; All of them were tights.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; But today, here stands the man,
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; the man Christ Jesus.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; He has been tempted with everything.
[1:15:19] Hallelujah.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Every sickness, every every devil of
[1:15:24] temptation has been thrown at him.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Moses stands there.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; I cannot even fathom
[1:15:40] the feeling
[1:15:42] of preaching
[1:15:45] to Jesus.
[1:15:47] Few
[1:15:53] weeks ago, this touched my heart. This
[1:15:55] section touched my heart so much it
[1:15:58] became unreal
[1:16:02] because it became so real to me that I
[1:16:04] am every time I walk in a pull pit I am
[1:16:08] addressing the queen of heaven.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; I am encouraging her.
[1:16:16] I am speaking to her in human flesh.
[1:16:20] Every prophet wanted to live here.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Every one of them wanted to take the
[1:16:25] place to stand here in our places
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; and encourage you and inspire you
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; and take the lips words of a prophet and
[1:16:35] repeat them to you
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; and tell you that you are the abstract
[1:16:41] title deed holders here today.
[1:16:44] It is bought and bought and paid for.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And here stands Moses preaching to Jesus
[1:16:52] the man.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Listen, the anointing of God is going to
[1:16:57] leave him in a few days.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; He's going to go through the garden of
[1:17:01] Gethsemane.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; He's going to be beaten. He's going to
[1:17:04] go through a trial. The people that he
[1:17:07] sent to is going to hate him. They're
[1:17:08] going to mock him. They're going to spit
[1:17:10] on him.
[1:17:12] They've got to take the word. Psalms 22
[1:17:15] about Calvary. Isaiah 53. You were
[1:17:18] wounded for our transgressions, bruised
[1:17:21] for our iniquities.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; We're counting on you.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:35] And if he doesn't make it through it,
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; and Satan is going to take this
[1:17:40] vengeance out on him,
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; are you with me?
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to bring it full circle
[1:17:49] here just for a moment. Listen, the
[1:17:52] accuser of our brethren has stood there
[1:17:55] and he's battled. He's battled Moses.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; He's battled Elijah. He was in the
[1:18:02] garden with Adam. He battled Joseph
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; 19 years in a prison. He battled him
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; and told him, "Your vision's not real.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; They forgot about you.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; He battled Jonah in a well."
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; He battled Ezel.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; He battled Jeremiah.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; He battled Isaiah as he laid naked
[1:18:29] beside the gate. Yes,
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; he battled all of those men of God.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; But today, here stands the man,
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; that can pay the price.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; We heard him forgive a woman
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; the first night.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; He is the only one ever to have that
[1:18:51] kind of authority.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Everybody else could only project
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; to a lamb of God.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But he is the man,
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah,
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; that can look at another human being and
[1:19:07] say, "Thy sins, though they be many,
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; thy sins, though they be many."
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; A lot of people could say that words,
[1:19:22] but it was not revoked.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Thy sins, though they be many,
[1:19:29] forgiven.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Forgiven.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; You may be sitting here tonight and
[1:19:35] you're tarnished by every sin in the
[1:19:37] world. And Satan has did his very best
[1:19:39] because he watches you. You're born of a
[1:19:42] of a message, mom and dad. And he begins
[1:19:45] to battle you because he's had to fight
[1:19:47] your grandma and granddaddy that were
[1:19:48] believers. He's had to fight. Are you
[1:19:50] with me now?
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And listen, he knows without the new
[1:19:53] birth, that's the best chance for him to
[1:19:55] get you.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; So he wars against you. He's a squatter
[1:19:59] in your humanity.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; He wrestles with your desires of your
[1:20:04] sexuality. He wrestles with your
[1:20:06] entertainment. He wrestles with your
[1:20:08] human ability as a sports star. He
[1:20:10] wrestles. Listen, there's women said,
[1:20:12] young girls sitting here tonight that
[1:20:14] Hollywood would love to have.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; You've got virtues that little girls out
[1:20:19] there marred many years ago.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Some of you are model quality that could
[1:20:25] run a runway. But God who is rich in
[1:20:27] mercy,
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:20:32] hallelujah, protected you from this lays
[1:20:36] and condition.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; When there's no more Hollywood stars,
[1:20:43] you'll be there
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; as a daughter of God. When there's no
[1:20:48] more sports stars, you'll be there.
[1:20:58] I can hear him quote Isaiah 43. When you
[1:21:01] go through the waters, I'll be with you.
[1:21:03] When you go through the flood, I'll be
[1:21:05] with you. When you go through the fire,
[1:21:06] I'll be with you.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; I can hear him quote Isaiah 54, "No
[1:21:12] weapon that is formed against thee shall
[1:21:15] prosper."
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; The word was preaching to the word.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What anchors me tonight?
[1:21:22] It's not my emotions. Yes, sir.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; It's not my feelings. It's what he said
[1:21:28] about me.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:48] They quoted the scriptures.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; They quoted it over and over and over.
[1:21:53] They quoted it to him.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said he had to look at the
[1:21:58] word to see what it said about him.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; You got to look at the word and see what
[1:22:02] it says about you.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I heard something this morning said you
[1:22:07] got to catch it for yourself.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; You got to catch it for yourself.
[1:22:11] I told my boys, I told my little girl
[1:22:13] that's sitting here tonight, just
[1:22:15] because I'm a preacher, just because
[1:22:16] you've been raised in this home, you've
[1:22:18] got to know God for yourself.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; You've got to spend time with the voice
[1:22:24] of the prophet of God.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; I'm asked often, why don't you take your
[1:22:33] services, brother? Let me just say my
[1:22:35] voice is not real important, but his
[1:22:37] voice is of ultimate importance.
[1:22:39] God chose his voice.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; We spend time. Oh, but brother, I just
[1:22:45] stay home and listen to tapes. That's
[1:22:46] not what the scripture says. So much the
[1:22:49] more you see that day approaching.
[1:22:51] Assemble yourself together.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Assemble together. Come to church
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; when you don't feel like it.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Gather yourselves together. Bring your
[1:23:05] licks of fire.
[1:23:12] Hallelujah.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'm not going to go with
[1:23:16] that bunch of hypocrites. Did you stop
[1:23:18] going to Walmart?
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Did you quit going to work?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; The hypocrite may very well be you. Just
[1:23:34] get right with God.
[1:23:37] Hallelujah.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; I can imagine their energy standing here
[1:23:48] and the and the serpent's watching this
[1:23:51] scene.
[1:23:53] He's watching the scene.
[1:23:57] Wait a minute.
[1:23:59] What's Moses doing here?
[1:24:04] When he left the earth, he had a temper.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. I own his body.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute here. I have a claim on
[1:24:18] him.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; The man standing beside him of Elijah.
[1:24:23] Wait a minute.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; He was moody.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; He prayed to die.
[1:24:34] I've got it written right here.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; I got a whole Raven list on him.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; He acted out in his flesh.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; When he got under pressure, he was real
[1:24:47] moody.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; When he was having a bad day,
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; look what Moses did. He struck the rock
[1:24:56] twice.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; I got a claim.
[1:25:05] I'm at your house and your address
[1:25:07] standing in your kitchen right now.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Now, some of you are thinking, I wish
[1:25:18] they'd had a teacher in here.
[1:25:31] Wait a minute here.
[1:25:34] These men operated in their flesh.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Where's his body at?
[1:25:43] I watched him walk up on the mountain.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I watched you rapture Elijah
[1:25:50] and throw his mantel down to Elisha.
[1:25:52] Hey, but he had the same attitude. He
[1:25:55] called 42. He called he called she bears
[1:25:58] down and destroyed 42 children
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; twice.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; I got some claims here.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Hang with me.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Hang with me. I have some claims on
[1:26:11] their body.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; I've got some claims.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Trophies.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; These are trophies.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Like Samson was a trophy in a mealhouse.
[1:26:26] He'd like to have you as a trophy
[1:26:28] tonight.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; He'd like to have you as a trophy
[1:26:32] tonight.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; But they were standing there taking the
[1:26:35] word. This is what you must accomplish.
[1:26:38] We're dependent on you.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; There's been prophets, prophets, kings,
[1:26:43] and all of those. But you're the lamb of
[1:26:45] God
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; that takes away the sins of the world.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; He must go through the garden of
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Gethsemane. Listen, John knew all was
[1:26:57] lost if nobody's worthy, if nobody steps
[1:27:00] forth.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz all men are fallible.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Ain't it amazing when you get around
[1:27:12] your friends, you just love them to
[1:27:13] death start out with, and then all of a
[1:27:15] sudden you find out they're human.
[1:27:20] You marry a woman and she's the most
[1:27:22] beautiful thing you've ever seen in your
[1:27:25] life. Give it 30 years.
[1:27:33] You marry a man and you say, "My
[1:27:35] troubles are over." And then he goes to
[1:27:38] sleep and he snores like a huskarn a
[1:27:39] chainsaw.
[1:27:48] Your children are perfect until
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; until
[1:27:56] then they act like their mama.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Little boy walks into his mama one day
[1:28:10] and forgive me. walks into his mama.
[1:28:13] I'll have you relax just a minute. Some
[1:28:15] of you want tense up on me. Little boy
[1:28:16] walks into his mama. Says, "Mama, where
[1:28:19] did we come from?" She began to tell
[1:28:21] him, "God created the heavens and the
[1:28:23] earth and he created Adam
[1:28:26] and we came from God."
[1:28:29] He walks into his daddy still asking
[1:28:32] questions, says, "Daddy, where' we come
[1:28:33] from?"
[1:28:35] Well, the way I read it, we came from
[1:28:37] monkeys.
[1:28:40] There was an evolution that took place
[1:28:42] and we came from monkeys. He walks back
[1:28:45] into mom and he says, "Mom, I'm really
[1:28:47] confused. I'm really confused. You tell
[1:28:50] me we came from God and he says we come
[1:28:52] from monkeys." She said, "Well, I was
[1:28:53] talking about my side of the family and
[1:28:55] he's talking about his side of the
[1:28:56] family."
[1:28:59] I'm sorry.
[1:29:12] Believe it or not, some of you thought
[1:29:13] that
[1:29:23] we have a perfect message.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; The lamb himself came to this
[1:29:31] generation. Amen.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; The mighty angel came down and
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; sealed a covenant with you and I.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Gave us the unfolded word that had been
[1:29:41] sealed up for thousands of years.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; And God opened up his mind.
[1:29:49] Every question that in your
[1:29:52] denominational thinking, in your
[1:29:54] educational thinking, every question you
[1:29:57] could ask was answered
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; under this open word.
[1:30:03] Amen.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; We we talk about living in a bride age
[1:30:06] and elected age,
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; but we're here living in Leosa,
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; realizing that it that that bride age
[1:30:15] simply needs a m means of maturity of
[1:30:17] his wife,
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; the queen.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; And yet here we sat with the struggle
[1:30:23] and the dispute for our body.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham kind of simply answered
[1:30:29] this whole thing in the greatest battle
[1:30:30] that's ever fought. If you missed
[1:30:33] Brother Tim's teaching the other
[1:30:34] morning, it answered incredible
[1:30:36] questions, I'm sure, in many of your
[1:30:38] minds to understand that your DNA and
[1:30:41] your father's problems pass right down
[1:30:44] into your flesh.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; And Satan is a as a squatter, he
[1:30:49] believes that he legally owns your body.
[1:30:53] and he will wrestle in your mind because
[1:30:56] that's his right to do
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; because he and God made a decision where
[1:31:01] we're going to war at
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; and they decided to do it in your mind.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; This is the word the war takes place.
[1:31:09] But simply put, here you are bombarded
[1:31:11] in Leosa, which the scripture says is
[1:31:14] rich. They believe they're rich. They're
[1:31:17] increased with goods and they have need
[1:31:19] of nothing.
[1:31:20] You don't live in an age of martyrdom to
[1:31:23] where that there's just very few
[1:31:24] Christians. But you live in an age where
[1:31:26] everybody's born again.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; You live in an age where there's
[1:31:29] churches on every corner.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; You live in an age to where there's
[1:31:33] people that look a whole lot like you in
[1:31:35] a lot of respects.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; And they say, "We're religious as well.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; We go to church."
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; And before long, they're intermingling.
[1:31:46] And before long, their perverted births
[1:31:48] and their perverted doctrines and their
[1:31:50] perverted religions, if we're not
[1:31:52] careful, begins to influence our lives.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Before long, we we bring in easy
[1:31:58] belieism and we believe, you know, as
[1:32:00] parents, we don't want to make it so
[1:32:02] hard on our children. We want them to
[1:32:04] have a good bed and we want them to have
[1:32:05] good tennis shoes and we want them to
[1:32:07] have good pants and even if they do tear
[1:32:09] holes in them and we want them to have
[1:32:10] good clothes. We want them to have good
[1:32:12] jobs. And when they come to church, we
[1:32:14] feel like that, you know, don't be so
[1:32:16] tough on them.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Don't be legalistic with them. You know,
[1:32:22] just kind of ease up. You know, it's a
[1:32:23] new day.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And before long, if we're not careful,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; we're substituting the new birth
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; for saying God sent a prophet
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; for believing the message and putting
[1:32:37] doctrines in the right orders. And and
[1:32:39] before long, we're just coming sitting
[1:32:41] in a pew. If we pay our ti, we're good.
[1:32:43] You know, if we show up once a month,
[1:32:44] we're good. Are you with me now?
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're no longer in brush
[1:32:52] harbors now. Now we got fine buildings.
[1:32:54] And we've all got fine buildings now.
[1:32:56] But we've got fine buildings. We've got
[1:32:58] we've got easier seats to set on. Now
[1:33:00] we've got choirs. Brother Brandham said,
[1:33:02] now we've got great musicians. We got
[1:33:05] good song leaders. And sometimes we've
[1:33:07] got good preachers. So happen not
[1:33:08] tonight. But we've got good preachers,
[1:33:10] anointed men of God to take the word.
[1:33:12] And if we're not careful, we'll allow it
[1:33:14] to become common to us.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; We'll sit in the pew and nod our head or
[1:33:21] we'll we'll let somebody else do our
[1:33:23] worshiping for us.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Because there is a dispute over our
[1:33:28] body.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; This piece of clay that we're wrestling
[1:33:32] with.
[1:33:42] We'll forget our children are eagles.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be a whole lot longer,
[1:33:48] but you just hang right with me.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; We'll forget our children are eagles
[1:33:52] like we're eagles.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; And you can't break the egg for them.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; You cannot break the egg for them.
[1:34:02] They are born eagles.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; But they are going to have to fight
[1:34:08] their way out of the egg.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You just can't peck a
[1:34:16] hole and say, "Here, come here, baby.
[1:34:18] Come here, baby." You can't learn them
[1:34:20] the way. You can't give them a learned
[1:34:22] behavior.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; They're predestinated eagles.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; They're born eagles. They're not born
[1:34:30] chickens and buzzers and crows.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; We're different from our birth.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; God watched over us.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're sitting here tonight
[1:34:40] and say, "Well, Brother Ron, God ain't
[1:34:41] never did nothing for me." God watched
[1:34:43] over your natural state
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; all the way since Adam through wars,
[1:34:49] through plagues, through turmals,
[1:34:51] through earthquakes, natural disasters.
[1:34:56] And every time seeds came forth, that
[1:34:59] predestinated seed came carrying in your
[1:35:01] body.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; God took a picture of you before the
[1:35:04] foundation of the world. He knew how
[1:35:06] tall you'd be, how ugly you'd be, what
[1:35:09] color eyes you'd have.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; He knew the strains that you would
[1:35:16] wrestle with.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; He knew the nervousness that you would
[1:35:19] wrestle with. He knew the complexes
[1:35:21] you'd wrestle with. He knew the sins of
[1:35:23] the fathers would be passed down to you.
[1:35:26] But he put something on the inside of
[1:35:28] you.
[1:35:30] He put something in there that would
[1:35:32] give you overcoming power.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Once it is ignited,
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah. Once ignited,
[1:35:58] Hallelujah.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; I'm doing my best to behave.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; But you see, Satan don't have a long to
[1:36:10] work.
[1:36:13] And let me just let me just use a term
[1:36:16] he used this morning. Digress. I think
[1:36:19] it means to go backwards.
[1:36:26] Satan watched your fathers and mothers.
[1:36:32] And some of us don't have a real popular
[1:36:34] family tree.
[1:36:39] you go far back
[1:36:41] in it, you know, automatically say,
[1:36:43] "Uhuh, I don't want to go no further.
[1:36:46] My uncle's not Winston Churchill."
[1:36:49] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's not
[1:36:52] the King of England. Wait a minute. It's
[1:36:54] a I I don't believe I want to go back
[1:36:56] anymore.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I was born of Charles
[1:37:02] and Ella Brandom.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; That's my earthly mother and father."
[1:37:06] Right?
[1:37:08] He said, "I'm not so proud of my family
[1:37:10] tree,
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; But I am of my heavenly father,
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; I have a good mom and daddy and a good
[1:37:20] dad-in-law and good mother-in-law and I
[1:37:21] had a good great granddaddy and all down
[1:37:23] through the age. I was very fortunate.
[1:37:25] But they yet poured down into my flesh
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; some strains of temper and stubbornness.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:37:36] the things that you struggle with.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; And Satan looks at you and he says, "I
[1:37:42] have a claim.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; I have a claim." He hears you
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; when you're home fussing.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; He hears you when you're quarreling.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; You can sit on these pews and listen,
[1:37:56] there's sometimes you have to struggle
[1:37:59] your way to raise your hand and praise
[1:38:00] the Lord.
[1:38:04] You have to struggle to say amen.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; But you know if you've got the Holy
[1:38:09] Ghost, you'll say amen to every word of
[1:38:11] God.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; And you know that word is true.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; You know that word is delivering you.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; And so you echo a response to God.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; You come to wash his feet. You come to
[1:38:25] bring him a fresh drink.
[1:38:28] But Satan will bombard you with
[1:38:29] commonness and and familiarity and
[1:38:32] knowing one another.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; He'll bombard you
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; with looking way off yonder somewhere
[1:38:44] else.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Grass is always greener on the other
[1:38:48] side. That's right.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; He'll bombard you with job offers,
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; trying to get you out of church,
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; friends, and pull you this way and more
[1:38:59] entertaining situations on Sunday and
[1:39:01] Wednesday night.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; And before long, you come up missing
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; and before long, you're backsliding.
[1:39:11] Yes, sir.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Backsliding is not sitting in a bar
[1:39:14] somewhere or another,
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; not at some scene somewhere or another,
[1:39:17] but you can sit right there and
[1:39:19] backslide.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; When you refuse to go any further with
[1:39:22] God
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; when you become satisfied, I've got
[1:39:26] enough.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; People never better move up with me.
[1:39:29] That's a good stage of backsliding.
[1:39:45] We live in an age that's very
[1:39:47] convenient.
[1:39:51] Our internet is great. I mean, we're
[1:39:52] thrilled about it,
[1:39:55] but it's also one of the most
[1:39:57] destructive things that we can have.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; We can get up and say good morning to
[1:40:02] the whole world.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; I'm getting ready to take a shower.
[1:40:07] I have a flat tire. I'm late for my
[1:40:10] doctor's appointment.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to church.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; We can watch our favorite preacher no
[1:40:18] matter where he's at.
[1:40:27] If we're not careful,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; we'll create a profile
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; and the enemy will get right in and
[1:40:35] we'll begin to chat with people from
[1:40:37] yester year.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; They'll begin to remind us of things
[1:40:41] that if we're not careful, our flesh
[1:40:43] begins to be pulled towards.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; And we'll dig up bones that should not
[1:40:47] have been dug up.
[1:40:51] Are you with me? I'm just
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; I got a good list here. You just hang
[1:40:54] right with me.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; If it we aren't careful.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; We lose our edge going to church.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; We lose our stimulation.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; We forget that we were oracles to built
[1:41:12] to worship God.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; We were built to have a prayer meeting.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. to enter into the shakana glory of
[1:41:20] God.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; And before long, we're just busy.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Before long, 24 hours slips away from
[1:41:28] us.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Before long, we're prosperous in our
[1:41:32] jobs.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; And we can make our own way.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; We didn't get a position at church to
[1:41:47] preach. So now we've got one created
[1:41:50] women preachers.
[1:41:55] Before long, we're putting pictures on
[1:41:57] the internet that of sacred moments.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Before long, the enemy leads us to the
[1:42:05] wrong sites.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; And I stand here, I'm ignorant. I
[1:42:11] wouldn't know how to go the wrong sites
[1:42:13] to be honest with you. Some of you are
[1:42:15] going to laugh at this next statement.
[1:42:16] I've never been to YouTube. I've never
[1:42:19] been to TV on the internet.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; I I I don't know anything. I couldn't
[1:42:24] take you to Facebook.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; My wife has a site, but I couldn't get
[1:42:31] you there.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; I'm just thankful I can read Brother
[1:42:34] Brown's message and and study the
[1:42:36] message on the computer.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; I'm a redneck, and I'm not afra I'm not
[1:42:41] ashamed to say that. But I thank God I
[1:42:43] was a sinner, but I've been saved by the
[1:42:45] grace of God.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; I've just become accompanied with
[1:42:49] texting.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; I can now text and get thumbs to work.
[1:42:53] I'm thrilled about that. I can say hello
[1:42:55] and and K.
[1:43:01] I wouldn't know how to send you a
[1:43:02] picture if my life depended on it.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you for that last picture, Brother
[1:43:11] John.
[1:43:17] But if we're not careful, Satan will
[1:43:19] begin to bombard our mind.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; He'll bombard our mind with information.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; And we'll start creating pages that we
[1:43:29] would like to delete but never can
[1:43:30] delete.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I hit the delete button. It's
[1:43:34] always there.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; It's not like the bleach of the blood of
[1:43:37] Jesus Christ. Listen,
[1:43:40] when you repent of your sins and you ask
[1:43:43] God to forgive you of your sins and the
[1:43:46] abstract title deed is cleared by the
[1:43:49] blood of Jesus Christ, Brother Brown
[1:43:51] said it is bleach. And when your sins go
[1:43:54] down in there,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; our all knowing God,
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; the God that knows how many hairs has
[1:44:04] been on every head since Adam.
[1:44:08] The God that knows how many bats there's
[1:44:10] ever been, how many ants there's ever
[1:44:12] been, how many mosquitoes there's ever
[1:44:15] been.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; That's got to be a great God.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; The God that knows the end from the
[1:44:22] beginning.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; When you ask him for mercy,
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; when you ask him for forgiveness,
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; he puts it in the delete file.
[1:44:36] Hallelujah.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; And let me just say this to you. Not
[1:44:42] even God can find it.
[1:44:55] Not even God can find me,
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; brother. But I was this and I was that.
[1:45:00] I'm ashamed to tell you the other night,
[1:45:03] I was a drug addict. There's things I've
[1:45:05] never repeated across my lips I didn't
[1:45:07] want my children to know. I didn't want
[1:45:09] my church to know. But when I went on my
[1:45:11] knees and I said, "God, I need you to
[1:45:14] forgive me of this. I'm sorry. My sins
[1:45:18] went against the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:20] I apologize. I want you to have dominion
[1:45:23] over my life. Forgive me for my
[1:45:25] weaknesses.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm not a Catholic. I don't have
[1:45:32] to do purgatory every day. I don't have
[1:45:34] to count rosary beads. I don't have to
[1:45:37] kiss dead statues.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Listen. My God.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Luther preached
[1:45:47] justification. But under the opening of
[1:45:49] the word, brother said, "You never did
[1:45:52] it in the first place."
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:18] I had a man come to me one time and tell
[1:46:20] told me, he said, "You're not qualified
[1:46:22] to preach.
[1:46:27] You're not qualified to preach."
[1:46:31] Okay.
[1:46:34] With your past, you're not qualified to
[1:46:36] preach. All right?
[1:46:40] Here
[1:46:43] was my answer. Paul was a murderer.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Paul was a blasphemer.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Said every day Paul say stall Stephen
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; and held his coat. Every day
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; he lived with the scars. Right?
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; We may have to live with some scars in
[1:47:11] our life,
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; but it's God
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; who qualifies.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not so impressed with your
[1:47:22] qualifications. You didn't put me in.
[1:47:25] You can't take me out.
[1:47:29] Hallelujah.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; When I was walking to the altar in a
[1:47:34] little old country church, I didn't look
[1:47:36] around and say, "Am I qualified to walk
[1:47:38] to this altar?"
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; I didn't lay down rosary beads on the
[1:47:46] way up there.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; I simply went before God.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I simply went before God.
[1:47:55] Don't get cold on me now.
[1:47:58] And I ain't talking about the
[1:47:59] temperature
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; because let me just say this to you. All
[1:48:03] of us were guilty.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; All of us were guilty.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Can I say it again? All of us were
[1:48:12] guilty.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; There's none righteous. No, not one.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Where you going with this? Just hang on
[1:48:21] to your socks a minute.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; All of us were guilty. As a matter of
[1:48:27] fact, our thoughts today would send us
[1:48:29] to hell.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Some of your thoughts right here in the
[1:48:37] last few minutes will send you to hell.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; I needed an abstract.
[1:48:55] I can look 2,000 years ago and if I
[1:48:57] could say it, I'd say, "Preach Moses.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; I need him."
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Preach Elijah.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; I need him.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz no mortal has any right to stand in
[1:49:13] the presence of God and condemn another
[1:49:16] mortal.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; No mortal. True.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; No mortal.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; So that qualifies about every one of us.
[1:49:26] Nobody has any stones that they can
[1:49:28] throw.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, you're getting at
[1:49:34] me." Yes, sir. I'm getting at every one
[1:49:36] of us. We don't want to leave one huff
[1:49:38] here.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; We don't want to leave one of you here.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; You must remember, we're not enemies.
[1:49:45] We're a family.
[1:49:55] Amen.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; I'll finish that part in the morning.
[1:50:03] But let me just say this to you. As the
[1:50:04] queen of heaven, we're going to judge
[1:50:05] the earth.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; We're going to get in practice right
[1:50:09] here. Forgiving one another.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:27] man called me one day and he said that
[1:50:29] woman is not even qualified to sit in a
[1:50:31] church.
[1:50:35] I asked him the question,
[1:50:37] did you ever kiss another woman before
[1:50:39] you got married? Before an all- knowing
[1:50:42] God
[1:50:45] and the failure of your mistake. Yes.
[1:50:48] Yes, I did. I'm sorry.
[1:50:50] Say it louder. Yes, I did. I'm sorry.
[1:50:55] You're a minister. You kissed another
[1:50:56] man's wife.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; You need mercy.
[1:51:12] And I took him to what I preached to you
[1:51:14] Thursday night. There was a woman who
[1:51:18] had received multitudes
[1:51:21] of perverted seeds.
[1:51:26] I took my glasses off so I can't see
[1:51:28] you. So here we are.
[1:51:31] She had received multitudes of seeds,
[1:51:35] but she had something lacking in her
[1:51:37] life.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; She needed Jesus.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; If we're not careful,
[1:51:47] we'll set on message pews.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; We'll live in message homes.
[1:51:53] But if we're not careful, the God of
[1:51:55] this Bible that we've been talking about
[1:51:57] this week will not live in our lives.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; And it's more than a book.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; It's more than a picture.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; This is a life.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; My children needed mercy.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Your children needs mercy.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:20] If you can't forgive sins, neither can
[1:52:23] your sins be forgiven.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; And every one of us here tonight have
[1:52:28] weaknesses. But Paul said, "I seek to
[1:52:32] know nothing among you, save Jesus
[1:52:34] Christ only."
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; But if we're not careful, let me preach
[1:52:46] just a few more minutes. If we're not
[1:52:48] careful, lay out ought to see an age.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; One that over gets overlooked because of
[1:52:54] people feel like the delay of the
[1:52:55] coming,
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord lifting things
[1:52:58] becoming cooler will start biting and
[1:53:00] devouring one another.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; And you, just as much as you've got to
[1:53:06] resist Hollywood and internet and
[1:53:08] pornographic sites, you have to resist
[1:53:10] your own flesh.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's an anointing on this age.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Let me preach to you. There's an
[1:53:17] anointing on this age to murder one
[1:53:19] another.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about AK-47s and 9
[1:53:23] mm. I'm talking about the most deadly
[1:53:24] weapon every one of us got. And that's
[1:53:26] our tongue.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Harold Yilderbrand said,
[1:53:31] "Sometimes we just need to stop and take
[1:53:33] a drink of water." Yes, sir. Some of us
[1:53:35] need to drink a gallon.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; $5.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; I am what I am.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; God help me.
[1:54:13] If we're not careful, our teenagers
[1:54:15] lives will be shattered.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Before long, therefore
[1:54:24] long, the sanctuary of the home has been
[1:54:27] a place where we gossip.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; It's a place that the tape recorder is
[1:54:32] not played anymore. The iPod's not
[1:54:34] played anymore.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; We're not as urgent about going to
[1:54:38] church.
[1:54:41] We're not pulling on the gift of God
[1:54:42] that God put as Christ as an angel of
[1:54:44] the Lord before us.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; If we're not careful, we miss our
[1:54:48] worship service and we walk in after
[1:54:51] it's all over with and because it's not
[1:54:53] our favorite singers or maybe they're
[1:54:55] singing songs that we really don't want
[1:54:56] like and we just sit there and our hands
[1:54:59] held down. I don't I'm just preaching.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; And you know, songs are testimonies
[1:55:07] whether we feel like it or not. They're
[1:55:08] testimonies of victory and testimonies
[1:55:10] of praise and
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; testimonies of joy.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; They're testimonies of healing.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; They're testimonies of the power of the
[1:55:18] redemption of the blood.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; They're testimonies of of when we're
[1:55:23] going through dark times and we come and
[1:55:25] we sing those songs. We welcome the
[1:55:27] spirit of God into this place
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; and we're driving back the devils that
[1:55:33] have got a hold of us and we fought all
[1:55:35] week long and we finally get into church
[1:55:37] and we start entering in
[1:55:41] and the preacher who's been isolated
[1:55:42] from the world is inspired by God to go
[1:55:45] to a certain passage and he reads the
[1:55:47] word and if you're in tune and you've
[1:55:49] been in that inner veil automatically
[1:55:51] you're with him
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; because not only is that preacher He's
[1:55:56] just like you. He's struggling with his
[1:55:59] own body.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; He's struggling with his own humanity.
[1:56:04] But we've got a promise.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; They which are alive and remain shall be
[1:56:11] caught up.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Our accuser who's holding our body.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The jurisdiction of sin has
[1:56:25] been revoked.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's clean.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; It's not about what you think. It's not
[1:56:32] about what you remember.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; But there's a seed of God that has been
[1:56:36] ignited in there.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me now?
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Unbelief and doubt does not hinder my
[1:56:48] God.
[1:56:56] Hallelujah.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; You battle the ought to see.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, this may be the last time I get
[1:57:04] to preach to you ever in my life. And
[1:57:06] I'm going to give it every bit of energy
[1:57:07] I can give it.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Satan is battling, but he don't have
[1:57:12] much longer to work.
[1:57:19] You know, it disappointed him
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; when he argued with the death angel
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; in a glass room two and a half years
[1:57:29] ago.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; He's got so many failures,
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; He ain't done whipping you yet.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:47] I can hear the angel Lord. Oh no, we
[1:57:50] ain't done yet here, boy.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Oh no, it ain't time for him to go in a
[1:57:54] grave yet. Uh-uh.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; This one ain't designed to go to death.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to preach it.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; My body wasn't designed to be put sixt
[1:58:13] under.
[1:58:15] My body was designed to be changed in
[1:58:17] the moment, in the twinkling of an eye.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Somewhere between 6:00 and 9:00.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; My eyes are going to see my grandma.
[1:58:30] They're going to see my loved ones.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; I'm like Job. I know my redeemer love.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; I know. I know. Hallelujah.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; While I'm standing here tonight, let me
[1:58:59] just say this to you. Those that are
[1:59:00] planning on staying here through the
[1:59:02] tribulation period, you better hang on
[1:59:03] to every one of these services
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; cuz we're getting right close to the
[1:59:10] end.
[1:59:12] There's foolish virgins sitting right
[1:59:13] among us and they're too busy to come to
[1:59:15] church. They're too busy to worship the
[1:59:16] Lord. They're too busy to pay their
[1:59:18] ties.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; But something about you and I leaving
[1:59:22] here,
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; something about Los Angeles dropping
[1:59:26] beneath the ocean.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Something about a Superman of the Pope
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; and a whole one world government.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; And something about being hunted down
[1:59:36] like dogs. A job no longer is important.
[1:59:39] Sports is no longer important.
[1:59:41] Television, all the junk of the world is
[1:59:43] no longer important.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. They're willing now to give
[1:59:49] their life for the gospel.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz God's under obligation to 144,000
[2:00:02] Jews just as much as he's under
[2:00:04] obligation to me and you.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; I'll finish that part of the sermon
[2:00:11] tomorrow morning. But let me just say
[2:00:13] this to you.
[2:00:15] We will
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; It will not be a maybe,
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; but we will overcome.
[2:00:40] I've seen on the inside of a file leaf
[2:00:41] of a Bible written about the boy from
[2:00:44] Finley.
[2:00:48] And he tells the vision for a couple of
[2:00:51] years. I've seen it. I've seen it with
[2:00:54] my own eyes.
[2:00:56] A vision about a 42 inch caribou.
[2:01:04] You were there to see it.
[2:01:06] a silver tipped grizzly bear and you
[2:01:08] were there to see it.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; But also the same prophet said she'll be
[2:01:15] bone of his bone,
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; life of his life,
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; power of his power.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; She's a masterpiece.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; She's a bride that will not fail.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; You've got an anchor.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; You got an anchor that'll hold you.
[2:01:33] Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; You got an anchor.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; God had confidence that you'd go through
[2:01:38] your sicknesses and your trials. You'll
[2:01:40] make it.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; He put something on the inside of you.
[2:01:44] You'll make it.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; You'll make it.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; You'll make it.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; You're going to make it.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; When you feel like quitting, let me just
[2:01:54] say there's an anchor down in there.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; You're going to make it.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Ken, there's been a lot of
[2:02:00] criticism your way many days. No doubt
[2:02:03] you got discouraged, but you're going to
[2:02:05] make it.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; We got a covenant.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; No weapon that is formed against us
[2:02:15] shall prosper.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:02:29] Hallelujah.
[2:02:31] Hallelujah.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; I'm done. I just want to share something
[2:02:35] with you.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; You may be struggling tonight and you
[2:02:39] have came to this meeting knowing
[2:02:41] because you know yourself.
[2:02:47] I've never did this before in my life,
[2:02:49] but I'm going to do this tonight.
[2:02:52] So, I feel led of God to do it.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Don't get scared.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:02] But listen, we've already had a lamb
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; that loosed us.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; We've already had a lamb that became our
[2:03:11] king.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; And he's our bridegroom group.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; He's already loosed the chains.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; We've been told who we are.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; We've got a new identification.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this tonight. You don't
[2:03:25] have to leave this meeting
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; with chains.
[2:03:29] hanging on you.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Habits that you know are very private
[2:03:35] that is destroying your life. And every
[2:03:37] time you get down to pray, he reminds
[2:03:40] you.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Every time you get so close to God, he
[2:03:47] reminds you. You remember when
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; and then you know he knows.
[2:03:58] You know he knows.
[2:04:00] You know that night that you put pushed
[2:04:01] on the wrong button and sent you to the
[2:04:04] wrong sight. You know when your tongue
[2:04:06] got cut loose at the wrong time.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; And every time you think you're getting
[2:04:12] victory, your accuser
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; reminds you.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; If you don't hear anything else tonight,
[2:04:21] listen to this. He is stripped of every
[2:04:24] bit of his power.
[2:04:27] He don't have the keys to his own house.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; He has a blow and he has no arrows.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; He is a liar.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; You can put those weaknesses at Jesus'
[2:04:42] feet right here tonight.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; You, not your mom and your daddy, not
[2:04:51] your neighbor, not your preacher.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; You.
[2:04:55] Amen.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Cuz when the lights go out, you know,
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; but he said, "I'll give you a peace that
[2:05:04] passes all understanding."
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; And then you can love your enemies.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; You can love your enemies.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:25] Hallelujah.
[2:05:28] Could we just bow our heads just for a
[2:05:29] moment?
[2:05:37] Could we just be honest tonight? Could
[2:05:39] we just say, "Brother Ron,
[2:05:43] I personally needed this word tonight to
[2:05:46] deliver me. I needed this tonight to
[2:05:48] deliver me.
[2:05:51] I needed this.
[2:05:53] I needed this.
[2:05:56] Young, old,
[2:05:59] everyone sitting in this building.
[2:06:12] Hallelujah.
[2:06:14] Hallelujah.
[2:06:21] Hallelujah.
[2:06:24] Samson realized
[2:06:27] a prayer meeting.
[2:06:30] A prayer meeting
[2:06:33] would restore his strength.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; I can't restore it, but I know one that
[2:06:39] can.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Standing somewhere in the shadows,
[2:06:45] you'll find Jesus.
[2:06:47] He's a friend who always cares and
[2:06:50] understands.
[2:06:53] Hallelujah.
[2:06:55] Pass me an auto general savior, brother
[2:06:57] Ryan.
[2:06:59] I want to invite you to where I'm
[2:07:01] standing at just now.
[2:07:03] Not to an altar.
[2:07:06] You raised your hands.
[2:07:10] I want to invite you. It's an odd place
[2:07:12] for the wrong
[2:07:17] cuz I like you need an altar.
[2:07:22] I like you need an altar.
[2:07:28] Hallelujah.
[2:07:33] Hallelujah.
[2:07:37] Those that raise your hands, could you
[2:07:39] just stand to your feet just now?
[2:07:44] Could you just make your way this way?
[2:07:47] Step out. Leave pride where it's at.
[2:07:51] Whoever you are, your name, I don't care
[2:07:53] if you're preacher's son, preacher's
[2:07:54] daughter, my children,
[2:08:00] I want to just make a circle right here.
[2:08:03] Hallelujah.
[2:08:12] The scripture said, "Whom the Son is set
[2:08:14] free is free indeed."
[2:08:18] When God looks at our our title D,
[2:08:23] what was there
[2:08:27] and we ask him to forgive us?
[2:08:32] There's something about his blood.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Derek, he just wipes it wide
[2:08:38] away.
[2:08:40] And the greatest enemy God's got, the
[2:08:43] most intelligent mind that's ever been
[2:08:45] on the face of this earth,
[2:08:49] can stand there and all he sees is an
[2:08:51] empty page.
[2:08:56] Because God's blood
[2:09:00] takes our lust, takes our temper,
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; takes our unruly tongue, takes our eyes
[2:09:08] that looks at things that they shouldn't
[2:09:10] see, takes our mind that roves and
[2:09:12] thinks negative thoughts.
[2:09:20] Hallelujah.
[2:09:22] And he cleans us.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And you don't have to be a
[2:09:26] slave to it no longer.
[2:09:30] Lord Jesus,
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; there's just something about the human
[2:09:36] ability
[2:09:38] to bow their head before God.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; You're not a God that's dull of hearing.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; You're a God that hears our whispers.
[2:09:55] And there's something about breath going
[2:09:56] across vocal cords,
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; going over a tongue and through lips
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; when they're talking to their Lord that
[2:10:05] they didn't have to have a private
[2:10:06] interview
[2:10:09] because we could come boldly before the
[2:10:11] throne of grace.
[2:10:14] Oh, God of glory.
[2:10:18] There was a time we had to have blood of
[2:10:20] bulls and goats and turtle ducks.
[2:10:26] But our kinsmen
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; saw the condition we'd be in tonight.
[2:10:35] There's a dispute over my human body.
[2:10:40] Oh, dear God, tonight
[2:10:42] in your plans to have a rapture,
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Satan disputes,
[2:10:49] brings up all of our iniquities and our
[2:10:51] tr our trespasses.
[2:10:54] All of our faults and failures, and
[2:10:55] reminds us daily of what we've did. But
[2:10:58] we remind him tonight, he's a liar.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; We repent before you, God. We're sorry.
[2:11:05] Yes, Lord.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; We individually,
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask you to forgive us for what
[2:11:09] we've done.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; God, I ask you to forgive you. I'm I'm
[2:11:13] I'm sorry that I've did you wrong.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I've been negative. I'm sorry
[2:11:18] my attitude's been stinking.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us tonight, Lord Jesus.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, you see those that's been on the
[2:11:24] wrong kind of internet. You see those
[2:11:26] that have did immoral sins. You see the
[2:11:29] things of people's lives. You see where
[2:11:31] we failed to worship you.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, come tonight.
[2:11:40] Meet us right here in this camp right
[2:11:42] now.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, the things that we wrestle with,
[2:11:47] Father.
[2:11:49] Lord, we're not willing to leave this
[2:11:51] building tonight until you come.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask you to come to every young
[2:11:55] man, every young girl, every every every
[2:11:58] elderly man, every old little girl.
[2:12:00] Lord, tonight I pray that you we have a
[2:12:02] prayer meeting to shake the shingles off
[2:12:04] of a roof. Lord, come and meet our needs
[2:12:06] tonight, Lord.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, you see the feebleness of our
[2:12:10] humanity.
[2:12:13] Oh God, you see our first book that was
[2:12:15] written,
[2:12:16] Lord, I pray tonight that you would help
[2:12:18] us, dear God.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:12:22] come tonight, Lord Jesus.
[2:12:26] Oh Lord Jesus.
[2:12:29] Lord, touch every one of them tonight,

[2:23:32] Think about it, saints.
[2:23:35] in our
[2:23:38] oysters.

[2:32:16] tonight. Saints. Oh worthy.

[2:32:33] that was slain.

[2:32:44] from the onset
[2:32:47] of time.
[2:32:49] up the chains
[2:32:52] of defeat. There's no king
[2:32:59] and see the tears
[2:33:02] of the broken.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Why don't you worship him
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; in this closing song? Why don't you
[2:33:10] worship him now?
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; No one's worthy.
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; No man was worthy to set free.
[2:33:21] Then the crying
[2:33:24] is still hallelujah.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; Don't let somebody else worship for you
[2:33:29] tonight, saints. Lift up your hands.
[2:33:31] Lift up your heart.

[2:33:35] from the chase.

[2:33:44] of voices
[2:33:47] are swelling
[2:33:50] the song. They sing worthy.
[2:33:55] The lamb that was saved,
[2:34:02] oh worthy.
[2:34:05] Isn't he so worthy tonight?
[2:34:07] Chains have been loosed, lives
[2:34:10] delivered.
[2:34:12] Oh, worthy.
[2:34:15] The lamb
[2:34:17] that was slain
[2:34:22] is worthy.
[2:34:32] Worthy
[2:34:35] the lamb
[2:34:37] that was slain.
[2:34:42] All the archangels
[2:34:47] the saint of all time.
[2:34:52] They're holding
[2:34:54] the ground
[2:35:01] for they fall down
[2:35:04] before him. Glory
[2:35:07] joining
[2:35:09] the song
[2:35:12] worthy.
[2:35:18] Oh yeah.
[2:35:21] He's worthy.
[2:35:26] Worthy.
[2:35:31] Worthy.
[2:35:33] The lamb
[2:35:35] that was slain.
[2:35:40] He's worthy.
[2:35:46] Worthy.
[2:35:48] Hallelujah.
[2:35:50] and worthy
[2:35:53] the lamb
[2:35:55] that was.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say I love him? I love thee. I
[2:36:00] love him.
[2:36:05] I love him.
[2:36:10] I love
[2:36:16] Oh, I love him tonight.
[2:36:19] I love thee.
[2:36:24] I love
[2:36:27] receive our worship. I love
[2:36:31] the lamb
[2:36:34] that was saved.
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:51] Hallelujah. Don't you love lingering in
[2:36:53] his presence?
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; I just wonder tonight
[2:37:03] if you can stand in this kind of
[2:37:06] atmosphere
[2:37:08] and hear this kind of word that you
[2:37:10] ministered tonight and want to live in
[2:37:13] the state that you're living in.
[2:37:17] May God arrest your soul.
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; But I believe we've heard a word tonight
[2:37:24] that has reached down into the heart of
[2:37:26] men and women
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; that want to know him in the power of
[2:37:31] his resurrection.
[2:37:33] And they can say tonight by the grace of
[2:37:35] God, I came to church expecting and God
[2:37:38] met my expectation.
[2:37:43] The word met my expectation.
[2:37:46] God sent a man. But it was the word that
[2:37:49] spoke to my soul. It was the word I
[2:37:52] responded to.
[2:37:55] And I am so thankful I am with the
[2:37:58] people that are in this little tent that
[2:38:01] are pulling on the presence of God right
[2:38:03] now.
[2:38:08] I don't believe God's finished dealing
[2:38:10] with lives.
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; You might feel that maybe you want to go
[2:38:15] home this evening and you need to go to
[2:38:17] your cabin and you need to have a rest.
[2:38:20] You're invited to go.
[2:38:23] We're going to have a wonderful service
[2:38:25] tomorrow.
[2:38:27] But those that are the campers and
[2:38:29] counselors,
[2:38:31] you want to linger and you want to stay
[2:38:32] in the presence of God, then you stay.
[2:38:37] We're dismissing you in the name of
[2:38:39] Jesus Christ.
[2:38:41] You have to make your way home
[2:38:43] and travel back in the morning. Then I
[2:38:46] say, God bless you for coming.
[2:38:50] If you just kindly just make your way
[2:38:52] off the grounds, that would be
[2:38:53] wonderful. But you want to stay and
[2:38:56] worship God and look to the lamb of God
[2:38:59] and stay in his presence and linger a
[2:39:01] little while, you go right ahead. That's
[2:39:04] why we're having this camp meeting.
[2:39:11] Lord,
[2:39:15] I believe you're dealing very deeply,
[2:39:18] sovereignly, individually
[2:39:22] in the hearts of our precious, precious
[2:39:24] young people.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, over the past weeks and months,
[2:39:30] we've set some time aside.
[2:39:33] We have prayed much
[2:39:36] and we have so desired for a time such
[2:39:39] as this.
[2:39:42] Precious sisters have closed their
[2:39:44] closet doors and brothers have shut
[2:39:47] themselves away for such a time as this.
[2:39:51] And so Lord, our prayers have not been
[2:39:53] in vain. But you're a God that hears and
[2:39:57] you're a God that answers.
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; And we want to thank you this evening,
[2:40:01] Lord. for the sovereignty of your spirit
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; by the power of your word that delivers
[2:40:08] and sets a people free.
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; I'm asking Lord that you'll watch over
[2:40:15] your children as they will journey and
[2:40:16] travel on the road. May traveling
[2:40:19] mercies be with them. And Father, at our
[2:40:22] appointed time tomorrow morning, if you
[2:40:24] should give us that time at 10:00,
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; we'll come back
[2:40:31] and meet with you again.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; So, Father, I'm asking now you go with
[2:40:35] your children
[2:40:37] and may they go in the peace and love of
[2:40:39] Christ
[2:40:42] in Jesus name.
[2:40:45] Amen.
[2:40:48] God bless you.
[2:40:50] Until we meet again
[2:40:53] tomorrow morning at 10:00,
[2:40:56] God be with you. You're dismissed in
