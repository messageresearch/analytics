[0:00] the Lord possessed me in the beginning
[0:01] of his way before his works of old I was
[0:05] set up from Everlasting from the
[0:07] beginning wherever the Earth was when
[0:10] there were no depths I was brought forth
[0:12] when there were no fountains abounding
[0:14] with water before the mountains were
[0:16] settled before the hills was I brought
[0:19] forth while as yet he had not made the
[0:21] Earth nor the fields nor the highest
[0:24] part of the Dust of the world when he
[0:25] prepared the heavens I was there when he
[0:28] set a compass upon the face to the depth
[0:30] when he established the clouds above
[0:33] when he strengthened The Fountains of
[0:34] the deep when he gave to the Sea his
[0:36] decree that the waters should not pass
[0:38] his commandment when he appointed the
[0:40] foundations of the earth then I was by
[0:43] him as one brought up with him and I was
[0:46] daily his Delight rejoicing always
[0:48] before him rejoicing in the habitable
[0:50] part of his Earth and my Delights were
[0:53] with the sons of men
