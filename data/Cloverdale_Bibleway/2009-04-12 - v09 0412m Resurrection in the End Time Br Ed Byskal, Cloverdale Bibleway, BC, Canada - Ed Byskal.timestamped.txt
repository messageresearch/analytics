[4:00] any operation. and thank the word bride
[4:03] for their prayers. Amen. And if you are

[4:16] Aren't you glad you're not hiding Easter
[4:18] eggs this morning? No chocolate bunnies.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; We serve a risen savior.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; We're not looking 2,000 years ago. We're
[4:27] looking to the God of today. He's a
[4:29] living God and he he does miracles so
[4:33] great.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Look around you. You are the miracle so
[4:37] great. We want to thank him this morning
[4:40] that he is the resurrection and the
[4:42] life. I think we can praise him. I think
[4:45] we can lift up our hands this morning.
[4:47] Unite this Easter morning. Thank him
[4:49] that he's not a God of 2,000 years ago,
[4:52] but he's a God that's living yet today.
[4:55] changing hearts, changing lives, doing
[4:58] miracles amongst his bride. Heavenly
[5:00] Father, with our hands lifted up, our
[5:02] hearts filled with praise, we want to
[5:04] say you're worthy this morning, worthy
[5:07] of glory, worthy of honor, worthy of all
[5:09] praise. Lord, we are living miracles of
[5:12] the resurrection. Lives that have been
[5:14] changed in this sin cursed, dark, wicked
[5:18] age that we're living in. Young man
[5:20] transformed by the power of God. young
[5:23] ladies in the beauty of holiness. We are
[5:25] the miracles, Lord. God, we want to
[5:28] praise you this morning because Easter
[5:30] is alive and living within our hearts
[5:32] and lives. We want to worship you, the
[5:34] living God, because you said, "Because I
[5:37] live, you shall live also. You have
[5:39] quickened who are dead in our sins and
[5:42] trespasses, but Lord, we've been made
[5:44] alive by the power of God." We worship
[5:47] you this morning. We have a thanksgiving
[5:49] in our souls, Lord. We're waiting for
[5:51] the quickening power to move over us
[5:54] this morning to rapture us and change us
[5:57] into the very likeness of God. We love
[6:00] you. We appreciate all you've done
[6:02] within our lives, our wives, our
[6:05] children, our young people. Lord, we're
[6:07] not looking to a dead religion as the
[6:09] world is out there, but we're looking to
[6:11] you. The son of man has come. Lord, rain
[6:15] upon us this morning. anoint your
[6:17] servant in a special way and anoint our
[6:19] ears to hear what the spirit would say
[6:22] to the church. If there's any hardness
[6:24] within our hearts, break it down, Lord.
[6:26] Let the love of God come down. May we
[6:28] have a great baptism of your spirit. May
[6:32] this church, Lord, come alive. Be
[6:34] electrified by your presence. May we
[6:37] move into those heavenly places, Lord,
[6:39] that we so long to live in and dwell in
[6:42] this morning. How we appreciate the
[6:45] family of God. How we appreciate those
[6:47] that would hook up with us this morning.
[6:49] We just pray that you'd be high and
[6:51] lifted up in all your glory. Lord John
[6:54] heard saw that lamb come forth and all
[6:57] heaven heard him praise your name. May
[6:59] that be upon our lips this morning.
[7:02] Praise and glory and honor
[7:05] for the lamb has come and we worship you
[7:09] the living savior. be pleased with our
[7:12] worship and Lord as brother Episcopal
[7:14] will minister may we not see flesh but
[7:17] may we see God in flesh
[7:20] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name be glorified.

[10:07] There's no way to measure what you were.
[10:13] Oh, but you were crucified
[10:19] and laid behind

[10:27] in
[10:31] my role.
[10:33] [Music]
[10:43] And you find me.
[10:45] [Music]
[10:49] Oh Lord, you were
[10:54] [Applause]

[10:57] behind
[10:59] you.
[11:08] I rose
[11:11] on the ground.
[11:15] You know

[12:28] [Music]

[12:34] his destiny.
[12:36] [Music]

[12:46] hill of

[12:53] there to lay down
[12:56] his life

[14:58] are made.
[15:01] There's no feeling like this.
[15:07] If that is enough,
[15:10] &gt;&gt; if that is.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, the ocean
[15:14] is dry.
[15:17] There's no stars in the sky.
[15:22] And the sparrow can fly.
[15:28] That is enough. If that is
[15:33] in heaven,
[15:36] [Applause]
[15:38] there's no feeling like this.
[15:43] If that isn't love,
[15:49] if that isn't love.
[15:54] If that is enough,
[16:00] [Music]

[17:22] [Music]
[17:24] Christ.

[17:48] pray.
[17:51] Don't wait until his bride has been
[17:55] completed.
[17:58] And don't wait until you hear him say
[18:02] it's too late.
[18:05] Oh,

[18:22] [Applause]
[18:24] Heat. Heat.
[18:34] [Music]
[18:38] Amen. Well, we're glad he lives forever
[18:40] more.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; And we're glad he's still adding to the
[18:44] church.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; So, we've got a a new member. She
[18:50] doesn't know she's a member yet, but she
[18:53] will soon discover it. And uh Ella Joy
[18:57] is going to sing us a song.
[19:02] Amen. and she wanted to sing at her
[19:04] sister's
[19:06] dedication.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:11] [Music]
[19:23] &gt;&gt; I am
[19:26] a cure.
[19:28] [Music]
[19:40] and my life was in his hands.
[19:48] He knows my name
[19:52] and
[19:54] he knows my every thought.
[20:01] He sees each te that pass and he hears
[20:07] me when I come.
[20:11] [Music]
[20:13] He knows my name.
[20:19] He knows my
[20:23] hurry.
[20:26] He sees each tear that falls
[20:31] and hears me that I come.
[20:37] [Music]
[20:47] I have a maker.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; I have a father.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Andrew said this has special meaning for
[20:55] them
[20:56] because the song says, "And every time
[20:59] and before time began, my life was in
[21:02] his hands." And that's exactly what we
[21:04] believe.
[21:06] Well, brother Rickart and Sister Andrea
[21:09] have brought their uh latest edition,
[21:13] their daughter. And this is uh Gwyneth
[21:16] Kate.
[21:18] Gwyneth Kate is her name. Gwyneth being
[21:22] to be blessed with happiness.
[21:25] And Kate is pure,
[21:28] genuine, and real.
[21:31] And we we pray that that's exactly what
[21:33] she will be if the Lord Jesus carries.
[21:36] But this uh to be blessed with happiness
[21:40] and I gave a prayerful thought to this
[21:43] uh Andrea Ricard
[21:47] it's from being uh conscious
[21:50] for her to be conscious of well-being
[21:53] for her to be conscious of
[21:56] uh being cared for having a sense of
[21:58] comfort
[22:00] for her to be conscious of peace. There
[22:02] will be there will be a day when she
[22:05] will have that she will mature to that
[22:08] age in her life where she will be able
[22:10] to be aware of things that she's not
[22:14] aware of right now. And in order for her
[22:17] to be conscious of it, she has to
[22:20] experience it. She has to experience the
[22:22] peace
[22:23] &gt;&gt; and experience the comfort, experience
[22:26] the joy in a home, experience the
[22:27] spiritual influence of a home.
[22:32] And I thought of something very
[22:34] different at this time. Not because uh
[22:38] she's my greatg granddaughter, but I
[22:40] just look to the Lord for each
[22:43] individual one. I know the other
[22:45] brethren do the same thing. But I
[22:48] thought in this day and age, what what
[22:49] can parents do?
[22:53] What what can we do?
[22:56] And I thought of some parents in the
[22:58] scripture. I thought of the woman that
[23:00] brought her daughter to Jesus, Andrea.
[23:05] And Jesus said, "It's not meat to give
[23:08] the children's bread to the dogs." And
[23:10] she said, "Truth, Lord, but the dogs eat
[23:14] the crumbs
[23:16] from the master's table." And I said in
[23:19] my heart, she said the right thing.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; She said the right thing. And Jesus
[23:24] said, "I've never heard I' never seen
[23:26] such faith in all of Israel." And
[23:29] because of that, her daughter was
[23:31] delivered and healed.
[23:33] Hadtie Wright said the right thing. She
[23:37] didn't say very much, but she said this.
[23:42] He said she was sitting there with a
[23:44] little dust bonnet on her head
[23:47] that country women wear.
[23:50] She put on a clean dress
[23:52] and came to help her mother cook a
[23:54] dinner.
[23:56] She was sitting with her hand like this.
[24:00] And brother Brandham had said something
[24:02] and she said, "That's nothing but the
[24:05] truth."
[24:06] The other woman said, "But even the dogs
[24:09] eat the crumbs from the master's table."
[24:11] And how do he write said, "That's
[24:12] nothing but the truth."
[24:14] And brother Bren went on to say
[24:18] just as she said that,
[24:22] I want you to notice all parents here
[24:24] and all individuals, just as she said
[24:27] that, the Holy Spirit spoke to him and
[24:30] said, "Give her what she asks for."
[24:36] That happens to be very powerful. That
[24:39] was a parent.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; And she asked for her two sons.
[24:44] There was a man Rick record
[24:48] and he brought his tormented child to
[24:50] Jesus.
[24:52] I was thankful. I thought of this
[24:54] parent, he knew where to bring that
[24:56] child.
[24:58] And I say to every parent that is here,
[25:01] it's incumbent upon us as parents to
[25:03] know in a time of need where to bring
[25:07] our children,
[25:09] &gt;&gt; where to bring our young people. And if
[25:11] you brought your young people here with
[25:12] you as families, I say in the name of
[25:15] the Lord, you've brought them to the
[25:16] right place.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; You young people that have parents that
[25:20] have influenced you and worked with you
[25:23] and prayed with you, you thank God for
[25:25] them.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Rick Hart and Andrea, you have brought
[25:29] your child to the right place.
[25:32] And before we dedicate her, I want you
[25:34] both to dedicate yourselves to be these
[25:36] kind of parents. And not only parents
[25:38] but grandparents.
[25:40] Apostle Paul spoke of his forefathers
[25:43] which is which is not parents but that's
[25:46] grandparents or even greatgrandparents.
[25:49] And he spoke about them and the faith
[25:51] that he had and then he spoke about
[25:53] Timothy and that's why he said to
[25:55] Timothy the faith that was first in your
[25:57] mother your grandmother Lois and in your
[25:59] mother and it came on down. So this is
[26:03] important
[26:05] and I thought of one more parent and
[26:07] that was the prodal the father the
[26:10] prodal son and the bible says the the
[26:14] the son he awakened he came to himself
[26:19] and as as and I trust that this child
[26:22] will never never experience those things
[26:24] that he experienced but even then he
[26:27] came to himself and he said I will arise
[26:29] and I will go to my father and the
[26:31] scripture says His father
[26:36] saw him a great way off.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Because he was looking for him.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; He was expecting him to come back.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of you out there that have
[26:48] need that kind of faith.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; He was looking for him. He was looking
[26:52] for this son. He was expecting him. And
[26:55] I want you too, brother Rickart Mandrea,
[26:58] to expect this child to find the Lord
[27:01] Jesus Christ as her savior
[27:04] &gt;&gt; to know the God that we know.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to dedicate Gwyneth Kate.
[27:11] The name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[27:16] Dear heavenly father,
[27:19] this is a gift that you have given.
[27:22] Bless your name. We cannot
[27:25] even begin to thank you for your grace
[27:27] and your goodness. But please receive,
[27:30] oh father, our thankfulness to you. And
[27:34] now here stands her father Rickart and
[27:38] her mother Andrea
[27:40] desiring with everything that's in them
[27:42] to dedicate her back to you. And we
[27:44] dedicate Gwyneth Kate in the name of the
[27:46] Lord Jesus Christ that she might be an
[27:49] example to other young people. And if
[27:52] time should continue, Lord, may she be a
[27:54] vessel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Keep
[27:57] her in good health. I pray that she will
[28:00] be not only an example, but that she
[28:03] will be a source of happiness and joy
[28:05] within this family and to others. Thank
[28:09] you, oh God, for your goodness. And we
[28:11] dedicate ourselves to you. We take this
[28:13] opportunity to dedicate ourselves,
[28:15] mother, father, grandparents,
[28:17] greatgrandparents, and and all of us
[28:19] that are here in the congregation. We
[28:22] dedicate ourselves that we might be the
[28:24] example to our young people. And as your
[28:26] prophet said, we influence them. May we
[28:29] influence them in the path of life in
[28:32] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[28:36] Amen.
[28:39] Andrea, God bless you. Bless you,
[28:41] Rickart.
[28:43] enjoy. Thanks for that song.
[28:48] Hallelujah.
[28:52] Isn't the Lord wonderful?
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Well, I have a good friend here, too.
[28:59] Uh, I said to Brother Rod, I want to
[29:02] welcome our brother Eddie Hurley and his
[29:04] good wife Barb that is here with him.
[29:06] his daughter Tina and son-in-law James
[29:10] and their two children. Where are they?
[29:13] I wonder if we can have them all stand,
[29:15] please. My welcome.
[29:24] Amen. Well, we're so happy to have them
[29:26] and had a nice time with them last
[29:29] evening and and I just pray that they
[29:32] will uh they're they're going to escape
[29:34] the rain by going up higher and getting
[29:37] to Whistler and hoping it's snow. Well,
[29:40] I hope it's snow for you, too.
[29:43] Amen.
[29:46] If you haven't had an opportunity, and I
[29:48] don't imagine you have, there's a
[29:50] there's it's a newsletter that's just
[29:52] out, a missions newsletter, and uh
[29:55] brother Kim and brother Derek and
[29:58] brother Dier, brother Dier is in Ghana
[30:00] right now, but they all have contributed
[30:02] and and worked at putting this together
[30:04] and very nice. They want to put out one
[30:05] a month because there's just too much
[30:07] happening. So, we would ask also that
[30:10] you would just take one per family.
[30:12] You'll find them at the uh at the tithe
[30:14] and offering box I believe is where they
[30:16] said it would be and uh uh I I did read
[30:21] it as well and I had a small small hand
[30:24] in it not very much but it is just
[30:26] marvelous what is taking place a little
[30:29] bit maybe some of the things you heard
[30:30] about China and and about uh the church
[30:33] in Russia which also reminds me that on
[30:37] Tuesday we want to send uh an offering
[30:41] to uh to on behalf of the building of
[30:44] the church in Moscow and they're they've
[30:47] got the walls up and put the first uh uh
[30:50] ceiling. Some of you saw the pictures,
[30:52] the most recent pictures. I had a I had
[30:54] a phone call phone message yesterday and
[30:57] from brother Gear Roald which asked me
[30:59] also to convey greetings to the
[31:01] congregation to those on the internet
[31:03] those that are in the fellowship room uh
[31:06] greetings from uh brother Gear Roald and
[31:08] and their church is doing everything
[31:11] that they can towards this building of
[31:13] this church in Moscow. It's very urgent
[31:15] because there there's three
[31:17] congregations that have come together
[31:20] and they they don't have a place to
[31:22] worship. Uh they're under more severe
[31:25] restrictions than I can even begin to
[31:27] mention here. It takes about 15 years to
[31:29] get a church registration in in Russ in
[31:32] Russia or in that part. And uh so they
[31:36] have to build something that is will
[31:38] accommodate a a residence and a large
[31:41] enough building.
[31:43] Uh the brother uh the pastor uh brother
[31:46] Sergey was in Latvia recently and a and
[31:49] a and a pastor there is a a contractor
[31:53] and he just gave him some further advice
[31:56] on on almost doubling the size of the
[31:58] place at almost no extra cost. It would
[32:01] only take a few more uh about three or
[32:04] four truckloads or so of concrete
[32:07] blocks, but not much because they're
[32:10] doing a lot of the labor themselves. And
[32:12] so we want to send uh uh another
[32:14] offering on on Tuesday. And so if you
[32:17] just feel inclined, if you had wanted to
[32:20] do something, it doesn't make any
[32:22] difference what amount it is. We're just
[32:24] we gathered all together and all that
[32:26] has come in from elsewhere and from
[32:28] within the church. We've sent, as you'll
[32:30] see here, we've sent we have sent
[32:32] $56,000 to them and other churches in
[32:35] Europe have given. And we're getting
[32:38] these people the Lord the Lord helping
[32:41] them and they are working sacrificially.
[32:44] And those people themselves have given
[32:47] uh the the people in in Russia that
[32:50] congregation have given about $80,000.
[32:52] They say 70 here, but I know it's about
[32:54] $80,000 of their own money besides
[32:57] working. So I think that's very very
[33:00] honorable of them. They're sacrificing.
[33:03] And so if you just feel, Lord, I'm just
[33:05] going to do something a little extra
[33:06] special for them and then we're going to
[33:08] send it out Tuesday morning because
[33:10] they're in need of it right now. And
[33:11] don't forget to pick up your uh this
[33:14] mission's newsletter. Yeah, I know that
[33:16] you'll enjoy it.
[33:20] We also had a I had a uh an email that
[33:24] was translated to me from the Russian
[33:26] language and they uh I have never I've
[33:30] never heard directly from this brother
[33:33] uh before, but they they've been
[33:36] streaming the meetings and he's a
[33:37] pastor. He's got a nice church. I I've
[33:40] never been there, but I know that he's
[33:42] been pastoring there for a lot of years
[33:43] in the city in one of the former Soviet
[33:47] states.
[33:48] and they told me that they've been
[33:51] they've been really blessed by the
[33:53] meetings and the atmosphere and the
[33:55] ministry of the word from the church
[33:57] here and we're happy over that. We're
[33:59] just happy to be a blessing.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; That's all. And and as far as God wants
[34:04] to send it, that's just fine with us.
[34:07] But they started tra translating it into
[34:10] the streaming of the meetings into the
[34:13] uh Russian language and they they said
[34:16] that they're sending it to a number of
[34:18] countries
[34:20] uh Russ where Russianspeaking people are
[34:22] and you know that there's almost 3/4
[34:24] million Jews that went from Russia to
[34:27] Israel and these people are sending over
[34:30] 110
[34:32] DVDs of every service to former Soviet
[34:36] states to the Ukraine into Europe and
[34:40] into Germany wherever there's Russian
[34:41] speaking people that they have contact
[34:43] with and some and they're sending them
[34:45] into Israel as well. And I thought that
[34:48] was just really remarkable.
[34:50] Uh
[34:52] so God knows exactly what it is that
[34:54] he's wanting to do and trying to do and
[34:57] we're just saying here we are. We want
[34:59] to do our best.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm sure you feel exactly the
[35:04] same.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:06] Uh, I'd like to just have you stand and
[35:10] uh I'd like to sing, Brother Rod. He
[35:14] became me that I might become him
[35:16] through his grace. Aren't you glad he
[35:18] became me?
[35:20] &gt;&gt; When he was on the cross, I should have
[35:21] been there.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; You should have been there, but he was
[35:25] there for us.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; So, he became me so we could become him
[35:31] by his grace.
[35:33] Just sing it together with us, please.
[35:39] He became me
[35:43] so that I might become him by gra.
[35:54] He became me
[35:58] so that I might become
[36:03] by grace.
[36:08] He
[36:10] took my place
[36:12] so that I
[36:17] could take his.
[36:23] He became me
[36:26] so that I might become him by grace.
[36:36] Let's just take a moment, please,
[36:38] quietly, reverently, quietening our
[36:40] spirits,
[36:42] collecting our thoughts and focusing on
[36:45] the great accomplishment of Jesus Christ
[36:49] at Calvary.
[36:51] Father,
[36:52] our Father, and I trust that each person
[36:56] can say, "My Father, which art in
[36:59] heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy
[37:02] kingdom come, thy will be done on earth
[37:06] as it is in heaven." Today, Lord, we're
[37:09] gathered here for that purpose. We've
[37:11] sung the songs. We have prayed. We have
[37:15] spoken and and uh greeted the friends
[37:18] and the people that are here visiting. I
[37:21] pray Lord now as we approach the word
[37:25] and I have the Bible open before me.
[37:28] Come now I pray Holy Spirit and confirm
[37:31] this truth to the people. We are not
[37:35] interested in uh history. We're not
[37:38] interested in theology. We're not
[37:40] interested in some dead tradition. But I
[37:43] pray that you will come and quicken this
[37:46] word to every person. And I pray that
[37:49] Satan will be soundly defeated, Lord, at
[37:52] every front. That you will take our
[37:55] minds and thoughts and bring them into
[37:57] captivity to the very mind and thought
[37:59] of Jesus Christ. I pray you will quicken
[38:02] and enable myself, Lord, to say what you
[38:05] would have said. We're praying for the
[38:07] service tonight. And so wonderful to
[38:09] have our brother Tom back, oh God, as a
[38:12] congregation. We want to thank you for
[38:15] the healing that you have done, Lord,
[38:17] for the supernatural act, for putting
[38:20] the right people together at the right
[38:22] time, for putting it in their hearts to
[38:24] do everything, Lord, being being
[38:27] motivated, being driven, oh God, to do
[38:29] even beyond beyond the call of duty. We
[38:33] thank you for that, Lord, because we
[38:34] know it is you that has done this. And
[38:37] now, Father, I pray that you will sew
[38:39] the seed and bring it down into our
[38:42] hearts, Lord, and it might glorify your
[38:45] name. In Jesus Christ's name we ask it.
[38:48] Amen.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. So appreciate your
[38:52] prayers. And uh now as we turn to the
[38:55] scripture, I'm going to read out of
[38:57] John's gospel
[39:00] the 12th chapter. And I'm starting to
[39:03] read at verse 233. We'll read down to
[39:06] verse 27
[39:08] and then you can just uh
[39:13] when you're seated after the reading of
[39:15] the scripture I'm going to go
[39:17] immediately into some other scriptures
[39:20] that you will see on the screen and what
[39:23] I am attempting to do I want to just
[39:26] take the account of the death and
[39:29] resurrection of Jesus Christ and I've
[39:32] selected various scriptures out of
[39:34] various of the gospels and they just run
[39:36] in continuity and I trust it will be a
[39:39] benefit to you and then we will go into
[39:42] the into the service. We're here on uh
[39:45] we're not here just to play church.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; We're here to have a meeting and do
[39:50] &gt;&gt; business with God.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Starting at the 23rd
[39:54] verse of 12th chapter, John.
[39:58] And Jesus answered them, saying, "The
[40:00] hour is come that the Son of Man should
[40:02] be glorified."
[40:04] Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a
[40:06] corn and wheat fall into the ground and
[40:08] die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it
[40:12] bringeth forth much fruit. He that
[40:15] loveth his life shall lose it. And he
[40:16] that hateth his life in this world shall
[40:18] keep it unto life eternal. If any man
[40:22] serve me, let him follow me. And where
[40:24] and where I am, there shall also my
[40:27] servant be. If any man serve me, him
[40:31] will my father honor.
[40:34] Now is my soul troubled, and what shall
[40:37] I say? Father, save me from this hour.
[40:41] But for this cause came I unto this
[40:44] hour. You may have your seat.
[40:53] Now, if you'll just watch the screen.
[41:01] And when they were came to the place
[41:04] which is called Calvary,
[41:06] there they crucified him and the male
[41:10] factors, one on the right hand and the
[41:14] other on the left.
[41:16] And the sun was darkened and the veil of
[41:19] the temple was rent in the midst.
[41:23] And when Jesus had cried with a loud
[41:25] voice, he said, "Father, into thy hands
[41:28] I commend my spirit." And having said
[41:31] thus, he gave up the ghost.
[41:37] And after this, Joseph of Arythea,
[41:41] being a disciple of Jesus,
[41:44] but secretly for fear of the Jews,
[41:49] besought Pilate, that he might take away
[41:52] the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave
[41:55] leave, and he came therefore and took
[42:00] the body of Jesus.
[42:12] And he took it down and wrapped it in
[42:15] linen and laid it in a sappelcher that
[42:18] was hu in stone wherein never a man was
[42:23] laid.
[42:29] The prophecy out of Psalms and repeated
[42:31] in Acts because thou wil not leave my
[42:33] soul in hell neither wilt thou thou
[42:36] suffer thy holy one to see corruption.
[42:39] And now upon the first day of the week,
[42:41] very early in the morning, they came
[42:43] unto the sephiler, bringing the spices
[42:46] which they had prepared, and certain
[42:48] others with them. And they and they
[42:51] found the stone rolled away from the
[42:54] sephiler.
[42:57] And they entered in and found not the
[42:59] body of the Lord Jesus. And it came to
[43:03] pass, as they were much perplexed
[43:04] thereabout, behold, two men stood by
[43:07] them in shining garments. And as they
[43:10] were afraid, and bowed down their faces
[43:13] to the earth, they said unto them, Why
[43:16] seek ye the living among the dead? He is
[43:19] not here, but is risen. Remember how he
[43:22] spake unto you when he was yet in
[43:24] Galilee, saying, "The Son of Man must be
[43:27] delivered into the hands of sinful men,
[43:30] and be crucified, and the third day rise
[43:33] again." And they remembered his words,
[43:36] and returned from the seeler, and told
[43:40] all these things to the 11, and to the
[43:44] rest.
[43:49] And when they were come to a place I'm
[43:52] sorry
[43:56] we'll just that is all the reading.
[43:58] Thank you.
[44:03] Today uh we're remembering the
[44:07] resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[44:10] But I want to take you quickly, very
[44:12] quickly, because the message today will
[44:15] require your full attention and going to
[44:19] come from a direction I'm sure that
[44:21] you're you're not expecting entirely.
[44:24] That is because both death
[44:28] and resurrection
[44:31] uh while we have a uh we have an
[44:33] immediate response mental response an
[44:35] immediate
[44:37] understanding and we interpret it uh as
[44:41] death being when a person expires and
[44:44] breathes their last breath and
[44:46] resurrection as one that has been raised
[44:49] from the dead. But there are there are
[44:52] other not merely meanings but it is used
[44:56] differently also in the scripture and I
[44:59] want to look at that because
[45:02] there is a a natural death and there's a
[45:06] spiritual death.
[45:08] There's a natural resurrection and
[45:10] there's a a natural physical
[45:12] resurrection. There's also a spiritual
[45:14] resurrection.
[45:16] And the Bible refers to
[45:19] uh both of these. And I want to take it
[45:22] further than that by God's help. And
[45:25] this is where you'll need to capture
[45:27] this first thought. And that is we can
[45:30] have
[45:32] uh uh a a death of an individual that we
[45:36] understand. That's what we talk about.
[45:38] But we can also have a uh there's been
[45:42] civilizations that have gone off the
[45:45] scene. They've essentially perished. Uh
[45:48] there's been there's been certain kinds
[45:51] of culture that's gone. And as time has
[45:55] moved on and the waves of of humanity
[46:00] have moved down through all through the
[46:03] centuries,
[46:05] we've had things that have risen and
[46:07] then then they've faded away and and
[46:11] we've had kingdoms that have been great
[46:13] superpowers and they're dead. They've
[46:17] died. They don't exist at all today. And
[46:21] then we've had resurrections also where
[46:24] man has uh there's there's there's
[46:27] renewals or revivals and all of those
[46:30] words are they they have the same kind
[46:34] of of reference. There's been like a a
[46:37] resurrection has has taken place. And so
[46:42] with those thoughts in your mind,
[46:46] uh I want to uh be approaching this
[46:49] subject. Brother Brandham, he speaks
[46:52] about Calvary first and we I want to um
[46:57] make a reference from the message he
[46:58] spoke the testimony of Jesus Christ. He
[47:01] said, "And I I look going up Calvary."
[47:04] Now, I think it's good for us to take a
[47:07] a prophet's insight and see how he
[47:10] describes this.
[47:12] He said, ' And I see someone going down
[47:14] through Jerusalem.
[47:16] He has a garment on that's wo throughout
[47:19] without a seam. And I wonder why them
[47:22] little red specks was all over it. After
[47:25] a while, they begin to get bigger. And
[47:28] all those specks finally ran together.
[47:32] It's one big bloody garment. I hear it
[47:35] slapping against his legs. What was it?
[47:39] It was the lamb of God that was going to
[47:43] Calvary to be crucified
[47:46] and had to die. For only out of death
[47:48] comes life. That's the phrase I want you
[47:51] to remember. Only out of death comes
[47:54] life. And he repeats it. Lest a corn of
[47:57] wheat falls into the ground, it abides
[48:01] alone, but if it dies,
[48:05] it produces life.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:09] And he said he was so dead in another
[48:12] message in the intunement when he bowed
[48:15] his head and the earth shook and the
[48:18] rocks rent and the temple veil tore from
[48:21] top to bottom and the sacrifice blocks
[48:24] where they sacrificed animals turned
[48:26] over and the son of the living God died.
[48:30] He was so dead till the sun recognized
[48:32] it.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; He was so dead till the moon recognized
[48:36] it. He was so dead till the stars
[48:39] recognized it. He was so dead till the
[48:41] earth recognized it. He was so dead till
[48:44] the elements recognized it, the
[48:46] atmosphere recognized it. Everything had
[48:49] to know that the son of God to know that
[48:52] he was the son of God and for God's word
[48:57] could not fail.
[49:00] And so we understand that and that's why
[49:02] we're here. But the scripture also
[49:04] speaks of those that were dead in
[49:08] trespasses and sins and unbelief,
[49:11] trespasses and unbelief. And unbelief
[49:14] will bring trespass.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; We think of Gyrus, the ruler of the
[49:20] synagogue. He had a 12year-old daughter.
[49:23] And this 12-year-old daughter died. I
[49:25] mean, she died.
[49:28] And the Bible says although he was a
[49:31] ruler of the synagogue, but he came and
[49:33] he fell down at the feet of Jesus
[49:37] and he besought him that he would come
[49:39] to his house and all the people wept
[49:41] because while he was being beseeching
[49:45] Jesus to come to his house, a messenger
[49:48] ran and said, "Don't trouble the master.
[49:51] She's died."
[49:54] And they and Jesus he went and they all
[49:57] wept and bewailed
[49:59] her passing but he said weep not for she
[50:03] is not dead
[50:06] &gt;&gt; but sleepeth. So now this has to this
[50:09] has to take and jerk our thinking out
[50:13] from you know just a tunnel vision of
[50:16] death is the expiration of the body
[50:20] because now we have the words of Jesus
[50:21] saying she's not dead but she sleepeth
[50:24] and they laughed him to scorn knowing
[50:26] that she was dead
[50:29] and he put them all out
[50:32] and he took her by the hand and called
[50:35] her saying made rise eyes and her spirit
[50:39] came again. Wherever it was, here was
[50:42] the master of the spirit.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Here was the master of the destination
[50:46] of our spirit.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Calling it back.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; And how we rejoice. And I was with
[50:53] brother Brandham. He said, "We have five
[50:55] cases. We have five the certificates of
[50:58] five cases in our office." And now once
[51:02] again came a a a voice with authority
[51:06] that God honored
[51:08] &gt;&gt; and God was behind it
[51:10] &gt;&gt; calling the spirit from wherever it was
[51:12] to come back.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; So we find death as we have interpreted
[51:17] isn't exactly death because we have one
[51:20] or there is one
[51:22] &gt;&gt; that is greater than death itself. Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; And her spirit came again and she arose
[51:28] straightway and he commanded that they
[51:31] give her meat, something to eat.
[51:35] On another I'm just laying a little bit
[51:37] of foundation. On another occasion,
[51:39] Jesus hears of his friend Lazarus is
[51:42] sick and they've called for him to come
[51:45] and pray pray for him,
[51:49] come and visit him.
[51:52] And uh the scripture says that he waited
[51:54] two more days.
[51:56] He didn't go. He heard our friend
[52:00] Lazarus. Then Jesus told his disciples,
[52:02] "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth,
[52:06] but I go that I may awake him out of his
[52:09] sleep."
[52:11] And they then said Jesus unto them
[52:14] plainly, because they said, "Oh, if he
[52:16] sleeps, he does well."
[52:18] And Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus
[52:21] is dead."
[52:23] And when he had thus spoken
[52:26] on down, because he came to the had his
[52:28] conversation with Martha and Mary, and
[52:31] then came to the place where they had
[52:34] him.
[52:36] And he said when he had spoken, he cried
[52:39] with a loud voice,
[52:41] loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth."
[52:46] and he came forth bound said loose him
[52:49] and let him go.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; So death, that's death at a different
[52:55] level.
[52:57] And now still a further different level.
[52:59] Now we're moving in. Want your kind
[53:03] attention. I appreciate it. God speaking
[53:07] to Adam and Eve. But of the tree of
[53:10] knowledge of good and evil. This is a
[53:13] critical verse for me this morning. Thou
[53:16] shalt not eat of it, for in the day that
[53:19] thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely
[53:22] die.
[53:25] Adam lived for 930 years.
[53:29] Now we know that the day is a thousand
[53:31] years and he could not live the thousand
[53:33] years. Methuselah couldn't break the
[53:35] thousand years. He lived 969. No man
[53:38] could break the thousand-year day. But
[53:42] in the 24-hour period or an immediate
[53:45] reaction of death did not happen, Adam
[53:49] did not expire.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; He did not take his last breath. He
[53:54] lived on to experience the pain of of
[53:58] his unbelief.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; He lived on for 930 years. And he saw a
[54:04] lot of things in 930 years. generations
[54:08] of of children and families that came
[54:10] up.
[54:12] But death was introduced
[54:15] to the world
[54:18] before
[54:20] he passed away.
[54:23] He saw the reign of death. He saw death
[54:28] come into its into into its uh
[54:31] fullfledged. He saw death. He saw
[54:34] murder. He saw it all happen.
[54:38] And the scripture says by Apostle Paul,
[54:41] Romans 5:12, "Wherefore by one man sin
[54:45] entered into the world and through death
[54:48] and and death by sin and so death passed
[54:52] upon all men for that all have sinned."
[54:57] And thus from that time we're living
[55:00] here uh wife and I driving to the church
[55:03] this morning thinking sometimes I feel
[55:06] so humbled almost humiliated that we
[55:10] look at things such as I I I said look
[55:13] look at this field out here look at all
[55:15] this black dirt just just dirt that's
[55:19] been here for centuries
[55:23] &gt;&gt; I'm here for a few years
[55:26] &gt;&gt; you're just here for a few years. You're
[55:27] just here for a breath.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; I look at those trees on Vancouver
[55:33] Island, great monster Douglas fur trees
[55:36] there in McMillan Park, just this side
[55:39] of Port Al Bernie where brother Brando's
[55:41] meetings was. And I look at those trees
[55:42] and they've been standing there for
[55:44] about 300 years or more. And I just look
[55:47] at the bark. I think this is just bark
[55:50] on this tree. Big rough bark on a fur
[55:54] Douglas fur tree. And it's been here
[55:56] longer than I'm here. And when I'm gone,
[55:58] it'll still be here.
[56:00] I think, you know, what is this bark
[56:03] worth? What is this tree worth? What is
[56:05] this wood worth? And here we are. Oh,
[56:08] humans. And we can think things and we
[56:10] can invent things and we've we've got
[56:12] all this energy and we've got all this
[56:14] what and God just allows it to pass off
[56:17] the scene.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; We're not here for very long, friends.
[56:25] Thank God that we have a promise.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; And thus began the reign of sin and
[56:34] death. And the scripture goes on to say,
[56:36] "Thus as sin hath reigned unto death,
[56:40] even so might grace reign through
[56:42] righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus
[56:46] Christ our Lord."
[56:49] Now I'm bringing this parallel as I
[56:50] mentioned earlier between the uh
[56:53] physical and the spiritual death and
[56:56] resurrection. A physical death, a
[56:58] physical resurrection, a spiritual death
[57:00] and a spiritual resurrection.
[57:02] Whether it's applied to the individual
[57:05] or applied to all all of humanity, for
[57:10] all have sinned, all are under the reign
[57:12] and the sentence of death.
[57:15] every person I'm speaking to today,
[57:21] man. Here we are now
[57:24] as we're seated here. All we are is uh
[57:28] we're just
[57:30] dust.
[57:33] We all look different, but we're just
[57:35] dust.
[57:39] And if you could possibly
[57:42] imagine six billion plus people,
[57:46] all it is
[57:48] is God having taken the dust of the
[57:52] earth.
[57:54] Out of the dust of the earth come botney
[57:56] life.
[57:58] Out of the dust of the earth has come
[57:59] the animal life.
[58:03] And when it's and when it expires it
[58:06] goes back to the earth
[58:09] and all we are all of humanity is just
[58:14] waving over the earth and
[58:18] moving sea of humanity
[58:20] but all it is is earth that has been
[58:23] raised to its highest level.
[58:27] This that you're in is the highest level
[58:29] that God allowed the soil to reach. And
[58:33] God took and formed man out of the
[58:36] earth. And that's all you are.
[58:40] However many cents that's worth, but
[58:42] that's all we are. And these bodies are
[58:45] going to go back to dust.
[58:48] You're quiet, but that's still the
[58:50] truth.
[58:51] You've got big plans and we've got big
[58:54] ideas and everything else, but you are
[58:56] just a few a few
[58:59] spoonfuls of ashes, dusted ashes,
[59:03] and short of a rapture
[59:06] and short of a resurrection,
[59:09] that's where everybody's headed anyway.
[59:14] In this life we might have different
[59:15] status and different station and live
[59:17] differently and have different culture
[59:19] whatever more but be it known that it's
[59:22] all dust and ashes. That's all it is.
[59:24] It's good for us to keep that in mind.
[59:27] But that is the highest form that God
[59:29] allowed the dust of the earth to be
[59:32] raised up to. Now we've had advancement.
[59:37] We've had advancement in civilization.
[59:41] But the higher we rise,
[59:45] the higher the civilization becomes,
[59:49] it's amazing, the the more intelligent
[59:52] it becomes or as we understand it, the
[59:54] more death
[59:56] &gt;&gt; is associated with it.
[1:00:00] Brother Brandham said, "Now, as it was
[1:00:02] in the days of Noah,
[1:00:04] said they were smart men back there with
[1:00:08] their atomic powers
[1:00:10] and everything. They could build
[1:00:13] pyramids
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; and the Sphinx
[1:00:17] and so forth." And then the scripture
[1:00:19] says, "As it was in the days of Noah, so
[1:00:21] shall it be."
[1:00:24] in proving his word. He said God spoke
[1:00:26] to Noah a message that certainly was un
[1:00:29] unscientific
[1:00:31] and unbelievable and no one could
[1:00:34] believe that it was because it had never
[1:00:37] rained upon the earth. God watered it
[1:00:40] with dew. He says and perhaps there's
[1:00:43] there was they were a greater scientific
[1:00:45] age than we are now
[1:00:48] because they built pyramids and the
[1:00:50] sphinx and so forth. And in those days,
[1:00:52] he says, the things that we can't build
[1:00:54] now,
[1:00:57] he says they were acquainted with power,
[1:00:59] some kind of mechanical power, perhaps
[1:01:02] atomic or something that they could lift
[1:01:06] those big boulders that we couldn't do
[1:01:09] it today, but they did great scientific
[1:01:13] things. They had something that they
[1:01:15] could embomb a body and make it look
[1:01:18] natural for hundreds of years. and we've
[1:01:21] lost that art.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; They were smart people.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "As it was in the days
[1:01:29] of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of
[1:01:31] the son of man." And we know that we are
[1:01:34] to enter into another great scientific
[1:01:37] age.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; So now catch my point.
[1:01:41] There was
[1:01:43] perhaps people even of a greater
[1:01:45] intelligence
[1:01:47] and greater achievements in a different
[1:01:50] type of culture back then. And today, of
[1:01:53] course, we're in another direction. But
[1:01:55] in in one sense of the word, there has
[1:01:58] been a resurrection
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; of that intelligence.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; There has been a resurrection of the
[1:02:06] scientific world as it was. Jesus said
[1:02:10] in the days of Noah because when Jesus
[1:02:13] said that it wasn't like that they
[1:02:16] didn't have the television. They didn't
[1:02:18] have atomic power when Jesus was here.
[1:02:21] They didn't have those things. They had
[1:02:23] had them but they didn't have them then.
[1:02:25] But he said there'll be a resurrection
[1:02:27] of it. In other words,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; it will rise again. There'll be a
[1:02:32] renewal of it. There'll be a revival of
[1:02:34] it. It will come again. those great days
[1:02:37] from back there will arrive again in the
[1:02:40] end time. And when you see that, you
[1:02:42] know that's the time.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; But it's a false resurrection.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; They'll come and they'll begin to
[1:02:53] develop cell cells and they'll begin to
[1:02:56] cross cells and they'll begin to they'll
[1:02:59] come right to the edge of creating life.
[1:03:02] Right.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; They will do fearful things. They have
[1:03:06] right here at the University of British
[1:03:08] Columbia. I understand a few years ago
[1:03:10] that they had a they had a discovery and
[1:03:13] it it scared them and they destroyed it
[1:03:18] because it was too frightening it might.
[1:03:20] And today, of course, there's great
[1:03:21] debates going on even in Washington,
[1:03:27] what they can do with the cells and what
[1:03:29] they will allow and and and it'll go
[1:03:31] over the edge and and will it be morally
[1:03:33] correct and and all of these things. And
[1:03:36] the Catholic Church is against it and
[1:03:37] some people are for it and and they're
[1:03:39] having all kinds of debates because
[1:03:41] they're developing and playing with the
[1:03:43] cell life.
[1:03:45] I'm not interested in the politics of
[1:03:47] it. All I say is there's there has been
[1:03:49] a false resurrection
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; of the scientific world because man
[1:03:56] keeps feeling it'll it'll get better and
[1:03:58] it'll get better and it'll get better
[1:04:00] because he's been biting off of the tree
[1:04:03] of knowledge.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; But the tree of knowledge can never
[1:04:06] bring the resurrection you and I need.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; It's a false resurrection.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; It's a false security. It's a false joy.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And now after they have come uh look at
[1:04:23] what they're discussing, look what
[1:04:25] they're debating. Look what the great
[1:04:26] nations of superpowers are trying to
[1:04:29] come to. Because even the current
[1:04:31] president of the United States wants to
[1:04:33] discuss with the w with the uh atomic uh
[1:04:37] those that have atomic power, nuclear
[1:04:40] power, that we should disband and
[1:04:44] destroy our nuclear powers, so we'll
[1:04:47] have a more peaceful world. It'll never
[1:04:51] happen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Not because I'm a pessimist. I'm an
[1:04:55] optimist. I'm going to live forever by
[1:04:57] God's grace.
[1:04:59] because I'm looking for another
[1:05:01] resurrection which we will talk about in
[1:05:03] a few minutes
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; a different kind of a resurrection but
[1:05:07] there has been I want you to see in
[1:05:10] humanity humanity has had they've come
[1:05:13] from their greatness and it died out
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; and then it raised again and and man is
[1:05:19] gloring in his achievements and his
[1:05:22] accomplishments he's gloring in a false
[1:05:25] resurrection
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; you may need to think about that.
[1:05:31] But the more advanced we become,
[1:05:34] the more death there is. And here's a
[1:05:36] prophet. Oh, I thank God what insight he
[1:05:40] had even back there listening.
[1:05:43] He was talking to a doctor.
[1:05:46] And he said, "Doctor, you excuse me for
[1:05:48] talking to you like this? You're a smart
[1:05:50] man."
[1:05:52] But I said he, you know, when the trees
[1:05:55] in the Garden of Eden, there were two of
[1:05:58] them, and one of them was the tree of
[1:06:00] knowledge and the other one was the tree
[1:06:02] of life.
[1:06:04] And when he took his first bite off the
[1:06:06] tree, the tree of knowledge, he
[1:06:08] separated himself from his maker. And
[1:06:12] ever since then, he's been biting off
[1:06:15] that tree. And every time he bites off
[1:06:18] that tree, he destroys himself. Does
[1:06:21] this congregation believe
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; what this messenger said?
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; He said he destroys himself. He said God
[1:06:29] doesn't destroy. God destroys nothing.
[1:06:33] Man destroys himself by knowledge.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; That's the results of living off that
[1:06:41] tree.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; But as long as he stayed with the tree
[1:06:44] of life, he lived forever. But when he
[1:06:48] left the tree,
[1:06:50] the tree of life, and ate off this tree,
[1:06:53] disobeying God, and then the question
[1:06:56] mark might come across God's word, he
[1:06:59] said, "And when the question mark comes
[1:07:02] across God's word, I say to this
[1:07:06] congregation today and all that may hear
[1:07:09] my voice or ever hear it, I'm repeating
[1:07:12] these words. I'm giving echo to this
[1:07:14] vindicated messenger." and all he says
[1:07:17] and when the question mark comes over
[1:07:21] God's word he says then to me death
[1:07:24] comes in
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; and when the question mark comes across
[1:07:28] your heart
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; of God's word
[1:07:32] and when the question mark comes in your
[1:07:35] heart across God's word death comes in
[1:07:49] So, in a sense, as I said a moment ago,
[1:07:57] man has been experiencing, and I'd like
[1:07:58] to say to this congregation,
[1:08:01] don't get caught up in a false
[1:08:04] resurrection.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Things are great. you young people and
[1:08:12] we've got a lot of young blood in this
[1:08:15] congregation and fine healthy bodies and
[1:08:18] beautiful young people.
[1:08:21] You got a future ahead of you, whatever
[1:08:24] that future might be.
[1:08:27] But this isn't your future. You've got
[1:08:30] to count on a future that's beyond this.
[1:08:32] Because everything that is man touches,
[1:08:35] death is associated with it. Regardless
[1:08:38] of how fine or how nice or how refined
[1:08:40] or how cultured it becomes, it's death.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; The more inventions is death.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; And I say and declare, God's going to
[1:08:49] destroy it. Because Jesus came not just
[1:08:52] to die at Calvary and to go to the tomb
[1:08:55] and to raise out of the tomb, but the
[1:08:57] scripture says he came to destroy the
[1:09:00] works of the devil.
[1:09:03] He came to destroy these fine things
[1:09:06] that only produce death.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says they take the gas and
[1:09:12] the and the oil and so on out of the
[1:09:14] ground and put it into a car and all the
[1:09:16] rest of it. Drive down the road 90 m an
[1:09:18] hour and kill some people more killed on
[1:09:21] the highways and been killed in all the
[1:09:23] wars.
[1:09:30] The Bible says this
[1:09:33] in Revelation 9:6 says, "And in those
[1:09:35] days
[1:09:39] shall men seek death
[1:09:43] and shall not find it,
[1:09:49] and shall desire to die,
[1:09:52] and death shall flee from them.
[1:09:58] That's new, isn't it?
[1:10:01] They will seek death.
[1:10:04] Where is it? And they can't find it.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; And they will seek to die and it'll flee
[1:10:11] from them.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; That's God's word. Amen.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; That's the same God that said,
[1:10:23] "You eat of this and you'll die."
[1:10:27] It's the same God said, "You eat of this
[1:10:29] and you'll live."
[1:10:33] In the message, things that are to be,
[1:10:35] I'm following, and I trust you can
[1:10:36] follow closely. He said, 'I'll prove to
[1:10:39] you that education and science and
[1:10:42] civilization and all these things that
[1:10:43] we so seemingly enjoy
[1:10:48] is of Satan and will perish.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; You and I need to agree with that. Amen.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "You say civilization?" Yes,
[1:10:59] sir. This civilization came by Satan in
[1:11:01] Genesis 4 says it started off this
[1:11:03] civilization by building cities and
[1:11:05] having organs and having music and
[1:11:08] having all of these things. Not that
[1:11:09] music is of evil, but I can tell you
[1:11:12] that it can sure be used for evil.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; And we certainly know that today and so
[1:11:16] forth. And the civilization came by
[1:11:17] knowledge and knowledge is what the
[1:11:19] devil sold to Eve.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; That was her temptation. And that was
[1:11:24] the allurement. You'll be like God's.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; You'll know good and evil.
[1:11:31] And caused her to transgress God's
[1:11:34] commandment. So, and this I have
[1:11:37] highlighted for you. So, there will be a
[1:11:41] civilization in a world that we're going
[1:11:44] to.
[1:11:47] I'm glad for a powerful vindication
[1:11:50] behind this voice
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; that we're going to, but it won't be
[1:11:54] this kind of a civilization. For in this
[1:11:56] civilization, we have sickness,
[1:11:59] we have sorrow, we have lust, we have
[1:12:03] death. Everything in this civilization's
[1:12:06] wrong. But in the civilization, but in
[1:12:08] that civilization, there will be none of
[1:12:12] these things.
[1:12:15] Why? Because we're already in a
[1:12:18] resurrection.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; The world is having their resurrection.
[1:12:23] But there's a spiritual resurrection
[1:12:26] taking place.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope I pray God make that a
[1:12:33] reality to you. This is the focus of my
[1:12:36] of my message to you.
[1:12:39] You split a molecule. split an atom and
[1:12:42] do so and so and blow you up. Take
[1:12:45] gunpowder, bang this, kill something.
[1:12:48] You take the car, take the gasoline, the
[1:12:50] materials out of the earth and loosen up
[1:12:52] the fibers so it can blow up and go down
[1:12:55] the road 90 m an hour and kill somebody.
[1:12:59] The kingdom of God will have no none of
[1:13:01] these things.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, the kingdom of God, I
[1:13:08] don't care if I ever see another
[1:13:09] airplane.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; I ever care see another automobile
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; or gas pump.
[1:13:22] He said, "What if science
[1:13:25] What if science had found something, a
[1:13:28] little medicine
[1:13:29] that could put in a spoon and could pour
[1:13:32] it in an old man's mouth
[1:13:36] or an old woman 90 years old and watch
[1:13:40] that watch the patient for about one
[1:13:42] minute and see them return back to a
[1:13:45] young man and woman with a blood that
[1:13:48] would never get old and a being that
[1:13:51] would never die. Why? He said the
[1:13:54] whistles would blow.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; The nations would scream.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Death was over.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; I hadn't intended on this, and this
[1:14:07] isn't a place for light moments, but
[1:14:10] a an old man came from
[1:14:14] way out in the country, out in the
[1:14:15] hills, out in the sticks, and he had
[1:14:17] never seen the city or civilization.
[1:14:19] And he came in, looked at all these
[1:14:21] towers and I mean all this glass and
[1:14:24] marble and stuff and I mean he was just
[1:14:27] dazzled by it and he walked into a one
[1:14:30] of these places and he saw in a
[1:14:33] department store and he just standing
[1:14:34] there and he stands. He didn't know what
[1:14:36] an elevator was and he just saw an old
[1:14:39] woman walk in this elevator and the
[1:14:40] doors closed and the whole thing and he
[1:14:43] just stand there totally amazed. He
[1:14:45] doesn't know what's happening and a
[1:14:47] couple moments later the doors open. and
[1:14:49] a young lady walked out. He said, he
[1:14:51] said, "Just a second. I'll go and get my
[1:14:53] wife."
[1:14:56] He thought that's that's what it was
[1:14:58] doing.
[1:15:00] And this is what exactly what Brother
[1:15:01] Brandham is saying. Well, if they ever
[1:15:03] developed a med medicine and some kind
[1:15:06] of development and and and and you put
[1:15:09] it in a purse and they swallowed it in a
[1:15:10] few minutes, you washed them and they
[1:15:11] just started returning. Of course,
[1:15:14] everything would the whistles would go
[1:15:16] and the nations would scream and and
[1:15:19] they they've really developed something.
[1:15:22] Friends, we're not following some idol
[1:15:26] myth.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; This is a reality. Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; I have to convey to you things that you
[1:15:33] have heard and yet you believe in your
[1:15:36] heart, but I'm praying that God will
[1:15:38] make it such a a a conscious reality to
[1:15:41] you. A conscious reality that you'll
[1:15:44] feel it even within your being.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Your theophony, you
[1:15:50] have a theophony body, not this one,
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; but one that's not going to perish."
[1:15:57] And he said, "Furthermore, it's right
[1:15:59] beside you.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; It is a word." That's why this word came
[1:16:04] to introduce you to that body
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; and to give you your life's pathway from
[1:16:11] this one to that one.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; And he would speak his word. That's why
[1:16:16] Jesus said, "He that believeth on me
[1:16:19] shall never die."
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:22] He didn't say that this body wouldn't
[1:16:24] pass away, but you will never die.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; You will never be separated from God
[1:16:31] because you take and embrace his word.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; You embrace his promise.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Say my father promised this.
[1:16:40] Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; So even in the resurrection of Jesus
[1:16:44] Christ
[1:16:46] when the women came to the tomb
[1:16:49] and found he was not there. Yes sir.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; And they came with spices because they
[1:16:55] had a different agenda, a different
[1:16:57] program
[1:16:59] according to their culture. They came
[1:17:00] with spices to anoint his body. But he
[1:17:03] wasn't there
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; and angels were there. And yet somehow
[1:17:09] they could they could not reason it
[1:17:11] away. But it wasn't that strange. It was
[1:17:13] just a fearful sight.
[1:17:16] And he said, "He's not here. Why are you
[1:17:19] seeking the living among the dead?"
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; And I think of that today.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; I think of the churches and the
[1:17:27] organizations and the traditions. They
[1:17:29] have history.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; They have tradition.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; They have something that they can
[1:17:34] remember from years ago. I'm not talking
[1:17:37] about 2,000 years ago. I'm talking about
[1:17:39] now.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; And if we have just a history, if we
[1:17:43] have just a lot of theology, if we have
[1:17:46] just ceremonies about the resurrection
[1:17:48] of Jesus Christ, I can tell you friends
[1:17:51] that that
[1:17:53] that's empty.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; And people are seeking the living among
[1:17:57] the dead.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus came out of the tomb and Mary.
[1:18:07] She sees him.
[1:18:10] Listen now. She just been with him hours
[1:18:12] ago.
[1:18:16] She's looked into his eyes. She's
[1:18:18] watched his lips move. She's heard the
[1:18:20] words fall from his lips.
[1:18:23] Who knows this face any better than
[1:18:25] hermen?
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Who followed and ministered to him? And
[1:18:31] now something has transpired. And the
[1:18:33] scripture says his visage, his body, his
[1:18:37] face was marred more than any man.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; His beard was pulled out. He had the
[1:18:43] spittle of those cruel Roman soldiers
[1:18:46] hanging on his face and the and the
[1:18:48] thorns in his brow. He was mutilated.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; But now stands a man. He's in a body
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; and she supposes him to be the gardener
[1:19:04] in the garden.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus is giving you and I an exact
[1:19:09] example
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; of what the believer comes to.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; This is not a myth, not a story. And if
[1:19:17] people don't believe that, they should
[1:19:18] empty out of their churches and forget
[1:19:20] Easter alto together. This is Easter.
[1:19:24] This is what Easter's all about.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Not just that he came out of the tomb,
[1:19:30] but how he came out of the tomb. And
[1:19:32] what kind of a body did he have out of
[1:19:33] the tomb? Because then he said, "Because
[1:19:36] I live, you shall live also."
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; You'll have the same kind of life by
[1:19:41] following the same kind of word. He was
[1:19:43] the word
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; and you are the word
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; if you believe his word. And he gives
[1:19:52] you the opportunity to believe that
[1:19:54] word. And how do we know which word it
[1:19:57] is? He vindicates it.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; The word comes to the prophet.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Doesn't come to the Bible school.
[1:20:04] Doesn't come to a school of theology.
[1:20:07] Doesn't come to all this other uh you
[1:20:10] know studious and may be very sincere.
[1:20:12] I'm nothing against that. I'm say I'm
[1:20:15] not so against something as I am for
[1:20:18] something. And when God sends a kind of
[1:20:20] ministry sent in this day,
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; you know what brother Brandham says
[1:20:26] concerning his ministry and you need to
[1:20:28] really take it serious.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; He speaks of the sign of the
[1:20:33] resurrection. This is the sign of the
[1:20:36] resurrection and continues from then.
[1:20:39] This is what you've been called under.
[1:20:47] We got Canadians here. We've got
[1:20:49] Americans here. We've got people from
[1:20:52] maybe the 30 some nations here. I'm a
[1:20:55] Canadian. We got all kinds of Americans.
[1:20:57] Brother Chris, Sister Cigid, and Brother
[1:21:00] Joe, Sister Barbara, Americans, and so
[1:21:03] many others. Maybe 250 of you or more.
[1:21:06] Have you ever seen the Constitution?
[1:21:09] No. You've never looked on it. I don't I
[1:21:11] doubt it very much.
[1:21:13] I I've never seen our charter,
[1:21:18] but I have faith that it's there
[1:21:20] someplace.
[1:21:22] I guess it's in some
[1:21:25] vault or someplace,
[1:21:27] but I believe that charter speaks of me.
[1:21:31] I believe that charter gives me certain
[1:21:33] protection.
[1:21:34] I believe your constitution gives you
[1:21:36] certain liberties
[1:21:38] and gives you certain protection. I'm an
[1:21:41] American and there's a constitution. I'm
[1:21:45] a Canadian or I'm whatever more and my
[1:21:47] nation's going to stand behind me
[1:21:49] because it's written
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; and I'm a citizen of that nation that
[1:21:53] has written these things. Well, I have a
[1:21:55] prophet
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; and I have a Lord Jesus that has told me
[1:21:59] I'm a citizen of another country. In
[1:22:02] fact, as my Lord Jesus said, you are not
[1:22:04] of this world.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Do you want to say amen to that?
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; If you want this world, you're welcome
[1:22:13] to it.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; You can have my piece of it. In fact,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; I'll take the next one.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; You are not of this world.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Because I live, you shall live also.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; That kind of life I desire. That kind of
[1:22:29] life he promised me. That kind of body
[1:22:32] he promised me. This one has sickness.
[1:22:35] This one has pain. This one has sorrow.
[1:22:39] This one has a troubled heart. But that
[1:22:41] one knows nothing of these things.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister, this is a time
[1:22:47] to rejoice.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Not only that Jesus raised from the
[1:22:51] dead, but I raised from the dead.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; We've raised.
[1:22:58] And I'll prove to you we're in the
[1:23:00] resurrection at this moment.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; While the world is advancing, the bride
[1:23:04] of Jesus Christ is advancing.
[1:23:06] [Applause]
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; The body of Jesus Christ is having a
[1:23:13] resurrection
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; even at this moment.
[1:23:19] But if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:23:21] Christ from the dead dwell in you, he
[1:23:25] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:23:27] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; by his spirit that dwelleth in you.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; It will even have an effect on this
[1:23:37] mortal body.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; It will direct that spirit will direct
[1:23:41] this mortal body.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:47] We won't think the same.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; We won't speak the same. We won't go to
[1:23:52] the same places. We won't act the same.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Don't let the world try to dictate how
[1:23:57] you're supposed to live.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; The world doesn't know how to live.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:11] I remember when I just moved here to
[1:24:14] Cloverdale and
[1:24:16] my girls came from school and they said,
[1:24:19] "We've got a we've got we we've been
[1:24:21] introduced now. There's a class and it's
[1:24:23] a dance class."
[1:24:25] And the teacher knows
[1:24:29] more or less that we're
[1:24:31] Christians and believers and that we
[1:24:33] don't believe in those things. But the
[1:24:36] the teacher even said very specifically
[1:24:38] and this class has credits
[1:24:43] and if you don't enter this class,
[1:24:44] you're not going to get these credits.
[1:24:47] And so I wrote a letter and I sent it to
[1:24:50] about eight other ministers throughout
[1:24:52] this area
[1:24:56] and I wrote a letter to department of
[1:24:58] education to the superintendent of the
[1:24:59] school and to the principal
[1:25:02] and I said I understand that the
[1:25:03] educational system is to teach my
[1:25:05] children the basic and the fundamental
[1:25:08] things. So to assist them
[1:25:12] into in life and the basic things of
[1:25:15] mathematics and reading and and these
[1:25:17] skills
[1:25:19] but as far as their social life is
[1:25:21] concerned as far as the social life of
[1:25:22] my children are concerned that will be
[1:25:25] our responsibility solely our
[1:25:27] responsibility and not the educational
[1:25:29] system.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; It'll be ours
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; because ours is a a million light years
[1:25:36] perhaps from someone else's. Amen.
[1:25:41] And so the teacher at the next dance
[1:25:43] class said, "Well, I understand that
[1:25:45] some of you aren't able to take this."
[1:25:47] So he said, "Uh, you can go and just,
[1:25:50] uh, play with the basketball up on the
[1:25:52] stage or something." And man, a whole
[1:25:55] bunch of the young men and a whole bunch
[1:25:57] of the young people just vacated the
[1:25:59] dance class like that. He says, "Hey,
[1:26:01] hey, no, no, come back here. I know that
[1:26:03] you can do it." Now, they didn't want it
[1:26:05] at all. The whole thing collapsed. I
[1:26:07] said, "Praise God.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Devil trying to sneak in and take your
[1:26:14] children and tell them what they're
[1:26:15] going to do." And uh and and and well, I
[1:26:19] will get off that right now because
[1:26:21] thank God for the school.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; If the spirit of him that raised up
[1:26:30] Christ from the dead, how are we doing
[1:26:31] for time? All right. Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; And in Ephesians he said, "And hath
[1:26:37] raised us up and made us to sit in
[1:26:40] heavenly places in Christ Jesus." The
[1:26:43] scripture says, "Buried with him in
[1:26:44] baptism."
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Have you been buried with him? With him
[1:26:48] in baptism.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Not the father.
[1:26:53] He wasn't buried.
[1:26:56] Not the Holy Ghost. It was Jesus Christ
[1:26:59] that was buried. You're buried with him
[1:27:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:27:05] Buried with him in water and buried with
[1:27:07] him in baptism wherein also you are
[1:27:10] risen with him through the faith of the
[1:27:14] operation of God who hath raised him
[1:27:17] from the dead.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Are you following this?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; See, there may be someone here, maybe
[1:27:25] someone out on the internet. If you have
[1:27:28] faith in the operation that God raised
[1:27:31] Jesus Christ from the dead and that he
[1:27:33] came to be a propitiation for your sin
[1:27:37] and for your unbelief and he was your
[1:27:39] sacrifice and I take upon me his death
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; and I'm buried with him not sprinkled
[1:27:46] with him. He wasn't sprinkled. He was
[1:27:49] buried and we're buried in baptism in
[1:27:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:27:55] take upon ourselves his death. Then the
[1:27:58] scripture tells us that you have faith
[1:28:00] in the operation, God will raise you up.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; For those of you that have been baptized
[1:28:07] in this tank, let me announce to you
[1:28:09] that the moment you came out of the
[1:28:11] water, you commenceed the resurrection.
[1:28:19] That's what that scripture says
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; through faith in the operation and you
[1:28:25] the scripture says Paul said in
[1:28:26] Ephesians and you hath he quickened not
[1:28:30] you he will quicken you he hath
[1:28:33] quickened
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; it's a finished finished program
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; not that you experienced the whole
[1:28:39] quickening but you hath he quickened
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; who were who were what dead. Say it.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; We were dead in trespasses and sins, but
[1:28:50] he has quickened you.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; How did Jesus come out of the tomb? It
[1:28:56] wasn't possible that he could stay there
[1:28:58] because the apostles said, and they
[1:29:00] referred right back to the scripture,
[1:29:02] his his flesh could not see corruption.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't have to have some uh
[1:29:10] medical science. He didn't have to have
[1:29:12] some kind of advanced program. His faith
[1:29:15] was in what was spoken by God's
[1:29:18] prophets.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's prophets.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; I want to get that across to you. When
[1:29:25] God's prophets speak it, it will happen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Whatever he has spoken in this word, it
[1:29:34] will happen exactly as he said it.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; You don't have to figure it out. You
[1:29:39] don't have to try to make it happen. It
[1:29:40] will happen
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; and it's not not possible that his flesh
[1:29:47] would see corruption
[1:29:52] and he came out of the tomb. He was
[1:29:53] quickened.
[1:29:56] I will say that the children of the
[1:29:58] world or the children of humanity
[1:30:00] as a whole have advanced as I said
[1:30:02] earlier in a false resurrection.
[1:30:06] And the children of God that have the
[1:30:08] very life of God in them are actually in
[1:30:11] a state of resurrection.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; The life of resurrection is in them.
[1:30:21] Jesus said to the people he was being
[1:30:23] questioned.
[1:30:25] He said
[1:30:27] the children of the world
[1:30:30] they marry
[1:30:32] and are given in marriage. He was being
[1:30:34] questioned by spiritual religious
[1:30:37] leaders I will say at the time says if a
[1:30:40] man dies and the way they had it back
[1:30:43] then a man would die his brother would
[1:30:44] take him it to wife as it was with Tamar
[1:30:49] going through the three sons of Judah
[1:30:53] and if he died and didn't leave any seed
[1:30:55] then the next one would take him and he
[1:30:57] died and leave no children no seed so he
[1:31:00] said all seven had her to wife in the
[1:31:04] resurrection, whose wife shall she be?"
[1:31:07] Jesus said that they hired very much.
[1:31:11] And Jesus answering said unto them, "The
[1:31:14] children of this world marry and are
[1:31:17] given in marriage. But they,
[1:31:21] the children of the world, that's a
[1:31:23] group, all living,
[1:31:26] all breathing, one could be sitting
[1:31:29] right beside another,
[1:31:32] but they
[1:31:34] which shall be accounted worthy
[1:31:37] to obtain that world,
[1:31:44] and the resurrection
[1:31:47] from the dead,
[1:31:49] neither marry nor are given in marriage.
[1:31:54] I want to emphasize they
[1:31:57] that shall be accounted worthy. I felt
[1:32:01] very very
[1:32:03] affected as I read these scriptures and
[1:32:06] knew this congregation I would be
[1:32:07] speaking to today. The children of the
[1:32:10] world.
[1:32:16] I'm moved.
[1:32:20] I hope
[1:32:22] you're not in that group.
[1:32:27] I truly hope as a servant of Christ,
[1:32:31] you're not in that group.
[1:32:39] All they can know is death
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; in this life
[1:32:44] and death in the next one.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; But they
[1:32:53] who will be counted worthy of that world
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; and the resurrection.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They have a different kind
[1:33:02] of a status and a different kind of a
[1:33:04] life.
[1:33:07] We're not going to have all this
[1:33:08] involvement and entanglement of marriage
[1:33:11] and divorce and more marriages and
[1:33:14] whatever more. They're not going to know
[1:33:16] any of that because that doesn't exist
[1:33:17] in that civilization. Neither science or
[1:33:20] airplanes or automobiles or all these
[1:33:23] fine things that have come out of the
[1:33:25] earth. Thank God it'll be gone.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to have a jubilee because I
[1:33:35] I don't have any wherewithal within
[1:33:37] myself to say I can attain to that. But
[1:33:40] I'm holding this word to myself and
[1:33:42] saying, "You said it, Father, and I
[1:33:45] believe it.
[1:33:58] Jesus didn't stop there.
[1:34:03] But they which are accounted worthy,
[1:34:07] listen closely,
[1:34:09] they,
[1:34:11] you,
[1:34:13] me, we,
[1:34:15] whoever by faith in the operation can
[1:34:17] include yourselves in that group.
[1:34:23] They neither marry nor are given in
[1:34:24] marriage. But he didn't stop there. He
[1:34:26] says, "Neither can they die anymore.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; For they are equal unto the angels and
[1:34:36] are the children of God, being the
[1:34:40] children of the resurrection."
[1:34:43] [Applause]
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; He didn't say they're going to come on
[1:34:47] the scene. They're already there.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; We're already here. They that are
[1:34:52] accounted to that, they can't die
[1:34:55] anymore
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; because they're children of the
[1:35:00] resurrection. They're already the
[1:35:02] product of the resurrection.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not sitting here just waiting till
[1:35:09] somebody comes out of the earth.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; This is earth right here.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to a lot of earth.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; We're all earth. This is earth.
[1:35:19] And we're in the midst of a
[1:35:21] resurrection.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; We're children of the resurrection. Not
[1:35:25] we shall be, we are.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; That's the words of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; You need to declare that. You need to
[1:35:33] believe that. Don't let a question mark
[1:35:35] come over your heart because with the
[1:35:37] question mark comes death.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Let Amen.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen be in your heart.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:35:47] [Applause]
[1:35:49] Don't even say, "Well, I'll get things
[1:35:51] fixed up." Don't worry about it. Let God
[1:35:53] fix the things up.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Surrender now to say amen
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; to the every word that he spoke
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; because only in that word is there life.
[1:36:04] [Music]
[1:36:16] If you don't have this message,
[1:36:19] the rising of the sun,
[1:36:22] you get it printed for you
[1:36:25] off the hub.
[1:36:27] And if you have it, read it again
[1:36:31] very slowly.
[1:36:33] I've been preaching for over 50 years.
[1:36:37] I began reading you this message again
[1:36:40] yesterday.
[1:36:42] Brother Brandham says things he his
[1:36:44] statements I'd like to read the first
[1:36:46] three or four pages to you where I began
[1:36:48] reading. They're so profound, so powerp
[1:36:51] packed. Sentence upon sentence are so
[1:36:54] potent. I read it to my wife. I said,
[1:36:57] "There isn't a there isn't a man that
[1:37:00] could say such a thing. It's God
[1:37:03] speaking directly to me through that
[1:37:05] vessel." Amen.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; So profound
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; just left me numb
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; as I thought as I read statement by
[1:37:18] statement.
[1:37:21] For those of you that don't know, I was
[1:37:23] sitting in that service
[1:37:28] 1965. I was sitting in that service.
[1:37:32] I was That's where he took the picture
[1:37:34] of the cloud and turned it.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; That's where I saw it was Jesus Christ.
[1:37:39] I saw it instantly. There just a little
[1:37:42] gasp went up over the people.
[1:37:45] That's where I and my wife were baptized
[1:37:47] immediately after the service.
[1:37:52] I can tell you that now all these years
[1:37:54] later,
[1:37:56] I got more in one hour.
[1:38:00] In one hour in this message yesterday, I
[1:38:03] got more than I did in the entire
[1:38:05] service.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; How can that be? You're right there. No.
[1:38:11] Well, I needed a resurrection.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Larry, I tell you, I needed a
[1:38:19] resurrection. And in this resurrection,
[1:38:21] while the world got smarter, I became
[1:38:24] more spiritual. I became more
[1:38:26] understanding. I begin to see the
[1:38:28] program. Oh my goodness, how wonderful
[1:38:31] this program is. Oh, how wonderful it
[1:38:34] is. I I get to places where I just feel
[1:38:37] I can take one more step and I'm going
[1:38:39] to be an immortality.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Leave this all behind.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what's going to
[1:38:44] happen?
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen to us.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Going to happen to us. He said it. Not
[1:38:49] because I'm excited. He said it. He said
[1:38:52] it. He said it. Hallelujah. God said it.
[1:38:56] God promised it. My father promised it.
[1:38:59] Hallelujah.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; It's my father that said, "All that I
[1:39:02] have is yours."
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; He said it.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; And and his messenger come. Now I'll say
[1:39:13] it and
[1:39:14] you just have to accept it.
[1:39:19] If you were to take,00
[1:39:21] plus services
[1:39:25] that were spoken by God's messenger
[1:39:29] and you listen to not hundreds but
[1:39:31] thousands of times
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; that he revealed the secret of the
[1:39:35] heart.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I sat right on the platform and watched
[1:39:39] it. my own people out of my own church
[1:39:43] who I knew he knew nothing about because
[1:39:44] I brought them to the town
[1:39:48] and tell them their name.
[1:39:52] Tell them about their life.
[1:39:55] Tell them who they were praying for.
[1:39:59] Tell them where that person was living,
[1:40:02] the name of the town, and the direction
[1:40:04] it was from where they were standing.
[1:40:07] Listen folks,
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; I hope you're smart enough to say no man
[1:40:11] could do that.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; I hope you're smart enough in this
[1:40:15] intelligent generation to say no
[1:40:17] intelligence could do that outside of
[1:40:19] God himself.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; That was God speaking.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, you got all your
[1:40:24] history books. That has never happened
[1:40:26] since Adam.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; None of the prophets of the Old
[1:40:30] Testament did things like that. We have
[1:40:33] one where where where Samuel told Saul
[1:40:36] where his fathers asked us where that he
[1:40:38] was looking for the animals. But we
[1:40:40] don't have anything where people stood
[1:40:42] and by the hundreds and by the thousands
[1:40:44] and publicly and let science record it
[1:40:47] for the generations on coming. We never
[1:40:50] had that. What is it? It's a
[1:40:52] resurrection word.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; And then he tells the people that this
[1:40:57] is the sign of the resurrection.
[1:41:02] So, it put the people into a
[1:41:04] resurrection, not a resurrection
[1:41:06] mindset, but into a resurrection move.
[1:41:09] That's why I said we're not here. We're
[1:41:11] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. This
[1:41:15] word is actually moving you to an
[1:41:18] ultimate change of the body,
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; either in a rapture or if you die,
[1:41:23] you'll come out of that earth.
[1:41:26] Hallelujah.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; We are in a resurrection
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; and you have the power to change this
[1:41:32] body even resident in you at this
[1:41:34] moment.
[1:41:35] [Applause]
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for a resurrection.
[1:41:41] We're in a resurrection.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Not another Jesus. The same Jesus.
[1:41:52] [Applause]
[1:41:54] Hallelujah.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; And he's the one who stood there and
[1:41:56] said,
[1:41:58] "As it was in the days of Noah,
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; because those days were not right at his
[1:42:03] time,
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; so shall it be."
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. in the revealing of the son of
[1:42:08] man,
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; the intelligence
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; and the the ingenuity and the
[1:42:14] advancement and the powers and the
[1:42:17] scientific achievements that were back
[1:42:19] there. They will be again.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; When civilization has its resurrection,
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; when it has its falls rising once again
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; and with it will be more death.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; With it will be more wickedness. With it
[1:42:34] there will be gross sin, darkness over
[1:42:36] all the people.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; But in that day, in the evening time,
[1:42:42] there shall be a light.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; In the evening time, there'll be a
[1:42:50] resurrection.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; I'll send the signs of the resurrection.
[1:42:56] I'll show the power of the resurrection
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; in front of the people and I'll let
[1:43:01] science confirm it. so that their own
[1:43:04] science can condemn them.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; I'll let their own camera take the
[1:43:09] picture.
[1:43:12] [Applause]
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Why don't you rejoice? Yeah.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Here's what he said. You are the seed
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; of the resurrection. Amen.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; And I say to every man, woman, and child
[1:43:41] that can understand my words, don't you
[1:43:44] dare let the devil put a question mark
[1:43:47] over that in your heart.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; You are the seed. He said, you are the
[1:43:51] seed of that resurrection of the s has
[1:43:56] dawned and the wave sheath upon the
[1:43:58] earth to make you recognize. This
[1:44:01] message was waved over the earth to make
[1:44:04] you recognize.
[1:44:08] You say, "Brother Bisco, why are you
[1:44:10] yelling and why are you preaching so
[1:44:11] hard?" Because I'm trying to get
[1:44:13] through.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; To that resistance of this generation.
[1:44:18] May God tear that wall down.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; May God remove that resistance
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; out of your heart so you can come into
[1:44:28] the fullness of your inheritance.
[1:44:36] Hallelujah.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Going to start preaching.
[1:44:40] [Applause]
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; He says, "And and the wave chief upon
[1:44:51] the earth to make you recognize that you
[1:44:54] are an eagle and not a denominational
[1:44:57] chicken."
[1:45:00] This message was waved over the earth to
[1:45:03] make you recognize that you were
[1:45:05] something different.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; You're a different make.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; You have a different uh a whole
[1:45:11] different uh uh uh sense about you.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; A different instinct.
[1:45:20] Hallelujah.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; If the spirit that raised him up from
[1:45:23] the dead, the word, the dynamic of the
[1:45:26] word dwells you in you, it'll also
[1:45:28] quicken your mortal body.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Now he says, how are we flesh of his
[1:45:32] flesh and bone of his bone? He asked the
[1:45:34] question, how are you flesh of his flesh
[1:45:36] and bone of his bone? He said, while we
[1:45:39] were yet mortal sinners to drink and run
[1:45:42] around and commit adultery and all these
[1:45:44] things, he said, it's quickened. Why? He
[1:45:47] said, "The things died
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; and you're resurrected.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; It quickens your mortal body.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; The things I used to do, I do them no
[1:45:58] more because I'm in a resurrection."
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "Therefore, your body is the
[1:46:04] temple of the dynamics."
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Because why? From the beginning, you
[1:46:09] were part of his mechanics.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why our body is a
[1:46:14] part of the dynamics because in the
[1:46:16] beginning we're part of the mechanics.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And when your body, this mechanical body
[1:46:20] had to come on the scene. He took his
[1:46:22] dynamics and poured it into the
[1:46:24] mechanics.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; God knew you were going to be born the
[1:46:29] way you were born. He knew who your
[1:46:30] mother and father was. But they they
[1:46:33] were only instruments to bring you on
[1:46:34] the scene so he could pour the dynamics
[1:46:37] into you for this age.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, help me out. I still got something
[1:46:42] to preach.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Say, I'm not preaching for you. I'm
[1:46:51] preaching for myself.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; I'm enjoying it.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; He said Easter,
[1:47:00] rising of the sun and Easter morning,
[1:47:02] not only did he Let me say this. Here's
[1:47:05] some of the things that I just want you
[1:47:07] to catch. At Easter morning, not only
[1:47:11] did he raise, but his beneficiaries
[1:47:14] raised with him.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; They were in Christ at his crucifixion.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; I was in Christ at the crucifixion.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; They were in him at the resurrection.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; I was in him.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; For he was the word, and the word was
[1:47:31] made flesh. The word hung on Calvary.
[1:47:34] And I was part of that word. You're part
[1:47:36] of that word. The word went to the tomb.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; I was with him. You were with him. The
[1:47:42] word came out of the tomb
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; in a resurrection. We've already had
[1:47:48] that resurrection. And then God brought
[1:47:50] you on the scene 2,000 years later in a
[1:47:53] body which was the mechanics. And the
[1:47:55] spirit that raised him from the dead
[1:47:57] comes into you and gives the mechanics
[1:47:59] some dynamics
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; and turns you away from the world.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; What is it? The same resurrection power
[1:48:07] continuing in you.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; I pray God make it alive to you. We are
[1:48:19] his beneficiaries quickened after being
[1:48:21] dead in darkness and in a darkened world
[1:48:24] of unbelief where churches and
[1:48:27] denominations and so forth had drawn us
[1:48:30] out. And there's something in us
[1:48:32] calling. Oh, we want God. We're
[1:48:35] hungering and thirsting for God. We
[1:48:38] joined the Methodists and we joined the
[1:48:40] Baptist. We joined the Pentecostals and
[1:48:42] the Presbyterians and whatever more and
[1:48:44] still there was something wrong. We just
[1:48:47] couldn't find it yet. And all of a
[1:48:50] sudden, while we were groping in
[1:48:52] darkness, the great resurrection came.
[1:49:02] The great resurrection came to us in the
[1:49:05] manifestation of the promised word.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; When Jesus spoke about the revealed
[1:49:15] word, can I take just a few more
[1:49:17] minutes, please?
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; When Jesus spoke about the revealed
[1:49:19] word, he was talking about himself.
[1:49:22] He was talking about himself in another
[1:49:24] time, in another era, in another age.
[1:49:27] Now I just want to take you quickly and
[1:49:28] I'm going to come to a close
[1:49:31] in the Old Testament and in the in the
[1:49:33] in the message
[1:49:35] uh in the message
[1:49:40] the rising of the sun.
[1:49:43] Brother Brandham takes you back to
[1:49:44] Exodus. I'm sorry, Leviticus
[1:49:47] 23rd chapter.
[1:49:50] And you've heard it before, but listen.
[1:49:52] God tells the people, I'll just do it
[1:49:54] rather than reading a quote, I'll just
[1:49:55] do it in in in a kind of dramatize it a
[1:49:59] wee bit. So, he's telling them, you're
[1:50:01] going to go into your promised land.
[1:50:04] And when you get in the land,
[1:50:07] he didn't put any specific dates on
[1:50:09] this. He says, "When you get in the land
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; and you have swn your crop
[1:50:15] and the first
[1:50:17] ripe mature crop,
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; you'll cut that down
[1:50:24] and you'll take that bundle
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; not to Moses the prophet.
[1:50:30] You'll take it to the priest."
[1:50:34] Because God even knew
[1:50:37] that the prophet's ministry,
[1:50:40] the prophet's ministry at this time, the
[1:50:43] message would would give us a a full
[1:50:46] scope of the instructions.
[1:50:49] But brother Brandham says clearly that
[1:50:51] the that the priest
[1:50:55] during the church ages from Christ till
[1:50:59] now from the Holy Spirit the coming of
[1:51:02] the Holy Spirit till now would be the
[1:51:05] era of the priesthood
[1:51:08] a high priest.
[1:51:10] And so in the end time would come a
[1:51:12] mature the first grain that came
[1:51:17] all through the Old Testament right from
[1:51:19] the beginning until
[1:51:22] Matthew.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Then came Jesus Christ. He was the first
[1:51:27] ripe wheat,
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; the first sheath
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; and he was cut down
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; and nailed to the cross.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; He was the first mature one.
[1:51:38] And and there and there's a transition
[1:51:40] that's taking place for he was the lamb
[1:51:43] of God. He was the sacrifice.
[1:51:46] He was the prophet. Follow it now.
[1:51:49] Prophet, priest, and king.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; He was the prophet. And he was regarded
[1:51:55] as a prophet. He was cut down. And and
[1:51:59] then
[1:52:01] when he raised then from the dead, he
[1:52:04] was entering into his priesthood. Yes.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; And the chief came to the priest
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; and he said he was waved over the people
[1:52:13] at Pentecost.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they now for the first time
[1:52:19] humanity received the same spirit that
[1:52:22] was in him.
[1:52:24] [Applause]
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; They became a God people
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; because the same spirit that was in him
[1:52:32] now came into them. He said it's
[1:52:33] necessary that I go away. It's expedient
[1:52:35] I go away. If I don't go away, he won't
[1:52:37] come.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; I must go away.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; And so now, while he's departing, he's
[1:52:43] entering into his priesthood. And then
[1:52:45] at the end time, here comes a ministry.
[1:52:48] Here comes a here comes the ministry
[1:52:50] that's going to reveal him again in the
[1:52:51] end time after the world has had a false
[1:52:54] resurrection of scientific achievement
[1:52:57] and advancement that is not getting them
[1:52:59] closer to God, but further away from
[1:53:01] God.
[1:53:03] Oh yes.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Pray that God give me strength to finish
[1:53:06] this.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; And in the end time
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; in this message he says there has to be
[1:53:13] another sheath waving.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Another sheath. The same chief doing
[1:53:20] exactly the same things. Look at how the
[1:53:23] messenger look how brother Brandham come
[1:53:24] out of such utter humility.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Exactly the same as Jesus. Look how he
[1:53:29] mingled with the people exactly as it
[1:53:31] was with Jesus. Look how Jesus went into
[1:53:33] the temple. Look how the prophet went
[1:53:35] into the denominational system. Look how
[1:53:37] he went into their churches. Look how he
[1:53:39] went into the Christian businessmen. Why
[1:53:41] was it? It was the same spirit
[1:53:45] doing the same thing.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; And the midst of it just began simply to
[1:53:50] do miracles. Miracles begin to happen.
[1:53:52] And then the multitudes came in Jesus'
[1:53:55] life. The men miracles happened. The
[1:53:57] multitudes came.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Exact duplicate.
[1:54:01] exactly the same.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; It wasn't him or some big team behind
[1:54:05] him that was doing that. It was God
[1:54:08] doing it.
[1:54:11] [Applause]
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Listen to friends. If you have a
[1:54:14] question mark over your heart, I'll
[1:54:15] announce to you, you're dealing with
[1:54:17] God.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; You're not dealing with me. You're not
[1:54:20] dealing with this church. You're not
[1:54:21] dealing with some organization. There is
[1:54:22] no organization. You're dealing with
[1:54:24] God. God did it. And you have to answer
[1:54:26] to that.
[1:54:29] I didn't do it. Brother Brandham didn't
[1:54:31] do it. He'd even just say, "I'm your
[1:54:33] brother. I can't do it.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; I'm just your brother."
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; But then say to a person, "There isn't a
[1:54:42] thing in your life you could hide right
[1:54:44] now." Who's that talking?
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Who's that talking?
[1:54:50] There isn't a thing in your life you
[1:54:51] could hide right now. I know what that's
[1:54:54] all about. But I looked into those into
[1:54:55] that eyes and knew my life was naked
[1:54:59] before God.
[1:55:01] What was it? The same Christ.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Dwelling in him.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; To bring a mature word.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Not for his enjoyment, for a people.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; And that mature word in the end time,
[1:55:13] there had to be another chief waving.
[1:55:15] That's the message that is waving over
[1:55:19] the people now.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't waved for the people. It
[1:55:23] wasn't waved for Israel. It wasn't waved
[1:55:24] for Moses. It was waved to God
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; by the priest.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Waved to God as a memorial, as a
[1:55:32] declaration. There's more like this
[1:55:36] still in the field.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "The field is the
[1:55:41] world."
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Hello, friends.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Hear my announcement. You were in the
[1:55:47] field
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; when that first chief was waved,
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; waved before God
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God came into the
[1:55:57] people and they were full of the Holy
[1:55:59] Ghost. And the memorial was, "Father,
[1:56:01] there's more like me.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; There's a Jesus people down there.
[1:56:08] They're still in the field. Their bodies
[1:56:10] are there."
[1:56:15] by the great operation of God. Bring
[1:56:16] them on the scene and the faithful Holy
[1:56:19] Spirit will come and possess them and
[1:56:21] give dynamics to the mechanics.
[1:56:25] [Applause]
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; And if they're still living in the last
[1:56:29] day, I shall raise them up. Hallelujah.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; And in the meantime, I'll set a
[1:56:36] resurrection in order in the end time
[1:56:39] while the world has its resurrection of
[1:56:42] wisdom and resurrection of culture and
[1:56:44] resurrection of entertainment and
[1:56:46] resurrection of all of these things so
[1:56:48] high that they almost blow their
[1:56:51] understanding that goes beyond their
[1:56:53] grasp of their imagination.
[1:56:55] Amen.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; It'll become so so scientific.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; In this age of technology,
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; they will bite off that tree of
[1:57:05] knowledge and there won't hardly be a
[1:57:07] person that can keep up to it. and I'll
[1:57:10] make things so real.
[1:57:15] Until, as I heard the other day, women
[1:57:18] are having
[1:57:20] entering into like marriage
[1:57:23] relationships
[1:57:25] with men that look so real on the
[1:57:27] screen.
[1:57:29] And they have the husband of the woman
[1:57:32] in tears
[1:57:34] saying, "I've lost my wife.
[1:57:38] She used to be an active woman. She's a
[1:57:40] professional woman, but all she does now
[1:57:42] is sit and this new game that they and
[1:57:46] and it is so real. And they enter into
[1:57:48] all kinds of relationships
[1:57:50] and and she's actually feels married
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; to a person on the screen.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Satan
[1:58:07] used
[1:58:11] one of God's creatures
[1:58:14] called a serpent.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham describes him.
[1:58:22] You say, "Why would I believe Brother
[1:58:24] Brandham?" Because Brother Brandham
[1:58:25] stood and told a woman that was
[1:58:27] standing, a woman that I know real well,
[1:58:29] friends of our family, told her, "You're
[1:58:31] praying for a man. The man doesn't live
[1:58:33] here. The man lives just north of here.
[1:58:36] He lives in a town called Fort St. John,
[1:58:38] if he if that prophet could trace down
[1:58:41] in her heart and tell her what she was
[1:58:43] praying and who she was praying for and
[1:58:45] where that man lived and the next day I
[1:58:47] was driving along the road with him and
[1:58:49] he said, "There's a woman that came into
[1:58:51] the prayer line." I said, "Brother
[1:58:52] Brandham happens to be good friend of my
[1:58:54] family. I know her ever since I was a
[1:58:56] child." He said, "She was praying for a
[1:58:58] man uh uh shadowed by death with
[1:59:00] cancer." And as we drove slowly by,
[1:59:03] there was an old farmhouse, big white
[1:59:04] old farmhouse off to the right. And he
[1:59:07] by the time he drove past he says the
[1:59:09] man's in that house.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Now that kind of wisdom
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; that could go back yesterday or one year
[1:59:19] or 10 years or or 6,000 years and
[1:59:22] describe that creature
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; manlike,
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; maybe better looking than Adam was. And
[1:59:30] he offered her knowledge
[1:59:33] and was so enticing
[1:59:37] that she gave herself to it
[1:59:40] and entered into a relationship
[1:59:44] with the serpent and Satan inspiring the
[1:59:46] whole thing and brought forth a Cain
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; who was an enemy lying to God's face.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Do you know that God had more
[1:59:55] conversation with Cain than he did with
[1:59:57] Abel?
[2:00:01] read it
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; by offering them. and he offered and
[2:00:08] right in the midst of
[2:00:11] you young ladies,
[2:00:15] I can tell you right here in this church
[2:00:17] that often this world and this age
[2:00:21] offers the young ladies graduating
[2:00:24] better jobs,
[2:00:26] better living standard, better
[2:00:29] automobiles than the guys that are out
[2:00:31] there struggling real hard to do it.
[2:00:34] That why? because it's that generation.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; It's that age. Don't let me go there.
[2:00:42] But in the midst of that,
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; I'll bring a resurrection.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; I'll bring a resurrection of a message
[2:00:49] and it will be exactly opposite to what
[2:00:51] the standard of the world or the
[2:00:53] standard of the day or the age of the
[2:00:55] day. Are you still with me?
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; And in that day, I'll raise up a mature
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; chief once again. and there'll be
[2:01:04] another crucifixion
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; and they'll have to indict that
[2:01:08] generation for the second crucifixion of
[2:01:10] Jesus Christ.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; They come against a message. They don't
[2:01:13] realize they haven't got the concept
[2:01:15] that the word is Christ.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; And that's one of the revelations that
[2:01:19] you and I had to get. It's not just the
[2:01:21] Bible. It's Christ.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; It's not just a series of doctrines.
[2:01:25] It's Christ.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; The person of Christ. And now he sends
[2:01:30] his dynamics.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. into the mechanics and that's what
[2:01:35] makes you the kind of people you are.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; I just talked to people just just last
[2:01:43] week. They said, "All we have in our
[2:01:45] church is old gay-haired people."
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; I said, "Will you come to our church?" I
[2:01:49] said, "The whole front end is full of
[2:01:52] young men and young women, and they fill
[2:01:55] those seats on Sunday, and they fill
[2:01:57] those seats on Wednesday." And I line up
[2:01:59] and I see the cars lined up and after 37
[2:02:02] years I say, "Oh God, this is a
[2:02:05] supernatural act."
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; We don't have a program. We don't have
[2:02:09] anything. Have the preaching of the
[2:02:11] gospel of Jesus Christ. A vindicated
[2:02:14] word in this day.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; It's not a brainwashing. It's a soul
[2:02:18] washing.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Changed.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Changed.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; We're in a resurrection. Hallelujah.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; And when this message first came, I'm
[2:02:33] closing now and was waved over this
[2:02:35] whole earth.
[2:02:38] Many of you,
[2:02:40] we're still in the earth.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; This body you're in right now was in the
[2:02:45] soil.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; God in his love and mercy
[2:02:51] allowed that ministry to wave over the
[2:02:53] people, over the congregation
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; as a memorial.
[2:02:59] Think of it. Jesus saying it. Father,
[2:03:03] there's more like me.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; In the field.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; They're still in the earth, but they're
[2:03:11] going to come. I know they're going to
[2:03:13] come
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; because I can't lose one.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; This is my resurrection message to you
[2:03:24] today. Amen.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; This is my Easter message today.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; You are the one that's in the
[2:03:30] resurrection.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; You are the one that's having a
[2:03:33] resurrection.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; And he said this, and forgive me, I'm
[2:03:45] just closing. It's been hard to close.
[2:03:48] Hard to close when you're not really
[2:03:50] fully done.
[2:04:00] And every bit of life
[2:04:04] that was in the seed
[2:04:07] has to come forth again. Every bit of
[2:04:10] life.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; I haven't got time,
[2:04:16] but you remember and I've just been I've
[2:04:17] just been in it. For those of you that
[2:04:18] have been here, I just touched on it.
[2:04:22] When the Apostle John
[2:04:25] saw into heaven
[2:04:28] and he saw the lamb and he saw the four
[2:04:31] living creatures
[2:04:33] and out came the antichrist riding in
[2:04:36] the opening of the seals. Antichrist was
[2:04:38] riding first a white horse
[2:04:42] of deception,
[2:04:44] then a red horse, a red horse of
[2:04:47] sacrifice and martyr martyology,
[2:04:51] then a black horse for the dark ages,
[2:04:54] and then a pale horse. And that's the
[2:04:57] first time, read it in chapter six of
[2:04:59] Revelation. That's the first time the
[2:05:01] horse rider is named.
[2:05:03] He said, "It's death.
[2:05:06] Hear
[2:05:11] me please.
[2:05:13] So for all these generations all all the
[2:05:16] ages while the horse riders riding
[2:05:19] riding out trying deception that doesn't
[2:05:22] work and he's trying martyrs and he slew
[2:05:25] them by the millions 68 million. I've
[2:05:28] read of some and brother Brandham said
[2:05:31] they could do nothing else but the
[2:05:33] spirit that was anointing them. They had
[2:05:35] to do what the spirit was anointing
[2:05:37] them. I give you one account. There was
[2:05:39] a man, you've heard of me tell it
[2:05:40] before. There was 22 people standing on
[2:05:43] a scaffold in a very very cold weather,
[2:05:48] very bitterly cold. and they'd stripped
[2:05:50] them naked, men and women, and had them
[2:05:53] standing there tied to freeze to death,
[2:05:57] but they could surrender if they would
[2:05:59] just recant and give up their faith.
[2:06:03] And no one would do that. And finally,
[2:06:05] when the frost and the cold begin to
[2:06:07] bite into their bodies, one man yelled
[2:06:11] that he would surrender. And they went
[2:06:13] up and untied him. And while they were
[2:06:16] untiding untying him, Brother Burkhart,
[2:06:19] another man was undoing his garments,
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; throwing his coat off and and mounting
[2:06:26] the ladder and said, "Let not the ranks
[2:06:29] of the Lord be broken."
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; They could do nothing but give
[2:06:35] themselves.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; That was the Ox age. And then the man
[2:06:39] age, Luther, Wesley, the reformation,
[2:06:43] wisdom, and at the same time when Martin
[2:06:46] Luther at the age then comes the
[2:06:48] printing press and and the and and the
[2:06:50] advancement of technology and God used
[2:06:52] it. But the advancement of technology is
[2:06:55] rising and at the same time the the
[2:06:58] gospel is rising because uh Luther come
[2:07:01] out of the dark ages is just a sprig of
[2:07:04] wheat and then into the stalk and into
[2:07:06] the end time and in the end time the
[2:07:09] rider would be death himself. He would
[2:07:11] be named. Why? Why is he named? Because
[2:07:15] in that time would come a ministry that
[2:07:17] would be 100% life.
[2:07:21] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Death was riding in, but life is riding
[2:07:24] in.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; And he said, "All the life in the seed
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; will come forth."
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; And I rejoiced yesterday.
[2:07:35] All the power that overcome the
[2:07:37] deception is in us.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; All the power of the sacrifice is in
[2:07:43] this seed.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; All the wisdom that Martin Luther and
[2:07:48] all of them had is in this seed.
[2:07:51] Hallelujah.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; All the power of Pentecost is here.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; All the power of the sacrifice is here.
[2:08:02] All the wisdom of the man age is here.
[2:08:04] And all the anointing of the eagle age
[2:08:07] is here.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; All the life that was in the sea. Amen.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; And that's the power
[2:08:21] that is resurrecting.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; That's why you're not the same. You're
[2:08:26] not the same at all.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; You're not You're not the same as you
[2:08:29] used to be. Forget that. You're not even
[2:08:31] the same like the church you came out
[2:08:32] of. You're not the same. I didn't do it.
[2:08:34] Somebody else didn't do it. Brother
[2:08:36] Brandham didn't do it. He's not even
[2:08:37] around.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; There's a force.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; There's a power. There's an in an
[2:08:45] anointing. There's a inspiration.
[2:08:48] There's a spirit. Whatever it is, but I
[2:08:50] will say what it is. It's the spirit of
[2:08:52] that word that came. That promise that
[2:08:55] came. It's a word. It's a promise to
[2:08:57] you.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; And I want you to take it very
[2:09:01] personally. Everyone,
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to see this chief that was
[2:09:06] waved in this time.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; It was waved over all the people, but
[2:09:12] wasn't for all the people. Amen.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Said there's father,
[2:09:18] there's more
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; like me.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; And that's why the messenger declared
[2:09:24] emphatically,
[2:09:26] if the life of Michelangelo is in you,
[2:09:28] you'll do artwork. If the life of Bach
[2:09:31] is in you, you'll write music. And if
[2:09:33] the life of Jesus Christ is in you,
[2:09:35] you'll live out his life.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; I speak to you today because you're
[2:09:43] children of the resurrection.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Rod, I would like to sing,

[2:10:50] Jesus rose
[2:10:53] from the dead.
[2:10:56] He will triumph
[2:10:58] but as he said
[2:11:01] that's the victory from the grave rose
[2:11:04] again our soul to say oh glory
[2:11:09] hallelujah
[2:11:12] to the lamb

[2:11:18] souls die daily to the world and sing oh

[2:13:19] [Music]
[2:13:25] Glory.
[2:13:27] Hallelujah
[2:13:30] to the lamb.
[2:13:33] Just before we sing this next verse, we
[2:13:35] put it up. You see the words?
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Can you claim those?
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Do you think they're worth shouting out?
[2:13:44] We'll rise someday.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; And after hearing today's service, I
[2:13:50] declare to you on the authority of God's
[2:13:53] word, every believer is in the midst of
[2:13:57] a resurrection.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; You're moving perhaps sometimes
[2:14:02] imperceptibly, but you are moving
[2:14:05] according to his promise.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; You are in a resurrection.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; You aren't even where you were a year
[2:14:11] ago. Hallelujah.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; You have raised.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; The world is raising as a false
[2:14:15] resurrection.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; They
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; that are accounted worthy
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; of the resurrection and eternal life.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus said clearly, they'll never die.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; That is more powerful than the casket.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; That's more powerful than six feet of
[2:14:33] earth.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:38] [Music]
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; You know something?
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:42] Some of our most victorious services
[2:14:44] have been funerals.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the people are rejoicing.
[2:14:49] And all the neighbors think we're going
[2:14:50] to be crying and weeping.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; And here we're rejoicing.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul said, "It must be sown
[2:14:56] in dishonor. And it's raised in honor.
[2:14:58] It must be sown in weakness. And it's
[2:15:00] raised in power. It must be sown mortal.
[2:15:03] And it's raised immortal." Hallelujah.
[2:15:06] What's there to be sad about?
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; We're in a resurrection.
[2:15:11] We'll rise again.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; We'll rise again as our savior rose
[2:15:19] glory
[2:15:21] to the lamb.
[2:15:24] Till they shall be brought upon
[2:15:30] glory hallelujah to the lamb.
[2:15:34] Jesus rose
[2:15:37] from the dead.
[2:15:39] He rose high
[2:15:45] the victory from the grave
[2:15:48] to say oh glory
[2:15:52] hallelujah
[2:15:54] to the lamb.
