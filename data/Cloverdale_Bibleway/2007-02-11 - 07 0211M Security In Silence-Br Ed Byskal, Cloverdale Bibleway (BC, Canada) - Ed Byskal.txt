Uh and uh we want to welcome all those who are visiting with us as well. We're real happy to have each and every one of you here if you're visiting and we want to make sure that you know that you're welcome. Um apparently we received an email from brother Ivan Girtson this morning and as you know he's been living in Grand Prairie, Alberta for more than a year. He and sister Adrien Dodd have announced their engagement. The details are on the bulletin board. So, we're happy for brother Ivan and Sister Adrien. And uh also when we're in Edmonton, um I ran into Sister Melody Stall and she wanted to make sure we passed uh her greetings, greetings of the family on to everyone down here. They've got I think about 15 people or so uh that are in Grand Prairie or not in Grand Prairie in uh in um Fort McMurray. That's right. Um um also there is a reminder to those who uh want to be involved in the Believe the Sign workshop. It's this Saturday, February 17th, here at the church.

Having as while I was listening to Sister Natasha saying, standing on holy ground. I thought in the presence of Jehovah. Amen. That's where we want to abide. That's where we want to be standing while we minister today. in the presence of Jehovah, Almighty God, creator of heavens and earth and all things that are therein, created for his pleasure and for his glory were they created. And we are his children. Amen. And he wants to bless us with his presence. Amen. [Music] in the presence of God mighty. Praise our tr [Music] in the presence of the king. I'd like to say before we sing it again, troubles do vanish. Just depending what you're expecting and hearts are mended. Are you expecting it as you prepare yourself for the word and for what God has for us in the service? Let's believe for that. Listening to a message. Yet this morning coming even to the service, I never I don't believe I've ever heard brother Brandham so clearly just teach the whole ministry and manifestation of the son of man. And the reason he did was because he was in Los Angeles. It was 1965. and he was speaking to the people and had called those that had prayer cards, called the first 20. And they were standing there lined up. And then he asked the the congregation, all the people that were there, the audience, how many have been in his meetings? And then he asked, "How many have never been in a meeting?" And the microphone just goes dead silent. Why? You can hear him kind of questioning. Did I Is this right? And he said, "Let me say that again. How many have never been in one of my meetings?" When the hands went up, he was just in he was stunned. And then even while the people were standing, he went into a teaching discourse and took the manifestation of this God in the son of man ministry and took it from Genesis all through the scripture. It was so clear. It is I believe the message does God ever change his mind of his word? The one in Los Angeles January 1965. If you ever have anybody you're wanting to introduce that ministry, that was an incredible message and then began to reveal the secrets of the hearts called the first person up and began to reveal the secrets of the hearts. Well, the people were so still, the ministry is so still, but when that manifestation when it begin to bring God on the scene, but he said that is proving that what I told you is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. and they were receiving it and receiving I would say receiving the the witness of it. But the thing was then he tried to convey to the people that same God is present right here in the ministers and you that have needs. And the same God that raised Jesus and brought him out of the tomb is right here in this service. And that is where people fail. He just can't bridge that and couldn't get them to grasp that. And that is that is our big problem. That's exactly where we are. If we could believe and be consumed with faith that that same God is present right here to do everything that he did in the prophets ministry and the apostles ministry in the ministry of Jesus Christ. If you could believe that and we could have one thought throughout this entire congregation, if you could just come to grips with your thoughts, bring them into captivity and have that simple faith, there wouldn't be anything impossible. &gt;&gt; And I believe what he said, there wouldn't be a sick person in the building in the next 5 minutes. &gt;&gt; I believe that. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can truly say troubles vanish &gt;&gt; and hearts are mended. &gt;&gt; You got a problem, you got a weight on you this morning. Watch it vanish in the presence of Jehovah. in the presence of Jehovah God Almighty. Praise our peace. Bring peace, dear Lord. Trouble. Oh yes they do. Hearts are mened in the preious [Music] of the king. [Music] How wonderful. I'm excited. Hallelujah. You heard the announcement that there's no Wednesday service. It'll be on Friday. That is a special service that we're going to be doing a video and brother John Stall will be uh he will be speaking of his testimony and uh other things. It's going to be a I think a very wonderful evening. But tonight after the service here, after the service, immediately following the service, we'd like all the people that are formerly from the colonies, if you would meet, please in the chapel, and brother Jeremy Waldner is going to uh assist. We want to have a song. It's a well-known song to all of you from the colonies. And we want to have you go over the song a time or two because it's going to be an important part also of the video. So that's immediately following the service tonight. Uh I had a good question brother Jeremy raised and that is what about people like me? He said you know my parents came from the colony but I was born afterward. I said, "Oh, yes, definitely." That is even a more powerful testimony because a lot of people that have been remained on the colonies, they realize that what they have is not the answer. But they see those that have become disenchanted and have left and saw their children and their youth go the way of the world and go into sin. and they've said, "Well, we we don't really want what we don't have faith in what we have, and we certainly don't have faith in what has happened to those that have left." We have a testimony here that we've not conveyed sufficiently to the people. And I want you that are going to participate to recognize that this will be a grand opportunity to and it won't go just for a week. It will go for whatever time God gives us in the future as a testimony and a testament to this message of what it can do and what it has done and what it is doing. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's going to be powerful. So, right after the service this evening. All right. Thank you for remaining standing and that's all we'll have in the way of song. I'll have you turn in your Bibles please to Matthew the 11th chapter and we're going to read verses 25- 27 and then I will be reading from Luke the 10th chapter which is a essentially the same account starting at verse 22. Just before we read, I'd like to have prayer with you. Let's pray together. Dear Father, this morning we are in awe at what you've done. We feel so humbled and small and insignificant when we think that the God that created all things, the God who came and met and made promise to Abraham and the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob and of Moses and the prophets would come and be here with us today. I pray that you'll manifest yourself. You're the God of the messengers, the God of the apostles, the God of the prophet, messenger of this generation. You stood at the platform, Lord. You stood at the platform before tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of people. And here we are as a congregation and the invisible congregation on the internet. Move into this sanctuary. I pray with an intensified presence. Move into our very being by the Holy Spirit. Remove every obstacle and doubt of unbelief, oh God. Remove every hindrance. Heal the hearts and souls and minds of the people, oh God. And I pray that Satan will lie defeated. I pray, Father, that the saints of God will be able to place their foot upon his neck and know that he lies defeated before them. For we have a God that has never lost a battle. Father, today reveal your word and make it known to us, I pray. And may Lord, while it may be my voice of this human body, but may it be the very very thoughts of God that are being expressed, bring it to the people, I pray, anoint by the Holy Spirit to speak and to also hear in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew 11 and 25. At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. I'd like you to notice that last line. And he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. In Luke 10 verse 22, all things are delivered to me of my father. And no man knoweth the son, who the son is, but the father, and who the father is, but the son, and he to whom the son will reveal him. And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see. For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear the things which you hear and have not heard them. &gt;&gt; Amen. The apostle Paul said in Ephesians which we know so well 4 and30 and grieve not the spirit of God the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of your redemption. God bless you as you have your seats. I'd like to draw your attention to a subject this morning and you'll need your full attention and focus on the word. I want to speak on security in silence. This is a age of mass media and the passing and transfer of words is happening just in a way that the world has never known by way of telephone and by way of radio and by way of texting and by way of uh the internet and by way of television and on and on and on and And the transmission of news is instantaneous from around the globe in just seconds. It is from the time it's happened to the time you've heard it is just a instant away which we can say in one way it's that's really remarkable and my it has made uh it has made business so much more effective and we can be so much more efficient and there's a lot of things we can probably say very good about it on the other hand I think it tends to enslave people also it is made us slaves to our telephones and slaves to our gadgets. And finally, the gadgets begin to dictate what we do and with our time and so on and so forth. And so we can find that there's good and evil always in the tree of knowledge, right? &gt;&gt; Is it not so? &gt;&gt; But there is something that's sublime about silence. And there's time when silence is not merely necessary, but there's time when silence actually is a protection. And I'm going to go through the scriptures and hopefully show you that God has used silence very effectively. In fact is I would say that silence has been God's secret weapon. He's been silent. He's kept things. When things have been veiled, that's exactly what it is. When it's veiled, people, they don't know what it is. And he can even unveil it and it can be exposed into full view, but the people still don't know what it is. And so the secret weapon is revelation. And that word has been so misunderstood, so misused and abused. And they've tagged revelation onto all kinds of things. Somebody has some wonky idea. They say, "Oh, it's a revelation." Oh, well, it's not one I want. Oh, you can't quite see it. You can't quite understand. Well, you need a revelation. That may be true. But that man is only I think a lot of people, a lot of religious movements, a lot of men who have ideas, a lot of preachers, they've used the word and actually borrowed it. But it's God's word. It's a it's a word that God has reserved to himself. And I want to make a lot of statements on revelation today. And you may be asking yourself, and don't ask yourself a lot of questions before the service is over because people may say, "Well, how can I have it? How can I get it really? What is it?" And those are some of the questions the Lord willing I want to try to answer. security when I read the last scripture, grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you're sealed unto the day of your redemption. And brother Brandham deals a great deal with the seal because he was the instrument that God would use to speak the opening of the seven seals. And we might say, well, some might say right away, well, the seventh seal wasn't open. and he said it wasn't open, but he read the scripture which we'll read later on and I don't want to get into it now because I'm way ahead on on on where I'm wanting to go. But uh the seventh seal is and the seventh seal was opened. It says and there was silence in heaven silence in heaven for about the space for the spa for about the space of half an hour. Well, that is just so mysterious. But brother Brandham did say and and to me it opened the seal said it's the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; and that's why it was silent. And that word silence is only used twice in the entire New Testament. Once when apostle Paul was brought before that whole raging crowd and the Bible says and and and the people were stilled or brought to made quiet be quiet and there was a great silence. That was one time it was used. And the second time it's used is in in Revelation 8 and1 and there was a and the seventh seal was opened and there was silence and Jesus when he spoke of his coming he said no man would know &gt;&gt; not the angels &gt;&gt; and not even the son but God himself. God has used silence as a great great tool and I'll say a great weapon and the only the only thing that we the only tool that is used is the channel of revelation and that is why brother Brandham has said that revelation is more important to you than you will ever realize I'm talking about a revelation from God. In the unveiling of God, now we're talking about security. In the unveiling of God, he said God is a spirit and Jesus is the body that he was veiled in. &gt;&gt; I want you to get the connection between the veiling. When God veiled something, it was hidden. When God veiled something, it was I it's associated with silence because there was nothing to discuss. There was nothing to talk about. There was nothing to be discovered because it was veiled. When it's uncovered, then a person may say, "Oh, oh, isn't that marvelous? Oh, isn't that wonderful? Oh, isn't that a great piece of architecture? Isn't that a isn't that a great model of a automobile that's been designed?" because now it's been uncovered. But even though it's been uncovered, it doesn't mean that a person really understands or has an understanding about what has been uncovered. The Lord Jesus Christ has actually been unveiled in this generation. But how many actually understand it? That's where revelation has to come in. And the revelation is sovereign. The revelation is held at something that's divinely kept by God. And he gives it. He gives it as he sees fit to those who he chooses. And that revelation really is where the entire body of people where where the dividing line comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was veiled in his prophets. The reason he was veiled in his prophets was because they spoke God's word. And he said they were the flesh that God was veiled in. Can you imagine? And then Jesus came who was God Emmanuel, God in flesh, the fullness of the Godhead bodily in flesh. And he tells them, "You killed all the prophets. You slew your father slew them. You're the children of them that slew the prophets." They didn't want to hear that because they had shined the prophets all up and made them to be nice, good people. God veiled in Jesus to do the work of redemption. Brother Brandham says veiled in Jesus to do the work work of redemption at the cross. And then in in the unveiling of God also just this next statement. Now he said, "Now it isn't a written word to us. It's a reality. It's not just a written word. How many people hold the Bible today? It's not just a written word to us. It's a reality. We are in him and now we're enjoying him. Now we behold him. Now we see him. The word manifesting himself. It's hid out there because why? It's veiled in human flesh. That's why it's hid. It's veiled in human flesh. But even though even though the people could hear the word of God, listen, when Jesus Christ was on Calvary, the prophet said that the the mercy seat was exposed to full view. &gt;&gt; There isn't a record of anyone in this book that saw that. There isn't a record of one single person saying, "I got a revelation. The mercy seat is hanging on full view at Calvary, even though it was exposed." He said exposed to the eye and the vision of the people and the vessel that was there. Jesus Christ himself in the mercy seat was exposed to full view. But no one, not one, had a revelation that the mercy seat was hanging there in full view. It gets squeaky. It gets squeaky. But I need to make it very very uh pronounced if security. Now perhaps you're not getting the connection between the silence and the security. When I just spoke of Jesus and the mercy seat was in full view, only only by a revelation could a person ever come to the knowledge that that was the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Brother Bren talks about a mark on a person. We're still talking about a seal. A mark on a person or a thing. A mark is a is also a security. So I I just go back. Jesus is on Calvary and the mercy seat's in full view, but it has not been revealed. So what is it? He sealed it. It's still sealed. And the seal is a security. He's protecting it. I'll give you I'll give you just a a statement that the prophet made and then it'll it'll I want that to kind of over uh be an overriding thought throughout the service. He said concerning the seventh seal, he said Jesus said nothing about it. He came right up through the six in Matthew 24 and then when it came to the seventh, he just went on to parables. He said nothing about it. He said God kept it God kept it a secret. For if it had gotten out, the devil could have done a lot of damage with it. &gt;&gt; So God was protecting the truth. God protects his truth until the person or the individuals who are ordained to see it arrive on the scene and then God reveals it to them divinely by a personal revelation. Now a revelation cannot be taught to you. &gt;&gt; A revelation cannot be reasoned out to you. A revelation is not the result of someone winning an argument. &gt;&gt; And once a person has a revelation, it can never be taken away from them. &gt;&gt; Once a person has it revealed to them, I will say they can never fall away from it. Oh, they might get discouraged and a person may even, you know, become cool or become indifferent or drift away from it. But they will always can never shake the reality what God revealed to them. You'll never get away from it. No matter even if you wandered and drifted and and disobeyed God and whatever more, but you'll never get away from a revelation when it comes. It it can be the simplest thing. And on my knees today, I said in simplicity, God, I need a revelation, too. I need more revelation. But one thing is certain. I know that was you speaking through that messenger. That was you revealing the secrets of the heart. That was none other than God Almighty, creator of heavens and earth that came on the scene in this generation. And if I can't say anything else in life, if I can't make any other declaration, I want to be able to say I'm identified with that. &gt;&gt; I may not know a lot of things. I may not be able to make a lot of great statements, but I would like to be able to declare today before this audience, I believe that was God himself &gt;&gt; veiled in flesh &gt;&gt; making himself known to the people. And I don't want to be misunderstood, but I want you to hear very clearly that God did something in this generation he has not done in any age, even since the since the Bible times. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that with me? Apostle Paul has said, "Now to him that is of power to establish to establish you according according to my gospel and the preaching and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery." I'll come to that in a few minutes. Which was kept secret since the world began. kept secret since the world began. And then he says that it is made known by the preaching of the gospel that came through him. He knew and he was not apologetic about it. It has been kept secret. What did God do? He protected it. He veiled it. He sealed it. All of those words are related to the subject. It can only come. All right? He sealed it. He He hid it. He kept it secret. So what's the answer to this? Only by revelation of that mystery. And they can call it a mystery, but God only by revelation of this mystery. And when it's revealed, the mystery of the scripture, the mystery of the event, when it's revealed to the individual, that is the process. And the word mystery in the Greek actually means those that are initiated into a special group. It is that revealing of that revelation by revelation of the mystery that God has held secret that is the process of initiation. all kinds of groups maybe the lodges and and the universities and colleges and whatever more they have some uh initiation rights you know you have to go through a process of initiation and then you're in the club then you're in the group then you're one of us by the initiation if you don't go through that initiation some have even lost their lives in init going through some kind of initiation process and they and there's been inquiries into Well, this is initiation. Initiation into the bride of Jesus Christ is by God revealing the mystery of his word to you. And once that's revealed, you can never shake that. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; A seal, you become sealed by the Holy Spirit. And a seal is security. A seal also signifies ownership. God owns you. When you are sealed, you're not your own any longer. You belong. God puts a seal upon you. He re by revelation. He reveals that his word is the truth. By revelation, he reveals that the message is the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, you could have shaken brother Brandham's hand. A lot of people did. You could have sat down and had dinner with him. But someday, if God so wills, then you have a revelation. This is a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; This is Malachi 4. This is this is the Elohim that met Abraham &gt;&gt; is here again today in a different form in a different veil of flesh but to do the same thing and he behind his back he called a woman and now he turns his back as he did here in Los Angeles turn his back went right back to that scripture made that very scripture work game. &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe it was that God, then you do it &gt;&gt; or you find someone to do it. &gt;&gt; And that's where the rubber hits the road. &gt;&gt; And that's why the preachers were so silent. Didn't want to agree with what he said. But then he would say, "Now I will call on the God that I have spoken of to come here now and prove what I said is the truth." &gt;&gt; And when the proof came, oh, they were so excited about the truth. &gt;&gt; They said, "Now it said, believe the doctrine." &gt;&gt; Oh, well, you know, it's not what our school taught. Who cares what the school teaches? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Who cares what the theology is? Who cares what the denomination is? I mean, that's the time I'd let all that stuff flee. &gt;&gt; I'd leave it right away. Oh, that wasn't what I was taught when I was in Sunday school or I was in church or that's not what I was taught, you know, 40 years ago. Who cares what you were taught 40 years ago? &gt;&gt; We want something that works &gt;&gt; and works now. &gt;&gt; I want something that holds you young people and young men. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to &gt;&gt; lay it on the line today. &gt;&gt; If you haven't got revelation, Brother Brandon says that's something you ought to seek. &gt;&gt; And I heard Brother Murphy speak on Wednesday evening. If you weren't here, I will tell you, get the get the tape or get the uh stream it on the archives and hear it. Everybody in this congregation needs to hear Murphy's service from uh on on Wednesday evening. And he spoke on surrender, spoke on yielding and spoke on the humility that comes when a person surrenders. You don't bring anything. You come just as you are. You have nothing to offer, no thought. &gt;&gt; You have no idea. You just surrender. And when you need revelation from God, if you're here this morning, and I'm sure you are, I'm sure I speak to the most of the congregation and you desire, some perhaps have never had a revelation of this message and you need it. You ought to seek that more than you seek a job. You should seek that more than you seek any material thing. You ought to seek that more than you seek anything else in life. ought to say, "God, give me a revelation of yourself. &gt;&gt; Give me revelation of who this messenger was. &gt;&gt; I need that revelation." You ought to seek that with everything that's in you. &gt;&gt; And that'll be your security. &gt;&gt; We think of security today. And we have all kinds of systems. A lot of you folks got you got alarms for your vehicles. Why? Because you don't want it stolen. You got alarm for your home. We think of security devices to protect the things that we consider of value. We also think of protecting our families. We want to give them good food and protect their well-being. mothers and fathers. Anyone who is a real mother and father, that's they feel that way about their families. And it's becoming an increasing concern today, mothers and fathers both taking their children long ways to school and picking them up. And many schools, I think most put responsibility on the teachers to see that those children are handed over to their parents or the one who's assigned to pick them up because there's such concern. Isn't it terrible? &gt;&gt; Isn't that a shame? modern age that we're in supposed to be intelligent age and we've come to the place we got to watch our children moment by moment against some pedophile or some animal and I think they are demon-possessed animals out after innocent children and it's not one here and one there it's become the societyy's become infested with that &gt;&gt; I tell you it shocked me, rocked me to my shoes to hear that uh a whole network of these kind of people not even worthy to be spoken of over this pulpit in 77 nations including this country of Canada tied together and over 2500 people in a massive of network in child pornography. I say you forgive me. I don't think those per people are worthy of life. &gt;&gt; And God thinks so too cuz he's going to destroy them. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, and we cannot become lax and say, "Well, you know, it's something that happens. I'm not going to be on this very long, but I'm just going to say it's a terrible thing that we have to protect our children to such. You know, in my one short lifetime, I spent about half of my life never locked my door of my home. Never locked the car. Didn't even think of it. Wouldn't even think of locking your car. I do it today. I do it here at the office. It's just a part of life. You lock it up. turn the alarm on all the rest of say, "Well, don't you trust God?" I sure do, but I don't trust a lot of people. &gt;&gt; Is it all right if I'm honest? &gt;&gt; We're familiar with such terms as top secret and confidential and passwords and ID protection. say, "Well, you're spending a lot of time on this." Yes. And this I won't finish this message this morning. I'm just going to go as far as I can go. We're very conscious of those things, but I have a heavenly father and he also has been very conscious of it. He's saying, "This is too precious. I'm not going to let these people trample this underfoot. This is too precious. This is too pure. This is too holy. I have separated. I have I have identified these truths and these are two. Yeah, they can take the Bible and they can produce them by the millions and it can be the it can be the most popular book on the face of the earth, but there's truths in there and I'm going to reserve it to a group that I will call the elect lady. And I will not expose it to the general public. And how I'm going to protect it, I'm going to have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. And I will send that spirit and it will it will enlighten. It will ignite. Let me explain revelation to you in a very elementary way. Someone leads you by the hand into this auditorium and it's totally dark. There's no light. It's dark outside and it's as dark as a cave inside. I was in a cave once in the Oregon caves with my family and uh we were way down into the you know the caverns of the earth and our guide I was standing right beside him and he said there's a room here where we all look the same everybody will look the same when we get to this room that my this is going to be something so We got down into this place and well it was much higher than this ceiling here then and it was enormous place and we were on a little path and he was right there at the switch and he just flicked the switch and it was black as the inside of a cow if you've ever heard that term. It was you could feel it and he says see we all look the same. I thought that is right. He turned it back on. So you could come into here and it would be that dark. And I would say now just up here is a four steps and there's a platform and it's kind of a plum covered carpet on there. So you're trying to We have a black ebony piano. It's a grand piano and there's some microphones and we have a a beautiful pulpit that was made by one of our brothers. It's made out of an oak wood and it's a kind of a medium brown finish and I could try to describe everything and in the you you're you're straining everything and you're picturing it as I speak it. And after I've described most of the room, the light goes on. Oh, you say, you know, you were really accurately describing it, but I couldn't really get the full impact of it till the lights go on. &gt;&gt; And that is what a preacher can preach it. &gt;&gt; And you can hear it on a tape. &gt;&gt; You can read it in a book, but the light has to go on. And that's when the Holy Spirit of God comes down through the system into the soul and turns the lights on. And once you've seen it, it's an experience you have. And no one can ever say to you, "Ah, there's no there's no grand piano in the pulpit." Say, "I saw it. I was there myself. I saw it." Don't tell me there wasn't there. Don't tell me there's no pulpit there. I saw the pulpit. I handled it. I put my hands on it. That's what a revelation is. They can tell you all about a messenger. Tell you all about what he did. Tell you all about the miracles. Tell you all about Go to Malachi 4. Go back to Genesis the 18th chapter. Go over into Hebrews. Go into Revelation 10. You can hear 10:17. Uh Revelation the 3rd chapter verse 14. Messenger to the Leodysian church. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I understand it. Yeah. I understand it. Then one day the light goes on. Oh my. I say it for myself. &gt;&gt; No one can ever argue you out of that. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't had that, that's more important to you. You cannot have it reasoned into you. You cannot have it. And let me say to you young people, you don't get it by natural birth. &gt;&gt; Well, my mom and dad have it. I was born into a home. I've been in this church all my life. Brother Ed, you dedicated me. You held me as a baby. Wonderful. But that doesn't do it. &gt;&gt; You need to desire it and realize it's more important because this is the deciding factor. &gt;&gt; This is this is God's secret weapon of protection. He protects it. &gt;&gt; And that's why we preach it. You say, "Well, we it it doesn't come by teaching." No, that is exactly right. But on the other hand, once it's revealed to you, it does involve teaching. It does involve preaching. And that's why we are preaching to keep reminding the people because Satan is a liar &gt;&gt; and the author of all lies. And we know that he will keep coming back to say, "Oh, that isn't it. Ah, you didn't get it. Oh, you're not a believer. You're not a Christian. Look what you did. Look what you did." And we come back and say, "But the blood of Jesus Christ is more powerful than any failing, any error." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Any sin, if anyone has sinned, you confess it and it drops into the bleach of Jesus Christ, the blood of Jesus Christ, and you're pure from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus moving up towards Calvary. I help try to help yourself to absorb this. Here's now God in the fullness in a man called Jesus Christ. The whole world lies in darkness. The whole world is lost. And there's only one way it can be redeemed. And that is if he, the lamb of God, should follow a certain process and be slain in Calvary and hang on a cross. And he must be beaten. He must be bruised. He must wear a crown of thorns. He must go through this process. And the prophet said, "The greatest week in all the history of man." And that greatest week now is just moving. It's just started into process. And you know what this lamb of God did? You know what this one did? Held his peace and didn't say. He wouldn't expose what was happening. He wouldn't let it out. &gt;&gt; He kept the secret &gt;&gt; and they said, "Art thou the Christ?" And he held his peace. &gt;&gt; He kept silent. And God protected the greatest weak in the history of mankind by saying nothing about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know we all fit into this place. Something happens, something takes place, and the first thing we do, we're on the telephone. You're doing the worst thing you can do. &gt;&gt; I got to tell somebody, &gt;&gt; or are they going to fix it? Are they going to make it better? I got to spread this around the country. I got to send out an email and send it to all the people of everything that's happened. You ought to just keep it to yourself. Keep it a secret and let God work on it. A lot of times, a lot of times I've had people come and and I think that they should come to me. They say, "Brother Ed, this is what has happened. This is what has taken place. I need you to pray with me." I said, "I will." You know, we'll do that. And sometime, even almost before you've prayed for it, it's already been fixed. But if you let that all out to all kinds of other people, it just goes on and on and on. And those people don't know it's been repented over. It's been fixed. The Lord has forgotten it. But all kinds of people out there haven't forgotten it because they're just busy jabbering about it. &gt;&gt; Say amen if you want to &gt;&gt; and say ouch if you need to. Jesus moving up to this greatest week and he says nothing about it. He said it's the greatest week in history. the greatest celebration of all times. He was moving to the cross. He was moving to the sacrifice, the blood that would cover the sins and remove the sins of mankind. And he would pay the price for the whole the whole world and purchase back creation. But he wouldn't say a thing about it. And the disciples who had walked with him and participated in his ministry didn't know they were they were uh absolutely uh unaware of what was happening. &gt;&gt; They didn't know it. And the high priest arose and said unto him, "Answerest thou nothing? What is it which these witness against you? But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the son of God. And Jesus wouldn't let the secret out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Kept it secret. Apostle Paul said, "For I neither received it." He's speaking this revelation. I never received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. And now I come to a scripture which we can all quote, I'm sure, just out of our memory, off the top of our head of Luke 17:30. Even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed. Oh, but here's the key word. Here's the secret weapon. When the son of man is not when he's born, not son of man, when he's revealed, &gt;&gt; he can come into full view as Jesus was on Calvary. the the mercy seat could come in full view, but they still don't re it's still not a revelation. And in the day when he will be revealed in the day when he will be uncovered and you can take and uncover uh uncover something because that's what revelation means in the scripture. It's uncovered. But even when it's uncovered, as it was with Jesus Christ when he was here, even though it's uncovered, it takes a revelation from God to know what it is that has been uncovered. &gt;&gt; Do you know that to know that these times are the end times? That's not unique to you or I or in the message to this church. All kinds of churches throughout the whole country, they recognize this the end time. They see the signs. They recognize. How do they recognize it? Because they read the same Bible you and I read. They know it's the end time. But why is it I want to ask you something. Why is it that such critical scriptures are somehow they're passed over and such important even uh just a a paragraph is is is doesn't come to light. I just wonder about that. scholars and people that are so knowledgeable. How is it that it's passed over in the day when the Son of Man is revealed? Has it been revealed to you? &gt;&gt; I'm going to lay it on you. If it's been revealed, you will live the kind of life that that messenger brought. &gt;&gt; You'll live that kind of life. You won't be here today and gone tomorrow. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You won't be in euphoric state one day and then, well, it's not so real and you're gone. I'm talking about revelation doesn't leave a person. &gt;&gt; Re nobody can argue you out of a revelation. &gt;&gt; Never. Because you experienced it. Even if it cost your own life, you could not surrender up a revelation. &gt;&gt; Because the lights went on. &gt;&gt; I saw it. &gt;&gt; I see it in the word of God. I see it. It's as clear. It's as clear as crystal. and I can never deny it because it's there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you &gt;&gt; for your amen. &gt;&gt; Now I just want to make some statements that I really felt inspired to write. Revelation is God's system of protection. The very thing that makes revelation to us as believers to make it so important, so vital is because it's God's only channel, only channel, only channel to reveal truth. He does not have a other channel. He reveals truth by revelation by which God makes known the mysteries of his word. And now here's the quote I said I would give you. The importance of revelation. Now before I give this quote, you answer this for yourself, please. You have a revelation of who this messenger is. You do. Can I hear the affirmative? &gt;&gt; I have a revelation of who the messenger is. Amen. Now, I'd like if you could just in your imagination for a moment, in your vision, remove me off the scene and just bring Brother Brandham here in your thoughts and have him saying to you, dear ones, to the elect of Christ, looking down into your face, saying the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized. Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize. Revelation means more to you. In other words, it's more important that the switch goes on. It's more important that the lights are turned on. It's more important that you become quickened inside. It's more important that you have this complete illumination, this realization that these things are true. This is the message. This is the messenger. This is what God has sent to pro. This is what divides. This is the dividing line between the elect and non-elect. between we'll say the initiated. &gt;&gt; This is the initiation process. God when he when he turns the light on that is the initiation. You're in the group. You're in the elect. You're in the club. You're in the society. You're in the You're in the bride. I'll put it that way. &gt;&gt; You need to see that. &gt;&gt; You need to see that. It's not coming to this church. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not Cloverdale Bible Way. That's not the initiation. &gt;&gt; It's not even being baptized. All kinds of people been in the tank and gone down in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they're gone. &gt;&gt; But if you have a revelation, someone might say, "That's exactly right. That's exactly what the word of God says. I'm going to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Wonderful. And a little while later, you know, I don't know what happens in their lives, but they're gone. They give it all up. They turn against it. Do they have a revelation? Not by my not by my books. Never had a revelation. And if it means more to you and it can be so simple, it's not some big long process. But the light has to go on &gt;&gt; in your own self. &gt;&gt; And friends, when that light goes on, let me tell you, a lot of your troubles will vanish. &gt;&gt; A lot of your troubles will vanish. &gt;&gt; You'll be able to say, I don't care who you are. I don't care what what age you are. I don't care what status in life you're at but you'll be able to say when you when you are facing something or you're facing a decision whatever it might be and there isn't anybody here but what you face decisions on a regular basis from day to day you need a guide you need a protection and God has given you this protection to protect of all things friends I talked about home I talked about family I talked about health talked about car talked about all of these things talked about information and your ID and all this protection all the security. What God is really interested in is protecting your spiritual life, &gt;&gt; your spiritual walk, &gt;&gt; and what did he give to protect that? The word. &gt;&gt; The word. And we hear the word, the word, the word. But it's not just the word. It's the revealed word. &gt;&gt; It's got to reveal it to you on a personal level in your situation. As I said earlier, you're not born into it. You're not born into revelation by natural birth. It does not come by reasoning or by argument. You cannot receive a revelation by teaching. Although revelation needs to be taught once it's revealed to you once it's revealed to you. You do need you need do need to have teaching because the scripture says speaking the truth in love may grow up into him grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ. That's after a person's had a revelation from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body into the edifying of itself in love. And Paul said further in Colossians 2 and 7, rooted and built up and established in the faith as you have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving. They they they have that foundation which is the revelation of what the word of God actually is. Perhaps I can emphasize the importance of it. I knew that this would be something that you'd have to ponder and I'm going to overwork this word of revelation. I'm going to overwork it because it has been overworked and it's been misunderstood and it needs to be understood. You need to really know what it is. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. It's amazing. We have here this one book. And here's here here here's the Old Testament from Genesis to Malachi. And we have the Jews that hold to that. And the Jews for all these hundreds of years, centuries, have not yet, they read the same scriptures you read, but have not yet found that this word is speaking of Jesus Christ. And why? The Bible says, the Apostle Paul said, "God hath blinded their eyes." and people trying to see, oh, we're going to convert this Jew and get them. If God has blinded their eyes, you can't say if I say to someone blind and bring a blind man up here, you see this beautiful flower? It's yellow and it's brown in the interior and it's just magnificent and there's a lily beside it. Can't you understand that? No, I can't understand it because I can't see it. &gt;&gt; Well, it it is the shades of it in it is so marvelous. and just tantalizes my whole mind, my whole being. It's so magnificent. Says, "Sorry, just can't see it. Just can't see it." But the eyes were opened. &gt;&gt; He'd say, "I see just what you see. I see it is indeed yellow. It is indeed beautiful. And it is indeed magnificent." Do you catch my point? Yes. &gt;&gt; This one book and all that has happened and all the revelation of Jesus Christ and the and the incredible manifestation. The Jews don't see him. &gt;&gt; They don't see that Christ was the Messiah. Oh, I say, "Well, those blind Jews." Oh, just a second. Here we got the New Testament. And somehow we Gentiles have have been have have managed to make over over 3,000 denominations out of the New Testament. I ask you out of any serious thinking person, how did they manage to do that? &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why. It's not been Christ of this Bible has not been a revelation to them. &gt;&gt; If the lights go on, are you going to say that's a red flower? That's a green flower. No, I say it's a yellow flower. Okay, you go and have your own church. It's a red flower. You have your own church. It's a green flower. I'll have my church. It's a yellow flower. And I identified with a yellow because that's the truth. And I believe we have it. [Applause] And 3,000 people look at the same book and find a different color. &gt;&gt; It's this way. No, it's this way. Well, you go and have yours. I'll go and have mine. It's take take one little weed scripture. You know, Friday night, we're going to have something regarding the colonies and people who have come off the colonies. And I just want to say to you that have come from the colonies and God has delivered you from that. That entire organization is based on just a very very few uh uh very fall small segments out of the Bible. And they have that all things in common. All things in common. We have all things in common. That's one of the main pillar doctrines. We have all things in common. What a fallacy. What a falsehood. &gt;&gt; The only people that have it are the leaders. &gt;&gt; You have all things in common, but the people walk out with just the shirts on their back. We have all things in common, but they work there for next to nothing. And you've been delivered out of such a thing. I think praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do they get that just out of out of the New Testament? I can tell you one thing, and if you're ever talking to your relatives or whoever back there, yeah, I'll tell you one thing. The apostles never went out and bought a farm. &gt;&gt; The apostles never went out and had 10,000 pigs &gt;&gt; or 30,000 turkeys. Everybody from the colony should be saying, "Amen." That's not in the book of Acts. They never did do it. It's a falsehood. &gt;&gt; It appeased to certain people. &gt;&gt; Better get off that, I guess. Here's what a revelation is. Going to conclude in a few more minutes. In the message, works as faith expressed. These next two quotes, you became a sinner by nature. You didn't want to be, but you heard the gospel and faith cometh by hearing. This important statement now and revelation comes by hearing because he went on to say faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; You know, I've had I've experienced a few things in my life. I wish there were a lot more when God dropped it down. And when it dropped it down, it's it's all it's it's all over. It's already finished. When God speaks something, Brother Brandham says concerning the visions, he said, "Now, if he had a vision that God was going to raise George Washington, he said he called the world to come and see it." When you have a revelation, it's already finished. It's already done. It's as though it was yesterday. It's already finished. I see it. It's already done. &gt;&gt; Nobody can ever It's not even something that's up for debate. &gt;&gt; It's already done. It's already finished. &gt;&gt; Just for personal testimony, when I'd slipped and herniated the disc in my neck and against the spinal cord, it's over 11 years ago now. And I can take you to the very spot in my house, and I was in such excruciating pain. And the pain was overcoming me, and I began to break down just a wee bit. And I just said, "Lord, if thou wilt, thou can make me whole." And that was all I prepared to say. That's all that was coming out of my mouth. And I can't tell you what it was. It wasn't some super duper flash or thunder or lightning. It just something issued out from me. And I said, "I will be thou whole." And I knew it was over. I came and stood behind this pulpit in the same amount of pain and said to you people God told me I will be thou whole. &gt;&gt; And I said not better &gt;&gt; whole not improved whole. I stand here today as a testimony of those of that thing of what God did. That is a revelation. &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. And if you'd have saw me, I had my arm up over my head schedule. I even went in to see Dr. Richard Chan, who's had over 800 spinal operations, one of the finest specialists in in Royal Colombian Hospital. And I went into his place and said, "I'm here for the operation." And he told me, "There is no way for it to recover by itself. you're you have to have this emergency operation. And I asked him just give me a time to pray about it. I came right here, called Brother Lance, Brother Tony, Brother Tom. I said, when I have a serious case, I tell people, follow the scripture to the letter &gt;&gt; cuz I have a revelation that this is the absolute truth and there is no other way. It's not what I think about it, it's what it says. &gt;&gt; And God will stand behind it. &gt;&gt; And if he remains silent, that's his that's his privilege. When I have people here, some of you have been here with serious cases, life-threatening cases, and I read James 5. If you're afflicted, any man afflicted, let him pray. &gt;&gt; Not let the preacher pray, the pastor pray, the deacons pray, let him pray. &gt;&gt; Is any sick? Let him call for the elders. let him call, not the preacher to run over and say, "I heard you're sick. I'm here to pray for you." &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, you prayed. Nothing happened." Well, of course, it didn't follow the word. Had all kinds of people are sick. Said, "Well, I've been sick. Nobody even prayed for me." But did you call? &gt;&gt; It's back on you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Any afflicted? And then the second thing I say is I always take the message, be certain of God. And I tell the people, read that because brother Brandham says, "How many times in my life I've turned over every stone &gt;&gt; and I've turned over every stone." If he still remains silent, he's still God. &gt;&gt; Friends, you have to come to that place. &gt;&gt; You can't be somebody who whimpers along. Well, I prayed and God didn't answer me and I prayed and I want this and I want that and he didn't answer me. Get over that. That's immature childhood. God wants men and women be able to take the word of God and put the gloves on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said to those brothers are here. I said, I'm not here to have you pray for me. I'm here to have you pray with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I said the scripture says when I have people here I tell them the scripture says is any man afflicted let him pray I have come to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ask you brothers to pray with me. &gt;&gt; And the second thing I tell people is read and carry be certain of God. And I've been carrying that with me. I've been absorbing that message and doing what I tell others to do. We knelt and prayed. Did anything happen? Not a thing. Not a thing. I walked out of here exactly the same. But I knew God had already spoken to me and said, "I will be thou whole." I had already said it here over the pull pit. I will be thou whole. waited two weeks, nothing happened. My wife says, "I can't see you suffer like this. You've I lost 10 lbs in two weeks." I went right back to Dr. Richard Chan sat in his chair with my wife beside me and I said, "I'm here for the operation." The man who told me there was no other way out looked at me and said, "But how are you?" I said, "Well, I've lost 10 pounds in two weeks. if that means anything. But he said, "But how are you?" I said, "I'm the same." I said, "I've come here. Let's let's let's get it over with, Dr. Chan." But he said, "Well, but maybe I should check you over." I said, "All right." Go into the next room, pricks me, does a number of things, puts me through some tests, comes back and says, he says, "Well, you're not any you're not any worse." I said, "No, but I'm not any better." And I was pushing him. The very man that says there's no other way for it to happen. I said, "Let's do it. Dr. Chan, I've come here for the operation." And he refused to do it. After three times, refused to do it. He says, "I think that you should wait." I said, "Good." It was seven weeks. It was all over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the same God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, that was 11 12 years ago." Do you know that Brother Bram talks about miracles that took place 20 and 30 years ago? And he talks about them as though they happened just yesterday. Hey, there's no time with God. What's 12 years? It's nothing. It's the same as it happened last night. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the same God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; How did it happen? Well, faith's a revelation. I can have faith because he revealed it was done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you saved? &gt;&gt; You know you're saved. &gt;&gt; You know it's finished. You know it's over. Is it a revelation that you're saved? You know you're saved. Is the Godhead a revelation to you? Is baptism a revelation to you? Is this message a revelation to you? I'm asking you, is it a revelation to you? Then nothing can take it out of your being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I just related my own. There's been quite a number even here in this congregation. And God will just speak something and it's the same as it it's same as it happened yesterday. Same. It was already finished. It's already over. And when God drops that into your heart, it's done. It is done. I'm preaching this morning because well I want to say it but I want to say it in a kind of a kind way but sometimes it's no not a way to say it kind. I want to I want to convey this to you in such a way that Satan's ability to buffet you will be greatly restricted and reduced &gt;&gt; and that any thought of going to the right or going to the left or or the world being so attractive And the world can come in so many many forms. He's such a subtle enemy. &gt;&gt; But if God gives you a real revelation &gt;&gt; of what this message is all about, it will change your entire composure and your entire approach to it. &gt;&gt; Can I take about another five minutes and I'm going to close. This is what I didn't come to, but I'll just introduce it because I want to come to it. There's something that's you might say. Do you ever get perplexed, Brother Ed? Yeah, I do. I get perplexed. not about, you know, just the little things of life, but I get perplexed about big things, important things. I'm going to drop one on you that I get perplexed about. And and perplexed because I want to know. I want a revelation of it. And I can't settle back on my hunches and just settle back in my easy chair. And it remains there all the time. You say, "What is this great thing?" Well, one of them is. Brother Brandham says the rapture is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Oh God, don't let us miss this revelation. &gt;&gt; Don't let us miss this revelation. And quite frankly, I have great concern if we just, you know, go along on, you know, live stream and, you know, kind of take it as it goes and I go to church. I go to Cloverdale Bible Way. I listen to a tape now and then or we have a great service and then you know life becomes quite ordinary. church is quite ordinary everything and we're more involved in kind of the natural relationships between brothers and sisters and families and what I'm talking about goes so far beyond that they don't even belong on the same planet &gt;&gt; don't even belong on the same planet I'm talking about being caught away I'm talking about a sweep that's going to come. I'm talking about something this prophet one of his last services says uh faith faith is a revelation and the rapture is a revelation saying oh God reveal these things to me make make them known I can't say that the rapture to me is as though it happened yesterday but I believe it can be that real I believe that the revelation of the rapture and that is why brother Brandham says you know I I can take you to quotes that go both directions. Say the seventh seal is open. Say the seventh seal isn't open, but it's somewhere in the in the middle there. I saw it goes in a three-fold because it is a shout. It is a voice. It is a trumpet. It goes back in three-fold. He says uh it it passed by um I saw the first part of it and then the second part no he said yesterday then he changed it. He just changed it because he in in his conversation in the way he was bringing to the people he said and the second part and the third part passed by in an unknown tongue. He said I did see it. I did see it. And he was talking about the talking about the in the seventh seal. He's talking about the coming of Christ. You know, this thing, this thing of the coming of Christ and the rapture of Christ is just as mysterious as when he was here on earth and the disciples were trying to see it and trying to understand it and what is this all about and what is this great message he had and all this power and where's it gone and what's happened to the message and and the secretary of the church, he's he's gone and hung himself and he's betrayed our Lord and and uh and the and all the all the leaders and the trustees and the deacons or whatever more the apostles at that time, great apostles of God, They're all holed up in a in a room and the doors are locked and the windows are barred and and how many of you people want to join that church. &gt;&gt; So, well, look at this. You know, the whole thing looks like it's all falling apart and we're coming to the greatest week in history. &gt;&gt; But there was something &gt;&gt; in the soul of those men. I don't understand everything, but I know what he said is true. And I know what's going to happen, and I don't understand everything. I must go to Jerusalem, and the son of man must die. All of these things I have the son of man come in this generation, speak to a prophet's mouth, says a rapture is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Don't you people sit here? Don't you people come here to this church after this service and say, "Well, I I'm just going to take this on a nonchalant. I'm just going to take this in a kind of a an an average way. This is not an average message. It I'm not talking about this message. I'm talking about the message you received. It's not an average message. It is a rapture call. It is the very word. That word itself has the power to change your body. Amen. &gt;&gt; And transform you &gt;&gt; from this mortal to an immortal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's going to be as real as we're sitting here this morning. Some are going to be transformed. They're going to go into another dimension. &gt;&gt; I don't know how, but they're going to do it. And people are going to be on this side and people are going to be on the other side. &gt;&gt; People still going to be aging. people going to be in a youthful body and cannot be changed and cannot age. &gt;&gt; That's what his word says. The raptures of revelation &gt;&gt; and the seventh seal was open and there was great silence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this is where I'm perplexed. Say, Lord, I take it back whenever I get to a place. Is it all right that I'm so personal this morning? &gt;&gt; I take it back. I've counseledled with some of you and you have such dilemas and such involvements and such entanglements and life becomes so complex and and when I get something like that, I say to the people, man or woman, I say, "Well, do you believe you're a son of God?" "Yeah, I do." That's where I have to start. &gt;&gt; Do you actually believe you're a daughter of God? Do you believe you're a daughter of God? I do. I need that affirmative. And then if you can say that, then we have some grounds. Then we can proceed. But if you can't say that, then there's there is no place to begin. There's no starting place. Say, "Are you a son of God? Where's my Where's my Where's the bottom line with brother Ed? I hope this helpful to you. When life gets real difficult, it gets real complex and it will. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It will. I'd encourage you, in fact, as I would instruct you, you get alone. You get someplace where it's quiet. Look up. Say, "Father, so many things I don't understand. I desire. I want to know. I desire. And I believe I should know. But I will start by telling you I believe that this word that you sent was not of man. I believe it was you that was speaking. &gt;&gt; I believe it was you that was that pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; I believe it was you that was revealing the secrets of the heart. That was you all down through these stations of of of the of the message. That was you. That wasn't a man. That wasn't William Brandham. That was you. And that's where you really need to start. And when you start talking to him and when you start when you start thanking him for those things, you'll feel his presence move in. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to conclude conclude now with what Murphy said. Murphy said something very very very deep as he concluded his service something that I had never heard before. But he told how he was because he was speaking on yielding and that's what I want to end this service on. how he yielded himself to an evil spirit. And that evil spirit would actually begin to move a small dish around on a cardboard where he'd put a lot of words. And he's looking at the moon and giving himself completely completely. And here was the key. He said, "And as you just give yourself and give yourself, press yourself and surrender yourself to this whole spirit world." He said, "You could feel that evil spirit coming." I can tell you, I knew that was true. I've had that many times. even praying with people, even talking to people. And I will tell them in counseling, that thing is an evil spirit. It's a demon spirit. And when you start thinking on a certain thing, you start going in that direction and you can actually feel that spirit come. And you know what, friends? Very, very rarely do I have anyone say, "No, I can't feel it." Almost 100% people say, "I can feel it. I do feel it when it comes. And I said, that's when you have to resist it. That is a that is the presence of a demon spirit. Friends, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers. Do you believe that? We're not just here a lot of human individuals in in bodies of clay and flesh. This is a spiritual warfare that we're in. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I tell God, "Father, I believe that was you." And as I give myself to it, you know what happens? I begin to feel a different presence coming and it's his presence. And even here in this service, if you sense that, you start giving yourself to it. It's a holy presence. It's a pure presence. It's God's presence. It's the presence of Jehovah. It is the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the only way that brother Brandham could be effective is he just gave himself to it. And he gave himself and he talked to the people and talked to them because he was pouring himself into that direction. Pouring himself into this person's need and he didn't know whether they were in sin. They didn't know what it was. They didn't know what but he had confidence in his call. And he knew that God was going to speak and utter through him. and reveal what that individual's need was. And he'd give himself to it. And that's what made it work. &gt;&gt; That's what made it work. &gt;&gt; And I'm closing this service by saying, "And it'll work for you. &gt;&gt; It'll work for you." If I can convince you people to give yourself and surrender yourself to the Holy Spirit. Don't sit in a service and say, "Well, it's going to, you know, it's supposed to end in another few minutes and we need to get home and so on so forth." What you need to do after today or after this meeting is not nearly as important is what I'm saying to you. If that presence moves near you, if you feel that presence, if you feel that very being of Christ himself moving, what a great honor, what a great privilege this is. And here's a little vessel trying to tell you, give yourself to him. Give yourself to him. Just yield to him. &gt;&gt; Do you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know what I'm saying? And I said on Wednesday night, people have to learn how to yield. Say, "How do I do it?" That's how you do it. You feel his presence coming near you. Then you just focus all your heart and mind and soul and just keep moving and pressing in that direction. I'm giving myself. Brother Murphy said and he took the surrender of the Japanese in the Second World War. He said some powerful things. Said the emperor could not come with any conditions. the US general come on a battleship but the emperor of Japan come in a little boat to climb up onto the ship because there's humility involved. That's the next thing. If we come in humility, we come humble. &gt;&gt; Who cares what kind of a person we are or how we dress or what home we're from or how what our status in life is? We come with nothing. That's right. &gt;&gt; We're not strong, you know, people as such. &gt;&gt; Young people, young men got your strength and young ladies got your beauty. It's nothing that could be gone in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; So, we yield. &gt;&gt; We give ourselves and God begins to take over in our lives. You may not have some great surge of feeling or lightning or flashes of of anything, but God begins to move and move through you and make you the kind of vessel that he wants. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Friends, that how that's how it works. And I feel like I've been giving kind of a lesson this morning. But if a messenger says to me and to you revelation is more important to you than you can realize then I would just take that and I know that there's I happen to know God help us. I happen to know there's a lot of you, a lot of the young people, young men and young ladies. Your parents, you know, your parents have it and it hasn't happened to you quite like that yet. I'd use all your energy. Lose all, use all the alertness of your mind &gt;&gt; to give yourself in that one direction &gt;&gt; and say, "Brother Ed spoke to me this morning, and the Holy Spirit witnessed it down in my heart." And you may be here and you may be here because your friends are here or your wife or your husband or whatever more. I don't know why you may be here but that's why we don't put a great emphasis on on uh you know the school or the Sunday school or some program or the music or something else. Those are accessories. But the main thing is if we don't have revelation those things mean nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; A personal revelation. &gt;&gt; When a person has that, the word of God is so alive. When you sing, the singing is different. When you sing a special, the special is different. When you play an instrument, it is different. When you read the word, it is different. And the services are different. And the preaching comes to you different because God give you revelation. God grant it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father, giver of every good gift and the gift we're speaking of this morning, the Holy Spirit. Grant the Holy Spirit come to this waiting audience, attentive audience, respectful audience, listening, Lord, to your word. And I desire, Father, that they might be able to leave this sanctuary this morning, having such an impact, not of a man, not of a a message, not of the way it was spoken, not merely of the quotes, but would you take them, Lord? Would you would you just anchor them down in the heart and the soul of every individual? And Lord, I want to ask and I pray that you will convey it to them. Those that may not have had this experience, I'm going to soon ask them to stand. And Lord, when they do, I pray that you will drop down something very glorious, something marvelous. drop down into them the spirit of wisdom and of revelation according to Paul's gospel in Ephesians the first chapter drop it down I cannot give it no man can give it they can't give it to themselves but you can give it Lord &gt;&gt; let it be let it be something sovereign and divine &gt;&gt; you said through your messenger that the revelation is sovereign. It is sovereign. You give it to them that you would. I pray, Father, that this will be so. What I speak of, oh God, will certainly be a baptism of the Holy Spirit as you reveal yourself to the individuals. I like to know throughout this congregation while our heads are bowed [Music] who within their own within the honesty of their own heart. Brother Ed, I do not have I don't have what I heard spoke of this morning. I don't have that kind of revelation and I do need it. I realize that I need it. I realize that my life will be stable if God just would so grant it. And I will take your counsel this morning. And I will give myself unreservedly. I will seek this as life's great treasure. In Jesus Christ's name, whoever you are that may want to stand and I'm going to have prayer together with you. We'll sing again. In the presence of Jehovah. Can we do that? In the presence of Jehovah, [Music] God Almighty, Prince of Trouble, [Music] Christ. [Music] The more that I surrender, the more that I surrender to my Lord, the more that I the more you take control. The more that I humble myself, the more he me. [Music] We're going to sing it again, but I I'm taking some direction from God's prophet this morning as I listen coming to the service and how he instructed the ministers and how he instructed the people. And I'd like to say to you that are seated, these that are standing have stood because they've been moved from something within them. You that are seated, as you see these that are standing and know that in their heart something is throbbing, a hunger, a craving, a desire. Oh God, turn the light on within. I would ask everyone that is seated that you would enter into prayer for these that are hungering. Oh God, would you please meet with them? Maybe somebody near you that you even want to lay your hand on and pray with them. Oh God, there may be a father or mother near their a young person or a young person near a mother and father. Not everybody automatically has this revelation, but may it be something divinely given at this time. And in this service, friends, I don't want to wait for another service. I want it I want to see it take place now in the lives of those that are so thirsting and so hungering. We all want to enter into prayer for them. We're going to sing this chorus. The more that I surrender once again and then we're going to pray together. The more I surrender, [Music] the I [Music] release my tears, the more you take control, Lord, that I can humble myself. The more you lift me up every day, [Music] my Lord Jesus, how real you are. And I just go back in my own life now. I see various stations at various times when I was moved. I responded to the preaching of your word and I saw that you would back it up. Lord, these that have stood here this morning and I asked you expressly that you would you would speak your thoughts to the people and I take oh God I believe that it is the result of that you conveying your thoughts you've spoken it and brought it down into the hearts into that inner region of the people and they are believing it and receiving it and out out of honesty and insincerity, they're now standing, "Oh, God." They're standing with something beating in their heart, saying, "Oh Lord God, I believe what I've heard this morning, and I have stood to declare that I have not received the kind of revelation that I do have need of. I pray that you will send it down. Send it into me, Lord. and move out every doubt and every question that might be in my mind and in my heart. Oh God, move it out of the way. Come, sweet spirit. Come and take control. Come and take up your abode. Fill every room. Fill every part of my heart, oh God. And as the others pray for me, Lord, but I pray for myself. Oh God, I will never be moved from this direction. I've set my course this morning. I will seek, as your messenger has said, that revelation from you, Lord, for I certainly certainly desire. I want to have the revelation of the message and of the rapture and of those things that pertain to my moment, my time, and my life. Oh God, if I ask, you have said you will give it. I ask in faith and I believe that you will give it to me. I thank you for it now. Now I want all that stood asking you begin to thank him. Please, would you do that? You thank him for it. Don't hold your silence now. If you know that he's promised to give it to you, then the secret is you begin to thank him for it. Oh, we thank you, Lord. There may be some that are in need of healing. You need a revelation concerning the Lord that is your healer. Why don't you stand to your feet and receive that in the name of Jesus Christ? The same God that moved into the tomb and brought forth the body of our Lord Jesus Christ again. It stands here in this building and is moving throughout this audience. Oh God. Oh God that we shall see and give witness to that supernatural mighty acts of the Holy Spirit. We thank you for it. How many need of the Holy Ghost? You need you've not received the baptism. stand to your feet and receive it and say, "Lord, I receive it according to your promise. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. I give you thanksgiving, Lord, for all that you've done. All you've done for myself, all you've done, oh God, for this congregation. I give you thanksgiving. I thank you, Lord, that you've allowed us to be a lighthouse for this word. &gt;&gt; Let it be a stronger message, oh God. Yet, &gt;&gt; whatever it might bring, whether it brings reproach, oh God, we'll not we'll not avoid it. We'll not run away from it. We're here, oh Lord, to do your will and to do your bidding. Praise your name. Let everyone stand, shall we, please? Thank you, Father. [Music] &gt;&gt; Jesus revealed in me Christ, the transforming power. Christ the transforming power. The words of this are marvelous. Everyone, if you would please, everything that's in you, give yourself now in this direction. Christ the transforming light touches This mark of light, piercing the darkest night, [Music] making his glory shine. Oh, to reflect his praise. [Music] causing the world to see. Love that will grow till others shall know Jesus reveal in me. I'd like to have that verse. Life is no longer mine. [Music] Sing it with all your heart now. [Music] until I see [Music] all [Applause] [Music] the world to see. will go till I shall go [Music] in. &gt;&gt; Rather than say a prayer, &gt;&gt; I'll have you sing the prayer &gt;&gt; and the prayer will be the words we just sang. Life is no longer mine. [Music] Will you sing that prayer [Music] from the very depths of your soul? Say it to him. You say it to him. Lord, &gt;&gt; I give it all to thee. &gt;&gt; This is our prayer. Life is no longer mind. [Music] I give it all to thee. [Music] Fill me [Music] until my face. Oh, you reflect his grace, causing the world to sing. will go till [Applause] Jesus reveal me. [Music] You have prayed and I say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, may it be so. God grant it to you in this presence and in this atmosphere. I dismiss you. I would say do everything you can to remain in this presence, remain in this atmosphere and just keep moving in that one direction of surrender to it. Would you do that? [Music] How many were here Wednesday night and heard our brother Murphy? Wonderful. How many really believe it was the Holy Spirit speaking to us? Amen. I do too. [Music] Brother Murphy, which is translating the messages why you don't see them. And I'm saying this because we could talk about I'm going to dismiss you right now. We could talk about the saints of years ago in their deep consecrated life. But this is one man that's right amongst you. You've been moved and affected by his life. But I want you to know that I as his pastor, I have watched this develop. Say, how did how did he give himself to it? After a sermon on a Sunday morning, after sermon, [Music] I go into that room and he's on his face before God. Doesn't even look up when I come in the room. I've seen after Sunday evening I step in there and he's on his face and in the morning he's still there. Not once, more than once. [Music] That's where that kind of devotion is born. Doesn't come just raising your hand in a service. It comes by giving yourself and that is one thing our brother Murphy has learned perhaps even something of his culture but they given such devotion. I can say to you God perhaps may not call you to do exactly the same thing but he does call every one of us every man woman child in this building to give ourselves unreservedly. And when God speaks to you and deals with you give yourself. It's not something that happens in a few minutes and then we pass off of it. You go out of this building and you give yourself. You come back this evening and you've already given yourself. You're yielding. And when you feel that presence moving into the service, listen now, when you feel that presence moving into the service and you see, you know, there's a different atmosphere. Give yourself to it. Everybody throughout the whole congregation should give themselves to it. And I can tell you before God, you'll begin to see things happening right in the service, the supernatural taking place because the spirit of God has free course in the meeting. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; I do too. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus Christ's name. We'll see you this evening and hear the word that God has laid on brother Tom Ray's heart. You're dismissed. [Music]
