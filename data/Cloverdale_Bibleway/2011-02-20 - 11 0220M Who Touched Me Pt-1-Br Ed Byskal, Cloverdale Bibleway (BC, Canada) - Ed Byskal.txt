Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. We fall down. We lay our crowns. Amen. We're just going to go to prayer here in a moment. We have a testimony from the Weber family. They want to praise the Lord that brother Jim's in procedure in Portland went well. The doctors were amazed and Brother Jim is healed. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank all the saints for their prayers. Amen. We appreciate the Lord being with our brother Jim Weber guiding the surgeon's hands. Also from our brother Sam Walner. He wants to thank the saints for their prayer prayers for Sister Renie. The Lord has moved on her behalf. We just want to keep praying for a full recovery. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have many requests. A number that are in touch and body are needed touch and body that are sick right now. Satan's on a rampage. Amen. The Holy Spirit's on the move. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We're thankful. So, we want to remember these ones. There's too many to read, but our brother uh Frank Fletcher, Sister Hope Robinson, Dominic, Sister Buffy, all these ones are sick at home. We just want to pray that God would touch them and body our sister Luis Woods. Her blood pressure has been going up. She's not able to take the medication. She also needs blood work for her diabetes. She says, "God's will be done." I believe it's God's will that you be healed, Sister Louise. That's what the Bible tells us to pray for healing that by his stripes we are healed. So we just want to uplift you, Sister Luis in prayer. We bind our hearts with you. Just trust that the Lord will move on your behalf. Amen. Also, Sister Julian Israel in prayer for her spiritual life and she's up for an operation. We want to pray that God will move on her behalf for a total restoration. Amen. One more request for a friend of ours, sister Tina Dickinson's, a friend of hers, a close friend who's lost her husband. Just pray that God would move on behalf of this friend and use this time to speak to her heart. Many needs, there's something on your body, just lift it from before the Lord. First and foremost, we've come in worship. Amen. So, why don't we sing this song as we prepare to go to prayer? I'm going to ask our brother Tom if he would just come lay his hands on these requests. If there's something on your heart, just hold it before the Lord. Again, we bring the sacrifice of praise. So, let's lift his name. We've come here to worship him. We know that he's already met all of our needs. Amen. And so let's just bind our hearts together as we sing. We bow down, we fall down. Oh, and we fall down and we lay our ground. Oh, Jesus. Such greatness. [Music] His mercy and love. Oh Jesus. And we cry holy, holy, holy. And we cry holy, holy, holy. Yes, we cry. Holy, holy, holy in the lamb. We fall down. Oh, we fall down. We lay our ground [Music] mercy and hallelujah this morning with my Holy Lord you are holy holy holy holy and we holy holy holy. Amen. In one voice blessing we cry holy once more together. We cry holy Lord we cry holy holy holy cry holy holy you are holy holy holy holy [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Tom, bless you. &gt;&gt; We've read many requests this morning. Maybe there's needs that are here also that have not been mentioned. And we believe that Jesus Christ is present. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe that he's here to meet all our needs according to all his riches and glory. So if you have a need this morning and you want to raise up your heart, raise up your hand. Let's bend our our believing together. Lord &gt;&gt; to believe for a supernatural intervention of the great Holy Spirit. [Music] There is only one that we could turn to in our hour of need. Father, man would fail us, but you have never failed us. And Father, what a comfort there is in a scripture where it declares when the enemy would come in like a flood. But God, you will raise a standard. So the enemy has come, but we will take thus sayaeth the Lord as our anchor this morning. We will rebuke Satan. We will stand on thus sayaeth the Lord. We will say the devil is a liar. God's word is true. We will stand here as sons and daughters of God that will take you at your word and at your promise. You said, "Whatsoever you desire when you pray, you shall have what you ask." And so, Lord, as I lay my hands on these requests, hands are raised, hearts are lifted up. We are believers this morning. We believe, thus sayaeth the Lord, that by your stripes, we are whole. And, Father God, we will take that promise. We will be a Caleb this morning. I don't care how old we are in the faith. We are stronger now than we have ever been. And so this morning, Lord, as brother Ryan has read these requests and hands were so quickly raised, we want to give you glory. We want to give you honor. We rebuke the devil. We resist him in Jesus' name. We stand as the church of the living God that whatsoever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. We take you at your promise, Lord, that by your stripes We're whole. &gt;&gt; So every sickness must leave, Lord. Every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every line. And so we stand together shouldertosh shoulder. We are the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; We are the army of God. &gt;&gt; We stand now as sons and daughters adopted in thus sayaeth the Lord. And so, Father, we just pray for our little ones, our wives, and our children, those that have written in. &gt;&gt; We stand, Lord, on the word of God this morning, for it's true. Heavens and earth will pass away, but that word will never pass away. Abraham believed for 25 years. God, we're not going to stagger at the promise this morning. We are not going to look at the symptom. We are going to look to the temple of the word of God this morning. And there will be a deliverance. Lord, we believe your word. We do not ask him this. We believe. And thus saith the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every sickness we take under our control for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Father, we're not going to retreat. We are going to take what your prophet said. We're going to charge into the living word. this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; What a promise it is. What a rejoicing it is. &gt;&gt; You bore your stripes at Calvary when you cried, "It's finished. It's done." &gt;&gt; And by your stripes, we are whole. You bore it for us. And we claim that promise this morning. &gt;&gt; We are not doubters. We're believers. We have been schooled under thus sayaith the word of God &gt;&gt; and we stand as a fortified body in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; So every request that was written &gt;&gt; we believe for the fulfillment of it. &gt;&gt; It's on the way. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. We might have devils trying to fight the answer. &gt;&gt; But Lord, you are the mighty conqueror &gt;&gt; and every devil is defeated &gt;&gt; and we stand &gt;&gt; believing. [Music] So when the man of God comes, Lord, that there would be an atmosphere charged again this morning. &gt;&gt; We have come to hear &gt;&gt; from the very throne of God that we could pull on the word of God, Lord. That God, one great day that we will so pull, we will get a change within the atoms. &gt;&gt; And that's what we're believing for. So anoint the man of God and anoint our ears. Anoint the remainder of the worship. May it be true and pure. anoint brother Ryan we pray &gt;&gt; we thank you for this time &gt;&gt; in Jesus name &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; amen praise the Lord you have to have your seats want to say God bless you all welcome you all into the house of the Lord this morning brother Hank Danielle God bless you welcome nice to have you with us any who might be streaming just trust you'd feel a part of the service today. And we have a couple quick announcements. Um, there will be a meeting in the chapel after the evening service tonight to go over a project for the Korean messages that need to be made ready for the hub. And I'm not really sure what that says, but many hands make light work. So, if you're interested in helping with the hub project, you can come to the project uh the chapel after the evening service. Amen. And also young people's this Friday the 25th 7:30 our brother Obedoka is going to be with us and taking the service. So you want to be sure you can make that young people counselors but looking forward to a wonderful time. Amen. We're not going to delay the service any longer. Um brother's going to come shortly here. Uh why don't we sing Oh how I love Jesus. Oh how I love Jesus. Amen. I just want to rejoice. It's been on my heart for weeks now. You can't hardly have a bad I mean, you have a bad day, but you know, you can't stay down for long. Amen. We're so thankful. Just yesterday, my wife and I were driving, and for months, I've been having some kind of inner ear thing that will leave me extremely dizzy and it will come and go. It won't bother me for weeks, and it'll just hit me out of nowhere. And I've had different people tell me what they thought it might be. Apparently, you can have these tiny hairs inside your ear that gets dislodged and it throws your equilibrium off. And so I'm dizzy and I'm driving and that's going through my mind and I'm thinking all the different causes and something just says demon and I'm like that's right it is. It's like no no it's an it's an inner ear imbalance. No it's a demon. And so I just began to say in my mind demon you can't touch me. It's like get off of my inheritance. And it was a battle for about half an hour but it left and has been back. So praise the Lord. Don't let Satan sit on your inheritance anymore. We don't want any squatters on the land. Amen. So, why don't we sing this? We're going to invite the senior choir to come and sing, "Still I will trust you, Lord." And we'll sing, "Oh, how I love Jesus." Amen. Oh, there is a name I love to hear. Oh, I love to sing it. Oh, it sounds like music in my ear. Oh, it's the sweetest name on earth and how I love Jes. Why? Why don't you come? Oh, how I love Jesus. Oh, how I love Jesus. Because he first. Let's sing that chorus again. Oh, how I love Jesus. Oh, I know how I love Jesus. Oh, how I love Jesus. Oh, how I love Jesus. Oh, because he just sing it once more. Heart of Jesus. Oh, how love Jesus. How I love him. How I love Jesus. Oh. Oh, how I love Jesus. Because he burns me. [Music] [Music] climbed a mountain. [Music] I've walked a valley low. And there's a hand guiding me where to go. So I cannot question. [Music] and storm clouds come my way. For I have placed my trust in you and you alone. &gt;&gt; Still I will trust. &gt;&gt; I will trust you. &gt;&gt; Still I will follow. I will follow. &gt;&gt; Still I will listen to your every calling. &gt;&gt; Ages on. And I can't find my way. &gt;&gt; Still I will try. I will trust you, Lord, when in my dark hour. You restored my weary soul. You led me to that resting place and made me whole. So I cannot question those storm me. My faith is secure. Safe is my trust in you alone. &gt;&gt; Still I will trust. I will trust you. &gt;&gt; Still I will follow. &gt;&gt; I will follow you. &gt;&gt; Still I do to your every calling for the rages. [Music] &gt;&gt; And I can't find my way. Still I will trust. &gt;&gt; I will trust &gt;&gt; you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Still I will trust you. &gt;&gt; Still I will find. Will I will to your calling &gt;&gt; and I can't find my way. &gt;&gt; Still I will trust. Still I will trust you. Still I will trust. I will trust you, Lord. [Music] I will trust you, Lord. [Music] [Applause] I may want to send you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, it's a glorious day outside. &gt;&gt; Amen. and glorious day inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we have so much to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; Uh was thinking of the brother John Andy's is up ministering with brother Tim Dodd this morning. I was thinking maybe the whole family went up. I was hoping they didn't, but here they are. God bless you. Some are brother Kyle and sister Christina and some others are gone over to uh Vancouver Island and having a meeting there today. Some of the people are down at the camp and enjoying I suppose the glorious scenery there. So on one hand we kind of envy them, but on the other hand I don't envy them. They're down there helping brother Derek. He needed some help today. So uh but they're for sure streaming the services and uh we had an email this morning first thing one from Durban South Africa and another one from Israel and uh on Friday night about uh getting close to midnight between 11 and midnight got a phone call from brother Daniel and uh brother brother Dioa was in Israel he wanted to see if we could provide the number of the saints and the believers there. Brother Gear Rodald had just been there and so they were getting some ministry and I asked Brother Milco, please call Brother Daniel and let him phone brother Dioa and because it was going to be afternoon there and the arrangements all worked out just perfectly and brother Dioa got over with the believers uh brother brother Rodal put them in touch with uh I think a a Spanish-sp speakaking but they're Jewish people and a young man has become a believer about six years. And he brought his parents and uh she was in, you know, the traditional Jewish dress and he had the ke on and and but they enjoyed the meeting and uh and God is putting the little group of believers over there in contact with some that speak and can translate Hebrew. I tell you what, friends, God knows how to put things together. &gt;&gt; And then brother Dioa had people that were he said near him and that he had become acquainted with and they speak Hebrew as well. Uh so uh with with everything that's taking place right now, that whole Middle East area right from Morocco all the way up to Iran has erupted. And only God knows what the result of all of this is going to be. And I can tell you that what has happened in Egypt and the present regime that has been uh uh replaced or is being replaced at this time and it's in a state of transition. The people even the millions on on the streets and in the homes they don't know what the outcome is going to be. Israel themselves are I think apprehensive be and for good reason because one of the leading uh members of the whole Egyptian community is the is the Arab brotherhood and they have been very strong to voice. They are more the voice of the people and the people and uh the former President Barack uh uh they were uh they were not Mubarak I should say but they were they were not in keeping and for those of you that don't know when the Israel had that great victorious six-day war they took the entire Sinai Peninsula which is a border on them but which was Egypt And then Chiron, the premier of of Israel, who had a a brain tumor and went into a coma, and he still lives in a coma, but he he was kind of a renegade type of a general at that time. And he didn't when he came to the Suez Canal, he didn't stop. It was intended that he would stop rather than going into Egypt proper, but he didn't stop and he took his forces across the Suez Canal and encircled almost the entire Egyptian army and was only 90 kilometers, I understand, from Cairo itself. And he being the kind of general he was, he was like a general patent. He wanted to bust it through and take and conquer the whole country. But even the the the screaming and the crying from the United Nations that which they had already been on as soon as Israel starts making any headway, you know, the United Nations cry, but as long as they're being crushed, they don't say a word. &gt;&gt; And we all know that. And we there we know it's a spiritual thing. And so even his own country had to tell him, you know, stop. This isn't what we intended. we don't want to uh you know uh defeat this nation but they wanted peace. So what they did for peace was we will we will give back the whole Sinai desert provided that it be it remains as a demilitarized zone and that is the price of peace and so Egypt is one of the few countries only two I believe Jordan and and Egypt that have signed a peace agreement with Israel but now with a new regime coming in or new power going to govern the country. Israel is quite certain that that peace pact will not be honored. And the people who are got the loudest voice over there right now are saying that very clearly that that it needs to come by. And I heard someone speaking, one of the Egyptian uh professors or some one and he was saying very clearly the peace the the the the difficulty does not lie within Egypt. It lies within Israel and Israel needs to make peace with the Palestinians before they can really have peace with us. And so that, you know, is the pivotal point and and we know that these things have to come. And so you don't have to wait for a lot of unrest over there. There's a lot of unrest while we're sitting here peacefully in the comfort of the of the church. But they do not have that. There's a great deal of apprehension and uh and questions within the our our within Israel. And you can be sure God's eyes is on Israel. Just to distract from that, this for a moment, I saw I I just saw a picture. It came up on the MSNBC news, which is my computer page. And uh and it it just had a picture of the universe of of uh of our our solar system that's from the Earth. And they said that there's now uh they estimate 50 billion planets in our in our galaxy in our solar system. Not the universe, but in our Milky Way. 50 billion planets. When I was in prayer this morning, I I thought about that. The picture was very impressive. I tried to find it. I thought I might show it to you, but you've all seen those kind of pictures. And uh I just thought, you know, here we are on this insignificant piece of dust in the whole creation. But but God zeroed in on it. God focused on it for some reason. And God and when God said, "Let the earth bring forth," he was speaking about this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the waters bring forth. He was talking about this place. &gt;&gt; And when he brought forth the creatures and brought forth man, he was talking about this place. &gt;&gt; And then of all the space and time that God exists in, he just he he ordained to come to this place. &gt;&gt; This is incredible. &gt;&gt; Just imagine. And I was so moved by it and just so broken by it to think that God could even find me, find you. And he would be concerned. I mean, God, why are you concerned? Why are you interested? But God is even interested. And more than that, he's interested in how you're doing. &gt;&gt; So, how are you this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say, we're doing fine, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Have you been enjoying the meetings? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am too. Well, time goes on, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Brother Richard Drake, he he's uh finding out time goes on. I think he's turned another year today. That's the way it goes. Brother Richard, we just can't do anything about it. And while some of us are getting older, we're having young ones come. Brother Andy and Sister Esther Wither. They have a a new one that has come and you'll soon see him. We're going to dedicate him soon and uh we're happy for that. Brother Andy and Sister Esther, God bless you. God has given them a son. So, uh that's wonderful and we're happy about that. Amen. Well, I don't want to take any more time, but let's have you let's stand and I'd like to just sing if I could but touch. Uh, can you give brother give him some volume over there? I could touch the hem of his garment. If I could not touch some part of his throne. I knew I'd be healed. My sins all forgiven. If I could find him, I know I'll be home. and lift it up once more. If I could but the story I could just part of. I know I'd be healed. My sins all if I could not touch him, I know I'd be healed. Dear heavenly father, we have your word laying before us and we will soon read words that inspired this song, inspired the author. I ask Almighty God, you'll come down amongst us. You'll sweep away all human thought and weakness. &gt;&gt; That the Holy Spirit will come in all his strength and beauty. revealed Jesus Christ to us at this moment in this hour, Lord. And what you would what would please you to see happen today. We say &gt;&gt; do it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Do whatever is pleasing to you. &gt;&gt; We ask in the name of Jesus Christ that that name will is above every name will be glorified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cleanse us of all formality. Oh God, &gt;&gt; cleanse us of all just rel religiosity. &gt;&gt; We want none of that. Oh God, &gt;&gt; come amongst us. Teach us, Lord. I give and surrender myself to you. Father, I pray that you will accomplish and achieve every goal that is intended for this moment in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll have you turn in your Bibles to Luke the 8th chapter. And we're going to begin reading at the 43rd verse. And may I say to you that uh the service this morning is something that I've been pondering for some time. And just what the objective, what God has as an objective, I do not know. The first part of the message is rather elementary in some ways. And the second part we maybe get off into uh some scriptures that I have not put together the way they're coming together now. And so let's just pray that God will guide us in a supernatural way. &gt;&gt; I believe that it is timely and I believe that it's part of what God is doing. Amen. And incidentally, I look down see brother and sister Iberson, brother Nathaniel's mother and father. God bless you, &gt;&gt; brother Hank. Amen. God bless you. It was nice to see you. All right, we will read. And a woman having an issue of blood 12 years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any. came behind him and touched the border of his garment. And immediately her issue of blood stanced. Matthew in recording this said, "For she said within herself, if I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole." 45th verse in our reading. And Jesus said, "Who touched me?" When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee, and pressed thee, and saest thou, Who touched me? And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me, for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort, for thy faith hath made thee whole. Go in peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Jesus did not say my power has made you whole. Jesus did not say that uh that the that even the father had made her whole. He said your faith &gt;&gt; your faith &gt;&gt; something she already possessed. &gt;&gt; Your faith has made you whole. &gt;&gt; He didn't say your faith caused you to touch me. Your faith made you whole. &gt;&gt; That was the wholesome and substance of it. And virtue had left from him. The the strength or the dynamics left him. The same word that says you shall receive power after that the Holy Spirit has come upon you. Exactly the same word. Power left him. Virtue left him. And brother Brandham, you hear him mentioning it so many times, saying that the the faith of the people pulling on him, bringing the visions is what weakened him. But when God was going to do something sovereignly, there was there was nothing to it. There was no strength that uh left him at all. But Jesus said that her faith, thy faith hath made thee whole. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was just waiting for her faith to uh uh to reach out and to receive this be this a attribute that was there. I want to just draw a little picture for a moment. The throng also touched him. The throng did not gather with the intent and the determination that she came for. She had a determination and she had said in her heart, "If I may but touch &gt;&gt; his garment, the hem of his garment." That's what she had said in her heart. Many touched him in the press, the Bible says, "But they were all just part of the press." &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach to you right here. &gt;&gt; And all of you that are on the internet, I'm preaching to you. And there's there's people that are in need. And I'm preaching so that faith may be increased. &gt;&gt; We've had some glorious times, but we want to see we want to see the results. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't want to see the sick remain sick. &gt;&gt; We don't want to see the backslider remain a backslider. &gt;&gt; We don't want to see those that are in great need. We don't want to see those that are in financial distress to continue on. We want people to be able to lay hold of the promise of God. &gt;&gt; And we want a group of people that are that will live at the level in their inheritance. &gt;&gt; And I thank brother brother Ryan for uh uh his his last comments. So the throng that were gathered were gathered for different reasons. Some came because uh there's just there's a crowd of people here. They came because they were curious. Could be the same this morning. There were others that came because uh they they had a religious, you know, background and they were they were in wonderment about this young prophet from Nazareth and there's been all kinds of controversy about him and and some were there because they were against him. They were critical. People followed him to catch his words. Maybe they stream today to catch their words, but we don't care about that. Hallelujah. We're here to serve God. We're here to say what we're supposed to say. We're here to uh uh we're here to enjoy what God has given to us. But they were gathered for different reasons &gt;&gt; and they still do. Brother Brandham talks about the people that were able to touch him. He said the soldiers touched him when they put a a rag over his eyes and struck him and said who prophesy. If you're a prophet tell us who's tell us who struck you. They touched him but they got no virtue out of it. A lot of people touched him &gt;&gt; over the years. A lot of people touched him &gt;&gt; but didn't receive anything. But this woman did not come only seeking, but her faith told her, "If I may but touch &gt;&gt; the hem of his garment," what does she say? I will behold. &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that. &gt;&gt; Because I'm going into quite a few things that brother Brandham has said that if I can touch his garment, I shall be whole. And she had that one thing in her mind. She was not concerned about, and I speak to you now, she was not concerned about who was standing beside her &gt;&gt; or you who's sitting beside her. &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you that if you want something from God, you have to focus on that one thing, you have to be convinced in your own heart, this is for me, and I've come today to obtain that. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just to get enthused in the morning service, but that you have something that you're holding on to God for. And there comes a moment &gt;&gt; there comes a time &gt;&gt; and there comes an opportunity. &gt;&gt; But she wasn't concerned about who was standing near her &gt;&gt; or what her neighbor was thinking. &gt;&gt; She doesn't care about what her neighbors think. She doesn't care about who else is in church. She doesn't care about the people that were in the synagogue or in the temple today. &gt;&gt; That's not in her mind. What's in her mind, if I can touch his garment, I'll be whole. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that's in her mind. &gt;&gt; And that declared to her, it it became a substance to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why Jesus could say, "Your faith has made you whole." &gt;&gt; And you possess that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to be going through the message this morning and you'll find out the prophet of God if you believe him. He said you possess that, &gt;&gt; but it needs to be exercised. &gt;&gt; If you have a part of your body and you don't exercise it, it will atrophy &gt;&gt; and you'll find out that you'll have to start doing little small simple things to get your arm to work or to get your legs to work again if they if they lay idle for very long. If faith lays idle and Jesus spoke about weak faith. &gt;&gt; We don't want a weak faith, friends. We want an exercise faith. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That was the only thing she had in her mind. And thus she reached through a crowd down at the hem. She probably was crawling maybe between the people. And she was not just going to touch a man. &gt;&gt; She was not going to touch uh just Jesus of Nazareth because it was more than a man that was going to make her whole. &gt;&gt; So she was touching the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; She was touching the tree of life. &gt;&gt; She was touching the promises of God. And she probably was touching a whole lot more than she realized. &gt;&gt; Now, you'll have to stay with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was another woman. It was our first mother, Eve. And when God spoke and said that all the trees of the garden you can eat and partake of. And uh brother Brandham said and lean not to your own understanding. He said, "Eve was easily persuaded by Satan from the word of God, and she leaned on her own understanding because Satan had projected something to her which wasn't to her real understanding of God, but she had something else told her by the enemy, Satan, and she believed it." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now we find the results of this. It plunged the whole human race to death &gt;&gt; because the first mother, the first mother on the earth leaned to her own understanding contrary to the word of God and plunged the whole human race to death. Our first parents, Adam and Eve, had the privilege to walk, to fellowship, and commune with God in the cool of the evening. The Bible tells us, "But God had commanded Adam and Eve that they were not to eat, not to partake of the fruit." And the and and she said, "Even Eve said to the serpent, nor to touch it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not to touch it lest we die. We're not to connect with this in any way, &gt;&gt; lest we die. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field. And subtle is not only subtility in his manner. And people have, you know, talked about the serpent, the snake, and all the rest, how subtle they are, and da da da. But it was a lot more than that. Subtle in the in the Hebrew is that he was a refined being. He was pervasive. He was he was enticing. &gt;&gt; But he was refined even in his perhaps his structure. And brother Brandham said he was perhaps much more handsome than even Adam. &gt;&gt; He had a refinement about him. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, as you pondered and as I did, I'm going to pass this on to you. I pondered this cunning creature. Brother Brham said, "Don't try to debate with him on the word. He knows the word better than we do. &gt;&gt; We're not here in a debating process. We're here just to believe what God said and leave everything else aside." &gt;&gt; He was extremely cunning in his approach because he drew the one thing out of the conversation that God had with his children. He drew on the one thing that would appeal to the human psyche and that is the thing that had been forbidden. The one thing and it is you that are parents, you know that if you have something that you cannot have, that's the one thing they want. Right. &gt;&gt; I said to brother, "Oh, what is the family that the play and sang?" &gt;&gt; Cochman family. I I watch the Cochman family. One's playing the bass and one's great big guys playing the little mandolin and one's playing the violin and one's playing the guitar. And I just looked at that whole family, you know, and I thought, "How in the world did one family learn all these instruments?" So I went to brother Cochran right in a right after they played and sang an evening and I said, "How in the world did you teach these children? You know, it's enough to try and teach one, you know, uh, an instrument to be accomplished. And here they are accomplished in all these array of instruments. How did you teach them?" He said, 'Well, you know, he said, we didn't have any music in our family. None of my kids played. He said, I went downtown and I bought all these different instruments and I came home and I put them in their different rooms. And then I told them, "In your rooms are certain instruments, and don't you touch them." That was great psychology. He said, "I told them not to touch them because I knew they would. If I told them not to, they would pick them up." And he says, "That's how they learned to play." I thought, "Well, good for you. It really worked." But the the the the serpent now, and I make no comparison here, but the serpent, he had he had he was such a cunning, subtle creature. So out of everything that God had communed with them with Adam and Eve, he comes with the one thing and he says, "Uh, are can you not not eat of all the trees?" Well, all we are able to eat but this one. We're not to eat of that. And in the day we touch it, we'll die. &gt;&gt; So he says, "No, you won't die." And so the conversation goes on. And the woman said unto the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die." And the serpent said unto the woman, "You shall not surely die." So he says it was more subtle. He was more subtle by his approach, more subtle by the question that he asked. And as as I said earlier, the subtility is to be subtle is having fine structure. This right down to the encyclopedia bratannica. Having fine structure, delicately formed, pervasive. This is the kind of creature he was. And I thought of all the things he could have tempted her with. He went to the one thing to appeal to that part of the human, you know, the human psyche. I use the word that they it's scientifically proven people want what they're not supposed to have. They say something that's illicit is more enticing than something that you can have, something that is yours. And so that's what Satan works on. And they say they no longer had free access to the loving heavenly father who was also a holy and a righteous God. I want you to follow this close. Said, "Don't touch it." They did touch it and then were separated. &gt;&gt; And so now they don't even have access to God. And this is the whole plan. And the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become as one of us to know good and evil. And now, lest watch, please, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever." &gt;&gt; Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken. Now, we cannot stay there because I have quite a distance to go. But they touched and took hold. And the word touch in the scripture, you're going to find this as a you're going to have to really use your mind and let your mind and imagination loose for a moment because this is as a spiritual application. to touch in the scriptures. The first one is to actually not merely lay hold of, but it's it's the it used the word kindle as in a fire. When you begin a fire, when you kindle a fire, when you touch When you touch the burning substance with a flame and it bursts into flame, you've started something that you can't really pull back. That woman, she had a fire. She had something burning within her that was greater than all of her inhibitions, greater than all of her concern about who and what. And that's powerful. A lot of people right here in this church, you I'm talking about you. I'm talking about myself. We don't do certain spiritual things that we ought to do because who's beside us? You have to have a fire &gt;&gt; that becomes lit in you. &gt;&gt; You have to be touched by God &gt;&gt; so that you no longer care who what what is said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't you cannot concern yourself with the way you're supposed to be or I'm I'm sedate or I'm not emotional or I'm not loud or I'm not. You don't have to be loud, but you do have to have a fire. It has to be lit. &gt;&gt; And it isn't lit today and out tomorrow. &gt;&gt; It's not a Saturday night at at at camp and then out on Monday. &gt;&gt; No, it's not that. It's a fire. &gt;&gt; And that fire can burn. It's like blazing embers. Hallelujah. And the wind of the Holy Spirit comes and they burst into another flame. That fire is the fire that witnesses. That fire is a fire that that other people feel. &gt;&gt; That fire is what other people is attracted to. &gt;&gt; It's a fire of God. &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To lighten, to light, to kindle, &gt;&gt; to touch. &gt;&gt; We'll be building on that now. &gt;&gt; And so God said, "Lest they put forth their hand and and get the fruit of this tree." But that woman when the tree became flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She put forth her hand &gt;&gt; and took the fruit of life and she was whole. And the prophet said that's the that is the token evidence of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; She received a part of the resurrection &gt;&gt; while all the others listen to me. There may have been people in the press jostling around that were much more sick than she was. &gt;&gt; There may have been cancer cases, tubercular cases, all kinds of sickness and diseases much worse than her, but they had no fire. &gt;&gt; Nothing was lit inside. &gt;&gt; You don't even have to be around a whole bunch of people to have a fire. &gt;&gt; She didn't have anybody encouraging her. say, "Do it. Do it. Go on. This is the promise." She didn't have a bunch of encouragement. She said with her in her own self, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Because she had a revelation, "If I may but touch his garment, &gt;&gt; I'll behold." &gt;&gt; And it was put here in God's eternal book &gt;&gt; for you and I to read. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The devil's not going to be happy with the sermon, friends. &gt;&gt; The devil's not going to be happy with it &gt;&gt; because I'm preaching today &gt;&gt; that you can obtain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching today that you can defeat him &gt;&gt; by the power of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay under that thing. You don't have to stay pressed down. You don't have to stay depressed. You don't have to stay defeated. You don't have to stay sick. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There have been times now God was separated from mankind and the whole program of God is to become one again &gt;&gt; and he'll begin the process. Then we come to the children of Israel. One man e Abraham is receives the promise of the son and uh and Abraham is uh uh gives birth to a nation and God selects the Hebrew children. They're my children and they go into slavery and they God sends them a prophet. Let my people go and they do go and they go out into the wilderness. And then God commands Moses to come up into the mountain into Si and I'm going to talk to you there. And the fire came down on the mountain. But God said to God said to the prophet Moses, "Don't let the people come near the mountain and don't let the animals come near the mountain because this is a holy sacred moment. God is approaching trying to restore back fellowship. This is part of the plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; I must make my way back and find a way back. But he said, "Don't let anybody even touch the mountain. &gt;&gt; I'm not touchable yet. &gt;&gt; I'm a holy, just God. &gt;&gt; And if anybody touches the mountain, he will have a dart put through him and killed." The holiness required such a such a a recognition for the people to realize and it came down in the sight of all the children of Israel. And the Bible says God speaking and be ready against the third day for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount Si. And thou shalt set bounds. You'll set a boundary. Amen. &gt;&gt; unto the people around about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that you go not up into the mount, &gt;&gt; or touch the border of it. Whosoever toucheth the mount shall surely be put to death. &gt;&gt; There shall not a hand touch it. &gt;&gt; You can't touch this mountain. You cannot go beyond this boundary because God was bringing his word &gt;&gt; to his prophet. It's important for us to know that. But he shall surely be stoned. This is severe. This is kind of out of our realm of thinking today. But that's what God We've got to accept that's what God thought of his word. No wonder even in Israel today, those you have been there or seen pictures or documentaries or whatever and you'll see the priests, you'll see the uh rabbis and they'll and not everybody handles the scroll of the word, but they'll bring it and they hold it and they'll kiss it and they'll bring it out so delicately and roll it out and begin to read. It is. So after all of these centuries, they have never lost the holy regard for the word of God. They know nothing about the word becoming flesh. &gt;&gt; They know nothing about Jesus Christ as savior. &gt;&gt; They know nothing about him as healer. But this word is so sacred. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't think of handling the Bible the way you and I handled it. They have such a great regard for God's word, &gt;&gt; even in a written form. They will not even allow a printing press to print it. They must write it by hand because they say the words of God can only be written by the work of God, by the hand of a man. &gt;&gt; And so those scrolls are written by hand even to this day. That's the sacredness of it. There shall not a hand touch it. There shall not a hand touch it to reach or to extend, to attain to, to obtain. A hand shall not reach through. The holiness of the word of God coming to the people was so sacred. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the people were not permitted to even come near or to touch it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said on the in the the inside man, God when he settled over Mount Si that morning and Moses was up there to get the commandments, &gt;&gt; he said he was in the pillar of fire. Anyone knows that God the Father, &gt;&gt; anyone knows that that was as the angel of the covenant and the angel of the covenant was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he is in the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; No one could touch him. He's holy. No one can come near him. &gt;&gt; He said in Abraham's grace covenant, not three gods, but three offices of the same God. God the Father in the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God the Son in human flesh. &gt;&gt; God the Holy Ghost in you. &gt;&gt; The same God. Do you believe the first part? &gt;&gt; God the Father in a pillar of fire. Do you believe the second part? God the Son in Jesus Christ in the flesh. And then God the Holy Ghost. You believe this in you? &gt;&gt; A lesser God. No. The same God. Yes, &gt;&gt; just a piece of God. No, the same God, the same attributes, the same strength. This is what Satan hates. [Music] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to realize. He doesn't want you to come to the full realization that God is present in his people. &gt;&gt; You do too many things. &gt;&gt; You'd be destructive to his kingdom. And that's what the Holy Spirit is trying to get us to. &gt;&gt; I say, "God, help me. &gt;&gt; God help you." We certainly need prayer for one another. God help us. God help this church. God help the bride of Jesus Christ to come to this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I prayed for many of you this morning &gt;&gt; as I thought where you sat. and what God has been doing. I prayed for you that we could come to this place. Jesus said that day you'll know that I'm in the Father and the Father in me and I in you and you in me. What day? &gt;&gt; God sent a vindicated prophet to say this day. &gt;&gt; This day, not tomorrow. This day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan is a very very cunning and faithful adversary to point out every weakness that you have and weaknesses you don't have. &gt;&gt; To condemn you for things that's years ago under the blood of Jesus Christ to condemn you for things that God doesn't even know about. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said God trying to get back to fellowship with his creature and he created in the Garden of Eden he can't disobey his own laws. Man was sinful and when he settled on Mount Si if anyone touched the mountain &gt;&gt; must be thrust through with a dart. But when he was made flesh we could touch him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Something happened remarkable when he became flesh. We could touch him. &gt;&gt; But now he is God the Holy Ghost in his people. &gt;&gt; My question to you is still can we still touch him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can it be as effective? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can we go as far as the woman went or can we go further? Can I touch him? &gt;&gt; My message is who touched me? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham asked that many times. &gt;&gt; Who did she touch? &gt;&gt; Who did he touch? &gt;&gt; I'm 30 yards. I'm 40 yards. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he was made flesh, we could touch him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had to hold myself back because I'm so anxious to come to some more things and I'm going to watch my time. Now, he said he becomes a part of usmen &gt;&gt; to lead us and guide us and fellowship with us again. &gt;&gt; Eden being restored again. &gt;&gt; But when he was made flesh, we could touch him. God has made a way, a provision whereby we can touch and make contact with God. &gt;&gt; When he became flesh, he said, "Come unto me &gt;&gt; all ye that labor and are heavy laden, &gt;&gt; and I will give you rest." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was an invitation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as they were eating at the last supper, they had the communion, what we call the communion, but they had the Passover. Many times the Bible says it was as his custom. And then Jesus said, I believe in Luke's gospel, I've desired to have this communion with you, &gt;&gt; this last supper with you. Because he knew that was the last one he would have in that form. &gt;&gt; And they were eating. And Jesus took bread and broke it and gave it to his disciples and said, "Take, eat. This is my body. Don't just touch me, but partake of me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if you would believe it, this is my body. And eat it &gt;&gt; and let it come into you. &gt;&gt; Because this is part of the truth he's trying to convey. The father's in me. I'm in the father and I'm in you &gt;&gt; and you're in me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, if we could get that, friends, if we get that, that'd change this place, change your life, and change your home forever. &gt;&gt; I want a special note here. You have five senses. And the five senses are a great blessing and also a great enemy. &gt;&gt; And you have another one. You actually possess another sense and it's called the sixth sense. &gt;&gt; And this sixth sense I want to say today needs to be exercised. &gt;&gt; The sixth sense is faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God cannot be touched with our five senses. &gt;&gt; I don't care how you felt at the camp or how you feel here. God cannot be touched with the five senses, but he can be touched with the six sense. &gt;&gt; You can actually touch and contact God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that the that the children of Israel would have been sent stoned if they even had attempted it. And you're sitting here invited &gt;&gt; with a royal invitation. &gt;&gt; A written invitation. &gt;&gt; Come. &gt;&gt; Now about these five senses. If I probably could have the lights dimmed a wee bit, please. Five senses was given to man to contact his earthly home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We contact God by faith, the sixth sense. &gt;&gt; These five senses control this body. &gt;&gt; But the sixth sense is faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as these are as these are read, I want you to hear the prophet's voice declaring it to you personally. And make it personal if you would please. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the super sense is the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; the faith of God that dwells in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you'll let the five senses be yielded to the sixth sense, &gt;&gt; it'll guide you and bring all the other five senses under control to that super sense. And I say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; oh God, &gt;&gt; let this be more than a message. Let it be more than a Sunday morning sermon. &gt;&gt; Let us experience this. Oh God, &gt;&gt; let the six sense &gt;&gt; take control of my senses. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be ready to let go of these. &gt;&gt; What can your five senses do for you? &gt;&gt; Very little. &gt;&gt; But this super sense &gt;&gt; can touch the invisible God. Friends, this is not going to be an average Sunday morning service. &gt;&gt; God is calling on you. God is presenting it to you. &gt;&gt; And it's not merely my voice. I'm not just reading some words. I'm telling you what God, he spent 33 years vindicating this &gt;&gt; so that you could have it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be like the 10 spies. Be like Joshua and Caleb. &gt;&gt; Don't look at why you can't. &gt;&gt; Look at why you can. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For it's so far above the natural sense as the spiritual man is above the natural. It's as far above as high as the heavens is above &gt;&gt; the natural man and his five senses. Amen. &gt;&gt; It makes you believe things that you cannot see. &gt;&gt; I want you to read that line with me. It makes you believe things that you cannot see. Put your own name in there. It makes me believe things that I cannot see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It makes you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about it. &gt;&gt; The devil can get into these five senses and lie to you. Say that over again. The devil can get into these five senses and lie to you. &gt;&gt; But this is one but I like. He cannot touch the super sense. Satan cannot touch the super sense. And you are a possessor of the super sense. Exercise it. Become strong in it. &gt;&gt; Live by it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Live by faith. &gt;&gt; He cannot touch &gt;&gt; that super sense &gt;&gt; that's far beyond his reach. &gt;&gt; Not just beyond his reach, it's far beyond his reach. Satan cannot touch the super sense. Put it on your fridge. Put it on your wall. Say it in the daytime. Say it at night. The Satan cannot touch the super sense. And I am a possessor of the super sense. God my father gave it to me so I can touch him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That come from God. &gt;&gt; It's called what? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Faith. It's called faith. This mystery of faith. The super sense is called faith. &gt;&gt; We walk by faith. &gt;&gt; We live by faith. cuz we're the children of God. &gt;&gt; Faith is &gt;&gt; that great thing. &gt;&gt; Faith finds sources that others don't see. &gt;&gt; Faith is the sixth sense. &gt;&gt; Five senses are fine as long as they don't disagree with the sixth sense. &gt;&gt; So the five senses must agree with the sixth sense. We are to live by the sixth sense. And the five senses must be in agreement and in subjection to the sixth sense. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, uh, I don't feel it. I don't see it." Now, it's lying to the sixth sense. &gt;&gt; The sixth sense, it says, as it said to the woman, "If I may but touch him, &gt;&gt; I will be whole." &gt;&gt; Amen. And God will put us into places where and and we're all human. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm called to preach, but we're all human. If I hear things maybe hear things from the doctor or hear things from somebody else and it brings a sadness and you it it it it you know it just is something that you don't want to deal with and right away your mind. Hello &gt;&gt; goes into a turmoil and we become tormented in our mind not because of the six sense because of the five senses of this body &gt;&gt; and it brings us fear. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brings us fear &gt;&gt; and fear has torment. &gt;&gt; And Satan uses fear &gt;&gt; to lie to you. &gt;&gt; You're not going to get better. &gt;&gt; Get behind me, you liar. &gt;&gt; Get behind me. &gt;&gt; Start exercising that super sense. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm But I can't do it. Start exercising what little you have. &gt;&gt; You're not going to forget this service, friends. &gt;&gt; Even if you want these quotes, we'll give you copies of these quotes. &gt;&gt; The way they are. Where were we? But the sixth sense is faith. &gt;&gt; It's the substance of things hoped for. &gt;&gt; The sixth sense is not things hoped for. &gt;&gt; The sixth sense is the substance of things hoped for. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You don't see, taste, feel, smell, or hear, &gt;&gt; but yet you know it. &gt;&gt; Faith tells you so. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said to the woman, "Thy faith, &gt;&gt; hath made thee whole." &gt;&gt; She was already holding the substance before she touched his garment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's sure that it's real, that it comes to you a substance, not just imagination, but it's something. It's something you have. [Music] &gt;&gt; You have it. &gt;&gt; You have it by virtue of a sense that you have. &gt;&gt; I know I could reach my hand out. I have faith in my arm. I know that I could touch this. And when I touch it, I know that it'll be hard cuz my eyes tell me it's wood. And I can I I know how it'll feel. So I reach out and right away I have a sensation. I have a feeling. It's strong. It's sturdy. It's solid. If I if I can slap it and I, you know, I have a certain reaction. If I bang my elbow on it, I I I it may hurt. I know that because my senses are telling me all of that. But faith goes beyond that. Faith is something you don't see &gt;&gt; and you don't hear it. &gt;&gt; And you don't feel it. &gt;&gt; You feel rotten. &gt;&gt; You feel sick. &gt;&gt; But the promise of God says, "Ask what you will &gt;&gt; and it shall be done." &gt;&gt; That is more than an excitement. &gt;&gt; That is more than hope. &gt;&gt; It is a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said to my wife sitting at around the table and we said quite a number of times, we just get in the car, sit around the table. I say I I just feel so privileged. God has given us both such wonderful health. &gt;&gt; Such wonderful health. &gt;&gt; I go to the doctor. I go to the doctor frequently. My wife goes whenever we need to go. We go to the doctor. But I have a doctor &gt;&gt; that tells that doctor what to do. &gt;&gt; I have a doctor that tells him what to do. &gt;&gt; I have a doctor that baffles this doctor &gt;&gt; says, "Well, you got this. Take another test." No, we can't find it. Good. &gt;&gt; I'm happy for both. I'm happy when he says you got it. I'm happy when he says it's gone. &gt;&gt; God, to God be the glory. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he has to lay you in with sickness so you can look up. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he has to set you aside because you got too busy &gt;&gt; and you have to find out that the all the busyiness isn't important, &gt;&gt; that there's something else that's more important. &gt;&gt; Am I making some headway? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where are we at? Faith finds sources that others don't see. Faith is the sixth sense. Five senses are fine as long as they don't disagree with the sixth. But the sixth sense is faith. It's the substance of things hoped for. You don't see, taste, feel, smell, or hear, but you know, but you know it. Faith tells you so. And it's so sure that it's real, that it comes to you a substance, not just an imagination. It's something that you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing. I'm going to just just take that off for a moment, please. Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Well, we've heard that so many times. And brother Brandham says that now he's in a meeting. He said he's here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can't see him. &gt;&gt; You couldn't feel him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham couldn't see anything more than you can see. &gt;&gt; He knew by his call &gt;&gt; and he knew by the presence of God. &gt;&gt; If you feel and sense a certain presence, don't just say, "Well, this is blessing." Say, "He's here." That's what you need to say. He's here. &gt;&gt; He may be there to bless. He may be there to do a lot of other things, but he's here. &gt;&gt; That's what God wants you to say. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; He wants you to say that in your home. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The sacrifice is here. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm saying it because I believe I feel I need to say it in this sanctuary. &gt;&gt; We got to go beyond &gt;&gt; even being just blessed. Got to go beyond &gt;&gt; an an altar call. Got to go beyond what we've done where we've been before. &gt;&gt; We have to make some confessions. And maybe you haven't said that enough times. And brother Brandon says, "How how long should you say it?" You say it till you believe it. till you actually believe it. &gt;&gt; He is here. &gt;&gt; He is in me. &gt;&gt; I have become one with God. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; You'll have to do that to go forward in the rest of this service. &gt;&gt; What I have to say, he said, and the angel of the Lord, he said, he is here. &gt;&gt; And he said, now pray. That's important. Pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. The angel turned his back to the audience. Talking about the angel who came to Abraham, he turned his back to the audience. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "Somebody in these sections over here." So he turned his back. Somebody in these sections over here, he said in this section over here, you pray &gt;&gt; and God that for God to do something for you and just see if he will still remain the same angel of God or somebody anywhere, wherever it is. He said, "Now, now he's still got his back turned and he says now somebody is contacting God." &gt;&gt; Amen. How could he say that? Because he is feeling &gt;&gt; he is feeling that pull. &gt;&gt; And God sent this kind of a visitation so he could bring a special message to us. &gt;&gt; This God didn't depart when William Brandham departed. &gt;&gt; This God didn't depart. This God moved on to even do greater things. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Greater things. When brother Brandon was here, his crowds had diminished to a few hundred from hundreds of thousands. What would he have done? What would he have? What kind of message would he have brought us? So he said, "Man, everybody left me." But instead, he preached the seals. He knew he was sent back. He knew it was a commission. And he said, "10,000 of my friends will leave me now." &gt;&gt; Did that stop him? No, that didn't stop him. He was moving forward on his call. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly where you are. That's where I am. That's where we are. We're called to be the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; My objective, your objective is the marriage table. &gt;&gt; We're on our way to the marriage table. Say it. believe it. &gt;&gt; I'm on the way to the marriage table. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't want you to say that. &gt;&gt; My feeling doesn't tell me that. My feeling tells me I'm getting to be an old man. But my faith is, oh God, I'm looking for the resurrection. I'm looking for the rapture. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's my sixth sense. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I pass this world without having experienced it, that six sense will take me out of the grave. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; You You know me and you understand me. I wouldn't say anything to hurt anyone, but uh one of our native young men, when I say ours, he was a son of a woman who's up in White Horse now, but this young man died and died a under rather strange conditions in a prison and they asked me to come and take the funeral. So there was, you know, his girlfriend and her friends and other friends and they came there with their drums and their sticks and they wanted to have part of the service to be up and beat their drums and go through religious ceremony. And I said, "No." The people said, "Do you mind that?" I said, "Yes, I don't I wouldn't have that." So they were kind of disappointed and sat there. But I preached what God had put on my heart. But when we got and we were putting him down in the in the in the ground in a casket, they brought their drums and I they wanted to beat their drums. And I stepped over to them and I said, "No, I don't I don't want you to feel bad. You have to know who you are. &gt;&gt; You have to know that you have something more." And I said to them, about three of them, I said, "Listen, please don't feel bad." I said, "Your drums won't bring him out of the grave. What I have to say will bring him out of the grave. &gt;&gt; What I have to say, what he's believed in and what his mother prayed and believed for him will bring him out of the grave. But your drums won't breed him out of the grave." I'll tell you what, friends. church church annity just having a nice little service even around the message that won't bring you out of the grave. That won't put you in the rapture. I'm concerned about what's happening in the message. God is stirring me very very deeply from things that I've seen and we cannot just be another church. &gt;&gt; We got to be something far beyond that. &gt;&gt; God gave us too much. God brought us too much. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gave us a word to live by. And this is the same supernatural God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And don't you ever give up. That's one thing. Faith will not Faith will not give up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody's contacting God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I believe &gt;&gt; without any question, without a shadow of a doubt, &gt;&gt; these meetings that we've had, people can say, I don't want to even refer to it as winter camp. It's just some more meetings, just another minister. Incidentally, this next Friday night will be brother Oedoka. He's going to come and speak to the young people. And as many people as want to come there, it doesn't make any difference to me. You adults want to come be in the fellowship room. I'll be there, Lord willing, Friday night. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God has been using our brother Rich uh brother Richard, his father Oed. And so we're looking forward to that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now somebody's contacting God. &gt;&gt; I stood I didn't feel any great emotion. They talk about Saturday night the C. I didn't feel any emotion. I was happy. I was just happy to see what God was doing. I didn't feel one thing. &gt;&gt; Not one thing. I went up to the cabin. I listened floating over through the air praying and the rejoicing and going on and on and on. That that's wonderful. I don't feel anything spectacular, but I just I am rejoicing because I know it's God's word. I know that this is what you're supposed to receive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you were here the other the other day, you brothers and praying. I played it again last night late in middle of the night. Brother Joel and brother Ben and the other boys that were around. I was rejoicing, &gt;&gt; but I didn't feel any great excitement because this is what's supposed to happen. &gt;&gt; This is almighty God. &gt;&gt; Mother and dad have prayed &gt;&gt; and they've believed and we shouldn't be shocked when people are healed. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be shocked when they're made whole. We shouldn't be shocked when we touch the hem of his garment. We don't understand it. It's another sense. It's a sick sense. But I'm here to tell you it works. It works. &gt;&gt; And God's not done working. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you're going to hear more preaching like this. &gt;&gt; Cuz God's raising up an army. There'll be preachers out there. And you're going to hear more witnessing &gt;&gt; because there's a power, a surge coming within the body of Jesus Christ. Brother Brandham even said, "You sisters, you're going to lay hands on." He said it. &gt;&gt; You can lay hands on somebody. &gt;&gt; God will hear your prayer. [Music] &gt;&gt; You mothers can lay hands on your children. You don't even have to call the preacher. You lay your hands on them. I know who I am. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil tell you you haven't got a right. You have a right. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; He says in another message in Phoenix, I'm going to turn my back to you. &gt;&gt; While you pray, while you pray. Notice how he said that while you pray. We need to be a praying people. &gt;&gt; Stay in an attitude of prayer. &gt;&gt; You can be busy and praying. You can be working and praying. You can be in your studies, in your classroom, and be in an atmosphere of prayer. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; I'm going to turn my back while you pray. I'm going to talk to brother Duplac. brother. He turned his back because brother Duplac was sitting there and a brother uh uh a brother Mccanley he says and sitting back here he says I want to to you as ministers I no he's trying to tell the ministers trying to teach the ministry he says and and I want to just say right now to you ministers I want to say right now you watch &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; you can't tell me that this prophet didn't have confidence in what he had. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he's trying to tell you, you have the same thing. Not by the same call, but the same quality, &gt;&gt; the same person. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can say he's here like he said he's here. &gt;&gt; You can say I'm healed like he said you're healed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He says, "Now watch. Somebody is in this audience is coming in contact with the Holy Spirit behind me. Somebody's coming in contact." I will say without being brazen, somebody is coming in contact with the Holy Spirit that's out here &gt;&gt; that's in front of me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you're listening to the word and you're believing it. A vindicated prophet told you, you don't need brother Ed Biscll to tell you a vindicate. I'm simply studying what he said. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you under the uncction of the Holy Spirit. This is the only vindicated message the world has. &gt;&gt; 2 million Muslims don't have it. A million Catholics don't have it. All the denominations don't have it. The bride of Jesus Christ has a vindicated message. God vindicated it. He He went the second mile so you would believe it &gt;&gt; so that you'd confess it &gt;&gt; and say it's mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And no one can take it from me. He went on to say, "I feel in my own makeup that the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, somebody is touching him." &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I I Please understand me. I am intrigued and somewhat mystified, but I realize that it's got to go beyond my own mental capacity. That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to know something about this touching him. And he asked, there's a woman sitting in this direction right here over here that just contacted the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That service is no different than this service. &gt;&gt; Someone just contacted the Holy Spirit and she's suffering with a heart trouble and sitting right down there. She's having trouble taking salt in her food. And you believe with all your heart, lady, stand up. That's true. And it's all over now. &gt;&gt; You can go home. Be well. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Tell me." He's asked the congregation, he asked the preacher, "Tell me, who did she touch?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did she touch? Now faith I said earlier faith needs to be exercised. Can I go on a few minutes please? &gt;&gt; Faith needs to be exercised. He said somebody said all things are possible with God. Nothing impossible. Uh but all things are possible to you also. &gt;&gt; Nothing impossible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; All things are possible brought right down and made you. If you just know who God is, &gt;&gt; I'm afraid that the church doesn't know their authority. I'm afraid that the Holy Ghostborn men don't realize their authority or the authority that God has permitted to his church. Here's a vindicated prophet. I'm afraid this was one of his apprehensions that the church doesn't know their authority. Oh God, let this church, let these people, let the bride of Jesus Christ come to know their authority. &gt;&gt; You may not have the power, but you have the authority. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid that Holy Ghostborn men, I'm one of those, and I don't want to be that one that doesn't realize their authority or the authority that God has permitted to his church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll give unto thee the keys to the kingdom. Whatsoever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. Whatsoever you loose will be loosed. I give you power over serpents and over all kinds of diseases. I give you power over all kinds of diseases. Jesus said it. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said it. And you have a right to say it. &gt;&gt; I've received power over all kinds of diseases. Oh everything and nothing shall harm you. Exercise your faith. &gt;&gt; Exercise your faith. &gt;&gt; You say, "What if I fail? Did you walk the first time you had a a step? Did you run and do a high jump when you took your first step? Did you ever stumble or fall?" You still may do it again, but you get right back up and you keep exercising because you say, "I can do this. I can do this. God said I can do it. &gt;&gt; The word of God said I can do it. Jesus said I can do it. The prophet said I can do it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I will sooner agree with them than even agree with the five senses. &gt;&gt; If I fall, I sooner agree with God's word than the fact I fell. &gt;&gt; I failed God. &gt;&gt; We all failed God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. All things are possible &gt;&gt; to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, we went to prayer service. I heard of you praying, Brother Ricard. Hallelujah. I know that your daughter has got to be on your mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not excitement, it's faith. &gt;&gt; And they said in her heart, she shall be healed. &gt;&gt; I shall be whole. They shall be whole. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have you ever had times when it didn't happen? Yes. &gt;&gt; I've had times it didn't happen. I had times it went sideways. I had times we would turn to the medical. I don't consider the medical field a failure. I don't consider that my faith failed. I don't consider that. I just say God, however. But nevertheless, I will never cease quoting your word. I will never cease believing your word. I will not allow my faith to be affected by your word. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, as a believer, we don't have any other option. &gt;&gt; You don't have any other option. &gt;&gt; It's not as though, well, I'll try this. There isn't anything else to try. This is it. This is it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it loose. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And let God have his way &gt;&gt; and God will grant it to you. &gt;&gt; I find two classes of people. One, the fundamental. And the other one, the full gospel. They're both fine classes of people. But there's the trouble. The fundamental knows what they are positionally in Christ, but they don't have much faith to exercise it. The full gospel's got plenty of faith, but they don't know what they are. &gt;&gt; So, you have to have all of that. You can have all the faith in the world, but you have to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like a man's got a lot of money in the bank, but he don't know how to write a check. And the other man's got no money in the bank, and he knows and he knows how to write a check. If I could ever get those two together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I have healing services, now watch this one closely. When I have healing services, hundreds of people that way, they come to the platform. Oh, brother Brennan, I got all faith. He said, if it was ink, in other words, if their faith was ink, it wouldn't dot an eye. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, you got hope instead of faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just hoping. And I'm just hoping it won't even dot an eye. It's not enough faith to dot an eye. God didn't say, "I'll give you enough to dot an eye." &gt;&gt; So, I'll give you enough that all things shall be possible. &gt;&gt; I Christ in you. &gt;&gt; I'm the revealed word in you. &gt;&gt; I'm the manifestation of the invisible God in you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. As you confess it, it'll change things in your life. &gt;&gt; It'll change things in your whole up makeup. &gt;&gt; He said not enough ink to dot an eye. See, he said you've got hope instead of faith. Faith is positive. &gt;&gt; There's no nothing can move it. &gt;&gt; It's positive. &gt;&gt; No matter how sick you got, &gt;&gt; how everything went. &gt;&gt; Now, if you're trying to bluff it, it won't take bluffing. The devil's a bluff himself &gt;&gt; and he knows how to run a bluff. &gt;&gt; But when you got the goods &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the goods. &gt;&gt; When you got the goods &gt;&gt; and you believe it &gt;&gt; with unshakable confidence. &gt;&gt; When you got the goods, &gt;&gt; it don't take loud hollering and it doesn't take stomping and screaming. It takes faith. and he will recognize it. And don't worry, just say the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says he's not against he's not against shouting. He's not against hollering. He said he does it and I'm a Baptist. He said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; He says, "And when you get healed and God does something for you, of course you shout and you holler. &gt;&gt; Don't let that dampen you. &gt;&gt; God's done lots for us here. &gt;&gt; You have a lot to shout and and thank God for." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He may save you. Not he may. &gt;&gt; He will. &gt;&gt; He has. &gt;&gt; He's just only wanting you to believe it and exercise a little faith. &gt;&gt; You are saved. &gt;&gt; You are saved. Joel, &gt;&gt; you are saved. &gt;&gt; Brothers, sisters. &gt;&gt; God did do. It wasn't you at camp. It was God at camp. It's not you just in not me just preaching it. It's God doing it. &gt;&gt; God is telling you who you are. &gt;&gt; You won't even want to be around negative people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the balcony say amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's greater than your problem and your need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you do that? Can you believe tonight for anything? Oh my brother, sister, if you could only take a hold yonder and say, "Yes, Lord Jesus, I believe it." If you believe it deep enough in your heart, there's not enough devils in this country &gt;&gt; to keep you from being healed tonight. &gt;&gt; There's not enough devils in North America, in the United States, in Canada, in Europe. Not enough devils. He said it. &gt;&gt; You know, I've come to the place I'm not even going to try to see people healed. I'm just going to do what the word says. I'm not going to try to even see them sealed. I'm just going to see see them saved. I'm just going to do what the word says. Preach the gospel. Lay hands on the sick. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God does the rest. &gt;&gt; I can't give you a revelation. &gt;&gt; I've striven sometimes to give a revelation. The opening of the word in the third pull. He's the revealer. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's going to make it revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not enough devils. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you have trusted me to be the servant of the Lord, &gt;&gt; I want a positive response &gt;&gt; out of this. &gt;&gt; Do you trust Brother Brandham as a true servant &gt;&gt; of the Lord?" &gt;&gt; He's laying this out to the people &gt;&gt; and that I have preached to you the Bible. And I say amen. &gt;&gt; You have indeed, servant of God, prophet of God, you have indeed preached &gt;&gt; the truth of the Bible. &gt;&gt; For Christ has come down and permitted me to prove to you that he is here &gt;&gt; and living and raised from the dead. Then hear me speak the solemn truth. &gt;&gt; He was wounded for your transgressions. And with his stripes, you were healed. You've got the power in you. If you've got the faith to exercise and do you believe it as a servant of God, I say yay and amen. That's what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; That's what pro the prophet of God said. That's what his messenger said. Vindicated messenger &gt;&gt; as a solemn statement. &gt;&gt; He's saying that to us. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got the power in you. &gt;&gt; You've got the sixth sense in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have the faith to exercise it, and faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God, and that's what you're hearing today. &gt;&gt; Whether you realize it or not, faith, the level of faith is rising &gt;&gt; within you. &gt;&gt; There was a young man there. Brother Bram says, "Young man," he addressed him, "you've been bound for some time, too, haven't you? You believe Jesus?" Look, young man, you'll be bound to that chair as long as you live if you don't exercise faith and believe he's in a wheelchair. Do you believe it now that you're sitting in his presence? You do. He may not have felt anything special, but he says you do. You You do. He's asking, "All right. Won't you rise up in the name of Jesus Christ and walk on out? You're not bound anymore with the powers of hell. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; He said the Bible said this is in who is God. &gt;&gt; Let me just go for a few more minutes please. &gt;&gt; Who is God? He says, "No wonder cripples when you realize that can straighten out. The creator's here. &gt;&gt; No wonder blind and they can't see opens up. The creator's here. &gt;&gt; The creator. They realize he says the Bible said we are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; His offspring." Now, now then you're something like God was. Jesus said himself, "It is written, you're God's written in your law. We become a part of God, a son of God by adoption through Jesus Christ. You'll become a daughter and a son of God by adoption through Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ adopted you, &gt;&gt; gave you his name, &gt;&gt; gave you his nature, &gt;&gt; and brought you into the family &gt;&gt; through his blood." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're birthed by the blood. &gt;&gt; The blood of God, &gt;&gt; therefore, if you realize that the very God that made the dirt and the earth and whatever is here is living among men, where's your faith at, friends? And he said, "These things do I when he was here on earth, greater shall you do, for I go to my father. Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, &gt;&gt; believe that you receive them, &gt;&gt; you shall have them. &gt;&gt; That's the creator speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then quoting him, then it doesn't lay in him. It lays in you. &gt;&gt; Wow. This goes way beyond your understanding. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Goes way beyond what you can figure out by your senses. &gt;&gt; Right. You don't feel that. You'll never feel that. But you can cause this mouth to say it. &gt;&gt; And you can cause your mind to think and ponder it and to pray &gt;&gt; and to pray. &gt;&gt; Make that real. Oh God, make that real. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "When this growth is dead, that's why I had Lyall on my heart so much." And I trust he's listening. When this growth is dead, it shrinks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The patient rejoices. Oh, how happy. in a few days and they find themselves worse off &gt;&gt; than when they were in the first place. &gt;&gt; Now, what are your senses going to say? Your senses are going to say, "I'm worse off." &gt;&gt; Listen to how a seventh grade educated Kuckian speaks. It's not the Kuckian education, friends. This happens to be the throne of God speaking. This happens to be the creator &gt;&gt; who flung stars into space. &gt;&gt; Hear him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear him. &gt;&gt; He said, "And they're worse off than they were in the first place. Oh well, they say, I guess I lost my healing." And just as sure as faith taken it away, unbelief resurrects it again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; As sure as faith takes it away, unbelief resurrects it again. I'm preaching to you, friends. &gt;&gt; He said, furthermore, you you're healed as long as you believe it. And he said, "You're also saved as long as you believe it." &gt;&gt; If you cease believing that you're saved, then it will resurrect the darkness &gt;&gt; and give Satan an open door. &gt;&gt; Whenever he comes, that's the most subtle thing. Say, "You don't feel saved." Forget how you feel. &gt;&gt; You failed God. Forget your failures. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got something in you that's greater than your failure. It's called the power of God. &gt;&gt; Don't sink back down. There's too many. That's why I'm preaching this way &gt;&gt; amongst the house of God, amongst the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. whatsoever things you desire when you pray that it doesn't lay in him, it lays in you. &gt;&gt; He says, "And then we fellowship with Adam, &gt;&gt; lost in the fall, Christ restored in his death." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; To bring man back into fellowship with God. Now he says, "Now the church has moved up to that fellowship with God. Communion like Adam in the beginning in the Garden of Eden, taking all sin away, free from condemnation, Holy Spirit cleansing us from all sin. Now you're free to exercise. And this is why I read this whole quote. Now you are free to exercise the next step in God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say, "Bring it on. &gt;&gt; Bring it down. Bring the next step. &gt;&gt; Now you're ready to exercise the next step in God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You young men, young ba, young families, young people, you can lay hands on one another. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I had a friend, Billy Andrews. You know Billy Andrews? He got a growth on his nose and every morning that he shaved, he had that growth on the side of his nose. He and he told me personally he had that thing for months. He said, "I laid my finger on it every morning and cursed it in the name of Jesus Christ." He didn't come running back and say, "Is it gone?" As long as it was there, he cursed it &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. He says, "And one day it just dropped off." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He believed it. &gt;&gt; He believed something was happening when he put his finger on it. &gt;&gt; I curse it in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God's against these things. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Satan wants us to become accustomed to sickness and accustom. Oh, get your shots. And are you afraid of shot? No, I'm not afraid of a shot. I got a greater shot than anything you put in my arm. &gt;&gt; They've been trying to get me to take a flu shot. your age, you need to take the flu shot. They they just pages full of advertising and H12N or who knows what how many N's, all these flu and and then they ended up I said I said to my wife, "This thing's a hoax. &gt;&gt; This thing's a hoax. They're coming up from the States because they run out of flu stuff down there and they're lined up there and I I watched the lineup, Brother Tom, what they're all talking, oh, they're so happy we can get our flu shot. Hallelujah. I'm glad I got one in church &gt;&gt; long before that flu shot came along. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here as a testimony. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You folks that have gone sick into bed, I don't I don't say anything about it. I say God raise faith in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I and my wife haven't had a flu for so many years, we can't even remember. And of course, a good thing we forget what we did yesterday. &gt;&gt; We just I can hardly remember being sick. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God's our healer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And most of the time if I don't get feeling very good, I generally come to work or come to church anyway. You don't know how many times I sat here. I did. I I didn't feel I wanted to be here, but I sat here because I'm better off here. &gt;&gt; I'm better off under the word of God. I'm better off in the atmosphere &gt;&gt; and I'm just as sick at home, so I might as well be here. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I don't feel very good. I guess I'll stay home." That's no excuse. If you don't feel good, come to the house of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Is this all right, folks? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm over time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But I just have to the growth is dead and it shrinks and your unbelief will resurrect it again. He says, "But when you get sick after about 72 hours, you're supposed to." He said, "A dead ball of flesh in your body, what purifies the blood?" The heart purifies the blood and the heart pumps it and causes an infection. causes fever and all kinds of feelings and sickness. And after 72 hours, if you've been prayed for with cancer, tumor, or anything, and you begin to get real sick and a high fever, that's one of the best signs in the world that you're healed. Just keep on. &gt;&gt; See, your faith is not what you feel. Your faith is what you believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you really believe it, &gt;&gt; I don't care how you feel, &gt;&gt; you'll you'd never never say you wasn't healed. &gt;&gt; You'd always believe it. &gt;&gt; That's what does it. &gt;&gt; That's what exactly the woman who went through the press. That's what she had. &gt;&gt; It was already done. &gt;&gt; She was holding the substance when she reached through and touched his garment. Amen. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Quickly, I'm I'm going to just something I have to come to. I want to read I want to read a scripture and then uh if you if you'd sooner just have the note down it'll be fine. Now I'm kind of reaching out. This is where it's not just so you know fundamental things. Uh now we've come to a a ministry that was an unusual ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That said, turn my back. Somebody's touching the Holy Spirit. The woman right here. He said something about one woman and uh she didn't identify. He says, "Are you standing up?" Oh, no. He said, "She's not standing up." So he then he turned and I think he even spoke her name and then turned around and says, "Stand up." Well, it wasn't hard for her to stand up when she heard her name. &gt;&gt; And now we've had this kind of ministry. Don't let it get common to you. Now watch very close. &gt;&gt; Please watch very close. When this one now was going through the process, the word had become flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the flesh man went to Calvary. And then he was resurrected. And one of the women, I believe Mary, came and Jesus said to her, "Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou?" And she supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you have borne him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away." She's uh still hanging fast to that person, the man Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who did all of these things. And she's hanging at him. He's speaking to her. But things have changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; There's another phase. It's the same Jesus, &gt;&gt; but he's in a different form. &gt;&gt; And Jesus and and then said, "And and I will take him away." And Jesus said to her, "Mary," called her by name, too. &gt;&gt; And she turned herself, and said unto him, Raboni, which is to say, "Master." And Jesus saith unto her, "Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended." &gt;&gt; He had to ascend with the blood. I've not yet ascended &gt;&gt; to my father, &gt;&gt; but go to your go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my father and your father &gt;&gt; and to my God and your God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then another account, he apparently had ascended and descended &gt;&gt; because he was with the apostles and disciples and believers for some days. And as they went to tell his disciples, as he went as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "All hail." And they came and held him by the feet and worshiped him. &gt;&gt; And then Jesus on the mat on Luke the 24th chapter. Listen very closely and don't be please don't don't let your mind get fogged up. In Luke the 24th chapter, the second last service that the prophet of God spoke out of Luke 24. And he called the two men on the way to Emmas. modern events made clear by the prophecy. &gt;&gt; And this was the prophecy. &gt;&gt; And by him speaking it, it would become clear &gt;&gt; by him speaking it. And the Lord and and and these people, these men were saying, "And the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared unto Simon." &gt;&gt; And they now these two are telling the other apostles what has happened. And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said unto them, "Peace be unto you." &gt;&gt; And they were terrified &gt;&gt; and afrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. Now, folks, it's another it's another way. It's another form. This is a lesson for all of you that are in school education. It's another form. &gt;&gt; And they were terrified and thought they'd seen a spirit. And he said unto them, "Why are you troubled? And why do thoughts arise in your heart?" See, they couldn't sort it all out either. Sometimes we can't sort it all out. That doesn't change what God's doing. Don't give up on it. Don't revert back to your senses because you can't figure it all out. And he says, "And why do these thoughts arise in your hearts?" And then he says, "Behold my hands &gt;&gt; and my feet. &gt;&gt; It is I myself handle me. For a spirit hath not flesh and bones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet. 2,000 years. About 2,000 years later, the whole scene is going to change again. &gt;&gt; Amen. and Luke 17:30 must be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Squeeze your mind now. Pinch it. &gt;&gt; And when the day of Sodom and the day of Noah, in that day I'll be revealed. I &gt;&gt; who's here showing his hands and his feet. &gt;&gt; I will be revealed. &gt;&gt; Who could reveal it more than he himself? &gt;&gt; He'll be the one that'll be standing at the platform. He'll be the one who's speaking through that seventh age messenger. He'll be the one who's doing all of these things. He'll be the one who is speaking to the bride, his own bride, through that messenger. And thus it would have to go on tape. And thus it would still be on voice. And thus it would be in message books. And thus you would hear it. And thus it would be conveyed to you. And then he and and and then that messenger he coming. Is this earth? Is this the sign of the end? And he goes to Revelation 10:1. And now this mighty angel is descending from heaven and he has in his hand &gt;&gt; the same hand. Hallelujah. And he's holding a book and the book is open. And the prophet said it was a Bible and it's open. The book is open. Your name was in the book. Your life was in the book. He was holding it in his hand. The hand that had scores in it. Now he's descending. And when he's descending the next the next line says and he set one foot &gt;&gt; on the land and he set the other foot on the sea. He set it on the peoples because this is the hour of the revelation of himself and he's saying to his disciples because he was seeking to get them to believe that the resurrection had happened. And as a final proof in the end time, he descends with the open book &gt;&gt; to prove he's resurrected. &gt;&gt; And it was then he said, "Handle me." &gt;&gt; Handle me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And the Apostle John said, "Whom our eyes have seen &gt;&gt; and our hands have handled." He didn't say handled. Jesus of Nazareth, he said, "Handle the word of life." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Touch him. &gt;&gt; Touch him. &gt;&gt; Handle him. &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Handle me." [Applause] &gt;&gt; You say, "It's not just a message. Handle me." It's him. If you can get a revelation of him being here, &gt;&gt; we're touching him. Brother Isaac, &gt;&gt; handle him. &gt;&gt; He's inviting. Handle me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Another woman. &gt;&gt; He was the tree &gt;&gt; that was in Eden. &gt;&gt; Said, "You can't le put their hand forth and touch him." &gt;&gt; They can't do that in that fallen state. But once they've been justified, once they've been redeemed, they can come and touch me. They can handle me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come my brothers and sisters, handle him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Talk to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Kindle the fire &gt;&gt; touch him &gt;&gt; in such a way that the fire can never be extinguished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You won't have to put all your faith in even a camp in a Saturday night. Thank God for it. &gt;&gt; I thank God for it. And may we have many more. &gt;&gt; But the fire that was kindled &gt;&gt; is a reality. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That same one said, "Who touched me?" But then as a proof of his resurrection and to get his people to prove, to get his people to believe abundantly without any question, it's not a spirit. It's me, it's myself. &gt;&gt; I've just changed. I'm in another realm. I'm in another dimension. But the resurrection has happened. &gt;&gt; And to prove it, come and handle me. &gt;&gt; I want to say to this church, &gt;&gt; I want to say to all of you that are streaming, &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; has been given this honor. &gt;&gt; Not to just talk about him, &gt;&gt; not to just repeat what he said, &gt;&gt; not just to say about what he done, but to but you can have a personal acquaintance and experience with him. And he is saying to you, I have never even dreamed of such a subject in my life. I've been pondering it for some weeks. Handle me. &gt;&gt; Handle me. &gt;&gt; I've been singing a song. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I love very dearly. There's people who aren't here in this church. I wish they were here this morning. I feel badly. I'm having my wife come and sing with her daughters. They'll sing it a lot better than I can. Brother Alan King, this was I think became famous in England. Brother Fletcher, if you're here, I touched the heart of God in prayer. I lingered in his presence there. I lost my heavy load of care when in prayer I touched the heart of God. &gt;&gt; They will sing it for you. My wife doesn't like to sing as other people sing and all the rest of it. And I might even try along with them. Please make sure that Where's Michael? I'd asked him to be there. Are you there? Good. Now, this part, you came to church, but this part is my part of the service. I've been wanting my wife to sing this song for years, years. And so I'm having that fulfilled. Brother Mike Gier, I listened to you sing again last night. One of the last things I went to bed listening I'll die believeing. &gt;&gt; That was God that made you sing that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you for your time. [Music] When I was burdened down with care, I knelt with God aart. I stretched my hands to him in prayer and touched his loving heart. I touched the heart of God in prayer. I lingered in his presence there. I lost my heavy load of care. [Music] When in prayer I touched the heart of God. &gt;&gt; His heart is love and tenderness. [Music] He feels the pain we feel.

That you'll have in you a well of everlasting water. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh God. [Music] Father, I thank you for this moment. [Music] &gt;&gt; I wonder, brother Darren Hoffman, if you would come, pray a prayer of blessing upon the people. Brother Murphy is speaking tonight. [Music] I'm anxious to hear what God has to say to us. [Music] How many here have been touched by God in a supernatural way in the last while in the prayer meetings? Brother Kyle is told me the place is full. 60 to 70 people in the prayer meeting. You're invited to come. God bless you. God bless you, brothers, sisters. You're much loved of the father. Brother Darren, if you would come, please. [Music] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, I'm so grateful for the faith of Jesus Christ that you've deposited within the lives of your people, Lord. Father, it doesn't matter whether on the mountaintop, down in the valley, dear God, whether it's the good times, the bad times. Lord God, there's something just pushing up within our hearts, Lord, just to praise you, to worship you, Lord God, to know that your word is real, Lord Jesus. People can say, "Well, how do you know?" Because I've experienced it, Lord. How we have a people that have experienced the presence of Jesus Christ in their individual lives, have experienced the hand of God transforming them from creatures of time to creatures of eternity, Lord. &gt;&gt; And dear God, how we're so thankful, Lord Jesus, that Lord, you've made us different, Lord. And the devil, he's howling, dear God. You're you're making us ready for a rapture, Lord. how that's on our hearts, dear Lord, just to be ready, Lord. And not just ourselves, Father, but for our children, for our loved ones, Lord, to get our family, dear God, into the household of faith, Lord, to have each one of us prepared, Lord Jesus, for that going home time, Lord Jesus, we just remember your people, Lord God, we would you just raise up our faith, dear Lord. We just cast down our doubts, Father. We just put aside the the the the thoughts the devil would try to put into our minds, dear God, to try to doubt us, Lord, but he's nothing but a liar. Every time he opens his mouth, Lord Jesus, he's just lying, Lord. So, Father, this morning, we're standing upon thus sayeth the Lord. We're standing upon a vindicated ministry, Lord Jesus. Lord, that you've sent down this hour with an open book, dear Lord. We've seen our names there, Father. We rejoice, Lord God, because you've redeemed us back to yourself, Lord. There's a marriage supper, dear God, that we've have a a reservation in, Father, that you've invited us personally, dear God. We have a spot, Lord. We have a chair at that table, dear God, where no one else can fit, Lord. We thank you, Lord God, that you've come to each one of us, Lord Jesus. You've given us a word in due season. You've made modern events clear by prophecy, Lord God. Lord, just continue to unveil yourself to us, Lord. Continue to open up our eyes, Lord. Continue to fill us up with revelation, Lord. Lord, that we would not see with our natural eyes. We would look beyond the things of this world, Lord God, the turmoil, Lord, but we would look to the unseen, Father. We would look to the hills from whence cometh our help, Lord. Our help cometh from the Lord God himself. So, Lord Jesus, we're just reaching out to you this morning in faith, dear God. Lord Jesus, just accepting what you've said, Lord, in your word. Accepting what you've brought forth through our pastor this morning, Lord. We are believers, Lord. We're standing on thus saith the Lord. Oh, God. We're rejecting everything this world would try to lure us away with, Lord. All the world, Lord God, would burning the bridges behind us. Father, we're moving on with God. We're going forward, Lord Jesus. We're staggering not at the promises of God, Lord, like our father Abraham. Lord, 25 years he waited for the promise. He staggered not, Lord. But he was strong, Lord God, through faith, Lord Jesus. We're strong through the faith of Jesus Christ, Lord, that you're building up in our lives, dear God. No matter what comes by our way, Lord, nothing can deter us, Lord. Nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus. Oh God, not trials, not tribulations, Lord. Nothing, Lord, God will separate us, Lord. Not one of us will be plucked from your hand, Lord Jesus. So we give you the glory. We give you the honor and the praise, Lord, for you are holy. You are worthy, dear Lord. You are worthy, Lord God. Oh God, take away the formalities, Lord Jesus. Take away the rituals, Lord God. We just want to be free, Lord. Free to be used of God. Free to be a blessing to others, Lord. free to be a witness of the resurrection, Lord, in this hour. Oh, we praise you, Lord God. We bless your holy name. You're worthy of it all, Lord Jesus. We glorify you, Lord. Oh, we thank you, Father. We never want to let this become common to us, Lord. But just let that fus continue to burn within our souls as we press on this way. Lord, go with your people, Father. Give us rest in our bodies, strength, Lord God, to come tonight, Lord Jesus, to hear the word of God once again through brother Murphy. Let us come, Lord, just pulling upon the gift, expecting, Lord, great things, Lord Jesus, because our faith is doing great, Lord. We appreciate you, Lord. We just thank you for answering prayers, Lord. We know the answer is on its way, Lord. So, we're just waiting for it, Father, with great expectation, Lord, to strengthen our dear pastor, Lord. We so thank you for the man of God. We so thank you for a vision, Lord. We thank you for a body, Lord, a body ministry that ministers one to the other. It's just not men behind the pulpit, Lord. Men who labor, Lord. We appreciate that so much. But Lord, you're showing us, Lord, it's a body ministry, Lord. It's teamwork. It's one praying for the other, Lord. It's one pressing on, helping one another, Lord. Each one of us have a part to play, Lord. And so, we just want to walk, Lord Jesus, in the word as you unveil it before us. Go with your people now, Father. We just ask your blessings upon us in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I say this to you that uh I would encourage you to take and read, not just read, let this resurrected one that's present here that sent this message to you. If you take modern events made clear by prophecy and when you open it up, he's in another form. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it is the same Christ. &gt;&gt; The same one that walked with the two men to Emmas will be wherever you are. &gt;&gt; And and and listen, I could say so much. I'm I'm going to let you go. But the two men when you're reading it, the two men, Luke 24, and they they walked with him and talked with him and they got to their house and he even took the he even took the bread and broke it. They didn't say, "Oh, look at the nail scars." &gt;&gt; They weren't there &gt;&gt; in that form. They weren't there. &gt;&gt; That same one who I talked about today, the same one who Brother Brandham declared for 33 years is going to talk to you if you'll believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you'll be able to reach him and touch him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As you hear him speak, And you people, that's what will make this church a different church &gt;&gt; if you realize it's him &gt;&gt; speaking to you. &gt;&gt; And I say to you in the name of the Lord, handle him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Handle him. &gt;&gt; Become attached. &gt;&gt; A fire kindled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do it. You're not too young. You're not too old. God bless you in Jesus name. You're dismissed. We'll see you this evening. God willing. God bless you. [Music]
