[1:15] to another.
[1:18] Oh, give us clean hands.
[1:22] Give us pure hearts.
[1:26] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:32] Oh God, let's be a generation
[1:37] that sees
[1:40] seek your face.
[1:43] Oh God of Jacob.
[1:47] Oh God, let us be a generation
[1:52] that sees.
[1:54] See your face.
[1:57] Oh God of Jacob,
[2:05] praise the Lord.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; Everybody happy to be in the house of
[2:09] the Lord this evening.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's good to be
[2:12] gathered with saints of like precious
[2:14] faith that come hungering, come desiring
[2:16] the word. The scripture reminds us if
[2:19] you come hungry, if you come thirsting,
[2:22] he's more than able, more than happy to
[2:25] give us all that we're able and more
[2:27] than we can receive. Amen. Why don't we
[2:29] turn the screen on to number uh 582.
[2:34] [Music]
[2:37] Start the song service with I would not
[2:39] be denied.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; Many times we see in the scripture,
[2:42] somebody wanted something, somebody
[2:43] wanted something, they wouldn't be
[2:45] denied. Amen.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; So they kept pressing. We're going to
[2:49] press on tonight.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want the presence of the Lord
[2:52] to sweep down over the congregation. How
[2:56] many times the prophet says, "Now, we'll
[2:58] just wait on the Lord." Here he comes
[2:59] around. Can you see him coming around
[3:01] the back? It's not bad sitting in the
[3:03] back. It's for those of you that have to
[3:05] sit in the back with little children. I
[3:07] enjoy it back there because I know I
[3:08] asked the Lord the end of the service
[3:11] from my heart. I say, "Lord, as soon as
[3:13] you get here, before somebody else asks,
[3:16] I have a need." And many times he comes
[3:19] right right around that area. Many come
[3:22] to the front. I can't always get to the
[3:25] front. I'm in the back first. So, we
[3:28] just take our position, our post of duty
[3:29] where we are. Say, "Lord, deal with me
[3:31] tonight wherever we are." Amen. When
[3:35] pains of death seized over my soul, unto
[3:40] the Lord I cried.
[3:43] Till Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[3:48] would not be denied. Well, I would not
[3:53] be denied.
[3:55] I would not be
[3:59] Jesus.
[4:03] I would not be
[4:07] as fle in the days old. I wrestled with
[4:13] the Lord
[4:15] and he s with the
[4:19] I should
[4:22] well I could not be
[4:27] I would not be
[4:30] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[4:35] would not be
[4:38] old Satan said my Lord was
[4:43] not hear my prayer but praise the Lord
[4:48] the work is done and Christ our Lord is
[4:52] here where I would not be
[4:58] [Applause]
[5:01] till Jesus Hey,
[5:09] I would not be
[5:11] [Music]
[5:13] [Applause]
[5:17] [Music]
[5:22] Why don't we just sing it again? I would
[5:24] not be
[5:27] I would not be
[5:31] if Jesus came and
[5:35] I would not be.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; I think we need to sing that last verse
[5:40] of God again.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; Satan said the Lord was gone,
[5:45] &gt;&gt; but he is here.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Jeremy and a couple of brothers
[5:48] have a song for us. So maybe we'll just
[5:50] sing this a time or two again while
[5:52] they're coming and getting ready. Old
[5:54] Satan said my Lord was gone. He will not
[5:59] hear my prayer but praise the Lord. The
[6:04] work is done and Christ our Lord is
[6:07] here.
[6:09] I would not be
[6:13] willing.
[6:20] [Music]
[6:31] If Jesus came and made me
[6:37] once again I could not be
[6:42] I could not be
[6:46] till Jesus came and made me.
[6:52] [Music]
[6:54] Amen. God bless you. May have your seats
[6:56] tonight.
[7:25] There was a time on earth when In the
[7:29] books of heaven, that an old account was
[7:33] standing for sins yet unforgiven.
[7:37] My name was at the top with many things
[7:41] below. But I went unto the keeper. And I
[7:45] settled it long ago. Long ago.
[7:50] Long ago. I said long. Yes. The old
[7:54] account was settled long ago.
[7:59] And the record's clear today, for he
[8:02] washed my sins away. Yes, the old
[8:05] account was settled long ago.
[8:10] Well, the old account was large and
[8:13] growing every day. For I was always
[8:17] sinning, and I never tried to pray. But
[8:21] when I looked ahead and saw such pain
[8:25] and war, I thought I'd better settle.
[8:29] And I settled it long ago. Long ago on
[8:33] my knees long ago. I settled it all.
[8:37] Yes. The old account was settled long
[8:40] ago.
[8:42] And the records clear today for he
[8:45] washed my sins away. Yes, the old
[8:49] account was settled long ago.
[8:53] Now sinners, seek the Lord. Repent of
[8:57] all your sins. For thus he has
[9:00] commanded. If you would enter in and if
[9:05] you should live
[9:07] 100 years below, you know you got it
[9:11] settled cuz you settled it long ago.
[9:14] Long ago. down on my knees long ago. I
[9:18] settled it all. Yes, the old account was
[9:22] settled long ago.
[9:25] And the records clear today for he
[9:28] washed my sins away. Yes, the old
[9:31] account was settled long ago.
[9:36] Long ago,
[9:37] &gt;&gt; down on my knees.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Long ago,
[9:40] &gt;&gt; I settled. Yes. The old account was
[9:43] settled long ago
[9:47] and the records clear today. For he
[9:50] washed my sins away. Yes. The old
[9:54] account was settled long ago.
[9:58] Long ago.
[10:01] Long ago. I settled it all. Yes. The old
[10:04] account was settled long ago.
[10:09] And the record's clear today. For he
[10:12] washed my sins away. Yes, the old
[10:15] account was settled long ago.
[10:19] And the records clear today for he
[10:23] washed my sins away. Yes, the old
[10:26] account was settled long ago.
[10:30] Long ago.
[10:40] Well, these guys are singing pretty
[10:42] good, aren't they?
[10:43] &gt;&gt; I think we should maybe have them help
[10:45] me sing a song.
[10:48] That's a good idea. When you got good
[10:49] singers, you don't really relinquish
[10:50] them very quickly. Okay. So, you won't
[10:53] hold me for holding them. All right.
[10:55] Number 381 on the screen. Undefiled.
[10:58] That's what we're That's what we're
[11:00] singing about. Pure, clean lives. Amen.
[11:05] Only the sword of the word cut away sin
[11:07] in our lives. And that's our desire.
[11:09] Amen. Why don't we just sing this
[11:11] together as we get ready to turn the
[11:12] service to brother Bisl.
[11:15] [Music]
[11:17] Undefiled,
[11:21] real pure life.

[13:38] Amen.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Sound of victory in the camp.
[13:43] [Applause]
[13:45] listening to the brothers sing the song
[13:48] and I couldn't help but think it's a
[13:51] wonderful thing when we are able to make
[13:53] the last payment
[13:55] on anything we owe.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; You've had that experience. Make the
[13:59] last payment. I'm free. I'm done.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; Well, when we look at Calvary, that was
[14:04] the last payment.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. The last
[14:10] payment.
[14:12] Amen.
[14:14] and he paid it all.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; We're going to have prayer and I just
[14:19] wanted to take just a moment before we
[14:23] uh go into prayer. We want to be
[14:24] remembering our brother Edwin Dods again
[14:27] this evening and the Dods family. And I
[14:30] need to make an announcement that the
[14:33] hospital staff and the family uh are
[14:37] have said that there can be no visitors,
[14:40] just the immediate family. So even
[14:43] though you're a good friend and you've
[14:44] been there before and and all the rest
[14:46] of it and you're you know the ropes and
[14:49] all, but uh the I just got that call
[14:51] before I left and they don't wish to
[14:53] have any visitors at all. It's just the
[14:55] immediate family and and I can certainly
[14:58] understand that. I I've I've never been
[15:01] uh in the place where brother Edwin Dods
[15:03] is, but even if I get feeling not well,
[15:07] I don't want to see anybody. I just want
[15:08] to lay there comeosse and let the
[15:11] healing take place in my body and just
[15:13] have rest. But but he's in a condition
[15:16] where he needs complete rest. So I know
[15:19] that you will respect that. And I would
[15:21] say rather than even visit, I've been
[15:24] there once, but rather than visit, I
[15:26] would take that time and get on my face
[15:28] before God and hold him up in prayer.
[15:31] And he'll do far more for them than for
[15:33] visiting. So, God bless you. As as we
[15:36] remember, and I told them we would be
[15:37] holding him up in prayer. They were uh
[15:40] trying to get u uh a food a tube in so
[15:44] they could feed him. And they have now
[15:47] uh done that because he needed to be
[15:49] fed. So, we want to be praying for our
[15:52] brother Edwin Dodds. They all the CAT
[15:54] scans have showed that the bleeding has
[15:56] stopped and we're praising the Lord for
[15:59] that. Hallelujah.
[16:02] Uh, Brother Lance's uh mom was uh
[16:05] admitted to the hospital today and just
[16:08] for some observation and some to have
[16:12] have some uh check. Uh so I'd like uh he
[16:16] asked that we would remember his mom in
[16:17] prayer, our sister Dorothy Laroo. And I
[16:20] have these please remember uh me in
[16:23] prayer as I have a severe respiratory
[16:26] infection and I'm in need of healing
[16:29] healing touch and I have another urgent
[16:32] uh request at this time and and Lisa
[16:37] Sister Lisa St. John and she's at home
[16:40] not well and streaming the service. So,
[16:42] Sister Lisa, we're praying for you. So,
[16:45] let's just all come before the Lord in
[16:47] in prayer and and know that he cares for
[16:50] us and he cares for these that we're
[16:52] praying for. Heavenly Father,
[16:54] oh, how wonderful that we can come to
[16:57] you praying to the living God, the only
[17:02] true and living God. We're not praying
[17:05] or bowing before some stone statue or
[17:08] we're not holding some metal in our hand
[17:10] or some icon. Oh God, we have the God of
[17:14] Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of
[17:18] Jacob, the God of the prophets, the God
[17:20] of William Brham, the God of the
[17:22] apostles. Lord Jesus, we are coming in
[17:26] your name. And we know that that name is
[17:28] the name that's above every name. And it
[17:31] was you, Lord Jesus, that went to
[17:32] Calvary. It was you that cried out, "It
[17:35] is finished from those lips." Oh God,
[17:39] how grateful we are today for the great
[17:42] price that was paid. And how how
[17:45] willing, Lord Jesus, you were to give
[17:47] yourself freely for your body, for your
[17:50] people, for your elect, and whom for the
[17:52] joy that was set before you. And now
[17:55] this evening, Lord, as we've gathered
[17:56] here, this is the hour of prayer. This
[17:59] is a time that we are remembering, Lord
[18:02] Jesus, these sick and needy ones, our
[18:04] sister Lisa St. John. Lord, pray you'll
[18:07] raise her up. Rebuke the enemy, oh God.
[18:10] Her faith and confidence is in you, our
[18:11] brother Edwin Dods. Lord, what a lovely
[18:14] spirit. What a witness. Oh God, what a
[18:16] soldier he's been. Not for the US uh Air
[18:20] Force, but for you, oh God. Oh, Father.
[18:23] And he'll fly higher than a Air Force
[18:25] ever took him. Oh, God. Oh, God. What a
[18:29] promise we have that we'll be caught up
[18:31] together with those resurrected ones.
[18:34] Pray that you'll raise them up, Lord.
[18:35] Thank you for causing this bleeding to
[18:38] cease. Strengthen the family, Lord.
[18:40] Inspire them with faith, oh God. And may
[18:43] our our faith now reach out to you, dear
[18:45] Lord. Brother Lance's mom, Lord. Pray
[18:48] for our sister Dorothy, how you healed
[18:50] her so many years ago from that
[18:52] arthritis and and from that kidney
[18:54] stone. Lord, how faithful you've been.
[18:56] Touch her body tonight. We pray let her
[18:59] know that the ever never failing
[19:01] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[19:03] beside her. And for the service now and
[19:05] all that will be said and done, we do it
[19:07] for your glory in the name of Jesus
[19:09] Christ. Amen.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[19:16] Now I'm going to speak in a few minutes
[19:18] but just before we do going to let you
[19:21] uh be blessed by what has been taking
[19:25] place and just a small area perhaps in
[19:27] Mexico but brother Jake Dick has some
[19:30] pictures and he has made several trips
[19:32] down to Mexico where they lived the
[19:35] family and so I don't want to take any
[19:37] more time. He's going to take about 15
[19:40] minutes and show you some pictures and
[19:42] just tell you about a little bit about
[19:44] what God is doing down there. So,
[19:46] Brother Jake, come.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just thankful for
[19:50] individuals that just feel a burden on
[19:52] their heart and say, "I want to be a
[19:53] witness. Here I go." God bless you,
[19:55] Brother Jake. Amen.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Saints, good to be here tonight.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Enjoy the service.
[20:06] Little hard for me to stand up here, but
[20:08] anyway, we'll do our part. Just give a
[20:10] little report. First of all, I want to
[20:11] give you greetings from some of the
[20:13] different places I visited. I went down
[20:16] to Mterrey,
[20:18] Mexico. And uh actually, I flew down to
[20:22] to El Paso, Texas, and met with a
[20:25] brother down there, Brother Ruben
[20:28] Rivera. He's just across the line down
[20:30] in uh Sodad Huades which is Mexico right
[20:35] across the border. Uh from there I flew
[20:38] down or uh went with my uncle into Texas
[20:41] and he sends greetings also my uncle Abe
[20:44] Dyke and uh then I went down to Mterrey
[20:50] and from there
[20:53] actually took a bus down to Mont uh
[20:56] Laredo Texas and the brother from
[20:58] Mterrey came and picked me up and from
[21:01] there we spent some time with them down
[21:03] there the believers and from there We
[21:06] went down to uh
[21:09] uh
[21:11] we traveled around a little further
[21:13] south. We went down into the interior
[21:15] further down to Tamolipas. I'll just
[21:18] show show some of these pictures just
[21:21] shortly.
[21:22] But uh we had a wonderful time with the
[21:25] believers and they all sent greetings
[21:28] and their love. So,
[21:30] uh,
[21:35] we're very much interested in what God
[21:38] is doing,
[21:39] &gt;&gt; you know, through the Spanish. And my
[21:41] burden's been, uh, briefly for the
[21:44] Menites, like my people, where we came
[21:47] from. I've been really burdened. I've
[21:50] been thinking through the years, you
[21:51] know, there's never been a a real
[21:53] witness among those, the Menanites. and
[21:56] it's been on my heart and thinking
[21:59] knowing that I know the language
[22:02] I wonder is there anybody else can do
[22:04] something down there and I've been
[22:06] looking searching nobody seems to have
[22:08] any outreach in that direction so it's
[22:11] been on my heart so I've tried to do
[22:13] what I can just to reach out to the
[22:16] different colonies and I'll just go
[22:18] through some of them and I was able to
[22:20] visit some at this time so I'll just go
[22:23] to these pictures Now,
[22:26] um,
[22:30] this is, uh, let me just see. Okay, here
[22:34] you see Mexico.
[22:36] And, uh, I'll just take a quick moment
[22:39] to show where I was at. Let me just see
[22:41] if I can figure this thing out.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[22:48] there's El Paso, Texas.
[22:52] I went from there
[22:54] down to Hobbes, New Mexico
[22:59] and Semino, Texas. That's where my uncle
[23:02] lives. I've got some uncles there. From
[23:05] there, we went down to all the way to
[23:08] Laredo, Texas.
[23:11] You can see that there.
[23:14] From there, a pastor picked us up and we
[23:17] went down to Mter Reay and then traveled
[23:20] further south to Victoria and in that
[23:23] area. So there's Mexico. Here's the
[23:28] brother from u just across the border
[23:31] from El Paso, Texas. This is brother
[23:34] Rubeno Rivera. I've met with him before
[23:39] and uh my uncle took me down there. We
[23:42] spent an evening with them. Took a
[23:44] service in down there. Here's Mterrey.
[23:47] You can see it's uh third largest city
[23:51] in Mexico. Population is 1.1 million and
[23:55] the area metropolitan area has about 3.8
[23:58] million people. So you can see it's very
[24:00] large. There's about five different
[24:02] message churches in there. About three
[24:04] of them fellowship together. and uh
[24:07] consists of seven big cities and then a
[24:12] number of smaller cities. This is uh
[24:16] Bible way Christian Academy launched on
[24:18] an endeavor to raise funds for a print
[24:21] station in Montterrey Novel, Mexico. And
[24:25] uh we were there, we were able to spend
[24:28] some time with some of the believers
[24:30] there, fellowship with them, and uh we
[24:33] were able to get quite a few over a
[24:36] hundred
[24:38] uh files, message files in Spanish from
[24:40] him.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; So those are now up on the web. And it's
[24:45] very interesting what God is doing
[24:47] there. And it's just been a real burden
[24:49] of my heart just to get as much into the
[24:51] Spanish language as possible. Not only
[24:54] the German, I've been burdened for them,
[24:57] but the different travels that I've been
[24:59] there, the different times I've gotten
[25:02] to know the believers in Mexico,
[25:04] different places. So, we've done what we
[25:07] can. Now, we working as much as we can
[25:10] to get the messages on the hub. So,
[25:15] this is brother Estraa. He's the pastor
[25:18] from the church in Mterrey. He's
[25:21] associated with about another three
[25:23] different churches. They're in close
[25:24] fellowship down there.
[25:27] Um there's may he asked me to minister
[25:30] for them.
[25:32] There's the church. Another picture of
[25:34] the church. They've got about uh 70 or
[25:37] 80 people. There's some of the children.
[25:41] There's the building from the outside.
[25:44] They've the top area is like a little
[25:47] fellowship room. On the bottom they have
[25:49] uh a few extra rooms. And there you see
[25:53] they have a hallway going up to the top
[25:55] which is the sanctuary. There's a
[25:57] sanctuary right at the top. Here's some
[26:00] of the uh young people and the three
[26:03] different pastors that are
[26:07] uh just point them out to you.
[26:14] That's brother Estraa.
[26:17] This is brother Adula Mata. He is from
[26:20] uh El Paso, Texas. He's a pastor there.
[26:23] He's probably got about 70 or 80 people
[26:25] also.
[26:27] That is brother David DeLeon.
[26:30] He's all he's from Saltio, which is a
[26:34] little further west of uh Montterrey
[26:37] down there.
[26:39] He also has about 70 people, I believe,
[26:42] or 80 people. There's some of the
[26:44] brothers uh that were at Mterrey. I must
[26:50] uh point out this one brother.
[26:53] Sorry, I hit the wrong button.
[26:58] Okay, this brother down here that is
[27:01] brother Sebastian of Vieo. He is from
[27:05] San Louis Pisi. San Louis Pi is the
[27:09] capital city of San Louis Pi. is a
[27:12] little further uh just one sec.
[27:17] Okay,
[27:19] I don't have the map. He's from further
[27:22] south
[27:24] and he's he's uh got a little church
[27:26] down there also and he's very burdened
[27:28] for some of the native Indians down
[27:30] there and he goes down travels to
[27:32] missions and he was very interested in
[27:35] the the Prince Station also and it just
[27:38] been very burdened to get something like
[27:40] that to him. He uh he travels to La La
[27:45] Lasta
[27:47] which is uh on the east side. It's a big
[27:50] region. There's a lot of natives down
[27:52] there.
[27:55] Okay, here I'm heading south. I stopped
[27:57] at about 2 hours south of uh Mterrey in
[28:03] a little town called
[28:06] uh Viagran Tamo Lipas
[28:10] and it's it's circled down there. Of
[28:12] course, this is brother Domingo. Uh he's
[28:15] from Vagran.
[28:17] and brother Eduardo. He's the brother
[28:19] that took me around to many different
[28:22] places. He's actually a son-in-law to
[28:25] brother Estrea. Here's the family of
[28:28] brother Domingo,
[28:30] his wife and three children.
[28:34] And then we traveled further south uh to
[28:38] Santa and Gracia, a very tiny town. And
[28:42] that's just outside of uh Victoria. Sead
[28:47] Victoria. It's called City of Victoria.
[28:51] Oh, sorry. Not quite used to this thing.
[28:55] Here's Victoria down here. And there's
[28:58] Santa and Gracia.
[29:00] There's
[29:01] there's many different believers. I'm
[29:03] just going to say there's there's many
[29:04] different believers. just tiny little
[29:07] groups scattered out all over the
[29:09] different places and they don't have
[29:10] much fellowship. They don't have much
[29:13] they're very poor people and uh they
[29:18] they need they need the message, they
[29:20] need the books, they need everything
[29:22] they can get. So here's sorry here's the
[29:25] uh a brother I think they're called the
[29:29] Zuniga family.
[29:32] I'm not sure if I said that right.
[29:35] Anyway, here's their place
[29:39] here. We're visiting with them. We
[29:41] traveled further down to Victoria
[29:46] and
[29:47] Ecotanka
[29:49] and Estasion Gonzalez. The
[29:52] pronunciation's a little different, I'm
[29:53] sure, but it's in Spanish. Victoria,
[29:56] Sead, Victoria is quite a big city,
[30:00] and uh I was trying to find some of the
[30:03] Menites around there. Many times what I
[30:05] do, I'll travel to different places when
[30:08] I know there's Menites around and u I'll
[30:12] just search for them, start to make an
[30:15] introduction if I find somebody like
[30:17] this fell down here.
[30:21] He's a Menite in Victoria. So I was able
[30:25] to contact him through some of the
[30:27] people in the area there and ask him
[30:29] where the colony is and how to get
[30:31] there. So, he gave us directions and
[30:35] also I gave him some books and he was
[30:37] very receptive. So, we're just waiting
[30:40] to see what God is doing there.
[30:43] Uh there you can see about three young
[30:46] Menite boys there in the uh that's down
[30:49] in Gonzalez.
[30:52] I was able to witness to them. I was at
[30:55] a little store, stopped by a little
[30:56] store in the colony there and spoke to
[30:59] them and uh they're happy to receive
[31:02] some message books. They never heard of
[31:04] what God has done in this hour. The
[31:06] colonies, they're so so isolated. They
[31:09] don't want anything strange, any
[31:11] doctrines to come in. But uh some of the
[31:14] people are very hungry for the things of
[31:16] God. So
[31:18] here's uh another brother. Uh
[31:22] this brother in the green checkered
[31:25] shirt,
[31:29] this brother, that's brother uh Romero
[31:32] Nava. He's from Eotena. He's uh he's
[31:36] actually in charge of the little group
[31:38] down there. And uh
[31:45] this fell is Henry Penner and this is
[31:47] David Penner. They're Menites. He's
[31:50] fluent in German and Spanish. No
[31:53] English. He's fluent in English, German,
[31:56] and Spanish. Now, this contact, I was
[31:58] able to make this contact just about
[32:01] three or four weeks before I left
[32:05] from here and uh a fellow from from uh
[32:11] Vanderhof, BC.
[32:14] uh he came and visited my dad which he
[32:16] was a f friend a boy childhood friend of
[32:20] my dad's and when I spoke to them we
[32:23] were speaking together and his spoke to
[32:24] his wife and I mentioned I was heading
[32:26] that direction so his wife just
[32:28] mentioned that she has a brother down
[32:30] there so he gave me she gave me the
[32:32] contact and that's how I was able to
[32:34] make contact down there and he we had a
[32:36] wonderful time around the word with him
[32:39] we spent a lot of time and probably
[32:41] about an hour and a half or
[32:44] and uh gave him some books and right now
[32:46] they're reading the books. His son is
[32:48] reading the books and we're in just in
[32:51] contact right now.
[32:53] Uh this is uh brother Romero's wife and
[32:58] children.
[33:00] I just uh
[33:03] that's his wife and son and two
[33:06] daughters.
[33:08] And this is another brother Alfredo
[33:11] Perez. He's also he's from Mterrey. He
[33:14] traveled with me going down to the
[33:16] colony there and the different we
[33:18] visited the different believers there.
[33:21] So then I went back traveled back to
[33:25] Mterrey
[33:27] from there and then brother Estraa asked
[33:29] me to go visit another church brother
[33:31] David DeLeon
[33:33] which I did and he's in Salio which is
[33:37] uh right down here this fairsiz city now
[33:42] crossing
[33:44] Mterrey we're down in Apodaka it was
[33:47] about an hour and a half to cross the
[33:49] city And from Santa Katrina from there
[33:54] all to all the way to Saltio is only
[33:56] about 45 minutes. That gives you how
[33:58] busy this an idea how busy the city is.
[34:02] So we travel down there to Saltio. This
[34:05] is the church. They've taken a garage, a
[34:08] shop
[34:09] uh and just gutted it out and just
[34:12] transformed it into a church.
[34:15] So there's myself speaking again in
[34:18] brother David DeLeon. He's perfect in
[34:22] translation. He's he's very fluent in
[34:24] English. So he's uh called a number of
[34:27] times. He's invited you, brother Ed, to
[34:29] come down and he's invited us back
[34:32] again. And he's just a wonderful group
[34:36] of people. There's the church. It's not
[34:39] very full this time, but I think 70 80
[34:42] people. Here's the children.
[34:44] some of the brothers,
[34:46] some of the sisters, and then some of
[34:48] the young people. From there, we headed
[34:52] back to Texas, El Paso, Texas.
[34:56] And uh incidentally, I might just
[34:59] mention my family, our family, we've uh
[35:02] I wasn't able to visit my relatives this
[35:05] time. They are from uh if you see El
[35:08] Paso, Texas here. If you go down to
[35:12] Chihuahua, that's where my family was
[35:15] raised in Kok, that's where most of them
[35:18] were born. My family knows all about
[35:21] this. And there's in this surrounding
[35:24] area called Chihuahua. I was searching
[35:28] it up a little while ago. There's more
[35:30] than 50,000 Menites
[35:33] that are uh scattered in different
[35:35] colonies down there. And I've been there
[35:38] quite a few times, been very burdened,
[35:40] and I wasn't able to reach them at this
[35:42] time. But uh a lot of them have turned
[35:45] to the world. they've turned to drugs,
[35:48] you know, because they have no
[35:49] satisfying, nothing satisfying from the
[35:52] system. So, I've been very burdened to
[35:55] get back to them. There's quite a few
[35:56] contacts I have there, but the Lord just
[35:59] didn't allow it at this time, but we'll
[36:01] go back soon, Lord willing. So, anyway,
[36:04] we traveled back to El Paso, Texas. Uh
[36:07] met with uh brother Adula Mata. He's the
[36:11] pastor of a little church there. And
[36:14] then back to Seminal, Texas, which is
[36:17] there's my uncle Abe and my aunt Mary,
[36:21] real believers. And there's my uncle
[36:24] Jake and aunt Mary. They uh they just
[36:27] got baptized in the last six, eight
[36:29] months. And that was a result of the
[36:32] crossing over my sister Mary. They came
[36:35] down here and we've went back and
[36:37] testified many times to them. But now it
[36:40] finally came to a point where they when
[36:43] they came to see the people the lives
[36:46] something anchored down in their hearts.
[36:48] So first he got got baptized he said
[36:52] when he left this place something
[36:55] something happened. He couldn't could
[36:57] never be the same.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; So and then three or four months later
[37:02] his wife came to the same revelation. So
[37:06] &gt;&gt; that's what uh just in brief what God is
[37:10] doing down there and the opportunities
[37:12] that I had. I don't want to take any
[37:14] more time. Come here to hear the word
[37:17] and that's what I want to hear tonight.
[37:18] God bless y'all.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; I think we'll have to appoint Brother
[37:31] Jake as the official report giver. I
[37:34] think he did great. Don't you?
[37:36] &gt;&gt; That's a lot to pack in. Uh, all right.
[37:40] Who's ever on the lights?
[37:43] Let's stay with the program.
[37:48] Amen. I'll have you stand and we're
[37:49] going to turn in the scriptures to First
[37:52] John.
[37:53] I'm going to read out of uh 1 John the 1
[37:57] chapter
[38:02] and we'll start with uh verse one. But
[38:05] just before we do, we'll just once again
[38:08] thank God for the
[38:11] I thank God for what he's doing for the
[38:13] report.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; That's a good report.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; And brother Jake has has reward.
[38:20] Hallelujah. Stars in his crown. I
[38:22] believe that. Dear heavenly father, once
[38:25] again, we're just bowing respectfully,
[38:28] reverently, sincerely, and humbly before
[38:31] you. We know that man can do nothing.
[38:35] We're fully dependent upon you. And we
[38:38] pray, oh God, you'll bless the continued
[38:40] labors of our brother Jake, all of the
[38:43] pastors that are scattered there
[38:45] throughout Mexico where he was. Well, I
[38:48] pray that they'll be strengthened and
[38:49] encouraged, Lord, that they'll be
[38:51] blessed by having access to the message.
[38:55] And we thank you, dear Father, for the
[38:57] laborers, the translators, and all that
[38:59] are working. And just pray you'll bless
[39:02] them, Lord. Bless the congregations, the
[39:04] young people, and all the saints that
[39:06] are there, Lord, and the endeavor to get
[39:09] the message into the Menanite colonies.
[39:12] And now, Father, for us standing here
[39:14] today and all that are streaming, bless
[39:17] the service. I pray the word and I pray
[39:20] that the your words, Lord, will be in my
[39:22] lips and that you'll take control, Lord.
[39:25] I've give you my lips. I give you my
[39:26] tongue. I give you my body, Father. Each
[39:30] one of us are wanting to say the same
[39:31] thing. Here we are, Lord, to be temples
[39:34] of the Holy Ghost. the name of Jesus
[39:36] Christ. Oh spirit of God, have full
[39:39] control and preeminence for your glory
[39:41] and the glory of the name of Jesus
[39:43] Christ. Amen.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:48] Starting with verse one, John the 1
[39:50] chapter 1 John. That which was from the
[39:54] beginning, which we have heard, which we
[39:57] have seen with our eyes, which we have
[39:59] looked upon and our hands have handled
[40:02] of the word of life. And the life was
[40:04] manifested, and we have seen it, and
[40:07] bear witness, and show unto you that
[40:10] eternal life, which was with the Father,
[40:12] and was manifested unto us. That which
[40:16] we have seen and heard, declare we unto
[40:18] you, that you also uh have fellowship
[40:22] with us. And truly our fellowship is
[40:25] with the Father, and with his son, Jesus
[40:27] Christ. And these things write we unto
[40:30] you, that your joy may be full. This
[40:33] then is the message which we have heard
[40:35] of him and declare unto you that God is
[40:38] light and in him is no darkness at all.
[40:42] If we say that we have fellowship with
[40:44] him and walk in darkness, we lie and do
[40:47] not the truth. But if we walk in the
[40:49] light as he is in the light, we have
[40:52] fellowship one with another and the
[40:54] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth
[40:57] us from all sin. Hallelujah.
[41:02] What a wonderful line to close on. You
[41:04] may be seated.
[41:07] I want to just take and uh advance from
[41:10] Sunday morning if I uh can by the help
[41:15] of the Holy Spirit on this uh subject
[41:18] which I began uh what seeest thou. So
[41:22] we'll be on what seeest thou uh part two
[41:26] and uh the um my object object in the in
[41:31] these services and with a thought that
[41:34] God has laid on my heart is that we
[41:38] might change
[41:40] if we need to how we see things, how we
[41:44] look upon things and how we see them.
[41:48] And the objective of that is that we
[41:52] might, my objective is to help you and
[41:56] help this congregation, help all who may
[41:58] hear this service that they might
[42:00] actually see Jesus Christ, the person in
[42:05] the message of the hour.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that that's quite a
[42:10] quite a challenge. If we had walked with
[42:13] Jesus, if you had walked with him
[42:17] when he was here on earth, you would
[42:20] have had to look past his humanity,
[42:25] past his weariness,
[42:28] past his uh clothing,
[42:32] past what you knew about his upbringing,
[42:35] his father and his mother as the people
[42:38] perceived it, even though we know Joseph
[42:41] wasn't his father. But we would have to
[42:43] look beyond that. And I can tell you as
[42:47] far for my part, that would have been a
[42:50] greater challenge than to see him in the
[42:52] word today.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; To look past his humanity.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; And if if you don't think that's a
[42:58] challenge, just look at the person next
[43:00] to you. Or if you don't think that's a
[43:03] challenge, go home and look in the
[43:05] mirror
[43:06] &gt;&gt; and try and see this Jesus Christ that
[43:10] I'm speaking about tonight.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; I just want to know that you're on the
[43:15] same page with me to look past his
[43:18] garment, past his humanity, past his
[43:20] past his weaknesses, past his hunger,
[43:23] past all of these things. And the
[43:26] scripture says he was tempted in all
[43:29] points
[43:30] &gt;&gt; like we are. So you'd see him in
[43:33] temptation. You might perceive he's
[43:36] being tempted. That didn't change
[43:38] anything. He was the son of the living
[43:41] God in a human vessel. And he was not
[43:44] what we would have perceived him to be.
[43:47] And that is why so many multitudes
[43:49] didn't see him and who he was.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; God in the flesh.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. the sacrifice, the son of God.
[43:58] In the message, Jehovah Gyra,
[44:02] brother Bram speaks about the 70
[44:04] ordained ministers sitting there. He'd
[44:07] sent them out, 70 of them. He said,
[44:10] "What will you say when you see the Son
[44:12] of Man ascending up into heaven from
[44:14] whence he came?" Now, he never explained
[44:17] it. He said, "What will you say when you
[44:19] see the Son of Man ascend up into heaven
[44:22] from whence he came?" And those
[44:24] preachers said, "This man ascending up
[44:26] into heaven from where he came. Why? We
[44:30] know him.
[44:32] We know his mother.
[44:34] We've seen the stable where he was born.
[44:38] We've seen the cradle. He was rocked
[44:40] dead. We fished with him. We laid on the
[44:43] bank here on the banks with him. And
[44:47] this son of man ascend up from whence he
[44:50] came. He came from Bethlehem.
[44:53] Where's this coming up? Uh that's too
[44:56] much for us. And they walked away from
[44:58] him. And then when Jesus asked uh the
[45:01] disciples and Peter said those great
[45:03] words, he brother Brandham is speaking
[45:05] now. To whom would we go Lord for we are
[45:09] sure that that thou hast the word of
[45:12] life? They had seen it so clearly a
[45:16] vindicated. That's what they saw. The
[45:20] others saw the stable. We fished. We
[45:23] laid on the bank. We know his parents.
[45:26] We know where he lived. We know all of
[45:28] that. And so I I'm I'm putting it this
[45:31] way. Familiarity
[45:33] blinded them.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; And none of us are immune to
[45:37] familiarity.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; We're We get too familiar with one
[45:41] another. We get too familiar with the
[45:44] ministry. We get too familiar with the
[45:46] deacons or the trustees or our husband
[45:48] or our wife. We say, "Wow, it's my
[45:51] husband, my wife." But there's a there's
[45:53] a a a a channel where we must not get
[45:56] just so familiar that we lose respect.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; So, these were the words they used. We
[46:04] know him. We've seen the stable. We've
[46:07] seen the cradle. We fished with him.
[46:10] We've laid on the banks with him. And
[46:13] those very phrases blinded them.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Shall I say that again?
[46:21] &gt;&gt; The familiarity
[46:23] blinded him. And I can take it from a
[46:26] whole another direction. I'm going to do
[46:27] it. Brother Brandham talks and he talks
[46:29] about many places where it just got too
[46:32] common to the people.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; You could say, well, they were missing
[46:36] it completely. The stable and so on and
[46:39] so forth. Listen, there are some people
[46:41] that they just get wrapped up with
[46:42] Sunset Mountain and with Sabina Canyon
[46:45] and and the other spots and the places
[46:47] and the First Pull and what he did in
[46:49] Edmonton or what he did in Saskatoon or
[46:52] what he did in Phoenix and and and all
[46:54] of those things. Those things by
[46:56] themselves can just blind the individual
[47:01] &gt;&gt; to the Christ who's seeking to reveal
[47:04] himself through that ministry.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; So, you're with me? Amen.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; So familiarity, we know the phrase
[47:12] familiarity breeds contempt. And of
[47:15] course we have an understanding for
[47:17] contempt that it's disdain and so on and
[47:20] such rejection. But contempt also also
[47:24] has the meaning to to dislike
[47:27] or disapproval
[47:30] or disrespect.
[47:32] And I can tell you there are hundreds of
[47:34] thousands out there that disliked what
[47:37] this prophet was saying and disrespected
[47:40] what he said and disrespected him for
[47:44] his office and they didn't they didn't
[47:46] approve of what he was saying and they
[47:49] missed the Christ.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; They didn't see Christ.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[47:59] in the message door inside of a door. He
[48:01] said, "You say, Lord, I have watched it,
[48:05] but tonight maybe it's been too common
[48:08] for me. Maybe tonight, Lord, if you'll
[48:11] just open my eyes of understanding and
[48:14] anoint my eyes with spiritual sight, let
[48:17] me, Lord, see your presence tonight and
[48:20] know and understand that I'm living just
[48:23] before the world meets its end."
[48:26] I say here tonight, this Wednesday
[48:27] night, that's exactly what we need to
[48:29] pray.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, don't let this be too common for
[48:33] me.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Don't let it be that I've heard it and
[48:35] I've heard these quotes. I've heard
[48:36] these statements or we've read it. We've
[48:39] done it before. We've been here so many,
[48:40] many times. I've come here for so many
[48:42] years. But never let it become so common
[48:45] to us that we miss the Christ that's
[48:48] seeking to speak to us and to see us uh
[48:52] to to take us beyond.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; The suit of clothes
[48:59] &gt;&gt; or who we are and the little things.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Let us go. We should go way beyond that.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; It's too hot. It's too cold. It's too
[49:11] this. It's too that.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; It's too long. It's too short.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; It's too loud. It's too quiet.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, come friends.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; We need to go way beyond that.
[49:24] Christ is here.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; That's what we're If it's If he's not
[49:31] here, we all should pack up. I'll just
[49:33] say a closing prayer and we'll go home.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; But if Christ is here, I want to see
[49:37] him. Don't you?
[49:39] &gt;&gt; I want to ask him, what do you want to
[49:41] do, Lord?
[49:42] &gt;&gt; How can you get receive more glory
[49:49] &gt;&gt; in Christ outside the door?
[49:52] Now, Brother Brennan was speaking to a
[49:53] lot of Pentecostal people at that time.
[49:55] He said, "And that's what's the matter
[49:56] with the Pentecostal church, but don't
[49:59] forget, he wasn't he wasn't chastising
[50:03] them for being what they were. He was
[50:07] chastising them for having allowed
[50:10] themselves to drift where they were from
[50:13] from what they did have."
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; And so, he's saying, and he said to
[50:17] them, that's what's wrong with you
[50:19] Pentecostal church. So, I want you to
[50:21] listen very close. Don't get hung up on
[50:23] the Pentecostal side cuz we're message
[50:25] believers, but can fall into exactly the
[50:27] same trap.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; He said
[50:31] it's it's seen baptism of the Holy
[50:35] Spirit strike the people. They saw the
[50:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost strike the
[50:42] people. They had seen them changed from
[50:46] street walkers to godly, saintly women.
[50:50] They've seen men come out of drunkards,
[50:53] alcoholics, and make preachers and
[50:55] gentlemen. And it's seen the great
[50:58] powers of God moving and working and
[51:01] signs and wonders until it's become so
[51:04] common till a Pentecostal church will
[51:07] hardly walk across the street to see the
[51:09] glory of God.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; What they saw, there's nothing wrong
[51:15] with what they saw. They saw the Holy
[51:17] Ghost baptizing people. They saw men and
[51:21] women go to the tank and be baptized in
[51:23] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[51:25] walk out of there changed and
[51:27] transformed. I tell you, right here in
[51:29] this building tonight are more miracles
[51:31] than you could write in a big thick
[51:33] volume of books. If we started to name
[51:36] uh if we started to name the places, I
[51:38] can tell you the people sitting in this
[51:40] place, don't let it be too common to
[51:43] you. They've come from the dark pits and
[51:45] holes of hell.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; They've come from being strung out on
[51:50] drugs.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; They've come from prisons.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; They know what it is to rattle the bars
[51:57] of prison doors. They know what it is to
[51:59] be into a drunken stuper and lost. They
[52:02] know what it is to wish death more than
[52:05] life. We know what it is. Many of you
[52:07] young people have grown up in homes that
[52:09] have been protected and sheltered and
[52:11] you haven't experienced that. You want
[52:13] to stand tonight and say, "Thank God I
[52:15] didn't know that."
[52:18] &gt;&gt; But don't let this be too common.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Don't let it be too common. It's the
[52:24] same Christ
[52:25] &gt;&gt; that did that back there that has done
[52:27] it today.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; We've seen so many come out of these
[52:34] dark pits
[52:36] of hell.
[52:38] The most secure of Satan's prisons have
[52:42] been broken aunder. And God has brought
[52:45] men and women out of there,
[52:47] &gt;&gt; out of mental cases.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Men and women who've been in prison
[52:53] almost to insanity. And God gave us a
[52:56] sane mind once again.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; And you're sitting here today. Don't let
[53:00] it ever be too common.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let breath leave your mouth
[53:04] without being able to say, "Thank God.
[53:08] And if you want to stand, say, "Thank
[53:09] God I'm saved. Thank God I'm delivered.
[53:13] Thank God I saw Christ."
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:18] What a glorious thing. Don't ever let it
[53:21] become common.
[53:24] We'll never see too much of that. We'll
[53:27] never see too much of that. Receive this
[53:30] thanksgiving, Lord Jesus. We thank you.
[53:32] We give you praise. We give you glory.
[53:35] We can all say we would not be here if
[53:38] it was not for him.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just thank him for a moment.
[53:48] Let's just give some time. I want to
[53:51] take a little bit of time and say thank
[53:53] you, Lord Jesus. Oh, hallelujah.
[53:57] Hallelujah. Come and glorify your name,
[54:00] Lord. Do what would be pleasing in your
[54:03] sight.
[54:04] Oh, we bless your name. We bless your
[54:06] name.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; You've opened prison's doors for us.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You set your foot upon the
[54:13] neck of the devil. You crushed his head.
[54:17] You broke his power. You broke the
[54:19] chains of sunder. And here we stand
[54:22] bloodwashed.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Holy.
[54:27] You washed us. You washed our garments.
[54:29] And we stand here holy before you.
[54:32] Hallelujah.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful?
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Give us eyes to see, Lord.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Let us see the true picture.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Let us see truly Christ.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; I believe that's a wonderful few minutes
[54:55] &gt;&gt; that the Lord just allowed us to give
[54:57] him praise.
[55:04] So what brother Brandham is saying to
[55:06] the people, you did see it.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; And what you saw was real.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; What you saw was genuine.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; What you saw was the Holy Ghost.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; What you saw was Jesus Christ walking
[55:17] amongst the people. You did see it. But
[55:19] then he said, you saw too much of it.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; You might think, I can never see too
[55:26] much. But surprising when you see it and
[55:29] you see it and you say it, it's just oh,
[55:33] you know, it's not like
[55:36] it's not the excitement of the first
[55:38] time. That's why it's that's why it's a
[55:40] love affair.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says
[55:42] regardless of how long you've been
[55:44] married and your little wife gets
[55:47] white-haired or gayheaded or whatever
[55:50] more or wrinkles and all the rest of it,
[55:52] she's still your sweetheart.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; What's he talking about? He's talking
[55:55] about the spiritual. No matter how long
[55:57] you've walked with him, he's still our
[55:59] our lovely husband.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And no matter no matter how
[56:04] much he does for us, it must not it must
[56:07] not ever become too common for us,
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. We say tonight, we'll never
[56:12] see too much.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; We can never see too much of you.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can never feel your
[56:19] presence too much. I'm speaking that not
[56:21] to you. I'm telling the Lord. You can
[56:23] never bless us too much.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; It'll never be too common to us. You'll
[56:27] never do too much. Just come again and
[56:30] again and again.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come amongst us again and
[56:33] again and again. Deliver the bound even
[56:36] tonight. Set them free while I'm
[56:38] preaching, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Let
[56:40] the mighty power of God
[56:43] &gt;&gt; come and do the supernatural healing
[56:46] amongst us. Let your word go and defeat
[56:49] the enemy everywhere.
[56:51] Hallelujah.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; We're not preaching. We're talking.
[56:55] We're speaking something that's
[56:57] happening at this moment.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus Christ alive.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus Christ amongst us. Look
[57:04] beyond this suit and see Jesus Christ.
[57:06] Look beyond your own your own self and
[57:09] your own weakness and your own frailties
[57:11] and everything else. Look look beyond
[57:12] the all the negative things and see
[57:14] Jesus Christ.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This is him
[57:21] unveiled in this message. He is here.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; You just praise him. That doesn't scare
[57:40] me or him
[57:43] &gt;&gt; in the unveiling of God. He said
[57:46] they unveiled God
[57:49] plain view.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; He said they should have seen him
[57:52] standing there.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; They should have.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; He was there in plain view. They should
[57:58] have seen him standing there.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; I can say it again today.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Every time we come into this sanctuary,
[58:06] that's what I'm saying.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; This is instruction for you. Every time
[58:10] you come into this sanctuary, you don't
[58:12] look to see what something somebody else
[58:15] is doing or or that. You look for one
[58:17] thing, and that's for him, for Christ.
[58:20] I've come into this sanctuary to see the
[58:22] Lord Jesus Christ in all of his power
[58:25] and all of his glory.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And see him working
[58:29] &gt;&gt; and it'll never be too common for me.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; I remember one minister we had here,
[58:38] Brother Isaac. Nora and I've mentioned
[58:41] this before, but I just get so inspired
[58:43] now and I was just telling about the
[58:45] different ones. This one used to be in
[58:49] motorcycle gang and this one used to be
[58:51] this and that one used to be that. And
[58:53] we were talking around the dinner table
[58:55] and
[58:57] he just said, "Brother Biscll," he said,
[58:59] "Have you just had anybody ordinary just
[59:02] kind of come and get saved?"
[59:05] And I I said, "Yeah, of course we we
[59:08] have had, but you know, we just love to
[59:10] see these marvelous things that God has
[59:13] done." I just love to see it when
[59:16] somebody's got their plan and they're
[59:17] oh, they got charge of their life and
[59:20] everything else and God just takes them
[59:22] by the back of the neck and say, "You're
[59:23] going my way. You're doing my thing."
[59:27] Hallelujah.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; You know that he changed your plans. you
[59:31] know that you were set in headstrong one
[59:34] direction and he just took a hold of you
[59:35] and said you're doing my thing you're
[59:38] going my way
[59:41] &gt;&gt; said we'd seen him he said they should
[59:43] have seen him standing there he said yet
[59:45] he was too common he was an ordinary man
[59:48] and they couldn't say it brother was
[59:50] speaking in the unveiling of God because
[59:52] God was being unveiled right before the
[59:54] people he was talking to
[59:57] &gt;&gt; so he was saying it had a double meaning
[59:59] &gt;&gt; they should have seen it back there that
[1:00:01] should have seen it right now.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; I don't want it to have a double
[1:00:03] meaning. They should have seen it back
[1:00:05] there and we want to say I am seeing it
[1:00:06] right now. Hallelujah. I've seen the
[1:00:09] mighty God unveiled.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; He said they couldn't see it. See, he
[1:00:16] said there stood a man. Well, they said
[1:00:19] this guy, what school did he come from?
[1:00:21] But remember when that spear struck his
[1:00:24] side, that spirit left him and the
[1:00:26] temple uh the temple uh the temple of
[1:00:30] sacrifice blocks turned over and the
[1:00:32] lightning whipped down through the
[1:00:34] temple and rent the veil. What was it?
[1:00:36] There was their god hanging on Calvary
[1:00:40] and they were too blind to see it.
[1:00:43] Brought him into open view. God did
[1:00:45] bring brought him into open view and
[1:00:47] still they didn't see it. They they're
[1:00:50] blinded. God veiled in a human being.
[1:00:54] And that's exactly where he is tonight.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; He's veiled within the bride body of
[1:01:01] Jesus Christ.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Not a diluted Christ. The same Christ.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Not less in power. The same power.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Not less in resurrection. The same
[1:01:13] resurrection. The same glory.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only thing that the only
[1:01:18] thing and and we're willing to say not
[1:01:20] only thy will be done, but we're also uh
[1:01:23] we are intelligent spiritually enough.
[1:01:26] We're revelated enough to know that God
[1:01:28] does things in his timing and in his
[1:01:30] order and we're walking in that.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; We're walking in that season and we know
[1:01:36] the season that we're in. We're not
[1:01:37] ignorant about the season that we're in.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Jesus Christ the same
[1:01:42] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:01:45] He said, "Sir, I'm going to ask you a
[1:01:47] question
[1:01:49] that my mother, Sunday school teacher or
[1:01:51] pastor, cannot answer me." And he's
[1:01:53] talking about a boy with this old
[1:01:56] fisherman.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; You remember the story? And the and the
[1:01:59] and they came into a great storm. And
[1:02:02] the old fisherman overcome by the little
[1:02:04] boy's question. He said he said, "If God
[1:02:07] is so great," the boy asked him, "If God
[1:02:09] is so great, then why can't I see him?"
[1:02:12] That's a simple question from a child.
[1:02:14] if he's so great. But it's a good
[1:02:16] question.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Why can't I see him? And the old
[1:02:19] fisherman, overcome by the little boy's
[1:02:21] question, pulled the orars into the boat
[1:02:23] and put his arms around the little boy
[1:02:25] and hugged him to his breast and pulled
[1:02:28] him up and looked into his face and
[1:02:29] said, "God, bless your little heart,
[1:02:31] honey." All I've seen for the past 40
[1:02:34] years has been God. He had so much God
[1:02:37] on the inside, Brother Brandham said,
[1:02:39] that he could see God on the outside.
[1:02:41] And he said, "That's what we need. We
[1:02:43] get so much of God inside, then we can
[1:02:46] see God on the outside." Hallelujah. And
[1:02:49] we start failing to see God on the
[1:02:50] outside. You know, one thing, we got to
[1:02:53] get more of him on the inside. God, fill
[1:02:55] me. Fill me. Supercharge me. Fill me to
[1:02:59] overflowing. And then I can see God
[1:03:02] everywhere.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; I spoke about the plum line. God sets a
[1:03:13] plum line quite frankly. Now, I just
[1:03:16] want to take you on a little bit of a
[1:03:18] It's not even taking a left-hand curve.
[1:03:21] It's just saying this. The plum line is
[1:03:23] what became too common. the life of
[1:03:27] Jesus Christ amongst the people that he
[1:03:30] was revealing whether it was 2,000 years
[1:03:33] ago or today. That life was the plum
[1:03:36] line
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; and the plum line became too common.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's a standard. Well, yeah, okay,
[1:03:46] you know, but doesn't really mean what
[1:03:48] it used to mean. No, it still means the
[1:03:51] same thing.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; The word always means the same thing.
[1:03:55] So he said in Jehovah Gyra once again he
[1:03:57] said
[1:03:59] he said I am people I'm telling you this
[1:04:02] is uh your Pentecostal people he was a
[1:04:07] he was uh complimenting them your
[1:04:09] Pentecostal people but he says your
[1:04:11] Pentecostal people are seeing so much
[1:04:14] and have through your life since you
[1:04:18] become children of God since you have
[1:04:20] become children of God you've seen so
[1:04:23] much goodness.
[1:04:26] We don't want to ever stop seeing
[1:04:27] goodness.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; You've seen so much mercy.
[1:04:32] So much of the glory of God.
[1:04:35] So much goodness. So much of the glory
[1:04:37] of God. Oh, God have mercy. We don't
[1:04:41] want to stop seeing that.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; I don't want to stop seeing mercy. I
[1:04:46] don't want to stop seeing goodness. I
[1:04:48] don't want to stop seeing the glory of
[1:04:50] God. But he said, "You've seen so much.
[1:04:54] It became so common.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; It became too common to you." He said,
[1:05:00] "It's too common." Listen to this.
[1:05:04] It makes you lose your faith.
[1:05:10] Don't ever let that happen to me. I say,
[1:05:13] "Oh, God." I'm saying this publicly.
[1:05:15] God, don't ever let that happen that
[1:05:18] I've seen so much. I've seen so much
[1:05:20] mercy. I've seen so much goodness. I've
[1:05:22] seen so much of the glory of God that it
[1:05:25] becomes just so common
[1:05:28] and I lose my faith.
[1:05:31] I say, "God, never let this body of
[1:05:35] believers
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; let that happen. It doesn't need to
[1:05:39] happen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; It would be a terrible It would be a
[1:05:42] terrible deceptive thing of Satan for us
[1:05:44] to just allow us and say, "You know
[1:05:46] what? They're having such a glorious
[1:05:48] time. I'll just sit back and I'll just
[1:05:51] let them go at it and they'll get weary
[1:05:53] of it. They'll get tired of it. All
[1:05:55] these great things will become so common
[1:05:57] it won't mean anything to them and
[1:05:58] they'll lose their faith
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; and they'll become impotent and
[1:06:04] stagnant.
[1:06:10] Amen.
[1:06:13] when I read out of Amos last Sunday
[1:06:18] and God said showed him a plum line said
[1:06:20] Amos what do you say he said it's a plum
[1:06:22] line
[1:06:24] it's also in Zechariah if you want to
[1:06:26] read Zechariah 3 because Lord willing
[1:06:29] I'm going to speak in Zechariah on
[1:06:30] Sunday on what seeest thou part three
[1:06:36] and it's also called a plummet
[1:06:39] the plum line or a plummet
[1:06:42] And it's given that you can build a wall
[1:06:45] to or you can build a building to or you
[1:06:47] can build and I can tell you can put a
[1:06:50] plum line up and you put it up and just
[1:06:52] start building your rocks or your bricks
[1:06:54] or whatever. Just put the plum line up
[1:06:56] and just start building. Say, "Okay, now
[1:06:58] we've had the plum line. We've seen it."
[1:07:00] And take it down or take one look at it
[1:07:03] and just carry on building for the next
[1:07:05] couple weeks. All of you that are
[1:07:07] builders here, two weeks down the road,
[1:07:10] even one day down the road, you're a
[1:07:12] long ways off of that line. How many men
[1:07:15] know that?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. A plum
[1:07:19] line is something you check all the
[1:07:20] time.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; And if you're a real good mason, every
[1:07:24] every stone you leave, every stone you
[1:07:27] put down, I've done it. And I look to
[1:07:30] that plum line and I take the handle of
[1:07:33] of maybe the troll or something and just
[1:07:35] tap that.
[1:07:37] And you know what you really need? It's
[1:07:39] good eyesight.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; And you check that out with that plum
[1:07:43] line. Tap it to that brick or that stone
[1:07:47] or whatever it is is right in place. And
[1:07:49] sometimes if you feel a little bit of
[1:07:51] knocking happening, it's probably God
[1:07:53] with his trout just tapping you into
[1:07:55] place.
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:07:58] Hallelujah.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amos was that plum line.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; So, what do you see, Amos? I see a plum
[1:08:09] line. God said, I'm going to show you
[1:08:11] what I'm doing. Says, Amos was the plum
[1:08:14] line. The word of the word of the Lord
[1:08:15] was in him, and the word of the Lord was
[1:08:17] the plum line.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's never been a plum line like
[1:08:20] the one we've got
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; in this day. Never been a plum line like
[1:08:24] this. So I can say that the word of God
[1:08:25] in the bride of Jesus Christ is the plum
[1:08:28] line in this generation.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; The word of God for this day is a plum
[1:08:33] line for every area of our lives. I just
[1:08:36] touched on it Sunday and I don't have I
[1:08:38] don't have time now, but there's a plum
[1:08:40] line. We got a plum line for our
[1:08:42] individual life, for our family, for how
[1:08:45] we uh our conduct, how we how we uh how
[1:08:50] we have our relationship. Uh there's a
[1:08:53] plum line for absolutely everything.
[1:08:54] There's a plum line for the sanctuary, a
[1:08:56] plum line for the order of the church.
[1:08:58] There's a plum line for everything. And
[1:09:00] it's all in the word of God.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're so thankful for that.
[1:09:06] Now, I've just made a statement here.
[1:09:09] God, he cast his he cast his line across
[1:09:12] the face of America in 1956.
[1:09:17] Brother Brandon was in Chicago and I can
[1:09:19] hear Matson Boze who I knew very well.
[1:09:21] and Matson Boz saying yeah because he
[1:09:24] was a little Swedish brother and he
[1:09:27] loved brother Brandham very much and he
[1:09:29] spent a lot of time also in the north in
[1:09:31] Edmonton and so on had a lot of friends
[1:09:32] amongst the Norwegian people that's how
[1:09:34] brother Brandham got up there and
[1:09:36] brother Brandham is saying in Chicago
[1:09:38] and the time has come when God has broke
[1:09:40] the denominational lines and shed forth
[1:09:43] his holy ghost upon the Methodist
[1:09:45] Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran and all
[1:09:47] and whosoever will have a humble and
[1:09:50] contrite part. The separating time has
[1:09:53] come. There's a plum line and you'll
[1:09:56] meet one side of the line or the other.
[1:09:59] I just thought that was remarkable.
[1:10:01] 1956. And he said at 1956, America
[1:10:05] turned the corner.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Uh America actually decided on what side
[1:10:08] of the plum line they were going to be
[1:10:10] and they chose the other side. I'm glad
[1:10:13] we're found on the measurement side.
[1:10:15] Hallelujah. I want to be measured by
[1:10:17] that word. Look where America is today.
[1:10:19] Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; I think that
[1:10:23] it it must I I I've just been almost
[1:10:27] speechless. I have a hard time grasping
[1:10:29] that the new president, his first his
[1:10:32] first official interview is on an uh
[1:10:36] Arab television network. I thought that
[1:10:41] was incredible. I said to my wife, the
[1:10:43] only thing he can do more than this is
[1:10:45] invite and have Osama bin Laden for
[1:10:47] dinner.
[1:10:51] Don't laugh. He might do it.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; He's determined to make friends and uh
[1:10:57] well, it'll be quite an ecumenical
[1:10:59] movement.
[1:11:04] Now, we talked about light and I'm not
[1:11:06] going to get into that right now, but we
[1:11:10] uh the scripture tells us, and I'm just
[1:11:11] going to go for a few more minutes. The
[1:11:13] scripture tells us that we read tonight
[1:11:16] that the life was manifested.
[1:11:19] And I want to I want to I want to just
[1:11:21] go into that and I'll need you to keep
[1:11:23] your good mental faculties going here
[1:11:25] for just a few moments because I've got
[1:11:26] a few things I want to say. But the but
[1:11:29] the scripture says
[1:11:32] uh for the life was manifested. I want
[1:11:35] to there's there's two different uh two
[1:11:38] different words that are used here for
[1:11:40] what the apostles saw and how they saw.
[1:11:43] And we're talking about how we should be
[1:11:45] looking for Christ. Uh I don't have to
[1:11:49] emphasize to you. I know that you
[1:11:51] believe it with all your heart that this
[1:11:54] word which has been sent to us is none
[1:11:57] other than the same person who walked
[1:11:59] here in flesh. Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Only now he is here in word form.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the life was
[1:12:09] manifested
[1:12:13] and we have seen it.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; They saw the manifested life and we bear
[1:12:17] witness." And the word manifested is
[1:12:21] that so the life was manifested. Now
[1:12:24] manifest doesn't mean I saw it. But the
[1:12:27] word manifested says and it it was
[1:12:30] manifested. So someone initiated which
[1:12:33] was God. Of course God initiated that
[1:12:36] this should come forward. And to
[1:12:39] manifested is to make it visible. So I'm
[1:12:42] going to kind of kind of be a little
[1:12:43] demonstrative here for a moment. And the
[1:12:46] life was manifested. He didn't say God
[1:12:48] manifested. He just said it was
[1:12:50] manifested. And that is to make it
[1:12:52] visible or make it known what has been
[1:12:56] hidden or unknown. So it's been back
[1:12:58] here. It's been hidden in the prophecies
[1:13:01] of the types and the shadows of the Old
[1:13:02] Testament. But now the season came that
[1:13:05] it had to be manifested. So God
[1:13:08] determined this is now going to come
[1:13:10] forward.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; What's been hidden is going to be made
[1:13:13] known.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; It's going to be exposed to view.
[1:13:19] How they see it will be up to them.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to make it. I'm going to
[1:13:24] expose it. I'm going to unveil it. I'm
[1:13:27] going to show it. And furthermore, it it
[1:13:30] means even more than just showing
[1:13:31] something. But in this case, it means
[1:13:34] showing himself.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; It means showing oneself.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; So I'm not going to just be a voice on
[1:13:41] the telephone. I'm going to come to your
[1:13:42] house and knock on the door and I'm
[1:13:45] going to be there present with you.
[1:13:47] I'm going to make myself known to become
[1:13:49] known and to become plainly recognized
[1:13:53] and thoroughly understood. I want you to
[1:13:56] have the message in your mind right now.
[1:13:58] The whole uh composite message. This is
[1:14:02] God saying, "I'm going to expose myself.
[1:14:06] I'm going to make myself known. I'm
[1:14:09] going to become visible. I'm going to
[1:14:12] reveal who I am. I'm going to unveil
[1:14:15] myself. I'm going to manifest myself.
[1:14:19] Amen.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; And so that I can be recognized and
[1:14:24] thoroughly understood.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, next time you pick up a
[1:14:28] message book, I want you to say this is
[1:14:30] Jesus Christ and he has he he has sent
[1:14:33] this message to make himself thoroughly
[1:14:36] understood.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:43] And then the word manifested comes from
[1:14:45] a second word and I'm not going to
[1:14:47] bother complicating it by getting into
[1:14:49] the uh the technical part of it. But it
[1:14:54] is also for phenaros which is to
[1:14:57] manifest openly or spread abroad
[1:15:00] outwardly to be plainly recognized or
[1:15:04] known. And Jesus answered now it's to
[1:15:07] spread to spread out openly and
[1:15:10] outwardly. Listen to the words of Jesus
[1:15:13] if this doesn't fit it absolutely
[1:15:14] perfectly. And Jesus answered him, I
[1:15:18] spoke openly.
[1:15:20] This is when he was being tried.
[1:15:22] I spoke openly to the world. I ever
[1:15:26] taught in the synagogues
[1:15:28] and in the temple whether the Jews
[1:15:32] always resort and in secret I have said
[1:15:35] nothing. This is the one. This was the
[1:15:38] manifestation. So he's saying the
[1:15:41] manifestation is saying I've said
[1:15:42] nothing in secret. I did everything in
[1:15:45] the temple. I went into the synagogue. I
[1:15:48] spread out my hands. In other words, we
[1:15:49] spread out the line.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; We showed openly what it was.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; We made ourselves known. I made myself
[1:15:56] known so that God was could be
[1:15:58] thoroughly recognized.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; To leave them without excuse.
[1:16:06] then manifested comes down to phenoros
[1:16:09] and then to pheno probably the wrong
[1:16:12] pronunciation in the Greek but feno is
[1:16:15] to bring forth into light. Now there
[1:16:17] comes another element not just to
[1:16:19] manifest but to bring it forth into
[1:16:21] light
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; right
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; and to cause it to shine
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; and to shed light. So, not only to bring
[1:16:29] it forth into light
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; and to cause light, but to cause it to
[1:16:33] shine and to make it bright or
[1:16:36] respplendant
[1:16:38] and cause it to meet the eyes and strike
[1:16:40] the sight to become clear. Now, we've
[1:16:43] come whole circle. What seeest thou? God
[1:16:46] manifested himself in this generation
[1:16:49] for the purpose to cause a light and to
[1:16:53] cause the light to strike your eye.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not this eye, but an eye
[1:16:59] down here. An eye of faith. That was
[1:17:02] God's purpose in making it manifest.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to put myself
[1:17:08] forward. I'm coming here in a body of
[1:17:10] flesh. I'm coming here in a prophet. I'm
[1:17:12] coming in the last messenger. I'm coming
[1:17:14] and I will begin to manifest myself with
[1:17:16] mighty works, signs, and wonders. And it
[1:17:19] will startle the people. And they'll
[1:17:21] wonder, "What is this?" They'll think
[1:17:23] it's like the scripture, which it is.
[1:17:25] And he'll keep leading them and showing
[1:17:27] them and then finally begin to speak the
[1:17:29] word. And oh, somebody will say, "Oh my,
[1:17:33] it answered my question. Oh, it cast a
[1:17:36] light inside."
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; The light struck the seed.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; I can tell you folks, every person here,
[1:17:48] the light has come.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; The light is here. It's not here so to
[1:17:53] make me shout. It's not here to make a
[1:17:55] person feel good. The light came for one
[1:17:57] purpose, to strike your eye.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; So you can say, "I see it."
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; I see it.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; I see it.
[1:18:07] [Applause]
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Did you ever say that?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you did.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; It's like when the darkness dissipated
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; and the light overcame the darkness and
[1:18:19] all you could say is cry out, "I see it.
[1:18:21] I see it." Hallelujah.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; That, my friend, was a process.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; That was a process in the mind of God.
[1:18:31] I'm going to bring myself forward. I'm
[1:18:33] going to bring myself out into the open.
[1:18:35] I'm going to manifest myself. I'm going
[1:18:37] to do the same works. I'm going to have
[1:18:39] the same character, the same humility.
[1:18:41] People will see my spirit in that
[1:18:44] prophet. They'll just break down and
[1:18:45] cry. And they won't know why they're
[1:18:47] crying. Others will come in the meeting.
[1:18:49] Even the animals, as Sydney Jackson
[1:18:52] says, even the dogs didn't fight
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; such a presence
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; in such an awe.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; What was it? It was the manifestation.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; But the purpose of the manifestation is
[1:19:05] so that the people would look upon it.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Some just come in. They just come in
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; to criticize. And that's they got lots
[1:19:15] to criticize.
[1:19:21] criticized the clothing the prophet was
[1:19:24] dressed in.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Maybe the car he drove,
[1:19:29] the people that were around him.
[1:19:32] Maybe their eyes was on the big offering
[1:19:34] buckets.
[1:19:36] Look at the size of those offering
[1:19:38] buckets.
[1:19:40] Look at all that money.
[1:19:43] And that's all they saw.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Did they ever see Christ? Not for a
[1:19:47] second.
[1:19:50] Not for a second.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; But others came in and and and the
[1:19:56] prophet, the Apostle John said,
[1:19:59] "He was manifested
[1:20:02] and we seen it."
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; But more than that, we beheld it. We
[1:20:08] looked upon it. John said, "And that
[1:20:10] looking is different than when we saw
[1:20:12] it." When he said we saw it, that was
[1:20:14] one word. But when he said we it was
[1:20:17] manifested and we looked upon it, we
[1:20:19] gazed upon it. We studied it, we
[1:20:22] absorbed it with a with the very purpose
[1:20:25] of of of perceiving what was happening.
[1:20:28] And God in his grace loves that
[1:20:30] attitude.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; And we saw him.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; This is my message to you tonight.
[1:20:40] You approach the message in a different
[1:20:42] way.
[1:20:44] Every person here, I'm putting you under
[1:20:45] a mandate to approach the message in a
[1:20:48] different way. You never pick it up and
[1:20:50] look at it as a book. Say, "This is a re
[1:20:53] record, a record of what my Lord Jesus
[1:20:57] did. I want to see how he did it. I want
[1:21:00] to see
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; I want to come Sunday." God was looking
[1:21:05] through the eyes of that messenger
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; at this generation.
[1:21:10] So I was interested in seeing brother
[1:21:12] Brandham talks about a brother he said I
[1:21:15] was I looked down the street he said and
[1:21:17] I thought I saw Rabbi Lawson.
[1:21:21] How many remember him talking about
[1:21:23] Rabbi Lawson?
[1:21:25] He said Rabbi Lawson he said he was a
[1:21:28] little Pentecostal preacher but he never
[1:21:30] he never really gained any
[1:21:33] any recognition.
[1:21:36] He said he had a little flat black hat
[1:21:38] on the back of his head. He said, and
[1:21:39] that's why I called him Rabbi, Rabbi
[1:21:42] Lawson.
[1:21:45] He said he had great big
[1:21:48] spectacles,
[1:21:51] great big round spectacles.
[1:21:53] He'd been in a car run over by a car and
[1:21:56] he was stooped over when he came. And
[1:21:58] so, Brother Brandham talks about his
[1:22:00] spectacles,
[1:22:02] talks about his little flat cap,
[1:22:07] talks about how he walked and his how he
[1:22:09] was stooped,
[1:22:11] talks about his cane,
[1:22:14] and he said he was a good man
[1:22:17] and he did what he could for God and he
[1:22:20] preached. He says, "And then I'd see him
[1:22:23] and he'd start singing that song."
[1:22:28] Uh,
[1:22:34] there waits for me a glad tomorrow
[1:22:39] where gates of pearl swing open wide.
[1:22:43] and when I've passed this veil of
[1:22:46] sorrow,
[1:22:48] I'll dwell upon the other side.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; And he said he would take the cane and
[1:22:55] hook brother Brandham around the neck
[1:22:56] and pull him to him and say, "We'll
[1:23:00] sing. We'll dwell." He included Brother
[1:23:03] Brandham. He says, "We'll dwell
[1:23:06] upon the other side
[1:23:10] someday.
[1:23:13] My labors will be ended.
[1:23:16] Oh, someday beyond the reach of mortal
[1:23:19] kin. Someday God only knows just where
[1:23:22] or when
[1:23:24] the wheels of mortal life shall all
[1:23:27] stand still.
[1:23:30] He said, "And hook him on the net. And
[1:23:32] we shall go to dwell on Zion's hill."
[1:23:39] He said, "He always was in the Bible.
[1:23:42] and his wife got so tired of it because
[1:23:44] she wanted him to work so they could
[1:23:47] have earned a better living
[1:23:51] and he was always reading his Bible
[1:23:54] and she got so angry with him reading
[1:23:57] his Bible all the time that she went and
[1:23:59] grabbed his Bible and went and threw it
[1:24:02] in the stove and burned it.
[1:24:06] said it's a short time later
[1:24:08] his wife was putting up a Christmas tree
[1:24:12] with her Christmas lights
[1:24:14] and something happened and caught fire
[1:24:17] and burned her up and she died by fire
[1:24:21] in the very spot where she took her
[1:24:24] Bible and he said, "Lay not your hand
[1:24:26] upon God's anointed."
[1:24:30] And I got thinking,
[1:24:33] here was two people.
[1:24:36] Here was a prophet
[1:24:40] and he looked at him through a set of
[1:24:42] eyes
[1:24:43] and here was a wife that actually lived
[1:24:45] with him every day
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; and looked at him with a set of eyes and
[1:24:50] both of them saw two completely
[1:24:52] different people. Right. Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; I said, "God,
[1:24:59] you know the set of eyes I want."
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Not for Rabbi Lawson, for brother Ed
[1:25:05] Discoll. I want to be able to look at
[1:25:07] every person. I want to be able to see
[1:25:10] beyond your suit and beyond your hair
[1:25:13] and beyond your weaknesses and beyond
[1:25:16] your frailty and see Jesus Christ.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; What sayest thou?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; That was brother Brandham and and
[1:25:32] brother Rabbi Lawson.
[1:25:36] 2,000 years ago, it was Jesus Christ,
[1:25:37] his disciples that I told you on Sunday
[1:25:40] morning as I'm closing now.
[1:25:45] They came to the woman. Jesus was with
[1:25:47] the woman at the well. And they came and
[1:25:49] marveled that he was talking to the
[1:25:51] woman at the well.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he saw the multitudes and
[1:25:56] they were
[1:25:58] as sheep scattered. But no one else saw
[1:26:00] that. The disciples didn't see that. No
[1:26:02] one else saw that. But today and this
[1:26:05] day, and I don't want to go any further
[1:26:06] in my message because I'm going to go
[1:26:08] there Sunday.
[1:26:11] This congregation and the believers of
[1:26:13] this message need desperately
[1:26:17] the Holy Ghost vision.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; The eyes
[1:26:21] the eyes that we can see Christ in that
[1:26:24] message as we've never we need to see
[1:26:27] him clearly.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; We need to see Christ in one another.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:26:39] listen.
[1:26:41] The wife of Jesus Christ. The wife of
[1:26:45] Jesus Christ
[1:26:48] is here
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; on this earth.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's all kinds of everything
[1:26:56] else here, but the wife of Jesus Christ
[1:26:59] is here.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Just make sure that you see her
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; because when you see her, you'll see
[1:27:06] him.
[1:27:11] Hallelujah. I'm admonishing you. See
[1:27:14] her. See Christ in her. See Christ in
[1:27:19] that message. See Christ. He is there.
[1:27:22] Make sure you see him.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Don't miss him. Don't miss him.
[1:27:26] Multitudes missed him.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; The majority missed him.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Make sure we're not in the majority.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:43] I was
[1:27:46] as a young man,
[1:27:48] I was certainly
[1:27:50] I can't even begin to describe to you
[1:27:52] how
[1:27:56] intense I was
[1:27:59] to see what Brother Brandham,
[1:28:03] what he would notice,
[1:28:06] how he would act,
[1:28:08] how he would hold his Bible,
[1:28:12] how he was going to be out on the hunt
[1:28:14] in the tent and day to day. And I just
[1:28:17] watching everything, how he would pray,
[1:28:20] how he would be at the at our table when
[1:28:23] we ate, everything. I just watching him
[1:28:25] and yet I wanted him just to be free and
[1:28:27] easy. And so
[1:28:30] there was no pressure and I wasn't, you
[1:28:32] know, trying to needle him for spiritual
[1:28:35] things. Just let him have a good time. I
[1:28:38] just wanted him to be rested and
[1:28:40] relaxed. Just wanted him to be able to
[1:28:42] come out of there and say, "It's the
[1:28:43] best time I had." And I believe he did.
[1:28:46] I really do. I'm saying that here in
[1:28:47] this congregation, but I believe I did
[1:28:49] because after that first time, he came
[1:28:51] back there every year.
[1:28:56] Yeah.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; He said, you know, brother Eddie, he
[1:29:00] said, when the Lord calls me up,
[1:29:03] well, Bill Brandham,
[1:29:07] just what part of the earth are you
[1:29:08] going to have for the millennium? What
[1:29:09] would you like for the millennium?
[1:29:13] He said, I think I'll just have me BC.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; So, you folks across the border, you
[1:29:19] might want to start immigration right
[1:29:20] now.
[1:29:25] But all of you folks living here, I have
[1:29:27] to tell you, it wasn't Cooper.
[1:29:32] It wasn't this hell hole. It was way up
[1:29:35] there where
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; it's some rough living, but it was it
[1:29:39] was God's country.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; And he saw God. He saw God in those
[1:29:44] mountains.
[1:29:46] But one day, you know, we' passed a
[1:29:48] little sign and I'm just going to close
[1:29:49] and children
[1:29:51] tell this story for them. So the native
[1:29:54] Indian people were very very upset that
[1:29:57] we were there and so they put a little
[1:30:00] sign up and only one of them could write
[1:30:02] as I understand there's 17 children
[1:30:05] they're all grown up and some of them
[1:30:07] married but most of them not married and
[1:30:10] the old mother and father and they put a
[1:30:12] sign up pass this sign means blood.
[1:30:20] So we looked at that sign, but we're
[1:30:21] riding our horses. So we look at that
[1:30:24] sign. Mhm. Okay. I don't know whose
[1:30:26] blood it's going to mean, but we're
[1:30:27] going on. So
[1:30:30] So we pitched our tent, went on for
[1:30:32] about maybe 20 miles, and pitched our
[1:30:34] tent,
[1:30:36] and
[1:30:37] uh
[1:30:40] it was it was in the morning, early
[1:30:41] morning,
[1:30:43] and I hear
[1:30:47] that's all I heard.
[1:30:49] So I crawled on my hands and knees
[1:30:53] to the tent and when I open the tent
[1:30:56] flaps I'm just seeing four horse legs
[1:31:00] and I look up on there and there's an
[1:31:03] Indian st sitting there straight as a
[1:31:05] bullet looking right down at me.
[1:31:08] Wow, maybe that sign did mean something.
[1:31:12] And another another Indian man right
[1:31:14] behind him on another horse.
[1:31:18] So I closed the flaps. I says, "We got
[1:31:20] company."
[1:31:23] I'm sure glad I had a prophet in the
[1:31:24] tent.
[1:31:29] We need some divine intervention right
[1:31:31] now.
[1:31:33] Turned out it was old Mr. McDonald and
[1:31:37] they were the people that was had 17
[1:31:39] children and they came in and he sat
[1:31:41] down. And they squatted and there were
[1:31:44] people of very few words. And brother
[1:31:46] Bud says, "Well, you want something to
[1:31:48] eat?"
[1:31:49] Yeah, that'll be fine. Okay. So, they
[1:31:51] put on some tea, put on some cookies,
[1:31:55] and they drink their tea. Terrible
[1:31:57] strong. So, and but the old man had on
[1:32:02] gunny sacks stitched on his pants from
[1:32:04] up here all the way down to here. Made
[1:32:08] on both both legs. and he sat
[1:32:11] cross-legged like so
[1:32:14] and uh had a tea and cookies and they
[1:32:17] said there was another son down at the
[1:32:19] river so he came up and all three of
[1:32:20] them sat there and had something to eat
[1:32:22] and had their tea
[1:32:25] and then they just it was time to go. So
[1:32:27] they went outside and got into their
[1:32:30] onto their saddle into their saddles and
[1:32:32] on their horse. And uh when they were
[1:32:34] sitting there, brother Brennham, he he
[1:32:38] nudges me like that. He says, "See his
[1:32:42] pants? Do you see his patches? Patches
[1:32:45] on his pants." So that was the first
[1:32:47] thing the prophet recognized. That's
[1:32:49] first thing he looked at was the patches
[1:32:51] on his pants.
[1:32:53] And the second thing was when he got
[1:32:55] outside and he swung up into the saddle,
[1:32:57] he was just as straight as an arrow. He
[1:33:01] sat so dignified and gallant in that
[1:33:04] saddle. Brother Brown nudged me again.
[1:33:06] He says, "See how he sits in the
[1:33:08] saddle." I thought, "Here's two great
[1:33:11] things the prophet recognized.
[1:33:14] The patches on his pants
[1:33:16] and how he sat in the saddle." You know
[1:33:19] what? That was important because it
[1:33:22] spoke something of the man.
[1:33:25] And it was that man's wife that was
[1:33:26] dying from a heart attack. And brother
[1:33:27] Brandham ran back on horses either that
[1:33:30] trip or the next trip to pray for her.
[1:33:32] And she did not die. She was dying from
[1:33:34] a heart attack.
[1:33:36] Oh friends, I learned a lot of things
[1:33:40] by observing
[1:33:43] because I believed that he was God's
[1:33:45] prophet
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; and I wanted to see things how he saw
[1:33:48] it. I wanted to notice what he noticed.
[1:33:51] I wanted to act the way he acted. Not to
[1:33:54] duplicate him, but I admired that kind
[1:33:57] of character, that kind of atmosphere,
[1:33:59] and the way he responded. And I still
[1:34:01] pray to this day, God, help me to
[1:34:03] respond the way he responded. The way we
[1:34:06] see things
[1:34:08] will cause us to react in a certain way.
[1:34:12] Our vision will cause us to act a
[1:34:14] certain way. And so I pray with
[1:34:16] everything that's in me that God will
[1:34:19] take this congregation
[1:34:22] higher
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; and that you'll remember this evening.
[1:34:25] Let's see us though. And you'll go out
[1:34:27] of here this evening say, "Lord, let me
[1:34:29] see it the way you see it.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Let me see it with the eyes of faith."
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just stand?
[1:34:45] And I wonder if we can just
[1:34:51] like sing that song. Open my eyes that I
[1:34:55] may see. We can sing the first verse and
[1:34:59] and then we're just going to have
[1:35:00] prayer.
[1:35:01] [Music]
[1:35:08] I
[1:35:12] may see a prayer now.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; This is the truth
[1:35:19] thou has for me
[1:35:24] in my hand.
[1:35:28] you
[1:35:32] that shall not
[1:35:36] set
[1:35:38] me free prayerfully now
[1:35:44] I wait for thee
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:50] my god
[1:35:53] I will to
[1:35:58] Open my eyes.
[1:36:03] [Music]
[1:36:15] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:36:16] [Music]
[1:36:25] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:36] I hear
[1:36:38] everything
[1:36:47] [Music]
[1:36:50] I
[1:36:52] fore
[1:36:54] [Music]
[1:36:56] my
[1:37:00] to see.
[1:37:03] Open my eyes
[1:37:06] to
[1:37:08] [Music]
[1:37:11] see.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that lovely? Isn't
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; there a nice presence?
[1:37:22] [Music]
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Just think of it. Our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:37:28] our lover,
[1:37:30] he even loves this atmosphere more than
[1:37:31] we do. He longs for it. He yearns for
[1:37:35] it. He doesn't have fellowship with
[1:37:36] anyone else.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Just has fellowship with his bre, his
[1:37:40] wife, his believers.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Otto, I want you to come.
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:52] Brother Otto is a compassionate
[1:37:56] doctor
[1:38:01] and he's a very dear friend.
[1:38:04] We've traveled many many places in the
[1:38:07] world.
[1:38:09] Goes to Africa and Zimbabwe and goes
[1:38:12] with the doctor and goes to the hospital
[1:38:14] and does whatever he can do.
[1:38:18] many many times in my office. He's
[1:38:20] treating somebody
[1:38:23] and he's one of those compassionate
[1:38:25] doctors.
[1:38:26] Many of you don't know he gave over 30
[1:38:30] about 32 or more years of his life to
[1:38:33] teaching others
[1:38:36] at the university level as a professor.
[1:38:40] practiced in three hospitals
[1:38:43] plus his own clinic
[1:38:45] plus teaching plus training others
[1:38:49] and there's been times when I wasn't
[1:38:51] well and he just asked me the odd
[1:38:53] question said well here do this
[1:38:57] and God spoke to you brother Otto
[1:39:00] brother Otto has a need in his body
[1:39:03] and we're going to pray for him tonight
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:39:08] I feel this is a great privilege message
[1:39:10] for me. Brother Otto,
[1:39:14] dear heavenly father,
[1:39:19] what a privilege this is.
[1:39:22] My hands a poor substitute for your
[1:39:24] hands, Lord Jesus.
[1:39:27] But I ask you to lay your hands upon
[1:39:29] him.
[1:39:31] And I pray that your virtue surge
[1:39:34] through his body, oh God, and correct
[1:39:38] the irregularity. Correct. Oh God,
[1:39:40] everything Father that is not absolutely
[1:39:43] perfect.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Our dear brother Otto Lord a doctor, a
[1:39:48] compassionate doctor, a man a lovely
[1:39:52] spirit. I pray, Father, that you will
[1:39:54] grant him, Father, grant him, oh God,
[1:39:58] according to his faith and according to
[1:40:00] our faith. And I have confidence
[1:40:02] tonight, Lord, because you're the very
[1:40:04] author of compassion.
[1:40:07] You're the one who revealed yourself to
[1:40:09] him and how he loves this message. How
[1:40:11] he loves this word. How he has spoken to
[1:40:14] so many others and witnessed and
[1:40:16] testified. And above all things, he's
[1:40:18] given himself freely, freely. Freely
[1:40:22] without even thanks or without even
[1:40:25] looking for anything. He's given himself
[1:40:27] for freely, Lord Jesus. And your
[1:40:30] messenger said exactly the same thing.
[1:40:32] Living for others, we're looking
[1:40:34] eternity in the face. We're looking
[1:40:36] heaven directly in the face. Sometimes,
[1:40:39] Lord, these bodies get weary and we need
[1:40:43] an extra surge of strength. I pray, oh
[1:40:46] God,
[1:40:48] that the great physician now,
[1:40:51] the great physician will come and be his
[1:40:53] physician in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:57] Lord, I pray your blessings upon him.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:04] And I know that he will continue to be a
[1:41:06] blessing to others.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, Father. I thank you
[1:41:10] for the day that he
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; came and heard and received
[1:41:16] and has remained steadfast from that day
[1:41:19] forward.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Blessings upon our precious brother
[1:41:22] Otter Slapner, our Lord, a doctor and a
[1:41:25] friend
[1:41:27] for your glory.
[1:41:29] Amen. Amen. God bless you, brother.
[1:41:32] Amen.
[1:41:35] Hallelujah.
[1:41:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:41:46] I feel wonderful.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Let's go home.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; You ready to go home?
[1:41:54] Oh, may they may we just all uh if we
[1:41:59] don't see each other tomorrow morning,
[1:42:00] we'll see each other in the rapture.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:07] I just want to sing one course and
[1:42:09] quarter past 9 and then you'll all be
[1:42:11] dismissed. Pass me not, oh gentle
[1:42:13] Savior. I sing these because sometimes
[1:42:15] I've been singing them throughout the
[1:42:17] day and and I I just pray that he'll be
[1:42:19] your close companion, each one of you,
[1:42:21] and on the highway. And Lord willing

[1:45:32] your love. Lord, may we never, never,
[1:45:35] ever, ever count it common,
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; the message that you've brought to us,
[1:45:40] the revelation
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; that you've imparted to us. Lord, may we
[1:45:44] always be thankful, Father.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, let us shake oursselfves.
[1:45:50] [Music]
[1:45:53] have a paradigm shift. Father, change
[1:45:56] us, Lord.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; That we may be appreciative of that
[1:46:00] which you have given us, Lord. That
[1:46:02] token,
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; that impartation of your spirit, of
[1:46:06] yourself.
[1:46:08] As your bride, we stand before you,
[1:46:10] Lord, humbly
[1:46:13] in thanksgiving.
[1:46:15] And Lord, we ask again for your healing
[1:46:18] virtue to flow out to those that are on
[1:46:21] the internet. Lord Jesus, we curse the
[1:46:24] enemy off of their bodies and their
[1:46:26] minds and their lives. Lord Jesus, we
[1:46:29] know it's your plan and your purpose
[1:46:31] that we walk in health and strength.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we thank you for that. We ask
[1:46:37] now that you would go with us, Lord, and
[1:46:39] help us, Father. Help us each one to be
[1:46:42] sincere and true, Lord.
[1:46:45] May we have a burden to pray. Give us a
[1:46:48] burden to pray. Lord, give us a burden
[1:46:52] to pray.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Oh God, give us a burden to pray, Lord
[1:46:57] Jesus.
[1:46:59] Hallelujah,
[1:47:00] like you did in the garden, Lord.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; You poured your heart out that we would
[1:47:06] pour our heart outs before you, Lord.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Now strengthen our pastor.
[1:47:14] strengthen the saints
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; as we travel home tonight. Lord, let
[1:47:18] this service ever be mindful, ever be
[1:47:22] before us, Lord,
[1:47:25] as we realize.
[1:47:28] I see it.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:47:35] Oh, thank you, Lord. It's such a
[1:47:37] privilege. Such a privilege. Lord, bless
[1:47:41] the saints and strengthen their bodies
[1:47:44] in this precious doctor.
[1:47:46] Don't forget him, Lord. We know you
[1:47:49] won't.
[1:47:51] Thank you, Lord, in Jesus precious name.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
