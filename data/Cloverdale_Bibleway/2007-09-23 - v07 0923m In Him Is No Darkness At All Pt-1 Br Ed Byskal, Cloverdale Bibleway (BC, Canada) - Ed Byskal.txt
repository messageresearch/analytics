And so I thought well I'll just take the time teach it to you this morning just before brother Ed comes. We come broken. We come undone. Amen. We can try to love each other but you know what? We come up short, you know, because we do Lord this morning we need to come to you. So uh little simple chorus. We'll try it. If you put Ryan's microphone on too, he's going to help me sing it. So, uh, I'll sing it a couple times and you can join in and trust it be a blessing to you. [Music] We come broken and we come undone. We come trying hard to love everyone. But we come up short in all that we do. Because we do, Lord, we come to you and we come broken and we come undone. We come trying hard to love everyone, but we come up short in all that we do because we do, Lord, we come to you. &gt;&gt; You stand and sing it with us. We come broken and we come undone. We come trying hard to love everyone. But we come up short in all that we do because we do, Lord. We come to you, &gt;&gt; Lord. And we come rolling and we come undone, Lord. We come trying hard to love everyone, but we come up short in all that we do because we do, Lord. We come tear, &gt;&gt; Lord. And we come broken and we come undone. We come trying hard to love everyone, but we come up short in all that we do. Because we do, Lord, we come to you, &gt;&gt; Lord. And you, &gt;&gt; you came to show the way, not around, but through. So through it all, Lord, we come to you. And you drove away not around but through. So through it all Lord we come broken and &gt;&gt; we come broken and we come undone. We come trying hard to love everyone, but we come up short in all that we do. Because we do, Lord, we come to you &gt;&gt; and we come broken and we come undone. We come trying hard to love everyone. And we come up short in all that we do. Because we do, Lord, we come to you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Come by here, my Lord. [Music] Come by here. Come by here. &gt;&gt; Come by here, my Lord. Come by here. We need you, Lord. Oh, come by here my [Music] &gt;&gt; sing it as a prayer. Speak to me my Lord. [Music] Speak to me my Lord. We need you. Speak to us, Lord. Speak to me. Speak to me, Lord, Lord. Come back here. [Music] Oh, speak to me, my Lord. Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; I am listening Lord. I am listening [Music] now. [Music] I am Lord of my [Music] I am Lord come by [Music] come I wonder if somebody's praying. Somebody's praying. Somebody's praying, Lord. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we got a group of people that's praying. Someone's praying, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm praying. [Music] Let's lift our hearts in prayer now. [Music] Come by. &gt;&gt; Oh, come by. &gt;&gt; With our eyes closed, our heads bowed, we are approaching to the majesty of the Almighty God. And into your August presence we come, Father, through a way that is blood sprinkled. Oh, the precious blood, the sacrificial blood, the price that was paid. And without the shedding of blood, there's no remission of sins. We stand reconciled to God through the blood of the lamb, God's lamb, the Passover lamb. And we remember today this Lord's day, your resurrection. We also remember your suffering and your death. Lord, as we will be receiving and gathering around the communion table and having foot washing, what a time of fellowship, bowing with one another and praying for the body of Christ. I pray that you'll make this day a day that will be so special. Lord, I pray that the enemy will be utterly defeated today. May those that are sick be healed as they hear the word of God. May those that are troubled, oh God, speak peace. May the same words of our Lord Jesus Christ come to them even now, Father, let it come to them, peace be still. I pray father in the name of Jesus Christ that a supernatural unveiling of yourself the revealing of your own person amongst us. Make yourself known through the ministry of the word as well to all our beloved people that are the congregation that are streaming. Lord, I pray you'll enter into every room, into every place, wherever they may be gathered or assembled at this time and whatever time zone they may be in. I pray, oh Father, it'll be hearttoheart, attribute to attribute. Lord, as we fellowship together around the body word of the Lord Jesus Christ, anoint us, Father. Anoint me to speak exactly what you would have said and for the people to receive the engrafted word in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll be having communion service at 4:00 for those that are journeying some distance and our dear friends and believers from Seattle that come for this time. We want it to be a very special time and let's prepare ourselves. It's one thing to announce an event or to have it, but let's prepare ourselves. We don't have communion as often as I would like to have. we having a sizable congregation it's a little bit difficult. I also just want to mention too because it comes to my mind uh we h we had the wedding yesterday for our brother Kyle and sister Sharon and they had announced on Wednesday that we wouldn't be having the prayer service on Friday because we're having the wedding on Saturday and I question I didn't know but all the chairs I found out later all the chairs have to go out of the sanctuary the only place we can put I miss in the chapel. And so if that happens again, maybe we'll just open up some homes and have the prayer service because we don't like to have the prayer service set aside. So when that needs to take place, but I thought some of you may want to know that and I just want to make that clear. I'm going to be reading in the scripture first in first John the first chapter of first John 1 and uh I'm going to with God's help uh I I I want to try to bring a subject to you and in order to do so I like to give an overview right at the beginning I want to speak about uh and on the subject which comes out of a a line in the scripture in him is no darkness at all in the message shalom brother Brandham speaks and he takes and reads out of Isaiah 60 1 and2 which we also will be reading there but he said that we are living in a time where faith facing we're actually facing two subjects and we're facing the subject of rise and shine for the light has shone upon you but gross darkness is upon the people so I think I could say with without being misunderstood at all we live in a very dark time gross darkness is upon the world and gross darkness upon the people and the light has risen to shine upon the body of Jesus Christ, the bride of Jesus Christ. But if we do not if we do not dwell near the light or in the light, says if we walk in the light as he is in the light, then we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin. But it's very very possible for the light to become dim or it's very possible for us to live say distance ourselves from the light and not be walking in the light and then we are actually in a mixtury. Brother Brandham uses the word mixtury that's why I use it. We we we may find ourselves in a time of you know in a place where things become kind of shadowy and and you know for those that have are men of the woods and have gone out and done hunting and so on and you're looking for maybe looking for your pathway or you're looking to make sure you see what clearly what you're supposed to see. And uh when when you get into a time of shade and deep shadows, your perception changes very much. Things that are standing still. They look like they're moving. And things that are a certain shape, they change their shape and you don't see things very accurately. And that's the way it is. The world today, they see all kinds of things, but they're not real. They see things that they get all excited about and when they get there it's not there. &gt;&gt; So I just want to bring that aspect and secondly that God is associated with light for he is light. I'll be making some of these statements later. But God is also associated with fire. And fire is light, but fire also is a is a purifying element. We've heard much about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and with fire. I want to unite these two subjects together today. the light and the fire. And I want to suggest to you just to I that's why I'm saying it while you're standing. There's been a great deal of misunderstanding I think or misconception of the baptism of the Holy Ghost because people are looking for a single experience. Some brother Bram said they shouted they thought they had it and they didn't. They spoke in tongues and they thought they had it but they didn't. and had all kinds of feelings and emotion. They thought they had it and they didn't. I pondered that over many, many, many years. And I I'm going to suggest to you that the baptism of the Holy Ghost, of course, is when the Holy Spirit gives life to the word and the life of Christ begins to live out from you. But brother Bradom said, "If you don't think you have battles or struggles after you're filled with the Holy Ghost, just get filled once &gt;&gt; and you'll find out that's when your struggle starts. &gt;&gt; And if that's when the struggle starts, that's when all hell comes against you. That's when all darkness comes against you." &gt;&gt; See, that's at that time. And so I'm going to suggest to you that the baptism of fire is actually a a lifelong experience. That fire of the Holy Spirit. All right. Thank you for standing. We'll read John 1 1:7. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life. For the life was manifested. I want you to just notice that word manifested. and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also might have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his son Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you that your joy may be full. Amen. &gt;&gt; This then is the message which we've heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. &gt;&gt; If we say that we have fellowship with him and we walk and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another. And the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin. There's just two verses in Isaiah 60. Chapter 60, verse 1 and two. &gt;&gt; Arise, shine, for thy light has come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall rise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; God bless his word. You may have your saints. So although we are in a time when I believe the light has shone uh pure light, holy light, the light of the word, the manifested light, the vindicated word and we can use so many various terms, different terms that uh really says the same thing. Yet there's gross darkness. And if we didn't uh if we didn't have what we have, I think that uh a person could become perhaps cynical of the world or where we're in. You hear of such we we actually become numb. We hear so much that's taking place, such atrocities, such injustices, such irreconcilable events that are happening on a local level, on a national level, in the city, we hear of these things and being sensitive as we are, I believe we should be sensitive, but the world tends to make a person numb and almost uh I insulated &gt;&gt; because that's what happens when you hear of such things and you'd like to do something but but then you can't you're prevented hear people that are hungry and children that are starving and you you sit here with more than you can handle on your plate and you say this isn't right somehow it's not right. It just got hundreds of places to eat and restaurants and all these things and more food in our in our, you know, freezer and in our refrigerator than we can possibly eat. And and and you know that there's multitudes that don't have enough to even survive for the day. Somehow it's not right. Say whoever started this world, it's time for him to come back. Time to for him to set things right. But he will one day. He absolutely will one day. That is a promise of God. But those things affect a believer. &gt;&gt; At least they should. &gt;&gt; And there are a lot of things that just take place from time to time. We don't even want to get into it. But such disastrous things that take place. Death is on every hand. And death is darkness. &gt;&gt; Death is a shadow, deep, deep shadow. And we're having it all around us all the time. And young people in schools and universities and you hear it on a regular basis now. They're shutting this school down and that school is locked down. And you think, "Oh, maybe it's some far far away place." And then you find it's right on your own doorstep, right in your own town, right in your own country. say h how does a civilized free nation or free country get to this state? How does it how does it deteriorate to such a place? Well, we've had a prophet and he said it's going that direction and it's going to go that direction and the scripture says that the world is going to wax worse and worse. So, we're not looking for things to improve as such. We're looking for things to happen the way God's word said they're going to happen. And when they re when the world rejects truth when they reject when God sends a messenger, sends a prophet messenger. When God sends the spirit of Elijah into the world, people say, "Well, I don't believe there's a spirit Elijah." Well, that's fine. That's up to you. But then you can answer to me, why why is the things happening the way they are happening? It's because a world has rejected what God has sent. And that's why it is the way that it is. And it can only become darker and darker when the light has come and is has been rejected. In the message shalom, he said, "Now, good morning." Good morning means peace. Darkness is gathering. What's it gathering for? What's the darkness gathering for? to show the light. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Arise," to the bride of Jesus Christ, the elect of God said, "Arise." What does it mean? Arise. Stand up. Arise. Become powerful. &gt;&gt; That's what the Hebrew word is. Become powerful. &gt;&gt; Arise. Come on the scene. Arise. Become evident. Yes. &gt;&gt; Become visible. Arise is to be established. What you're saying, arise, shine. It's not just to stand up vertically, but be established. There's a big difference, but just arising and being or being established. Be established. Arise also is endure. Last, &gt;&gt; not just arise today. It's not just something for the moment. It's not a flash in the pan. Be powerful. be evident, &gt;&gt; come on the scene &gt;&gt; and to endure and to be proven. That means winds can blow, &gt;&gt; tests can come. But you have risen. Not just to rise for the moment, but to arise to be powerful, to be evident, and to be proven. Arise. And has one more to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just I did rise. We haven't risen on the scene just to be different. Haven't risen on the scene to have another kind of worship. Haven't risen on the scene just to be dressed a certain way. We've risen on the scene to shine forth a true light, a glory of God. And prepared to be proven, prepared to be tested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And prepared to last. &gt;&gt; It's not just for a moment. &gt;&gt; And it's not to deteriorate. It's not to diminish. It's not to become more weak. It's to become stronger and stronger until that perfect light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said in that shalom, I just want this is a setting we're facing here two subjects. He said two subjects. I want you to think about them. He said one contrast to the other. Isaiah says, "Arise, shine, for the glory of God has come upon you and the light is here." And then the very next verse, it says, "Gross darkness is upon the people." And then we are in a mixtury of light and darkness. So we're in a mixtury of light and darkness. And then my address to the church is shalom, peace. Let's find out what it's all about. We are facing this year because it was a new year message really. We are facing a new year with both darkness and light. Here's the phrase I want you to hear. The world is one of the most is in one of the most chaotic times of darkness that has ever stood in. And yet it's standing in again the most blessed light that it ever shined in. I would say since ' 64 1964 when that was spoken just a year prior to brother Brandham's going less than a year I would say that the darkness has gotten to an oppressive state &gt;&gt; and the light from that time I would say very few people if any really understood what he was talking about but we have seen the light of the message that has spread spread over the earth. &gt;&gt; He spoke to maybe 30, 40 people like he was speaking to 30, 40, thousands or hundreds of thousands cuz he knew. He knew they were going. I listened to him the other day. He said probably maybe 30, there may be 40 people there. But you have to realize this is going to the world. How'd he know it was going to the world? Only a prophet knew it was going to the world. He could say it was going to the world. He knew we'd be here today. Hallelujah. God sent this word for a people. He knew that word would call out a people. He knew it was light. &gt;&gt; He knew it was a glorious light. &gt;&gt; Good morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Rise. Shine. Your light has come. And the glory of God has come upon his people. &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing. It's time for the people of God to rejoice in that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and recognize that light and be thankful for that light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The world is in another scene. So, we don't want to uh become too taken up with it. But there are some very very interesting things. The darkness that we will speak about for just briefly, there's darkness on a a national level. There's a darkness on a universal level in the world and brother Brandham spoke about it. He touched on it. I don't want you to lose my subject as I just touch on this. But in the in the message shalom, while we just read this uh touched on this paragraph and it quickens us right away, but he spent a good part of that message speaking about the pope going to Jerusalem and the moon and the light going out and the darkness on the earth. And he's speaking about the darkness in within the religious system. And so he's he you see he's not just a messenger to give a sign and reveal a secret of the heart and pray for somebody that's sick. But now and it wasn't just for the church of the city that he was in. And it wasn't just for America as a nation, but it was for the whole world. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't only for the whole world, but he was speaking on behalf of the God of creation, who's a God of the universe, who's a God of &gt;&gt; only God. There is true God, true living God. And so he could speak about the planetary system and the moon and the sun and all of those things because it all merges down into one subject. &gt;&gt; God is light. &gt;&gt; And God created great lights in the heavens to rule the day and to rule the night. Same God, same God that sends a word, a light to rule in your life. &gt;&gt; A great light to shine and rule in your light. When a light shines and darkness dissipates, and he uses the terminology, when the light shines and it presses, and I love that, it presses the darkness back where it should be. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where I tie it into the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is none other than the spirit of God himself coming and it strikes the seed and life comes. &gt;&gt; With life comes light and light comes. And what does the baptism of the Holy Ghost do? When light comes, it starts to press the darkness back where it should be. And if we should walk kind of in the shadows or we walk uh away from the light, we might allow questions to begin to dominate our minds. Then our minds become clouded and our vision becomes unclear. We don't see things the way perhaps that we ought to see. be our our our decisions and all become kind of clouded because of the shadows. But soon as light comes and the manifested word is the light and soon as light comes, you'll find that which was a question dissolves. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That which was unclear about your decision dissolves. Maybe you came to church this morning wondering about something, thinking about something, just uh looking to the Lord about something, and you hold it in your heart. You haven't got a clear decision on it. And then as you hold it steady and you're sincere, then the preaching of the word comes. Hallelujah. And with the preaching of the word comes manifestation of God himself and the question leaves. Hallelujah. The answer has come. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Manifesting the word. &gt;&gt; We can go through very difficult times. We go through dark places. Even as believers, we go through sometimes dark places. And then all that needs to take place is that the Lord Jesus Christ comes and manifests himself. &gt;&gt; To manifest himself is to appear. To appear. He appears to you. He comes to you in your situation. to manifest himself &gt;&gt; is not only to appear. But this word manifest, I want to get this nailed down before we go any further. To manifest means openly, something that is openly, but it's not just openly. To manifest is openly plus to be known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that you come to know. So it's not just something that becomes visible but now it becomes personal knowledge to you appear and it appears openly but it's more than that to manifest is also something that is spread abroad. It's not something that's hid in a corner. If the Lord manifest himself to you in salvation, one thing for sure, you can't keep it a secret &gt;&gt; because it's meant to be spread abroad. &gt;&gt; And not only is it to be spread aart broad, but it's to be it it is to be plainly recognized or known. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it comes from a part of the word in the Hebrew in the Greek rather is not only to appear but it is something that shines. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if it shines it comes from the base word light foss that's where we get it. Phosphorus light a light. And when light comes things appear. I don't want to get into it but &gt;&gt; many times because I've been a man of actually was talking to my wife yesterday relating a little bit just of our youth to each other even parts of our youth we don't really know that much about each other but uh I spent so much of my time I just started to relate the different places where I lived and and where I lived it was just wilderness I And I'm not talking about any wilderness that you know about. I'm talking about wilderness where nobody lives. I'm talking about absolute wilderness. You know, your friend has to be some wild animal pretty well. There just nobody around. That was that was wilderness. And uh I've been lots of times when you know you want to scurry home quickly because you know it gets dark in the winter time. it gets dark and gets dark early in the afternoon, maybe 4:00, it's already starting to get dark and uh you know, young fellow, you're trying to make home and I hope the moon will come out so it'll shine on the snow. So, as I wasn't really fussy about the dark, still not too fussy about the dark. And the reason why I'm not too fussy about the dark is I like to see things clearly. I don't want to have a question, what is that up there? Spiritually speaking, nothing could be worse. &gt;&gt; I wonder about that and I wonder about this and I wonder that's why I was so glad when the message came. &gt;&gt; I didn't know I didn't know whether we're going through the tribulation or we weren't going through tribulation or are we going halfway up or is it three years or is it seven years? And I wasn't too sure, you know, here I am going to baptize some people. Got them already baptized. I'm not too sure how I should baptize them. I like to see things. I like to know. I like to have an absolute. So I haven't got any question anymore. Oh, how the shadows flew away. How the darkness left when the message came. How we thank God for the light, the glorious light, and it shone upon thee. Don't live in shadows. Don't live in darkness. Don't live with your mind clouded with questions. An absolute has come. And even though the absolute came and the light shone in the time of Jesus when he came, there were people that wouldn't accept the light. &gt;&gt; So what happened to them? They continued in darkness. The light was manifested. And the apostle said, "And our hands handled it." &gt;&gt; But also Nicodemus said, "We know." Because that's what it is. Light appears. It appears so that people can know. He said, "We know you're a teacher sent from God, but they still were living in cloud and shadow and darkness, and they didn't receive it. One of the things that Brother Brandon was talking about, and I'm just going to take you quickly. I I I wished I'd had enough time, but time has been very very uh very pressing in the last few weeks. But brother Brandham spoke of the uh he spoke of the church and its condition and the season, the time that he was in. He talked about the council of churches and he talked about Rome and he talked about how things would get to come together. But I'm just going to take you through a quick sequence. in 1954. Now you know in 1954. Now you know that the World Council of Churches just had their first little gathering. It was just an exploratory type of thing. Some great theological leaders had gathered and thought even prior to 1948. They gathered and thought it would be good if we could get great religious leaders and start coming together and they thought that union would be uh a marvelous thing. So they spoke about it uh and it didn't really happen until 1948. But in 1954, brother Brandham says, "The assemblies of God," now that was the Pentecostal Assemblies of God has gone into the council of churches. This is actually a prophecy. He said, "Which is the" And he stops. He said, "They just they just hooked theirel right up yonder with the old mother harlot." It's 1954 before an awful lot of this congregation was born. So every church organization comes to comes from Rome and there's the mother of it. I mean this that men and women should be free in Christ Jesus to walk in light. &gt;&gt; Do you think there was many people that understood what he was saying then? No. I would say none. I say that sincerely. I would say none really recognized it then. They should be able to walk in light and every church should be the same thing and that is true. Then I I this is just some a little historical paragraph. When the second assembly of the world council of churches convened in Evston outside Chicago in August 1954. So I chose this because it's the same year two Pentecostal leaders were present because now this is just brother Bradam in 54 said they've already hooked in they've already joined in. The first meeting was 1948 and now in 1954 there's this this document is was put together and two Pentecostal leaders were present. The first was David Duploy, a South African who had immigrated to the United States in 1948. Duply had played a leading role in the development of the apostolic faith mission, the AMF in South Africa. And those of you that are here of South African background, and there are many of you, you're probably very acquainted with that. and certainly the AFM. He said he was editing the denominational bilingual periodical comforter, the magazine, and from 1936 to 1947 serving as general secretary of the AFM. In 1947, while working with the Pentecostal World Conference, which was the PWC, at Duploy began what would become a 40-year international ministry of building bridges between Pentecostals and acting as an independent spokesperson for the interpreter of the Pentecostal movement. This led him in 1952 to attend the meeting of the international missionary council in Willing, Germany, where his indefatigable apology for the Pentecostalism resulted in his nickname Mr. Pentecost. I was going to bring the book which is available in most bookstores, Mr. Pentecost, which refers directly to uh brother Duplo. Now, brother Duply, brother Brandham refers to him about 117 times in the messages and he talks about brother Duply my good friend brother Duply. Brother Duplo spoke and then brother Brandham comes into the healing line and he was on the platform with him and brother Duplo then then 1956 uh comes along and brother Brandham says the great council of of meeting not long ago I was asked yesterday to represent the s I was asked yesterday to represent the supernatural working of God before 600 and some delegates from all over the world if God carries until 1958 to be in Boston, Massachusetts. One of the ministers, a great man with a great uh general gospel, David Dupacy said, "Brother Brham, when all," now I want you to notice now here's a here's one of the founders of it. He said, 'Brother Brandham, when all the delegates of the world is gathered together and the Christian nations from everywhere is gathered together at this great world council, just the speaking of the word and the power to reveal the Holy Spirit coming present talking about his ministry is what they identified in his ministry. He said, he said, "Evangelicals from everywhere will sway in. And when they get a faith to live a real gospel, it'll close the Gentile dispensation and issue in the Lord's second coming. God can't God can't be just and let honest hearts lay out there and sizzle in hell for it. He's got to be just. He's got to get it to them somehow. were in the last day. This was the pressure that they were putting on the brother Brandham's ministry because he could recognize this ministry will bring the living Christ to the people, make it visible to them. And this is what they would need to sway them in. &gt;&gt; And bring in the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; They had it figured out. That is in 56. In 63, brother Brandham says, "And you Protestants, you're waiting waiting some big organ you're wanting some big organization to lead you over. Uh, I'm sorry. You're you're wanting some big organization to lead over you, run over you, to rule you." He said, "You'll get it." The World Council of Churches, how can David duplicate, my friend, ever on this ecumenical council that he's talking about and bringing them Pentecostal people into that in 1960 prior to that he said, I want you to just see, are you following me? The false church groups, this is 1960 now in a revelation of the church age series. The false church groups will come together in a world council of churches. This world council of churches is the image erected to the beast in 62. Now they're bundling them to burn them. That's true. They're getting bundled. All these organizations, big bundles, is coming into one big bundle. That's right. What is that bundle? You know what it is? World Council of Churches forming the image to the beast truly. And you people that scared of communism, do you realize I put this here? Now, a lot of you young people wouldn't know 1962 happened to be the height of the crisis of the of the cold war. It was 1962 there's an invasion. They planned an invasion of Cuba and Cuba had missiles on it from com from communist Russia and the Soviet Union had spread over large parts of Africa and China and great predominant parts of the world and it looked like they would sweep the world and stood and and uh uh there was radio broadcasts. I've listened to many of them and they cried out against the communism when it's sweeping the world. And it's only voice I know and the only voice I think you could ever find that stood up one little man and said it's nothing. Communism is nothing. It's only a tool in God hand. And when God's done with it and look what happened and people say they stand back and say, "Where did the Soviet Union go? How did it just fade away?" We don't know. America didn't know. The president didn't know how it just faded away. Well, it faded away because a prophet said it would. &gt;&gt; Said it would come to nothing. &gt;&gt; Here's something that you might pay some attention to. the Soviet Union, which was the USSR, which ruled a great part of the entire world and certainly was a a a superpower and one that made the West tremble. It came to its height really around 1962. Do you know that brother Brandham ne I can never f I have not found a place where he used the term Soviet Union. How does a man preach for all of these years and doesn't use the terminology that the whole world is using? The Soviet Union, the Soviet Union, the S USSR, USSR never made references and that's only how they were known. He always said Russia, &gt;&gt; Russia. And if you know anything about what's happening today, it's once again it's Russia. &gt;&gt; It's not the Soviet Union. So he was speaking back there of what it would be now &gt;&gt; clearly. Are you understanding me? You young people getting more than a history. When you have a prophet, you've got the future right there before you. It's more than tomorrow morning's newspaper. &gt;&gt; It's more than what the journalists can comprehend. And they wanted to know how it would fall, how it would how it how it could collapse the way it collapsed. Because a prophet said that every Jew of the 144,000 would have to be back in Israel and Russia would not let them go. So God demolished it. God brought them down to nothing because they had to let those Jews go. &gt;&gt; I stood in Israel and they said that they didn't know how many to expect to come from the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union. Do you know how many came? 720ome,000 uh people came, Jews came from those countries. It was just incredible. And they could not get out. But because that whole system wouldn't allow them out, God simply destroyed. They they went bankrupt. &gt;&gt; But Russia, not the Soviet Union, Russia is rising again. &gt;&gt; Russia's got a leader, a powerful leader, and he's brought them back to their pride. brought them back to where they're proud of themselves and their nation is rising economically and militarily very much militarily. So prophet knew exactly what he was talking about. So he didn't speak about things that were unimportant. But he says here and it is 62 they're bundling them to burn. They're getting them bundled. He said, 'You people that's scared of communism, I want to show you I want you to show me one place in the Bible where communism will rule the world. Well, he says, I'll tell you the Bible says that Romanism will rule the world. And that's exactly right. &gt;&gt; In the way of a true prophet, he said, look at our nation today. Look what we're trying to do. The very thing that took place in the dark ages. in the dark age, unite the church and state together. He said, look at the union or the world council of churches and all the churches going into this world council of churches. Now you see you folks didn't live in the dark ages. Oh my, I'm so glad we didn't live in the dark ages. Oh yeah, but you are. &gt;&gt; He said this union now is just the same as the dark ages. &gt;&gt; You would look around at you. you look around and see what is taking place. And I just started the little service this morning by saying we live in a very dark, chaotic time. Darkness, gross darkness according the prophet Isaiah's over the earth. But we're seeing it. &gt;&gt; We see it all the time. &gt;&gt; We're touched by it, are we not? If that is so, here's the clincher. If that is so, I would say that nations such as America and Canada, Britain, and those that claim to be Christian nations and those are Christian nations of Europe and the nation is supposed to be Christian nation. I will say I'll go on record of saying if that is so the Christian nations the church has miserably failed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can the church have such freedom such liberty and broadcast their gospel everywhere and let let darkness come in? &gt;&gt; Where does this darkness came in? Because they refused the light. &gt;&gt; There is no other answer. They refused the light and the darkness came in. There is no light to press the darkness back out where it belonged. That's why the churches wherever they are, the world has come in. The world has come in. Darkness has come in. Sin has come in. Worldliness has come in because the light has been refused. And though and that that speaks on an international level, speaks on a global level, but that speaks also on a church level. And it speaks on the home level. If the home doesn't have the light in it, the world will come in. And if you don't keep the light in receiving the light, the light that God has sent in your own heart, vibrant in your own heart, I can announce to you in a prophecy, the world will come in &gt;&gt; and you'll have trouble &gt;&gt; and you'll stumble and you'll question and you'll wonder, "Why isn't it working?" It's not working because you're refusing the light. &gt;&gt; There's only one light. Pay attention now this morning. &gt;&gt; There's only one light. &gt;&gt; You need to receive the light, the engrafted word, the manifested word for this time. &gt;&gt; That's why people who go by what they think. Oh, I think this, I think that, I reason this. I believe that. I don't care what you think. Your what your thought is is never going to bring light into my soul. I receive thus sayaith the Lord and that brings light into my soul and that presses the darkness back where it belongs. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're glad the darkness has been pressed back. &gt;&gt; People can say whatever they want to say. You know what they say about our church? I don't care what they say about our church. &gt;&gt; I don't care what they say about it. One thing I know, we're seeking to walk in the light as we see it in the word of God. Preach it the way the prophet preached it. Hallelujah. And it presses the darkness back where it belongs. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People that aren't a church this morning that could be a church. Oought to be a church. You know where they are? &gt;&gt; They're in a They're in a very dangerous place because darkness starts pressing in. God speaks of an individual heart and they know they ought to make that right. They ought to go to that brother, ought to go to that sister, ought to go to that husband, ought to go to that wife, parents to the parents of the children or children to the parents. And to hold back, hold back. Let me tell you what happens. Darkness, &gt;&gt; shadows start to come in &gt;&gt; and you can't see clearly how to walk. &gt;&gt; The light is here, &gt;&gt; but you need to let the light shine. And when you let the light shine, &gt;&gt; oh how blessed it is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I won't go on in this but I have it right up till 1996 here where the Pentecostal world council there was three great leaders duplic and a man by the name of flowers. Those are the three great leaders of the whole Pentecostal movement that brought the Pentecostal movement into the world council of churches and uh and uh re Reverend G or Dr. G he was from England and at the very first meeting in 1948 he just went into remorse that Pentecostal that Pentecostal leaders weren't there said to think that they had this great and grand and glorious opportunity and we weren't even represented there and he was despondent about that and it writes about that but these three men had it as a personal mission that they must bring pen Pentecost into the World Council of Churches. Now, get the picture. It's the same as reading in the Bible. Elijah's right with the king. Ahab's going one direction. Elijah screaming against him. &gt;&gt; The leaders that were with wanting they're all in favor of Elijah and all of their prophets of the all prophets of the king and all of it and all screaming one thing and and and one prophet is standing up, one voice saying, "You're going the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; God won't bless it." And there's there he is representing the light. The very word coming out of the prophet's mouth that is the light. And they're determined to reject the light and go on into their darkness and go into their idolatry. Here stood here is here here stood the prophet of this day on the platform crying out. And there was David Dupy sitting right on the platform and wanting to bring this gift and wanting to bring this ministry. Oh, if we could just bring this in my it is so powerful. It is so perfect. It will sway them all in. &gt;&gt; And he's telling them it's the image of the beast. &gt;&gt; It's the image. It's going to bring people into darkness. &gt;&gt; Look where it is. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, don't take it lightly that God by grace has brought you. You're not just sitting in a church this morning. You're not just hearing a little preacher preach. You want to thank Almighty God that he ever opened up your eyes and your understanding and gave you a revelation. If it wasn't for that, you'd be out there, too. &gt;&gt; It's nothing good that we've done. It's God's grace upon us. &gt;&gt; Look at the darkness you'd be in. &gt;&gt; Look at where you'd be. But where your Catholic people would be &gt;&gt; and a home I was born in trying to make me kiss idols when I was a little child. I thought it was so foolish me kiss this wooden idol. It was so strange. But the the Just think where we'd be. &gt;&gt; Think where you'd be. Pentecost &gt;&gt; featuring some glamorous celebrity or whatever more having some rock band on the platform. Think where you'd be. Think what you'd be diving to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They talk about rock. We got the rock. &gt;&gt; We got the rock of re revelation. &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah. Flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my father which is in heaven hath revealed it unto thee. Therefore, you can rejoice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hiding some of your faces. I want to look down your face. &gt;&gt; They said that Morty more than 30 30 uh persons attended the meeting. This particular meeting in Costa Rica. Separate statements were issued by Pentecostals from North and South America and representatives of the World Council of Churches following a joint meeting in San Jose from 4 to 6th of June of 1996. And they were organized. It was organized by the world council of churches office of ecumenical relations. And the conferences. The conference came from a conferies rather came from 11 Pentecostal groups in the United States and in Latin America and from historic Protestant and Orthodox members. historic Orthodox and and and uh Protestant members of the World Council of Churches and they said they summarized and through the power of the Holy Spirit we also explored common areas in which our Christian faith is bringing us closer together. They concluded we the response of the participants from the world council of churches members churches said this. We conclude this meeting in a spirit of rejoicing realizing that our time together has changed our views of our Pentecostal sisters and brothers and has begun to erase the stereotypes that we have held. Earnestly hoping Pentecostals will be present at the future meetings of the World Council of Churches. For without their presence, something crucial will be missing. We recognize that there are differences in the experiences, theological views, and social outlooks of the persons who gathered here this week. But the WCC has always been a richly diverse fellowship. And we regard our diversity as one of God's most precious gifts. One of these great leaders said that we might fulfill the prayer of Jesus that they might be one. That's not the prayer of Jesus. How can a man who's a the a theologian miss the prayer &gt;&gt; that they might be one as thou art the as thou as as God and me are one. &gt;&gt; That was his prayer. &gt;&gt; Not just that they would be one. But he wanted that oneness and unity to be the same as as Christ who was the word revealed the father dwelling in him. I want them to be one as you and I are one. &gt;&gt; That's the prayer. &gt;&gt; Not that we'll be one in one great gathering of of &gt;&gt; denominational churches. &gt;&gt; That wasn't it at all. &gt;&gt; So, here stands a prophet way ahead of the time. Says they're bundling them up. They're being bundled up now. &gt;&gt; Taking it back to the scripture. Gather the tears first &gt;&gt; into bundles &gt;&gt; for the burning. &gt;&gt; Can't get much clearer, can it? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I I have so much that could be said. I want to I'm just going to leave that for what it is for you. That's darkness &gt;&gt; on the international level. And the light was there and the light was rejected and it went into darkness. And there's no there doesn't have to be a question in our mind. Why are things the way they are? They are the way they are because the light has been refused. And let it be known to this congregation and all who are streaming or will stream through the archives. Let it be known that principle cannot be changed. Whether it be on a global level or whether it be on a national level in a country, whether it be on a local church level, whether it be in the home or whether it be in an individual level. If we don't lay hold of the light and reverence the light and embrace the light and receive the light inwardly, &gt;&gt; then darkness creeps in. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said one place it just had a little light bulb. He says this this this light right here is keeping the darkness pressing it and keeping it outside. And I'd say this light that we have, this light that we revel in, this light that we receive through the engrafted word is pressing the darkness till it's on the outside. And and you and I can sit in our little enclave of protection under the under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and we see all this darkness. Don't be don't be affected by it and don't be afflicted by it. You can recognize that it's there, but don't be affected by the fact that it's there. &gt;&gt; May I go on? Amen. &gt;&gt; The scripture says concerning Christ that in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only son, begotten son into the world that we might live through him. He was manifested. He was brought to appear. And I could not describe for you. I could I it's impossible for me to be able to convey to you how how many times and how profound the prophet put it in such a profound way that his entire ministry was a manifestation of Jesus Christ in the earth &gt;&gt; and if it and if we don't come to that we miss the whole thing we miss the whole potency of the of the word, his very calling, his very ministry, the separating him out from all the rest was for one purpose that he could manifest. He had to come out of obscurity because Jesus came out of obscurity. He had to speak the kind of English he spoke because Jesus spoke the Galilean language which was a gut poor language. He had to start with a simple humble ministry because the son of man Jesus Christ started with that started with some miracles. Outstanding miracles started with outstanding miracles. Gathered great multitudes of people as Christ gathered great multitudes of people. And they gathered and they wondered at the gracious words that were coming from the lips. And they gathered for the signs and the wonders. And they gathered both then and now at the same time. And then at some point in Jesus ministry, he begins to say strange things. At Mount 1958, the prophet decided it was time or God decided it was time through him to identify how sin came in Eden. In 1958, he preaches the serpent seed and the people said such strange doctrine. And the people began to leave and the message came stronger. It came stronger with Christ, stronger here, stronger here until until it finally came where the Lord Jesus Christ himself was completely rejected. And the prophet was completely rejected. He said, "I've been here in Arizona for 2, three years and there's no door been open." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I rejoice in it because it's the same pattern, &gt;&gt; the same God manifesting himself in the same way. &gt;&gt; And finally, the Lord Jesus is left just with his handful of people, &gt;&gt; completely rejected. The same thing was here, just a handful of believers. Many here didn't see what was happening. The disciples didn't understand it. They did. We didn't understand it back then. And he talks about going. Brother Brandham talks about the rapture and the coming and the resurrection. Jesus talks about it in the garden rather in the in the in the upper chamber and then he has communion and goes. Brother Bram talked about the rapture, how the resurrection was going to be and has communion and goes. &gt;&gt; How does a man set up that pattern? &gt;&gt; How does any human do that? It's not human. It's divine. &gt;&gt; And if you accept it as something divine, then light will come to your soul. &gt;&gt; And you'll not worry so much about all the little things of this life. I say to you, forget these things. Get whatever education you need to get. Work at whatever job you need to work. But remember, it's not an important issue in this life. We've got one important goal and that's a prize that is set before us. Eternal life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What have we gained the whole world here and lose our own soul? What have we attained to nothing? And thus Jesus could declare and did declare. I'm going to move as quickly as I can, but you help me. &gt;&gt; Stay on alert, please, and attentive. He declared, "I am the light of the world, &gt;&gt; and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, &gt;&gt; but shall have the light of life." Amen. &gt;&gt; He said again, "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world." &gt;&gt; John said, "That was the true light which lightth every man that cometh into the world." He was that light. &gt;&gt; And he said, furthermore, ye are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he knew it wasn't going to be just God above us &gt;&gt; or God with us, but he knew it was going to be God in us. &gt;&gt; That light would be transferred. You become the light. &gt;&gt; In other words, you're the answer. &gt;&gt; You're the answer for somebody who's next to you. &gt;&gt; You're the answer &gt;&gt; for your home, for your family. &gt;&gt; Should not bring more confusion. Should just bring more light. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist, Jesus said, was a great shining light. He said he was a burning that is set on fire. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm talking about light and fire. &gt;&gt; He was a burning set on fire and a shining light. He wasn't just a shining light. He was a burning and a shining light. &gt;&gt; He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost. Not just with the Holy Ghost, that is light, but with the Holy Ghost and fire. &gt;&gt; Say the word fire. &gt;&gt; That's your portion. Amen. &gt;&gt; Light and fire &gt;&gt; is your portion. That light may strike your soul. Say, "Wow, this is so glorious." Hallelujah. Just remember just down the road, maybe tomorrow or in the next 24 hours or the next week, you're going to come into one of the most difficult times of your life. You might say, "I never dreamed I was going to have this." Filled with the Holy Ghost, and this is what I come into. Yes, darkness presses against it, but the light that you have and the light that you receive keeps pressing the darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hear it now. That's a lifelong experience. &gt;&gt; That's a lifelong experience. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get you ready for your walk with God and say, "When is this over?" Never. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, how do I how do I compensate? How do I handle this? Get stronger. have more light. &gt;&gt; It's not you that drives the darkness out. The light drives the darkness out. &gt;&gt; Feed on the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hear what has been spoken. I receive the light &gt;&gt; of this hour. &gt;&gt; I have been troubled in the last two, three, four years. I've been troubled. And the thing that I have been troubled about is this that the people even in other countries and in our own country are not taking full making full advantage of the message that they have to them. It's some books or some tapes. It's not. Let me change that. What have I said? There on your shelf is the revealed light &gt;&gt; that can drive the darkness that you're experiencing out of your life. &gt;&gt; In that word, &gt;&gt; which will make this Bible alive. &gt;&gt; That prophet's message was sent to make this word live. &gt;&gt; And when this word lives, light comes. &gt;&gt; When light comes, darkness leaves. When light comes, the shadows are gone. When light comes, you can see things as you ought to see them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're not worried. You're not scared about some boogeyman. &gt;&gt; You're not scared of about some ghost &gt;&gt; or something that looms up. &gt;&gt; You're not scared of the devil that just come oh come comes roaring your way. You just say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, boo. I don't fear you. &gt;&gt; I don't fear you. &gt;&gt; You come, you think you're going to take my life. I don't fear you. &gt;&gt; I have the perfect light, &gt;&gt; the divine light &gt;&gt; of the revealed, manifested word of God. &gt;&gt; Manifested word. &gt;&gt; It's appeared. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not just enthused, friends. The light appeared. Thus, you appeared. I've appeared on the scene. I've appeared into my community. When you walk down the street, I think of one brother that was here and he was got on 18747 aircraft flying I think from Singapore up into Moscow and from Moscow over here and he bowed his head to pray. When he bowed his head to pray over his food, he thought, "How fortunate everyone on this plane is, that I'm here, that I can pray over my food. They're the safest aircraft there is." &gt;&gt; You say, "My," he thought a lot of himself. No, his confidence was in God who he's praying to. I'm praying I know my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. John then said, "I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me, he is mightier than I, whose shoes I'm not worthy to bear, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire." Many of you that are even seated here today within the sound of my voice, you've had questions. And the question is always with a shadow. Do I have the Holy Ghost? Don't I have the Holy Ghost? If I have the Holy Ghost, what did I get? What should I have had? What kind of feeling I had? I didn't have any feeling. I didn't have any emotion. Do I have it or don't I have it? And you got that question. I won't have you raise your hand. Lots of you have come to me over the years said, 'Well, what should I have? Brother Brandham even said to one woman, you know, he prayed that the Lord would give her speaking in tongues because she seemed like her faith needed something to be anchored in so she would have some evidence. The evidence of the Holy Ghost is that the life of Christ, the life of Jesus Christ, not as you read of it in a history book, &gt;&gt; not as you read of it as something that happened 40 years ago, but the very life of Christ start to live in you. &gt;&gt; I was saying as we came out, I wrote it on here. Oh, make me more like thee, Lord. Make me more like thee. I want to I want to be like him. &gt;&gt; Not just a lowly Nazarene that walked on the shores of Galilee, but when my when my those are people that don't like me, those people who don't like you and when you hear things that are said or things erupt within your family, that's when you want to say, "Make me more like you, Lord. Make me more like you. How should I respond? What should I say? What should I be doing? How can I be a better father? How can I be the kind of husband I ought to be? I am the spiritual leader in the home. Am I the spiritual leader? I am to be the spiritual leader. God, show me how I'm be a spiritual leader. That ought to be the prayer of every husband. Show me what kind of a man I ought to be. Let that very life of Christ come into me and make me the kind of person, oh, I'm not going to put up with with all the little excuses of when I was kind of born that way or I had this kind of a background. Whatever more had people say, well, I never had love shown to me. I never said it to my wife. I don't believe I I've said it in public ever. So, I never thought about it. We're not here to talk about brother Ed Biscll but I can't remember a time in my life and I do remember back when I was three and four years old I remember quite clearly I don't remember a time either my mother even though she was a very very wonderful woman just about she probably did I don't remember a time ever having and my stepmother of course it was she was wasn't that kind of a woman never never show any feeling at all. Here I go for the fourth time. I never remember a time anybody ever putting their arms around me and embracing me and saying, you know, you're my son and love you and here to help you and here to be with you and you know that phrase, I'm here for you. You know, it might be wonderful. You got parents that do that. You young people do that to your parents. God bless you. But I don't have any I don't have any sympathy for somebody said, "Well, I never had that. You know, nobody ever showed me any love and I don't know how to show love." I say, "Nonsense. &gt;&gt; Absolute nonsense. Just grow up and face God's word and say, "God sent me to be a light here. God sent me to manifest Jesus Christ and what he is, I am." &gt;&gt; We are as He is in the world. We never had this. We never had that. Hey, look, look at the people in the scriptures. They didn't have a lot of things. But when they were born of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; they're new creatures in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's not what my mother and dad did for me. It's what Christ did for me. &gt;&gt; We've missed a lot of things in life, but we've gained everything. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I want you not to forget this message. I want you to remember it. We're new creatures in Christ Jesus. We're not here what our earthly parent left us. We're here what our heavenly parent left us. Glory to God. May this church rise in the name of Jesus Christ into the heights of the heavenlies and be the kind of man, the kind of women, the kind of young people that God has ordained and spoke of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This message was not a simple thing. This message didn't come cheap. &gt;&gt; This message cost a servant everything he had. &gt;&gt; May we respect it with honor. &gt;&gt; May we say it came. It came for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Came that the word would be manifested me, &gt;&gt; transforming me into the light of this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When it says that he was a shining, just be a few more minutes. Can I please just a few more minutes? Says he was a shining. He was a shining set on fire and a shining light. A burning and a shining light. John the Baptist was. Don't forget that was Elijah's spirit. Spirit of Elijah is a burning &gt;&gt; and a shining light. &gt;&gt; He that cometh after me. &gt;&gt; He, not the earthly angel, but the heavenly one, &gt;&gt; not Revelation 10:7, but Revelation 10:1. He that cometh after me shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire. And so the earthly messenger told us how to be baptized. &gt;&gt; If you have not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, be baptized in his name. For you're baptized into his life, his death, his burial, and his resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's thus, sayith the word of God. &gt;&gt; Nobody needs to sit here and question about that. If you question it, immediately a cloud comes in. Immediately the darkness settles on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; When it says it's the word of God, say those same things. That's the word of God &gt;&gt; because it's the word of God. That's what I believe. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham draws it in a drama. said, "And John the Baptist standing there in the water just just to put it in reality, his feet probably down in the mud squeezing between his toes standing there and he sees Jesus coming. Behold the lamb of God &gt;&gt; that takes away the sin of the world." Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus walks up to him says, "I have need to be baptized of thee." Said, "Comest out of me. I need to be baptized of thee." Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so now, for thus it behooveth us to fulfill all righteousness." Brother Brandham puts it this way. And Jesus walked straight to the water to him. And those two eyes of John met the two eyes of Jesus. He said, "Oh, how I'd love to be there. How I'd love to have been there." He said, "Another place." Those deep set eyes. Of course, you know, Brother Brandham had deep set eyes. those deep set eyes of John the prophet the Baptist standing in the water when those eyes met the deep set eyes &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; I tell you what &gt;&gt; friends &gt;&gt; this the scripture says about the shining it's to meet the eyes to bring forth light but to meet the eyes and to strike the sight when those deep that eyes of John the Baptist with the spirit of Elijah met the eyes of the Lord Jesus Christ. I can tell you that light struck just struck. Oh, something happened. And John, he said, "Let it be so now, for thus it behooveth us to fulfill all righteousness." And then John took him. Oh, he said they were second cousins. What an event that must have been when they looked at each other's eyes. They didn't have to say, they didn't have to preach a sermon, but that look, you're the word, John. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the prophet must come to the word. And John had said, "You're the lamb." And he knew and he looked and the sacrifice must be washed. And then he took him and baptized him. I suggest when the very life of Christ comes into you as a believer, it'll begin to shape your life, begin to shape your vessel. I want to convey this to you so badly. I'm just seeking God, help me to bring this down to you. Life is filled with pressures. Life is filled. This world, friends, is a dark place &gt;&gt; and we become accustomed to it. I was in a meeting downtown c downtown Vancouver one day, East Vancouver. And at that time there was a lot of people just uh they had been in the hippie movement and they kind of were out. It had kind of faded away a bit, but there were still a lot of young people around and people that weren't so young anymore, probably in their 30s, late 20s and 30s. They'd moved out of their homes and everything. maybe during the hippie movement when they were in their teens or late teens. And this young man, I would guess he's probably 27, 28. My girls were there. Don't know whether we sang that night or not. And this fell came up and his eyes were a glow. You could see that God had done something for him. He had a full beard and his hair was all fuzzed out and you wouldn't have paid much attention to him maybe on the street, but there was just something about his face. You could see that God had done something. There was a real clear sparkle in his eye. We begin to speak about spiritual things. And there was a little thing at that time that you know my daughters they thought that only those who had been in sin and experienced the depth of sin and been in drugs and been in all that you know the devil comes to that said well you know you can't really rejoice like them because they've had such a dramatic change and you haven't had that you're just kind of born into it and you know you born in a Christian home and and you haven't experienced that. So you, the devil tried to tell you, you can't have the same level of joy because they've been delivered from so much. And I know what Jesus said. He that was forgiven of much loves much. But he looked at one of my daughters, I think maybe two of them, and he said, "The God, the God that keeps is greater or just as great as the God who delivers and saves." &gt;&gt; Now, the God that kept you from it is the same God that delivered me from it. &gt;&gt; And I thanked him for that. I thought that was wonderful. That was such a a piece of wisdom. And then he kind of looked past us and it was like his eyes I could see in his eyes that he was going someplace else. And he said, "I've been in such dark places." I never forgot that from that day to this. I've been in such dark places. Oh, maybe you have, too. How thankful. I want you to be able to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Think of the bondage. I'd like every person to think of where you might be right today on September the 23rd, 207. Where you might be today if that light hadn't come your way. And I can say with some good authority, a good number of you would already be six feet under. Right. &gt;&gt; A good number of your homes would long ago have been broken. &gt;&gt; And there had been children torn aunder. &gt;&gt; A whole lot of you, all the rest of us would be in bondage one way or another to one system trying to ek out some kind of spiritual fulfillment. But here we are today. Oh, thank you, God. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father. Thank you for the manifested word. Thank you for this light. Thank you for this glorious light. &gt;&gt; We love you for this glorious light. &gt;&gt; And we'll walk in this light. Dear Lord Jesus, there just nothing more to say. I have so much more. Just a beginning on my notes, but it's the notes are not what's important. &gt;&gt; It's your presence. your spirit and what you're seeking to do. And I believe Lord with the worship and the praise and the thanksgiving of the people that must bring such a sense of satisfaction to your heart. Oh Lord, I want you to be pleased. Be pleased in this gathering. Be pleased in this service, Lord, in the simplicity of this message. Be pleased, Lord. I'm I'm going to thank you publicly for the message that you sent through your messenger. I thank you, oh God, every time we've heard, thus sayeth the Lord. Thank you, Lord, for the very message and the very opening of the word that has turned so many others aside, it is what drew us to you, oh God. And this light is so glorious. It is so bright. It is such brilliance as your prophet said it blinds others but it gives us sight. Oh thank you Lord. Thank you Lord for the sight. Thank you for manifesting yourself the vindication of your word. Thank you Lord for making it evident causing it to appear. And because you appeared we have appeared. You brought us on the scene for a purpose and we're here to fulfill that purpose. Lord, I say, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." We want to praise you now. I'll have you stand with me. We'll stand together. I want you to be free to express to say what you have in your heart to him. I'm going to sing the only chorus that I think we can sing. We'll walk in the light. It's a beautiful light. Think about what what's been spoken now. Think about the message as you just sing these words. Not as you've sung it before, but as part, let's make this course a part of the message. We'll walk in this glorious light. [Music] will walk in the light. Oh, it's a new beauty. Oh, come in the cross of mercy. [Music] &gt;&gt; Mean it now. &gt;&gt; Shine all around us. And our life Jesus the world [Music] will walk in the light. [Music] Oh, come [Music] of mercy [Music] [Applause] and shine all around us. My day and my Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Isn't he lovely? We love him. We love him. Oh Lord Jesus, we love you as a congregation of people. We love you. Lovely Lord Jesus. You just begin to say it. You begin to express it. You see what'll happen. Do you have some shadows that need to go away? Just say, "I'm here, Lord, to step into this light." It won't be if we walk in the light as you're in the light. It will be I will walk in the light. As you are in the light, we will have fellowship one with another. Oh, in the blood of Christ, you got some you got some things, some question. Oh, God, we do fail. We do commit wrong. We do things we don't we're sorry for. We want to say it now. Lord, [Music] &gt;&gt; just remove that from me. &gt;&gt; We all do. Remove that from me. Lord, let the light now permeate within and press all the darkness back out. [Music] &gt;&gt; Blessed Lord Jesus. We'll walk in The light it's a glory [Music] [Applause] [Music] shine all around us and Jesus. the light of the world. You know, I spoke two messages on the influence and I don't know how this is going to fit, but it just comes back to my mind. I've been trying to I've been trying to end the last two services with this. Do you remember the man brother Brandham hunted with? Said he had lizard eyes. Bert was his name. He was so hard. He was so hard. Nothing could touch him. I want you to think real deep now at the end of this service. as I'm desiring that your heart will be very very touched and moved in this presence as we prepare for the afternoon service in the Lord's table. Bird hunted with the prophet. Bird hunted with brother Brandham. He was able to see his nature. He was able to see his character. He was able if he was if it was possible to be touched by this man. He knew all kinds of preachers. He knew all kinds of believers. None of them. Nobody affected him. [Music] And then come this occasion and he he uses that injured or that baby fawn deer call and out comes this big dough deer. Walks right out into the open just a few feet from them. Turns her ears around. Where is that baby? And brother Brandham said he raised his gun that Bert did and was holding it. Brother Bram said he couldn't look. He said, "Blow the heart of that beautiful mother dear out of her." She's still standing there. He said she saw them. Didn't pay any attention to them. She only had one thing on her mind. That was that baby. And brother Brandham didn't hear the shot. Didn't hear the shot. And he looked up and he sees the gun barrel begin to tremble and finally throws it down. Brother Bram said he fell down, grabbed a hold of brother Brandham, said, "Lead me to this Jesus." I got thinking that man's heart was so distant and so hard and so callous and so whatever more but a mother dear preached him a sermon &gt;&gt; just by being what she was supposed to be &gt;&gt; and many of you you might think oh you have to be up here and brother Ed brother Diddy brother Lance Brother Tom brother John whoever it is listen friends we're only servants we're just trying to create an atmosphere just trying to bring you. Oh, it just desires so much. I thought, "Oh, God, if that animal &gt;&gt; could influence that man &gt;&gt; and cause his heart to break and and and actually cause him to come to Christ just through that simple manifestation of her own nature where her nature was ahead of her fear." We've all got fears. We've also all got questions. But let that nature that God has given you rise above that and press all that out. You're going to affect somebody else that's beside you. You're going to affect your home. I don't like to think that we preach as hard as we preach and seek God and then see people just remain the same when they go out. May our lives be changed. May our homes be changed. May it be transformed. You have something greater than a deer. You have the Holy Spirit. Do you have the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Jesus, the light of the world. As your personal confession now will walk in the light. [Music] us mercy our shine all around us and Jesus the light of the world I'm going to pray. And if you have or have a desire to be included in this prayer in some way, I'm going to pray for every person that God has touched and spoken to in a special way, that God has spoken to perhaps specifically that you will now just hold that in your heart and let God answer it. Let God, if you've been dwelling in some shadows that you know he doesn't want you to walk there in the shadows anymore and questions, just let go of them. Let go of them. I know he loves you and I love you and I believe you love me and we come on that basis. Dear father, dear gracious father, loving father, our heavenly father, one who loved fatherhood so much that you you came and dwelt in your son and there was a such a relationship there. Oh God, looked down and a voice even would cry out from heaven. This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. Father, we find ourselves in this at this time at this junction of time and it was not our own choosing that we would come at this time. It was not our own choosing that we would come when the temptations of the world are so so pressing upon the people and upon our young people. Sometimes I marvel, oh God, as I see them sit here on these front seats and they honor you, oh God, by service after service. Father, may I ask that the Holy Ghost come upon them and fill them once again this morning. Give them what is needful for tomorrow and the next week and the future days. Give them, oh God, what is needful for them. Strengthen them and help them, oh God, in this time. I pray for our families. Lord, we're struggling in a economic time when uh everything seems to be at at such a rate and things are so expensive and the fuel for the car to drive to church, the rent, the food, all of these things. These are surely the days of Noah once again buying and selling and trading and all of these things. And these are the days of Sodom. We see it everywhere. Oh, let the fire of God, let there be a wall of fire about us. When the enemy comes in like a flood, then the spirit of God will raise up a standard against him. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, accomplish your work. I pray in every heart and prepare us for the afternoon service. And while we're together and in one heart, we're praying for our brother Ron Spencer once again. Oh God, we bear him up and into your presence, oh God. And in your presence, the supernatural is happening. Uh let new skin, oh God, appear in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray it'll be so that they won't even have to graft it. Oh God, perhaps they've commenced, but Lord, bring new skin. Oh God, I pray that you'll be with the medical team. We thank you for what they do. But when man can do no more, that's just where you begin. Let his lungs become clear. Oh God, we thank you for ridding his body of this infection. Father, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. We thank you. We'll not hesitate to give you thanks. Oh, bless sister Connie. Lord Matthew, brother and sister Frasier, brother and sister Spencer. I pray you'll embrace those people in your love. Put your arms around them and may they feel a great the strength of the great eternal God. And Lord, we'll never never forget to give you thanks for your goodness. And now Lord, as we depart the sanctuary and have some refreshment to come back refreshed, I pray our conversation will be on spiritual things &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. Lovely name of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We're going to just dismiss you and as you leave quietly and reverently, we'll continue with our our song and then we're back here at 4:00 and give you time for some refreshment and then to get back. You are that are on the US side. I trust that you'll stay with us and have a bite to eat over here. Maybe you can invite someone that you see that's come from a long ways or across the border. Save them crossing the border and invite them to your home. We got a large assembly. We can certainly do that. We'll walk. Greet one another. Just greet one another. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Come where? [Music] &gt;&gt; I'll thirsty. [Music]
