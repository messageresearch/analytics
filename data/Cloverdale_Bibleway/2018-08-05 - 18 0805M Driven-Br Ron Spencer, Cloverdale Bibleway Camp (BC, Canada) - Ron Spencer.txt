You just want another drink from the fountain this morning. Could you stand together with me, please? There is a fountain open in the house of David. And this service is going just a little differently from how I even planned. The Lord knows what he's doing. Amen. There are needs that we need to remember. And this song just came to my mind. There's a fountain open. No, there's not just healing in that fountain. It's not just salvation. There's peace. There's joy. There's comfort. There's strength. Everything you have need of this morning, amen, can be found in that fountain. Amen. I just received a note to please remember the Floren family in prayer as brother Roy Florence mother just passed away back home this morning unexpectedly. I know our sister Kalista and sister Margaret are there right now and God knows what he's doing. Amen. Saints, let's remember the Florent family that you would just be a source of strength to them. Many years they've prayed for their family and God can use this time. Amen. To speak to the their loved ones. So let's just ask that God would be a comfort to them. Amen. and and we remember them as we sing the song. We're going to turn the pulpit to our pastor after a moment, but let's just continue to worship in this atmosphere. Amen. There's a fountain open. There is a fountain open in the house of David to you. Believe there are streams. There are streams of grace. flowing down from Calary. So come now receive. Sing the chorus again. There is a fountain. There is a fountain open in the house of David. praise from now. And we did have another prayer request. I'm sorry for my brother Henry Walder. He's asked us to please remember the daughter of a contractor that he works with. He is she is currently undergoing cancer treatment. And he told him that he would put in a prayer request to be remembering her this morning. Amen. I believe our pastor has some words for us and then afterwards we'll go to prayer. So let's just maintain this atmosphere even as our pastor speaks to us. And then brother Ed, would you like to? &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Ryan. Well, this is the last service here, but I just want to I'm impressed with decisions. Not only decisions that you have made, decisions that perhaps you are faced with, decisions that you will make. four of our young men and the young ladies that are here took a decision to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'll never forget when I took that decision and uh being a married man, I waited for my wife to take the same decision and then we were baptized. Uh, we had to take a decision to buy this camp. You were not here that day. And right behind you is a row of trees. And the authorities of Department of Transport had already taken a decision to take the trees and 30 ft of our playground the whole distance. And they had letters letters had come back and forth after we entered into an agreement to purchase. You didn't know anything about that. And I didn't know anything about you being here. I didn't know that this would be 10 years that we would be here since the purchase and 7 years before that we rented it. And 33 years today, 33 years we've had camp every year. Some of the brothers that are deacons and some that are on the platform were not here, were not believers, were not even saved then, but they took a decision at some point in life. And maybe somebody here is in the midst of making a decision. I want to give you some advice. speaking over this pulpit. I want to give you some advice. Make certain that it's a word decision and that you are say even if even if it costs me something, even if it costs me a better job, even if it costs me a better education. Brother Yonas, I see you standing here and we've observed you during the camp. And you made a decision, you and Hoppy, to become man and wife. And you are here. I want to tell you about your grandpa, brother Schumacher, who was he made a journey. He may took a decision to make a journey to the Ukraine and there saw a church that I had heard about and we had heard about and some of the parents of you young people took a decision to help to build that church. is I think the largest church in Europe holds about 700 people and they have war there now. But your grandpa, brother Yonas, took a decision to buy the pastor a van. He didn't have any vehicle and neither did he have a driver's license. Sometimes we have to make a decision that may not even make sense. But then once you make a decision for God's direction and for God's way and on behalf of the beckoning of the Holy Spirit and while the word is being preached today, Brother Tom took a decision to call brother Ron Spencer and he made a decision to come here. Friends, that's when God starts. He takes his part. I want to say one thing to you on all the authority of the scriptures. You make a decision for God, he will keep his part of the bargain. &gt;&gt; He will come on the scene. And I I stood in the snow out here just behind the tent and walked back and forth. And I was pained in my heart that we would lose one acre of land. And the Holy Spirit then dropped a dis dropped a question in my heart and said, "Ask this man a question. He's the headman of the Department of Transport." And I asked him, "Who are you making the decision for? Who are you taking this land? We our land here is just scarce. Scarcely enough for our young people. And if you're going to take an acre of land, you must give us an acre of land. go into the bush and bring your equipment from the bridge up here and take the bush away and bring dirt over and you must smooth out this land, this property. We can't just take these trees and he they even offered so much for us to build a fence. We'll bring the material and you'll have to put up a fence 30 ft in from these trees. And I said, "Who are you doing this for?" He said, "The Department of Fisheries, they do not have the power to take expropriate the land. The Department of Highways has the power." I said, "Do you need it then for the road?" He said, "No, we do not need it." He said, "So what you're saying is land for land?" I said, "Yes, I'm saying land for land." He said, "Then we're not carry it any further." and they sent us a letter and cancelled the whole thing. And I say, "Praise be to God." But I did not see you here. I did not hear your clapping. I did not hear Brother Ron Spencer preaching. We were just standing in the snow. Sometimes you have to make a decision. And you don't know what the future will hold. But I want to say to you, don't be afraid. Don't have any fear. Make the decision that you know in your heart is the right decision for God. And I have heard the preaching of the word and I have made decisions while I was standing here behind the preacher. And while brother Ron Spencer preached, I recognized it was more than a man speaking. &gt;&gt; God was speaking. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Man cannot speak to your heart and God speaks to our heart. And that's the time to say, "I'll follow you." &gt;&gt; I don't know what the future is, but I'll follow you. &gt;&gt; And I am so glad for the last 10 years. I'm so glad for the last 33 years. We're so glad that all of you are here. And I want to say welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And he who you decide, make your decision for him. Don't ever fail to make it for him. He will stand behind it. He will do more than you even expect. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I do believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're going to pray now and ask God's blessing upon you, upon the offering, and upon the requests that have been made. Father, I lay unworthy hands upon these requests. We think of the man, a contractor with cancer. We think of our brother uh Ber Cam Buer. Oh God, and what you have done and what you are doing. We believe that you are active by the Holy Spirit and by the virtue of the resurrected Christ. You are active today. You are fulfilling. There's a certain part of the scripture and you determined that there would be certain fulfillment and certain people and certain young people that are standing here will be the active part of that. I want to be active. Oh God, whatever your will is, we say thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. We thank you, Father, for those that are being baptized and for those that what our brother John will be doing baptizing. We pray that you will anoint, oh God, your servants, your ministers. Anoint our brother Ron Spencer. I pray to say the words that we desire. We're so thankful, oh God. You put it in brother Tom Ray's heart to invite him. We believe it was all in divine order. &gt;&gt; And we have seen you over and over and over again. One miracle after the other. And now we have a whole testimony of miracles last night. I say thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. And we what you have done we believe that you will continue to do for those that are needy. For the requests that have been made, it shall be done according to your will and that you might be praised. Bless the offering and the giving in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you, Brother Ryan. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. I'm just going to invite the Saskatchewan group. I believe Sister Melody. Thank you, brother Kelvin. The boys, I think some of the Hilderbrands are going to come and sing for us. Maybe they could just come and start getting ready at this time. Amen. Let's just sing um uh I will bless the Lord. I will bless the Lord with a heart of thanksgiving. Eflat. Yeah. With my hands lifted up and my mouth filled with praise and with the heart of thanksgiving. I will bless thee, oh Lord. I will bless thee, oh Lord. I will bless thee, oh Lord. I bless thee all with a heart of thanksgiving. I will bless thee, oh once again with my hands lifted up. Oh with my hands lifted up. Oh, and my mouth filled with praise with a heart of thanksgiving. I will bless thee, oh, I will bless thee. Yes, I will bless thee, oh Lord. I will bless thee, oh Lord, with the heart of thanksgiving. I'll bless thee all. bless you. Um, we just uh chose a song and it's an old song from the believers and someone asked yesterday if we did that because brother Menow was coming out and I Oh, I didn't even know he was here. So, it was good to see him. I don't know if he's here today or if he's gone home, but if he's still here, God bless you, brother Menow. And, uh, we've just enjoyed some of the songs that they sang over the years. So, we're going to sing this song for you. Brother Ram tells the story of the U magnet going over top of the factory and picking up all the all the uh pieces that weren't tied down. And the purpose of that story was to tell us to uh not be tied down to the things of this world. And that's what this song is about. And so, if we're still tied down to something, this morning is a good time to untie. Amen. I'm getting weary of this lonesome road I've every day I'm longing more to be with God just to live this world of sin in all it and to walk into a heavenly new life. There's a great magnet drawing from above. And there's nothing can hold me below. I'll rise to meet him in the air. When the final call comes for me to go, as I gaze into the starry sky above, how I marvel at the mighty works of God. Yes, we know he's living in my soul. He's the greatest youth anyone. There's a rain from above and there's nothing below. I'll rise to the air. When the final call comes for me to go to us. Oh, there's a great magnet from above. And there's nothing here below. I'll rise to meet him in the air. When the final call comes for me to go. When the final call comes for me to go. Amen. Thank you so much. It's been such a privilege to have all those who've been visiting with us. Just each life we've been blessed by and we want to thank you for making the journey to be with us. We love each of you. We don't get to spend the time fellowshipping as much as we'd like, but we do want you to know that we love you. We appreciate all of those who have come to be with us. Let's just sing God is good all the time. I'm going to ask those of the choir that sang with us. There is no one like our God. We'd like to sing that before we turn the service to our brother Ron. It's been on my heart and we had many, many specials and I just I'm sorry. I would love to fit everyone in, but I just feel that it's time to have another song and turn to the word this morning. We want brother Ron to have his liberty and take his time. This is our last service and then so maybe the choir could just come. We could have some help with the microphones. Maybe brothers, if you don't mind, as we sing God is good all the time. When you're walking, when you're walking through the valley and the shadows are all around, do not fear. For I know my God will guide you. He will keep you safe and sound. Lord, he has promised to never leave you nor forsake you. And in order truth, God is good all the time. He puts a song of praise in this heart of mine. My God is good all the time. Through the darkest night, his light still shines. God is good. My God is good. All the time we were sinners. Sing it together. We were sinners and so unworthy. But for us, he came to die. be filled up with hallelujah. His holy spirit standing that his love is everlasting and his mercy. It will never end. But is all the time puts a song of praise in this heart of my mind. God is good all the time. Through the dark night, his light still shines. God is good. Yes, God is good all the time. Amen. Let's start at E flat. We might sing it a little faster than we usually do. We want to rejoice this morning. This is not a special. I believe we have the words on the screen. Number 13:10. We want you to join with us. Amen. And it says in Isaiah, just to give you a little bit of the background, but now thus saith the Lord that created thee, oh Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, fear not, for I have redeemed thee. I have called thee. By thy name, thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee. And through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee. When thou walst through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. Thus saith the Lord, the King of Israel, and his redeemer, the Lord of hosts. I am the first and I am the last, and beside me there is no God. Hallelujah. There is no one like our God this morning. And let's worship him together as we prepare to hear the word this morning. Amen. He stretches the heavens. Do we have the lyrics on the screen? We do. He stretches the heavens like curtains before him. He forms every star. He calls him by name. He does not grow weary. His strength knows no way. The greatness of our God. None can comprehend. Who is like to our God? Who is like to our God? There's no one before him. There's no one beside him.

You identify with that God. No one like our God. Fear not, saith the Lord, for I have redeemed thee. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's sing it one more time as our brother Tom comes.

Before we invite Brother Ron Spencer, pastor Elton, Virginia. We love him. We appreciate the gift of God in him. We appreciate him bringing his son. And brother Andrew saying he would come. Amen. &gt;&gt; And minister such powerful messages to you young people. Are you thankful? &gt;&gt; I am indeed thankful. The Bible says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits. who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who health all thy diseases, who redeemth thy life from destruction. I would say this day, this scripture, &gt;&gt; has been fulfilled in your lives. &gt;&gt; And I just so thankful for what God's doing. We have four baptisms. &gt;&gt; Four baptisms. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Last night I was praying with a brother here in the front and I was just walking away and and brother Tim Dodd, he says to me, he says, "Brother Tom, Brother Tom, Brother Tom." And I look around and there's brother Gabe Reendroa looking at me and he'd been saying, "Brother Tom," thinking that I would miss him and tears streaming down his face. Said, "Oh, I want to be baptized. Brother Tom, &gt;&gt; I want to be identified in his death, burial, and resurrection. You want to see miracles? You're looking at a miracle. A young man under the pressure of life can make a decision. This is what I want. That's what camp's all about. We'll put up the tent and we'll do our activities and the sisters will labor in the kitchen. They have a part to play in what God is doing in the lives of our young people. Then before I could get out of the tent, Brother Max, Ivan ankle was waiting there. Brother Tom, Brother Tom, I need to be baptized. I said, "Brother Max, you're not going to believe this. I just left a young fellow that wants to be baptized." And then before I'm finished there, there's Brother Jed standing there. Ollo. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints, if you can't glorify God this morning, I don't. Something's wrong. GLORY. GLORY. Heaven rejoices over one. One, two, three. But God's not finished at the three. Melena Sherbov Makmood's Tanya's daughter. &gt;&gt; It's going to be baptized. &gt;&gt; To God be the glory. &gt;&gt; TO GOD BE THE GLORY. IF THIS gospel doesn't produce young people like you, then we need to throw it away. And people got a problem WITH THIS GOSPEL. I want to look at their lives. I want to look at their children. I want to see what they believe. They say, "Well, I got an intelligence and I understand God and don't have a family." I said, "This is the family of God." And this message is producing wonderful young people to carry this message. Amen. These are your benefits that you can draw from. Praise the Lord for our 10th anniversary. It's like brother Biscll said, "Well, 10 seems so small." I said, "But brother Ed, don't forget this is 33 years. This is 10 years that you had the vision that we'd have this camp." And I said at the beginning of junior camp, I baptized over 250, if not close to 300 young people in these 33 years. Praise our God. Mark the spot. Kings have come to battle. Music and hurt. He was there. Roll a stone away. This has been a camp of all camps and we want to thank God that he's come and visited our camp and brother Ron Spencer was gracious enough to say yes to come to the camp. Brother Andrew was gracious enough to say I want to come to that camp. You know what 10 means in the scripture? This is our 10th year. You know what 10 means? 10 means harmony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Harmony. &gt;&gt; Amen. 10 mean in the scripture it means completeness completeness and divine order and all I have seen from the beginning of camp to today the divine order of God harmony God and man becoming one &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said this and I sorry for de delaying the service a little bit he says now this person if you can get that into your soul young people so in harmony with God that your soul would be one together. Then you can ask anything you will and it shall be given you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You've had a testimony. You've had examples on this platform and now it's the challenge is it's you. &gt;&gt; It's harmony not just with the ministry. It's harmony with you. Brother Bram says if you can get harmony in your soul with God, united together as one, you can ask what you will and it shall be given you. How great is our God? How great is our God? &gt;&gt; Listen, young people, don't want to sleep on me now. This is going to be the capstone message this morning. &gt;&gt; You're going to pull on the word of God and watch God come behind the word of God for your life. You say, "Well, this is a Sunday morning. This is Sunday morning to give him all the praise and the glory." &gt;&gt; There is no God like our God. Our God is tremendous. &gt;&gt; I think we need to sing that to Brother Ron to let Brother Spencer know that we actually believe the God he preached about is tremendous in my life. I call on the Lord. He hears me and he has he been faithful and true for years. Bless his holy name. My companion. &gt;&gt; He's my best friend. &gt;&gt; He's my best friend. The only true God. There's no one greater. Oh, wonderful savior. My Jesus the lion of Judah. That's my God. His strength never fail. He go through the fire to save the sinner. Yes, he is mighty. He sent his angel. There is no fair. Our God cannot hand this city within you and me. The Christmas story. when you're in trouble. And when you're in trouble, Jehovah, the great enforcer, God Almighty, will fight your battles. Oh yes, he will stand for you. We know your victory will come. Not the way you think it should, but my great Jehovah. Just love the paradox. Just stay in your position and watch the miraculous come into action. Our God is tremendous. His strength never failing. Through the fire just to save a sinner. Yes, he is almighty. He sent his angels can guide me. There's no score that my God cannot handle. Our God in simplicity revealed in you and me came down from his glory and gave us the victory. The greatest when you're in trouble, young people, when you're in trouble, Jehovah, the great for sure, God almighty, he will fight your battles. Oh yes, he will stand for you. He will stand for you. Oh, not the way you think it should, but my great home. Just love the paradox. Just stay in your position and watch the miraculous come into action. My God is tremendous. His strength never fails.

Came down from his glory and gave us the victory. The glory. Hallelujah. It is the greatest love story. Amen. God bless you. God bless you. Maybe we could just talk to him just now. Maybe you have a need that you'd like to say, "I would like for him to pass by my way. my way and I would like to give thanksgiving for what he has done on this campground. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Almighty God, &gt;&gt; we give you glory. &gt;&gt; You are the worthy one, Father. &gt;&gt; And we thank you, Father, that we can stand here today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We ask you that Lord that you would give us grace, Lord. This is your people. This is all your plan. Lord, I just ask you now that you would come take every moment that has happened at this camp. &gt;&gt; It's been your plan. It's been your mind and your achievement. I pray that you would just bless every person and every effort that has went forth. Lord, from the ones that was the help behind the scenes, &gt;&gt; oh God, would you stretch forth your hand of mercy and strengthen them today? every counselor, every cook, Lord, every maintenance man, the ministry that is here. May you strengthen us today. And Father, it's very apparent that our bodies are war a bit. My voice is tired, but God, you're the one that does the work. Yes, &gt;&gt; and we ask you now that as we come to this last service, we dedicate it to you. &gt;&gt; And we ask you that you'd help us with this in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. And amen. Amen. Have you enjoyed it? &gt;&gt; I'd like to just share a scripture with you and then I want to share something special for you in just a moment. In Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 this morning I would like to speak to you on driven. Driven God deposited something on the inside of you that has life within itself &gt;&gt; and it actually drives itself. It has a life that will drive itself. And I'd like to speak about that just a bit if I could if the Lord would give me strength just now. Now, this is Jesus to his disciples and now to you. And after this manner, therefore, pray ye. Our Father, which are in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thou art the kingdom, for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever. Amen. You may be seated. God knows what he has deposited here today. He knows where we're going to go from to and what he's placed on the inside of us. 10 years ago, I stood in this platform and I begin to speak. I'd like to just sometimes sometimes we just like to take a moment back and see where we were and where we are and then what God is projecting. Some of you say, "Well, I've never seen a miracle or I've never seen predestination at work or God commissioning at work, and I'm too young. I I'm too young to step into something like that." Okay. I believe we got a pretty good example for you today. Could we Could we share that just now? Amen. I'm going to finish with this tonight. I'm going to quit. Can you imagine before even time you start assembling an army of demons, you're cast into the earth. You spend 6,000 years banding and training and talking ABOUT WARFARE AND POSITION and anchoring against the bride. &gt;&gt; Stay right there. &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE SEALS ARE RELEASED AND YOU GET 200,000 MORE &gt;&gt; AT YOUR DISPOSAL. &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.

We shall rejoice and be glad in it. &gt;&gt; And be glad in it. &gt;&gt; Oh, THIS IS A DAY &gt;&gt; THAT THE Lord has &gt;&gt; and demons in another dimension start shaking. &gt;&gt; WHY, BROTHER RON? HE HAS AUTHORITY. THAT LITTLE GUY RIGHT THERE HAS ATOMIC POWER. &gt;&gt; Right in his vocal course. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're nuts. I got kids in a kindergarten that stand up and says a teacher one day asked says he said he said uh he he asked HIM SOME QUESTION LIKE DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FIRST SIN WAS? HE STOOD UP AND HE SAID YES. HE SAID IT WAS SEX. NOT EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR. LISTEN, THESE GUYS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL THEY GET OLD. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S ANCHORED IN THEIR HEARTS. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO GO FROM THIS AGE &gt;&gt; TO FULL MATURITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I know it's unfair. You won't get your driver's license, but you won't need it. Where's my call? &gt;&gt; And that went just like that. How many of you were here in that tent? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think, well, that was just an example. Did it come true? &gt;&gt; Did it come true? &gt;&gt; Yes, it did. &gt;&gt; I'd say yes, it did. &gt;&gt; I'd say absolutely yes it did. Brother Brandham uses a term. He said what we choose today. &gt;&gt; What we have made decisions about today &gt;&gt; is where we'll be five years from now. &gt;&gt; Where will we be 10 years from now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandom uh shares with us a not only a prophecy that was interpreted but it was also the mind of God. You have read it thousands of times but I want to share it with you because thou has chosen the narrow path &gt;&gt; the harder way. Thou has walked in your own choosing. Thou has picked the the correct and precise decision and it is my way. &gt;&gt; Because of this momentous decision, a huge portion of heaven will await thee. &gt;&gt; What a glorious decision thou hast made. Thisid in itself is that which will give and make to come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine. I cannot imagine what it felt like for our prophet getting toward the twilight of his years and knowing the end of his messages winding up. Brother Ernie forgod to speak those words to him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST WORDS OF PROPHECY, but words of reality. &gt;&gt; There are some words that we want to hear. Words from God himself. Well done. &gt;&gt; Well done, thou good and faithful servant. I enjoy hearing your applause and I enjoy hearing your amens, &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S SOMETHING IN MY heart &gt;&gt; that there's a finish line. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A FINISH LINE COMING AND I WANT TO HEAR HIM SAY, "WELL DONE." BUT TO GET THERE, THERE'S MUCH strength and energy that's got to be exhausted. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A VISION THAT GOD PUTS IN US, a drive that God puts in us, a zeal, a burden, and it must be accomplished. &gt;&gt; You see, THERE'S LIGHT INSIDE OF THAT SEED, AND IT'S GOT TO be expressed. every generation. You have you have watched this week. I have a father at home that believes this message with all of its his heart. I have a father-in-law that's in another dimension that preached this message for decades with all of his heart. I have I've had the privilege to speak this message and believe it with all of my heart AND TO WATCH MY SON SPEAK IT. I have another son at home that's speaking for our church tonight. &gt;&gt; BUT TO WATCH ANDREW SPEAK HERE ON THIS PLATFORM, &gt;&gt; THIS IS not generational handme-down. &gt;&gt; This isn't something that succeeds one another. It is God that calls. It is God that allotss. It is God that places the gift. It is GOD THAT PUTS THE SEED WHERE IT is and what it's going to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can look back a few years and listened to 1963 and listen to sermons like it is the rising of the sun, IT WAS TALKING ABOUT YOUR PASTOR. &gt;&gt; Your pastor's name was mentioned there. And here we are many years later and we're ALL BENEFITED BY THE ZEAL, THE DETERMINATION, the drive, THE ACCOMPLISHMENT, THE PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; SURE, THERE WILL BE DETRACTORS. AND SURE, THERE WILL BE CRITICS CUZ WE'VE ALL GOT TO GO THROUGH GOD'S HALL OF FAME. But let me just say this to you. I CAN'T SAY IT LIKE SOMEONE ELSE CAN SAY IT, BUT BROTHER ED BISLL, WELL DONE. &gt;&gt; Sitting somewhere in the day today behind every great man is a great woman. True. And I can't pick her out with my eye, but I would say a queen of the earth, &gt;&gt; whom I have more respect for than all of London and definitely all of America. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to offend anybody in Canada, but we have a queen sitting among us. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Biscoff. I'll be leaving quickly in a car afterwards and they won't be able to whip me. Jesus turns to his disciples in Luke 9 in verse 23. And he said unto them all, "If any man will come after me, and let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me, and whosoever will save his life shall lose it. For whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it." &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT IS A MAN ADVANTAGED IF HE GAIN the whole world and lose HIMSELF OR BE A cast away? I WOULDN'T TRADE THE BEST PIECE OF PROPERTY IN WASHINGTON or in Canada OR AMERICA, THE BEST HOUSE, THE BEST CASTLE. &gt;&gt; THE BEST JOB FOR THIS ETERNAL LIFE &gt;&gt; that he has allowed me to live on this side. I WOULDN'T EXCHANGE ANYTHING, any relationship &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT GOD HAS ALLOWED ME TO SHARE ON THIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my works, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come into his own glory, and in his fathers of the and of the holy angels. But I tell of you of a truth, that there be cell some standing here THAT SHALL NOT TASTE OF death till they see the kingdom of God. Second Timothy 4 and verse 1, the Apostle Paul is realizing he's coming to the end of his course and he's now going to share some words. HE SAID, 'I CHARGE THEE BEFORE GOD AND THE LORD Jesus Christ, WHO SHALL JUDGE THE THE QUICK AND THE dead at his appearing and at HIS KINGDOM, PREACH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THAT'S MORE THAN JUST TO BE MEN SITTING ON A PULLPIT. &gt;&gt; LADIES, YOU ARE THE FIFTH GOSPEL IN YOUR HOME. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? LET ME TO SAY A MOST OF GOD'S WORK IS TO BE LIVED. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT A PREACHER. THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU EXEMPT. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT A SINGER. THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU EXEMPT. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES IT'S A BROOM. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES IT'S A SHOVEL. SOMETIMES IT'S TO BE THE TAPE MAN. SOMETIMES IT'S TO BE THIS GUY AND THAT GUY AND JUST TO PUT YOUR HANDS TO THE PLOW AND DO IT WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S WITHIN YOU. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T WANT A HALFHEARTED, HALF COMMITTED. Are you with me now? SO MANY TIMES OUR MARRIAGES STRUGGLE BECAUSE WE'RE HALF COMMITTED. &gt;&gt; OUR CHILDREN SEE US HALF COMMITTED. &gt;&gt; AND YOU SUFFER FROM THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU SUFFER FROM THAT. GOD WANTS OUR WHOLE HEART. &gt;&gt; He wants our whole heart. &gt;&gt; When Jesus turns around and tells his disciples, "TAKE UP YOUR CROSS AND FOLLOW ME." &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT HE COULD REALIZE IF HE COULD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT PARTICULAR God showed him at this point, BUT THESE MEN STANDING IN THIS circle that had LEFT FAMILY, THEY HAD LEFT HOME, THEY HAD LEFT OCCUPATION, THEY HAD LEFT INCREDIBLE THINGS IN THEIR LIVES, BUT THEY DROPPED IT ALL TO FOLLOW JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF THEM HAD RESPONDED &gt;&gt; AND ALL BUT ONE WOULD GIVE THEIR LIFE FOR JESUS CHRIST BY MARTYRDOM. SOME OF THEIR HEADS WOULD BE DRUGGED THROUGH THE STREET. But they WERE NOT ASHAMED. PETER WOULD SAY, "I I'M NOT WORTHY TO BE CRUCIFIED LIKE MY LORD. TURN ME UPSIDE DOWN." &gt;&gt; Think of the price. &gt;&gt; THINK OF THE COST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOUR cross &gt;&gt; and you're driven to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're driven to it. &gt;&gt; Your passion, YOU HAVE DETERMINED, I'LL NOT LET NOTHING GET BETWEEN ME AND GOD. &gt;&gt; COULD I JUST SAY THIS IN THIS TENT THIS MORNING? YOUNG PEOPLE, DON'T LET NOTHING GET BETWEEN YOU AND GOD. CAN YOU ECHO THAT WITH AN AMEN? I'M NOT GOING TO LET NOTHING GET BETWEEN ME AND GOD. &gt;&gt; NOTHING. FIGHT. &gt;&gt; I have finished my course. I HAVE KEPT THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; OH, THAT WE COULD LIVE A LIFE OF NO REGRET. &gt;&gt; OH, THAT WE CAN LOOK BACK IN OUR LIFE AND AT EVERY JUNCTURE OF OUR LIFE, WE'VE GIVE OUR ALL. &gt;&gt; WELL, HOW CAN WE DO THAT? MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN THE PAST, BUT WHAT ABOUT TODAY? STARTING FROM THIS JOURNEY, &gt;&gt; FROM THIS WEEK, &gt;&gt; FROM THIS TIME, &gt;&gt; MAYBE IN THE PAST, BUT GOD'S CALLING YOU. GOD'S CALLED TO JOHN, COME UP HITHER. &gt;&gt; AND HE BECKONED HIM TO PULL INTO ANOTHER REALM. COME AND SEE. &gt;&gt; TODAY IS YOUR TURN TO ALLOW GOD TO REACH INTO YOUR LIVES. BRICKMASONS, CARPENTERS, &gt;&gt; ELECTRICIANS, Y &gt;&gt; COME ON CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IT IS, &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IT IS IN LIFE. WELL, BROTHER, I DON'T SEE MYSELF DOING ANYTHING, BUT YOU DEPOSIT TITHES AND YOU DEPOSIT OFFERINGS AND IT GOES TOWARD THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND MEN GO OVERSEAS AND MEN HAND OUT TRACKS AND MEN HAND OUT BOOKS AND MEN PREACH THE GOSPEL WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS AND YOU'RE A PART OF THAT. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? WHATEVER IT IS, PUT YOUR WHOLE HEART BEHIND IT. &gt;&gt; I'm with you. &gt;&gt; IN THE OLYMPICS, WE ALL WANT TO SEE THE GUY THAT FINISHES AND HE GETS THE GOLD AROUND HIM. BUT LET ME JUST SAY, HE DIDN'T START THERE. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T START THERE. THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF TRAINING THAT WENT ON TO GET HIM WHERE HE'S AT. SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HIM BE TO SWELL UP THAT HE COULD RUN OR IT could swim or it could jump. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HIM CAUSED HIM TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND AND ABOVE AND beyond and above and beyond. &gt;&gt; There ought to be SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. FROM GLORY TO GLORY, FROM GLORY TO GLORY, FROM GLORY TO GLORY. HE'S CHANGING ME. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I have fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; I have finished my course. &gt;&gt; I have kept the faith. Brother Ron, but I'd like to see this one and that one. What about you? &gt;&gt; All right. All right. &gt;&gt; Oh, IF THIS ONE WOULD HAVE ONLY DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT. OH, IF THAT ONE IF YOU KNOW I'M I'M GOT MY EYE ON THIS ONE OR THAT ONE. IF THEY WOULD DO IT, I WOULD DO IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT YOU? &gt;&gt; What about you? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT YOUR TURN? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO USE YOU. YEAH. &gt;&gt; NO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR, BUT GOD WANTS TO USE YOU. &gt;&gt; GOD'S DETERMINED to have A VOICE, &gt;&gt; AND HE CHOSE YOU TO BE THAT VOICE. YOUR HANDS. &gt;&gt; Look at your hands. &gt;&gt; Hello. Look at your hands. &gt;&gt; Your feet. Yeah. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO USE YOUR AMEN. &gt;&gt; He wants TO HEAR YOUR VOICE COMING THROUGH THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; HE'S DETERMINED. THERE'S TWO IN THE BED. ONE WILL BE TAKEN. I'M DETERMINED TO BE ONE. &gt;&gt; Two in THE FIELD. I'M DETERMINED TO BE THE ONE THAT'S TAKEN. &gt;&gt; Two at the MILL WORKING. I'M DETERMINED TO BE THE ONE THAT CATCHES THE REVELATION OF THE RAPTURE OF THIS DAY. I'M DETERMINED. &gt;&gt; HE'S PUT SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF ME THAT RESPONDS TO THE WORD OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; AND I'M DETERMINED TO GIVE IT MY ALL. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your work. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your encouragement. Sometimes sitting in the stands are people that are encouraers. &gt;&gt; AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE'LL we'll get the point to where that let somebody else do it. WE'LL JUST LET SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT. YOU KNOW, let somebody else go do that. &gt;&gt; But what about you? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; What about you? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I want to challenge you today when you go look in the mirror. ASK THAT MAN IN THE MIRROR, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? &gt;&gt; AND TAKE ALL THE EXCUSES THAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVING yourself and THROW THEM IN THE TRASH CAN. BALL THEM UP AND SAY, "I'M DONE WITH MY EXCUSES. &gt;&gt; I'M DONE WITH MY EXCUSES. IF I'VE GOT 10 YEARS LEFT IN LIFE, IF I'VE GOT 20 YEARS LEFT IN LIFE, IF I'VE GOT 80 YEARS LEFT in life, I WANT TO SERVE GOD WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S WITHIN ME." &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, is that A PEP TALK? WELL, IF YOU WANT TO TAKE IT HOWEVER YOU WANT TO TAKE IT, &gt;&gt; I WANT TO ENCOURAGE you today. &gt;&gt; Run. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RUN. &gt;&gt; OTHERS HAVE RAN. &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR TURN TO RUN. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT WAITING ON SOMEBODY ELSE TO RUN. IT'S YOUR TURN. &gt;&gt; THE SEED THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PUMPED UP AND PRIMED UP AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW, GET YOURSELF MOVING. LET THAT LIFE LIVE. AND PAUL SAY ON THE INSIDE OF your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul said it and I read it earlier this week, but I felt it imperative to read it today. I press &gt;&gt; TOWARD THE MARK OF THE HIGH calling &gt;&gt; of God in CHRIST JESUS. I PRESS. Brother Random SAID THE CHURCH IS NOT recognized today. LIKE ISRAEL BACK IN THE PROMISED LAND. SHE DON'T KNOW HOW SHE GOT BACK THERE. &gt;&gt; SHE WAS JUST AUTOMATICALLY PUT BY THERE. WHY? NATIONAL FORCE HAS PUT HER IN HER PLACE. &gt;&gt; I'm going TO SAY SOMETHING. NATIONAL FORCE WILL PUT ISRAEL in her homeland. NATIONAL FORCE WILL PUT THE church in the world council of churches. BUT THE POWER OF GOD WILL PUT THE PEOPLE IN the bride. &gt;&gt; THE WORLD FORCES THIS WAY AND THE WORLD FORCES THAT WAY, BUT GOD FORCES UPWARD. THE SPIRIT OF GOD, WHICH IS THE WORD OF GOD, MY word is SPIRIT AND LIFE, WILL PUT THE BRIDE IN HER PLACE CUZ SHE'LL RECOGNIZE her position in the word AND SHE'S IN CHRIST, WILL PUT HER IN HER PLACE. NO NATIONAL FORCE WILL DO IT, &gt;&gt; BUT THE NATIONAL FORCE WILL DRIVE ISRAEL TO HER HOMELAND. NATIONAL FORCES WILL OF the church of the the the COUNCIL OF CHURCHES WILL DRIVE EVERY ORGANIZATION INTO IT. BUT THE POWER OF GOD WILL RAISE THE BRIDE INTO GLORY OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; Oh people RECOGNIZE YOUR DAY. JESUS HAS WARNED YOU THE SIGN OF SODOM AND THE CHURCH'S CONDITION of this day. &gt;&gt; GLORY BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT IN THE DAYS OF THE VOICE of the seventh angel, WHEN HE SHALL BEGIN TO SOUND, THE MYSTERY OF GOD SHOULD BE FINISHED, AS he declared to his servants, the prophets, and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, GO, AND TAKE THE LITTLE BOOK WHICH IS OPEN IN THE HAND OF THE ANGEL, WHICH STANDETH UPON THE SEA, and upon the earth. And I went unto THE ANGEL THAT SAID UNTO ME, "GET ME THE LITTLE BOOK." AND HE SAID UNTO ME, "TAKE IT AND EAT IT UP." WHAT DOES THIS MESSAGE SAY FOR ME? &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THIS MESSAGE SAY FOR ME? DON'T JUST TAKE THE PREACHER'S WORDS FOR IT. EAT THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; Spend your time eating THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; STAY IN THE BOOK. AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET THE BOOK LIVE OUT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; To him that overcometh. &gt;&gt; I trust in lay odyssey of the darkest age that there's ever been. There will be people &gt;&gt; THAT WILL BE THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. &gt;&gt; There will be final runners. &gt;&gt; There will be. &gt;&gt; There will be. &gt;&gt; There will be a bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; There will be overcomers of this age. &gt;&gt; WE WILL HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH THE CONDITIONS OF LEODYSA. And you by now know every one of them that are that are against you. BUT GOD HAS BUILT YOU TO OVERCOME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE SAT SHOULDER TOSH shoulder and you have maybe you never knew that person's name before this week, BUT YOU'VE SAT SHOULDERTOSH SHOULDER BESIDE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE BUILT TO OVERCOME THIS AGE. &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE YOU'RE BESIDE ONE ANOTHER. ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER. STRENGTHEN FOR ONE ANOTHER. PRAY FOR ONE ANOTHER. WE'RE BUILT TO OVERCOME THIS AGE. We're eagles. &gt;&gt; The scripture bears out and it begins to say this, and forgive me for MY REDUNDANCY, THAT IT MIGHT BE FULFILLED which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah. For verily I SAY UNTO YOU, till heaven and earth one jot or ONE TIT SHALL IN NO WISE PAY IT PASS AWAY UNTIL THE law till it might be fulfilled. Matthew 8:17 that it was might be fulfilled WHICH WAS SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET ISAIAH THE PROPHET SAYING HIMSELF TOOK OUR INFIRMITIES AND bear sickness that it might be FULFILLED IN MATTHEW 12 which is spoken by Isaiah the prophet in Matthew 13 and in them IS F FULFILLED THE PROPHECY OF ISAIAH WHICH SAID BY HEARING YOU shall hear and shall not understand and see and you shall see and not perceive IN IN VERSE 35 THAT IT MIGHT BE FULFILLED. Matthew 21 verse4 all of this WAS DONE THAT IT MIGHT BE FULFILLED IN IN IN 24 VERSE 34 VERELY I SAY UNTO YOU NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU THIS GENERATION SHALL NOT pass &gt;&gt; till all things &gt;&gt; all things &gt;&gt; be fulfilled GOD IS DETERMINED. &gt;&gt; YES, HE IS. YES, HE IS. &gt;&gt; GOD IS DETERMINED. &gt;&gt; Did you watch 10 years ago? Boom. That's like a second to God. &gt;&gt; That's like a millisecond to God. AND LOOK WHERE WE ARE TODAY. &gt;&gt; But in that spans, MANY HAVE FULFILLED JUDAS. &gt;&gt; AND EVEN JESUS TOLD JUDAS, &gt;&gt; "WHAT YOU DO, DO QUICKLY." &gt;&gt; AND YOU SAY, "WELL, WHY DID THEY RUN AWAY? AND WHY DID THEY SCORN? AND WHY DID THEY MOCK? AND WHY ARE THEY DETERMINED TO DESTROY US? THEY HAD TO FULFILL SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I'M JUST GOING TO PREACH TO YOU MY HEART HERE FOR just a bit. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD TO FULFILL SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE GOING TO FULFILL SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO FULFILL SCRIPTURE. THE OVERCOMERS OF THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; YOU'LL PUT THIS DRESS ON AND IT FITS. &gt;&gt; IT WAS MORE THAN A STORY. BROTHER BRANDON TALKING ABOUT THE ARMOR AND COMPANY, SON. AND THAT LITTLE GIRL RECEIVING THE THE THE MAN AT THE CORRAL AND HE KISSING HER ON THE CHEEK AND SAY, "I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU IN A YEAR." AND SHE TESTIFIED FOR A YEAR. AND SHE GOT HERSELF READY. AND LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU, HER HEART WAS BURDENED WITH ZEAL. I'M GOING TO BE HIS WIFE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT HE DEPOSITED INSIDE OF HER WAS A PROMISE. I'M COMING BACK FOR YOU. GOD HAS DETERMINED AND DEPOSITED ON THE INSIDE OF YOU A PROMISE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. G. &gt;&gt; Let them sit on the porch and laugh and make fun of you. Just stand there and in the dress &gt;&gt; somewhere in the Hollywood world they come up with a with a saying yes to the dress. Well, they stole that from us. WE SAID YES TO THIS DRESS. &gt;&gt; WE SAID YES TO THIS DRESS. &gt;&gt; AND THIS DRESS FITS VERY WELL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THIS DRESS FITS VERY WELL. I'VE NEVER SAID THAT from a pull pit. Hope I don't get in trouble. &gt;&gt; IT FITS. GOD'S IN HIS DRESS WEAR &gt;&gt; THEM FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY &gt;&gt; AND SERVICE AFTER SERVICE WE WERE ENCOURAGED AND WE WERE STRENGTHENED AND WE WERE CUT AND WE WERE PRICRICKED IN OUR HEART AND WE RESPONDED WHAT SHOULD WE DO &gt;&gt; I'm thrilled TO HEAR THERE ARE SOME YOUNG PEOPLE THAT SAYS WHAT CAN I DO I want to REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF MY SINS. AND THEN THE PROMISE IS THAT I WILL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. FOR THIS PROMISE IS UNTO YOU AND TO YOUR CHILDREN AND TO all that are a far off, EVEN AS MANY AS THE LORD OUR GOD SHALL CALL. WE ARE FULFILLING SCRIPTURE TODAY. &gt;&gt; What's going on in Uganda? It's the BOOK OF ACTS. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHINA? IT'S THE BOOK OF ACTS. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING ON IN CLOVERDALE? WHAT'S GOING ON AT MOUNT BAKER CAMP? WHAT'S GOING ON IN ELTON, VIRGINIA? IT'S THE BOOK OF ACTS. &gt;&gt; IT'S HIM THAT IS AMONG US. IT'S HIM THAT'S AT our homes. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES, HE IS COMING. BUT HE HAS COME &gt;&gt; AND HE WANTS TO LIVE IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; It's more than a quote. &gt;&gt; It's a life. &gt;&gt; It's a life. &gt;&gt; More than a quote. We're bone of his bone. All right. &gt;&gt; Life of his life, &gt;&gt; power of his power, &gt;&gt; spirit of his spirit. &gt;&gt; WE'RE THE VEILED FLESH THAT GOD WANTS TO DWELL INSIDE OF. &gt;&gt; IF YOU COULD ONLY GET BEYOND yourself &gt;&gt; in A DAY OF SELFISHNESS AND A DAY OF PERSONAL AMBITION. &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm not going to be much longer. I think I touched on something last night that's mind-blowing. How can the scripture just blows my mind? How could people come to a meeting &gt;&gt; where the resurrection was at &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and THE ONE THAT CALLED THE RESURRECTION forth and the resurrected Lazarus BE IN THE SAME room &gt;&gt; and yet they would want to kill him. Y &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME SPIRIT OF THIS MODERN CHURCH. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANAL CALLED OUT AGAINST IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THE MODERN CHURCH IS PRODUCING STILLBORN CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WHERE THERE WAS NO EMOTION, THERE'S NO LIFE." &gt;&gt; This ain't a good morning TO GET QUIET. WHERE THERE'S NO EMOTION, THERE'S NO LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID 40 YEARS AGO OR YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID 10 YEARS AGO. WHAT ABOUT NOW? &gt;&gt; WE BURY PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND MANY PEOPLE SIT IN SERVICES WITH THEIR ARMS CROSSED &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID YEARS AGO. SAT THERE WITH NO REVIVAL IN THEIR LIVES. WELL, I HOPE THE KIDS GET IT. WHAT ABOUT YOU? &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS WORD? &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING? &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS? &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I CAN SEE IT BY YOUR CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YOUR CHILDREN ARE HALF-HEARTED JUST LIKE YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; THE REASON THEY HAVE NO BURDEN, YOU HAVE NO BURDEN. &gt;&gt; EXACTLY. &gt;&gt; LET'S TEAR DOWN CHAINS TODAY. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I JUST RECYCLE. I JUST KEEP RECYCLING. I GO FROM ONE REVIVAL TO ANOTHER REVIVAL AND I KEEP FALLING INTO PROBLEMS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. GET UP. &gt;&gt; Get up. &gt;&gt; GET UP. GET YOURSELF OUT OF THE WAY. &gt;&gt; LAY YOUR PROBLEMS DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND COMMIT YOUR LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST LIKE NEVER BEFORE. &gt;&gt; I'VE TOLD MY FAMILY THERE IS NO COATTAIL RELIGION. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; There is no cocktail religion. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HANG ON MY EXPERIENCE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR OWN. &gt;&gt; So many times we let things GET BY BECAUSE YOU'VE JUST SAT IN a pew for 30 years. But really what you did is you sat in a pew, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Came to the dress code, &gt;&gt; came to the doctrine ORDER, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE LIFE. &gt;&gt; CAN I CALL OUT TO YOU TODAY? &gt;&gt; CAN I CALL OUT TO YOU TODAY? &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I'VE DONE PREACHED THIS WAY TOO LONG NOW. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I'VE SEEN MOMS AND DAD WALKED TO THE ALTAR AFTER YEARS AND THEY LOOK LIKE PILLARS AND THEY LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, "I GOT TO HAVE MORE." AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN ALLOWED TO JUST GET TIME BOOKED AGAINST ME AND TIME AND I'VE SAT HERE AND I PUT EFFORT FORTH, BUT I NEED A FRESH EXPERIENCE WITH WITH THE WORD. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID WE NEED TO BRING JESUS CHRIST A FRESH DRINK OF PENTECOSTAL WATER. &gt;&gt; Don't label me Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; DON'T LABEL ME WITH SOME OF YOUR YOUR LABELS THAT YOU'D LIKE to label we me right now. LET ME TO SAY THIS TO YOU. IT'S YOU THAT NEEDS TO BRING GOD A FRESH DRINK. &gt;&gt; Not some redundant PRAYER THAT YOU PRAYED OVER AND OVER AGAIN OR HAVEN'T LISTENED TO A TAPE IN FOREVER. &gt;&gt; I CHALLENGE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SHAKE YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; NOW IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY. &gt;&gt; RUN. RUN. &gt;&gt; MEN LIKE JOHN WESLEY PREACHED 88,000 SERMONS. &gt;&gt; MEN LIKE PETER CARTRIGHT BAPTIZED 12,000 PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; MEN TRANSLATED THE BIBLE 42 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. WHEN I WAS IN IN CHINA WITH BROTHER MURPHY WONG, MY HEART SWELL BECAUSE MURPHY WONG IS MY FRIEND. &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S GIVE HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; SOMEWHERE ANOTHER HE WAS LIKE YOU AND HE SAID, "I WANT TO GIVE MY LIFE." &gt;&gt; Where's Murphy's children now? Could you stand now? Could you stand? &gt;&gt; Your turn. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. &gt;&gt; Where's Jason? &gt;&gt; Jason. It's &gt;&gt; your turn. &gt;&gt; Where's Silus? Silus. &gt;&gt; I'm just about done now. Come here, Silus. It's your turn. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. &gt;&gt; Stage is too small. All right. Have you come &gt;&gt; stay right there &gt;&gt; from Chile? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You come here. Oh, what a good-look boy. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. &gt;&gt; Starting today. &gt;&gt; I can see it all over you. &gt;&gt; Are you being baptized today? But you're starting your journey today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I like a bow tie, too. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. Amen. &gt;&gt; How old are you? &gt;&gt; 13. &gt;&gt; 13. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's boys. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, good. I'm glad you asked. &gt;&gt; How old are you? &gt;&gt; 15. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. How old are you? &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. &gt;&gt; God wants you. A model. He wants a model of Christianity. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll have her." What's your name? &gt;&gt; Aaliyah. &gt;&gt; Aaliyah. I got some Aaliyah in my life. I want Aaliyah to represent me more than a quote, more than a tape, more than a picture on the wall, &gt;&gt; but I want an Aaliyah to represent me. &gt;&gt; Could you stand? &gt;&gt; You have stood. And I'm not going to ask you how old you are. It's your turn. You be the light in the darkness. Is that not what was said to you? &gt;&gt; Is that not what was said to you? &gt;&gt; You be the light in the darkness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she found her turn. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a great big hand now. I watched in China people crawl from the back to the front. You can edit this if you like, but brother Murphy said they knew. I said, "What was the pull?" He said, "Brother Ron, they're willing to be arrested, but they so want to hear the word of God. Take all of your excuses away and throw them. &gt;&gt; There's nothing MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS WORD." &gt;&gt; Your turn, brother Ron. That's simple. It's not so simple for her. &gt;&gt; You be the light in the darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not so simple for Murphy Wong. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE FOR YOU, BROTHER STEVEN. When you grab a hold of this word &gt;&gt; and you REALIZE THIS WORD HAS ETERNAL VALUE TO IT, &gt;&gt; AND THIS WORD WILL BE YOUR BANKER. IT'LL BE YOUR LAWYER. IT'LL BE YOUR DOCTOR. IT'LL BE YOUR MARRIAGE COUNSELOR. IT'LL BE YOUR GUIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DARK NIGHT. IT'LL BE EVERYTHING TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Could we end this service with I COMMIT MY LIFE TO THIS WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I totally commit my life. A sister to a sister, a brother to a brother. &gt;&gt; Could you just join one another's hand now? Right where you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What a presence of God in this building. &gt;&gt; Noah committed his way to God &gt;&gt; and God provided an ark. &gt;&gt; We commit our hands into you, Lord God. &gt;&gt; We commit our mind, our heart, our energies I commit myself to you, oh God. &gt;&gt; I surrender my all to you just now. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't know particularly what lays in my future, but God, you are my everything. You are the breath that I breathe. YOU'RE THE THOUGHTS THAT I THINK. YOU'RE THE SONGS THAT I SING. YOU'RE THE WORDS THAT I preach. &gt;&gt; You are my everything, dear God. &gt;&gt; Lord, I STAND WITH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE TODAY. LORD, 10 YEARS AGO, I STOOD WITH MICHAEL. 10 years ago, Michael Ray was here. Joe Ray was here. MY SON RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST IN THAT MEETING. OH GOD, WE CELEBRATE THIS MOMENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE ONE THAT'S DONE IT ALL. FATHER, &gt;&gt; young or old, &gt;&gt; we commit our life to you. &gt;&gt; We surrender our life to you. &gt;&gt; We give our all to you just now. We place it into your hands. &gt;&gt; MAYBE IT'S SOMEONE JUST STARTING OUT. &gt;&gt; LORD, I PRAY THAT THEY JUST COMMIT THEIR LIFE NOW. &gt;&gt; FATHER, forgive them of their sins. &gt;&gt; Let them WALK A NEW AND ARESH. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; touch their lives this evening &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ name. In Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ name. &gt;&gt; Driven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're driven. &gt;&gt; David Mayor. We're driven. &gt;&gt; We're driven. You call your name right there. I'm driven. &gt;&gt; I'm driven. &gt;&gt; You call your name. &gt;&gt; You call your name. &gt;&gt; Now it's an exercise. You call your name. &gt;&gt; Ron Spencer, you're driven. &gt;&gt; Let me hear your voices. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I refuse to quit. &gt;&gt; I refuse TO GO BACK. THERE'S NOTHING TO GO BACK TO. &gt;&gt; HEAVEN AWAITS. &gt;&gt; A NEW BODY AWAITS. &gt;&gt; ALL THESE FORMER THINGS WILL BE PASSED AWAY. &gt;&gt; I'm driven to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not a good singer, but could I sing this this morning? On the wings of a snow white dove. What a presence. It's just been on my heart. It's just been on my heart. Our journey our journey. We can look back and look where we are now. It's been God that's got us to this point. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I can look back in my life and it's been all God. &gt;&gt; I owe my life to God. I owe the rest of my life to God on the wings of snow. I &gt;&gt; could we stand and worship. God sends his pure sweet love a sign from above on the wings of &gt;&gt; Could we sing that verse? Though I have suffered. Oh, I have suffered in many ways. I cry for that. All night he was for my father. Oh, he gave me on the wings. &gt;&gt; Let's sing him with all of our hearts. &gt;&gt; On the wings of the snow. Bless his sweet. &gt;&gt; Won't you just welcome him to where you're at now? All the winds of the snow is your sweet. Oh my love is your sweet love. Oh, I am drifting on the last day. He search for in way. Oh God, on the wings of a Oh, on the wings of a snow. God says his pure sweet love a sign on the wings. Have you accepted the challenge this morning? Brother Abby Biscll just leaned over to me and Sister Joanne just wanted to reaffirm we just had a group of our people just make it across the line to be in the service right now. I believe they deserve our appreciation. You get very humbled &gt;&gt; and people want to just come and be in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; We made it and they struggled to be here. just at the closing words of brother Spencer's service. My prayer is, oh God, would you bless them? &gt;&gt; Would you pour out upon them that they couldn't even contain it? &gt;&gt; We thank you for your effort. We thank you for doing this. &gt;&gt; Just driving up to the last moments. &gt;&gt; It means something to me. And God bless you for it. And may the wings of a dove, may the presence of God fill you, &gt;&gt; strengthen you. God can work in a supernatural realm that we know nothing of. We We sat here and we ba bast in the presence of God, but he could just come right by your way &gt;&gt; and give you everything we got. &gt;&gt; He can do that for you at this time. That is that not humbling? &gt;&gt; That's what makes this little church special to me. &gt;&gt; Everybody doing their best, &gt;&gt; giving their all. I would say to brother Spencer, we are a driven church &gt;&gt; and we will be driven &gt;&gt; if God should give us a few more days, weeks, months, or years. driven to proclaim this gospel, driven to get this message around the world. &gt;&gt; Look what it's done to us. If he can do it to me, he can do it to anybody. &gt;&gt; And may God raise up young men and young ladies to be driven. Ah, brother Ron said, there's an expression saying yes to the dress. And if that is an expression that somebody's borrowed, they can have it. But I want you to know, I've said yes to this dress a long time ago. &gt;&gt; God's given to the church apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, preachers, teachers. We're thankful for men of God that can stand and proclaim this message. We're thankful for everyone that has come in this camp. We can't possibly name everyone. And in doing that, of course, you miss someone. But my God that I serve knows everyone &gt;&gt; that put an effort to make this camp what it is. From the kitchen to the pre-planning to everything you've enjoyed, there has been brothers and sisters that have worked months to make this happen. And it would be it would we be dilatory not to be able to thank those people whether they be in the kitchen or the brother brother David Walners and his sister Jana Wal Waldner's that have worked behind the scenes picking up your garbage. Listen, I have a hard time picking up my own garbage at home. And these brothers have picked up their garbage. All your garbage around here. You say, "Well, that wasn't anything." I'll tell you that was eternal. &gt;&gt; That was eternal. As brother Spencer said, everybody has been doing their part. And from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank every counselor, sound people, video, all that work behind to make the junior camp happen and senior camp happen. All I want to do is throw up my hand and say, "Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You gave us another year, a blessed time. Thank you for men of God that ministered the word of God. And &gt;&gt; thank you for opening my heart and my ears to hear what the spirit would say. &gt;&gt; I am more determined after this set of services to serve God with all my heart, mind, soul, and strength. &gt;&gt; Are you young people &gt;&gt; going to leave it to somebody else? Or are you going to take up the torch? You going to take up the banner? Are you going to roll your stone away? Are you going to do something for God? Just any part, any part to play. God will use you. &gt;&gt; Because we've been prophesied to be a mighty army. &gt;&gt; So before we go, I want to remind the local church there's no Wednesday service. just to the sheer fact of breaking down everything and everybody getting their strength back. We'll be having C church of course on the following Sunday. Can we just sing one little chorus? I pledge allegiance to this lamb. I plan to reach &gt;&gt; with all my heart, &gt;&gt; with all my strength, with all everything that's within me, I will see all the way. with all of you that is in me. I've heard about Christians long ago. I am worth the He was my one by one. I see I see their voice and I &gt;&gt; Let's make it unanimous this morning to the lamb. I'll be driven, Lord. his command. I went to the lamb to the lamb of God and to the lamb of God. my &gt;&gt; bless your holy name. &gt;&gt; Bless your name, Lord. &gt;&gt; I see to &gt;&gt; and I pledge allegiance to the lamb. Brother John would get ready for baptism. And those that will be being baptized will be baptizing right up here by the snack shack. There's a a pool waiting there. And if those that would like to linger and watch baptism, absolutely. The lunch is prepared for campers only. Unfortunately, we'd love to have you all. If you've brought your picnics, that's wonderful. stay on the grounds, enjoy one another's company, and you're welcome to stay till this afternoon. And uh I think that's all that we have to announce, unless I miss it, but yes, of course, we want to leave a good testimony. We want our cabins clean. Every one of you, I know I know you're you'll do that. You've been faithful. Every year we've been having kind comments that you leave it better than what you got it. And that's marvelous. Let's let's keep that testimony keep that testimony high. And when we finish praying, I know it's disruptive to the presence of the Lord, but he'll go with us. If the brothers would just grab a chair and we'll put them stack them outside where they're supposed to be and help the brothers here. We can get it done in just a matter of minutes if you just grab a chair where you're at and it'll all be done. But I just thank you one more time. It's been a very special day. Amen. &gt;&gt; I guess I've been involved for 30 33 years of them. And every year you just say, "Oh, how can it ever get better?" And it and it just shows you it has to be God &gt;&gt; for it to escalate to the degree of where we're at today. I think by next year we must escalate into the very glories of God. If it's going the way that it's going, I can't see that we'd have another year. God bless you all. You know who you are. From dishwashers, sound, music, everyone. God give you a crown. Let's bow our heads. Father, when it's all said and done, it's to God be the glory. When it's all said and done, Lord, we want you to receive the praise. We say to the sound people or we say to the musicians or we say to the kitchen staff, "Thank you." But really, Lord, it's the God in them that we thank. They have poured out their lives and as your prophet taught us, living for others is true Christianity. And so, Father, I'm just praying that your grace will go with everyone that has traveled the distances from Saskatchewan to Alberta, all throughout the states back to Europe. Would the glory of God go with every one of us, Lord. May your presence be near and may we not forget what we've heard. May the Holy Spirit bring back to our remembrance. For we have indeed marked the spot at this camp, God met me. So bless your children as they will go their separate ways and we'll have that closing part, Lord, with the young people having their lunch. will have the baptisms and we ask that you fill them with the Holy Ghost. Lord, let these young men and young lady that will be baptized, may they be driven &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God that shall descend. &gt;&gt; Go with us now. And we thank you for this time that we've had. It's been special. So we thank you for your special presence in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Greet one another as you kindly greet one another. Just take your chair and take it out back and the brothers will show you where to put them. God bless you. Heat. Heat.
