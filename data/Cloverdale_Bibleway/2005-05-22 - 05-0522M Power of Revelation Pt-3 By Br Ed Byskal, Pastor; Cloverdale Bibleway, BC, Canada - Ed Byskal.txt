We have a wonderful testimony from our sister Muriel Hansen. She says, "Thank you to everyone who prayed for my eyesight. I found out last week my vision is almost completely restored and I'm very thankful to God. So I want to thank the Lord for that. And a testimony from brother Ashley says thanks to brothers and sisters for praying when I when in hospital I'm completely well. He wants to thank the Lord for that. Hallelujah. And also brother Frank Fletcher. I wish to thank all the saints for their prayers and wonderful help in getting better from the operation especially the healing hand of the Lord Jesus. May the Lord bless you all who show such love. So he wants a great thanks to you. We have a prayer request here from her sister Yola Navocski. She has written down here, please pray for a sister in Poland who had a heart attack and doctors have given her about four months to live without a bypass. So, I just want to ask that the Lord would move on the scene there. If you have a need on your heart and it just wasn't pinned down, but it's something you just want to hand over to the Lord, just raise your hand as we go to prayer. Brother Joe, [Music] bow our heads and our hearts this morning. Heavenly Father, we bow in your holy presence once more this morning. Father, thanking you for your goodness, grace, and your love and mercy towards us. Father, we thank you for caring for us, Father, watching over us and blessing and giving us the grace and the strength that we need from day to day. Father, Lord, we've come to your house, Father, this morning to offer our worship, our thanksgiving, and our prayers to thee, oh God. Father, we just ask that you will continue to be with us and give us ears to hear this morning, hearts to receive. Father, Lord, what the spirit will speak to us, Father. Oh God, Lord, we're just so thankful that we can come before thee with our petitions. Oh God, Lord, we can ask of thee, Father, and we can expect, Father, and knowing that you promise. You're the one that made the promise, Father. It's not up to us to make it happen, Father, but it's up to us to believe, Father, to have the faith, Father, in the finished work of Calvary, Father, what you have promised and provided for us, dear Lord Jesus. Thinking about the sister, Lord Jesus, in Poland, dear God. Father, Lord, won't you reach out, Father, this morning, oh God. Father, just mend that heart, oh God. And Father, give our sister the joy of the Lord, Father, and the and what you have promised her, Father, help, Father. Dear Lord Jesus, we hold her up this morning and ask you, oh God, that you'll remember her this morning. Father, be with each and every one of us, Father, this morning as we receive your word. Father, bless our precious brother Ed as he comes behind the pulpit tonight. Father, give his body the grace and the strength that he needs, Father, to deliver what's on his heart. Father, I pray that you bless the man of God, Father, this morning, Father, speak through him, Father, that and and that we may pull, Father, upon the word, Father, this morning, and you give and deliver to us what we have need us, Father. We commit your people this morning, Father, into your hand, Father, into your loving care, Father. Bless the song service also. We pray, Father. Lord God, bless your people around the world, those that are listening in, Father. Father, may they may they glean, Father, this morning, Father, what they have need of, Father. Bless them abundantly, Father. Lord, those that can't be here, Father, this morning, Father, be with them also, we pray. Bless those that are sick and afflicted. Thank you for those that you've already healed and the mighty testimonies we've heard, Father. What a blessing it is, Father, to know that you're still here and answer prayers, Father. Lord, we commit this service to you now in your wonderful, lovely name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Thank you, brother Joe. You may have your seats. [Music] I want to welcome everyone this morning into his presence. I trust you feel him amongst us. Amen. If you're visiting with us, I know we've got many visitors. We want to say welcome. Trust you feel at home. Uh brother Jeremy and his family have a song for us as they come and get ready. Why don't we sing number 54? We're together again. Just praising the Lord. We're together again. Just praising the Lord. We're together again. Ain't what I call. Something good is going to happen. Something good is in store. Work together again. Just praising the Lord. Work together again. Just praising the Lord. Work together again. is what I call. Something good is going to happen. Something good is in store. We're together again. Praising the Lord. [Music] [Music] I am what I am because of his grace. For once spotless lamb died in my place. All my sins are forgiven. My past is erased. I am what I am because of his grace. I am what I am because of his grace. For one spotless lamb died in my place. All my sins are forgiven. My past is erased. I am what I am. Because of his grace. [Music] &gt;&gt; I could stand here and tell you what I used to be. I could tell of the change that's come over me. But the Lord shed his grace when he died on the tree. So I'll let the blood Jesus shed before me. I am what I am because of his grace. For once spotless lamb died in my place. All my sins are forgiven. My past is erased. I am what I am because of his grace. &gt;&gt; I was lost and undone. Now I'm found and fulfilled. God traded his son for my shame and my guilt. Now I'm his child. No longer sin slave. His mercy has made me what I am today. I am what I am because of his grace. For once spotless lamb died in my place. All my sins are forgiven. My past is erased. I am what I am because of his grace. [Music] Now I'm br to the king, robed in my wedding gown. Place my life in his hands, and he won't let me down. Faithful and true, without spot or stain. What I am today was always in his plan. I am what I am because of his race. For once spotless lamb died in my place. All my sins are forgiven. My past is erased. I am what I am because of his grace. I am what I am because of his grace. for one spotless land. Died in my place. All my sins are forgiven. My past is erased. I am what I am. I'm safe by grace. I am what I am. My past is erased. I am what I am because of his grace. I'm saved by grace. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. You glad you're saved by grace? &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother Ed's going to come now and bring the word, why don't we turn to 55 on the screen. Thy loving kindness is better than life. Thy loving kindness is better than life. Thy loving kindness is better than life. Silence shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee. I will lift up my hands in thy name. I lift my hands, Lord, unto thy name. Oh, I lift my hands, Lord, unto thy name. My lips shall praise thee. Bless my lie. Oh, I will lift up my hands in thy thy loving kindness. Thy loving kindness is better than life. Thy loving my name is better than life. Oh my lips shall praise the light. I will lift up my hands in thy name. I'll lift my hands all unto thy name. [Music] I'll lift my hands unto thy name. My lips shall praise thee. I will lift up my hands. Let me lift my hand. Oh, I lift my hands up. I lift my hands up until I [Music] shall praise I bless thee. I will lift up my hands in thy name. Why don't we just stand? I lift my hands, Lord, unto thy name. Oh, we're here to glorify you, Lord. We're here to praise you. Unto the name my lips shall praise you. Thus will I bless thee. I will lift up my hands in thy name. [Music] Hallelujah. People lift up their hands and clap and do all kinds of uh outward emotion things for all kinds of things in the world, but they don't have near what we have to be excited about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our Lord does things in such strange ways we can't possibly grasp it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he healed the blind man, he said, the disciples said, and we need to say it often, who has sinned, &gt;&gt; this man or his parents? &gt;&gt; Neither. Not this man or his parents, but that God may be glorified. The name of God might be glorified. We have a hard time understanding that. But you may have gone through perhaps some difficulty. You may be going through one right now. You might say, "What's wrong with me?" Isn't that's not the problem. It isn't something that's wrong. In most cases, it isn't something that's wrong. It's that God may be glorified and you're just to hold steadfast, unmovable in the things of in the things that God has taught you, and that will that will serve you well. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I have some nice things to share with you, but I will do so perhaps later on in the service. Uh, however, uh, I had some wonderful private time with Rabbi Richmond. And, uh, just a very, very excellent time getting deeper and deeper into the message. Amen. It was really, really fine. I wanted to also let you know that uh Jonathan Bergen and Sister Sarah Dingwall were married yesterday and uh there was just a lovely wedding and a reception afterward. There was probably 35 or 40 people from the church and I would imagine most of them are still up there. Brother Tom is preaching at brother Harold Hillbrand's today and uh quite a number will be in a different churches that are in Edmonton. So, uh, we were we, uh, just had a real happy time. Amen. I felt at the closing of the reception, they asked me to say something more, and I said, "Well, no, I said everything at the service, and they already had it down in the the little uh order of the reception." So, Michael White came and and uh said, "They got you down to say something else." And I said, 'Well, I've said all I'm going to say, really. They said, "Well, they already have you down there." The Lord just kind of touched my heart in the afternoon. We didn't have that much time, maybe a couple of hours at the most. And it was just like a voice within said, "Challenge these young people of Edmonton. challenge them to be something above the normal, something above the average. And I can say that does well. I said, I'd like to say that to everybody in the message. Anybody can be average. Anybody can just be the normal, but to step above the average. And I took the scripture where Apostle Paul said to Timothy, "Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou." I said that wasn't an option that this mighty apostle Paul was saying you be an example. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, he talked about apost apostle Paul and I bear in my body the marks and he said no doubt Timothy looked with admiration on those marks. So Timothy wasn't just taking this lightly when Apostle Paul was saying this was one that Timothy had looked on and admired and saw the marks of the gospel and the marks of the suffering. Then Apostle Paul saying now you be an example. Don't let anybody despise your youth in purity in conversation in be an example to all. I say that's good for every one of us. Be an example so you could turn around and say I'd like somebody you may follow in my footsteps. That's really what a father, a mother, that's what everyone wants to do regardless of what position we have, a brother and sister. And so I felt to challenge Jonathan and Sarah as well. I said, "You have a you have a home that is so a godly place and a place where you can know that you're being an example to others." Amen. You know, the young people, I'll just say to you, there's a lot of lot of fine young people, a lot of lovely young people. There's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of homes, there's a lot of believers, a lot of churches, there's a lot of everything. We haven't got any scarcity. &gt;&gt; But we have a scarcity of that which is just above. &gt;&gt; Not many mighty are called. Not many noble, but there are some. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Glad that you're here to hear the word today and giving response to it. I'll have you turn in your Bibles to John the 12th chapter and we're going to begin reading at the uh 20 uh 20th verse. Thank you musicians and brother Jason Brother John Andes will be speaking tonight and so we're expecting a good day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll be praying for me. I was up about 4:30 your time to get here to this service, but I wanted to be here and preach this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Starting with John the 12th chapter and verse 20. And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to the came up to worship at the feast. And the same came therefore to Philillip which was of Bethesda, Bethada rather, of Galilee, and desired him, saying, "Sir, we would see Jesus." Philillip cometh and tellth Andrew, and again Andrew and Philillip, tell Jesus. And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, and the Son of Man should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it. And he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it uh he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me. And where where I am, there shall also my servant be. If any man serve me, him will my father honor. Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again. And the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered. Others said, an angel spake to him. Jesus answered and said, "This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. Now is the judgment of the world of this world. Now shall the prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With our heads bowed a moment in prayer. Almighty God, Father and author of life, author of this book we hold in our hands. We believe, oh God, this is nothing less than the infallible word of God. We believe that one word taken away from it or one word added, oh God, is uh is a sin against you. We pray today that you will take what is contained herein and reveal to us, Lord. Reveal to us the contents. No one knows the contents but the author. We pray you'll send your spirit. send it upon the people and into the people. Some here perhaps don't know what it is to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Fill them with the Holy Spirit. Come down, oh God, amongst us. Do the impossible, I pray. Let the cleansing flame and the purging power, let the washing of the water by the word, oh God, do its work amongst us now. We will thank you and praise you. Give utterance now Lord to my lips I pray and give hearing ears to the people in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Now I approached uh this subject just briefly last Sunday and I'm going to just see how far we get along today. But I would like you to really give me your undivided attention. Don't be distracted and let's not have any more movement than is absolutely necessary. The question that the Greeks asked, sir, we would see Jesus. And the Bible says, now just to set the scene, the Bible says that these Greeks, they had come up to worship because the feast of Passover was a just coming at uh coming at hand. It was just a a few days before the feast of Passover. These people, these Greeks were worshippers of God, Jehovah God. And they came to worship to Jerusalem. And the Bible says that having come to Jerusalem, they desired to see Jesus and even got in in touch with the disciples and the disciples carried the request to Jesus. Now I get the scene. So now they want to see him. That is the question. And Jesus answered and saying the first thing he said, "The hour is come." Now he's talking about a season. He's he's going to inform and bring his disciples into an understanding. The hour has come. So now a season has arrived. And they may have, you know, been startled. No doubt where. These Greeks want to see you. These are worshippers that have come. They've gathered to Jerusalem. They've come for the Passover. They've come for the great feast. They only worship the God of Israel. And they've come here to worship. And they want to see you. They want to see Jesus. And so the hour, he says, the hour has come. That the Son of Man should be glorified. And I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. Now, you see, really what we're looking at is this, that the life of God that was being manifested in Jesus Christ was really a mystery. It was a mystery because uh even though the people and many many of them looked upon Jesus physically they never never got the revelation. That's why Jesus said who do men say that I am but who do you say that I am? And Peter said thou art the Christ. I've been speaking on the power of revelation and that's what I continue on because then when Peter said thou art the Christ the son of God Jesus said blessed art thou Simon Barjonah flesh and blood hath not reveal this unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say unto you upon this rock this is a powerful foundation you can't take this lightly upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it will not prevail against the revelation of who Jesus Christ is at the current moment &gt;&gt; at this time not in history not who he was but who he is that's the revelation of who he is and that was the mystery it was a mystery to them it was a mystery to the most of the people but Andrew and and Philillip of course they knew who he was so they came to him saying these people want to see you. They want to know who you are. He said the hour's come and the son of man will be must be glorified will be glorified and except a corn of wheat. So now the thing was uh Jesus Christ was the word in flesh and the let's just put it this way the life that God was manifesting a little at a time unfolding a little at a time but it was essentially sealed. I want you to catch that. It was essentially sealed in Christ Jesus. that life would not really be released until he had suffered, died, and was buried, risen again, and then that life would be released if it's expedient for you that that I leave, that I go, for if I do not go, the Holy Spirit will not come. The comforter will not come unless that comforter, unless that Holy Ghost came. That life that was in Christ would not be released and he would not be glorified because he must be glorified amongst his saints. In fact, as the scripture says that the wife, the woman is the glory of the man and the church is the glory of Christ. He he that life that was sealed in him had to be released and once it was released he would be glorified and that is why he said uh the voice came and said I have both glorified it and will glorify it again because there was a glorifi he was being glorified in his saints then and would be glorified in brother Brandham at the in the seals in the seals book he comes at the beginning of the seals and and reads the scripture out of revelation and and then refers back to this one. When the voice thundered out, I have glorified it. And some said, an angel spake to him. And others said, it thundered. And Jesus said what it was. Jesus articulated what the words. The people heard the sound. They knew something supernatural. Oh, something is happening. Something's happened. Something an angel spoke to him. Another one says, "No, it was a thunder." They were confused and neither one of them were right. It was the voice of Almighty God saying that I have I have glorified it and will glorify it again. And Jesus told them what the voice articulated. &gt;&gt; The same as it was with the Apostle Paul when he when the voice spoke out and the people didn't they heard the sound but they didn't know what it said. But within the sound was the articulation of of the of the words. Saul Saul why persecutest thou me? That was only for Saul to hear. The others didn't hear it. They only heard a sound. There was a blast. And in this day, there was a message. We can call it a blast. And a lot of people say that's a sound. My what a screaming voice. What a sound. We don't understand it. Oh, it's just a bunch of judgment. It's just a bunch of this. It's contradictory. Uh, you know, it says one thing and then he says another thing and so it's just a sound. It's an angel. It's a thunder. It's this. It's that. It's something else. But to those to whom God would reveal himself, it's Christ speaking to his bride. &gt;&gt; And that happens to be a very different thing. We're we're not unduly enthused, friends. We're not unduly enthused. In fact, we're not enthused enough &gt;&gt; about what is taking place. And so Jesus was saying that except a corn and wheat fall into the ground, but let me say to you, but when it falls into the ground at its ordained time, it begins, it bursts forth with life. And there's nothing in a devil's world. There's nothing that can stop it. There is no government. There is no discouragement. There's no sickness. There's no nothing that can stop that life. People can speak against it. You can get all kinds of criticism. You can get all kinds of persecution. It can be physical. It can be mental. It can be this kind of abuse or that kind of abuse. They can say what they want. But they cannot stop that life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cannot stop it. I can tell you whatever you're going through today or whatever you may go through tomorrow, nothing can stop that life. I don't care whether it's your whether the young people in school or the men in the workplace or the women with the children or whatever it might be. It cannot stop that life. &gt;&gt; Cannot under any condition. &gt;&gt; You know, as you drive along the highways, you'll see uh signs occasionally and they say something like this. dangerous uh dangerous materials route. That is where trucks who are hauling dangerous materials. They must go a certain direction because they have sealed containers. and those sealed containers in the event there was an accident of some kind and then they would begin to seep or leak out some of the dangerous materials or gas or whatever more. They'd have to evacuate a vast area and of course it has happened. There was a tragic accident just north in Edmonton just the night we arrived. It was really tragic where a tanker truck tried to buy tried to pass a a a bus and the bus there had been an accident and the bus had stopped and the cars were turning and going back and so the bus backed up and got its wheels stuck just off the pavement and it was trying to maneuver and so some of the people actually got off the bus and this tanker truck was coming down the road. Several cars had pulled out past the bus saw it. But somehow the tanker truck, I understand, saw at the last moment and pulled out, but he had a pup trailer on behind and the trailer came right slamming into the bus and killed four people instantly. The bus apparently flipped over on some people that were standing on the side of the road. Thought they were safe. Of course, it's really tragic. Over 20ome people, they said it's the worst accident in Alberta in over about 25 years. and the queen and her husband who were just visiting sent condolences to the family and all the rest of it. But they have certain they have certain routes, certain highway designated where where sealed containers of dangerous materials must be taken. Well, I I tell you man does his best. We knew nothing of that not very many years ago because there was not transporting of such dangerous chemicals and materials. But in this day, we have a lot of that. And we'll find it right here in this whole area here in the Pacific Northwest. You'll find it. I'm talking about another material. It's it's dangerous to some people, &gt;&gt; but it's not dangerous to others. It's a lifegiving. It's a life force. A life force. It's not a religion. It has nothing to do with Cloverdale Bible Way. It has nothing to do with the name of any other church. It is a life force of almighty God, the creator of heavens and earth. And he has sealed, he has sealed a part of his own being, a part of his own life into other vessels of clay. This is his. And you are sealed by the Holy Ghost. And God only lets out what he wants to let out. He only reveals what he wants to reveal. He only reveals when he wants to reveal and he only reveals to whom he wants to reveal. &gt;&gt; It is dangerous also. It's dangerous for some. It's dangerous for those who mock. It's dangerous for those who misunderstand. It's dangerous for those who reject. It's dangerous for the world. Because the same water that saved Noah was the same water that destroyed the unbeliever. &gt;&gt; The same Jesus Christ with all of his love and compassion that saved and paid the price for the penalty of the world. But for those that disbelieved, it was judgment upon them. &gt;&gt; And I've seen it. &gt;&gt; I've seen it over and over again. And so Jesus is saying here in this season, the season that it is to be released. And so you you see the scene now you just if you catch the scene here, it replicates now in in in our time. And so now he is not only saying it's not only that a life is sealed within himself which is the seed and he's saying except a corn wheat or kernel of wheat fall into the ground it abides alone. Why does it abide alone? Cuz the life is sealed in it. But if it if it falls into the ground now there's another there's there's something that I want to compound here. Brother Brandham says that that seed can be in the earth. But at the time when the sun, the s u n moves near to the earth and warms the earth, that life that's in the seed bursts out and the seed dies, but the life comes forth. And now the earth, the earth as we know it as a as a planet had been marvelously marvelously visited by the soom. &gt;&gt; Not the su but the soom. There he was standing on the earth as it was as it were warming the earth bringing the bringing the people into a a knowledge that God had sent the lamb as a savior to the world. Oh friends, I hope you can catch what I am seeing. And the earth was being warmed. A season had come. He said the hour is here. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for another time. The hour has come when God when the I will be glorified. Hallelujah. What a day. There never been a day like that day. &gt;&gt; There had been prophets and kings and Solomon's and and Davids and all the rest, but there never been a day like that day. And here he was. The earth was being warmed by the presence of the son of God. &gt;&gt; But it had something had to happen. This wasn't sufficient. This wasn't complete. like a man without his wife. It wasn't complete. He said a voice said, "I have glorified it and I'll glorify it again." And so Jesus in his answer is actually adding mystery to mystery. &gt;&gt; So we'd see Jesus except a corner of wheat fall into the ground, it abides alone. And so even the the life that was sealed in that seed is going to go into the ground. and and there's no way of them knowing. They can't begin to comprehend how is he going to be glorified. And this is the season. And so the life that was in him, the life that you are sitting here today, whatever degree of spiritual life that you have, claim to have, or ever will have was in him right then. And he's saying simply unless this seed goes through this process it will not be released &gt;&gt; there. It has to be released. But my message is once it's released there is no power &gt;&gt; no power &gt;&gt; in hell &gt;&gt; or on earth &gt;&gt; that can stop the life &gt;&gt; that God ordained to come forth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And my precious children, I will say to you, many of you, most of you have been birthed into the kingdom of God under the knowledge of this message and many under my own ministry. I feel to announce to you today, you are children of this revelation. &gt;&gt; You're children of this life force. You're children because of this release. And if it had not been released, you would not be here. But because it is released, there's nothing that can stop you. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can hinder you from coming to your ultimate ultimate destination. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what God has ordained for you in the maturity of Jesus Christ, there is no power. &gt;&gt; I don't care. I look down into you into the faces of the young people. There's no school teacher. &gt;&gt; There's no peers. There's no friends. There's no workmen that work with you people. There is no associate that you've ever had. There's no man or woman or husband or wife that can ever stop you from arriving to your destination. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's no failure. There's no reversal. There's no financial disaster. There's nothing that can hinder you from coming to your destination. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And why do I say that? Because I can announce to you, thus sayeth the Lord, the life has been released. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word, the scripture and the season had to come together. &gt;&gt; Even the disciples in their I will say in their natural love and affection for Christ. Peter especially trying to prevent Christ going through this suffering. &gt;&gt; Not for you to go to this death. not for you to be uh to to be accused of these uh Pharisees and these religious order hypocrites they are. It's not for you to become subjected to them. It's not for you to suffer under a Roman rule and a Roman sentence. It's not for you. You must escape this. But he says, "How then will the scriptures be fulfilled?" And so when the scripture and the time come into the same cycle, nothing can stop the life from being released. &gt;&gt; Thus sayaith the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hasn't got anything to do with you or me. &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with any other man or person. It has to do when the scripture that has been pro the prophecy and the season come together and are lined up then something's going to happen. Whatever God ordained is going to take place. And God ordained that this one, this word in flesh called Jesus Christ that he is going to he is going to come and be judged of man and suffer the death and die the death and be raised again. And my precious friends, it's not because we have a church established or churches all over the place and millions of people calling the name of Jesus Christ. But I can assure you one thing that if the people miss, it's not a matter of the mechanics. It's a matter of the dynamics of the life that is released from the seed at its season. &gt;&gt; But if it's not revealed to a person, they're not participants of it. but to you and that's why I spoke last Sunday lest we take for granted lest we underestimate lest we do not regard what is happening in our time can happen you can be born with a golden spoon in your mouth but you want to appreciate it &gt;&gt; and you've been born with a lot more than a golden spoon in your mouth you've been born with the fullness of the word being unfolded you've been birthed birthed in a you've been birthed in a season when the word's been released. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "The hour has come the Son of Man should be glorified. Except a corn and wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. Now is my soul troubled." I'm just giving certain phrases. Father, shall I say, Father, save me from this hour? For this cause came I under this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came a voice from heaven saying, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again. I went and I was looking at I thought it was s we would see Jesus. It might be show us the father. But here comes here comes brother Brandham with that kind of a statement. Show us the father or sers we would see Jesus. It's very very early in the ministry in Chicago or one of the major cities and the man a man comes before him, the first first person and he speaks to him for just a few moments and he begins to tell that man who he was. believe he said you're a minister and you're not from this city and you're from another city and this is the name of that city and furthermore this is your name and they call you this I believe it was Harry and you live on such and such a street and at such and such an address as I read that in in harmony in keeping with what I was reading and studying. I thought, "Oh, God, the dumbest people on earth should have at least realized something's happening that has never happened in human history." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When did a man &gt;&gt; tell me when did a man stand in front of people and said your name is such and such and you come from another city and that city is this name up in this state and furthermore you're a preacher and furthermore you live on this street and you live at this number. Do you know what the people should have said at least? I'll tell you. I'll put it in my language today. Something that's been sealed is starting to seep out. &gt;&gt; Something that has been sealed absolutely I won't say airtight, but I'll say wisdom tight. No amount of wisdom could discover it. &gt;&gt; No amount of theology could find it. No amount of education, no amount of smartness, no amount of skill, no amount of power, no amount of money, nothing could discover this. And so God took the ignorant of of the world and brought it in front of the intellectuals and the educated and the theologians and begin to give evidence something that's been stealed is being released. &gt;&gt; They should have caught it. &gt;&gt; It's being released. And they they not only should have caught it, but they were students of the word. They should have been able to at least say that is identical to what the Lord Jesus did. &gt;&gt; And if they'd have got that, if they would have just regarded that and said, "God, we don't know what's happening. We're not sure what's happening, but we're sure of one thing. You are the author of it." &gt;&gt; Amen. And what this mouth speaks when it speaks truth of his address and truth of his city and truth of his state and truth of his occupation and truth concerning his wife and truth concerning the secret of his heart. Surely we can say what comes from that mouth will be the truth. &gt;&gt; Are you afraid to say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Not at all. You believe it, don't you? Amen. &gt;&gt; How do people miss that? How do they miss that at that time? And we don't have to go back there. We want to make sure that we don't miss what is unfolding now. &gt;&gt; That's what we want to make sure. We want to make sure that we're right in the channel now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus said, "This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes." You know, the words of Jesus are so baffling. Sometime they didn't understand before the voice spoke and after the voice spoke and they said it thundered. Uh, an angel spoke to him and he said, "This voice didn't come from me. It came for you." That was amazing. He He told him, "It came for them and they're the ones that didn't understand it." &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. If you just read these few verses, you'll have to come to one conclusion that the things of God are only revealed by God himself. &gt;&gt; You cannot discover them any other way. You can't put just some figures together, two and two automatically make four. That just isn't the way it works. It has to be It might look that it might look as though this can never come together. It might look as though this is the most mysterious thing, but when God reveals it to it just becomes so simple. It's so clear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to bring this down to a practical practical terms before the service is over, Lord willing. We hear the word revelation. Revelation, revelation, revelation to some is the name of the book, the last book of the old of the New Testament. And to those of us in the message, we hear revelation all the time. And I've heard of people that had such glorious revelations and today they're not walking, I would say, in fellowship with Christ at all. I haven't got I I'm not I'm not swept off my feet by someone talking about the grand or glorious revelation they have. But a revelation, I would just make a couple of statements. If you have a revelation of Christ in this message, you will live the kind of life that that word speaks of and produces &gt;&gt; a revelation also. It it is it so compounds the words of Jesus and that of our precious brother Brandham when he speaks of the sun coming near the earth when it moves near the earth in the springtime. the sun. The su n moves near the earth, warms the earth and the seeds burst out their sealed life and it comes up and we see a profusion of it everywhere at this time of the year. So, revelation also means coming. It speaks of coming because the sun is coming closer to the earth. And when we speak of the word of God and people speak of the second coming of Jesus Christ, we're in that coming in that the sun has moved close to the earth. The son moved so close that he came veiled in a prophet's ministry. Understand now, brother Brandham have no ministry outside of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Neither do you. Neither do I. We have nothing outside of him. And so when we speak a prophet, it is the it is Jesus Christ himself in his own office. But now in this time of the reason, we can say also and I'm giving it in different language. We can say this never happened for all of these centuries of time. Why didn't it happen? Because the S N had not moved that close to the earth. But now he was moving close to the earth. What for? To warm &gt;&gt; the earth such as we see here. To warm the seed and to soften the earth and the frozen, cold, formal &gt;&gt; lives that we were living in needed to be warmed by the son of God in the revelation of himself. and it warmed the earth and the seed that was in you bushed forth &gt;&gt; and a life was released. And I announce again, I'm going to say it over and over because it's a theme. Nothing, &gt;&gt; nothing, hear me, nothing in heaven or hell or any other place can stop that seed and that life from coming to its ultimate goal. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah &gt;&gt; to God. God be praised. &gt;&gt; And so revelation is his coming. Revelation is also an appearing. &gt;&gt; He appeared. &gt;&gt; That was the purpose of the ministry to appear &gt;&gt; before the people &gt;&gt; to make it so vivid. Revelation is the disclosure of truth &gt;&gt; that was previously hidden. &gt;&gt; So it's a coming It's a disclosure of the truth and it's also an appearing. &gt;&gt; One last statement. Revelation is used to describe events or things or persons that hitherto or up till now have been withdrawn from view and are made visible to all by a manifestation. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly the ministry of you. Take all of those those all are encompassed in the ministry of brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say all of that not to give you information about his ministry. I give I say all of that to let you know that it was God releasing &gt;&gt; something that had been sealed. And in that release, the very act of releasing it was going to act on the earth, act on the vessels, and you were stumbling around somewhere in your life, in your lost condition, or maybe you weren't even born yet, but in the mind of God, you would come forth and you're going to come in contact with this revelation, with this appearing, with this coming, with this disclosure of truth. And that's why nothing else satisfied you. &gt;&gt; All the catechisms and all the other doctrinal things that you and traits and and all kinds of legalism that you were tied in had nothing. You're just going through the motions. But one day, hallelujah. One day here came an appearing. You saw something different. One day the s u n &gt;&gt; drew close to you the s o n &gt;&gt; and warmed and touched you so deep nothing had ever touched you like that and a life came forth &gt;&gt; it was released upon you and you are birthed you are children of this release &gt;&gt; hallelujah and that's why the seals the seven seals that which had been sealed seal it up John Amen. &gt;&gt; Seal it up. Don't declare it. &gt;&gt; Seal it up until a time. And he was holding it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Within the great galaxies of his spiritual work, holding it until a certain time. And whether it would be all these thousands of years, but then the time would come and we could say like Jesus said, "The hour has come." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say to you today, friends, the hour has come and the hour is here of the release. &gt;&gt; And this release is going to culminate in the ultimate release. &gt;&gt; Because that life that you have can no more be held in this physical body than the than the grave could hold the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you today is a declaration. Your physical frame can't hold what God has put in there. &gt;&gt; It's meant for a release. &gt;&gt; And the ultimate release is this old cage is going to drop to the ground and you're going to rise out of here. Hallelujah. You'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye. I spoke to Rod's father, Mr. Bergen, last night. I wanted to hear from his own lips and I heard his experience. I believe God does these things. I believe absolutely it was of God. They lost their daughter. She died here not very long ago, Rod's sister. And uh he told me yesterday he said there was a horrible emptiness within me. Nothing nothing could seem to fill that huge void. And he just kept describing as an emptiness. There was just a emptiness after his daughter had passed away and it was raining. But he it came to his mind to go and see her husband because he was wondering how he's coping with the loss of his wife and have children. She was a piano teacher also. Brother Ryan, gifted woman. We knew her well since a child. And the church here was praying for her. And so Dad Bergen got in his car and he went to drive to their place which is not far here from the church and he came around a curve I think in a culde-sac and he said he drove there was a woman standing there and had her arms folded like this. You know also it was amazing brother Rickart and brother Marco's grandfather whose trustee in the church of brother Ret sister Linda Maritza's dad also passed beyond the curtain of time and when he did he told us clearly he said I had I had my arms folded and he said the others the nurses were busy going around and and his wife was patting him on the face and he had already passed and he was standing there with his arms folded and thought, "What is the problem? I'm in full control. Everything is fine." He told me, "If this is death," he said, "It's just nothing. There's nothing to it." If that is death. Dad Bergen drove around this culde-sac and there was his daughter standing in a dress with her arms folded like this. And he said, "I have to speak to her." And he looked down to roll the window down and looked up and she was gone. He pulled right up beside her and stopped. He said, "The thing that happened is that huge void and emptiness as of that instant passed and has never returned. &gt;&gt; It took that experience. I would say God did that for him &gt;&gt; to let him know." But I used brother Bradam's words for him. I said, "God allowed you to look beyond the curtain of time." He said, "That's exactly right." He allowed me to look beyond the curtain of time. The life that God has released in this age, it's not like any other age, friends. This is rapture age. This is bride age. This is a different season. I need you to be aware. I need you all, I need the young people to be taught, to be learned that this is not the same. This is not another religion. This is not just some other, you know, new things that have come. This is not just a few truths that have been revealed. That's not what it is. This is the le the the seals which were on Christ himself as as he was sealed right then. We don't see Jesus. Those Greeks, the only way the Greeks could ever get to see Jesus was for him to go to the cross and go to the tomb and come out and the Holy Spirit come down on the day of Pentecost. And then the church was born under the release of the Holy Spirit. And then the Jews heard and saw who Jesus was. &gt;&gt; That's the only way they could see it. He was actually telling them how they were going to see him. But it was still a mystery. See, I can tell you that even though everything that God has sealed up for 2,000 years has been released and a vindicated prophet's mouth has declared it, yet it remains a mystery. But not not to those to whom it's been revealed or to those who have been initiated &gt;&gt; into the mystery. Something's a mystery. you know, we've got a number of clubs in in uh societies and so on. And we understand there's secret societies and I don't know they've got you know the different ones in the masons and uh you know different lodges and they have initiation rights that you have to go through and some are called very secret and they have rights and once in a while there's whispers coming out about the strange rights that they have because that is the initiation rights and that's where the word mystery in the Greek comes from mystery has to do with being initiated because if you're not initiated. The mystery is those who have been you've been initiated. &gt;&gt; You have been initiated. &gt;&gt; You've gone through the justification, the process, the sanctification, the sealing of the Holy Spirit. You're initiated &gt;&gt; into a select elect group of people. &gt;&gt; It's not my doing. It's not this church. It's God's church. &gt;&gt; It's God's elect. &gt;&gt; We couldn't make You couldn't make somebody elect no matter how much you loved them, how much you prayed, how much you did anything. It's the predestinated love of almighty God. And by his elective love, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He elects his own. &gt;&gt; This is his doing. &gt;&gt; We say this is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes. Appreciate it. &gt;&gt; You ought to thank him every day for it. &gt;&gt; Thank Thank you, God. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's how they saw him. The scripture speaks Jesus said glorify the hours come that the son of man should be glorified. Paul and Thessalonians said when he shall come to be glorified in his saints. Now the the the the coming that the denominations think of he's going to come you know just bang flash boom everything's all over and it's no how could he be come and be glorified in the saints this coming when he shall come he's speaking of the future when he shall come to be glorified in his saints there's going to be uh he he's going to move near the earth which has already happened he has moved near the earth &gt;&gt; this is in his coming &gt;&gt; and to be admired by all them that believe. &gt;&gt; What happens to the unbeliever? They don't admire it. &gt;&gt; They reject it. &gt;&gt; I guess this would be all right. Brother Don, if I mentioned, sent me a an email. the brothers, they get around and I guess kick a soccer ball on some evenings and they've been using the school lot across here and it's kind of taken up a lot of the time. So, uh there's a a ball soccer field and so on just up on 64th here a couple blocks up and I guess it belongs to the Baptist church and school. So they were out there kicking the ball around and the man came out and said uh we have to ask you to leave. So they said, "Well, is it uh you know uh is there a member of the deacon board or is there could we see the pastor?" He said, "We don't have a pastor right now, but I'm a member of the deacon board and I have to ask you to leave." and they said, "Well, we understand that, you know, there's insurance uh concerns and we we let you know that we are we are covered. Our our group is covered by insurance." No, he said, "It's not an insurance concern. It's what you believe and we have to ask you to leave." So, he couldn't even kick a ball on the grass field because of what you believe. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right, Brother Jim. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Beware when all men speak well of you. &gt;&gt; But when you have a reproach for what you believe, says you should rejoice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe in rejoicing? &gt;&gt; Rejoice. &gt;&gt; When all men speak evil of you, rejoice. &gt;&gt; You don't get down in the mouth when they don't understand. You rejoice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm waiting on you. &gt;&gt; I understand brother Tom was preaching in in Seattle and he got kind of wound up and said to the people, "You ought to stand and praise God." And the whole congregation stood up and praised God. He didn't quite Well, he said, "Well, he wasn't quite expecting that. So, I guess the preacher ought to say what he means and means what he says." They all stood up. But when I say you ought to rejoice, you just go right ahead. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Get off of my yard. Get off of my field. Get whatever more cuz you don't believe what we believe. Bel believe. My goodness. Now Jesus said or rather Paul said in Timothy and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness. In other words if it's a great mystery it's impossible for those that are not initiated &gt;&gt; haven't gone through the process &gt;&gt; to understand and even the disciples couldn't understand this process. uh uh Jesus they the gentlemen have come the Greeks have come sir we would see Jesus except the corn of wheat fall into the ground he's going into a mysterious process &gt;&gt; and abide it abideth alone I'll abide alone is what he's saying but if it fall into the ground it'll bring forth much fruit &gt;&gt; and they couldn't understand it because they hadn't been initiated yet but on the day of Pentecost they became initiated &gt;&gt; hallelujah and the life that was in Christ became sealed in them and then they und understood what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the gospel of the kingdom went to all the region and did go to indeed the Greeks. You go to read in the in the book of Acts and you'll find out the Greeks heard and saw Jesus Christ. We have a inquiry from a minister and he's never heard about this message and never heard about the prophet and he thought that surely if there was such a great work that had happened in the earth that he would have heard about it. But you know, had their leaders done what they should have done, &gt;&gt; they would have heard, &gt;&gt; there'd have been millions more that would have heard. &gt;&gt; But great is the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh and justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up into glory. And it's a scripture which was used many, many times. And brother Brandham used this language and I love it. God came to the earth in the form of man and unfolded himself, stretched his tent. &gt;&gt; Think of it. God stretched his tent, but the people didn't know who was in the tent. from being Jehovah God to become man &gt;&gt; to stand and stand the shame and the curse &gt;&gt; and be not afraid. He said God changed his cast from a spirit and stretched his tent to become us. And this is where brother Donnie Reagan got the phrase, he became me so that I through his grace could become him. Here he stretched his tent, he become us. that we through his grace might become him. Maybe you didn't know that's where those words came from. Beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation. Notice the title, beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation. You need to notice the script the the very titles of the messages that he used. He said, "What is it the mystery of God?" What is the mystery of God? Remember the mystery, anything that's a mystery cannot be known unless someone has initiated into the group into the uh we say the elect body or the club or the society. They've got to be initiated. In other words, they need to go through the same process. And when they go through the same process, then they know what the mystery is all about. They know what's on the inside. They're in on the inside of things. And now, Brother Brandham is saying, taking it from the scripture, what is it? The mystery of God. What is the mystery of God? God in you. &gt;&gt; And how will they see Jesus? How will they know God? How are people going to know God unless they're initiated through the same process and go through the same process and receive the same revelation that you have received from the divine Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hear me friends. &gt;&gt; They'll never be able to see it. &gt;&gt; Sir, we would see Jesus and maybe they think that you know well uh you know God did something or he healed me or I was able to stop my drugs or whatever more. All kinds of people are are delivered from those things without ever knowing. &gt;&gt; Everyone that Jesus healed certainly didn't come to know him. &gt;&gt; After he even healed, he came back and and asked and the man says, "Who is it?" He said, "Dust thou believe on the son of man?" He said, "Who is the son of man?" Here's a man already been healed. &gt;&gt; Miracles aren't new and miracles are no evidence that a person is spiritual. nothing at all. &gt;&gt; Understand it? &gt;&gt; But when you when you have a revelation, then you know that the son has come close to the earth. When you have a revelation, you know that he has come. When you have a revelation, you know that he has appeared. When you have a revelation, then you know that something has been told you that has been hidden and undisclosed up to this time, but now it's made known. &gt;&gt; And when you know that, then you walk different. You can say something's been released. &gt;&gt; I'm born into a different household. I'm born a privileged child. &gt;&gt; I'm born as a child of this revelation. I'm born into a different kind of a family, a society. &gt;&gt; I've been empowered. &gt;&gt; My father has a huge bank account. I've been empowered and he's given me the authority to sign a check. And whatsoever you desire when you pray, believe that you have it and you shall have it. That's according to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the mystery of God in you. The hope of glory shining forth the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now, and who is this MelzDC? Listen close. I think I've laid sufficient foundation. He talks about the sculptor hides a mask, puts a mask over his masterpiece. And he says, "All these things has been hid and is supposed to be revealed in this age." &gt;&gt; And now the Bible says that they would be revealed in the latter times. Listen very closely. They would be revealed because I'm carrying on. I'm not just saying has it been revealed. That's not just the point. The point is how does that affect me? Now what happens? It's been revealed. Yes. Oh, glory to God. I see it. My life is different. All kinds of things have happened. My family, my whatever more. Oh, it's been glorious. But now what? Oh, now we run into log jams. We run into disappointments. We run into things that we hear near and far and all kinds of things come our way. And maybe our plans are decimated. Oh, we thought this was going to happen. Oh, I thought it was going to be all a millennium when I came into the message. No. When you come into the promised land, the brother Brandham says that's when war starts. &gt;&gt; Just read what happens. That's when war starts. Is war supposed to change you? No. &gt;&gt; You think I'm just preaching? &gt;&gt; I'm giving you absolute instruction. If this was my last message on earth, this is what I'd want you to hear. If you're defeated, if you become defeated &gt;&gt; in a certain battle, are you to stop? Of course not. &gt;&gt; That's just when you get up &gt;&gt; and you say, "Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'll have a greater victory the next time. &gt;&gt; This enemy, this very enemy, you can read it in the scripture. The very enemy that defeated Israel, Israel rose up again and destroyed them." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my goodness, friends. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I feel like a man of war. &gt;&gt; There's nothing on earth, I don't care what it is, nothing on earth can overcome the power that's been released upon the people. I'm so glad that I can say at this stage of my life, with so much of my life already passed, I'm so glad that I can say to the young when I was your age, I was serving him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And nothing has changed. I'm so glad that brother Brandham could say, "This is the same gospel I preached when I was just a boy." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He never changed it. This God doesn't change. &gt;&gt; You think I'm too excited, &gt;&gt; friends? I tell you, I can dance all over this platform. I have such liberty in the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I'm so happy. I'm so thrilled &gt;&gt; with what God has done. It did me good. I didn't say anything to anyone else. I kept it as a secret. I didn't even say it to my wife. But I say it to you today when the Holy Spirit just spoke in my heart and said, "Challenge these people and especially these young people. challenge them to rise above just a normal average. All kinds of young couples, all kinds of brides and all kinds of grooms, lovely clothed and dressed in all of their array. All kinds of them come to the platform. I even said to John Sarah, perhaps even today, but not many will even last, &gt;&gt; let alone rise above the average. All kinds of them. We're not into just average church, average life, average home, average everything. This is an elect group. &gt;&gt; Not because I said so, but because of what has been released. &gt;&gt; Because the seals have been released. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, not because I just spoke that. Some might be offended in that. But not because I just spoke that, but because I can assure you that God Almighty has released things in this word that have been hidden all these years. And there is a, this is my theme, there is a power in that release. &gt;&gt; There's a power in the release. &gt;&gt; I can tell you what. If a tanker truck rolled over here at our corner and burst open and all kinds of costic and and dangerous fumes coming out of there, you'd have the police force and our brethren. You'd have ambulances and you'd have everything roaring in here with lights ablaze and evacuating us because there'd been a dangerous thing happen. That's that's you wouldn't have any choice about it. So get out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I'm telling you that the life has been released and I'm saying get in. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Get in. &gt;&gt; Get in where this life is. Get in where Satan can't come. Get in where he's sealed out and you're sealed in. You might say, "Is there such a place?" Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you on the authority of God's word, I'm sealed in. &gt;&gt; I couldn't even speak like this if I wasn't sealed in. &gt;&gt; And the devil is sealed out. And the doubt is sealed out. Hallelujah. To claude. &gt;&gt; It just rolls off my back like just so much water off the duck's back. All kinds of things. I stood before those people just with a few closing comments with the love but the urgency of the Holy Spirit and my voice trembling because not because I was emotionally moved but I was being so moved and challenged within my own heart and I looked around. There's my wife of 51 years and another few days sitting beside me and there was a grandson in the party and his wife sitting over there and their child and a granddaughter and her husband and their children and I looked around. What grace &gt;&gt; do you think for a minute I would be the worst hypocrite on earth if I didn't stand before those precious young ladies and those precious young men and was able to say walk where I have walked &gt;&gt; believe this word and you'll never be discouraged. You'll never, as the scripture says, you'll never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm glad I can go back into any city I've ever lived. Brother Roy, Brother Bob, any city. I can speak to anybody in that city and I don't have to be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We have nothing to be ashamed of. And you that feed upon this word, you'll have nothing to be ashamed of. And one day when you stand in the presence of God and this flesh is dropped aside, you won't be ashamed. The scripture says you won't be ashamed. That's what's been released upon you. That's what you have received. You will not be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Can you just feature for a moment of coming and standing in the presence of the almighty holy God knowing you have believed on him whom he hath sent and you're not ashamed. I say thanks be to God. &gt;&gt; That's what's been released upon us. &gt;&gt; That's what's been released not of our goodness. Nothing that you have done or could do or I have done. You will not be ashamed. &gt;&gt; You'll never regret following every word that he has sent and believing it. And I'm going to close with this. I want to make a message. I'm not even hardly started in my service. But I would like to I'd like to encourage you say, "What do I do?" I took the I excused myself a little bit and took the opportunity. I didn't ask John and Sarah's consent but I said John you have achieved you have accepted some real challenges and a lot of people here probably don't know but it was I think it was announced probably here at church but he he wrote his master's in accounting at the age of 22 and and received received his master's degree at 22 years old. And so I just said, "You're not afraid of challenges." And she has received some bachelor degree. As young as they are, I said, "You're not afraid of challenges." But I said, "Now, here's a challenge, and I don't want you to forget it, and I want you to take this scripture, and I want you to pin it on your fridge, and I want you to put it on your desk. Jonathan, be thou an example to the believers. Not to the unbelievers, but to the believers in godliness, in purity, in conversation. Be an example. Anybody can just live an average, but be thou an example. And it's a real challenge to us in this day that we're in. It's a real challenge because everything there is out there wants to reduce you down &gt;&gt; and make you feel very average. &gt;&gt; We're not average. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, friends. It's not average. &gt;&gt; It's far beyond that. If I'm going to believe this, then I have to tell you a glorious church without spot or without wrinkle. You'll never do that on your own. It's it's him that's already done it. He's declared it. And so, what can you do practically? This is what you can do. And you'll never regret it. I would suggest you take the message that God has sent. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I'm going to look for the I'm going to look for the uh the the time that Brother Bram spoke to this man, and I want to read it for you. But excuse me now, but try to catch my heart. I ask myself, how does a man come into such favor with God? I would be so thrilled, Brother Roger. I'd be so thrilled, friends, if God would allow me that kind of privilege and that kind of favor just once in my life. to stand and be able to minister to a man or a woman and to just have such prophetical insight that raise their faith right up and stand right there in front and see maybe a cancer or see some marvelous transformation take place in their life if you could just seem to find that favor just once but you know it wasn't his doing it isn't anything that he did. God ordained, "I'm going to do this and you have nothing to say. You never drink or smoke or defile your body in any way. For when you're older, I have a work for you to do." And a young man who tried to drink and tried to smoke and God wouldn't allow it. &gt;&gt; I guess you folks know I led the woman who tried to get him to smoke to Christ. I've told you about it. I have her tape. It'll never be released, but we taped her testimony. And she took a picture that a lot of the believers have and they don't understand where it came from. It brother Brandham sent it to her and she pulled it out of her purse and held it. It was cut in a heart shape from Bill. She said, "I still love him." I said, "Do you know what he was? Did you know he was a prophet of God?" "No, she didn't." And we spoke to her about the ministry. She came into the service and I asked her if she'd like to receive this Jesus Christ that Brother Brandon preached. She said she would. He was able for me. She says, "I was the one that tried to get him to smoke and he wouldn't do it." What a remarkable thing to ever dream that coming from where I came from that I would sit in Florida with my wife in a chair and talk to the woman that brother Pam talked about a young girl trying to get him to smoke. I can tell you friends, this is what I'm saying as I'm closing. When I hear if I could just have it once, it would mean so much. We'll never experience that kind of a thing to that degree. It was for one man. It was a one-man ministry. But the next thing that we can do is fall under the favor of the God that was so pleased with that life and with what was spoken. I feel as though if I'm under the umbrella, if I'm under the banner of what God did and the vessel. Can I just treat you like a class for just a moment? Try to view God who he is and what he is and the being he is and the power he has and the holiness and all. Try to view him for a moment and in that mind he says I'm going to hold some things. I'm going to hold I'm going to keep it a secret. It's going to be hidden. I'm going to seal it and no nobody Lucifer won't find out. None of his archangels will find out. None of the angels that fell with him will ever find out. I'm going to hold them. And yet prophets came and God anointed them for a season, for a certain time. And they could see that there was something. Oh, and Peter said they even they looked they desired to look into the things that they were seeing. And God held some things that the apostles never saw and the great early church never saw. And the martyrs knew there was something that was so real and so marvelous that it was a joy to go and be burnt in the martyrdom. There was something that was so glorious. It was so real to them. And God kept holding the secret, holding the secret and holding the secret. And finally come the time, the season, and the son, the soom is going to come near to the earth. So near. And he's going to come, brother DDA, into a humble vessel, an adopted, saved, and adopted son and going to take and bypass his mind and speak out of his mouth those things that have been sealed in the mind of God from the foundation and before the foundation of the earth is going to speak it. And that word is going to go out, be blasted out. And some will say it thundered. And others say, "No, it was must have been an angel. It must have been something else." or or we think that he's a crazy man or whatever more but there's a group of people that their heart got warmed and said this is something special I don't understand it but I identify myself with the God that could do these things and the God that has spoken these things and the God that knows all these secrets that God knows my secret &gt;&gt; and God I identif ify myself because I feel and believe with everything that's in me that you spoke these things and I might not be capable of any great work or any great achievement but the very least I can do is say I believe &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart and whether you send me any special vindication or whether you send me any special assurance. That's not necessary. You don't have to do anything special for me. You don't have to give me any special gift. You don't have to do any special. You don't have to give me any special blessing. I want to tell you, I believe what you have said. &gt;&gt; And I say to you, you're blessed. &gt;&gt; You're blessed. And you're children. You're children of You've been birthed of what has been released in this season. And that makes you very different people. The apostles and the disciples were birthed under what God was releasing at that season. And that's what made them who they were. A very special group of people. And the world knew they were different. The world knew they were odd. Like the little maid when Peter was standing warming his hands. Aren't you one of them? Your speech betrays you. You speak like a believer. You have a different language. &gt;&gt; I say rejoice. &gt;&gt; And again, I say rejoice. &gt;&gt; That God has been so merciful and so graceful to us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you people. God bless us. I want to thank him. I want to come before his throne with thanksgiving. Oh father, what grace is this marvelous grace of our risen Lord and our blessed Lord. marvelous grace that you've shown to us. Oh God, to those that may be streaming right now in in Switzerland, in Norway. Greetings to them in New Zealand and in Europe and Germany and Netherlands and wherever, Lord. And down in Zimbabwe and in Congo to the others who are just with us at this time, heart to heart and attribute to attribute. Oh God, we stand under this glorious banner of the revelation of Jesus Christ. Truly the son of man has been revealed. You have been revealed. And now Lord, I want to offer thanks from the depths of my soul for those this group of people that you have allowed and privileged myself to walk with and for us to walk together. Oh, how glorious, how marvelous it is. And Lord, I pray that you will keep making yourself more known. We hunger after you. We hunger and thirst after righteousness. I pray, Father, that you'll take and quicken this body of people. That you'll allow the cleansing flame and fire of the Holy Spirit. Remove anything that would be a hindrance to you, Lord, in our lives. And I pray you'll move us, oh God, into such a place of daily communion with you. I pray that the events of the world and of those things of our daily lives and our daily activities will not prevent us. Don't allow us to be caught up, oh God, with just this this passing day, this passing world, this passing age. Don't allow us to be caught up in it, oh God. May we be caught up in you. I pray that we will have such a marvelous relationship with you, the living word. Oh, glorious Christ, glorious Christ, we thank you. I ask your blessings now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. I wonder if we could sing, Brother Ryan. Beautiful Christ. Beautiful Christ. [Music] Beautiful Christ.

And if you have a particular need this morning, I can tell you right where you are. Whether you're present in the sanctuary or not present, maybe you're in some other place at some other part of the world. I believe and I declare to you that he will come near as you enter into a relationship of worship. As you just begin to honor him, to respect him, and to worship him, his presence will come near to you. And your prophet said in his presence, the supernatural is happening. You don't have to buy it. You don't have to do some big thing. All you have to do is just seek to come into his presence. Seek to have this favor with him. Father, help these people now. I pray to enter into this secret chamber, this special place. I ask that you'll come so near. Their hearts will be so filled and they'll just want to start to burst open until their mouth begins to express, oh God, what their soul is experiencing. Grant it, Lord. Granted I pray in Jesus Christ's name. [Music] Beautiful Christ. Beautiful Christ, King of my life. Is he king of my life? Oh beautiful Christ, my beautiful Christ.

And I urge you to enter into a personal relationship through the message which he has sent. Let it minister to you. Let it speak to you. Receive from him. You'll be strengthened and you'll walk a different life. you walk the kind of life that you would desire. Amen. Brother David, I'm going to ask you to come and dismiss us in prayer. Would you please our heads in Jesus name? Dear heavenly father, Lord God, we just thank you for the word that has come forth tonight. Lord, we just pray Lord God that you illuminate us, Lord Father. keep us from the things of this war, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, Lord God, we just pray that you fill us with that holy presence, Lord God, that Holy Ghost, Lord, Father, Lord God, we know we're a privileged people, Lord God, help us appreciate more, Lord God, what you've given to us, Father, fill us, Lord God, as we go out of here, Lord Father, may everybody around, Lord, see that we are different, changed people.

Thank you, Father. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. This young man here, you often see him sitting right in the front seat. Brother David was in the university in Melbourne on Melbourne, Australia. &gt;&gt; Coast, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; Gold coast. &gt;&gt; Near Melbourne. &gt;&gt; Close to Brisbane. &gt;&gt; Brisbane. &gt;&gt; Brisbane. &gt;&gt; Brisbane. Okay. I always keep saying Melbourne. Brisbane. Australia. But it's in Australia anyway. &gt;&gt; You were what, 15? &gt;&gt; Yes. 16. &gt;&gt; In the university. in university at 15 years old. Mom and dad in in Africa and he was in Brisbane and said every time he'd come here got to do something, wouldn't he? Then he get back there and you know it's just uh the world and education, all the rest of it. I just felt to have him pray this morning and to bring him before you and let you know. Pray for David because he has he'd have a good future. But he's he's laid that on the altar. Said, "I'd like to just be a blessing to the bride of Jesus Christ. He could go places in the world. He has the intelligence to go someplace, but he decided to lay it on the altar." I say, "God will bless you, David. Amen. We'll remember you in prayer." And every time he's come forward for prayer, it's not because, you know, it's some problem or something else. I always want to be filled with the Holy Spirit. I just want to get closer to God. And I tell you what, God saw you do it every time, Brother David. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Shake hands with one another, greet one another, and we'll see you this evening. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Thanks, Brother Jay, for coming up. [Music] Lord. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] We sing Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Lordship [Music] to God.
