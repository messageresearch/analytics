[18:28] Amen. Absolutely everything this
[18:30] morning. lay before that holy consuming
[18:33] fire. Amen. We just want him to have his
[18:36] way this morning.
[18:39] There's a request to remember our
[18:40] brother Abe Dick as he's traveling to
[18:41] the Yukon to help our brother Roger and
[18:43] his wife Sopsy as they are moving to
[18:46] join the congregation here. Just pray
[18:48] the Lord would give them traveling
[18:50] mercies and watch over them during the
[18:51] move down here.
[18:54] Amen. We have no other prayer requests.
[18:56] Want to continue to remember brother Wes
[18:58] Nyagard. I know the Lord is doing a
[18:59] miracle. His life, I've just heard a
[19:02] short bit of the testimony. It's
[19:04] absolutely supernatural. We're certainly
[19:05] thankful. God bless sister Diane. It's
[19:07] nice to have you with us. We've been
[19:08] praying for you and your family. God
[19:10] bless you. There's something on your
[19:12] heart that you just want to lift before
[19:13] the Lord. Amen. Brother Larry, would you
[19:17] come take us before the throne this
[19:19] morning?
[19:21] Amen. We open the service in a word of
[19:23] prayer.
[19:25] Hallelujah. Thank you, Brother Larry.
[19:27] Could
[19:29] we just bow our hearts together?
[19:32] Gracious heavenly father, we just count
[19:34] it such a privilege this morning, Lord,
[19:37] as we come into your house, Lord, with
[19:40] great expectation. We're so grateful,
[19:43] Lord, that we have a place of refuge.
[19:46] And we have a place of comfort and
[19:48] strength and refreshing, oh God. And
[19:51] Lord, we've not come just to put in some
[19:54] time, but we've come here believing that
[19:57] there is a God that speaks and
[19:59] undertakes and hears and answers, oh
[20:02] God. And Lord, this morning is no
[20:05] different. We've come, Lord, with
[20:07] anticipation that your word will
[20:10] strengthen your bride and prepare her,
[20:12] Lord. We're expecting, Lord. We're
[20:14] looking for the rapture, Lord. We're
[20:17] just desiring it with all our hearts,
[20:19] Lord, to be there and be ready, Lord
[20:22] Jesus. And Father, we just take this
[20:25] request for brother Abe this morning,
[20:28] Lord, for traveling mercies. And for
[20:31] God's hand and blessing upon our brother
[20:34] Lassard as he would seek to come and be
[20:36] with the assembly here. And Lord, bless
[20:39] him, we pray, and bless the the move, we
[20:42] pray. Remember our pastor, Lord, just be
[20:45] with him now. Lord, we know he's waited
[20:47] faithfully. And Lord, with great
[20:50] expectation that you will direct him and
[20:52] guide him. And Lord, we're anticipating
[20:55] the same, oh God. And our hearts are
[20:57] hungry and thirsting for more of you,
[20:59] Lord Jesus. Would you just bless him and
[21:02] anoint him now? Bless the service, Lord.
[21:05] And everyone that is gathered in in the
[21:07] sound of your word. We pray in Jesus'
[21:09] name. Amen.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:14] [Music]
[21:17] Amen. Why don't you greet one another
[21:19] say God bless you. Want to welcome you
[21:22] all once again. Thankful to have you as
[21:24] a part of the service this morning.
[21:25] You're welcome to have your seats.
[21:28] We have a couple announcements and the
[21:29] choir is going to come with our brother
[21:31] Hank Iver sit and sing for us. So maybe
[21:32] if they just want to make their way, we
[21:34] have a couple announcements. Um there's
[21:36] a reminder that the Sunday school
[21:38] singing starts at 9:45. So parents,
[21:42] appreciate if you have your children
[21:43] there for the song service in the
[21:46] mornings. It's important for the
[21:47] children. Amen. We appreciate our
[21:49] brother Tim, Sister Megan, and Sister
[21:50] Jessica, and the musicians, the effort
[21:52] they put into the service for the Sunday
[21:54] school children. Amen. And also just on
[21:57] a another note, um I have kind of a
[22:01] unique uh experience with this being a
[22:04] pianist after the service. I know we've
[22:06] made announcements numerous times just
[22:07] try to keep the fellowship down to a
[22:09] minimum in the foyer after a service.
[22:11] There's many times, you know, the
[22:12] service has been dismissed for 30, 45
[22:14] minutes and there's still people in here
[22:15] praying and I know we just don't think
[22:17] of it, but a lot of times I'll be
[22:19] playing there's just maybe a few people
[22:21] left and you hear laughing and talking
[22:22] and things going on. If we could just
[22:24] keep it either outside or in the
[22:25] fellowship hall, I think that would be
[22:28] um a help to the people who are in here
[22:29] and just be mindful of the spirit that's
[22:31] still in the sanctuary. This is a house
[22:33] of prayer and there's people still here
[22:35] that are, you know, meeting with God.
[22:36] So, just because you've been out of the
[22:38] service for a while doesn't necessarily
[22:39] mean that there aren't people still in
[22:40] here. So, be conscious of it if we can
[22:42] just keep the fellowship to the
[22:43] fellowship hall. Amen. We're going to be
[22:45] singing Give ear to my words, oh Lord.
[22:48] So, Brother Dave, if you could put the
[22:49] words up on the screen and you're
[22:50] welcome to sing along with us. We just
[22:52] trust it'll be a blessing to you. And
[22:53] also on the monitor, Brother David, if
[22:55] you don't mind. Amen.
[23:44] [Music]
[24:02] Heavy to my words, oh Lord.
[24:11] Consider
[24:14] my meditation.
[24:20] Hearken unto the voice of my cry,
[24:28] my king
[24:30] and my God.
[24:34] [Music]
[24:36] For unto
[24:38] thee will I pray.

[26:11] morning.

[28:21] Oh Lord, in the morning
[28:25] will I direct my prayer unto thee and
[28:31] will
[28:33] come.
[28:36] [Music]
[28:42] My words

[28:53] [Music]
[28:57] heart to the voice of my
[29:07] and my God.
[29:13] For I to thee where I pray
[29:20] my voice shall thou hear in the morning.

[29:39] will.
[29:45] Oh Lord, in the morning
[29:49] will I direct my prayer
[29:53] unto thee and will look
[30:03] [Music]
[30:06] [Applause]
[30:22] Hallelujah. We're going to have a baby
[30:24] dedication and invite our pastor,
[30:26] brother Biscll, to come out, brother
[30:27] Nathaniel, Sister Shelley, if you'd like
[30:29] to come and why don't we sing, you are
[30:31] my refuge.
[30:33] Amen. You are my sanctuary. Hallelujah.
[30:37] You are my refuge.
[30:41] Oh, and you are my sanctuary.
[30:47] And when I feel afraid, I know you're my
[30:53] hiding place. And you are my refuge.
[30:59] And when the storm is raging
[31:05] underneath your wings, oh Lord, I
[31:10] rejoice and sing. You are my refuge.
[31:15] Once more, Lord, you are my refuge
[31:20] and you are my sanuary.
[31:25] And when I feel afraid, I know you're my
[31:31] hiding place and you are my refuge.
[31:37] And when the storm is raing,
[31:42] oh underneath your wings,
[31:47] I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge.
[31:53] [Music]
[31:56] Amen.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; We say amen to every part of the
[31:59] service.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; And Jesus took time in his part of the
[32:04] service.
[32:06] Others didn't understand it, but he took
[32:08] time and he took
[32:10] he took special time receiving the
[32:12] children.
[32:14] And uh he said that suffer the little
[32:18] children to come unto me and forbid them
[32:20] not for such as the kingdom of heaven.
[32:23] And I thought of brother Nathaniel and
[32:26] sister Shelley Iverson coming not only
[32:29] with uh their baby son but the other
[32:34] two. So they have three. So must be some
[32:38] perfection in that as well. God works in
[32:40] threes.
[32:42] Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall
[32:44] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[32:46] little child,
[32:48] he shall not enter therein. and he took
[32:50] them up in his arms and put his hands
[32:53] upon them and blessed them.
[32:56] There's always something special about
[32:57] every every baby dedication.
[33:01] And uh as our brother Nathaniel and
[33:05] sister Shelley are bringing this their
[33:07] third son, they've named him Seth
[33:09] Daniel.
[33:13] He he doesn't know it, but perhaps if
[33:15] time goes on, he'll find out. his uh
[33:19] greatgrandfather,
[33:23] this child's greatgrandfather stood here
[33:25] at this altar
[33:27] and I had prayer with him
[33:30] and he was such a humble man, such a
[33:33] wonderful man. Brother Vanise,
[33:37] Sister
[33:39] C Ion, Brother Hank, s brother and
[33:42] sister Hank Iberson here. They're going
[33:44] to be leaving, but we're happy that
[33:46] they're here. Sister Shel's mother's a
[33:49] believer.
[33:50] And so this child has grandparents that
[33:53] are believers, but it was Sister
[33:55] Iverson's
[33:57] uh father
[33:59] and he stood here and I was so humbled.
[34:02] He said uh the day or two before, I have
[34:05] never been ordained within the message.
[34:09] I've been preaching for many years.
[34:12] Would you pray a prayer of ordination?
[34:16] And uh, brother Van Heath came and stood
[34:20] at this altar and we had that prayer and
[34:24] I felt so privileged. He was such a such
[34:27] an honorable man. And then it was a
[34:30] privilege for me to fly to Belgium and
[34:33] be there at his 40th 40 years of
[34:37] ministering.
[34:39] So this son here has a great heritage.
[34:43] Amen.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; A great heritage and we believe in that.
[34:50] Uh
[34:54] the name Seth
[34:56] is uh they say compensation or anointed
[35:00] compensation
[35:02] because he was one given
[35:05] in place in place of Abel. Righteous
[35:09] Abel.
[35:11] righteous Abel was slain by Cain
[35:14] and God gave
[35:17] uh conception to Eve and she had Seth
[35:21] and and his name Seth is the
[35:24] compensation
[35:26] the anointed compensation one given in
[35:29] place
[35:31] one to replace the loss
[35:34] but brother Brham takes it much further
[35:40] said Abel was a type of Christ.
[35:43] And when Abel was killed,
[35:46] Seth took his place,
[35:50] death,
[35:51] burial, that was Abel's part and Seth's
[35:55] part was resurrection.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; And I thought that was so appropriate
[35:59] because that's my that's my message this
[36:02] morning.
[36:03] And I thought that's really wonderful
[36:05] that I'm able to dedicate a son whose
[36:08] name is Seth, who's a type of Christ
[36:11] resurrection.
[36:13] And I am praying that he will be
[36:16] a
[36:18] a a spirit of resurrection within your
[36:21] family, brother Nathaniel, Sister
[36:23] Shelly,
[36:25] that he will be
[36:27] uh something that is is quickening with
[36:31] life and that God will do something
[36:34] special for him.
[36:37] He said also that God raised up Seth to
[36:39] take his place, take Christ's place. He
[36:43] said, "And then the generations after
[36:45] Seth, the generations
[36:47] started moving on between right and
[36:50] wrong." May God give this son a great
[36:55] sense of what is right and what is
[36:57] wrong. And may he also follow the
[37:00] footsteps of Daniel.
[37:03] Daniel, God is my judge.
[37:06] And when Daniel knew
[37:09] that the writing was signed, he went
[37:12] into his house and his windows being
[37:15] open in his chamber. He prayed towards
[37:18] Jerusalem. He knelt upon his knees
[37:21] three times a day. And he prayed and
[37:24] gave thanks before God
[37:27] as he did before time. May he be a a man
[37:31] of worship. May he be a man of prayer.
[37:33] May be he a man of faith and may he be a
[37:37] a lad who's not not ashamed. I thought
[37:40] of four things I'd like to say
[37:44] and these are from the message. I
[37:47] thought, what kind of a heart would I
[37:49] pray that God should give him?
[37:54] That he might have a heart to listen to
[37:57] God.
[38:01] That he'd have a heart to do it and
[38:04] appreciate the leading of the Holy
[38:06] Spirit.
[38:09] that he would have a heart
[38:12] to receive the Holy Spirit and desire
[38:15] that
[38:17] and may God give him a heart to stay
[38:19] true to him.
[38:22] And on that basis,
[38:24] we'll take and pray a prayer of
[38:26] dedication.
[38:31] He'll probably need that.
[38:35] Seth Daniel,
[38:39] son of resurrection.
[38:42] Hallelujah.
[38:46] I think I know how to do that, too.
[38:51] We'll just pray. Heavenly Father,
[38:55] we hold this gem in our hands, a child
[38:58] that you have given to our brother
[39:00] Nathaniel and sister Shelly. I pray that
[39:03] you will receive him now. Oh God, I pray
[39:07] that your Holy Spirit will be upon him.
[39:10] I pray, oh God, that he might come to
[39:12] know you in the power of the
[39:13] resurrection that he might come to know
[39:16] you whom to know is life eternal that he
[39:19] might be filled with the Holy Spirit
[39:22] that as he hears your name, Lord, he
[39:24] will receive you. And father, I take and
[39:28] dedicate Seth Daniel to you in the name
[39:32] of Jesus Christ. And I pray, oh God,
[39:35] that he will not only come to know you,
[39:38] but he will be such a blessing in the
[39:40] home and in the family in Jesus' name.
[39:43] As you give him to them, I give him back
[39:46] to you in Jesus' name. Amen.
[39:51] Amen.
[39:53] Amen. See, he quietened down soon as I
[39:55] said amen.
[39:59] God bless you, Sister Shelly. Give you
[40:02] grace to raise three sons.
[40:05] Bless you, brother Nathaniel. Amen.
[40:14] Hallelujah.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; I don't worry about them over when they
[40:18] fuss. Brother Brandham said that's the
[40:20] only way they've got us saying, letting
[40:22] you know. they they need something or
[40:25] whatever more. Uh
[40:30] you know, you learn a few things as you
[40:32] walk down life's way. I was carrying one
[40:35] of my d girls. I won't tell you which
[40:37] one. And I was going down through the
[40:40] shopping center and everything and I was
[40:42] buying some things and so on so forth.
[40:45] And she was squirming and I said, "Sit
[40:48] still. Sit still." you know, and she
[40:50] kept squirming and squirming and I give
[40:52] her a little tap, you know, and just sit
[40:56] still, you know, stand still. I got Then
[40:58] I found out later I had a fish hook in
[41:00] my pocket
[41:03] and and a little and the hook had kind
[41:05] of gone through the shirt, you know, and
[41:07] it was scratching her.
[41:10] So, that was my fault. I was happy after
[41:13] I didn't hit her too hard.
[41:19] Amen.
[41:20] Isn't this wonderful?
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Well, some of our people are away on on
[41:25] a spring break, but we're here on a
[41:27] break, too.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I just said to the brothers
[41:31] in the uh in the study, you know, when
[41:36] we were we had our family, and I guess
[41:38] there were spring breaks. I don't know.
[41:40] I I never got to if if we got to take a
[41:44] little vacation once a year, we just
[41:45] felt we were real lucky and uh all these
[41:48] days off and professional days and
[41:51] teachers holidays and all kinds of
[41:53] things. My goodness. Well, anyway,
[41:58] it's another time, isn't it?
[42:01] Amen.
[42:03] Well, I'll have you
[42:05] uh just give me your attention for a
[42:07] moment. I want to read a bit of a a a
[42:09] testimony
[42:11] and this is uh from our brother and
[42:14] sister Nyiggard and sister Diane has
[42:18] handed this uh to us. We won't read it
[42:21] all, but we will simply tell you as most
[42:23] of you know that brother Wes had a a
[42:26] stroke and uh when he went into the
[42:30] emergency
[42:32] his uh blood pressure was 217 217 over
[42:37] 138 and they had tried 7 to 8 times and
[42:41] I believe if I remember correctly it was
[42:43] eight times because they gave him they
[42:46] gave him a shot while I was there with
[42:49] IV medication. to lower it to 110 rate
[42:54] uh on the lower number so they could run
[42:57] some other tests and they said that to
[43:00] determine what was going on but it
[43:02] wasn't happening and I just happened to
[43:04] be there when they had brought them in
[43:06] after some tests and they couldn't seem
[43:08] to get this blood pressure down. So, uh,
[43:11] we all joined in prayer
[43:14] and brother West, Sister Dan, myself
[43:17] and, uh, we just had prayer and I I was
[43:20] watching and I noticed it was going down
[43:21] and she said that the blood pressure
[43:23] dropped down to 170 over 110, which is
[43:26] what they wanted and get a proper read
[43:30] for his CT scan, etc. He could not walk
[43:34] on his own or use his right hand, could
[43:37] not dress, could not feed himself.
[43:41] and could not bathe and his speech was
[43:43] only very very slightly affected.
[43:47] But she said, "We have uh we have a
[43:49] wonderful praise report to pass on to
[43:51] all.
[43:53] He has made a miraculous recovery
[43:55] already. Our God is so great and has
[43:59] truly touched him. He is doing
[44:01] everything on his own at 90% or more
[44:04] already. It has only been 20 days and
[44:07] one week of that was in the hospital. So
[44:11] 20 days and one week of the 20 days was
[44:13] in the hospital getting his blood
[44:15] pressure down to a reasonable safe level
[44:18] uh to start rehab. The prognosis was for
[44:22] a good outcome for recovery within two
[44:25] months to a year.
[44:27] Wes has great determination and
[44:29] perseverance
[44:31] uh perseverance and says with all the
[44:34] prayers that are going up on his behalf
[44:38] that he can definitely he wants to do
[44:41] his part and work hard and we are so
[44:44] humbled to appreciate and feel the
[44:47] effects of the prayers and outpouring of
[44:49] love on his behalf. His physical
[44:52] therapists and occupational therapists
[44:55] have said that he is a miracle and a
[44:58] remarkable story. His outpatient
[45:01] physical therapist says she thinks a
[45:04] couple more weeks at the most and he
[45:07] will be 100%.
[45:09] We saw his outpatient uh occupational
[45:13] therapist today and he said he was an
[45:17] amazing story. released him from
[45:20] occupational therapy because he's doing
[45:22] so well and just needs to continue his
[45:26] hand coordination exercise at home. I
[45:29] saw the neurologist today also and said
[45:32] he was very fortunate. The effects of
[45:35] the stroke could have been extreme with
[45:38] crossing of eyes and slurred speech and
[45:40] much much more. But the brain has to
[45:43] have time to heal and his strength will
[45:46] come back with his healing also. We give
[45:49] God all the glory. Amen.
[45:53] [Applause]
[45:54] [Music]
[46:01] Let's just stand, shall we? And I think
[46:04] it would be good to say we give all the
[46:06] glory to Jesus. We give all the glory to
[46:08] Jesus. Let's just sing it together.
[46:12] We'll give
[46:15] the glory
[46:17] to Jesus. Let's just praise him as we
[46:19] sing now and tell
[46:23] his love. His wonderful
[46:28] love
[46:30] will give
[46:32] the glory
[46:34] to Jesus
[46:39] and tell
[46:41] his wonderful
[46:44] love. Oh, let's just sing it once again.
[46:48] You'll give
[46:50] all the glory to Jesus
[46:56] and tell
[46:58] his love
[47:00] his wonderful
[47:03] love.
[47:05] We'll give
[47:07] our glory to Jesus
[47:13] and tell
[47:16] his wonderful
[47:18] love
[47:20] that has special meaning to me. I had a
[47:24] phone call for about 30 minutes this
[47:26] morning from someone who's in the
[47:28] hospital and doesn't know Jesus.
[47:33] He hasn't had the experience that
[47:35] brother Wes has had. I believe that
[47:38] brother Wes and sister Diane are
[47:39] streaming now. And I say, "God bless
[47:41] you, brother Wes."
[47:43] &gt;&gt; That you've come to know the Lord Jesus
[47:45] Christ. And we thank him.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't know him. You wouldn't be
[47:49] here if it wasn't for his grace
[47:52] &gt;&gt; and his great love wherewith he has
[47:54] loved us and made himself known to us.
[47:57] And I am so thankful that we know him
[48:02] whom to know is life eternal. Amen.
[48:05] Let's just bow our heads a moment in
[48:07] prayer.
[48:09] Almighty God, you're our father which
[48:13] art in heaven. And we wish to say and
[48:16] from the depths of our heart, hallowed
[48:18] be thy name.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come. We desire it. We yearn
[48:23] after it. Thy will be done on earth as
[48:26] it is in heaven. We thank you, Lord,
[48:29] that you have given us food for our
[48:31] daily bread. And that you forgive us our
[48:35] trespasses as we forgive others who
[48:38] trespass against us. Give us a nature
[48:41] and a heart like Jesus Christ. I pray
[48:44] that you will infuse us with the Holy
[48:47] Spirit. Oh spirit of the living God,
[48:51] come amongst us. And we pray that you'll
[48:54] bring your kingdom in, oh God. And all
[48:57] the glory and all the power belongs to
[48:59] you. And we say without hesitation.
[49:02] Praise be to God through Jesus Christ
[49:06] our Lord. Now Lord, take your word.
[49:08] You're the author of it. Anoint us.
[49:11] Anoint us, oh God. Anoint me to speak.
[49:15] May the people have understanding. May I
[49:18] have understanding and clarity of
[49:20] thought. Oh God, I pray that the spirit
[49:22] of revelation, the spirit of adoption
[49:25] and maturity will be upon us. God, I
[49:28] pray you'll give the people an intense
[49:31] expectation.
[49:32] Father, that your the word of this
[49:36] season may come to us. We pray in Jesus
[49:39] Christ's name. Amen.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. If you would open
[49:45] your Bibles, please. I'm going to read
[49:47] out of Philippians,
[49:52] the third chapter,
[50:00] starting with the verse, the 10th verse.
[50:08] that I may know him and the and the
[50:11] power of his resurrection
[50:13] and the fellowship of his sufferings,
[50:16] being made conformable unto his death,
[50:19] if by any means I might attain unto the
[50:23] resurrection of the dead, not as though
[50:26] I had already attained, either were
[50:29] already perfect perfect, but I follow
[50:32] after, if that I may apprehend that for
[50:34] which also I am apprehended of Christ
[50:36] Jesus.
[50:38] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[50:41] apprehended, but this one thing I do,
[50:44] &gt;&gt; forgetting those things which are
[50:46] behind, and reaching forth under those
[50:48] things which are before, I press toward
[50:51] the mark for the prize of the high
[50:54] calling of God in Christ Jesus. And I
[50:57] think that all of us could read that
[50:59] 14th verse together. I press toward the
[51:02] mark for the prize of the high calling
[51:05] of God in Christ Jesus. Amen. You may
[51:10] have your seats.
[51:16] I'll need your all of your attention and
[51:19] all of your thinking capacity to follow
[51:21] along because sometimes as a minister we
[51:25] uh reach out into an area and there's
[51:28] much in the Bible that goes beyond our
[51:31] capabilities. Our minds run out of
[51:34] space. Don't you find that?
[51:36] &gt;&gt; And uh quite often. So I want to speak
[51:39] on the voice of the resurrection.
[51:44] uh in speaking in the last few weeks,
[51:47] we've touched on areas and and sometimes
[51:50] we just say something and I see the
[51:53] little shock wave go over the
[51:55] congregation and and uh we maybe talk
[51:59] about it after the service and think,
[52:01] well, I I need to come back to that.
[52:04] Now, in speaking on the voice of the
[52:07] resurrection, I believe that we're in
[52:09] the the season of the resurrection.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; And I believe the resurrection and the
[52:15] rapture and the change of the body needs
[52:17] to be something must be something that
[52:19] is allconsuming
[52:22] &gt;&gt; upon the believers.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that can just be a
[52:25] casual Sunday school lesson.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; This has to be an objective.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; As Paul said, I press towards the mark
[52:34] of the prize of the high calling. This
[52:36] is something that must be on our minds
[52:39] not just on Sunday coming to church but
[52:42] each day
[52:43] &gt;&gt; we just have that while we're working
[52:46] while we're doing whatever we do whether
[52:48] we whether it's things we enjoy to do or
[52:51] things that are mundane uh sisters
[52:53] around the house caring for the children
[52:55] or brothers working things don't go just
[52:58] right we have our pressures of life but
[53:01] there should be just one allconsuming
[53:04] thought upon us. I am not here. I'm here
[53:08] for a short time. Life is very, very
[53:11] brief. It's very unpredictable. And I'm
[53:14] here to get out of here.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; I'm here to change.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm here in expectation of
[53:21] the change. We continue to do our work,
[53:25] live our lives, and however God uh sees
[53:29] fit to uh conduct to allow our lives to
[53:32] be conducted. But we have this one
[53:34] purpose.
[53:37] I when I speak of the voice of the
[53:41] resurrection,
[53:43] I wish to present this to you in a
[53:46] question. Is the voice
[53:50] just the hearing and sound of words?
[53:56] Or is it words and a visual evidence
[54:01] or demonstration or manifestation
[54:03] combined?
[54:05] Words plus. Uh not very long ago, we
[54:09] came to the school. The school had a
[54:11] science fair
[54:14] and each one of the students had a
[54:18] uh a display
[54:21] or a presentation that they had and each
[54:24] student was standing in front of their
[54:29] uh their work their I've been kind of
[54:33] searching the word today but you know it
[54:35] was it's something it's a it's a it's a
[54:39] display. It's a project.
[54:43] So, uh I think this was the winner right
[54:47] here, weren't you? Yeah. Well, you might
[54:49] as well stand up. This was the winner of
[54:51] the whole thing right there. God bless
[54:54] Ethan. Amen.
[54:59] And uh it was words. He got up and spoke
[55:03] some words. He expressed what it was. He
[55:08] was demonstrating. he was showing. And
[55:10] so we were able to see visually
[55:15] and to hear some words.
[55:18] But sometimes I think what we see
[55:20] visually perhaps can speak to us
[55:25] even louder than words.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; So now in terms of the resurrection,
[55:31] someone said to me, is it brother
[55:33] Brandham's voice? Said it wasn't brother
[55:35] Bram's voice in the first place. It was
[55:37] thus sayith the Lord. God was using his
[55:40] vocal cords.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; And so I I I want to I want you to think
[55:45] very very deep as we move in this at
[55:50] this season. If we believe we're in this
[55:52] season, how is it going to take place?
[55:55] And I may not be able to tell you how
[55:58] it's going to take place, but I think
[55:59] we'll be able to throw some light on it.
[56:03] We have in the message a message now
[56:05] I've heard I've heard but now I see
[56:10] what's brother Brandham saying he's
[56:12] saying well now that I see I actually
[56:15] hear better
[56:16] &gt;&gt; I hear clearer
[56:18] &gt;&gt; because I see it you that are parents
[56:22] you have children you try to tell them
[56:24] you try to tell them you try to tell
[56:26] them and how to do something then you
[56:28] say you might just grab a hold of things
[56:30] says well let me show you and now you've
[56:33] conveyed
[56:35] with more clarity
[56:37] &gt;&gt; uh what it is you want them to learn and
[56:40] now they have it and there are some
[56:42] young people
[56:44] who really need to see it done
[56:47] physically before they get a hold of it.
[56:49] They just can't seem to put the words
[56:51] together. And uh in a congregation like
[56:54] this, we have some of each. So the voice
[56:57] speaking the message plus the
[57:01] vindication
[57:04] &gt;&gt; the vindication combined. So the voice
[57:08] speaking it with the vindication
[57:09] combined could make and I was very
[57:12] careful to say could make up the voice
[57:16] of the resurrection. those two
[57:18] &gt;&gt; right
[57:19] &gt;&gt; now. Brother Brandham said
[57:22] there was 379
[57:24] times in 11 years that he used the word
[57:29] this is the sign of the Messiah
[57:33] or sign of Messiah.
[57:37] Sign of Messiah or the sign of the
[57:40] Messiah
[57:42] 379 times. I would think that that
[57:46] should persuade us to believe something
[57:49] extremely significant.
[57:51] And what was the Messiah? His anointed
[57:54] one who both died and res and was
[57:57] resurrected.
[57:58] And then many many times
[58:02] this is the sign of the resurrection.
[58:06] And furthermore,
[58:08] it was important also Jesus said, "A
[58:12] wicked and adulterous generation seeketh
[58:15] a sign." And actually, brother Brandham
[58:18] uses that many, many, many times because
[58:23] now we have come down into this age that
[58:26] we're in. Leodysia is a wicked and
[58:29] adulterous generation. And they're
[58:32] seeking a sign. And the prophet of God
[58:34] says, "And they'll get one." And that's
[58:36] the sign.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Now in the rapture message, I have just
[58:45] put together
[58:47] some
[58:49] uh some phrases. I want you to catch
[58:53] these phrases as they
[58:56] come.
[58:57] He said, "Now a shout." We know that the
[59:00] shout and the voice and the trumpet. He
[59:03] said, "Now a shout. Jesus does all three
[59:07] &gt;&gt; when he's descending.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Three things happen. A shout, a voice, a
[59:14] trumpet
[59:16] has to happen before Jesus appears.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham uses appearing and
[59:22] the coming and he says they're
[59:24] different.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; But now there are times when he's using
[59:28] appearing and I'm just saying this, this
[59:30] is from my from myself. there's
[59:32] appearing that he's physically
[59:34] physically appearing but he made it very
[59:38] clear that in the ministry that God had
[59:40] given him Christ he said he's appearing
[59:44] now
[59:45] &gt;&gt; this is the appearing
[59:47] &gt;&gt; so he has appeared so I do not believe
[59:50] this is within my own heart I do not
[59:52] believe that he's saying that uh uh
[59:56] three things happen a shout a voice and
[59:58] a trumpet has to happen before Jesus
[1:00:01] appears because you can't make a prophet
[1:00:03] contradict himself. He said he is
[1:00:05] appearing and he says that many times.
[1:00:07] He is appearing now but there will be a
[1:00:10] time and he also refers to actually us
[1:00:13] physically seeing him but we are not
[1:00:15] going to be here sitting here in this
[1:00:17] church or in this body physically seeing
[1:00:20] him. You're going to his dimension. He
[1:00:23] said, "I will come and receive you unto
[1:00:26] myself
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; that where I am,
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; there you may be also."
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; So, we want to take all of these things
[1:00:35] in in continuity. What is a shout? It's
[1:00:40] the message going forth first, the
[1:00:43] living bread of life, bringing forth the
[1:00:47] bride.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; So, the message and now he's at the very
[1:00:50] end of his life. He's at the very end of
[1:00:52] the message. The message is being
[1:00:54] finished
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; and that message is bringing forth a
[1:00:58] bride. So that has taken place
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; said also that it's a messenger getting
[1:01:05] the people ready.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; The second is a voice of the
[1:01:10] resurrection.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; And now the third thing is a trumpet
[1:01:15] which always at the feast of trumpets is
[1:01:18] calling the people to the to the feast.
[1:01:21] And that'll be the bride's supper,
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; the lamb's supper with the bride in the
[1:01:26] sky.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're right there." Ready now.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; You have to remember now this is
[1:01:35] December the 4th. There's just the
[1:01:37] fifth, sixth, and seventh to go. If we
[1:01:40] go two, four, six hours of preaching
[1:01:42] left. six hours of the ministry of
[1:01:46] Elijah's voice to the earth, the
[1:01:49] forerunner, and then he will pass off
[1:01:53] the scene.
[1:01:55] Now, the first thing happens when we're
[1:01:59] resurrected,
[1:02:01] the ones which are living will still
[1:02:03] remain.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; The ones which are living will still
[1:02:07] remain. The resurrection will set in.
[1:02:09] And I've underlined and don't read ahead
[1:02:11] of me please, but I've underlined will
[1:02:15] set in because you know sometimes we get
[1:02:19] things fixed in our mind and they are
[1:02:21] actually denominational thoughts. Back
[1:02:23] in back in the denominational world,
[1:02:25] they all have the rapture is a kind of a
[1:02:27] whisbang thing. Lights flashing,
[1:02:29] everything happening. The dirt comes up
[1:02:33] out of the graves and all the holes are,
[1:02:35] you know, the graves are around. That
[1:02:36] just isn't going to happen. That's just
[1:02:38] a bunch of fiction.
[1:02:40] That's not the way it's going to happen
[1:02:41] at all.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; So he said, "So the resurrection will
[1:02:45] set in first, the resurrection of those
[1:02:48] that are asleep. And there will be a
[1:02:52] waking time.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; And those which are asleep in the dust
[1:02:56] now, not those that are asleep in sin,
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; cuz they sleep right on.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; They don't awake for another thousand
[1:03:05] years. But those who are sleeping in the
[1:03:08] dust will be awakened first and these
[1:03:11] corruptible bodies will put on
[1:03:14] incorruption in the rapturing grace of
[1:03:17] the Lord.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; And then we'll all get together.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; And when they begin to get together,
[1:03:24] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:03:28] be changed. These mortal bodies will not
[1:03:32] see death, but just a sudden, just of a
[1:03:36] sudden, there'll be like a sweep go over
[1:03:39] us
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; and you're changed.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; I don't believe there'll be any feeling
[1:03:43] with that sweep
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; any more than he felt when he passed
[1:03:48] from time into eternity or that he stood
[1:03:51] at the platform and said, "I'm standing
[1:03:54] in two worlds."
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:58] uh I don't think you know he his
[1:04:00] physical body got weak from it but I I
[1:04:03] won't get into that but he said that uh
[1:04:06] and you're changed you're turned back
[1:04:08] like Abraham was from an old man to a
[1:04:10] young man from an old woman to a young
[1:04:13] woman what's this sudden change and
[1:04:16] after a while
[1:04:19] you're you're traveling like a thought
[1:04:22] and you can see those then who are
[1:04:25] already resurrected
[1:04:27] oh what an hour.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Then we'll gather with them and then
[1:04:31] we'll be caught up with them to meet the
[1:04:34] Lord in the air.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Wherever that is, that's where we're
[1:04:38] going to go.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Now, so th those are the uh just kind of
[1:04:45] a setting for the rapture.
[1:04:48] John, the Apostle John says, "I turned
[1:04:52] to see the voice." when he heard the
[1:04:55] voice speak to him in Revelation and I
[1:04:58] turned Revelation 1 and2 I turned I see
[1:05:01] the voice to see the voice when you
[1:05:05] think of that I turned to see the voice
[1:05:08] that spake with me and being turned I
[1:05:11] saw seven golden candlesticks and so God
[1:05:13] be to show uh the Apostle John his
[1:05:18] project
[1:05:20] and he saw the seven golden candlesticks
[1:05:22] and he saw one standing like in the
[1:05:24] midst of it. This is John who was the
[1:05:27] beloved apostle who was the one who laid
[1:05:29] his head on Jesus breast. He was the one
[1:05:32] who had access into Pilate's chambers
[1:05:34] and was able to get Peter in. And this
[1:05:37] is John who was a beloved. He's the one
[1:05:39] that Jesus spoke to from the cross and
[1:05:42] and turned his mother over to him, asked
[1:05:44] him to take care of her. He was a
[1:05:47] beloved disciple, the beloved apostle.
[1:05:50] But now he sees him in a different in a
[1:05:53] different kind of a scene. And he sees
[1:05:56] him standing there with his eyes as fire
[1:05:58] and hair white like wool, his face
[1:06:00] shining as the sun in its brightness, a
[1:06:03] garment down to the foot and the his his
[1:06:06] feet as brass that burned in a furnace.
[1:06:08] He he sees a different scene. And when
[1:06:10] he sees him now this time in the
[1:06:12] revelation, he falls at his feet as one
[1:06:15] that is dead. And he heard this great
[1:06:17] voice and he turned to see the voice.
[1:06:19] and saw the seven golden candlesticks.
[1:06:22] Now, there's a a central thought to the
[1:06:26] message this morning that I uh I I want
[1:06:30] to try to establish a fact and I believe
[1:06:33] it will help us in understanding the
[1:06:35] resurrection.
[1:06:37] God spoke through his prophets
[1:06:40] future events
[1:06:42] and then when the when the time that the
[1:06:45] prophecy spoke of.
[1:06:48] So he spoke of them and it might have
[1:06:51] been weeks, it might have been years, it
[1:06:54] might have been hundreds of years. But
[1:06:56] when the time that the prophecy spoke of
[1:07:00] when the time intersect with the
[1:07:03] prophecy, then there was a fulfillment.
[1:07:08] The world has never been presented with
[1:07:11] such a supernatural manifestation
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; such as we have in this day.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; And I keep confirming it to myself. I
[1:07:20] just listened again. I listened to the
[1:07:22] sign of the voice last night.
[1:07:25] and and and and these people that want
[1:07:29] to present that brother Brandham went
[1:07:31] into error in the end, they ought to
[1:07:33] just listen to the vindication of 64 and
[1:07:37] 65 and these last services.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; That angel of the Lord never once
[1:07:43] hesitated to come behind and confirm
[1:07:47] what was being spoken.
[1:07:49] [Applause]
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; And for my part, I want to go publicly
[1:07:52] and say this is a divine message. Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Coming from God,
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; using the instrumentality
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; of Luke 17:30, the revealing of the son
[1:08:04] of man, Jesus Christ,
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; choosing a son of man,
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; the virginborn son back then now took a
[1:08:12] redeemed son
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; and used him and spoke through him.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And I believe that that son was faithful
[1:08:20] right to the end. Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; And the world has never had such a
[1:08:31] visitation. Back in Pentecost, they
[1:08:34] called it the gift of discernment. Not
[1:08:36] the gift of discernment. They missed it
[1:08:38] completely. It's not it's not the uh
[1:08:41] gift of discernment. It's not the gift
[1:08:42] of prophecy. A gift of prophecy a person
[1:08:45] might use once,
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; might prophesy and prophesy once, but a
[1:08:50] prophet is born a prophet.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; He's born that. He's gifted that way. He
[1:08:55] hasn't even got any choice. He's born a
[1:08:58] prophet.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Before he was even conceived in the
[1:09:02] womb, Jeremiah spoke, God speaking to
[1:09:05] him, God letting him know, before you're
[1:09:07] even conceived, I ordained you a prophet
[1:09:09] to the nation.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Yes.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; You won't be comfortable here if you
[1:09:16] don't believe that.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; So, we have received
[1:09:22] now in the sign of his coming. In the
[1:09:26] sign of his coming, he just says I'll
[1:09:29] talk to her for a moment.
[1:09:32] Just I'll talk to her for a minute now.
[1:09:34] Not me, Messiah, but Messiah is talking
[1:09:40] through me.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:43] Hallelujah.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Not me, Messiah,
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; but Messiah talking through me
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; in the sign of his coming. He said that
[1:09:54] generation.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; He said that generation and this is it.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Would receive a sign.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; You believe this?
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; You believe this?
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; He said what kind of a sign?
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; This generation receive a sign and this
[1:10:09] is it. And what sign? As Jonah was in
[1:10:13] the belly of the whale for three days,
[1:10:16] the son of man shall be in the heart of
[1:10:18] the earth. What kind of a sign would
[1:10:21] they receive? A resurrection sign to
[1:10:24] show to prove a demonstration of the
[1:10:27] project that the that the tomb is empty.
[1:10:31] That he's not there. In fact, he's here.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; And he's not just 40 years ago. He's
[1:10:37] here. The exact same resurrected Christ
[1:10:42] is here in this building.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; And for those that believe it, you
[1:10:47] receive it.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; He didn't resurrect just for himself. He
[1:10:55] resurrected to demonstrate this is what
[1:10:58] I'm going to do. Children, will you
[1:11:00] believe it? Will you receive it?
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He died for us. We're so
[1:11:06] willing to give him our sins. But now we
[1:11:09] receive eternal life
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; which we are possessors of that eternal
[1:11:13] life.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; What kind of a sign? A resurrection
[1:11:18] sign. Jesus is not dead but alive. Now
[1:11:23] the prophets, apostle Peter said
[1:11:27] in 1 and 11,
[1:11:29] searching what or what manner of time
[1:11:33] the spirit of Christ which was in them
[1:11:37] did signify. So now they're searching
[1:11:41] of what manner of time when was the time
[1:11:44] going to intersect with their prophecy.
[1:11:47] What manner of time that the spirit of
[1:11:50] Christ which was in them did signify
[1:11:53] when it testified beforehand
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; of the sufferings of Christ and the
[1:12:00] glory which should follow.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; So they spoke of the sufferings of
[1:12:04] Christ and the glory which should follow
[1:12:06] and the Holy Spirit of God which was in
[1:12:09] them. And they as men and prophets they
[1:12:12] were seeking to know when is this time?
[1:12:16] When is the time going to intersect with
[1:12:19] my prophecy?
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Because they wanted to be part of it and
[1:12:24] the glory which should follow.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; So you see my thought.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; It is spoken but the time
[1:12:36] has to intersect with the prophecy.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Listen close.
[1:12:43] It doesn't have to be spoken again.
[1:12:46] Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham doesn't have to call
[1:12:51] the resurrection.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; He's called to announce this is the time
[1:12:55] of it.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; The resurrection doesn't need another
[1:13:07] voice. It's already been spoken.
[1:13:11] And now he sends a vindicated messenger
[1:13:14] to say the time has arrived.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; And all it calls for is people to
[1:13:22] believe it.
[1:13:25] [Applause]
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; When is it going to happen? Maybe before
[1:13:29] we leave church.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; But all that is essential to the
[1:13:36] resurrection is here. Yeah,
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; we can say the shout is here,
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; the voice is here,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; and the whole element of the trumpet is
[1:13:47] here. The gathering will be gathering.
[1:13:50] Amen.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; So the nations and the religious world
[1:14:00] and those elected, the nations and the
[1:14:03] religious world and those elected to
[1:14:06] that time. All needed to be in place for
[1:14:11] the scripture to be fulfilled.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Caiaphas had to be there. Pilate had to
[1:14:16] be there. Herod had to be there. The
[1:14:19] disciples had to be there. They all had
[1:14:21] to be there. They all had to arrive at
[1:14:24] the right time. And then it wasn't some
[1:14:26] great announcement again. It just
[1:14:28] happened.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; It just happened.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; When the promise and time meet or they
[1:14:41] intersect,
[1:14:42] we as creatures of time are subject to
[1:14:45] our surroundings. where
[1:14:49] you know things happen around us and
[1:14:51] civilization goes on. We don't have any
[1:14:54] choice about a whole lot of things. We
[1:14:57] just keep trying to make the right
[1:14:59] decisions moving along within the
[1:15:02] environment that we're this generation
[1:15:06] is ages is just light years away from
[1:15:10] what was just a few years ago.
[1:15:12] If I just talk about my youth, you might
[1:15:15] think we were back in the dark ages.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; And that's not very long ago.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; I went to work. I went to work as a
[1:15:26] young fellow in my teens. I didn't know
[1:15:28] what a credit card was. Never saw one.
[1:15:31] There wasn't any. I think it was one of
[1:15:33] the big department stores, Montgomery
[1:15:35] Ward or Sears or somebody was the first
[1:15:37] one to put out credit cards.
[1:15:41] We got we got cash in a little pay
[1:15:43] envelope
[1:15:45] and we lived on that cash till the next
[1:15:46] one came
[1:15:49] and just all kinds of things. You'd say,
[1:15:51] "Oh my goodness, how old are you,
[1:15:53] brother Biscus?" None of your business,
[1:15:57] but I can tell you it's not that long
[1:16:00] ago.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; And we live good.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Gas was 30 cents a gallon.
[1:16:09] And the coin in my pocket was 99% pure
[1:16:12] silver. Not the pot metal you got that's
[1:16:15] probably made out of beer cans.
[1:16:22] And our dollar was worth almost a
[1:16:24] dollar,
[1:16:25] not just a few cents. And we live fine.
[1:16:29] We live fine. And strawberries tasted
[1:16:32] like strawberries, not sawdust. Right.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; I could go on, but I've got to stop
[1:16:38] right here.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; And everything we ate was organic.
[1:16:52] It wasn't hard, but I mean, all this
[1:16:54] civilization
[1:16:55] has things got better? Well, I don't
[1:16:57] really think so. We won't get on that.
[1:17:01] But Jesus said, "But when the comforter,
[1:17:05] which is the Holy Ghost,
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; whom the Father will send in my name,
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; he shall teach you all things
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:17:17] whatsoever I have said."
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham in the future home
[1:17:22] takes that same that same scripture when
[1:17:25] he the Holy Ghost has come, he will
[1:17:27] bring these things to your remembrance.
[1:17:29] and he breaks and says, "Show you what
[1:17:31] day you're living in."
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is here to show us what
[1:17:40] day it is we're living in.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Been so faithful.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Now, he sends with abundant vindication,
[1:17:50] confirmation of the Holy Ghost all these
[1:17:52] years, year after year after year. Don't
[1:17:55] lose it, friends. Don't miss it. to show
[1:17:57] you what day you're living in. That Holy
[1:18:01] Spirit isn't off somewhere. That Holy
[1:18:03] Spirit is right here hovering over this
[1:18:06] audience dwelling in you to lead you, to
[1:18:09] guide you into all truth and show you
[1:18:12] what day we're living in.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And I declare we're living in a
[1:18:18] resurrection hour.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; We're living in a rapture age.
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:25] [Music]
[1:18:28] The resurrection by the voice of God in
[1:18:32] these last days.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; God foretold what was in his thoughts
[1:18:38] through the mouth of his holy prophets.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Now I'll take for example, I'm taking
[1:18:44] all of this time leaving the making the
[1:18:46] foundation for the rapture. So you can
[1:18:49] ponder the rapture
[1:18:51] uh a from the perspective of how the God
[1:18:55] dealt with the prophets in the past to
[1:18:57] give us a better uh a better position
[1:19:01] from which to project this rapture time
[1:19:04] and this resurrection time.
[1:19:07] Now
[1:19:08] the Bible says
[1:19:12] concerning the birth of Jesus and many
[1:19:14] of you have heard me say this perhaps
[1:19:16] before but not in this context.
[1:19:21] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[1:19:25] this wise.
[1:19:28] The birth of Jesus Christ is like a
[1:19:31] class was on this wise. In other words,
[1:19:35] this is how it happened.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; When as his mother Mary was supposed to
[1:19:42] Joseph before they came together, she
[1:19:45] was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:49] This is how it happened.
[1:19:52] And then Joseph her husband being a just
[1:19:55] man and not willing to make her a public
[1:19:57] example was minded to put her away
[1:20:02] privy.
[1:20:04] I'm trying. My screen has gone
[1:20:08] strange.
[1:20:25] But while, here we are. But while he
[1:20:27] thought on these things, behold, the
[1:20:30] angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a
[1:20:32] dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
[1:20:34] David, fear not to take unto thee, Mary,
[1:20:37] thy wife, for that which is conceived in
[1:20:39] her is of the Holy Ghost. and she shall
[1:20:43] bring forth a son,
[1:20:46] and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for
[1:20:49] he shall save his people from their
[1:20:51] sins. Now, all this was done.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; All this was done. Every detail
[1:21:01] concerning how it happened,
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; this the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[1:21:06] this wise. And then he details all about
[1:21:10] the birth of Christ in a current time.
[1:21:13] Says, "All this was done that it might
[1:21:17] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[1:21:20] Lord by the prophets saying nobody
[1:21:22] nobody an angel came and said, you know,
[1:21:25] and and spoke to her and so on." But
[1:21:27] there's no great announcement to Israel
[1:21:29] of what was going to happen. Things just
[1:21:31] began. A a a a virgin just conceived.
[1:21:36] Right?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; She was overshadowed of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:40] In fact is there was so little feeling
[1:21:42] with it and so little emotion attached
[1:21:45] with it that the angel had to come and
[1:21:47] tell her what had happened.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; That which is conceived in thee is of
[1:21:52] the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine having a Holy Ghost
[1:21:56] conception? You don't even know what
[1:21:57] happened.
[1:22:00] God anchored and the brother Brandham
[1:22:03] says God anchored the prophet's words
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; the word the spoken word that was spoken
[1:22:10] was anchored in her womb.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, if the word had not been
[1:22:16] spoken, there had been nothing to anchor
[1:22:18] there.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; So the time intersected with the event.
[1:22:25] The spoken word that was spoken came to
[1:22:28] its intersection with time.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; What had to be there? The chosen virgin
[1:22:33] had to be there.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Mary, the young girl had to be there.
[1:22:37] And and the others had to be there.
[1:22:39] Joseph had to be there. And Simeon had
[1:22:41] to be there. And Anna and and and and
[1:22:45] those that had to be there. And John the
[1:22:47] Baptist, he had to come just ahead of
[1:22:49] time.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:53] So all this had to happen. It happened
[1:22:56] on this wise and this is why it happened
[1:23:00] because prophets spoke it.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Now I say to you the resurrection's been
[1:23:06] spoken of. Apostle Paul has spoken of
[1:23:08] it. He gave it in Thessalonians the
[1:23:11] first chapter. Now comes the Jesus
[1:23:14] Christ, the son of man, uh, standing at
[1:23:17] the pulpit in a visual pillar of fire
[1:23:21] and all of the signs and wonders and
[1:23:23] vindication and people's names being
[1:23:26] told, their addresses being told for
[1:23:28] years and years and years and years.
[1:23:31] What's he trying to say to this
[1:23:32] generation? Trying to say, "Wake up,
[1:23:34] folks.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Here it is.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; This is what the first church age
[1:23:40] messenger spoke of. Here it is. You
[1:23:42] wonder what day you're living in. The
[1:23:44] Holy Ghost is revealing what day you're
[1:23:46] living in.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; This is it. This is what they've waited
[1:23:48] for.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; The theophanes must be moving close.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Very small step.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; So now we get the point.
[1:24:13] Behold, a virgin shall conceive and be
[1:24:15] with child, shall be with child, and
[1:24:18] shall bring forth a son, and they shall
[1:24:21] call his name Emanuel, which being
[1:24:23] interpreted is God with us. Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; So now the no wonder the a the disciples
[1:24:32] or I should say the apostles
[1:24:35] were desiring to know what hour that
[1:24:38] this was going to take place in then we
[1:24:41] can say now we've talked about the birth
[1:24:44] of Jesus Christ being spoken and then
[1:24:46] the event just happening.
[1:24:48] Now concerning the death and the
[1:24:51] resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:56] So David the psalmist also called a
[1:24:59] prophet but he wasn't a prophet at the
[1:25:01] status of Nathan because he didn't
[1:25:04] consult Nathan about certain things. But
[1:25:07] David said for thou wilt not leave my
[1:25:10] soul. He uses in a personal text,
[1:25:14] personal pronoun, for thou will not
[1:25:16] leave my soul in hell. Neither wilt thou
[1:25:19] suffer thine holy one to see corruption.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Now, he just spoke it. Then hundreds of
[1:25:24] years later, now we're into the book of
[1:25:27] Acts and Peter's preaching in Acts 2:24,
[1:25:30] whom God is speaking of Jesus Christ,
[1:25:33] and he's identifying by the Holy Ghost
[1:25:36] that has come into him. He stands up on
[1:25:38] the day of Pentecost. Now the Holy Ghost
[1:25:41] is present to identify that the hour has
[1:25:44] come.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Whom God hath raised up, having loosed
[1:25:52] the pains of death, because it was not
[1:25:55] possible that he should beholden of it.
[1:25:58] For David speaketh concerning him. For I
[1:26:02] I forsaw the Lord always before my face.
[1:26:05] For he is on my right hand that I should
[1:26:08] not be moved. Therefore did my heart
[1:26:10] rejoice and my tongue all was glad.
[1:26:13] Moreover also my flesh shall rest in
[1:26:16] hope because thou wilt not leave my soul
[1:26:18] in hell. Neither wilt thou suffer thy
[1:26:21] holy one to see corruption. No one had
[1:26:24] to come and make some grand
[1:26:25] announcement. It was already prophesied.
[1:26:28] Now the time had arrived.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; What brought him out of the tomb. The
[1:26:34] words had already been spoken hundreds
[1:26:36] of years before they'd been spoken. He
[1:26:39] didn't need another announcement.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; The rapture doesn't need another
[1:26:46] announcement.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet preached it so that you and
[1:26:50] I would know by the Holy Spirit. And he
[1:26:53] talks about the coming of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:55] in our time
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; to make known the scripture that
[1:26:59] pertains to us
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; to let us know the children, the time
[1:27:04] has arrived. Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; We don't have to sit and sweat and worry
[1:27:09] and and and twist and turn and wonder
[1:27:12] how's it going to happen? When's it
[1:27:13] going to happen? Is it is it his voice
[1:27:15] or whose voice is it? The voice has
[1:27:17] already been spoken.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; The voice is the voice of Christ
[1:27:21] himself. He's already spoken.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, all three while he's
[1:27:26] descending." Well, we'll come to that in
[1:27:28] a moment.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:32] Jesus said
[1:27:34] over Jerusalem, "If thou hast known,
[1:27:38] even thou at least in this day,
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; the things which belong unto thy peace,
[1:27:44] but now they are hid from thy eyes."
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Many things have been spoken of Christ
[1:27:49] and coming and the Messiah and all of
[1:27:52] that. Even all the way back to Moses,
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus was there as a type of Isa Isaac.
[1:28:00] Isaac was the promised son. Here's the
[1:28:03] promised son. But it means more to us
[1:28:05] today.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; The promised son.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Moses said, "A prophet shall the Lord
[1:28:10] God you're raised up like unto me." That
[1:28:13] was him.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Here he was.
[1:28:17] Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; So, if we could correctly place the
[1:28:21] prophet's ministry, I'm speaking of our
[1:28:23] brother Brandham's ministry in the word
[1:28:26] and in time, we would be able to see and
[1:28:29] know the day that we're living in.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm trying to give you a number of
[1:28:34] places. Now,
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Paul said in Galatians,
[1:28:41] "Wherefore then serveth the law?"
[1:28:43] Question.
[1:28:46] What's what does how does the law serve?
[1:28:50] What's the purpose of the law?
[1:28:53] It was added because there was a whole
[1:28:56] time before Moses gave the law. There
[1:28:58] was generations of people that lived
[1:29:00] without the law, lived by their own
[1:29:02] conscience.
[1:29:04] But now came a law.
[1:29:07] It was added because of transgressions.
[1:29:11] So then the law came and then people
[1:29:14] became aware I'm transgressing.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Because there were transgressions.
[1:29:21] Because of transgressions
[1:29:24] till or until the seed should come to
[1:29:29] whom the promise was made.
[1:29:33] So the law came
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; to show the transgressions
[1:29:38] until the seed would come or the
[1:29:41] children would arrive to whom the
[1:29:43] promise was made. Now, Apostle Paul is
[1:29:46] off in the New Testament and Christ the
[1:29:49] promised promised one has already come
[1:29:53] and he says uh until the seed should
[1:29:56] come to whom the promise was made and it
[1:29:58] was ordained by angels in the hand of a
[1:30:01] mediator. In other words, the principle
[1:30:04] is that the the law, what was the
[1:30:07] purpose of the law? Well, because of
[1:30:09] transgressions. Because there were
[1:30:11] transgressions. But that was until the
[1:30:14] seed would come until the children would
[1:30:16] come to whom these promises were made.
[1:30:19] My point is that the promise was made
[1:30:22] and maybe years later or hundreds of
[1:30:24] years later the children came to whom
[1:30:27] this promise was made.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; God spoke to Abraham told him your your
[1:30:33] seed is going to be in a strange land
[1:30:35] and they're going to be in bondage and
[1:30:37] after 400 years I'm going to come and
[1:30:39] deliver them. Well, that was already
[1:30:41] spoken to Abraham. I don't know who he
[1:30:43] spoke it to. But then the time came when
[1:30:46] the children to whom that promise was
[1:30:48] made was there and God raised up a
[1:30:50] deliverer and took him out of Egypt.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Until the seed should come to whom the
[1:31:02] promise was made. Now, in the rapture
[1:31:05] message,
[1:31:10] some of this sounds like it's repeating,
[1:31:12] but I need to repeat it to stay in
[1:31:14] continuity. The first thing is a shout
[1:31:18] and then a voice and then a trumpet.
[1:31:21] A shout, a messenger, a messenger
[1:31:24] getting the people ready.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; The second is a voice of the
[1:31:29] resurrection. And that's where I have
[1:31:31] the title to this message. The voice of
[1:31:33] the resurrection. What is the voice? Is
[1:31:35] it is it someone coming? And what's the
[1:31:40] voice? What is somebody going to stand
[1:31:42] and say? All you that are asleep in the
[1:31:44] dirt, come up. No, it's already been
[1:31:47] spoken.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; God even spoke to Daniel concerning his
[1:31:56] people
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; and said this to Daniel.
[1:32:04] And at that time shall Michael stand up
[1:32:07] the great prince which standeth for the
[1:32:09] children of thy people. Here's where a
[1:32:12] lot of denominations got mixed up.
[1:32:14] Brother Brand makes a point. Thy people
[1:32:16] which was the Jews. And there shall be a
[1:32:18] time of trouble such as never was since
[1:32:20] there was a nation, even to the same
[1:32:23] time. And at that time thy people shall
[1:32:26] be delivered, everyone that shall be
[1:32:29] found written in the book.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And many of them that sleep in the dust,
[1:32:35] not all, but many of them that sleep in
[1:32:38] the dust of the earth shall awake, some
[1:32:41] to everlasting life, and some to shame
[1:32:44] and everlasting contempt. Now that's
[1:32:47] been spoken.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; God never has to come and say it again.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Time will intersect with that prophecy.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Daniel's children,
[1:33:00] Daniel's brethren will awake.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they'll come forth from
[1:33:06] the dust. Why will they come forth?
[1:33:08] Because it was spoken.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; And it was spoken because it was God's
[1:33:13] thought. And God spoke it through a
[1:33:15] vessel
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; and laid it down in a book
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; and then it'll ha it'll just happen.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; When it'll happen, that's God's
[1:33:25] business.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; It my business, your business is to
[1:33:29] believe what he said.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; We don't have to have another sign and
[1:33:33] another sign and another confirmation
[1:33:35] and another sign. When God sends a a
[1:33:37] prophet that for years and years and
[1:33:40] years stands before tens of thousands of
[1:33:43] people and shows the sign of the Messiah
[1:33:46] and then tells us this is rapture
[1:33:48] season. This is a sign of the
[1:33:50] resurrection. I have one announcement to
[1:33:52] make to everybody at streaming whoever
[1:33:55] here. You better hear it that that's
[1:33:57] already happened.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; It's already been declared and God
[1:34:02] doesn't have to confirm it again. And I
[1:34:04] furthermore, I don't think he will
[1:34:05] confirm it again.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; It's up to you and I to receive it.
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; So the message he said is the shout
[1:34:19] in this day.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; It's only announcing that the day or the
[1:34:23] season for these things to take place
[1:34:26] has arrived.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; We're walking in the light of the hour.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:33] We are the seed to whom the promise was
[1:34:36] made.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; The children are here.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; We've arrived.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; John had to be there. Peter had to be
[1:34:44] there. I have to be here. You have to be
[1:34:47] here.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Daniel had to be there at at that time.
[1:34:53] Daniel had to be The Hebrew children had
[1:34:55] to be there. But we have to be here.
[1:34:57] That was their part. That was their day.
[1:34:59] This is ours.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:03] Yes.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; And no wonder the seals had to be
[1:35:05] opened. And he declares in the breach
[1:35:07] that this is the claiming time.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; He's claim he bought you.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; You belong to him.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; He already paid for you.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; And now he's came.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; In an adopted son to claim you.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Say, how did he claim? He spoke a word
[1:35:25] that you couldn't escape.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You couldn't get away from
[1:35:31] it
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; because it got a holier heart and he
[1:35:35] pulled you to himself
[1:35:38] fulfilling the scripture. I will come
[1:35:40] and receive you unto myself.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; He's already received you
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; to himself.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; He's the word and sent the Holy Spirit
[1:35:55] into you to let you know that the day
[1:35:58] has arrived.
[1:36:00] And I'm telling you, and maybe there's a
[1:36:02] pull in your heart and God caused me to
[1:36:05] come to the platform to tell you it's
[1:36:07] already happened.
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; He's not going to come and say anymore.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; He's already done it.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; So, I feel a pull. No wonder we feel a
[1:36:18] pull.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; How faithful he is. How wonderful he is.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; I'm so thrilled, friends. I just I just
[1:36:26] feel like stopping and going home and
[1:36:27] having a rejoicing time.
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:30] [Applause]
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Let's talk about the descending for a
[1:36:37] moment.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus descended all through the Old
[1:36:42] Testament.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; We say he's all he does this while he's
[1:36:47] descending.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; He descending for couple thousand years.
[1:36:52] That's right.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; And a prophet comes and says, "That was
[1:36:56] him
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; back in Abraham's time.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; That was him, Elohim, that was there.
[1:37:01] That was him that was Melzdc. That was
[1:37:04] him in the burning bush. That was him.
[1:37:06] The water coming out of the rock. That
[1:37:08] was him. The mana coming down from
[1:37:10] heaven.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; What's he doing? He defending,
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; coming on down, down. Hallelujah. That
[1:37:21] was him in David.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; That was him in Solomon. And greater
[1:37:25] than Solomon is here. What's he doing?
[1:37:28] Coming down, down, down, till finally
[1:37:31] it's an egg
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; in the womb of Mary
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; and he's descended into a body of flesh.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; He descends until he comes into a body
[1:37:43] of humiliation.
[1:37:45] Yes.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; A body that sweats
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; when he's hot
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; and gets hungry
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; when he's without food
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; and thirsty when he's without water. A
[1:37:57] body. Can you think of the King of
[1:38:00] Kings,
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; descending down into this condition,
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; descending down till he lost his
[1:38:08] reputation and was humiliated and spoken
[1:38:12] of as being of the devil builds above.
[1:38:19] descending until the most torturous of
[1:38:22] death. And we don't want to stay on it
[1:38:25] until his face was mutilated.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Not for him, for you.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; For me,
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; until it was unrecognizable and his
[1:38:35] beard pulled out and spittle
[1:38:38] from the spit from the drunken soldiers
[1:38:42] hanging on his face.
[1:38:44] right?
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Going to the cross
[1:38:48] and then he had to
[1:38:52] descend
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; to death.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; And he died.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; He died as a man.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; He was born as a child. Born as a man.
[1:39:03] And he died a man's death
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; because he was the man, the God man.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; God did not die. Jesus died. And herein
[1:39:12] is a great mystery of the godhead.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Not the third person or the second
[1:39:17] person, but the person
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; man said to me, "Well, how do you you
[1:39:24] believe Jesus was God?" Of course he was
[1:39:26] God.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Was he? But he says William Brandham
[1:39:30] said he was created. Of course he was
[1:39:32] created. He said, "Ah, nonsense."
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; He said he was God. This is the leader
[1:39:38] of the Pentecostal assembly. He was God.
[1:39:41] Amen.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; I said, "We believe that."
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; I said, "Just a second though. Did your
[1:39:47] God come out of a woman's womb in the
[1:39:51] mess of childbirth?"
[1:39:54] He's just looking at me.
[1:39:57] I said, "Did your God hang on a cross,
[1:40:01] gasping
[1:40:03] for breath and finally hanging his head
[1:40:07] and dying? Did your God die?
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; He couldn't answer it. I said, "You
[1:40:14] don't understand the Godhead."
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:40:19] to himself.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God was manifesting himself.
[1:40:24] Jesus healed because God was a healer.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew all things because God knew
[1:40:29] all things.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; But there were some things that Jesus
[1:40:31] didn't even know himself. He said, "Even
[1:40:33] the Son doesn't know. Not even the
[1:40:36] angels in heaven, only the father.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; He was the God man. You got it?
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; You understand it, young people?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; And he sunk down to death, descended,
[1:40:53] and died as a man.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; And then he wasn't finished.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; No. He descended further into the
[1:41:02] regions of the lost,
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; into the regions of the damned. And he
[1:41:06] preached to them that what Noah preached
[1:41:09] was correct. What Abraham said was
[1:41:11] right.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; But Job said was righteous.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Job was righteous and all his other
[1:41:17] friends and whatever more. And he
[1:41:19] preached to the souls in prison.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; And he descended further and went to
[1:41:23] Satan's house.
[1:41:25] said, "You ory creature,
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; you oraryy one, I'm going to strip you
[1:41:31] of the keys of death, hell, and the
[1:41:34] grave. Tore them off. Tore the prison
[1:41:37] prison bars and the and and the saints
[1:41:40] came up and walked on the streets of
[1:41:42] Jerusalem." Do you believe it back
[1:41:44] there? You believe it? Up in the
[1:41:46] balcony. Hallelujah. You believe it.
[1:41:49] He's the one who's here.
[1:41:53] He's the one who says, "Fear not."
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's in you than he
[1:41:59] that's in the world.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's in you
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; than even Satan himself.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Because I live, he said, you shall live
[1:42:13] also.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Who is this?
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; This is the almighty God.
[1:42:24] Amen.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; But he descended
[1:42:28] to the depths. He descended
[1:42:31] and then he rose and ascended
[1:42:36] and then he began another descent.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He began to descend
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; down through seven church ages
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; down
[1:42:48] all through the ages and finally
[1:42:50] descended deeper and deeper until he
[1:42:53] comes into the darkness and the
[1:42:55] debauchery of Satan's Eden.
[1:42:58] Why? Because you and I are there.
[1:43:05] And he tears the bars open in Leoda and
[1:43:09] says, "Come on out, children.
[1:43:13] Here I am.
[1:43:15] Here I am. I spoke at Luke 17:30, but
[1:43:19] here I am.
[1:43:22] The prophecy and the event have come
[1:43:25] together.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; The prophecy and the time have
[1:43:30] intersected
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; and you had to be here.
[1:43:35] You have to hear it.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; I think of where we came from.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; I think of the people the from the
[1:43:44] colony, from China, from the uh Midwest,
[1:43:48] wherever we come from, come from
[1:43:51] Argentina or South America or Central
[1:43:55] America or Africa, wherever we were, God
[1:43:58] by his spirit found you.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He can't lose you because he
[1:44:05] can't lose one of his.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; And what was that voice? The voice of
[1:44:17] the resurrection.
[1:44:19] [Applause]
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, how are they going to
[1:44:24] come?" You've already heard it.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; The message can't be anything else.
[1:44:31] Jesus does all three while he's
[1:44:34] descending.
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:48] [Music]
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; He said in the deity of Christ, of Jesus
[1:44:55] Christ,
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is way back 1949 before many
[1:44:59] of you were born.
[1:45:01] God in the beginning made his first man.
[1:45:05] He made him out of spirit. And spirit is
[1:45:08] the invisible part of man.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; That you don't see.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Now God made man in his own image.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; And God is a spirit says the Bible.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; And the first man that was made had the
[1:45:22] government over o over all of creation.
[1:45:25] Just like the Holy Spirit has government
[1:45:28] over the church today, he led creation,
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; the first man.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; But there was no man to till the soil.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; And God made man of the dust of the
[1:45:41] earth.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; How?
[1:45:45] Well, I don't know. People, I guess,
[1:45:47] envision God taking clay with his hands
[1:45:50] and fingers. I don't know.
[1:45:53] I think he called for it.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Hey, you elements
[1:46:01] that I spoke
[1:46:04] 50 million years ago, aons of time ago,
[1:46:08] the pot ash
[1:46:11] be released,
[1:46:13] the calcium,
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; you come out of the earth.
[1:46:17] And I have a thought in my mind and I'm
[1:46:19] superimposing that thought on those
[1:46:22] elements. And you're going to come out
[1:46:24] of there and I'm going to have and I'm
[1:46:26] going to form I'm going to form the
[1:46:28] first man.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; He was formed. And then God had to
[1:46:35] breathe into him
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; the breath of life.
[1:46:39] This word,
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; this Bible that you have that is spoken
[1:46:44] by the Holy Spirit is nothing less than
[1:46:48] the breath of Almighty God.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; And that breath, listen to me, that
[1:46:55] breath can never be destroyed.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; That breath can never go to hell.
[1:47:06] [Applause]
[1:47:10] Hallelujah.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; And he said he put his he put this
[1:47:14] immortal spirit that never dies into
[1:47:17] this man and he became more than a
[1:47:19] brute.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; He became a man.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; And the seed shall not be ever with a
[1:47:28] shuck. Now 65. You're going from 49 to
[1:47:30] 65.
[1:47:32] Adam was spirit to begin with.
[1:47:35] He made man in his own image. Created
[1:47:37] him male and female. And then Genesis 2,
[1:47:40] he created man out of the dust of the
[1:47:43] earth.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Say, well, why are you speaking this as
[1:47:46] a resurrection?
[1:47:49] Well, resurrection actually means to
[1:47:52] resurrect something.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; And Adam had in, if you allow me the
[1:47:58] allowance,
[1:48:00] had in form, in type.
[1:48:03] There's no great spiritual doctrine, but
[1:48:06] God actually resurrected him.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Took something dead,
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; lifeless,
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; and made it come to life.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; But dust thou art,
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; and if you eat of this tree, dust shalt
[1:48:26] thou return to.
[1:48:33] Hold it. I'm not done.
[1:48:42] Created man in the dust of the earth.
[1:48:44] Then when he became flesh man, animal
[1:48:48] flesh of the earth, he's showing
[1:48:52] portraying here the bride.
[1:48:55] He never taken and made another being.
[1:48:58] He took part of Adam,
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; the original creation.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. took from him a rib from his
[1:49:06] side, took the feminist spirit
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; out of Adam, left the masculine spirit
[1:49:12] in there
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; and placed it in the feminist part and
[1:49:17] therefore part of his spirit,
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; part of his body,
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; flesh of his flesh,
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; and bone of his bone
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; and word of his word and life of his
[1:49:28] life.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; And that's the way the bride is to
[1:49:32] Christ.
[1:49:33] Amen.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bram says many times and
[1:49:37] women feel sometimes I think maybe uh
[1:49:41] some feel jilted about it. I'm not
[1:49:43] talking about believers. Says, "Well,
[1:49:44] woman wasn't in the original creation."
[1:49:46] No, but we are part of the original
[1:49:49] creation in Christ.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; But if you're not in him, you're not
[1:49:52] part of the original creation.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; But we're part of the original creation
[1:49:59] because we've been taken out of Christ.
[1:50:01] Amen.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; We've received part of his spirit.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; He's the masculine spirit. We have the
[1:50:07] feminine spirit.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; God has it all.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; He has all the attributes of motherhood.
[1:50:16] He has all the attributes of a woman.
[1:50:18] All the attributes of a man. He's God.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:50:26] And the Lord God said unto the serpent,
[1:50:29] now we're just taking a slight curve,
[1:50:31] but don't don't get lost now. And the
[1:50:33] Lord God said unto the serpent, "Because
[1:50:36] thou hast done this, not because thou
[1:50:38] has thought this, because thou hast done
[1:50:40] this, thou art cursed above all cattle,
[1:50:43] and above all above every beast of the
[1:50:46] field. Upon thy belly thou shalt go." He
[1:50:49] was not on his belly. He was upright.
[1:50:52] Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust
[1:50:54] shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.
[1:50:57] And I will put enmity between thee and
[1:51:00] the woman, and between thy seed and her
[1:51:03] seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou
[1:51:07] shalt bruise his heel." And he bruised
[1:51:09] him at Calvary.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ crushed his head at
[1:51:13] Calvary. Amen.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; And there was no woman that ever had
[1:51:18] seed aside from man other than the
[1:51:22] Virgin Mary.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; And that was the seed of the woman.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; That's the only woman that had seed.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Now, some of you say, "Well, we've heard
[1:51:31] that many times, but some of some others
[1:51:33] here perhaps have not heard it."
[1:51:35] Lucifer, now listen closely. Lucifer
[1:51:39] desired
[1:51:40] one the one thing that God had withheld
[1:51:44] from him and that was the power to
[1:51:47] create.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; I'm coming I'm on the subject of
[1:51:51] resurrection.
[1:51:54] In the seal of the antichrist he says
[1:51:56] the right-hand man of almighty God was
[1:51:59] Lucifer
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; the son of the morning. The Bible calls
[1:52:02] him the son of the morning.
[1:52:04] God granted him almost almost
[1:52:09] co-workers with him. He was a co-worker
[1:52:13] partly equal with him. Only Satan could
[1:52:18] not create.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; God is the only creator.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; But Satan took something that God
[1:52:25] created and perverted it back into
[1:52:28] something else, evil. And now notice
[1:52:31] when Cain and Abel, a very beautiful
[1:52:34] picture of it. Cain and Abel was nothing
[1:52:37] more than a prefigure of Judas and
[1:52:40] Jesus.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Is this okay?
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; As Isaiah, now the prophet is speaking,
[1:52:51] God is speaking through the prophet
[1:52:52] Isaiah. How art thou fallen from heaven,
[1:52:55] oh Lucifer? How are you fallen from
[1:52:58] heaven? He descended too.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Not the same way.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Oh Lucifer, son of the morning, how art
[1:53:10] thou cast down to the earth which did
[1:53:14] weaken the nations? For thou hast said
[1:53:17] in thy heart,
[1:53:23] didn't have time.
[1:53:26] Thou hast said in thy heart, notice
[1:53:28] please, I will ascend into heaven. I
[1:53:33] will exalt my throne above the stars of
[1:53:36] God. I will sit also upon the mount of
[1:53:40] the congregation in the sides of the
[1:53:43] north. And the sides of the north
[1:53:45] pertain to that procreative power.
[1:53:52] I will ascend above the heights of the
[1:53:54] clouds and I will be like the most high.
[1:54:00] That's what he said in his heart.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; That's what he would become.
[1:54:07] You know, our cemeteries are full of
[1:54:11] tombstones
[1:54:14] and people are dying by the multitude
[1:54:18] every day.
[1:54:21] why his death reigned so supreme on the
[1:54:24] earth. Because he said this,
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; and God
[1:54:31] God exposed his heart and his intent.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; And when we talk about resurrection,
[1:54:39] we're talking about God empowering us
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; to re to re to reverse this.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:50] Amen.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; I will ascend.
[1:54:54] I will go up.
[1:54:56] I will extend my boundaries.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he wanted to do. I
[1:55:00] will ascend. I'm going to extend my
[1:55:01] boundaries. The Almighty has said that I
[1:55:04] cannot create, but I'm going to extend
[1:55:06] my boundaries. I'm going to find a way.
[1:55:09] I'm going to pervert. I'm going to do
[1:55:11] something.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to excel. I'm going to be
[1:55:15] superior.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going to lift up myself.
[1:55:20] I'm going to rise. I've been cast to the
[1:55:22] earth. But now he's going to take a body
[1:55:25] of the earth,
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Eve, the only one with a womb. And he
[1:55:31] cannot create a seed, but he's going to
[1:55:34] take the only one in the garden that can
[1:55:37] actually mingle with her.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; And that's the closest he can come to
[1:55:45] being a creator.
[1:55:51] You're thinking deep
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; by perversion he came as close as it was
[1:55:59] possible to be a creator.
[1:56:02] And then from there all humanity and
[1:56:05] everybody in this building, everyone
[1:56:06] listening to me and everyone that's
[1:56:08] breathing breath
[1:56:10] has come through a perverted way. Amen.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; We've come through a sexual birth
[1:56:18] through the woman
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; and as a result we die.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; If you don't have a change in your body
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; and if you don't have eternal life,
[1:56:33] you're going to die in just an animal's
[1:56:35] death in that sense.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to the body. Yes, sir.
[1:56:44] I will exalt. I will ascend. I will
[1:56:47] exalt. I will sit and I will be like.
[1:56:52] You should take and read it.
[1:56:55] Satan was cast out of heaven. The
[1:56:57] scripture says in Revelation 12:7,
[1:57:00] can I go on a few more minutes?
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; And there was war in heaven. Michael and
[1:57:05] his angels fought against the dragon.
[1:57:08] And the dragon fought in his angels and
[1:57:11] prevailed not. I say praise God.
[1:57:14] Hallelujah. Neither was there found
[1:57:17] place found anymore in heaven. And the
[1:57:21] great dragon was cast out. That old
[1:57:23] serpent called the devil and Satan. I
[1:57:26] say hallelujah. Hallelujah. He was cast
[1:57:30] out of where I'm going.
[1:57:34] which deceiveth the whole world and was
[1:57:37] cast out into the earth and his angels
[1:57:39] were cast out with him.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Notice now the whole intent of Satan
[1:57:44] Lucifer expressed it in the words I
[1:57:47] will.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; And he gathered up and mingled with all
[1:57:52] of the subility and cunningness that he
[1:57:57] was possessed when he approached Steve.
[1:58:00] And this was his moment.
[1:58:04] This would be the closest, as I said
[1:58:06] earlier, that he would ever come to
[1:58:08] becoming a creator.
[1:58:10] And I need to read this for you.
[1:58:26] Can you listen closely? I wanted to have
[1:58:28] these in slides so you could read it,
[1:58:29] but just let give me a few moments. Here
[1:58:32] is where we receive, brother Benam, this
[1:58:34] is an Ephesian church age. Here is where
[1:58:36] we receive the true revelation of the
[1:58:39] serpent's seed.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Here is what Here's what really happened
[1:58:44] in the Garden of Eden. The word says,
[1:58:47] now let me just stop here for a moment
[1:58:49] to clear up some thoughts if you in case
[1:58:52] you have some thoughts. When you have as
[1:58:55] such as I have sitting like where
[1:58:56] brother Tom is and have this servant
[1:58:59] messenger, prophet messenger stand there
[1:59:02] and tell a person you were to a doctor
[1:59:05] yesterday or you were to a doctor last
[1:59:08] week. How does he know he was at a
[1:59:10] doctor last week or she was at a doctor
[1:59:13] and knows what the doctor said?
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; And in some cases read what was on the
[1:59:19] doctor's report
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; and that's in the past. If you can go
[1:59:24] back 24 hours, you can go back 24
[1:59:27] million years.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; There's no time with God.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; And this messenger could tell just
[1:59:34] exactly tell her what's on that report
[1:59:36] and that the doctors couldn't find it
[1:59:38] and exactly what it is. Here he's
[1:59:40] spelling it out and telling her where
[1:59:42] she come from.
[1:59:44] That's the wisdom of God
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; that he sent in this generation so that
[1:59:48] you'd have confidence that that kind of
[1:59:51] wisdom can tell where Satan came, how he
[1:59:54] got into the humanity, and tell you and
[1:59:57] I where we're going.
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; You need to have confidence in that.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; I declare in the name of the Lord,
[2:00:07] you've never heard a voice like that
[2:00:09] voice.
[2:00:10] and it and God will never send it again.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about these kind of
[2:00:16] prophecies. Yay, the Lord said this and
[2:00:18] the Lord said. I'm not making fun of
[2:00:19] that. They can have that. But this is
[2:00:22] absolutely prophetic
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; by a born messenger.
[2:00:27] [Applause]
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; And he says the word says that Eve was
[2:00:33] beguiled by the serpent. She was
[2:00:37] actually seduced by the serpent. Now the
[2:00:40] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[2:00:41] of the field which the Lord God had
[2:00:43] made. He said this beast was so close to
[2:00:45] the human human being and yet was pure
[2:00:48] animal.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; That he could reason and talk and God
[2:00:53] talked with him and he talked with
[2:00:54] Almighty God.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; He was an upright creature and was
[2:01:00] somewhat in between a chimpanzeee and a
[2:01:02] man, but closer to a man. He was so
[2:01:05] close to being human that his seed could
[2:01:08] and did mingle with that of the woman.
[2:01:11] When I spoke and you heard Rabbi
[2:01:13] Richmond here, I had him in the car and
[2:01:16] I came to the serpent seed. He said,
[2:01:18] "There are those amongst us of the
[2:01:21] Jewish people, Orthodox,
[2:01:24] strict Orthodox that do believe that it
[2:01:27] was a sexual act in the beginning." I
[2:01:30] said, "And what about Abel? We believe
[2:01:32] that Abel was his son." No. He said, 'We
[2:01:35] don't believe that. They hadn't gone
[2:01:37] there yet. And I said, Abel
[2:01:41] lied in the face of God. Adam was God's
[2:01:45] son, and now you have Abel as Adam's
[2:01:50] son. Where does this nature come from?
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Lies in the face of God.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Cain lies in the face of God
[2:02:05] and has murder already in his heart
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; and kills
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; a son of God.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Did that come from God?
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; And I could see the wheels just grinding
[2:02:17] and he hung his head and he just was
[2:02:18] thinking went into deep thought.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; I hope he got deep enough
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; that he could reason and talk. He was an
[2:02:31] upright creature somewhat between a
[2:02:32] chimpanzeee and a man but closer to a
[2:02:34] man. He was so close to human being that
[2:02:36] his seed could and did mingle with that
[2:02:38] of the woman and cause her to conceive.
[2:02:41] And when this happened, God cursed the
[2:02:42] serpent. He changed every bone in the
[2:02:45] serpent's body so that he had to crawl
[2:02:48] like a snake. Science can try all it
[2:02:50] wants to and it won't find the missing
[2:02:53] link. God saw to that. And man is smart
[2:02:57] and he can see an association of man
[2:03:00] with the animal and he tries to prove it
[2:03:03] out in evolution and there isn't any
[2:03:06] evolution
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; man but man and animal did mingle and
[2:03:11] that's one of the mysteries of God that
[2:03:13] has remained hidden but here it is
[2:03:17] revealed
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; it happened back there in the midst of
[2:03:21] Eden when Eve turned away from from life
[2:03:24] to accept death
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; and thus we all die.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; But those that have received the life of
[2:03:32] Jesus Christ,
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; we don't just have a promise. It's
[2:03:35] already been declared.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; We shall rise
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; in the resurrection morning.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; And this might be the morning.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Shall we all rise?
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Shall we all be changed in the We'll be
[2:03:48] changed in instant. But the prophet says
[2:03:51] the sweep will go over us. Amen.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether that sweep will
[2:03:56] happen to you and me at the same
[2:03:58] instant. We believe that it has and it
[2:04:01] will. I don't know. I do not know.
[2:04:06] Those are still questions. But it will
[2:04:08] happen.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Why will it happen? Cuz it's been
[2:04:10] spoken.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not being too long with you.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; And he said,
[2:04:18] notice what God said to them in the
[2:04:20] garden. I'll put enmity, and he quotes
[2:04:22] that. I'll put enmity between thee and
[2:04:24] the woman and between thy seed. And
[2:04:26] don't forget, if you have any question
[2:04:29] in your mind, don't ever forget Genesis
[2:04:32] 3:15. I'll put enmity between thee and
[2:04:35] the woman and between Satan, God talking
[2:04:39] to the serpent, and between your seed.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; And just stop there and ask anybody, who
[2:04:47] is that?
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Who is that? Who was the seed?
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Who was the seed that was going to
[2:04:54] bruise the heel
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; of the woman's seed? And the woman's
[2:04:57] seed, they all the church world regards
[2:05:00] that as being Jesus Christ. Yes, sir.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; They have to.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; I like when one minister was here and
[2:05:05] someone had a had a had a problem with
[2:05:07] it and he said, "Well, who who the who
[2:05:11] who's the seed of the woman?" Said,
[2:05:12] "Christ." He just said, "Who bruised
[2:05:15] him?
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Some spirit?" No, it's a man.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Man bruised him.
[2:05:27] [Music]
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; A portion of the scripture, this portion
[2:05:36] of the scripture is the revelation of
[2:05:38] how the literal seed of the serpent was
[2:05:40] sown in the earth. Even as we have the
[2:05:42] account of Luke 1:26-35,
[2:05:45] wherein is it set forth the exact
[2:05:47] account of how the seed of the woman
[2:05:49] came into physical manifestation apart
[2:05:53] from the instrumentality of the human
[2:05:55] male?
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Why do you think God had Abraham said,
[2:05:59] "Circumcise thyself?" Because he and and
[2:06:02] and he said, "And that foreskin shall be
[2:06:05] a token unto me." Because God was
[2:06:08] marking that part of the male body
[2:06:11] that it shall not have any part of
[2:06:15] redemption.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Then Mary said unto the angel, "How
[2:06:25] shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"
[2:06:27] And the angel answered and said unto
[2:06:29] her, "The unto her, the Holy Ghost shall
[2:06:31] come upon thee, and the power of the
[2:06:32] highest shall overshadow thee."
[2:06:34] Therefore, that holy thing which shall
[2:06:37] be born of thee shall be called the son
[2:06:40] of God.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; As the seed of the woman was literal,
[2:06:44] literally God reproducing himself in
[2:06:48] human flesh.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; This is absolute must because he had to
[2:06:53] descend.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, who descended?
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; The virgin birth proved that he
[2:07:02] descended. God came down and was formed
[2:07:06] in the fashion of man.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; And you're saying, "Why are you spending
[2:07:09] so much time on this, brother Biscll?"
[2:07:11] Well, because that is the whole purpose
[2:07:14] of the resurrection.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; It makes the glory of it when you see
[2:07:19] how far he descended. That's where we
[2:07:21] ended up.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; We're at the end of the road.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; We all die
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; like a bunch of animals as it were, but
[2:07:29] inside
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is the seed of almighty God.
[2:07:35] [Applause]
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; The seed of the woman literally God
[2:07:42] reproducing himself in human flesh. So
[2:07:44] the seed of the serpent is the literal
[2:07:46] way that Satan found. He was able to
[2:07:48] open the door to himself into the human
[2:07:51] race. It was impossible for Satan for he
[2:07:54] is only a created spirit being. He's
[2:07:58] only a created spirit being. He didn't
[2:08:00] have a physical body.
[2:08:03] Young people,
[2:08:04] every person. That's why he wants your
[2:08:07] body.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; He cannot express himself outside of a
[2:08:11] body.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; If you go into an insane institution,
[2:08:15] which I have, and you see the people,
[2:08:17] you can actually see it. They disfigure
[2:08:20] their their being.
[2:08:23] Right?
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; I've seen them with long nails
[2:08:26] and creatures
[2:08:28] and they have their face has become
[2:08:30] contorted.
[2:08:31] It's that spirit that's in them that's
[2:08:34] expressing itself.
[2:08:35] [Applause]
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; And you see someone, don't give yourself
[2:08:44] in to some uh glum and gloom. I've seen
[2:08:50] people who are professors and they're
[2:08:52] wonderful believers, but they give
[2:08:54] themselves in to doom
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; and negativity
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; and doubt
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; and criticism
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; and we can get and if you give yourself
[2:09:04] into that then you you're actually
[2:09:08] giving a place
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; to the enemy.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; I say resist him.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Cast him out. Yes.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; You have no part with me.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Do you can we do that?"
[2:09:22] Absolutely. Not only can, you must.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; And he says he's only a spirit being to
[2:09:37] reproduce himself
[2:09:39] uh to reproduce himself in the manner in
[2:09:42] which God reproduced himself. So the so
[2:09:44] the Genesis account tells how he
[2:09:47] produced his seed and introduced or
[2:09:50] injected himself into the human race.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Satan using the serpent creature to
[2:09:59] inject himself into the human race.
[2:10:04] This is the closest he could get to have
[2:10:07] something in his image.
[2:10:11] trying to ascend up to where God said,
[2:10:14] "Let us make man in our image." This is
[2:10:17] as close as he could get.
[2:10:20] And our Lord Jesus,
[2:10:23] he didn't just come and visit Palestine,
[2:10:26] but he descended into this age when hell
[2:10:31] came up
[2:10:33] to the streets of Vancouver,
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; to the streets of Seattle and
[2:10:37] Bellingham.
[2:10:39] Hell
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; and the great nations of the world. Hell
[2:10:44] has invaded
[2:10:46] the governments
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; and the educational system
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; and the entertainment world
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; and has polluted
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; even good inventions has polluted them
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; and contaminated them
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; and has used the internet
[2:11:03] has used it. You hear preachers preach
[2:11:05] against it but Satan has invaded it.
[2:11:08] every part of it
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; and caused everything to taste hell.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; And if it were not for the grace of God,
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; we would be lost.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; But we're not only found, we're
[2:11:21] redeemed.
[2:11:22] [Applause]
[2:11:24] [Music]
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Give me just a few more moments, will
[2:11:28] you please?
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; I won't often. I won't come back to
[2:11:30] this.
[2:11:34] And he came and and and Satan today has
[2:11:38] become a master of the body, gets old
[2:11:42] and goes towards death,
[2:11:45] gets a hold of the emotional realm and
[2:11:47] captures it and captivates it and moves
[2:11:50] it around.
[2:11:52] But the soul, the seed,
[2:11:56] the seed gene that brother Bram talked
[2:11:57] about of God is out of his reach.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I want to rejoice over
[2:12:04] that this morning. It's out of his
[2:12:06] reach.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Satan, you might make me sick and
[2:12:09] afflicted, but I'm out of your reach.
[2:12:11] The real me, I'm out of your reach.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; You might depress me.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; You might cast me down. I might get so
[2:12:21] low,
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; but you but my soul is out of your
[2:12:25] reach.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:29] [Applause]
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:35] I've got to dismiss some of this because
[2:12:37] I want to
[2:12:47] Well, I'm going to just close with what
[2:12:48] I'm going to do.
[2:13:00] Now there's one thing we don't want to
[2:13:02] get confused about.
[2:13:05] The Bible says all that are in the grave
[2:13:07] shall hear his voice.
[2:13:11] And brother Bram says clearly that is
[2:13:13] not the resurrection of the saints
[2:13:16] because then the scripture says that
[2:13:18] they did not let raise for a thousand
[2:13:20] years. Says that all that are in the
[2:13:22] grave shall hear the voice and some to
[2:13:25] righteousness and some to judgment.
[2:13:28] That's the great white throne judgment
[2:13:29] that's spoken of in Revelation. But the
[2:13:32] Bible tells us also where Apostle Paul
[2:13:35] speaks, "And the Lord himself shall
[2:13:38] descend from heaven with a shout, and
[2:13:40] the dead in Christ
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; shall rise." Only those in Christ.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; They have they've been believers of the
[2:13:48] word that God has sent them. And they
[2:13:51] and they alone shall rise. Hallelujah.
[2:13:54] [Music]
[2:13:56] And uh and he says also that that the
[2:14:01] the third which was the trumpet which
[2:14:03] always is the feast of trumpets calling
[2:14:05] the people to the feast and that'll be
[2:14:08] the bride's supper, the lamb's supper
[2:14:10] with the bride. He says they're caught
[2:14:12] up and he says we're right there now.
[2:14:14] We're ready now. The only thing the
[2:14:17] church coming out has to go to lay
[2:14:22] before the sun to ripen. And that's what
[2:14:25] we're here today to do. Say, "Oh son,
[2:14:29] shine upon me."
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Make real,
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; make reality,
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; these words to me. Amen.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; I I trust that this has given you
[2:14:41] something further to think about
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; in the in the resurrection, the voice of
[2:14:46] the resurrection. And my whole point
[2:14:49] today was to let you know the voice.
[2:14:53] God's already spoke it.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; It's already been spoken.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; And now he has just come and given the
[2:15:01] the timing and the season.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to detail and say
[2:15:04] everything. He's saying the time is
[2:15:07] here.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; We have arrived.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; And how is it going to take place? Well,
[2:15:21] it's going to be so common.
[2:15:25] The women, are you listening? Amen.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; The women that came to the tomb that had
[2:15:32] the spices,
[2:15:35] they didn't use the spices.
[2:15:39] It was just so common.
[2:15:42] Brother Brham,
[2:15:45] he intended to preach Bruce Serpent
[2:15:49] and he had his notes and was on his way
[2:15:51] back to preach Bruce Serpent
[2:15:54] and he didn't do it.
[2:15:58] They have been laughed.
[2:16:00] There will be things that you and I will
[2:16:03] be fully intent on doing and we just
[2:16:06] won't get it done.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Because something else will overtake us.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; And I had for you and it might do good.
[2:16:16] I I I won't take the time this morning
[2:16:19] because my time is well gone. I've been
[2:16:22] an hour and a quarter, hour and a half
[2:16:23] almost.
[2:16:25] Uh
[2:16:28] but I had uh I had put down
[2:16:32] brother Brandham going beyond the
[2:16:34] curtain of time. And now I'll just try
[2:16:35] to
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; take it from my memory.
[2:16:42] Now now he he's just woke up.
[2:16:46] This is very
[2:16:50] this probably the best description I can
[2:16:52] give you the resurrection.
[2:16:55] He's just woke up
[2:16:57] and he said he put his hand behind his
[2:16:59] head like so.
[2:17:03] He has to get the children to school. So
[2:17:06] he was getting ready to go up to take
[2:17:07] him to school.
[2:17:09] Put his hands behind his head and said,
[2:17:12] "Well, Bill Brham, you got to think
[2:17:14] about his life. If you're going to do
[2:17:16] anything for God, you better you're
[2:17:19] you're 50." He says one place he told me
[2:17:21] 52. I think it was 53. 52 53. He said
[2:17:25] you better get going.
[2:17:29] He said just at that moment
[2:17:31] and he told me very clearly there's no
[2:17:33] sensation,
[2:17:35] no feeling, no movement, no nothing. He
[2:17:39] just found himself and he's standing
[2:17:41] there looking back. He said just a few
[2:17:43] feet
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; one time. He said not over 20 feet. It
[2:17:48] had to be was in his bedroom and he's
[2:17:51] looking at himself right there. He'd
[2:17:54] called his wife and said, "Sweetheart,"
[2:17:55] and she didn't stir. She was still
[2:17:58] sleeping. Now he's standing here looking
[2:18:01] at himself.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; He thought, "This is strange."
[2:18:06] He went like this to me. He says, "I
[2:18:08] pinched my hand.
[2:18:11] I bit my finger.
[2:18:14] I felt for I felt my head because he was
[2:18:16] baldheaded
[2:18:18] because he had lost his hair through in
[2:18:21] a barberh shop through an accident
[2:18:25] and he felt his hair and he said I had a
[2:18:27] full head of hair.
[2:18:29] He said and then he says he saw the
[2:18:32] women coming.
[2:18:35] He describes their very different
[2:18:37] colored hair
[2:18:39] but all dressed the same and barefooted.
[2:18:43] All I'm telling you is what he said.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; And they come running and he says and
[2:18:48] they began to hug me and then another
[2:18:51] one would come and hug me and they would
[2:18:52] say our brother, our precious brother.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; He said they were real.
[2:18:58] And he asked the people to please be
[2:19:02] please be understanding and please be
[2:19:05] mature.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; And he talks about the human cell of a
[2:19:10] human body. And he said you cannot
[2:19:13] embrace a woman or be embraced by a
[2:19:15] woman without it causing some sensation.
[2:19:19] But he said there was none.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; He said we don't have those cells in
[2:19:24] that body. Amen.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; But he said I was in a body.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, dear friends. We're all
[2:19:34] different ages or different sizes,
[2:19:36] different background.
[2:19:38] You have that body
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; just beyond your view and beyond your
[2:19:44] vision.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; That body,
[2:19:49] he stepped into it. He was instantly in
[2:19:53] it.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said if it was a vision, he
[2:19:56] said, 'I've never had a vision like
[2:19:58] that. He said in one place he calls it a
[2:20:00] translation.
[2:20:05] We are
[2:20:07] We've already been written down in the
[2:20:10] translation list.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; We shall be changed.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; You shall be translated.
[2:20:21] And then and then the men came and they
[2:20:25] began to embrace him. And one woman came
[2:20:29] and embraced him. Said, "You did you
[2:20:32] recognize her? She was over 90 years old
[2:20:35] when you led her to Christ."
[2:20:38] And then he said, "Who are these
[2:20:40] people?"
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Said, "These are your these are your
[2:20:44] people. You have been gathered
[2:20:47] to your people." And I told all of this
[2:20:50] and I preached this whole service today
[2:20:52] so I could come to this point.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; You and I are not just going to die
[2:20:59] or even when we are changed in the
[2:21:01] rapture. You're going to be gathered to
[2:21:04] your people.
[2:21:07] [Music]
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; That's your real family.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; Some of you here maybe without family.
[2:21:16] You've got a real family. Amen.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you, they're going to
[2:21:20] hug you.
[2:21:21] [Music]
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; They're going to tell you, "We've been
[2:21:26] waiting for you.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; We've been waiting for this moment."
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; These are your people. He said, "Are
[2:21:37] these Brhams?" No, these are your
[2:21:41] converts to Christ.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm a convert.
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; I'm a convert to this Christ, this word.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends,
[2:22:12] only makes us treasure this more and
[2:22:14] more.
[2:22:17] We see the way people go and what they
[2:22:19] say and about this messenger
[2:22:26] I read some woman said just recently she
[2:22:29] said in a book that brother Brham
[2:22:34] he liked to be so well thought of
[2:22:37] he didn't want anybody to think evil or
[2:22:39] wrong of him.
[2:22:42] I said, ' Then why'd he preach a servant
[2:22:43] seed?
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't that foolish?
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Why'd he preach about women's hair?
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; If you want to be well thought of, why
[2:22:52] do he preach against all homosexuality
[2:22:55] and why do he preach against all this
[2:22:56] stuff? You can't find it. In fact, as
[2:22:58] they turn right around say, his message
[2:23:00] is too hard.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; Doesn't even make any sense.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he preached it down the line.
[2:23:07] Aren't you?
[2:23:10] Hallelujah.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. You can rejoice over it.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he preached it straight down
[2:23:17] the line.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Anything less would have been too
[2:23:21] little.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; You shall know the truth
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; and the truth shall
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; set you free.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; You are free.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm on the war path, friends.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; I'm on the war path.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; This Satan, he's a liar.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; He has no part of you.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; Our soul is even out of his reach.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; This isn't just to make you feel good.
[2:23:52] This is the truth of God's word.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your kind attention.
[2:24:04] Dear heavenly father,
[2:24:06] it is with hearts that are filled and
[2:24:09] overflowing
[2:24:11] with such thanksgiving to you. We
[2:24:14] scarcely can express ourselves and we're
[2:24:18] wondering what you have yet in store for
[2:24:20] us. Lord, we feel as though we're living
[2:24:22] right on the very brink of the eternal
[2:24:26] shores. Amen.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray that you'll take this
[2:24:30] blessed, precious assembly and those, oh
[2:24:33] Father, that will stream or are
[2:24:36] streaming, I ask that you'll reach out
[2:24:39] with a special blessing at this time.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; And I pray, oh God, that Satan will be
[2:24:45] defeated on every front.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; We're so thankful for what you have done
[2:24:49] and are doing for our brother West
[2:24:51] Nygard. And I pray, oh God, that that
[2:24:54] 100% mark
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; will be his portion
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; even now, oh God.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; And if there's any sick and afflicted
[2:25:04] amongst us, lift the affliction from
[2:25:06] them.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; The same one that was here in our
[2:25:09] prophet's ministry, you have said, oh
[2:25:11] God, that you would honor the prayer of
[2:25:14] a believer. If you shall believe and you
[2:25:16] shall ask, it shall be done.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[2:25:22] pray that you will bless now and honor
[2:25:24] this prayer as I humbly pray it as your
[2:25:27] servant in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to sing
[2:25:35] uh
[2:25:37] well actually what am I going to do? I
[2:25:38] want to sing two songs.
[2:25:41] Let's sing in the resurrection morning.
[2:25:46] And just while we get ready to sing it.
[2:25:57] [Music]
[2:25:59] Hallelujah.
[2:26:01] [Music]
[2:26:07] Well,
[2:26:10] [Music]
[2:26:18] you don't mind if I take a moment, do
[2:26:19] you?
[2:26:21] [Music]
[2:26:26] [Music]
[2:26:32] It's worth waiting for.
[2:26:35] I want to leave this with you. I would
[2:26:37] just so blessed. Resurrection. Voice of
[2:26:40] the resurrection.
[2:26:44] I get lost in my thoughts. I go far
[2:26:46] beyond my ability. And I'd like to drop
[2:26:49] some things in that let you share with
[2:26:52] that with me. Hallelujah.
[2:26:54] [Music]
[2:26:58] in the fundamental foundation for faith.
[2:27:00] And you might want to remember that
[2:27:04] some of these things that brother
[2:27:06] Brandham said even in a very early
[2:27:09] ministry, I'm just astounded that
[2:27:13] we weren't catching it back then. He
[2:27:15] said, "Man was made as a secondary God
[2:27:18] on earth.
[2:27:21] He was given the power to control all
[2:27:24] things
[2:27:26] all elements of the earth of the earth.
[2:27:31] That was Adam. Adam was given these
[2:27:35] great powers.
[2:27:37] But then the power that he was given to
[2:27:41] make himself
[2:27:45] is where he fell.
[2:27:49] The power that he was given to make or
[2:27:52] reproduce himself
[2:27:55] is where he fell.
[2:27:58] That's the fall.
[2:28:02] Now in the beginning of man, that's what
[2:28:05] God gave him power over everything on
[2:28:09] the earth. And now though the through
[2:28:12] the fall he lost that power. Then he
[2:28:16] becomes unconscious to the fact after
[2:28:19] losing his relationship and friendship
[2:28:22] and fellowship with the father then he
[2:28:24] lost that and all of his great channels
[2:28:28] listen close
[2:28:30] become clogged up and he couldn't get
[2:28:33] through. Now
[2:28:36] what Adam was in God,
[2:28:39] what Adam was in God, Christ has
[2:28:44] redeemed us back to that. Now a redeemer
[2:28:49] to redeem anything is to bring it back
[2:28:52] to its origin again.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; All what he couldn't do is reproduce
[2:28:59] himself or bring himself back. He
[2:29:02] couldn't make another son like he was in
[2:29:06] the original state. And this is why
[2:29:10] Jesus said, listen very close. No man
[2:29:14] takes my life from me.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; I, the original,
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; I lay it down.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; I take it up again.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; Because he knew who he was. And all that
[2:29:26] you lost in Adam, the fall, you have
[2:29:30] gained back in Christ the word.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; You have it.
[2:29:36] [Applause]
[2:29:36] [Music]
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; You can say without a shadow of a doubt,
[2:29:44] I shall rise
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; because that which is in me will not
[2:29:48] leave me to corruption.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; I shall rise.
[2:29:54] Hallelujah.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; I want to read that before we sing this
[2:29:58] song. Let's stand.
[2:30:01] In the resurrection morning,
[2:30:04] [Music]
[2:30:08] when the trump of God shall sound, we
[2:30:11] shall rise.
[2:30:14] We shall rise.
[2:30:22] We shall rise. Hallelujah. We shall
[2:30:26] rise.
[2:30:28] We shall rise.
[2:30:39] [Music]
[2:30:40] His doors are broken. We shall rise.
[2:30:44] Hallelujah. We shall rise
[2:30:48] in the resurrection morning. What a
[2:30:51] feeding that will be. We shall rise.
[2:30:56] We shall rise.
[2:30:59] When our fathers and our mothers and our
[2:31:02] loved ones, we shall see. We shall rise.
[2:31:07] We shall rise.
[2:31:18] in the resurrection
[2:31:31] morning. We shall be in the air. We
[2:31:35] shall rise.
[2:31:38] We shall rise.
[2:31:40] and car.
[2:31:58] Hallelujah.
[2:32:05] [Music]
[2:32:07] Hallelujah.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Can we say hallelujah?
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; Blessed father,
[2:32:18] almighty one,
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; revealed through Jesus Christ, made
[2:32:24] known to us in this generation.
[2:32:27] I pray that you will bless, oh God, your
[2:32:30] people, not merely with a blessing, but
[2:32:32] may the truth and the revelation of your
[2:32:34] word be like a inner explosion within
[2:32:37] them. And may faith flow from one to the
[2:32:40] other. And even as we shake hands with
[2:32:42] one another today, oh God, may there be
[2:32:45] something so vibrant within each person.
[2:32:48] Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, I
[2:32:52] resist every enemy. Satan, you who came
[2:32:55] to pervert creation, we announce to you
[2:32:58] that your time is over. You do not have
[2:33:01] any hold of us. You cannot get a hold of
[2:33:03] our souls. You cannot destroy
[2:33:06] permanently this this life that we have
[2:33:09] that we have in Jesus Christ. We thank
[2:33:11] you, oh God, for such glorious victory.
[2:33:15] Let the people now be dismissed and go
[2:33:17] with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[2:33:20] And I pray that you'll bless every man
[2:33:22] and woman and child for your glory. We
[2:33:25] thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. All I can say is you're dismissed
[2:33:30] in Jesus' name. And for sure, if we
[2:33:34] don't meet here at 5:00, we're going to
[2:33:36] meet just
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; the other side of the veil.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; You don't even know what I really look
[2:33:46] like till you get over there. All of you
[2:33:49] that are around 20 or thereabouts, you
[2:33:52] young fellas, we we we pretty well know
[2:33:54] what you're going to look like. You
[2:33:55] don't know what we're going to look
[2:33:56] like. All us older people. Isn't that
[2:33:59] wonderful?
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; They won't even know. Hallelujah.
[2:34:03] Somebody just saw a picture on the I
[2:34:05] think a old video that we had and I was
[2:34:07] giving a testimony. They said, "You have
[2:34:10] black hair." I said, "Well, I hope so. I
[2:34:13] hope I wasn't white when I was a kid."
[2:34:17] God bless you.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; You're dismissed in Jesus name. Brother
[2:34:21] Tom is speaking this evening. Brother
[2:34:23] Murphy's down in Seattle. God bless you
[2:34:25] all in Jesus name. You're dismissed.
[2:34:29] Hallelujah. How about you, brother?
