Glory to your name, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to your name, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. I'm going to ask our brother John Andy's, Brother John, if you'd come. There's some requests here that we desire to be taken before the throne of grace. Sister Sigret is requesting prayer for her sister Margot um who's been just diagnosed with cancer. Praying for her salvation, complete healing. And we give the Lord thanks and praise for his love and mercy. And truly we do. Just asking to continue to pray for my dad who's not doing well physically, but you know, he just says, "I'm ready to go home. I'm done with this place. I want to go see the Lord." So, uh we just are thankful for his life and just pray that he doesn't uh suffer too much and and uh we're just thankful for what God did for him. Um there's a request for um a testimony from our sister Bobby Graham. One year ago, I broke my arm in three places. One of the breaks went up into the joint. Because of this, the doctor said I might not get the use of my arm back. Started to heal. Then the specialist said I would only get 75% use back. I said I was going for 100%. He smiled kindly at me and said that's a good thing to go for. I am now at 98%. With God all things are possible. Just wants to thank the Lord. Amen. Praise God. Uh brother uh Wim Congo uh has been diagnosed as having a large kidney stone. the doctors uh have to make a decision to do surgery or ultrasound on Monday and uh just want us to pray that God would dissolve it and have his perfect way. Amen. And also uh brother uh Ladic uh Kris I'm probably saying this wrong. It's the Polish translator resting prayer for his wife who has broken her leg and also for troubles that he's facing on his farm. trials are great battles of my faith and my obligations at home into the work of the Lord to translate brother Brandham's messages. So I want to pray for our brother. Amen. That God would just undertake for him. And how many have a need this morning? Amen. If you're listening in on the internet and you have a need that you desire to be taken before the throne of grace, you just lift it to our Lord as we go to prayer. And John, if you come, let's all join our hearts together in our faith. Father, we've come into this sacred atmosphere this morning. All of us as believers speaking from our hearts would know that something has changed. In the last few weeks, in the last few months, a change is happening to us. We've come into this sacred moment of the congregation. We are throwing back every unbelief, every doubt, every fear. All of the past is behind us. All of the failures, all of the mistakes, all of what we were is behind us. All of what we thought, all of our own thoughts, our physical birth is behind us. Our old life, our sin, our unbelief. Even up until right now, this prayer, all of our hearts agreeing together. It is the past. We are looking to you right now. You're the author. You're the beginner of our faith. It is because of you that we stand. It is because of you that we live. You are our breath. You are our faith. You are the syllables. You are our eyes and our ears. You are our heart. And we love you for that, Jesus. Right now, our faith is being lifted up to you. Not just a dying lamb, but a living lamb walking among us, Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever, standing at attention in your bride. Our hearts that are quivering, Lord. lives that are standing in need of the next step, Father, that we do not know might be in a new body. Jesus, the very brush across our cheeks, could be our theophanes. The very air that's rustling near us could be bodies in another dimension blending into this place, Lord. And we believe that you've allowed crystals that's come across our pathways, Lord, that's brought the vision of that other realm so much closer, so much nearer. Father, they're in this building right now. Colors and rooms and and pictures and voices. Your will, your desire. Healing is in this room right now. Deliverance is in this room right now. Our theophanes are calling to us from another dimension. And we hear their voices. We hear their desires. We hear their call. And we are surrendering to it right now. We're throwing up our hands, Jesus. We're throwing up our hearts. We're saying, "Thy will be done in this dimension as it is in that other dimension." Let it blend this morning, Father. All of our hearts are saying, "Come, Lord Jesus. Come rescue us and deliver us, Father, from these pest house of sin and vile corruption. Lord, we desire that change more than any other thing that we could breathe out in a prayer more than any other desire. We want to see births. We want to see missing limbs. Lord, we we have qu requests before us. Lives that need a touch from you. Unspoken requests. Father, I'm even remembering Sister Deborah Lowry that needs a touch in her spinal cord. Father, there's needs out among us. Lord, names, Lord, they just are a blur. We need a change. We need a healing. Lost loved ones, there must be a season when they come back to you. There must be a time, that time is no more, and it blends into an eternal manifestation. All that we was, we are right now. Lord Jesus, we confess that as your bride, as your people, let the sperm come to the egg. Let there be a life. Lord, the sweetness that's around us, the accumulation of all of our expectation, our desires, I believe, is present here this morning. And we desire that rapture cycle to be culminated even as we speak. Lord, what if it would be a service like this, a moment like this, that our thoughts could be so blended that sisters and brothers would begin to speak. Lord, their desires would begin to not be just a groan, but it would become a living life. Missing limbs be created, lives would be changed, hearts would be filled with the Holy Spirit. Even yet while we hear the word, Father, the new birth, Lord, is just a a thought expressed from you and an individual receiving that. Father, we surrender this morning. We yield, Father, every heart in this building, out across the internet, into the phone hookups. We welcome your appearing, Jesus. We welcome your appearing, Father. We throw out the w red carpet. We yield our members, Jesus. Let the supernatural be breaking out upon us, Father. Let our minds be exploding. Let the thoughts of Christ just change us from glory to glory as we move under this great order of the shout and the voice and the trumpet. Father, we're in the season of the change. We hear the call of our new bodies. Oh, Father, we hear that theophony calling to us. Come a little higher. Come a little higher. Don't you want to be changed? And we are saying yes, Lord Jesus. Touch these lives, Father. Even our Polish translator and his wife needs a touch from you, Father. Pray that you would go across the miles. Go into that little room. Go into that little farm and make the difference. Our sister Cigret's family, Lord, and sister with this cancer, nothing is too small for you. Our brother Rod's father, his life has come this far and he wants to step across, Lord. And we're asking for the pain to be minimal, for his life on earth, not to be taken a moment before you desire, but not a a moment later. Jesus, I believe we'd all ask one another, what would be your greatest desire? it would be to step across the pale and other requests. We thank you for the miracle you did in Sister Bobby. Father, we could have a testimony service right now. Even this past week and past few weeks, what you're doing in our families, what you're doing among us, it is truly great things, Lord. And as we pale into that other dimension closer and closer, it should be happening, Father. even in the next hour or two, great things are going to happen here. I pray that you'd be so near to us that that time would pass away. That our energy, Lord, and our focus would be so divine and heavenly that none of us would miss your appearing, Jesus. Father, we're praying one for the other as we come into this communion time that not one would miss it. Don't let one life be distracted. Don't let one person miss the thing that you would have for us today. Bring our attention, Father, in line with thus sayeth the Lord. We love you this morning, Jesus. We appreciate the miracles what you're doing among us. We just give you the next few moments of our time, of our life here. Our reward is your presence. Our desires is your nearness. So would you come by this place, Lord, and minister to us this morning as we minister back to our husband and give you everything that we are. Let the service be a love token of our praise. Let there be a reservoir unleashed in every heart of thanksgiving and adoration, true worship from our hearts in Jesus name. Amen. May you may be seated. [Music] [Music] Our sister Elizabeth Neighbor group have a song for us this morning. Why don't they come at this time? Uh we've got a couple of announcements just to make while they're getting ready. Um, and we want to welcome all those who are visiting with us. We're happy to have each and every one of you here and uh happy to have the Snow family up here with us visiting and they're going to be uh uh moving up here pretty soon.

So I surrender to the fire that brings me chain. holding loose all that I possess in this season I find rest [Music] on the s of time we will stack our weapons on the banks of heaven shore. But for now we must polish our soul again advancing onward. Even as the sun goes down, embrace the heat of battle, taking back our ground. Till the captain says you've conquered, trade your armor for a crown. I've got to be conditioned to go home. So I surrender to the fire that brings me chain. Oh, you lose. All that I possess in this season I find rest. [Music] I will take your hand across the table there. We'll cry tears of joy for the harvest our laborers reap. And the pain and heartache we carried on the earth alone. They seem afraid now as we kneel before the throne. They served a purpose to ready me for home. I rejoice in the testing for I will overcome. I've got to be commissioned to go home. So I surrender to the fire that brings me chase. [Music] Holy loose all that I possess in this season. I find my rest. I've got to be in condition to go home.

Without you one moment, I don't know where I'd be. Your love is light to me. Oh Lord, your love is life to me. My truest longing, my deepest need. Without you one moment, I don't know where I'd be.

That's the mansion he's built for you and me. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. [Music] If our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have another one waiting eternal in the heavens. He said, "I go to prepare a place for you that where I am, there you may be." also from the earthly to the heavenly from this body to our theophony. [Music] Oh, from this old pest house to our father's house. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. [Music] In this body we grown, designed to be clothed upon your body celestial in the heavens. So when this corruption shall have put on incorruption, then mortality shall be swallowed up. Oh, from the earthly into the heavenly, from this body to our theophony. Oh, from this old test house to our father's house. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. That's a mansion he's built for you and me. [Music] Soon we'll lay aside this old ragged robe of flesh in exchange for a glorious one prepared in the heavens. And at the resurrection, at the sounding of the trump, my body will be glorified. Just like Jesus, oh from the earth, oh my God, into the heavenly from this body to my theophony. Oh, from the soul pastels to all fathers. Hallelujah. Oh, that's the mansion he's built for you and me. That's the mansion he's built for you and me.

That's a mansion he's built for you and me. Oh, from the earth, &gt;&gt; from this whole body, &gt;&gt; to the heaven &gt;&gt; and to the heavenly &gt;&gt; from this. &gt;&gt; Oh, no more sickness, no more pain. Oh, we'll be just like him from the soul past to our father's house. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. That's the mansion he's built for you and me. [Music] Let's stand together as brother Biscll comes and sing. Come by here my Lord. Come by here. Man, he is here. Amen. And we desire.

Come by here. Do what you'd like to do. May you be pleased with what takes place today. What is said and the response of our hearts. Amen. I'm going to go directly to the word. Greeting you all in the name of Jesus Christ and all that are streaming. We say God bless you in your rooms and homes and different places of gathering. We're so happy to have each one present and each one that is with us that look forward to this time together. Amen. We want to remember that they're there. It's a good number of people that are with us. Brothers and sisters, how nice it would be to see them. Amen. Uh we're going to be turning to John's Gospel, the 14th chapter. While you're turning, I'd just like to make mention that my sister-in-law, my wife's sister, Sister Dorothy McGown, she's streaming the service this morning from her home back in Dawson Creek. She moved back to Dawson Creek. She has uh family there also and she wanted to go back and be near them. Three of her six children live here in the Vancouver area, but so she will be back here occasionally for a visit and she'll certainly be missed by all of us and especially Sister Lynn Douly who we appreciate so much. uh spent uh many hours together and I think mostly every Monday morning they spent together and we were so thankful for that. also uh brother Lloyd and sister Alice uh Siller who always sat right here in this middle section. They have uh moved back to Chatwind and that is uh I think almost all of their family live there in Chatwin and they have grandchildren and you know when people get a little bit up in years it's nice to have the family around and to be near them. So, we uh appreciated Brother Lloyd and Sister Alice Siller and uh we trust they're having a a wonderful time. We're glad that so many of their children are uh birthed into this word into this message and uh we're so we just want you to know these things. All right, we're going to read from John's Gospel. And I I trust that those of you that were here last Sunday have taken advantage of this week and have had opportunity to uh to be in the last four messages that Brother Brandham spoke. I appreciate the songs that the sisters sang. They're right in line and right in harmony with what the Holy Spirit has been speaking to me. And uh I I do appreciate the words that they the were inspired by the by the sisters to sing. On the 14th chapter of John, we'll start to read. Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. And whether I go, you know, and the way you know. And Thomas said unto him,"Lord, we know not whether thou goest, and how can we know the way?" And Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If you had known me, you should have known my Father also. And from henceforth you know him and have seen him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word. Let's just have a word of prayer. Father, we are so dependent upon you. We are depending on you to take our minds and the thoughts, oh God. Direct them into channels that will lead us up into heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Uh tear us away, oh God, from old traditions, old ideas, concepts, Lord, that bind us and hold us down. May we may they fall away, oh God. May the chains of of our minds, Lord, that that have kept us chained over the years, I pray, Lord, that they will just drop away. And may the power of the Holy Spirit release us, oh God, to soar where believers should be soaring, Lord. This is a rapture season certainly. And I pray you'll prepare us, Lord, and make us so ready. I pray that all of our spiritual senses will be so alerted and brought, oh God, to a place where we can believe and have that rapturing faith. the name of Jesus Christ. Take control of my being. Lord, take control of each one and all who listen now and may hear in the future. I pray, oh God, that you will do uh do something special for us. For we ask it for your glory and may the name of Jesus Christ be lifted up. We pray our savior and lord. Amen. You may be seated. I'm continuing on from last Sunday. So once again uh you will need to keep your thoughts very very focused and don't be uh moving about and soon as people get settled and all the musicians and so are settled because I want so bad that you'll be able to enter into what I've been entering into and if I can tell you that after you know so many many years, you you just begin to see things from a different perspective and not merely seeing things from a different perspective, but you feel as though God is is moving you and wanting to move the people and move the congregation. you know, we we speak uh that, you know, it's a different time, it's a different season, and and I think a minister gets behind the pullpit, and he so hungers and desires that God will be able to take and captivate the minds and thoughts of the people and bring them into that channel so that we can be the recipients of all that God has for us in this season. And listen friends, we're we're believing and we do believe not only that we're in a rapture season. Those can just be idle words. And I I believe also that some of our terminology uh we have we in the message we give different terminology to the same old sometimes religious thought or religious upbringing and rapture is not a unique word to the believer. Yeah, rapture. Uh, all kinds of Christianity use the word rapture and we think of one thing and perhaps they think of another. But I can tell you that there's a lot of things concerning the rapture and aspects of the rapture that we believe that Pentecostals believe, the oneness believe, trinitarians believe, the Baptists believe exactly the same. you know, they have a flash whisbang that the whole thing's over and it's all in the moment in the twinkling of an eye. And the message the message to me has been more and more and more I've been realizing that uh there's there's some things that are so significant within the message that I believe and I can just bring this to you this way. I believe that God ordained at this season that the last messenger had to indeed be a prophet messenger so he could take out those selected scriptures, bring them forward, deliver them under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit so the people could get a hold of that and that would generate the faith to make the change that needs to take place &gt;&gt; and that's the only thing that's going to bring about the change. &gt;&gt; Amen. My my the grand and final marathon. This is a part two. God bless you, brother Gary. the the Athenians which is of Athens uh they commemorate the the marathon because it was a run by a soldier and I don't know if I can say his word exactly right but it appears to be Fidipities and this soldier by the name of Phip Fidipities he ran from a battlefield from Marathon which was 26.2 two uh miles and uh because the Athenians were outnumbered by the Persians and looked like they would be certainly defeated and they had won a they had actually won a victory at at Marathon and so Phidipodes ran the entire distance from Marathon to Athens. And uh and when he arrived, he delivered the momentous message, Nike, which is not a running shoe. It's a Greek word for victory. And he cried Nike and collapsed and died. And from that time from that dramatic conclusion of running from marathon to Athens that was the thing that initiated and inspired the marathon run. Now there's a fellow and uh I'm kind of glad for some help that I get from time to time and they say you ought to see this site after I finish preaching. They say you ought to see this. uh there's a fellow and uh they've said about him there are those of us whose idea of the ultimate physical challenge is the 26.2 mile Boston marathon and then there is Dean Carnazas I guess it is Carnazas I may have his name spoken not pronounced correctly but he has run 262 miles non-stop 262 miles. I actually saw him on my computer. They interviewed him and he he has run 262 miles. He has won the 135mile Badwater Ultra Ultra Marathon across Death Valley. He's considered the world's toughest which is considered the world's toughest foot race in 130 degree weather. He has run a marathon to the South Pole, to the frigid area. He has uh done has has has committed himself to absolutely mind-boggling adventures in these non-stop tres said the hell of Death Valley and the incomprehensible frigidity of the South Pole and the breathtaking beauty of the mountains and canyons of Sierra Nevada. They said that he captures the euphoria of outofbody heights in these adventures and uh he he's describes him as as gruesome terrible terribly gruesome but on the other hand he's a he's also a father has a family wife and a family and uh so he's written of course a lot of things and I suppose a lot of people want to uh inquire he said he believes it's possible possible possible for a human to run 500 miles non-stop. He has learned how to run and sleep while he runs. He said the only problem was he found himself running right down the middle of the road and was almost hit by a car and he'd wake up, but he keep running, eat while he run, and uh sleep while he run. And he didn't think it was possible, but it is possible. And this has all been documented and everything else. He has officially run 262 miles through the Hell of Death Valley. But there is a people who maybe never run the Boston Marathon and they have never run 262 miles, but they have run through Leodysia. &gt;&gt; They have run through the hell, not of Death Valley as a geographical location, but they have run every day of their lives since God got a hold of their lives. And I tell you, it's been a run through the forces of hell. That has been a run through the darkness of demon powers that has been operating in every in every field and every area of your lives. And they have run with one goal in mind. And it is the prize. &gt;&gt; It's not having some acclaim of man. And it's not having some metal around your neck. But oh, I tell you, I want to be greeted. I want to be greeted with the host on the other side. And it's probably a lot closer than any of us think. &gt;&gt; We're speaking of the rapture. The prophet of God said, "Must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease?" This was in the junction of time. While others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas. No sir said God doesn't promise ease and prosperity but he promises grace to endure in every trial. It's the grace that we look to. And he quoted from the poem. Must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody seas? No, I must fight. I must reign. Increase my courage, Lord. He said, that's my prayer. And he went on this uh long fellow's poem. Tell me not in mournful numbers. Life is just an empty dream, and the soul is dead that slumbers, and things are not what they seem. Yay, life is real, and life is earnest. The grave is not its goal. Dust thou art to dust returnest was not spoken of the soul. Lives of great men all remind us. And we can make our lives sublime with partings leave behind us footprints on the sands of time. Footprints that perhaps another sailing or life's solemn man. For a forlorn and ship shipwrecked brother seeing shall take heart again. Let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate, still achieving, still pursuing, learn to labor and to wait. &gt;&gt; In the rapture message, the word rapture, as he points out, is not in the Bible, but it is a a word that the Bible said we shall be caught up. Caught up. uh he said we read in first Thessalonians and in the rapture message I'm part of this we'll just summarize last Sunday but I feel it's very essential I'd like to move this subject just forward slowly in the last in the rapture message which I I want to stress for all of you that were here and those of you that were not here if you were not here listen especially close to me the last four messages are So very very significant because as he was preaching the rapture message and as I was going through that and especially things that are to be and then modern events, I began to thinking about the place where I was in the message and having heard them. I just came to the awareness this ministry unlike any I can say since Adam. Adam didn't have this ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus himself they the scripture says that if all the books were written of the things that he did the world itself couldn't contain them because all the things were done by him but Jesus himself it's not even recorded what he allowed to be recorded in this generation there have been no ministry like that and we have come we have come and have been born by a natural birth in a season that almighty God knew we would be here and ordained that we should be here in this very very significant season. And I am stressing it because I think I cannot stress it enough. This is of all people who need to say why am I here? &gt;&gt; You need to say that &gt;&gt; of all people. Why did God have me here in this season of time? Why did God have me in this end time? In the days of the days of Noah are certainly here. The days of Sodom are certainly here. The days when the messengers are certainly here and everything comes crashing together in one such significant time of all people. We need to say, why am I here? Why did God have me to be birthed in this season? Why did God in his divine program have me hear this message that I've heard? &gt;&gt; Why did he do that? And surely he must have a divine purpose in it. And so here comes brother Brandham. He's ending his his just a few hours left of ministry. And at the point I was at, it was like I estimated about six more hours. Six more hours that he was going to preach. And I was living at that time expecting to go down and hear more services and great things were going to happen and so on and so forth. And suddenly the voices silenced and there's been nothing sight like that. And Tommy Osbborne, who actually spoke a memorial service, he said, "I'm going to be misunderstood." I wish he could hear those same words again himself. He said, "I'm going to be misunderstood, but God walked amongst us &gt;&gt; in a little man." And he said, and he said, "Make no mistake. You won't see this again." &gt;&gt; If he ever prophesied, that was one time &gt;&gt; and it has never been happened since. Make no mistake, it won't happen again. It won't be duplicated again. And as long as you live, I guarantee you, you won't see that again. That happened for one purpose, to get a people to prepare a people for the catching away. And if that is so, then those secrets of the catching away are right there. The secrets of the change. It's not going to be some flash from heaven or some carpet that rolls down like the Jews expected the Messiah would come. And unfortunately, the Gentiles are believing exactly like the Jews that somehow, you know, the heavens are going to burst wide open and the son of man is going to come descending down. He's already descended down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And so some of the things that I have to say um may be just to to shake your thoughts and to index them and turn them to see things uh just a little bit differently. So we read in Thessalonians he said first Thessalonians and this is the only time he said these words if you were to search through the computer you'd find and I I I marvel at this because when when he says something that is so startling and uh it it leaves your mind and leaves a question almost at the end something you have to search to to answer. uh that is when I pay special attention to it. And so he said we read in first Thessalonians the order of this great rapture and he never never before put the rapture into an order. Said this order of this great rapture that will take place in this in the last days. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want you to notice this great thing taking place here. Don't miss this from the 13th to the 16th verse. And he said three things that has to happen before the Lord himself appears. The first thing happened, notice a shout, a voice, and a trumpet. &gt;&gt; Now the he said three things happen. A shout, a voice, a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears. Jesus does all three of them when he's descending. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A shout. These are selected phrases. Now, a shout. What is a shout? It's a message going forth. The living bread of life, bringing forth the bride. So, it's to gather the living. Shout a messenger getting the people ready. &gt;&gt; And this messenger now is going to be gone in just a matter of days and only going to speak another few hours. So, what I'm going to say is this that the shout has already been declared &gt;&gt; and he at the end of the shout he was simply telling people that was the shout. In fact, as I want you to notice very very carefully what what he is actually doing. He is progressing himself. He is progressing through the process of these three stages. He's actually moving through in his ministry because now the shout has already been completed and he's simply notifying the people that's been the shout. Amen. &gt;&gt; The shout is the message to gather the people and that had already been laid down &gt;&gt; and now he's notifying them. That's what you've heard. And the second is a voice of the resurrection. The same voice that allowed a loud voice in John 11:38-44 that called Lazarus from the grave. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the dead to be caught up with it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the trumpet, the trumpet was always a gathering. So all three of them are a gathering. The shout is a gathering of the living. The voice is a gathering of those that are asleep. And the trumpet is a gathering of both of those together to to meet the Lord in the air, as they say. All right. And don't don't let these terminologies be locked into your fixed idea of what it is. Let's let's just hear what it is. He said, "And then what the next is what was a trumpet." The third thing is a trumpet which always at the feast of trumpets is calling the people. See, they're all calling the people together. is calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride's supper, &gt;&gt; the lamb's supper with the bride in the sky. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The first things comes forth. I'm just summarizing from last week. The first thing comes forth is his message calling the bride together. Repeating it. See, I'm repeating, but he's repeating. The next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride and they're caught together and the trumpet, the feast of the feast in the heavens in the sky. That's the thing that takes place, friends. And we're right there, ready now. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham moves through this sequence essentially living out the message in the in the in this process. This actually the process of the rapture. And now I'm going to have you go to uh the rapture scripture text if you would to uh Psalms 27. When people go to school or you go to any other place, it's common to do review, isn't it? &gt;&gt; And we got most important thing to review. We want to have this firmly in our minds. And I'm just going to read for the shortness of time. Going to read from verse 3 to 5. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear, though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. In this will I be confident. Remember last Sunday, this one thing I'll be confident. One thing have I desired of the Lord. This is where David's confidence was anchored. I'm I'm in this one thing will I be confident because one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord. The house is a dwelling place all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple which is also a dwelling place. For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion. that also is a temporary dwelling place. And in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me, and he shall set me upon a rock. Now, now that was just be mindful of a moment, please. And and I'm I'm going to uh I'm going to try to be as clear as possible. when the Apostle Paul, just digressing for a moment, when the Apostle Paul was going to bring uh and introduce to the Hebrews the that the Hebrews that had come into uh had had come into an experience of the New Testament, he begins to introduce Melzdc. They they don't know a whole lot about MelzDC. But he goes back and he picks just a scripture, a line out of the Psalms concerning Melzdc and back into Genesis and he just takes those scriptures, brings them forward, goes back thou art to priest after the order of Melzdc. Brings it forward and ties it all together in a marvelous package to the Hebrews in verse in chapter five and six and seven in there. And now he's bringing these just these selected lines as it were selected verses bringing them forward as as a prophet apostle he's bringing it forward saying now this is it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now this is the high priest &gt;&gt; and he's an or after the order of Melzdc and he has to turn it around. It has nothing to do with Aaron. Aaron died but this is one without a beginning of days or an end of life. This is a whole different priesthood. We're under a different priesthood. You're entering into another era now. And you see, he's ordained to do that. But the thing I want to point out to you is that he will take just a a a scripture, just a line, because they were all, it was already laying there. But it took God by the Holy Spirit through a selected vessel to pick that scripture up, bring it forward, and say to the people, "This is now." &gt;&gt; That's precisely what Brother Brandham's doing at the very end of his life, being divinely led of the Holy Spirit. goes back to Psalms 27 to bring it forward &gt;&gt; as a prophetic. I will dwell in the house of the Lord. He'll hide me in the secret of his in in his pavilion, in the secret of his tabernacle, and I I will dwell there. This is this is it. And the prophet is saying that's rapture. &gt;&gt; It's not just David desiring, you know, having a certain desire or something. The prophet now has taken those scriptures, bringing them forward to a people that that that have it in their heart that they are a rapture generation. We see the world. We see the governments. We see the nation. We see Israel. We see everything that's happened in just the last 50 years. And we can't shake it. We can't get away from it. We can't close our eyes and say it didn't happen. It's all here. All the signs are here. All the evidence is here. And the word of God is being fulfilled on every front. &gt;&gt; Why would it be considered unreasonable that God would send a messenger and at the very end of his life pull out those certain selected scriptures? Say that's not just Psalms 27. That's rapture. &gt;&gt; This isn't Psalm 27 now. This is rapture. &gt;&gt; I will one thing I've desired of the Lord to dwell in the house of the Lord to to dwell in his habitation. And so we we went over we went over that. And this to me is the great prize. &gt;&gt; We're in the marathon, but this is the great prize. &gt;&gt; Listen, my brothers, my sisters, by God's grace, I trust I'll be able to enter the rapture. &gt;&gt; And if I am called away and am sleeping, I pray by his grace. I don't feel worthy of it, but I pray by his grace that I will hear that voice. All right. And I tell you what, whether it be ashes or what it is, you rise out of the elements and and and and take a hold of uh uh take a hold of the next the next uh event that is for us. &gt;&gt; I know that if a person sleeps, you're in your theophony, but in the resurrection, you're into a glorified state. It takes this body, the theophony body and the resurrected one, those three to make the glorified one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has perfected in threes. &gt;&gt; And so when the disciples when they were so enthralled that the spirits were subject to them, Jesus said, "Don't rejoice in that. Maybe you have something to be happy over this last week. Something has happened. Oh, you just see God doing things and oh, you're you're thrilled and you're excited about things. I'd like to say to you today, don't rejoice in that. &gt;&gt; We have one prize. Rejoice that your names are written in heaven. Rejoice that you found out one day your name was in heaven. Has nothing to do with your job. Has nothing to do with this life. has nothing to do with things down here being socially better or economically better or anything else or even spiritually better. It has to do rejoice that your names are in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the prize. &gt;&gt; And that's why Apostle Paul I I press toward the mark &gt;&gt; for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. And as Jesus was nearing the end of his race, he looked to the prize that was before him, always just towards the end of his marathon, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, he endured the cross. He ran through death valley. He ran through hell. He descended down to the depths where souls were in prison and preached to them. And he emptied out paradise. What a marathon he ran. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's the al ultimate marathon. He ran the ultimate marathon. He's the ultimate marathon man. Hallelujah. He came down from the realms of glory and descended down here and took upon himself a vile body of this flesh and it was mutilated in a short time going to the cross standing there in his quietness and saying no man takes my life from me. &gt;&gt; I will lay it down and I will take it up again. Oh, what a marathon. &gt;&gt; And it's not a myth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a story. It happened and it happened just like that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon refers to it in things that are to be. You heard me say it last Sunday and he and he refers to it and it actually is so applicable. He's I won't say he's speaking of himself, but he's speaking of the revealing of the son of man. His life is fixing to end here on earth as also was the prophets was fixing to end on earth. And as brother Brandham was nearing, I would say the finish line of his marathon through life, he left an example and clear instructions of what we must do to finish the race. &gt;&gt; Amen. the prize of a new dwelling place. He even brings up brother Daddy Dao was sitting there. He said a good friend of mine, Daddy, he was bringing a point and I'm trying to draw from all of these different areas and you'll have to collect it in your mind and and hold it there and meditate it on, ponder it. I can't tell you how deeply I've been pondering these things. He said, "Now there's Daddy Da. He's 93. I think he said he's 40 years older than he was. He said, "Now put 40 years on him." He said, "Aren't we glad there's a door called death? Look where we'd be." That's what science and that's what this life holds for us. If that's all there is, I say, "Thank God that there's a word. Thank God there's a promise. Thank God there's something to believe. &gt;&gt; Thank God that he confirmed it. &gt;&gt; And so these last four messages and he begins to speak about the rapture and the rapture message there is a place. I'm going to go quickly over this because I want to get to some other things this morning. But the house, I wanted to have it on the screen for you, but perhaps we'll be able to do it yet another time. The house, he said, the house, which is a it's a dwelling habitation. It also figuratively speaks of your own body. It also speaks of the collective family, the household. I want to dwell in the house of the Lord. I want to dwell in that household. I want to be with those that belong to him. &gt;&gt; And then it also has direct reference to something that's established that has continuity. He could see David had a lot of trouble in his household. Do you know that &gt;&gt; David had a lot of trouble with his sons and his daughters. He had a lot of trouble. And it must have been on his mind. He'd been a man of war and he shed a lot of blood. And even the word went out. They said, "David, you you've stirred him up. He's like a lion. He was and and and the military were telling telling the men, you got trouble on your hands. You stirred up David. He He was a perhaps unassuming kind of man, but when he went to war, he was a he had violence. And yet he there was something about him. He have such a love for God. My soul pantth after thee as the heart panth after the water brooks. So pantth my soul after thee. And God saw that. I want to dwell in your house. I want to be in your pavilion. I want to be in your tabernacle. I want to be in your temple. God loved him. &gt;&gt; He had his eyes set on something else. He can say, "My my household is changing. My children, everything is it's taking a I've had some disappointments, but I want to be in yours. One that's established, one that is permanent, one that has continuity." And then I want to inquire. I want to ponder this one who remembered no doubt that as as a shepherd boy. He remembered the pastoral green pastures and the still waters. That's why it came back to him. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. Oh, he leadeth me beside the still waters. He had he had experienced that. He could draw that from his memory. But when he said, "I want to I want to sit down and ponder and reflect in his sanctuary." And that his sanctuary is also coming from a a Hebrew word that is to prevail, to overcome, to endure, and to have power. I'm not going to be weakened in his in his temple. I'm going to endure and I'm going to have victory. &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul's saying, "Know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost?" That temple is no different than the temple David was desiring to dwell in. He I don't have a desire to dwell in a Your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost. I don't have a desire to to dwell necessarily in a body that is weakening, a body that is aging, a body that has less ability, the body that has less perhaps mind or mental retention. We don't desire that. You don't desire that. That isn't something we desire. But I but while we are here, I desire overcoming power while we are here. continuity of faith to remain steadfast, unmovable. I don't want to go the way that others have gone. &gt;&gt; You want to be steadfast. I'm going to be here as long as God chooses that this temple shall be a temple of the Holy Ghost. We're going to remain steadfast. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what David is crying out for. Prevailing and overcoming power and be hid in his pavilion. And you notice there's always his temple, not my temple or a temple, his temple, his pavilion, the secret of his tabernacle. And hidden his pavilion, it's the the security that was found in Jehovah's presence. And his pavilion is actually from the Old Testament, which I covered last Sunday, the the the thicket or the booth that they had to dwell in and remembered. Every year they have to put up a booth and dwell in there seven days to recall their journey through uh the wilderness. And we have are reminded in this feast that we are not permanent residents here. We are aliens. We are foreigners. Don't get too settled down here because you are a transient. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are transients, young people. You might think you have years and years and years ahead of you. You never know. We are all transients here. As the prophet said, in five minutes from now, you could be a corpse. &gt;&gt; And in five minutes from now, we could all be in glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have here no permanent dwelling place. Remember, this is just a booth. Yes. &gt;&gt; But David is saying, "Oh, I want to dwell in your booth. &gt;&gt; I want to dwell in one that's never going to be taken down. I want to dwell in one that's never going to age or become ancient. I want to dwell in one that is permanent forever &gt;&gt; in your pavilion." And lastly, well, perhaps I should just stay on this a moment. It was not only a temporary uh shelter, but it was a rude a rude temporary shelter. And the scripture says, "Who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body?" And I don't care how expensively or how wonderfully a person may doctor up this old frame, it's still a vile body. There's nothing very glamorous about it. It's a vile, weak body of flesh. But the scripture says that that he may fashion that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself. And that vile body is a body of low estate. A body of humiliation has been my part. You know, and and and I it's a paradox to me how they aged go the whole cycle almost from a child. You see them, they can't feed themselves. I always feel that's so sad and they lose their independence and their kids rise up and say, "No, you can't do that." When it was them at one time that told the kids, "No, you can't do that." Now the kids rise up and say, "No, you can't do that. Now sign over your bank account. No, you can't. Now we'll tell you what to do. We'll tell you where to live. We'll do everything else. You're quiet." But that comes that comes for all of us at some point in time. And it's a I've been by the bedside when it's been a most humiliating. You lose all the independence and you become totally totally a dependent on someone else. It's a vile body, a humiliating body. And we don't have any promise here for this frame. But oh, do we have a glorious promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the scripture says of him, "And being in fashion, found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross." Oh, people have crosses up and crosses in their cars and crosses in their churches and crosses around their necks. And I see some of the most vulgar people with crosses around their neck. I think what a blasphemy that is. Has nothing to do. The cross of my Lord Jesus is a cross of shame, a cross of suffering, a cross that you wouldn't want to look at right now. Had blood probably on it and flesh from his body on it. And to see Spittle hanging on his beard and part of his beard tore out and his black and mangled with the with the thongs of the whip. And to see him laying standing there naked so we could be clothed. It was not something of beauty. It was a horror &gt;&gt; sight. &gt;&gt; But he was humiliated &gt;&gt; so that we could have his glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, we can never be thankful enough. And then David says, David says, "Oh, that to hide me in the secret of his tabernacle." Which is precisely, we won't get to it today, but that is precisely where brother Brandham moves in the in the second from the last service, which is modern events. modern events, your event, in other words, made clear by the prophecy. And when you read Luke 24, starting at about the 13th verse, I believe it is, and two men on the way to Emmas, soon as you read that, and I want you all to read that. Soon as you read that, you say to yourself, I am reading a prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am reading a prophecy. And a prophecy is something that's to be fulfilled. And the prophet has said now these are this is a modern event made clear by the prophecy. So what is hidden here? Those key truths that are here are for another people to fulfill this prophecy. And I will say to you, you are those people that will fulfill that prophecy. And that prophecy to me was the trumpet because he said the trumpet was a gathering of the resurrected with those that were still alive. And and Luke 24 is Jesus Christ the resurrected walking with two that were mortal. &gt;&gt; And it could be you. &gt;&gt; Already women had been to the tomb. Some of the ladies had been to the tomb and saw a vision of angels. And to them it was strange. They were so close to it and yet they couldn't grasp it. They were so close to it. The women of our company have already been to the tomb and he's not there and we don't know what's happened and this is already the third day. They were right on the verge of it. They were seeing it. They remembered everything he said and it's so close to them and now he the resurrected one is actually walking with them and they cannot see now he's already in that other place. And he was and in John the 14th chapter, the only thing that's why the the resurrection did not happen when Jesus spoke to John. But Jesus only had a few hours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like brother Brandham only had a few hours &gt;&gt; when when brother Brandham was reading John 14. He's at the same place in his ministry Jesus was in his. He only had a few hours left. He's already in his he's in the Passover chamber when he's talking to them. And he only has a few hours to be with them. He's only going to say he's maybe going to say even much less than brother Brandham said in the next three services much less. And he's only going to be with him a few hours. And he said in that in John 14, I go to prepare a place for you. And notice what he said that where I am. &gt;&gt; Not where I will be, but where I am that there you might be also. &gt;&gt; And what if you shall see the Son of Man? No man hath ascended up to heaven except the son of man that came down from heaven. And he said, "And the son of man which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says that'll take an inoculation. &gt;&gt; To understand that one, he said that'll take an inoculation. I say, "Oh God, inoculate us. &gt;&gt; We'll understand these things. Inoculate us. Give us revelation. Inoculate this congregation today with revelation. &gt;&gt; And here here the prophet is taking John 14. I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there ye may be also. And the only thing that's going to happen between then and the next few hours and they're totally mystified. They cannot see it. But in the next few hours, a resurrection is going to happen. In the next few hours, paradise is going to be actually emptied. In the next few hours, there's going to be there's going to be uh the resurrected going to be walking in the streets of Jerusalem appearing to the believers &gt;&gt; in the next few hours. &gt;&gt; And here they are. And he's telling them, he's forewarning them. And they said, "Well, we don't know where you're going. How do we know the way?" He says, "I'm the way." Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's still the way. &gt;&gt; That revealed word is still the way. &gt;&gt; And when you're in it, you're on your road. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why it's so imperative to have the word. Not say, "I'm a message believer. I believe Malachi 4." It's got to be the word for this season right now. &gt;&gt; And he's moving the people. and the and between John 14 and Luke 24 what notice now where God has directed a prophet to take those between John 14 talking about I'm going to uh I'm going to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also between that and Luke 24 which he says is a prophecy because it was a prophecy for people that were yet to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And between those two are you following me? &gt;&gt; Amen. And between those two, Jesus Jesus has the resurrection himself. And now he's into the trumpet. &gt;&gt; He's into the great order. The shout has already been laid down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Between John 14 and Luke 24, a resurrection has taken place which only the voice can raise them. &gt;&gt; And so the resurrection has taken place. People are being street seen in the streets of Jerusalem. The resurrected and Jesus the resurrected. And the prophet said the gathering the trumpet is a gathering of the resurrected with those that are those that are still living. And here they are two Cleopus and his friend on the way to Emmas and one steps up beside them. A prophecy to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope that we're alert enough. Say, "Oh God, let me fulfill that prophecy. And the secret was his tabernacle, his dwelling place had changed. That was the secret. David and here, brother Brandham, now just day before yesterday, he had taken uh Psalms 20:27. Hide me in the secret. Let me have the security in the secret of knowing who you are and where you are. Don't let me be confounded. Don't let me be ignorant. &gt;&gt; Don't let me be clouded. Don't let me be dull. Let me know where you are. And here they are. They're they're heavy-hearted. Why? Because they haven't seen. They've lost the secret of his dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't know where he is. &gt;&gt; He's not in the tomb. &gt;&gt; And he's certainly not walking with us as he was a few days ago. &gt;&gt; Where he is? Where is he? The women said they saw angels. We don't know where he's gone. &gt;&gt; And the only thing that had happened, his dwelling place had changed. And it wasn't them. As I've said here before many times, it was not them who was determined to find him. They were heavy. They were heavy-hearted. They were reasoning between themselves. They were mystified. What is happening to this message &gt;&gt; to the message that we've believed? &gt;&gt; The disciples are hiding in a locked room. The apostles of the Lord, the women are running to from the tomb saying the tomb's empty, the stones rolled away. The soldiers have gone into the city to report all of this chaos and everything that's happened that they can't explain. The whole thing is getting to be a bit of an uproar and we don't know what's happening. and they're still walking with the word. &gt;&gt; And it's Christ that's determined to bring them into the secret, [Applause] &gt;&gt; not Christ. &gt;&gt; You have to understand that Christ, who is this word, the spirit of this word is determined to bring you and hold you in his grasp and bring you into the reality. Oh God, I I trust your souls are hungering after it to bring you into the reality of where we are now today. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, he could come any time or whatever more." What if it is that he's here right now, trying to get next to you, trying to get your mind to be loosed from the chains and the bondages of all traditions and things. And people have even made a tradition out of the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to be loosed from it. &gt;&gt; All the little phrases and coin little jargon that we got de developed. All it is is message jargon. It has to be a reality &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; The very word laid out there changing you. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; So that was the secret of his tabernacle. Then he goes into let not your heart be troubled. He said, "Last night I was speaking in Yuma, the Christian businessman spoke on the rapture." He said, "If being Christians, I think we ought to be kind of notified ahead." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen what he's saying. As Christians, we ought to be notified ahead. That's what the message was all about. things that are to be. And Jesus explained, Jesus explained to the people, now I'm getting down to the nub of today. Jesus explained to his disciples and to the people, the dwelling place of God on earth, trying to get across to them without saying it right outright. Like the prophet said, he never went around saying, "I'm the son of God. I'm the son of God. I'm the son of God." Never went around saying that. Call himself the son of man, but acted in such a way and did things that the those that were hungry, those that had the call of God, the elect of God out there, would search for it and would observe it and would ponder it and and meditate upon it until the Holy Spirit would open their eyes and they could look past the flesh. Look past his garment. Look past his lowly Galilean language and say, "Thou art the Christ." &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou, Peter. And I say, "Blessed art thou, &gt;&gt; members of the bride of Jesus Christ, whoever you are, &gt;&gt; God knows those that are his." Blessed art thou. &gt;&gt; If God has revealed this Christ to you, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Let not your hearts be troubled." He was talking to the Jews. "You believed in God, believe also in me." &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it was a it was a a million light years between what the Jews believed God was and what they saw dwelling there. &gt;&gt; You believed in God. You believed in this great being. Now believe in me. &gt;&gt; As you have believed in God, believe in me because I am the son of God. Brother, I'm saying that now clearly. In other words, I and my father are one. &gt;&gt; My father is dwelling in me. &gt;&gt; And what you see me doing, it's not me. It's my father that dwelleth in me. Now, brother Brandham was not just talking historically. &gt;&gt; He was telling the people right then &gt;&gt; cuz he just finished telling them. He said talking about after 3 years any move of God they denominated and they died. And then he said, "This &gt;&gt; this has been going for 20 years and there's no denomination and there never will be." &gt;&gt; Because it can't denominate. &gt;&gt; You can't denominate this word. It never will be. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; And so he's going on now. Jesus was trying to get those Jews to believe in who it was that was dwelling in him and working through him. and the prophet is making. Oh, I hope God just gives you perception now and understanding because it's not that we elevate brother Brandham as a man but in so in so recognizing what was operating in him then we can recognize who it is that's trying to deal with you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You give that honor. See Jesus, that's why it was so critical that they would look upon his flesh and see it was God. By so doing it, transferred to them &gt;&gt; and gave them position. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And so by recognizing what God did now in this prophetic ministry, it it it it's then it's not William Bran's message. It is almighty God &gt;&gt; hiding behind a veil of flesh that called you and you say oh God not a man &gt;&gt; and he's saying I can't do these things it's God that dwelleth in me my father that dwelleth in me and this is like right when he said Jesus life now he goes right on because he's actually describing his own ministry it's not me that have done this work this great ministry that has not denominated for 20 years it's Not me that's done this work. It's been God. As Jesus said using the same words that dwelleth in me, he has done these works. He said, "And now Jesus life was fixing to end on earth." So so was this revealing of the son of man. This revelation that was taking place was was going to cease to be seen as it was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to take on another form. &gt;&gt; And Jesus life was fixing to end on earth. And he'd showed the people and had proved to them that was precisely his own ministry. Had showed to the people and had proved to them that he was he was Jehovah manifested in the flesh by the great signs and wonders. And I will say if Jehovah was not dwelling in a man called William Brandham, he wouldn't have done any of the things he did. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You understand what I'm saying? And if Jehovah didn't dwell in you, you're a failure. And if Jehovah is not dwelling in you, you're lost. &gt;&gt; It's God in his people. &gt;&gt; And all that he was, he poured into Christ. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And all that was in Christ, he poured into the church. All a ll he poured into the church. &gt;&gt; He was one that had proved that God was in him. preached on proving. You say now talk about the three messengers and told and the one was God in flesh and ate ate meat, drank milk, ate buttermen &gt;&gt; and told what was in Sarah's heart behind in the tent behind him. And I sat on the platform as you know and I'm going to say it again. So I'm turn his back and say let's see if that same God is present. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's see if that same God is here. And he would do exactly the same thing. &gt;&gt; Who is it? It's the same person. &gt;&gt; And he was telling them that after his death, there is life because I go and prepare a place that is to receive you. I want to stop. It is like he says a phrase and then interprets the phrase. I go to prepare a place. He interprets it. That is to receive you. &gt;&gt; I want to get you a jump start. You are already in that place. because he has received you. &gt;&gt; And by walking, by walking in each word as he makes it known, there's no more guarantee you'll come up out of the grave than there is a guarantee right now. or you'll just go right from where you are into what you're supposed to be, what you're ordained, because it's the the word that has brought you to where you are right now. &gt;&gt; I I want you to see that I go to prepare a place for you that is to receive them. And he said that shows that there's a life after this life is ended. It's important that you see that you've already entered into that process. &gt;&gt; He said it it's the continuing. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I want your full attention. It's the continuing of this same life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In another world, another place. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's the continuing of the same life that you have. It won't be the same body, &gt;&gt; but it will be the same life. &gt;&gt; You have desires and you have a love for him that will only intensify. &gt;&gt; Says television will show you and I won't go into it because you all know it well. Television will prove to you that there's sounds going through this room and there's voices going through this room and there's colors going through this room. We don't have the instrument here on the platform to capture it. All of these things are going through this room. And he said bodies are going through the room because the the signals in the machine do not invent it. It only captures what's already in the air. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brings it down, makes it real. And he said it was here when Elijah was here. It was here when Moses was here. But they wouldn't believe it back then. But science now has brought it forward to this time because this is the time. And these are the people that believe that. And the children aren't surprised with it. It's just a it's a common place &gt;&gt; and we're attuned to another realm. We're attuned to another dimension. Hollywood is completely playing on it all the time. all these video games continually playing on it. But there is a real place &gt;&gt; and there's a real dimension. &gt;&gt; He said it was easy for those Jews who had been taught through generations to believe that there was a great supernatural God. But to think that that God had come down, &gt;&gt; that's the problem. &gt;&gt; That's the challenge. To think that that God had come down and was manifesting himself through the person of his son Jesus Christ, God tabernacled in a body of flesh. That was too much for them to understand. &gt;&gt; It was imperative. And furthermore, the prophet was speaking to groups of people at this time that couldn't see it and furthermore didn't want to see it and furthermore were resisting it. &gt;&gt; You can sense it. You can hear it. because he was chastising them also for the Pentecost, for the way that they were living, for the way they were dressing, for the way that the women cut their hair and the way that they dressed and the the type of dress and the men for hanging on to their denominational theories and and and and being resistant to letting that go to believe what was being said. He said, "And when you see my life ending, it's ending for a purpose." &gt;&gt; I say believers should have been even awake and I have pondered these things for many. What you're hearing right now is things I pondered for about six or eight years. So don't think this was last week that I dreamed this up. things that have been moving in my heart for a lot of years and I wondered if I could just continue to approach it and you'll give me some a little bit of time. Brother Lance is preaching tonight, but he has all the time in the world. This is the Lord's day &gt;&gt; and as long as you're able to to stay with me. I'll just carry on for a few more minutes. When you see my life ending, it's ending for a purpose. and I'm going away to prepare a place for you that where I am, there you may be also. Jesus therefore telling his disciples that his life is not ended in death. Now I want to take you on a little journey. It's not only that he came down, but how did he come down? How did God come down? &gt;&gt; That's the question. Do you know why it's critical? Because that's the way you're going to go up. &gt;&gt; Amen. And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, &gt;&gt; even the son of man which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet quotes that and says that'll take an inoculation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why did he say that? Because there was something there. &gt;&gt; No man hath descended or ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven. How did he come down? The process of how he came down. Now I want to remember something. Matthew and also Luke's gospel. One takes it from the royal lineage and one takes it from the natural lineage. Luke takes it from a natural lineage and Matthew takes it from the kingly lineage because Matthew was anointed with the lion spirit &gt;&gt; and Luke was with the man's spirit. So, he took it on the human side. But both of them took the genealogies. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? What is the genealogy? You are a descendant &gt;&gt; of your genealogy. &gt;&gt; You have descended. &gt;&gt; There was a time when you were not the person you are. &gt;&gt; And you were in the geneal &gt;&gt; of your greatgrandfather, great great great all the way back. You are the gene which is the biological unit &gt;&gt; by which the character is carried &gt;&gt; from the parents to the children. &gt;&gt; And the prophet goes into that and he uses spiritual gene in these last messages because he needs to get across to the people. You are a spiritual geneal &gt;&gt; from the loins of your father &gt;&gt; and you've come down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have descended down &gt;&gt; all through the uh all through the centuries. You've descended down. And God knew precisely the moment of your birth. &gt;&gt; He knew precisely who would give you birth in this life. &gt;&gt; And it's not dependent on what your parents or your greatgrandparents or your forefathers were. It's what God predestinated that you shall be in this season. And that's why he sent the light of the gospel. You're from many different countries and from many different places, but God in his wisdom ordained that the light of the gospel shall reach that seed. &gt;&gt; Some of you are in hell holes. &gt;&gt; Some of you are giving yourselves to pleasure and sin. and others were steeped in religion. It made no difference what kind of chain held you. God came and broke the chains of thunder. brought light to that spiritual gene &gt;&gt; which is the unit the spiritual biological unit &gt;&gt; that God has ordained in his great scientific laboratory &gt;&gt; that you shall be a portrayer of his character. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the plan of God. But how did he come down? How did God himself come down? Well, because the human seed had become contaminated through the disobedience and the serpent seed in the in the beginning and God saying to the serpent, I'll put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed. Anyone who doesn't believe the serpent seed got to hang right there and answer that question. Whose seed was that? &gt;&gt; His son portrayed who he was. Jesus said that Satan was a murderer from the beginning. But when he became expressed, he was expressed in Cain because that was his son and he was a murderer humanly speaking. But Jesus speaking in another realm says Satan was a murderer from the beginning &gt;&gt; and his instrument was the serpent who God changed his entire physical structure. &gt;&gt; He didn't have he's on a cursed he was of the highest nature spoke and knew the m knew the voice of God and knew what God had said. Hallelujah. So now God's got to come down. So how he comes down first, he inspires the prophets quickly. I hope you stay with me. to inspire Moses and spirit came in him. A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up like unto me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it shall come to pass who doesn't hear him shall be cut off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and the word is laid there. &gt;&gt; It's like like the food that you eat to sustain this body. It's all laid out here. &gt;&gt; Rice was growing long before you lived. potatoes and carrots and the fruit and things to live. We're were we're here long before you came on the scene. God put it here for you to sustain you. Now just hold that. So on down here comes Isaiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, who has believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? He shall go before him and he begins to speak about Jesus. He was wounded for our transgressions. He's bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was laid upon him. And by his stripes, we're healed. And the word is laid out there. &gt;&gt; But he wasn't here yet. And all through the scripture, it's laid out. The word is laid out for him. But because sin had come and all humanity had come through sexual birth, through human bloodstream, God had to start a new bloodstream. And so he laid a he laid a seed out there also that says a virgin shall conceive &gt;&gt; and shall bring forth a son. And now on generations down a little girl descended. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A little virgin girl descended. Simple enough to believe. &gt;&gt; She wasn't interested in science. She wasn't interested in how it is going to happen exactly. But she says, "Let it be unto me according to your word. And the prophet said, the prophet of God said those prophet's words, &gt;&gt; that prophet's word, because the word of a prophet is God's word, but God had to speak it. And the prophet's words lodged in her womb. If a prophet's word, God's word in a prophet can lodge in the womb of a woman and bring forth the son of God, I say that God's word lodged into your flesh can take you from this world into another one. &gt;&gt; And not only can it, it will. &gt;&gt; And the word's already been laid out. &gt;&gt; You're going to go up the same as he came down. Exactly. &gt;&gt; And it was a prophet &gt;&gt; who brought rapture. &gt;&gt; Things that are to be modern events made clear by the prophecy and leadership which is two men having gone to two different places. &gt;&gt; It's all a place a place. A place changing dwelling place. That's the last four messages of the prophet. You're changing a dwelling place. &gt;&gt; But let me notify you folks, and I love you all, but you're not going to sit here on your hands. You're not going to sit here ho h &gt;&gt; and well, God said it and it's just going to happen all the rest of it. Don't don't you fool yourself. &gt;&gt; It doesn't happen that way. And Jesus, he didn't only descend, but he also ascended. &gt;&gt; And he ascended the same way that he descended. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He descended by while he was ma Mary believed the word and that those words lodged in her womb and she brought forth a son called his name Jesus. even as a boy 12. So I must be about my father's business. He wasn't being directed by the school master. He wasn't being directed by the rabbi. Oh, it ought to shake us from being directed by our our our professors and our, you know, our mentors and so on. We should have one mentor in this generation as a prophet of God is our mentor. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. and Jesus. That's why I said last Sunday and say once again and and when when the disciples they you know they they they can manipulate things. Maybe we can arrange things so you're not going to suffer like this. How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I move to escape this, how then? If I move to escape this hardship, how then shall the scripture be fulfilled? Amen. &gt;&gt; And they will say all kinds of nasty things about the bride of Jesus Christ. Those cultish people, the way they dress, the way they act, what kind of nonsense you say it must be. So &gt;&gt; rejoice when men speak evil of you. &gt;&gt; For great is your reward in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How shall it be? The scriptures must thus be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Because you are in your ascension. &gt;&gt; You are in your ascension. &gt;&gt; It's not something going to be. You're in it now. &gt;&gt; And as each word comes and is made known and the prophet said and you'll come into a service, he said there's something in you that's calling. &gt;&gt; There's something in you that's saying I shouldn't do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is, he said, that body &gt;&gt; over there that's calling out for this. &gt;&gt; I come to this pulpit today realizing I haven't got just some little sermon for you. That's not what it is. But I am responding to by the Holy Spirit to what your body yonder is calling for. &gt;&gt; And he brings it to the natural again. He always brings it to the natural. How I said when you were a baby you were being formed in the womb of your mother coming from your natural gene or your father coming out for expression descending into this world. &gt;&gt; You say descending? Where was I? You were in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; You were in the thoughts of God. And I tell you what, it's a far cry down here from where we once were. &gt;&gt; There was no darkness in that mind. There's no sin in that mind. There's none of the things in that mind that we have here. We've descended down &gt;&gt; into a very dark place. &gt;&gt; But that's why he said, "Have no fear. I won't leave you here. I'm going to take you out of here. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take you home." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And you're going to come up. You're going to be resur. You're going to ascend the same way I ascended. How how was it? But following every word by taking that prophet's word that is your mentor and you eat it and you digest it &gt;&gt; and while you pray and while you call upon him and you have a sense I have a certain need within me. Have no fear. God's going to call someone behind the pulpit and they're going to speak exactly what your body needs. [Music] You ought to be standing and shouting. &gt;&gt; Not because I'm preaching because that's the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; Isn't he a kind heavenly father? &gt;&gt; Isn't he a kind heavenly father? &gt;&gt; And he says, I came I came from a poor family. He said we didn't hardly have anything. But he said, "Mother would start craving for something." Oh, she' just start craving for something. Her body was calling for it, for the child, for the oncoming child. And how they want to make everything just right. Why is he referring to that? Because he's saying to those people, "Almighty God has prepared everything for you. He laid out every word." Do you realize the change of this body, the change of its atoms is already there in the word? It's already laying there and God's going to just anoint it at the right time and you'll take one more step. &gt;&gt; But you're taking a step right now. &gt;&gt; You're taking a step today. &gt;&gt; I announce to you, you are in an ascension already. &gt;&gt; You're a long ways from where you used to be. &gt;&gt; You're in an ascension now. And that's how he descended. &gt;&gt; He descended cuz the word said he must. &gt;&gt; The word said he must suffer. The word said he must go to a suppler. The word said all of those things. But the word also said that his body would not see corruption. &gt;&gt; And before he went there, he had confidence in that word as well. He had confidence in the word that said he must die. He must suffer. He must be put to shame. He had confidence in that word. But he had confidence in the next one also that said that his body shall not see corruption. &gt;&gt; And he knew he's going to come out of there. &gt;&gt; He He did He didn't just sit back home in Galilee and say, "Well, you know, Father, I know it's all been predestinated. It's just going to happen." And don't be deceived. doesn't happen that way. &gt;&gt; It happens from that fervent spirit, zealous spirit, holding and feasting on every word, hanging on to every word. &gt;&gt; You young men with the mind of God, don't waste it on all the stuff of the world and just trying to learn a whole bunch of stuff that's going to pass away. This that I'm telling you about will never pass away. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You want to leave here, folks. You don't want to be left for what? You don't want to be left here for what Satan's got in store. &gt;&gt; You just take this that you have. Take the Holy Spirit out. Take the bride out and multiply what's here. Turn it loose. &gt;&gt; It'll be rampant. &gt;&gt; You talk about same-sex marriage, that's just nothing &gt;&gt; compared to what's in store. &gt;&gt; All this pornography and the abuse of children. You think when our Lord Jesus said suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not. You think his mind has not changed about children, it has not changed one bit. And here they're killing these children and abusing these children. Things just hennious things that are taking place. You think God doesn't say that God's going to destroy this world for that? &gt;&gt; For what the law could not do, I'll just take another few minutes. I'm going to quit now. For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh. God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh. That's where he came like sinful flesh &gt;&gt; to to condemn sin in the flesh who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness by whose stripes we are healed. The type I want to leave this with you. The type and form of body is paramount in the first coming of Christ. Paramount because the body had to pay the sacrifice. In this coming there is no body to go. He has paid the price. And now what he has said and he concluded it with his prophet in his last few words. &gt;&gt; I go and I'm preparing a place for you. And if there's anything we ought to hear in the message, we certainly ought to hear those last comments, &gt;&gt; those last instructions. &gt;&gt; And if you know who was speaking &gt;&gt; then it will have the positive effect upon you. So I don't say, "Well, this is what brother Brandham said." No, I say 2,000 years hence from when he spoke it in the in up in a Passover chamber. &gt;&gt; 2,000 years later, he &gt;&gt; came back &gt;&gt; to manifest himself &gt;&gt; in a prophet, in a perfect ministry, and he proved who he was. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's sealing off that ministry and he's telling uh people that will hear it and he's putting it on a tape so that the that the children that are still to be born shall hear it &gt;&gt; and not mistake it &gt;&gt; go to prepare a place for you &gt;&gt; that where I am. &gt;&gt; We're not listening to something spoken 2,000 years ago. I was spoke here hear something spoken to this generation &gt;&gt; and to a people who can say I have been called and birthed under this very ministry &gt;&gt; which ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ in Luke 17:30 I've been birthed under the revealing of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and he told me &gt;&gt; he told me just before he would silence the lips that could speak it. I go to prepare a place for you that where I am, where he where he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You too will come there and be there. &gt;&gt; And it's so close. feels like I can reach out and just touch that other realm. If I took all the other things the sisters sang about the theophony, that theophony is right beside you. You say, "Well, that sounds spooky." Paul said, "If this body be dissolved, &gt;&gt; we have another." &gt;&gt; Not we will have. Do you believe it? Do you believe the Apostle Paul? &gt;&gt; We have another &gt;&gt; Aeonian eternal &gt;&gt; in the heavens. &gt;&gt; It's in the heavens. That's where heaven is. &gt;&gt; Not 150 million light years. It's another dimension. It's another realm. It's a faster one &gt;&gt; right beside you. &gt;&gt; And God is going to pull. You've had a yearning. You've had something calling you. And God will call someone to the pullpit because your body over there is calling for it. If we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. I haven't lost my thought. I have a picture. I wonder if the brothers can you show this picture, please. How many here know who that is? Let me see your hand. One, two, three, four. One is not too sure. He's going like this. I'll call him five anyway. Six. All right. I wonder if this person would come down here and join me a moment. Hope he didn't have to go home. He's coming. He just moves a little slower now than he used to. Deacons open the doors and let the man in. He's nervous, too, cuz he doesn't know what I'm going to do. I'll let you get even with me someday. Now we know who it is. Now here's a book up here. This fellow here, his knowledge of mechanics is pretty much zero. He doesn't know anything about mechanics. His knowledge of taking hold of a motor and tearing it apart and replacing parts and by the time he's done not having half of them left over and doing it right and seeing the thing drive out his knowledge there of that is just I think pretty close to zero. That'd be about right. This is one of his books. It's quite comprehensive. It's the fundamentals. And this man here, who once was this boy here, had to start going through here and learning how the crankshaft turned, learning how the gears in the cam shaft, and had to understand the engine components. And and as he studied this and as he moved through the pages of this, he actually ascended from a boy that couldn't make a living to a man that supports a family to a man that gets other people out of trouble. And only thing he could do it is take and literally devour this a page at a time. Did you have any trouble along the way? Some didn't understand it all first time. Did you ever fail a test? &gt;&gt; Probably. He doesn't remember. There are some things we blank out of our minds. We have other people here and I guarantee you they could only be transferred. It was a transferral. They get transferred from what they were to what they are. And I can tell you it depended very very much on the book. &gt;&gt; It depended on the book. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you do. It depends on the book. &gt;&gt; I can guarantee you. You might, you know, Brother Edwin Dodge was a flew a incredible jet. just sends chills on down my back when I see that uh uh monstrous machine that he flew as a jet with four nuclear bombs on it. And to think that that brother sits here, I admire him because I I look at that that you know his head you know gray but one day and he didn't get it by just getting and sitting in another seat and flying beside somebody and says well brother Edwin this is what you do. He wouldn't have said, "Brother Edwin, but captain, this is what you do. You pull this stick. You do that. You push all these buttons here all over the ceiling and all the rest of it." Got it? You're on your own. I tell you what, he'd have been on his own for sure. No, they study they study the winds and study this and study the atmosphere and this kind of cloud and that kind of cloud and and everything all about it and how to navigate and how to move and the engineering and how the system works, etc., etc. For those of you that were here at Brother Edwin got a citation from the from the president, I guess it was for for something very very ingenious that he didn't even learn in the book, but he was flying his jet and one of the engines caught on fire. And they put on put on the extinguishing system. Brother Randy, this should excite you. He put on the extinguishing system to put out the fire and the and the instrument said the fire's out. But there was something in him that caused him and I believe it was nothing less than God himself caused him. He changed the attitude of his plane and flew into the clouds because the engines cannot be seen from the cockpit and he wanted to make sure the instrument said the fire's out. But he flew into the clouds and saw in the reflection of the clouds that his plane was still on fire. And he took other measures and other extinguishing measures. And the and the citation that he got from the government said, "Captain Edwin Dods saved his plane and his crew and gave him a high award for that because he used something else." Now, that was something that wasn't in the book, but I can guarantee you he learned a big percentage of what he knows by going through a book. I've got another book. And they didn't. You don't just go to the end of the book and say, "Okay, now I think I'll do this first." A lot of people like to read the last chapter. &gt;&gt; They don't want all the work that goes in between. Tell you what, friends, we're not just last chapter people, but we we go through this book. &gt;&gt; This has got the mechanics and the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. God bless you. God bless you. From that to this. Maybe sometimes he wish he was that once again, but nevertheless, and we're going to go from here to the final even so &gt;&gt; come Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I trust that this mo this morning you'll be able to take these things as far as I got. Lord, helping me. I took a long time, &gt;&gt; but the purpose, the full purpose is so that you walk out of here and not putting the ascending or the ascension or the rapture up someplace as some future event. But it's important that you say, "I'm in it now. &gt;&gt; I'm in it now." And how you get higher is hearing the next word. But it wouldn't mean anything. Listen to this as I close. No, the key really is he says God you you have something in you and what he has said I want to say to this people today do you have just something in you it might be saying that's not exactly right you've talked to me about that or it might be oh God what a yearning I have what a thirst I Now what a hunger is laying here in my heart. And when you look at that, listen to me now. That isn't something that many times we think that this spiritual thing hunger came because we had a certain circumstances that happened around us and kind of created and we got melancholy and so on. It's not that. But it's when God when God himself begins to create within you that deep longing &gt;&gt; that you cannot escape. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That didn't happen because certain things happened around you. That was created because your body on the other side right not far from you is calling for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's calling for it &gt;&gt; and it is fulfilling the words of the Lord Jesus. I go to prepare a place for you. And if you have that desire, if you have it within you and you have had it, then you're one person that ought to say, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you, oh God. You created a wonderful place here and we created this for us." Mountains. Some people like mountains, plains. Some people like the plains, the deserts, whatever more. He created it for you so you could enjoy it. Just think, what will it be when we get over yonder? Father, it's hard to quit. It's hard to stop talking about the place that I feel is so near to us. Oh God, let this not be a day like other days, and let not the coming days be as the last week, but let the people I pray, Father, you'll make them, even as I have been so conscious, eating and partaking of what you have laid down. And uh some of the last things, Lord, surely it must have been so significant, so significant that you would inspire, prompt, and guide the very words that were to be left for us, Lord. And how it quickens the word and makes it alive to us. Father, I pray that you'll grant that for each of the people that are listening today. Bless this day immensely and the day we have a time of refreshment and rest and we'll come back this evening. Oh God, do anoint dear Lord the service and our brother Lance as he delivers his word, the word that you've given him and his soul in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Let's stand, shall we? What will it be when we get over here? What will it be when we over yonder sea. We'll join our loved ones at Crown Christ forever. Oh, this is just what heaven means to me. What will it be? What will it be when we get over yonder and &gt;&gt; the glassy sea and we [Music] forever. Oh, this is just what heaven means to me. &gt;&gt; We just had July 1st, which is called Canada Day, and tomorrow is July 4th. This is Memorial Day, I believe. And and the people become very patriotic and fly flags and sing their anthem, and that's all good. I think people should be loyal, patriotic, so on. But we have another land. &gt;&gt; We have another city. We have another country. We have another citizenship. And I think whenever we sing, the song leader has us lead in song. We sing and worship to him. See this one who's called you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends, I'm just ready to burst. &gt;&gt; I feel like this old these bars of bone got to burst open. &gt;&gt; Why? because I've been feeding on the word. &gt;&gt; Feeding on the next word, brother David. Feeding on the next word. Feed on it, my friends. Feed on it. It's an ascending word. You'll never believe this message and go in a descent. &gt;&gt; You'll never believe this message and go into a tail spin. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Only one way. It's up. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, friends? Sing it then for me. What will it be when we get over young? [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is a promise now. We'll join our loved ones hands forever. Oh. This ain't just what heaven means to me. Hallelujah. Father, as the people depart this place and ponder these things and hold it in their heart, I ask, oh God, that the Holy Spirit will make it such a reality. and father kind he heavenly father who has brought us here to this time let us not be weary and welloing &gt;&gt; I want to pray for each one and you that might have something pulling strong within you may want to just lift up your heart open up your heart lift up your hand oh God it's me it's me see me Just now look down. See this great thirst I have. Oh God, let the people know the shortity. There is one just beyond this little transparent curtain of time. A body you have prepared. A mansion. Not one that'll get old. Oh God, not one that's got to struggle through the teenage years, but one that is in the perfection as you saw us in the first place. And that's how it will be. And how your messenger said we'll live together. And I say amen. And one that we we will work together, we'll live together, we'll be happy. And I said, amen. Take away the heaviness, oh God. Take away the discouragement, oh God. Take away the depression, oh God. those things that come from this life and this world, take it away. &gt;&gt; May the people live with that joy and anticipation. Send us from this place with our hearts filled and let us be fulfilled, oh God, in this life. We want to be faithful to you. Bring us back now, Lord, in just a short while. We hear this service this evening. Let no one miss, oh God, what you have for us. In the name of Jesus Christ, dismiss us now we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. I'm dismissing you. The name of Jesus Christ. I pray that you'll have a a little rest. Don't wear yourself out this afternoon. Come back fresh for the evening service 5:00. God bless you. [Music] Thank you. [Music]
