TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] But give me Jesus to take his me. [Music] I want her. I want her back. [Music] [Music] He He's passing this way. He's passing this way. So lift up your hands. Lift up your voice. Hosana's reign. It's not just a story we all know. It's not just a distant future hope, but the King of all kings right here and today is passing this way. &gt;&gt; I wasn't there. [Music] when the shikina fell or when the angels swept down to trouble the well. But my heart doesn't dream. For I truly believe that the very same God right here and today is passing this way. He's passing this way. He's passing this way. So lift up your hands. Lift up your voice. It's not just a story we all know. It's not just a distant future hope. But the King of all kings right here and today is passing this way. Just like I'm going to hear the sermon preached on the mount. Just like I'm coming to hear the prophet call my name out. I've come here expecting. I've come to receive. And the same pillar of fire is here. I believe he's passing this way. He's passing this way. So, lift up your hands. Lift up your voice. Hold at a place. It's not just a story we all know. It's not just a distant future hope. But the king of all kings right here and today is passing this way. Sing hosana. Sing hosana. Sing hosana to the king. Sing hosana. Sing hosana. Sing hosana to the king. He's passing this way. He's passing this way. So lift up your hands. Lift up your voice. Hold. It's not just a story we all know. It's not just a distant future hope. But the King of all kings right here and today is passing this way. It's not just a story we all know. It's not just a distant future home. [Music] But the king of all kings right here and today &gt;&gt; is passing this way. &gt;&gt; This way. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Let's sing. Think about his love. Think about his goodness. Let's turn to the word. Think about his love. Oh, think about his goodness. [Music] I [Music] for [Music] me. Glor. [Music] Oh, think about his love. [Music] Think about [Music] his eyes. [Music] So great. Oh my god. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Great. [Music] It's &gt;&gt; measurless. &gt;&gt; Boundless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful to have you all here this morning and all who are live streaming or will stream the service. We say God bless you each one and uh we're expecting great things from him. Uh the devil's a great adversary. He's a good adversary. &gt;&gt; Uh but greater is he that's in you &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; And that'll be almost some of the focus uh in this morning's service as well. Uh we're just really thankful for what the Lord is doing day by day. It's marvelous just to sit on the sidelines and watch him work. Uh he never tires. &gt;&gt; He never sleeps. He's always true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We fail. He never fails. &gt;&gt; Our words fail. His words never fail. We don't quite live up to all of our promises, but he lives up to everyone. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to have you stand and excuse me, just before we read scripture, I want to sing that chorus. All that I have and all that I am and all that I ever can be. And I'd like you to lift your voice and from your heart. Sing it as a prayer of worship to God with all the meaning that you can muster within yourself. All that I have and all that I am. All that I am. All I am. All I shall never [Music] [Applause] [Music] surrender to thee once again. Heat. Heat. I shall ever [Music] surrender to thee. [Applause] Oh, we love you, Lord. We want to stand as uh as individuals and stand as a company of people today. &gt;&gt; We want to give you our deepest thanks, our appreciation, our worship. Receive, oh God, as we worship you in spirit and in truth. We want now, Lord, to come to the word and worship you in truth. And let that sharp two-edged sword just sever anything of the world that would hinder us, oh God. Anything of self, anything of our complexes, Lord. Anything that we would have of any question or doubt, sever it from us. Remove it from us, oh Lord. And I pray that you will brood and breathe upon us, oh God. May it be felt in every room, in every place, Lord. Father, where the service today is going, let your spirit and word penetrate our hearts with the changing, transforming power of the Holy Spirit. We trust you, Lord. These are your sheep, the sheep of your fold. You bought them, Lord. You've bought us. We are your purchase. You have redeemed us. The debt has been paid and Satan has no claim on your people. Pray that you'll heal the sick, deliver the bound, oh God, and do all manner of glorious things that your name may be praised and glorified in Jesus Christ's name. Now Lord, as I stand here at the post of duty, I pray that you will take my lips and use them as a tool, the hearts and minds of the people to be surrendered to you completely and take full control in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory. Amen. Amen. We're conscious this morning of the many that are uh actually joined with us here in service and and it's really a a blessed thing. I hear from them regularly on emails and this last this last week uh there was nine under to 300 over 270 other locations that were live streaming the service. And within about three or four days, there was another 433 not individuals locations that were had uh had streamed the service. And uh so you know this is not a man's doing. This is not our doing. This is just God's doing. And we just want to be what we're supposed to be. And everybody contributes uh their own part. And that's that's that's what is wonderful that God allows us to have a part. Amen. So I want to thank you for your uh not only physical support, your financial support, your emotional support, your words of encouragement, and your spirit of unity. It's a powerful force. Just a powerful force. And we want to I want to express my thanks on behalf of God to you because I know it's pleasing in God's sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to follow along in the scripture, turn to uh Romans the 9th chapter and we're going to be reading from the 8th verse. For those of you that were here last Wednesday, uh it will be a benefit I believe to you to have had that service starting with verse 8. That is that which are children of the flesh. These are not the children of God. But the children of the promise are counted for the seed. For this is the word of promise. At this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son. Not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac, for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand. not of works, but of him that calleth. It was said unto her, "The elder shall serve the younger." As it is written, Jacob have I loved, and but Esau have I hated. What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For for he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runth but of God that showeth mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And turn quickly if you would please to John's gospel the sixth chapter while we read the verses we read on Wednesday as well. John 6 and we're reading from verse 26 down through verse 29. Jesus answered them and said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, you seek me not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled. Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, whom the Son of man shall give unto you, for whom hath for him hath God the Father sealed. Then said they unto him, What shall we do that we might work the works of God? And Jesus answered and said unto him, unto them rather, "This is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats. This is the work of God. This is the work of God. that can be taken a a number of ways. This is the labor that God does. This is God's labor and I'll touch on that. And this is what God would have us do. This is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent. There's a lot of activity today around uh in religious matters. Lot of activity. people wanting to do something for God. And the thing that we could best do for God is believe on him whom God hath sent. &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of people think that's just believing on Jesus Christ. That's not so. Uh in the Old Testament, Moses reflected Jesus Christ. He was a part of Jesus Christ in that he reflected Christ and they in that day had to believe on him. &gt;&gt; That's just clear and simple. Had to believe all the way through the scriptures. And so we will enlarge on that. And the apostle Paul said clearly that I had to believe on him as he followed Christ so follow him. So there's a believing on on him that God hath sent and uh that uh that is to be enlarged on as we go along. Apostle Paul in the first uh scriptures which we read he said that uh that in uh verse 11 of uh Romans 9 says for the children uh being not yet born neither having done any good or evil thing that the purpose of God according to election that God's purpose the purpose that he has and that purpose is according to election ction and the that election is uh very interesting and I'm going to just show it to you here on the slide. Uh it was uh it is the one before that I'm sorry. All right. Election. The act of picking out or choosing the act of God's free will by which before the foundation of the world he decreed his blessings to certain persons. The decree made from choice by which he determined to bless certain persons through Christ by grace. And we hear a great deal about a man's free will, our free will. You know, if we could see ourselves alongside of God, we just fail fade off into absolute insignificance. &gt;&gt; Uh we shouldn't even talk about our free will till we think first about God's free will. &gt;&gt; God has a choice in things. And the Bible is clear that God chooses to use whomsoever he uses. He chooses actually to save. And the Bible even tells us that that uh those that believed. Those were the ones that had already been called. &gt;&gt; They already been called of God. And I know that you understand that. But the act of God's free will by which before the foundation of the world, he decreed his blessings to certain persons. The decree made from choice by which he determined to bless certain persons through Christ by grace. This is God's choosing. And God anoints whom he will, sends whom he will, talents whom he will, and he raises them up whom he will, and he puts down whom he will. And it's all God's doing. He's the absolute sovereign God &gt;&gt; and there's none beside him. There isn't a whole lot of gods and other religions and they see God this way, that way. You know, it's uh uh there's only one God, one creator, one eternal God. And to believe on him whom God has sent. And the Bible tells us also that the word of God comes to his prophets. I I just want to take you through a little quick process in about four points because this is kind of a summary of where we're going. The word of God comes to the prophet in its season. &gt;&gt; Secondly, the elect believe the sign and the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Number three, then the life and the character of God because it's not the man's words. &gt;&gt; The life and character of God then is transmitted transferred &gt;&gt; to the believer and that's the elected one. is transmitted to them. And now the believer has the life of God by the word of God through the channel of God in them. &gt;&gt; And now it is Christ in the person, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Christ in the person. We can then say, "Greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world." Now, anyone can read that scripture. Anyone can quote that scripture and it's very common. Greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world. No, not not so only if you have heard him whom God hath sent. &gt;&gt; Because that is the that is the channel through which that the the the very thing that is carrying the nature and the character of God. There's only one way to obtain it. &gt;&gt; There isn't a whole multitude of ways. It's not all roads lead to Chicago. &gt;&gt; This is one way. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's way &gt;&gt; and that's the only way that it can be had. God chooses whom he will. &gt;&gt; He endures them and he sends them and he gives them his word. &gt;&gt; Then he also elects those that will hear that voice. As Jesus said, "My sheep &gt;&gt; hear my voice &gt;&gt; and another they will not follow." Which simply means there's other voices. my sheep. As Jesus said, I have chosen you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You've not chosen me, but I have chosen you. And we'll read those scriptures perhaps a little later on. And so now then Jesus is saying to believe on him whom he hath sent. I have that scripture for you. Jesus answered and said unto them, "This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he hath sent." &gt;&gt; The work of God, we can call it a real labor of grace. A real labor of grace to get us to believe. I think God has a I think that's probably one of the uh probably one of the greatest things that God has to work on &gt;&gt; on us as individuals to get us to believe. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's so simple to believe, but other times it's so difficult to believe. As I've said before, uh when we try so hard to have faith or we think we have faith and uh doesn't seem to be there and then the next time it it seems like it's almost effortless, you've just accepted something and uh and God just does it almost does it and takes you by surprise because you've believed and it just happens and say my and we shouldn't be surprised at that. In the message Jehovah Gyra, brother Brandham said this. God sends someone that people can have confidence as a point of contact to contact him. We're thankful for a father like that, aren't we? Children, he asks all of us. Loving and kind, trying to do everything that lays within his power. Now, speaking of God, trying to do everything that lays within his power to get us to believe and to accept him on his term of love. &gt;&gt; I'd say that's a kind heavenly father. &gt;&gt; He hasn't wearied. He's doing it this morning &gt;&gt; in this service. He's doing it in your life, &gt;&gt; doing everything that he can. &gt;&gt; Amen. to get us to believe. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says he'll send us gifts and he'll send his servants and he sends everything that he can and he'll send something else and he'll send something more and greater and and more intense to get us to believe. Say, God help us to believe. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says this is the work of God in the Greek urggon. This is the work of God or in other words this is the labor of God. I said I would like to look at that two ways and brother Brandham has just referred to it now. This is a God does everything that he can. In other words, he he labors if we can use in that sense. So you can just see it. And that word also is that's what he's occupied with also. It has reference to us is I used it on Wednesday. That's what this is the work of God. This is what we should be occupied with. Believing on him whom God hath sent. &gt;&gt; And you just have to determine who that is. &gt;&gt; Believe on him whom God hath sent. &gt;&gt; And I don't want you to just isolate, you know, any one single person at this time. But to believe on him whom God has sent. God may you know in a home &gt;&gt; I think that a husband wife should recognize and it would do us a whole lot of good to realize God has sent my partner to me &gt;&gt; God has sent this one to me &gt;&gt; and I recognize that and I claim all the benefits of almighty God &gt;&gt; I don't care where that partner is today but we claim that &gt;&gt; God have sent you shouldn't be in this church if you don't feel God has sent you here &gt;&gt; and I shouldn't be behind this pulpit if I don't feel God sent me here. &gt;&gt; It gets down to that. &gt;&gt; And you're sent to where you are and where you're working. You're sent. You're a messenger to somebody. You're there to influence somebody. It gets down to the personal level. And we believe that God sent all the saints down through the ages and the apostles and the kings and the disciples. They were sent men. When Jesus came, he called certain individuals. He didn't just make a mass call and say, "Whoever would like to come and follow me, stand up." That isn't what he did. As he traveled and as he walked, he said to Peter, to James, to John, to Andrew, to Philillip, to to Matthew, he called his disciples to come and be a part of of his ministry at that time. And so God labors. I just want to I I want to dwell on that for just a a moment. It's not what necessarily what we believe just at this moment. &gt;&gt; But the question I would like to ask and I just pose it. What is it that God would like us to believe? &gt;&gt; What would God like you to believe this morning? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We might be saying, "Well, uh uh I I'm I'm believing for something. I just really need something. I I need, you know, I need a different job or I need I I need some uh I need my income looked after. I need this. I've got some physical things. I got some uh you know, physical things uh in my family, my children, whatever more. My wife, my husband, we just need this healing." Maybe we ought to get our mind off of that just for a moment. And I would encourage you to say, "God, what do you want me to believe? Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it that you're presenting to me? &gt;&gt; And give me a heart to believe that &gt;&gt; this is the work of God. So, we should ask him what it is that he would have us to believe. Now, uh I have a slide here also. out of a message. Ephesians parallels Joshua. Now, brother Bram starts out. Now, who could doubt that? That's what Paul said. That's Paul's scripture. That's Paul's writing. That's what he taught his church. The church positionally before the foundation of the world. When God in his labor pain was bringing forth, bringing forth you knowing what you would do, he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife, to be a farmer, to be a preacher, to be a prophet, to be this or to be that. He placed you positionally. And I think we could say amen to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now I want you to uh I'd like to draw your attention to the words God in his labor pain. I'm talking about the work of God. Now God in his labor pain. You know that God strives. God deals. God is constantly bringing us into situations, facing us with things. And we may think this is a disaster. when in fact God is laboring to bring you to a certain place, seeking that you would believe, seeking that the inconsistencies in your life would be gone. He's seeking to build character in you. He's seeking to and he moves in close to you by the Holy Spirit with his presence and you become maybe emotionally involved and and maybe tears come to your eyes when God's God's trying to say, I I I wanted to go beyond tears. I wanted to go beyond good feeling. I wanted to go beyond just being happy. I wanted to go beyond just clapping our hands. I wanted to go beyond, oh, we're so blessed right today, but tomorrow it's something else. God's trying to bring his men and women to places of real character, sunship, as the prophet said, to bring you positionally. And it and and you as a father or or mothers as parents and you have uh your children and and you can see that they have a uh they have a capacity, they have an ability, they have something, oh, they could go so much further than they than they're going right now. And you you can see some objectives for them. and and you do everything in your power to to nurture that and put them in in in contact with the right kind of friends, the right kind of atmosphere. Bring them spiritually. Put the scripture. Maybe lay a Bible there. Buy them something for their birthday that they will you're doing everything. Make sure that they have a a tape or a message close by so they can feed on the word. Why? Because you know what will cultivate that. You know it's in them. You've claimed them. And what are you doing? You're laboring. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it a one-shot deal? No. No. You're laboring today. And you work tomorrow. And you work this year, next year, while they're in their childhood and up into their youth and into their teen years. Do you ever quit? You never quit. You're laboring to bring them forth into sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; That's what God does. This is the work of God. &gt;&gt; I just wanted you to see that part. God is working also. How that God has set some in the church through the labor pains. &gt;&gt; Amen. When a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world, believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was to Pentecost. how they groan and cry under the labor pains. But when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom of God, then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some apostles and some prophets, some teachers and some evangelists, some pastors and some evangelists. Then he's given uh then he's give into there speaking with tongues and interpretation of tongues and knowledge and wisdom and gifts of healing and all kinds of miracles that God has set some in the church through his labor pains. So I want to extend the labor pains not just uh in him bringing us individually but then it's a as a labor of him when he gives into the church apostles and prophets and pastors and teachers and evangelists. That's all part of his work, bringing in those that because he has a desire for building up and nurturing his uh sons and daughters into a place that he's trying to position them into their right rightful place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Believing on him whom he has sent initiates the process whereby the very life of Jesus Christ is transmitted into the individual. I want to say that again. I want you to memorize it if you need to. Believing on him whom he hath sent initiates the process the very whereby the very life of Jesus Christ is transmitted into the individual &gt;&gt; in natural life. You came here by a process. You came here by a process of of conception &gt;&gt; and uh through birth. And since you were born into this world, you have gone through a process of development uh of maturing. It's all a process. You have you that have uh entered into a marriage relationship, you surely know that's a process. And you didn't reach some point and say, "Wonderful, it's all over. We understand each other perfectly and we never have another question." No, you don't quite arrive there. Uh, you never arrive there. I'm discovering new things about my wife and we've been married almost 54 years. We just keep discovering. You say, "Is my is there that many uh, you know, things to learn?" Yeah. And probably we'll learn we learn a lot of things about you know our spiritual walk. We'll never learn it all down here. It's going to take eternity. &gt;&gt; And so that initiates the process. Our spiritual birth and our life is a process. The Bible says as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word doesn't end there. That you may grow thereby. It's a process. Desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby. Paul said in in his letter letters to the Colossians, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns." This is what individuals do. You're encouraging one another. You're teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and in hymns and in spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord. Let the Lord dwell in you richly. That's all part of it. And further in in Colossians 1:27, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you. It's not just a, you know, just a flash in the pan, something that happens. Oh, Christ's in me. No, it's a process. &gt;&gt; And the process is initiated. That's the beginning place by believing on him whom God hath sent. &gt;&gt; This gets very very serious. Anyone with an intelligence of reading can read the scripture, &gt;&gt; but if you don't believe on him whom God hath sent, there isn't even a starting spot. &gt;&gt; Bringing the literal life of Jesus Christ into a person is a process. Talking about the literal life. Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. It's a process and it has to start by believing on him. This Jesus said this. You know what the word this means? There's nothing on this end of it and there's nothing on this end of it. There's nothing before it and there's nothing after it. this &gt;&gt; maybe you heard one time I've related this a number of times but early in our ministry and had a radio broadcast and uh uh someone was questioning on the serpent's seed and so uh I like where Genesis the 5th chapter said this is the generations of at him. &gt;&gt; So I walked in the door and I said to one of the secretaries, I said, "Would you please go and get me the most most exhaustive and most definitive uh meaning of the word this?" And she said, "This?" I said, "Yeah, just do it." So she disappeared. She left the office and I was out for a while. came back in and she was sitting at her desk and I said, "Well, what'd you find out?" She said, "You know what? There's pages on the word this." I said, "Well, I haven't got time for pages. Haven't got a lot of time. Just tell me what it" She said, "Do you want to just in brief?" I said, "Yeah, just tell me conc precisely what it is." Well, she said this. There's nothing here and there's nothing on this end. This is it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I said that's good. This is the generations of Adam. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you read chapter five there, you can't find Cain there. He's not part of the generations of Adam because this is the generations of Adam. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm glad God means what he says &gt;&gt; and he says what he means. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the beginning place. Believing on him whom God has sent initiates the process whereby the very life of Jesus Christ is transmitted into the believer. I'm going perhaps laboriously but so you can take this and it's it's a much more effective when a person can read it and see it visually. You are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I want the the message also will encompass God's sovereign grace in choosing an individual especially those that are fulfilling I will say a major role in the plan of redemption. That's why when we read the scripture, you know, these aren't the only people God used, but these are the people God chose to be inserted in the cannon of scripture. And so that we have we have the principles laid down, how God chooses, how God speaks, how God broods, how he sends his Holy Spirit, how the people responded. And when we see it written in the scripture, we know that the unchanging God, that's the way he works. He may use a different scenario. He may use a different person. But God works the way he's worked in the Bible. God never changes his mind about how he does things. &gt;&gt; And he certainly never changed his mind about his work. So, especially those that are fulfilling a major role in the plan of redemption, then I want to have you think about the how he prepared the preparation of those individuals, the elected ones. And many times in uh in our lives and as we read in the scripture how God what he used to prepare his people, we never grasp it with human reasoning just never will. &gt;&gt; God uses a he works in strange and mysterious ways. But if we just will rem remain in one place and that is entirely open entirely surrendered when I say open I don't mean gullible &gt;&gt; but entirely open completely believing &gt;&gt; sincere not only sincere because sincerity won't do it but believing people say well I believe the Bible says believing on him whom God hath sent. &gt;&gt; I can assure you, unless people believed in Moses, they certainly weren't going to get out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; He was the one who had been sent at that time. And the prophet of God in this generation had been sent. Every me every messenger has been sent. And I believe that that that's that's critical. And then those people, there's the preparation of these men. Then there is the empowerment, we can say vindication and the message that God sent through them. We're just speaking yesterday. We had some guests at the house and and I I I want to be very uh precise this morning as just as precise as I can be. But brother Brandham says regarding and because at that time that he even spoke it, there was a a proliferation of all kinds of supernatural and miraculous things and people have it today. Oh, we're not talking just about healing. All kinds of healings and different things that take place. We're not talking about that. But he said this, if the sign if the sign doesn't have a voice that comes behind it, That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "You just forget it." &gt;&gt; So what what he's really saying is that there will be signs. There will be spectacular things. There will be things that would, you know, catch your attention. Said, don't pay any attention to it if there's not a voice coming behind it. If there isn't a message that comes behind it. And so I'm glad that we can say today that we have both of those that have united together. We had the supernatural and the phenomena and the voice that came behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then there are those that believe on him that God hath sent. They've followed this progression of events. They've identified perhaps perhaps we're attracted by the phenomena or the spectacular or supernatural. Even today, I'm I'm very very careful when I see people being attracted to what we might say, well, attracted to the message or attracted to the congregation or attracted I want to find out right away who or what they're attracted to. say, "Oh, I see people where I've walked into this church with a lot of people walk in says, "Oh," you know, they go up in the video room and see all the technology and says, "Oh, you you guys are, hey, you're connected. You're set up and all this." I don't let that phase me one bit. &gt;&gt; If you get a compliment, say, "Well, it's fine. Thank you." And then they maybe want to know something. What do you believe? And so forth. I'm very very cautious because I don't want to be asked what we believe because someone got impressed with the technology. &gt;&gt; I don't get into a big big a big subject about what we believe because someone someone says, you know, they got their belief and and maybe they look around say, "Hey, I wish we had young people like that." What do you believe? Well, I tread very carefully. I want to find out why do you want to know what I believe? &gt;&gt; Some handsome young fellas walk in here and look around. See these lovely young ladies and girls say, "H, what do you folks believe?" Said, "Never mind what we believe. Go hunting someplace else &gt;&gt; or vice versa. The Bible says, "Buried with him." Now, I'm I'm just putting throwing a lot out here, but I hope hope by God's grace to be able to pull it together in just a little bit. Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. And I want to focus for a moment on the operation of God. There's something that is God's doing. &gt;&gt; The operation of God. So this is something that this person has done. They conceived this. They laid it all out. They drew up the plans. This is their doing. Well, now I'm talking about something that's God's doing. &gt;&gt; This is God's operation. This is the operation of God and it starts by him choosing &gt;&gt; who he chooses. &gt;&gt; That's that's one of the first fundamentals. God chooses whom he will choose. In other words, he exercises his own free will. &gt;&gt; And as I said Wednesday, that is where the world becomes irritated. It become they become uncomfortable. Even perhaps as I'm speaking this, there may be a lot of people that they don't like that. So what about my choice? My right to receive Christ or my right to accept God. You could you only have that right if he chose first that you could do that. &gt;&gt; And that's a tough one for a lot of people. That happens to be the truth. And I've said to people uh often when they said well this business of predestination and so on and so forth and that God chooses and they don't want God to have the freedom to choose who will be his wife his bride &gt;&gt; but they want to have the right to choose who theirs is. &gt;&gt; Say you you want the right to choose your husband or your wife. You want that right and you don't allow God to have that right. Of course God has that right. He chooses whom. This is the operation of God. In other words, God is saying, "I'm going to become the operative here. &gt;&gt; I'm going to become the operative. I'm going to choose who I'm going to use. I'm going to choose what capacity they're used in. I'm going to gift them and talent them with whatever they have or whatever they don't have. And if they don't have it, that's the way I want it. I'm operating this thing. &gt;&gt; I'm operating this whole redemption plan. &gt;&gt; And it may be mysterious. So be it. And men can't understand it. They can't they can't figure it out by reading. And I'm going to just hide it and veil it in such in such mystery that it can only come ah let's see the operative is working. Uh how will it come? Oh, I'm going to send my Holy Spirit and I'm going to reveal it. But I'm going to put something within the individual, my elect. I've chosen to put something in them that will respond to my spirit. And they are predestinated to have that seed. And then one day along the way, I'm the operator. I'm the operative here. I'm going to bring them to a certain place in contact with a certain person to put a certain book or to have a certain voice that they will hear. and that and immediately that thing that's in them is going to spark to life. They're going to say, "This is for me." &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; those elected ones, they didn't have to be impressed. &gt;&gt; They didn't have to be impressed with a nice church or good people or anything else. They didn't have to be impressed. They heard the voice of the shepherd and the spark and the Holy Spirit struck light to the seed &gt;&gt; and that was it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's God's choosing. &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget that. &gt;&gt; We're coming down to little swimming water here in a few minutes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're believing believing on him that God has sent. The the God is the operator, the operation of God. So he sends whom he sends. And the scripture says, "And his word comes to the prophet. His word come to the prophet." He chose that a prophet would be the carrier of his word. He chose even in his labor pains. He brought forth in New Testament apostles and prophets and teachers and evangelists and pastors and and they were his gifts. Now I don't want you to separate for a moment. Don't separate the ministry from the person. They are one and the same. &gt;&gt; You can't separate the message from the messenger. &gt;&gt; They're one and the same. So the gift is actually the person. &gt;&gt; Him whom God hath sent. The gift whom God hath sent. God sent has sent some marvelous marvelous gifts to the world and he didn't wrap them up fancy. He didn't put nice ribbons and bows on them. Maybe just sent them ordinary workers, ordinary men and women, maybe with not a great education, disciples of Jesus Christ that couldn't sign their own name. They weren't wrapped up the way the world would like to have had him. Jesus was not presented the way the world would expect the Messiah to be presented. And then this generation, this gentile age, expecting Christ. Oh, if exactly a duplicate of what the Jews the Jews expected some carpet to come out of the sky, some rolling down and he's going to come and and the Messiah is going to come to the temple and walk and address the high priest in all of his robes and this is going to be a a spectacular event and said he was over some straw. &gt;&gt; And God was presenting greatest gift this world's ever seen. &gt;&gt; A lamb born in the stable. Amen. a man who was associated with the Galileans, who spoke a very flat and guttal language, not some beautiful melodic language, was kind of just short flat. associated him with that with the poor. &gt;&gt; That's what he was associated with. &gt;&gt; And that was not a a popular thing. Are you listening to me? &gt;&gt; But salvation came in the person of Jesus Christ. And I have called this message today the same as part two of him whom God hath sent. But the subject also this morning which I'm moving towards slowly the subject the person revealing the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. Luke 17:30 in the day when the son of man will be revealed. And I'm not changing the scripture, but for the purpose of the service this morning, I want you to be thinking the person in whom the son of man will be revealed. &gt;&gt; And you aren't going to get it any other way than the way God ordained it to be. You won't get it through any other channel than the one God ordained it to come through. It just won't happen. You can twist and turn and the world could agonize and have all kinds of nasty things. They had nasty things to say about Moses, the men of renown, the men that were gifted, the talented men. They had all kinds of things and raised up against Moses. They raised up against Samuel and rejected him and said, "Give us a king." And he told them all that would happen. He's going to tax you and he's going to take your young men. He's going to take them to war. They're going to fight. They're going to be killed. He's going to take your young women. No, we don't care anyway. We just want And he was rejected. And he mourned over it. Not that he was rejected. He mourned over what was going to happen. And God told him, you know, don't mourn anymore. They haven't rejected you. They rejected me. Who? &gt;&gt; They didn't reject you. They rejected me. They rejected God. &gt;&gt; Lost. They lost the concept &gt;&gt; that God was in this man. &gt;&gt; God was speaking to. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the creator of heavens and earth embodying himself in such a way so that you say, "Well, no, God was in Christ. God was also in Samuel. &gt;&gt; God was in Moses. &gt;&gt; That's why his face shone because his word was in Moses. in the person of God's chosen men or God's chosen people and I refer to Moses now and the Bible says this Moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge the same did God send to be a ruler ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Put yourselves all down in Egypt. Put yourselves all down in the in the mud pits of Egypt. Put yourselves all down under the under the whip of the cruel uh task masters. Put yourself there in your imagination. Put yourself there. And now here comes a man out of the wilderness. a shepherd for the last 40 years had murdered a man and all the rest of it. But God spoke to him and he came with vindication &gt;&gt; who I say sent me. Tell him I am has sent you &gt;&gt; and it became evident soon that God was with him. and you're down in the mud pits and your children and your families and whatever more and your your young people, your mothers and your fathers and you see them under steaming, under that heat and under that cruelty and no doubt would look up and say, "Oh God, where's the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? &gt;&gt; He's coming &gt;&gt; in a man, &gt;&gt; and there isn't another man. They're coming in this man." And deliverance of the people came in the person of Moses, &gt;&gt; not some other good people, not some other educated people. It came in the person. It says you got to get it and get it good. It came in God's choosing. &gt;&gt; That's who God chose. &gt;&gt; And if the people then say, "What can I do, Lord? What can I do? An hour has come. I see these great miracles. If if anybody had asked that, God would have said to them, "My work, I'm laboring now to get you to believe on him whom I have sent." &gt;&gt; That's my biggest chore right now. &gt;&gt; He would say, is to get the people to believe on him, &gt;&gt; whom God has sent. The Apostle Paul, I think of him now. I'm jumping around. The Apostle Paul, the person turning law to grace. &gt;&gt; That's why he said, "If anyone else come and preach another gospel &gt;&gt; than I have preached, &gt;&gt; let him be accursed." &gt;&gt; What kind of man is this? What kind of statement is that? Who does he put himself to be? He knew who he was. He knew that God had called him. God chose him. God elected him and God empowered him. God gave him the words and he knew he was writing those letters not from his education under Galia but by the revelation of Jesus Christ and he wrote those letters. &gt;&gt; And I can say the whole doctrine of turning law from from law to grace was in the person of Apostle Paul by the choosing of God. &gt;&gt; You might say are you elevating these people? I'm elevating them to the degree that God chose them &gt;&gt; and that God elevated them to. And God elevated him to a position that only one in that generation &gt;&gt; wasn't another one. It wasn't a whole group. &gt;&gt; One man &gt;&gt; the person Luther and now I just quote and just stay with me real close please. In modern events, one of the last messages brother Brandham spoke, he said talking about the church and how it had to die in the dark ages and then come back up. And he says it came forth in the person of Martin Luther, the reformation. And I found this a very astounding statement which actually has given rise to the last two services, the last Wednesday and this service. So if you want to know how God deals with me, here it is here that the church, he refers to it, the New Testament church, it had to die and it had to come forth so it could come forth in the reformation again. Then he stops. It came forth. Now he's talking about the reformation. It the reformation came forth in the person of the reformation Martin Luther. We are here today. We can say that justification by faith came forth out of the dark ages in the person of Martin Luther. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. See, it wasn't it wasn't the selection. They didn't have the cardinals and the pope making a selection. They didn't have they didn't even have the people say, "Well, you know, the people can vote and select on who it's going to be." I say, "Forget the people for a moment. It had to be God's choice." &gt;&gt; God chose that man. &gt;&gt; God endued him. God empowered him. God gave him a certain kind of a nature. He wasn't the kind of a person who was weak in his knees. He wasn't the kind of person who cowered. &gt;&gt; He was a kind of person who was absolutely sold and and convinced of his conviction in God. And I wish there were more people like that. &gt;&gt; Oh God, let us be men and women of conviction. &gt;&gt; Not opinionated, &gt;&gt; conviction &gt;&gt; of what God said, &gt;&gt; believing on him whom God has sent. And then he talks about just coming from a stock. And then he goes on in leadership, the last message ever preached as a message. This is not Luther's age. This is not Pentecostal age. This is the bride age. &gt;&gt; People in the message have trouble with that. I wish they would hear this service and simply catch these words. This is the work of God. Believe on him whom God has sent. &gt;&gt; And that's what he said. It's not Luther's age. And we can say amen. It's not a Pentecostal age seeing where Pentecost has gone. I have nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; This is the bride age. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; This is the bride age. &gt;&gt; And God sent to you a gift. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the gift that the people who sat around thought it was, "Oh, he's got the gift of the word of wisdom." Such nonsense. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's got the gift of healing. Not that at all. It was the sign of God's choosing. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; What does it mean to you today? Say to hear the words. &gt;&gt; That's not that's my voice, but that's not me speaking. &gt;&gt; And you can say who's speaking, thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God, you mean you have a vessel? &gt;&gt; Say, wow. Everybody can say that. Go ahead and say it &gt;&gt; and say something prophetic and see what happens. &gt;&gt; I like what brother Gunther said. Oh, he said, "You don't believe the seals are open. You don't want to believe that." He said, "You know, why don't you go off and why don't you go off into Arizona? Why don't you go stand in the desert and see what happens?" &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Hot sun. &gt;&gt; You go stand there. But I know one that was chosen to go stand there and seven angels come, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, and thunder out of the sky and a cloud with the head of Jesus Christ. You go and do it &gt;&gt; and see what happens. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's choosing. &gt;&gt; Now I turn it around. Say, what does that mean to us? Oh, how I thank you Lord Jesus that this is in your revealing that you chose a man in whom the revealing could take place and remain humble. &gt;&gt; Remain in utter humility. &gt;&gt; Remain kind &gt;&gt; and yet unairring with the word, &gt;&gt; uncompromising with the word. So the word could come down to us unadulterated. You think I don't have something to preach about? We have something to preach about, friends. &gt;&gt; And you need to be really thankful. I want to try to generate within your heart a thanksgiving &gt;&gt; to the message that came and the messenger that came that God sent. The thanksgiving goes to God. &gt;&gt; You didn't send yourself. William Brandham didn't send himself. Luther didn't send himself. These men were sent of God. And as I said Wednesday, to try to circumvent the one that God sent is to say to God, uh, you made the wrong choice. You chose the wrong person. You didn't really endure him sufficiently. At least he didn't convince me. You're circumventing God's chosen one. &gt;&gt; And they circumvented Moses. They circumvented Elijah. They circumvented Daniel. They circumvented David. They circumvented Apostle Paul. &gt;&gt; They went around them, &gt;&gt; but they're not in the record, &gt;&gt; they vanished off the scene. &gt;&gt; But then those that believed on him who God has sent. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what's happening? Let me speak to you directly. Do you understand what's happening? You are reversing the whole process by believing him whom God hath sent who has the words of God in his mouth. By believing on him, you are reversing what your great four mama did. Eve. &gt;&gt; She refused what God had sent. &gt;&gt; She refused and denied the word and listened to reasoning. But now there's a people on the earth that are believing the message that has come and literally reversing the process. &gt;&gt; We're here today &gt;&gt; reversing the process. God has empowered us to reverse the process that started in Eden. &gt;&gt; And by her decision, death came. And by our decision, by God's choosing, life has come. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now to refuse that person that's doing the calling, Christ," see how he puts it. Now to refuse that person who's doing the calling Christ, no matter if you're Pentecostal, Methodist, Luther, whatever you are, you go to, he said, this age, nothing against them. Not at all. Isn't that kind? But in this age now, you've got to accept like they did in that age, the person of Christ, which is the word. &gt;&gt; And the word comes to The word comes to &gt;&gt; Christ comes to &gt;&gt; who did Christ come to when the word when when the prophet and former John the Baptist standing in the water and Jesus John didn't go and find Christ. Christ the word came to him. &gt;&gt; That's the pattern. &gt;&gt; That's the principle and that's always the principle. Moses and Moses didn't go hunting for the bush. The bush attracted him. God came to him. God came to Elijah. God came to Elisha. And even before, he said to Jeremiah, "Before you were born, &gt;&gt; before you were conceived in your mother's womb, I chose you." I'm looking down this congregation right now and I can say to you as a people of individuals, I want you to think about your own life, before your father came to your mother, and before that sperm was even lodged in her womb, God chose exactly which germ would be conceived &gt;&gt; and bring you into this life &gt;&gt; because God had a plan. &gt;&gt; God had a choice. &gt;&gt; And you're not sitting here by your choice. &gt;&gt; You're sitting here by God Almighty's choice. &gt;&gt; His choice. He knew every footstep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see you come from many, many different places and even different countries and you sat and maybe wrestled with it and said, "Oh my, what am I going to do? how what God I don't know why God attracts and brings a certain people together in a certain way, but it's it's in God's choosing. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's God's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You people here from so many many different countries and see you, Sister Lesanne, God knew exactly what was going to happen. &gt;&gt; You that here from the Congo, God knew. and from China. Think of Murphy. Brother Murphy that's up there right now behind the window. A nerve center for China translating what I'm saying right now. And he and he, for those of you that don't know, he sang in a certain choir. And the choir, the government church, Three Self Church there in China, which doesn't really have any any any belief of any kind, but he sang in the choir. And there was a a brother that was a leading that choir. And then they didn't see each other for years. And by a series of supernatural events, Brother Murphy got he got his visa to come to Canada to immigrate to Canada. And he thought he would go and see his old choir leader as he's leaving. And as they're speaking together, he finds out the choir leader doesn't believe because he didn't really have any belief, but he's got a whole new a whole new belief now. starts speaking to him about baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Brother Murphy wants to know where well my you know he could say it where can I be baptized because I'm leaving. He and his young wife we're leaving. He said well they were on their way to Toronto to set up a business. Had the plan all in place. Had the money in place. Had everything in place on their way to Toronto to set up a business. He said his his old friend said, "Well, stop in Vancouver. your plane will stop in Vancouver and and there's a a man there that we know there's a church there and they will baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He stopped here went into that tank and went up to that office. &gt;&gt; Been here ever since. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What does that accident? &gt;&gt; That's by God's choosing. &gt;&gt; God chose. &gt;&gt; I want you to see God chose. Actually, in the mind of God, he knew before the foundation of the world, you're going to be sitting right where you're sitting today. He knew exactly what I was going to be saying. He knew exactly what was going to be going on in your heart cuz he chose it to happen. &gt;&gt; He ordained it to happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I could do a dance. &gt;&gt; I'm so enthused and enthralled with my Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said you must accept the person. To refuse the person is to refuse Christ. And then he ends up that paragraph in leadership. You must accept the person of eternal life. The message, he that is in you. I I'm going to just close it a little bit, but I have to I have to make a wee bit of distance. Help me out. &gt;&gt; He said, if if we could only receive this truth, all your attention, please. If we could only receive this truth, if we could only realize what this scripture means, he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; He said, we can't understand that. Yet we say we believe it, and you is greater than he that's in the world. And we know that it's true, but we really don't understand it. Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. What is in you? This isn't a little sermon. Now, this is prophet's words to you quoting out of the scripture. What is in you? He said, he asked the question, what is in you that's greater? It's Christ. It's the anointed. God that was in Christ is in you. Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Then, and here I have it highlighted, so it must be highlighted for you. Then if he is in you, it's not you anymore living. &gt;&gt; It's him living in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not your thinking &gt;&gt; and what you would think about this. It's what he said about it. &gt;&gt; Then if he's in you, he absolutely would not deny what he said. &gt;&gt; If he's in you, he would not deny what he said. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's trying to find that person now. I'm trying to bring something to you. And when I sit in my study and naturally have many more hours than perhaps you do to hear and to absorb and to ponder the message, it's just like it is in the scripture. A prophet will take uh he'll take a scripture and he'll begin to expound and ext expand on it like he's doing right here. And then he just inserts a line and that line has reference to what he was saying but he extends the reference and in this and in many cases it becomes singular from the plural to the singular from the whole congregation to the one &gt;&gt; and I'll just read it now for you. Then if he's in you, he would absolutely absolutely would not deny what he said. He couldn't do it. But he would keep what he said. He would he would keep what he has said. And he's trying to find that person that he can vindicate himself through. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now friends, he was saying that because the believers who believed the message knew that he was that person that God was vindicating. &gt;&gt; There isn't anybody here, there isn't any minister I know, there isn't any other minister I've ever heard that stood at a pullpit, not once, but over and over and over again, said it to the world. Now, if he doesn't come &gt;&gt; and prove what I've said as being the truth, then I am a false prophet. &gt;&gt; Just a just plain I don't have that courage. My my highest calling would be to repeat and to echo &gt;&gt; what he whom God hath sent has said. Amen. &gt;&gt; And your greatest honor is to be able to believe &gt;&gt; on him whom God sent. I don't care what kind of a problem you have. &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of a at what station you are in life. This message has the answer for it. &gt;&gt; Absolutely has the answer for it. &gt;&gt; I was just relating last night and I'm sure It will be all right. I never forget the day Sister Janet Maloney came and stood right here and the police force who her husband was a part of the RCMP were going to be engaged in the next few hours in a 12week standoff with the native population at Gustoson Lake. And you can read about it. And it was a completely secretive affair. And the thing became so delicate they even called in military vehicles to go in essentially on the to to conquer this situation. And she sat she stood right here. and and I repeated it last night in testimony and I'm repeating it to you and Sister Janet, I saw a woman of faith. I saw as it was a woman out of the Old Testament or the scriptures and you looked straight ahead and said, "Brother Ed, they're going in tomorrow morning." And I'm standing here to pray and want you to pray that none of those men will be killed and none will be wounded. And I didn't know how many men, but that's what she said. And she said, "Those policemen have wives and have children." And I said, "According to your faith, they both sit here." Brother, brother Shawn, Sister Janet, and we prayed, had a simple prayer. It wasn't me. It wasn't the prayer. It was her faith. And that was 12 weeks from that time. 12 weeks. I think it would be all right, Brother Sean, because it's become public knowledge. They counted over 6,000 rounds of ammunition that had been fired at the place. 6,000 rounds by marksmen with very good weapons over a period of 12 weeks. I'm here to tell you, you read in the Bible, you read in the book of Acts, I'm going to tell you this is the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; Not one police was wounded &gt;&gt; and not one policeman was killed. and they can say all they wish to say about the newspapers and everything else. I'll tell you about what's written in heaven. &gt;&gt; There was a woman who heard him whom God hath sent &gt;&gt; and her faith was anchored in that God &gt;&gt; and spoke the confession of her mouth. And I would like anybody here or anybody in Canada to explain to me how 6,000 rounds, more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition are fired with men with accurate weapons and men who make their living hunting. &gt;&gt; And not one is wounded or slain. I say God and you people ought to be privileged. You're the only people that can fully understand that. &gt;&gt; We live in it. We're living in a miracle. &gt;&gt; We're seeing it all the time. &gt;&gt; This message has the answer &gt;&gt; to this generation for your families, for your children. Greater is he that's in you than he that's binding the son or the daughter or the husband or the wife. Greater is he that's in you. slip ahead because there's something I want to come to. &gt;&gt; Do I have your attention? &gt;&gt; In this mind of God at an appointed time, he said, "Let us make man. And we'd have to go in the scripture which we don't have the time to what was in his mind when he said let's make him. And then last Wednesday just brought out how God made Adam. It was Adam and then God chose Noah. God chose Abram who became Abraham. and out from his seed. It's not the children after the flesh, but the children of promise because he had Ishmael and others as well. But out came the son of promise, Isaac, and it was to be Abraham and Isaac. And God chose Jacob, Esau. Jacob I loved, Esau I hated. Don't try to wrestle with it. That's what that's what God's messenger said. &gt;&gt; That's what the Apostle Paul said. Don't wrestle with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's God's free will. God chose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't think for a second it's unfair. &gt;&gt; God chose that. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to it? &gt;&gt; That's God's choosing. So he chose Abraham. He chose Isaac. He chose Jacob. He chose Joseph to fulfill their role in life. He chose these individuals. It was his choosing. And then out from them comes a people. And of all the peoples and tribes and nations and so on, God chose Israel. You know, Israel's had so much trouble. And the elect of God are not are not guaranteed that you're not going to have trouble. You know, we had a Jewish lady say to us, an Orthodox Jewish lady from Israel. You know, she said to us, "How can we become unchosen?" &gt;&gt; In other words, how can we get rid of all this trouble? &gt;&gt; How can we get rid of being hated? How can we get rid of all of this animosity in the world? How can we become unchosen? &gt;&gt; Well, quite frankly, there's no way to become unchosen. And I thank God, whatever comes, let it come. We don't want to be unchosen. We want to be the chosen. &gt;&gt; And then God began to build with out of the foundation. I just go quickly because I've got to I got to have about five minutes to conclude this now. And and and I described out of the foundations of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, he began to build men. And because it was the word that was going to come in its fullness, these men had to be part of the word. And so a prophet actually had like a dual purpose, had like a dual ministry. He would prophesy to the people that were there. And yet he lived out part of the word and also prophesied about that which was yet to come because his life reflected the greater meaning in Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me that far? So he had a dual purpose. And so but when they lived it, and here's what I want you to see now. When they lived it and they lived out their portion, then that was laid down. That was done. And then that was fulfilled. That part of Christ's coming was over. And it kept that way all the way down. And then finally, finally one would come Malachi 3 and he'd say, "Behold, I send my messenger before thy face to prepare the way before thy face and begin to describe John the Baptist." And then Malachi laid that down and that just remained a finished part until then John would come. and Malachi 4 and speaking of Christ and his first coming and second coming. And when it was done, it was all laid down. It was 400 years of silence. Then rises one comes out of the womb of Mary. And she also had to say what she said. And everything, all those segments of Christ were now embodied in this one. And he became the fullness. And he was the fullness of all things that had been and the fullness of all things that would be. &gt;&gt; Right? And he's standing here saying looking back, when you see the days of Noah again, and when you see the days of Sodom again, even thus shall it be when the Son of Man will be revealed &gt;&gt; and laid it down. And then he ascended, blessed the church, and the church was born. And now we didn't understand that. Then a prophet comes and says, "But that like the husband, the bride had to die, and she went into the dark ages and came out in the person of Luther and justification and sanctification in the person of Wesley and the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the and the Pentecost." And he doesn't refer to a person. But then came the day of this age of his revealing. And now he has to have a selected one, a person who he will reveal himself through. And because he was a prophet as a son of man, this man must be a prophet. He cannot be a reformer. He must be a prophet &gt;&gt; because the son of man is a prophet. So he has to come with that. And because he came out of nowhere, he came without an education. He has to come without an education. Because he spoke the language of the lowly, he has to speak the language of the lowly. He has to speak the hints and the canaints and the was and the comes and the born again. He has to speak that because that's going to stumble some people &gt;&gt; and other people. That's not the issue. Right? &gt;&gt; The issue is what is being said and the issue is who's moving me and the issue is who's speaking to me. &gt;&gt; And the learned and the educated and and the theologians and the great people just, oh, that's just going to pass away. This is just like, you know, this is kind of a bad dream. This isn't going to amount to anything. Oh, who could follow that? &gt;&gt; And it just gathered. And the people that it gathered, it gathered them from the streets. It gathered them from the homeless. It gathered them from the death beds. It gathered them from the wealthy. It gathered them from presidents. It gathered them from all kinds of professional. It gathered them from workplaces. It gathered them as children. It gathered them and begin to gather them. And all of those who said, "It's going to pass away. This thing is just like a bad dream. This thing's going to pass away. Who's going to follow that? Listening to a bunch of dead men's tapes and all kinds of nasty things that they could say. Oh, he went off in the end and they just fought and they just nasted at it with their teeth and went against it. And in in in spite of that, it just kept to grow. It kept to grow. And the people that were denying it couldn't help but look on and secretly in their heart kind of wish they could live that kind of life. Wish that they could have that kind of victory. Wish that their young people were that kind of young people. Wish their wives were those kind of wives. Wish their wife wish their young ladies were those kind of young ladies. And they didn't realize it was a choice of almighty God. &gt;&gt; It was the consequence of hearing him whom God has sent. &gt;&gt; And if you're here in some other church, some other denomination, and you look around and you have to admit within yourself, within the honest of your own heart, say they got something I haven't got, then you need to ask yourself, why don't you have it? It's plain and simple. &gt;&gt; You've not heard &gt;&gt; him whom God hath sent. &gt;&gt; And the people within the message maybe don't have exactly what you ought to have. I say you need to hear. &gt;&gt; And by hearing is doing. &gt;&gt; It's not just having it go in one ear and out the other. It's not just going and having it tickle you over a service and say, "Well, that was a good service. That's not it." You take it and lodge it in your heart and go out the doors. And before you go out those doors, you say that is truth. &gt;&gt; That is what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; That is what the messenger has sent. And I simply go out of here with a resolve. That's what I do. &gt;&gt; That's what my home does. &gt;&gt; That's how I live. And God will honor that. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, and I'm going to close. Just give me five minutes. I'm going to do everything I can to close in five minutes. I'm interested in this word and to make I'm going to make a man. And I wrote in my notes, what is it that makes a man? What is it, God? What's in your mind when you say let us make a man or a woman? What kind? What did you have in your mind? I can tell you that God just didn't, you know, grab a bunch of dirt and punch it a couple of times and blow into it and say, "There you are." That isn't it. And if I take just little items, allow me just a few minutes. Can I may have just a few minutes? And and brother Brand talks about he goes into the solar, he goes into the planetaries and and and and this old star of the earth and it's spinning and this clinker comes off and it smolders and it drops for millions of years etc. God stops it and and then different uh elements start coming and he say, "What's he doing? says he's making you. &gt;&gt; That's just this part. That's just this decaying part. &gt;&gt; He's putting some elements in the earth. He took millions of years to bring this apart. But inside of you, oh, hear me. Inside of you, he says, I I'm going to put myself in them without beginning and without ending of days. I'm going to put myself eternal life in them. I'm going to put it in that body. And when that body is long gone back to ashes, they'll be with me. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of man I'm going to make. That's the kind of woman I'm going to make. &gt;&gt; I want a family. &gt;&gt; And so in the word make, here's what it is to make. I'm going to make. Let us make. That is, I'm going to prepare this person. I'm going to prepare this individual. Think it not strange. The scripture says concerning the fiery trials. They're only working out, he says, for your for our good and to perfect us and bring us into that place. These great deserts of experience where righteous men are molded into saints. And he says in prayer, "We thank thee for these experiences." We've experienced as a congregation and as individuals and as families, we've experienced some very, very difficult moments in the last couple of weeks. And I'll say to some, it may well have been a desert, a howling desert. Oh, we would have done anything to escape this experience. I received a little criticism, but very, very little. How can you say certain things? And how can you forgive? How can you tell those people to forgive, which I didn't, but I was misqued? But I will say about the experience, I'm speaking about a God that knows all things. &gt;&gt; He knows every second of your life. He knows the time certain things are going to happen. He knows who's involved. He knows what kind of a network he's going to cast. He knows who he's going to bring in contact with you. But that experience comes your way for your better man to turn you into a different kind. He is making a man. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's making a woman. &gt;&gt; He's making men of faith then women of faith that can face the storm and look straight into the sky and say, "I have heard the voice that you sent &gt;&gt; and I have believed it. I've reversed by your grace that which my fore mother has done and disbelieved you and I have believed your word &gt;&gt; that you sent me. Let us make a man. Let us prepare. Let us make a man. To make is to put him in order. To put it in order. Not just to put the cells in your body and attach your your your your joints together, your knee bone to your leg bone and so on. As Ezekiel says, that's not the order. But an order to our lives in a day, if you can say amen, you can may go ahead. But in a day when things are disjointed, &gt;&gt; in a day when things are pulled apart, &gt;&gt; families are pulled apart, they're rent aart in cruelty, men and women, wives, husbands and wives and families and so on. This message, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, came &gt;&gt; to put it back in order again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you have a right to believe on him whom God has sent because this is not and that is why the scriptur is telling us apostle Paul saying I have much more to say to you concerning this mazec. What is it? Because Jesus did not come from the levitical priesthood. He he and there was nothing said apostle Paul says in Hebrews there was nothing said of the tribe of Judah. But but the scripture had said earlier that he would come of the tribe of Judah. The Messiah would come of the tribe of Judah. He'd be the lion of the tribe of Judah. But there had been nothing said that any high priest would come out of that line. But here comes the Apostle Paul and he takes a scripture one verse out of the Psalms. Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melzdc. We're not under the priesthood of Levi &gt;&gt; because that priest died every year. Every every year there had to be another high priest or when that priest died, another high priest. And once a year he would have to go in for the sins of himself and the people. But now we have a high priest after the order of Melzdc. [Applause] &gt;&gt; A different order. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. I don't care what your experience has been. I'm telling you what the word has said. And the word declares that he's a he's a priest after the order of Melzdc. And the order of Melzdc was he who without beginning of days nor ending of life. &gt;&gt; Believe me, &gt;&gt; and my time of life, I thank God that I have I have a high priest with that kind of order. It's eternal life order. I don't want the order of this life, my breath failing me, my body failing me, my life going from me. I don't want that order. I say come, oh high priest. &gt;&gt; Come, O Mazdc. Come. He who gave bread and wine to my forefather Abraham, come. We're ready for the rapture. We're ready for the change of the body. He who appeared to my father Abraham in a theophony and came and met him on when he come back from the slaughter of the kings. He's a reality. And the messenger that stood here when brother Brandham stood here and the people become all all gripped in the atmosphere and the feeling that was taking place he say that's not me &gt;&gt; that's him &gt;&gt; and then look out and say who did he touch who did she touch not me we're 30 feet away touch the high priest &gt;&gt; didn't touch Aaron &gt;&gt; touch Jesus Christ the high priest after the order of Melkazedc And so in the revealing of the son of man, it had to be in the order of &gt;&gt; MelzDC. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You've heard me preach on it &gt;&gt; and he look at a person. There might be somebody here with cancer. And here now is the word of God in a vessel revealing the son of man. And there's an individual with cancer. The first thing is the cells are out of order. That's right. &gt;&gt; The cells have gone wild. &gt;&gt; And the word of God would come out of him because greater was he that was in him than he that was in this person. &gt;&gt; And greater was he than he that was in the cancer. &gt;&gt; And he knew it was a demon spirit. Rebuke the demon spirit. Come out. And the cells come back in order. [Applause] &gt;&gt; What are you and I doing? We're aging. as we're aging, our cells don't work the same. And I've listened to scientists, medical scientists, who said that they they they gain strength, etc. And brother Brandham, he he uh he he he makes reference to it. He says, "Well, how how come, doctor, when I was young, I ate meat and potatoes, and I I grew into my strength, and now I ate exactly the same meal, and I'm diminishing." &gt;&gt; Well, it's the secret of the selves. And this medical scientist said that the cells come to a certain time in your life and he said for some unexplainable reason they just cease to replicate and then they begin their downward trend and you're on your way &gt;&gt; to the grave. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The high priest &gt;&gt; after the order of Melzdc, he the person who was sent to reveal Jesus Christ to you said this. Hear it because you're going to the you're going to the grave. Every one of you outside of the rapture, &gt;&gt; you might as well hear something worthwhile. Might as well hear something of hope. This isn't something you're going to play on the jukebox or something on the iPod. These are words of eternal life. And furthermore, I know I've been sent here today to say these things &gt;&gt; and that's necessary. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And he said, &gt;&gt; "A sweep will go over you. &gt;&gt; There isn't one. &gt;&gt; You young fellas are heading for my age and you're heading for a casket. Every person here is heading for the same. We'll find all common ground regardless of how you lived in life. will find all common ground in the on the slab someday &gt;&gt; outside of the outside of the rapture and the change. But that messenger said there will be a sweep. There will be a sweep. There will be a sweep go over you and you will be changed in your Adams. That's the order of Melkazedc. That's a different order. &gt;&gt; Your mom and dad gave you one order, but your heavenly father has given you another order. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your mom and dad did everything they could to bring you and to nurture you up. But now the Holy Spirit through the messenger and through the message of the prophet is echoing it now. Is seeking. He's working. He's laboring to get you to believe. &gt;&gt; And you cast that doubt behind you. You say, "Satan, get behind you. Get behind me in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I deny you. I'm looking down seeing Sister Beth. I was asked about you this last week. Stand up. Sister Beth Dingwall on her way to a grave as a girl with cancer for how many years? About 8 years or thereabouts. Her medical hert. And if you haven't seen the video and got the video go of the of her dad and mother sitting here, I tell you what, it's a testimony gone around the world, Sister Beth. And God almighty in his choosing &gt;&gt; wouldn't allow you to wouldn't allow that demon to take you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He chose that you'd stand here today as a witness against him. Greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. Greater is he. &gt;&gt; People say, "I want to see a miracle." You're living in miracles. They're everywhere around you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a miracle that Brother Sam is here. Brother Steve Stevens, uh, Brother Luke Stevens is here. It's a miracle they're here. And it's a miracle God took. &gt;&gt; Silence. &gt;&gt; Do you know something Brother Brandham said? that's not spoken of very often. He's going to put the bride on display. Do you realize that in the last 10 days, millions upon millions of people across North America saw into your lives, heard your words, saw God on your face, and saw the bride on display. And one thing for sure, God's going to hold this nation and all who read and saw. I went over the over the pages and newspapers across six or seven websites of pages and pages and pages where the testimony has continued to go. And there's one thing that is absolutely outstanding. It is the strength and the beauty of the people and of Christ in the people. And where does this faith come from? Where did the stability come from? I say it comes from a people that heard him whom God has sent. and you're on display. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're on display. &gt;&gt; So he said he prepared the people. He prepared the man. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And he put them in order. I got two pages on that. &gt;&gt; And in making the man, this is beautiful, friends. I just can't I got to have another few minutes. In making the man is let us make the man. It is to prepare him to put him in order but now it's to observe him. &gt;&gt; Messenger come said God looking for you. &gt;&gt; God looking for Adam. Why? Because he made the man and he was observing the man. Where are you? Where are you Kyle? Where are you boys? Where are you? Where are you brother Roger? Where are you? Where are you? I'm looking for you. Why? Because in making the man, he has to observe the man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous, Michelle? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; If he hadn't come, &gt;&gt; Michelle would probably still be slinging booze. &gt;&gt; As a bartender, &gt;&gt; oh, God's got a sense of humor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Michelle came here to the church. Came to the church and and uh took him in the back and gave him a cup of coffee. He thought, "Hey, this place is okay." Came and sat down and sat in the front as a cup of coffee waiting for the service to take. And one of the deacons, real sweet brother, just came up and said, "You know what? I take that and he said, "Wow, it's really good. We get refills also." Well, it was a refill, but it wasn't the time you were expecting. Hallelujah. God filled him. &gt;&gt; Isn't it time to rejoice, friends? Isn't it time to thank God? He observes us. He watched over us. He cared for us. &gt;&gt; And then he says to making a to making a man, I'm going to appoint him. He's must be appointed. And Jesus now because he was the revelation of God himself, he said, I appoint unto you. Yes, &gt;&gt; a kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I appoint it to you. &gt;&gt; And friends, there's no getting out of it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's making a woman for the man. Hallelujah. He's observing her. He's watching over her. He's caring for her. Oh, how wonderful it is. &gt;&gt; And we're seeing her. We're able to fellowship with her. You think I'm just shouting out of excitement. I'm shouting out of absolute spiritual enthusiasm. &gt;&gt; How happy we are. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for you. And I thank God for a people that believed on him. &gt;&gt; Whom God has sent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's just thank him with our heads bowed a moment. Oh God, we're here to thank you. &gt;&gt; We're here just to give you thanks. and why you ever chose us and why you ever &gt;&gt; picked us, Lord, and why you ever selected that we should hear and we should encounter this glorious voice, this word that you sent, this revealing of your precious holy scripture. How marvelous, how wonderful, oh grace that came to us, grace that was greater than all of our sin. How we thank you Lord Jesus. We just pray that you'll be honored amongst us.
