We want to remember those this morning in need. If you have a need, you lift your hand before the Lord. Amen. We want to remember the Puit family this morning. The Lord would be their comfort and their peace this morning as well. Let's just pray. Father, Lord, we feel heaven pressing in. Lord, we're looking forward to that day, Lord. Lord, looking forward to that morning, Lord. When that sun rises for the last time on this earth, Lord, you join us. Lord, we're looking for that character, Lord.

Bless the remainder of the service, Lord. Bless your gifts, Lord. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you saints. You may be seated this morning. Want to welcome each one into the service of the Lord. Trust that you feel welcome in his presence. We do want to make mention that uh anyone that is interested in being a counselor at the family camp this fall in August. There will be a short meeting just after the service in the chapel. So if you're interested in being a counselor, Sister Joanne Ray has a special for us this morning. We'll just enjoy the special. We trust that each one of you have come expecting. As brother Lance says many times, if you haven't filled out your order, now would be a good time to start filling it out. Make sure you ask specifically because the Lord answers just that way. Amen. God bless you. Out heaven's filior [Music] that made him leave his glorious throne and crown. The one who made the earth, the sky and sea. Who put the stars in every galaxy? What? Oh, how can it be? What shame he suffered? Oh, what agony. And then the death he died for sinners crucified. What grace is this? What grace is this? Oh, the boundless grace of God seen in Christ the Lord of now. Like an ocean deep and wide like the trackless sky is God's grace to a fallen race in what grace is that brought myior [Music] that made him leave his glorious throne and crown. The one who made the earth, the sky and sea. Who put the stars in every galaxy? [Music] What? Oh, how can it be? What shame he suffered. Oh, what a [Music] death he died for sinners crucified. What grace is this? What grace is this? What grace is this? What grace is this? &gt;&gt; Marvelous grace. What wonderful grace. Why don't we sing Amazing Grace as the little ones come in? We'll invite our pastor to come this morning, take his liberty. If you have anything on your schedule, declared it for the day. Amen. I trust that you have and you've come. The Lord will speak to us this morning. [Music] How sweet that sound that like me on [Music] I But now I see &gt;&gt; it was amazing grace. Amazing grace. How sweet that sound [Music] like me. I was nowind. [Music] &gt;&gt; Can we sing that with just our voices this morning? [Music] &gt;&gt; The sound and save a rest like me. [Music] I was lost but now [Music] I see. Amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. How sweet the sound [Music] like me. I was lost. [Music] Now I see when we [Music] thin [Music] as the [Music] we sing God's praise when we [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't believe we'll ever tire of giving him praise. my every once in a while we get a little glimpse of the greatness of God and and it just uh it defies our imagination. It defies our ability. We cannot even begin to gather uh the mental powers to think of the greatness of God. And uh I've been really thinking about it lately, really affected by thinking how how God can be eternal, how he can fill all time and space. Uh I I'm just I'm done when I say those few words. And then the what man has discovered, you know, about time and space, uh what he's discovered just within himself, it just completely completely defies our mental capacity. Amen. And I'm glad it does. &gt;&gt; If we could understand him, it wouldn't be wouldn't be God. If we could just understand all about him, just wouldn't be him. So I I think you know he's everywhere. He's everywhere. He's all around where you're sitting. And yet he fills the universe. This great being. My brother Brandham said he'd be so mystical. People couldn't understand it. That's why that God had to come down that funnel of love called Jesus Christ and began in simplicity and humility to make himself known to us. and began to display his attributes. Heal the sick, deliver the bound. Oh my. Well, better not get preaching before I get preaching. His presence is wonderful and we love it so much. I'm glad that you're all here. We're glad for the invisible congregation. I noticed the other day, I don't look maybe once every few months, but I noticed the other day in one of the services there was a 178 locations all around the world that were live streaming while you're here and they're with us. Amen. And we're together. And I want to greet them all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherever they may be in whatever time of the day or night it might be for them. Some I understand get up very very early in the morning in the wee hours of the morning, much earlier than any of us had to get up today to be in church and be with us today. And I say God bless them. &gt;&gt; Each one beautiful bride of Jesus Christ. Just going to make one comment about the uh a meeting brief meeting after the service this morning that brother Tom has called brother Jess regarding the uh camp. Now we're having the convention which is July 1st to the 8th and we had a marvelous turnout must have been close to 200 people that turned out to give themselves to assist or do whatever they could for the convention. And that's great because we just don't know how many bodies and people we're going to draw on. We never really uh we never put the finger on those that have helped out at the camp so much. Some of the people that have taken a more senior position at the camp, we did not put a finger on them to be team leaders or whatever more. There's a lot of capable people. And one of the reasons for that was we want you to be free and and if you have not, you know, uh if you've not uh been assigned anything for the convention, then we are certainly going to need some counselors for the convention for the camp, family camp. You might say, well, that's an awful lot to happen. That's correct, but the convention is one thing and the family camp is quite another. And we want to have as complete a camp as possible. And uh if we need to readjust it a wee bit, well, we will do so. But we just feel that if you come forward and there's uh support for counselors and everything, we'll we'll have a family camp. I think that uh we've never this is going to be 20 or 21 years. And uh it has been a marvelous just a marvelous uh component of the of the this church and for our church where we don't do it so much for the convention is for people that are everywhere and throughout the world and so on. And uh speaking brother Tim Puit yesterday uh and he plans to come probably he and his wife as well which we're happy for. So uh but the family camp I think is a very very important part. I think the young people and children uh I I believe that they need it. I I believe do you &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. And if I had children, I'd be making myself available in whatever way I could. And even if I didn't if I didn't have children in the camp, it's still still it's a wonderful opportunity to be able to do something for the Lord. Amen. Well, we'll stand and going to read some scripture. Um I'm going to begin by reading in Isaiah the 61st chapter. We're going to read in three places. Isaiah 61. Then we'll read in 1 John two verses. 1 John 2. And then we'll read in 1 Thessalonians 4. So we'll begin in Isaiah 61. And I'm just reading verses 1 through3. The spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek. He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound. to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn, to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified. And then we will read also now in first John uh the second chapter. We're going to read verse 20. But ye have an uncction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. In verse 27, but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you, and you need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, you shall abide in him. I would like to just say before we read the next scripture that the word the uncction that you've received in verse 20 the word uncction and the word anointing in verse 27 are exactly the same word they are the same Greek word and they have to do with the anointing. So the anointing, the first scripture we read, for the spirit of the Lord is upon me, which was a prophecy concerning Jesus Christ. And Jesus repeated that same scripture in Luke the 4th chapter when he took the book and read from Isaiah and closed the book halfway through the second verse to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. But he closed it before he come to the day of vengeance of our God because it was not for his time. And now that was the anointing that Christ received. And now John is saying but you have received an anointing. It's not enough just to know that Christ had received anointing but you have received an anointing. And I am wanting to direct my thoughts today and not my thoughts alone. I trust they're the thoughts of God that were brought to me and then I'm able to convey them to you. But I would like to take the subject anointed for rapture. And so we will read in first Thessalonians concerning the rapture in the fourth chapter of 1 Thessalonians starting at verse 15. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. And may we be comforted today by these words. May we be encouraged and may all doubt and question be banished in his presence. We'll pray. Oh almighty God, I come to you in that holy righteous name of Jesus Christ. We come to you Lord with a sense of feeling unworthy and yet we come because we know we are accepted in the beloved. And who could bring us before your throne? Who could declare, oh God, so that we would not have any shame? Who could declare us before the throne? But this one that we have accepted and received as our savior, the lovely Lord Jesus Christ, our bridegroom and the husband of the bride. Oh God, we are coming because you're the God of Abraham and you made promise to him. You're the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. You spoke to Moses from a burning bush that was not devoured by the flame. You made yourself known to the prophets down through the ages and to the messengers and to the apostles. And you brought forth Jesus Christ as a sacrifice for our sins and gave him freely. Oh, how terrible our sins must have been. What a chasm. What a separation from a holy God. But you sent forth Jesus Christ with the pure, spotless lamb of God, the blood of God as our sacrifice today. And we stand here washed. We stand here cleansed. We stand here perfect in your sight, Lord, because the sacrifice, our sacrifice was perfect. We don't feel that perfection as such, but we know that you have said so in the word. And so, we're coming on the basis of your promise. We're coming on the basis of your provision. And I pray now the Holy Spirit come and take full charge and control of this meeting. Take full control of every mind. Oh God, bring into bring every mind and every thought into subjection to the will and plan of the Holy Ghost. May your purpose be accomplished not only within the confines of this building and this sanctuary, but out wherever the service today is streamed. I pray father let the Holy Spirit come into every room into every place and now God give liberty I ask in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory alone. Amen. You may be seated. Brother Brandham addressed the subject of rapture in the rapture message at the very beginning by saying that the word rapture does not even appear in the Bible which it doesn't. What appears in the Bible is that we shall be caught up. And uh he said that uh the Bible said caught up being caught up. And we read he read in Thessalonians this order. He calls it the order of this great rapture that will take place in the last days. this rapture. There's uh uh an aspect about the rapture which I just want to touch on before we come into the anointing because my subject is largely upon the anointing. The apostle Paul related an experience which he had. He said, "I knew a man in Christ about 14 years ago. Whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell. God knows. Such a one caught up to the third heaven. He said how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter. And then this one who had experienced that kind of an experience, he was the one who could say what he said concerning the rapture or being caught up and give us a give us just a a very very fundamental foundation. We were that are alive and remain. We will not prevent them that are asleep. And he's he's crossing dimension them that are asleep and we that are alive and remain and then they will be li raised up and we'll be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air. He's just he's spanning such a an enormous amount of of of thought here. A person has to really give themselves to think about that and that is the rapture. And he saw unspeakable things. And so he said he was he was caught up 14 years ago. I cannot tell but he he uses the same phrase. He was caught up into the third heaven. And now this catching up to be caught up. And brother Brandham uses the phrase catch up literally in the Hebrews to seize. And it's to seize by force. It's to seize, to claim for oneself eagerly. It's not just to seize. It's not just that act, but it's to seize quickly and eagerly for one's own self. In other words, it would be to say, "This is mine." &gt;&gt; And I'm taking it quickly. &gt;&gt; I'm retrieving it. It belongs to me. &gt;&gt; To save it eagerly. And furthermore, it comes from a base word that is not only to take away. Not only to take it, not only to seize it, but to lift it up. So the act is to seize it, take it to myself eagerly, quickly and to lift it up, to raise it up. It is something that is not just it doesn't give the impression that we just take it and hold it to ourselves here in this place. But the purpose of seizing it and taking it to oneself eagerly is so that they might bear it away. To take away and to lift up it come from arrow to lift it up heavenly that which is seized and that which belongs to the one who is seizing it to take it by force. The Bible says that the last enemy to be destroyed is death. I want you to think about that. Death is not anybody's friend. Death is not anyone is not one that any one of us want to invite. Death comes to our homes and our families as an unwanted guest. And it will always be an unwanted guest. It is an enemy. And I can well imagine that the last enemy to be destroyed is death. This is going to be the most fierce of all struggles. This is going to be the ultimate battle when God destroys death. &gt;&gt; Death which reigns in our physical bodies at this moment. &gt;&gt; You have it right in you. &gt;&gt; We are dying as of this moment. We're a dying people. So, it's not I'm not speaking about something that is out here, you know, something that's up in the future. You have it with you. &gt;&gt; And there's only one counterattack to that, and that's life. If you're here without Christ, you're dying without hope. &gt;&gt; And you are certainly dying. If you're here and you're in a backsliden state, you're in a terrible condition. If you're here and just living in some lukewarm cool half, you know, kind of half uh just go along situation which often happens in a church. Young people or parents or husbands or wives, we're all susceptible to it perhaps. I trust by the grace of God even after the service that that will not exist in any heart here because it's a terrible thing to be under the reign of death. It's a terrible thing to be under the hold and the grip of your enemy. &gt;&gt; And death is an enemy. &gt;&gt; I don't need to even have you say amen to that. I can say amen to that. Death is an enemy. &gt;&gt; I don't like it in I don't like it when it happens and I don't like it in slow motion. I don't like sickness. Sickness is death. I don't like sickness. I don't like infirmity. It's all part of Satan's kingdom. It's foreign to us and we're opposed to it. Hallelujah. We believe in We believe in deliverance. &gt;&gt; We believe in healing. We believe in supernatural. We believe it because our God is that &gt;&gt; and we can't be anything else. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. And the word destroyed is to render idle. The last enemy to be re to be inactivated is death to cause a person to have no further efficiency. God is going to cause death to be in inactive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He will not be active. Satan cannot be active through the angel of death upon the believer anymore simply because how do we know that? Simply because it's been said. &gt;&gt; And that's the only basis that we have to believe that. Otherwise, we just die like animals. &gt;&gt; And I resist that &gt;&gt; and resent that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I would not allow Satan to even impose that upon our minds. And you want to be sure to shut it out of your mind today. He has no right. He has no claim. I'm not his in any way, shape, or form. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This message came to me on the wings of healing. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. On restoration, healing under his wings, and there I will abide. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's to cause a person or a thing to have lose its efficiency, to deprive it of force. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. God is going to deprive it of force &gt;&gt; on behalf of the on behalf of those that are caught up. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I were here today and I even had an inkling that I'm one of those that's going to be caught up and defy that God is going to defy the power of death. You ought to be a rejoicing people today. You ought to you ought to be able to express your liberty &gt;&gt; that that here's a people that actually believes they're going to uh they're going to bypass death. That death on their behalf is going to be rendered inefficient. &gt;&gt; Inactive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to abolish, to cease, to be done away, to be severed from. Oh, my brother, my sister, I I can't wait for the day when I enter into that realm, enter into that place. And I don't think it's somewhere far in the distance. I believe it's right here. This God that made this word, sent this word, sent forth Jesus Christ, anointed these apostles, took took the Apostle Paul into the third heaven so he could write about these things. He knows something about the last enemy that's going to be destroyed is death. &gt;&gt; And I draw on the God that wrote this word. &gt;&gt; We draw on him. He's all around. &gt;&gt; He's right where you are now. say all you have to do is exercise faith in what he says so that that presence can come to you. Now I want to bring it very near to you. It's all around you. You just have to absorb it &gt;&gt; by the word and by faith. You have faith. Just absorb it so it can come into your heart, &gt;&gt; into your being, even into your body and into your mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Now, the anointing of the Holy Spirit, it is not something that's very well understood. And that's why I thought that I would go into it with some in some depth this morning. One of the reasons why it is not really understood, anointing is something that comes from the eastern culture. It is not part of western culture. And so we have a a really a wide array of of thought of what the anointing is. Oh, that was sure an anointed song. What do you mean? Oh, wasn't he anointed when he spoke? Define that for me. You'd have a hard time. Well, you say, well, it came across with such power. I know all kinds of inspirational speakers that come across with power. I know people, gifted people. I know people that just have a natural talent of having control of of they know how to do it. They're not anointed. I used to be in the auction business. I I I know what a what an auctioneer can say, "Oh, what an anointed auctioneer. Why?" Well, because he got good prices for everything. Doesn't mean he was anointed. That's what What is the anointing? He just had a natural talent to pull the money out of the people's pocketbook. Oh, that was such an anointed song. What was it? Because it was the volume because they knew how to handle the mic or they knew how to play. That was such an anointed piece. What was it? I know I kind of got you baffled. That's just what I want to do. We're acquainted with the phrase of the anointing, but it's important we really know what we ask for when we say, "Lord, anoint me," what are we saying? What are we asking for? What are we actually even expecting? So God has used, and I'm just going to take it very quickly, going to move it through the scripture, but God has taken what was an eastern custom and not unique to the Jews alone or to the Hebrews. It was an eastern custom and I won't spend a lot of time on this but to anoint as far as the Hebrew terminology is concerned. It was to actually smear or usually with oil anointment over an object or on an object and that was to anoint that object uh with as I said usually an oil and then it had the connotation that you were consecrating it. it it was being set aside or this was a special this had a special meaning and they'd actually put an oil on something and I found in India which in a heathen heathen practice for I was in a in a temple I believe that's what where you were brother David and and the brothers uh and we did the video and we got special permission there was a lot of high priestesses women that were uh uh that were there in charge of doing a lot of things. And so we got into an area that the average person doesn't get into, just the worshippers. And the people that belong to that particular uh it was indeed a cult. And so we we got in there and and there was a little building, a little room, and the people were just looking. They because they couldn't draw near to it because that was their holy of holies. The whole thing is, you know, Satan, he copies and impersonates the genuine. And in this holy of holies was a was a stone. And uh so I queried what was so special about this stone. And they were smearing oil over this stone and they with their hands and anointing this stone because this was such a sacred sacred spot. This was their holy of holies. So I said what is special about this stone? Well, it is said that a great storm came through here and when the storm came through here here the stone appeared out of the out of the ground and then he built this whole thing. This temple was mammoth and they had uh tens of thousands of people would walk even up to 400 kilometers about 240 50 miles would walk and we saw them on the road walking to come to this place. It was just unbelievable the amount of uh influence that they had. I invited them to come to Saskatchewan where I could show them where strong winds had left lots of stones up above the ground and they would have all kinds of stones to put oil on them if they wanted to or the Midwest or some places that you know Eastern Oregon has them stones all over it. Look just like all kinds of stones I had but there they were uh smearing this oil over it. But in the Bible, some of the first instances we find Jacob, Jacob anointed a pillar. The Bible says there was a pillar. And I looked to see what the Hebrew term was for that pillar. It said it was probably wood, something like a a stump. And and uh Jacob anointed that pillar in a place where he had met with God. Then Moses was commanded by God to have spices and these spices were for the anointing oil and so that the anointing oil now would become fragrant. And it is in Exodus 25 and6 and oil for the light spices for the anointing oil and for sweet incense. And then the act of anointing took on a new significance. It became it it it it began to be shaped differently in the minds of the people because God was moving something they were familiar with and giving it more significance and more spiritual application and meaning all the time. And now God commanded Moses that he should anoint now the sons of Aaron. And so now it was going not just from a stump or from a stone or from something else or to anoint a special place, but now he said, "Now you've got this oil and this fragrant oil and you've got spices for the oil. Now you'll anoint the sons of Aaron. And thou shalt put upon them upon Aaron thy brother and his sons with him. Thou shalt anoint them and consecrate them. Because now the act of anointing them was indicative that they were being set aside for a special purpose, for a special ministry, that this act of anointing them, set them aside from all the others that were of the people. and you will anoint them, consecrate them, and sanctify them that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. And so now you have to see that a very important thing here that's going to that is going to take place in the next two three scriptures is that the anointing of the people was setting them aside to a to a special office uh a special ministry or a special position that God was giving them and that and the go and God says that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. So you have to see that the act of anointing them was something that God Almighty was going to acknowledge. If they were not anointed, there's nothing for God to respond to. So you'll anoint them that they may minister unto me. And God was going to acknowledge that that they would they would then be in the priest's office. And then it moves moves further. It takes on increasing significance in uh Exodus 29 and 7. Thou shalt take the anointing oil and pour it upon the head. This was upon the head of Aaron. Now, it's not just anoint his sons, but now you'll take this anointing oil and you're going to pour it on the head of Aaron, the high priest, and anoint and appoint him. because now he would become the high priest. And so the anointing takes on even a greater a greater significance at this time. Then it moves even further. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Then God said, "Now you will anoint the altar." There's objects that are special within the temple or the tabernacle that was built. I want you to anoint the altar. And it was the same thing. Anoint them with oil. Then we move further through the scripture. And when God was telling Samuel how that he shall select a king for Israel, Saul had been selected, Saul had fallen away and backsliden in a into a a state that was displeasing to God. And God said to Samuel, "You go," and he directed him to go to the house of Jesse, and you will take anointing oil, take the horn of anointing with you because now you're going to anoint a king. Not just a priest or the high priest, but now you're going to anoint a king. And a supernatural event is taking place actually when the anointing takes place. So on earth there's a horn of oil that's being poured onto an individual. But in the mind of God, God already from the foundation of the world had chosen this young strippling of a boy that he'll have a kingdom and his kingdom will never never pass away. And I'm going to give something out of my loins to be his son. He'll be called the son of David. This anointing was not a light thing, friends. And this anointing was moving a young shepherd boy from the position of being a shepherd boy, actually transferring him into a kingly position, a kingly role, a kingly office, and he was anointed, although he was still a young lad. But as far as God was concerned, he was already in another position. It's important you get this now. As far as God was concerned, when that anointing was poured out, it already happened. &gt;&gt; It couldn't be reversed. God wouldn't take it back. &gt;&gt; He never would send his prophet and say, "Take it back. &gt;&gt; Go and retrieve that oil that you poured. I made a mistake." No, you anoint him. &gt;&gt; He is the one I've chosen. And so Samuel is there and the boys start to come by strong. Oh, beautiful of stature. And Samuel even himself was impressed. This must be him. It's not him. The next one, the next one. All of them come by. Samuel is sure that some of these fine young men are the one to be anointed king. He has to ask the father, "Don't you have a Isn't there another one?" Well, yeah. Yeah, there is. He's out actually out looking after the sheep. Call him. In comes this ruddy little fellow. Maybe had a slingshot hanging down on his side from his belt, bewildered of what is happening. And the and the scripture says this is him. &gt;&gt; This is him chosen of him. Anoint him. And the Bible says, "Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. and the spirit. Notice now and ha and and Samuel took the horn of oil in the midst of his brethren and anointed him and the spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. &gt;&gt; So Samuel rose up and went to Rama. So now almighty God, the very spirit of God is now being moved. Is now is now in motion just by the simple act. It's come a long ways, friends. Come a long ways from putting some oil on a stump. It's come a long ways. Do you agree? &gt;&gt; You see that? It's it's a it's a moving it's it's a it's a moving uh teaching. It's a moving doctrine. It's something that God had in his mind and it is increasing in its magnitude and now in fact is this became so significant with the people of the Hebrews is that the word anointed is is a synonym of king. When you say anointed, they think of king right away. It's synonymous with kingship. And thus we come now to the term the anointed one, the Messiah, the anointed one. And they knew that that who is the anointed one must be king. That's why he was called when he came. This is Jesus, the king of the Jews. Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. There was something of that was kingly about him, his demeanor, his power. Which king did they have that fed 5,000 out of a basket of loaves and fishes? This is a kind of king we want who heals the blind and causes the lame to walk. What king did we ever have? Saul didn't do it. Solomon didn't do it. But we have a king now. Jesus, the son of David, that is doing these things, manifesting something, and it moved them. And here is really the depth. I want you to catch this before I continue. among the Hebrews. It was believed it was not only that it it affected that anointing that it affected a transference to the anointed one of something of the holiness and the virtue of the deity in whose name and by whose representative the right the right the act of anointing was performed. formed. So now when Samuel, he's the representative and he has gone by commission to a certain house of a certain lineage to a certain people. He's gone by divine uh direction guided by the God that he's a representative of to a certain place to wait for a certain boy, a certain son that has certain seed within him and are going to anoint him and as the king of Israel. And so the Hebrews believe that the deity the God that this prophet represented when he did the act that there was something actually at that moment transferred. They believed that that there was something transferred from the deity to the individual by the act of the anointing. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you have spiritual minds. I want to really dwell on this point. The transfer, the transferal of holiness, the transferral of righteousness, of virtue and of special endowment by the Holy Spirit. If you have the right representative &gt;&gt; and that that representative has come to the right people, Then the very act of his pouring out &gt;&gt; has a divine effect &gt;&gt; upon a specific group. &gt;&gt; It didn't mean anything to a lot of miracle seekers. &gt;&gt; It didn't have an effect. But as soon as uh David was there, the right representative, the prophet of God, come to the right house, to the right people, to the elected one. Then he took what he had, what he had been given, what he had been uh uh entrusted with and poured it out on that people, and a divine thing took place. In the message, why are people so tossed about? Brother Brandham says, "Some people get the wrong impression of what the anointing is." Did you ever think of that? When was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone? And what did they do when they had the anointing? The greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ. We have the spirit by measure. He had it without measure. And one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll to read. The spirit of God is upon me. He has anointed me to preach the go preach the acceptable year and to bind up the broken hearts and to heal the sick and give sight to the blind. And now we would think if such an anointing was on him that had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come. And here he was with the type of anointing with that type of anointing the full blessing the anointing of the Lord upon him. Are you listening? We would want to run. He said we would want to run all over the building and scream and holler. But the Bible said he laid down the scroll and went and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth. He said that's what he did under the anointing. &gt;&gt; The anointing, he said, is not an emotion. The anointing is supreme power in control. The anointing is supreme power in control. &gt;&gt; He said like knowing exactly what and how and that's what's here. He said like exactly knowing what and how. He hesitates and that's he said what's here because God had sent a special anointing. And so the scripture which we read and when Jesus said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath the Lord hath anointed me and I like you now to notice what the Lord had anointed him for to preach good tidings unto the meek. Number one, to bind up the brokenhearted. Number two, to proclaim liberty to the captives. Number three, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound. Number four, and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. Number five, and that is when he closed the book to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. He's anointed me. And that is where now from Hebrew we come to the Greek Christos or Messias is where it comes from. Consecrating Jesus to the Messiah office and furnishing him with the necessary powers for the administration. And then in Acts it says of Christ of this how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth. And now this is being spoken to them that did not really believe, but how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil. For God was with him. You know, it takes the anointing. It's not enough just to get up and preach. But the scripture says that Jesus, he declared the Lord hath anointed me. And if it takes the anointing on Jesus Christ, the son of God, to preach, it sure takes it for us poor humans. &gt;&gt; It's not some ability, human ability, some talent. I got a gift with words. That has nothing to do with it. It takes the anointing &gt;&gt; even if a person hasn't got a gift of words. &gt;&gt; I think of Smith Wigglesworth. A plumber past 40 years old and his wife was the preacher. She was the one gifted with words. She was the one who really led the way in the home spiritually speaking. And Smith Wigglesworth was just a plumber. But one day the Holy Spirit came on him and he became filled with the Holy Ghost. He became sealed with God. And I can say that that sealing on him, God transferred something divine into that man and he became known as the apostle of faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was sent of the Holy Spirit to a place and a woman had died and she was on a slab and he knew he'd been sent there to raise her from the dead and he commanded her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to rise and walk and zero nothing happened. The report is he took her by the shoulders and stood her up against the wall and he said, "I said walk and let go and she walked." &gt;&gt; Apostle of faith. &gt;&gt; Mighty man of God. Brother Brandon mentioned his name to me and he died in 1949. Brother Brandon was saying how that ministry was just fading out when other was coming in. &gt;&gt; Different kind of a ministry. And then now we have the anointing has moved all the way to the uh thought and the understanding that we have that the Messiah is the anointed one. And they knew that it was associated with kingship, the anointed one. You know, brother Brandham talks about the sign of Messiah over 300 times. He makes the reference to the sign of the Messiah. Abraham knew that there was something special when this visitor who he had revealed to him were not was none other than Lord. And he uses the term Lord. But when that visitor said, "Where's Sarah thy wife?" &gt;&gt; He knew this is a different visitation. &gt;&gt; Even though he has not moved through all this process that I have just in my weakness given to you today of the anointing, but he knew that this was different. He knew this was a different sign. He had never encountered this before. Where's Sarah, your wife? &gt;&gt; She's in the tent behind you. I will certainly visit her according to the time of life and she shall have a son &gt;&gt; and she laughs in the tent. He knew that was a special sign. Why did Sarah laugh? She says in her heart I didn't laugh. But you did. This was now a revealing of the secret of the heart. This had never happened in Abraham's life. This one that's standing before me is revealing the secret of my wife's heart in the tent behind him. This is a special sign. &gt;&gt; And he believed the sign. He believed the sign. He believed that one. And a prophet comes in the end time. You've never heard it before. He said that was Elohim standing before him. Elohim in a body revealing the secret of the heart. &gt;&gt; It was a sign. It was a sign that would be projected into the future of the Messiah sign be the sign of Messiah. &gt;&gt; Do you know that people live for centuries and never saw it and never heard of it? They didn't even know it existed. Do you know that there's multitudes just like you that God didn't even allow to hear a word about that? Do you know there's a multitude of people untold millions and hundreds of millions and perhaps into the billions that never even heard or knew the concept that there's such a thing as an anointed one, &gt;&gt; a Messiah. Here you have it on your shelves. You have it in your books. You have it by voice. You have the evidence of it. I tell you friends, there's no time for us to sit idly by because God's going to hold us accountable. What did I send you? &gt;&gt; What did I send you? I sent you the sign of Messiah. &gt;&gt; Furthermore, friends, he what is this generation going to be accountable for? He sent you and I the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; If there's anybody believes in a rapture, it should be us. There's anybody who believes in the change of the body, it should be us. &gt;&gt; We've received an undisputable sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's been healing, all kinds of healings that have taken place under all these different ministries. But healing under this ministry has a different scope &gt;&gt; because it is it is a healing under a particular called representative &gt;&gt; that had a particular sign. And so he could say about healing under this sign that that healing is the token evidence of the resurrection. It may not have been that under other ministries because that had not been what had been poured out, but what had been poured out now was not only just supernatural signs. And thus those that went after the signs never received what was actually poured out. the woman at the well. How many times you've heard it and how many times it's so common to us. But the woman said unto him, speaking to Jesus, I know that the Messiah's cometh, which is called Christ. I know the anointed one is coming. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think about the scene she was at that moment as some that perhaps are here today. I know there's something supposed to happen, but they don't realize that the very one who's going to cause it to happen is right in their presence at that moment. I know when the Messiah cometh, he will tell us. He will tell us all things. He'll certainly reveal a secret of the heart. And she already had been told, "You've had five husbands and the one you're with now is not your husband." &gt;&gt; That smote her. &gt;&gt; That is the truth. She knew that was a sign of Messiah. I know when the Messiah cometh, he'll tell us all these things. Went into a city and the only thing Jesus had said to her, you've had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband. But she went into the city and the and the the whole realization that she had was come and see a man that told me all that ever I did. In other words, when he spoke that her whole life was exposed. How many times we've even had people come into church into right here and and and and the the minister, whoever it might be, in a simplicity preaches the word of God and that individual and you've experienced it. Who told him everything? &gt;&gt; Who told him all about my life? Who exposed me like that? The same Messiah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet of God says if you had an angel that come from heaven or an angel standing at the pulpit, which one's the greater? He said the angel at the pulpit is greater. &gt;&gt; You think I have to make much something out of myself? I don't have to make anything out of myself at all. That's what a prophet said. You either take what he said or just forget it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now, as of this moment, if an angel from God came from heaven sinless and stood here beside this pulpit, I know you would be distracted. But if you really believed what a messenger said, you'd say, "The one that is the most important to me right now is the one behind the pulpit. The one that's been redeemed, the one that knew sin, the one that's been made spotless by the blood of the lamb. And the one he's he's giving the horn of oils been poured upon him for this service to this people. And I am that person." &gt;&gt; That's the only way you can get it. That's when you really get something. &gt;&gt; And yet on the other hand, we're just brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; I'm absolutely nothing. And you're nothing without him. &gt;&gt; But with him, we all have our place. &gt;&gt; Have our place. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; The sign of Messiah. The sign of Messiah was Nathaniel. In John 1, Nathaniel answered and said unto him, Jesus just said, "Before Philip called you when you were under the fig tree, I saw you." That's not a big profound sermon, is it? You say, "Well, what what could happen out of that?" before just as common as before the brother or before the sister came to you yesterday and said certain things to you. You say, "Well, my that was just I was just in the house or I was just outside. I was under a tree. I was just doing something." But he realized the one speaking to him knew what happened yesterday. &gt;&gt; And that was enough. He didn't need sermons. He didn't need a wall of books or tapes. &gt;&gt; He identified the sign. &gt;&gt; That's a sign. Wow. That's a sign of Messiah. &gt;&gt; And with that, he makes a declaration. You're the son of God. You're a rabbi. Thou art the son of God. Notice now, thou art the king &gt;&gt; of Israel. &gt;&gt; You're the anointed one. And the anointed one is a synonym of the king. You're the He says, "Rabbi, thou the son of God. Thou the king of Israel. You're the anointed one. I see the sign of Messiah &gt;&gt; for my time. &gt;&gt; And just that one thing turned Nathaniel into a believer. And quickly in a revelation of Jesus Christ series, the prophet says they knew that he was a prophet. They knew the sign of the Messiah would come only through the prophet. That was John 41. John 1:41 speaking of Nathaniel in the message of Queen of Sheba. He said, "What was Jonah?" A sign of the resurrection. Hallelujah. The resurrection. And that's the thing we're seeing now, the sign of the resurrection. Telling people 40 years ago, what you're seeing right now is the sign of the resurrection. And greater than Solomon is here says in this generation has to receive the sign of the resurrection to dovetail with my last night's sermon of the signs that he did then. He spoke that message of the signs that he did then. and he's never done them since in all the age until the closing of the gentile dispensation and that we're now living in in this wicked and adulterous generation. &gt;&gt; This Christrejecting generation has received not will has received the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Listen to it. The last sign &gt;&gt; to the church. said there won't be another one. &gt;&gt; This wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign. Jesus said, brother Brandham said the sign of the resurrection, this is greater than Solomon is here. Says you get it. the sign of the resurrection. Christ alive &gt;&gt; tonight amongst us doing the same things that he did. &gt;&gt; Did a wicked and adulterous generation receive it? No. But he wasn't sent to a wicked and adulterous generation. The sign and that anointing that came with the sign was sent to a certain household, &gt;&gt; to a certain place, &gt;&gt; to a certain person. Amen. &gt;&gt; No, it's not this one. It's not this one. Maybe you had a prayer card. You were called in the prayer line. You lived in that day, but I was one that never saw it. I was one that never heard it. But now, now you come by and you're you're gripped by it and you stop. &gt;&gt; What is this? &gt;&gt; Who is this? &gt;&gt; This has a different sound because it was sent to you and God had ordained before the foundation of the world. Take the horn &gt;&gt; of oil. Take the message and pour it on them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't something that just went on the head. But Apostle John had the revelation when he said, "And you have received an uncction. You have received an anointing in verse 27 that is abiding with you and is in you. &gt;&gt; You have received it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; An uncction not from a man. &gt;&gt; David the strippling boy could have said, "Where did the oil come from?" Well, the oil come from the olive oil press, I suppose. Where did this man come from? I don't know him. I only know he's the prophet. He's the one that has it. He's the representative. But it's not just a representative. He could have said it came from came from Samuel. Didn't come from him. &gt;&gt; He w Samuel wouldn't even be there. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't even have a horn. He wouldn't have oil in the horn unless there was someone else who he was representing. Go to that place. Go to that town. Go to that house. Go to that factory. Go to that store. Buy that house. That neighbor needs it. Ride that bus. Talk to that man. Sit on this seat in the airplane. Hallelujah. I got a message. You received an anointing and it's in you. It's an uncction. You've got to speak. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm sent to this house. I'm sent to this person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have their lineage written in my book, in my home in heaven. I have their name. And you're sent to them. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The uncction, the anointing, it's been sent. I want to just take a few moments now. I want to make this statement. The horn of God's message poured out. That would be a good message title. The horn of God's message poured out in the message. Blasphemous names. Notice the message. Blasphemous names. Multitudes, all kinds of church groups and whatever making claim to the anointing. Are you ready? And they are anointed &gt;&gt; with the genuine Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; but that does not save an individual. &gt;&gt; There are some that are anointed. Samuel, had Samuel poured the oil on the first son and the second and the third, what would have happened? Nothing. because it wasn't theirs. &gt;&gt; It wasn't for them. It wouldn't have done anything. The spirit would not have come onto them from that day forward. Because it it would have been an exercise in futility. And so in this day, then it's poured out. The spirit of the Lord, Jesus said, is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach. And so he preached, did he not? &gt;&gt; Did he preach? &gt;&gt; Did he proclaim? &gt;&gt; And they all were recipients of that outpouring. &gt;&gt; But were they saved? &gt;&gt; They were some of the same ones that said, "Crucify, crucify." Some of the same ones. &gt;&gt; Some of the same ones that were out to destroy his influence. And then Caiaphas, Caiaphas, he's actually prophesied out of the scripture, things that were in the scripture. There must be one that must die for the people. And he he prophesied a true prophecy, but himself was false. That is why if you can catch it of the s services in the last couple weeks where God even told brother Brandham, keep it quiet, keep it still. Don't show it to all the people because it'll only cause impersonations. &gt;&gt; And I'll teach you how to fish. I'm going to come to that in a moment. And he's tried to explain the gift. try to explain how it worked. This is a sign in my hand. This is why. And I gave the example of a people I know that stood on the platform and he showed the sign in his hand. I was with him in a restaurant. And in fact is uh elder in our church who is sister Cindy Bergen calls him Grandpa Haney. and I'm going to be with his son tomorrow who was a deacon in our church up there. And there was just the three of us as I remember and brother Haney getting up in years, great saint of God. How we love him. And I introduced brother Bram. I said, "This is brother Haney." And he just reached across took his hand. And and this is exactly what happened. He he took his hand and he jerked and he looked at me like that. He said, "Did you get that? wasn't my hand. It was his hand. That that gift, that sign. And he got what his trouble was. Never said another word. Never said another word. But he wanted to know how I got it. Sorry, Brother Brandham. You're talking to the wrong man. I just don't have that. But you hear it on tape and and he and he's got a person up there and I believe it's a woman again and he and his and his hand shows the sign. There was a the remarks and so on and he called it vibrations and he told her exactly what it was and he just said I'm asking everyone else he said to close their eyes and bow their head but I want you to stay watching my hand and I'm going to pray. He says and if my hand becomes normal the child is healed. If it does not, God has chosen not to heal the child. Wasn't that simple? Isn't that profound? Does a man have thousands of people in front of him and puts himself on that kind of a position? Do you know why? He had absolute confidence in the one who had sent him. He knew he was representative of God Almighty. And so he just prayed and right in front of the eyes of that individual hand just become normal. He said, "There he is. There you are. Just normal. You've had your request. The child is healed. Is that marvelous how simple it is? You say, "Why am I going back and making that so simple?" Because that was a sign. But yet the people that it wasn't the sign that did it. It wasn't even the anointing that did it. It's the anointing to the right individual. And that does something special. I'm speaking to you today because listen to me. You may not be where you ought to be. You may know that in your heart of hearts, but deep down at the very bottom, you may know there's something there that is anchored. You say, "I know that I've been called to this message. I'm not perhaps living it the way I should, but I know I've been called. I know that I am a son of God. I know I'm a daughter of God. Then this service is for you. This service is to allow you to know, to allow you to be impressed. And I felt before I came to the service, this is the direction it was going to go. And I even have a song that was directed to have for the last song that we're going to sing, whiter than the snow. You may well know, and I'm way ahead of myself in the message, that there's something missing that there are some spots. You're just living too close to the world. You're living too distant from this message. You're living too distant from the Lord. This service is for you today. And I want to before I close, I'm going to take a few more minutes. I want to impose upon your mind and indelibly mark you that God, a sovereign act of God on this generation. and he sends as it were a little servant thrusts him out. He held him in the right hand. There were seven messengers in the right hand. Think of it, seven. And at the appointed time, God sent out the first one. Jesus had just departed, had just ascended, and soon he had seven in his hand, but he sent the first one out. And the apostle Paul and that's why there was an Apostle Paul it was he was driven and he had to go here and go there and make his journeys and establish this gospel that God had given and by divine revelation. He'd been taken into the third heaven. He could talk about the rapture being caught away. He could span the dimensions and lay down the whole the whole doctrine and write the Corinthians and the Thessalonians and the Colossians and the Ephesians and the Galatians and to write to Timothy and to Titus and to give them the instruction and he lay out almost the entire doctrine of the New Testament. And then the second one and the third one and the fourth one and down they came. And finally a Martin Luther and a Wesley. And now we have he only has one left in his hand. Only one. He's going to send them with a horn of oil. Anoint. You must anoint a people. Now you're not anointing the sons of Levi and you're not anointing Aaron the priest. You're not anointing an altar and you're not anointing something in the Holy of Holies. I've got a I I'm calling out a people and I'm going to send you with a sign that's indisputable and if they don't hear the voice of the first sign, I'll cause them to hear the voice of the second because I'll make them to even know the secret. I'll make you to know the secret of their heart. He didn't have to tell him that's the sign of the Messiah because that angel of the Lord that would be with him was telling him and instructing him. And here he came. He said he even told me the scriptures. Imagine having an angel of the Lord that God himself in a form telling a a servant what scriptures. Point them to Nathaniel. Point them to the woman at the well and let him know that's the sign of the Messiah. Tell those people it's a sign of the Messiah. Tell them it's a sign of the resurrection. Tell them this time has come. There's a certain people in the land. There's a certain people in the world and they're all over. They're in these churches. They're in the denomination. They're in these man-made cages. They're in their prisons. They're in their tombs as it were. take this voice to them &gt;&gt; and cry it out and take the horn that I have filled of the oil of the Holy Spirit for this generation and pour it out on this age. You do that. And the same one who sent the spirit of the Lord upon David from that day forward, he said, "You pour it on them and I'll put it into them." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. until the Apostle John could say, "You have an uncction." And I can say to you today, you have an uncction. You have an uncction from the Holy One. &gt;&gt; You received an uncction from the Holy One to understand what you understand, to see what you have seen. &gt;&gt; And it is a sign of the resurrection. You have had poured out onto you and into you the anointing &gt;&gt; for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Perhaps it'll be good for you to just hear this. In this church age, the message is being poured into the church. Speaks of this tabernacle. He was at his own tabernacle. He said this tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost tabernacle. There is no such a thing. I can say this building is not a Holy Ghost building. It's you that are sitting here that are Holy Ghost tabernacles who the message has been poured into. &gt;&gt; Do you accept it? You believe it with everything that's in you. individuals that come into this church are the Holy Ghost tabernacles. &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to identify yourself. &gt;&gt; I don't want you just to sit here and listen to a preacher. I want you to take those words and say, "I am that tabernacle. &gt;&gt; The altar of my heart has been anointed &gt;&gt; by the anointing of the Almighty, the Holy One of Israel has anointed me." and chosen that I should hear this message &gt;&gt; and come under the horn &gt;&gt; of the oil of the message of the hour said they are tabernacles these individuals they are tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the church in the body of a group. He says, "But what this man who was pouring the water," brother Brandon was referring to a dream that a person had, and he interpreted the dream and spoke of that dream in blasphemous names. And he says, "But what this man who was pouring the water, the messenger to the church, pouring the message &gt;&gt; into the church." Friends, &gt;&gt; you can consider myself way offbeat if you wish, but I believe it would do you good to say, "God has sent the greatest voice with the greatest sign &gt;&gt; that has ever been &gt;&gt; to me &gt;&gt; to pour into me." &gt;&gt; What devil? What devil can stand withstand that? &gt;&gt; What temptation can overcome that? When you know and you can confess that God has sent this kind of a voice to my address, to my home, to my place and poured the oil of the rapture into me. &gt;&gt; I've been anointed for rapture. &gt;&gt; Not just anointed for healing. You get healed and you die. &gt;&gt; Not just anointed for a better job or to sing a song. I've been anointed for the rapture. I've been anointed to defy death. &gt;&gt; I've been anointed to destroy death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not David who thought it up to be anointed. It's not the apostles who thought it up. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Nathaniel who thought it up. It wasn't the woman at the well who thought it up. It was God who sent it. &gt;&gt; God has sent this anointing. This uncction that you have. [Music] &gt;&gt; This anointing that you have received is not just for blessings of life. This anointing that this generation has received is to be the changed in the body. &gt;&gt; Didn't he say all that was in God, where did it go? &gt;&gt; Say it. &gt;&gt; He poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; You believe that? without any diluted. You don't dilute that. &gt;&gt; All that was in God, &gt;&gt; he poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; And all that was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He poured into the church, poured into the bride. &gt;&gt; All that was in God. &gt;&gt; And whatever was in the heart of Christ has been poured into the church. And I can tell you that the heartbeat of Christ oh is for to be united and to take this bride that he has been united to. Take her beyond this dimension of this veil of this flesh, the veil of this weak flesh and take her into his realm. Come to my home. Come to my house. Come to my place. There be no more sin. There'll be no more temptation. There'll be no more weakness. There'll be no more frailty. Hallelujah. Do you like it? Do you desire that there'll be no more? &gt;&gt; That's his promise. &gt;&gt; There'll be no more. &gt;&gt; What you experienced yesterday will never be again. &gt;&gt; There'll be no more. &gt;&gt; I can't imagine anybody wants to stay here. &gt;&gt; Can't imagine anybody who wants to stay in this world. Can't imagine anybody who wouldn't want to stand up and rejoice and say, "Oh, Brother Ed, you're speaking my language. You're speaking my heart. &gt;&gt; That's my language. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's give him a thank offering. We give you praise, oh God. We give you praise, oh God. We give you praise, oh God. Hallelujah. We give you praise, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory, [Music] &gt;&gt; how marvelous, [Music] &gt;&gt; oh blessed, blessed lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They wonderful. That's the calling. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the calling. &gt;&gt; Drink it in. &gt;&gt; The anointing that you have received. &gt;&gt; The anointing that you have received. This uncction is from the Holy One. &gt;&gt; Do not come from a man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'd like to leave you with just a little further thought before we and I want to I don't want to step out of this presence. You Stay with it. And if you're here, I'm saying very very serious thing. Now, if you're here and unmoved, unmoved by this anointing, probably is not for you. May not be for you. You say that's very s serious. Listen, it's going to be even more serious when the final finality of it all happens. There is going to be some go and there is some left behind. And when even the sheep and the goats are divided in the in the resurrection, there is some that will go to the right and some that will go to the left. I will say to this congregation, even if you feel as a servant of Christ, I speak. Even if you have the least tingle in your heart, I would respond to it. It's not to me, not to this service, not to this sermon, but I'd respond to it to the God that sent the representative with the horn of the message and poured it out in this age. And if we didn't have that message, I wouldn't really have anything to preach. I'd have some little little things and I can assure you I wouldn't be speaking. I would not be preaching. I would have given up the ministry many many years ago. We're not here for our enjoyment. We're not here because this is an easy job. We're here out of a burden for the people. Now I want to just take you one step further. Do we have a few moments? &gt;&gt; Just one step further and then I want to conclude because I said it was anointed for rapture. The Bible says because Enoch is our type. The Bible says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and he was not found because God had translated him. For before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God. And the word that is used there is a very very common word in a world of education. And it has a variety of applications. It refers to linguistics and the language and the way language and sentences are structured. It's called metathesis. Before he was metathesis, before he was translated, he had this testimony. Brother Brandham and I will come to it in a few moments. He speaks of where we are spiritually with where the world of science has gone in technology. And that science has gone and moved through all of the scientific achievement until they came to an astronaut age. And it came to an astronaut age because we were arriving at that time. The world has arrived. The world has has done various things to achieve sufficient technology, sufficient power, something that was absolutely unthinkable just a few years before. Now they're sending man beyond the grip and the hold of gravity and sending him in a pressurized container so he can go beyond the grip of the Earth. And he says, "We've had astronauts." And he refers to Enoch, which Enoch is the bride's type. He said, he said he even went up slow motion because he just started walking with God, which is what I'm speaking to a group of people today. And you're already on your way up. &gt;&gt; I announce to you, you're already on your way up. Enoch walked with God. And it may seem to you like it's slow motion, but the conclusion, the blastoff takes place. You won't have to have any physical reaction to it at all. You'll just be changed. And this what I want to speak about. &gt;&gt; And he was translated. He was metathesis. and metathesis in the chemical reaction in that realm. We won't deal with it in linguistics or language in the in the form of language or words but I want to speak of it just as it is out of the uh in in connection with the chemical reaction. A metathesis is a process in which one or more substances are changed into others. &gt;&gt; Enoch was met theis. &gt;&gt; He was walking in one substance and he was changed into another substance &gt;&gt; because he walked with God by faith. &gt;&gt; And God sends a messenger. Listen to me. Good. If I ever preached again, I want to preach this one out to the end. And God sent a messenger with a word with a word of metathesis for the people. You'll pour out this horn of oil and this horn has the power in it to change the substance. &gt;&gt; This is a metathesis message. Hang on to your seats. &gt;&gt; And metathesis also is it creates a chemical reaction in chemistry. a bi biol biular biomolecular I'm sorry biomolecular process involving the exchange of bonds between the two reacting chemical species. We're going to change our bond by this by this meth metathesis that's taking place. We've been born in sin, bound to a husband of this old nature. And now he has come with a message that divorced us from that and bonded us to Christ. &gt;&gt; It changed the bonding structure &gt;&gt; from this human existence and united us to Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This message was not a group of sermons. This isn't just 1,100. This is a message for the rapture. &gt;&gt; This horn of oil had the oil for the rapture poured out for the rapture. It has the power of metathesis in it. It'll change the chemistry. &gt;&gt; Look how scientific the prophet's message is. Where did he say you'll change? Where did he say you'll change in your atoms? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In your atoms. &gt;&gt; You have received this anointing. &gt;&gt; That's what I was called to the pullpit today to say. You have received an uncction. You have received. You have it. Will you accept it? &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? You have received the anointing, the translation, the metathesis, the change of the bond. &gt;&gt; You shall leave. You shall leave and be separated from the bond of death. &gt;&gt; You're already resurrected &gt;&gt; in Christ. anointed &gt;&gt; for the rapture. &gt;&gt; He said, "You see, the progress of the church has followed the progress of time and we've changed now from airplane to astronaut." And there's got to be a change. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a metathesis. There has to be a release of one bond &gt;&gt; in the chemistry that God gave and unite us &gt;&gt; inseparably &gt;&gt; to another one. &gt;&gt; Even Christ our husband, &gt;&gt; we're united with him. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And we've seen three changes come in the progress of transportation of power." It always takes an added power, an added power, and an added power. keep more and more and more. Says, "Why didn't the airplane get up there?" And that's when the church was there. Why didn't it get up there? Hasn't got the power to do it. The astronaut has the power. Elijah was an astronaut &gt;&gt; and he experienced a metathesis so that he could come back on Mount Transfiguration. and stand there in a body &gt;&gt; to represent those &gt;&gt; and Moses came down and he was in a body. Moses had died and came back. Elijah was translated and came back and Jesus stood there in a body and had a metathesis and was glorified. And the apostle Peter said, "And we beheld him. &gt;&gt; We saw him. We saw it happen. &gt;&gt; We beheld him. &gt;&gt; You think for a moment that this one who stood there in a glorified body would send a messenger out of his hand and say, "Here's the horn. Here's the horn of the message. Here's the horn. Pour out the revelation. Not just a bunch of sermons in a book. Not just a bunch of tapes or a bunch of discs. Pour out this anointed word into those people. until another little pastor could come up and say, "You have this uncction. You have this anointing." &gt;&gt; And I say to this congregation, young and old, give yourself to it. &gt;&gt; This is the anointing for the rapture. &gt;&gt; This isn't just some nice words. This is the anointing for the rapture. There's never been a message that's been sent to the earth for that purpose outside of this message. &gt;&gt; It has in it &gt;&gt; the content of it is the power of metathesis. It's the power of change. I have to just read this to you and then I'm done. Brother Brandham was asked a question. Will the bride be gathered in one place and will it be in the west? He says, "Nope. Don't have to be here. Don't have to be there." Yes, the bride will be gathered together in one place. That is true. but not until the resurrection. Quotes the scripture, we that are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep universally. He says, for the trump of God shall sound and the dead and Christ shall shall rise and we shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air. says the resurrection will set in first. The resurrection of those that are asleep. There will be awakening time and those which are asleep in the dust. Now, not all those that are asleep in sin because they sleep right on. They don't wake for another thousand years. But those who are sleeping in the dust will be waken first. And these corruptible bodies will put on incorruption &gt;&gt; in the rapturing grace of our Lord. &gt;&gt; This I stop here to say this uncction you have. Either that or I am found to be false and to be a liar. And I I tremble at even the thought of that. And I think of those things while I study, while I prepare. We have such a solemn responsibility to speak truth to the people. And he says, "And these incorruptible bodies will put on incorruption in the rapturing grace of our Lord." I say this message came in an abundant grace to a very wicked and adulterous generation. who now has received the sign of the Messiah and has received the sign of the resurrection. And we've had the technology to keep it real, to keep it alive, to hear the voice. They didn't hear that centuries ago. You can hear the actual voice. &gt;&gt; You can hear the shout. &gt;&gt; You don't have to think what it's like. You can hear the shout. &gt;&gt; You can feel the impulse. You can catch the divine vibration of God &gt;&gt; sent to and when you listen you used to say others have never had this. &gt;&gt; Why oh God you give it to me because he came to your house came to your place &gt;&gt; to pour the oil because it was not for their day but it is for our day. Good people, godly people, holy people, martyrs and all the rest of it. But they had a different horn poured out upon them. They had a different message. Are you with me? But we've had a horn with rapturing grace. Rapturing grace &gt;&gt; poured out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into the church. &gt;&gt; Rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you haven't even begin to experience all that is that rapturing grace because he goes on and this is the process, friends. And then we'll all get together. And when they begin to get together, then we which are alive and remain shall be changed. When they begin to get together, then we which are alive and remain shall be changed. These mortal bodies will not see death, but just of a sudden there will be like a sweep. Says another place will be changed in your atoms. There be a sweep. Go over us and you're changed. &gt;&gt; It's already been spoken. &gt;&gt; This is part that was in the horn. &gt;&gt; They didn't have this in other generations, but it was in our horn of oil. This already been poured on you children. Already been poured on you believers. Already been poured out. The power of metathesis, the power of the change, the power to loose you from one bond and to bind you to another is already here. &gt;&gt; And if you're still bound to the world, I say the power is here. Maybe you have ignored it. Maybe you haven't given yourself to it. You need to give yourself to it. You need to listen to this message. You need to hear it in the hear the word in the light of this message as though it's something that God has sent to you personally to your address to take you from this place to that place. And that's what should always be the undergirling, the underpinning thought in your mind. It's not how do I get through this day and how do I pay my bills and how do I get my car fixed. Oh friends. Oh friends, it's so far beyond that. So far beyond these little earthly things. I can tell you that once you rise into the heavenly places that God has naturally be all kinds of things come against us. There'll be hard times but in the good times we'll praise his name. And in the bad times we'll do the same and we'll just keep moving on. And then I just finished with this. You're turned back like Abraham was. See, Abraham was changed. He had the change. Enoch was changed. Jesus was changed. The seed had to fall. He said this man has spoke cruel things against him. He says he doesn't understand the seed has to has to die and rot. &gt;&gt; In order to go through a a metathesis, it has to go through and rot and come out something different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; You're turned like Abraham was from an old man to a young man, from an old woman to a young woman. What's this sudden change? And after a while, after a while, you are traveling like a thought. And you can see those then who are already resurrected. &gt;&gt; That's the process &gt;&gt; where a sweep is going to come. It's going to be a thing we don't comprehend. We don't understand it. And we're going to we're a changed in our atoms. I mean Jesus was changed in his atoms. He stood there in a glorified state, walked up the mountain, changed back and went back down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't tell me that Peter wasn't changed in his atoms. What do you He was in a prison &gt;&gt; with bars and doors and and and and and he goes through. How did he go through? He changed. &gt;&gt; I don't know. This whole gospel is the gospel of transformation. Changed. &gt;&gt; And those that have gone, they're not far away. They're here. &gt;&gt; The great host of witnesses are here. &gt;&gt; The angels are here. Your theophony is here. It's not somewhere else. Is this the truth? Is this what he preached? Is this what you believe? &gt;&gt; Say, I receive it. I receive it in the name of Jesus Christ. I receive this anointing &gt;&gt; and I'm done &gt;&gt; to say this. When David had the oil &gt;&gt; poured on his head, you're anointed for the king. And the spirit of God came on him. Dory had to go, brother Roger. He had to go back to his studio. He had to go back. He had to go back to his shape. &gt;&gt; Brother V had to go back to his landscaping or whatever he was doing. &gt;&gt; Had to just go back to his house. Had to go back and clean out the barn. Had to go to what he does. Maybe when I go home tomorrow morning's garbage morning. My wife say, "Honey, take out the garbage." I'm anointed. You sure are. There's still garbage to take out. Hallelujah. We still do what we always do, but we're anointed for the rapture. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Applause] Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to sing. Whiter than the snow. Whiter than the snow. And if you're here and still too connected and hung up with this present world, let it be separated from you now. Let a metathesis of the word of God come into you now and separate that bond &gt;&gt; now and forever. &gt;&gt; I am dead to the world. &gt;&gt; Your struggle with the world, young people, you can die to the world. And the world is not a part of you anymore. Not only young people. &gt;&gt; 638 I believe it is &gt;&gt; wetter than the snow. There's two of them. It's 658. I'm sorry. 658. Everybody feeling good? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where Marilyn got her song from. That quote, "We'll travel like a thought." Maybe she could add a verse to that. We'll travel like a thought and then &gt;&gt; we'll meet those that are resurrected. &gt;&gt; H I just got to speed up a wee bit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just got to go a little faster. &gt;&gt; Einstein almost had it. &gt;&gt; He said in his theory of relativity, if you get matter traveling at the speed of light, matter can pass through matter without disturbing the molecules of either or the atoms of either. Oh, what a glorious thing. You can pass through matter. &gt;&gt; Jesus in his resurrection in the prophecies. This message is the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; It's the sign of a group of people that's going to pass through matter, passing through matter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. our brother and sister Esther Hazel able to visit with them last Sunday and you gave me that DVD on the privileged planet and maybe some have seen it here. I'd not seen it. He said especially the special features. I'm glad you said that because I turned the special features in the privileged planet and you all were here when I showed the little pale blue dot. That's where that comes from that and the scientists that are on there have done that work and put that there. But in the special features it takes us on the earth says now we're going to start a journey. We're leaving here and we're traveling at the speed of light. Oh my, you're talking my language now. And we're just leaving here and they just start moving. We got to go through our galaxy first. And they start moving at the speed of light. Just passing this planet and passing that one. We've been three and a half minutes and we've gone so many billion miles and we've just passed Mars or we've passed and they keep going. is that we've been going for a thousand years, light years, and we're still in our galaxy. And then we start seeing other galaxies passing by. They're like stars, one one galaxy, another. And I think they finally take you till you've been traveling a billion plus, maybe 10 or 100 billion years, and you're still going &gt;&gt; that. Oh my goodness, I lost track of it now. How do you figure that one out? My father made it all. &gt;&gt; He fills it all. &gt;&gt; This great God, how he can fill all of that. And that even helped me here this morning in the message. I thought, how glorious, how do you what are we friends? And here we get down here tied up in our little world. Oh, I feel I feel so sad even about myself. You get all affected and afflicted by this little thing and that little thing and and then I then then I think of that great big I think about traveling just been a short time just a few minutes and here we are way out our God and that's what brother Bram says in the Christ the mystery of God revealed said he loved fatherhood he loved fatherhood and he had to make himself known as a son of man so we could understand him. You know what friends? I hope you see my heart. I am so thankful. I want to thank this father, our heavenly father, publicly today for not just leaving, not just leaving us with a written record of the son of man, Jesus Christ, 2,000 years ago. And we have to sit here and try. But what grace is this? They sent it across our generation &gt;&gt; so we get it as close to us as we are. And I I hope that we all are able to sweep across in the rapture. I don't know if I've ever said this, but I will say it. I don't like to say it because I want to go in the rapture. I'm counting on going in the rapture. But if God should call me away before that time, you're going to have to start having some new language in your in your vocabulary. You'll have to say, you know, I had a pastor that actually was with this prophet. I had a pastor that actually he told us about these things, but it'll be different then. You can say you have a pastor right now that's been there, saw that, felt that, was next to that angel of the Lord, sat as close as I am to these brothers while the visions were coming and have this messenger say those kind of things and speak truth. You want to take advantage of what I'm saying to you now say, "I take it. I receive it. It'll make a change in my life. I will change my I will change my activities. I'll change my priorities. I believe what has been sent to me. I believe what has been said. I have been anointed for the rapture, for the change, for the sweep, for the change of the atoms. And I am one. I am one that have been ordained to travel like a thought and to meet the resurrected of all the ages. And I don't know how many are here that can say that from their heart, but I felt that this is the message that God give me for you today. Let's stand, shall we? And before we sing, I'd like to pray with you. Lord, as we have come to this time of this service, have taken a little extra time, but I'm asking, Father, that you'll do something special. There are people that I'm burdened for. Some are present, some are not present. There's no walls that are going to hinder you or stop you. to send your spirit, I pray, into the rooms where individuals are, which I've prayed for already before I came to the pullpit, and we're praying now. There's uh certain ones that are on on the hearts of the people that are here, Lord. And we are determined. We're determined that they too must be in this rapture crowd, this host that is to be to be taken and caught up to meet the Lord in the air. Father, I have poured out, oh God, what you poured into my heart. And now send this upon these people, even in a greater reality, I pray. And for those, Lord, that something stands in their way. May they be washed even now as we sing this song. May they take it as a prayer. May they appropriate it. And may the Holy Spirit, you're not done, Lord, with this service. We may be counting on closing it fairly soon, but you're not done. And I pray that your presence will go with the people long after they have departed the sanctuary. In Jesus Christ's name, I commit it to you now, Lord. Amen. Blessed be the fountain of a world. Blessed be the dear son of God. Only by his stripes we are healed. Though I wondered far from his bringing to my heart pain and wambow [Applause] [Music] [Music] than the Wash me in the blood of the lamb and I shall be wer [Music] and his body or grievous words [Music] in vain. Oh, may I fans my sins here below. Wash me in the blood that he shed and I shall be snow. [Music] than the snow. Wash me in the blood of the lamb and I shall be wher [Music] I am from thee of my heart [Music] do my sins to me can wash them Jesus to the mountain of [Music] thy promise I hope by [Music] shall be than the snow. [Music] Wash me in the blood of the lamb and I shall be. [Music] As I sang this song to myself this morning and sang this third verse, I thought that it is certainly relevant to our lives. If you please put up the third verse. This world is so intent, so determined to cause us to wander, to be distracted. And I thought this writer was certainly had the mind of God. Often is my heart gone astray. Crimson do my sins, I'm glad to say, seem to me. Our errors, our mistakes, our sins, the things we do wrong, and none of us are immune to it. And that's what Satan would love to use as a tool to condemn. I deny him that right. for the next line. Jesus, to that fountain of thine, &gt;&gt; leaning on thy promise I go. &gt;&gt; Cleanse me by thy washing divine. And the conclusion, and I shall be whiter than snow. &gt;&gt; Lord spoke to my heart today, friends, people sitting right here. I didn't preach this message in vain. There's some that are right here now and you need to enter into the whole experience of this anointed verse. I will now go to the fountain. I will now be released. I will give myself to this oil of this horn of the message that's been poured out. How many here? You really believe and you have felt you have felt the effects of the oil being poured out on you of this message. How many you're not ashamed to raise your hand? Say, "I felt that effect." Those of you that couldn't raise your hand, I'm looking at you. You should you should be able to raise your hand. You should have enough in you to say it's been poured out on me. And if you can't, then I'm going to sing this song and I'm going to pray this prayer that you will be able to. Everybody put their hands down. How many were not able to raise their hand, but I want to. I want to be able to do it. Don't be ashamed. Raise your hand up. I would like to be able to. No one. Well, if you couldn't raise your hand and you don't raise your hand, I have great fear in my heart. How would you expect a rapture? I could ask the next thing. Do you want to go in the rapture? Only a fool would say, I I don't want to go in the rapture. What kind of a person would say I don't want to go to heaven? There are some I suppose. You may be taking up a good seat where a believer wants to sit. Say, "Brother Ed, you've never spoken like that, but we've come to that time." either mean business with God in the vision of this congregation, the vision of this message, or go find yourself a place, but you feel aligned to. &gt;&gt; This is not your place. And I say to this congregation, if you hear anything that's outside of the vision that God has given to us in this message, you refuse it and have no fellowship with it whatsoever. &gt;&gt; We're far too far along. It was far too serious at time. I'll say something else to you now that I'm on the subject. Somebody says to you, "Well, I know things that are wrong. There isn't one person in this congregation that I can't find something wrong with." &gt;&gt; And if you're honest, you can't find, you know, your own life. There's something wrong with your own life. So, what good is it? Have we been I authorize you? Have we been authorized by God to find something wrong with the people? &gt;&gt; No, that isn't it. You've been authorized of God to be a brother, to be a sister that knows how to pray. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you find something, if you find a a person in need, you pray for them." &gt;&gt; And if it still remains there, I said, "You ought to pray some more." Then God hasn't heard your prayer. &gt;&gt; You does this congregation believe that. &gt;&gt; We're trying to get a people ready. I'm expending my energy. I'm expending my life as an old man, expending my life that you'll go in the rapture. And I need to announce to you today, you've been anointed for it. You received an uncction from the Holy One of Israel to be in the rapture. And if you don't make it, don't blame me. Don't blame this preacher. I preached everything that I got in my heart. You've been anointed for this rapture. &gt;&gt; God sent a little messenger. what he went through, his toil and his labors. And I I bow my head in shame when I think how he traveled on old prop planes through thunderstorms of Africa and think that I fly on jets far above it. I think, oh God, I don't I'm not deserving of this message. I'm not deserving of this servant. I'm not deserving of the efforts. The same as I don't feel deserving of the martyrs of ages past. But that was their life. That was their day. That was their oil that was poured on them. We've been anointed &gt;&gt; by a message. &gt;&gt; You have received that uncction. &gt;&gt; You have received that. Walk like kings. &gt;&gt; Walk like the anointed ones. &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God. You believe him? &gt;&gt; Do you believe him? Do you believe what he said over you? Not that I'm trying to make you feel good. You believe what he said? You're Messiah. He's the anointed one, our Lord Jesus Christ. And you are anointed because of him. &gt;&gt; You're the anointed &gt;&gt; sent to this generation. &gt;&gt; And perhaps God's dealing with you. I just urge you to give yourself to him now. It's between you and him. Father, I have wondered from thee. often has my heart single [Music] on thy proise. Cleanse me by thy washing and I shall be wer than snow. [Music] than the snow. Wash me in the blood of the lamb and I shall &gt;&gt; wash me in the blood. Wash me in the blood of the lamb and I [Music] wash in the blood of the lamb. [Music] &gt;&gt; Come by here, my Lord. Come by here. [Music] Come here. My [Music] Come by [Music] my pray. [Music] Someone's great come [Music] With every head bowed, please and our eyes closed in reverence and respect to this one. No one moving around. Please don't leave the sanctuary. Perhaps you didn't have the conviction or the strength or the you wanted to be honest and you couldn't raise your hand. But deep in your heart of hearts, there is a cry for truth, for righteousness, for deliverance, for a walk with God. something that perhaps you had do not have right now and have not had for a long time. And others of you may say, I need to draw so much closer than I have been. I need to I really need to tighten up the res. I need to get the things arranged in a different order and get ready for this crossing over. I need to feed myself on this word that has been sent to strengthen myself in the inner man. And I need to cut and sever myself from certain relationships, certain friendships, and from the enemy that is haunting and tempting me. I turn from him and I deny him this right because I know I'm a child of God. If I have described you and you wish to raise your hand, I will pray with you and for you. Almighty, righteous, kind heavenly father, with mercy that is new every day. Oh longsuffering one, patient, patient you are. You see us, Lord, as we seek to make our way through life. Do you see how the howling of the enemy has come against some dear ones, precious ones, some of your children, oh God, and I'm giving now myself with all that is in my heart and soul to pray for them. I pray that there will be a release of the Holy Spirit upon them. And I pray there will be a release of the grip of the enemy upon their lives. For I address you, Satan, in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the Lord Jesus Christ. Take your hand off of God's property. You have no right. And the church of the living God calls for you to be defeated and to depart. Some may be in the visible audience, some may not be in the visible audience, but you know, oh God, you're not restricted to time or space. And so we pray for those that your sons and daughters are praying for. Bring them into a deliverance, oh God. Bring them, I pray, into the way of truth and into the way of life. Separate them from the bond of the enemy and the bondages of sin. &gt;&gt; Oh God, let a meththesis take place. Oh Lord, I pray and there'll be a change. And now, Father, thank you for this praying people. Thank you for their hunger and sincere desire for the many miles that they drive in the time they give to be here. And may this day be solely dedicated to you. I pray, Father, lives will be healed, bodies will be healed, &gt;&gt; homes will be healed, oh God, and may we dwell in the full inheritance that you've intended for us. I thank you for the prayers of your people, Lord. May they continue to pray more than they have in the past. May they pray for the ministry. We pray for the service tonight. Oh God, come and do the spontaneous and the unexpected amongst us. Lord, bless this people, I pray, and dismiss us with your grace in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. And while we greet one another, I'd like you to sing the song in truth. Somebody's praying. me. No, brother Brandham had the people in the tape I just heard last night. He had the people actually lay hands on one another, just touch one another, say, "No, somebody's praying for them." But as you shake hands with the people today, as many as you can and say it sincerely and say it with meaning and when God brings them to your thought, to your mind, say prayer for them. I think the church would be much much strengthened if we prayed for one another without ceasing. We shake hands with one another now and God dismiss you in Jesus name. Someone's praying. [Music] God bless you, brother Tom. God bless you. Praise [Music] the Lord.
