64-0823E Questions And Answers #2: William Marrion Branham Message Library
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's Jesus Christ revealing Him just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right now that's scripture also brother Brandon I believe a woman should be subject to her husband but if a Christian woman has a sinner husband who does not even to one of your services come to one of your services and want and wants his wife to be doing things cutting her hair wearing shorts and going to ungodly places even is this woman supposed to be subject to this man in this way please explain this more clearly as this is a question that is asked often no sister you are not subject to such a person no indeed for this cause you'll leave everything in cleave to God now the thing if you want that man wants to live with you and you be stay a Christian but if he's going to make you wear shorts cut your hair and do all these other things in ungodly places you seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness you're not bound to such a person as that but as long the Bible says as she is pleased and he is pleased to dwell together you remember that let them and now these I didn't put the scriptures out because I just picked them up you see if a few minutes ago I pick up one now and then that I haven't got time but Paul said that as long as they unbelieving husband has unbelieving or believing wife or so forth let the believing wife remain with the believing husband as long as is not contrary now to God if he's pleased to dwell with her go ahead honey if you want to go to church that's all right but I ain't going I don't believe in I don't have nothing to do with it but you go ahead that's all right but when he says you can't do it there's a different thing you're not bound to that then you separate everything for God
