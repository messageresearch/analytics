[1:39] Oh, this is my song.
[1:45] Praising my savior
[1:50] all the day long. Oh, let's sing the
[1:54] chorus again. For this is my story.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; This is my song.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my song.
[2:09] &gt;&gt; We're praising you this morning, Lord.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; We give this day unto you, oh God.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; This is my story.
[2:20] Oh, this is my song.
[2:26] Praising my Savior
[2:31] all the day long.
[2:35] [Music]
[2:36] Praise the Lord. Good to be in the house
[2:38] of the Lord this morning. Good to be
[2:40] gathered with you knowing that you have
[2:42] the same desire.
[2:44] Amen. Desire to see him high and lifted
[2:47] up. Praises of his people. Why don't we
[2:49] We're going to have a special this
[2:50] morning. Why don't you come and get
[2:51] ready? We'll just sing glory to his
[2:54] name. Down at the cross where my savior
[2:57] died, down where for cleansing. Amen.
[3:08] Oh, down at the cross where my s
[3:13] Oh, down where for cleansing from sin I

[4:38] the Lord.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; Good to be serving the Lord,
[4:43] walking with him. There's no life like
[4:46] it.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So glad for his mercy and
[4:50] grace in my life. And I'm sure that you
[4:52] all agree.
[4:55] like to sing about his grace this
[4:56] morning. This song's been going through
[4:59] my head um probably for a couple weeks
[5:02] now. I've sang it before, but um
[5:05] uh since brother Ed spoke on grace,
[5:09] grace,
[5:10] [Music]
[5:12] oh my, it's wonderful.
[5:16] They say beauties
[5:19] in the eye of the beholder.
[5:25] You can only
[5:28] believe
[5:30] what you see.
[5:32] [Music]
[5:34] If you're looking
[5:36] through eyes of compassion,
[5:41] you'll see a reflection
[5:45] of what I used to be.
[5:52] When you're looking
[5:54] at me,
[5:56] you see mercy.
[5:58] [Music]
[6:00] When you're looking
[6:03] at me, you see grace.
[6:09] When you're looking
[6:11] at me,
[6:13] you see save.
[6:18] For I've been saved by his mercy and
[6:23] grace
[6:24] [Applause]
[6:25] [Music]
[6:27] in life's mirror. It's that same old
[6:32] reflection.
[6:36] The changes
[6:38] are far beyond
[6:40] human side.
[6:44] So, I'm trying to show you a reflection
[6:51] of his love and how he's turned all my
[6:56] darkness into light.
[7:02] When you're looking
[7:04] at me,
[7:06] you see mercy.
[7:10] Oh, when you're looking
[7:13] at me, you see grace.
[7:17] [Music]
[7:20] When you're looking
[7:22] at me, you see save.
[7:28] For I've been saved by his mercy and
[7:33] grace. Sing it together with me.
[7:37] Oh, when you're looking
[7:40] at me,
[7:42] you see mercy.
[7:46] When you're looking
[7:49] at me, you see grace.
[7:55] When you're looking
[7:58] at me, you see save.
[8:04] For I've been saved by his mercy
[8:09] and grace.
[8:13] Yes, I've been saved by his mercy and
[8:18] grace.
[8:20] [Applause]
[8:25] &gt;&gt; It's my word.
[8:27] Praise the Lord.
[8:30] Wonderful atmosphere and the Lord comes.
[8:33] Amen. Give ear to my word, oh Lord.
[8:44] Consider
[8:46] my meditation.
[8:49] [Music]
[8:53] Hearken unto the voice of my cry.
[9:00] my king
[9:03] and my God.
[9:08] For unto
[9:11] thee will I pray
[9:16] my voice shall thou hear in the morning.
[9:23] [Music]
[9:24] Oh Lord in the morning
[9:28] will I direct my prayer unto thee and
[9:34] will
[9:40] give ear to my word. Oh,
[9:48] consider
[9:50] my meditation.

[15:42] Hallelujah.
[15:44] Bless your name, Lord. Brother Dave
[15:47] Jabberov, why don't you come and lead us
[15:50] in prayer together this morning? We want
[15:51] to remember brother Phil Longghurst from
[15:55] South Wales is going in for a testing
[15:59] for some cancer. Testimony from Sister
[16:01] Grace Speedy thanking the Lord for
[16:03] touching her headaches. He's the
[16:05] dissolver not only of doubts, the
[16:07] dissolver of headaches. Any affliction
[16:09] that we may have, we know he's the bomb
[16:11] in Gilead. Brother Dave, why don't you
[16:13] come?
[16:14] [Music]
[16:18] Let's pray.
[16:20] [Music]
[16:25] Lord Jesus, we sense such a sacred
[16:27] atmosphere here this morning, Father.
[16:31] And Lord, we count it a great honor and
[16:33] a great privilege to
[16:35] be called in this hour to be able to
[16:37] come and to enjoy this sacred
[16:41] presence. Lord Jesus, what a great holy
[16:44] and high calling that we have been
[16:46] called with, Lord.
[16:49] Father, we want to exalt your holy name
[16:51] this morning, Lord, as we stand in the
[16:54] the land of the living with the
[16:56] redeemed. Father,
[16:58] we want to lift up you, the only true
[17:00] and living God, Lord.
[17:03] Father, we don't have this presence down
[17:05] at the hockey arena. We don't have it at
[17:08] work. There's very few places we're
[17:11] going to find this, Lord. But we found
[17:13] it this morning, Lord.
[17:16] We desire to draw nigh unto you, Lord
[17:18] Jesus, this morning. Would you draw nigh
[17:20] unto us, Lord?
[17:22] We want to walk in the light, Lord, as
[17:24] you are in the light. Father,
[17:27] we're praying this morning, Lord, if you
[17:28] will show us more light, we will walk in
[17:32] it, Lord Jesus. We pray just show us a
[17:35] little more light, Lord, and we'll take
[17:38] another step forward into that light,
[17:40] Lord.
[17:42] Bless this gathering. It's a unique
[17:44] gathering. There's those that are
[17:45] visiting. It might not always be just
[17:48] this way as it is this morning, Lord.
[17:50] And you have a mind for this service.
[17:53] Bless your word.
[17:56] Take your servant, Lord Jesus, in the
[17:59] very palm of your hand, Lord. And I
[18:01] pray, God, that he would speak the very
[18:04] mind of Christ for this meeting, Lord.
[18:08] Here am I, Lord Jesus. We pray. Speak to
[18:10] each one of us. Lord, bless the needs
[18:13] that have been mentioned.
[18:15] And we just pray, God, that faith would
[18:17] rise in our hearts to accept every need
[18:20] that we each have in our lives this
[18:22] morning, Lord, as we commit this entire
[18:24] day into your hands, thanking you for
[18:27] your mercy once more, Lord, in Jesus'
[18:30] name. Amen.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:33] Amen. God bless you each and everyone.
[18:36] You may have your seats this morning.
[18:41] Praise the Lord. We've got uh couple of
[18:44] quick announcements. We've got a baby
[18:46] dedication this morning as our numbers
[18:49] are added too.
[18:51] Uh we want to welcome Brother Don Bailey
[18:53] from Manchester, England. Brother Don,
[18:55] where are you at? Met you on Friday, I
[18:58] believe. Brother Don, God bless you.
[19:01] Welcome to the service this morning.
[19:06] Amen. My brother Brian is here visiting
[19:08] with us. Brian, why don't you stand?
[19:10] Greet brother Brian this morning.
[19:13] Anybody else that's visiting with us, we
[19:15] want to make sure that you certainly
[19:16] feel welcome in the presence of the Lord
[19:18] in the sanctuary of the people this
[19:20] morning. Amen. We've got a um an
[19:24] announcement that's on the back bulletin
[19:25] board. How many remember we had the
[19:27] little talk on Turkey
[19:30] a couple of weeks ago? So now there's a
[19:32] further announcement of um a little more
[19:35] commitment as to when the dates might
[19:37] be. So, if you attended the meeting and
[19:39] you signed up on the roster, there's an
[19:41] envelope with your name on it. If you
[19:43] haven't already received it, you can
[19:44] pick it up at the office uh by the tape
[19:46] library there. And if you weren't able
[19:49] to attend or didn't put your name on the
[19:51] list yet, you'd like more information,
[19:53] make sure that you pick up one of these
[19:54] brochures that's pinned on the bulletin
[19:56] board just outside of the office window.
[20:01] Brother Chris Merittz, your wife and
[20:04] little one, why don't you come? We'll
[20:06] ask our pastor to come. Maybe we'll just
[20:08] sing. Bring them in. Bring them in.
[20:10] Bring the little ones to Jesus. Trust
[20:12] that you feel good this morning. Amen.
[20:15] It's really good to be here.
[20:20] Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them
[20:26] in from the fields of sin.
[20:30] Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the
[20:36] wandering ones to Jesus.
[20:39] Oh, bring them in. Bring them in. Bring
[20:45] them in. From the fields of sin, bring
[20:49] them in. Bring them in. Bring the
[20:54] wondering ones to Jesus.
[20:58] [Music]
[21:04] Amen.
[21:06] Well, the congregation is growing
[21:09] and brother Chris and sister Brenda's
[21:12] family is growing.
[21:14] That's lovely.
[21:17] Amen. Uh,
[21:20] Brother Chris and Sister Brenda have a
[21:24] daughter
[21:26] and uh, they have named her Sonia Joy.
[21:30] Sonia's wisdom. I pray that she'll be a
[21:33] wise, wise one. And joy doesn't need any
[21:37] interpretation. That's just plain joy.
[21:40] Amen. Pleasure, happiness.
[21:44] We pray that that's what she will be in
[21:47] this family. Brother Chris, Sister
[21:49] Brenda,
[21:51] uh I had some definite thoughts about
[21:54] this uh baby dedication
[21:57] and it was I began to think of what was
[22:01] in God's mind.
[22:03] I often think about God's thoughts and
[22:06] God's mind. What was in his mind when he
[22:09] gave this child to you?
[22:13] And uh God spoke through Jeremiah and
[22:15] said, "I know the thoughts that I think
[22:17] toward you,
[22:19] say the Lord. Thoughts of peace and not
[22:21] of evil
[22:23] to give you an expected end." I thought
[22:26] about this family. I thought about
[22:28] brother Chris and sister Brenda and what
[22:30] was he thinking? What was God actually
[22:32] thinking when he gave this child and has
[22:35] a certain nature and certain talents and
[22:39] so on and and then
[22:42] because he does nothing without a
[22:44] purpose and it says every good gift
[22:46] comes from the father of lights
[22:51] cometh down from the father of lights.
[22:54] And then I thought
[22:57] now what what is in your mind? What is
[23:01] in your thoughts in bringing this gift
[23:04] that God has given?
[23:08] What what is in your thoughts that now I
[23:11] giving her back? We're going to dedicate
[23:13] her to the Lord.
[23:15] And the scripture says this, and I know
[23:17] you're very well acquainted with this
[23:19] scripture,
[23:20] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[23:22] great and precious promises, that by
[23:25] these we might be the partakers. we
[23:28] including her now might be partakers of
[23:32] the divine nature
[23:34] having escaped the corruption that is in
[23:36] the world through lust. This child will
[23:37] grow up in a world that's full of
[23:39] corruption.
[23:41] But God has entrusted to you, brother
[23:43] Chris, sister Brenda, the promises,
[23:46] precious, precious promises that by
[23:49] these she can be the partaker of the
[23:52] divine nature that will keep her and
[23:55] protect her from the world and the
[23:57] corruption that's in the world. And so
[23:59] he has given to you and is asking you to
[24:02] be very very diligent that you will add
[24:05] not only to yourselves but by adding to
[24:07] yourselves you will also add to her
[24:10] because you will be having as the
[24:13] prophet said great influence on her
[24:15] life. You will demonstrate and show her
[24:17] faith.
[24:19] You will show her virtue.
[24:21] You will show her knowledge. You will
[24:24] show her temperance. You will show her
[24:26] patience. You will show her demon you
[24:29] will demonstrate godliness and you will
[24:32] show her brotherly kindness and quite
[24:35] honestly that is my full belief that by
[24:39] showing those you are actually applying
[24:41] the token to her.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; I believe that
[24:45] &gt;&gt; and I believe if that's in your hearts
[24:47] now as we bring her Sonia Joy to the
[24:50] Lord we're going to dedicate her to
[24:52] Christ. Amen.
[25:01] We'll bow in prayer.
[25:04] Heavenly Father, what a gracious
[25:07] and good and lovely father you are. You
[25:11] love fatherhood. Your prophet has said,
[25:14] "And now you have given this child, this
[25:17] gift,
[25:18] priceless gift to brother Chris and
[25:21] sister Brenda. And they are now not only
[25:24] dedicating her but dedicating themselves
[25:28] &gt;&gt; to bring her up and to rear her and to
[25:30] train her to show and to demonstrate
[25:33] this godly life that you have given. I
[25:36] pray that they will be steadfast in the
[25:38] faith and show her that steadfastness
[25:40] that they will demonstrate that faith
[25:42] and virtue and knowledge and temperance
[25:44] and patience and brotherly kindness. May
[25:47] they show all of these virtues, oh God,
[25:49] that she will have such an example
[25:51] that'll stay with her all through her
[25:53] life. And that she will have such a
[25:55] desire, Lord, created by the Holy Spirit
[25:58] in her to be that kind of a person, to
[26:01] be that kind of a girl, to be that kind
[26:03] of a woman. If you should, Terry, I pray
[26:05] you'll make her an example. I ask that
[26:08] you'll give her good life, good health.
[26:11] And I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus
[26:13] Christ, that you will now receive her as
[26:15] I hold her as you would, Lord Jesus, and
[26:19] dedicate her to you and ask your
[26:21] blessings upon her. Blessings upon
[26:24] Brother Chris, blessings upon Sister
[26:26] Brenda as they rear her and nurture her
[26:30] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[26:31] Christ. We dedicate Sonia Joy back to
[26:35] you, the giver of this gift. in Jesus
[26:39] Christ's name. Amen.
[26:42] Amen.
[26:47] Well, I hope she remembers this.
[26:50] God bless you, brother. God bless you,
[26:52] Brother Chris. Amen.
[26:55] God bless you.
[27:01] Amen.
[27:03] It's a good day. It's always a good day
[27:06] when we can be in his presence, isn't
[27:07] it?
[27:09] Wonderful.
[27:11] Uh,
[27:12] I was pleasantly surprised to see
[27:17] brother Derek Greeter, brother Don
[27:19] Bailey. God bless you, brother Don. Nice
[27:21] to have you once again. It's been a long
[27:23] time.
[27:24] And then our
[27:27] you I'm a little bit horsearo, but I
[27:29] guess that will be all right. If it's if
[27:31] it's all right with you, it's all right
[27:32] with me.
[27:34] Our
[27:36] brother Nathan was up and singing. I
[27:39] hadn't heard that song before, but I had
[27:42] some scriptures and uh this isn't part
[27:45] of the service. It was part of the
[27:47] message and I thought
[27:50] uh no, I think it might be distracting
[27:53] to the people if I because it's not, you
[27:56] know, it's a part of the service. It's a
[27:57] part of the message, but it's a part
[28:00] that I can uh uh just forego this time
[28:02] and maybe go into it later on because
[28:04] it's it's a marvelous truth within
[28:07] itself. And then after hearing brother
[28:09] Nathan's song, I thought, no, I'm going
[28:11] to just read those scriptures first. Uh
[28:14] uh before we even get into the message,
[28:17] the apostle Paul has said
[28:20] unto Timothy, my son, my own son in the
[28:24] faith, grace, mercy, and peace from God
[28:30] the Father, and Jesus Christ our Lord.
[28:33] He said in second Timothy to Timothy my
[28:36] dearly beloved son, grace, mercy, and
[28:41] peace
[28:42] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our
[28:46] Lord. And to Titus, he said to Titus uh
[28:50] my own son after the common faith,
[28:53] grace,
[28:55] mercy, and peace from God the Father and
[28:59] the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. And
[29:03] then in Hebrews he said, "Let us
[29:05] therefore come boldly
[29:07] unto the throne of grace that we may
[29:11] obtain
[29:13] mercy." I've been pondering very very
[29:15] much as I've been speaking about grace
[29:19] and our stewardship of grace and about
[29:24] the mercy seat which I want to speak on
[29:27] today about the mercy seat.
[29:30] And so often I think that perhaps grace
[29:32] itself is uh uh misunderstood
[29:36] because I've heard the phrase the free
[29:39] gift of grace. But really grace is not a
[29:42] gift. Grace is actually favor.
[29:46] Favor that is shown. That's God's God's
[29:49] part. Strictly on God's part. We have
[29:51] nothing to do with it. It's strictly on
[29:54] God's part that he shows favor. And then
[29:57] when he shows favor, we on whom he shows
[30:01] favor, they are the recipients or the
[30:05] potential recipients
[30:08] of a gift. And that's why apostle Paul
[30:12] says grace,
[30:14] mercy, and when God showed grace to the
[30:17] world, the greatest greatest expression
[30:20] of grace was when he sent Jesus Christ.
[30:24] So when he sent Jesus Christ, he sent
[30:27] him that was his grace full of grace and
[30:30] truth. But then through him he was able
[30:32] to show mercy.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we receive mercy, we have
[30:40] peace.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; So that's really the process and I think
[30:45] that's wonderful. I'm going to ask you
[30:47] to stand if you would and we're going to
[30:49] go directly to the word.
[30:52] Thank you musicians. God bless you.
[31:08] While while you're standing and others
[31:10] are still coming in, would you like to
[31:13] quickly see a few pictures of the Moscow
[31:16] church?
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Can we show those,
[31:20] please? or do I need to do it?
[31:25] If you can just show them for me, I
[31:27] would be happy.
[31:34] Maybe we could dim the lights so they
[31:36] can see them a little bit easier. This
[31:38] is this is as of this week and uh the uh
[31:42] the people here and others we can just
[31:45] click through them. These brothers are
[31:47] working in the midst of winter as you
[31:49] can see.
[31:55] They're really bundled up, working hard.
[31:57] This is the This is the roof over the
[31:59] first section over the bottom
[32:04] uh bottom floor.
[32:08] These people have contributed not only
[32:11] their labor, they've contributed
[32:13] whatever they could of their funds as
[32:15] well. So there you see a bit of the
[32:20] uh length of it. You can see
[32:23] now they were going to put just a normal
[32:25] roof on that and uh brother Sergey was
[32:29] visiting uh in Ria in Latvia and was
[32:34] with a pastor who who I know brother
[32:36] Gregory uh Gregor and uh Pietzvich
[32:42] and uh brother Pietzvich is a
[32:45] construction man and he said uh he said
[32:48] it's much better if you just go straight
[32:49] up and uh and don't put that kind of
[32:53] roof on it. Then you'll gain more space
[32:55] and you can do that for six more
[32:57] truckloads of cement blocks. Now that's
[33:00] the inside of the bottom floor there.
[33:02] But they would be able to get a second
[33:04] floor and uh so that's what they're
[33:06] going to do. And then they they gave an
[33:08] offering also to help them. They gave
[33:11] them I think €2,000
[33:13] which is almost one and a half times or
[33:16] more our our currency. and uh they're
[33:19] moving forward with that. But this is
[33:22] really wonderful. And the and the saints
[33:24] there in Moscow had saved their money
[33:27] and bought this piece of land. It's off
[33:30] towards the airport and it cost about
[33:32] $80,000. And I think that is really
[33:34] remarkable for those people. There are
[33:37] other people that have sent some funds.
[33:39] We have sent now $56,000.
[33:42] We have about another $2,000 that has
[33:45] come in US
[33:47] at US at that US funds and u and I have
[33:52] committed to send some more to them so
[33:54] they can uh put that second floor on and
[33:58] uh I believe that we'd like to see them
[34:00] be able to be in this building and using
[34:02] it before another winter comes. Lord
[34:05] Jesus terries. Amen. All right, that's
[34:08] just fine. Thank you for the uh is there
[34:12] one could you go to the last one and
[34:14] show the brothers that have been working
[34:15] there please?
[34:21] There they are. And uh over on this side
[34:24] right here on to my left here is brother
[34:28] Sergey.
[34:31] Amen. Thank you.
[34:36] Now, if you will uh you can open your
[34:38] Bibles if you would please to the uh
[34:42] 25th chapter of Exodus.
[34:50] And just before we read, I'll ask you to
[34:54] bow your heads and with me so we can
[34:56] have a word of prayer.
[35:02] Dear father, we have so much to be
[35:03] thankful for
[35:05] today that we can be gathered together
[35:09] here in this sanctuary,
[35:11] a place that we many years ago dedicated
[35:14] to you. I have been thinking of the time
[35:18] when our brother Don Alexander put a
[35:20] shovel into the earth and and turned it
[35:23] over and we had a dedication of the
[35:26] ground. And now we see, dear Lord, that
[35:29] there are people that it's it's a it's
[35:32] an honor for us to be able to assist
[35:34] them, that they can come together,
[35:35] precious brothers and sisters in Christ.
[35:39] And we just pray that you'll remember
[35:41] them that are in Moscow, oh God. These
[35:44] believers that have uh been without a
[35:46] pastor for some time and now our brother
[35:48] Sergey, I pray you'll anoint him, oh
[35:50] God, and use him mightily. and all the
[35:52] churches that are assisting in Europe
[35:54] and and uh that are being such a
[35:57] strength and a and a blessing to them.
[36:00] We're asking also, Father, that you'll
[36:02] remember in a special way our brother
[36:04] Tony and sister Rebecca. Dear Lord, we
[36:07] ask, oh God, that you will open doors
[36:09] where doors are closed, that you will
[36:11] close the doors that uh that should not
[36:14] be open. We pray that you will open the
[36:16] hearts of the people. We pray that
[36:19] you'll create a hunger, oh God, and that
[36:21] you'll make a way where there seems to
[36:24] be no way. We pray, Father, that uh it
[36:27] would be our desire to see this message,
[36:30] to see it in the language of the people
[36:33] that they could their eyes could behold
[36:36] the words that have been so transforming
[36:39] in our lives. Surely Lord, they have a
[36:43] they have a right, I believe, to do
[36:45] that. and how they governments and how
[36:48] powers and try to restrict and hinder
[36:52] your word from coming to the people.
[36:54] When we think of that, we think of
[36:55] brother John Stall, Lord, who we just
[36:58] prayed for this last week and his
[37:01] grandchildren that are with him. Such
[37:03] examples of this message. We are so
[37:06] happy. We are so thankful. We are so
[37:09] proud of the standard, oh God, that the
[37:12] life that's within the revealed word of
[37:14] God brings. Father, it is not our doing.
[37:17] It is your doing. And as we heard our
[37:19] brother Nathan saying, truly it's mercy
[37:22] and grace. Truly, oh God, there's
[37:24] nothing that we could contribute. We can
[37:26] only give ourselves and here we stand
[37:28] today, Lord. We give ourselves as a
[37:31] entire congregation. We give ourselves
[37:34] and yield ourselves to the moving of the
[37:36] Holy Spirit. We say, Father, say what
[37:39] you would say, we will receive it. Move
[37:41] as you would move, and we will move with
[37:43] you, oh God. Tell us what you would like
[37:46] us to do, Lord. And we say, "Here am I.
[37:49] Send me. Here am I, oh God." We're here
[37:52] to do your bidding. I pray, Father,
[37:55] you'll open our hearts and our ears, our
[37:57] understanding. And I pray that the s
[37:59] that the word will penetrate down the
[38:01] channel to our soul, and we will say,
[38:04] "Lord, I do believe." Amen.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thy will be done on earth as it is
[38:09] in heaven. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[38:11] anoint us each one for our respective
[38:13] duty. I thank you Jesus. Amen.
[38:21] Now I also have
[38:26] some slides of some scripture and we're
[38:28] going to read our scripture on the
[38:30] slide. While you have your Bible, you
[38:32] can keep your Bible open.
[38:58] And let them make me a sanctuary
[39:02] that I may dwell among them. That's
[39:05] Exodus 25 and8.
[39:09] 25-17.
[39:11] And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure
[39:14] gold.
[39:16] Two cubits and a half shall be the
[39:18] length thereof, and a cubit and a half
[39:22] the breadth thereof.
[39:24] and 25 and 21. And thou shalt put the
[39:28] mercy seat above upon the ark,
[39:32] and in the ark thou shalt put the
[39:34] testimony that I shall give thee.
[39:38] 25 and 22.
[39:41] And there I will meet with thee, and I
[39:44] will commune with thee from above the
[39:46] mercy seat, from between the two
[39:49] cherubams, which are upon the ark of the
[39:52] testimony of all things which I give
[39:55] thee in commandment unto the children of
[39:59] Israel.
[40:01] And then here we have once again the uh
[40:05] mercy seat. Now you may have your seats
[40:08] and we'll leave this uh up here for a
[40:11] few moments.
[40:14] Uh
[40:17] I want to speak on the mercy seat but
[40:20] it's it's it's in a completely I'm sure
[40:24] uh different from perhaps what you
[40:26] expect.
[40:28] Uh these verses
[40:31] contain some elements very very
[40:33] significant and extremely important
[40:37] uh elements for us in our time
[40:42] right now today having to do with the
[40:44] message they're important and extremely
[40:48] important because and these are these
[40:51] are the uh the things that I want to uh
[40:55] bring together. There's a at her here's
[40:58] the elements that tabernacle
[41:01] you'll make me a sanctuary. The
[41:03] sanctuary was the holy of holies in the
[41:04] tabernacle
[41:07] the ark of the commandments and the
[41:10] commandments that were in them
[41:13] and the mercy seat which was above. And
[41:16] the mercy seat as you see here is it
[41:20] actually the mercy seat is the slab.
[41:25] And the word mercy seat there there is
[41:28] no particular word in the Hebrew for
[41:30] seat but it is it simply meant covering
[41:35] and that is extremely significant. It
[41:38] was a covering.
[41:40] So if you can just follow this process
[41:44] now in the ark is the words of
[41:49] commandment which nobody could keep.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; So in the ark is the words that
[41:57] condemned the entire people of Israel
[42:01] because no one could keep them.
[42:04] But on top over the that's why it says
[42:07] you put them above
[42:10] because on top is a slab and it happens
[42:13] to be pure gold
[42:16] and it is covering
[42:18] the word that the people couldn't keep.
[42:21] So the contents condemned them. The
[42:26] mercy seat was the place of propitiation
[42:29] or the place where God would acknowledge
[42:32] that he has that he has uh he he has
[42:36] satisfied
[42:38] the commandment.
[42:40] He has satisfied God command God
[42:42] satisfied it. And so in the Old
[42:44] Testament
[42:46] I I feel if I get this now then if you
[42:49] get this then we'll we'll be really uh
[42:52] uh it'll be much easier the rest of the
[42:54] service. So now God in the Old
[42:57] Testament, they took the blood of bulls
[42:59] and goats.
[43:01] And so once a year, the high priest who
[43:04] has been appointed, now that's an
[43:06] office, not the prophet, not Moses the
[43:08] prophet, but the priest, the office of
[43:10] the priest, he went in the high priest
[43:13] once a year
[43:15] and and sprinkled the mercy seat with
[43:18] blood, which was an animal. Now the
[43:22] animal was an animal that God had given.
[43:25] So it wasn't anything the people could
[43:27] do. The people could not create that
[43:30] animal. The people could not give that
[43:32] even that animal life. So the animal was
[43:35] only the substitute. And the high priest
[43:37] took the blood of the animal and went in
[43:39] before the mercy seat and sprinkled
[43:42] sprinkled the mercy seat on the day of
[43:44] atonement.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. And then God considered
[43:49] the people's sins that they were covered
[43:53] that he that they were forgiven. But
[43:56] then the scripture says that the law was
[43:59] not able to it was not perfect in that
[44:02] it could not give the people a clear
[44:04] conscience as they went back out and
[44:07] they still had consciousness of their
[44:09] sin. You see, but it was but they had
[44:12] appeased God because they had kept God's
[44:15] word. So that that is the order of that.
[44:18] Now we can take that off please. Thank
[44:20] you.
[44:22] Excuse me.
[44:24] So the mercy seat was just to uh go back
[44:28] over it a wee bit in the actual Hebrew
[44:32] is uh it's a place of atonement.
[44:37] It is a the golden plate is what they
[44:39] call it. the golden plate of
[44:41] propitiation
[44:43] on which the high priest sprinkled
[44:46] uh he sprinkled seven times on the day
[44:49] of atonement
[44:51] symbolically reconciling Jehovah and his
[44:55] chosen people back again together. It
[44:58] was a slab of gold
[45:01] on top of the ark of the covenant. And
[45:04] on it and part of it uh were the two
[45:08] golden cherubams
[45:10] facing each other whose wing tips they
[45:13] outstretched and touched and together
[45:16] above and constituted the throne of God.
[45:19] that that whole the whole scene there
[45:22] constituted to the people the throne of
[45:25] God because God said and between the
[45:28] cherubams and quite often he referred to
[45:31] and I will commune with you from between
[45:33] the cherubams because now God had the uh
[45:37] that symbolized the entire picture the
[45:41] word of the law that the people couldn't
[45:44] keep. Now, brother Brandham says that
[45:46] God gave Adam and Eve, he just gave them
[45:49] one word to keep,
[45:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:51] &gt;&gt; And they weren't able to keep it,
[45:53] &gt;&gt; just one word. And so when when that
[45:56] word was broken and God came in the
[46:00] garden in the cool of the day, now the
[46:02] word was broken. And so something had to
[46:05] happen and they immediately needed to be
[46:08] covered.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the mercy seat is.
[46:12] The mercy seat is a covering
[46:15] &gt;&gt; and they needed to be covered. So God
[46:18] himself slew the animal.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; How we don't know but blood was shed
[46:24] &gt;&gt; and almighty God himself then after
[46:26] shedding the blood showed grace and
[46:29] mercy to his children and covered them
[46:32] with skins
[46:33] &gt;&gt; and typifying
[46:35] speaking and prophesying of what would
[46:38] be coming in the future.
[46:41] And the Bible says, "And unto Adam and
[46:44] to his wife did the Lord God make coats
[46:48] of skins and clothe them."
[46:52] Now, I've said many times here, I'll
[46:55] repeat once again that if if Moses had
[47:00] kept the commandments and and uh had the
[47:03] tabernacle made, if he had the
[47:05] tabernacle made precisely to its uh
[47:09] exact precise dimensions and did
[47:12] everything technically right and had
[47:14] this priest right and the high priest
[47:17] right and slew the animal right and put
[47:20] the blood in the vessel and and carried
[47:22] it in and they did all the things. If
[47:25] they did all the mechanics,
[47:28] if if mercy was not attained,
[47:31] it was all in vain.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; So the ultimate thing that must take
[47:36] place or the ultimate thing that must be
[47:38] received is mercy. And if we don't get
[47:41] mercy, all of this all all of these
[47:45] music and singing and speaking and
[47:47] studying and praying and whatever more,
[47:50] it's just a a lot of it's just a uh
[47:54] &gt;&gt; you know, a lot of mechanics
[47:59] a person needs to we could pound on the
[48:04] altar and weep and shed tears and a lot
[48:07] of people do, but unless mercy
[48:10] And mercy is something that is divinely
[48:15] and sovereignly given by almighty God.
[48:18] Mercy. And then when we know that we
[48:21] have received mercy, we have peace with
[48:24] God.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; The world's a different place.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:32] Now Paul said in Romans
[48:36] because now the ark contained the word
[48:39] and so I want to speak about I want to
[48:42] just read some scriptures which I
[48:44] believe I've covered some of these
[48:45] scriptures in the last two three weeks
[48:47] with you when we spoke about grace grace
[48:51] and stewardship
[48:53] and and so Romans 3:20 says this
[48:55] therefore by the deeds of the law there
[48:58] shall no flesh be justified ified in his
[49:01] sight. For by the law
[49:04] is the knowledge of sin. So when as soon
[49:07] as we speak about the law, I want you to
[49:09] think about the the ark which we just
[49:12] showed and the contents of the ark is
[49:15] exactly what Paul is speaking about. For
[49:18] by the deeds of the law, by the keeping
[49:20] of it, there shall no flesh be justified
[49:24] because it witnessed against the
[49:26] unbelief of the people. In Romans 8:3 it
[49:29] says, "For what the law could not do in
[49:33] that it was weak through the flesh."
[49:34] There was nothing wrong with the law.
[49:37] But what the law could not do is because
[49:39] it could not empower the people to live
[49:43] the life.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; There was no power. There was no Holy
[49:47] Spirit to empower the people. The law
[49:50] only told them what was required. And
[49:53] because they could not keep it, they
[49:56] were condemned by it. And so there had
[49:58] to be something. If God had just had an
[50:00] ark with the law in it, the the it was a
[50:03] hopeless case. It was a hopeless
[50:05] situation. You understand what I'm
[50:08] saying? Absolutely a hopeless situation.
[50:11] What the law could not do in that it was
[50:13] weak through the flesh. God sending his
[50:16] own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[50:19] and for sin condemns sin in the flesh.
[50:23] In the flesh. Now it says in Ephesians,
[50:28] having abolished in his flesh. That's
[50:31] the that's why God the word was made
[50:34] flesh. Having abolished. Do you like
[50:37] that word?
[50:38] &gt;&gt; I love that word. Having abolished. Oh,
[50:42] I love that word. having abolished in
[50:45] his flesh the enmity, even the law of
[50:49] commandments. So he abolished
[50:52] the law of commandments contained in
[50:54] ordinances to make himself of twain one
[50:58] new man, so making peace, and that he
[51:01] might reconcile both unto God in one
[51:04] body by the cross, having slain the
[51:08] enmity thereby. Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; So we can see judgment was taking place
[51:15] at the mercy seat.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Judgment was
[51:18] taking place at the mercy seat.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in Hebrews 9 and7 it says but
[51:26] into the second speaking of the uh where
[51:29] the high priest went into the holy of
[51:31] holies into the second went the high
[51:33] priest alone once every year not without
[51:38] blood which he offered for himself and
[51:40] for the errors of the people. for the
[51:43] Holy Ghost. Thus, this signifying
[51:46] that the way into the holiest of all was
[51:49] not yet made manifest.
[51:52] uh while as the first tabernacle was yet
[51:56] standing
[51:58] which was a figure of the time then
[52:01] present. It was the figure uh it was a
[52:05] figure for the time then present in
[52:07] which were offered both gifts and
[52:10] sacrifices that could not listen to this
[52:13] that could not make him that did the
[52:16] service perfect as pertaining to his
[52:19] conscience. So he couldn't make it
[52:22] perfect as pertaining to his conscience
[52:24] even though he did it all but it was
[52:26] only a figure for the time that present
[52:29] time because it was not it was not the
[52:33] uh it was not the true it was only the
[52:35] negative.
[52:37] So the mercy seat, in other words, the
[52:39] mercy seat, and for us when we say seat,
[52:42] often it gets us perhaps gives us the
[52:45] wrong impression because it was a slab.
[52:48] We could say the covering. The mercy
[52:50] seat was the covering that stood between
[52:53] the law
[52:55] and God who spoke the law.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; The mercy seat is what stood between the
[53:04] law, the slab, and God. that spoke the
[53:07] word that was under it. So there had to
[53:09] be a there had to be a place of
[53:11] propitiation
[53:13] and that was placed between the law. And
[53:16] I'm wanting to really emphasize to this
[53:18] congregation and those that are on
[53:21] streaming at this time, I'm going to be
[53:23] speaking on largely th those junctions,
[53:27] those intervals between uh at at
[53:31] different different times when God came
[53:35] and because the mercy seat was actually
[53:39] transient,
[53:41] I would say it was a mercy seat in
[53:43] motion.
[53:44] We we could say and I draw back to the
[53:47] services just spoken,
[53:49] Adam and Eve obtained mercy, did they
[53:53] not?
[53:55] &gt;&gt; We c there was this ark wasn't present
[53:57] at that time.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; There was no golden slab over ten
[54:02] commandments. Uh but they did obtain
[54:05] mercy and and there was a a formula that
[54:09] was kept and God had given them a word
[54:13] and they couldn't keep the word. They
[54:15] became condemned and God came and
[54:18] covered them.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; God gave the children of Israel a word.
[54:24] They couldn't keep the word.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; So God, they were condemned by the word
[54:29] which they couldn't keep. So God made a
[54:32] provision and the provision was called
[54:34] now we make a place and it's called the
[54:37] mercy seat and there you also must shed
[54:40] blood and it must be sprinkled on the
[54:42] mercy seat and and somehow then the
[54:45] people had a a a realization that they
[54:49] that God had acknowledged them and
[54:52] acknowledged their sin and was and
[54:54] forgave them.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:01] So the mercy seat was positioned between
[55:05] the law of commandments
[55:08] and a holy God that had given them in uh
[55:12] God has a provided way. And brother
[55:15] Brandon spoke this message in fact in
[55:17] Victoria, British Columbia. He says,
[55:20] "And Job,
[55:22] Job being a righteous man." Now, there
[55:24] was no word written. There was no
[55:25] scripture written when Job uh when this
[55:30] was when this was uh took place. And he
[55:33] says he wanted to find a a go between
[55:38] something that could stand between a
[55:41] sinful man and a holy God.
[55:44] So there was something in Job
[55:47] &gt;&gt; realizing uh he was a righteous man but
[55:50] he realized that he was he could not be
[55:53] accepted to God. He he desired he wanted
[55:56] to go he said he wanted to go to his his
[55:58] place and perhaps knock on his door. He
[56:00] wanted to talk to him.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; He wanted to speak with him. He desired
[56:06] that. And he desired, oh, if there was
[56:08] somebody that could put a hand and stand
[56:12] and be a goeteen between me and this
[56:15] holy God that could stand and put a hand
[56:18] on me and a hand on a holy God, this is
[56:22] what he desired.
[56:24] and and and he says, "And put his hands
[56:27] on a holy God and his hand on a sinful
[56:31] man and breach the way between the two.
[56:37] Hold that." So, we notice the sequence
[56:40] of events and the order. And now we have
[56:45] a mercy seat.
[56:51] Here we are as humans on this earth
[56:56] and uh we're kind of caught up now more
[56:59] and more everybody's going to go green
[57:04] global warming
[57:07] and the danger
[57:09] and uh we hear from one side and uh
[57:12] people who are scientists and they say
[57:14] in so many many years that this ozone
[57:18] layer if we if we keep uh destroying it.
[57:23] And scientists say that if we didn't
[57:25] have that protective
[57:28] layer,
[57:29] then the very rays, the very sun that
[57:32] gives life would destroy it all.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what they say?
[57:37] &gt;&gt; So, there had to be something to go
[57:40] between.
[57:41] Something that's lifegiving
[57:44] could be destructive and would destroy
[57:47] not only human life but all life if we
[57:50] were just suddenly exposed to the sun
[57:52] without any protection. And so we have a
[57:56] a a very precious ozone layer which the
[57:59] world is all concerned about. And I'm
[58:02] not unconcerned but I'm just saying that
[58:05] that was part of God's creation
[58:08] &gt;&gt; even in natural creation. But now
[58:11] specifically the man that was created in
[58:14] his image, he's the one that is in much
[58:17] more danger. The very son
[58:21] &gt;&gt; s o n
[58:22] &gt;&gt; that is the lifegiver.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Also also
[58:28] uh judgment because of because of his
[58:31] word. The very the very god that saves
[58:35] also destroys. And that's why I'm so uh
[58:39] happy we can say that uh when God saw
[58:42] that the imagination of man's heart was
[58:45] in his mind was only only evil
[58:47] continually. But Noah
[58:51] &gt;&gt; found grace in the eyes of the Lord.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; You know what he was? He was a goeteen.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; He was a goeteen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that? Yes.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; What would happened if there hadn't been
[59:05] a Noah?
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Was there another man to fill his shoes?
[59:09] No. Not one.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; One man
[59:12] &gt;&gt; in the hand of God at that time was the
[59:15] gobetween.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; It was a junction.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; He
[59:20] that individual was the gobetween.
[59:23] Right.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; If you had lived in Mo Noah's time,
[59:30] if we'd have lived in Noah's time, I
[59:33] often put myself into those situations
[59:36] and ask, would you really believe? Would
[59:40] you really believe Noah? Would you
[59:41] really have been in the ark? And I tell
[59:43] you, it's a good question to ask a
[59:45] person because then we can put ourselves
[59:47] where we are today and say, would we
[59:49] believe?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; I want to say that I would. Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; I want to believe with all my heart that
[59:55] I would
[59:56] &gt;&gt; and it helps me to really query my own
[1:00:00] motives, my own my own intentions, my
[1:00:03] own deep self because I believe these
[1:00:05] are good questions we need to ask
[1:00:09] where would we have believed at that
[1:00:12] time
[1:00:15] this in between time. Now
[1:00:18] the Bible says of the children of Israel
[1:00:20] when God be to move them out says and
[1:00:23] the angel of God which went before the
[1:00:26] camp of Israel removed and went behind
[1:00:29] them and the pillar of cloud went from
[1:00:33] before their face and stood behind them
[1:00:36] and it and it came between the camp of
[1:00:39] the Egyptians and the camp of Israel.
[1:00:42] The pillar of cloud came between the
[1:00:45] camp of Israel and the camp of the
[1:00:48] Egyptians. And it was a cloud and it was
[1:00:52] a cloud and darkness to them, but it
[1:00:56] gave light to these so that one came not
[1:01:00] near the other all the night.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; So the same cloud was a darkness to one
[1:01:07] and a light to the other.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; They needed something to go between.
[1:01:13] They were at that junction and there was
[1:01:15] nothing else that they could do. They
[1:01:17] needed something to separate them and a
[1:01:19] go between. And I tell you my friends,
[1:01:22] it's a wonderful thing to have light
[1:01:24] instead of darkness.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; In Romans, the scripture says
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; once again, I've I've read these
[1:01:39] scriptures to you just a a moment ago,
[1:01:43] but it says
[1:01:45] uh for what the law could not do in that
[1:01:49] it was weak through the flesh.
[1:01:53] One thing we have in common here today
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; is we all got some flesh.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:00] And everybody's got some problem
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; with the flesh.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad I have a go between.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; I'm one rejoicing man today.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; But we have a go between
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; the law couldn't do it and the because
[1:02:21] the flesh was too weak.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; And there's nobody that's got strong
[1:02:26] flesh.
[1:02:28] The flesh is weak.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. The flesh is
[1:02:31] weak.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; And so God gave a commandment that the
[1:02:35] law could not the law that the flesh
[1:02:38] could not keep.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; So there was nothing wrong with the law,
[1:02:43] nothing wrong with the law, nothing evil
[1:02:45] with the law, but the flesh couldn't
[1:02:47] keep it. That was the problem.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; And so God had to provide a mercy for
[1:02:54] the people. And all of this all down
[1:02:57] through the Old Testament was only uh it
[1:03:01] was it was only a substitute because
[1:03:04] there was nothing to actually transform
[1:03:07] the people into a new creation.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in the Old Testament
[1:03:12] says and I'm a new creation.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; But when we get into the New Testament,
[1:03:17] we find that.
[1:03:23] So now the mercy seat
[1:03:26] was placed between
[1:03:28] there had to be a in between.
[1:03:31] The high priest only could go in the
[1:03:34] scripture tells us alone
[1:03:37] and he said uh in a in a godp provided
[1:03:41] approach to fellowship. He took the
[1:03:44] blood of the mercy seat and only he
[1:03:48] alone could go in once a year. But when
[1:03:52] Jesus died on the day of atonement,
[1:03:56] he rent the veil in two.
[1:03:59] We call it mercy seat in motion.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Now the motion it's changing. It's
[1:04:06] transient and he rent the veil into not
[1:04:08] only the high priest but whosoever will
[1:04:11] may come any time into the shakina glory
[1:04:14] of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:18] When you got the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:20] Ghost, you have access into the Holy of
[1:04:22] Holies,
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; you have access right where these
[1:04:26] cherubams are. And there I will commune
[1:04:29] with you.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Not just Moses now, but anyone.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; I want to talk about another gobetween.
[1:04:42] I could call it a breach and yet the
[1:04:44] breach is perhaps not the exact word I
[1:04:46] would like to use.
[1:04:49] But there was a go between between the
[1:04:51] Old Testament
[1:04:53] and the New Testament.
[1:04:55] A goeteen.
[1:04:58] Now
[1:05:00] God was getting ready, follow me close,
[1:05:03] to dispense with
[1:05:06] this ark that you saw. He's getting
[1:05:09] ready to dispense with that law of
[1:05:12] commandments
[1:05:14] and he's going to intensify them.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; He's going to magnify them.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; And his word which the people could not
[1:05:23] keep was going to come now into flesh.
[1:05:28] And there's a breach between the law
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; and the New Testament, between the
[1:05:35] negative and the positive, between the
[1:05:38] blood of bulls and goats and the blood
[1:05:40] of God.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; God's going to do something completely
[1:05:44] different. Now,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; it's going to be a whole new
[1:05:47] dispensation.
[1:05:49] And so in between he had to send a
[1:05:53] spirit of Elijah
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; in Malachi 3.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; He's going to send Malachi 3 and and the
[1:06:03] word comes to the prophet. The word
[1:06:07] comes to the prophet. Oh, if you can see
[1:06:09] now within the context of the message
[1:06:12] that I'm speaking today. And so here
[1:06:15] John comes on the scene. 400 years of a
[1:06:19] breach. John comes on the scene and he
[1:06:22] is the vessel that's going to carry the
[1:06:24] word. And and and his word is a
[1:06:27] condemning judgment word. Don't say we
[1:06:30] are children of Abraham. God's able of
[1:06:33] these stones to raise up children of
[1:06:34] Abraham. And they were condemned.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; But then the mercy seat
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; come walking to the word.
[1:06:44] Hallelujah.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; In the water.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word coming to the
[1:06:50] prophet.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The covering.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; He that could not only cover but could
[1:06:56] abolish.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Coming to the word that condemned the
[1:07:00] people.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; In this vital reach.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; It had to be pure gold.
[1:07:11] Tell you friends, my heart was touched
[1:07:14] as I thought about this. As I studied,
[1:07:17] as I waited on God for this service, my
[1:07:20] heart was touched. Said, "Oh, we sing
[1:07:23] little courses to be like Jesus, but how
[1:07:25] my heart broke open." Said, "Oh, it
[1:07:30] seems so remote. It seems so impossible,
[1:07:33] but yet there's a longing in my heart to
[1:07:37] be like you. Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Here came the pure gold.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; The character,
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; spotless character
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; He was qualified to be the mercy seat.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; And he contained the blood,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; different kind of blood, not Joseph's
[1:07:59] blood, not a human blood of of a human
[1:08:03] lineage, but the very created blood of
[1:08:05] Almighty God. Oh, what a mercy seat.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; The word in flesh
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; came to the one that was standing in the
[1:08:17] breach.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; And now it was hanging on one man,
[1:08:22] John the Baptist, because he had to
[1:08:27] identify this mercy seat.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "There's one that stands
[1:08:32] amongst you
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; who you don't know."
[1:08:36] Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; And he identified who he was. This is he
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; of whom I spake.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; He identified the mercy seat.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; And in a short time, in a very, very
[1:08:49] short time.
[1:08:51] The mercy seat was exposed.
[1:08:54] And God was going to make known it had
[1:08:56] changed. The location had changed. The
[1:09:00] whole manner had changed. But the
[1:09:02] elements were still there.
[1:09:05] Blood was there.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Gold was there.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; And the intensified intensified
[1:09:16] commandment was dealt with by Jesus
[1:09:19] Christ.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:25] In the message paradox,
[1:09:31] he said Jesus speaking of
[1:09:35] John the Baptist, "What did you go out?"
[1:09:37] He's saying to the people, "What did you
[1:09:38] go out to see? A prophet?"
[1:09:44] I say unto you, and greater than a
[1:09:46] prophet,
[1:09:48] listen very closely. I hope that you put
[1:09:51] emphasis on the prophet's words as I do.
[1:09:54] I'll encourage you to do that.
[1:09:59] He said he was the messenger of the
[1:10:02] covenant.
[1:10:04] He was the breach.
[1:10:12] He's not only the messenger of the
[1:10:14] covenant,
[1:10:16] but brother Brandham is saying that John
[1:10:18] the Baptist with the spirit of Elijah,
[1:10:20] he was the breach.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Moses was I should say Noah was the
[1:10:26] breach between the old world and the
[1:10:29] new.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Without him there was no new world.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:10:37] He was the breach.
[1:10:42] That's one phrase.
[1:10:45] And he goes on to say he was the
[1:10:48] keystone between
[1:10:50] law and grace. We might say, well,
[1:10:53] Apostle Paul was.
[1:10:56] I'll say to you that without this man,
[1:11:00] without this coming, without Malachi 3,
[1:11:03] the coming of Elijah in that day, he
[1:11:06] shall prepare the way before me.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Not he. And if he doesn't do it, someone
[1:11:11] else will. He shall prepare. He was the
[1:11:14] breach. He was the identifier. He was
[1:11:17] the one and the only one who could
[1:11:19] identify. Behold, there was not another
[1:11:22] person ever on the earth that could say,
[1:11:24] "Behold, the lamb of God which takenth
[1:11:26] away the sin of the world."
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; It was his place, his position,
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; pointing to the mercy seat.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; He was the bridge.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Hang on to that.
[1:11:44] between the law and grace.
[1:11:46] He said, "Would you go out to see a
[1:11:48] prophet and I say unto you more than a
[1:11:50] prophet?"
[1:11:51] He said, "He was a bright and shining
[1:11:53] light for a while."
[1:11:56] Why? He was the word made light. He was
[1:11:59] the word manifested.
[1:12:02] Then when he came on the scene, he said,
[1:12:03] "I must decrease and he must increase."
[1:12:06] Two of them couldn't stay at the same
[1:12:09] time. John had to go. Jesus remained.
[1:12:14] It's always
[1:12:16] that way.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; The breach the chasm
[1:12:25] that Jesus Christ bridged.
[1:12:29] Now the purpose
[1:12:31] the purpose of the mercy seat in the
[1:12:34] message here ye him which brother Bran
[1:12:36] preached in Edmonton
[1:12:39] said this is my beloved son. Hear ye
[1:12:40] him.
[1:12:42] What did he represent? God's love.
[1:12:46] That's he says that's what I want. Not
[1:12:48] justice, not judgment, not law. I want
[1:12:51] God's love and mercy on me. This is my
[1:12:54] beloved son. Hear ye him. I'm so glad
[1:12:57] for that. And he goes on to say, God
[1:12:59] wanted to bless his children.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; And I say, God wants to bless his
[1:13:03] children
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; and he couldn't do it under the law. He
[1:13:09] wanted to bless him, but he couldn't do
[1:13:11] it under the law. He said neither could
[1:13:14] he under judgment and justice,
[1:13:18] but the only way that he could do it was
[1:13:20] under the love of his son, Christ Jesus.
[1:13:23] This is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:13:26] pleased. Hear ye him. What is it? All
[1:13:29] the law is finished. All the judgment is
[1:13:33] finished. This is my beloved son. Hear
[1:13:35] ye him. all those other things are done.
[1:13:39] This is him. So now we have the
[1:13:42] scripture which we all know so well. Uh
[1:13:45] there's one mediator between God and
[1:13:47] man, the man Christ Jesus. And a
[1:13:50] mediator is one who intervenes between
[1:13:53] two
[1:13:55] either in order to make or restore peace
[1:13:58] and friendships
[1:14:01] or to form a comp or to form a a compact
[1:14:05] or for ratifying a covenant,
[1:14:09] a mediator,
[1:14:11] an arbitrator, someone that comes in
[1:14:13] between. We're familiar with that. The
[1:14:16] you men that are members of unions
[1:14:20] often they get two sides and they can't
[1:14:23] they can't bring them to working
[1:14:25] directly. They just can't can't seem to
[1:14:28] come to a a meeting of the minds. So
[1:14:32] they will call a mediator. We've got
[1:14:35] quite a renowned mediator that they call
[1:14:38] here in the west coast and they call him
[1:14:40] quite often because they just can't the
[1:14:43] sides are too antagonistic and they
[1:14:45] can't come to a meeting of the minds. So
[1:14:47] they get a mediator that mediator
[1:14:50] mediates for them and they have to
[1:14:53] really agree that what he says is the is
[1:14:56] the right way. Now
[1:15:00] now we have uh this this this breach. It
[1:15:03] starts with Malachi 3.
[1:15:07] Brother Brandham says of Christ, he
[1:15:09] didn't die on earth.
[1:15:13] Neither did he die in heaven.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; He died between heaven and earth. Right?
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; He had to hang between the two because
[1:15:23] he was reconciling and his blood was
[1:15:27] sprinkled out
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; as a covering
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; and a claim on the earth.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; He was hanging onto the earth and uh and
[1:15:36] onto a holy God. He says the ribbon went
[1:15:39] straight up into the throne of God and
[1:15:42] anchored the earth to God. Hallelujah.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love the way he's put it. Do you
[1:15:47] talk about a chasm? He was bridging the
[1:15:49] chasm. He said he was God's sacrifice.
[1:15:52] He couldn't go to heaven.
[1:15:55] He couldn't go to heaven. He had our
[1:15:57] sins.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; We Let's just say it the way it really
[1:16:00] should be. He couldn't go to heaven
[1:16:02] because he had my sin
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; and earth wouldn't have him
[1:16:13] because he was the son of God. Right?
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Wasn't that a fix?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Aren't these powerful statements,
[1:16:21] friend?
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; I'm a simple man, but to me, it's
[1:16:24] powerful. I don't want to just have a
[1:16:26] quote. I want to get the essence of the
[1:16:28] quote, the spirit of the quote. What is
[1:16:30] God saying in this quote? Here he hung
[1:16:32] between heaven and earth with his blood
[1:16:35] going, the newly created blood of God
[1:16:37] going to the earth, covering the earth,
[1:16:39] claiming the earth,
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; putting an anchor in the earth as it
[1:16:44] were.
[1:16:45] And he couldn't go to heaven because he
[1:16:47] had my sin. Had your sin
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; and earth wouldn't have him,
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; He was rejected of man.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; what a mercy Satan.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; And there God caused the temple veil to
[1:17:04] be rent in two. with the fire of
[1:17:06] Almighty God and exposed the mercy seat.
[1:17:09] He says, "And there he was hanging on
[1:17:12] Mount Calvary." And the mercy seat came
[1:17:14] into plain view.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Not just a high priest going in now, but
[1:17:23] everyone could see the mercy seat in
[1:17:25] plain view. It had moved from the temple
[1:17:28] to Mount Calvary.
[1:17:32] It wasn't the sprinkling of a high
[1:17:34] priest with blood on a on a gold slab,
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; but the gold
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; was hanging on the cross.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; A character. There never was a man that
[1:17:46] walked like this man. There never was a
[1:17:49] character like this. This man,
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; the character of Almighty God. And there
[1:17:55] was the gold.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; There was the blood.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; There was the mercy seat. And there was
[1:18:01] the law fulfilled in him.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; What a perfect sacrifice.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; We should have no trouble singing I love
[1:18:14] him.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; He was lifted between, he said, the
[1:18:21] heavens and the earth as an end sign
[1:18:24] right outside the gates of Jerusalem.
[1:18:28] And there's where the supreme price was
[1:18:30] paid.
[1:18:32] There's where we were redeemed.
[1:18:36] He said God took all the judgments of
[1:18:38] death.
[1:18:40] Death that I should die. Think of it.
[1:18:44] Brother Brandham's saying the death that
[1:18:45] I should die. He said the hell that I
[1:18:48] should go to.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; We can make it all personal. The death
[1:18:52] that I should die. There he is.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; The hell that I should go to. There he
[1:18:57] is.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mercy seat.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "God with his judgments of
[1:19:05] death and sickness, Christ met him in
[1:19:08] the gap
[1:19:09] hanging between the heavens and the
[1:19:11] earth, and God struck upon him the
[1:19:15] iniquity of us all.
[1:19:21] The mercy seat came into plain view.
[1:19:26] Now I want to
[1:19:28] take your attention to the breach in of
[1:19:31] Malachi 4.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Behold,
[1:19:37] I will send you
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet
[1:19:42] before the coming of the great and
[1:19:45] dreadful
[1:19:47] day of the Lord.
[1:19:51] And he
[1:19:53] he
[1:19:56] he's the breach,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; He
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; shall turn the hearts
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; of the fathers
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; to the children
[1:20:05] and the heart of the children to their
[1:20:07] fathers. Why? Lest if this doesn't
[1:20:10] happen, if he doesn't come, I will smite
[1:20:13] the earth with a curse. Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And the law now that you'll connect now
[1:20:22] with what I've preached in previous
[1:20:23] services.
[1:20:25] Now the law becomes magnified
[1:20:29] even greater.
[1:20:33] No one lives by the ten commandments.
[1:20:37] No one can live by the intensified or
[1:20:39] magnified commandments that Jesus gave.
[1:20:42] Right.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; And certainly no one is living by the
[1:20:45] commandments that were magnified even by
[1:20:49] the same Lord Jesus Christ speaking
[1:20:51] through his authorized voice in this
[1:20:53] day.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "But I say unto you," and
[1:20:57] brother Brandham even intensified that
[1:21:00] and he called it magnified that. And I'm
[1:21:02] not majoring on that now. What I'm
[1:21:04] majoring on is the mercy seat.
[1:21:07] How absolutely essential.
[1:21:10] tell you my brother, my sisters, there's
[1:21:12] not a man or woman that can survive
[1:21:16] the eyes of a holy God outside of the
[1:21:19] mercy that was magnified in this time.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; I think it is so significant now. I pray
[1:21:33] that God help me here. I believe it is
[1:21:36] so significant.
[1:21:38] So significant. And I trust it will be
[1:21:40] more so to you today.
[1:21:44] And you need to absorb this. You need to
[1:21:47] ponder it. And I I I certainly won't be
[1:21:50] able to I certainly won't be able to
[1:21:52] plum the depths of it.
[1:21:55] But John, prophet said John the Baptist,
[1:22:00] he was that breach.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; I want to go as far as saying, brother
[1:22:05] Brandon, the prophet of God in this day
[1:22:07] was that breach. And that is why before
[1:22:09] he could introduce Christ in the opening
[1:22:11] of the seals, he had to preach the
[1:22:14] breach.
[1:22:15] And he took Revelation chapter 5
[1:22:19] as the breach between the church ages
[1:22:22] and the seals.
[1:22:24] In the breach, if you were to,
[1:22:28] that's where the sealed book appears.
[1:22:32] The sealed book
[1:22:35] appears.
[1:22:39] in Revelation chapter 5.
[1:22:42] And in one sense of the word,
[1:22:45] if you can connect this, if you can
[1:22:47] connect this,
[1:22:49] if this Elijah had not come, you would
[1:22:52] have no inkling or knowledge of what was
[1:22:55] in the seal book.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; In that sense, he was the breach
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; because it's locked up in him.
[1:23:06] G to God.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't open the seals. The lamb could
[1:23:12] only open the seals.
[1:23:16] The lion of the tribe of Judah.
[1:23:19] The lion. And that's the only place that
[1:23:21] that scripture actually appears. The
[1:23:23] lion of the tribe of Judah. Jesus had to
[1:23:26] come of that of that lineage of that
[1:23:29] tribe of Judah. And as you know, it was
[1:23:31] almost extinguished
[1:23:33] in the time of Judah himself.
[1:23:36] But if you take Revelation 5 and you
[1:23:38] begin to read it, the sealed book, it
[1:23:42] was sealed
[1:23:44] in Revelation five. Now comes the time
[1:23:47] of the revealing of its contents
[1:23:50] in Revelation five. And it's the only
[1:23:53] time you find it, the lion of the tribe
[1:23:56] of Judah.
[1:23:58] And the scripture tells us in in Genesis
[1:24:01] 49 and9, Judah,
[1:24:04] and this is now the father of the
[1:24:07] patriarchs
[1:24:09] prophesying concerning them.
[1:24:12] Judah is a lion's welp. That's a young
[1:24:15] one.
[1:24:17] From the prey, my son, thou art gone up.
[1:24:23] He stooped down.
[1:24:25] He couched as a lion stretched out as a
[1:24:28] lion and as an old lion and not
[1:24:31] necessarily an old lion but as a lioness
[1:24:34] as a as an old lion.
[1:24:38] Who shall rouse him up?
[1:24:41] I I wouldn't preach this as a doctrine.
[1:24:44] I certainly wouldn't preach it anywhere
[1:24:45] else, but I'm in my own pullpit.
[1:24:50] And I'm wondering
[1:24:52] what this
[1:24:55] prophet Jacob was saying
[1:24:58] as he's speaking these words concerning
[1:25:01] his son Judah.
[1:25:04] You're a lion's welp.
[1:25:07] You're like a young lion from the prey,
[1:25:12] my son.
[1:25:14] Thou art gone up.
[1:25:16] He stooped down. He couched as a lion
[1:25:19] and as an old lion. Who shall rouse him
[1:25:23] up? I just leave that for a moment.
[1:25:30] I'm putting a lot of emphasis on this
[1:25:32] message and the messenger right at this
[1:25:34] moment. I'm taking brother Brandham's
[1:25:37] words that John the Baptist was the
[1:25:39] bridge.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; I'm just stressing that. I'm not making
[1:25:43] a doctrine out. I'm just stressing that
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; I ask myself this question. I ask you, I
[1:25:50] pose it to you.
[1:25:53] It's prophesied in Revelation 5, which
[1:25:55] is the breach.
[1:25:58] And if you read the breach and read
[1:25:59] Revelation five and read the breach had
[1:26:02] to come before the seals could be
[1:26:04] opened.
[1:26:06] And and the and the key the key in the
[1:26:09] breach is the sealed book couldn't be
[1:26:13] opened.
[1:26:14] And John the Apostle, not John the
[1:26:17] Baptist, John the Apostle is weeping
[1:26:20] because he said the prophet declares it.
[1:26:23] All creation, hello, you're here. All
[1:26:26] creation is lost. If that's not open,
[1:26:30] all creation, you're lost.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Unless this would happen. I'm lost.
[1:26:36] We're all lost if this wouldn't happen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And it's hanging on a man.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; He's not going to open the sails, but
[1:26:46] he's going to. The time has arrived.
[1:26:49] Everything has to work in his precision
[1:26:51] as a time piece. God has everything. I
[1:26:55] believe God has everything absolutely
[1:26:57] under control. Don't you?
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:27:01] And it says, "Weep not, John,
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; for the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; has prevailed,
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; the lion of the tribe of Judah." And he
[1:27:11] turns to see the lion, but he sees a
[1:27:14] lamb
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; standing. Hallelujah.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; If this voice had not called for it, I
[1:27:22] really wonder if he had aroused.
[1:27:28] Think about it.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Jacob said, "You're a lion
[1:27:34] and you'll rouse. You'll arise. You'll
[1:27:37] arise. I'll I'll read the scripture for
[1:27:39] you." And he couched as an old as a lion
[1:27:41] and as an old lion. Now he's he's aged.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; He's the wicked one.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Not a child anymore.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Not young anymore.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; He's conquered.
[1:27:57] He's a wicked one. The judge
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; coming to judge the earth.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And who? The question is who shall rouse
[1:28:08] him
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; as far as I'm concerned.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; I'm glad
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; there was one
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; that was the breach.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Stood in the breach.
[1:28:23] Why do you think right after that he
[1:28:25] preached standing in the gap
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; you're quiet
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; you're thinking
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; and he goes on to say Jacob prophesying
[1:28:40] the scepter shall not depart from Judah
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; nor a lawgiver from between his feet
[1:28:48] until Shiloh come and unto him shall the
[1:28:53] gathering of the people be.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; I haven't intended on getting into this,
[1:28:58] but I thought I'll drop it anyway.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; It's my own little private thoughts.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; There was a voice.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Maybe when you're in the seals, and I've
[1:29:10] given you this many times before, but it
[1:29:13] will have new force to it. Brother
[1:29:16] Brandham is reading the breach.
[1:29:21] He is. He He is there. He is in that.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; He's part of that.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Just like you're part of the sealed
[1:29:28] book.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; It had to be opened because your name
[1:29:31] was in it.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Here's one that's hanging on him.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And he's reading the very scriptures.
[1:29:40] He says, "And and he says, "Oh, let him
[1:29:42] come."
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Maybe I'm just feeling this
[1:29:46] way.
[1:29:49] Maybe I'm just feeling this way, but let
[1:29:51] him come.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; And I declare to you, he did come and he
[1:29:59] did take the book and he did open the
[1:30:01] book and he did reveal the mysteries and
[1:30:03] he did send it down and the mouthpiece
[1:30:06] spoke it.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; That's what happened.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my friends, my people that talk about
[1:30:13] all Malachi 40, I believe Malachi don't
[1:30:15] even know what they're talking about.
[1:30:17] All they've got is a a new way to
[1:30:19] believe and maybe a new group to
[1:30:20] fellowship with and a new something.
[1:30:22] Don't realize what happened at all.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; I tell you what was hanging on Malachi
[1:30:27] 4. And unless he would come, I'll smite
[1:30:29] the earth with a curse. Not just a a
[1:30:32] certain country, not just Palestine,
[1:30:34] smite the earth.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; And which voice is going to the earth?
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; I'm glad. Oh, am I ever glad for every
[1:30:43] little part we can do? Whether I send a
[1:30:46] book or a tape or whether whatever you
[1:30:48] do or by your voice or over a telephone
[1:30:50] or however it goes, but to see that
[1:30:52] voice going out gives me a great joy.
[1:31:05] says he's roused. Who shall rouse him
[1:31:08] up?
[1:31:16] The four beasts or four living creatures
[1:31:21] which represented the anointing of every
[1:31:23] age. There was the lion which is king,
[1:31:28] the ox which is sacrifice,
[1:31:32] the man which is wisdom
[1:31:36] and the eagle which is prophet
[1:31:40] and those four living creatures.
[1:31:44] Brother Brandham in one paragraph he
[1:31:46] takes the two that were on the mercy
[1:31:48] seat the two cherubams and then he says
[1:31:50] and there's four around the lamb
[1:31:55] he said it's Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:31:58] Matthew took the king part and traced
[1:32:00] him his kingly lineage
[1:32:04] Mark starts right off of the ox starts
[1:32:06] right off serving
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; doesn't give any lineage either way just
[1:32:10] starts right off serving Luke takes the
[1:32:13] man part and trace him in his human
[1:32:15] lineage.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; And John takes it completely different.
[1:32:18] In the beginning was the word.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Prophet Eagle goes way back
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; to the very beginning.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; And John, he's the one who covers
[1:32:33] Gethsemane. He's the one who covers the
[1:32:35] foot washing. He's the one who covers
[1:32:37] I'm the good shepherd. He's the one that
[1:32:39] covers John the 17th chapter, the prayer
[1:32:42] of the Lord Jesus, which none of the
[1:32:44] others caught. Matthew didn't catch it.
[1:32:46] Luke didn't catch it. Mark didn't catch
[1:32:49] it. John caught it.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; I say how we needed every one of them.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; And he says those are the four
[1:32:57] anointings.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; And in the early church, the lion the
[1:33:04] lion anointing was poured out. And the
[1:33:06] prophet said, "The pure word is poured
[1:33:08] out."
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Then came the ox and the sacrifice of
[1:33:13] the multitudes. He said they he said
[1:33:17] they couldn't do anything else but run
[1:33:19] to it
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; to the sacrifice. 68 million ran to it.
[1:33:25] He said because they anointing they were
[1:33:28] anointed to do that.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; They couldn't do anything else.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The sacrifice. And then came
[1:33:34] Luther and Wesley and the wisdom of men
[1:33:38] and the reformation and how they could
[1:33:40] oh Luther's such an orator could take
[1:33:42] and handle that handle that word and
[1:33:45] handle his conviction and speak it out.
[1:33:48] He's the one that said I will not, I
[1:33:50] cannot and I will not.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; And then we come on another age.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Those anointings never went back up.
[1:33:57] They were just poured out.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; The word was poured out.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The sacrifice was poured
[1:34:04] out.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; I can tell you my brother, my sister,
[1:34:07] whatever sacrifice this bride is called
[1:34:10] on, she will achieve it
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; because we still have that anointing,
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; the wisdom, we still have it.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; We have all of that. We have the
[1:34:20] combined. I can tell you the because
[1:34:22] brother Brandham says that even the four
[1:34:25] riders that came out,
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; the black, the red horse, all of the
[1:34:30] horse riders that came out, the
[1:34:32] antichrist riding, all of those powers
[1:34:35] exist today.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; They may be under a different cloak.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; I can tell you all the cruelty of Rome
[1:34:41] exists right now. All the deception of
[1:34:44] Rome exists right now.
[1:34:48] They might put it in a nice different
[1:34:50] package, but it's still the same thing
[1:34:52] inside.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; I do believe it. And all the anointing,
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; all the anointing of those four living
[1:35:04] creatures
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; has been deposited. We have access to
[1:35:08] every bit of it right now for the
[1:35:10] believer, for the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:14] The four he said the first was a lion.
[1:35:17] This is in the fifth seal.
[1:35:19] The first was that lion that roared that
[1:35:23] pure unadulterated word. The second in
[1:35:27] Thotyra was the ox and it was a beast of
[1:35:31] burden. It was also a sacrificed beast.
[1:35:36] In the fifth seal he said notice
[1:35:37] idolatry bought them brought the man
[1:35:40] beast went forth. Notice what idolatry
[1:35:43] brought. The man beast went forth with
[1:35:46] the power of God by wisdom that God gave
[1:35:50] him and brought the church from idolatry
[1:35:53] back to God. And in the sixth seal,
[1:35:56] excuse me for reading, but I want you to
[1:35:58] hear what he said in his prayer. Lord, I
[1:36:01] pray that you'll honor these people for
[1:36:03] their respects to the word and heal them
[1:36:06] for Jesus' sake. He said, "Ah, out here
[1:36:09] in the audience, Lord, uh there's
[1:36:11] sitting there people just like it was
[1:36:13] who listened in the to the Apostle Peter
[1:36:16] at the day of Pentecost, how he went
[1:36:19] back to the word and got the word and
[1:36:21] said, Joel said that in the last days
[1:36:23] these things shall take place and this
[1:36:26] is that and 3,000 believed it and were
[1:36:30] baptized and Father, today we stand here
[1:36:33] by your grace and it's not because that
[1:36:36] it's that it's a special people, but
[1:36:39] it's because like just like the day of
[1:36:41] the lion or the ox or the man, it's the
[1:36:45] eagle time.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; It's the anointing of the hour.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; He never once said, and the scripture
[1:36:54] never says that God withdrew his
[1:36:56] anointing. Those anointings are present
[1:37:00] today. I declare that.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; And this is the eagle time. And if I say
[1:37:06] and if I can say it this way, if he said
[1:37:09] it, I have a right to repeat it. And if
[1:37:12] I have a right to repeat it, we have a
[1:37:14] right to claim it.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And I do before this group of people, I
[1:37:18] claim that in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:37:21] I claim the anointing for myself
[1:37:23] personally, the eagle anointing.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; A greater law, a greater mercy, a
[1:37:29] greater grace.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Nathan. Mercy.
[1:37:33] Grace. Hallelujah.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; It's the time that we're living in. It's
[1:37:45] the working of the Holy Spirit for this
[1:37:48] particular time to prove that Jesus is
[1:37:50] not dead. Every time I see whether I see
[1:37:55] uh the families or I see young people or
[1:37:58] I see the bride of Jesus Christ or go to
[1:38:00] some other city and see the bride. Yes,
[1:38:03] there's this that and the other thing.
[1:38:05] All kinds of all kinds of stuff that
[1:38:07] colle collects along with it. But I see
[1:38:09] a body of people
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; and they're genuine.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; They're mature.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; I can see that they are indeed the bride
[1:38:18] of Jesus Christ. And I'm so I'm so happy
[1:38:22] to be identified with them. Amen.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; And whether it be in Africa or whether
[1:38:27] it be in South America or whether it be
[1:38:30] in Asia, wherever it might be, this
[1:38:33] message produces exactly the same thing
[1:38:36] everywhere.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's the same life.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of little antidotes
[1:38:52] they could probably relate to. and I
[1:38:54] don't want to worry you,
[1:38:57] but I believe it was Gordon Lindsay's
[1:39:00] daughter that was standing washing
[1:39:03] dishes
[1:39:06] and up drove a little model or model T
[1:39:09] car and a little man got out.
[1:39:14] She didn't know anything about him. She
[1:39:16] said she just instinctively began to
[1:39:18] weep.
[1:39:20] It was like like a humility
[1:39:24] coming a humility. She said it was such
[1:39:27] humility. Now, how could she over a sink
[1:39:30] in a house
[1:39:32] pick up that spirit of humility, such an
[1:39:36] atmosphere of humility that would have
[1:39:38] such a reaction on her body that would
[1:39:40] cause tears to come to her eyes and
[1:39:42] begin to weep
[1:39:45] just seeing a man get out of a car.
[1:39:48] Now you see friends,
[1:39:52] something of the spirit of God was
[1:39:54] witnessing to her
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; that there's a certain characteristic of
[1:39:59] this vessel.
[1:40:01] And wherever you hear even brother
[1:40:04] Brandham's enemies,
[1:40:06] they will say humble.
[1:40:09] He was humble.
[1:40:11] Such humility.
[1:40:13] It was the spirit of Christ. He had to
[1:40:16] display that because because he could
[1:40:19] not it would be not possible for what
[1:40:23] would come out of his mouth to be
[1:40:25] contrary to the life that he lived. And
[1:40:27] what was coming out of his mouth was the
[1:40:29] word to this hour, the word to this age.
[1:40:33] And that's why he lived that life. His
[1:40:35] critics have not been able to put a
[1:40:36] finger on his life. They say his
[1:40:38] doctrine is wrong and this is wrong and
[1:40:40] all the rest of it, but they can't touch
[1:40:43] his life. They can't put a finger on his
[1:40:45] life. I tell you that is quite that is a
[1:40:48] staggering statement.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; A man that was before the eyes of
[1:40:52] millions of people and those that were
[1:40:54] actually enemies and watching for a
[1:40:56] flaw, watching for one crack, watching
[1:41:00] for something and couldn't find it.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; I say, glory be to God.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed to be identified with
[1:41:07] that kind of character.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why? Because we have now an
[1:41:15] individual and you are linked to that.
[1:41:19] Amen.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; You are linked to, listen to me,
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; you are linked to a mouth that opened
[1:41:26] and spoke,
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; a magnified law that condemned every
[1:41:31] person in this congregation
[1:41:36] and a magnified grace
[1:41:40] that was so incredible
[1:41:42] until he could say,
[1:41:45] and this is where so many people I think
[1:41:47] really kind
[1:41:49] didn't fully grasp it said he rises.
[1:41:54] He rises.
[1:41:57] He's aroused
[1:41:59] and the mercy seat becomes a judgment
[1:42:03] seat.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Do you believe in Calvary?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; He's not hanging on Calvary.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; He's left the cross.
[1:42:19] He left the cross. When he left the
[1:42:22] cross, did we suddenly lose all the
[1:42:25] efficacy of the cross?
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Did we lose all of the power of the
[1:42:29] cross? Did we lose the sacrifice of the
[1:42:31] cross? No. It's still available to us.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; He left the tomb, did he not?
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad he left the tomb.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; But what he achieved in the tomb is with
[1:42:46] us today. His resurrection power. We
[1:42:49] didn't lose the resurrection power
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; on Mount Calvary. The mercy seat came
[1:42:55] into full view.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; He's not on Mount Calvary. He's left the
[1:43:00] mercy seat is not there in full view
[1:43:02] today. He's left the mercy seat. But he
[1:43:05] the word he the word is mercy.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; He is grace. In other words, he's the
[1:43:14] one that administers it. how he chooses.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; In the age that he chooses it and in
[1:43:22] this age, he's got one voice. I wish I
[1:43:27] could explain it to you. He's got one
[1:43:28] voice.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; It's the voice of the breach.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; It's the voice that's taking a hold of
[1:43:34] the church age on one side
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; and Christ himself on the other side.
[1:43:41] And he is under a mandate to turn this
[1:43:45] way to the church ages and call, "Come
[1:43:50] out of her, my people."
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; And be ye separate, sayaeth the Lord. Is
[1:43:55] that the truth? Amen.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; He was to call out a bride, to call out
[1:44:00] a people, and they would hear that voice
[1:44:04] and recognize who it was that was
[1:44:06] calling
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; and turn and take this word that and and
[1:44:10] this Christ himself was being made known
[1:44:14] by the very word that he spoke. I I
[1:44:17] would not know him. You wouldn't know
[1:44:18] him unless you could see it and read it.
[1:44:21] Amen.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; And he's ordained to unite the two
[1:44:26] together
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; into a husband and wife relationship.
[1:44:30] Amen.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; We heard brother
[1:44:36] brother Murphy speak
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; and it was a wonderful service
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; and he spent quite a bit of time
[1:44:44] on Eleazar
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Rebecca
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; and Isaac
[1:44:51] and brother Brandham even says let me
[1:44:53] like Eleazar
[1:44:55] go get your son a bride.
[1:44:59] But there had to come a time
[1:45:02] there was no one else. Eleazar was that
[1:45:06] breach.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; He was that breach. And when he
[1:45:11] fulfilled his purpose, he dropped out
[1:45:13] and left.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; The wife and the husband together.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; In Ruth the second chapter,
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; there was one servant that was over all
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; all the those that were reapers.
[1:45:28] over all the reapers.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; And when the Boaz, the kinsman redeemer,
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; coming to the field, the world, Jesus
[1:45:38] said, "The earth, the world is the
[1:45:40] field." And he comes to the field. He
[1:45:42] addresses only one.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; That one happens to be the breach
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; between Boaz, the kinsman, redeemer, and
[1:45:52] Ruth that was there almost starving to
[1:45:55] death in the field. Who is this maiden?
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; That's Ruth the Moabites.
[1:46:00] And that servant drops out of the
[1:46:02] picture. There had to be one standing in
[1:46:05] the breach.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; There had to be one filling the gap.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And this message
[1:46:20] is to me mercy. Yeah.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; This message is God's mercy.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; This vindicated voice is God's mercy.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; And if a person rejects that, it can
[1:46:39] only be judgment.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; I say, "God, I want mercy.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; I want mercy."
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; More than anything,
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; I'm a believer.
[1:46:52] Are you a believer?
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that when he rose
[1:47:01] and he took the book, notice now, and
[1:47:05] I'm closing,
[1:47:07] the four and 20 elders.
[1:47:10] And brother Bram says, "The patriarchs
[1:47:12] of the Old Testament and the apostles of
[1:47:15] the new fell down
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; before the lamb
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; and the four beasts and they fell down
[1:47:23] before the lamb." And the Bible says,
[1:47:25] "And they sung a new song." Hallelujah.
[1:47:30] Hallelujah. This word will make you sing
[1:47:33] a new song.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Your condemnation will be gone. Your
[1:47:38] judgment is gone. Hallelujah. Your
[1:47:40] widowhood is gone. Hallelujah. All of
[1:47:43] your sin is gone. We can sing a new
[1:47:46] song.
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; I know you are.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; And they sang a new song.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; And they said this, "Thou art worthy
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; to take the book and to open the seals
[1:48:07] thereof. For thou was slain and hast
[1:48:10] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:48:14] every kindred and tongue and people and
[1:48:19] nation. That's a scripture
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; in the seal book.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; That scripture had to be fulfilled.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; And that scripture
[1:48:32] to be fulfilled
[1:48:35] really hung on one man.
[1:48:38] not a church. You won't find a church.
[1:48:40] You won't find an organization. You
[1:48:42] won't find a school. You won't find
[1:48:44] anybody that call for it. You'll find a
[1:48:48] strong angel
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; right
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; call for it. Heard a strong angel
[1:48:54] who is worthy.
[1:48:58] And when that angel comes, that's my own
[1:49:00] thought. When that angel comes and
[1:49:04] stands here and the moment arrives,
[1:49:08] the moment has arrived.
[1:49:11] Who is worthy?
[1:49:13] Let him come.
[1:49:16] Stops.
[1:49:17] Maybe I just feel this way. But let him
[1:49:20] come.
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Let him take the book.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Personally, I believe that roused him.
[1:49:32] Hallelujah. I believe he stood.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; The time has come.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; It hung on one man, John the Baptist,
[1:49:41] and he's standing there. Oh, yeah. The
[1:49:43] people thought it was a makeup. They
[1:49:45] thought it was just something that was
[1:49:46] cooked up like many do today. And John
[1:49:49] the Baptist standing there in the mud
[1:49:51] squeezing between his toes in the River
[1:49:53] Jordan. And here comes his cousin after
[1:49:56] the flesh, Jesus Christ, who they
[1:49:58] thought was the son of Joseph, who was
[1:50:00] actually the son of God.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; And the same God that commissioned him
[1:50:05] said to him, "When you see the when you
[1:50:08] see the the the the light, when you see
[1:50:11] the identification, that's him."
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Says, "This is him." He said, "He didn't
[1:50:16] know,
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; but when it came, it was identified.
[1:50:20] This is him. There's the lamb of God
[1:50:23] that takes away the sin of the world.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; You see, friends, I can't reconcile the
[1:50:33] scriptures without John being there.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; I go as far as to say if John was not
[1:50:40] there, if that spirit of Elijah was not
[1:50:42] there, Jesus would not have walked to
[1:50:44] Jordan. Yes, sir.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; I'll go a step further. If John wasn't
[1:50:49] there, neither would Jesus be there.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; If this messenger had not come, the
[1:50:57] seals would not be open.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; If this messenger had not come, you
[1:51:03] would not be believing what you believe.
[1:51:05] You would not have the revelation that
[1:51:07] you have.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; How do we know it's a revelation? It's a
[1:51:10] transforming power.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; We don't have to go and tote it out
[1:51:15] loud. Oh, I've got a revelation. It's in
[1:51:17] you. Other people are saying, "What do
[1:51:19] you have? What makes you that way? What
[1:51:22] produces this kind of people? What makes
[1:51:24] these kind of young people? What makes
[1:51:26] these kind of families?" I can tell you
[1:51:28] the revelation of the opening of God's
[1:51:30] word.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; And if you read it, if you absorb it and
[1:51:37] the same power of the Holy Ghost that
[1:51:39] brought it ignites it within you,
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; you'll be transformed person. I assure
[1:51:46] you that
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; how much of Christianity believes he was
[1:51:54] either Jew or Gentile. Then you have a
[1:51:56] messenger come says he was neither Jew
[1:51:59] nor Gentile.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; What was he in between?
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; He's one who could stand in between and
[1:52:08] take a hold of the Jew that had the word
[1:52:10] of the Old Testament. take a hold of the
[1:52:12] Gentile and bring them together in one
[1:52:15] Jesus Christ.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; I have a hard time because there's so
[1:52:21] many many places that I could go at this
[1:52:23] time. I'm not going to. But he stood
[1:52:25] between the two.
[1:52:30] Hallelujah.
[1:52:32] He leaves the throne.
[1:52:36] To be an intercessor is a slain lamb. to
[1:52:38] be a lion king to bring the world to
[1:52:42] judgment who has rejected this message.
[1:52:47] Now you understand perhaps
[1:52:50] why brother Brandham could not preach
[1:52:52] certain messages
[1:52:55] until the seals were open.
[1:52:58] I indict this generation
[1:53:00] for the second crucifixion of Jesus
[1:53:03] Christ. I indict this generation. This
[1:53:05] generation you and I live in and you and
[1:53:07] I work in has been indicted
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; under the indictment of almighty God.
[1:53:12] And that is why it goes the way it goes.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Is there no
[1:53:19] is there no boundaries of shame? Not
[1:53:22] that I know of.
[1:53:25] There's there's no consciousness of
[1:53:27] shame in the world.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Are insanity are people of insanity are
[1:53:33] they in institutions? No, they're on the
[1:53:35] streets.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Is this violence contained? No, it isn't
[1:53:42] contained.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Do men have the answer? No. It's obvious
[1:53:47] they don't have the answer.
[1:53:51] Don't have the answer for anything.
[1:53:56] We've heard it declared in my lifetime
[1:53:58] and yours that we'll put this kind of a
[1:54:01] a union together, a League of Nations, a
[1:54:03] United Nations, an ecumenical movement,
[1:54:06] and we'll bring peace.
[1:54:08] It's not peace. You know, it's not
[1:54:10] peace.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; You know, it's more trouble.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; They're trying right now, right here in
[1:54:19] our city.
[1:54:21] And we've got police officers called
[1:54:23] peace officers.
[1:54:25] in this congregation,
[1:54:27] men of rank and men of respect.
[1:54:30] I worry about them.
[1:54:34] Not worry, worry, anxious, but I I
[1:54:36] concerned about them. Such violence.
[1:54:40] I'm almost ashamed to be a citizen of
[1:54:44] this nation when they make and they
[1:54:47] can't seem to even
[1:54:51] get any control.
[1:54:54] people being gunned down, women being
[1:54:57] gunned down.
[1:55:03] You know, we have the only the only
[1:55:05] place in Canada, the only place in
[1:55:07] Canada
[1:55:09] down in Vancouver
[1:55:11] where all the drug drug addicts line up
[1:55:17] about 900
[1:55:20] and they're lined up when the place
[1:55:23] opens because they can go in. And you
[1:55:26] know, if you you probably couldn't get
[1:55:29] in, but when you get in, I've seen a
[1:55:32] documentary on it. And they just go down
[1:55:35] big baskets full of drugs.
[1:55:40] Heroin,
[1:55:41] cocaine,
[1:55:43] all the all the drugs, and they pick the
[1:55:47] drug that they're taking. They get a
[1:55:50] clean needle
[1:55:52] and they go in and no one is able to
[1:55:54] give them the shot, but they give
[1:55:56] themselves the shot under under
[1:55:58] supervision.
[1:56:00] And they say that that's the answer to
[1:56:03] our drug problem.
[1:56:06] Friends,
[1:56:08] I'm not here to even talk about those
[1:56:10] things. I'm just saying it's completely
[1:56:13] out of control.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. until man's mind has become so
[1:56:18] twisted till they actually give the
[1:56:20] thing that is killing the people and
[1:56:22] saying, "Well, this is keeping them
[1:56:24] alive."
[1:56:26] That's not the answer.
[1:56:28] There's people and and there's a there's
[1:56:31] a a an author of a book. I wouldn't even
[1:56:34] have you read the book. I've read just
[1:56:36] little clips of it. He was 25 years the
[1:56:41] Vancouver Sun reporter of the courts.
[1:56:45] And when they were interviewing him,
[1:56:46] they asked him, "Do you think you've
[1:56:48] become cynical?" He said, "Yeah, I guess
[1:56:51] I have." He said, "When I see people,
[1:56:55] men, and see policemen who have risked
[1:56:58] their lives and may get gunned down with
[1:57:01] a sought-off shotgun and break into a
[1:57:04] place and catch uh catch drug dealers in
[1:57:07] the very act." And this is the one
[1:57:09] account I actually read, a Supreme Court
[1:57:12] judge here.
[1:57:14] And they brought the men into court.
[1:57:17] And what the judge began to do was to
[1:57:20] cross-examine
[1:57:22] the police officer,
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; And he said, "What did you see?" He
[1:57:27] said, "Well, we have been following this
[1:57:28] man." And we were following and we
[1:57:31] identified both of them are drug
[1:57:33] dealers. And we came right to the house
[1:57:35] and we're waiting there. And the one man
[1:57:38] handed a package to the other man. And
[1:57:41] at that moment, they moved in and
[1:57:42] arrested them both. And those guys are
[1:57:44] right there. And this judge said, "Was
[1:57:47] there anything so unusual that one man
[1:57:50] hands another one a package?" And he
[1:57:51] dismissed the case and sent both of
[1:57:54] those men out. And this reporter said,
[1:57:56] "Yeah, I guess I am cynical." Well, I'm
[1:57:58] not cynical
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; because I have a message and have an
[1:58:03] answer for that.
[1:58:07] You know, friends, you're hearing maybe
[1:58:09] someone out streaming
[1:58:11] and maybe you're a visitor here saying,
[1:58:13] "Well, I I've had people say, "I've
[1:58:14] never heard William Brandom." I can tell
[1:58:16] you one thing, your church leaders have.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; I can tell you the Vatican knows about
[1:58:21] him.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; I can tell you they got the books
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; in their in their library.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, they do.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that the ecumenical
[1:58:30] council knows about them.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; I can tell you about millions of people
[1:58:34] know about them. I can tell you the or
[1:58:36] Roberts Society Association knows about
[1:58:38] them. And uh and and Tommy Osbborne, all
[1:58:40] those people. Tommy Osbborne took a
[1:58:42] whole package of of of tapes. Tommy
[1:58:44] Osbbor took a whole box of tapes from
[1:58:48] brother Perry Green and went up with his
[1:58:50] wife Daisy up into the mountains to hear
[1:58:53] those tapes. And and and the one that
[1:58:55] was even called under Brother Bram felt
[1:58:58] the call under Brother Bram's ministry.
[1:58:59] He was in the meeting where that maniac
[1:59:01] came and fell on Brother Bram's feet.
[1:59:04] They all know what it is.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Leaders know what it is. And here are
[1:59:09] you and I are little individuals just
[1:59:13] trying to make our way through life.
[1:59:15] Aren't you glad God found you?
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that he found you and
[1:59:20] you heard his voice?
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; We weren't in any special elite place,
[1:59:24] but by favor,
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; he showed favor.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; And when he identified you for favor,
[1:59:39] then he could do one thing and that's
[1:59:42] give you mercy.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; You talk about mercy. You talk about we
[1:59:46] talk about grace. Grace, you talk about
[1:59:47] mercy.
[1:59:50] You're not just forgiven. He's he can
[1:59:52] say to you this mercy seat say I
[1:59:55] abolished
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; your transgression in my flesh.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; You see the mercy seat? I abolished it.
[2:00:03] Hallelujah.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; No wonder we can sing I'm free.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Free.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Free.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I feel like singing. I
[2:00:14] feel like shouting. I feel like dancing.
[2:00:17] I tell you what, friends. The best place
[2:00:18] in the world is when I get uh the the
[2:00:21] the message of the word. And it just is
[2:00:24] such a freedom, such a liberty to us.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:38] Do you feel his hand?
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Put his hand on you.
[2:00:45] I I feel privileged the way God leads
[2:00:48] different individuals here.
[2:00:54] Sister Alice Grant,
[2:00:58] her daddy's brother Neville.
[2:01:01] How many didn't know that?
[2:01:04] Raise your hands.
[2:01:06] See all those folks, Ellis, they don't
[2:01:08] know your brother Neville's daughter
[2:01:11] and her daughter here with her.
[2:01:17] And I look down.
[2:01:20] I remember when she was a teenager.
[2:01:25] I remember counseling
[2:01:29] and I remember even the words that were
[2:01:31] spoken.
[2:01:33] And I said, "Sister Alice,
[2:01:37] you can either heap honor
[2:01:41] or disgrace on your father's head."
[2:01:46] And you chose to honor him.
[2:01:49] and your mother. And he was pastor at
[2:01:52] the tabernacle and brother Brham spoke
[2:01:55] so highly of him
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; and we're thankful for him
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; and his life and your mother that raised
[2:02:02] you and now that you have daughters
[2:02:04] here, God bless you. Amen. To me, that's
[2:02:09] grace.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; To me, that's a wonderful thing. Yes, it
[2:02:13] is.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; To me, it's a glorious thing
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; that you come through what you've come
[2:02:18] through and you're here.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; This mercy seat.
[2:02:29] What what wonderful
[2:02:31] what wonderful privilege we have. I want
[2:02:35] to sing the song. I know in whom I have
[2:02:37] believed.
[2:02:39] I need some help here. Brother, oh,
[2:02:42] brother Derek, God bless you.
[2:02:45] Make sure he has some power on his
[2:02:47] microphone, please. Wonder if you'll
[2:02:49] stand with me. I know in whom I have
[2:02:50] believed and I hope I didn't wear you
[2:02:53] out, but
[2:02:55] tonight, Brother Dier is speaking.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:09] Folks, I didn't come here just to have
[2:03:11] church. I came here to rejoice and to
[2:03:12] worship God.
[2:03:14] And this song has special meaning to me
[2:03:17] because it was a song they were singing
[2:03:21] as we were just going out under our
[2:03:23] arrest in China.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; And they began to sing, I'm just moving
[2:03:29] out amongst all these wonderful
[2:03:31] believers.
[2:03:34] I know in whom I've believe it and am
[2:03:37] persuaded that he is able. Oh,
[2:03:41] hallelujah.
[2:03:42] That old one, sister woman, I believe
[2:03:44] her name is Sister Cow, just a going by
[2:03:47] her. She's sitting there on that little
[2:03:49] plastic stool. God bless her gallant
[2:03:51] soul is stood there and I'm just going
[2:03:53] by and all these police all around. She
[2:03:56] says, "Hallelujah."
[2:03:59] That's an international word. I didn't
[2:04:02] know any Chinese and probably she didn't
[2:04:04] know any English, but that's one word we
[2:04:06] both connected on. Hallelujah.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Put her fist right up in front of all
[2:04:12] those men. Uh, I love that. So, you can
[2:04:15] sing it with me.
[2:04:20] A wonderless
[2:04:23] to me.

[2:07:30] And the great white throne judgment.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; You folks ought to rejoice.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; I'll be sitting on the other side.
[2:07:40] You'll be sitting on the other side.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; You've lived your testimony.
[2:07:46] You've gone through it here. You've gone
[2:07:48] through all the fingerpointing
[2:07:52] and whatever persecution God allows you
[2:07:54] to bear. We've gone through it on this
[2:07:56] side. We've identified ourselves with
[2:07:59] the crucified one.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Not just in our mental. He is the word
[2:08:03] that's been crucified. You've been
[2:08:05] identified with the word that's been
[2:08:07] crucified the second time.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:13] [Music]
[2:08:15] And I'm persuaded
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; that he's able.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Uh I am I am redeemed. I am redeemed.
[2:08:27] Yeah. Then we're going to pray. Brother
[2:08:29] Tom, would you be able to pray for us? I
[2:08:32] am redeemed.
[2:08:33] If anybody asks you
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; who I am,
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; tell them.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; I'm redeemed.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed.
[2:08:53] I've been
[2:08:55] a great price. Lord Jesus
[2:08:59] has changed my whole life.

[2:12:10] this morning. Hallelujah. The lion of
[2:12:13] the tribe of Judah hath prevailed.
[2:12:16] Father, with uplifted hearts and hands,
[2:12:18] we rejoice knowing, Lord, you sent out a
[2:12:21] mighty voice. And that voice has changed
[2:12:24] us, Lord. How thankful we are this
[2:12:26] morning that we can say, "I've been
[2:12:28] redeemed by a word that has carried
[2:12:30] blood and it has washed us. It has
[2:12:33] cleansed us. And now we are the sons and
[2:12:35] daughters of God." What a message we
[2:12:38] believe. And we're thankful for a
[2:12:40] messenger that has come. Thankful for a
[2:12:43] voice within a voice. Lord, we're asking
[2:12:46] that your children go under this great
[2:12:49] rejoicing, Lord. Coming back tonight
[2:12:52] again, rejoicing in the goodness of God.
[2:12:55] We love your messenger. We love your
[2:12:57] message. And we are not ashamed of this
[2:13:00] gospel, Lord. For it is the power of God
[2:13:02] unto salvation to them that believe. And
[2:13:05] we can say this morning, I am a believer
[2:13:08] of the bleeding word. Let that word wash
[2:13:11] us Lord. Cleanse us and change us to go
[2:13:15] in this rapture.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Lord go with us now. Bless your servant.
[2:13:20] Strengthen him in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ask you start.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; If anybody asks you shake hands with one
[2:13:30] another while you say this. If anybody
[2:13:35] ask you
[2:13:37] just who I am, oh tell me
[2:13:43] I am. If anybody ask you once again.
[2:13:48] Oh, if anybody
[2:13:51] they ask you
[2:13:53] just who I am,
[2:13:57] tell them
[2:13:59] I am redeemed.
[2:14:04] God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:14:06] name. And I bring you greetings also
[2:14:09] from brother Ron Peterson if I haven't
[2:14:12] already said so. Greetings also from
[2:14:15] brother Vin Dial who we communicated
[2:14:18] with yesterday and greetings to you uh
[2:14:22] from the body of Christ.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; everywhere.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. You're
[2:14:30] dismissed in Jesus name.
