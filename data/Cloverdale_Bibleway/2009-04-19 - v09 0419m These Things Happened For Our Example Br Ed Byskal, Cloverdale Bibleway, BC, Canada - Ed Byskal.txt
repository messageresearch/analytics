Description:
Video message by Br Ed Byskal, following God's Message of Malachi 4:5-6 that was sent to the world through Br William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Oh Lord, your love is life to me. My truest longing. Oh, without you one moment, I don't know where I'd be. Your love is life. Your love is life to me, Lord. Your love is life to me. My truest longing, my deepest need. Without you one moment, I don't know where I'd be. Your love is life to me. [Music] Amen. It's good to see everyone this morning. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's turn on the screen to number uh 11:18, the song we learned a couple of weeks ago. And uh I trust everyone knows what El Shadai means. Of course, if you're in the message, you heard Brother Brandham talk about El Shadai. And um we pronounce things differently. I you know we say hagi right and in Hebrew it's actually haggai. When I was over in Israel I I couldn't talking about these books in the Bible that I never heard of before. It's cuz they pronounce them the right way. And we've got this English messed up version. Anyways, brother Brandham said that L means the strong one. Shai, the sufficient one, the lifegiver, the almighty, the strong one. Abraham, you're a hundred years old, old and weak, but I am your strength. And I just finished going through the book of Job. Job drew his strength from El Shadai. Elshadai is used 48 times in the Old Testament. 30 of those in the book of Job. And this song also talks about Adoni. Adoni is Lord. Amen. It signifies ownership or masterership and indicates that God is the owner of each person and that he consequently claims the unrestricted obedience of everyone. I mean that's his claim on you. Amen. So when you say Lord Adonai and I one of the most moving things I ever saw was I was at the the hotel the Western Wall in Jerusalem and a rabbi um who Cindy and I spent some time with got up and he just started calling on God Adoni. Adonai. And to hear those words echo in that area I mean it was just you can sense the spirit of God and God you know we know he's moving off the gentile people. He's moving on into Israel. And I'm just so thankful that in this dark age, Amen, we've been able to see the light. So, let's stand and we can sing this song together. Let's just worship him, saints. Focus everything you have on him. Father of life, seated on your throne of grace, only by mercy we are saved. [Music] And Lord, you have said that if we call upon your name, we families would be saved. So we cry out to your name. God of praise for those Jesus Christ and we rely on your grace. Crown in praise. Lord most high Jesus Christ. Father of love, never failing to forive. Each moment is a gift from you to me. And we're only here to tell the world about your grace. Till the day you take us all away. Lord, we will cry out your name. El God of grace [Music] high Jesus Christ. We rely we rely Lord on your way. I crown in praise. Oh, Jesus Christ. [Applause] So we cry. [Music] I got praise [Music] Jesus Christ. We are glorious. [Music] [Music] [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Hey [Music] Jesus Christ. [Music] [Music] [Applause] Jesus Christ. [Music] So many times I've questioned certain circumstances for things I could not understand. And many times in trials, weakness blurs my vision. It's when my frustration gets so out of hand. [Music] Instead, I am reminded that I've never been forsaken. I've never had to stand one test. As I look at all the victories, then the spirit rises up in me. And it's through the fire. My weakness is made strong. Oh, he never promised that would not be you would not be he never [Music] standing in the valley of the adversary stand [Applause] just will show up and he will take you to the king. I know. I know that in myself that I will surely perish. Oh, but if I trust the hand of God, he'll seal the flames again. He never promised that would not be or he would not be. Heat. Heat. [Music] See the way you say the adversary is [Applause] just [Music] you. He never promised that he would not be Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. and he will take you through the fire again. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Let's sing. God will make a way where there seems to be a no way. It's number 280. God will make a way where there seems to be no way. He works in ways we cannot see. He will make the way for me. He will be my God. Holding closely to his side with love and strengthful reach today. He will make the way. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know that God will make a way. Oh, God will take away where there seems to be no way. He works in ways we cannot see. He will make a way for me and he will be my guide. Hold me closely to his side with love strength for each new day. [Music] &gt;&gt; I know that God will make it again. I know that pro way where there seems to be no way. For he works in ways we cannot see. He will make a way for me. He will be my God. He'll be my God. Hold me closely to his side. with love and strength. For each day he will make a way. &gt;&gt; I know that God will make the way. Hallelujah. Let's just worship him, saints.

They hear the words that proceed from your mouth, oh God. It's our desire, Lord. It's our desire, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I'm going to ask our brother Derek Paris. Brother Derek, if you'd come open the service service in a word of prayer, a request this morning from the Zacharys that we pray for family friend Bill Wright. He has suffered a major stroke. Their daughters asked that we pray this morning. And also there's a request, brother Bisced on that we have prayer for sister Angela Michel's mother lives in Switzerland. She's 89 years old and had a bad fall in the night. Resulted in a a cut uh seven or eight inches long. It required stitches. They just want to pray for her recovery and that there'll be no complications. If you've got a need this morning, just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen. [Music] Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Why don't we just go to him in prayer now? Each and every one in your own way. Father, it's so good to sit at your feet this morning at the foot of Calvary, Lord, and lift our eyes, Lord. You are our help. You're our shelter, Lord. You're the cleft and the rock, Lord. When you come, you make a difference. The lame walk. The blind eyes are open and they see. The dumb speak, Lord. Lord, when you come near, lives are changed. Lord, you're the difference maker today. Lord, we're representation, Lord, of your grace. Lord, each of us that stand here under the banner banner of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We've come with open hearts, Lord. We've come with open minds, laid aside our own ideas, Lord, asking, Father, that you would speak once again, Lord, that you would take the man of God who set himself aside. Lord, he has studied. He's labored before you that he may come this morning and not bring his thoughts, but your thoughts. He would bring your word, Lord, that's eternal. That it could have a value and a benefit in our lives today. Lord, give us ears to hear. Give us eyes to see. Lord, if there's any sick among us, may you come and heal them, Father. Lord, there have been requests that have been penned down. Lord, in Switzerland, out on this streaming audience this morning, Lord, members of our own congregation are desiring for a healing touch from the master. Trouble the water once more. Lord, sometimes we know what it takes to be healed, but Lord, there is no one to take us any further. We're asking, Lord, that you would come. You would take us, oh God, into your hands this morning. Give us the strength to reach out and touch the very hem of your garment. Oh God, may faith arise in our souls, Jesus. Lord, not only for a healing of the body, not only for a healing of the spirit, but of the soul &gt;&gt; worth 10,000 worlds. Come and do a miracle in our midst this morning. We'll be sure to give you all the praise and the honor and the glory that's due your wonderful, marvelous name. We commit this service to you. The needs, Lord, of each and everyone's hand that was lifted before you. Those on the streaming audience, Lord, that are desiring to reach through the cloud of darkness to reach you, Father. Touch them this morning. We give it all to you in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. And you can have your seats. We have one announcement this morning and that's uh that there's going to be a short but very important meeting for the grad parents in the music room after the morning service. So, if you've got um son or daughter who's graduating from high school this year, um you're in you're asked to meet for a very short meeting in the music room. Amen. We have a special this morning for our from our sister Liz neighbor. Sister Liz, if you'd come at this time. And as she's coming, let's sing. It's me, it's me, O Lord, standing in the need of prayer. How many could use some prayer this morning? Amen. It's me. It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. It's me. It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. Not my father, not my mother, but it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. Not my sister or my brother, but it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. Well, it's me. It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. It's me, me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. [Music] Set aside I set for the Holy Ghost to pray through. [Music] I wait for words to reach these lips to set in motion change. I have no way by fleshly mind to know the glorious things he'll do. I'm just set aside [Music] in prayer. [Music] I abide. [Music] Impossible, unthinkable, amazing what God does. He orchestrates all circumstance. His ways are far above. The winds of sovereignty now blow across the saint that groans to convey the will of God on earth in human hearts reborn. [Music] Set aside. I separate for the Holy Ghost to pray through. I wait for words to reach these lips to set in motion change. I have no way by fleshly mind to know the glorious things he'll do. I'm set aside in prayer. [Music] I abide [Music] Faith gives forth an utterance my eyes can't visualize. eyes. Truth resounds within my frame. Though vile dark forces lie, these stages of deliverance are seasons to refine. [Music] hardship molded voices confirmed by supernatural signs. It's the victory of submission that releases the power of God. A selfless realm untouched by man where he reveals his will and plan. A father's faith reached a prodal son. Feeding with the swine legion the demon bound a man till the son of God restored his mind. And for one lost lamb, you leave the 90 and nine running, seeking, pursuing to restore them one more time. I'm set aside for the Holy Ghost to break through. I wait for words to reach these lips to set in motion change. I have no way by fleshly mind to know the glorious things he'll do. I'm satisfied. Lord, set aside. Set aside in prayer. [Music] I abide. [Music] Amen. Sister Liz, we want to abide in him. We're going to have a baby dedication at this time. Uh, Brother All and Sister Yolindy are going to dedicate their little one as they come and Brother Ed's going to be coming. Let's sing together number 753. I am so glad that our father in heaven tells of his love. I am so glad that our father in heaven tells of his love in the book he has given wonderful things. Bible I see this is the dearest that Jesus loves me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves even me. Oh, I forget him and wonder away. Still he doth love me wherever I stray. back to his dear loving arms would I flee when I remember that Jesus loves me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Amen. Well, it's a it's a privilege really uh real privilege to have our brother Alan Dega, Sister Yolindy, and their growing family. Wonderful. Uh you know why this is a little bit extra special? I think if I'm correct, uh, Sister Yolindy and her family were visiting in our home. affirmative. And Allan was a a loose young man just drifting around and was doing a little bit of work in here. And and for some reason, I'm not too sure, but he came into my home uh right while Yolindy and her her parents were sitting in the front room visiting. And you know what happened? Just sparks instantly. Immediate sparks. And that was the end or that was the beginning. So this has a special special meaning for me. So here we are with you know some sparks that started in my front room and and now we've got all these children. My uh Joshua and Caroli is it good? Got that? Uh, and we're going to be dedicating Matthew. And we have also Elijah. I tell you what, we got a whole congregation right here. All we need is the spirit of all of these on the spirit of all of these on this family. &gt;&gt; So, we're we're dedicating Matthew especially, but brother Allan said he would like to dedicate the whole family. Uh, brother Allan, Sister Yolindi along with Sister Yolindy's family are living in Maine. They did live in Seattle and of course they're here visiting the family. Uh, Brother Don and Darla and brother Leon Leon and Brenda. And it's, uh, it's been too long. So, they're up in Maine at this time living there. And uh so we are praying that God will just guide them and lead them. Brother Brandham spoke about uh it was actually in a in a a service of water baptism but he said that the children are too young to be baptized. Matthew's too young to be baptized. And baptism is an outward expression of an inward work. a inward work of grace that's been done and the child cannot express it because there hasn't been any inward work of grace and because it's just a baby. But he said it's the parents bringing the baby to God who gave them the child giving it back to him in dedication. Those are very, you know, I know we understand that this act is that, but that's very, very powerful. And I was thinking since we spoke about having this dedication, brother Allen, of of when Moses, the prophet of God, the first prophet, gave the instruction for the family, and it was a dreadful time because death was in the land. And I would have to say death's in the land. Again, I'm sure that we all agree death is in the land everywhere. And outside of the token, death is everywhere. And God gave instructions through the his prophet at that time. And now, brother Brandham refers back to it in the token, a lamb for a house. And the only thing the lamb represented was a life. So we have to say a life for a house. And the father, brother Allan, was to take that lamb. And he said he could have had a barrel of blood at the door, but it wouldn't have done any good. And the eldest son, and you do have a son, that's the eldest, Joshua, and he would he would see the black wings of death coming through the land and hear the screams and the calls and and today, I tell you what, friends, we hear a lot of noise out there, but to me, it's just screams of death. Daddy, are you sure? Are you sure? And the only thing that the father could say we have done exactly what God's prophet has said. But the thing was that he stressed was it had to be applied and applied is lived. They had to actually live. And so the lives of you, brother Allen, and you sister Yolendi will have the greatest influence upon these children. And if we don't apply the life, and that is for all parents that are here, when you're living it, you're actually applying the life over the family. And that is what God's requirement. Take this word, this this message which God has sent the promise for this time and apply it to the family. And that's is that is the word of God and that's our promise. And so we dedicate Matthew to the Lord. Brother Brandham prayed a wonderful prayer. And I would like to just give a part of this prayer before I pray. Lord, we are indeed privileged people to live in a country where we still have a freedom of worship and where we have a government that protects us and gives us this God-given heritage that we do not have to go according to the state or church or some dictator type, but we can come to thee and that we're convinced in our heart. We pray that this will last long until Jesus comes. said, "How many people are bringing their little children day after day and week after week as you give them into our arms and the care of their father and mother, Lord, to us as elders of the church and we by prayer offer them to thee." And I pray God that you'll take each of these darling, these little darlings this morning and will consecrate their lives to thee. And bless their homes that they come from. And may their father and mother be so dedicated to you that the children will be raised up in a Christian home to serve you all the days of their lives. And I tell you that prayer, that's all I need is to have that prayer fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And we're going to dedicate Matthew to the Lord. Matthew, you're going to come to me. That's a boy. He's comfortable here on the platform. Heavenly Father, this darling child that you have given to brother Allan and Sister Yolendi, we're so thankful for Matthew that they've given him this name, Lord. And I pray that the Holy Spirit of God will rest upon this child all the days of his life. May he have a sweet peace about him. May he be a great joy in this family. I pray that you'll keep him in good health. And as he hears the name of Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, he will come to love that name and love that person and love that presence that he when he gets understanding, he will love your word. And Lord, if it should be that he is living and and he's of the age of accountability, may he receive you into his heart. I pray that his father, brother Allan, and sister Yolindi, his mother, will live for you, oh God, all the days of their lives and be an example to him. I dedicate Matthew now, Lord Jesus, in your name, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless Matthew. God bless you. to Lindy Joshua. God bless you. Hallelujah. What a fine family. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody feeling good? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hungry? &gt;&gt; Nice to have uh you all here? I uh want to let you know also that brother Timothy Ma is back from Vietnam. We're thankful for that. About two and a half months in Vietnam. Was intending on being about three, but had a very profitable time. Brother Dier is back from Ghana. And I've already heard from Ghana that they've had a just an exceptional time in meetings, six services. So, we're so happy about that. And we are indeed thankful for uh the all of those that are streaming. You know, we speak about those that are streaming. And as we sit here, perhaps we don't realize that there's a congregation perhaps as many as are here and perhaps even more. And for those that are on the other side of the world, on the eastern side, they may not be able to get it until they're a able to archive the service or get it from the archives. But if you and I have not really checked recently at all, but it will be even four or 500 locations within about a week's time that have logged onto the service and and the reason I appreciate I appreciate all those that are streaming is because they worship with us. They pray when you're praying, sing when you're singing, and listen to the word and say, "Amen." as God registers it to their heart. And I just want them to know today that we appreciate it with all of our heart. And may God bless them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They send in their requests and desire that God will hear their prayers. And I know that he will. They love the same message that you love. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Oh, what a gathering that's going to be. What a gathering. What a time that's going to be. And so, we're really thankful. I wanted to also let the church know that uh I had mentioned at the last meeting that we were sending uh some some funds to to Moscow to the building of the church there. And uh we I just got a short email and I just felt a real pull in my heart. So I took a step of faith whether it's on behalf of those that are here present and and those that the Lord speaks to. Sometimes it's someone even on the internet that is streaming and saying you know God touched my heart. I've had pastors call me and say we'd like to be part of uh helping to build a church in Moscow. It's not building buildings or building an organization. Friends, what it is is just giving people a place to worship. They don't have a place to worship. There's three congregations right now. And so it's so so important. Uh and we've uh we we sent another $15,000 US this last week and wired it over. Uh and just to just to encourage them to keep keep it going. And I I've asked them to respond back to us and let us know when they might be able to be in, when it will be covered in, uh when they expect to perhaps have the first service. They were just putting they hadn't got the roof on yet. And so remember them. I I wish I could put on the screen for you their worship and their singing and in the uh under the difficult circumstances that they have. We're so privileged and I hope we never take uh the liberty that we have and the freedom that we have for granted. I pray that you all, young and old, will be thankful that you're living where you're living and you have the home that you have and you have the friends that you have. You have the church that you have. And uh as long as we're here, let's serve God with all of our heart. &gt;&gt; Thank you for that. I really appreciate that. And so I I hope that you will uh have trust and confidence. I really felt uh led of the Holy Spirit to do that. be praying for some meetings that are coming up in another week and a half in in in Switzerland and then about another three weeks later in in Germany as well, not far from Dooldorf. Uh and uh so we're just seeking to know God's will in all of these things. Amen. Before we uh read the scripture, I would like to have you stand and I want to sing two verses of a song of brother Rod, if you help us, please. Uh, whiter than snow. Whiter than snow. The first verse and the last verse. And I have read these over. I have sang these over to myself, and I want you then to to think about them. Also, uh, Brother Ernie, is there anything further about Brother Nanding? Uh, have we heard anything further? I spoke quite extensively about him on on Wednesday. Is there anything further just recent that you could &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. All right. All right. [Music] &gt;&gt; Perfectly whole. I want thee forever to live in my soul. Break down every idle, cast out every f. Now wash me and I shall be wider than snow. Oh, wider than snow. Yes, wider than snow. Now wash me and I shall be wider than snow. The blessing by faith I receive from above. Oh glory my soul is made perfect in love. My prayer has prevailed at this moment. I am whiter than snow. Whiter than snow. Yes, whiter than snow. How is the pride? I am wider than snow. &gt;&gt; I'd like to get that last verse up again so we can all sing it together. The blessings by faith I receive from above. I want that to be current. &gt;&gt; Amen. is made perfect in love. My prayer has been has prevailed and this moment I know the blood is applied and I am whiter than snow. Every person needs to know that. Have full assurance. Maybe have it reaffirmed within us. Let's sing that last verse again and then sing the chorus as a prayer please. The blessing by faith I receive from above. Oh glory, my soul is made perfect in love. My prayer has prevailed. And this moment I know the blood is a blood. I am quieter than snow. Oh, wer than snow. Wer than snow. The blood is not. I am wider than snow. Let's just join in prayer. Father, &gt;&gt; you're the author of salvation. You have designed this redemptive plan. You have ordained that we would be redeemed by the sacrifice of your own son, Jesus Christ. How willingly you gave yourself, Lord Jesus. How we love you because you first loved us. You loved us so much that you gave yourself freely. &gt;&gt; You gave yourself completely. You were able to say, "It is finished." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We are purchased. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are redeemed. &gt;&gt; Satan's hold is broken. &gt;&gt; Prison bars are broken and burst apart. Jesus. Oh, the gates of hell cannot prevail against the church of the living God. Father, we're based upon that firm conviction and foundation. Thank you for your word that has come. And now I pray, Lord, you will give your Holy Spirit to anoint the word, to utter the words, I pray. And may this day be a special day. I pray this morning and this evening, Father, as we gather, we gather, Lord, in this evening time, we gather in this end time, oh God, to prepare ourselves and make ourselves ready for what you have ordained and planned for us. Bless all who are with us on the internet and those that are throughout this building, Lord, and in the sanctuary. In Jesus Christ's name, we dedicate ourselves to you. Amen. And God bless you. Take your Bibles if you would, and I'll have you turn to Luke's Gospel, the 24th chapter. I will begin reading at verse 13. And this, for all of you that are not aware, this is the text uh to brother Brandham's second last service that he spoke. So that you'll just be mindful of that starting at verse 13. And behold, two of them went the same day to a village called Emmas, which was from Jerusalem about three score furongs. And they talked together of all these things which had happened. Notice what they were talking about. And it came to pass that while they communed together, number one, and reasoned, number two, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. And their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, "What manner of communication are these that you have one to another, as you walk, and are sad?" And the one of them whose name was Cleopus answering said unto them unto him, "Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?" And he said unto them, "What things?" And they said unto him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet, mighty in deed and word uh before God and all the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been him had been he which should have redeemed Israel." And beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done. Yay. And certain women also of our company made us astonished, which uh were early at the sephiler. And when they found not his body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he is alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sephiler, and found it, even as the women had said, but him they saw not. Then he said unto them, "Oh fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken, ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?" And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. Amen. And may God bless his word and bless you and us together as we look at the scriptures. Just while we settle ourselves and just ask for your kind attention. Be real. focused if you would. Sometimes the uh things that God, you know, stirring in a in my heart at least, I can only speak for myself, uh is is very difficult to convey and and so we spend time studying, but a lot of my concern is for myself to be able to be a vessel so that I would be able to convey to you the way it comes to me. And that's not always very very clear because it's hard to take spiritual things and these are things that are from another realm, another dimension, try and bring them down into our world and into the realm of our understanding. And that's not really simple. So we need the spirit of God to give us inspiration, not just the speaker but everyone together. So we have inspiration so that we have revelation of the Holy Spirit. Uh now, brother Brham's last Easter message, actually I spoke a good deal about it last Sunday. His last Easter message was it is and notice very carefully, it is the rising of the sun. Not is it the rising of the sun, it is the rising of the sun. So now here's here's Almighty God and he has a a prophet messenger that has now for 33 years covered the earth with a ministry that has not been since the first man Adam walked. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no record in the scripture where anything of this nature ever took place where a man stood before tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. And if you a the aggregate number would be into the millions, seven times around the world, whether it be in Bombay or Durban or whether it be in Johannesburg or Houston or Chicago or or or Helsinki, Finland, where the boy was read raised from the dead and lives today, I understand, as a policeman. uh how how does how does uh a ministry like that not capture the world? &gt;&gt; How do how is the ministry of Jesus? How did it not even capture Palestine? &gt;&gt; Because there's other forces and there's a very clear it's very evident that that uh this is Satan's Eden as the scripture has said. And uh and so uh now this last uh the last Easter service I will call it the resurrection message. It is the rising of the sun. God is giving an announcement and he knows that God alone knows that in a few short months this messenger's gone passed off the scene. And if you watch the me if you watch the messages carefully 1965 messages uh now it is the rising of the sun he brother Brandham goes to Mark the 16th chapter which begins out begins like very early in the morning the women went to the selicer. It gives that account. And then his second last service. Now that was the that was the resurrection or Easter. We'd say Easter, but I'll call it the resurrection message. His last one. It is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; And he stated very very clearly in that. It was a declaration. He tells of the sword in his hand. tells of the angels that came. Uh speaks of the quickening power, speaks of that the bride is just is just unequivocal. The bride is a part of the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; She is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and spirit of his spirit. and how God created the uh first Adam and took from him the feminist spirit and put it in his wife. Uh and and they were they were one and the same. Now he's reaffirming and establishing all of that and it is the rising of the sun that we're back there again. And then his second last service, he comes to the same the same account only it's in Luke's gospel. And and you've heard me say this many times, but I I need to really captivate your mind with it. He brother Brandham now for the first time calls the resurrection uh the resurrection chapter. He calls it modern modern events. Not historical events. Not the event that happened in Luke 24 made clear but a modern event. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Made clear &gt;&gt; by the prophecy. &gt;&gt; So now Luke 24 becomes a prophecy. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we need to as you read that and as you look at that, you need to understand that God's messenger just maybe 4 hours of of preaching left on earth is telling everyone who has ears to hear that that chapter contains a prophecy. &gt;&gt; And a prophecy is something that is foretold that is to take place. And the key, the secret of it lays there because it is a prophecy. He said now in modern events, now it's always been the unchanging God's way to let his people forno before certain events happen. So he's he's starting out by telling it that the he said if the people in the days of the Lord Jesus would have only sought God and had known what was just about to take place. They would not have condemned Jesus to death. But the reason it was because the scripture had to be fulfilled because the Jews had to be blinded. Now the scripture has to be fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is certain. But it does not mean that we have to be uh we don't have to be blinded. We don't even have to have our vision obscured. &gt;&gt; Uh we can live in the full measure of our promise. &gt;&gt; And he said, so he said, uh do you realize uh that that's promised again in this very age that we're living in? They did what they did because they didn't know the scripture and they were blinded. &gt;&gt; And he said that that's promised again in this very age that we're living in. The Leodysian church, this seventh church age that we're living in now is naked, miserable, blind, and don't know it. The same as he blinded them back there for the purpose of getting his message through to the elected people. He's promised to do the same thing today. &gt;&gt; You re you realize what he's saying is that the blindness that's in the land &gt;&gt; if they had if they had just received the whole world, if the governments had received it, if the uh the Vatican had received it, if all the uh leaders, religious leaders and theologians had received it, you wouldn't have Right? &gt;&gt; Because it wouldn't have been it wouldn't have been a pure thing. They had to bl be blinded to it &gt;&gt; so that the elected would receive it. &gt;&gt; Part of the reason you received it is because it has been rejected. &gt;&gt; Now you may not understand that completely but just listen closely as we go. And then here in this scripture it is saying and they said and he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken. And I want to dwell on that in a in a few moments. So now and also in the per P per Panian church age he said everything that's written in the Old Testament that is in story form is written for our admonition so that we can learn from it. There's some scriptures which we have now all uh these things apostle Paul said to the Corinthians that all these things happened unto them. He spoke about how all were under the cloud and all crossed the Red Sea and all drank from the water of the rock. But he said, "Now all these things happened unto them. Some of them murmured and many fell in the wilderness and and they died in the wilderness and those that were 20 and under and and they were past probably 50 years old when they went in under Joshua." But now, Apostle Paul is going back and he's saying this. All of these things happened unto them for our example or in samples. &gt;&gt; All of it happened unto them and they are written for our admonition. Now he is Apostle Paul 2,000 years ago is drawing back some more time and speaking about Moses and saying all of that happened back there for your example and for our admonition. Now comes a messenger in the end time &gt;&gt; and he goes back to Luke 24 and he's saying this was written &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; and this happened to them &gt;&gt; for our admonition and our example &gt;&gt; I hope you can catch that &gt;&gt; then because that's really the basis this happened to those people these two men on the way to Emmas this resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and the people that were involved. Those things happened to them. Now, we wouldn't have known that. It would have just been an account of the resurrection except a messenger with thus said the Lord says this is a prophecy for us. &gt;&gt; I can't overstate that. I can't overemphasize that in the end time seed sign. He says, "All of us believe that we're in the end time. Any man that's intelligent, I believe if he would look around and see, it shows this that these things can't go on much longer. Anyone knows that something's got to happen. Here's the here's the point. All the scripture point to it." So now he's he's taking the scriptures and and that's what I want you to to see with me is where are the scriptures pointing? What are they pointing to? And what does that mean for us? And how should we respond? How should it uh affect our lives? My daily life, your daily life, how should it affect us in spiritual food in due season? And now here we are in due season in this end time. We notice here again, if the word is in us and has come to us as it did to Elijah in that day, it'll do the same thing that he did. He would feed on the secret things of God which is hid from the world because they're blinded to it. But he would be feeding on it. And he says it's hid to the world. And he says, "Oh, again, it makes the message and the messenger is one. The spiritual food I have it highlighted. The spiritual food is ready and it's in the season now. &gt;&gt; All we have to do is is I hope that we don't just listen to a Sunday morning service this morning. I'm seeking to draw out scripture out of the that the messenger has uh has selected that God if I believe in that thus sayeth the Lord. If I believe that there's the spirit of Elijah, as Elijah was called and sent out and protected, went to a secret place and fed. God secretly fed him. The world didn't know anything about it, but he was feeding on it. &gt;&gt; And he knew. No one had to come and educate him that this was food in due season. &gt;&gt; This is food to sustain me in this drought time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now we have the same spirit that is drawing the the promises of God and pointing it to a certain elect people. The blind will not accept it, will not receive it. But he says that this is our food in our season. This is here to carry us through to the objective timels his faith expressed. He says, "Remember Abraham wasn't in Sodom. He was already called out." &gt;&gt; We can say amen to that. &gt;&gt; He was already called out. And there was one stayed and talked with him. &gt;&gt; In the scripture which we in our scripture reading today, it says, "And Jesus himself drew near." And I love the next words. And went with them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He didn't just leave them to go down the path by themselves, but he drew near and he went with them. &gt;&gt; Even our father Abraham, he was already called out. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And there was one that stayed with him." Amen. &gt;&gt; The other two went to Sodom. &gt;&gt; Two Sodom and Gomorrah went to the city. And there was one that stayed with him and talked with him. And the one stayed and talked to him, showed him a sign with his back turned. He said Sarah was going, "See, I have to I have to speak this to you with every ounce of energy I have because I am a witness to you. I sat on the platform. I saw him turn his back. I saw him look up to the to the balcony, not the balcony, but the gable of the building, and call out people that I personally knew and tell them of events that I personally was aware of and even directly speak uh the burden of a man's heart and who he was praying for and where that man was at that moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is a sign of the resurrection, my brother. That's a sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; This testimony is for you people &gt;&gt; if you'll receive it. &gt;&gt; There may be a day, young people, that I won't be here. Don't forget that I stood here as an eyewitness and told you that the the sign of the resurrection has come. &gt;&gt; And you will not see it again. &gt;&gt; God will not raise it up again. He did it. He did it once &gt;&gt; 33 years. The same length of time as Jesus life. &gt;&gt; Jesus came and in his servant revealed himself again. &gt;&gt; And it is a resurrection sign. &gt;&gt; So these scriptures are not for people hundreds of years up the road. It's for some that are going to experience it now. [Music] When brother Brandon preached it is the rising of a sun, it was his last resurrection Easter service and now his second last service as I said earlier was the same account out of Luke 24 calling it a prophecy. But he starts not at the first verse. It says very early in the morning where he did at Easter, but he starts partway in the chapter. And two of them were on the way to Emmas because right at that point it is post &gt;&gt; resurrection. &gt;&gt; Very important. So now from his last Easter service to his second last service &gt;&gt; that he would ever speak. Now he starts the chapter the same account but post. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just after the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Remember Abraham wasn't in Sodom. one stayed with him with his back turned and he said Sarah was going to have a baby and we know that that child Isaac was a type of Christ. We're waiting and he waited on him. He said now that brings to pass today. that brings to pass today because we have faith and I know that this is of God is because this and other scriptures point to this hour. So he himself as the messenger was going back and taking the scriptures of Abraham seeing Elo Elohim stayed with him seeing that one revealed the secret of of Abraham's heart of Sarah's heart and gave the promise he revealed the secret of their heart but then added to it and I will surely come return unto thee according to the time of life I personal pronoun will surely return unto thee according to to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son. And here he said, "We're waiting for that son." &gt;&gt; So it went from Abraham to this prophet's time. He says, "I know that this is of God because it's it points to the today. It points to now." &gt;&gt; And now I'm pointing to scriptures which he spoke and left out pointing to this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You ought to listen to things that are to be. Those denominational people were there because it was Christian businessmen. And the atmosphere, you can almost cut it with a knife. It's ice cold. &gt;&gt; It's unresponsive. &gt;&gt; And he he drew them out at the end and said, I he didn't want to chastise them. He didn't want to he's not angry. Didn't want but it was the truth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And today, if we're not living where we ought to live, &gt;&gt; then we need to expect to hear the truth. &gt;&gt; Sufficiently so, so it'll jar us out of maybe the place that we're living presently because you might not be in a place where that word and where the current event is actually taking place. And we could be missing it like the two men on the way to Emmas. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we have we have uh two areas. Those when apostle Paul said all these things happened to them for our admonition and those were destroyed in the wilderness. But now we come to this scripture. So we have some that were destroyed in the wilderness and they never went into their inheritance. But now we have others that are slow of heart. They're not murmurers and complainers, but they're slow of heart to believe all. They're tardy. I looked up the word to see uh because the scripture says in Hebrews, "Let us therefore fear lest a promise," and here I am with the promises out of things that are to be out of Luke the 24th chapter, not an account of the resurrection, but promises because it's already been uh I've already been notified ahead of time that this is a promise for us. These are a prophecy promises for you that are sitting here today. And we are being warned. Don't let it miss you or don't let you miss it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me thus far? I'm going to go slow and be laborious over this. And so for those of you that are quicker in your mind, don't don't don't jump ahead because we we need to ponder these things very deeply. Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it. And the word short fits right in with slow of heart. To believe all that the prophets foretold. To be short is to lack or to be behind. Just to be behind to be slow to be leisurely &gt;&gt; to be casual about things. to be unhurried or to be delayed. When we're speaking about this, we don't want to be casual. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be delayed. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be just behind because that's exactly where the two on the way to Emmas. And I'm so thankful for the grace and longsuffering of our Lord Jesus Christ that he said he came on the pathway with them. What is this you're reasoning about? What is this you're speaking about? And went with them. because they were still they were under a cloud. &gt;&gt; They were believers but they couldn't see. &gt;&gt; And the prophet is saying to us, this is a prophecy of this time. And so I see here within the ranks of the message there are too many that are delayed, &gt;&gt; distracted, &gt;&gt; have their attention and their focus span too short. It's on something else &gt;&gt; and are not prepared to lay other things aside and make this the main focal point of their life. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we miss this, &gt;&gt; we miss everything. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here &gt;&gt; after the resurrection's happened &gt;&gt; and the saints have been changed and gone. I don't want to be here. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here. &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you out of my heart, I have fear for many that are in the message. Too many. &gt;&gt; Some preaching has to be preached. Something has to be said to jar us out of our &gt;&gt; out of our comfort zone. &gt;&gt; Going to have to be a change of our own mind and our own thoughts and our own perspective &gt;&gt; and our own agenda of what we have and we think is important. What you think is important needs to come down. I'm announcing that to you today. What you think is important needs to come down on your agenda. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what you hear on a Sunday morning or what you hear on a Wednesday or what you hear from any man God called man of God. And I feel very urgent upon myself as a pastor to say to you and try to be a shepherd to the flock to say to you that things which are perhaps are are just a Sunday go to meeting sermon young people and all that are here within the sound of my voice, it needs to come up to a different level. &gt;&gt; I'm announcing to you today that these things need to become number one in your life. How can it be, brother Visll? I'm working. I've got a job. I've got a It can be on your mind all the time. &gt;&gt; When I shave in the morning, I'm thinking about the scripture. When I'm standing there combing my hair, I'm thinking about what God's plan is, what God has in mind. When I'm driving down the road, I got God on my mind. &gt;&gt; I got heaven on my mind. You can have him on your mind, too. &gt;&gt; Washing the dishes, my sister. You can have him on your mind. And you need to have him on your mind. When is that resurrection taking place? Oh, God, let me be fully in tune. You know, we're in the NHL playoffs hockey. There's stations on the radio and it's the most amazing thing to me that they can almost speak 24 hours a day. Amen. &gt;&gt; And all they're talking about is all the statistics. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They can tell you who's first, who's second, who did this, and who bounced that ball, and do who made this basket, and who didn't do that, and what what salary he's getting, and who's open now for to be uh uh to be who who's a free market agent. I don't even know all the terminology. All I know is that they there's enough there for them to talk about it. and they are consumed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This message was sent to you to consume you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Didn't come to sit on a shelf. &gt;&gt; Didn't come to gather dust. &gt;&gt; Didn't come for any other purpose. It came to consume you. And you should know more about Luke 24 than you know about any any uh any hockey team or any basketball team or any other team. You should know more about this. &gt;&gt; This is God's prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm burning up, friends. &gt;&gt; I might be preaching straight through to this evening, Brother Tom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm dead serious. I'm dead serious about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we must not be slow. And the scripture says, "Seeing therefore it remainth." &gt;&gt; That some must enter therein. &gt;&gt; And I know that's even for this morning. &gt;&gt; There are some that are here that must enter in &gt;&gt; because God has called you to it. &gt;&gt; And you know that God has called you to it. and it cannot take the place that it's had in your life in the past. &gt;&gt; I'm down at your address, folks. &gt;&gt; It's got to take first place, &gt;&gt; and I'd like to know if you're prepared this morning to give it first place. I don't want to expand this kind of energy, this kind of twisting up within my own soul and know that I'm preaching and giving everything I can to it and even examining my own heart day by day by day. I if I if we miss this resurrection, we miss absolutely everything. &gt;&gt; I say, Lord Jesus, come on to my pathway and go with me all the way. You talk about a double measure of grace went with them to their own place to their own house and would not let them go till they expressed the character in them invited him into their home. &gt;&gt; And you need to express that character and invite him in to every area of your life, &gt;&gt; to every part of your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Slow, oh fools, he said, and slow of heart &gt;&gt; to believe all that the prophets, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; have spoken, slow, is dull, or of an inactive mind. It's amazing what can capture our attention. If you're completely taken over with what the baby beside you is doing or someone else and you're focused on that, you're not you're not able to really capture what the Holy Ghost perhaps is trying to convey to you. And you know, Satan's just smart enough to do that. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I was in a meeting. Brother Ernie's been in lots of meetings, outdoor and semioutdoor meetings, and a cat walked in. Why? You'd have thought the king of England or the president of the United States walked in. Everybody just the whole meeting came to a grinding halt. They all just look that cat. I just stopped preaching. And after a few moments, I said, "That's a cat." And the people caught how foolish it was for them to have been distracted and interrupt perhaps an anointed message because a cat walked in. Never saw a cat before. If the cat walked down the street, would they all stop on the street? Oh, no. It's the devil &gt;&gt; that gets people distracted because he wants them distracted. &gt;&gt; Inactive mind or slow to apprehend. Slow to take a hold of it. Heard it. Heard it. Heard it. Was touched. Yes, God spoke but failed to take a hold of it. Apprehend it. Apostle Paul said that I may apprehend that I may take a hold of that for which I am apprehended. He knew he had been apprehended. He knew that he had the shackles on him and he was a prisoner of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now their lives, these two on the way to Emmas, their lives are living out a prophecy for you. Exactly as the Apostle Paul said, those in the Old Testament were living out a prophecy for the people of his time. &gt;&gt; So they're examples unto us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, in the message, Events Made Clear by Prophecy, I would like to have had some of this on the screen for you, but I'm not I didn't have the time to do that. Brother Brandham says, and this are just a some uh some uh sentence, brief sentences, paraphrasing it. Said, "The Bible is a different book." Now, some of this is so elementary. Don't pass over it. Apprehend it. The Bible is a different book. It's a book of prophecy foretelling future events. It's also a revelation of Jesus Christ all the way from Genesis to Revelation brings him out in his fullness of what he was and is. He said the Bible is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In word form. &gt;&gt; You're going to You got a Bible? &gt;&gt; That's God &gt;&gt; in word form. and it is the book of God. He said the events that we see taking place, it's absolutely shown in the Bible of every age and we think we're out of cater. Now, the message today is to spread over a wide wide spectrum of believers from those that are slow to those that perhaps are far more advanced. And I also found and I have found and I've been concerned about even those who perhaps feel they're further up the road than others. But I have found where there are there are some and I've talked to some not just here but elsewhere and all of their enthusiasm, all their excitement is about what's going to happen, what's going to happen and and and and you know and the resurrection and the rapture and all the rapture and the rapture, listen friends, the rapture, you're going to be part of it if you're walking where you're supposed to be today. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham talks about what should we be doing, &gt;&gt; right? What should we be doing now? He said, if you're hoing potatoes, &gt;&gt; that's what you should be doing. &gt;&gt; Said, if you asked me what I would be doing today, he said, I would be studying and preparing &gt;&gt; for this meeting. &gt;&gt; Even if I knew the Lord was to come, I would be studying and getting ready for this meeting. Now, hold on to that. You say, "Well, shouldn't we be looking for the rapture?" Not at the expense of missing what you're supposed to be doing today. I was even going to I was even going to address this message and call it ho your potatoes. &gt;&gt; I see that went over like a lead balloon. Ho your potatoes. Live your life. What's a use of having a great expectation for the future if we're not really walking in the fullness and and all all the I I would say the inspiration of this moment. have quite a bit to say at that. Here's how Luke 24 starts out. Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came under the suppler, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. And they found the stone rolled away from the supplr, and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And I just give me your attention this way. &gt;&gt; They were never chastised for having prepared the spices. &gt;&gt; They were doing what they would normally do. &gt;&gt; They had heard him say that the son of man will suffer and be killed and be raised again on the third day. They heard that. But somehow it hadn't registered. It just hadn't registered with them. Now, this is a prophecy and I I would like to believe and I do believe and I I've taken this to a personal application. I expect that uh I may be I trust the Lord that I will be here for the rapture. But let me let me tell you about the very messenger. He studied and he prepared for a message called Trail of the Serpent. &gt;&gt; And he was going to anoint, don't think I'm reaching way out there. These women were going to anoint the physical body of Jesus Christ. The prophet messenger was going to anoint the spiritual body of Jesus Christ. He had a message that he was going to preach. He said in things that are to be modern events made clear. In fact, I'm sorry. He said in that message, I'm going to be preaching I'll be preaching uh the trail of the serpent. Uh if you get the tapes, get that tape on several times. He mentions, "I'm going to me I'm going to preach that." He was looking forward to it. He was anticipating doing that. And there are some that perhaps they feel it. He may come back and preach it. Uh by the time he resurrects, everybody's going to resurrect. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He's going to come in a resurrection. Of course, he's coming back. &gt;&gt; Everybody, there'll be a general there will be a resurrection &gt;&gt; of those that are asleep in Christ. &gt;&gt; But he anticipated as they anticipated. They anticipated anointing the body of Jesus Christ. He anticipated fact is don't don't be surprised. There will be perhaps hundreds if not thousands of messages that will be prepared and men will intend to there will be pray uh prayers prayed. There will be songs that people intend to sing and worship God &gt;&gt; and you won't even get to utter the word &gt;&gt; before you'll find yourself on the other side. &gt;&gt; That's going to happen. &gt;&gt; This is the prophecy. And here in this prophecy, they prepared spices that they never got to put on the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They were not they were not chastised for that. They were not they were not looked down for that. It was respected. They had It's It's written in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It's written in the scripture. It was part of it because it showed what was in their heart. They say, "Oh, God, it won't hurt my feelings if I don't get to preach a certain service or don't get to travel to a certain place. How how how all kinds of people prepare even in the natural they prepare for their going away and they want to do something. Maybe they want to do something for their family whatever more and never get to have it done. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean that the that the desire was wrong. We have a desire to do these things but we may not get to do it. And here are two that have believed the word. They they are I I could I would have to say that they were believers indeed. &gt;&gt; Those that had lived in the time or in the time of the fulfillment, they had a very unique opportunity. The most unique opportunity. They had an opportunity of seeing the prophecies fulfilled. They had an opportunity of believing that it was God's word and thus becoming a part of that word or those that disbelieved and rejected it. These are the these are the things that uh these are the directions that people are able to go now in this post-resurrection time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now upon the first day of the week and very early in the morning they came under the sephiler I tried to walk with them. I wasn't just reading it as something to read but I went I I went on the pathway with them. And friends, the reason why I am so urgent about this within my own heart is because this is what I've been saying to myself this week. It can't be too far down the road. If God has God, if God has sent the sign of the resurrection, &gt;&gt; if he has sent the sign of the Messiah, &gt;&gt; number two, if that was indeed the spirit of Elijah, number three, &gt;&gt; and I have to say yes to every single one of them because it was not within the power of a man to do it. &gt;&gt; Would you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Not within the power of a man to do that. &gt;&gt; Please go with me &gt;&gt; down my path this morning. If a man could not do it, who did it? &gt;&gt; The devil didn't do it. &gt;&gt; A magician can't do it. &gt;&gt; This is not a hit and miss. This is not some generalization. Somebody's here with a pain or a stomach ache or a backachche, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This was specific. &gt;&gt; This was calling people out. Why was that? Because they were he was giving a sign of the Messiah. The Messiah did this. &gt;&gt; Elohim did it to Abraham. &gt;&gt; This is very important. Some say might say, "Well, this is a first pull." Let me tell you, it is a powerful confirmation. Amen. &gt;&gt; This never happened before. &gt;&gt; So I'm asking this congregation and all who hear my voice, who did this? &gt;&gt; And once we determine who did it, you ask the second question, why did he do it? &gt;&gt; And if you come to the same conclusion that I come to, he did it because it was this season &gt;&gt; and that these are the people Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the people. &gt;&gt; You did not bring yourself on the scene. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, my mother, my father, God Almighty gave you life. &gt;&gt; God Almighty gave you breath. &gt;&gt; God Almighty brought this message your way. &gt;&gt; God Almighty opened your eyes so you saw something the next person didn't see." &gt;&gt; God Almighty did that. You could have been blinded to it, but God opened your eyes. And now we say, "Why did he do that?" Not to take you down a trail, not to take you down a path &gt;&gt; and you become disillusioned, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And say, "Why? What's happening? What's happening with this message? What's happening? You think you have a difficulty? What if you belong to their congregation? Cleopus's congregation. Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joanna and the other women that were with them and the 11 apostles. You think that they were holed up because they wanted to be there? They were holed up. Their treasure had just committed suicide. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If the treasure of this church had just committed suicide, be honest. There'd be a lot of you folks be very disillusioned. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Could you look beyond that? &gt;&gt; You would need to. &gt;&gt; Yes. You need to be able to stand up and declare that word is still true. &gt;&gt; I see all kinds of things happen in the message. And my wife, God bless her, she always says, "Well, it's those stable, steady, steadfast ones." That's what we're preaching for. That's what you're preaching for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm there because I'm here this morning because I believe there is a number of people. There is a group of people and there may be some here this morning that still have their vision a little bit dullled. Maybe they're a little late. Maybe they're a little delayed. Maybe they're a little bit distracted. I'm here to sharpen up your vision. &gt;&gt; And mine, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same one that walked with them is right here in this building today. And I want you to be aware that you'll be much more conscious than when you walked in that when you walk out there going to be one going. And he went with them. And he may ask, "What is this that you're troubled about?" He gets real close, real imate. What What is this you're communicating together between you? What is this that's so deep on your heart? Tell me. They began to tell him, "Oh, I hope if he asked you that." And I asked myself, I said, "Oh, God." The first words out of their mouth, "Haven't you heard about Jesus of Nazareth?" Right? &gt;&gt; Their first words &gt;&gt; wasn't, "Well, Lord, I I lost my job and and I've been having such a hard time and my bills are piled up. Uh the job that I have, my work, my peers, my work associates, and oh, I'm having so much difficulty in my home, my wife, my husband, my children." No, it wasn't that. It was, "Haven't you heard what happened? Jesus of Nazareth, &gt;&gt; right? one mighty in word indeed &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; He was a great prophet &gt;&gt; and they begin to relate everything about him. &gt;&gt; I can tell you he loved every minute of it. &gt;&gt; And then he opened his mouth. And I believe this is just my own personal belief. I believe the spirit that was speaking through the messenger on his second last service telling you and I what is a prophecy for your for your day? This is a prophecy for your day. So this one came near to them and walked with them and went with them all the way. And while he was going, he began to he began to speak. And brother Brandham says, let's listen to the words that he quoted. I personally believe that this is what he quoted. &gt;&gt; Amen. I personally believe that that spirit that was speaking out of this messenger's mouth was telling us because this is our prophecy &gt;&gt; was telling us specifically what he some some might say well it was just brother Brandham quoting some scripture I believe he was he might as well have been right beside them &gt;&gt; said let's hear them &gt;&gt; he said let's hear the words he quoted he said would you like to hear &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; what he said to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says he briefed them. Now they were briefed on all the late happenings. They knew about all the happenings and the story of the grave and the tomb and the women that had seen him and other ones said and they seen him and so forth and they'd been briefed on that. But then he began quoting the word and he said, "Now look, he must have quoted Zechariah 11:12." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For he was sold for 30 pieces of silver. &gt;&gt; Was not the Messiah supposed to be sold for 30 pieces of silver? In Psalms 41:9, he was betrayed by his friends. Zechariah 13:7, he was forsaken by his disciples. In Psalms 35 and 111 he was accused by false witnesses in by Isaiah 35 and7 dumb before his accusers and he never opened up his never opened his mouth in Isaiah 50 and6 he was scourged he talked about that in Psalms 22 he cried at the cross my God my God why hast thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me they pierced my hands and my feet. Isaiah 9:6, unto us a child is born, a virgin shall conceive. And in Psalms 22 and 18, they parted his garments among them. Isaiah 7, a virgin shall conceive. Psalms 22:7 and 8, he mocked him by, he was mocked by his enemy. He was supposed to be his friend, his enemies, the church. Psalms 22 again, not a bone of his will be broken, but they pierced his hands and his feet. Isaiah 53 and2 died by the male factors. Isaiah 53 and9 bruised and buried with the rich with the rich brethren. Brother Brandham said as they quoted that and he went on just a three more in Psalm 16 and 10. He was resurrected from the dead. &gt;&gt; It was not I will not suffer my holy one to see corruption. Neither will I leave his soul in hell. He was raised from the dead. Malachi 3, John the Baptist was his forerunner. and all of these types. He might have went on even to Isaac being the type of him upon the mount upon the mountain where his father Abraham took him in Genesis 22. And the Bible says and they came to their place and they said, "Come in." But when he spoke these scriptures, their eyes were open. They didn't understand everything &gt;&gt; but they understood now this was him. Friends, I feel very very moved. I'm not intending on trying to preach you some great outstanding service this morning. I came here to tell you these scriptures point to this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. these scriptures to those of you who God has opened up your understanding and has given you and said I am a believer &gt;&gt; then you could join with them they are a believer &gt;&gt; but now I'm standing here as a servant of Christ to tell you we cannot take casually we cannot relegate to some place back down in our life these scriptures these prophecies need to come and be preeminent &gt;&gt; in our lives I'm talking about all of our lives in our daily life. And I would be pleased if I knew in my heart and soul as a result of this service that God anchored this so true in in the hearts of the people that they say, "I I am I I I've become obsessed with the promises that were left to us. &gt;&gt; I've been obsessed. I can't shake it off my mind. I'm thinking of it all the time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham was asked, "Should evangelists continue on the field?" Where are we at right now? This is what I'm asking. Should evangelists continue on the field? He said, "In this hour, of course." What they mean? Certainly, by all means, don't change a thing. If Jesus is coming in the morning, preach today like it was going to be 10 years from today, &gt;&gt; but live like it's going to be in this at this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ho your potatoes. &gt;&gt; Live your life. &gt;&gt; Be the father. Be the mother. Be the young person God's called you to be. But let this be uppermost in your mind. I have been called by this voice. &gt;&gt; I've been called with the highest calling. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The highest calling. Would you tell somebody if the president of the United States or the queen of England or the prime minister of this nation called you this afternoon and said some friend of yours gave me your number and I I'm calling because uh I've got a special a special place for you. I'm we're having a special event and I want to invite you to this event. You'll keep that quiet. You'd be on the phone within moments. &gt;&gt; You said, "Guess what? You're not going to believe. I just got a call from the president." &gt;&gt; Some of you may not be impressed with that. But even if you thought you weren't being impressed with it, you get impressed. &gt;&gt; Because it does something to the individual. you you begin to feel you know me I got this kind of a call uh even if you didn't go even if you weren't able to fulfill it you you were honored &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that somebody thought of you &gt;&gt; I'm telling you someone &gt;&gt; Yes sir &gt;&gt; God himself &gt;&gt; not some nebulous person or creature &gt;&gt; but God. &gt;&gt; God with eyes. &gt;&gt; God with ears. &gt;&gt; God with a God with a mouth that speaks. God of Abraham. The God of Isaac. The God of Jacob. I'm talking about Elohim that came down and ate drank milk and ate meat with Abraham. And Abraham stood under an oak tree and watched him. I'm talking about that kind of God. I'm talking about a God that is so concerned about people that he would speak through a man's mouth and tell them about their little accident. You had a car accident. I'm talking about a God that knows when somebody uh was scared with a dog. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a God that knows the kind of complex you have &gt;&gt; and he knows how that complex came and he's interested in removing it from you. He's interested in coming so close to you today. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a God that has a little man sit in his chair by the hour by the hour waiting on God to come here and just tell you this. And I feel honored. I'm talking about somebody who thought about you &gt;&gt; before you were conceived, &gt;&gt; before this nation was established, &gt;&gt; before all the stars were in place. God thought about a certain individual. &gt;&gt; He thought about a certain character and he mixed and caused the seeds to mingle until a certain individual would come because he needs you exactly as you are. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He doesn't need what you imagine yourself to be. He needs you as you are. He wants you as you are. He will do the changing. He will do the molding. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There may be some here that will be the women. that will have made preparations. Maybe your preparations will be different. I I pray you don't consider this too simple and fundamental. Maybe you'll say, you know, we're going to have I I I just want to have I see someone's been a sister been way really discouraged, overweighted in the I just have the burden on my heart. So let dear how it be if we have them over to our place and just have them together and encourage them and give an evening and I'm going to prepare going to prepare a nice meal for them and we'll have them over certain evening and you prepare there going to be somebody there's going to be somebody trust me &gt;&gt; there's going to be a woman that what are you doing you're wanting to bless the body of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and you're standing right at your post of duty and you're doing your thing and and you won't need it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You won't need the spice. &gt;&gt; You won't need the anointing. You won't need that &gt;&gt; because you're going to find out he's not here. &gt;&gt; He's already risen. &gt;&gt; It's already happened. There's going to be a moment that there's going to be a flurry of people back and forth. They're going to be telling someone else. You think that's a You think that is some kind of mystic mythical thing? That's what happened in the Bible. &gt;&gt; I know a little bit about that presence. I I wish I could convey it to you. But one day, that same God that talked to you someplace along the line, you're going to become aware of a presence so intense. You'll feel as though, not that you're going to expire, but you feel as though you can't contain it. Don't tell me you've ever felt that because it's something like you've never felt. And it's going to be his presence from another dimension, from another realm. It's going to move. And I I I I wish I knew scientifically how it happens, but I don't know. All I can tell you is what a messenger said. And there'll be a sweep go over you. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a change in your atoms. You're going to find yourself immediately in another room. I can't. All I'm going to do is just tell you what the prophecy said. &gt;&gt; And the women came to the sele and the stone was rolled away and they looked in and but the body was not there. Listen, but the linen clothes were there. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; The body wasn't there, but the linen clothes were there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when they came out, Mary sees a gardener in today's language, a landscaper. And we have a few right here in this church. He sees a she sees a landscaper. And he happens to be dressed. &gt;&gt; Put that one in your mind and think about it. Where'd those clothes come from? &gt;&gt; And he's in another realm. &gt;&gt; But they saw them. God allowed them with these eyes to see him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Fully clothed &gt;&gt; and looking like a young man, looking like a gardener. Nothing extraordinary, but yet he had a way. He had a way with one. We'll have a way with you that will be different from someone else. And for her, all she needed to do was hear her name. Right. &gt;&gt; And in the vortex, in the climax of that moment, he's gone. The clothes are there. The storms rolled away. The men in shining garments like a vision. And and and they're just caught up in their moving out. And here's where have you taken him, Ed? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Would you like to hear your name? &gt;&gt; He knows exactly who you are. &gt;&gt; Mary Reon, &gt;&gt; master go and tell my disciples. Go and tell. That'll be the first thing on the agenda. Not go home and prepare breakfast. Not go home. Not go to the shopping center. Not Walmart. Not something else. Go home. Go and tell my disciples. &gt;&gt; What else mattered anymore? Nothing mattered anymore. I got an appointment. Forget the appointment. I got an education. Forget the education. This is number one on the agenda. &gt;&gt; We've had a resurrection and my brother, my sister, we're either wasting our time here in this church or we are we are having that as our objective. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the objective. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. You'll eat. You'll have a bed to sleep in cuz he promised it. &gt;&gt; You'll make it through. &gt;&gt; But this is first and foremost. &gt;&gt; Build everything, structure everything around this moment. I'm preparing for the resurrection. &gt;&gt; If it happens today, I'll be in it. If it happens tomorrow or a year or 10 years or whatever it is, we won't weary. I've only got a short life. You only got a short life. And it's just passing quickly past us in the midst. I'm closing now. in the message uh is the rising of the sun. Brother Brennan comes towards the end of that service and uh he says the quickening power. I believe we're probably got you know I started singing it. I'm not a singer but I just started singing the prophet's words. I just started singing them. And he said something like this. I wish I could sang it. Look what we've seen in this day. &gt;&gt; The quickening power has come to stay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've just adjusted it a wee bit. To open up the seven to open up the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was that? Jesus Christ reveals &gt;&gt; not intelligence of a man. quickening power fulfilled God's plan. The quickening power made the world testify. It's the truth. They can't deny. The angel of the Lord was around in the pillar of fire. God's voice did sound. The world didn't know. What could it be? And we who just look this way. &gt;&gt; It's our Lord up there. You see, &gt;&gt; the quickening power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not here just to have church. I'm here I I am rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The quickening power. &gt;&gt; And it was just after he spoke those words, my wife and I went to the baptismal tank. And there was only a few people. Sister Tammy Brown's Tammy Laroo, but she was a Brown then. Her mom and dad were there and my wife and I went to the tank. I had wanted to be baptized for quite a long time. Was kind of waiting on my wife. Sometimes we men have to have a little patience and wait on our wives. Sometimes wait, wives have to wait on our husbands, &gt;&gt; right? But it was so wonderful to go together and she went to her room and I went to my room and I was baptized and there I've been preaching for years but now I went in the water and this is just what happened. This is just my testimony and I'm closing came up out of the water. Brother I think brother Collins baptized us. There only half a dozen people there. Everyone had dispersed and I went to room. It was quite dark. I don't even remember any light. There was just little light I think from the door being opened in the change room. It was quite large. And I walked in and a presence just settled over me. It was like I'm pleased. And I walked to the corner and I hung my head down be in the corner soaking wet of course and that presence I was totally melted least. It was the least thing I expected. But I just begin to melt in his presence and a voice spoke to me and said, "Your wife is experiencing exactly the same thing right now." &gt;&gt; And I got out of the tank, Brother Chris. I mean, I got out of the room and my wife came and I said, "What did you experience? This is what happened to me." She said, ' That's exactly what happened to me. And I thought that was so nice. Just the Lord doing something special. And there we were on two two different rooms having exactly the same thing. Friends, Cloverdale Bible Way. If we should never meet this side again of the veil, this one I'm speaking about is present. I sense him even now. And he's wanted me to say these things to you. He's wanted me to reaffirm and emphasize to you that there's nothing important in your life, nothing as important as for you to see that what God uttered out of his vindicated prophet's mouth, &gt;&gt; was to direct you to those exact scriptures that are being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm also going to announce to you that they'll be fulfilled even whether whether you're aware of it or not aware of it. Nothing can stop the program of God. &gt;&gt; And I want you to pray, Lord, let me be fully conscious of what's happening. &gt;&gt; Let me be fully in tune. Let me be completely in harmony and walking right in the right in the uh time in time with the symphony. Is that your desire? &gt;&gt; I know it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll bow our heads. Father, we're not only bowing our heads, but we're bowing our hearts. And today Lord perhaps uh for me it's an unusual service. It's an unusual presence. And I am desirous. I'm so desiring Lord that this will be conveyed and that others I trust that all everyone can sense your divine nearness and you're wanting to vindicate to uh somebody you're wanting to come near to the path that they're walking in and tomorrow they're going to be conscious that something has happened something's different. Something's taking place in my life and it will be you your your nearness and you'll begin to draw begin to draw us Lord out from the atmosphere and the influence of this world and we have to be in it but we're not of it. There are those, Lord, who are workers and bus drivers and business people and they have all their duties. But I'm asking, oh God, and the mothers with their children, the singles, the young people, Father, you see, there is not one person outside of the scope of your vision. And I want I pray Lord that you will just superimpose upon their minds that that your words that you would not leave them at any moment. And if there was any time that Cleopus and his friend needed you, it was on this day when they were in the midst of this prophecy. Oh God, I pray that you'll make it just electrifying to us. I ask that you will take these words, Father, that have been spoken and things that are modern events made clear by the prophecy. May this prophecy become a reality. May lives be turned around. I pray, oh God, that there will be a a a change of the order of our of our importance, of our agenda, of our future, Lord, because it needs to be it needs to take place. It needs to happen, God. I pray that there be none of our natural fleshly desires that will override or distract us from these things that you have prepared for your children, your elect, your people. In the name of Jesus Christ, I ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. 8:42 is be it unto me according to thy word. Let's just stand as we [Music] just sing the first this first verse to me according to your word. According to your promises, I can stand secure. Heart upon my heart, the truth that sets me free according to your word, oh Lord. Be it to me. Be it to me [Music] to according to your proises. I can say to you upon my heart the truth that sets me free. Glory to God. I would like to encourage you to take a step. [Music] Take a definite step. This morning, I would encourage you to make this Sunday, a post-resurrection Sunday, a very special Lord's Day. [Music] Oh, there's so much I would like to say. [Music] I listened to I listened to the prophet speak to the people. I just thought his second last service, just one more leadership to speak. And he has to speak the truth. And he speaks it so [Music] so direct. [Music] It seems so cutting and essentially he was saying you're so slow, oh fools, and slow of heart. But these people that he spoke to didn't have the response that these two men had. &gt;&gt; Right? And these two men, he had just said these things and he exposed who he was and they didn't see it yet, but they came to their place. They came to their house. Oh, who knows what who knows what was on their agenda. Who knows what it was they had? Who knows what it was? A family, the children, whatever more. But they took a hold of him and they constrained him. They wouldn't let him go. And he made as though he was going to continue. He made as though he must continue. But they constrained him. &gt;&gt; Come in. &gt;&gt; And they displayed a character. And brother Brandham says that's the only thing you'll take with you from this realm to another realm is your character. I trust you have enough character this morning to recognize this word was uttered for my sake. &gt;&gt; And I have come down the road a long ways. I am now going to constrain him. Uh for those of you that may feel there's a a tug, a pull. There's something that's happening. He's trying to say something to you. Don't leave it for another day. &gt;&gt; Lay hold of him &gt;&gt; and constrain him. and pull him into your life. &gt;&gt; Pull him into every affair of your life. Do you understand what I mean? Pull him into your work life. Pull him into your family life. Pull them into your business life. Pull them into your education. Pull them in and say, "Jesus, be the Lord of all. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Be the Lord of all. Take control of absolutely everything. I'm here as your brother. I'm here as your friend. I'm here. If you consider me your pastor, I'm saying to you, you'll never never regret it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is our word. &gt;&gt; I have never found anyone that pull them in and said, "Lord, be the Lord of all. I'm taking definite steps. I'm going to constrain you." &gt;&gt; This business that the church is always on there and God's always on his knees begging for you to come. That's a deception, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's a falsehood. &gt;&gt; The scripture says that what the father has given me and no man can come to me except the father draw him. All I'm trying to do is encourage those of you because I know that the enemy, God's enemy, your enemy, my enemy. He would do everything this morning to make you leisurely, &gt;&gt; to make you sluggish about the word that you've just heard, to procrastinate and put it off to another time. I say in the name of the Lord, do not put it off. &gt;&gt; You men that have families and homes, you say, "My home shall be different from this day forward because I'm in the midst of a prophecy. &gt;&gt; I'm in the midst of the coming of the Lord. I'm in the midst of the resurrection prophecy that's been given to us for this hour. It's not for generations up ahead. It's for us now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I'm not just preaching. I thought about this very deep before I came here. &gt;&gt; So much so that if this is for people 200 years up the road, then this was not the forerunner. &gt;&gt; Then he wasn't the forerunner. &gt;&gt; If he wasn't the forerunner, he wasn't Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Say what you wish to say. &gt;&gt; That's the conclusion I came to &gt;&gt; so that I could come here with confidence and say this is the forerunner. &gt;&gt; This is Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the one introducing us to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This is him. &gt;&gt; He has come. &gt;&gt; He has laid the word out. &gt;&gt; This is the sign of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; This is the sign of the resurrection. Do you really believe that? &gt;&gt; Then I want you to say within your heart, "My home will be different. My life will be different." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't even know how to close. &gt;&gt; Oh God. [Music] &gt;&gt; If you feel like a &gt;&gt; some kind of a total surrender to him, do so. I'm going to sing. Help me out, Brother Ryan. Jesus be the Lord of all. Would you please everyone lift it up? Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. [Music] Jesus be the Lord of all the kingoms of my heart. [Music] Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all the kingoms of my heart. Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all. The king all my heart. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Is he speaking? &gt;&gt; Is there a tug at your heart? Why don't you just invite him in? I'm constraining you, Lord. I want to give you a place that perhaps you've not had. [Music] I want to give you a place in every area, every reign supreme in my life. Reign supreme. Change our home. I'm asking you to pray. Change our church. &gt;&gt; Change every area. Jesus be the Lord of all. [Music] I surrender and give myself to you. Lord, unreservedly as I know how. Oh God, lead us. Lead us. Wonder Brother Larry Cotle would you come and offer prayer please [Music] God bless you brother [Music] Most gracious father, [Music] we give you preeminence, Lord, in every area of our life. [Music] Lord, we thank you for shaking us and waking us this morning, making us realize the the urgency of the hour, Lord, that we live in. Help each of us, Lord, to give you that place, that intimacy that you desire, Lord Jesus, as you go with us and draw us along the way as we travel with you, Lord, moment by moment and step by step, Father. Lord, we're so hungry and thirsty for you, Lord. We so need you, Jesus, at this hour, oh God. Help us, Father, that we may yield to you, Lord. Lord, let us lay aside every weight and the things and the cares of life, Father, our plans and our purposes, Father, are not or nothing, Lord. It's your plan and your purposes, Lord. As you draw us by your Holy Spirit, Lord, to that place, Father, as we yield to you, Lord, we surrender our minds, our thoughts, our plans, our purposes, our desires, Lord, that your desire and your plans and your purposes may become those that are preeminent in us. Lord help us Lord Jesus as we are weak in the natural Lord but by your spirit you will draw us to you Lord each one Father you will not lose a one Lord if the Lord is dealing with us and dealing with your heart now yield to him yield to him yield to him now don't wait another moment yield your mind your thoughts thoughts, your desires. What you'll do this afternoon is not of importance. It's this moment with him. Invite him. I invite you, Lord. Come, Lord Jesus. I grab you now and I hold you to my bosom and I say, Lord, without you, we can do nothing. We are nothing and we will go no place without you, Lord. Father, we thank you for our precious pastor, Lord, for his labor for the sheep, oh God, that you would bless and strengthen him, Lord.
