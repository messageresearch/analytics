[25:31] Lord to your Holy Spirit in Jesus name
[25:35] Amen amen god bless you tonight can we
[25:39] turn to the book of Hebrews Thank You
[25:42] musicians and all that serve the Lord
[25:45] behind the scenes and labor so we can
[25:48] gather like this it's a blessing I just
[25:51] wrote a note in the back room and I was
[25:53] thinking this week there's not a lot of
[25:56] things in life that really bring peace
[25:58] and gratification and comfort to the
[26:03] believer like the present
[26:04] of the Lord just to be where he can
[26:07] touch us where his spirit can work and
[26:10] where his word is speaking there's
[26:12] nothing like it do we agree tonight I
[26:14] think that's why we're here and to hear
[26:16] this morning both of the specials and
[26:18] then tonight speaking about prayer and
[26:21] drawing close to the Lord that's good
[26:23] hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 2 3 if it's
[26:31] okay
[26:32] hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 2 3 these are
[26:35] their scriptures brother Branham used in
[26:37] a message
[26:38] Christ is identified the same in all
[26:41] generations 1964 Hebrews 1 verse 1 God
[26:46] who at sundry times and in divers
[26:50] manners or that means in many parts and
[26:54] many places spake in time past unto the
[26:57] father's by the prophets hath in these
[27:00] last days spoken unto us by his son whom
[27:04] he hath appointed heir of all things by
[27:07] whom also he made the world's who being
[27:11] the brightness of his glory and the
[27:14] Express image Amen of his person and
[27:19] upholding all things by the word of his
[27:23] power when he had by himself purged our
[27:28] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[27:31] Majesty on high praise the Lord and can
[27:36] we turn to chapter 13 Jesus Christ is
[27:43] the same in all generations and Hebrews
[27:47] chapter 13 Paul speaking in verse 5
[27:52] Hebrews 13 verse 5 let your conversation
[27:56] or your behavior be without covetousness
[27:59] and be content with such things as you
[28:02] have for he hath said I will never leave
[28:07] thee nor forsake thee praise the Lord
[28:12] then the Lord is with us tonight for he
[28:15] hath said I will never leave thee nor
[28:17] forsake
[28:18] so that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[28:22] helper and I will not fear what man
[28:25] shall do unto me remember them this is
[28:30] good counsel remember them which have
[28:32] the rule over you who have spoken unto
[28:35] you the Word of God whose faith follow
[28:38] considering the end of their
[28:40] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[28:44] yesterday and today and forever our last
[28:48] verses verse 9 be not carried away with
[28:52] divers are many strange doctrines for it
[28:56] is a good thing that the heart be
[28:58] established with grace not with meats
[29:01] which have not profited them that have
[29:04] been occupied therein thank you Lord for
[29:08] your word god bless you can have your
[29:10] seats tonight it's good to be able to
[29:13] worship the Lord with you tonight and
[29:16] amen be able to be together so much more
[29:20] as we see the Day approaching tonight
[29:23] we'd like to speak on recognizing this
[29:26] day and in my notes I I capitalized this
[29:30] thi s this day recognizing this day and
[29:34] what to do and what to do
[29:37] recognizing this day and what to do most
[29:40] of you are familiar with brother Branham
[29:43] preaching 1964 in July recognizing your
[29:47] day and it's message that would be a
[29:49] good message to hear this week
[29:51] recognizing your day and its message but
[29:55] for tonight I'd I'd like to speak on
[29:57] recognizing this day and what to do so
[30:01] as we look into the scripture and then
[30:04] into the message it's it's good for us
[30:06] not just to look back but to look to our
[30:08] day this season we're speaking about
[30:11] this day or this time that we're at even
[30:15] 2020 or 2022 earth this very day to
[30:20] recognize it as an individual to
[30:23] recognize this day and then what you're
[30:27] supposed to do and as we look at this
[30:30] tonight we'll just fellowship for a
[30:32] while on this recognizing means to know
[30:36] and to identify so you're recognizing
[30:40] your day the hour that we're living in
[30:43] and to distinguish it from a past day
[30:46] it's it's to know the difference between
[30:48] what God did in your life maybe years
[30:51] ago maybe months ago and to be able to
[30:54] say but this is today Lord and I need
[30:57] your leadership for today and it's going
[31:00] beyond just the Bible days it's going on
[31:04] just beyond what brother Branham lived
[31:06] his life that was his day and to know
[31:09] his part and we could preach whole
[31:11] sermons and have weekends on recognizing
[31:14] the message and I believe the bride has
[31:17] received our message can we all agree on
[31:20] that there is not another message
[31:22] there's not another age and there's not
[31:24] another prophet to come Christ has
[31:27] already came so the bride has recognized
[31:30] her day and its message but tonight I'm
[31:33] taking it further we're bringing it up
[31:35] to this year and to what you're going
[31:37] through now it's important for us to
[31:39] recognize or understand to where you
[31:43] actually see it it's not the preacher
[31:45] it's not the pastor or the teacher or
[31:49] the visiting evangelist now it's you as
[31:52] a person recognizing and experiencing
[31:56] God in your own life are we all together
[31:59] so let's not push it out there shove it
[32:02] out there it's recognizing our day and
[32:05] it includes both parts and what to do so
[32:09] what to do Lord and and what where are
[32:12] you going in your life and what does the
[32:15] Lord have for you that word and what to
[32:18] do it's the second part of the message
[32:19] it's to know what he wants done with his
[32:22] word in your life amen now we're
[32:26] focusing in tonight I know it's Sunday
[32:29] night and and busyness and things but
[32:32] now it's knowing what you should do
[32:34] knowing what the word would be for your
[32:36] life it's to have his mind for your
[32:40] individual situation so it's not just
[32:44] globally
[32:45] bringing it locally and then honing in
[32:47] down on you recognizing what is the mind
[32:50] of the Lord for your situation it's for
[32:54] you and I to walk in a oneness with God
[32:57] just listen real closely for you to walk
[33:00] in such a oneness with him to wear him
[33:03] and you become a one where it's not just
[33:07] a quote out of it is the rising of the
[33:10] Sun she is him but it's now Christ in
[33:13] you you recognizing that it's another
[33:17] life and that there's such a oneness now
[33:19] between you and him and you're walking
[33:21] together
[33:22] that's that invisible union that is
[33:25] between Christ and the bride that
[33:28] produces the perfect will of God so now
[33:31] we're bringing all these messages and
[33:33] all the accumulations of of even what
[33:36] the Lord has done in our pastor's life
[33:37] and what we heard this morning and what
[33:40] God did for him and made himself real in
[33:42] his life but this generation this is
[33:46] your season to recognize God in your own
[33:49] life now we're taking it further than
[33:52] just coming to church and recognizing
[33:53] that he's here or he's in the ministers
[33:56] on the platform but now it's looking in
[33:59] your own life as a housewife as a
[34:01] teenager as a father now it's you
[34:05] getting ahold of God yourself it's you
[34:08] wrestling it out with the angel yourself
[34:11] it's you having God in your own life and
[34:14] having confidence that there has been an
[34:17] invisible union don't you desire that
[34:20] tonight it it's not a feeling it's not
[34:22] just my friends it's it's more than just
[34:25] my family it's more than just the group
[34:28] now it's God and you it's you
[34:31] recognizing your part in God so tonight
[34:34] I know it's Sunday night but it's where
[34:36] our actions and our moves are him where
[34:41] we recognize he is working in your life
[34:44] he is walking in your life God is
[34:47] dealing in your life and he's leading a
[34:50] people that's what we need to recognize
[34:53] so we have received the message of the
[34:56] hour let's just make it clear tonight
[34:58] not speaking about recognizing our day
[35:01] and the message God seen in a prophet I
[35:04] believe most of us here would say amen
[35:06] to that but now what we're really
[35:08] looking to the question tonight is where
[35:11] do you stand in this great cycle of life
[35:14] where do you as an individual where the
[35:17] Holy Spirit has been faithful to spread
[35:20] this message around the world fulfilling
[35:23] the Great Commission but now we're
[35:25] bringing it down to where you and God
[35:27] are one two where our life reflects that
[35:31] where our character reflects that from a
[35:34] true heart I'm not being so concerned
[35:37] about what happens on Sunday or
[35:39] Wednesday night I believe you have good
[35:41] ministry but we're speaking about Monday
[35:44] and Tuesday after the Sunday we're
[35:47] speaking about Thursday and Friday and
[35:49] Saturday after the Wednesday what's
[35:52] going on in our private life what's
[35:55] happening in our families where are we
[35:57] really living at in our character that's
[35:59] where we're honing in down where God can
[36:02] get a people that's so in one with him
[36:04] where she is him hallelujah is that okay
[36:09] tonight now in the beginning of this
[36:11] message Christ is identified in all
[36:14] generations he was talking about the
[36:16] words and how we've got to know when we
[36:19] come to him we've got to come with an
[36:21] understanding that's the way Christ
[36:23] wants us to come he said you have to
[36:26] have faith and what you're doing if you
[36:29] don't you just gonna kind of be
[36:31] haphazard and people begin to pray well
[36:34] I hope so he said it'll never happen
[36:37] well well I hope I have the Holy Ghost I
[36:41] hope that everything's under the blood I
[36:44] hope that when I get there I'm accepted
[36:46] that he said it'll never happen it can
[36:49] happen you can't have faith if you're
[36:52] going like that you must thoroughly know
[36:54] what you're going and know that it's
[36:57] going to happen and you're positive then
[37:00] it's gonna happen so tonight we're
[37:03] moving on a person just trying to
[37:05] intellectually trying to reach out and
[37:07] grasp for this or
[37:09] grass for their healing or grass for
[37:11] their loved ones it's to where it's a
[37:14] revelation it's where God Himself gets
[37:17] inside of you and you're thinking his
[37:19] thoughts your acting his life it's no
[37:22] longer you and him or Twain but now it's
[37:25] one that is the faith that the message
[37:29] has brought to us and now the Bible said
[37:31] he's the same yesterday today and
[37:33] forever brother Branham says and we want
[37:35] to know how he could be and how we would
[37:38] recognize him if he's here just as he
[37:42] was in any other time then we'd like to
[37:45] know how he is recognized among us he
[37:49] said we've got to have something that we
[37:51] can come to to some conclusion or we
[37:55] won't know where we're going I think he
[37:58] said that's the thing that would settle
[38:00] that would be the Word of God and
[38:03] regardless of our Creed's or our
[38:05] thoughts the Word of God ought to settle
[38:08] it amen the Word of God ought to just
[38:13] settle it for us amen
[38:16] so when we look at this our life now it
[38:19] reflects our seat when we hear the word
[38:22] and we go out to live our lives our walk
[38:25] reflects our seed now we're living in a
[38:28] very time of great trouble whether Derek
[38:31] sang the song that we there's
[38:33] nervousness in the land there's fear in
[38:35] the land its global where people are
[38:37] turning to this and turning to that and
[38:40] we just turn to Christ you know back in
[38:43] Israel I'm just quoting brother Branham
[38:45] preached in Phoenix in 63 about how
[38:48] Israel needed a way out of Egypt and
[38:50] they wanted some way some military
[38:53] strength or something to deliver them
[38:55] out of the hands of the Egyptians and
[38:57] God provided a prophet with the
[38:59] vindicated original word Moses so they
[39:04] were thinking one thing they were
[39:05] thinking one way and God sent him a
[39:07] prophet he said they wanted an army to
[39:11] raise up and take them out and beat the
[39:13] Egyptians down but God sent them the
[39:16] word the Prophet what The Vindicator
[39:19] word that God had spoke to Abraham thy
[39:22] seed so sojourn in a strange land
[39:25] but I'll visit them with a mighty hand
[39:28] let's not look back tonight God has
[39:31] visited us in our day he's brought us
[39:33] out with a mighty hand but we're not in
[39:36] Egypt and were not wandering in the
[39:38] wilderness we've got to be a people
[39:40] that's possessing our land we came out
[39:44] for a purpose that's to go into so it's
[39:48] not recognizing our day and what we need
[39:51] to do he's continuing on to say they
[39:54] were crying for a deliverer and God sent
[39:57] them a prophet with the word God had a
[40:00] provided way to tell the difference
[40:02] between the believer and the unbeliever
[40:05] today it's the same that's why I made
[40:09] that statement our walk reflects our
[40:12] seed God has provided a message to tell
[40:16] the difference between the believer and
[40:18] the unbeliever do you remember back in
[40:20] Egypt's day how God was singing plagues
[40:24] I'm going to remember that God was
[40:26] sending plagues out there and brother
[40:28] Branham said some of them said well if
[40:30] the plague Falls we'll just go to the
[40:33] hospital if the plague happens to fall
[40:35] you know what we'll do we'll go get dr.
[40:38] Jones and he'll know how to take care of
[40:40] it
[40:41] but the Branham said it didn't work yet
[40:44] they were very smart and they said well
[40:46] if the plague falls we'll just go down
[40:49] beneath the ground in a cave and shut
[40:52] the door down brother bottom said that
[40:55] won't do it one bit of good they said
[40:57] will stay in the house and put a mask
[40:59] over our face and put some disinfect on
[41:02] it he said it didn't do a bit of good
[41:05] God made a provided way and it was the
[41:09] blood tonight the bride has the blood
[41:15] here's a prophet coming right down in
[41:19] 1963 it was like he could have said that
[41:21] tonight we need that blood we have that
[41:26] blood we've got to recognize our day and
[41:29] now what to do
[41:30] and we're not under fear tonight the
[41:33] bride isn't operate by phobia
[41:35] we operate by what the word has said so
[41:39] sometimes we need services just to blow
[41:42] out all the flus because what the world
[41:44] is telling us and what's going on out
[41:46] there it's a whole nother realm in the
[41:48] presence of God this is where faith is
[41:51] this is where anything can happen
[41:55] and last Sunday we spoke on Ananias and
[41:58] Sapphira and about how the young men had
[42:00] to carry out a a brother and a sister we
[42:03] would have called them in the message in
[42:05] the church they physically took them out
[42:07] and buried them but today it's not so
[42:10] much natural death we're seeing it's
[42:13] spiritual death let's get our minds
[42:16] right away on spiritual things it's
[42:18] spiritual death where men and women can
[42:21] hear the word be under the atmosphere
[42:24] the Holy Ghost and walk in and walk L
[42:26] walk in and walk out and yet death has
[42:30] already gripped over their soul I'm
[42:32] thankful for a message and for a blood
[42:35] and for a repentance are we thankful for
[42:39] a token that is the blood that is our
[42:42] provided way God provided it I'm just
[42:44] continuing on as simple as it seemed to
[42:47] take the blood of a lamb and sprinkle
[42:49] the door yet God said that was his way
[42:52] and he honored it all out from under the
[42:56] blood died the firstborn in desperation
[43:01] when brother Branham talked about the
[43:02] father looking out the window and just
[43:05] perspiring and and we would say maybe
[43:07] nervous and what are you all burdened
[43:09] about and maybe the children asking why
[43:12] it wasn't because he was just humanly
[43:14] nervous he wasn't being controlled by
[43:17] fear but he just wanted to make sure
[43:19] everything was right and tonight that's
[43:22] where the bride's focus are to be on a
[43:24] Sunday night Lord we're just making
[43:26] everything ready because we're about to
[43:28] leave this world but let's take all of
[43:32] these things down personal it's
[43:35] important that we recognize or know or
[43:38] understand this day our time personally
[43:43] and what to do personally within our
[43:47] lives now in recognizing your day in its
[43:50] message this was a morning service in
[43:53] 1964 brother Branham is speaking and the
[43:57] Sunday before he had spoken on the Feast
[43:59] of the trumpets just settle into the
[44:01] word tonight as brother Marco said we're
[44:03] here to feast off the word just the
[44:06] Sunday before he had spoke on the Feast
[44:09] of the trumpets and he said I want to
[44:11] call your attention about this and the
[44:13] time of Israel as God's timepiece and I
[44:17] want you to realize and recognize the
[44:19] time that we're living we were just
[44:22] about to run out as you see and then by
[44:26] this you should know the very hour and
[44:29] time and sign and message that you are
[44:32] to receive then he starts talking about
[44:34] last Sunday feast of the trumpets and
[44:37] how we'd been speaking of the last
[44:39] trumpets of the Bible and me and myself
[44:41] I thought they would break forth just
[44:44] like the seven seals do you remember he
[44:46] was actually went down with Billy to try
[44:48] to get the part v junior high so they
[44:50] could go day after day after day but
[44:53] then he said he went into his room and
[44:55] the Holy Spirit revealed to him that he
[44:58] had already preached the trumpets under
[45:00] the seals so he wasn't going to have
[45:03] seven days in a row like the seven seven
[45:06] seals and he talks about the seven
[45:08] church ages and how they were so
[45:10] perfectly the Holy Spirit he said came
[45:14] down among us and vindicated it put it
[45:16] on the papers throwed it out across the
[45:19] nation throwed it in the moon and the
[45:21] heavens and proved it to us weeks and
[45:23] months before it happened and just the
[45:26] way it would be perfectly and here in
[45:28] the tabernacle he made it knowing do you
[45:30] remember he came down in the Branham
[45:33] tabernacle and and the Lord wrote on the
[45:35] back wall well exactly what brother
[45:37] Branham had on the chart on the platform
[45:40] that the hand came out and wrote it out
[45:42] on the back wall literally before
[45:45] hundreds of witnesses he said how in the
[45:52] tabernacle he made it known in the time
[45:54] and he made it known in the moon
[45:56] and son he made it known in the position
[45:59] of the nation's he made it known in the
[46:01] hierarchy of Rome left and went back to
[46:04] Palestine supposedly had been the first
[46:06] pope since they claim he goes on to talk
[46:09] about this then we see before the seven
[46:11] seals hid all the mysteries watch
[46:14] brother branham me not knowing what I
[46:16] was drawing on the board for the church
[46:19] ages I never God knows just by vision I
[46:23] drawed it not knowing that God a year
[46:26] and six months later was going to
[46:28] vindicate it in the skies by the moon
[46:30] and slip it across the national papers I
[46:33] didn't know that here's a prophet being
[46:36] honest but now the Lord Jesus was saying
[46:40] this is the time I'm gonna reveal it
[46:43] it was just step after step step after
[46:46] step and he admitted me not knowing and
[46:48] in he goes on to say I didn't know that
[46:50] I didn't know that there will be a
[46:52] mysterious blackout on the moon to
[46:55] represent this Laodicea age and he says
[46:58] he goes on to talk about if you would
[46:59] notice the spiritual application God
[47:03] said it in the heavens and there I said
[47:05] said it here on earth I left just a
[47:08] little bitty space as you see just a
[47:11] little tiny bit of light now if you have
[47:13] your church age book or want to look at
[47:14] it brother Branham made the last age
[47:17] with just a little sliver of light there
[47:19] how many remember that but he said that
[47:21] was just before the very elected was to
[47:24] be called from the earth is the reason I
[47:27] placed it there for the seventh age that
[47:30] this is what he says but when God put it
[47:32] in the heavens it was totally blacked
[47:35] out I'm gonna repeat that when God put
[47:39] it in the heavens it was totally blacked
[47:41] out it means maybe the last one is
[47:44] called from that laid will see an age we
[47:47] don't know so brother Branham put a
[47:50] little sliver of Gration there but when
[47:54] God put it in the heavens it was totally
[47:56] blacked out friends everything outside
[47:59] of this message is just blacked out
[48:01] tonight we unequivocally we should be
[48:05] able to say we have recognized our day
[48:07] and it's message but now God's honing it
[48:10] down closer for our young people for the
[48:13] middle age for the older we must
[48:15] recognize our day our individual day and
[48:20] our season and what to do and how to do
[48:23] it
[48:24] now as we speak about this tonight just
[48:26] to maybe bring it into focus tonight
[48:29] when we speak about our day I'm not
[48:31] going to speak about 1906 or 1907 though
[48:41] we could or 1956 when America rejected
[48:45] the word we're not going to speak about
[48:47] 1963 and 1965 and just just point on
[48:51] that tonight we've recognized God sent a
[48:55] message I'm not going to speak about
[48:57] 1970 or 1977 which was huge in the
[49:02] message people that had heard the word
[49:05] 1977 was huge because they thought the
[49:08] Lord was going to come and so many that
[49:11] had sold their houses or went out and
[49:12] bought things and they even married
[49:14] people thinking all the Lord's going to
[49:16] come and when 1978 rolled around they
[49:19] realized we got to go on are we all
[49:22] together they didn't recognize so but
[49:25] tonight I'm not focusing in on that or
[49:27] 1980 what was happening in the message
[49:30] or 1990 or 2000 and y2k who here
[49:35] remembers where you were in 2000 you
[49:37] that are 2030 older absolutely huh I
[49:40] remember where I was and you know people
[49:42] thinking of everything's going to end
[49:44] and it's all going to be over and planes
[49:46] are gonna crash and computers are gonna
[49:47] crash and 2000 y2k I'm not going to
[49:51] speak about 2005 2009 what happened even
[49:56] locally or 2010 that was another day I'm
[50:01] not going to speak about 2015 or even
[50:04] 2019 we must recognize in 2020 this is
[50:08] our day this is our season and it's very
[50:12] important that we catch what God is
[50:14] doing now what is the
[50:16] of God for now how should we handle
[50:18] ourselves now and what we're gonna look
[50:22] at a little later is brother bottom
[50:24] talked about people living in the glare
[50:26] of another age they can so describe and
[50:30] so bring to the people another time a
[50:32] past age another season and even make it
[50:35] so real but we're in this season we've
[50:39] got to leave this encounter tonight and
[50:41] say lord help me to know what you want
[50:43] done in my life to recognize our season
[50:49] and our day and what does the Lord want
[50:53] to do in your life you say what you
[50:56] should do that's the last part of our
[50:58] service title some would answer well
[51:02] what should you do and we could take
[51:04] whole services on that you say just
[51:06] surrender you know you just need to
[51:08] recognize your day and just surrender or
[51:10] just yield just yield to the Lord or
[51:14] some would say we'll just feed off of
[51:15] the word that's what you need to do
[51:17] brother just stay in a godly atmosphere
[51:20] and all these things are true we've got
[51:24] to find our place and our season and
[51:26] what to do you say we'll be under a good
[51:29] ministry well that's why we're here
[51:32] read your Bible pray every day eat the
[51:36] book eat the messages say that's what we
[51:39] need to do be filled with the holy
[51:41] spirit but I'm taking it beyond that
[51:43] tonight it is what does god one in this
[51:46] harmony with you and him what does he
[51:49] want to do now all of these things are
[51:53] important in as believers that we should
[51:56] do them every day but it's focusing on
[51:59] here's the head we are the body and
[52:03] walking together with him let's turn to
[52:07] Psalm 71 some 71 don't have a lot of
[52:18] scriptures tonight in fact this is our
[52:20] last one that we like to turn to have us
[52:23] turn to so when I read it this week I
[52:27] thought it would be good to share this
[52:29] as we
[52:31] recognize this day and what to do say
[52:35] what should I do in the situation we'll
[52:38] go to the Lord and ask him you say well
[52:41] I think that's what the ministry is
[52:42] supposed to do they're supposed to tell
[52:44] me now that's not what we're called to
[52:45] do we're here to preach the word we're
[52:48] here to feed off the word and go into
[52:50] the land and bring back fruits and as
[52:53] the believers feed off for that and the
[52:55] believer if we believe the message and
[52:57] the word even that we heard this morning
[52:59] there's a body that's operating so you
[53:01] feed off for the word you feed off of
[53:03] Christ then you go do what God is
[53:06] leading you to do and if it is the Holy
[53:09] Spirit it won't be contrary to the word
[53:11] that's what's very serious Psalms
[53:15] chapter 71 are we doing okay tonight in
[53:18] VO Lord do I put my trust let me never
[53:24] be put to confusion now if you were in
[53:28] your private devotion you might just
[53:29] stop there and say yes Lord I put my
[53:32] trust in you take this confusion out of
[53:35] my heart I don't mind my whole situation
[53:39] I commit to you deliver me and my
[53:42] righteousness and cause me to escape
[53:45] incline thine ear unto me and save me be
[53:49] thou my strong habitation we run - I'm a
[53:52] continually resort thou has given
[53:56] commandment to save me for thou art my
[53:59] rock and my fortress deliver me O my god
[54:03] out of the hand of the wicked out of the
[54:05] hand of the unrighteous and cruel man
[54:08] verse 5 for thou art my hope Oh Lord God
[54:13] thou art my trust from my youth it was
[54:18] like David was giving this testimony
[54:20] thou art my trust from my youth by thee
[54:25] have I been holding up from the womb
[54:28] thou are he that took me out of my
[54:31] mother's bowels
[54:33] my prey shall be continually of thee
[54:37] what wonderful scriptures praise His
[54:40] name I am as a wonder among unto many
[54:43] thou art my strong refuge let my mouth
[54:47] be filled with thy praise and with thy
[54:49] honor all the day cast me not off in the
[54:53] time of old age forsake me not when my
[54:58] strength faileth is that what the Bible
[55:01] says I want to bring your attention to
[55:03] verse 5 how David was speaking about the
[55:06] hope of the Lord and his trust from my
[55:09] youth and then verse 9 says cast me not
[55:12] off in the time of old age forsake me
[55:16] not when my strength faileth the Word of
[55:21] God has something for all of us from our
[55:25] youth middle-aged or old age God is with
[55:29] us and I just thought it was so
[55:32] wonderful how David could identify with
[55:34] his youth but he also was coming in
[55:38] verse 9 and didn't want to be cast off
[55:41] in the time of old age or feel worthless
[55:44] or it's like I have nothing to do and I
[55:47] need to fulfill something I need to be
[55:50] active David was recognizing Lord don't
[55:54] cast me off in the time of old age and
[55:56] forsake me not when my strength faileth
[56:00] because there will come a time when our
[56:02] strength begins to fail and David had a
[56:05] desire and I think it's good for us
[56:07] tonight whether you're young or whether
[56:09] you're old to know that our strength
[56:12] cometh from the Lord but it's important
[56:15] to recognize our day whether we're a
[56:19] youth middle-aged or older to recognize
[56:24] our day and what to do let's just skip
[56:28] down to save some time in verse 16
[56:33] Psalm 71 verse 16 I will go in the
[56:36] strength of the Lord God I will make
[56:38] mention of thy righteousness even of
[56:41] Vine only Oh God thou hast been thou has
[56:46] taught me from my youth and here - have
[56:51] I declared thy wondrous works now also
[56:56] when
[56:57] I am old and grey-headed oh God forsake
[57:01] me not until I have showed thy strength
[57:05] unto this generation and thy power to
[57:10] everyone that is to come
[57:13] here's David knowing that from a youth
[57:16] from a little shepherd boy God was with
[57:19] him and he was saying in verse 17 God
[57:23] thou has taught me from my youth and
[57:25] verse 18 now also when I am old and
[57:29] grey-headed O God forsake me not that is
[57:33] the same thought Lord don't cast me
[57:35] aside don't forsake me you are my
[57:38] inspiration you are my comfort you are
[57:42] my health you know when people are young
[57:45] they can almost out I'm gonna say this
[57:47] lightly but seriously it's almost like
[57:50] they don't need God they got their
[57:52] health they got their strength they can
[57:53] make decisions they can go places but as
[57:56] they begin to walk through life and
[57:58] mature they find out very quickly people
[58:01] need to lure it and that's general but
[58:05] it's got to come down I need the Lord we
[58:09] need the Lord our family our marriage
[58:13] our church now you're honing in you're
[58:16] recognizing this day you know we're
[58:21] reading out of Psalm 71 but it's 20/20
[58:24] he's still our God and I was when I was
[58:27] reading this I thought for all of us and
[58:29] verse 17 God has taught us from our
[58:32] youth hasn't he been so wonderful even
[58:35] this morning as brother Bisco just said
[58:38] kindly and it's nice to see a sister
[58:41] Debra I was thinking of you this morning
[58:43] brother Bisco was mentioning brother
[58:46] brother branham and how he spoke so
[58:48] kindly of the natives and and of that
[58:51] that group of people
[58:53] it speaks of leadership and how those
[58:56] under our message ought to have the same
[58:59] kindness toward every culture we're not
[59:04] prejudice we're not against people for
[59:06] this and just because of this
[59:08] this message has come for a global
[59:10] revival in fact I wrote in my notes lord
[59:19] help us to be more kind you say that's
[59:21] not deep in this generation that's very
[59:24] deep the world is so cruel and against
[59:27] an opposite the Lord is our kindness
[59:31] David was saying from a youth you have
[59:34] taught me to be this certain way but
[59:37] then he said in verse 18 I hope this is
[59:40] OK now also when I am old and
[59:44] grey-headed Oh God forsake me not he
[59:47] recognized his day and where he was
[59:52] living and where he needed to go he
[59:55] wasn't manic making an excuse for his
[59:58] age he was standing and saying we had
[1:00:01] the Lord and we have the Lord when I am
[1:00:06] old and grey-headed O God forsake me not
[1:00:08] until I have showed thy strength unto
[1:00:11] this generation I believe it's in every
[1:00:15] son or daughter of God to just keep
[1:00:18] pushing keep serving God you want to do
[1:00:23] as much as you can for God that's why
[1:00:26] it's very difficult to ask a soldier to
[1:00:29] lay down his sword
[1:00:30] it's like we'd rather die with the sword
[1:00:32] in our hand than give it up but it's
[1:00:35] important to recognize our day and what
[1:00:38] we need to do now brother Branham
[1:00:40] preached several other messages and I'm
[1:00:42] just going to move along because of
[1:00:44] Sunday night and people's tiredness but
[1:00:47] he also spoke hearing recognizing and
[1:00:50] acting on the Word of God it's another
[1:00:53] good message and in this message this is
[1:00:55] important for tonight
[1:00:56] he's speaking out of Romans nine eleven
[1:00:59] where the children not being yet born
[1:01:02] neither have done any good or evil that
[1:01:04] the purpose of God according to election
[1:01:07] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:01:10] calleth now how many believe the word of
[1:01:12] God I'm gonna speak about Jacob and Esau
[1:01:15] but I'm gonna bring it quickly into the
[1:01:17] token I'm gonna bring it quickly into
[1:01:19] how we ought to be believing today
[1:01:22] recognizing this day and what we need to
[1:01:25] do but the brennaman hearing recognizing
[1:01:28] and acting is quoting Romans nine eleven
[1:01:31] and twelve it was said unto her the
[1:01:34] elder shall serve the younger
[1:01:35] as it is written Jacob have I loved Esau
[1:01:38] have I hated
[1:01:39] and and brother branham goes on to give
[1:01:41] his title hearing recognizing and acting
[1:01:45] on the Word of God
[1:01:46] now he's just opening the service he
[1:01:48] said we see in these two sons Jacob and
[1:01:51] Esau that when they before they were
[1:01:55] even born they were at war with one
[1:01:57] another even though their virgin mother
[1:02:00] how many remember Rebekah married Isaac
[1:02:03] let me remember that then you have then
[1:02:06] you have Jacob and Esau even though
[1:02:09] their virgin mother and brother Bram
[1:02:11] said she was a virgin the beautiful
[1:02:13] Rebekah that married the righteous seed
[1:02:15] of God's promise Isaac they were two
[1:02:19] consecrated spirit filled believers on
[1:02:22] God for ordained to the very marriage
[1:02:26] that they United together by God
[1:02:30] foreknew it and how could such a thing
[1:02:32] come through that one mother and one
[1:02:36] father one a very evil person and
[1:02:40] another a very good person how that the
[1:02:44] good person looked to be the evil and
[1:02:47] the evil looked to be the good
[1:02:49] he said that always has been and always
[1:02:52] will be God's program God cannot change
[1:02:54] his program because he makes his program
[1:02:57] perfect it's a part of him and we
[1:03:00] believe that tonight how out of a
[1:03:02] righteous father and mother could you
[1:03:04] have an evil person and a righteous
[1:03:07] person he goes on to say these two sons
[1:03:10] it is strange to know that when they
[1:03:12] were born of the same seed from Isaac
[1:03:15] which was the promise and the first son
[1:03:17] Esau that was born we found out that not
[1:03:20] only were they fussing and fighting in
[1:03:22] the womb of their mother but they came
[1:03:24] out fighting Esau coming forth and Jacob
[1:03:28] grabbing ahold of his heel and they are
[1:03:30] still fighting he says
[1:03:33] how that it could come from that perfect
[1:03:35] pure elected holy consecrated father and
[1:03:40] mother he said because God calls by
[1:03:44] election it must be no matter how good
[1:03:48] your father or your mother was or how
[1:03:51] nice they was how much Christians your
[1:03:54] father and mother was it still lays in
[1:03:56] you as an individual you're standing
[1:04:00] before God this isn't very important
[1:04:05] that this be spoken tonight it's going
[1:04:07] to help parents but it should help every
[1:04:09] individual it's God that elects who was
[1:04:13] gonna be his bride he said this lesson
[1:04:18] teaches that both the children they were
[1:04:20] even by the elected called of God father
[1:04:23] and mother virgin woman and holy man who
[1:04:25] finally was to bring forth his seed
[1:04:27] through Jesus Christ he was tested and
[1:04:30] his father before him and he was
[1:04:32] promised through the seed of Isaac that
[1:04:34] the whole world would be saved how many
[1:04:36] remember when they went down to that
[1:04:37] Philistine a king there and and God was
[1:04:41] so adamant about the seed being saved
[1:04:44] that I'm gonna remember that and God
[1:04:47] spoke to that king and said don't touch
[1:04:49] her God was preserving the seed you
[1:04:55] remember brother BAM said God plagued
[1:04:57] that man's house and said you're as good
[1:04:59] as it as one dead holding that blood
[1:05:01] stream pure and rebekah
[1:05:03] righteous holy God sent God called
[1:05:06] mother and from that holy seed come
[1:05:08] forth a renegade a renegade and a
[1:05:11] believer so it lays within God's
[1:05:14] callings and God's election before
[1:05:17] either was born God said I love Jacob
[1:05:20] and Haiti saw before they was born so he
[1:05:24] said how we are how aren't we to feel
[1:05:28] someone has God who has God speaks to
[1:05:32] you and invite you to come to his table
[1:05:34] and comes to his home to be his son or
[1:05:37] daughter there's nothing so great as
[1:05:39] that I say amen to that if God calls you
[1:05:44] to be his son or his daughter I
[1:05:46] aren't right ahold of that he goes on to
[1:05:50] say the nature these two boys if we'd
[1:05:53] watch their nature one of them was a
[1:05:55] spiritual man and that was Jacob and the
[1:05:58] carnal man was Esau and yet they were
[1:06:00] both religious and that same thing he
[1:06:03] said has taken place all down through
[1:06:04] the Age the carnal and the spiritual
[1:06:07] Esau represented the man of the earth
[1:06:10] natural religiously inclined but never
[1:06:13] Abel it wasn't in him to do it he
[1:06:16] couldn't do it he never was in him to be
[1:06:21] able to climb past the things of the
[1:06:23] world the carnal things but Jacob it was
[1:06:26] just so easy for him to do it one
[1:06:29] purpose that Jacob had and that was he
[1:06:32] longed for that birthright no matter how
[1:06:34] he got it he just had to get it and
[1:06:37] that's evidence of a seed of God they
[1:06:41] loved the birthright now he continues on
[1:06:45] and I know this is a little bit
[1:06:47] laborious I could have put it on the
[1:06:49] screen but just follow along that spirit
[1:06:51] of that one birth is still represented
[1:06:53] he said in the world today and it's
[1:06:55] coming to a head now the spiritual
[1:06:57] believer and the carnal believer no man
[1:07:00] could say they wasn't both religious
[1:07:02] they were and they didn't say that
[1:07:04] one served in Idol and the other served
[1:07:06] God they were both servants of God and
[1:07:09] he goes on to say plate pay close
[1:07:11] attention to the scriptures on this
[1:07:13] subject and I'm sure it'll help you not
[1:07:16] in every one that says Lord Lord will
[1:07:19] enter in but the one that doeth the will
[1:07:21] of my father which is in heaven and
[1:07:24] that's you there's something in you that
[1:07:27] just craves the will of God I'm just
[1:07:34] skipping down here he said Jacob means
[1:07:36] sir planter or deceiver that was his
[1:07:38] first name that meant a supplanter
[1:07:40] deceiver but after finding and coming
[1:07:43] into the possession of the birthright he
[1:07:45] was changed
[1:07:46] that's the carnal changed he was then
[1:07:50] called Jacob a prince with God who's
[1:07:52] wrestled with him now the carnal
[1:07:55] believer today Oh as long as I go to
[1:07:58] church
[1:07:59] and do what's right what difference does
[1:08:01] it make that's Esau's group he makes fun
[1:08:04] and he despises the birthright
[1:08:06] he doesn't care for it but Jacob loved
[1:08:09] it you know we can have that in 2020
[1:08:13] even in our church people despise that
[1:08:16] they don't want a move of God and a
[1:08:19] spirit comes on them they become hostile
[1:08:22] against the message they become hostile
[1:08:25] against you be careful friends that's
[1:08:28] not the Holy Spirit the Spirit of God is
[1:08:31] always moving a believer toward
[1:08:33] repentance toward the Holy Ghost thank
[1:08:37] God for that tonight he said it's the
[1:08:39] only thing that matters to them is just
[1:08:41] get that birthright that's what they're
[1:08:44] interested in he said now don't blame
[1:08:47] the people they can't help it they were
[1:08:49] predestinated to that they were elected
[1:08:52] to that god help us tonight to be led by
[1:08:55] the Holy Ghost I just took a big leap
[1:08:58] but I pray for all of you that is seed
[1:09:02] of God there's already something in you
[1:09:04] that is stimulated by the Word of God
[1:09:06] and people that are just stimulated by
[1:09:09] worldly things and carnal things and
[1:09:11] that's the way they lean friends if I
[1:09:14] was you I would lean closer to Christ
[1:09:21] let's just take a little turn for just a
[1:09:24] moment it's this kind of sobering maybe
[1:09:26] serious thought an individual could
[1:09:29] actually recognize the moving of the
[1:09:32] Holy Spirit in a past season they could
[1:09:35] actually recognize the word for another
[1:09:38] season maybe describe it maybe put it
[1:09:41] out so clearly can't you see how the
[1:09:44] Holy Spirit moved there or what do you
[1:09:46] did for that person but then miss what
[1:09:49] God is doing now and that will not
[1:09:52] produce life today that's why it's so
[1:09:55] important to hear what the Spirit would
[1:09:57] say now in 2020 I'm not focusing on back
[1:10:03] when you gave your heart to the Lord or
[1:10:05] you repent and now it's been 10 years 20
[1:10:08] years it's what is God doing now you
[1:10:10] could have been face
[1:10:11] for then and God bless you but we're
[1:10:14] looking to tonight recognizing this day
[1:10:19] being sensitive now knowing what God
[1:10:23] wants with his word now so important
[1:10:28] today friends when we speak about I'm
[1:10:31] just using brother branham's language
[1:10:33] the glare of another age another time or
[1:10:37] a past era that was a light that shone
[1:10:42] for that day and let me just stop right
[1:10:47] here and make something very clear
[1:10:49] there's not going to be another message
[1:10:51] for the bride than what we've already
[1:10:53] received
[1:10:54] there's no preacher you need to follow
[1:10:56] there's no internet Church somewhere you
[1:10:59] need to tap into and hear their weekly
[1:11:01] services there's no newsletters or email
[1:11:05] list there's no cell phone you need to
[1:11:07] have in your cell phone and that's your
[1:11:09] connection with God you must have God
[1:11:12] yourself and wrestle it out and say I
[1:11:15] have met Jesus Christ
[1:11:17] I go to church two feet off the word I
[1:11:20] love the family of God we pray for
[1:11:22] healing we pray for deliverance but it's
[1:11:25] God's will to be done so let us not be
[1:11:32] guilty of recognize what happened God
[1:11:35] did in the past and then be falling all
[1:11:39] over and stumbling over what he wants to
[1:11:42] do now it's called a glare of another
[1:11:47] age let me just read to you out of Los
[1:11:48] Angeles looking to the unseen when
[1:11:51] brother Branham was talking about do you
[1:11:53] remember those geese that had went off
[1:11:55] and flew off to England he said these
[1:11:59] geese they kept going back and forth and
[1:12:02] and one kept calling calling but he was
[1:12:05] so far off until he flew all the way to
[1:12:08] England and many of them perished in
[1:12:10] there going he talked about how every
[1:12:16] year it was in those geese in the fall
[1:12:18] of the year they would swarm and they
[1:12:21] would get all together they're ready for
[1:12:22] a revival but they don't
[1:12:24] which way to go they've been led so far
[1:12:27] off the track till they can't find their
[1:12:30] way back again it's because of
[1:12:33] leadership it's because of someone
[1:12:35] saying let's go here and they all follow
[1:12:37] they went over to England yet it's in
[1:12:39] their heart to swarm and we want to go
[1:12:42] somewhere and we want something to
[1:12:44] happen but let's bring it spiritual
[1:12:46] because we're the Brendan brought its
[1:12:48] spiritual into the church and talking
[1:12:51] about how people would follow after this
[1:12:53] and follow after that they are so far
[1:12:56] off the track till they can't find their
[1:12:59] way back again and it's so easy to put
[1:13:06] it way out there but we're bringing it
[1:13:08] down here tonight to you and I as a
[1:13:10] person a person can get so far down a
[1:13:13] track so in a mess and things happen in
[1:13:16] their lives they can't find their way
[1:13:18] back tonight we need to grab ahold of
[1:13:21] that calling and that election and say
[1:13:23] God you know what I need in my life and
[1:13:26] if you're at any level of leadership or
[1:13:29] influence with someone else then you're
[1:13:31] responsible to do the right thing
[1:13:35] be a leader
[1:13:37] do the right thing and sometimes that's
[1:13:40] to MIT I am wrong get us back up on
[1:13:43] track and the rejected King brother
[1:13:47] branham was talking about it was brother
[1:13:49] Jean that I think it was jingo that
[1:13:52] brought it to him it was a magazine of
[1:13:54] those geese and how they had a leader
[1:13:56] and they had picked him to be a leader
[1:14:00] and here's some time ago a bunch of them
[1:14:03] they didn't know where he was going and
[1:14:05] didn't know his directions and his
[1:14:06] instinct wasn't just right he flew a
[1:14:09] bunch of geese all the way to England
[1:14:10] they'd never been able to come back
[1:14:12] their nature is to migrate every year
[1:14:15] and they just get together and squawk
[1:14:17] and holler and carry on over there in
[1:14:19] England and they don't know how to get
[1:14:21] back home he say oh that's a funny story
[1:14:25] it's very sad when you have individuals
[1:14:29] that go after this and run after that
[1:14:31] and then
[1:14:32] years go by I'm speaking about marriages
[1:14:35] we're speaking about a brother that just
[1:14:37] bounces around here and there and then
[1:14:40] wonders why is young ladies and young
[1:14:42] girls grow up to be haphazard - it's a
[1:14:45] time that the father's this is the token
[1:14:47] I'm preaching the token tonight that
[1:14:50] they recognize their day their season
[1:14:53] and literally apply the word to their
[1:14:58] own families brother Branham brought
[1:15:02] this right back to Jeffersonville in the
[1:15:04] message guide and talked about that and
[1:15:07] how they had to know and follow he
[1:15:10] didn't know where he was going talking
[1:15:12] about that leadership they went over
[1:15:14] there and they couldn't get back but now
[1:15:16] I'm just gonna end this thought on in
[1:15:17] the individual hearts of all of those
[1:15:20] gifts that had follow they still swarmed
[1:15:23] so it's amazing how people can get all
[1:15:25] excited and get all this and go after
[1:15:27] that and think that it's the blessing of
[1:15:29] God and they can grow and raise families
[1:15:31] and they can all swarm and swarm and
[1:15:34] let's have a singing let's have of this
[1:15:36] let's have a gathering but this is our
[1:15:40] day this is our season what is God
[1:15:44] leading you to do in your life he said
[1:15:47] they swarmed around and around in
[1:15:49] England and they don't know how to get
[1:15:50] back and he talks about how people would
[1:15:53] have a swarm and and a big protracted
[1:15:55] meeting and a revivalist come along and
[1:15:58] preach awhile but you don't know where
[1:16:00] you're going he's talking about
[1:16:01] individuals that they can have a
[1:16:03] protracted meeting say we need a revival
[1:16:06] we need something to happen but when it
[1:16:08] comes down to the end they don't know
[1:16:10] where they're going they don't know
[1:16:13] God's leadership for their life they
[1:16:15] don't know how to pray and what do I do
[1:16:17] that's when an India the only thing that
[1:16:20] we need is the blood and the Spirit of
[1:16:23] God to lead the Bride of Christ he takes
[1:16:26] the message that he's already brought
[1:16:27] and he'll lead you into a rapture
[1:16:30] friends were not going to make it
[1:16:32] without the message and you're not babes
[1:16:37] in Christ and we're not little
[1:16:39] kindergarten children around the throne
[1:16:41] of God I'm not speaking on recognizing
[1:16:43] your day and it's
[1:16:44] Sh tonight I'm speaking on recognizing
[1:16:47] this day and what we need to do
[1:16:51] specifically that means the individual
[1:16:54] being sensitive to God now we're what
[1:16:57] we're actually doing pretty good and
[1:16:58] they're in the end of the service isn't
[1:17:00] that wonderful everybody doing all right
[1:17:02] hey man I got one over here hey man
[1:17:05] how many knows what a mirage is mirages
[1:17:09] were you look out over the road or look
[1:17:12] out over the sand and it looks like
[1:17:14] there's water coming up you see this in
[1:17:16] warmer climates and you that have
[1:17:18] traveled and you go open around and you
[1:17:20] look out and there's like a mirage
[1:17:21] coming up brother Branham talked about
[1:17:27] this how when people get to that state
[1:17:31] and they get anxious and they they're
[1:17:32] looking for answers and they want to
[1:17:34] know direction and they get to that
[1:17:36] state he said the devil begins to show
[1:17:38] you mirages he said you know what a
[1:17:42] mirage is did you ever go down the road
[1:17:44] and look and see the sun shining on the
[1:17:46] road it looks like a lot of water
[1:17:48] how many knows what I'm talking about it
[1:17:50] it looks like a lot of water he said
[1:17:53] it'll fool you and he talked about a
[1:17:58] bunch of geese coming from Canada or
[1:18:00] ducks and they'd seen one of these
[1:18:03] mirages on the road and they fell in the
[1:18:05] road and they all burst it open and they
[1:18:09] thought it was water so it goes back to
[1:18:11] their thoughts he said this is safe
[1:18:13] this is what we need to do and they all
[1:18:15] landed and they all burst it it was a
[1:18:17] mirage and he said oh the devil's got
[1:18:21] many a pitfall for the people it looks
[1:18:23] like it I've seen people thirsty where
[1:18:25] they run into these places and fall into
[1:18:28] them and think they was in water and it
[1:18:30] looks like a big running water and throw
[1:18:32] sand upon their head thinking it's water
[1:18:34] and it's nothing but hot burning sand
[1:18:37] now this part of the service is a
[1:18:40] warning people can run after this job or
[1:18:44] run after this certain hobby or they can
[1:18:46] spend maybe months or years of their
[1:18:48] strength when they should be giving it
[1:18:50] to the word and asking what God would
[1:18:52] have for them and they
[1:18:53] but just bursts apart it's just a mirage
[1:18:57] and you and I would probably think it's
[1:19:00] funny maybe going to Arizona and and to
[1:19:03] Africa and people sitting in the middle
[1:19:06] of the sand just throwing sand on their
[1:19:08] fit you probably say they lost their
[1:19:09] mind you say what happened to that
[1:19:11] person they lost their way no this is
[1:19:13] water this is water isn't this so good
[1:19:15] you say they have lost their way I
[1:19:22] remember some years ago where the West
[1:19:26] might remember this and I remember being
[1:19:29] in a certain place and there was a
[1:19:31] brother that was in the church and he
[1:19:33] you know you can put yourself into a
[1:19:35] room and think you're getting close to
[1:19:37] God and I'm just gonna get alone and get
[1:19:39] with God and I'm just gonna be the
[1:19:41] certain way and you're not eating and
[1:19:42] you're not drinking and pretty soon you
[1:19:44] start getting hysteria you start seeing
[1:19:46] things and this poor brother started
[1:19:49] foaming at the mouth and started being
[1:19:51] in a certain way you know people can
[1:19:52] lean and you can say all that spirits or
[1:19:55] the sister or that brother and and they
[1:19:57] lean toward dreams or certain visions or
[1:20:00] God told them be careful because the
[1:20:03] result of their walk or what happens
[1:20:06] after shows whether that was God or not
[1:20:08] and friends this isn't the time to get
[1:20:11] yourself all crashed up and say well I'm
[1:20:14] just trying to seek this and we're gonna
[1:20:16] do this and make sure it's the will of
[1:20:18] God it's recognizing your season it's
[1:20:25] having understanding about where you
[1:20:27] need to go or what we need to do I wrote
[1:20:30] in my in my office this week just a note
[1:20:34] on my desk I wait until I know what he
[1:20:40] thinks and what he desires for the
[1:20:44] specific situation I wait until I know
[1:20:49] what he thinks and what she desires for
[1:20:53] that specific situation she say well
[1:20:55] brother John I'm past that I mean we're
[1:20:57] up to decision time we're up to a time
[1:20:59] where something needs to be done and I
[1:21:01] need to go a certain way or something
[1:21:03] needs to happen
[1:21:11] I'll just leave it right there because
[1:21:13] the Holy Spirit knows exactly what he
[1:21:15] wants done in your life because knowing
[1:21:20] the word today is more than just quoting
[1:21:23] the word it's more than just repeating
[1:21:27] favorite passages are we together you
[1:21:32] say I know the word I know it's more
[1:21:34] than just repeating and saying key
[1:21:37] phrases in the Bible or in the message
[1:21:39] the devil's not afraid of that he's
[1:21:41] afraid of a son or daughter of God where
[1:21:44] it's Christ speaking through them it's
[1:21:47] more than just having favorite quotes
[1:21:49] that you like and center in your life
[1:21:51] all around that and just repeating that
[1:21:53] and just saying that and friends it can
[1:21:55] be intellectual and don't think that I'm
[1:21:57] being contradictory I'm saying for you
[1:21:59] there has to be where the Holy Spirit
[1:22:02] says that thing where it's the Holy
[1:22:05] Spirit saying this is what we need to do
[1:22:07] friends it must be the mind of Christ
[1:22:09] for today it's what she wants now were
[1:22:13] you and I'm just going into a channel
[1:22:15] here where you step into a channel of
[1:22:18] divine inspiration where the pulsation
[1:22:21] of the Holy Spirit brings it to pass you
[1:22:25] know I was thinking on Friday as I was
[1:22:27] preparing this about Hattie Wright and
[1:22:29] how she was in that room and this might
[1:22:32] bless some of you how she was in that
[1:22:34] room and message of grace brother
[1:22:36] Branham talks about Hattie Wright and
[1:22:38] how she asked for her two children for
[1:22:41] the salvation of her two children and
[1:22:43] and how these two children were and he
[1:22:46] said I give you your children in the
[1:22:49] name of Jesus and they fell right across
[1:22:52] her lap
[1:23:02] how many remember brother Edie Dalton
[1:23:04] brother branham spoke it would be a
[1:23:06] wonderful little study for you as he
[1:23:08] talked about brother Edie Dalton in the
[1:23:11] message he was a Baptist man that began
[1:23:15] to hear the message and brother Branham
[1:23:18] talked to him and he would come to some
[1:23:19] service and then he just I'll just read
[1:23:22] a couple of these things he said Edie
[1:23:23] Dalton a Baptist sitting back there from
[1:23:25] in Kentucky sitting right there how many
[1:23:28] children you got twelve children I told
[1:23:32] you I was going to get into the token
[1:23:34] here it is standing right here he asked
[1:23:37] for his children and I walked out of the
[1:23:40] building and Edie come to me and I said
[1:23:43] Edie the Holy Spirit was on me
[1:23:46] and said give it to him give him and I
[1:23:49] said I give you your children and every
[1:23:53] one of them saved and baptized and there
[1:23:56] was his teenager sitting at home waiting
[1:23:58] and crying has been saved since he was
[1:24:02] up here he said how wonderful that he is
[1:24:05] when he speaks I'm asking him now for
[1:24:08] his glory to show himself that he's
[1:24:10] Christ that I'm telling you the truth
[1:24:13] in another message he said II Dalton
[1:24:15] seem that I'm saying this for a reason
[1:24:17] he was praying for his children and he
[1:24:20] got outside and he turned back around
[1:24:22] and the Holy Spirit said speak French
[1:24:25] children and I said brother Dalton the
[1:24:28] Holy Spirit tells me by that same gift
[1:24:31] that we're looking to be perfectly
[1:24:33] manifested I give you your children in
[1:24:36] the name of Jesus Christ and when she
[1:24:40] got home
[1:24:40] it's a Baptist person but he believed
[1:24:45] the word and it was the Holy Spirit
[1:24:48] spoke to brother Branham said go tell
[1:24:51] him and brother Brown can I give you
[1:24:53] your children I give you your children
[1:24:56] in the name of Jesus Christ and when he
[1:24:59] got home his son and daughter had
[1:25:01] already give their hearts to Christ just
[1:25:03] a few miles down the country from me and
[1:25:06] I think every one of your children is
[1:25:08] saved and filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:25:10] isn't that right brother Dalton is there
[1:25:12] any of the
[1:25:13] with you one daughter or was that the
[1:25:15] one that was saved right away then the
[1:25:17] oldest daughter was saved the next
[1:25:19] morning and every one of his children is
[1:25:22] saved when God says anything he keeps
[1:25:25] his word now how could I have saved
[1:25:28] those children now watch this brother
[1:25:30] Branham is saying how could I have saved
[1:25:33] those children it isn't if it's not your
[1:25:35] own words if it isn't your own thinking
[1:25:38] if it's ever what's inspiring you if
[1:25:41] it's God then it's God's Word so you can
[1:25:47] see in these meetings and see what
[1:25:49] things are happening that's not me I
[1:25:51] couldn't do that it's God doing that if
[1:25:54] you'll just believe it then all you have
[1:25:56] to do is just believe it let me believe
[1:25:59] that tonight now yesterday I followed up
[1:26:02] with a person that's related to that to
[1:26:04] the Dalton family and all 12 of those
[1:26:06] children receive the message and walked
[1:26:09] in the light of this word so it's not
[1:26:14] just that they were saved but they
[1:26:16] received the message that's key we can
[1:26:22] apply the loved ones and we in our house
[1:26:24] shall be saved but for them to believe
[1:26:27] the message and be bribed that's God's
[1:26:29] choice and I don't want to be negative
[1:26:33] or sound opposite but howdy right sons I
[1:26:36] believe they were saved I believe they
[1:26:40] will be safe I believe on that great day
[1:26:42] they they are saved and will be saved
[1:26:44] but if you'd ask the question did they
[1:26:47] go on to receive the message and believe
[1:26:49] like you and I do the question is no oh
[1:26:55] so you say what's different they are
[1:26:58] saved but now that seed of God whether
[1:27:01] they're part of the bride that's God's
[1:27:03] choice and the individual now makes that
[1:27:06] choice manifested by how they live their
[1:27:08] lives friends I think we ought to
[1:27:11] believe for you and your house shall be
[1:27:13] saved hallelujah God gave you your
[1:27:19] children and they shall be saved I just
[1:27:23] think it's a great testimony for the
[1:27:25] Dalton family to have 12 of their
[1:27:27] children all be saved and then when I
[1:27:30] followed up yesterday said all of the
[1:27:32] children believed the message and have
[1:27:34] gone on to serve the Lord in the light
[1:27:36] of this word that's incredible you say
[1:27:40] well that's not my family or that's not
[1:27:42] how it is friends I'm giving you a
[1:27:43] testimony God's Word is true you just
[1:27:48] manifest that you're a son or daughter
[1:27:50] of God God by finding in your day and in
[1:27:53] your season you believe the word you
[1:27:58] know in the message queen of the south
[1:28:00] brother Branham was talking about
[1:28:02] brother Dalton I just have a couple more
[1:28:03] things to say before we close and he
[1:28:06] said brother Dalton I wanted a something
[1:28:08] I'm expecting brother Dalton was talking
[1:28:12] about the squirrels and the new ministry
[1:28:14] and sister Hattie right he said he's
[1:28:17] standing here at the church and his
[1:28:19] children and teenage they were reckless
[1:28:21] as could be and we'd been praying for
[1:28:25] his children and all at once that same
[1:28:28] Jehovah Jireh
[1:28:29] turned around and I said I give you your
[1:28:32] children in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:28:35] every one of them is saved now this is
[1:28:38] another message
[1:28:39] he just keeps referring back to it every
[1:28:42] one of them saved and he said there's
[1:28:45] there's a and he had the brother stand
[1:28:47] there's a Kentucky Baptist preacher with
[1:28:49] the Holy Ghost
[1:28:54] you know how D right had a great desire
[1:28:57] it wasn't money or it would have dropped
[1:29:00] into our lap let's bring it down to
[1:29:02] tonight you say recognizing this day and
[1:29:05] there's a lot of maybe needs among us
[1:29:08] financially but there should be a
[1:29:09] greater desire in all of our hearts that
[1:29:12] that those around us are saved she was a
[1:29:16] poor sister the Mosier family the right
[1:29:19] family for the Brenham had money in his
[1:29:21] pocket to give back to her so it wasn't
[1:29:23] money it wasn't just for the health of
[1:29:26] her family she had a crippled a relative
[1:29:30] her mother and dad was there she even
[1:29:31] asked brother Branham what what should I
[1:29:33] ask for and brother Branham said you got
[1:29:35] an old father and mother you've got a
[1:29:37] crippled sister she's been sitting in
[1:29:38] the chair you could ask
[1:29:40] for her you could ask for your mother
[1:29:42] your father you're poor you don't have
[1:29:44] any money ask what you want she said
[1:29:46] well I don't know what to ask said I
[1:29:48] just don't know but she said my greatest
[1:29:51] desire is the salvation of my two boys
[1:29:54] and immediately brother Branham said I
[1:29:57] said I gives you your boys in the name
[1:30:01] of Jesus Christ and they're both
[1:30:03] converted loves the Lord Jesus has been
[1:30:06] baptized in his name thank the Lord for
[1:30:12] that inspiration let me just say
[1:30:21] something about that Mirage don't let
[1:30:24] the devil make something look so good
[1:30:26] and you follow after it and crash up
[1:30:29] somewhere in communion brother branham
[1:30:32] set out in the deserts and men have lost
[1:30:34] their lives and things from thirst I
[1:30:36] could tell you stories of he said how
[1:30:38] the devil gives you a mirage you've seen
[1:30:41] him you don't want to go west he said
[1:30:43] you see him you go down the road it
[1:30:45] looks like there's water down the road
[1:30:46] every one of you seen that and drove on
[1:30:48] the highway that's a false Mirage and
[1:30:51] maybe some the Lord just gonna help
[1:30:53] somebody hear a false Mirage here's some
[1:30:56] time ago three or four years ago he
[1:30:57] talks about those ducks flying across
[1:30:59] the country they've seen a mirage and
[1:31:02] they sell on the road thinking they were
[1:31:04] hitting the water and they just
[1:31:05] disintegrated hit the hard road they
[1:31:08] thought they were landing on water it
[1:31:10] was a mirage and I was just thinking
[1:31:14] about that when someone feeds on things
[1:31:17] of fantasy through the week they can
[1:31:21] hear the message hear the word be in
[1:31:22] good meetings but then through the week
[1:31:24] they're feeding off a fantasy they're
[1:31:26] feeding off imagination they're feeding
[1:31:28] off things they are not - that will lead
[1:31:30] a person to live a false fake life and
[1:31:34] it's not real they live a life before
[1:31:36] the believers they can sing they can
[1:31:38] shout they can raise their hand they can
[1:31:40] say I love the Lord but if through the
[1:31:42] week they're feeding off of fantasy it's
[1:31:45] a false life don't be disintegrated and
[1:31:50] even on you'd say on the positive now
[1:31:53] I'm close
[1:31:54] because a person could say well brother
[1:31:56] John but I have good desire and I had
[1:31:59] and this is recognizing your day in its
[1:32:01] message
[1:32:01] what brother Branham was saying everyone
[1:32:04] is complaining and ministers crying it's
[1:32:07] in the papers and brother and sister
[1:32:09] hair more and The Herald of his coming
[1:32:11] and they won't print anything unless
[1:32:14] it's fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet
[1:32:17] and he says how many reads it you see it
[1:32:22] all the time fast pray fast pray it's
[1:32:24] all you hear fast pray we're gonna have
[1:32:26] a great breaking of the day there's a
[1:32:28] great something going to happen and they
[1:32:30] they're getting people to look for
[1:32:32] another day he said why do they do that
[1:32:35] why do they do that they want a Great
[1:32:37] Awakening they're crying and believing
[1:32:40] that there will be an awakening they're
[1:32:41] good people but what have they done they
[1:32:44] have not recognized the awakening of the
[1:32:46] brides good people say just let's do
[1:32:51] this let's do that let's sounds like the
[1:32:53] the firefighter squirted a little water
[1:32:55] over here squirt a little they had to
[1:32:57] desire it had good intent but they
[1:33:01] weren't trained by the word brother
[1:33:04] branham said they have not recognized
[1:33:06] the awakening of the bride and by being
[1:33:08] a Christian they feel the pull of the
[1:33:11] hour but they haven't recognized what's
[1:33:13] been done and that's what's making them
[1:33:15] feel that way they know something is
[1:33:19] supposed to happen but they're looking
[1:33:21] for it way off in the future to come
[1:33:23] when it's already happened right by you
[1:33:26] friends could it be possible that today
[1:33:28] God is revealing himself to you this day
[1:33:33] for you to go a certain thing or do it
[1:33:36] that's God's will for your life can you
[1:33:38] take that lord help us to recognize our
[1:33:46] day help us to recognize this day and
[1:33:50] what to do in Jesus name Amen god bless

[1:33:58] the same in every generation find your
[1:34:01] place and go do it so now it's not
[1:34:05] babying around and and
[1:34:07] baby and everyone but it's now
[1:34:08] individuals fighting their way I'm a
[1:34:11] seed of God be like Jacob I'm gonna
[1:34:14] wrestle and grab a hold of this Lord
[1:34:16] getting serious getting sober it's
[1:34:21] amazing how people can find God's will
[1:34:23] and the musicians can come find God's
[1:34:26] will for everyone else's life and
[1:34:28] they're stumbling around themselves they
[1:34:30] just don't know they don't know what to
[1:34:32] do and then they can just describe
[1:34:34] everyone what they oughta friends it's
[1:34:36] time they're individually we find our
[1:34:38] day our season and what to do and it's
[1:34:42] not a great mystery you say words it's
[1:34:45] just all a mystery know life isn't all a
[1:34:46] mystery sons of God are led by the
[1:34:50] Spirit of God he reveals the mysteries
[1:34:54] say well let's go read the Seventh Seal
[1:34:57] book no it's you finding God's will for
[1:34:59] your life and going in doing that and I
[1:35:03] would go listen to this heaven seal
[1:35:04] don't get me wrong but it's in the word
[1:35:06] that you find your place and the Holy
[1:35:09] Spirit can anoint you don't follow after
[1:35:12] mirages are we all okay tonight don't
[1:35:16] follow after somebody they say oh let's
[1:35:18] go here let's go there and swarming
[1:35:20] around you follow the Holy Spirit let
[1:35:23] that be a great encouragement tonight as
[1:35:25] we stand tonight glory to God we are the
[1:35:29] generation we are the consummation final
[1:35:32] voice the world will hear
[1:35:36] we are the generation
[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:36:09] [Applause]
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:58] has the question tonight some might say
[1:37:02] well it goes without saying who wants to
[1:37:05] recognize your day we want to recognize
[1:37:08] our day this day spoke about Esau and
[1:37:13] Jacob and if you want to follow that
[1:37:15] through even into Moses and month under
[1:37:19] Moses ministry many were saved and
[1:37:21] called out and came out under that first
[1:37:24] token and many died in the wilderness
[1:37:27] they couldn't go all the way under that
[1:37:30] Joshua and Caleb spirit so they came out
[1:37:34] under Moses ministry they were saved
[1:37:37] they were called out but it was that
[1:37:39] Joshua and Caleb group that inherited
[1:37:42] the promise and that's the group that
[1:37:45] the brightest part of
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:50] that's the positive if you want to read
[1:37:54] judges it talks about another generation
[1:37:56] that came up that didn't know the Lord
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:38:00] yet their mommy or their daddy could
[1:38:02] have came out under the toque and they
[1:38:03] say we believe the promise let's go into
[1:38:06] our land but individually we've got to
[1:38:08] go into our land and tonight serveth has
[1:38:11] been for us in 2020 to recognize we've
[1:38:16] received a message but it's not good
[1:38:18] enough to just leave it out there broad
[1:38:20] and it's to hone it on down for you for
[1:38:23] your house recognizing this day and what
[1:38:28] we need to do don't die in the
[1:38:31] wilderness somewhere don't drown out
[1:38:34] there somewhere and you find your place
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:41] and I mentioned the word hostile if you
[1:38:45] if you listen to recognizing your day in
[1:38:48] its message brother Branham talked about
[1:38:49] people and the ages they get hostile
[1:38:52] against those that are finding their
[1:38:54] place even Jesus they got hostile
[1:38:57] against him you find it in Noah's day
[1:38:59] and he said the reason people in Noah's
[1:39:02] day did not get in the ark is because
[1:39:05] they never recognized the message or the
[1:39:07] message messenger that's the only reason
[1:39:11] they perish is because they didn't
[1:39:13] recognize the hour that they were living
[1:39:15] they didn't recognize that God would
[1:39:17] deal with sin as he promised he would
[1:39:20] and here we are today God dealing with
[1:39:24] the bride in a certain way I just pray
[1:39:27] he bless each one of you as we bow our
[1:39:29] heads tonight Lord Jesus we are blessed
[1:39:34] people to fear Lord now this message can
[1:39:40] go throughout the whole world and the
[1:39:43] languages individuals labored and work
[1:39:46] to get into every tongue now we have men
[1:39:49] and women rising up pray that your
[1:39:52] anointing would be upon every seat every
[1:39:54] elect seed upon every family those that
[1:39:58] are even within our church and those
[1:40:00] that have heard these things this
[1:40:02] morning and today that we would follow
[1:40:04] on and in maturity recognizing this hour
[1:40:09] and this season and what they need to do
[1:40:13] housewives would recognize it fathers
[1:40:17] would recognize it young people older
[1:40:20] ones
[1:40:22] from our youth you have taught us these
[1:40:24] things and even as years have gone by
[1:40:27] and elders now have carried this torch
[1:40:30] for many years help us now to recognize
[1:40:33] this day and this season and this time
[1:40:37] that we're living now and what we need
[1:40:39] to do bless your people Lord may there
[1:40:43] be healing this week even last week I'm
[1:40:47] sure if we talk to each one of the
[1:40:49] ministers they've prayed for ones
[1:40:51] privately or been to certain places you
[1:40:55] have done miracles this past week you
[1:40:58] have done great things this past week
[1:41:00] Lord and often times we don't speak
[1:41:03] about them publicly or make loud
[1:41:05] declarations but you are answering
[1:41:08] prayers just a couple Wednesday nights
