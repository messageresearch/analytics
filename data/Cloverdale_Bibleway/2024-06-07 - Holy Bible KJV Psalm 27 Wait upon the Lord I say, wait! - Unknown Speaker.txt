Psalm 27 a Psalm of David the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord here oh Lord Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou sest seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou Hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of mine enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord
