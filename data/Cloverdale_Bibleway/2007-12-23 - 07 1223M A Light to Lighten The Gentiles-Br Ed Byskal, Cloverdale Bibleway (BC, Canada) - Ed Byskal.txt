========================================
[Music] Want to welcome everyone this morning to the house of God. This is a day when most of the world's going to be out shopping. I think everybody rushing around the last minute because the most important thing to them is Christmas presents, right? Don't want to disappoint anyone. I trust you've received, Brother Brandham said, the ultimate Christmas gift, which is Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And uh I want to sing a couple of uh old Christmas carols this morning. These are songs and I remember sitting and I had paid much attention as a kid to Christmas carols. We kind of sang them at Christmas time and I remember just uh not long after we had some of the we had uh I think Jake went into school. It was in elementary school. We went in there for some little Christmas concert they had and they started singing one of the Christmas carols and I started reading the words. Wow, these words are good. Everybody in here is hearing the gospel whether they realize it or not. they were hearing the gospel. So, some of these songs we only sing once a year, but uh maybe uh there's nothing wrong with that. And uh well, sometimes my kids, you know, they just uh get uh Christmas always being a wonderful family time for us. And sometimes I'd walk in in the middle of July and hear Christmas carols going on in the house. Says some of these songs got great words. So, let's stand this morning and we'll sing uh number 792 on the screen. Amen. We're worshiping the Lord this morning. Amen. Do you love him? Praise God.

We are the bloodbought. We're the purchased of God. We are the ones that were picked up from the muk and mire of this world. There was a hand that reached down. There was a hand that brought us forth, washed us in the blood of the lamb. And we're thankful for that. We're asking that you will come forth out of your word and speak to us.

Amen. and you can have your seats this morning. We're happy to have each and every one of you here this morning. And if you're visiting here, we're just uh we just want to make you real welcome. And uh I think the Sunday school kids are going to come and sing now. They ready to they ready to roll? Assume so. Nobody's shaking their head. Nobody's nodding to say yes either. So, we'll get the Sunday school kids to come in and uh get ready and maybe as they do um we can sing number 789 on the screen. Sing a couple of uh verses of Hark the Herald Angel sing. If you were here, the kids were uh did their Christmas concert on Thursday night. They talked about this one of the songs talked about written by Charles Wesley. Hark the herald angel sing. Hark the herald angels sing. Glory to glory. Peace and mercy of God. Heat. Heat. Heat. Great. Christ is born [Music] the angels sing. Glory to the newborn. Christ my life. I see everlasting heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. to appear. Jesus I angels sing. Glory to the newborn king. Hail the her rightousness. I am alive to all he brings with he glory to raise to give him second [Music] The herald angels sing, glory to the newborn king. [Music] [Music] longing for a savior, a hopeless world would wait. Sin demanded justice at a price we could not pay. But God displayed his mercy. The greatest gift of love. When we could not reach heaven, heaven came to us. He made a way in a manger. Away through the star [Music] of the promise before time had beun for God so love this world. But we knew what love would fall away in a manger. to make a way to the cross. In Bethlehem a stable became a throne of grace. As God himself our savior drew near to take our place. His mother smiled in wonder. The shepherd stood in awe. The sacrifice of heaven lay sleeping in the stone. He made a way of danger away through the sun. The sign of the promise before time had beun [Music] for us to love this world. Though we knew what love would want, we made a way in a manger to make a way to [Music] he got our death. [Music] The precious Lord Jesus lay down his sweet [Music] away in a manger. No crib for a bed. The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head. [Music] The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay. The little Lord Jesus asleep on the head. He made a way in a manger. Away through the sun of the promise before time of this world. But he knew what would [Music] he in [Music] to make a way to the cross. He made a way in a manger to make a way to the cross. Oh, [Music] heat. [Applause] Thank you very much children. It's wonderful. Get tired of hearing the kids sing and it gets even more interesting when some of our attributes are up there. Right, brother Tom? It's a bit strange. Um, still haven't quite gotten used to it. Amen. Uh, there's a note here. Bible way Christian Academy students will be singing tonight. Parents, please have your children in the fellowship room at 4:45 tonight before the service. Um, the senior choir is going to come up as soon as the uh smaller ones have taken their seats. Um, they're going to sing a a song that I've asked them to sing this morning that uh been going over my mind for the last three or four days and I've I've got up uh I know this morning, yesterday morning and this song was just going over my head and uh you know, brother Brandon said today Christian means a carton of camels, a bottle of serum wrapped up in pretty Santa Claus paper, but they still refuse God's Christmas gift. They still refuse his Christmas gift. They don't want it. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I want it. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I received it." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I wonder tonight in this building, in this Christmas time, in commemoration of nearly 2,000 years ago, when God gave the first Christmas gift, I wonder tonight if you'd look, like to look on the inside of that package and see, sinner, that there isn't somebody in there who loves you. Somebody who died for you, somebody who gave their life for you. Would you be willing tonight to take the swaddling's cloth off of him, that dirty cloth that they call fanatic and holy roller, wrap yourself up in it, and take the way with the Lord's despised few. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's all I want this morning, saints. So, if the senior choir could come, they're going to sing this uh song. And that's certainly my cry of my heart this morning. I know it is and it should be everyone here. I trust we can worship the Lord together as they sing this song. You're all I want, Lord. You're all I need. Amen. We want to worship him in the spirit of truth. Amen. We believe that he's here this morning. Amen. To receive that worship. Amen. We want to prepare our hearts this morning to receive the word of God so that when our pastor comes to speak, Amen. The seed will fall on a prepared ground. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Have you really thought how wonderful is our Lord Jesus Christ? He redeemed us by his precious blood. We are his purchase price. For I know what I was and I know where he took me from. We were sinners bound in chains. Lord, we didn't know we had your name. We thank you Lord Jesus. We thank you Lord Jesus. You're all I want. Heavenly Father, you're all that I need. Lord, we worship you in the beauty of holiness. For what your word has done for us, we hide it in our hearts. We will not let the enemy steal it away. You're all I want. Heavenly Father, you're all I want. You are the great kinsman, redeemer, the mighty one of wealth. In whose sight we have found grace. We know you will not rest until you finish the work that you've begun in us. We are your bride. Jesus. We are your [Applause] Lord. You're all I want. [Applause] We worship you. We worship you. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. You're all [Music] worship. [Music] [Music] Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. You're all [Music] hallelujah. Let's worship him. Saints, you're all that we want, Lord. You're all that we need, oh God. Oh, we worship you, Lord. Lord, you are worthy of our praise this morning, Lord. Hallelujah. Glory to your name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our purpose of being here today. &gt;&gt; When shepherds arrived, they worshiped him. &gt;&gt; Sometime later, when the wise men arrived, they worshiped him. Sometime later, the disciples arrived and they worshiped him. &gt;&gt; And all down through the ages, those who love him worship him. &gt;&gt; And we are here today for that one purpose, to worship him, to give him honor. Amen. &gt;&gt; You came into the world a sinner so he could save you. So you could worship him. We were born in sin, shaped in iniquities, &gt;&gt; but God saved us so we could worship him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think we should say in fact is we wouldn't be able to worship him unless he'd sent the Holy Spirit within us. So we can worship him in spirit and in &gt;&gt; truth. &gt;&gt; Truth. &gt;&gt; Many worship in spirit, spirit only. &gt;&gt; But it's in spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the father desires to worship him. Perhaps we could just sing that together. We worship you in spirit and in truth. And uh we're happy to have each of you here, those that are visiting. Nice to see you, Brother Chris. God bless you. Amen. One thing about having Brother Chris, you don't miss him very easy. And when he sits on the front seat, you don't miss him at all. Hallelujah. God bless him. Nice to have you all here. Are you happy to be here? Praise the Lord. We're having a wonderful time. Amen. Before we sing this, I want to give a special acknowledgement to our brother and sister Henry Hayes Senior and his wife. They had 61 years of of marriage as of yesterday. That was their anniversary yesterday. Amen. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] That's the grace of God. Amen. I tell you today 61 years is a real milestone. Amen. God bless them. All right, let's just sing it together. We worship you in spirit. [Music] We worship you. [Music] your word and your presence. [Music] We worship you. &gt;&gt; We've heard your word. We've heard your word and found your presence. [Music] We worship you in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Our dear heavenly father, we have come and gathered together with a one single purpose in our minds that we might worship you. We want to worship you in spirit and in truth. We want to worship you in such a way that it will be acceptable and received by you. We do not want uh just idle words on our lips but out of the very depths of our soul. We want something of reality, Lord, to rise up to give you thanks that we can be here today in the land of the living in this golden age that your prophet spoke about. Oh God, you have given us such a privilege to e to express and to make known this Christ which has come which has been given to the world. And we think of the revealing of Jesus Christ in this hour. We think of the fulfillment of Luke 17, the 30th verse. Lord, even thus will it be when the Son of Man is revealed. And here you are, Lord, in bride form in your children by your spirit and by your word. Take your word now, I pray. anoint us mightily by the Holy Ghost that we can Lord hear it that it will be a reality to us and so made so real. Burn it, inscribe it, Lord, with your finger upon the tablets of our heart. I pray father you'll bless all wherever they may be throughout this planet Father throughout the earth Lord wherever people are streaming and through the technology that you've allowed Lord that we can join together hearttoheart and attribute to attribute not only within this building but wherever your body of Christ is today pray you'll anoint us Lord anoint me to bring your thoughts to the people in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you. I'll invite you to turn in your Bibles to uh the book of Luke, the 2 chapter, and we're going to begin reading at verse 21. And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcision circumcising of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. Isn't it wonderful that the first time the name was mentioned, it was came out of the lips of an angel from the presence of God. And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord. As it is written in the law of the Lord, every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord. and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons. And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law, then took he him in his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now let us thy thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people, a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel. I'd like you to notice the 32nd verse. I light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel. If you would turn also back to Matthew's uh gospel the fourth chapter uh I'd like to just read it just a very few verses starting with verse 13. And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the border of Zabulon and Nephilim, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, "The land of Zabulon and the land of Nephilim, by the way of the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, the people which sat in darkness saw saw great light. And to them which sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up. And from that time Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." God bless you. As you have your seats, I've taken a a title to the message this morning from the uh 32nd verse in our first reading, a light to lighten the Gentiles. And that is the title of the message this morning, a light to lighten the Gentiles. The uh the word light of course is very uh common to us and uh I find that in the scriptures God has allowed the scriptures to be written in the Old Testament in the Hebrew and the New Testament in the Greek which we've received and God even knows you know how it was to be conveyed to us. But I find that certain words uh which we read and and it will have a specific meaning to us as individuals in in our uh English language. It and it may have exactly the same meaning in the in the Hebrew or the Greek. But as you look at the word and find out how it was used throughout the scripture, you'll find that it has a much broader uh meaning. much much a deeper meaning than we would normally have in our in our mental understanding of the word. And I believe that even God, he knew exactly how he wanted a certain thought conveyed. And I believe it's important for us as ministers to be able to convey the full depth of that thought. And so it says that uh now in the in the Old Testament for example when it's used the word light because the scripture in in Isaiah and it's one that uh brother Brandham used in the message shalom and I will be using some quotes out of that message today. It was his uh Thanksgiving or New Year's uh service I would say for 1964. And uh the scripture there is arise and shine for thy light, thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. And the light in the Hebrew is simply it's aura which we use the word we we know what aura is. It's a it's a light that's around a person. And uh but in the Hebrew when it says thy light has come it is the light of life or the light of prosperity uh the light of instruction the light of someone's face that someone looks upon you and uh they look favorably upon you the light of someone's face or the light of Jehovah uh God as being Israel's light. So when I refer to the aura, your light has come. The light of blessing, the light of prosperity, the light of instruction, the light of the countenance of God, who is the light of Israel. Uh all of that is what they understood when that single word was used. When we talk about light, you know, a lot of our children today and so on may think of the light and the light switch and the the bulb in the ceiling, but that's not what we want to be thinking about. We want to be thinking of it in terms that God God spoke it so we can get his his thought. And uh in the message shalom uh brother Brandon makes this reference and and there's three things here that I need to uh inject at this moment so we can have you follow my thought through the service. said, "We're facing here uh uh we're facing here in our two subjects." That was the scripture which they read uh arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee. The second verse is verse two of Isaiah 60 6 is for behold darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And so that's why brother Brandham uses and says there's two subjects here in the scripture. Uh a very contrast one to the other and arise and shine for the glory is upon thee. And the next verse gross darkness is upon the people. And then when we are in a mixtury, now it's not an English word that we use, but we it's amazing how brother Brandham used words and we knew exactly what he meant. Even though you can't find it in the dictionary, he know you know precisely what he's talking about. And so he says and and when we are in a mixtury of light and darkness and that's exactly what we have. We have light here but darkness is coming to another part of the world at the same time. And somewhere between that we have maybe dawn or evening and dusk coming because it's a mixtury of the two uh between the light and the darkness. It says we have a mixtury. And then my address to the church is shalom or peace to the church. And yet there was darkness, gross darkness upon the people. Now I want to come to the uh uh to the uh he the English as compared to the Greek uh in the light and I'm just taking a little bit of time to to kind of lay this foundation for you because in the scripture which we have uh read uh a light to lighten the I want to bring those two words a light to lighten. And the light in the Hebrew and in the Greek are slightly slightly different. But in the New Testament, we have God is light and in him is no darkness at all. Then Jesus said, I am the light of the world and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness. And then Jesus said, you are the light of the world. So it says God is light. said Jesus said I am the light and Jesus said you are the light &gt;&gt; and this word light is light of truth the light of knowledge together with spiritual purity. light as the power of understanding especially moral spiritual truth and that word light comes from a a second word in the in the uh Greek which is and this is important it is for something to appear so if it's in darkness you can't see it but if light comes it's not just that let there be light and and there's light. No, the purpose of God was that light would come so that something else can appear so that something else can come into view. And so it the word light which is foss what we have in the he in the Greek phosphorus. And so that is where where we get the word light. But then it comes from this uh pheno which is to appear or god intends light so something can be seen or to bring forth into the light so that it can be understood. It is to cause something to shine so it can become evident. He wants it to become evident. Something that can meet the eyes or strike the eyes or something that he wants to make manifest so it can be made uh not just evident but that you can get some understanding from it. You understand? Because actually what God wants you to understand is his purpose of bringing he brings light causes something to appear because he wants you to understand by what's appearing what his purpose what his motive and what his uh uh what what is in his thoughts. He wants to convey something and that's the whole that's the whole purpose. Is this making sense to you? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's not just, oh, light. Oh, there's a light. No, that's not it. When the Bible speaks about light, it is so that so that something can uh be light can shine upon something to bring it into view to bring it into manifestation so that when you see it, it it enlightens you and that's why it says a light to enlighten because I want to also go into the into the word to enlighten, but it's to bring it and and and there's one more Greek word that so there's two compound words with the light and the last one is it's to say or to speak to affirm or to declare and make known one's thoughts. So now here we have what the what the light is to make known. It's not just to bring something to make it evident to make it visible but it is to convey to the people and God's purpose is to make known and declare his thoughts. And now you have this is a light to lighten the Gentiles. And the word lighten is much much deeper than just light itself. a light to lighten the Gentiles. And the word lighten uh is is a it's used in the Bible in this in this way. But here's the actual direct meaning. It is a revelation. Something to be revealed. It's manifestation. It is also a person coming. Person coming into your presence. That person is appearing. that has to do with lighten because uh someone coming into your presence coming to you uh right away. I mean I know it's going to conjure up some thoughts to say this person's approaching me why are they approaching me? What what is the purpose? What are they going to say? Uh you know what is this event that's taking place? And so it can have to do with coming or appearing. It is a a disclosure of truth, instruction concerning things that before were unknown. It is used of events of which things or uh or persons hitherto withdrawn from view are made visible by a manifestation or by an appearance. And it is to uncover or to lay bare. I have some uh just a half a dozen or so slides. I'd like you to see how this is used in the Bible. The word lighten, it appears in the New Testament just 18 times. And uh let's see here. Okay. If I may have the the uh the next portion please. Okay, you read these and then breaking away. Somehow these are not the I saved I saved a number of slides here but it seems that this isn't exactly uh the ones that I had in mind. Uh those aren't they those are good, but they're not the ones I had. So, I hope you enjoyed reading reading that. I'm probably will read some of those uh some of those quotes as we move on. But let let me just get to this uh uh I want to go back to the word lighten. It's used 18 times in the New Testament. And here's how it's used. Oh my. Well, let's try that then. That was it. Who's ever using this thing? All this technology is so marvelous. If I can just get up there, what I see down here, brothers, it'll just be wonderful. All right, we're making some headway. I hope you have a little time. The way things are going looks like we might need a little bit of time. All right, it's used as lighten once, revelation or revealed 14 times manifestation once coming of Christ once the appearing of Jesus Christ once his appearing. So the word lighten, revelation, revealed, manifestation, coming and appearing. Those are the words that are used in the New Testament. So when and the scripture says, now just collect your thoughts with me. And Simeon came by the Holy Ghost and took the child and spoke and uttered these words. A light to lighten the Gentiles. And when you come to lighten now, a light to reveal, a light that will be a revelation to the Gentiles, a light that will be a manifestation. It will be something that will be brought evident before them. Cause them to see it. This is something that God is doing just the same as Jesus Christ himself. I I mean here Simeon by the Holy Ghost is brought into he's he's drawn into by the Holy Ghost into an into an event in his life and now he's holding a a little infant child in his arms and he's prophesying and saying strange things. This will be a light to lighten the Gentiles. This will this right here, what is embodied here is going to be a a manifestation to the Gentiles. This right here is going to be a revelation to the Gentiles. And yet he was coming to Israel at that time. But that was the purpose. He will be a light to lighten the Gentiles. And this will be this will refer also to his appearing. This will refer to his coming. All of these are are linked together and in that one word, a light to lighten the Gentiles. And here are the here are some scriptures as they come. You'll see how it's used in the in the New Testament. A light to lighten the Gentiles and uh the glory of thy people Israel. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. Now to him that is of of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began. the the the revelation of the mystery. In other words, to lighten this is the purpose is to lighten uh uh to lighten the people of something that had been kept secret. And in the book of Revelation is the last time it's used, the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly uh come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant. And to you who are troubled, rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed or for the purpose of lightening to lighten from heaven with his mighty angels. And that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto the praise and honor and glory at the uh appearing, which is the same word lighten of Jesus Christ. So that you come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. a light to light. And those are just the scriptures which I thought would be uh important so you can tie together how it is used in the New Testament. Now, brother Brandon makes this quote because uh I'll say as an introduction, there are many many phrases and I'm going to refer to quite a few of them this morning that have reference to light. I want to speak about the light of truth, the light of freedom, the light of morality, things that we enjoy in our in our country, in our civilization. Things that we enjoy, we shouldn't take them for granted, &gt;&gt; but they are light. And while we enjoy them as light, I want us also be mindful things that you are enjoying in these various uh areas that I want to focus on. I like to also be mindful that there are those that are not enjoying that light and there are those that are in a mixtury. They're not in a a life of total darkness, but neither are they in a light of truth, &gt;&gt; but they're enjoying at least some measure of light. They're in a evening. They're in a dusk time and that's very very evident and I'm sure that you'll see it much clearer. Now, what is light? And brother Brandham, he's very very explicit. Light is the word of God made manifest. &gt;&gt; In the beginning said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; He said, "If a fog came, then it wasn't God's word. &gt;&gt; Let there be light." It might have been hundreds of millions of years after God said it. But once God said it, it was going to become evident. It was going to become manifested. And there was a purpose in it becoming manifested because God intended that that the light would bring uh into being some other things that he wanted to express his own thoughts and his own mind. And so the light brought forth life. He said life life only comes by the word of God made manifest. And as long as it is just in the book like this, as long as it's just in the book like this, It still can be questioned. But when it's made manifest, &gt;&gt; when it happens, when it becomes an event, then it can no longer be questioned. &gt;&gt; Once it's manifest, he says, then you see the product. Hallelujah. We've seen the product. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sure even with Simeon when he said those words, those that were gathered there and those who were listening, those who were had also brought their children maybe wondered at the kind of words he was saying, perhaps saying, "I wish he could pray that kind of prayer over my baby." But now the Holy Spirit was causing him to say something because now God's word, God's promise through Isaiah had become evident and had become manifested. But it was only the beginning because there was so much more that would be made known through him. And so he said it is become manifested. And then he said that is light on the word. When God's word becomes manifested then that's light on the word. That is the first time you can actually understand what the Bible said &gt;&gt; is when it's manifested and a man can turn on the light. He said Christ is the light. Of course, the whole world will say that. And the word manifested is the light of the hour. Let there be light and there was light. Yes, sir. Let there be light and there is light. And then in the in the message shalom once again just I want to lay these down. He said the sun I want you to think about the sun is the word of God. In the beginning God said let there be light. And when the manifested word of God when the word of God was manifested there was light. So God spoke it, but when it manifested, then light came. And when light came, that is the word of God. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God manifested. He said, "First God spoke it." What if it didn't manifest? Then it wasn't light yet. But when he spoke it, and then when it was then it was manifested or vindicated, his word was vindicated. light came into existence and that's the only way that it can be done now. So now we go from Genesis 1 to today and that's still the only way that light can come. God has to have spoken it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I did some research and in, you know, in my studies, you got thinking about the people talk about the light of truth. Oh my goodness. I tell you what, it's the darkness of confusion. every guru and every great teacher and all religions just uh a total mass of confusion. But if you read their words, the words will say that the truth of light. They have the truth of light. And if you come to this, you'll have the truth of light and you'll have some kind of peace. And somewhere along the line, you'll have a few exercises of yoga thrown in just for good measure because you're going to come to the truth. You're going to come to the light of this truth. Oh, utter confusion. &gt;&gt; Utter just nonsense. &gt;&gt; Just man's thoughts, man's words. But if you only and that's why a prophet he gives it he gives it full I tell you he gives it full uh uh ability and and full measure when he says if it's just in the book it's just in the word it still can be questioned but when God hallelujah almighty God takes that word and breaks it evident and say here it is folks here it is in full view then you can't question it anymore &gt;&gt; that is why you find you find in all the areas all the areas of opposition and question concerning brother Brandham's life and his ministry have to do they'll take some word that he spoke but they cannot deny the evidence when the evidence is brought forth by a supernatural almighty God it's beyond question &gt;&gt; and I've never had anybody I've had all Times do people come in to debate with me about what brother Brandham said, but they never once in my entire life have they come to debate about what happened on the platform, what happened in the evidence when the evidence came forward. There is no space to question the evidence. I thank God we're not we're not on this, you know, this word or that word. But when God took that word and brought it before the people and said, "Here's what I said." &gt;&gt; Here's the evidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then it's beyond any question. &gt;&gt; And when it's manifested, he said, "That's when it's light." Yeah. &gt;&gt; When something happens then and you know that God did it because no man can do it. That's what God intended to be light. That's what he intended for us to be responsible for. &gt;&gt; That's what he'll judge the world by. What they had an opportunity to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said here, "And when the word of God was manifested, there was light." And that's the only way it can be done now. It's when when the word is vindicated, God's written word. So we have the written word. Oh, of all the debate and discussion. Can you can you just imagine for a moment the volumes of books that are contrary one from the other? Can you imagine what 3,000 denominations over 3,000 dominations have gathered out of this book? Can you just imagine for a moment all the different theories of the book of Revelation alone? Can you just let your mind and imagination try to drift out into the great great somewhere and imagine the volumes and millions of books and theories that are written concerning this book and if you were turned loose and I said to you discover the truth &gt;&gt; you'd say it's impossible &gt;&gt; and I'd say you're exactly right &gt;&gt; completely impossible so it's incumbent It's absolutely essential that whoever is the author of this book come and make it live. &gt;&gt; And unless he makes it live, you'll never know what the truth is. &gt;&gt; And if anything that if what Simeon said was truly of the Holy Ghost, that this is a light to lighten the Gentiles, then he was saying this is a light that will manifest. This is a light that will make it evident. This is a life that's going to make it happen. This is a life that's going to do something. &gt;&gt; This is a light that's going to bring it right into appearance. &gt;&gt; And you will have no mistake because God, the life that was in him will do it. &gt;&gt; It's not going to just be a theory. It's not just going to remain in the Torah. It's not just going to remain in the Bible. It's going to be it's going to become a living word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it's not a light to lighten. &gt;&gt; And he said, God in this word has given a portion of the word for every age. And then he sends along his elected individual, maybe a prophet or a messenger or a reformer, whatever he has called for that age, for that moment in time. And that vessel has been called and ordained of God. So that God by the Holy Spirit will take this little portion of this word and cause that individual to make that word come alive. &gt;&gt; It's for that age. &gt;&gt; And the reason for that is so that the people of that time can behold it because it will come into view and the light will shine upon it and the person will make it live. And then he doesn't have to say I he doesn't have to say I want your attention people. I'm going to make this piece of scripture live. That's not what happens. He just comes out reads a scripture and God does through the individual what he intends to do for that age. And the people can see it and say that's God &gt;&gt; because a man can't do that. That's God. And now what do they receive? They receive light. &gt;&gt; Knowledge comes. &gt;&gt; Understanding comes. truth comes and now they know how I must live and how I must conduct myself because a vindicated word has spoken it. &gt;&gt; Something that works happened. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to have a gospel that works? I had here just to go back to Eden for a moment. Before the word could manifest in Adam and Eve before the word even had an opportunity said multiply, replenish the earth, multiply and bring forth. But before that could happen, the serpent moved in and he added one word. And by adding one word, shadows came, &gt;&gt; a heavy dusk came, &gt;&gt; and before very long they found themselves in darkness and nighttime. And the Bible says Adam lost his way. Of course, he lost his way because darkness had encompassed him. And the darkness came because light came by word. Darkness also came by word. &gt;&gt; Is the congregation getting that? &gt;&gt; Light came by word. And when God spoke it, then it came into being. It came manifested. And then people had light. &gt;&gt; Whether it was the light of the sun or the light of understanding, whatever it was. But now the serpent added a word. &gt;&gt; You shall not surely die and darkness came and the perfect light was eclipsed. Why don't you just hold that word? The perfect light was eclipsed by another word, by another thought. He said in God of this evil age and the bride of Adam believed Satan's knowledge against God's word and the bride of Christ has believed Satan's knowledge in this intellectual evil age against God's word and notice Eve in the natural that believed it and plunged the whole human race to death. Let me ask you, is death light or is death darkness? &gt;&gt; It's darkness, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Is sickness light or is it darkness? &gt;&gt; I'd say it's darkness. Is poverty light or is it actually darkness, a heaviness? If you had to live in utter poverty, is confusion light or is it darkness? It's darkness. So, we have a lot of darkness to contend with. Morality, a moral purity, is it light or is it darkness? It's light. Immorality. Evil is darkness. Plunged the whole human race to death. Adam, the natural man of the earth, his bride, before he got to her to be wife, plunged the whole human race into death. Whether it's scientific or not, we uh we die just the same. &gt;&gt; We're dying people, friends. And there probably isn't anyone here but what has been touched by the separation of death and this darkness. And if we could, we'd avoid it. If we could, we'd change it. But we're all headed there. &gt;&gt; Every person that's here is headed there. You better make certain you have a light, the light of truth that goes beyond this little brief life. you that are here and young and you look towards a great great future, you don't really know how much future you have because even the life that you have and the youth that you have and the strength that you have and whatever it is that you have and whatever it is that God has given you that has made your life full of light and and happiness and joyful and so on, just remember that darkness is not very far. It's just the other side of the the other side of the globe. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Whether you're in holy Eden or holy church or holy denomination," and that would include everybody here or whatever it might be, you will die the day you disbelieve one word of God's word. Isn't that a staggering statement? Doesn't matter whether you're in Holy Eden or a Holy Church or in Cloverdale Bible Way or wherever you might be or whatever denomination or whatever it might be that you're in. If you disbelieve one word of God's word to be the truth, when it's vindicated and proved to you, not when it's just in a book being debated and being discussed, but when it's been proven to you. when it's been vindicated to you. He said, "A man and God's truth is vindicated and proved to you, that's the day you separate yourself from God." And just one more before I more or less get into the substance of the message. And we see by representation of this word as Satan misrepresented it to Eve caused her to doubt one word and threw the whole human race into a fallen chaos. Just one word. He says then we see in the middle of the book came our Lord and Savior and he gave us the quotation concerning it. Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. Brother Brandham is going from Eden from Genesis to the middle of the book and now to Revelation and the solemn warning at the last of the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ. Whosoever shall add one word or take away uh or take away his part will be taken from the book of life. So I say to this congregation this morning, if words uh if words of light uh versus words of darkness, one word was added brought the darkness. I believe that &gt;&gt; I happen to believe that one word in the beginning brought every sick hospital, every bed &gt;&gt; in the hospital where the sick people are. One word brought every prison cell onto the earth. &gt;&gt; One word. Who can assimilate in their mind and grasp the depth of darkness that can come by one word? It behooves us to believe every word of God. It behooves us to live by every word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I just speak now for a moment on the light of truth. We're going to turn a couple of sharp corners here in a few moments. The light of truth. The psalmist said, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my pathway." He said also in Psalms 119:13, "The entrance of thy words giveth light. It giveth understanding unto the simple." Peter said in his epistle, "We have also a more sure word of prophecy, where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star rise in our hearts." A wise man Solomon said in Proverbs, "For the commandment is a lamp and the law is light." These are powerful. And John has said, "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth." &gt;&gt; Walking in truth was walking in light. The truth is light. I believe it's important for us as individuals to be truthful with ourselves. &gt;&gt; And you have to think about that sometimes it's difficult to be truthful with your own self. What your convictions the the voice of God to your own heart. We need to be truthful to ourselves. We need to be truthful to what God has said that you are. &gt;&gt; And I find that this is a big contravention even amongst message believers. It's hard for them. Many, it's hard for them to actually confess with conviction that what God has said. Let me let me give you a little secret which I feel has been a secret in my life for myself as an individual. There isn't any man or woman who walks with God but what hits the bottom of the barrel sometime. &gt;&gt; You really strike bottom. &gt;&gt; And when you do, I'll give you this. What I consider has been a secret for me in my life. I've hit bottom. Everybody's hit bottom. I think we'd be less than truthful if we said, "Oh, no. Everything's just uh beautiful and wonderful all the time." No, that might be the facade. That might be what we portray. That might be how people see us. But down inside, you're the only one who really knows. And that's when you have to be truthful with yourself. &gt;&gt; You have to say, "Well, am I really on the bottom?" And Satan comes in with all of his hordes of hell and tells you that there is no hope and you're not even a believer. And if there is a rapture, for sure you're not going in it. And all kinds of things. And the world just presses in. And I can tell you that uh Satan has a lot of uh imps and a lot of spirits to bring every kind of oppression to an individual. So what this joyous time the world, this is one of the most depressing times. They talk about Christmas and all of its joys and all the rest of it. It's a it's a ranting raving mob out there &gt;&gt; and they're talking about having a wild party and all of these things at Christmas. What a debauchery. &gt;&gt; What a disgrace &gt;&gt; to the very Christ. They seem to uh want to make reference and they use it as an excuse for all of these things. What is the secret? The secret is this. That when you get reduced down to your feelings are going contrary. Circumstances have gone contrary. As far as anything that you might feel is a bright spot, there is no more bright spot. I'm talking about we as individuals arrive there. What is the key? What is the secret? I'll tell you my little secret is this. You need to say what God has said about you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what God has said is truth. &gt;&gt; And if you begin to confess the truth, all I can tell you somewhere along the line, the light's going to shine again. &gt;&gt; It might not be in the next five minutes, but if you begin to say, "This is what God Almighty has said." And I ask myself, do you believe that Jesus is the son of God? Yes, I do. Do you believe that he died for your sins? Yes, I do. And he that believes shall be saved. Yes, I do. I believe that. And I just begin with the basic understanding of that. Do I believe that this supernatural that has come about in this age by his prophet messenger doing things that no human could do? Do you believe it was Jesus Christ just in the last few days? I said, Jesus, none other than you could do that. And he said it was none other than the pillar of fire. And I as I was preparing this message, I said there's been no message, there has been no doctrine that has come across the face of the earth that has been so attested to by a light, a pure light, a glorious light. I never saw the pillar of fire. Other people have. I've been right where it came. I've been in its in in under the impact of its presence. I couldn't deny it. But as far as seeing something with my natural eye, but I can tell you one thing, that pillar of fire did things. I had to believe that because I saw it go out into the audience. I saw that the word of truth. And you find out how many times the prophet said, "Is that true?" &gt;&gt; Raise your hand if that's true. Did they ever fail to raise their hand? No, they raised their hand. Is that the truth? Then you know it's the spirit of truth. If it's the spirit of truth, then the truth can only bring light. &gt;&gt; And once you have light, you know where to walk. Once you have light, you're not in confusion anymore. Once you have light, you're not even in the dusk anymore. You're not just in the dawning of a new day. You're in the light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For the light of this word. &gt;&gt; I thank God for you people that have have come into this light. This isn't light because I say it's light. It's not light because William Brandham said it's light. That's not light. It's light because God made the word work. &gt;&gt; Because God made the scripture manifest. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking now just about blessings. I'm not talking just about healings. All all kinds of people, any kind of people. He even said a prostitute can be healed because faith is a law. &gt;&gt; And if you put the laws of God into practice, you can be healed. You can have all kinds of blessings, but that is not the because you have those blessings doesn't mean you've come into eternal life. &gt;&gt; But eternal life can only come by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Be truthful to yourself. Be truthful about what God said about you. Being born in a barnyard doesn't really matter if you only know. But if you know, you must know that you came from an eagle egg. &gt;&gt; If you've been born in the barnyard and you're not say, well, I maybe came from a chicken egg and then that's a problem. It doesn't matter. We've been born in the barn. Doesn't matter. We've been born in Leodysia. Doesn't matter. is uh &gt;&gt; destitute that &gt;&gt; the generation may be that you've been born in as long as you know your hatch from an eagle's egg. &gt;&gt; Be true to God's word. True in the truth in the pulpit. And that's why it's not always so acceptable because it has to be truth from the pulpit. &gt;&gt; Truth in government. Taking a little bit of a curve just now. We're so accustomed to hearing politics and politicians and the US has their primaries primaries just now and and different ones are stating what they're going to do and and their thoughts whether we should be in Iraq or we shouldn't be in Iraq. Bring the boys home. No, keep them over there. Medicare, this is what we need to do. Everybody's got their plan. And it's not that they that the individual doesn't have good intention, but brother Brandham says it very clearly, the system corrupts them. Even a priest that goes into the priesthood in the Catholic church or a nun that goes into the service of of some area of of of the Catholic church. She may wear the ring married to the church. He said they don't go in to be bad people, &gt;&gt; but the system corrupts them. Even within the realm of the message, we have to be just constantly on the, you know, on our on our toes and be careful. We we don't want a system as such. We just want God amongst us. We want the great shepherd leading us. We want the Holy Spirit on a constant basis. And we can't afford not to have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we need to come into the house of God saying, "I want to be led by the Holy Spirit. I want the shepherd to feed me today. Use the man of God." I don't know if you prayed for myself and Brother Tom's going to preach tonight or the brothers who preach behind the pulpit. We need to pray for them. We need to pray that God will utter his thoughts through them. &gt;&gt; Cause something to become evident, &gt;&gt; something of reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. truth in government and truth in religion. And once the shadows of of untruth or the darkness begins to cloud the truth, it's not long before a person walks in darkness. I think of America as a nation because brother Brandham was raised in that nation and that was God's doing. He spoke on uh uh on a Thanksgiving right after Thanksgiving day. He says, "Tonight I want to say there's so many things that I'm thankful for. I don't know how to give thanks to God for so many blessings. I'm sure we feel that way. He says, ' Tell your children about it. Tell them that this nation was built upon such as that. Our forefathers who fought to bring this freedom and I'm coming now to freedom is light as long as it remains as freedom. Tell them of this freedom that was they fought to bring this freedom to us and left the other country so that they could have freedom of worship and freedom of speech and freedom of press and so forth. And we're thankful yet for it. We don't know how long it will last that way. But I say this long. May our land be bright with freedom's holy light. Protect us by thy might. Great God our king. I thought for many here of other countries and other background probably don't know where brother Brandham got that phrase. It is this poem. It is my country is of thee sweet land of liberty. Of thee I sing, land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims pride. From every mountainside let freedom ring. And the chorus must be a song. Land where my fathers died. Land of the pilgrims pride. From every mountainside let freedom ring. He was quoting from the last verse. Our father's God, to thee, author of liberty, to thee we sing, long may our land be bright with freedom's holy light. Protect us from protect us by thy might. Great God our King. Long may our land be bright with freedom's holy light. Amen. &gt;&gt; True freedom &gt;&gt; is a light. &gt;&gt; Long may our land be bright with freedom's holy light. Protect us by thy might, great God, our king. It's amazing this same prophet would have to come to Jezebel religion. And so this great nation of ours, we come here and on Plymouth Rock, the nation was founded on freedom of religion because our forefathers had fled Roman persecution of the modern Jezebel system and had come up and stood many great persecutions and martyrdom under the false system of Jezebel. And according to the Bible of Revelation the 13th chapter, God had promised them an oasis and a place for the woman was carried away into the wilderness where she was fed for a time, a time and a dividing a time. God had made a promise to America or to the church, to the woman to come into this country. Did you ever put that together? He's pulling out of Revelation 12 and 13 saying God made a promise to this country to find an oasis for her freedom and freedom is light. Freedom opened up the door unfortunately for darkness. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take you right angles just now. There were many nations under communism just in the last few years and they were under the oppression and under dictatorship and under the cruel hand and we over here we felt oh my those poor people and they need our sympathy and they they have almost nothing to live by. They're in such poverty and we are in such abundance. We have so much and they have so little and we have so much freedom and they are they're so restricted they can't move a boat. They can't even go from one place to another and we just get in our car or our train or our our plane and we travel wherever we want and we don't have to have all of these restrictions and freedom finally came and the wall went down between East and West Germany and and nations and uprisings and in Poland and so on and nations and communism fell and oh the light of freedom came but with it came sin. and debauchery &gt;&gt; and immorality until now that's a bigger problem &gt;&gt; than their bondage was and violence &gt;&gt; and criminal activity in Moscow itself has made it an unsafe place a place where we have several three churches just come together and they've called on us to help them build a building they don't have a building to worship in. You talk about poor, they're poor people and they need a building to worship in. And we need to help them. &gt;&gt; We're taking on a lot. That's not why I'm standing here today, but I'm standing here to say, "Oh, freedom is is glorious. Freedom is marvelous. But with the light of freedom and when freedom blasted open the doors in came such sin. I can't help but remember and I just forget which president it was that was in power whether it was President Reagan or an earlier president that was here and when Kruef came over on one visit and may have been more than one visit and you remember he's mentioned in the message as he took his shoe off and pounded it on the table at the United Nations but on that they wanted to show him America and they were going to take him to Las Vegas and show them the can can girls and and show them an evening out. And here one who would be called a dictator from a severe communist country was a rebuke to America and her freedom and refused to go. &gt;&gt; He had no interest in seeing that nakedness. No interest in seeing all that uh sexual uh uh whatever you would call it. Had no interest in it whatsoever. And here God had a leader of a communist country bring a rebuke to a leader of the most powerful nation on earth. Why? Freedom. Freedom has light but freedom also has darkness. &gt;&gt; I hope you can say amen to it. &gt;&gt; In Jubilee year he said God is not a respect of nations. He's not a respect of people. He wants whosoever will and if one nation will bloom and do all of this and stand, that empire will last forever. But he says, "But every world empire will be broken down at the coming of the rock that's hued out of the mountain without hands, and that'll break all the world's kingdoms into pieces. And Christ will rule and reign. and his reign shall be no end. Can the congregation give praise and worship to this one? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And his name shall be called counselor, prince of peace, mighty God, the everlasting father. And the government shall be upon his shoulders and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Hallelujah. For this kingdom of truth. &gt;&gt; We've been born into that kingdom. We live by that kingdom. &gt;&gt; He said that's the kingdom of our God that shall come with power and demonstrations and all the rest of the world will be broken shot to pieces. He says they're going to they're going to reject it. Nations reject it. Churches reject it. Individuals reject it. So that God can judge the nations. He can judge the churches. He can judge the individuals. For a man that comes to the truth and fails to walk in the truth, then he has, according to the scripture, he's blasphemed or rejected the Holy Spirit of God and passed the day of redemption. I tell you my brother, my sister, this generation doesn't really know what they have seen, what they have experienced, and what they have rejected. &gt;&gt; God came with a spirit of truth in the end time. He manifested the word before the eyes of the leaders. It is no secret. It was not done in a corner. This message we talk about a message is not just my word above someone else's word. It's not that. It's God came on the scene, manifested his word year after year before tens and hundreds of thousands and even millions of people so that he could say to this last dying age, I have vindicated and manifested the truth and I have come to lighten the Gentiles, the last generation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A light to lighten the Gentiles. And here they have their Christmas and all of their all of their debauchery and sin. And and with the freedom has come darkness. And with the truth has come darkness. &gt;&gt; Where's no truth in government? Here they are. Here they are even having criminals write the law for you. and binding you to have to live by it. I don't want to get off on that. Freedom also opens the door for the base nature of man. Freedom for every and any lifestyle. The light of holiness and the light of purity and the light of cleanness. Knowledge is light. I have to just move a little bit quicker. My time is has slipped away and I want to close fairly soon. But perhaps I shouldn't go too quick. &gt;&gt; I found this a most compassionate portion. as brother Brandham is describing the age in shalom. So you notice men today, you don't find that genuiness. You don't find it in women. But you notice that women in our day, they don't seem to have that ladylike that they once had. I was just walking with my wife this last week. And you have to you have to forgive me. But I like when I see a a lady to look like a lady and one after the other after the other after the other. You go down through a mall and and they got big sloppy jeans on and their hair just hanging uncamped and and walking in these big lumberjack boots and look like they're going to work. And I said, I can't imagine a man having to go home and meet that as his wife. &gt;&gt; It's the most incredible thing. How do you How do you even Well, if that's all we had, fellas, I'd say I I'd probably give up on marriage, too. But I'm glad there's some ladies in the land. &gt;&gt; And you ladies, I tell you what, you're jewels before that kingdom of God. And you are what you are because there's been truth. &gt;&gt; You have a truth to walk in. You have something that God has made evident. And now here you are evident. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says this. He says to be ladylike that like they once had. He says they want. Now listen to this. They want to, but there's something that won't let them do it. It seems like there's a heaviness. He said, "You tell a lady that she should do such and such a thing and the lady looks upon that and believes that." She wants to believe that, but there's something that presses her. I just want you to catch that, please, that I'm coming to an ending soon. There's something that presses her the other way. He said, see, he said, "Poor thing." He says, you ought to hear him say it. Poor thing. He said, "I feel sorry for her. She's She's so caught up in a web." And I want you to count these. There's about eight or nine of them. She's so caught up in a web of Hollywood and the advertisements and the television and the radio and the newspaper and on the street and in the store windows with the modern dress and so forth. and the way that other women meet her. You you need to write those down. &gt;&gt; They have an effect, young ladies, especially those of you that maybe not so young but conscious about your appearance. And so here we see, you know, moving in and Hollywood has permeated the entire globe. &gt;&gt; Is it light? No, it's darkness. And he's accentuating the woman's body to bring more darkness &gt;&gt; and more sin and more perversion. And it's permeating and making it enticing and and and something desirable and appealing and you know the colors and all of the fashion in the radio and the television and the magazines and the media and all these things bring it before the people dazzling the eyes of the people to bring it down. But it's darkness. It's darkness. And there's a there's a great truth I want to bring to you just before I close. I must bring it to you. There's just waves waves of corruption. I don't know. It might not be in my time and yet it might be. But I see us as a body of believers headed on a collision course &gt;&gt; with the immorality &gt;&gt; and the perversion of this generation because there's laws that are in place and laws that are not only in place but are going to be enforced that's going to go directly opposed to your faith. And at some point in time, you're going to have to stand and stand for truth because truth is light. &gt;&gt; And if you give into it and compromise, remember I will tell you today, if you say compromise, I will just say darkness. &gt;&gt; With compromise comes shadows of night and darkness. And with all of that will come in immorality and all kinds of things. Even if we're swept aside with all the fashions of the world and all the activity of the world, it's not light, friends. It's darkness. &gt;&gt; And even when people hear, they say, "Yes, I know." And the prophet is saying they're caught in it. It's kind of caught in some kind of a web and we feel sorry for them. That is true. We may have a compassion, but we cannot afford to surrender up. &gt;&gt; That's right. our faith in Jesus Christ or surrender up what the word of God has said. &gt;&gt; He said it seems that there's something that they just can't pull away from. And so now here I'm not at the end, but I'm going to close. He said in the message shalom and I just I'm giving a principle now because I want to draw to a close what makes it says rise and shine for your light has come and the second verse and grows darkness upon the people. And I've never heard anyone ever in my entire life approach and actually interpret that. And he says it in a very simple way. He said as gross darkness, I could give you a number of quotes. I haven't got time. This the gross darkness is because the light has come and is pressing the darkness back where it came from &gt;&gt; and I begin to rejoice. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "God is light." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I am light." And he pressed that darkness because the light came and it had to congregate together. And now says, "You are light. You are light." And it had to be it had to be God help me to be able to say it right. It had to be at at this age. It couldn't be at another time. That is why a a ministry of this stature, a ministry of this nature, a message of this magnitude. &gt;&gt; That's true. It is such a it's a message of such magnitude. &gt;&gt; Who's even assemble who who's even assimilated a part of it? None of us. &gt;&gt; It's a mammoth message that has come and nuggets throughout the entire message. &gt;&gt; What does it mean to you when I tell you there's there's about 7 8 900 messages you've never read? &gt;&gt; Falls very silent. &gt;&gt; What's it mean to you? What should it mean to me, Brother Ed? It shouldn't mean to you. Which are they? &gt;&gt; Where are they? &gt;&gt; Where do I get them? How do I lay my hands on them? How do I hear these nuggets? How do I hear these truths that have been sent to me in this day? It might be a there may be a key. There may be a secret right there. I need to read it. I need to allow the Holy Spirit to take that word and make it live within me and give me the power and give me the light that I need. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that really bothered me in the last few months. Not for you, for me. And I'm in the message of every day, but it started to bother me as we started to work on the kiosk and we're working on other things because we want to make we want to make this message available to as much of the world as possible. And there's brothers that are sitting in this in this congregation who've spent hundreds of hours and will probably spend thousands more to get it so that people people anybody who has a and believe me all kinds of people children young people are just young children going to have computers and what and are even today. &gt;&gt; Well, I know there's maybe some here say I don't know how to turn a computer on. Well, that's your fault. &gt;&gt; Well, I I I'm my children aren't going to have it. Well, and that's fine, but they don't have to have it, but but make sure that they get it another way. Don't deprive them of the word. &gt;&gt; And some might say, "Well, only one message is enough." Well, it may be enough if there isn't another one available. &gt;&gt; But another one's available. &gt;&gt; And I see myself, friends, like I'm standing here before you. I I I see myself I think a great deal about crossing over. And I think a great deal about standing before God. &gt;&gt; And as it was that the angel said, "You're gathered with your people." And brother Brandham gathered with the people. And I might be sitting down with somebody around a table just visiting whatever more. But I see myself being looked at and saying, "Uh, what what did you do with what was given you?" You don't know how badly I've said it here before. You don't know how badly I want to say I did what I could. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I did what I could. I lived what you showed me. You ladies that are mothers, you want to be able to say, I did what I could. I instructed my children. I lived before them. I tried to always express and show it was Jesus Christ. I did what I could. What did you do as fathers? It wasn't easy. I worked in places that I'd sooner not been. I worked under the noise, irritating noise of booming music and aggravating situations. But I labored and I lived before them because I needed to bring home food for my family. I brought them to the house of God. made many mistakes, but I lived. And Lord, where I failed, forgive me. But I did what I could. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believed the word that you sent. &gt;&gt; If this isn't God's word, friends, if this message isn't God's word, believe me, I'd be on a search as of this afternoon to find out where it was. We need truth. We need something God has attested to. I would look for it. I mean, I I I see the things that are out there in the world. I read uh just in the last few days, one of the largest, I think the largest church in America, they have tens of thousands of people and a young minister which took over from his father. I think they have around 20 27,000 members and his father was Pentecostal minister and they asked him the interviewer asked him what do you say what he said I just tell the people he said I want them to feel good about themselves there's so much that's negative in the world there's so much that's trouble and negative in the world and I I want I want to tell the people who they are and I want to tell the people uh uh uh to to to look upon themselves and think good about themselves. He said because I don't want to I don't want them to be burdened and want them to be troubled. Well, that that is fine. And I I mean he has to answer for what he's going to preach to his people. But I tell you, I want to be able to tell people something of substance so that when you come to the river, there's a light there for you. &gt;&gt; And that the message is preached with clarity and in simplicity so that you can take it and say this is something we can take into our home and we can live by this and we have some assurance. And I I can say only one thing, friends. We're living by a message. We're preaching a message that God himself supernaturally has vindicated. And when he vindicated, that was a manifestation &gt;&gt; and that was the fulfillment. &gt;&gt; But Simeon's words, a light to lighten the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And with this, just give me a couple more minutes. I find it very very unusual that at this particular time when when when Simeon held that babe in his arms, Rome was the power and the influence that the the people were living under. And even Joseph had to flee to Egypt because they sought the child's life. And here we are at the end of the time. The seventh messenger has come. A vindicated message given before the thousands and tens of thousands. And in the scientific age where the picture could be taken of the pillar of fire and the angel of the Lord and then God would put it into the hearts of the people to propagate it so that millions more can hear and see about it. A message a a message that came with such vindication. And the vindication was always light. That meant something to me. It's light here, light there, light. It's all milky white. It's light. So, the message has come accompanied with light. And it came in America. When that messenger was raised and when the prophet of God was raised up in America, America wasn't the singular superpower of the earth. But as the message progressed and began to spread and churches and people began to be believers of it, America also became the single great superpower of the earth. But as the scripture said, listen close now. As the scripture said and the prophet of God pointed to the 13th chapter of Revelation said America is in there. &gt;&gt; That is her chapter and she was like a lamb but spoke as the dragon &gt;&gt; and the dragon is always Rome. He spoke like the dragon. I happen to have the sequence here of how the Vatican made agreements with uh Mr. Arafat for the holy places because they wanted to encourage that these people of Palestinians shall have a state and within that state will be Bethlehem. Within that state will be Hebron. Within that state will be Jericho. Within that state, that state will encompass Judea and Samaria, which is actually part of the kingdoms of Israel. And they made an agreement. And so the Vatican threw all their weight behind it, and begin to call and do their diplomacy a state for the Palestinian people. And at that time, America was not saying those words. But as time went on and darkness began to invade more into the nations of freedom, &gt;&gt; into the nations of of liberty, in the nations of wealth and the people who have influence in the world and because of the influence of the western civilization and their freedom and their liberty, other places and other nations of such a uh such dictatorship and control under such a cruel man had begun to break apart. God even knew that. And those nations would look and say they craved they craved the wealth of America. They craved the freedom of America. They crave this kind of thing. And they opened their doors and in came Hollywood. And in came the sin. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And in came the darkness. &gt;&gt; Not only the light, but the darkness came in. And it seemed that the darkness came in much faster. They don't have the total freedom of worship and the total freedom of the gospel. But the darkness came in. And then here we come right to this end time. And here we are. And in the last few days, America is making one more attempt. Condisa Rice, who is the the most powerful diplomat in the world, was interviewed a few days ago by the British uh British Broadcasting Corporation from England, the BBC, and said, "You are uh you are making another attempt, and this seems to have it be a priority. Is this very very important?" Yes, she said, "This is very important. It's not the only priority. I've got Korea to think about and I have Iraq to think about and I have Iran to think about. But yes, this is this is a this is a priority that the Palestinians have a state. So really, let's put it in Bible language. This is a priority of our country that we give away some of the land. And God said to Abraham, "This is my covenant." &gt;&gt; Can this congregation say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; God said to Abraham, "This is my covenant. This land is for you and your seed after you." Amen. &gt;&gt; And now here we are down uh in a nation that has received a prophet, vindicated prophet whose cities have been visitated by the spirit of truth and light. Light has come to lighten the Gentiles. But in the midst of that is the deepest of darkness upon the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the greatest leader, the most powerful leader on earth is bringing those two together. Bringing the leader of Israel, not elected, but a leader of Israel and the prime minister and the leader of the Palestinian people to make one more attempt. They've tried it at Oslo. They've tried it at Camp David. And now they try it once again. and and and getting a commitment from them that this can happen by 208 or at least during 208 this will happen. I wonder friends really what is going to cause God to move. But I think that when man begins to take God's word and carve it up because we need oil and we got to keep friends with those people or because we need a military uh logistical place, a strategic place. We need this for our military power. We need this for one reason or for another. And and and we're sitting here waiting for the rapture. I believe that great events are in the offing very very near whenever it it scares me when I see man take a hold of not nations they can do what they want with nations but when they take a hold of God's word when God says this is my covenant with you I've given you this land and a man takes a hold of it and says we're going to divide it up we're going to divide it up we're a superpower we're the head we're going to divide it up and and actually is saying what the dragon has said, &gt;&gt; but they don't know that while they're pushing for this, they're actually pushing. They're actually introducing the desire of the harlot church. &gt;&gt; The church wants all of those sacred places and they know they're already a commitment to receive them with this kind of a with this kind of an arrangement. And so now the scripture is being fulfilled right in front of us as we sit here. This been happening in the last two weeks. &gt;&gt; This Bible is more important and more up to date than tomorrow morning's newspaper. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And that is gross darkness upon the people. I say that to say to you how you ought to appreciate the light that God has given us to walk in. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my message to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's thank him. &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll walk in the light. It's a glorious light. Come where the dew drops from heaven are bright. Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul. Hallelujah. Let's not conclude as a Sunday morning service. Let's say thank God for the word that we have received. Thank God for the message that he has sent us. Uh what a wonderful thing to be able to say to you young men and young ladies. Oh, you've got a bright future, but it's not in this world. You got a bright future that lays before you. Walk in the truth. We'll walk in the light as the glorious light. We'll walk in the light. [Music] our shine all around us by Jesus the light of the world. We walking such a beauty [Music] shine all around my Jesus light of the I I want to sing just a couple verses of the song down from his glory to close this service today. Ever living story. It hasn't gotten stale, has it? I hope you didn't mind the kind of heavy message this morning, but I think it would be I I I I feel it's our responsibility as ministers and especially myself to bring before the congregation something that you need to think about. You need to ponder. You need to pray about and go out of here and say, "Thank God we're not walking in some shadows." Amen. &gt;&gt; God's always been concerned about the nations. &gt;&gt; Even the birth of Jesus Christ has all to do about the nations. A light to lighten the Gentiles. [Music] Are we Gentiles? Yes. You look around you and you see at this even at this Christmas time when people are supposed to be uh uh I would say at a at a higher spiritual level go look around you take take my title a light to lighten the Gentiles turn on the radio turn on carrier turn on some place and you listen to one then listen to the next one see what the newspapers carry about this season and just say yourself. I want you to ask yourself, go ahead. I'm going to ask you to do it. Go ahead. Ask yourself, is this light? Is this light? A light to light in the gentile. Where are we? &gt;&gt; Is this light? And you'll have to say, "No, it's I can't walk in that. It's not light." Say, "Where is the light?" Thank God for light &gt;&gt; to lighten the Gentiles [Music] glory ever living. lifted up to him.
