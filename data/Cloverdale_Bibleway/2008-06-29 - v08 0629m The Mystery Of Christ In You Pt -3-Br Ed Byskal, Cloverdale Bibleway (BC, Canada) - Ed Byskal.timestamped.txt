[6:11] Thank you, Lord Jesus. So, your desire
[6:14] this morning, saints, for him to come
[6:15] and dwell.
[6:19] 1 John 3:21.
[6:21] If our hearts condemn us not, then we
[6:23] have confidence in God.
[6:26] And brother Brandham said that's what's
[6:28] the matter today with the Christian
[6:29] church can't get anything done is
[6:32] because our hearts are condemning us
[6:34] with unconfessed sins. You know, the
[6:37] Bible says if we confess our sins, he is
[6:39] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[6:43] and to cleanse us from all
[6:45] unrighteousness.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Men, we've all sinned, saints. We've
[6:48] come short of the glory of God. But I'm
[6:50] thankful that there's a sacrifice. Man,
[6:53] the mercy seat is available this morning
[6:55] to every believer.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; So if your heart's condemning you this
[6:59] morning, it doesn't have to in a just an
[7:02] instant of time. All you have to do is
[7:04] say, "Father, forgive me." Amen. And
[7:06] let's sing this morning number 5:18.
[7:09] Nothing between is my prayer this
[7:12] morning. Lord, I want to have nothing in
[7:15] between my soul and the savior. Maybe a
[7:17] brother did you wrong this week.
[7:19] Man, maybe somebody may be here in the
[7:22] church. All you have to do is just say,
[7:23] "Lord, I forgive them. Don't want to
[7:26] have anything between you and me this
[7:28] morning. Lord, I want to receive what
[7:30] you have for me." Amen. in this service
[7:34] today.
[7:37] Nothing
[7:39] between
[7:41] my soul and the savior.
[7:46] Not of this world
[7:50] delusive
[7:52] dream.
[7:54] I have renounced
[7:58] all sinful
[8:00] pleasure.
[8:02] Jesus is mine. There's nothing between
[8:10] nothing
[8:12] between
[8:14] my soul and the savior
[8:18] so that his blessed
[8:22] face may be seen.
[8:26] I
[8:28] preventing
[8:30] the least of his favor.
[8:38] There nothing bee
[8:41] will nothing between
[8:46] my world
[8:48] pleasure
[8:51] of life
[8:53] for heartless
[8:56] see
[8:59] my heart.
[9:06] He is my all. There's nothing
[9:11] between
[9:13] nothing.
[9:17] My soul and myior
[9:22] [Music]
[9:23] blessing
[9:25] may be
[9:29] nothing
[9:31] [Music]
[9:34] of his
[9:38] way.
[9:41] And nothing between
[9:45] nothing between
[9:48] like bride
[9:50] or station
[9:53] self or friends shall not
[9:59] [Music]
[10:03] cost me much.
[10:09] I am all there's nothing
[10:16] nothing
[10:19] between my soul and the savior
[10:24] so that his blessed
[10:28] face may be
[10:32] Nothing
[10:33] preventing
[10:36] the least of his favor.
[10:40] Keep the way
[10:43] you let nothing be.
[10:48] Nothing be
[10:51] in any heart.

[11:07] and myself

[11:57] [Music]

[23:27] Thank you, Lord, for your redeeming love
[23:29] that's been expressed to the likes of
[23:32] us. Lord,
[23:34] you're scouring the world, but God, you

[23:39] redeemed by a love divine. We want to
[23:42] give you praise this morning, thanking

[24:25] we love you.
[24:27] We're thankful for a messenger that has
[24:29] come and a message. Lord, we sing about
[24:32] Moses and a token was given, but we

[24:39] the token of the hour. We thank you for
[24:41] the Holy Ghost. We thank you for the
[24:44] protection, Lord God. We see spiritual
[24:47] death throughout the land. But in the

[24:52] abundant life, Holy Ghost life. Lord,
[24:56] redeem the lost this morning. Set the
[25:00] captive free by your word. If there's
[25:03] any backslider, Lord, restore them to
[25:06] their position in Jesus Christ. Father,
[25:10] for the requests that were read, and
[25:12] hearts that are lifted, hands reaching
[25:15] out to you in faith. Would you meet
[25:17] every need in divine presence? We're
[25:21] asking you'll anoint the man of God that
[25:23] you'll anoint our eyes with eyes to have
[25:26] to see. We just don't want to hear
[25:28] words, Lord, but we want those words to
[25:31] become living
[25:33] &gt;&gt; in our own flesh.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Let that word become flesh again.
[25:38] Father, bless Brother Rod as he leads
[25:40] the people in worship.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; We love worship, Lord. We love to praise
[25:44] that name. We love to lift it up. We

[42:50] Praise the Lord.
[42:53] Well, we'll just have you have your
[42:55] seats for a moment.
[42:59] [Music]
[43:01] We're really thankful for each of you
[43:04] that are here and the visible audience,
[43:07] the invisible audience, those that are
[43:09] in the fellowship room and elsewhere
[43:12] nursery and wherever they are in the
[43:13] building and those that are streaming.
[43:16] We want to greet you all in the name of
[43:18] the Lord Jesus Christ. We're so
[43:21] privileged, aren't we? Amen.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; We're honored
[43:26] to have been called,
[43:28] &gt;&gt; to have been justified.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; To be glorified.
[43:33] Amen.
[43:35] We're real thankful that the Lord gave a
[43:38] safe journey to brother Michael, brother
[43:40] Kim. Happy to have them back after a
[43:43] long and in Kim's word arduous journey.
[43:48] Long journey.
[43:50] And of course these types of trips are
[43:53] not it's not just the length of the trip
[43:55] but it's what happens during the
[43:58] journey.
[44:00] And uh I would like uh Lord willing on
[44:04] Wednesday if it would be possible
[44:05] brother Kim to let the people know
[44:08] really what took place in this last
[44:10] couple weeks. It was very very
[44:13] profitable journey. I heard from
[44:16] brother Vernon and brother Vernon
[44:20] said it was just he said it's actually
[44:23] started a little revival over there and
[44:26] I won't say too much but only to say
[44:29] that uh between brother Kim and brother
[44:32] Michael
[44:34] who was doing a lot of video work and we
[44:36] want to be able to have a a real good
[44:40] account
[44:42] and uh more than an account But how the
[44:45] men and the brethren were taught, how
[44:47] the ministers were uh taking a hold of
[44:51] the whole concept of the hub. And they
[44:54] they trained some of these men and quite
[44:56] a few ministers, had them sit down, each
[44:59] one after their computers, and the
[45:01] printers were all put into into
[45:04] alignment as it were, pulled down a
[45:07] message.
[45:09] Uh, and I'm just going to mention a
[45:10] couple things if you don't mind, brother
[45:12] Kim, but pulled down a message on the
[45:15] internet. And this one brother printed a
[45:18] message from an earlier message that he
[45:20] had wanted and held it. And they printed
[45:23] it, stapled it, and brought it out as a
[45:26] book. And this one pastor said, "This is
[45:30] such a rare message." Well, because he
[45:33] hadn't had it before.
[45:35] And uh
[45:37] then some of the young men that were in
[45:39] their late teens, early 20s,
[45:42] they were so quick to pick up on this uh
[45:46] the technology part and they were able
[45:48] to go back to their churches on Sunday
[45:50] and help their pastors and they felt as
[45:53] though they had really gained a position
[45:54] in the church. Now they had uh were a
[45:57] place where they were able to be an
[45:59] assistant to their pastors and that gave
[46:01] them a thrill. I'm telling you this
[46:04] because I wanted to just relate
[46:05] something that I experienced. I had just
[46:09] gotten uh an email from Brother Kim
[46:13] and they were just finishing up in I
[46:15] believe in Manila and were on their way
[46:17] up to Baguio City along about a 12-hour
[46:21] drive and uh
[46:24] and I had just finished preaching here
[46:27] on uh Christ the mystery of God revealed
[46:31] and I get an email from a pastor who's
[46:34] been emailing me on a regular basis for
[46:36] quite some time from Argentina. I
[46:39] believe it's Argentina or Chile.
[46:41] And he does a lot of evangelistic
[46:44] evangelism work. He pastors a church and
[46:48] uh he's very very well connected also on
[46:51] the internet and and uh he sent me an
[46:55] email and this was the first email of
[46:57] this particular type. Usually he's
[46:59] talking about what God is doing and
[47:01] where they're going and where they're
[47:03] taking the taking the message to.
[47:06] But in this email, he said,
[47:09] "You you mentioned in the service on
[47:13] Sunday, you mentioned and made a quote
[47:16] that God loved fatherhood."
[47:19] And he said, "I where is that quote? I'm
[47:22] trying to find that quote and I can't
[47:25] find it."
[47:27] And so I immediately took and pasted the
[47:31] a couple of paragraphs out of Christ the
[47:33] mystery of God revealed and sent it to
[47:36] him on the internet.
[47:38] And it was about 30 minutes after I
[47:40] spoke to you, brother Kim.
[47:43] And here came uh here came this email
[47:46] from this brother and he said
[47:49] uh thank you for sending the quotes. He
[47:52] said this will help with a lot of false
[47:56] doctrine in the country.
[47:58] He said it's such a wonderful quote that
[48:01] God loved fatherhood.
[48:03] He said we don't have Christ as the
[48:05] mystery of God revealed in our country.
[48:09] And he said, and I don't think we have
[48:11] it in many of the Spanish-speaking
[48:13] countries. It is translated into
[48:15] Spanish, but it has not been printed
[48:19] and would cost us about $640
[48:22] US to print a,000.
[48:26] And we could print 2,000 for a little
[48:28] bit less per book and 3,000 for a little
[48:30] bit less than 2,000.
[48:34] And I I just looked at what it would
[48:36] cost to print the one book, just 1,000
[48:38] copies of that book. And I thought,
[48:41] isn't it ironic that right at this very
[48:44] moment, here's a brothers on another
[48:46] part of the world giving access to the
[48:50] pastors to the whole message and here's
[48:52] one brother trying to get one book. And
[48:55] all he needs is to get that one printer
[48:58] tie into the hub and he'll have access
[49:00] to all of it. Uh, we're on the right
[49:02] track, brother Tony.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; We're on the right track, sir. And here
[49:07] we have these brothers that have just
[49:08] gone over on the first first occasion.
[49:11] We're we're going to the Philippines. So
[49:12] it'll be kind of a a model a model
[49:15] country. And the Philippines was chosen.
[49:18] They have a lot of English-speaking
[49:20] people in the country. And now the next
[49:23] country we desire to move on to is to uh
[49:27] India. But already we're getting emails.
[49:31] They're sending them to me. I don't know
[49:32] what the office brother Derek or other
[49:34] brothers are getting. But already we're
[49:37] getting word and they're just absolutely
[49:40] so thrilled and not only that people are
[49:44] getting under the burden and saying I
[49:46] will I want to see that a printer gets
[49:48] into a certain country. I just got an
[49:50] email like that from Africa
[49:53] and they want to and from a part that
[49:55] you might think is a needy part but they
[49:57] want to provide a printing station for
[49:59] someplace else. I really think this
[50:02] probably one of the most revolutionary
[50:03] things that's happened since the tape
[50:05] recorder and and I might make some
[50:08] reference to it and I'd like to hear
[50:10] really fully what while it's fresh if
[50:12] it's possible brother Kim for Wednesday
[50:15] if it would be possible and just show
[50:17] the people if you're going to be around.
[50:18] I don't know we talk about it after. So
[50:21] we're happy to have brothers back
[50:23] safely.
[50:25] Uh, brother Rod has mentioned on on next
[50:28] Saturday, July the 5th, we're going to
[50:29] have the camp fellowship day. Uh, the
[50:31] one thing that he didn't mention which
[50:33] is especially important, especially to a
[50:35] lot all our young people, that's it's
[50:36] also barbecue
[50:38] and we got brother Raymond out there and
[50:40] he's going to be preparing food and and
[50:43] so on. So, we want you to be able to
[50:45] come. It's it is a day if the young
[50:47] people wish to put up some volleyball
[50:49] nets, that's perfectly fine on the on
[50:51] the grounds there. uh bring your guitars
[50:54] and have some singing and whatever more.
[50:57] But we have some uh tour guides. Our
[51:01] senior young men are going to be tour
[51:03] guides. And these aren't just tour
[51:06] guides to show you the grounds. They're
[51:08] going to tell you in detail what has
[51:10] taken place and where it has happened
[51:13] and and not only what has happened, what
[51:15] has taken place in the last 6, eight
[51:17] months under the direction of brother uh
[51:19] Chris Peterson and brother Randy Snow
[51:22] and they're going to give the details
[51:25] and then these tour guides will be able
[51:26] to take groups of maybe 15 20 at a time
[51:29] and take you all through the whole whole
[51:31] area in the premises and show you the
[51:34] different things and also to show you uh
[51:36] what we would like to still see take
[51:39] place. So, uh we're really happy about
[51:42] those things.
[51:44] You know, little things happen that you
[51:46] don't really expect. Uh I was just there
[51:50] one of the earlier times and and Sister
[51:53] Sue Aguary was there and I don't know
[51:54] exactly what she was doing there, but
[51:56] she was helping in the kitchen and
[51:58] working around and stopped me in the
[52:00] middle of the kitchen. And I tell you
[52:01] what, it has to be important to stop me
[52:02] when we're in the middle of eating. But
[52:04] she she has something really important.
[52:07] She says, "Brother Ed, I'd like to grow
[52:09] a garden."
[52:11] This is I said, "Kind of, you know, kind
[52:13] of what planet did that come from? I'm
[52:15] just we're we're there with all this
[52:17] tearing this camp to pieces and trying
[52:20] to do do some work and workmen going
[52:22] every direction and and just trying to
[52:24] feed them and get them energized so they
[52:26] can carry on for the afternoon." Says,
[52:27] "I'd like to grow a garden." Okay. I I I
[52:31] suppose there's a spot. I didn't even
[52:33] know there was a place. Oh, yeah. She
[52:35] said they used to have a garden here.
[52:36] And I'd like to have an organic garden.
[52:38] Sounding better all the time. You you
[52:40] know, God bless you, Sister Sue. Just go
[52:43] right to it, you know. Well, she she the
[52:45] seeds were sewn in her mind. She got
[52:47] energized by the thing. But here are
[52:49] some other, you know, brother Chris and
[52:51] he he got bit by it, too. And brother
[52:53] John Le and some of the other brothers.
[52:55] And so I talked about the garden the
[52:57] other day. He says, "I don't hardly have
[52:58] anything to do with it. They've all
[52:59] taken it over." Well, they need to. It's
[53:03] it's it's huge. It's huge. There's
[53:05] enough there to feed the whole camp. I
[53:07] think just think of it. You're not only
[53:09] going to go have camp this year. And uh
[53:13] Lord willing, what we're trying to do
[53:14] also, I just tell you these things a
[53:16] little bit ahead time because the camp's
[53:18] not far away. We're trying to get it
[53:20] opened up to see if we can have two
[53:23] sittings uh for evening meal because
[53:25] some of you may want to come and it'll
[53:28] be the first time we've ever been able
[53:29] to do it. But some and we'll be
[53:31] announcing it formally if we get get it
[53:33] worked out and I think we will where the
[53:36] where you can come early to the camp and
[53:38] and and sit down and have a have a have
[53:41] a dinner there and and then be right
[53:44] there to early to have take in the
[53:46] service. And I think that would be real
[53:48] nice. We build a great big deck that
[53:50] probably hold 300 of you. And uh if it
[53:54] gets too hot where you can just buy an
[53:56] umbrella when you leave, leave the
[53:58] umbrella there.
[54:00] Isn't that it? But brother Chris, too,
[54:02] please. Table and umbrella.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah, table and an umbrella. See, that's
[54:08] the kind of man you need.
[54:11] God bless you. Well, we're here to
[54:14] uh come to the word in a few moments
[54:17] and uh I have something I want to I
[54:20] would like to continue where I have been
[54:22] for the last two weeks. Uh the mystery
[54:25] of Christ in you
[54:28] and it is very very true.
[54:31] Uh sometime we have a hard time seeing
[54:34] God in our life the way that we should
[54:37] and sometimes things in our lives go
[54:39] sideways.
[54:41] go in reverse
[54:44] but we don't realize that actually it's
[54:46] God in our life we really need to know
[54:50] whether it's God and I remember very
[54:53] vividly when Tom preached some years ago
[54:57] you know why do we go through bad things
[54:59] but he he coined the phrase which became
[55:03] used in this congregation ever since who
[55:07] says it's bad
[55:09] and he pointed to a lot of bad things
[55:11] that happened to people in the Bible,
[55:13] but it turned out for their benefit. So,
[55:16] who said it's bad? They didn't realize
[55:18] it was Christ in them, God working out
[55:22] something in their lives. And so, that's
[55:26] uh that's what I would like to speak
[55:27] about. I'll have you speak and I'll have
[55:30] you stand before I speak. And I'd like
[55:32] to sing that course. Uh I have it
[55:37] written down here, Linda. I want to live
[55:39] the way he wants me to live. And and
[55:42] I've been thinking about the words this
[55:44] course. I would like you to be mindful
[55:45] of it. I want to live the way he wants
[55:49] me to live. That's in line with the
[55:51] service.
[55:53] I want to love till there is no more
[55:56] love. Amen. Let's sing it as a prayer,
[56:00] shall we?
[56:03] I want to live
[56:07] the way
[56:09] he wants me to live. I want to give
[56:17] until there's just no more to give. I
[56:24] want you
[56:28] [Music]
[56:30] just know more
[56:33] for I could never
[56:36] ever out love the Lord.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Let's just quieten our spirits as we
[56:42] sing it again.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; I want to live
[56:46] the way
[56:48] he wants me to.
[56:53] I want to give
[56:56] until there's just no more to give. I
[57:03] want to love
[57:05] [Music]
[57:07] until there's just no more love. For I
[57:13] could never
[57:15] ever out love
[57:18] the Lord.
[57:21] with our heads bowed and our hearts
[57:23] bowed.
[57:24] Our lovely Lord Jesus,
[57:28] thinking about your love and the depth
[57:30] of it, trying to understand it, trying
[57:34] to comprehend it, and feeling, Lord,
[57:36] even myself this morning so incapable of
[57:40] grasping the depth of it. But I pray
[57:42] that you'll open up our hearts and our
[57:45] souls, Lord, that we may have a deeper,
[57:48] deeper understanding and that we in
[57:50] simple language just may be drawn closer
[57:52] to God. Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer,
[57:56] oh Lord, to thy blessed bleeding side.
[58:00] Consecrate us now, Lord, to your
[58:02] service. I pray. I ask you'll illuminate
[58:05] us by the same Holy Spirit that came on
[58:08] the day of Pentecost and rested tongues
[58:11] of fire upon them. I pray that that Holy
[58:14] Spirit will have the preeminence in the
[58:17] service today Lord and not merely in the
[58:20] service but in our lives. Take us,
[58:22] Father, use us for your glory. No flesh
[58:26] will glory in your presence. And now
[58:29] father I pray that you will make this
[58:31] word alive to us and give ability to
[58:35] speak Lord may my utterance be
[58:39] done and motivated by the Holy Spirit
[58:42] and may it seed fall into good ground I
[58:44] pray in the name of Jesus Christ for
[58:47] your glory. Amen. Amen.
[58:50] I'll have you turn in your Bibles to 2
[58:52] Corinthians uh 5th chapter.
[58:58] We're just going to read verse 19 and
[59:00] then we're going to go on to Colossians
[59:03] 1. We've been reading these uh verses
[59:06] here
[59:10] and then I have some other scripture
[59:12] reading. So you'll hold your Bible open
[59:14] if you would please. in 2 Corinthians
[59:17] 5:19 to
[59:20] that God was in Christ
[59:24] reconciling the world unto himself
[59:27] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[59:31] and hath committed unto us the word of
[59:34] reconciliation
[59:36] in Colossians the first chapter and
[59:40] we'll start at verse 25 we had read from
[59:43] about verse 18 but now we'll just Start
[59:47] for verse 25 to 27. wareof the apostle
[59:50] Paul speaking. I am made a minister
[59:53] according to the dispensation of God
[59:56] which is given to you given to me for
[59:59] you to fulfill the word of God. Even the
[1:00:04] mystery which has been hid from ages and
[1:00:07] from generations and now is made
[1:00:10] manifest to his saints. to whom God
[1:00:14] would make known what is the riches of
[1:00:16] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:00:20] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[1:00:23] of glory. Now you know this scripture is
[1:00:27] very very common and very much used very
[1:00:31] much believed on by all Christianity
[1:00:35] but I can I can say of with confidence
[1:00:38] that without the message you can't
[1:00:40] really grasp the depths of this and even
[1:00:43] with the message it's hard to grasp the
[1:00:45] depths but Christ in you and soon as I
[1:00:48] hear that I say to myself then what is
[1:00:51] this Christ what is this force what Is
[1:00:54] this power and how is it transmitted to
[1:00:57] me from almighty God? And that's what
[1:01:00] we've been going through. This is the
[1:01:02] logos that came out from God. This is
[1:01:04] what proceeded out from God which was
[1:01:07] the son of God. He called it. He said
[1:01:09] it's the Christ. It's the anointing.
[1:01:12] It's that it's that which came out from
[1:01:14] the being of God. And the that's why in
[1:01:17] the beginning all things were made by
[1:01:19] him and without him was not anything
[1:01:21] made that was made. the beginning of the
[1:01:23] new creation, our Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:01:26] so, uh, this is the part of this great
[1:01:29] mystery of Christ in you, the hope of
[1:01:31] glory. You may have your seats. Keep
[1:01:34] your Bibles open, please.
[1:01:37] So, God was in Christ
[1:01:40] and Christ
[1:01:42] is in you.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; We never want to forget those phrases.
[1:01:47] God was in Christ and Christ is in you.
[1:01:51] This is God's process. This is God's
[1:01:55] method. This is what God chose. How he
[1:01:59] chose to transmit and transfer actually
[1:02:03] the prophet says part of himself
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; to you. Now the next thing is that's
[1:02:10] wonderful and that's all marvelous but
[1:02:13] the next thing for us is to be so so
[1:02:15] very very sensitive and we do need to be
[1:02:19] filled with the same spirit of God
[1:02:22] because that is the spirit that he sent
[1:02:24] out from himself. We need to be filled
[1:02:26] with the spirit of God so we can
[1:02:28] identify that that indeed is God. And
[1:02:31] then something that we might think is
[1:02:33] God isn't God. We need to have that
[1:02:35] discernment of the Holy Spirit that we
[1:02:38] might know this is of God. I am I am
[1:02:41] I've given myself so unreservedly to the
[1:02:44] Lord. I'm I'm completely unbiased in my
[1:02:47] thought. I I've I'm in neutral.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; I'm in neutral about the things of life.
[1:02:52] I'm not, you know, yearning for this or
[1:02:54] longing for that or whatever more which
[1:02:56] may taint my decision making and the
[1:02:59] power of my judgment. I want to just be
[1:03:03] completely and neutral about these
[1:03:05] things because the reason I say that is
[1:03:07] we're always facing decisions. There
[1:03:10] isn't a day that you don't face
[1:03:12] decisions. Some of them are much more
[1:03:15] important. They're major decisions.
[1:03:17] They're lifechanging decisions and
[1:03:20] others are just, you know, about our
[1:03:21] daily life and so on. But even then, we
[1:03:24] need to know that God is directing our
[1:03:27] decisions and our footsteps and our our
[1:03:29] future. So God in Christ and Christ in
[1:03:34] you. And that ties back to the phrase
[1:03:36] brother Brandham uses. All that was in
[1:03:38] God, he poured into Christ. All that was
[1:03:41] in Christ, he poured into the church.
[1:03:43] Now when th those aren't only profound
[1:03:46] statements, they're very very
[1:03:48] farreaching
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; because it it it spans over our
[1:03:55] feelings.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; However you feel, you may feel great
[1:03:59] today. You may feel very bad today. You
[1:04:02] may feel depressed one time. You may
[1:04:05] feel fearful another time. You may feel
[1:04:08] in confusion some time. But this these
[1:04:12] statements span over top of those. God,
[1:04:16] everything God was, he poured into
[1:04:18] Christ. Everything Christ was, he poured
[1:04:20] into the church. Regardless of how you
[1:04:23] feel or what kind of a day you have,
[1:04:25] that's irrelevant.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Completely irrelevant to God. It's still
[1:04:29] the same. God poured himself into. He
[1:04:33] poured himself. And that's what
[1:04:34] anointing actually is. And that's why
[1:04:36] they say the outpouring of the Holy
[1:04:39] Ghost. The outpouring has a direct
[1:04:41] reference. And you might say, well, uh,
[1:04:43] you know, you might remember I spoke on
[1:04:45] the anointing and and these things tied
[1:04:47] very very much together. You can't you
[1:04:49] can't really uh d you know, you can't
[1:04:52] dissect these these uh statements in
[1:04:55] these scriptures because they are all
[1:04:56] interlocked. And so God in Christ and
[1:04:59] Christ in you is the chosen
[1:05:03] combination that God is using to bring
[1:05:08] about his plan of redemption. That's the
[1:05:11] plan.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; That's what he's using. And this is the
[1:05:15] central theme throughout the whole
[1:05:18] scripture. It's a central theme
[1:05:20] throughout the message. It's a central
[1:05:22] theme throughout the Bible. And this is
[1:05:25] the purpose. This is the purpose
[1:05:30] that God has you in the world.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; And I want to just uh make a reference
[1:05:38] to the purpose in just a couple moments.
[1:05:40] But in this message, Christ is the
[1:05:42] mystery of God revealed. I'll be making
[1:05:44] some quotes, also showing some slides of
[1:05:46] the scriptures and quotes that I have uh
[1:05:49] in a few moments. But but here here it
[1:05:52] is.
[1:05:54] First,
[1:05:56] he said there's a three-fold purpose.
[1:05:58] First, to express himself completely.
[1:06:04] Now, I I just want to confess to you
[1:06:06] that I haven't gotten much further than
[1:06:09] this in my thoughts
[1:06:11] over the last weeks.
[1:06:14] I've been really pondering
[1:06:16] that God
[1:06:18] the thing that he was the words don't
[1:06:22] fit you know words that are that we
[1:06:23] would use with ourselves don't really
[1:06:25] fit for him but we became obs we become
[1:06:28] obsessed with something uh but I I don't
[1:06:31] want to use that word with God but the
[1:06:32] thing that that God was uh I would say
[1:06:37] completely
[1:06:39] uh uh complete his his whole nature and
[1:06:42] his whole being was one of
[1:06:44] self-expression and brother Brown said
[1:06:47] that's first and he said it was in the
[1:06:49] back part of his mind
[1:06:51] and and you have to understand that this
[1:06:54] was such a a force within God if you can
[1:06:59] see this it's like life that had to
[1:07:01] burst forth
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; it just had to burst forth and the
[1:07:06] profusion of life
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; the magnitude it's somewhat expressed in
[1:07:11] the in the species of life, the species
[1:07:14] of the earth, they they say, and I have
[1:07:17] some statistics here, whether they're
[1:07:19] right or wrong, and when I get into
[1:07:21] scientific statistics, I always get a
[1:07:23] little bit skeptical. But nevertheless,
[1:07:26] they say that uh that from the beginning
[1:07:29] of of their recorded or or recorded
[1:07:33] scientific research on the various
[1:07:35] species, they say that there's that we
[1:07:39] only have uh 99.9%
[1:07:43] of all living species have are in are
[1:07:46] extinct. And they're going back like 360
[1:07:50] million years, way back to the various
[1:07:53] eras. uh and and how the how the species
[1:07:57] have become extinct of and the dinosaurs
[1:08:00] and all of those things that have been
[1:08:02] in in some previous time. And uh and I
[1:08:06] don't even get into that. That's not why
[1:08:08] I'm here. But all of this life, it
[1:08:11] seemed that when and I thought of the
[1:08:13] scripture. It's just so short and yet
[1:08:16] it's so profound, so a few words.
[1:08:20] In the beginning was the word and the
[1:08:22] word was with God and the word was God.
[1:08:25] Says in him was life.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; And we can just stop there and preach
[1:08:30] the rest of the service.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; In him was life. In him was every little
[1:08:37] bug and
[1:08:39] bird and flower and the colors of the
[1:08:43] flower and the odors of the flowers and
[1:08:46] the the fragrance and all of the things.
[1:08:49] In him was the waters. In him was every
[1:08:52] living creature. In him was all of the
[1:08:56] fascination of nature. No wonder the
[1:08:59] prophet can say God in his creation.
[1:09:02] Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; And people can see that people are are
[1:09:06] captivated by it. They're overcome by
[1:09:09] it. Their their emotions well up. They
[1:09:11] look at beautiful sunsets or rainbows or
[1:09:14] storms or or the mountains or whatever
[1:09:17] more and sit there and stand there and
[1:09:19] weep with tears coming down. They're
[1:09:21] moved by seeing God in creation even
[1:09:23] though they don't know the creator
[1:09:25] perhaps themselves. But they see the
[1:09:27] manifestation.
[1:09:30] They'll see the they'll they'll see the
[1:09:33] the the salmon heading up and they see
[1:09:35] that force of of of life within them
[1:09:39] that they must get back to their birth
[1:09:41] place and they I watch them and they're
[1:09:44] beating their bodies and and it's it's
[1:09:46] actually sad where they put them in and
[1:09:49] and let their eggs ripen in one of the
[1:09:51] places where they want to wait till
[1:09:54] their salmon are ready to give their
[1:09:56] eggs and those salmon know that they
[1:09:58] need to go further. They're up the river
[1:10:01] and they're in a cage as it were and
[1:10:03] they'll go back there and it is
[1:10:05] something to see 30, 40, 50, 60 lb
[1:10:08] salmon stand there and and they've
[1:10:10] already failed. They've already failed
[1:10:12] many, many times because it's just a
[1:10:14] wall up there and they'll go back in
[1:10:17] this tank and and you can just see that
[1:10:20] determination. They're moving there and
[1:10:21] then they'll just take a run. They must
[1:10:24] be going 50, 60 m an hour and slap their
[1:10:27] body up against that thing. They're just
[1:10:29] trying to break through. Something in
[1:10:31] them has to get home.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if that can be in a
[1:10:36] salmon, how much more in a believer? We
[1:10:40] run up against a snag. We run up against
[1:10:42] a blockade. We run up against a stone
[1:10:45] wall. We run up against a waterfall. But
[1:10:47] nothing's going to stop the bride of
[1:10:49] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; But God was in him.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; In him was life. In him was that force.
[1:10:58] In him was that drive. In him was all of
[1:11:00] that magnificence.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Because he had a purpose.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "But you shall
[1:11:12] receive power."
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; This is the kind of power I'm talking
[1:11:16] about. I'm talking about overcoming
[1:11:18] power. I'm talking power that's much
[1:11:21] greater than in the salmon. Power that's
[1:11:24] much greater than the instinct that's in
[1:11:25] the birds that fly for thousands of
[1:11:27] miles. Power and and a direction if the
[1:11:32] birds know exactly where to go and the
[1:11:34] salmon know where to go. There's power
[1:11:36] that's you and I in you and I knows
[1:11:39] exactly where to go.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you'll just release
[1:11:43] yourself that power, that power will
[1:11:45] tell you what's right
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; and what's wrong. That power will tell
[1:11:49] you when you're going over the edge.
[1:11:51] That power will tell you when you're
[1:11:52] leaning to the world. That power will
[1:11:55] tell you when you're selling out your
[1:11:56] interest to the things of this flesh. Uh
[1:11:59] do you believe me?
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the same power.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; That power will tell you when you're
[1:12:05] growing cold and lukewarm. That power is
[1:12:08] the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the very spirit of
[1:12:11] God that came out of God in the
[1:12:12] beginning.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; And it was sent out to express God.
[1:12:17] Amen.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; So much today that is not expressing
[1:12:20] him. You shall receive power after that
[1:12:23] the Holy Ghost has come upon you.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; And you shall be witnesses not you might
[1:12:28] be or you will hope to be. You shall be
[1:12:31] witnesses
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; unto me. Not unto yourself or unto this
[1:12:35] church. You shall be witnesses unto me,
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; both in Jerusalem
[1:12:43] and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[1:12:45] uttermost part of the earth.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Then Paul said in Romans
[1:12:51] and we know that all things work
[1:12:53] together for good.
[1:12:55] Now, don't just lose yourself in the
[1:12:57] fact that we've heard it before hundreds
[1:12:59] of times and so many people quote it,
[1:13:02] but notice how it says. And we know that
[1:13:05] all things work together for good to
[1:13:07] them that love God and to them who are
[1:13:12] the called according
[1:13:15] that's according to his purpose.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; God has a purpose.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God has spelled out
[1:13:24] in very very clear terms what the
[1:13:27] purpose is. The purpose is God was going
[1:13:32] to express himself. He said he wanted to
[1:13:34] he he was going to achieve he had a
[1:13:36] motive in doing this and he was going to
[1:13:38] achieve it. I can tell you friends
[1:13:40] whether we're successful whether we
[1:13:42] surrender whether we yield or not is not
[1:13:45] going to change the plan of God one
[1:13:47] iota.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; God's plan cannot be hindered.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; God's plan shall be accomplished.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; If you're a son and daughter of God, you
[1:13:57] will come. You'll come easy the way or
[1:13:59] the hard way. one way or the other, but
[1:14:01] you will come. Hallelujah. And all that
[1:14:04] the father has given me will come. And
[1:14:06] no man can pluck them out of my hand.
[1:14:09] But we also as believers need to have
[1:14:12] that confidence. Nail our faith down.
[1:14:15] For those that are still outside of
[1:14:17] fellowship, those that may be backsliden
[1:14:19] or those that are away from God, we need
[1:14:21] to pray that the Holy Spirit will go
[1:14:24] wherever they are this morning and deal
[1:14:26] with them.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Make them miserable. Take
[1:14:31] their sleep away. Take their health away
[1:14:34] if necessary. But save their soul.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; That's the expression of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:42] because that's the expression of God.
[1:14:44] His selfex expression is what was his
[1:14:46] determination. And we are called
[1:14:49] according to his purpose. In Romans nine
[1:14:52] also,
[1:14:53] neither because they are the seed of
[1:14:55] Abraham are they all children, but in
[1:14:58] Isaac shall thy seed be called. That is,
[1:15:02] they which are the children of the
[1:15:04] flesh, these are not the children of of
[1:15:06] God, but the children of the promise are
[1:15:09] counted for the seed.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; For this is the word of promise. At this
[1:15:15] time will I come and Sarah shall have a
[1:15:19] son. And not only this, but when Rebecca
[1:15:23] also had conceived by one, even by our
[1:15:26] father Isaac, for the children being not
[1:15:29] yet born, neither having done any good
[1:15:32] or evil, that the purpose of God
[1:15:37] according to election might stand. that
[1:15:40] the purpose of God in other words his
[1:15:43] purpose could not be deterred. His
[1:15:46] purpose could not be diminished. His
[1:15:49] purpose could not be removed. It purpose
[1:15:53] according to election must stand not of
[1:15:56] works but of him that calleth. And so
[1:15:59] the purpose the purpose in the in the
[1:16:03] Greek as it's used here is the setting
[1:16:06] forth of a thing. I want you to hold
[1:16:09] that. The purpose of God is the purpose
[1:16:12] is to set forth something to set it
[1:16:15] forth the placing of it in view to bring
[1:16:18] it into full view. That's God's purpose.
[1:16:21] So now we take the prophet's statement
[1:16:23] which gives such enlightenment to this
[1:16:25] that the thing that God had in his mind.
[1:16:28] The great secret he had in his mind was
[1:16:31] that he was going to express himself.
[1:16:35] This mighty vast ocean of expression.
[1:16:40] But God was going to express himself and
[1:16:43] he had a purpose in doing that.
[1:16:47] A precise purpose. And in his purpose,
[1:16:50] he had to put he had to put his purpose
[1:16:52] out into full view. Which brings it down
[1:16:57] to you and I that are seated here today.
[1:16:59] Why are we here? We are we are seated
[1:17:02] here that we might hear the plan of God,
[1:17:06] the purpose of God and to know that that
[1:17:09] purpose is to express himself. So we
[1:17:12] must be conscious that that God God was
[1:17:15] in Christ
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; and Christ is in me.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; And the purpose of that is not to give
[1:17:22] me a good feeling, not to give me a
[1:17:24] tingle down my spine, not to just make
[1:17:27] me to speak in tongues or to have some
[1:17:29] other gift. That has nothing to do with
[1:17:31] it. What it has is that God was in
[1:17:34] Christ and Christ is in me and the I
[1:17:36] receive Christ by the word. That's why
[1:17:39] the spoken word is an absolute
[1:17:41] essential. You hear the word and as it
[1:17:44] falls into a believing heart, the Holy
[1:17:46] Spirit comes to that word and makes that
[1:17:49] word alive. And the life is not the life
[1:17:52] of a a watermelon
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; or another animal or of a human. It is
[1:17:59] the life of Jesus Christ. And suddenly
[1:18:02] God has a self-expression on earth.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; And you're expressing Christ.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; We're expressing Christ through the
[1:18:11] message of the hour. You can't express
[1:18:14] Christ without the the life can't come
[1:18:16] without seed. And the seed is the word
[1:18:18] of God. The seed is not merely the
[1:18:20] Bible. The seed is the Bible. The word
[1:18:23] of God revealed to you.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; All kinds of people read the Bible.
[1:18:28] Agnostics read the Bible. Atheists read
[1:18:31] the Bible and the Pope reads the Bible.
[1:18:34] We have a different thought than those
[1:18:36] people.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; And that's where my confidence goes
[1:18:40] back. I was saying to my wife, repeating
[1:18:42] it to her again yesterday, preaching her
[1:18:44] little service that it it maybe you
[1:18:46] think, well, I I'm a simple man, which I
[1:18:48] am, but I go back. I rest back. I go
[1:18:52] back in the early ministry of the
[1:18:53] prophet. I go back. I often give you a
[1:18:57] visual demonstration when he when he
[1:18:59] stands there and is revealing the secret
[1:19:01] of the heart of the people. You may
[1:19:03] think that I'm just caught up with a
[1:19:04] with a second pull. Not so. That was the
[1:19:08] manifestation that it was not a man.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; And that's where you better have your
[1:19:15] faith. When it was not a manifestation
[1:19:18] that it was not a man that was speaking
[1:19:21] because no man would know those things.
[1:19:23] He says, "You know that I don't know
[1:19:25] those things." Who was that? That was
[1:19:27] God and God being poured out into the
[1:19:31] man so that he could pour out into the
[1:19:34] people the secret of their heart and
[1:19:36] make it known to them. But now when I
[1:19:39] come now to the word of God to to things
[1:19:42] that have much more significance and
[1:19:44] much more weight, which has to do with
[1:19:47] my faith being anchored that it's Christ
[1:19:49] in me. How do you know? Because we
[1:19:52] believed your word,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; we have believed. Thus saith the Lord.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; I believed it in its most elementary
[1:19:59] state and I believe it now in its more
[1:20:02] uh complex state.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; When I run into things and say, "I don't
[1:20:07] really understand that." That's fine.
[1:20:10] But the one thing I do understand, I
[1:20:13] understand the source.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; I understand where it came from. And I
[1:20:18] always go back where it came from. And
[1:20:20] even I don't know maybe things happen in
[1:20:22] your life or in your in your circle of
[1:20:24] events are taking place but you can say
[1:20:27] I know one thing I know where that
[1:20:29] message came from. I go back to its
[1:20:32] origin and I know that was God. I know
[1:20:35] it was not a man and that's what I
[1:20:37] believe
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; and that's why I believe it.
[1:20:44] So now God, because he has a purpose,
[1:20:48] he brought you
[1:20:50] individually. He brought you as an
[1:20:52] individual to this specific time
[1:20:56] in the world because he needs your body
[1:21:01] as a vessel. And I speak to everyone
[1:21:05] under the sound of my voice. If God
[1:21:07] brought you here and brought you and
[1:21:09] opened your eyes to this message, that
[1:21:11] means that God has a purpose. And I am
[1:21:14] telling you this morning, his purpose is
[1:21:16] to express himself. So thus, you are a
[1:21:19] vessel chosen and called of Almighty God
[1:21:23] to express Almighty God in this age,
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; whatever it might be. Right.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; And obviously it may be something that
[1:21:33] the world does not is not too prepared
[1:21:35] to accept.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; So the purpose is to set forth something
[1:21:40] to expose it to view so that it can be
[1:21:44] looked at.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; You happen to be here in the world to be
[1:21:47] looked at.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; And God intended that that you will be
[1:21:51] looked at
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; and that you will be viewed by the world
[1:21:55] and those around you. And then when they
[1:21:57] see you, even though they may not hear
[1:21:59] your words, they will see something that
[1:22:02] is unearly,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; something that is heavenly, something
[1:22:06] that is divine, and they will come under
[1:22:08] an atmosphere.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; I intend to go into this with some
[1:22:12] depth.
[1:22:14] Now, with regards to the purpose in this
[1:22:18] message, Christ the mystery of God, he
[1:22:20] said if he had if he had this three-fold
[1:22:23] purpose,
[1:22:25] if he had this purpose, if God had this
[1:22:28] intention and this force that was within
[1:22:31] him, this
[1:22:34] bursting forth of life, it wasn't just
[1:22:37] something spontaneous that was going to
[1:22:39] burst forth from the eternal one, but he
[1:22:42] had a purpose. that was coming with a
[1:22:44] direction,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; a direct purpose to make himself known.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; That was just first he said and brother
[1:22:52] brother Brandham says we want to find
[1:22:54] out what this three-fold purpose and the
[1:22:58] first thing was God wanted to reveal
[1:23:00] himself
[1:23:02] to reveal himself to the people.
[1:23:08] When we determine that the purpose of
[1:23:10] God
[1:23:12] for all creation was first and foremost
[1:23:15] to pro to express or manifest himself.
[1:23:19] When we recognize that then we will
[1:23:21] begin to be in a place where we can
[1:23:26] discover what is the purpose of God for
[1:23:28] our individual life.
[1:23:33] Now he says in the warning then judgment
[1:23:37] this just a little portion now has to do
[1:23:38] with the purpose of God. Says you have
[1:23:41] to know God and his nature
[1:23:45] before you can understand his word.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; You should put that down and remember
[1:23:50] that it's warning then judgment. You
[1:23:53] have to know God. See, I find so many
[1:23:56] they think they know God, but and and
[1:23:59] and no doubt that they do, but then
[1:24:01] they, you know, they encounter something
[1:24:02] in their life and go completely sideways
[1:24:06] and somehow think it's God. And it's
[1:24:09] not, you have to know God and his nature
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; before you can understand his word.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; It's not to know what you want
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; and then try and figure it out in the
[1:24:24] word. That's not it at all. It's the
[1:24:26] Holy Spirit taking the message that's
[1:24:29] been spoken and putting it forward. That
[1:24:32] is the direction and the guide for our
[1:24:34] life.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; You have to know God and his nature
[1:24:42] before you can understand his word. He
[1:24:44] has the key to that word himself and
[1:24:48] he's the only one can handle it and
[1:24:51] opens it. And so he's the one has to
[1:24:54] reveal it.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; That is why I put so much emphasis. And
[1:24:59] you must I trust you can accommodate me
[1:25:02] this morning
[1:25:05] with with your full attention and your
[1:25:07] thoughts
[1:25:10] because
[1:25:12] I'm seeking to know,
[1:25:14] you know, precisely the the will of God.
[1:25:16] And I appreciate I've had people I've
[1:25:19] talked to just this last week in the
[1:25:21] office, one of our young one of our
[1:25:24] young men. And he said with all
[1:25:27] seriousness, he had a certain direction
[1:25:29] in his life.
[1:25:31] And he said to me in my study, he said,
[1:25:35] "Now I don't want the permissive will.
[1:25:39] I want to know the perfect will."
[1:25:42] That's a wonderful statement.
[1:25:45] I don't want the permissive will.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; I don't want what God will allow me to
[1:25:50] do and go and everything else for my
[1:25:52] life. I want the perfect will.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; And I believe that God will answer to
[1:25:58] that kind of a response.
[1:26:02] He says, "And now we find out that his
[1:26:05] nature was here to always warn man
[1:26:08] before judgment, to warn a nation before
[1:26:11] judgment, and so forth." That was his
[1:26:13] nature. Just please stay with me. He
[1:26:16] always gives his warning, a reminder to
[1:26:18] us of responsibility. We are responsible
[1:26:21] and God has put us here on the earth for
[1:26:24] a reason.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; God has put us here.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; And you should probably say with me, God
[1:26:31] has put me here for a reason.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; He's put me here for a reason. And that
[1:26:39] reason that he has put us here for, we
[1:26:42] are responsible to him for that reason.
[1:26:45] So we want to be able to say to
[1:26:47] ourselves, God has put me here for a
[1:26:50] reason.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; According to the prophet's word, and I
[1:26:54] am responsible to God for that reason.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; It got quieter and quieter instead of
[1:27:00] noisier and noisier.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. God has put us
[1:27:05] here for God has put me here for a
[1:27:06] reason. God has put me here for a reason
[1:27:10] and I am responsible to God for that
[1:27:14] reason.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; That's a purpose that he's put us here.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Now we may be farmers or mechanics or
[1:27:22] engineers or business people,
[1:27:24] housewives, mothers, single people,
[1:27:27] students, uh whatever we are,
[1:27:32] that's what we're uh uh uh that's what
[1:27:35] we are doing in our life. That's what
[1:27:37] we're occupied with.
[1:27:40] Now listen, that is not the reason
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; that you're here.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; God may use you in that capacity. He may
[1:27:50] have led you into that particular uh
[1:27:54] type of work or that home where you're
[1:27:56] living. He may have well led you there
[1:27:58] because there's somebody through the
[1:28:01] network of life and the way that he's
[1:28:03] designed it that you're to contact or
[1:28:05] you're to live before. You're to give a
[1:28:08] a testimony to just by your life, by
[1:28:11] your countenance, by your conduct, by
[1:28:13] your demeanor, whatever it might be or
[1:28:16] some word that you may say or some book
[1:28:18] that you may give out. That is your
[1:28:20] purpose. That's your purpose. That's the
[1:28:22] reason for you being here. But the
[1:28:24] reason for you being here is not to live
[1:28:27] just a certain type of life and live in
[1:28:30] a certain place. We want to live where
[1:28:32] we live, work where we work. We want to
[1:28:34] do what we're doing by the perfect will
[1:28:38] of God.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; So that we can fulfill our purpose.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; So you should go to him. He goes on to
[1:28:51] say God has put us here on the earth for
[1:28:54] a reason and that reason that he has put
[1:28:56] us here for. We are responsible to him
[1:29:00] for that reason. You should go to him in
[1:29:03] case you haven't done so. I think it's
[1:29:05] good for us to do so on a regular basis.
[1:29:08] You should go to him and find out what
[1:29:12] he wants you to do.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; What do you want me to do?
[1:29:21] And if you want to work for a man and he
[1:29:23] gave you a job on a ranch or something
[1:29:26] another and you just went out to the
[1:29:28] barn and just sat down out there and
[1:29:31] said, "Well, see, you must go and ask
[1:29:34] him what he wants you to do and then do
[1:29:36] it."
[1:29:38] He says, "And then if our life here on
[1:29:40] earth, if our life
[1:29:44] and then if our life is on the earth
[1:29:46] here, then we should go to the one who
[1:29:48] put us here."
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Now, if you just consider that your
[1:29:53] mother or father or some uh you know
[1:29:58] grandparents or whatever more some
[1:30:00] natural lineage brought you here, then
[1:30:02] you're responsible to them. Better go
[1:30:03] and ask them what they want you to do.
[1:30:07] But the messenger said that God has put
[1:30:10] us here.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; And we need to go to God and ask him,
[1:30:14] "What do you want me to do?"
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And then go and do it.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Whatever that might be.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; And it's wonderful to be able to say
[1:30:24] this morning, I believe. I'm exactly
[1:30:25] where God wants me.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm exactly where God wants
[1:30:29] me and I'm doing what he wants me to do.
[1:30:32] But I know that this is a common
[1:30:34] question. And I'm sure if I asked for
[1:30:36] the raise of hands, we'd probably have
[1:30:38] uh a lot of hands that would be raised.
[1:30:40] I I am even wondering what God wants me
[1:30:43] to do. I'm wondering concerning that's
[1:30:45] why I'm speaking this way. But here's
[1:30:47] some comfort for you and I gave it I've
[1:30:49] given it in counsel times and I gave it
[1:30:51] to this young man this last week. And
[1:30:54] that is that we don't just sit back and
[1:30:57] wait till God, you know, uh sends a
[1:31:00] thunderbolt. Like one man I heard about,
[1:31:03] he was a a a worker on a farm. Exactly.
[1:31:05] Brother Bram talks about a ranch and and
[1:31:08] his boss always had told him, "See,
[1:31:10] listen, uh, when you got it figured out,
[1:31:14] figure it out first. And when you got it
[1:31:15] figured out, you're halfway done." And
[1:31:19] he just drilled him into drill that into
[1:31:21] him. Just figure it all out first. So
[1:31:24] one day the farmer had to go to the town
[1:31:27] and he told him he says now what I want
[1:31:28] you to do I want you to plow or harrow
[1:31:30] or disc this field and when he got back
[1:31:34] the fellow hadn't even started. He was
[1:31:35] just laying back in the hay stack with
[1:31:37] his hands behind his head. He said you
[1:31:40] you haven't done what I told you to do.
[1:31:42] He said I've got it half done. I figured
[1:31:44] it out.
[1:31:47] Sometimes as Christians you know we tend
[1:31:50] to be that way. we think, well, I'll
[1:31:52] just wait till God uh, you know, sends a
[1:31:55] thunderbolt. No, I I suggest you just do
[1:31:58] the best you can
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; and and with a real sincere heart and
[1:32:02] move forward because I'll give you a
[1:32:05] scriptural principle which I gave this
[1:32:06] young brother and have given perhaps a
[1:32:08] number of you and that is when the
[1:32:10] apostle Paul he was already in movement
[1:32:14] he was on route he was he was already
[1:32:17] going on what they call one of his
[1:32:18] missionary journeys and he was he was
[1:32:21] going he wasn't waiting on anybody he
[1:32:23] was going he was being a witness he was
[1:32:25] preaching He was doing his apostolic
[1:32:27] work and he saw a vision from a man from
[1:32:31] Macedonia
[1:32:32] saying, "Come over and help us." And so,
[1:32:35] Apostle Paul simply changed his
[1:32:37] direction. He he was already in
[1:32:40] movement. So, he just changed his
[1:32:41] direction, went to Macedonia. When he
[1:32:44] got there, it was a woman. Lydia was the
[1:32:47] one who he first, I believe, encountered
[1:32:50] there.
[1:32:52] So you can be going a a direction and
[1:32:55] you can uh feel confident in your heart
[1:32:59] that this is the direction God wants me
[1:33:01] to this is what God intends for me to do
[1:33:03] and I'm just seeking sincerely to know
[1:33:06] his will. If it's not if if it if he
[1:33:09] wants you to do something else he will
[1:33:11] he will direct you. The main thing is
[1:33:13] you got to have the number one
[1:33:14] foundation that is that I know I'm here
[1:33:17] for a divine purpose. I know that go God
[1:33:21] God has sent his word my way and I have
[1:33:24] believed it. And so I pursue the
[1:33:26] direction I feel to go. I pursue the
[1:33:30] work or the life or the geographical
[1:33:33] location. I pursue that. And if God
[1:33:36] wants me elsewhere or wants me to do
[1:33:39] something different, my heart is ready
[1:33:41] to receive it. I say, "Speak Lord.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, I'm ready to do it."
[1:33:48] Isn't that a wonderful thing? And we can
[1:33:50] be at rest and we can be at peace about
[1:33:51] that. In the meantime, do what your
[1:33:54] hands are fine to do and do it with all
[1:33:57] your heart and do it as unto the Lord.
[1:33:59] And I think that would be good for you
[1:34:01] graduates that just graduated out of
[1:34:03] school. This is the thing for you to do.
[1:34:06] Do what God puts before you. Do with all
[1:34:09] your heart. Live for God. and realize
[1:34:12] your real purpose in life is not to do
[1:34:14] that what you're finding your hands or
[1:34:16] your mind to do, but do do that which is
[1:34:20] the purpose and the reason why God has
[1:34:22] you here.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; My goodness, time is slipping away and
[1:34:28] we're just getting on here. He says,
[1:34:31] "And then if our life is on the earth
[1:34:34] here, then we should go to the one who
[1:34:36] put us here. Lord, what would you have
[1:34:38] me to do? What must I do? Why am I here?
[1:34:44] If it is to be a housewife, a
[1:34:46] dishwasher, whatever God wants you to
[1:34:49] do, then you do that the very best that
[1:34:52] you know how to do it. No matter how
[1:34:55] little, no matter how little it is, you
[1:34:58] must do it.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; I don't find here any place where he
[1:35:03] says, "If you don't know what to do,
[1:35:04] don't do anything."
[1:35:09] Whatever you find to do, do it.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Do with all your heart. If you haven't
[1:35:13] got anything to do, I'll give you
[1:35:14] something to do.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; In the message expressions, I'm just
[1:35:24] trying to get over this purpose and the
[1:35:26] reason for being. Brother Brandon was
[1:35:28] taking, I believe, a funeral at this
[1:35:30] time and he said his purpose, his
[1:35:34] purpose is to show us through the
[1:35:36] flowers. We're we finally arrived at
[1:35:39] some spring and summer weather. We're
[1:35:41] seeing some flowers.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; You might not think it, but I love
[1:35:47] flowers.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; And uh in fact is I just love color. I
[1:35:53] say to my wife, you know, dig up those
[1:35:55] green things and put flowers there. I
[1:35:57] like color, more flowers. So, she goes
[1:36:00] and buys flowers. I said, not little
[1:36:02] ones, big ones. I like lots of color
[1:36:05] flowers.
[1:36:09] She'll probably buy a bunch this week.
[1:36:13] He says he speak and and he shows us
[1:36:16] through the flowers,
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; through the sun,
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; through the trees,
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; through all life
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; that he's the resurrection and the life.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; God resurrects his life when it serves
[1:36:29] his purpose.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; You and I have had a resurrection.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; If you know what the message is all
[1:36:36] about, we've had a resurrection.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; You've been resurrected
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; from death.
[1:36:42] You were even buried under
[1:36:44] denominational gravestone
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; and God brought you in a resurrection.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; You're a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Is that not so?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; And so we've had a resurrection. It
[1:36:58] says, "And if the flower serves the
[1:37:00] purpose, its purpose, and God has a
[1:37:03] resurrection for the flower, how much
[1:37:05] more for our sister?" He was referring
[1:37:07] to this sister who had passed away who
[1:37:10] served her purpose in life. God has a
[1:37:12] resurrection for those that serve their
[1:37:15] purpose. We can find our purpose and
[1:37:18] then serve him.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; So my message this morning has to do at
[1:37:22] this early stage of the service. We want
[1:37:24] to know number one, we have a purpose.
[1:37:27] And that purpose is to be the vessel,
[1:37:30] the conduit through which God in
[1:37:33] initial, his very initial outpouring,
[1:37:36] sending forth the creative power, the
[1:37:40] anointing from him onto the earth
[1:37:43] through all the Old Testament to bring
[1:37:45] forth Christ who was the image who would
[1:37:48] go to Calvary and life would go from him
[1:37:51] so it could come down into the church
[1:37:53] and come down into us for the purpose of
[1:37:56] expressing expressing. That's God's
[1:37:58] first purpose of expressing himself.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; That's a marvelous thing, friends. It's
[1:38:03] just absolutely marvelous. And I hope I
[1:38:05] you followed me through that real quick
[1:38:08] progression.
[1:38:10] Now, there are many, and I just want to
[1:38:13] drop this in. There are many that do the
[1:38:15] same thing in life that you do.
[1:38:18] Look down. I see electricians. I see
[1:38:21] painters. I see carpenters. See
[1:38:23] housewives. I've seen students I see
[1:38:26] here we are preachers there's all kinds
[1:38:28] of preachers preaching right this minute
[1:38:30] so what all kinds of people do exactly
[1:38:33] what you and I do
[1:38:36] are they expressing God no
[1:38:44] say well that's a that's a harsh
[1:38:46] statement
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; unless you serve his purpose
[1:38:54] You that are plumbers or you that are
[1:38:56] carpenters or you that are businessmen
[1:38:58] or you what that is not your purpose in
[1:39:01] life
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; that only happens to be a side issue.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Your real purpose is that God arranged
[1:39:08] for you to be where you're at
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; because you're something in eternity and
[1:39:13] God needs a certain expression here on
[1:39:15] earth to achieve something up there
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; and that's why you're here
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; and that's why you're doing what you're
[1:39:22] doing. So not everybody who does this,
[1:39:24] not not all the students who learn and
[1:39:26] study from exactly the same books that
[1:39:27] you young people do, that that's not all
[1:39:30] that's not God's purpose. God's purpose
[1:39:33] is that he has elected ones who he
[1:39:36] called.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; And he justified them.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; And he's glorified them.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; He's brought them into his own plan
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; by his spoken word. And he gave you the
[1:39:49] heart and the ability to believe that
[1:39:51] word. not necessarily to understand it
[1:39:53] all, but to believe it. And because you
[1:39:55] believe it, you have become a part of
[1:39:58] his purpose.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God has a reason here on the
[1:40:01] earth, and you're part of the reason.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; I'm holding back or I would I could
[1:40:09] preach a little bit more.
[1:40:11] Going to just save it. Do we have a
[1:40:13] little bit of time?
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Now, so God has, don't weary, please.
[1:40:18] God has sent out from himself
[1:40:22] his word. Sent out from himself his word
[1:40:27] and his spirit
[1:40:29] to make that word live.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; But now the letter killth.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; If you have just a word, but he sent
[1:40:40] forth out from himself his word and his
[1:40:44] spirit. For the spirit is the element
[1:40:46] that makes the word alive.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture teaches. And
[1:40:51] to make the word live in the hearts of
[1:40:54] the believers, the elected ones. They
[1:40:57] have been elected to be his witness or
[1:40:59] his expression on the earth. And you are
[1:41:03] here. God has done something
[1:41:05] extraordinary for you. God has done
[1:41:09] something
[1:41:11] absolutely marvelous
[1:41:14] for you.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; There has not been people who walked the
[1:41:19] face of the earth that could look back
[1:41:21] just a few years and see the kind of
[1:41:24] messenger and the kind of message and
[1:41:26] the kind of vindication that you have.
[1:41:29] They didn't have books. They didn't have
[1:41:31] tapes. They didn't have all of these
[1:41:33] things. And what they did have, they had
[1:41:35] under great duress. You've been handed
[1:41:38] it on a, shall I say, a silver platter.
[1:41:41] You've been handed it, have you not?
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; You've been handed it. It's very easy
[1:41:45] coming. Make sure you use it. Make sure
[1:41:47] you get good value out of it.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Does me good. I hear people even, you
[1:41:53] know, my wife, she just determined to,
[1:41:57] she's staying with me in this Christ,
[1:41:59] the mystery of God revealed. She wants
[1:42:00] to get what the Holy Spirit is wanting
[1:42:02] to bring to us.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; In the message that day on on Calvary,
[1:42:13] I'm just really holding back because I
[1:42:14] I've got some things I must say here.
[1:42:18] He said, someone said,
[1:42:21] now here's our purpose on earth.
[1:42:24] Someone said to him,
[1:42:26] how can you stand and let anyone call
[1:42:29] you such bad names? Saying that to him.
[1:42:33] How can you stand that, brother
[1:42:34] Brandham? for anybody to call you such
[1:42:36] bad names. He said you don't live, he
[1:42:38] said, you don't, he answered them, you
[1:42:40] don't live for yourself, you live for
[1:42:42] others.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; You live for others that you might
[1:42:46] redeem that man.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; You become sons. And the trouble of it
[1:42:51] is
[1:42:53] that the church has forgot they were
[1:42:55] sons.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; The church has forgot that they are
[1:43:02] sons. He said, "You are taking Christ's
[1:43:06] place." God, help us.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; God, really help us to take a hold of
[1:43:11] that. You are taking Christ's place. You
[1:43:15] are sons. So, don't live for yourself.
[1:43:17] Live for others.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandham, I can live for
[1:43:22] this. I I can live for this brother
[1:43:23] because he's sure a nice man. He said,
[1:43:26] "That's not it.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Live for that man that hates you." Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, before I read this to you, I
[1:43:32] read it to myself.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; I scan my horizon. Say, who is it that
[1:43:38] hates me? Who is it that I need to
[1:43:42] express God to? I'm having Elijah give
[1:43:45] me instructions.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Tell me, love that man. I can't just
[1:43:49] push it off.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Says, "Love that man." He said, "Live
[1:43:54] for that person who'd kill you if they
[1:43:56] could."
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:44:01] That's what they did to him.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Says they killed him and he died that he
[1:44:06] might save them.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; That's eternal life.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; When that's in your bosom, you're facing
[1:44:12] heaven then.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; You know, I hear a I hear that a lot of
[1:44:15] time. When you're doing good to others,
[1:44:16] you're facing heaven then. They say it
[1:44:18] too quickly and I don't know if they say
[1:44:20] it accurately, but he said here when
[1:44:23] that's in your bosom. What is it? When
[1:44:25] that's in your bosom, when they want to
[1:44:26] even kill you and do away with you. He
[1:44:28] said, "When that's in your bosom, you're
[1:44:30] facing heaven then. But you sacrifice
[1:44:33] your own things. Give them up like the
[1:44:36] sheep gives its wool and you look look
[1:44:39] on towards Calvary." He said, "I hope
[1:44:41] that helps you get in a place." And I
[1:44:45] hope it does too.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; I hope it helps us get in a place.
[1:44:50] That's what he says. That's what the
[1:44:52] tabernacle speaking of his own church.
[1:44:54] That's what all the people that has has
[1:44:56] got to do is to find out what you are
[1:45:00] and what's the purpose. So that's the
[1:45:03] segment on the purpose.
[1:45:06] First was to express himself. Going to
[1:45:09] stay with that. The second
[1:45:12] the second
[1:45:15] excuse me is to have the preeminence
[1:45:19] in his body of believers. So the first
[1:45:21] is to express himself and the second is
[1:45:24] to have his preeminence in the body of
[1:45:27] believers that is his bride that he
[1:45:30] might live in people.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; So that's the second thing. The first is
[1:45:35] that he wanted to express himself. The
[1:45:38] second one comes right in behind it that
[1:45:40] he could live in his people because
[1:45:42] that's how he was going to express
[1:45:43] himself. And the third is to restore by
[1:45:47] that to restore the kingdom back to way
[1:45:50] it was when he had fellowship with Adam
[1:45:52] and Eve in the beginning in the cool of
[1:45:55] the day. Said it's going to come back
[1:45:57] but I have to go through this process.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; There's three words I would like you to
[1:46:03] notice. First his first purpose was to
[1:46:07] express.
[1:46:10] The second word in the second purpose
[1:46:13] was the preeminence. You know what
[1:46:14] preeminence is? Preeeminent.
[1:46:18] He is
[1:46:19] he is the first and foremost.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; And the third is to restore to express
[1:46:27] to have preeminence and to restore. All
[1:46:30] three of those hear me now. All three of
[1:46:34] those can only happen by this power of
[1:46:39] this force, this anointing that God
[1:46:42] poured out of himself.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; And how did he convey it to us? He
[1:46:46] poured it out. It's called the breath of
[1:46:50] God which God breathed into his word.
[1:46:53] Amen.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; And then that word, that word that he
[1:46:57] breathed, not just words, that word
[1:47:00] which he breathed is breathed out
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; onto the people.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And Jesus breathed
[1:47:07] on him, you remember from some services
[1:47:08] ago, he breathed on them and said,
[1:47:12] receive ye the Holy Ghost."
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Receive ye my breath."
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; As he knew his breath was the Holy
[1:47:19] Spirit. Receive ye the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The breath of God.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; And in this day we have received the
[1:47:28] breath of God.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Some say, "I received the breath of a
[1:47:33] Bible school." So be it. It won't get
[1:47:36] you out of the grave.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; It won't get you out of the grave. That
[1:47:40] is for sure. We didn't receive it from a
[1:47:42] Bible school. We didn't receive it from
[1:47:44] a theologian. We received it from thus
[1:47:47] saith the Lord.
[1:47:49] Hallelujah. I'm glad for that. Friends,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; I talked to quite an intelligent person
[1:47:55] just this last week.
[1:47:57] I'd say a very intelligent person has a
[1:48:00] very responsible position. And we began
[1:48:04] to speak about the wisdom
[1:48:08] whereby
[1:48:09] our brother Brandham spoke
[1:48:12] and I said to this brother because he
[1:48:15] was astounded. He said, you know what,
[1:48:17] the grade seven education, he was saying
[1:48:19] these things not realizing perhaps these
[1:48:22] things didn't come uh just from the mind
[1:48:24] of a man that had been developed in a
[1:48:26] grade seven education. It had a it had
[1:48:29] come from a channel that has come from
[1:48:32] God.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, a person would say thus
[1:48:38] sayith the school or thus sayith the
[1:48:40] Bible school or thus sayith the seminary
[1:48:41] or thus sayith a certain book I read.
[1:48:44] It's not that. It's thus sayith the
[1:48:46] lord.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; And that is why.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; So when when he spoke about botney life,
[1:48:53] brother V spoke about botney life, he
[1:48:55] sounded exactly like a horiculturist.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; When he spoke about the cells in the
[1:49:00] body going wild way back in the 1950s
[1:49:04] and you get a wound and get a sore, a
[1:49:06] cell goes wild, he begins to describe
[1:49:08] how the cancer forms and what happens in
[1:49:10] the wild. He sounds like a doctor.
[1:49:13] He starts talking about the planets and
[1:49:16] they're not looking 150 million lighty
[1:49:18] years straight into space. They're
[1:49:19] looking into a curve. It's in an arc and
[1:49:22] they'll find out someday it's it's in a
[1:49:24] in an arc like that. He sounds like an
[1:49:26] astronomer.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; He says astounding things.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; He talks about the Earth's crust and how
[1:49:33] California will sink and the and and how
[1:49:35] the Earth's crust and and and how they
[1:49:37] react upon one another. And when he
[1:49:39] does, he talks exactly like a scientist.
[1:49:43] Why? Because it's the God of all
[1:49:45] science.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; He talks about the economics. He's he
[1:49:50] they should have had him in the White
[1:49:52] House.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; They to fix their economic problem.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; That's why they had the prophets right
[1:49:59] there and the kings took military advice
[1:50:01] from them because they were the greatest
[1:50:03] strategist there is.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; You might think I'm a fanatic, but
[1:50:09] that's absolutely the truth. Amen.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; And we've been tapped into such a thing
[1:50:14] as that
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; starts talking about the the the the
[1:50:18] dimensions of the material, the four
[1:50:20] dimensions and the dimension that is the
[1:50:22] ether waves he called it and and said
[1:50:24] that it carries the voices and voices
[1:50:26] going through here. Look at the age. He
[1:50:29] spoke ahead of his time and here we are
[1:50:31] with voices and the whole space that
[1:50:34] dimension that he described
[1:50:37] being filled with the entertainment age.
[1:50:41] the music that is going, the blasphemy
[1:50:43] that is going on, all the vile and
[1:50:46] vulgarity that's going on. But I'm glad
[1:50:48] to be able to report to you today, the
[1:50:51] messengergers's voice encircles the
[1:50:53] earth.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, it's a bleeding word.
[1:51:00] Amen.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; And he said when a man dies here, that's
[1:51:03] how Jesus I never understood it until I
[1:51:05] got into the message. But when a man
[1:51:07] dies here, because the scripture says
[1:51:09] that Jesus died for the sins of the
[1:51:12] whole world,
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; that was a problem to me cuz everybody
[1:51:17] put it back in the denominational world
[1:51:19] in the religious world put it back on
[1:51:21] the man says, "Well, the man has to
[1:51:22] accept it." The Bible says that Jesus
[1:51:25] died for the sins of the whole world.
[1:51:27] And I thought, if he died for the sins
[1:51:29] of the whole world, then why are man
[1:51:31] still carrying it? Why is man going to
[1:51:34] be judged by it? Why is he going to be
[1:51:36] brought into the presence of God and
[1:51:37] judged for sins that Jesus paid for? But
[1:51:41] the prophet says, "As long as he's here
[1:51:44] in life, that blood is like a ribbon
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; around the entire world."
[1:51:51] But the moment he dies, his spirit
[1:51:54] passes beyond that protective measure
[1:51:58] and he stands naked in the presence of
[1:52:01] God with no blood to atone and he can't
[1:52:05] come back.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; He's lived his space of time on earth.
[1:52:10] And he says furthermore, he's caught in
[1:52:12] a nightmare.
[1:52:14] I pray to God that there isn't a man or
[1:52:17] a woman or child hearing my voice today
[1:52:20] that get caught in that nightmare. If
[1:52:22] you do, you do so on your own.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; As I tell you how to bypass that, and
[1:52:28] that is to come to receive the word that
[1:52:32] the Lord Jesus Christ has spoken in this
[1:52:34] day.
[1:52:37] [Music]
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; And pass the judgment.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:48] Hallelujah.
[1:52:50] That force of life, give me a few more
[1:52:52] moments, please, if you don't mind. That
[1:52:54] force of life that issued out from God,
[1:52:58] not only in its magnitude, in its
[1:53:01] breath, but also in its depth of
[1:53:04] character.
[1:53:06] I need to enlarge on that a wee bit
[1:53:10] while you think about it. In him was
[1:53:12] life and the life was the light light of
[1:53:15] man. In him was life. In him was this
[1:53:18] profusion.
[1:53:23] The they said I read a couple of
[1:53:25] scientific statements. They said that uh
[1:53:29] whether they're right or wrong I don't
[1:53:30] know. But this is a number of species
[1:53:33] that have lived on the earth.
[1:53:36] They're like numberless
[1:53:39] un untold millions
[1:53:42] that have lived on the earth and have
[1:53:45] gone into existence non they become
[1:53:47] extinct.
[1:53:49] And I had a hard time grasping this, but
[1:53:51] they said 99.9%
[1:53:54] of life as they know it
[1:53:57] is lost, is extinct.
[1:54:00] One article went on to say that
[1:54:03] there had been five major extinctions
[1:54:08] and they go back and they've named these
[1:54:10] various eras
[1:54:12] when there was uh different forms of
[1:54:14] life on the earth and they you know do
[1:54:17] their dating and have their their
[1:54:20] process
[1:54:21] to determine this and I don't know when
[1:54:24] you start getting 360 million years and
[1:54:26] then the next one maybe 270 million
[1:54:28] years.
[1:54:30] Uh but nevertheless, this is what they
[1:54:32] say. And there have been these five
[1:54:35] major extinctions.
[1:54:37] And they say this
[1:54:40] uh and this is a very very uh credible
[1:54:44] source that I have says the sixth mass
[1:54:48] extinction extinction. The sixth there
[1:54:51] have been five and the sixth mass
[1:54:55] extinction has begun.
[1:54:59] says, "As unbelievable as it may sound,
[1:55:03] after having read through the five mass
[1:55:05] extinctions,
[1:55:07] the sixth mass extinction is in progress
[1:55:09] now with animals going extinct 100 to
[1:55:14] 1,000 times,
[1:55:16] possibly, they said, even 1,000 to
[1:55:18] 10,000 times faster than at the normal
[1:55:22] background extinction rate,
[1:55:25] which is about 10 to 25 species per
[1:55:29] year. So they're saying it's going
[1:55:32] perhaps a 100 to a thousand times that
[1:55:34] rate.
[1:55:37] says rather than a mete me meteorite or
[1:55:40] large volcanic eruption the alarming
[1:55:44] decline of biodiversity which is the
[1:55:46] diversity of the species on earth
[1:55:49] leading to the current mass extinction
[1:55:52] is the results of five major human
[1:55:56] activities.
[1:55:58] So this isn't something that came from
[1:56:00] outer space or some something that
[1:56:03] erupted from internally within the
[1:56:05] earth.
[1:56:07] They said this has been caused by man.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; The habitat habitat destruction. I won't
[1:56:14] go into all of these including
[1:56:17] humaninduced climate change. Human
[1:56:20] induced climate change is the result in
[1:56:23] high amounts of greenhouse gas and
[1:56:25] emissions primarily carbon dioxide,
[1:56:28] methane, nitrous oxide, etc. And we here
[1:56:32] in Canada are going to start paying some
[1:56:34] carbon tax and uh starting after
[1:56:37] tomorrow
[1:56:39] on our on our gasoline. Believe it or
[1:56:41] not, it's even actually going to go
[1:56:42] higher about 2 and a half cents a liter,
[1:56:44] which times five would be about 12 12
[1:56:46] cents on a gallon. we put on they're
[1:56:49] penalizing us for the pollution that's
[1:56:53] going in the air, but they say it's not
[1:56:54] a penalty. They're going to give it back
[1:56:56] somehow. So, however, but the Bible
[1:56:59] says, "But the day of the Lord,
[1:57:03] the day of the Lord shall come as a
[1:57:05] thief and the night in which the heaven
[1:57:07] shall be the heavens shall pass away
[1:57:09] with a great noise, and the elements
[1:57:11] shall might melt with fervent heat, and
[1:57:13] the earth also, and the works that are
[1:57:16] therein shall be burned up." Brother
[1:57:18] Brandham says in the future home,
[1:57:21] he said the heavens will be on fire.
[1:57:25] And he says, he begins to describe the
[1:57:27] the germ and the pollution and all these
[1:57:31] things that are in the heavens and the
[1:57:34] demon forces
[1:57:36] because Jesus said that Satan was the
[1:57:39] prince of the power of the air. Brother
[1:57:42] Brandham says it will not just be a
[1:57:44] fire, but it'll be a holy fire. And God
[1:57:48] is going to give this earth a
[1:57:50] renovation.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; I'm enthused about this renovation.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; I say, God, bring this renovation on.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Cleanse this polluted place.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Man is doing what he can do, but he
[1:58:06] certainly will fail.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; And they're saying clearly that it
[1:58:11] doesn't say this mass extinction will
[1:58:14] take place. It says it has begun.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; It's out of control. And science is
[1:58:21] declaring that it has begun. The
[1:58:24] pollution and the human overpopulation
[1:58:27] and the overh harvesting of hunting and
[1:58:30] fishing and the gathering etc.
[1:58:36] Brother Brandham says in the message
[1:58:38] life, listen, I'm taking a little
[1:58:40] lefthand turn now. Satan won't even let
[1:58:43] people sit and listen to it to truth to
[1:58:47] the answer.
[1:58:50] A lot of time we have the problem and
[1:58:51] we're dealing with dealing with the
[1:58:54] problem but from a superficial
[1:58:56] direction. Don't want to so human. It's
[1:58:59] so human not to want to get right down
[1:59:01] to the problem.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; We we skate around it and skirt around
[1:59:06] it and that's the way we have in the
[1:59:08] world. And Satan won't let people even
[1:59:10] listen to it. He says, "So corrupted,
[1:59:12] mind so far gone, so polluted with the
[1:59:15] things of the world, they have no
[1:59:18] conscience." The Bible said, "In the
[1:59:20] last days, they beheaded, high-minded,
[1:59:21] lovers of pleasure." Lovers of pleasure.
[1:59:25] Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:59:27] God.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:59:33] listen close,
[1:59:38] Brother Rams asked a question.
[1:59:41] He says, "When you say the wicked shall
[1:59:44] not burn eternally,
[1:59:47] do you mean in hell or in the lake of
[1:59:49] fire?"
[1:59:51] I know that it says in Revelation,
[1:59:53] that's the 20th chapter, that hell and
[1:59:56] the and the hell will be cast into the
[1:59:59] lake of fire. If they do not burn
[2:00:02] eternally, what becomes of them? That's
[2:00:06] a question in questions and answers.
[2:00:09] And brother Bram says in three words,
[2:00:12] they become extinct.
[2:00:17] They become extinct.
[2:00:22] Our world, our science, your schools,
[2:00:24] your teacher, your books, your libraries
[2:00:27] are absolutely filled with
[2:00:30] man wanting to preserve because he's
[2:00:33] nervous. Governments are nervous. The
[2:00:35] world is nervous. The United Nations are
[2:00:37] nervous. says, "We're we're losing
[2:00:39] control and they're burning up the
[2:00:41] forests and throwing the gases in the
[2:00:44] air and and all of these things are
[2:00:46] happening and the species are becoming
[2:00:49] extinct and we're losing the flora and
[2:00:52] we're losing all this botney life and
[2:00:54] we're losing this and we can't get it
[2:00:56] back and we're getting all the oil out
[2:00:58] of the earth and we're going to run out
[2:00:59] of our resources and then there's some
[2:01:01] said, "Ah, it's just a bunch of
[2:01:02] nonsense. But but it doesn't take away
[2:01:05] from the fact that people are concerned
[2:01:06] about it. And we know from the
[2:01:08] scriptures that the heavens have to be
[2:01:11] on fire because they have to be purged
[2:01:14] from what man is doing. And the prophet
[2:01:16] said, "Man, it's uh he could destroy
[2:01:19] himself.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; We can destroy ourselves." Oh, we get to
[2:01:23] some places and you can go up into the
[2:01:25] Canadian Arctic or the Alaskan Arctic or
[2:01:28] the Russian Arctic and and you you go up
[2:01:31] into the Arctic and you find oh the
[2:01:34] waters are just so pristine.
[2:01:37] They're just so beautiful and pure and
[2:01:40] oh the air is just crisp. There's no in
[2:01:45] industry, no manufacturing, no nothing.
[2:01:48] You just feel, oh, this is such a
[2:01:51] marvelous place. Do you know that the
[2:01:53] most polluted bodies
[2:01:56] with mercury happen to be our native
[2:01:59] Eskimo people because they eat the
[2:02:02] Arctic char fish and the place that has
[2:02:05] the greatest fallout of nuclear waste is
[2:02:09] in our Arctic
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; and the people have it in their bodies
[2:02:12] and it's resident there for the rest of
[2:02:15] their lives because it doesn't dispense.
[2:02:18] It doesn't disperse out from them at
[2:02:20] least very quickly. It goes on
[2:02:22] throughout their life and are and it's a
[2:02:24] concern and here they are living the way
[2:02:27] they always lived and killing the
[2:02:29] caribou and the reindeer and eating the
[2:02:32] fish out of the ocean. Everything looks
[2:02:33] so sublime
[2:02:35] and it's polluted.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; God saw that.
[2:02:44] Brother Bram says a flower comes up says
[2:02:48] expresses God's purpose. Then it comes
[2:02:50] to fall time and the petals begin to
[2:02:54] wither and they droop and they fall. He
[2:02:59] says, "And God has a funeral service
[2:03:03] and God weeps great tears
[2:03:09] and rain upon the earth and buries those
[2:03:12] seeds.
[2:03:14] has a funeral service so that they can
[2:03:16] have a resurrection in the spring. Once
[2:03:19] again,
[2:03:22] the Bible says that all these things
[2:03:24] were created for him and by him and
[2:03:27] without him was none of these things
[2:03:29] created. And the Bible says also it is
[2:03:31] for his joy,
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; for his glory. And I can't see God
[2:03:37] getting glory over our mountains being
[2:03:39] stripped and our earth being just raped
[2:03:44] of all of its resources and all these
[2:03:47] things and men spewing from his all this
[2:03:50] toxics and things into the air. I'm not
[2:03:52] on to politics, friends. We're going to
[2:03:54] live here.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Is that what the prophet said? We're
[2:03:58] going to live right here. and the the
[2:04:01] original creator.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; You're going to think I'm real fanatic,
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; but when the when the when the Lord
[2:04:09] Jesus announced himself to the seventh
[2:04:11] messenger, he said he's the he is the
[2:04:14] amen, the true witness and the beginning
[2:04:18] of the creation of God.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; That's the one that spoke to the
[2:04:22] messenger of this age.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Listen. And why was the last pull? Why
[2:04:27] was the last pull of that ministry
[2:04:30] creation
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; to the fishy?
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; To the possum
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; to the squirrels.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; To some men.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; To brother way.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Who we have his tapes here.
[2:04:43] Died there. His wife's a Norwegian nurse
[2:04:46] and was right there. I've been in their
[2:04:48] home after he was raised from the dead.
[2:04:51] Why was this power demonstrated? because
[2:04:54] it was announcing the beginning of the
[2:04:57] creation of God.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you have become a
[2:05:01] participant.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; This is burning on me. I have to get it
[2:05:05] off my off my heart. You are a
[2:05:07] participant. I said in the last service
[2:05:10] of his second coming, but you are also a
[2:05:12] participant of the new creation.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Because God is expressing himself in his
[2:05:20] people.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; We maybe don't fully understand that,
[2:05:25] but nevertheless, that happens to be the
[2:05:27] case. And he says, "What happens to
[2:05:29] these people? They they become extinct.
[2:05:32] There's no more to them."
[2:05:35] Listen now. The soul goes, the spirit
[2:05:38] goes, the life goes, the body goes, the
[2:05:42] thoughts go, the memory goes, and there
[2:05:45] will be no more thoughts of even evil or
[2:05:48] it forever for in happened in glory.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; The thoughts go, the memories go,
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; everything goes, the soul goes,
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; the spirit goes. So they become extinct.
[2:06:06] And I thought in terms of what I wanted
[2:06:07] to say to you today,
[2:06:11] here's men get so deeply concerned with
[2:06:14] all of these things and want to reverse
[2:06:16] them. One of the things the Red Cross
[2:06:20] just gave an announcement this last week
[2:06:22] and the Red Crescent which is equal to
[2:06:25] the Red Cross
[2:06:27] and they said on their news said every
[2:06:30] year they choose one major disaster that
[2:06:34] happened in that given year
[2:06:38] and set it forth as a
[2:06:42] as a emblem or
[2:06:46] uh
[2:06:47] something they want to hold before the
[2:06:49] people
[2:06:52] in stark reality to their work. What
[2:06:55] what their work is
[2:06:58] humanitarian
[2:07:00] and to try I also heard just prior to
[2:07:04] this that they have actually run out of
[2:07:06] resources
[2:07:08] because there have been so much disaster
[2:07:11] in the world
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; and people have become donation weary.
[2:07:16] Yes.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Hard to continue to give because there's
[2:07:20] so many directions to give and from the
[2:07:23] tsunami to Katrina to the tornadoes to
[2:07:28] the floods and to the fires. They said
[2:07:32] yesterday California is literally on
[2:07:34] fire. It's the worst they've had in
[2:07:37] generations.
[2:07:39] They have said also that the
[2:07:44] that the stock exchange has hit its
[2:07:47] lowest lowest spot
[2:07:51] in uh June, the worst June it's had
[2:07:55] since the Great Depression.
[2:07:58] You know, there's a lot of things that
[2:08:00] are taking place right now
[2:08:03] at this time.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we could speak about all the
[2:08:07] pressure that is being applied to Israel
[2:08:10] and the President Bush attempting to see
[2:08:13] that they get some kind of a peace pack
[2:08:16] done before he has to leave office.
[2:08:20] But one of the things that
[2:08:23] occupies
[2:08:25] and and the Red Cross has made it the
[2:08:29] international statement. Not a single
[2:08:34] not a single disaster
[2:08:36] but they said that this year is the year
[2:08:39] of AIDS
[2:08:42] and they have taken and said both the
[2:08:45] red crescent and the red cross AIDS will
[2:08:50] be their focal point.
[2:08:54] They went on to say, and I have
[2:08:56] confirmed it also elsewhere,
[2:08:59] since 1981, when it really became more
[2:09:03] known and identified,
[2:09:06] there have been, and I want you to try
[2:09:07] to absorb these numbers, 25 million
[2:09:12] people have died from AIDS.
[2:09:20] 33.2
[2:09:23] million
[2:09:24] are living with it at this time.
[2:09:30] And another report said 39
[2:09:33] million.
[2:09:36] That's an entire that's larger than many
[2:09:39] nations. There are many nations that
[2:09:42] don't have that kind of population.
[2:09:46] Said two and a half million children
[2:09:50] and newly affected in last year alone.
[2:09:53] 207
[2:09:55] was 2.5 million newly appointed newly
[2:09:59] affected I should say.
[2:10:03] What I'm saying is that and I'm not here
[2:10:06] to speak at length about it but they
[2:10:09] have said that
[2:10:12] some nations in Africa have lost a
[2:10:16] entire generation
[2:10:18] because of the youth and the young
[2:10:20] people who have been affected and some
[2:10:22] been born with it. Some of the nations
[2:10:24] have lost an entire generation that's
[2:10:27] just been taken right out of their whole
[2:10:29] society.
[2:10:31] There was not young men and young women
[2:10:33] to grow into adulthood and to start
[2:10:36] families and to live an productive life.
[2:10:44] Believe it or not, friends, it's a mass
[2:10:47] that is a mass extinction.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; That is a on a mass scale something
[2:10:55] that's happening. And I'll tell you
[2:10:57] furthermore, they can have all the movie
[2:10:58] industry they want. They can have all
[2:11:00] the Bill Gates they want. They're not
[2:11:02] going to reverse this one.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; So, we can talk all about all about the
[2:11:10] species and we can take get all taken up
[2:11:12] with, you know, all the toxins and
[2:11:14] everything else that's going into space
[2:11:15] and what's happening there.
[2:11:19] Let me bring this on down home.
[2:11:23] Can you imagine for a moment
[2:11:27] and just grasp for a moment the cost
[2:11:33] that cost in dollars, the cost in
[2:11:35] productivity, the cost to society,
[2:11:40] the cost of the lost
[2:11:43] skilled people,
[2:11:46] gifted people
[2:11:49] that this demon
[2:11:51] is taking out of out of life.
[2:11:58] It's indeed a tragedy.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; And they may say it'd be leveling out or
[2:12:08] it's increasing. That is that's
[2:12:10] irrelevant to me. Just absolutely
[2:12:13] irrelevant. But I can tell you that the
[2:12:16] the that the world has become a very
[2:12:18] very concerned place. This friends
[2:12:23] happens to be, let me jar you. This is
[2:12:25] the world that God has called you to
[2:12:29] express him his holiness.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; His salvation. This is the world.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; I don't care what what your place in
[2:12:40] life is, what kind of work you're going
[2:12:43] to do tomorrow morning, what desk you go
[2:12:45] to, or what machine you lay your hand
[2:12:48] to.
[2:12:50] Please hear me. That is not your purpose
[2:12:53] in this life.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Your purpose is what God has done for
[2:12:57] you. And why you're here in the service
[2:12:59] this morning is to hear these words and
[2:13:02] discover what your real purpose is in
[2:13:04] life and go out these doors and say,
[2:13:06] "God, turn me loose.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; I come here to be a witness." And I have
[2:13:13] been empowered
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit who is the author of
[2:13:19] this word and he's the author of this
[2:13:21] message.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; God give me strength and God give you a
[2:13:25] heart to believe it.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; God give you something. God give you a
[2:13:28] charge from heaven. God send the fire of
[2:13:31] God into your bosom and light these
[2:13:34] words that you'll never forget these
[2:13:37] words. You're not called here to be just
[2:13:39] a a workman or whatever more, but you've
[2:13:42] been called according to the purpose of
[2:13:44] God, according to his purpose, according
[2:13:47] to his will.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; For his reason,
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:02] going to be closing in a few moments,
[2:14:04] but I still have a couple things to get
[2:14:06] out get out.
[2:14:10] A lot of people sitting in churches
[2:14:13] and they've been contacted one way or
[2:14:15] another. They've been raised within a
[2:14:17] certain family and so they're in
[2:14:19] churches.
[2:14:21] You're very different. Not because I'm
[2:14:22] telling you you're very different, but
[2:14:25] this whole thing this whole thing that
[2:14:27] happened with the message is completely
[2:14:29] different. Because when God when God
[2:14:33] pays a special visitation talk about
[2:14:36] this which he poured out from himself
[2:14:39] and it came all down through the
[2:14:40] testament Christ was in it. It was
[2:14:43] called Christ. It was called Christ.
[2:14:46] I'll bring you back two two weeks ago.
[2:14:48] Christ was in Abraham. The prophet never
[2:14:51] said Jesus was in Abraham. Said Christ
[2:14:53] was in Abraham. Christ was in Moses.
[2:14:56] Christ was in Joseph. Christ was all the
[2:14:59] way down. It was Christ. And he says how
[2:15:01] could he become a son? Only through
[2:15:02] Christ. How could he do this? Only
[2:15:04] through Christ. How could he do this?
[2:15:06] Only through Christ. When he spoke about
[2:15:08] Abraham, he says that was not Jesus back
[2:15:10] there.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus hadn't been born yet. When Elohim
[2:15:16] stood before Abraham and told him, I
[2:15:19] will come according to the time of life,
[2:15:21] and Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
[2:15:25] Where is Sarah thy wife? She's in the
[2:15:26] tent behind you. I will surely come to
[2:15:29] her. Said that wasn't Jesus.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; It was Christ.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; It was this power, this force.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; It was manifesting. It was Christ in
[2:15:40] Abraham's time manifesting in Christ all
[2:15:43] the way down through. And then Jesus
[2:15:46] Christ.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus was born, the Christ,
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. Jehovah, the
[2:15:54] self-existent one in a body.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The anointed one. Others
[2:16:02] were anointed, but he was the anointed
[2:16:05] one. The Lord Jesus Christ. And what was
[2:16:09] he? He was the image,
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; perfect image of the invisible God
[2:16:14] standing here on the earth.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; In other words, this God that desired
[2:16:18] expression now had a physical vessel on
[2:16:22] earth that he could dwell in
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; in his fullness.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; The invisible God, God was in Christ
[2:16:32] reconciling the world to himself. No
[2:16:36] wonder God could not hold his peace.
[2:16:40] When he came up out of the water, the
[2:16:43] voice thundered out, "This is my son."
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; It seemed as though God couldn't hold it
[2:16:50] any longer. This is what God had been
[2:16:53] waiting for. He had flowers and
[2:16:55] dinosaurs and all of these things in the
[2:16:57] heavens and the galaxies and all these,
[2:16:59] but now was a focal point. His personal
[2:17:02] presence had reached the earth.
[2:17:07] Redemption had started.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Redemption had come to a critical place.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; And he went down into the water and was
[2:17:16] baptized. And when he came up, the voice
[2:17:20] spoke and the prophet put a little
[2:17:22] different language. Are you listening to
[2:17:24] me?
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Saying, "This is the first part of my
[2:17:27] earth that I have redeemed."
[2:17:31] Because now Christ
[2:17:34] was not just one. It was not just the
[2:17:36] self-existent one coming on down through
[2:17:38] Abraham and Moses and all the rest of
[2:17:42] but now it was the Christ
[2:17:45] God in a body
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; and the body was a body of the earth.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; It was of the earth.
[2:17:57] That's why it said of him he should not
[2:17:59] see corruption.
[2:18:01] That earth could not go back to
[2:18:03] corruption.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; And that is why when they went back, oh
[2:18:09] my goodness, I hope I can preach and I
[2:18:11] hope you can listen. That's why when
[2:18:12] they went back into the tomb, his body
[2:18:15] was gone.
[2:18:17] [Applause]
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; That earth that made up his body was not
[2:18:22] laying in the tomb. It was gone. It was
[2:18:25] changed.
[2:18:30] what he ate, what his mother ate in
[2:18:32] potatoes or cabbage or whatever more
[2:18:34] they eat over there and nourished his
[2:18:36] body, it came out of the earth. She took
[2:18:40] it into her body, in her system. And the
[2:18:43] little child Jesus came with a body
[2:18:46] issued into the earth. Thou shalt call
[2:18:48] his name Jesus, for he shall save his
[2:18:50] people from their sins. And God was in
[2:18:54] Christ. All that he all that he poured
[2:18:57] out all through the ages now was poured
[2:18:59] into that one person Jesus Christ
[2:19:04] [Applause]
[2:19:05] with different blood.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Redeeming blood.
[2:19:12] Blood of a new creation.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Blood of a new species.
[2:19:18] A new species arrived that will never
[2:19:21] become extinct.
[2:19:24] Hallelujah.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; He'll never become extinct.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; And God had him here as a savior. But
[2:19:35] there was another reason. Now he had his
[2:19:38] personal presence there in an
[2:19:40] individual. And that one began to move
[2:19:44] and began to identify.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Follow me. Follow me.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Begin to identify certain ones.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; And they begin to follow. What was it?
[2:20:02] It was a super race.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was another group.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were destined for the
[2:20:10] upper room. They were destined for the
[2:20:13] same spirit that was in him.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; That was the beginning of the new
[2:20:20] creation of God. Amen.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; In 2,000 years of church ages and we
[2:20:26] come down to this sophisticated cultured
[2:20:29] scientific age that we're in. And now
[2:20:32] God once again sends his personal don't
[2:20:35] escape it. Send his personal presence
[2:20:38] back to the earth.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; In a man
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; that one was virgin born and this one
[2:20:47] was born in sin but redeemed.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. became a fully adopted son
[2:20:53] of God called the seven church age
[2:20:55] messenger
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; and his his expressed purpose on earth
[2:21:01] was to be one in a prophet office whom
[2:21:04] God could come to and he'd reveal the
[2:21:07] secrets of the hearts but the main thing
[2:21:09] was to come and reveal the secret of
[2:21:11] God's heart and when he did he said the
[2:21:14] first secret is he wanted to express
[2:21:16] himself
[2:21:19] that's his first secret. And his second
[2:21:22] secret is he wanted to manifest himself
[2:21:25] and have the preeminence in your life.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; You're not a plumber. You're not
[2:21:29] electrician. You're not just a
[2:21:31] housewife. He came to have the
[2:21:32] preeminence
[2:21:34] in your life.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; This other is just a sideline
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; just to carry you through life.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; We need to come to the reality my
[2:21:45] purpose is to express the almighty God.
[2:21:49] Don't ever forget this service.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget it.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; I just been so burdened.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Just been so moved. Oh God, take this
[2:22:02] congregation
[2:22:04] and let them catch this.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Let them catch it for once. Let them
[2:22:09] catch it in such a way it'll never leave
[2:22:10] them.
[2:22:18] And God had one come,
[2:22:22] the spirit of Elijah to the earth.
[2:22:24] That's why revivals broke out all over
[2:22:27] during his time.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; And one to come
[2:22:32] and then out from his mouth shall come a
[2:22:35] message.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; And that message is the person of Jesus
[2:22:40] Christ.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; And you felt something move you.
[2:22:44] It was him calling you my brother.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Him calling you my sister. Him calling
[2:22:49] you my young person. It was him when
[2:22:51] that word spoken uh it caught a hold of
[2:22:54] you. That was Jesus Christ.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Calling your name and telling you in no
[2:23:02] uncertain terms, your name is in the
[2:23:04] book.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm here now to open the book. And
[2:23:09] I'm telling you, your name's in the
[2:23:11] book. And that's why you feel what you
[2:23:13] feel. That's why you're moved like
[2:23:15] you're moved. And that's why you're a
[2:23:17] different congregation from any other.
[2:23:20] [Music]

[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Your purpose.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; And that identification
[2:23:37] tells you what your purpose is here on
[2:23:39] earth.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; He loves you, friends.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; That's why he's done what he's done.

[2:23:53] morning. I've been long. It said a lot
[2:23:56] of things. Hear it again.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; I've been pondering these things very,
[2:24:01] very deeply.
[2:24:02] And I felt urged and directed by the
[2:24:05] Holy Spirit to say it in a very specific
[2:24:07] way.
[2:24:09] Take it and hear it.
[2:24:11] Listen to it. You've been called by this
[2:24:14] word.

[2:24:29] if a certain attitude or a certain
[2:24:31] feeling or certain something comes up,
[2:24:34] why don't you put it through the filter?
[2:24:37] Say, will this really express him?
[2:24:40] Will I be an expression of him? I want
[2:24:43] to express.
[2:24:45] I want to be the expression of God. And
[2:24:48] to express the encyclopedia Britannica
[2:24:51] will tell you to express is to put
[2:24:54] something forward
[2:24:56] to bring it into view
[2:24:59] so that it can be seen,
[2:25:02] to show it. And that's what you're
[2:25:05] called for. That's what your purpose in
[2:25:08] life is. to express and put forward and
[2:25:12] manifest

[2:26:15] everything that's contrary to your will.

[2:26:21] let me be a tool in your hand. Lord, let
[2:26:24] me be fruitful in the place you've put
[2:26:26] me. And if I'm in the wrong place, move
[2:26:29] me out. Here I am, and I'm willing, oh

[2:31:08] Jesus
[2:31:10] revealed
[2:31:12] in me. Before we sing that last verse,
[2:31:15] remember how the prophet said
[2:31:20] the world, you know, it shines and it
[2:31:23] it's it's shiny, but a believer glows. I
[2:31:28] like that. You glow. There's just
[2:31:32] something.
[2:31:34] Maybe you can't really define it, but
[2:31:36] the believer glows with the glory of
[2:31:39] God.
[2:31:42] And here's what glows in this world.
[2:31:46] Triumphant peace. Oh, I love these
[2:31:48] words. Is mine.

[2:32:08] If you knew how many phone calls I get.
[2:32:12] People are distressed.
[2:32:15] They need this peace and you have it.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; And if you don't possess it, you can
[2:32:21] receive it.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, if you don't possess
[2:32:24] it, you shouldn't leave this building
[2:32:26] till you do have it.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Say, "This peace is mine."
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wonderful. Peace is mine. I
[2:32:33] claim it. Send now that Holy Spirit,
[2:32:36] that portion of God into my life. Don't
[2:32:38] be distressed. Don't be s seduced by the
[2:32:42] world that that that belongs to the
[2:32:44] world. Let's not get oh, let's not get
[2:32:46] filled with anxiety of the world.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; They have lots to be anxiet to be
[2:32:52] anxious about. But not the believer. God
[2:32:56] is in control.
[2:32:59] Triumph and peace
[2:33:02] is mine
[2:33:07] now. Jesus reigns
[2:33:10] within me.

[2:35:40] [Music]
[2:35:56] deep my heart.
[2:36:02] Lord, at these
[2:36:04] closing moments
[2:36:07] of this gathering, of this time we've
[2:36:09] spent together,
[2:36:13] this is my prayer, my earnest prayer
[2:36:17] that you will take and shape and form us
[2:36:21] individually
[2:36:22] to be more like you.
[2:36:25] Lord, I will be most rewarded if you
[2:36:28] will take these this time, these words.
[2:36:32] Let your Holy Spirit now take a hold of
[2:36:34] the words
[2:36:36] and deliver them down to the deep
[2:36:38] recesses of the heart.
[2:36:41] And may the ears of the inner ear, Lord,
[2:36:44] continue to ring out with these words.
[2:36:48] And how you have desired to make
[2:36:51] yourself known, express yourself.
[2:36:54] Let the individual, each one, Lord, feel
[2:36:57] that special call, feel that special
[2:37:01] drawing
[2:37:03] that that's what I want to do. That will
[2:37:05] be my main purpose in life. This will be
[2:37:09] my main priority.
[2:37:12] Oh God, oh God, take this congregation
[2:37:16] and make it a mighty voice for the
[2:37:20] gospel of Jesus Christ. Make it a mighty
[2:37:23] voice for this message throughout the
[2:37:26] earth. Oh God, let there be many fires
[2:37:29] that will begin to burn Holy Ghost
[2:37:31] fires. Oh God, I pray that you will take
[2:37:34] and remove any hindrance and obstacle
[2:37:37] out from uh within this congregation. Oh
[2:37:40] God, move, oh God, any ill desire that
[2:37:44] may be here. If there's any that hanker
[2:37:46] for the world, oh Lord, show that to
[2:37:49] them even now, Lord. And may they say,
[2:37:51] "Father, take that out from me. Dispel
[2:37:54] it out from me. I give myself to you. I
[2:37:57] surrender myself to you. Here I am. I
[2:37:59] lay myself down. Here I am. Take me,
[2:38:02] Lord. Take me. Take all of me. Take me
[2:38:06] and use me, Lord, as you see fit. Oh
[2:38:08] God, what is it you I know you've sent
[2:38:10] me to this world. What is it you've sent
[2:38:11] me here for?" Father, I pray that you
[2:38:14] will
[2:38:16] just take with a supernatural grace and
[2:38:19] power do a molding in the lives of each
[2:38:23] individual. And as we go from this place
[2:38:26] and as we're dismissed, as we drive in
[2:38:29] our vehicles and are seated in our homes
[2:38:32] or our chairs or our rooms today, this
[2:38:36] evening, whenever.
[2:38:38] Father, I pray that you will draw near
[2:38:44] and may there be not a few, but many,
[2:38:47] many that are under now the sound of
[2:38:49] this prayer. May they become conscious
[2:38:52] of the divine one that's near them.
[2:38:55] Lord, may it be such a drawing, such a
[2:38:57] pulling that they will just give
[2:38:58] themselves freely. Let tears from their
[2:39:01] eyes flow, Lord Jesus, if needs be. But
[2:39:03] at your divine presence, we feel so
[2:39:08] blessed and also needy.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll send us with joy and
[2:39:12] happiness and peace from this place. I
[2:39:16] pray you'll make us fruitful in your
[2:39:18] kingdom. Bless this week, oh God, and
[2:39:21] the services throughout the week,
[2:39:23] Wednesday, Seattle,
[2:39:27] the day of fellowship at the camp. May
[2:39:29] it be a blessed, blessed time. In the
[2:39:32] name of Jesus Christ, protect us, I pray
[2:39:36] in the hollow of your hand. We ask it in
[2:39:39] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[2:39:44] God bless you. It's been a pleasure to
[2:39:47] be with you this morning and
[2:39:49] uh I just believe that God has a special
[2:39:54] love for those that love his word, want
[2:39:57] to express him. May you have a glorious,
[2:40:00] victorious week. Jesus name, you're
[2:40:03] dismissed. Amen. God bless you.
