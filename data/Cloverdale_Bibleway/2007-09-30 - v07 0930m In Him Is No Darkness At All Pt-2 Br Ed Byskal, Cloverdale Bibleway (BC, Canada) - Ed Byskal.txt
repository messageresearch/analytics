And uh as well, there's a a lady by the name of Nagar uh been diagnosed with thyroid cancer and uh doesn't attend the church. called and asked for prayer. And also Russ Hayden has uh found a spot on his lung and is in need of salvation and want to pray for him this morning that God would touch him. Amen. Speak to his heart. If you've got a need this morning, regardless of what it would be, you just lift it before the Lord this morning as we go to prayer. I'm going to ask our brother Tom Brady to come and open the service in a word of prayer. over the top. Hallelujah. Lord, as the songwriter is pen, touching Jesus is all that really matters. And so, Lord, by faith, we reach out to you this morning, saying, "Lamb of God, meet our need." As brother Rod has read these requests, Lord, there's needy souls, needy of a touch from the master, for you are the great healer, Lord God. And we're asking for these ones that are in need, Lord. and less you intervene, they'd go off into another realm, Lord, not knowing you. But we pray that you'll move on the scene, Lord, that you would save not only or deliver not only their body, but the soul that beats deep within. We're asking, God, that you will save them, that they'll look to you, lamb of God, their creator, their savior, their everything, their all and all. And so Lord, not only these requests, but those that are standing here, I'm sure we could all lift up our hearts and hands and say, "Lord, I am needy of you. Needy that you pass by my way." Like that little woman, Lord, that crawled over the disciples to get to your hem. I pray, Lord, that there will be faith within us that could reach within the veil and say, "Lord, meet my need and meet the hunger of my soul. will meet the longing that is deep within. And Father, we'll be sure to give you all glory. And those that have joined us on the way of the internet, we pray that you'll also meet the need. Lord God, that you will intervene and you will speak, you will deal, and you will meet every need. And Father, as our pastor will come, we're asking you'll anoint the men of God. Speak. We're waiting to hear what the spirit would say to the church this morning. And so Lord, we say speak to us, Lord, and let our ears be open. And may God, you revelate your people and stir us and stimulate us is my prayer. Meet us, Lord, in a special way. And Father, we're asking now you take control of the service. Praying God you be glorified through it all. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. And you may be seated. I want to welcome everyone here and uh those that are visiting. We just want to extend a real warm welcome to you and trust you to enjoy yourself with us in the presence of God this morning. For those that are listening in on the internet, we're real happy to have you as part of the congregation uh as well this morning. Uh we got a testimony uh from brother Andrew Novacowski. Uh we prayed for healing a daughter of friends from Victoria. She had a sister similar type of cancer to sister Vanessa. She's now free of cancer and the friends wanted just to say thank you to the church for prayer. Amen.

Let's just thank him. Oh Lord Jesus, we thank you for the sacrifice, forgiving yourself, oh God, spilling out your life, giving us this, giving us this reconciliation, bringing redemption to us, hopeless, lost, born in sin, and chapen iniquity. And you reconciled us to yourself. You took your great arms of love and have embraced us, brought us in close to your bosom. As a father, you have carried us in your bosom. As a shepherd, you've carried the lambs, those that have been injured, those that have been wounded, those that have strayed. You sought after them, Lord, and sought after us. Oh God, we're standing here today with thanksgiving in our heart. Our hearts are overflowing. We're trembling inside, Lord, just knowing your presence is here with us. And I pray it'll be such a reality, oh God, that there won't be one person able to escape that divine nearness. I pray, oh father, you'll take every &gt;&gt; every spirit of attempt to hinder us, Lord. And may every man, woman, and child be free to worship you in spirit and in truth. Bless your children, bless your bride, I pray, know Lord, now take us in your hand as we soon will approach your word in Jesus Christ's name and for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful day. &gt;&gt; So just a such a blessing to hear that God has moved on the scene for our brother Ron Spencer. I was cautious as I spoke to you over the over the last number of days about brother Ron while he was in the hospital because we uh some of the ministers were receiving some very very up-to-date information on a daily basis and it wasn't very long ago just about a week ago that it was looking very very dim and our brother Ron could have slipped away from us in mo in a moment's time. But uh in about 24 hours there was a a complete turnaround about 24 hours and he opened his eyes and began to speak and began to smile and uh and then they did an operation of course to uh do some skin graft and it went uh it went well but healing and I know many were praying. I know this church was praying because we have a special love for him and his wife, Sister Connie. And as I was speaking to Sister Connie when brother Ron was not able to communicate, I just I wanted to encourage you. There was one day that she came very heavy on my heart and I called their home and she had the home line uh forwarded to her cell phone and she was sitting as bedside or I'm sorry she was on her way from one hospital to the other and uh I just felt that she really needed encouraging and and I I also just talked about the camp. I said, "We we've uh negotiated a we're negotiating on a camp on a Mount Baker camp." And I said, "You tell Brother Ron he's going to preach in that camp." So I I I don't know whether I was saying that presumptuously or in faith, but I said it anyway. And uh she said, "I'll tell him that." So we're real thankful for uh what God has done. caretakers will be coming to the home to um to do what they need to do. And uh we have no, in case you're asking or wondering, we have no word uh they have released no information as far as uh what medical costs there may be. They are covered by insurance and uh so they have said nothing about any medical costs even though they have in there has been inquiry So, we will just say to you that uh when that moment comes and uh and we're made aware of it, we we'll certainly inform you here at the church because we would want to if they're left with a financial burden, we would want to do our part as well. So, we thank you for that. Um starting next Sunday, we're going to uh go back to two services. That'll be the first Sunday in October. It'll be Thanksgiving here on the Canadian side and I'm very very cognizant, very aware, very sensitive that the borders may be unduly uh, you know, heavy heavy traffic at that time and you'll just have to deal with it the best you can. But I feel that uh there's a it's Thanksgiving on the Canadian side, not on the US side. But I feel it would be uh we just wouldn't be doing what we should do without having a Thanksgiving uh a time when we can have a Thanksgiving service. And I think that that's a a good time to do it. So we'll be starting with two services each Sunday. And then we're going to be very very conscious also very aware of of the weekends and the time. And I I'm I'm I'm following it. For all of you that are on the US side, I can tell you that it's been a heavy burden on my heart for quite a long time and we're watching it very very carefully. Uh and we understand about the construction that's going to be taking place and and the lanes that are going to be closed at Blaine. And we'll just have to say we did actually a spreadsheet uh and brother Tom Frey, we thank him for that. Uh we asked and and pulled quite a number of people and asked them to keep track of how many how long they stayed at the border each way and which service and which days. So I actually have it on a spreadsheet. We put quite a bit of effort into this and I've noticed for the most part it's 15 minutes, 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes and u so we're going to watch it and and very very carefully. Uh we do not know. Oh, I will just uh say this about the camp. Uh things are moving in a positive direction. Uh the sellers have had to get a little bit of an extension because they needed to do a little further work. Uh and uh all I can say to you as a congregation so that I want you to know I think things are moving in a in a positive direction and we will know a lot more in in just a short time in m perhaps another couple weeks. But I say that because it's part of my comments regarding the border and regarding uh if things became really really difficult, at least we have a window because if the Lord sees that we get the camp, we have a very very fine uh chapel auditorium there that will handle 300 people very comfortably and even more. So if we needed to have a service there, wanted to have a service and use that and use that facility, it'll be at least available to us providing the providing we move forward with the camp. And uh we uh we were required to put some extra funds down on the weekend to do our part and so we have done that. And that is why I wanted to say that everything has moved. There's no no negative at this point. I want to just say a word of of thanks to our trustees. They have worked hard, very very hard. This congregation, you'll never know what's really involved in uh trying to achieve something like this. But if God should give us some time, this congregation and believers, we could say perhaps worldwide could be very very benefited and would be benefited by having a place that is a retreat for believers. A place where they could go where our young people and your young people, you may have them as small children around you now, but they're going to be teenagers one day. and uh and and the young people in this congregation have said to us that those were the finest meetings we've ever been at. But uh like brother Tim Prud, they have a meeting of young people that are senior young people probably from 15 or 16 years on up into their maybe mid or 20s and they gather about 420 or 430 young people. They have young people's gatherings in in Belgium and in Europe and they fly from America and Canada to go over there because it's it's actually the bride of Jesus Christ can only really have full fellowship with the bride. &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh and and that's why I think it's it's not family camp that I'm thinking of just only. Do you know that ministers and I'm one ministers I've thought many times where could I go where I can just get alone and get away and have a place where I can just retreat and kind of recover and have a place or maybe several ministers or or a few families. Well, if the Lord gives us this place, it opens up a tremendous uh opening for believers everywhere. I want to thank you for your prayers. I want to thank especially our brother Chris Peterson. You have been a tremendous tremendous help and assistance to myself and I know all the trustees and the congregation and believers everywhere. Brother John Briner has worked very very diligently and brother Tom Ray has really these these brothers have really spent a lot of time. You pray for me you can hear that I'm horsearo but soon as I get over these announcements and start preaching we'll be okay. God bless you. We can do all of these things, but if we if he doesn't build the house, &gt;&gt; we all we all labor in vain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says if the watchman, you know, he watches in vain if God's not in it. &gt;&gt; And that's just precisely the way it is. And I I believe that you you know the scripture real well. I know that you're standing, but so am I. Don't forget that. Except the Lord build a house, they labor in vain that build it. Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh, but in vain. So, I can be awake and we you you know, you can watch over your house as fathers and parents, but if if if God doesn't watch the city, if God doesn't watch the house, if God doesn't watch the church, if God doesn't watch over the bride, we're we're in awakened vain. I I don't believe we're in vain. Amen. I want to I wanted to sing. We only have one service today, so we'll just have two at once. I want to sing this is your house. &gt;&gt; Just the chorus. This is your house. Let's just offer it to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is your house. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is your house. Holy house of prayer where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their cares. This is your house. This is your house. Oh, let's invite him. Come and dwell. This is your house. Oh father come and this is your house. In the holy house of prayer where the stand their burdens and their cares. This is your house. This is your house. Oh come and dwell. God bless you. You're a wonderful congregation and we have an invisible congregation. They're wonderful, too. &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in your Bibles, please. We're going to read three places. Genesis uh 1:es 1-4. Then we will be reading in Matthew the 4th chapter verses 12-15. And we'll be reading in Revelation 22:14 down to 17. And if you were really alert, you gather that we are starting in the beginning of the Bible. We're reading in the middle and we're reading at the end. And a very specific purpose. All right. God be with us now as we read Genesis 1. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. Matthew 4:12. Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed in a Galilee, and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast in the borders of Zabulon and Nephilim, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, "The land of Zabulon and the land of Nephilim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee, of the Gentiles, else. I believe I there's another scripture I had written down there. Just give me a moment, please. The people, the people which verse 16, the people which sat in darkness saw a great light. And to them which sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up. And from that time Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." And then I want to read in Revelation 22 starting with verse 14 down to 17. Blessed are they which do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and wararm mongers, and murderers, and idoltors, and whosoever loveth, and maketh a lie. I, Jesus, sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright and morning star. &gt;&gt; And the spirit and the bride say come. Let him that heareth say come. Let him that is a thirst come. And whosoever will let him come and take of the water of life freely. God bless his word and bless you as you have your saints. Our first reading, God separated the light from the darkness. In our second reading, it was the same. Jesus Christ uh came at this particular season and when he had heard that John was cast into prison and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum that the scripture might be fulfilled that the Gentiles would see a great light and light always separates darkness from light and that is what happened when Jesus Christ as a son of manifested himself. Darkness was separated from light. And in the end, it says, "They that do his commandments, they may have right to the tree of life and enter through the gates into the city." And there's another separation because and it's a final separation. a final separation where the children of light enter in and have a right to the tree of life and those that remain outside the final separation of light and darkness and that is where I'm going to be coming from today. In the beginning, God separated light from darkness. In the end of the Bible, he separates light from darkness. In the message shalom, brother Brandham refers, and this is his New Year's service. The difference he's speaking, the difference is just like it was in the beginning. There was gross darkness upon the earth. The spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and said, "Let there be light." And God separated the light from the darkness. And I believe I have it highlighted in red. And I believe that we are now living in that hour again when God is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest. And here we are. He went on to say, "The church, the reason I'd say shalom to them is because that it's God's peace." I have some slides that I I want to show from this quote and I want to go through it with you. Okay, I want you to follow this thought and I'm going to take my time with this. says, "The reason I'd say shalom to them is because it's God's peace." Talking about shalom. We're looking forward to the breaking of a new day. until there is something great laying ahead of us. Now the the context is peace. The reason I would say shalom is because shalom is God's peace. Now, now he's approaching why the reason I would say shalom is because it's the breaking of a new day. And day refers to daybreak refers to light coming on the earth, warmth coming on the earth, and life coming on the earth. And that's the reason why we'd say shalom. There's no reason to say shalom if there's no light. If there's no daybreak happening, if there's no light coming, if there's no warmth from the sun coming on the earth, I'm talking about this earth &gt;&gt; that's sitting in these seats today. If there's no light arising, if there's no daybreak coming, if there's no sun arising, if there's no man here that can turn on the light, &gt;&gt; there's no reason to say shalom. &gt;&gt; It it's just an empty word. Oh, shalom. Peace. Peace. And then we say, where's the peace? &gt;&gt; Where's the life? Where is the light? I still stumble around in this confusion. There' be no reason to say, "But the prophet is saying the reason why I say shalom is because the day is breaking. &gt;&gt; There's a new day breaking." He knew it. It was prophetic. &gt;&gt; And we're looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there's something great laying ahead of us. And this is what is great. The pressing coming of the great light. And now we can see it breaking over the horizontal realm. And some may say, well, I think that he meant horizon. No, he said horizontal. And you can look, it's a very proper word. It's breaking between mortal and immortality. This is why he's announcing to the church, to the bride, shalom. It's a new day. There's light coming, a breaking between mortal and immortality, breaking between heavens and earth, from an earthbound sickness and troubled world unto a bright shining day of an immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal earth that can never pass away. &gt;&gt; It's shalom unto the church. Can you not say amen to that? &gt;&gt; It's light time coming for the believers, but a gross darkness upon the people, one paragraph, powerful and wonderful. It's shalom unto the church. So I say to you, shalom. He said, "God has begun to separate light from the darkness, pressing it behind like he did in the beginning to show the dawn of a new day." In the book of Revelation, we read this verse 21 and 23. And the city had no light of the sun, neither of the moon to shine in it. For the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamb is the light thereof. &gt;&gt; And God saw the light. And he said the first light was God's word made manifest. And that's always been the light. If if God's word isn't made manifest, there is no light. So God said, "Let there be light." Brother Brandham said, "If a fog came, if just more fog came, then he says wasn't God's word." He said, "Let there be light." If that if it is so, then light comes. Let me just bring it down to today's time. We could say Malachi 4:5 and 6, behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. You can say it, I can say it. Someone else can say it. But if God doesn't come behind and manifest that, &gt;&gt; it'll just remain as it is. It'll remain obscure. We say, "Well, when is it to happen? Who is this? Who is this Elijah?" Uh, you know, what is the season? What is the time? And it remains confused and we remain confused. But then when the when the person who's ordained to say that, the one who's ordained to manifest that, when he says it, everything changes because what happens is it dawns. Light comes. &gt;&gt; The manifested word. When the word comes in its season, light comes. And when light comes, you don't wonder about what's happening. You don't wonder about, you know, uh uh what's around you. If things are dark, you hear a sound. You can't tell what it is. But when there's light, you hear a sound. You just look, you can see it. And when you see it, there's no problem. There's no confusion. There's no fear. &gt;&gt; There's no wonderment about it. But when things are dark, that's when things are spooky. That's when things because you don't know and so you're on the alert. But if if it's if you have sight and if it's daylight and you can see then it changes it completely. And so God saw the light and he says this God saw the light that it was good. You cannot find any scripture in the Bible where it says and God saw the darkness and it was good. You can't find that. &gt;&gt; God saw the light and the light was good. &gt;&gt; In other words, the light was pleasant. It was desirable. It was to delight in greatly. It was excellent. Listen to this in the Hebrew. The light brings gladness. The light brings prosperity. The light brings happiness. The light is intended to make one joyful. God saw the light and it was good. I can tell you to the bride of Jesus Christ to the elect of God. You're a privileged people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has given and shown great honor upon the upon his children, prospered them. How would you like to be what you've seen in the world just this last week? How would you like if you were bound to that? How would you like if that's what was being fed to you? Isn't that incredible? You know, we live in a very real world. I wonder if anybody I'm I'm really mystified at what they call music today. You hear it in the mall. You hear it in every restaurant. It's almost standard. Just standard procedure. You can't hardly visit. And I hear that there is no music. It's just thump thump thump thump thump thump thump. Car drives up beside you vibrating my car &gt;&gt; and I can hear it two, three cars away. &gt;&gt; I said, "What is that poor man or that poor woman? What's happening to their eard drums? &gt;&gt; They must be just vibrating. And I wonder why are they doing that? Why are they listening to that? And there's no there's no music. There's nothing. There's no melody. I was in a restaurant yesterday. We're trying to have dinner and and brother Dave, he said, "Could you turn that down a little bit?" And I think they actually got a mistake and turned it up. and we were trying to visit and that's partly why I'm horse today because I had to yell across the table and everybody's yelling. You notice everybody yells today. Have you heard an advertisement on the radio? Nobody talks anymore. Hey guys, come hurry. Right. You know, &gt;&gt; you've heard that. What's the matter with people? Do they you know I'm hard of hearing but boy that's deafening. That's this world. &gt;&gt; You know why I think it is? I think everybody's scared. I don't know what they're trying to, you know, put on a front. Oh, we're having a great time and we're really happy. Isn't this? And then then I've watched them. I'm I'm I'm a I'm a student of people's faces and they come up and say, "Oh, hi. How are you today? What you know, isn't that wonderful? What would you like?" And all the rest of it. and they just barely get the words out just and are on their way. Didn't come from any joy, any happiness. That smile is just as fictitious as it can be. I'm not being critical. That just is the world. They don't have a reason to smile. Don't have a reason to really be joyful because it doesn't come from the place where they live. The light is good. It's prosperous. In the a message tested faith, I'm just starting slowly. I want you to get a real good foundation here. Brother Bram said, "You put a little seed under a rock, put the rock on top of it, but just as sure as the warm sun goes bathing the earth. As sure as the warm sun goes bathing the earth, little germ of life will work its way around the rock and stick its head up because you can't hide life." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now people can hear the same service. They can hear the same prophet. They can hear the same tape and one comes to life &gt;&gt; and one remains in darkness. Can't understand. It doesn't mean a thing to me. But the next one, you know, and even you don't have to understand it, but there's a reality. &gt;&gt; There's something that vibrates into the soul of a person. I don't understand it. I've had people say, I could even pick all kinds of fault with it, but there's something inside of me that is saying yes. &gt;&gt; There's something responding. That's because there's a seed. That's because the author who's speaking this now. The author who's speaking this is the same author, creator who put that seed within you that could is waiting for that voice. &gt;&gt; It's waiting for it. Sometimes people don't understand. They don't even understand what you perhaps believe, but they feel a certain atmosphere. &gt;&gt; They see something and it registers within them. It may even be completely contrary to their belief. And they'll believe a certain set of creeds. And they see as a life represented represented within you. and they say there's a reality. There's something genuine that's not put on. That's not something that's not a Sunday go to meeting religion. This is a reality. There is a there's a peace there that didn't come from a church. There's a peace I can see in that individual. There's a shine on their face. There's something in the way they look in their eyes. There's something just the way that they speak, there's a stability, there's something there. And you know, in an hour, in an hour of deep trial, when everything's just going along fine, I'm thinking of a certain sister right now that I know very, very well. And uh she happened to be the object of a large she come out of a large family and she happened to be the object of their persecution. you're the crazy one. Believing the stuff you believe, believing the Bible and being the kind of person, being a holy ruler or whatever, whatever they said down through the years, but finally was a member of the family, immediate family was taken in death and everyone was gathered over here to a town east in British Columbia. They gathered and in that moment in that moment when everybody comes down is on even playing field. It's not you know what I believe and what I do and what you believe and what you think. At that moment they're gathered around. And the family says to this one who they have ridiculed all these years, you're the only sane one here. You're the only sane one here. In the hour that I'm speaking of when some are invited to enter in, you're invited, friends. This isn't this isn't some pipe dream. You're going to hear it. I don't care who you are. You're going to hear it. One or the other. You're going to hear enter in. You have right to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Come in, ye, beloved of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Enter in. And without are mongers, wararm mongers, adulterers, liars, and a whole host of people left out. That's a final separation. darkness and God's word is doing the separating. And I can tell you that's not something way in the future. That's happening as we sit here today and as I speak to you, light has risen. &gt;&gt; A prophet Elijah has declared, "Light has come. &gt;&gt; A new day has sprung up. &gt;&gt; And I see the dividing between mortal and immortality. between a new day and the old death of denominational years. I see a new day arising in the midst of the darkness that enshrouded Leodysia. I thank God that he gave us a prophet's eye who could tell us ahead of time, light is coming, folks. &gt;&gt; Light is coming. And because it's coming, I say this word and I have a reason to say it. Shalom, church. Shalom, bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Am I going to stand here and say you're not privileged? You're privileged people. &gt;&gt; You can't hide life. So, you may bury it under stones and in the bogs or in the bottom of the sea, wherever it may be. But when the Son of God comes and the warm breezes of eternity begin to bathe the earth, his bloodwashed children will raise their head and give praise to God. &gt;&gt; Listen folks, excuse me for calling you folks, saints. Isn't that literature? &gt;&gt; Isn't that a piece of literature? We may be buried under stones or in bogs or in the bottom of the sea, wherever it may be. But when the son of God comes and the warm breezes of eternity begin to bathe the earth, his bloodwashed children will raise their head and give praise to God. &gt;&gt; And now if you put that in the future, you've already missed it. When this same prophet stood before the people and made this statement, there is a man here who can turn on the light. We're not talking about a son of God in the future. We're talking about a son of man being revealed, a son of God being revealed now. And he was introducing him. There is a man here. And I feel to say to you today without any apology, there is the same man here &gt;&gt; that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; You may be here with some confusion. You may be here with some question. You may be here with some decision that needs to be made. But I say to you in the name of the Lord, there is a man here &gt;&gt; that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; Only believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Does this congregation believe that? There is a man here that can turn on the light. And I think you ought to say that. You need to say that. We need to say that together. There is a man here that can turn on the light. Let's say it again. There is a man here that can turn on the light. All glory be to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Son of the living God, creator of heavens and earth. There's a man here that can turn on the light &gt;&gt; and with that light comes warmth. He said the sun is put here for something and down beneath there somewhere unseen to the human eye is vegetation and life that'll spring forth again because that the sun was sent for that very same purpose. God sent the sun. And now I need to bring something to you. God has put all the heavenly bodies in their orbit. And this earth is in such a uh precarious. And yet if it was just to move some degrees off, we'd either cook and be destroyed by that or by cold. We're in a very very critical orbit. And brother Brandham speaks of it in different places is when the earth moves around comes into a certain position has to be in that position and the same sun now the sun is shining all the time and I'm speaking about the son of the son of god is shining all the time but there had to be a portion of the earth and I'm thinking of earth as humanity now and a portion of the earth that moves into a certain position position at a certain season of time down through the centuries of time and the earth moved in its orbit. The people, there's new masses of people, new nations and people were multiplied and covered the face of the earth. Where did the people come from? Out of the earth. Our bodies came out of the earth. Just a little different form. That's all. Your mothers ate the food that came from the earth and the chemistry that gave the plants and botney life and the vegetation and and the fruit and the herbs and so on. And that's where your body came from out of the earth and it'll go back to the earth. But God brought the bodies here for a certain purpose. But the same sun shines on the earth that has no seed in it. The same sun shines on the stones that have no life and no seed in it. But then there is a portion of the earth that has is has is got seed within it. And that same sun warms the earth. And that seed comes to life. &gt;&gt; And it comes rising out of the earth or rising out of the bog, rising out of all of the muck. And it comes to shine forth in the glory of God because that's what it was ordained to do. in Victoria, British Columbia, where the prophet of God preached, "God has a provided way." Said, "God sends God sends his weepers and mourers. He sends it forth which is the water and it drops down like great big tears as we have today. He sends his weepers and his mourers. We have a dark perhaps and a dismal day such as we're having even at this time and the tears and buries the little seeds which is happening at this moment. And down beneath the ground it goes as it packs down. And then along comes the winter blizzard and sweeps across the country. And the little petals gone, the leaves drop off and the stalks gone, the bulbs dried up and the little seed freezes and bursts open and the pulp runs out of it. Poor little flower. Looks like the end of it. Oh no, it's not the end of it. When the warm sun begins to come back around again. Hallelujah. And the earth moving itself in position. The earth is moving itself. This earth is moving itself in position to the sun. He said it moves into position of the sun. There's a germ of life somewhere in that dirt that no science has ever been able to find. &gt;&gt; No theologian will ever figure out what's in you. &gt;&gt; No science will ever find that seed that's in you. &gt;&gt; How do I know it's there? Oh, just let this earth move into a certain position and let the warmth of that sun, that man that can turn on the light here, let him just shine down and it doesn't matter what kind of rock you're under, what kind of cement or weight you're under, what kind of burden you're under, that life will come out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what kind of question you have in your life and what you're facing with. what you're faced with. Doesn't matter what age you're at. I can tell you whether you're a teenager, whether you're a pre-teen, whether you're a single or a married or burdened or whatever mo or confused or depressed. I tell you what, I would put that I'd put that rock, that slab of depression directly under the bright light of the son of the God. Hallelujah. and let that seed that's underneath, let that life come loose. &gt;&gt; Give it a chance. &gt;&gt; Move it into his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you just stay out there on the on the shopping track or stay out there on the treadmill of life, just going going going, you're not giving a chance. But bring that burden that you have. Bring it into this kind of an atmosphere. bring that impossibility into this kind of an atmosphere. I tell you, there's a man here &gt;&gt; that'll turn on the light, &gt;&gt; this morning, &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; right now, &gt;&gt; let him turn on the light. &gt;&gt; Don't belittle him. &gt;&gt; Don't belittle this son of man. &gt;&gt; Don't belittle this. He's present. &gt;&gt; He said when the warm sun begins to come back around and the earth moving itself in position of the sun, there's a germ of life somewhere in that dirt. No science has been able to find and that flower that flower lives again. Why? It served God's purpose. It served God's purpose in God's provided way and he made a way for it to live again. I was sitting in this meeting but I don't remember him saying that. I was sitting on the platform but it means more to me today over 40 years later than it did then. I didn't remember it then but I remember it now. And I remember it as a great powerful truth because I've read it in many messages and I have experienced it and I have found that this son of man that was revealed under this ministry that there is no darkness &gt;&gt; so dark there's nothing so dismal but what this son can dispel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You think I'm going to preach like this and not praise God? &gt;&gt; I'm going to praise God. This is a reality to me. I've been waiting for this moment. I've been waiting for this morning. I want to give him glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There isn't enough devils in hell to stop me. &gt;&gt; Not enough devils in hell to put a cloud upon this congregation of people and the believers and the bride of Jesus Christ. There is no cloud that can succeed. the sun will shine through and has shone through upon it. &gt;&gt; So Almighty God ordained that the earth would move in its position in its season into position with the sun to warm the earth and bring forth life. In its season, the spirit of God moves upon the earth. Now, as I said earlier, your body, the one you're sitting in right now, was nothing more than some chemistry of the earth before you were born. Your bodies were laying here. Every one of our bodies was laying here when Jesus hung on the cross. And when his blood dropped down and when God saw the blood of that new creation, the new creation, a new life, a new species, &gt;&gt; one that had not come in Eden's creation, this was a new creation. This was the creator of Eden coming in another form, in the form of humanity. so he could be a kinsman redeemer. And he hung there now, a new species. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the life from that blood dropped down to the earth. And almighty God took the abstract title of the earth and said, "It's mine." And you were laying there then. Hallelujah. There were stones in the earth. There was bog on the earth. There's all kinds of stuff on the earth. But there was some earth that had seed in it, &gt;&gt; ordained by the mind of God before the foundation of the world. Before he made the earth, &gt;&gt; he saw the plan in the program. You were laying in the earth then, but he didn't bring you. He didn't bring forth. The spirit of God didn't move on that part of the earth that made your body. He didn't move on you to bring you up at the time that Jesus walked here. He could have, but he didn't. He didn't move on you to bring the part of the earth that you are. He didn't move on you to bring you up during the dark ages, but he could have. He didn't move to bring on you bring you up on that part of the earth. He didn't move you into position. The spirit of God was moving on earth but didn't move on that particular part that you are to bring you up in Luther's time or in Wesley's time or in the Pentecost time. But he moved upon you. He began to move the earth into a certain position when you were not here yet. You were not aware. You were not conscious. And he moved upon that part of the earth. It came forth by a natural sexual relationship between a husband and a wife. And you came forth and were issued out into the world with a seed in you, waiting for the sun &gt;&gt; to shine on it. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be his name. And you wandered wherever you wandered, maybe into this church, into that church, maybe on the streets and in sin in all kinds of things. But one day, &gt;&gt; one day, even against your own will, &gt;&gt; you may have even been antagonistic against this message and against the the the very sound of it. It it irritated you perhaps or yet perhaps you were waiting for it and when you heard it says, "Oh, what blessed thing is this that I'm hearing?" &gt;&gt; I think of our sister Marjorie Miles. Sister Marjorie lived in the same apartment with Sister Lana. I never forget Sister Lana. Some of these testimonies, you know, you never hear them. So, I give little bits and pieces while we go along and I know they're not embarrassed and if they are, they forgive me. Sister Lana had come to a wedding and she was a, you know, she was really dressed nice and fashionable and all decked out with her earrings and all the jewelry and stuff, you know. and she came to this wedding and the Lord gripped her heart at the wedding and uh few days later, I don't know when it was, it wasn't just a few days later, she's back at the church hearing the message preached and a deacon comes up and says, "Lana wants to be baptized." Oh, do I have to talk to her? I'm not going to take her to the tank with all that jewelry hanging on her. Oh, when does she want to be baptized? Now, today, of course, that's Sister Lana. God bless you, Sister Lana. And so, I said, I I'll come back and see her as soon as I finished preaching. And I came back to the and she's walking alongside of me. I remember very clearly. He is right on my right hand side. We're just walking down. I said, "Now, Sister Lana," I said, "You know, I need to talk." Yes, brother. Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. Yes. I said, "No, no, no. You know, I was trying to settle her down." I said, "No, I I need to talk to you about a few things." I said, "You know, uh, I couldn't take you to the tank with all that jewelry on." "Oh, no." She said, "God's already spoken to me." She says, "She, I already taken it off." So, during the service, she had it all in her hand. And I said, "Well, who am I? God's already speaking to her. God's already dealing with her." We took her to the tank and she's never left. So, she's now she's up there and said she's listening to that prophet's voice and sounding out, you know, and and uh the walls of some of these apartments are not all that soundproof. And so, it's actually going through I think I think Sister Marjgery's on another floor, wasn't she? Floor below you or something or above you. Okay. The floor above her. And uh so sister Marjorie thought, "What is that sound?" You know, I wonder what station that is. So, she's clicking the television. She can't get anything there. And she's dialing the radio and trying to find what station that's on. Just can't find it on. So, she goes downstairs and walking down the hall, you know, trying to find out what door that is in. And comes to Lana's door and hears this prophet screaming out, says, "What station are you listening to?" "Oh, just come on in and find out. I'm tuned into the heavenly radio. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's how come those sisters are here. What was it? It was a seed. &gt;&gt; So one while one wants to turn it aside, but God, he's he's not affected by that. He just keeps pulling that person until they surrender. &gt;&gt; The next person, Brother Mil comes in say, "I got to get I got to get somebody out of that false doctrine. I got to get somebody out of that cult." and comes in and God nails him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there's one side of it and there's the other side of it. And somehow whatever happens, they come directly under the sunlight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that sunlight brings life to the seed. &gt;&gt; It's ordained in its season. There came a season. Just hold that now. There was words that were spoken by a man and his name was Isaiah. The spirit of God came upon him and he said, "For he shall go up before him as a tender plant and a root out of dry ground." That seed word just laid there. And Jeremiah said, "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous branch, and a king shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth." One day came this one, this branch, this rose of Sharon. He came walking to John, his second cousin, in the water. John said, "I have need to be baptized of thee. Come thou to me." And this was a very special event. And John baptized him, this branch. I'd like to They said there's no beauty in him that we should desire him. And yet, brother Brandham said three times, I believe it was, that he saw him. Said no artist could ever capture that face. He said it seemed if he would open his mouth and speak, the world would pass away. So for one, it's very different than for the other. I wonder if the brothers would just help me. I need to go down be the 17th. It says a rose of Sharon. If you could put that up for me. Maybe we could just dim the lights a little bit if you wouldn't mind. He shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground. You bring me the next one, please. This actually is a tree is a rose of Sharon. And there's quite a wide variety of its appearance. Of course, he's so different from so many different sides. That's a rose of Sharon. That's a rose of Sharon. That's a rose of Sharon. That's also rose of Sharon. Looks like a bee getting some sweetness out of it. You can give me the lights now, please. So he would come that part of the earth that made the body of Jesus. God in his fore orained plan now must bring this kinsman redeemer. An archangel couldn't do it. Gabriel couldn't do it. Wormwood couldn't do it. None of the angels, none of the ar saraphims couldn't do it. Cherubams couldn't do it. No one could do it. It had to be a man. And God shine on that part of the earth and came the body of Jesus Christ. Listen to me. Many people touched that body and got nothing as I said. And yet a woman just came squeezed through the people and got a hold of the garment, his garment. She said, "If I must, if I may but touch his garment, I'll be whole." And somehow that touch of her physical hand upon his garment and the chemistry of her body was changed and her issue of blood ceased. &gt;&gt; What kind of power is this? This is a creator. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a man there that could turn on the light &gt;&gt; for her dilemma, for her situation. One of the greatest I think one of the greatest lies that Satan uh purports and imposes upon the people of this generation is that your situation is kind of beyond help. Your situation can't really be answered. Your question can't really be solved. That's not true. &gt;&gt; There's a man here that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And nothing shall be impossible with him. Or to them that believe, nothing shall be impossible. &gt;&gt; So, well, that's the way I am and that's the way I'm built and that's the way that goes part of my heritage. I can announce to you, you've got a heavenly heavenly parent &gt;&gt; and you have a heavenly nature that's available to you &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; There's a man here that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; You need to allow yourself, yield yourself, bring yourself into that divine presence and say, "Oh God, it'll take time. It may take some solitude. It may take some evenings. It may take to cancel some other things. &gt;&gt; And thus he came forth and could say, "I'm the true vine, and my father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away. And every branch that beareth fruit, he purgth it may bring forth more fruit. Have you felt a purging? Have you felt a conviction? Have you felt a greater sense of responsibility and commitment that is the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; purging us that we might bring forth more fruit? I say God bless you branches. God bless you, branches of the true vine. If we aren't, where are we? And then he came and announced, "Oh, you help me. You're listening so nice, but I'm so full." There was a certain part of the earth that was laying there waiting, waiting. They didn't raise it. didn't bring him forth in the dark ages and didn't bring him forth in Apostle Paul's time or Luther's time or down through the great men that brought forth the gospel and the Wesley's and the Sankis and all of these men and I could name many of them didn't bring them forth at that time but God in his season brought forth a piece of clay &gt;&gt; that we would know as William Brennham, born to a an alcoholic father who made whiskey in his still. And even that boy carrying water, you couldn't find anything so dark and dismal as that and of a Catholic background just by dead profession. And he's carrying water for his father's alcoholic system. and hears a wind. I tell you, God knows how to get the attention of his people. &gt;&gt; He knows how to get the attention of his servants. And he hears a voice. &gt;&gt; Don't drink or smoke or defile your body in any way. When you get older, there's a work for you. I have a work for you. Never forgot that. Some of you know, most of you know I sat with a woman, my wife and I in brother Homer Brown's church in his office. and she was a woman when a young as a young lady that brother Brandham liked very very much. I said, "Did you know he was a prophet?" She said, "No, he did tell me that he heard voices that would speak to him out of the trees and wind and that something would speak to him. God knows how to get attention of his people. And it might have only been eight or 10 years old and you boys that are sitting on the front seat, but God knows how to speak to you. &gt;&gt; You young ladies, God knows how to speak to you. He knows how to get your attention. You either have to believe you've been born to be destroyed and lost or I've been born I was brought into this church. I was brought under the sound of this message because there's a seed within me and it does speak to me &gt;&gt; and there's a reality that I cannot get away from &gt;&gt; and that vessel grew to be a man. Are you weary or can I carry on? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because laying in the word of God, laying a word, laying, waiting to be manifested, waiting for the son of righteousness to shine upon a certain promise, a certain word. And the word says, "And unto the angel." And here's John the apostle seeing things that would be in the future. And he's being instructed by Jesus Christ because he's the author of the book of Revelation. I Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's wonderful. I Jesus, I'm the author of this. I'm the one that sent this word to you. &gt;&gt; Write these things. I Jesus, the man, the man that's here, if you can accept it. The man that can turn on the light if you can accept it. The pillar of fire that stood with the prophet of God for 30 years and more. That same man, if we put in the past, you've lost it. If you put in the future, you've lost it. You got to put it right here this day, September the 30th, 2007, there's a man here that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; I don't care what age you are. I don't care what you think about your life or your future, whatever more. &gt;&gt; There's a man here, &gt;&gt; that can heal you. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a man here and he's called the baptizer with the Holy Ghost and fire. That man is here. You need to be baptized. You don't want to leave it till tomorrow. You don't want to leave it here for another year. You ought to believe it now. &gt;&gt; Say, "How can I believe it? Who brought you here?" &gt;&gt; Just a mother and a father brought you here. I say no. &gt;&gt; They were only human instruments that somehow collected a certain chemistry out of the earth. That is your body and you're sitting here. But God, almighty God, put a seed there before the foundation of the world, waiting for the sun to shine on it at this time, at this season. &gt;&gt; That is why you see things very different from others. He said, "And unto the angel of the church of the leadyans, write these things Seth the amen." And he says different words here than he has to any of the other church ages. And never uses this phrase to any of the other six messengers. Right? These things say the amen. I'm the amen. I am the so be it. I'm the conclusion. &gt;&gt; You say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the amen, the faithful and true witness. The beginning of the creation of God. I am the new seed. &gt;&gt; I'm the super seed. &gt;&gt; I'm a new generation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm another species. &gt;&gt; I'm the new creation. &gt;&gt; Oh, are you with me? This is the one I'm speaking to. My last messenger, a prophet messenger. And I will send you and you will tell them, you're the last one in my hand. And I'm sending you forth to the concluding generation, the last age. And that same son, the earth was moving in its orbit and coming to this Leodysian age. And in the earth was bodies of humans that will come forth out of the earth for whom this one would be a prophet messenger sent. &gt;&gt; Go tell them behold I send Elijah I sent Elijah the prophet before the great and the terrible terrible day. Terrible because it's a day of judgment. Terrible because it's a day of uh it's a day of violence and wickedness. Terrible because it's a day of darkness. Terrible darkness. Gross darkness. Not gross darkness only. Gross darkness upon the people. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, let's be mature. &gt;&gt; What you're seeing &gt;&gt; is the fulfillment of that scripture. And that's why he gets up in shalom and comes with that diverse message. Shalom. &gt;&gt; Peace. Peace to the bride. Peace to the church. Shalom. And the reason I say that is because God is now separating. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. same as it was in Eden. He's now separating the light from the darkness. He's now he's now introducing a message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what is light? Light is the word of God made manifest. &gt;&gt; Now here you were as seeds laying in the earth. But here was also seeds laying in the scripture, the word of God. laying there for this season, waiting until there would be uh something to unite with it. And here comes a vessel. The vessel that is to unite with behold I send Elijah the prophet. Here comes here comes the seed now born of a man and born of a woman comes into the world. And there's a scripture there's a there's a seed laying there when the day will be like the days of Noah. They'll plant and they'll build be prosperity. It'll be the days of Sodom once again. And the day when Elohim himself must come in a body of flesh and visit his son and tell him now is the season. Now is the season, not only for Leodysia, not only for Noah's time, Sodom's time, but now is the season when a messenger comes in a body of flesh to speak to Abraham's royal seed, his children, and tell them the son they've been waiting for is now on the scene. Friends, that is why that is why this man as you call you a prophet. That is why he had to say so many places, show me the father. &gt;&gt; When we come to the end of the service, he showed the people the father. &gt;&gt; Let us see Jesus, &gt;&gt; sir. I would see Jesus. That's what he was here for to show them who Jesus was. &gt;&gt; That's why he was telling them, who did the man touch? Who did the woman touch? Not me. They're 30 feet, 40 feet from me. I'm at the pulpit. It's Jesus. They were touching Jesus. &gt;&gt; It touched the high priest &gt;&gt; cuz he was here and he was asking them, "Who is this Melkisedc? Who is he?" Not, "Who is this Aaron? Not some other high priest. Who is this Melzdc?" And Melzdc a priesthood. Another order. &gt;&gt; What kind of order without beginning or ending of days? There had to be another order come in &gt;&gt; without father without mother without beginning or ending of days. Who is this? &gt;&gt; And then the seals are open. And later on says there's a man here that can turn on the light. In the message one of them show us the father. He asked the people, "Would you like to see the father?" Think where that piece of clay. He tried to tell the people, "If you only knew what I go through, &gt;&gt; I'm standing here in two worlds." Then he says, "I see a light. And as I look into that light, something materializes and I see a person and I see certain things about that person. I'm able to tell them and one occasion I'm looking in this light and a woman is there says and you think you have cancer. You talk about a cloud. You talk about a darkness. There's people here who have experienced cancer. There's people here who've even been told by mistake you got cancer and put them through test and they go home driving in their car from the hospital from the doctor's office. I'm a healthy, strong man. I got cancer. My life is ending. My children will be fatherless. My wife will be a widow. This is impossible. I can't accept that. Doctor said, "You got cancer." And here, "What a cloud. What a darkness. What a dismal day that would be." And the woman is standing there. She's been examined. She has physical ailment. And the doctors have told her, "You have cancer." What a glorious light. went another piece of clay. &gt;&gt; The doctor came out of the earth and William Brham came out of the earth. I have no problem with the doctor. He's doing his best. But now I have a messenger. Says they told you you have cancer, but you don't have cancer. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for the light. &gt;&gt; Thank God for this kind of light. &gt;&gt; Thank God for what materialized out of the light. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's hard for me to preach. &gt;&gt; This light is so wonderful. Brother said, "Mary, she saw this light and a man materialized out of the light." He said, "I'm Gabriel. I've been sent from the presence of God to tell you that which is conceived in thee is of the Holy Ghost. You can see follow always that way. Then comes this man. He's a He just so full of so antagonistic. He's so gripped with a violent faith. His name is Saul. And he came before the leaders and say just give me letters and I'll do something with these so-called Christians. I'll imprison them. I'll put them where they belong. And he has letters in his hand. And he's on his way to Damascus to get these Christians. And behold, there's a great light. The light is so great. And he's struck down off of his mount to the ground. And he knows that holy divine presence which is permeating him. Who art thou Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. And a voice from the light said, "I am Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm Jesus." &gt;&gt; The man that could turn on the light. &gt;&gt; And the light was turned on for the Apostle Paul. And from that day forward, he saw everything different. &gt;&gt; That which was darkness to him became light. That which was confusing to him became settled. Those who were enemies to him became his beloved friends &gt;&gt; because of the light. I want to go to slide three, please. We remember this word. Just stay real reverent if you would please. Brother Brandham, I'm ask people not to move. And I'm going to ask you not to get up and get out when I start to close the service because that's the most critical time. Brother Bram says we're all human spirits. Don't move like that because it affects the atmosphere because you have a human spirit and it disturbs unless it's an absolute emergency. I'd ask you in our services, not today, in the future as well. When the preacher finishes his sermon, the service is not over. Don't get up and trapes off to the bathroom or someplace. Just wait and let God's presence conclude what he's wanting to do. &gt;&gt; Who was manifested? because the prophet told us and instructed us very clearly. Please watch us closely. Please, I hope that you're getting this. All these words laid here. I can't go through them. It would take us a lifetime. But there were words God spirit came upon men and they spoke. And I spoke through Jeremiah and Isaiah and Daniel and the prophets and then through the apostles and the record of Christ. And was laid laid in in the word is seeds for a certain season. And that season for that fulfillment that season for that word I will say to become manifest. And now even when it become manifest the word I will go through it with you perhaps a little bit in the in the future but to be manifested as I gave it to you last Sunday but I want to just review it with you now to when a word is manifested in other words when this seed is to be made known that word manifested is is to be openly known. Not just opened but to be made known. I want to stop there because the word, look how the word was manifested in Christ. It was open. Jesus said to the people, "I spoke nothing in secret. I spoke nothing in a corner. I spoke it openly." But only a few got it because they were the ones that also were ordained to come out of the earth at that time with a seed in them. And when the sun shone on that seed and the word was manifested, manifested word comes from the he Greek word foss light &gt;&gt; made known openly and it is to appear. It is to shine. It is to give understanding to the mind knowledge not just knowledge a learning but it's a it's a revelation and that's what manifested is and now with that having said that said who was manifested and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness. God God was manifested. Wasn't just a man, but God was manifested. Made manifest in the flesh. What was manifested for the life was manifested. This isn't something that we're isolated from, but life was manifested. and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us. It appeared to us. It appeared openly. To whom was this life manifested? who verilely was fore orained before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in these last times for you. If I could if I could give it the emphasis that it needs and if the Holy Spirit would punctuate it to your heart and your soul, you'd have something throbbing within. I need to stand and give glory to God. This whole thing, God was manifested. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was manifested in these last times for you. &gt;&gt; For me, &gt;&gt; for me. You need to say it. He was manifested. This whole thing, this word, Luke 17:30, laid laid away in history for me because it wasn't manifested until this time. Malachi 45 and 6. Laid in history for these hundreds of years, these centuries, and it laid there for me. You want a real one to swallow? &gt;&gt; William Brandon laid in the earth &gt;&gt; all these centuries of time for you. &gt;&gt; And God would bring him at the same time he would bring you &gt;&gt; because he knew that he was going to obey the voice and speak and he knew that you would hear it and receive it. &gt;&gt; It was for you. That's what the apostle said. It was manifested for you. Can you say that? Can you believe it? It was manifested for me. to whom it was manifested. Why was it manifested? What's the purpose? To take away our sins. &gt;&gt; You got a problem. You feel clouded by guilt or sin. Say, "I can't get victory over this thing." Let me give you a grand announcement. &gt;&gt; Either it's true or this whole Bible is a lie. And we're wasting our time. &gt;&gt; These scriptures were manifested. God raised up a prophet. God sent a message. Tapes were made. A sound went out. And this whole age he introduced. Why don't others have it? I don't know. That's God's business. That's another part of the earth. &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, why? They haven't heard anything about it. I've talked to people. They haven't heard anything about it." That's not my business. That's God's business. &gt;&gt; But then I see people and he does gather them. So strange. from South Africa, from Europe, from the colonies of Canada, from from South of the border, from South America, from Central America, from all over the earth, from up in the Arctic. How does this thing happen? &gt;&gt; That's God's business. &gt;&gt; He shines on that part of the earth he chooses to shine on. &gt;&gt; You could ask the same question. say, "Why aren't these roses of Sharon blooming in the Arctic?" &gt;&gt; That's God's business. &gt;&gt; He brings whatever he wants to bring when he wants to bring it. &gt;&gt; I saw some of our flowers. Oh, they look sad. So, I went to my wife and I She knows a few things about flowers. I know nothing about flowers. I says, "Our flowers are dying and we got to get out and water them. They're dying. We paid good money for these flowers. Brother Vio planted them with along with the the brothers and they're dying. They look so decrepit and made me feel bad." No, she said, "Dear, this is the fall and they just die now." Oh, okay. I felt better. I felt I had really been failing somebody. My flowers are dying because I'm not I don't say neither one of these are green. All of this word, this promise laid here for you in your season. And if you could grasp that and the purpose is to take away sin, you've got a cloud, you've got a doubt. You might say, "Well, you know, I don't like you to point." Well, I have them from time to time. I have them on a regular fairly regular basis, and I have to take confidence and retreat back to the word. Say, "I'm I'm sorry that that happened. I'm sorry I said that. I'm sorry I did that. Oh, God. Oh, God." But he was manifested. This word was manifested to take away my sin. Your sin. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of it. And God's purpose shall not fail. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to go out of here today rejoicing. &gt;&gt; They're going to believe it. They're going to receive it. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you to in the name of the Lord, there's a man here that can turn on the light. That man when he was here, he was 12 year old once. He was your age, Michael. He was your age, Michelle. Your age, Brother Nathan. Your age, Brother Sean. Never reached my age. You might say, "Well, I'm older than 33 when he died. But this man was eternal. He knows exactly what we experience. And the prophet said can be another few minutes. The prophet said that the one church age they wouldn't bow and they wouldn't bend. And the law was such that you either you either bent or you were broken. &gt;&gt; That was the great burden of that age. But he says the great and he calls it the great burden of this age is the pressure of riches. &gt;&gt; We happen to live in a rich part of the world. America with probably the highest standard of living. Might have been Sweden or one of those, but how they judge things. This part of the world is a prosperous part of the world. And he didn't say that the pressure of this age, the great the great pressure of this age, he didn't say would be riches. Said it would be the pressure of riches. The pressure it brings. And then he said he went on and interpreted that said soft living. He didn't condemn us because there were soft living. He said that's a pressure that you got to deal with. It's easier to sit in the easy chair than it is to be about maybe doing something for God. you precious people. And God alone knows how I've groaned over the border situation. But I'll say if that's the greatest pressure you have, if that's the greatest agony you have, God will bless you more exceedingly than those who did not have to experience that. And I say that with sincerity. I say it in humility. We we bear certain things. You wouldn't want to bear my burdens. You wouldn't want to bear my pressures because I have money. I I have many. I cannot go to anyone. I don't go to my wife. I don't have another minister. I don't have any. I have one. He's the the man &gt;&gt; that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; And if I didn't have him to turn on the light, I can tell you friends, he's a very, very dear friend in time of need. I'm going to close with this. This light God help me to say this the way I need to say it. There was people who came in front of the prophet and I read several instances of it. It would do you good to read it. I personally you're I'm your brother. I'm just speaking to you like I'm at home and we're in our front room. We're speaking together. And I like I'd like to just tell you as my friends and part of our family, I looked into those eyes when he said, "You have three questions you want to ask me." And the first one is on baptism. Even as soon as he said that, you'll have to understand As soon as he said, "You have three questions." I was just looking somewhere else. Said, "I was on the on this mountain." He pointed I believe we were on this mountain here and I was riding along behind Bud and the sun was shining nice and warm. And he says he came to me there. Oh, I knew that phrase. I was so struck with it when he'd be on the he'd be on the platform and be in the meeting and he'd say, "He's here. They said he came to me there and I believe you have three questions at that moment. I I looked right into his eyes from about that far. I thought instantly of the scripture in Daniel instantly just flashed through my mind where it says that his eyes were like candles. And I thought that candle not in weak power but in intense I thought that scriptures eyes are like candles with such intensity and I was stripped naked. He said you have three questions. I understand exactly what the woman at the well said. Come see a man that told me all that ever I did. &gt;&gt; Is not this the Messiah? Now you have to hear you have to divide between what God raised up as a prophet messenger. But who was in him? &gt;&gt; Was Christ revealing himself. &gt;&gt; It wasn't William Brandham who knew I had three questions. It was the God that was in him. &gt;&gt; And you need to keep that very straight. &gt;&gt; And the God that was I was looking into. I as far as I was concerned, it wasn't some other sto fable story that came to me. It was scripture came to me instantly. I looked into those eyes. You have three questions and the first one is the baptism and the second one is the godhead and the third one is the serpent's seed and I can tell you friends in a moment of time light bathed in such a way that a thousand questions were answered. I was left with it was as though I was left with no questions and the light was so intense and I have to tell you as your brother as your friend riding along in the car how would you feel riding along in the car and I I wondered because I had these questions and I thought he doesn't believe this serpent seed this is some bad story he doesn't believe that and I'm riding along and those thoughts are going through my mind and I was waiting. I was actually waiting and I thought that he might at some point say, "You hypocrite, you know, you got all these questions. you've seen all these miracles, you know, and I thought there might be some kind of a uh you know, some stern rebuke, but it never came. And then when that light came, there was another man, and brother Brandham tells a story about him, and with this I close. And his name was Daniel Curry. and he dreamed or had a vision that he went to heaven. And when he came to heaven, he came to the the one who was at the portals and he said, "I'm Daniel Curry. I brought a thousand souls to Christ." And will you find my name, please, in the book? And the porter looked said, "I can't find your name in the book." Oh, you must be mistaken. It has to be in the book. I'm a servant of Christ. I'm a minister. I'm a preacher. And I brought a thousand souls to Christ. No sir, I can't find your name in the book. And then in that presence he heard a voice. Have you ever lied? He thought, "Well, no. I've been a truthful person, but in that presence, in that light, yeah, I guess I have. I have lied." Have you ever taken anything that wasn't yours? Well, I' I've I've been honest. I've tried to be honest. But in that presence, he saw things differently. In that light, I guess I have I guess I have taken things that weren't mine. And he saw himself being rejected. everything he had preached and everything he'd lived for and everything he had struggled for was being lost. Said he heard a voice, another voice. He said that voice was sweeter than any mother's voice. said, "Father, yes, Daniel Curry has done these things, but on earth he stood for me and now I stand for him." Why was this word manifested to take away your sin? Why was this man that can turn on the light? Why was these scriptures manifested? Why is Luke 17:30? I intend to emphasize it so you can never forget it. Why was it manifested through a prophet in your day? &gt;&gt; He said, "And again, it was manifested to destroy the works of the devil." Don't sit here and go out from here and give opportunity to the devil. Announce this to him. There's been a word that's been manifested. It has come to light in my day. &gt;&gt; God brought me up out of the earth to hear this thing. To hear it and to say it and to come under this kind of ministry. I've heard the voice and it's been manifested to destroy the works of the devil &gt;&gt; and the people of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I'm not just preaching a sermon, friends. I'm preaching my heart and soul to you. This is a reality. &gt;&gt; This word was this word was manifested. &gt;&gt; It came to light in this time. How could this messenger stand for year after year and service after service? And even as you read the titles and he's gone from this and he drives over here and he's he's just going one service after another taking this little frail body of clay and wearing it down to nothing to bring announcement to you. He of whom I speak is now present. There is a man here that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; Who is this Melkazedc? He's here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's present. He's here now. &gt;&gt; And that God that brought him brought you. &gt;&gt; That God that brought him caused you to come at this season to hear these things. I deny Satan any opportunity in the name of Jesus Christ who's manifested himself in this hour to haunt you and to cloud your life and to confuse you. &gt;&gt; We're human. We have feelings. We have attitudes. Our feelings get hurt. We get misunderstood. Life has its disappointments. Doesn't unfold the way we would like it to. Sometime I know you all have it. We all experience it. We have disappointments. This isn't what I expected. Then we have we're in a large congregation of people here. Sometimes feelings arise within a family within the extended family within the in-laws. It can extend within the family of God which is here as brothers and sisters. And I was very very affected in the last two or three days when I thought of Daniel Curry and I thought of my own life and I was examining myself and I thought, "Oh God, let that light shine on me." And if I have any ill, if I have any feeling that's contrary, maybe if I thought and you just came and said, "Brother Ed, how do you feel towards every I think I think they're wonderful. Is there anybody that you have any misunderstanding with? Is there anybody that kind of grates against you? Is there is there some that are, you know, you have more friendship with than others? Are there Well, do you love them?" And we use this word. Oh, I love them. I love them. Be very careful with that word because someday I said Daniel Curry, not Daniel Curry now, Ed Biscll. Do you love this man? Well, yes. Yes, I do. Uh, you're sure? Well, now when you put it that way and when you put it in this presence, I guess I have failed. Shine on me. Let that light shine on me. &gt;&gt; Let that light dispel anything that's contrary. &gt;&gt; Let that light just cause it to evaporate. Like when you said to me, well, see, it wasn't brother Brandham said to me. It was that light that said, you have three questions. We have questions in life. But dear friends, my friends, my family, there's a man here that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; And I pray that that light will come in such a way that maybe things that you've held, things that you thought, man, it's okay. But let that light come. I pray that light, I ask, oh God, I've prayed sincerely that that light may come upon each member of this congregation. and things you thought were maybe okay in that light, they're not okay. Say, "God, shine on me." And I'll just move into position. I'll just move into position. Say, "How, Brother Ed?" Just by yielding. By yielding. If he speaks to you, say, "I'll do it. I'll do it. And I'll be quick and I'll do it." Shall we pray? Dear father, you are light. Oh, we don't have an understanding of light the way you speak of it. And I've been pondering this for many days now. There's something so lovely and so glorious about that light. There's something so marvelous about life and how you bring it. And Father, we've experienced perhaps some eruptions in our lives. But after it's over, you bring again life and you bathe us with the warmth of your son. Oh Lord Jesus, son of man that has shone in our time, don't leave us, Lord the dismal, dismal parts of the world. Don't leave us, don't leave us subjected to the cold winds of this world. Don't let us to be affected oh God by what we have to deal with day after day in the world in the halls of learning in the schools in the world of business in the world of commerce in just a daily life oh God protect us I pray and keep us on the back side of the desert where you can speak to us Lord I pray you'll bless this people with your presence Jesus we love you and we thank you and we trust you for the rest of the service and what you would do in Jesus name. You can just look this way and I trust you'll just keep in this atmosphere. This is very very different for me. But some lives, our lives, and some point in our lives. I wonder if you just put this slide up. Give me the ability to handle my slides again, please. If we can take down the lights, please. This is Mount St. Helens. Stood there in God's beauty of creation. There it is again. There it is again. The Milk Ravar was flying in an airplane directly over this when this happened. There it is again. An incredible eruption cleaved off 1,300 ft in elevation off the top of the mountain. 1,300 ft. The whole cone of the mountain. ascended into the atmosphere in ash, broken almost into nothing. The eruption of May the 18th, 1980 sent volcanic ash and steam and water and debris to a height of 60,000 ft. The mountain lost uh 1300 ft of its altitude. For more than nine hours, a vigorous plume of ash erupted, eventually reaching 12 to 15 miles, 20 to 25 kilometers above the sea level. And the plume moved eastward at an average speed of 60 mph with ash reaching Idaho by noon. May 19th, the devastating devastating eruption was over. There was a man, this man here. You see him sitting there and he refused to looks like he's making some notes. I'm sorry. I want to go back here. David Johnson of Cold Water, Illinois, I guess it is, at 1900 hours. David did not survive the next day's eruption. Uh he said this Cold Water 2, I'm sorry, at a certain place, Cold Water 2 would eventually be renamed Johnson Ridge in honor of Dave. This photograph was taken May the 19th. They said that this eruption was so great and this is not this is not out of keeping with my message. There's a lot of lives here and I want to speak honestly even if this was my last service. If Satan could he would have destroyed you long ago. Some eruption takes place in our lives. incredible upheaval and eruption. And I have dealt with a lot of people at times like this and they wonder is this the judgment of God or is this some thing that God I let you know that this this God this one this one that is a man here that can turn on the light also this ministry came at this time to set warning before judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. This same ministry said, "I indict this generation." Listen to me, my precious friends. This world that we get so attached to is under the indictment of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; It's under the judgment word of Almighty God. And I declare to you, it also shall be manifested. Amen. &gt;&gt; The eyes of the believer, I trust, shall never see it. Only with our eyes will we see the destruction. I trust we are in another realm, in another place. And I can tell you that a believer cannot be destroyed by the judgment of God. We were saved from the judgment of God. This is what Calvary is all about. He was judged for us. And they said it'll be years or how many years this is such a devastation. Animals were killed, the vegetation, the trees, the forest, everything's gone. And they wondered if it would be how long it would take. The cone is gone. And there comes plant life, flowers blooming out of that terrible destruction. In just very little time, this fireweed is one species of plant life which has returned to Mount St. Helen's devastated area. Vegetation began appearing as early as the summer of 1980. As many small trees and plants were protected by the snowpack on May the 18th. Seeds carried by the wind or by animals also entered into the area and grew. And by 1985, the ridges and surrounding of the volcano were covered with new growth. Oh, I can tell you friends this is this is something you can give us the lights now please and shut this off. I felt directed strangely directed to show these pictures because after a service like this Satan would indeed like to cause some to think that you're beyond the reach. If you're beyond, let me say this in the name of the Lord. This light that I'm speaking of, there is not one single question or problem or dilemma that is here in this building. And I would encourage you, in fact, is I would counsel you, do not give any credit to the devil. &gt;&gt; Don't ever say for a moment, I can't or somehow he can't or somehow I've prayed. I tell you, there's a man here that can turn on the light. There's a man here that can break that chain. There's a man here that can change your desires &gt;&gt; and change the whole atmosphere of your life. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Just want to pray once again. Our dear father, loving heavenly father, you who have brought us here, we did not ask to come. We did not ask to be born in this season at this time, but you ordained it so. We're here to serve you. We're here to show in a real in a real way that we have love for you. And Lord, in that light, in the brilliance of that light, and in the light of even the message this morning, in my frailty and in the perhaps inability, but yet you can take the words, and I pray that you will, Lord, don't let the service just end and people go their way. But let these let these thoughts from the Almighty God sink very deep into the control room of the soul. And may there be faith inspired to believe. I pray that Satan will be defeated on every front and that your church may advance as a great marching army. I thank you for the marvelous unity that you have given amongst the bride of Jesus Christ. Others may see other things. They may see the backward part, but I see the glorious face of the Lord Jesus Christ shining in the revealed word manifesting itself. I see lives being changed. I see souls and natures being transformed. I see your glorious work and I'm here today to give you all the praise and all the glory. Oh God, bless these your children. They're your children through your children. And on that day, on that day, because we have received you now, Lord, and there may be some here that have not made that separation from the world and you have dealt with them. You're speaking to them even now by the Holy Spirit. And you're wanting and causing them to yield. You're desiring, oh God, to woo them and to bring them and to call them from the field of sin, to call them from the hog pan where the prodal son was. May there be an awakening and may they run over the hills to meet a waiting father. Lord, even now, let there be a yieldedness, a yielding, a yielding, Lord Jesus, let them say, I come. I come out of my bondage and out of my sin and out of my sorrow. I come, Lord Jesus, I come. Father, let it be. I pray that you will grant me the reward of this service and seeing some soul come to you. I so desire just another soul to come. And oh God, I pray you'll forgive us. Forgive us our wrongdoings. Forgive us our sin. Forgive us, oh God, those times when we have failed you. And we even you sent a twinge of the Holy Spirit within and we we didn't listen. We didn't heed it. Oh God, wash us. Wash us and we'll be whiter than snow. Granted, oh God, I pray the name of Jesus Christ. We thank you, Lord. We have shine on me, please. Shine on me, Lord. Shine on me. Let the light from the lighthouse shine on me. Shine on me. It's my prayer. Lord, oh shine on me. Let the light [Music] shine. as a prayer. Make it a prayer. Shine. &gt;&gt; Oh, shine on me. Shine on me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let the light [Music] shine on me. [Music] Let the light from the light shine. Whiter than snow. Yes. Whiter snow. Thou wash me and I shall be wer. Is that your desire with all your heart? Whiter. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, credit. [Music] Now wash me and I tell me why. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know the song we've sung it many times. I pray, oh God, let that light may it be that very light that Daniel Curry came into, the light that the Apostle Paul came into, not something you've experienced many years ago, but may it be fresh today. Oh, may that illuminating light, may the warmth of that sun shine on this entire congregation. May it bring forth new life, new vigor, new enthusiasm, &gt;&gt; new love, new commitment, new dedication. &gt;&gt; Could we do that? &gt;&gt; How many want to dedicate themselves aresh? How many want to be whiter than snow? How many want to be in full harmony with the Holy Spirit? How many here need to be filled with the Holy Ghost? How many need to be refilled with the Holy Ghost? Raise your hands to him. [Music] Whiter snow. Oh, whiter than snow. Now watch me now. Now, Lord. And I shouting whiter than snow. Oh, whiter than snow. Yes. I want to be in harmony with you, Lord. I want to be in harmony with your people, oh God. Now watch me and I tell me why no. Feel me now. Fill me now. Oh Jesus. Jesus come and fill fill me now. God fill me fill me with the Holy Spirit [Music] me now. Help me now, Lord. Cleanse me, oh God. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh God, fill me now. Fill me with thy holy spit. [Music] What a son of God who's filled with God. We have every right and every possibility. God has equipped us. How many believe that God has equipped us with everything that we need &gt;&gt; for this generation? He raised you up for this generation to manifest his power and his glory and his victory in this hour. What a privilege we have. &gt;&gt; What an honor. &gt;&gt; Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul. Call upon Jesus to come and fill me now. Sing it again. Oh fill me now. Not tomorrow. Just now. Fill me. Fill me now. Right now. Jesus come and fill me now.

[Music] [Music] Bless the Lord, oh my soul. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're anxious to go, but I'm not. I'm anxious to worship him. I'm anxious to tell him how wonderful. I'm anxious to invite him. &gt;&gt; I just urge you to come into this place. He's not far, friends. He's here. He's here. He's here. He's waiting to make himself &gt;&gt; real and more real and more known, more dear to you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. [Music] Oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, just say I come. Lord Jesus, I come. Lord Jesus, I come out of my bondage, sorrow. I come just as I am with a glee. just as I am. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; There is a time, &gt;&gt; sometimes there's a time in God's economy when that life needs to come forth and break forth from out from under that rock, under that weight, under that concrete. under that burden. There's a time for it to come. [Music] &gt;&gt; This might be your moment. [Music] &gt;&gt; You might even be here and have not surrendered your life completely. Oh, surrender it completely. You might say, "Well, I have surrendered. I think that I have but in that light [Music] &gt;&gt; in that majesty maybe it's a part of the life that hasn't been surrendered I'll invite you to surrender to him even if you wish to come &gt;&gt; and kneel here and separate yourself &gt;&gt; in a moment of surrender and evidence I give myself unreservedly &gt;&gt; just as I am one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me and that Come to me, oh lamb of God. I come. I come. Let's sing that verse again. Just I have [Music] glor [Music] to thee. Oh God. [Music] Let me speak to this congregation. You may not always have this kind of opportunity. This day that you're living in, that I'm living in has an incredible cooling effect upon the believer, upon the red hot believer. And this is not a negative thing. But if we just mingle with the world day after day, which we are called on to do, that we are in the world, but we're not of the world. But if we don't constantly feed, and if we don't constantly hear, and if we don't constantly fellowship, you will just cool off. &gt;&gt; And I've seen those that have cooled. Well, it's been so gradual. just so gradual. I said just the other day, where's this brother and sister? I haven't seen them. Oh, you know, financial stress. Who hasn't got financial stress? They have this kind of pressure pressure of this life and got discouraged and we're going to come periodically and finally don't come anymore. You know friends, I don't say that with a negative to that brother or that sister. If I could put my arms around them now, I would do so. But I say in this atmosphere, where are they today? Where are there's a cooling? It's a cooling effect. Don't let that happen. Whatever you do, don't let that happen. Remain fervent and take take now what you've heard. And if you can just do so, say, "Oh God, and this is what I pray. This is my really my request before God." Wherever it might be, I pray that God will bring you, every one of you, in your own private time or someplace, bring you into that glorious light. I'm talking about the light such as you've never experienced before. I'm talking about a penetrating light. It's not a condemning light, but it's a penetrating light. Things that sounded okay before, they suddenly aren't okay. Feelings that you had before suddenly aren't okay anymore. Things that we maybe would say suddenly aren't. And and attitudes and characteristics which we display, they're suddenly not right anymore. We have a certain conviction. And I say, "Oh, God, do it for us in this hour." &gt;&gt; Otherwise, I'd have to say, "We're fine. We're a-okay." But I don't believe that. I believe that God wants to do more for us. I believe that's why he sends these kind of words. That's why he sent this message. [Music] &gt;&gt; And we're just going to sing and close in just a moment. We're going to sing once more just as I am. And if you want to come and if you feel that you'd like to have prayer, that's fine. We'll be happy to pray with you. But I'd ask you to remember these words and taking and carry them home. And whether it's right or whether it's wrong, but I say to all of you as a confession. I set Brother Brandham's life before me in the last few days. And I'm very gripped. I'm very gripped with the fact that that light, that pillar of fire would come to a man. Oh God, help me to live. I'm glad you sent even that kind of an example that we could have in this day. and the forces that would come against him and the opposition. We know nothing of that. Said, "Oh God, help me to be a man. Help me to be stalward." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help me to stand. I want to stand like one of the redeemed. And he gave us such an example. It was sister Linda Ratif's father that said to me once and we were just talking bearing our hearts as two ministers. We're standing in the kitchen in his home and brother Ratif's home. And now it got way late into the night. We've just come home from some place and it was late late. It was around midnight and brother Ratif he said you know brother Brandham had many enemies but he said brother Brandham didn't have any enemies. That statement stuck with me. Brother Brandham had many enemies but brother Brham didn't have any enemies. I've craved that kind of a character &gt;&gt; that they could have many enemies. We'd have many people misunderstand us. But you and I, we're not to have any enemies. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Just as [Music] Glory [Music] of God. [Music] The last verse please. Just as I am, thou will receive. Just as I am, thou will receive. Listen, we'll welcome and pardon [Music] cleans relief because it's his promise. My promise &gt;&gt; I believe I come. [Music] Thank you my dear friends, brothers and sisters for the respect and the reverence that you've had today. Ask brother Tom if you'll close please in prayer. Precious Lord. Lord, when this light shone upon our hearts, there was a great awakening. And I'm so thankful for that awakening. For there was another group, Lord, that light shone on and darkness comprehended it not. They didn't seize a hold of it. They didn't take that light. But Lord, we're so thankful for this light that has shone so brightly in our hour. Lord, this resurrected king. We take a hold that we seize it. We love it. And we say, Lord, shine on me. Let the light of this gospel so shine on me. Lord, drive all darkness out of our lives. And only let the light shine. And Lord, let us come forth in the likeness of God. In your image is our desire. And so Lord, as we'll go our ways, let our light shine for the glory of God. And may Lord, you be pleased with our lives. Drive out the darkness that we can say, "Arise and shine. My light has come. Bless your people." We pray now in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. [Music] Wonder Brother Andes if you come, Brother Lance, if you could come and assist us with prayer. I'm just going to dismiss you quietly and reverently and ask you not to visit in the in the foyer and just obey God as God directs you to do it. In the name of Jesus Christ, I dismiss you. God bless you. Oh, how we thank you, Lord. How we love you. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
