Um, as a testimony, Brother Joseph and Sister Bobby, uh, after a very long struggle for 18 months, the Lord sold their house. Amen. And they're very thankful for that. [Music] I want to thank everyone that was praying and uh also a testimony this morning from our brother Darren Hoffman. He was riding his bike home from school was hit by a car. Brother Benjamin, brother Darren's son, and uh uh hit him in the leg, struck threw him onto his back. It's a lot of pain, but no broken bones. And the next morning, the pain was gone. He was able to walk on his own. And uh other than a few scrapes and a sore leg, he's doing great. And they want to thank the Lord for that. Thank [Music] uh Brother Milo's requesting prayer for uh Johanna, his wife. She's been told by the doctor she has cancer on one of her kidneys. Scheduled to have an operation, the removal of the kidney on November the 10th. Uh just want to pray that God would use this situation to draw her close to him and heal her spiritually and physically. Um Chris has got praying for Candy Rose for salvation, restoration back to her husband. Uh it's a request for a number of people here who are in need of salvation. And uh uh Sister Sally Dods is requesting prayer that God would continue to bless Sister Jerry and health. And uh I want to remember her sister Karine Clement. Uh yesterday her niece gave birth to a baby boy with a severe cleft pallet, cleft lip, just requesting for encouragement, strength for them that God would show himself. Sister Lorie Lane is requesting prayer for Ava. A lot of prayer. Sister Marilyn Hunts at home ill this morning. Chris Walman's requesting prayer for Kendra who's at home sick with a fever. And Sister Geneva hurt her foot. Wants us to pray. They're going to to the hospital this morning to have it checked. She's in a lot of pain. We had a lot a lot of needs this morning. I know there's people listening in on the internet who have a request and needs on their hearts. If you've got a need here this morning, just lift before the Lord a good prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us bow our heads. our gracious most loving father, Lord, so many requests and so many needs, but you have already provided, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I thank you, dear God, together with my brothers and sisters here this morning that we have one confession and that is that Jesus has already overcome for us. And Lord, no matter what the need be, &gt;&gt; we have one need this morning. That is to believe. &gt;&gt; So Lord, we come to honor the resurrection &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ that is living within us. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we do not look to a God who cannot be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; But we look to the God who dwells within the soul. &gt;&gt; Lord, our five senses lead us astray. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we Lord God fall by the way often during the week. But when we come together Lord and just one God is just a thought away. And Lord here we come this morning together with faith believing Lord that every prayer request that has been made you've heard them Lord. I don't even know half these people Lord but you knew them before the foundation of the world. And you knew that this trial and temptation would come their way. And this is the hour for them to confess that Jesus Christ is the one who will overcome. So Lord, as we raise our hands this morning as needy people, we pray God that as the word will go forth, may the word bring victory Lord in our lives from the youngest to the oldest. Oh God, set us Lord apart from this world. Separate us Lord from our unbelief Lord that we may lay ourselves in the presence and let Jesus Christ as Jesus said, "I do nothing but what the Father first shows me." So likewise, oh God, may we do nothing this morning. No, may no thought enter our minds but what comes from above. Lord, come as we feast around thy word. Take the vessel that would minister, Lord, hiding behind that rugged cross. And Lord, may the living blood speak, Lord, that it may cleanse us as we hear the word. May it wash us whiter than snow. We thank you, Lord, for this grand opportunity, Lord. For we know that this opportunity will be taken away from us soon, Lord. Our Bibles and the books will be taken away in our buildings, but they cannot take the word that has been planted in the soul. They can never remove that, Lord. for that is what you're coming back for. Lord, you come into rapture take away the word that you planted on the earth. So Lord, I pray may the word take a deep anchor in the soul this morning. Lord, there is no trial for a believer who's in Christ for you have already overcome. And we give you all the honor and the praise and thanksgiving. But we remember to thee, Lord, again the names that have been called forth this morning, the many thanks, Lord, that have gone forth for the blessings upon each family. We acknowledge that you are the one who gives every good gift. And Lord, you are the one that removes everything that's unclean. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we lay ourselves in your presence this morning to be washed whiter than snow. For we ask these mercies in giving thee all the praise and the honor and the glory in Jesus precious name. Amen. Lord seated. [Music] Want to welcome everyone who's visiting with us this morning. We're real happy to have you if you're visiting here. And a special welcome this morning to our brother Ron and sister Mary Borthwick here with us from Scotland. We get them to stand up so everybody can see them. Amen. They're up at the back. God bless you. We're happy to have you here. Um there's a baptismal service tonight. I think we got uh a few that are being baptized. So if you uh the Lord's been dealing with you with respect to baptism, um you might want to see one of the senior brothers here at the church. Um there's an announcement the deacons asked me to make and uh that is to please ensure prayer requests and testimonies are given to the deacons at least 10 minutes before the start of the service. Uh there a couple reasons for that. One, so that whoever is leading the song service can read it ahead of time. Um, and uh, so the deacons don't have to interrupt the service by bringing something up during the service. So, um, and I can just say I just put my own spin on it. There's only one reason why they aren't here 10 minutes before, and that's because you're late coming here to service. And you say, well, you know, I got kids. Oh, I've been there. Okay. Had kids. I've leaned song service all the time. I had kids. Had to be here early, you know. So say, "Well, how do you get there early?" "Uh, leave in time." "Yeah, it's real hard. H hard to figure out." "Yeah, but I, you know, I'm so tired. Go to bed earlier. You know, I mean, I get up in the morning, 5:00 every morning." He said, "How can you do that? It's easy. I just move to the Toronto time zone. I actually get up at 8:00 in Toronto, you know, and I go to bed, you know, late in Toronto, but I get enough sleep for myself that in Toronto I'd have, you know, I'd be I'd be doing okay." They'd say, "Hey, Rod's sleeping in." You know, but just you just move your time zone. Depends where you want to live, you know, and if it's important for you to be here in church on time. Is it important for you to be here in church on time? Right. They just get up early, go to bed early, you have to stay up late, you know, it's tough. I know. Anyways, they uh I told them I'd be the bad guy. So, Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We've got some uh sisters who have a song to sing this morning. Sister Patricia, if you could bring the girls this morning. They've got uh group of girls want to sing a song and they were too nervous to say to actually say something. Although they're in front of everybody and they're singing, they're dedicating the song to Sister uh Vidy who's leaving. And so they want to make sure that uh she knows that this song is specifically for her. [Music] I've been blessed with many things. God's been good to me. [Music] I have family and friends who share in all I do. But if I lose it all and I am left with nothing. If I have the Lord I know I'll make it through. He's the only reason I live. But oh, what a reason. [Music] He's the only reason I live. But oh, what a reason. [Music] You see, there's nothing in this world worth living for. It only leaves you empty and longing for more. He's the only reason I live. But oh, what a reason. You may have tried a whole lot of things to find real happiness. But if you look very long, then you'll know that it just cannot be found. [Music] until you find the Lord. And you know the power of his spirit, his sweet Holy Spirit. He'll be your reason to live and he'll never let you down. Oh, he's the only reason I live. But oh, what a reason. He's the only reason I live. But oh, what a reason. You see, there's nothing in this world worth living for. It only leaves you empty and longing for more. He's the only reason I live. But over. [Music] You see, there's nothing in this world that's worth living for. It only leaves you empty and longing for more. He's the only reason I live. Oh, he's the only reason I live. Oh, he's the only reason I live. Oh, what a reason. [Music] [Applause] Praise God. &gt;&gt; Glad you got a reason to live. Thanks, sisters. That was wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be turning to the word now just as we come. Let's uh sing the song that the choir sang couple of weeks ago. Holy words long preserved. Amen. Aren't you thankful for the word of God this morning? Amen. And uh those of you in the choir who know this song and sang it, you can sing it real loud. Help me out here. [Music] Holy words are preserved for our walk in this world. They resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God inspire. Words of life, words of hope. Give us strength. Help us in this world where we roll. The word of God will guide us all. Word of God ever true. Changing me, changing you. We have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God inspire. Holy words of our faith handed down to his sacrifice. Oh, he faithful words. Holy words long preserve for our in this world [Music] with God. Oh let the word of God word of God ever true. Changing me and changing you. We have come with holy heart forever. A single sac. Holy word of our faith handing down to [Music] sacriice for the faithful words of Christ. Holy word, our preserve for our is high. Oh, let the world go. Word of God. Changing me and changing you. We have come before high and the word of God is the word of God you have for the word of God. of God. We are open for the word of God. The word of God [Music] changing you. We are Open the word of God today. [Music] Changing me, changing you. We have come with open hearts and the word of God. [Music] We're going to sing that chorus once more before we sing it. I would like to remind you of the words, it could only change if we come with open heart. If we don't come with open heart, depends on why we came to church this morning to the gathering of the people. But if we didn't come with an open heart, if we just came because you know someone else is coming or because we our wife or husband or our family or whatever more is here, that's not enough. it won't impart and then the service will just be a social a gathering. We don't want it as a social gathering. We want the word now by the Holy Spirit to come and impart to us what we have need of. Amen. And he will do that if we come with open heart. And so just in case that had not been on your mind, let it be on your mind now. I've come with open heart. Lord, come and feed me, great shepherd of the flock. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know exactly what I need. Just take me to that part of the pasture and feed my soul. Amen. Word of God ever through changing me changing you. We have open heart. Let the word of God be. The word of God ever true, changing me, changing you. We have come with open heart so that the word of God impart. Hallelujah. This is our prayer, dear Lord. While we have sung and worshiped in this service, we have prayed. We've had needs. We've brought them before you. But now we come, oh God, with perhaps our greatest need. And that is each one of us bearing ourselves before your throne, saying, "Lord, here I am. I am yours. I've come to be molded. I've come to be cleansed. I've come to be moved upon. We are here that we might be uh set aside, Lord, and for your purpose, for your call. We are here that we might be equipped that when we leave here, we are more prepared to meet the future. Lord, I pray that you will endow us with the Holy Spirit. fill those that are not yet filled, sealing them with that sealing of the Holy Spirit. I pray, oh God, you'll bless each one, not only present, but those that are present now in the invisible audience wherever they may be around the world. Oh God, we're remembering Brother Murphy and Brother Ivan in China. Oh God, cause them to be fruitful in your kingdom. and those that may be listening just now in China and Europe and Africa, wherever they might be, we just pray that your blessings will be upon them. And Lord, that your presence will come into that home directly into the room directly wherever they might be into the room. Oh God, praying for Sister Marge Miller again this morning. Lord, I pray, oh God, that the divine touch of the almighty miraculous God, touch her body, Lord, and do according to your will. For you have said, I am the Lord that health thee, healeth all thy diseases, oh God, all thy diseases. Cancer is nothing before you, Lord. None of these things are anything before you, oh God. You're the God of all might and power and strength. And we don't only pray for these deliverances and healings, Lord, for the benefit of the people, but that the name of Jesus Christ will be glorified. [Music] Be glorified amongst us this morning. Anoint the hearers and the speaker in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you for your prayers. I'm feeling a good deal better and we're happy over that. We're so thankful to have you welcomed our brother, brother and sister Borthwick. And we are uh this is I think our first time to be able to have our brother Borthwick and his wife here visiting their son Jonathan and daughter-in-law Crystal who formerly was Crystal McNeel. And now they have a they have a child. Isn't it amazing how someone has a child and his son daughter-in-law have a baby and causes them to come all the way across the ocean to see us? Well, uh we're thankful too. And now I prayed upon our brother Borthwick to to speak for us next Sunday night and he's consented even though he let me know he didn't come to speak and uh I know that no preacher comes to preach. He'd like to have a vacation. So, we'll just pray that God will make the vacation a little bit better and uh and then he'll be able to share with us the burden of his heart. Amen. So, that'll be next Sunday night. And then tonight, we're having baptismal. Uh so, those of you that uh are going to be baptized and maybe somebody didn't plan to be baptized, if you've not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, now's the time to do it. Amen. Now, we're going to be reading in Corinthians 2 Corinthians 6 and we're starting with verse 11, but I would like to say that uh brother Bram said a number of things about the Corinthians and there's some wonderful just the whole word is the whole word is Christ. Christ is every scripture. But as far as the people of Corinth were concerned, brother Brandham says a good deal about them that Paul could not deal with the Corinthians like he could deal with the Ephesians or the Romans and some of the others, but he mentions especially the Ephesians. He said of the Corinthians, you're you're maturing, growing, but when you ought to be teachers, you're still babes uh needing teaching. He said another place, the Corinthians didn't know how to set the church in order. He said, uh Paul couldn't teach the Corinthians deep things. He couldn't go into the deep things that he taught the Ephesians and the Romans. And he said another place that Corinthians didn't know anything about how that before the foundation of the world they were predestinated unto the adoption of sons of God. The the Corinthians didn't understand that they couldn't be taught that because that's somehow they just didn't have the capacity. And I believe in every congregation uh I spoke to some ministers meetings and in speaking to them I said you know we all have Corinthians and we all have Ephesians in our congregations &gt;&gt; but the the purpose of the ministry if there's anyone here that struggles with the predestination of God and maybe you know it hasn't become a reality to you you know that starts taking people into a deeper realm. But any that are here that may have may still be in the Corinthian church, I say move out of that church and come over into the Ephesians. We're here to move people from the Corinthians to the Ephesians. Don't don't sit where you can't be taught. So, well, I don't really, you know, I don't really grasp that. That's just a little too deep for me or whatever. None of it's deep to the believer cuz the Holy Spirit's here to make it all a reality to you. Amen. I want to speak this morning on the separated life. The separated life. Uh we will start by reading Corinthians the 11th uh 6 the 6th chapter 11th verse. Oh ye Corinthians our mouth is open unto you. Our heart is enlarged. Ye are not straightened in us, but ye are straightened in our your own bowels. Now for a recompense in the same, I speak unto my children, but ye also, be ye also enlarged. And then he goes into the next three verses. I'd like you to notice he's making comparisons here. Be ye not unequally yolked. and that is to have fellowship with one who is not an equal. Be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers. Now he asks the questions, for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord agreement hath Christ with bile? And bal is a name that has been used for Satan or wickedness. Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? We can say with all of those, none. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; None is the answer. &gt;&gt; And that's the point that Paul's trying to make. There is none. For ye are the temple of the living God, as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, sayeth the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Almighty, the Lord Almighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to read a scripture. You can just hold your attention. It is Hebrews 7 and 26 speaking of Jesus Christ as our high priest. For such an high priest became us who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens. &gt;&gt; Although he was separate from sinners, yet he was right amongst them and called the friend of sinners. So yet he was separate from sinners. You may have your seats. And just while you are perhaps want to keep your Bible handy because we'll be using it as we go along. Now in this context all right Ephesians church. &gt;&gt; Amen. In case you say well maybe I'm a Corinthian. Well, we just wanted to move you over to Ephesians. In the Leodysian church age message, church age, brother Brandham said, "But thank God at this moment, this age is not over." He said, "He is yet crying, and his cry is not in the spiritual ears." I'm sorry. And his cry is not only in the spiritual ears of men by his spirit, but once again a prophet is in the land. Aren't we thankful for that? &gt;&gt; Once more, God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul. In the days of the seventh messenger, in the days of the Leodysian age, its messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul. Now, I'd like you to notice these lines. He will speak out, and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the beneficient effect of that prophet's ministry. And they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day, who are mentioned in Revelation 22:17. The spirit and the bride say come. &gt;&gt; The corn of wheat in brackets, the bride word, that's the corn of wheat, the bride word that fell into the ground at Naa has come back to the original word grain again. &gt;&gt; Praise God forever. Yes. Listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age. What he says from God, the bride will say &gt;&gt; what he says from God, the bride will say. The spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; And what they will say will have already been said in the word. &gt;&gt; They are now they are saying it now. &gt;&gt; They are saying it now. The bride is saying it now. &gt;&gt; Come out from among the from come out from among her now and be separate. The cry has gone out. The cry is going out. How long will the voice cry? We do not know. But one thing we do know, it won't be long. For this is the last stage. &gt;&gt; And if any part of it's true, it's all true. what has just been spoken. It won't be long for this is the last age. &gt;&gt; This is the last time. I think we're a very highly privileged people &gt;&gt; to know what you know to whatever degree you know it. Thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Whether it's little or whether it's much. Whether it's been a short time or whether it's been a long time, I think we need to really be grateful to God that he's brought us where he has and we're hearing what we are hearing. Now, separation is twofold. Separation is coming out from and being joined to. I was going to entitle this message that we are we are separated to be connected. And that's really what it's all about. And we can't be connected till we're separated. &gt;&gt; We need to have experience a separation. We have to be separated maybe uh well there are so many many things but we need to be separated from our from our own ways &gt;&gt; and our own in in when we were in sin or whatever more. We had to be separated from that before we can be joined. We got to be separated from unrighteousness to in order to be separated to right joined to righteousness. We have to be separated from unbelief so we can be joined to the life of faith. We have to be separated in order that we can be joined. So the believer's life speaks loud and clearly many different things. The believer's life, your life speaks loudly and clearly many different things to many different people. One thing that the believer's life does say, your life says it, come out from among them &gt;&gt; and be ye separate, sayeth the Lord. Now, I want you to think about your life because your life, I'm going to be speaking about the expression of your life because it is that expression that you perhaps, you know, it's just your own life. And so, you don't think a whole lot about it is this is the way I live. this this has become this just this is what I do. This is how I do it. This is the way I live and so on and so forth. But the things that have be you've become very accustomed to are very strange to most people. &gt;&gt; And so they look at that. I want you just I want to get you in the right track now in the right channel. They look at how you approach things, how you see things, how you speak. Now this says of Jesus that he was separate of sinners. He was separate of sinners and yet he was a friend of sinners. He was right amongst them. So how was it that he was separate? He was separate in that he looked at things differently. He spoke differently. what he heard and how he received uh what he heard and how he responded, how he reacted was completely different from others. And when they observed that, they could see this man is different. This man speaks differently. This man, they they watched observed how he reacted when a certain in a certain situation he reacted. the people would react one way but he'd react a different way and that is why it was so essential for the disciples you know just as a little bit personal testimony when I I found myself thrust right in the presence and with brother Brandham and going with him that was the one thing at a as a young man 27 years old that was the one thing that I it was just I suppose it's part of my nature I'm an observer I observe people. I'm observing you right now. I've I've had ministers come and say, "We notice that you really watch the congregation. You see their responses." Absolutely. Because I don't want to be up here just talking to the air. I want to see I can see from the faces. I can see the way the you know the way you look in the eyes and I can see the very you know the very attitude that you have. I can see what is happening. And if a p if a pre preacher is not getting there and then there's no use preaching. And I watch brother Brandham. I would just observe him. I watch him in all kinds of situation. I want to see how he held his Bible. I never told him any of this. I want to see how he held his Bible. I want to see how he, you know, did he say, "Oh, amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah." All the time. I want to see that. He He never did that. And I observed that. Say he hasn't got a bunch of filler words. He doesn't he doesn't he he's got he's not got a bunch of religious jargon out there. He just he's himself. He just his own life. I saw him in in times when I was I was starting to burn inside, you know, with a little frustration cuz things aren't going just right. But he thought it was just fine, you know, and then go on one hunt and he never got to fire a shot that I know of unless it was just a target shot. Never got to fire a shot. Driving all the way from uh from Jeffersonville and all the way up there probably 3,500 miles. Never fire a shot. Drive all the way back. Have bad weather. I thought, you know, why don't you stay a little longer? Oh, he said, "That's fine, Brother Eddie." He said, "That means I can come again. I can come next year." I thought, man, that's a wonderful way to look at it. I I'm just not there yet. I I think I'm still in Corinthians or some when you have a big disappointment, it's nice to be able to see it from another side. Oh, that's just fine. Everything's just fine. Well, uh, we live our lives, as I said a moment ago, and it becomes, you know, just like common place. But people are observing. They're observing things about you that to you, you don't think they're anything, but they're looking at it. They're seeing how you speak, how you respond, what you think, the conclusions you come to, what is valuable to you, what is not, what's important, what is not important. You know, the fact that you come to church three times a week, that just shocks people. &gt;&gt; Three times a week. I go probably three times a year. &gt;&gt; You're three times a week. You come, you move from Arkansas to go to church. What? You move from Phoenix. You move from someplace. You move from South Africa or wherever it is. You moved here from Congo or whatever more to go to church. You you quit the direction. You quit a good job. You quit. That doesn't compute. &gt;&gt; How does that work? But you were, what were you expressing? You're expressing that you're separated from the way they think. You're separate person. And Jesus was separate from sinners. Right amongst them, but separate. And so now I've kind of given you my theme. We start out. I'll get preaching along in a few moments. The Bible said to Abraham, "Now the Lord said unto Abram, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee." So get out from your country, have a separation, out from your kindred, have a separation, out from your father's house. And brother Brandham said he was he was comfortable there. That was from his friends, his family, and all of these things. That was everything that he knew. And that was his whole comfort zone. You leave all of this unto a land that I will show you. You'll be joined to something else. But you have to leave this first. Abraham now is regarded as our father in the faith. And he was called out into a separated life. Now in the 12th chapter in verse 7 it says and the Lord appeared unto Abram because I know that I'm speaking to a congregation of people that have been called out. Anybody that uh s is sustained I will say becomes consistent listener of the message of the hour I believe is a calledout person. You cannot be a consistent lover of the message. I'm talking about a lover not of your favorite sayings, but a lover of the message as a whole. &gt;&gt; They are called out. And the Lord God appeared unto Abram and said unto him, and said, "Unto thy seed." Now he's left. And so now the Lord is giving him a promise. unto thy seed I will give this land and there buildeth he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him. Now, God speaks to each individual. Whether you're young or elder, whether you're parents or whether your children, whether you're seniors here, or whether you're listening on the internet, every person that God has called. With that call comes a promise, a personal promise. It may not be thus sayeth the Lord. I will do this and I will give you this land or I will give you this job or I will give you this profession or whatever more or I will see that all of your cares are taken care of. It may not come like that. But when a call comes, when God moved upon the individual heart, some of you it may be further back than with others, but it may be recent to some of the young people and so on. But when God called that call, there there's there's like a like a horizon opens up &gt;&gt; and you see something out there. Perhaps you see a life. When many people were called, they were bound by something, shackled by something, shackled by religion, shackled by sin, shackled by habits, shackled by their own complexes, and they're terrible. Shackled. It's terrible to be in slavery. And they're shackled by something. Everyone was. And then and then when the call come, you begin to see perhaps a a a free person. Oh, I could be free. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful thing. I tell you what, I've seen people when the when the realization came on them that they were suddenly free. &gt;&gt; I've seen people, lots of people, hundreds if not thousands seen when the shackles fell from them. And I'll tell you the glory of God that comes upon their face and how they could say as that young soldier says, "I'm free. I'm free. I'm free." That was the only thing that was important to him. Three times, "I'm free. I'm free. I'm free." There's something glorious about being free, my brother, my sister. &gt;&gt; And maybe God didn't say you're free, but but you saw some new horizon. You saw something for your life. It was. And that's God's promise to you. That's what God intended for you. Intended you to be perhaps free or turned around for myself. I was free of my questions. I was free of my uh curiosity that was overcoming me in a sense and confusion because when you when you're curious and you're asking questions, is this right or is that right or is this is this which way do I baptize? thou shall be baptized. What would it be if we had a confusion here about baptism? But it's so wonderful to be able to declare we have a thus sayith the Lord and we know how you should be baptized and that what you will receive after you are baptized and we've received it. &gt;&gt; And so Abraham does something that's very very important here. The Bible says that he builded an altar and Abraham went up out of uh it says that he Genesis 12:7 and the Lord appeared unto Abraham said unto thy seed I will give this land and there he builded an altar. He built a marker. He builded a place that he could remember and recall and he went back to this place more than once. I've spoken on that. But in today's service, I want to especially instruct those of you that God has spoken to recently and those of you that God first came to you perhaps even years ago. I want you to go back in your mind and remember that altar, that place that God spoke to you. We need to put down markers. &gt;&gt; We need to build markers or altars and their worship. The God that gave us that new horizon in our life allowed us to see what we could be in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. allowed us to see things in the message that your blinded mind could not see maybe a short time ago. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding me? You need to &gt;&gt; you need to make a marker in that life in that part of your life so you can go back to it and recall it. And Abraham does go back to this place where he built this altar. You know, the reason why you need altars is because between those spots, lots of other things happen. All kinds of difficulties happen. And it was he had just built this altar and he got going just a short distance. Hadn't been on the way very long. And there came a a a family blow up. No one really likes that. But there got to be strife between his herdsmen, Abram's herdsman, and Lot's herdsmen because of the blessing of God actually. And now this may be a little strange for you, but God so blessed them and their herds so increased that it caused some dissension between the uh the herdsmen of of both Lot and his nephew or Abram and his nephew. And so Abram said, now notice, God has already promised Abram, the land is yours. I'm bringing you to this land. It's yours. But now he says to Lot, he's got such confidence, such faith in God's word. He says to Lot, Lot, just whatever you want, you choose. If you go to the right, I'll go to the left. If you go to the left, I'll go to the right. Have whatever part you want of the land. I'm going to read it. and then I want to come back to it. If you'd like to follow along, it's Genesis 13 and we're going to start at the first verse. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him. notice, and Lot with him into the south. And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver and gold. And he went on his journeys from the south, even to Bethl, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between Bethl and Hi is where he had under the place of the altar which he had made there at the first. And there Abraham called on the name of the Lord. I just want to stop there. There are times in your life and listen to me especially young people. There will be times in your life that it will be very very essential. You'll come to a situation and he had just come out of Egypt and in Egypt Pharaoh almost took his his his own wife Sarai to be his wife. and Pharaoh sent him away and he had he had actually told a partial truth which in a sense is a lie. He said Sarah you're very beautiful say that you're my sister. He did it on two occasions and this was the first one. And so she went in as his sister. Pharaoh almost took her to wife and he found out he was his his his sister his wife. He said send send them away out of here. He's just left Egypt. He's had has had this now and he's just facing another dilemma and it's going to be a problem with Lot and the herdsmen and the finally separation. They've been together now for some time. And so now he goes to the altar that he built. It is very essential that a believer can have have built those markers. You young people, whatever God did for you, however God spoke to you, yet I want you to recall the time that maybe in the last few weeks you stood maybe at an altar in the tent, maybe you heard one of your counselors at the camp, or you've been in the services uh this last summer and even more recently. And while the preaching of the word is and God strikes your heart with something, you begin to you begin to see yourself. Yes, I I I can live higher. I can go further in God. Yes, I believe I can consecrate. I believe it with all my heart. I believe that I can dedicate myself. I believe I can have victory. &gt;&gt; I believe that I can You put a marker there. You build an altar there and say, "I thank God &gt;&gt; that you have shown me this. &gt;&gt; I thank God you have spoken to me in such a way because what he's showing you is your territory. He's showing you your land. He's showing you what he bought at Calvary. And he's opening up your eyes so you can see something that belongs to you, &gt;&gt; whatever it might be." &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, there's a whole array of things here in this in this service this morning. a whole array of things. Some have to believe for family. Some have to believe for healing. Some have to believe for their own life and what God uh not knowing what tomorrow holds. Say, "Oh God, I build an altar here. I'm making a marker here. There was a moment in that service uh service a certain time. There was a certain message that I heard. There was a certain place or when I was listening to a tape, I was reading the scripture and there was a certain moment where you touched me and it seemed like the my whole vision was expanded. I begin to see something. I begin to see levels of glory. I begin to see a a level of victory and a victorious light. I begin to see power in my life. I could envision it. I could taste it. I could feel it. You build an altar there. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You put a marker there. Why? Why, brother Briscoll, do I need to put a marker there? Because you're going to need to go back there. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to go back and recall that. And I've done that. You folks don't know it. But I p I I jumped into my pickup few years ago and I went to have a conference with God and I went alone and I drove for several hundred miles and I sat and just looked over some of the vast country. I just sat there way below me was a bit of a lake and the sun was shining. It was warm and the fall breeze was blowing and I was way down the road from the time I gave my life and this is all I I I felt like this spiritually like that piece of wood I didn't feel. Do you feel any glory? None. Zero. You hear any voices? None. Zero. Have any emotion? None. Zero. just felt like a telephone pole. But I sat on that bank and I started going back along the trail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And all I could say is I said back there, &gt;&gt; God, I know it was you. &gt;&gt; I know that was you. That's all I can say. I know that was you. and on down in my life and maybe some years went by and there was another special spot and I built an altar there and I went back to it and I said and I know that was you. &gt;&gt; And I just begin to go back to one altar after another after another. Each time I said that was you. That was you. And before I got to my feet the presence of God came down &gt;&gt; was with me. That's why I went several hundred miles for that very moment. I just went to have a conference with God. But if I hadn't made those spots as special markers, you could never go back to them. Abraham, your father made markers at these spots. Don't forget them. And don't let the devil take them away from you. They're very special occasions. That's where God opened up your horizons, opened up your eyes and seemed to just give you a spontaneous faith and maybe nothing happened physically, but you just said, "Yes, glory. Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Don't forget the time that you felt such a release that you could do things that you never thought you could do. and you raised your hands to God and gave your life and you said things that perhaps you didn't even know you could ever keep, but you said them anyway. Go back to that place. &gt;&gt; And we'll read on. Fourth verse says, "Unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first. And there Abram called on the name of the Lord. And Lot also which went with Abram had flocks and herds and tents. And the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together, for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together. And there was a strife between the herdman of Abram's cattle and the herdman of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land. And Abram said unto Lot, "Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdman and thy herdmend, for we be brethren. Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me." Excuse me. If thou wil take the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if thou wilt depart to the right, then I will go to the left. And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was wellwatered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zor. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan. And Lot journeyed east, and they separated themselves to one from the other. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards Sodom. How tragic. He pitched his tent towards Sodom. And it wasn't long before he was in Sodom. &gt;&gt; But the man of Sodom, it's important, friends, how you pitch your tent. But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly. And the Lord said unto Abram after that Lot was separated from him, "Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, southward, eastward, and westward. For all the land which thou seeest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever." &gt;&gt; Amen. Abram had said to Lot, "Separate thyself." He realized they could not continue with this conflict between them. So he said, "You separate from me and go whichever just the whole land is before you." And I found it very remarkable that Abraham was prepared to the very thing that God had promised him. He just said, "Here it is. You know, whatever you choose, and I will I will you go to the right, I'll go to the left. You go to the left, I'll go to the right." Lot lifted up his eyes. He just didn't lift them quite high enough. and he saw the well-watered plains of Jordan. If he'd lifted up his eyes a little higher, he would have seen the fires hanging over Sodom. &gt;&gt; Fire hanging yonder. today sitting here. We don't want to lift up our eyes just so high and see the economics the way it is and see my job the way it is and see the life that I can have down here and see the things that I that that this will offer me. We must not lift up we must lift our eyes just a wee bit higher and we'll see the fires of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The believer, we lift up our eyes a little higher and we see the promise of God that came through Peter that the fires, the heavens will be on fire. &gt;&gt; And the elements will melt with fervent heat. That is thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the believer looks and that's what dictates the believer's movements. &gt;&gt; That's what dictates his life. And that's what makes him a different person. &gt;&gt; And he's different then because he's separated. &gt;&gt; He's separated. He cannot see things the way the world sees them. He cannot have the same kind of anticipation. Oh, we move about. We do the same things. We work at jobs. We we pay taxes. We do all the same things. But we do not have the same vision. We are entirely separated &gt;&gt; by the very actions that we live. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; In uh in hearing, recognizing and acting on the word, brother Brandon said, "But the spiritual seed of the living God, though it has to be a sojourer, and we are." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Though it has to be a rambler and we may be, he said it always causes separation. We all have experienced that. He said, "Esau didn't last very long with Jacob." As soon as Jacob obtained the birthight, praise God. &gt;&gt; It called for separation. As soon as he received the birthight, now if you'll notice, please that it was the blessing of God. I noticed you were just a little bit silent because your mind's probably trying to work around it and I had to think about it as well. It was the blessing of God. Their herds increased. Their cattle increased, their camels increased, and all the sheep and all the flocks all increased and there was all the blessing of God. And because of the blessing at that level, &gt;&gt; but the real blessing was God's promise to Abraham, not of the sheep and the cattle and so on. It was the land, the inheritance, a people, a nation. God had big plans for Abraham &gt;&gt; and it wasn't these natural blessings or the there are lesser blessings and sometimes they get in the way but they're not to be in the way. Your blessings are are much greater much higher. Your blessings are an inheritance in the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And those kind of blessings are in Ephesians and you don't find them so much in in Corinthians even though in Corinthians the resurrection is very very clear there. But it was those blessings that caused the separation. You know, you go back, many of you, you had to make some hard choices at some point in time, and you'll find that it was even the blessings of God that were coming to you. And uh and then but the but those are not th that's not really what God has his eyes on. Listen to me, church. God has big plans for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't forget it. &gt;&gt; God has big plans for you. It's not just what you've experienced for the moment. &gt;&gt; It's not just the increase that you may have. It's not just the life that you have here. And thank God for it. But God, I say in the name of the Lord, has big plans for his people. &gt;&gt; We don't want to get buried buried down under, you know, just the cares of this life. And he said that that the birthright, Jacob had his eyes on the birthright. And the birthright happens to be big plans. The birthright is a man's right to be in the lineage of bringing forth Jesus Christ. That is a big plan. &gt;&gt; What what Esau was really saying is, I don't care whether I'm in the lineage at all. I really don't care if I have a part of bringing forth Christ at all. That's what he was saying. But Jacob and he didn't even he if you had asked Jacob, Jacob, explain this. Tell me what's going on inside. Tell me why you have that drive within you. Tell me why you're so different. Tell me why it's why it's just an insatiable desire that you're willing to do anything to get that birthright. He'd say, "I don't know why, but I must have it." Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't explain that driving desire within us that we must go this way. We must believe what we believe because God has big plans for that believer. &gt;&gt; And big plans it was for Jacob that he would be in the lineage of Jesus Christ and one of the great fathers of the faith and become named by God himself. I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you, it means something to me today. It means something to you. I'm the God of Edward Biscll. I'm the God of of of of whoever put your name in there. In other words, you're saying that is the object that this person worships. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when that God spoke to me back there, I built an altar. I made a marker there in my life and one I can go back to and I'll say no matter what kind of difficulty I'm in right now, no matter how low I feel, no matter what kind of reversal, I'll point back and say that was God that did that. That was God that set me free. That was God that delivered me. That was God that showed me a life. &gt;&gt; I may not be in it right now, but that was God. It was you who did that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many here remember a certain point in God's in your life that God did something very special for you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say we should give him glory and praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You remember when you were a slave? &gt;&gt; Do you remember the shackles? &gt;&gt; Do you remember the feel of those shackles? You remember when you couldn't set yourself free &gt;&gt; and God set you free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And from that time, you couldn't see things like others, &gt;&gt; things that seemed kind rather normal and you're just one of the people and one of the group, one of the crowd, one of the students or whatever more. But suddenly it's different. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody's Christian, but when you are born of the spirit by this word, it's not the same anymore. &gt;&gt; We can't say we're the same. Everybody's Christian, but I'm not that kind of Christian. &gt;&gt; People are Christians. They can do all kinds of things, but I can't do it. You can't do it. Why? Because God spoke to you. God dealt with you. God met you. And you built an altar there. And if God speaks to you even in this service, I want you to build an altar &gt;&gt; and worship &gt;&gt; there &gt;&gt; cuz someday you'll have to go back to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "And when a man, I don't care what church you belong to, if it's cornal and your associates that you run with, the people you play cards with or your literature, societies, and so forth. When you obtain the birthight, &gt;&gt; that's something that's down in your heart that's hungered for God. And when you receive that, it calls for separation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're separated people. That thing that has hungered after God, and we obtain that birthight, it set you apart. &gt;&gt; It makes that individual different. Now, there's some major differences between Abraham and Lot. I'll say there's some major differences between ourselves and others. Lot did not build any altars that I know of. And you don't want to be a lot. I'm instructing you to identify those places that God did speak to you that God did meet with you in a special way. God especially when it comes that that experience comes also with a promise and the promise is not perhaps in uh in certain terminology that you can identify say well I heard certain words but it was his voice comes that you can like he said to Abraham lift up your eyes and Abraham saw land is what he saw he saw property But there was something within him said that's mine. &gt;&gt; Even though he lived his entire life and never owned any of it, never had title to any of it. The only title he had was that God at one point in time told him it's yours. &gt;&gt; I have seen just for myself and that's the best way for me to talk to you. I every once in a while I get a glimpse and you do too. You get a glimpse of a life in Christ, a life that you hunger after. You get a glimpse of the kind of father, the kind of mother, the kind of minister perhaps or whatever, the kind of person and you get a glimpse of it and you see really in the word what it is that God has and you can see it's there for you. I say there you want to build an altar. You're not saying I'm there because when when Abraham built the altar, he did not own the land yet. He he did not have any evidence of possession. That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; At this time when these moments come, you do not have any evidence that you're there, that you own it, that you've arrived, &gt;&gt; that you're that kind of man, that kind of woman, that kind of deacon or preacher or trustee or whatever more. You don't have any evidence that you are that, but you're building an altar that that God who spoke to you has given you that kind of vision. &gt;&gt; I'm saying you said it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do we hunger for? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about your hunger for it. What are you hungering for? What are you hungering for? What are you thirsting for? It's for something more in God. &gt;&gt; Is that not so? &gt;&gt; That's the thing that God chose a person. He's chosen. The thing you hunger for is yours. &gt;&gt; The thing you hunger for, I will give you. &gt;&gt; The thing you hunger for, you shall attain. And there you want to build an altar. &gt;&gt; You want to build a structure. You want to make a monument. You want to make a special make that a special dedicated spot. &gt;&gt; And then worship. Oh God of my fathers, you're the one that made the promise. You're the one that spoke to me there. I'll remember that place. It might be just it might even be a certain geographical place. It might be in your room. It might be in your automobile. It might be at the church. Who knows where it might be? That is irrelevant. But build a place and make a monument out of it so you can go back to it. &gt;&gt; We hunger for it. And that's what God shows a person. &gt;&gt; The world catches on to this. They tell people dream a dream, have great expectations and then pump them full of, you know, uh uh encouragement or to vitalize and energize themselves and tell them you can do it. Well, I I I I'm going to say you can't do it, but God will do it. &gt;&gt; God who made the promise What did he speak to you? I'm going to just ask you young people over the last few weeks and been focusing on you. What do you think God What do you think was in God's mind in the last few weeks? I just I want to ask the young people directly throughout the building wherever you are from before camp to past camp to even now. I'd say in the last two three months, how many you young people can recall that there was a very special moment, a very special service, and God touched you very deeply. You may not understand what it was, but God touched you. I'd like to see your hands as a confession. Just hold them up for a moment. All right. What you do? This is from my experience. If this be the last service I would ever speak to you, I would want you to do this. You, if you've not done so already, you build a marker. I want you to think about that very spot that God brought you to. I'd like you to go back and ponder what God what it was that God told you. What was it that he was saying to you at that time? And I can only I can only hypothetically draw conclusions. Some of you might be that you be delivered from your sinful ways, from your old life. To some of you, it might have been, you've tried this before, but this is different. It's going to be different now. You've tried it before. Didn't work. Tried it again. Try it again. Didn't work. It's And there's something within you said, "This is different. Has there been some of that? &gt;&gt; This is different." You build an altar there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And even if you have to go back a year from now, go back to that point or a month from now and say, I built an altar there and what God said to me, this will be different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not you. I'm doing it. &gt;&gt; To some of you, it might have been, I just want to give my life. And some of you have come forward and said that I just want to give my life. I want to give my life to the Lord. and and and your vision is just now just here for the moment, but God is looking at the big picture. And don't forget, God is seeing down the road what it is you're going to do. Whether it be a year or 10 years, I don't know how much time we have, but God looks at the big picture. Don't forget that God looks at the big picture. He sees us not only here, he sees the victorious church here. Let me tell you friends, this bride of Jesus Christ shall go out of this world in a blaze of victory. And she is victorious. &gt;&gt; She's absolutely victorious in Christ today. &gt;&gt; And that is why God has to give us each one our own little vision. But remember, when you see a vision, Rich, remember it is little. It's much bigger than you can see. And God's got much bigger plans than you have for your life. He's got much bigger plans. You're affecting people. You're influencing people you didn't even dream you're having an effect on. &gt;&gt; Lot did not build an altar as a result of any personal revelation or promise of God to him. These are major differences. Amen. &gt;&gt; It seems that the promised word to Abraham, the promised word to Abraham was really it was like for uh a a phase or just for a season. One type or one kind of blessing was all that Lot could see. And you know, friends, uh, I have to just speak honestly, every once in a while within a congregation, I do find those that I counsel with or speak with, and it seems their entire conversation is wrapped up and their eyes are not quite high enough. It is just around here and where we are right now. And th that has to consume a great deal of our thought and so on. But that must not maintain or be our main objective. We are eternal beings and we will certainly discredit our own selves and live at a lower a lower level of life if we don't have our vision are focused on the eternal realm. And it's very very important and I say especially with our young people because they have so much of this life that's before them. But it is it is critical. It is vital that we live the life that we do live with a eternal focus, an eternal vision, an eternal viewpoint &gt;&gt; that's dictating what we're doing here. &gt;&gt; Not not our our job or our profession. Don't let that dictate it because Satan can use that so much to to change our course so that we're not really fulfilling what God wants us to fulfill. Just remember as we read these scriptures, Lot went the direction he went by what he could see. And Abraham went the direction he went by what he saw. What Lot saw was physical. What Abraham saw was invisible. &gt;&gt; We need to be directed by the invisible. When Abraham offered I have some notes I pondered over very deeply. That's why I want to say it to you specifically. When Abraham offered Lot the choice part of the land, he demonstrated his unshakable faith in the promise of God. In other words, what he was saying, you're impossible to choose. It's impossible. These were the unspoken words. It's impossible lot for you to choose what God has promised me. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when people tell say, "Oh, we have miracles and we have healings and it happens over here and it happens over there and all the message isn't the only place this happens." That's perfectly fine. I say, "Praise God. Glad they're getting healed. Glad they're having miracles." All the rest of it. But they can never never take away &gt;&gt; from the promise of my inheritance. That's not my inheritance. Not just a healing. That is a benefit that comes along with the inheritance. But my inheritance is a revelation of this word right here. That's that's my inheritance. That's your inheritance. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this doesn't come just with signs and wonders and feelings and emotional things. It happens to come with a divine inspiration of God. &gt;&gt; And it can't come from a many, many sources. It only come from one source. If God hadn't sent a prophet, we wouldn't be seeing these things. If God hadn't sent a prophet, you and I wouldn't be friends. we wouldn't know one another. You wouldn't be sitting with one another. You wouldn't be shaking hands with one another. You wouldn't have traveled across land and across sea and and the people are gathering wherever they're gathering. It is the word itself that has gathered us together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lot lifted up his eyes, as I said earlier, but not high enough. He saw the well-watered plains of Jordan. Had he looked a little higher, he would have seen the fires of God hanging yonder over Sodom and Gomorrah. And we need to keep our eyes fixed on the heavens that will be on fire in the elements melting with fervent heat. We do not want those things that shall melt with fervent heat to be our guide through this life or become gods before us. Our automobiles will melt with fervent heat. Our homes will melt with fervent heat. All of these physical things shall melt with fervent heat. And it is that kind of thing that dominates our thinking so that we can choose correctly. We can make the right kind of decisions. Hallelujah. And even this body of dust shall just be a teaspoon of ashes someday unless it's changed in a rapture and a body changed. And so I want to I want to by God's grace dictate the movements and dictate this life so that it will be God-honoring &gt;&gt; for the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward and southward, and eastward, and westward. Brother Brandham said he couldn't bless him until he was separated. And once Abraham separated from Lot, one whose eyes could not see the full promise. Desires were limited to earthly things. Once he was separated from him, he could only see partially. And once he was separated, then he could see more glorious things. in the midst of confusion and chaos of this age when I read and now it's something for us we just pick up a message we read say oh brother Brandham said this I'd like you to put yourself back 30 40 years ago when he said that I tell you what friends what an example we've had he was in the midst of such utter chaos he was in the midst of all kinds of supernatural things happening and big tent meetings happening and you couldn't have convinced anybody that that revival was dying dying down. I lived in it and their competition was who had the biggest tent and this tent holds 25,000 and this tent now my tent holds 30,000 and they did held 25,000 people tents. Ours holds about 1,500. Put 25,000 people under canvas and they were going great guns and doing big things and great organization was going on. Here's a humble little prophet with a little office with a uh like a kitchen chair in it that he's sitting in. And what you and I are gathered in was coming at that time. &gt;&gt; Coming to that kind of a place, that kind of a humble little office. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that that whole movement had to separate and it did. There are believers, unbelievers, and make believers in every gathering. And I would say if there's any here that are make believer today, move over and become a believer. make believer can have all the blessings and all the benefits and hitchhike along, but that's not what we're interested in. Get your mind off of these natural things and put them on to spiritual things and let the spiritual dictate the natural. Brother Brandham says in Watchmen, "What of the night? in 1960 says, "Then I see the spiritfilled church with its sign reflecting the coming of the sun, the morning star putting off its rays. Oh, how happy I am." Can you imagine? Now, I want to put this in perspective for you, congregation. I want you to listen closely. Here's a man that has had a half a million, 300,000, tens of thousands of people, crowding auditoriums, lined up, several people across trying to get in at 3:00 in the afternoon and 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon in Vernon lined up waiting for the evening service. All of that has gone. Those people have all sifted away because the word started to come. The serpent seed message started to come and the godhead started to be made clear and the baptism was set out and the word was beginning to be restored. And as the word which is the inheritance, &gt;&gt; it's like a prophet starting to look over the entire inheritance of the land. And the people began to flock away. And he said they flocked away. He said they flocked away from Christ. And so it was Christ once again they were flocking away from. And now he's speaking to just a perhaps a handful of people. &gt;&gt; But he's saying, "I see a church. &gt;&gt; I see the rays of the son of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's lifting his eyes &gt;&gt; far above. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's seeing you. He's seeing what's happening. &gt;&gt; He's seeing the rays of the glory of God shining &gt;&gt; not only on a people but through a people. &gt;&gt; He sees the word coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He sees the message coming. He knows the promise of God. He knows there's a third pull and he knows it's on the verge of coming cuz he sees the first one and he sees the second one and he knows the third one has to come on the scene. He's beginning to rejoice. He sees what it's going to do. &gt;&gt; He sees the people it's going to collect. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I wish I had a voice to proclaim it to the world. God sent a messenger &gt;&gt; and he could say it. He said, "I see the morning star putting off its rays. Oh, how happy I am. I'm glad that God has a church &gt;&gt; that can put off the rays. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God has a church that can put off the rays. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God has a church that can reflect the rays of the morning sun. [Music] Now I have to lay a lot of foundation. Not going to keep you long, but this is what's really on my heart. This is what I really feel to preach. You are called of God &gt;&gt; to be the reflection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it is not by works of law. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you do it by law, there's no value to it whatsoever. If you do it of your own accord, there's no value to it at all. You can have your hair long. You can wear your dress right. You can have the right kind of shoes on. You men can wear the right kind of clothes. You can talk the right kind of conversation. But if you do it restricted by a law, there's no value to it. What is it? It's not law, it's life. &gt;&gt; That is the difference. &gt;&gt; Not law, but life. That's thus sayaith the Lord. It's the life. If it comes by any other means &gt;&gt; then it's your efforts. &gt;&gt; Now I want to come to that in just a moment. Says Balum he failed to see the pillar of fire. He failed to see the smitten rock. He failed to see the brass serpent going before Israel for an atonement. How could a man who was a prophet fail to see it? Preachers failed to see &gt;&gt; something that is so evident. &gt;&gt; Failed to see it. &gt;&gt; He failed to hear the shout of the camp of the king among them. He judged them by their works. He failed to see it. Now, this is a kind of an all-encompassing quote just before I'm going to take what the next 10 minutes and conclude. He said, "The church that professes to be a Christian church will have to have the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; For at the resurrection of the church, the church and his bride will come together and doveetail. &gt;&gt; They will dovetail. &gt;&gt; They will come together. They can only come together because because the church was separated, &gt;&gt; brought out. I did. And he says, "For at the resurrection of the church, Christ and his bride will come together and dovetail. The writings and promises of God will be made fulfilled there." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So it cannot come together unless the same spirit that was in Christ is in you and me. He said &gt;&gt; it cannot &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It cannot come together. So there cannot be a uniting unless the same spirit that was in Christ is in you and me. And then if that same spirit is in there, it'll do the same works &gt;&gt; and live the same kind of a separated life &gt;&gt; and do the works that he did. &gt;&gt; The spirit will do the works. Not and then they will do the works, nor the spirit will do the works. The life that you have received will do the works. &gt;&gt; So let me just bring it down to a practical way. &gt;&gt; I'll just bring it down real practical. Maybe you girls that are at home, your mother has taught you and and perhaps you've never been in a pair of pants. You've only been an address. You were raised that way and you've been obedient to it. You didn't mind it. That that became that became natural. It'd be very very uncomfortable for you to even put on a pair of slash. You and you look at it and you see it in the world and so on and and it seems so foreign to you and that's all wonderful. And so you just naturally do it. But that's not what I'm talking about. And people look at you and they see that you are different. You are different. But then one day you have a meeting someplace. You have you you sisters, you young ladies, one day you have a Bethl, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It might be here at this altar. It might be in your seat. It might be at home. But one day you have a meeting with this one that mother and dad talk about that you've heard the preacher preach about. You've seen others moved at and one day your heart has just melted and his presence comes and you're not thinking about dress. You're not thinking about you're not thinking about anything to do with that. You're not thinking about your hair. You've been brought into his presence and somehow your heart just wants to explode with love for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And something is taking place and oh you begin to see and he begins to talk to you begins to tell you what you are to him and and you feel his love emanating and you feel feel such a you just feel such a closeness and you just feel oh I want to live here forever. I want to live here forever. I I I don't even want to go out. I don't even want to go to school. I don't want to go to work. I just feel like it'll live here forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where you build an altar. And right away, you want to say, "Oh, thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Don't ever let this dissipate. Don't ever let this e away. But if it ever does, let me build an altar. And I thank you that you had this moment. I thank you that you met me here. I thank you that you spoke those words. I thank you that you told me I was your daughter." &gt;&gt; Amen. Then when you stand up and walk out of there, you say, "Now I know why I dress the way I dress." &gt;&gt; Cuz it pleases him. &gt;&gt; Now I know I act the way I act. Now I know for the first time. And it is the life now that came in you that separates you. &gt;&gt; And a young man is brought up a certain way. or we as adults, we came under the sound of the message and we began to hear it and maybe could have lived the most upright life. Maybe he was in a church and all the rest of it. Maybe could out of a good Baptist Pentecostal church or whatever more whatever whatever brand it was is irrelevant. And you come and you hear the message and strikes your heart and maybe it isn't instantaneous, but you know it's I know that's true. I know that's true. And there's a still small voice. Maybe your mind is saying one thing. But your heart is saying something else. In your heart, there's a still small voices down there saying, "Amen." Amen. I know that's true. I know that's true. It sounds too good to be true, in fact. But I know it's true. Do you feel it calling you? Do you feel it pulling you? Yes, I do. I know it's for me. But I've got so much encumbrance. I've got so much that tying me down. I got so much so much burden and so many shackles and so many complexes and so many this. But there's something inside that's saying it's for you. It's for you. And excuse me. And and then at an appointed time, I don't know where, but you have your Bethl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you meet him. Say, "Oh God. Oh God, I've heard about you, but now my eye sees you. &gt;&gt; This is so different. &gt;&gt; This is so marvelous. Don't ever let it happen. Don't ever let it leave me. Don't Don't ever let me Don't ever let me get out of this presence. Even though you know that life is going to demand that you won't feel that way all the time, but you build an altar there. &gt;&gt; You build an altar and say, "I know that this one who I met, I couldn't see him. My eyes couldn't see him, but I know that he's real. I know he's more real." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends. Let me tell you something. Don't ever forget this young people. When that pillar of fire, who I never saw with these people say, "Did you see it with your eyes?" No. It was more real than I saw with my eyes. I'm going to say something I've never said before in my life. That pillar of fire that came between that angel of the Lord that came between Brother Brandham and I was more real than Brother Brandham himself. &gt;&gt; Far more real. &gt;&gt; You say, "How? How so, brother Ed? Because it wasn't brother Bram's presence that I felt was going to usher me into another realm. Wasn't brother Bram's presence that I felt I I sat with him. It wasn't his presence that made me feel that way. But one came and I can't deny the effect it had. And I can say I thank God that he met me there in that way. And I'll never forget. I'll take it to my I'll take it to the change of my body. You can never deny that you've had experiences and you know it's true. You know it's real. You know it's him. &gt;&gt; You can never deny that. &gt;&gt; He spoke to you. The word came so clear. &gt;&gt; You know it was him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All I say today is identify that. &gt;&gt; Just say that was you. Oh God. That was you my Lord Jesus. You spoke. You touch me. &gt;&gt; And now Abraham physically was separated. Physically he was in our father was physically separated. He wasn't even in Sodom and Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came, he was amongst them. He was a friend of sinners. But yet the scripture says he was separated. And that same son of God is here today in this last terrible age. He's still in this he he's come into Satan's Eden to take his bride out. &gt;&gt; And here we are right in the midst of it mingling with them. You're amongst them, but you're separated. &gt;&gt; You're not separated because I'm saying so. You're separated because the life that is in you is living a separated life. You're completely separated. You're not part of the system. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not part of their religion. You're not part of their economics. And that is why I so thank the Lord that he said, "Father, I'm not in the world, but these are in the world. &gt;&gt; They're in the world. &gt;&gt; We're in the world. &gt;&gt; We're in their workplaces. And we have friends. We have colleagues. We have school friends or whatever more. We're in the world. But you're indeed different from the world. &gt;&gt; So you say now I'm coming to the close. How how brother Ed am I different? How are we different? I'll tell you. It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. How was he different &gt;&gt; as he moved through life? and he connected with people. Here's how he's different. A woman was rushed into his presence with men who had stones in their hand. Said, "We caught her in the very act of adultery." Actually caught her in adultery. And the word has said that she should be stoned. And what do you say? He showed that he was even greater than any of their thoughts or any of their conclusions and greater than the law because the life that was in him poured out grace to the woman. &gt;&gt; Said, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." Do you know what, friend? She had never heard such words in her life. She never heard such words in her life. She never heard a rabbi in the synagogue ever say such a thing. Neither do I condemn thee. He was separate. And you know what they said? That's different. &gt;&gt; I'm sure the disciples who pinned the words down said, "Wow, we've never heard that before." Why? He was in the world, but he was separate from sinners. He was separate from the unbelievers. He was separate from the lawkeepers. &gt;&gt; He was greater than the law. He was greater. Why? Because he was the law fulfilled. &gt;&gt; He's greater than the law. And that's why it can't be by works. Thou shalt do this and you'll dress a certain way and you'll speak a certain way and it make you all perfect. That would be nothing but rotten filthy works. &gt;&gt; Just rotten works cuz it's your own. It's your own energy, your own thing. But when a life is in you, hallelujah, a life is in you living it out. Says this is the way I want to be. &gt;&gt; This the way I want to live. There's something in me driving me. I was thinking about what is what is my own experience. There's something there's something that that eats on me. And here's what it is. I don't find it in a lot of other places. I don't even find it somehow in a lot of people that are professed to be believers. I hadn't planned on saying this. I have a message book in my hand. I have a life in me that cannot rest to think that I can hold this book and someone else can't hold it. &gt;&gt; I can't rest. I can't rest to think that I can look and immediately I start and my mind and my soul is fed and I begin to understand. I begin to grasp things and to know that I could put this in someone else's hand. He say, "Well, I uh it's a total mystery. I don't I don't read this language." I'd want to say right away, what language do you read? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's missions." That is the mission. &gt;&gt; That's not missions. That is the mission. &gt;&gt; That is the call. &gt;&gt; And that Holy Spirit has got an insatiable thirst to bring that last elected seat in. But when that last elected one comes in, we go home according to the word. Isn't that so? &gt;&gt; And so the way that you live, the way that you act, the way you see things now people, it has changed. Everything's changed. That's right. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought since Jesus came into my heart. &gt;&gt; Is that so? &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; And that's how he was. He was amongst sinners but not joined to them. We're amongst them. We're in them. We're in a sodom condition, but we're separated. &gt;&gt; We see things differently. We analyze them differently. Our mind is different. Our mind is clean. It's been washed by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Things that are normal to people are very abnormal to us. I heard two men in conversation this last week and they started on the teacher strike and uh before 3 minutes had gone by the one was ranting and raving on President Bush. The other fellow was taken up for him and said, "Well, what's that mean to you? That doesn't mean anything to you. You're here." Well, he says, "I've got a master's degree and I'm in I'm I'm a retired teacher and da da da da." And they went on and on and on. I was just sitting there listening and this man with a master's degree and he was giving all of his education and for how little he worked for and he was down on this and down on the other thing. But while he's going along, he takes the Lord's name in vain. I just said, "You'd never teach my children. I'd never have you cursor and blasphemer of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You'd never utter the words to teach my children. &gt;&gt; And right then I thank God for the teachers we had here at the school. &gt;&gt; Thank God we have people whose lips do not use cursing &gt;&gt; and sitting here teaching our children at school. I say and soon as he said that I just said, you know, that's where you and I part ways. &gt;&gt; We're totally separated. I'm separated from that. Thank God &gt;&gt; we're separated from this world. What's normal to them, what's just normal conversation them is foreign language to me. &gt;&gt; And their hopes, their aspirations. I see them, you know, and they're going across the parking lot and they've got their case or six of of six-pack of of their pillser beer or labats or whatever it is and going across there and oh man, they what are you going to do? Are you going to see the game tonight and you know, I mean, they're just so they're all wrapped up in their world. I just say, "Oh, thank God. &gt;&gt; I know nothing about that world." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're in another world. They haven't just lift their eyes high enough. &gt;&gt; But I don't condemn them. &gt;&gt; Do you know why? It's the best they'll have in this world. &gt;&gt; He's got his best. And while I'm sitting there looking at him or looking at her running with their best, I say, "Thank God, this is my worst." &gt;&gt; And then it's not too bad. This is the worst you'll ever have. had it so bad. It has not that bad. This is the worst you'll ever have. Oh, thank God. We're separate from sinners. The son of God is still separate from sinners, but we're amongst them. We're in the midst of them, and we're here to reflect &gt;&gt; the only hope of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say, God bless you as you reflect it. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. Oh, hallelujah. [Music] Praise God. Praise God. Let's stand, shall we? heard a wonderful report from brother Murphy this last week &gt;&gt; and how the people over there have been so diligently working and getting the message and but they've been putting a a search uh engine to the message in Chinese and he said they've just finished it now. Can you believe that? They've developed the brothers have developed a search engine. So the brothers in China, anyone in China can search the message. I I don't know if you've ever searched it. How many here have ever searched the message? Oh my, look at all those hands. See there? And those of you that haven't, it's a wonderful wonder. It's it's just there for you, available for you. It's just a marvelous thing. And here they're so eager to hear something more about it. I thank God. Heavenly Father, I address you as our Father, my Father, which art in heaven. We say, "Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." We pray, oh God, you'll forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. We pray, oh God, that you will work in us and through us. We ask Lord that your will will be accomplished. &gt;&gt; And if there be any here Lord as they heard the service this morning, I pray Father that you will impress them indelibly mark them that and and that they will be guided Lord. They will be directed to look back and to treasure those moments, those times, those seasons, those days when you drew near to them. and they'll make that a marker in their life, oh God, that they can go back to. Or perhaps someone is even here today that needs to go back, Father. Perhaps they've not felt the closeness and the nearness of your presence with them. They need to go back, oh God, and begin to begin to confess that there you spoke certain things to them. And another place you talked with them. And oh Lord, then your nearness, your presence comes close to them and the a real love relationship begins between your children, your son, your daughter, and yourself. Lord, as I was preparing in this service and I thought of the bride in the Song of Solomon and how she was searching for you says, "Have you seen my beloved?" And to all the others they could not see any such attraction. What is your beloved more than all the beloveds? And oh Lord Jesus, we say along with her, my beloved is the fairest of 10,000. There's none like you. There's none like you, Lord. Oh, we love you, Lord. If we could just have our hearts open up. And I pray you will give me a greater capacity to express my love, Lord, to you. and that you will come down near each one that is here today, Lord. And if we achieve nothing more in the service than to cause people to love you and to hunger and thirst after your presence and nearness to them, that is what we ask for, Lord. &gt;&gt; I will feel that this service and the objective will be achieved. Lord, we can somehow inspire people to call upon you and ask you that they may draw near to you. Jesus, I pray in your name, that you will be with us throughout this afternoon and as we prepare for the service tonight and those that are going to be baptized, oh God, the Holy Spirit will overshadow the place where they're baptized. May it be a real altar building place for them in Jesus Christ's name I ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to sing 2163. Oh to be like thee. I've been trying to on it all morning. I feel it many times when I begin to hum and begin to sing a song. I won't even know why. But then when I come to church, finish the service, and then we begin to we begin to sing it, then I find the words. And I don't even know what all the words are here, but I've been on this song, and I just know that God wants us to sing. There's something there for us for you. Let let let let the inspired words minister to you. Oh to be like thee. Blessed. This is my longing and praying [Music] out for our friend. [Music] Jesus I to wear all [Music] mighty [Music] blessed redee. Jesus [Music] is thy sweetness. I th [Music] we'll sing the third verse please. The third and then the fourth is the last verse.

Come in my fullness th with our heads bowed. We're going to sing the chorus again. And I I know that there are needs, very real needs that are here present with us. And what my heart is so moved about is I know that the need that exists right now need not exist in another five minutes. friend, &gt;&gt; brother, sister. &gt;&gt; Believe me, &gt;&gt; he's present here now to meet that need and to send you out from this place. You'll be in the camp of the righteous. You'll be in the beloved children of Abraham. Don't dwell below your inheritance. Don't dwell. Don't let Satan seduce you to tell you you cannot have victory over that. I say in the name of the Lord, victory is yours. Deliverance is yours. He died to make it so &gt;&gt; and he's presence himself here now. Do you have that craving? I ask, do you have that hunger? And if you're saying, "Oh yes, brother, brother Ed, I do have that hunger." Then thus sayith the Lord to you. It is your portion.
