TRANSCRIPT
========================================
do you know the sky never change the sky is still sky the star sky is still blue it's not that the sky changed but it was somebody someone flying in the sky changed that little eagle it's one day when that modern eagle started to cry and started screaming that in the air in that sky that arose that little eagle they said i belong to that there was something resembled to that little eagle make the first wave shave wave sieve that in that air began to fly then out of the eagle said that belongs to me that's my mama my mama conquers the sky my mama lived alive in the sky the sky is not a sky anymore the sky is not a mysterious anymore the skies are dangerous anymore but the sky is a can be lift the sky can be soared the sky can divide the sky belongs to you rapture belongs to you freedom belongs to you a true christian life belongs to you you can't live the life somebody already lived there but i lived there brother tom lived there but it's him in there and humbled like brother murphy lived there you can live there too the prophets are living in there jesus christ to believe that they are all the sins of the old they live there that belongs to them sky still the sky used to be dangerous used to be too far a true experience with the lord is too far but all of sudden the mother eagle start to fly that gave an example that give a heart they give a courage to that little eagle that you can make your life simpler yesterday when i was preparing it i was crying when i was thinking about that and here we go i said lord that is me i used to be in the denomination just thinking about oh all christian life and just go to church pick up a bible got some spiritual book i started reading it and try to live a good life until i saw the prophet's message it's not some it's not just some word but it's the one can lift the word if the one can fly can soaring in the sky can take a hold of the promise of a god and make it come to pass can bring the heavenly atmosphere down down the earth and that word created an atmosphere around me and i said lord i want that and i take that inside of me and i start to believe it and then the words start to live it out and my wife started to come in none of my children then i go to china then i saw the believers i put my heart out i give the what is the living world becoming real to me and i saw one after another and then we translated a message because something was pushing then we translated the bible what has the lord has done there is some ego flying in the sky that i know that's for me the healing is for me the deliverance for me to live a victorious life that's it for me it's not for somebody else but that's for me amen i made a little poem i hope it's not something to chinese there is always a sky but no ego to fly there are always a clouds passing by but is that ego cannot fly they said no one can overcome sin because no one have ever tried till one day i heard a prophecy scream it woke me up from my heavenly dream i spread my wind to the heavenly place by responding to the message of god's grace shall we stand but verma said an invisible unit that i tell you just as the ego recognized that voice so does a real born-again christian recognize the voice of a god speaking through the word when they see an anointed and vindicated look and look it up there he didn't see his old hand cut clock around here so john doesn't go here go over here and go this and go to this and that he saw a being like he wanted it to be sailing in this air screaming free up in the highs above all the vultures and things of the earth hallelujah he wanted it to be that because it was in him to be that are you the little ego there is something in you you want to be that sky is means for ego to fly this message is not just mims to read now this is means to listen the church is not just means of the tradition that we're coming over to put up some time the sky is for ego to fly it's for you to experience the freedom the world cannot offer you nothing the world cannot offer you satisfaction the world cannot offer you peace because it doesn't possess peace but peace belongs to the heavenly places god has created a heavenly atmosphere for all of us no matters is in the here what is in watching the screen on the internet or whoever in the future gonna hear this archive god created the sky is for eagle to fly and you are the one shall we bow our head is there anyone that haven't live up to that heavenly realm is there anyone that you feel that in your heart is something is attacking you lord i want to live a victorious christian life lord i want to live a life as a worthy worthy for the gospel i don't want to be a coward i don't want to be around around try to go here and go there lord there's some besetting sin that's in me lord i feel there's something that you want to give it to me but it seems like it's too far it seems like i can never never achieve do you know that when god sent us a message that he intends you to receive it and leave it do you know when god bring the trials the difficulties sometimes darkness before you he intended for that to mold your character you come out victoriously because the sky it means for eagle to fly sometime the sky get dark sometimes the sky might have a storm but still god said i made that i allow that you have a whims just spread your wings just let your face rise up no matter how big the storm is but you mean to fly oh heavenly father [Music] all things is for us lord all of this is before all the eagles can soar it can fly to ceiling that in the sky that you haven't created because that's what it meant to be the lord lord and maybe some they raise up their hand and maybe some of the race upper hand for the purpose [Music] maybe they're not a lived to the privilege of that or to give it to them maybe some deliver they're supposed to live in heavenly but lord it seems like they can only live on the earth some they've been maybe buggled by the sims for years after years the habits the things that are around them has so be they're so intentional to buy it oh god let them understand or they're now in the heavenly atmosphere they just take the scream of the prophet's voice just take the scream of the eagle the mama eagle that will wake up the character that's already in that eagle lord i commit all of them into your hand lord would you do something to our dearest brothers and sisters if the lord has a dealing with you would you like to raise up your hand not to me as i'm close to my eyes you raise up to him it's not as long as i said or somebody else to see it but as long as it got see it you're on the internet it's not what your mom said you're a daddy said it's not your friend said but it's a god said you hear the cry of the mama the ego you hear the message of this hour you know god gave you the privilege you know that god gave you the wind to fly it's not just a flopping around it's not just a in the flopping over here and flopping over there and trying to find some books to help you out and try to find some of friends to give you some advice it's not that but god created a heaven for you to be in there would you like to raise up your hand tuna hand oh dear father we believe you lord as is quite a moment lord maybe it is not as emotional maybe it is not as loud as it may but lord this is the time to mean business with you if we can be more sincere lord you've been given us the power to bind and unbind the lord that's all we need to do need to be more sincere that's what we do lord forgive us on sincerity glory forgive us the deal terry forgive our lack lord forgive of the things that will so easily be said at us lord i just pray you'll let us spread our whims of faith to
