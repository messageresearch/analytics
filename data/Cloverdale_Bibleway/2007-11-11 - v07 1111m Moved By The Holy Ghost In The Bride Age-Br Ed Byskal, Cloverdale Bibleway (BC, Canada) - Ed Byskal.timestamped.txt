[9:38] [Music]
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We're going to go to prayer
[9:41] at this time.
[9:44] Ask brother Ricardo if you'd come and
[9:46] open the service in a word of prayer.
[9:47] We've got a number of uh prayer cloths
[9:50] here. Some of them without request, some
[9:52] of them with requests. Amen. Brother
[9:55] Ricardo wants to us to remember his aunt
[9:57] this morning. Gloria the Florence want
[10:00] have prayer for their mom who uh they
[10:03] found to have a cancerous lump. There's
[10:06] a number of requests here from brother
[10:08] uh Barney and uh we just want to pray
[10:12] over all of these requests this morning.
[10:14] If you've got a need this morning,
[10:16] you're here. Amen. The Lord knows your
[10:19] need. If you're listening in on the
[10:20] internet this morning, you've got a need
[10:22] this morning. The Lord knows exactly
[10:24] what that need is. You just lift it
[10:26] before him now as we go to prayer. Amen.
[10:28] We have confidence this morning. Our God
[10:31] knows our needs and knows has the
[10:34] solution for each and every one. Amen.
[10:37] I'll meet that need this morning.
[10:38] Brother Ricardo, if you come,
[10:42] [Music]
[10:46] heavenly father, Lord, we're so thankful
[10:48] to be gathered again in the house of the
[10:49] Lord this morning, Father. Lord, for we
[10:52] know when we're together, Lord, we're
[10:53] just rejuvenated and strengthened by
[10:55] your word, by your presence, Father. And
[10:58] where two or three are gathered, you
[10:59] promise you will be, Father. So, we're
[11:01] just trusting, believing for that this
[11:03] morning, Lord. And if we can believe
[11:05] your word, where it says two or three
[11:07] are gathered, Father, how many other
[11:08] promises we can believe for, Lord, that
[11:10] are needed this morning. Father, it's
[11:12] not here or there. You're no respector
[11:14] of persons, Father. Every promise is yay
[11:16] and amen to them that believe. Father,
[11:19] we just want to believe this morning for
[11:20] all the needs, Lord. For the prayer
[11:22] class, for the touch in the body.
[11:24] Father, you know our hearts. You know
[11:26] every need. Lord, we're so thankful that
[11:28] we have a God that hears and answers our
[11:31] prayer. Dear Lord, we just want to be a
[11:33] worship to you this morning. We want you
[11:36] to be near. Speak to our hearts, Father,
[11:38] and give us faith to believe the word
[11:41] and not just to hear it, but to sink
[11:42] into our souls so it becomes part of our
[11:45] being, our reality. For we know the more
[11:47] of you we take in, the closer we will
[11:49] be. And Father, how are we longing for
[11:51] that day when we will just be with you
[11:53] always forever and forever in a day just
[11:56] to worship you in your presence and to
[11:58] sing your praises, Father. So Lord, we
[12:00] just pray for the speaker this morning.
[12:02] May you just condition him, Father, use
[12:05] his vessel, Lord, and may you just
[12:07] prepare our hearts for the word. Looking
[12:09] forward to a wonderful time in your
[12:10] presence. In Jesus Christ's name we ask.
[12:13] Amen.
[12:17] And you can have your seats this
[12:18] morning.
[12:28] And we're here to hear the word this
[12:30] morning. And uh
[12:33] quartet is going to sing a song we sang
[12:35] uh back at the convention.
[12:37] And uh song I never get tired of. His
[12:41] word will stand. So maybe they can come
[12:42] and uh get ready just before we turn to
[12:44] the word. And as they're coming, maybe
[12:46] we can sing ancient words. Word of God
[12:49] ever true. Changing me, changing you.
[12:52] Amen. You want to be changed.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Into his likeness. Amen. It's our desire
[12:59] this morning.
[13:03] Holy worth
[13:08] for our
[13:11] in this world
[13:13] they resound
[13:16] with
[13:19] the word of God
[13:26] [Music]
[13:29] give us
[13:31] help
[13:34] his word
[13:40] of God could guide us.
[13:43] Oh
[13:45] God,
[13:49] changing me,
[13:52] &gt;&gt; changing Lord we have with heart.
[14:00] Let the word of God,
[14:05] holy word
[14:07] of our faith
[14:11] down
[14:12] to this
[14:16] [Music]
[14:18] sacrifice.
[14:20] Oh, keep the faithful words of Christ.
[14:25] Holy world
[14:28] preserve
[14:30] for our walk in this world.

[14:56] We have come with heart
[15:02] of God. Sing it once again. The word of
[15:06] God.
[15:09] [Music]
[15:10] It's changing me. It's changing.
[15:15] Lord, we have
[15:18] [Music]
[15:22] the word of God.
[15:27] [Music]
[15:47] [Music]
[16:05] Some say it's myth and legend.
[16:09] One more book upon the shelf,
[16:12] but the message it contains cannot be
[16:17] still.
[16:18] [Music]
[16:20] For the God who wrote its pages will not
[16:24] let it pass away.
[16:27] Not one syllable will linger
[16:31] unfulfilled.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; His word will stand.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; His word will stand.
[16:42] Though stars should fall and mountains
[16:46] turn to sand,
[16:50] though no man
[16:52] believe it, still God's word is true.
[16:57] His promise is sure, his love will
[17:00] endure, and forever
[17:03] his word
[17:07] will stand.
[17:10] [Music]
[17:28] Don't listen to the voices
[17:32] of old world caught up in fear.
[17:36] For the word of God proclaims the
[17:39] victory.
[17:43] He gives his children courage to
[17:47] confront the gates of hell with the
[17:51] sword that conquers every enemy.
[17:55] [Music]
[17:57] His word will stand.
[18:00] His word will stand.
[18:04] Though stars should fall and mountains
[18:08] turn to sand.
[18:12] Though no man
[18:14] believe it, still God's word is true.
[18:19] His promise is sure. His love it will
[18:22] endure. And forever
[18:25] his word
[18:28] will stand.
[18:32] His
[18:35] word will stand.
[18:38] His word will stand.
[18:42] Though stars should fall and mountains
[18:47] turn to sand,
[18:50] though no man
[18:53] believe it, still God's word is true.
[18:57] His promise is sure. His love it will
[19:01] endure. And forever
[19:03] his word
[19:07] will stand.
[19:10] And forever
[19:13] his word
[19:16] [Music]
[19:17] will stand.
[19:22] [Music]
[19:27] &gt;&gt; Can you stand with us? We'll sing the
[19:28] chorus together. His
[19:40] word will stand.
[19:43] Though stars should fall and mountains
[19:47] turn to sand.
[19:51] Though no man
[19:53] believe it, still God's word is true.
[19:58] His promise is sure. His love will
[20:01] endure. And forever
[20:04] his word
[20:08] will stand.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; His word will stand.
[20:18] His word will stand.
[20:22] Though stars would fall and mountains
[20:26] turn to sand.
[20:30] Though no man
[20:32] believe it, still God's word is true.
[20:37] His promise is sure. His love will
[20:40] endure and forever
[20:43] his word
[20:47] will.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; We believe it, don't we?
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[20:59] Thank you for that song and the
[21:01] inspiration
[21:03] and the truth of it.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:06] Well, it's so nice to see the church
[21:10] full,
[21:11] the young people coming in and those
[21:15] that are connected with us live
[21:19] streaming.
[21:20] God bless them and all who will ever see
[21:24] the service and be blessed by it. Today
[21:27] is uh Remembrance Day
[21:31] and uh the day we remember
[21:34] where
[21:36] Treaties were signed and armistice was
[21:38] signed.
[21:40] 11th day of the 11th month, the 11th
[21:42] hour
[21:44] and boys could stop being killed
[21:48] on all sides and all fronts. And it was
[21:50] a the end of a birth pain,
[21:55] second birth pain we're told.
[21:58] And we are we are remembering those who
[22:02] fought and died
[22:05] fighting for a cause of freedom.
[22:08] The prophet said in the rising of the
[22:10] sun, there's been many fine little
[22:13] babies born and there's been many men
[22:17] who have suffered and died for a real
[22:20] cause.
[22:22] But there never was one that could raise
[22:24] himself up again until this day.
[22:27] the day of the resurrection.
[22:29] That separated it. There's many people
[22:36] that are in church today.
[22:38] Many people that are fulfilling the same
[22:41] offices,
[22:43] song leaders, musicians,
[22:46] technical people, deacons, trustees,
[22:50] preachers,
[22:52] evangelists, and whatever more.
[22:56] Uh but there is one thing that
[22:59] uh separates
[23:03] them from others or us from others
[23:07] and uh that is that
[23:10] the word of God
[23:13] has promised certain things to happen in
[23:16] this hour. And if you are part of that
[23:19] happening,
[23:21] no matter who you are, it separates you
[23:24] from everyone else who may be filling a
[23:26] similar position.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I kind of dropped a little bit of a
[23:32] a bomb on where I'm going today, but we
[23:36] also have
[23:38] uh we're sending a soldier to Vietnam.
[23:41] You say, "Well, I thought the Vietnam
[23:42] War was over." Well, not for us.
[23:46] It's still on. We're fighting a real
[23:49] war.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; And when they sent boys over, they sent
[23:53] them over to die on both sides. But we
[23:57] have brother Timothy Maul. Brother
[23:59] Timothy came into our lives and into the
[24:02] fellowship here some years ago.
[24:06] And since he
[24:08] uh saw the revelation of the message,
[24:12] he's given himself unreservedly
[24:17] to the work in Vietnam. Began by
[24:20] translating
[24:22] into Chinese and then Vietnamese.
[24:24] Uh did a entire website. Did a mirror
[24:28] image of the uh Cloverdale Bible Way
[24:30] website.
[31:53] He's translating the messages, of
[31:55] course. And uh he's kind of doing double
[31:57] duty right now because he's getting the
[31:59] butterflies lined up as well.
[32:02] I just asked getting them lined up,
[32:04] guys. Getting them lined up. So, you'll
[32:06] enjoy tonight. You want to sure all be
[32:09] here. And we're remember we're going to
[32:11] take a mission offering this evening.
[32:13] I'd like to just report too that uh I
[32:17] had contact with brother Gary and
[32:20] actually sister Deborah's uh father in
[32:24] New Zealand and uh uh the hospital she
[32:29] requested that she might be moved to
[32:32] near to his bedside. This was on one day
[32:36] and uh she be was speaking to him uh you
[32:40] know just doing whatever she could. He
[32:42] he was still in an unconscious state at
[32:45] that time. And uh then I felt in the
[32:48] email to address some things and I just
[32:52] spoke specifically about uh read the
[32:55] scripture in his ear because I
[32:57] understand I'm not in the medical field
[33:01] but I understand from the medical people
[33:04] that the the last sense to actually
[33:06] depart a body is the hearing and that
[33:10] they can hear when they're still in an
[33:12] unconscious state. So I said, "Read the
[33:14] scripture to him. Uh play the prophet's
[33:18] message in an earpiece in his ear. Uh
[33:21] sing songs and uh and and she had been
[33:26] actually doing that apparently." And I
[33:28] heard from her father and he said she
[33:30] sang Amazing Grace to him. And uh uh and
[33:35] while she held his hand, he squeezed her
[33:38] hand. And he has a he has a a a saying
[33:41] that he would say which is when he say
[33:44] raise the main sail. So that was one of
[33:48] his phrases. So she said, "Gary, if you
[33:52] understand me," she wanted to know what
[33:54] comprehension he had because they said
[33:56] his brain was damaged, but they didn't
[33:58] know how damaged. So she said, "Raise
[34:01] the main sail." And he start to raise
[34:04] his arm as much as he could. Praise God.
[34:07] Hallelujah. So, we're really thankful
[34:09] for that. Amen. God bless brother Gary
[34:12] and sister uh Deborah Walker in the name
[34:15] of Jesus Christ. We're remembering them
[34:16] in our continued in our prayers.
[34:20] Amen.
[34:22] All right, we're ready for the word.
[34:24] Thank you.
[34:29] I'll have you turn in the Bible to uh
[34:32] second Peter the first chapter
[34:36] and we're going to begin reading at the
[34:38] 16th verse.
[34:53] I trust also that um you'll just be very
[34:57] very much in prayer. Uh,
[35:02] I I have a I have a message that I want
[35:04] to speak next Sunday
[35:07] and I I I Lord willing, I'm very
[35:09] hesitant. I hardly ever announce a a
[35:13] next Sunday's message, but I I would
[35:15] like to speak on the open door uh next
[35:18] Sunday, Lord willing.
[35:22] And perhaps you'll understand a little
[35:24] bit more next Sunday, perhaps why you're
[35:27] here.
[35:29] uh why the church is actually in this
[35:31] location.
[35:33] Why we are substantially
[35:36] uh uh a very international congregation
[35:41] and many from each side of the border
[35:45] and we have special complications and
[35:49] difficulties
[35:50] but which has made the congregation
[35:52] somewhat unique and we have overcome
[35:56] those difficulties over the years. But I
[35:59] will say this that God himself ordained
[36:04] that the congregation and the people
[36:07] that are here from wherever they are
[36:09] from Europe, from the UK,
[36:13] from Russia,
[36:15] from Africa,
[36:17] from the United States, from Canada,
[36:19] wherever they're from, God has ordained
[36:23] that those you individuals are here for
[36:26] a specific purpose. And that purpose is
[36:29] to propagate and send this message to
[36:32] witness it here and around the earth.
[36:37] And that is why you're here.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; That is specifically why you're here.
[36:42] And I wish to speak about it on the open
[36:44] door next Sunday. And I'm praying that
[36:47] God, if you will pray this week, that
[36:50] God will grip you with a w with a a
[36:56] mighty uh feeling of commitment and
[36:59] devotion to a cause. I believe we have a
[37:02] cause. We're remembering today men who
[37:05] fought for a cause. And we have we have
[37:08] those here who were veterans and have
[37:11] fought in different wars and have fought
[37:14] for a cause. and were ready to lay their
[37:17] life down at a moment's notice. Didn't
[37:19] know when they would pick up a bullet
[37:22] and they have fought for a cause. The
[37:24] the country, the world has been bathed
[37:26] in blood.
[37:28] You know that. And we have a cause that
[37:33] far exceeds any of these causes. And I
[37:36] think that we need to realize that
[37:39] &gt;&gt; and this message this morning will
[37:41] perhaps be preparatory towards next
[37:44] Sunday.
[37:47] Let's just pray before we read.
[37:50] Dear heavenly father, feeling a sense of
[37:54] direction, we want to follow so keenly
[37:58] in your uh leadership and pray, oh God,
[38:03] that you'll move sovereignly upon this
[38:06] congregation.
[38:08] uh these are not things that can be
[38:10] accomplished or ch achieved by man's
[38:13] wisdom or men's efforts or those of uh
[38:17] of the uh science or intelligence of
[38:20] this day. We need you, oh God. We need
[38:24] and desire the Holy Spirit. We thirst
[38:27] after you, Lord. We thirst after the
[38:30] living God. You're the only one that can
[38:32] satisfy the thirst of our soul. And I
[38:36] pray, oh Lord, that you'll pour out
[38:38] yourself as you poured out freely this
[38:40] message, oh God. We've been anointed by
[38:43] that. This is our anointing, Lord. And
[38:46] we move in that we move in that realm.
[38:50] Uh knowing that we've been anointed for
[38:52] a purpose in the name of Jesus Christ
[38:55] and for your glory. Amen.
[39:01] For we have not followed cunningly
[39:03] devised fables when we made known unto
[39:06] you the power and the coming of our Lord
[39:09] Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of
[39:12] his majesty.
[39:14] For he received from God the Father
[39:17] honor and glory, when there came such a
[39:20] voice to him from the excellent glory,
[39:23] this is my beloved son in whom I am well
[39:26] pleased.
[39:27] And this voice which came from heaven we
[39:30] heard when we were with him in the holy
[39:32] mount. We have also a more sure word of
[39:36] prophecy
[39:38] where unto you do well that you take
[39:40] heed as unto a light that shineth in a
[39:43] dark place until the day dawn and the
[39:46] day star arise in your hearts. Knowing
[39:50] this first that no prophecy of the
[39:53] scripture is of any private
[39:55] interpretation.
[39:56] For the prophecy came not in the old
[39:59] time by the will of man, but holy men of
[40:03] God spake as they were moved by the Holy
[40:08] Ghost.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Especially the last verse. And the
[40:13] prophecy came not in old time by the
[40:16] will of man, but holy men of God spake
[40:21] as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You have your
[40:27] seats.
[40:33] So, holy men of God were moved.
[40:36] Now, I want to address the congregation
[40:38] today
[40:39] that
[40:42] uh we are moved. And this is the title
[40:44] of the thought and the message. This is
[40:47] my message title. Moved
[40:51] by the Holy Ghost in the bride age.
[40:56] moved by the Holy Ghost in the bride
[40:58] age. I'm going to be rather deliberate
[41:02] this morning. I probably could take two
[41:04] services, but uh I'm will cover as much
[41:09] as I can and then perhaps continue on
[41:12] next Sunday with the open door.
[41:20] The word moved that Paul has you or
[41:23] rather Peter has used here
[41:26] is to bring forth or to bear something
[41:32] to carry some burden. Not to carry
[41:35] something light but to carry some burden
[41:37] and to bear with oneself. They were
[41:40] moved by the Holy Ghost. It is to it is
[41:44] to be conveyed. Even they were being
[41:47] conveyed the prophets themselves the
[41:49] holy men of God were being conveyed by
[41:52] the very thing the impulse that was
[41:54] within them. It is to carry some burden
[41:57] or to be conveyed. And the suggestion is
[42:00] that it is to be conveyed with force or
[42:05] speed. Something that is like driven by
[42:08] a wind. And that is why and I'll refer
[42:10] to the scripture later on. The coming of
[42:13] the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
[42:15] was as a mighty rushing wind. It was a
[42:20] force. And the force wasn't just some
[42:23] phenomena but it was something that
[42:25] entered them and they became a part of
[42:28] this force and they could not understand
[42:31] it always but they were being driven by
[42:34] this force and this to be moved is of
[42:38] persons they've given an analogy here an
[42:41] example of persons that are born in a
[42:44] ship over the sea and a gust of wind or
[42:48] a rush of wind moves moves them and they
[42:52] don't have really any power over it. And
[42:54] as Jesus said, he uh when Nicodemus was
[42:58] asking him about being born again, he
[43:00] said, "The wind bloweth where it listeth
[43:03] and you hear the sound, but you don't
[43:06] know where it came from. You don't know
[43:08] where it's going." And under in other
[43:10] words, you don't understand its origin,
[43:13] and you don't understand its its
[43:15] objective, but you know that you're
[43:18] caught in it.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that you're born again.
[43:21] When you're born again, you know that
[43:23] you've been born again. But perhaps you
[43:25] don't understand why why God called you
[43:28] and what he's going to do with you. And
[43:30] it's a good thing that we don't.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; God moved
[43:36] uh by his word or his breath. And he
[43:41] breathed this through his prophets for
[43:44] the purpose of bringing change. That was
[43:48] the purpose. To bring change, to bring
[43:50] deliverance, to bring redemption, to
[43:54] bring restoration, and at times to bring
[43:58] judgment.
[44:00] All of those God moved through them.
[44:03] Once it was spoken, it didn't
[44:06] necessarily happen right then. Sometimes
[44:09] didn't take place for some years later
[44:12] or even centuries later. But once it was
[44:16] spoken by God, that's God's word, it
[44:19] will happen.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; You have confidence in that?
[44:22] &gt;&gt; It will happen. And now we have a
[44:26] promise which is spoken by a prophet in
[44:29] this day. And this is what he has said
[44:32] and Christ revealed in his own word.
[44:35] Prophets did not always understand what
[44:38] they were writing or what they were
[44:41] saying or they would have in no wise
[44:45] have said it. They couldn't have they
[44:48] couldn't understand it. So now a prophet
[44:51] speaks things that he doesn't even
[44:53] understand completely understand. And he
[44:56] said if they did understand it they
[44:58] would not have said it.
[45:00] Think how farreaching,
[45:02] how maybe it would have been frightening
[45:04] to them to speak such words that had
[45:07] such a profound effect. They would maybe
[45:10] speak some words to uh a a number of
[45:13] people not realizing that this is going
[45:16] to affect the entire nation and perhaps
[45:18] other nations also.
[45:22] Uh uh here here's two quotes that I want
[45:25] to give you right now with a promise and
[45:28] that's why I have called it moved by the
[45:30] Holy Ghost in the bride age
[45:34] in the spoken words the original seed
[45:37] brother Brandham makes this uh makes
[45:39] this not a comment but a promise
[45:43] said notice what harmony he's giving an
[45:46] example what harmony Jesus never did
[45:49] anything until he seen the father or the
[45:53] father showed him first. Now he calls
[45:55] that harmony. That was real oneness.
[46:00] The harmony between God and Christ. And
[46:02] he goes to John 5 and 19. So will the
[46:06] bride. So will the bride. And he shows
[46:10] her his word of life. And she receives
[46:14] it. She never doubts it.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Now let's listen closely. Nothing can
[46:20] harm her.
[46:21] not even death. For if the seed be
[46:24] planted, the water will raise it up
[46:27] again. He said, "Here is the secret.
[46:34] The word is in the bride
[46:38] and the mind of Christ to know what he
[46:42] wants done with the word." Here's not
[46:46] only the secret, but men of God were
[46:48] moved as they as as by the Holy Spirit.
[46:53] They were moved and they spake. Men of
[46:55] God spake as they were moved. That's not
[46:59] 2,000 years ago or 3,000 years ago. That
[47:02] is in our time. Holy men of God spake as
[47:07] they were moved by the Holy Ghost. And
[47:10] when they spake, it was God pouring
[47:13] through as it were. Uh uh just an
[47:16] orphice, a very small opening. He was
[47:20] pouring through. As brother Brandham
[47:22] said, uh as as he was functioning and
[47:25] operating in that prophetic office, said
[47:28] to me, it it was like 10,000 volts going
[47:31] through a small wire.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Just think of it now. But now it wasn't
[47:36] God just pouring those 10,000 votes or
[47:39] pouring this mass
[47:42] content of his word which would be
[47:45] specifically the the promise for that
[47:48] hour. It was the God of life, the author
[47:51] of life, the author of eternal life. It
[47:54] is the creator of heavens and earth. It
[47:57] is the God of the universe. It's the God
[47:59] that fills all time and space. And now
[48:02] he's got a certain word that has been
[48:04] held and prophesied by the prophets for
[48:07] a certain hour. And he's got to pour the
[48:10] revelation of that word into that
[48:13] messenger to let him know this is the
[48:16] moment. This is the hour. And the people
[48:19] who are to receive it are here.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; They're also living. I have also raised
[48:24] them up. You must give this word out.
[48:27] And so it pours through that little port
[48:30] as it were, that orphice as it were,
[48:32] that little fine wire. And then it and
[48:35] then it and then it begins to it's
[48:37] dissemination.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Then it begins to flow out. And from
[48:42] that individual, it is it's received by
[48:45] others. And the bride knows what he
[48:48] wants done with the word. She has the
[48:51] word in her. And she has the mind of
[48:54] Christ. So she has that. So she knows
[48:57] what to do with it
[49:03] &gt;&gt; in Pergamine Pergaman church age. Notice
[49:07] how the same phrases he used. He starts
[49:11] out, notice the harmony of the father
[49:13] and the son just exactly. And these are
[49:17] these are messages that are not
[49:20] together. They're a distance apart in
[49:23] time. Jesus never did anything until it
[49:27] was first showed him by the father. John
[49:30] 5:19.
[49:32] This harmony is now in existence. I'm
[49:35] sorry. This harmony is now to exist
[49:38] between the groom and his bride. He
[49:41] shows her his word of life. She receives
[49:43] it. She never doubts it. Same same
[49:46] words.
[49:48] Therefore, nothing can harm her, not
[49:50] even death. For if the seed be planted,
[49:52] the water will raise it up again. Said,
[49:55] here is the secret of this. The word is
[49:58] in the bride as it was in Mary.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; The word has the m the bride has the
[50:05] mind of Christ for she knows what he
[50:09] wants done with the word. I just want to
[50:12] stop there and say this on the authority
[50:15] of this promise. Those you that those of
[50:19] you who believe with all your heart and
[50:21] soul, I am a member of the bride of
[50:24] Jesus Christ. You do know that God
[50:27] raised you up in this day. You know,
[50:30] you've been born. You have earthly
[50:32] parents, but your life has gone perhaps
[50:35] in a strange direction. Others may not
[50:38] have seen it as such a strange
[50:40] direction, but you haven't lived it all
[50:42] out yet. So, it's gone in a strange
[50:44] direction. I can say to you
[50:46] authoratively, the bride, we know what
[50:50] he wants done with this word.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; We may not always find it easy or simple
[51:00] as simple task, but we know what he
[51:02] wants done with the word. And by God's
[51:05] grace, we're getting that word out. We
[51:08] know he wants us to believe it. So,
[51:10] we've believed it. He know we know he
[51:13] wants us as witnesses. So we're
[51:15] witnesses. We know that he wants us to
[51:17] to propagate and to publicize a message.
[51:21] And so we are attempting to do that. We
[51:23] know what he wants done with the word.
[51:25] Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; So Paul said also
[51:33] and when in the book of Acts and Silas
[51:37] and Timoththeus Timoththeus
[51:40] uh were come from Macedonia,
[51:43] Paul was pressed in the spirit and
[51:46] testified to the Jews that Jesus was the
[51:50] Christ. It wasn't just something that he
[51:52] had learned and he had heard and say,
[51:53] "Oh, let me tell you what I heard." No,
[51:56] it wasn't just that way. He was pressed
[51:59] pressed in his spirit.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; He had to tell them. This was this was
[52:04] something that God was issuing through
[52:06] him. He He It wasn't even something
[52:08] within his own control. He had to say
[52:11] it.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; He had to do it.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; I'm stressing this. Paul also said in
[52:17] Romans, "And when Silas, I'm sorry, I am
[52:21] a debtor both to the Greeks and to the
[52:24] barbarians, both to the wise and to the
[52:28] unwise." And this debtor is a very, very
[52:30] interesting word. If Paul was a debtor,
[52:33] we're also debtors.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Would you agree with me?
[52:37] A debtor of course is one who owes
[52:40] another.
[52:42] One held by some obligation,
[52:45] bound by some duty. That's a debtor. And
[52:49] it comes from a second compound word to
[52:53] to be bound by debt and and a a even a
[52:58] little bit further to be guilty.
[53:00] Now, uh to be bound by debt, I'm I
[53:04] wouldn't ask
[53:06] who of us here don't have debts because
[53:09] there probably be very few. We all owe
[53:11] something. And it's amazing thing what
[53:14] you owe. It just gnaws on you. Just
[53:18] stays there all the time. You might
[53:20] forget it for a little while, but it's
[53:22] just there. That credit card, I just
[53:25] like to chop the thing up and get rid of
[53:27] it. And the people said,
[53:30] &gt;&gt; "Oh, that's what I thought.
[53:34] just, oh, I just can't wait till this
[53:36] car is paid off. Oh, I can't wait till
[53:39] this and when something is paid off, it
[53:42] just you feel so light.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; How come? Oh, that debt is gone. Well,
[53:48] Paul says, I'm a debtor. I've got a
[53:50] burden. I'm bound. I'm bound to this. I
[53:54] have an obligation. I have a duty. I
[53:56] can't shake it off because my debtor is
[53:58] to them. My debt is to the barbarians.
[54:01] My debt is to the Jews or whoever. I'm a
[54:04] debtor. That thing was weighing on him.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture? It weighed
[54:09] on him. You know, when the when the word
[54:12] of God is weighing upon us, the pressure
[54:15] of the word to to do because the bride
[54:17] has the mind of Christ and has the word.
[54:21] So, we don't just have the word and say,
[54:22] "Oh, I got such a wonderful treasure. Oh
[54:24] my goodness, this is so glorious."
[54:26] That's not what it is. It's a weight.
[54:30] It's a pressure
[54:32] &gt;&gt; because there's something to be done
[54:34] with that word.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; I have uh
[54:42] I have really pondered and I've spoken
[54:46] over the years a number of times. I've
[54:49] spoken about Tamar,
[54:52] Rahab,
[54:54] Ruth,
[54:56] and Ba Sheba.
[54:58] and Mary, of course, the five women that
[55:02] are in the first verse of the New
[55:04] Testament, not the first verse, but the
[55:06] first two verses of the New Testament.
[55:10] And the record of these women, I have
[55:11] detailed them and it would take a whole
[55:14] service, but I detailed regarding Tamar
[55:18] as the daughter-in-law of Judah and how
[55:20] she
[55:22] deceived really her father-in-law
[55:24] when he would not give her the youngest
[55:28] son. Her her husband died.
[55:31] God slew the second brother who was
[55:33] supposed to take her to wife but
[55:35] wouldn't give her seed. He spilled the
[55:37] seed in the ground. And God slew him.
[55:40] And the other boy, Sheila, was young.
[55:43] And so,
[55:45] excuse me. So, uh, Judah said, "Go to
[55:48] your father's house and put on the
[55:50] garments of widowhood." And then you
[55:53] know the story how that she then heard
[55:57] of uh, Judas coming with his friend to
[56:00] shear the sheep near their place. And so
[56:03] she put on the garments of harlotry,
[56:07] changed her garments. And to you young
[56:09] ladies, brother Brandham actually spoke
[56:11] about it. Don't don't take it out of
[56:13] context because it's very much in
[56:14] context the way women dress today. And
[56:18] he put it to prostitution and harlotry.
[56:21] There is garments of harlotry even back
[56:23] then. And there is garments of
[56:25] widowhood. She put on the garment of
[56:27] widowhood and then put on the garments
[56:30] of harlotry and sat by the roadside. And
[56:32] Judah went by, saw her, and and asked if
[56:36] he could come into her, uh, which he
[56:38] did. But she said, "What will you give
[56:40] me?" And he said, "Well, I'll give you
[56:42] this ring or this bracelet. I give He
[56:44] gave her three objects." And she took
[56:47] those objects and became pregnantated by
[56:49] Judah's seed.
[56:51] And Judah Judah went home and heard
[56:55] later that his daughter-in-law was
[56:58] pregnant. And he called and said, "Bring
[57:01] her here and burn her for the penalty of
[57:05] what she had done." And when and when
[57:08] they brought her to him, he he said she
[57:12] said, "Before you burn me, before you do
[57:15] this, uh here are the objects of the man
[57:19] of whose child I'm carrying." And handed
[57:22] him his own things. And he said, "Tammer
[57:27] is more righteous than I am."
[57:31] &gt;&gt; But I and I have said
[57:34] because I've been so impressed by it for
[57:36] a number of years, she was not merely
[57:39] wanting she didn't desire a husband.
[57:42] That's not in the book. She wasn't
[57:45] desiring a sexual relationship. That
[57:48] isn't why she was doing. She didn't even
[57:49] desire just a child. None of those
[57:52] things. There was a force
[57:57] &gt;&gt; driving her
[57:59] &gt;&gt; that goes beyond anything you could
[58:01] understand.
[58:03] She looked as it were with disdain upon
[58:06] the penalty. She scoffed at the stoning.
[58:10] She scoffed at the death and the
[58:12] disrespect it would bring her and
[58:14] everything else because she was being
[58:17] driven by a force.
[58:22] And it was none less than God. You can
[58:25] never understand that. But she literally
[58:27] by doing that placed herself in the
[58:30] genealogy as a mother, one of the
[58:32] mothers of Jesus Christ.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; This is the generation of Jesus Christ.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; The son of David, the son of Abraham.
[58:41] And the Bible tells us that Judah by
[58:44] Tamar brought forth Pharaohs. And five
[58:48] generations later from Ferris, five
[58:51] generations brought Solomon. Brother
[58:54] Brandham said Salman was an officer in
[58:56] the army of Israel. And it's in and and
[58:59] and uh uh Solomon then by Rahab Solomon
[59:04] took Rahab the harlot. And by Solomon by
[59:07] Rahab brought forth Boaz and Boaz by
[59:13] Ruth the Moabites. And if you take this
[59:16] uh h such a degraded background that
[59:20] they come from that Ruth came from the
[59:23] Moabites came the whole nation came by
[59:25] incestuous birth of Lot and his
[59:28] daughters and that was her background
[59:31] and you see that this you see the whole
[59:33] lineage and and you I I ask myself why
[59:37] you know they couldn't have had like
[59:39] Sarah or Esther or Rebecca or or Leah or
[59:45] some of these other great women of the
[59:47] scripture that didn't have this kind of
[59:50] background. Why couldn't they be in the
[59:52] lineage of Jesus Christ? But there was
[59:55] something in every one of these women,
[59:58] all four of them. They have one thing in
[1:00:00] common which I've spoken to you about
[1:00:02] previously, but others perhaps getting
[1:00:04] it now at a different level. Each one of
[1:00:06] them received seed. They received the
[1:00:09] right kind of seed. And that was what
[1:00:14] what they all have in common. All four
[1:00:16] of them. Tamar received Judah's seed. It
[1:00:19] had to be that way because Jesus in the
[1:00:22] Revelation the 5th chapter the 5th verse
[1:00:25] is called the lion of the tribe of
[1:00:28] Judah. And Satan was trying to
[1:00:30] extinguish that lineage.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; And God would not permit it. And he
[1:00:36] allowed a woman to to degrade herself in
[1:00:40] such utter disrespect and have such
[1:00:42] total abandonment to the penalty of of
[1:00:46] the burning and the stoning for her
[1:00:48] adultery and her harlotry. She just
[1:00:51] abandoned completely every kind of
[1:00:54] thought of of of what what she was
[1:00:58] stooping to because there was a force.
[1:01:00] You can only say this. There was a force
[1:01:03] within her that was causing her to do
[1:01:05] what wasn't acceptable to the public.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; The uncommon thing more than that, it
[1:01:14] was a force within her. And she and by
[1:01:17] doing so, that power within her, that
[1:01:19] force within her placed her into the New
[1:01:22] Testament as a one of the mothers of
[1:01:24] Jesus Christ.
[1:01:28] and Solomon by Rahab and Boaz by Ruth
[1:01:33] and David by Ba Sheba and I I couldn't
[1:01:37] that's why I made a comment with brother
[1:01:39] Caumbi who's incidentally preaching in
[1:01:40] Edmonton not right now and brother Diddy
[1:01:43] is there with him to interpret but uh
[1:01:46] he's began to speak about Ba Sheeba and
[1:01:49] I was bringing out to the people I spoke
[1:01:51] probably the last half hour on it down
[1:01:53] in Murphy'sboro and how Basheba
[1:01:57] her husband Uriah and he was such an
[1:02:00] honorable man. And David after Ba Sheba
[1:02:04] was pregnantated with his seed and in in
[1:02:07] a in a sinful way because he repents
[1:02:10] over his sin. If you read the first
[1:02:12] about 40 chapters of of the book of
[1:02:15] Psalms, you'll find many of those
[1:02:16] chapters of David's repentance. And
[1:02:18] that's why he was such a man after God's
[1:02:21] own heart. But because of that, God slew
[1:02:24] that child. But David wanted to make it
[1:02:25] out as though it was Uriah's. So he was
[1:02:27] and Uriah was a soldier in David's army.
[1:02:30] And so uh they made arrangement, send
[1:02:33] him to war. Send him into the battle
[1:02:35] now. Don't let him be back here. Send
[1:02:37] him to the battle. And Uriah slept on
[1:02:40] the on the steps all night. He said,
[1:02:42] "Me? Go in have pleasure with my wife
[1:02:44] and my my friends, my buddies are out
[1:02:46] here fighting. No way. I'll sleep on the
[1:02:49] steps all night." And he refused to be
[1:02:52] with his wife. And now David
[1:02:55] had no way around it. And so he told Jo
[1:02:58] uh Joab, I believe it was, his captain
[1:03:00] of the host, take him right to the front
[1:03:02] lines in the heat of the battle. And
[1:03:04] when the battle's hot, draw back and let
[1:03:07] him be slain.
[1:03:09] And Uriah was killed.
[1:03:13] And Ba Sheeba brings forth Solomon.
[1:03:16] And like I asked the people back in
[1:03:18] Murphy'sboro, and I've said it here
[1:03:20] before, I'll ask it again because the
[1:03:21] congregation's a little different and
[1:03:23] different people are streaming. Could
[1:03:26] anyone else bring forth Solomon?
[1:03:28] Solomon?
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; No. It had to be Ba Sheeba. You say, "I
[1:03:33] don't understand that." A good thing you
[1:03:35] don't understand it.
[1:03:39] But there is one thing that we do
[1:03:41] understand.
[1:03:42] You say, "Well, those things even the
[1:03:44] scripture speaks against them."
[1:03:47] Yes, but there's a there's a page here.
[1:03:51] These are this is between the Old
[1:03:52] Testament and the New Testament.
[1:03:57] And over here they did what they did
[1:03:59] because they were being pressed to do it
[1:04:01] by a force from within. And over here
[1:04:05] they're in the they're the mothers of
[1:04:06] Jesus. But between the Old Testament and
[1:04:09] the New Testament happens to be the
[1:04:10] Calvary and the cross and the blood.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; And everything from here was completely
[1:04:16] over here. Over here, brother Brandham
[1:04:18] said Abraham backslid. But over here it
[1:04:20] says nothing of that. Says he's a father
[1:04:22] of the faith. Over here, Jacob was a
[1:04:24] shy, but over here, he's not a shyer
[1:04:27] anymore.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Over here, men failed. Over here, men
[1:04:30] sinned. Over here, they did all kinds of
[1:04:32] things. But when he come right there,
[1:04:34] imagine going from that right into the
[1:04:37] right into the very lineage of Jesus
[1:04:40] Christ.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Where did you come from?
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Where did you come from? Born in sin and
[1:04:46] shaped in iniquities. And you come onto
[1:04:49] the other side. And now you are you are
[1:04:51] the embodiment of the New Testament.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Not just in the lineage of Jesus Christ,
[1:04:58] the bride of Jesus Christ. And the bride
[1:05:01] knows what he wants done with his word
[1:05:04] because she's even heard his secrets.
[1:05:06] She's heard his she's heard his
[1:05:08] whispering. She's heard it. And he said
[1:05:11] she's received it.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Is it all right?
[1:05:20] I've attempted to understand this and I
[1:05:24] think that there's something more for us
[1:05:26] to try to grasp what was driving them.
[1:05:32] Each renounced
[1:05:34] what was regarded as honorable
[1:05:38] loss of character.
[1:05:40] They yielded themselves with total total
[1:05:44] abandonment to the higher calling of the
[1:05:48] spirit of God within them. And I said
[1:05:50] that all four of them had one thing in
[1:05:52] common and that was this. They all
[1:05:55] received seed. I know I've said this
[1:05:57] before. I want to say it again.
[1:06:00] Tamar received Judah's seed.
[1:06:05] Rahab received Solomon's seed.
[1:06:10] Ruth received Bo's seed. Boaz's seed.
[1:06:15] And Ba Sheba received David's seed.
[1:06:19] And when they received the seed,
[1:06:22] one that was a harlot, Rahab was lifted
[1:06:25] up into the motherhood of Jesus.
[1:06:29] And when Ruth received Boaz's seed, she
[1:06:32] Boaz didn't lower himself. She was
[1:06:35] lifted up.
[1:06:37] and Ba Sheeba, she was lifted up to be
[1:06:40] the queen and to bring forth Solomon.
[1:06:42] And the prophet said Solomon actually
[1:06:45] brought forth, he said, essentially a a
[1:06:47] millennium
[1:06:49] in Israel,
[1:06:52] the most glorious kingdom. And the
[1:06:54] wisest of men brought forth this from Ba
[1:06:57] Sheeba. Couldn't come any other way. And
[1:07:00] in the end time,
[1:07:02] here comes an age. I'm going to be all
[1:07:05] ages. Better look at my watch and keep
[1:07:08] it here. Should I or should I not?
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll just look at it now and turn
[1:07:13] it over.
[1:07:16] The age
[1:07:20] they had a almost like a millennial age
[1:07:23] and now we are in another age and we
[1:07:28] have received the word for this whole
[1:07:30] age, for this whole time. And I want to
[1:07:33] I want to focus and concentrate on that
[1:07:35] a wee bit on the age and and uh what it
[1:07:39] what it means to us and the message that
[1:07:42] God has sent us.
[1:07:57] I'd like to use a few examples if I
[1:07:59] could please from the ages that the
[1:08:03] world has gone through. And I want you
[1:08:06] to think of them as I speak of them for
[1:08:08] just a few moments. The ages that the
[1:08:10] world the world has gone through
[1:08:12] distinct ages. Great shifts in humanity
[1:08:16] have taken place and sometimes it was
[1:08:20] driven by a force that would come
[1:08:22] through one individual and he may change
[1:08:25] the whole uh the the the entire picture
[1:08:28] of the entire globe just one person. Uh
[1:08:33] and these periods of civilization now
[1:08:35] are are overlaid
[1:08:38] by the church ages because only a
[1:08:40] prophet could identify the church age.
[1:08:43] So he describes the church age but we
[1:08:46] know from history that there are certain
[1:08:48] things that have happened and uh we're
[1:08:50] we're acquainted I'm sure with the what
[1:08:53] is called the age of the renaissance
[1:08:56] and the age of the renaissance was from
[1:08:58] the 1400s into the 1500s or thereabout.
[1:09:03] Renaissance is a French word that means
[1:09:06] rebirth.
[1:09:08] And historians consider the Renaissance
[1:09:10] to be the beginning of modern history.
[1:09:15] And during these years, popes, now this
[1:09:18] is just historical, but they go back to
[1:09:20] the religious part of it. During these
[1:09:22] years or the years of the Renaissance,
[1:09:25] popes strove to make Rome the capital of
[1:09:28] Christendom. So now that's what was
[1:09:31] happening there. and while projecting it
[1:09:34] through art and architecture and
[1:09:37] literature as the center of the golden
[1:09:40] age of unity, of order, and of peace. So
[1:09:45] now, of course, we in the message we've
[1:09:49] had uh brother Brandham literally took
[1:09:52] the cloak and tore it off of Rome and
[1:09:56] exposed her completely. And he had to
[1:09:59] because he's a messenger. And in
[1:10:01] Revelation, it says concerning her that
[1:10:04] her skirts, she's full of adultery
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; and the kings of the earth have
[1:10:11] committed adultery with her. But way
[1:10:13] back then, even in the age, the age of
[1:10:16] the Renaissance when the world, the
[1:10:18] population, humanity was recognizing,
[1:10:22] oh, this is a glorious age. This is a
[1:10:24] wonderful age. modern things were coming
[1:10:27] into into art and this was a great
[1:10:31] artist of Michelangelo and and da Vinci
[1:10:33] and some of these people were were
[1:10:35] coming at that time and that's when a
[1:10:37] lot of the masters and of art and
[1:10:40] science and civilization was advancing
[1:10:43] but during that time also there's a a
[1:10:46] spiritual thing that was happening at
[1:10:48] the same time then there's the age of
[1:10:50] the industrialization
[1:10:52] the age of industrial revolution ution.
[1:10:55] A period from the 18th centuries when
[1:10:58] major changes in agriculture and
[1:11:02] manufacturing and transportation had a
[1:11:05] profound effect upon the entire globe at
[1:11:09] that time and the those conditions
[1:11:11] spread spread they said throughout
[1:11:13] Europe and North America and eventually
[1:11:16] the world. Then I'm not going to belabor
[1:11:19] these because I want to stay on the
[1:11:20] spiritual side. And now in the age of
[1:11:23] technology, there isn't anyone here who
[1:11:26] could give me a sound answer. I would
[1:11:29] like to have it. if you have it. Why?
[1:11:31] From just after all these thousands of
[1:11:34] years and great intellectual men and
[1:11:37] brother Brandham, I'm well aware of what
[1:11:39] he said about the days of Noah and how
[1:11:41] advanced they were and the atomic power
[1:11:44] that they had and the pyramids that were
[1:11:47] built. I'm well aware of that. But why
[1:11:49] is it that man has gone for all these
[1:11:52] centuries of time smart men, intelligent
[1:11:55] men, committed men, I mean they were
[1:11:59] they were given to causes but somehow
[1:12:01] they were not able to put together the
[1:12:04] elements. They were not able to bring
[1:12:06] together the what was going to take
[1:12:09] place in the industrial revolution and
[1:12:11] the te the revolution of technology.
[1:12:14] These are ages that actually took place.
[1:12:17] Not periods of time that I I'm not
[1:12:19] interested in the periods of time, but
[1:12:22] these things took place. And just from
[1:12:23] the early 1800s, look where we are.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Look where we are just from the 1900s
[1:12:29] forward.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; It says of Martin Luther. Now, Martin
[1:12:35] Luther was born November the 10th,
[1:12:38] yesterday, anniversary of yesterday,
[1:12:42] in an extremely tense world in 1483.
[1:12:47] That's when he was born. And Luther set
[1:12:50] off on his last trip on January 17th,
[1:12:54] 1546.
[1:12:56] And on 1455,
[1:12:59] the first Bible is printed in 1455.
[1:13:03] Now that's when printing. So printing
[1:13:05] was starting in that era of time and God
[1:13:09] was allowing that. I mean there isn't
[1:13:11] anyone here that would that would
[1:13:14] suggest that wasn't that God wasn't
[1:13:16] aware of that. God was allowing that.
[1:13:18] God has used that. He's used the
[1:13:21] technology. He used the advancement. But
[1:13:23] now here's Rome and here's the rest of
[1:13:26] the world. They're all enraptured with
[1:13:29] all all this architecture and this
[1:13:31] advancement and the renaissance and all
[1:13:33] of this. They're going one direction.
[1:13:35] God's going another direction.
[1:13:41] And during this time, do you think the
[1:13:44] 68 million martyrs that died, young and
[1:13:48] old, no doubt children and teenagers
[1:13:52] like you teenagers sitting here and if
[1:13:55] you are facing the stake or facing the
[1:13:57] guillotine or facing death for your for
[1:14:01] going to Cloverdale Bible Way, I'd like
[1:14:04] to know this morning, what would your
[1:14:05] stand be just where would you be when it
[1:14:08] came right down to the fine wire? But
[1:14:12] there was something within the bride of
[1:14:15] that age. There was a spirit upon her
[1:14:18] that she had received a spirit pressing
[1:14:21] through her to fulfill the word of God
[1:14:24] for that hour.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; And she was anointed with the ox spirit.
[1:14:29] And she couldn't understand it. They
[1:14:30] couldn't understand it. The young people
[1:14:32] couldn't understand it. Deacons couldn't
[1:14:34] understand it. They couldn't understand
[1:14:35] it. But they were driven to it.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; And that same power I say is in the
[1:14:44] bride today. It has to be because what
[1:14:47] we have today is the accumulation of the
[1:14:50] lion age and the man age and the ox age
[1:14:53] and the eagle age. We have it all today.
[1:14:57] That's not to make you feel good, but
[1:14:59] that's to cause you to feel a sense of
[1:15:01] responsibility. also say, "Oh, God, let
[1:15:05] me give myself over to this." We're not
[1:15:07] here just to go to school or just to go
[1:15:10] to a job. We're not here just to make a
[1:15:12] living and to pay our bills. We're here
[1:15:15] for a much higher calling.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; And yet all of those things, these
[1:15:20] people work, these people worked the
[1:15:21] field, these people planted, these
[1:15:23] people harvested, they worked and worked
[1:15:25] hard. And these the things that the
[1:15:28] people did was just their ordinary life.
[1:15:30] I I can just tell you that Rahab, even
[1:15:32] after the even after the two spies were
[1:15:35] there and even showed her the token and
[1:15:38] told her where to put it, she was still
[1:15:40] a harlot.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; She was a harlot till she received seed.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; And you and I in this age, in this
[1:15:47] darkest of ages, in this most deceived
[1:15:50] of age, God sent a prophet with the
[1:15:53] original spoken word, which he said is
[1:15:56] the spoken word seed.
[1:15:59] Hallelujah.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham wasn't lower a lower
[1:16:03] class of a prophet because he went to
[1:16:05] the denominations or he went to all of
[1:16:07] these places or he went to the Christian
[1:16:09] businessmen. Not at all. Then the seed
[1:16:12] came out of his mouth. The bride that
[1:16:15] was out there received that seed and she
[1:16:17] was elevated.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Tamar was elevated. Ruth was elevated.
[1:16:23] Rahab was elevated. Basha was elevated.
[1:16:26] And the bride today is elevated.
[1:16:29] By receiving the seed only one thing and
[1:16:32] we have that in common with the mothers
[1:16:34] of Jesus
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; they received the seed each one of them
[1:16:38] received the seed and you and I can say
[1:16:40] today I've received the seed
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; and if the seed did that for them what
[1:16:45] will the seed do for you
[1:16:47] brought them into the lineage of Jesus
[1:16:49] Christ the seed in my day I'm
[1:16:51] pregnantated with a seed the living word
[1:16:53] of God spoken by the bridegroom and made
[1:16:56] me his wife
[1:16:58] Hallelujah.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; We can praise God. Give glory to him.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther caused a wave,
[1:17:14] a revolution.
[1:17:16] He was considered a rebel.
[1:17:19] It was just his daily life.
[1:17:21] I think a man that brought great change
[1:17:25] to Israel at least was Ben David
[1:17:27] Bengurion.
[1:17:30] That little wire with his hair out like
[1:17:33] Einstein.
[1:17:35] But yet I tell you what, friends, they
[1:17:38] were burning with such a such a desire,
[1:17:41] more than a desire. A force
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; was within them. The world call it
[1:17:46] Zionism. They didn't care what you call
[1:17:48] it. They knew one thing. This land is
[1:17:50] ours. This promise is ours. And the word
[1:17:53] of God is true. And they've promised
[1:17:55] this land. That's what they and they
[1:17:57] were consumed with. Shoot me, kill me,
[1:18:00] burn me, do what you want to do. But you
[1:18:02] can't change the promise of God.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; I hope this is a life-changing message
[1:18:10] for a lot of people here today and a lot
[1:18:12] of people that will listen to it in the
[1:18:14] future. I have such a great passion
[1:18:16] within my heart. I can't describe it.
[1:18:18] It's a force.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; I have to get this word out.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; We have to make it known. We have to
[1:18:26] live it. And it's not in word only, but
[1:18:29] it's in power and demonstration of the
[1:18:32] Holy Ghost.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe the sick should
[1:18:35] still be healed.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; I don't relegate that to a second Paul.
[1:18:39] The sick should still be healed. It's a
[1:18:42] promise of God. Those bound should be
[1:18:45] delivered. It's a shame to remain bound.
[1:18:48] It's a shame to remain in that depressed
[1:18:51] state. Shake it off in the name of Jesus
[1:18:53] Christ.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's our God. That's a
[1:18:58] demonstration of the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; We won't take those acts away from him.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; This is the bride's portion.
[1:19:12] We think of these men who had a great
[1:19:16] influence on the earth and changed it
[1:19:18] and brought in a different age
[1:19:22] and operating within their age. They
[1:19:24] weren't caught up with am I in the right
[1:19:26] day or or not. They just knew that
[1:19:29] that's the day God brought them.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; I've been really affected also. I don't
[1:19:35] want to preach on it or say much about
[1:19:37] it.
[1:19:38] But I maybe because of my age or the
[1:19:42] where I'm at in my life,
[1:19:45] but I really try to come to grips with
[1:19:49] just beyond. I say, well,
[1:19:53] oh, you know, the change of our body and
[1:19:55] all these things and the rapture and I
[1:19:57] just can't wait. But I I I ponder and I
[1:20:00] spent a lot of time pondering and you
[1:20:03] also want to do it. When you actually
[1:20:05] cross over,
[1:20:08] what then?
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; When you actually cross over,
[1:20:15] what then?
[1:20:18] When we actually give an account
[1:20:21] for our deeds in our life,
[1:20:24] what then?
[1:20:27] Are we people that tear apart
[1:20:31] or are we people that bring together?
[1:20:33] Are we people that build bridges? I've
[1:20:35] I've actually dedicated my life to seek
[1:20:39] to build bridges.
[1:20:41] I think that is a more honorable thing.
[1:20:44] Anybody can do anything else. Anybody
[1:20:46] can be destructive. And it's not hard to
[1:20:49] tear down, but it's really hard to build
[1:20:50] up. And I've done some tall thinking
[1:20:53] about that. When we cross over, what
[1:20:57] then?
[1:20:58] Brother Brandham said in the resume of
[1:21:00] the church ages,
[1:21:03] "Lu had the spirit of God, but his age
[1:21:07] was not the age of full restoration."
[1:21:12] By another outpouring, by another
[1:21:14] outpouring like in the beginning, it was
[1:21:17] the same with Wesley, Booth, Knox,
[1:21:22] Whitfield, Brinard, Jonathan Edwards,
[1:21:27] Mueller, etc. These are great men that
[1:21:30] you have heard about or perhaps even
[1:21:32] read about. Surely they were full of the
[1:21:35] Holy Ghost. Yes,
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; they certainly were.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; But the age in which each lived was not
[1:21:44] the age of restoration.
[1:21:52] And the age
[1:21:54] that you
[1:21:56] have been raised up in
[1:21:59] happens to be the age of full
[1:22:02] restoration.
[1:22:05] Hallelujah.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Oh God, let the fullness of even that
[1:22:10] praise literally grip every person
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; so that your energy and your strength
[1:22:16] and your vitality and your youth and
[1:22:19] your resources is consumed with that.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; I don't want God I don't want to have to
[1:22:27] step into God's presence if I dropped
[1:22:30] from a heart attack this afternoon. I
[1:22:32] don't want to step in God's presence and
[1:22:34] have him say,
[1:22:37] "I raised you in the age of full
[1:22:38] restoration."
[1:22:42] You heard a most glorious message.
[1:22:45] You saw the light of it shed over the
[1:22:49] earth.
[1:22:52] What did you do
[1:22:55] with it? What did you occupy yourself
[1:22:57] with?
[1:22:58] What was your main purpose in life? And
[1:23:02] you know, God doesn't have to ask those
[1:23:03] questions because it'll flood our own
[1:23:05] soul.
[1:23:15] He says it's the age of they didn't have
[1:23:17] the age of full restoration.
[1:23:19] Neither was any any age but this last
[1:23:24] age.
[1:23:25] I want you to go home today after the
[1:23:28] service realizing that the bride age is
[1:23:32] an age of full restoration.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Full restoration,
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; not full
[1:23:41] desperation as such. Not full
[1:23:43] despondency,
[1:23:45] not full defeat, full restoration.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Now, that's a vindicated prophet's
[1:23:53] words. Do with it what you wish, but I'm
[1:23:55] making you responsible for that word. It
[1:23:58] is a age of full restoration.
[1:24:03] The bride age in the Leodysian age. This
[1:24:06] is how it's described. Our age, God says
[1:24:10] this church of the Leodysian age is
[1:24:13] wretched. The word comes from two Greek
[1:24:16] words which means endure and trial. And
[1:24:19] it has nothing to do with the trials
[1:24:21] that come to a true Christian for God of
[1:24:25] for God. Uh it describes a Christian in
[1:24:28] a trial as blessed and his attitude one
[1:24:32] of joy whereas his description is
[1:24:35] phrased as wretched and miserable. How
[1:24:38] strange it is. He said how strange it is
[1:24:40] in this age, this age of plenty.
[1:24:46] This age of progress,
[1:24:50] this age of abundance,
[1:24:53] how can there be trials?
[1:24:57] Well, now he said it is strange. But in
[1:25:00] this age of plenty and opportunity
[1:25:04] when everyone has so much and there is
[1:25:06] so much more to be had
[1:25:13] with what? With all the inventions to do
[1:25:16] our work and so many things to give us
[1:25:19] pleasure, suddenly
[1:25:22] we find mental illness taking such a
[1:25:25] toll as to alarm the nation when
[1:25:29] everybody ought to be happy with reality
[1:25:32] with really nothing to be unhappy about.
[1:25:34] Millions are taking sedatives at night,
[1:25:38] pep pills in the morning, rushing to
[1:25:40] doctors, entering institutions, and
[1:25:43] trying to drown out unknown fears by
[1:25:47] alcohol.
[1:25:50] Yes. He said, "This age boasts of its
[1:25:52] tremendous stores of worldly goods, but
[1:25:55] the people are less happy than ever.
[1:25:59] This age boasts of spiritual
[1:26:01] attainments, but the people are less
[1:26:04] sure of themselves than ever. This age
[1:26:07] boasts of better moral values. And it is
[1:26:11] it is more corrupt than any age since
[1:26:15] the flood.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; That happens to be the age, friends.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, we need the Holy
[1:26:26] Spirit. We need the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; We need this same thing that moved. Holy
[1:26:34] men of God
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; to speak.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; The scripture says they spake, but they
[1:26:39] didn't just speak. They spake as they
[1:26:41] were moved.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; There has to be a possession. There's
[1:26:45] something within the individual. And the
[1:26:47] prophet of God has said already, the
[1:26:49] bride has the mind of Christ.
[1:26:54] And the Holy Spirit is here to drive and
[1:26:56] cause us to do the right thing, to say
[1:27:00] the right thing. And sometimes it it it
[1:27:02] will dep it will require us to have a
[1:27:05] complete abandonment.
[1:27:16] I hate using
[1:27:18] personal examples,
[1:27:23] but when
[1:27:25] when I resigned to the position that I
[1:27:27] thought that God had given me and I
[1:27:30] thought it was just the most wonderful
[1:27:33] answer to prayer. I always wanted to
[1:27:37] just be able to go to small churches and
[1:27:40] and do evangelistic work. Hadn't come to
[1:27:42] the knowledge of the message yet. I just
[1:27:44] I knew brother Brandham's ministry had
[1:27:46] met him now and was was coming into a
[1:27:48] knowledge that the there was a
[1:27:50] completely different uh different
[1:27:53] message that he was bringing. Didn't
[1:27:55] know the message as we do today at all.
[1:27:58] I just knew this was, you know, uh great
[1:28:01] understanding of the word of God. But I
[1:28:03] was being gripped in my heart and I knew
[1:28:06] that I was on a different course and on
[1:28:08] a different direction. But at the same
[1:28:10] time, you know, I worked for a man who
[1:28:13] loved me like his son and he just
[1:28:17] he just let me do whatever I want to do
[1:28:20] as long as the company was looked after.
[1:28:22] I could go preach. I could take services
[1:28:25] in the meetings and everything and for
[1:28:27] other pastors which I did and I could
[1:28:29] support myself and I never had to ask
[1:28:31] for an offering and never had to depend
[1:28:33] on anyone. And it was just wonderful.
[1:28:35] Just wonder. I thought that was the most
[1:28:36] glorious answer to prayer, you know. And
[1:28:39] then one day, one day I just, you know,
[1:28:42] just start feeling a force within.
[1:28:45] You're going to leave this. You got to
[1:28:46] leave this.
[1:28:49] No, that's that's I just push that
[1:28:52] aside. That's not possible. This is the
[1:28:54] answer to prayer. This is where I've
[1:28:56] always wanted to be for the Lord's work.
[1:29:00] And I couldn't get that away.
[1:29:03] Oh friends, it troubled me at night. So
[1:29:06] you're going to leave this. You're going
[1:29:08] to leave this.
[1:29:10] You know how long I pressed it down?
[1:29:12] Nine months. I pressed it down. I
[1:29:14] pressed away. Finally, I had two dreams.
[1:29:16] When I woke up out of those dreams, I
[1:29:19] knew God had already spoken to me
[1:29:20] sovereignly.
[1:29:25] And the clincher was then I I went and I
[1:29:28] went to another meeting down in
[1:29:30] Jeffersonville. And I'm standing outside
[1:29:33] and my wife and daughters are inside.
[1:29:35] They got a seat. And I'm standing
[1:29:37] outside and all the people flowing out,
[1:29:39] double doors. And I'm standing just oh
[1:29:42] crowd of people all around. I'm just
[1:29:43] standing there. And I got as I could see
[1:29:47] the pullpit right through between the
[1:29:49] heads of the people that were there.
[1:29:53] And uh I felt someone take a hold of my
[1:29:55] elbow and just nudge it like that and
[1:29:58] said it was Brother Doc Brand. Brother
[1:30:00] Brandham's brother says, "Oh, Brother
[1:30:02] Eddie." He said, "Brother Brandham just
[1:30:03] arrived. He'd like to see you." So, I I
[1:30:06] said, "Okay." So, I went with him, went
[1:30:07] to the back, and we stepped in that
[1:30:09] little little tiny office.
[1:30:12] And uh there he he's sitting with his
[1:30:15] actually his back he's facing the wall
[1:30:17] to a little we tiny desk like a
[1:30:19] student's desk in in a chair. And one
[1:30:22] other straight back chair right here.
[1:30:24] That's all it was in the one little desk
[1:30:27] and a chair he was in in this other
[1:30:29] chair. And brother Doc Brandham says,
[1:30:32] "Oh, brother Brandham, here's brother
[1:30:33] here, brother Eddie." Oh, he's Oh, my
[1:30:37] said, "Welcome, brother Eddie. It's so
[1:30:38] nice to see you." And he slid the other
[1:30:40] chair out and he said, "Sit down." You
[1:30:42] know, "Sit down."
[1:30:44] So I sat down and he slid his chair in
[1:30:46] front and uh uh our knees were touching
[1:30:51] and I just remembered that because you
[1:30:54] know I wasn't accustomed to that being
[1:30:57] that close and uh then he took my hands
[1:31:01] you know like this hold both hands. Oh,
[1:31:05] he said, "It's it's so nice to see you,
[1:31:07] Brother Eddie." And I said, "Yeah,
[1:31:08] Brother Brandham, it's nice to be here.
[1:31:12] I would love to have talked to him. I'd
[1:31:14] love to have bear my heart to him. I'd
[1:31:16] love to have tell him what I was
[1:31:18] struggling with, but uh this wasn't the
[1:31:23] opportune time. This wasn't the time."
[1:31:26] And and so he said, "Uh, so nice to see
[1:31:30] you." And I said, "Yes, Brother Brham.
[1:31:32] you know, maybe we'll we'll see each
[1:31:34] other this fall or something, you know,
[1:31:37] and uh and he put his head back like
[1:31:39] that. He said he kind of he closed his
[1:31:42] eyes and just kind of he would close his
[1:31:45] eyes a little bit like that. Said, "You
[1:31:46] know, every time I see you, Brother Ed,"
[1:31:48] he said, "I see Indians."
[1:31:54] I took my lip and I bit it. I didn't
[1:31:58] want to cry in front of him, but already
[1:32:00] I couldn't speak.
[1:32:02] And uh I said uh
[1:32:06] yeah, brother Brandham. He said, and
[1:32:08] then they started to sing only believe.
[1:32:10] And he said he said, "There's my queue."
[1:32:13] He said, "Uh uh." So he said, "Now I'd
[1:32:16] like you to really hear this, hear the
[1:32:19] message this morning, and I want you to
[1:32:20] sit here in my chair." And I said, "Oh,
[1:32:23] no, no." I got scared. I said, "No, no,
[1:32:24] no." I said, "I have a excellent place
[1:32:26] out there and I can see right there the
[1:32:28] pull pit." "No, no, no." He said, "I I
[1:32:30] want you to sit here." Said, "You can
[1:32:32] hear them. You can hear the service and
[1:32:34] you know, it'll be really nice. You'll
[1:32:35] be comfortable." I said, "No, Brother
[1:32:36] Brown, I I'll just go outside. I'll go
[1:32:39] outside where I was." No, no. He says,
[1:32:40] "I I want you to." So then he
[1:32:44] essentially helped me sit in a chair
[1:32:48] and I sat in in Brother Brandham's
[1:32:50] chair. And I'm ashamed to say I don't
[1:32:51] remember the service. I was I don't
[1:32:54] remember exactly what service it was. I
[1:32:56] whether it was the rising of the sun or
[1:32:58] one of those says, "I can tell you, you
[1:33:00] know, proving his word and different
[1:33:01] ones, but uh I I just can't remember
[1:33:04] exactly what day that was, but I sat in
[1:33:07] his chair and listened to him preach."
[1:33:09] But what I said, "All of this I'm
[1:33:12] getting a little personal this morning."
[1:33:14] I said, "All of this was because
[1:33:18] I had to come to a place of just total
[1:33:20] abandonment." It doesn't mean everybody
[1:33:22] has to leave their job. I'm not saying
[1:33:24] that at all. Everybody has to leave
[1:33:26] their comfort zone. I'm not saying that.
[1:33:28] But there comes times in a person's life
[1:33:32] when you don't really understand, but
[1:33:34] you know that there's a godly force.
[1:33:37] There's something within that's pressing
[1:33:40] you to do something beyond reason,
[1:33:43] beyond the acceptable. And when I went
[1:33:46] around and told some other people I'm
[1:33:47] leaving, they they thought I', you know,
[1:33:49] they thought I'd lost it. And I thought
[1:33:51] I'd lost it. And when I got here to
[1:33:54] Cloverdale and sitting in a 40-year-old
[1:33:56] house
[1:33:58] with an unfinished basement and a great
[1:34:00] big octopus of a of a furnace, oil,
[1:34:03] burning oil, and I left a nice
[1:34:05] four-bedroom,
[1:34:07] you know, brick home that the company
[1:34:10] was paying for and now I'm paying all
[1:34:12] the bills. It certainly didn't make any
[1:34:14] sense. And there are things that take
[1:34:17] place in our life. And so what I just
[1:34:19] said, I give this little interval in my
[1:34:22] message to let you know I'm not just
[1:34:24] preaching. I'm telling you something
[1:34:27] that's a reality in my own life. And we
[1:34:29] as believers, you've had to abandon
[1:34:32] families.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Brother, I think of the Walner family
[1:34:37] often.
[1:34:38] Uh I have such an admiration. I see
[1:34:41] brother Joe raise his hand. Such an
[1:34:44] admiration people to leave mother an
[1:34:47] aged mother
[1:34:50] to leave her in the colony
[1:34:52] in total abandonment and even take the
[1:34:56] young daughters
[1:34:58] sister Kathy came and later sister
[1:35:00] Marilyn
[1:35:02] to leave mother and your your mom and
[1:35:06] the reason I respect that is because
[1:35:08] I've had to ask myself would I be able
[1:35:10] to do that and you would if the if that
[1:35:15] force within you says I've got to get
[1:35:18] next to this. I've got to hear this.
[1:35:20] I've got to go to a certain place and
[1:35:23] listen the reason why I want to come to
[1:35:24] next Sunday is because there's there are
[1:35:27] other churches and so on. I have to
[1:35:29] myself I have to have a great respect.
[1:35:32] God God ordained what's happened here to
[1:35:36] happen
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; for a purpose that's more than I
[1:35:40] understand. Brother Ernie, I don't
[1:35:42] understand it all. I do not understand
[1:35:44] it. I'm here making a confession. I
[1:35:46] don't understand. But God brought the
[1:35:49] men and the women of certain talents and
[1:35:52] certain capabilities and certain just
[1:35:54] certain lives to live in this area as a
[1:35:58] testimony for Jesus Christ. And we can
[1:36:01] say today, we're the bride and we've
[1:36:04] heard the word. Hallelujah. that people
[1:36:07] come from Bosnia and Serbia, come from
[1:36:09] Yugoslavia, come from Germany, come from
[1:36:12] Europe, come from wherever, come from
[1:36:14] come from Russia, wherever we've come
[1:36:16] from. And we've come from all sorts of
[1:36:19] different backgrounds. But God knows
[1:36:21] what he's doing.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen for me? God knows what
[1:36:27] he's doing. He knows why you're sitting
[1:36:29] where you are today. He knows why you're
[1:36:31] hearing this service.
[1:36:34] He's seeking to quicken
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; that Holy Spirit and men of God spake as
[1:36:41] they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; We've been moved.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; We are greatly moved.
[1:36:54] Can I continue on for a few more
[1:36:56] moments, please?
[1:36:59] As they were moved with this force,
[1:37:01] God's prophets initiated waves of
[1:37:04] change.
[1:37:06] Micah said, the prophet Micah, he said,
[1:37:10] "But truly, I am full of power of the
[1:37:12] spirit of the Lord and of judgment and
[1:37:15] of might to declare unto Jacob his
[1:37:18] transgression and to Israel his sin."
[1:37:21] This is what he was moved by. And I can
[1:37:23] assure you it was not an easy task. And
[1:37:26] a prophet in this day comes up and takes
[1:37:28] Amos, the first chapter I think of Amos
[1:37:31] and begins to speak on the way of a true
[1:37:33] prophet. He says he come down off the
[1:37:36] hill and Israel was in his prosperity
[1:37:39] and his little bald head uh gleaming
[1:37:42] with the prospiration from the heat of
[1:37:44] the day and is stroking his beard and
[1:37:47] rubbing his head and coming down and
[1:37:49] seeing Israel in all of their all of
[1:37:51] their benefits and their soft living and
[1:37:54] their prosperous life and he had to come
[1:37:56] and start crying out against them. That
[1:37:58] was not an easy task. But I tell you
[1:38:01] today, friends, believe me with all your
[1:38:03] heart, there was a force within. There
[1:38:06] was a force within them. They had to
[1:38:07] declare it. And when brother Brandham
[1:38:09] stood up, a man so kind and so so loving
[1:38:13] as he was, stand up in this generation.
[1:38:15] Say, I indict this generation for the
[1:38:19] second crucifixion of Jesus Christ. That
[1:38:21] was not an easy task.
[1:38:26] Hallelujah.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; This speaks of John the Baptist. And he
[1:38:33] shall go before him in the spirit and
[1:38:36] power of Elias to turn the hearts of the
[1:38:40] fathers to the children. He shall go
[1:38:42] before him. And and and now you see that
[1:38:46] little uh
[1:38:49] fine wire,
[1:38:51] that little orphice, that little human
[1:38:53] vessel that this whole force of God
[1:38:58] said, "The hour has arrived.
[1:39:01] The seals must be open.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; The hour has arrived. The lamb is taking
[1:39:07] the book.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; The hour has arrived. The lion is going
[1:39:11] to rip the seals off. The hour has
[1:39:14] arrived. All the mysteries must be made
[1:39:17] known. Oh, my brother, my sister, what
[1:39:20] an hour. What an hour. What a day. The
[1:39:23] hour has arrived. And I've I've I
[1:39:25] brought up a vessel. I've crushed him.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; I spoke to you about it. I've crushed
[1:39:30] him.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; I've molded him. I put him through the
[1:39:35] fire in the furnace. I've taken his
[1:39:38] wife. I've taken his baby daughter. It
[1:39:41] was him begging me not to do it, but I
[1:39:45] took her anyway
[1:39:47] because the vessel had to be crushed.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; This is a vessel that's going to receive
[1:39:52] the word. This is a vessel that's going
[1:39:54] to receive the mysteries. This a vessel
[1:39:56] is going to call out my bride.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; I hope you're getting what I'm saying. I
[1:40:03] hope it's sinking in, friend.
[1:40:05] I hope you catch the burden of the word
[1:40:07] of the Lord today.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Not my words merely, but the burden of
[1:40:10] the word of the Lord. We're living in a
[1:40:12] different age.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Completely a different age.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; You're not of Leo Deal.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; You're not of the 21st century. You're
[1:40:22] eternal.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; You're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:27] You've been given the mind of God
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; by a prophet who was sent to this age to
[1:40:33] bring you into a bright age.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Not the age of the Renaissance, not the
[1:40:38] age of technology, not the age of
[1:40:39] industrialization, but the bride age.
[1:40:43] [Applause]
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Not even the seventh church age, but the
[1:40:46] bride age.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; This is the age of full restoration.
[1:40:51] This is the age when men and women are
[1:40:53] moved by the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:59] We do things we can't understand. We may
[1:41:02] move geographically and we cannot
[1:41:04] understand it. We may shift our
[1:41:07] occupation and we don't understand it.
[1:41:10] We may turn our back on success or we
[1:41:12] may turn our turn ourselves toward
[1:41:14] success because God needs it one way or
[1:41:16] the other. God knows. He knows what he's
[1:41:20] doing. He's placed you where you are.
[1:41:22] I'm preaching today that you'll have
[1:41:24] confidence that God Almighty is leading
[1:41:28] his people.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; And if you have any question about that,
[1:41:32] then you need to seek God on your own.
[1:41:35] Not just hear the sermon, but go to your
[1:41:37] place of prayer and say, "Oh God, I've
[1:41:39] heard the word
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; and I believe that word."
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:49] He said that this
[1:41:57] he speaks of this age. It talks about
[1:42:00] knowledge and science. Do we ever
[1:42:05] you get a computer or you get some
[1:42:07] gadget?
[1:42:10] Listen to me close.
[1:42:14] And it's it's almost antiquated before
[1:42:18] you get to know how to make it work.
[1:42:23] I got about a 70-year-old Mercedes car
[1:42:26] out there and uh bought it used
[1:42:31] after it was about six years old, I
[1:42:32] think it was. Maybe it's seven. It's
[1:42:34] coming out eight years old now. But
[1:42:36] anyway, the book to operate this thing
[1:42:38] is a catalog.
[1:42:41] I know how to stick the key in. I know
[1:42:44] how to start it. I know how to put it in
[1:42:46] reverse. And I know how to put it so it
[1:42:49] drives forward. I know how to operate
[1:42:51] the windows. And I figured out how to
[1:42:52] operate the seat. Perhaps not all the
[1:42:54] specialties of it, but I I've figured
[1:42:56] those things out.
[1:42:58] I haven't given myself any gold story
[1:43:00] yet. It's got a navigational system in
[1:43:03] it. It might as well be in the Titanic.
[1:43:06] I haven't got a clue how that thing
[1:43:07] works. I've tried to make it work and I
[1:43:09] can tell you that I'd be in Calamazoo,
[1:43:11] Michigan rather than where I need to go
[1:43:13] because I can't figure that thing out.
[1:43:15] Navigation. My goodness. You got to be a
[1:43:18] scientist to figure this thing out. Here
[1:43:21] are some of you smiling because you're
[1:43:22] in the same boat as I am. And I haven't
[1:43:25] read or studied this whole thing. I
[1:43:27] don't have time to study this catalog to
[1:43:30] figure out. And then I have tried to
[1:43:32] read it. I don't want you to think
[1:43:34] little too little of me, but I've tried
[1:43:36] to read it. I can't understand it.
[1:43:40] I remember the first computer that I
[1:43:42] ever got and brother Rod brought it to
[1:43:45] my house or at least
[1:43:48] I don't know where I got it. I think it
[1:43:49] was in a bankruptcy or something,
[1:43:50] brother Rod. And anyway, he came over to
[1:43:52] set the thing up for me and I I don't
[1:43:55] know. All it is is a big black terminal,
[1:43:57] big black screen to me. So, ah yeah, he
[1:44:01] says this thing, you know, it'll be
[1:44:02] simple. I'll set it all up. I've loaded
[1:44:04] up for you. It's good. All you have to
[1:44:05] do is turn it on. Says, "Okay,
[1:44:08] Rod's got a little a little evil streak
[1:44:11] in him."
[1:44:14] So,
[1:44:16] I got down in the morning. I was so
[1:44:18] excited, you know, I got my computer
[1:44:19] here just a and I turned it on and here
[1:44:24] comes some music. Yankee Doodle went to
[1:44:26] town. Went to town. I thought that's not
[1:44:29] the way. I said, "That's Rod Bergen for
[1:44:32] sure because I'm sure that's not what
[1:44:34] this thing's supposed to do." And so I
[1:44:37] hit another button. I read the book and
[1:44:40] it says, "Now you'll do this and there
[1:44:43] will be a cursor that will appear at the
[1:44:45] top left hand corner of the screen." And
[1:44:47] I hit the button. No, there's no cursor.
[1:44:51] I get on the phone. Brother Rod, I'm
[1:44:54] following these instructions right to
[1:44:56] the letter. I've hit the right button.
[1:44:58] says there will be a cursor on the left
[1:45:00] hand upper corner and there's no cursor
[1:45:02] there. He says, "Oh yeah, I said that
[1:45:04] just computers." What do you mean? You
[1:45:06] know, so that was my first lesson. It
[1:45:08] doesn't really mean what it says anyway.
[1:45:11] And it didn't give me a whole lot of
[1:45:12] confidence for the rest of my life. I I
[1:45:15] I can't even uh I better stop this right
[1:45:17] here, but I'll just finish by saying
[1:45:19] this. I don't even read the book that
[1:45:20] says, you know, uh computers or PCs for
[1:45:23] dummies.
[1:45:27] I've never bought them
[1:45:30] because I don't want to go below that
[1:45:32] category.
[1:45:37] But there's one thing I do know. I've
[1:45:39] learned a few things out of this book
[1:45:41] right here. I've learned a few things
[1:45:43] out of the message of the hour. We've
[1:45:45] learned some lessons, easy ones and
[1:45:47] difficult ones, but we've learned some
[1:45:49] lessons and we understand something
[1:45:51] about what God is doing. I might not
[1:45:53] know about Renaissance or
[1:45:55] industrialization or when the first
[1:45:57] steam engine in the early 1800s or late
[1:46:00] 17s was was invented and and came and
[1:46:04] spawned this great industrial
[1:46:06] revolution. But I know one thing during
[1:46:08] the countdown while things were
[1:46:10] advancing God was advancing his church.
[1:46:15] God was calling out his bride in the
[1:46:18] midst of it. And she utilized those
[1:46:20] gifts. She utilized those talents and
[1:46:23] utilized the men that were reared up in
[1:46:25] that time. And then they discovered, "Oh
[1:46:28] my God, I've learned this for your
[1:46:31] kingdom.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; You've given me this for your kingdom.
[1:46:35] I'm the bride of Jesus Christ, the elect
[1:46:37] of God, according to the promise." Can
[1:46:40] you say amen?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; And the Easter Seal and I'm closing in
[1:46:54] just a few moments.
[1:46:57] I'm only on page four of nine,
[1:47:00] but I I really wanted to emphasize
[1:47:06] this bright age.
[1:47:09] He says in the Easter Seal and that
[1:47:11] broke all the seals of gloom and
[1:47:14] scattered all the superstitions of other
[1:47:16] religions and so forth. When I talk
[1:47:20] about it in reality, there's a whole
[1:47:22] host of you sitting here today and are
[1:47:25] listening to me that were bound by the
[1:47:27] superstitions of religion and dominating
[1:47:31] you and holding you under their grip.
[1:47:34] And a word came that just broke the
[1:47:36] shackles of that in a moment of time and
[1:47:40] set you free and darkness turned to
[1:47:42] light.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; And he said and and where great men has
[1:47:52] raised up and said great marvelous
[1:47:54] things, but they're everyone in the
[1:47:57] grave, but our Christian religion is the
[1:47:59] only one who has an empty tomb. And that
[1:48:03] proves to me that he is God of the dead
[1:48:06] and God of the living. And he can raise
[1:48:09] up the dead back to life again. This
[1:48:11] quickening power, quickening spirit of
[1:48:14] his has proved through the years that
[1:48:17] he's the one who can quicken the dead
[1:48:20] back to life again. I'm thankful that
[1:48:22] the Wright brothers invented the the the
[1:48:25] airplane machine and we can take it and
[1:48:27] cross the seas and go to some other land
[1:48:30] and spread the gospel to them. I'm happy
[1:48:32] for that. But the bride, if you can
[1:48:34] catch it, in the bride age, we're
[1:48:36] utilizing
[1:48:38] what man has done, what he's achieved
[1:48:41] because God allowed him to achieve those
[1:48:44] things
[1:48:46] in the unveiling of God. He said,
[1:48:48] Apostle Peter made that great statement,
[1:48:51] Lord, to whom shall we go? For you, for
[1:48:54] we are satisfied and we know assuredly
[1:48:56] that you and you alone have the word of
[1:48:58] life at this hour. and we're satisfied.
[1:49:01] See, he says they couldn't explain it.
[1:49:03] You can't explain faith.
[1:49:06] It's something. You can't explain faith.
[1:49:08] By faith, I've received this word. You
[1:49:10] can't explain it.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; There was a force within you
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; that caused you to do it. You might be
[1:49:16] saying, and I don't want you to
[1:49:18] misunderstand me to think today that I'm
[1:49:20] speaking this message on my heart.
[1:49:22] That's really pressing on me, that
[1:49:24] you've got to feel some incredible
[1:49:26] thing. But the pressure that you do
[1:49:29] feel, the things that you do go through,
[1:49:33] I'm saying to you today is on behalf of
[1:49:35] the kingdom of God. If you're a body
[1:49:38] member of Jesus Christ, it won't always
[1:49:40] be easy. But you have to keep your eye
[1:49:43] focused on the fact that this is I'm a
[1:49:46] member of the bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:49:48] I am enduring these things. I'm going
[1:49:50] through these things for the glory of
[1:49:52] God.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of it.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't go quiet on me.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Said you can't explain faith. It's
[1:50:01] something that you believe and it's so
[1:50:03] solid that there's nothing else will
[1:50:05] take its place. Therefore, they knew
[1:50:08] that the word that was written for that
[1:50:11] age that they were living in the Messiah
[1:50:16] age that he fit that place exactly. And
[1:50:21] what could they do? He says, "What could
[1:50:23] they do to go back to their old cold
[1:50:26] formal churches that they could that
[1:50:28] they came out of?" said, "Where would we
[1:50:30] go? We are fully persuaded
[1:50:33] that you have the word of life." And
[1:50:36] they couldn't explain it, but they
[1:50:38] believed it.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit under the pressure of
[1:50:44] life.
[1:50:46] And this is what I want to come to. The
[1:50:49] Holy Spirit under the pressure of life.
[1:50:53] The pressure of life. How many you
[1:50:55] remember
[1:50:57] when a grass, just a seed, bursts under
[1:51:00] a concrete block, does it just give up?
[1:51:04] No. We know from the message, it goes
[1:51:06] out. He says, "Where's the greenest part
[1:51:07] of it?" Is outside of the outside of the
[1:51:10] block of the concrete. It grows out
[1:51:12] there because there's something in it
[1:51:14] that's being called by the sunlight. We
[1:51:17] have been called by the sunlight. And
[1:51:19] there isn't anything. There isn't enough
[1:51:21] dirt in a grave. There isn't enough
[1:51:23] sickness. There isn't anything that can
[1:51:26] hold that life back.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; It's the life of this age.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; That's my point. The life of the bride
[1:51:33] age.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're going through.
[1:51:35] I don't care what you've experienced.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Dismal things, uh, uh, physical things,
[1:51:42] success, good business, bad business,
[1:51:45] whatever more. homes, whatever you've
[1:51:47] whatever you've endured, it's for one
[1:51:50] purpose. God raised you up for the
[1:51:52] kingdom of God. I want you to take these
[1:51:54] words very very seriously. And then
[1:51:57] uh and and then I want to give you the
[1:51:59] scriptures, these scriptures, please.
[1:52:11] In Matthew 21:15, "And when the chief
[1:52:14] priests and scribes saw the wonderful
[1:52:16] things that he did, and the children
[1:52:19] crying in the temple and saying, "Hosana
[1:52:24] to the son of David," they were so
[1:52:27] displeased when they heard heard these
[1:52:31] children and the young people.
[1:52:35] There were crying in the streets and
[1:52:38] they were taking the palms off the
[1:52:42] trees, tearing them off. Now, if you'd
[1:52:44] been standing there, you might be
[1:52:46] saying, "What are they doing? What What
[1:52:48] is all this excitement? What are they
[1:52:50] caught up? We see it." And they're
[1:52:52] tearing off and waving it and crying,
[1:52:55] "Hosana in the highest." They didn't
[1:52:57] even know it, but they were speaking the
[1:52:58] scripture. Amen.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; And the key phrase is that it might be
[1:53:04] fulfilled
[1:53:06] which was spoken of by the prophet
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; that it might be fulfilled. And the
[1:53:11] scripture details a number of things
[1:53:14] that happened that's not necessarily
[1:53:16] uncommon. The Bible tells us, are you
[1:53:19] listening?
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Give me another five or 10 minutes and
[1:53:21] I'm I'm going to just close. The Bible
[1:53:23] tells us that
[1:53:26] that Joseph being warned in a dream.
[1:53:29] He took the young child and Mary's
[1:53:31] mother and they went to Egypt.
[1:53:38] He's not the only man that went to
[1:53:39] Egypt.
[1:53:42] He's not the only man that loaded his
[1:53:44] wife onto a donkey and had a baby son
[1:53:47] and went to Egypt.
[1:53:50] And then while he's in Egypt for a
[1:53:51] while, hears that Herod died and he goes
[1:53:54] back.
[1:53:56] He's not the only one that journeyed
[1:53:58] back. People move back and forth all
[1:54:00] over. But his movement was different
[1:54:03] because he was moving strictly because
[1:54:07] it it was written and spoken by the
[1:54:11] prophet.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[1:54:17] And then the scripture tells us,
[1:54:20] "And they went before and they
[1:54:23] followed."
[1:54:24] Some of them went before him and some of
[1:54:27] them followed him and they cried. This
[1:54:31] was a This was a This wasn't a quiet
[1:54:33] Sunday service. This was out on the
[1:54:36] streets and they didn't care much who
[1:54:39] was listening.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; They followed before and there was
[1:54:42] something surging through them.
[1:54:46] They had to do it.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; And we've heard it spoken maybe if even
[1:54:51] the next week, listen to me, the next
[1:54:53] week. They may also have been some of
[1:54:55] the same ones crying, "Crucify him!
[1:54:58] Crucify him!" But they were giving
[1:55:00] hosana praises and they were saying,
[1:55:02] "Crucified both because the scripture
[1:55:05] must be fulfilled."
[1:55:12] There's a lot of churches with people
[1:55:14] sitting just dressed like you are today.
[1:55:20] I started out with this. Now I'm
[1:55:23] bringing it home. What makes you
[1:55:25] different?
[1:55:26] There's a lot of preachers preaching
[1:55:28] better sermons than I'm preaching.
[1:55:31] Standing behind pulpit with the same
[1:55:33] Bible in front of them.
[1:55:36] What would make me any different from
[1:55:38] them?
[1:55:43] Unless somehow
[1:55:45] we can find that link.
[1:55:49] But that it might be spoken that it
[1:55:51] might be fulfilled. I am here that it
[1:55:54] might be fulfilled.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Codle. We are
[1:55:58] here because that it might be fulfilled.
[1:56:01] There had to be a calling out. There had
[1:56:03] to be a people There had to be a bride.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; There had to be because it was called
[1:56:08] out. It was spoken.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; And in the end time, it says in the
[1:56:15] closing of the book of Revelation, "And
[1:56:17] the spirit and the bride say come."
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; That it might be fulfilled. There has to
[1:56:27] be a bride
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; in this hour saying, "Come
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; that it might be fulfilled.
[1:56:35] All kinds of people can say come. But
[1:56:37] unless they are a direct result of the
[1:56:40] spoken word by a prophet, it doesn't
[1:56:42] count.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; A lot of people, better people, all
[1:56:52] kinds of people give to missions and
[1:56:54] give money in an offering plate. That's
[1:56:57] not the point. They're wonderful people,
[1:57:00] but unless the thing the event that's
[1:57:02] happening is a direct result of the word
[1:57:05] of God. So you can pin it back and
[1:57:07] anchor it and say this event is
[1:57:09] happening that it might be fulfilled
[1:57:13] which was spoken of by holy men of God
[1:57:17] or by prophets.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; So you can say today, why are you here?
[1:57:21] Why am I here? I'm here because God sent
[1:57:24] a prophet.
[1:57:25] I'm here because that prophet spoke. I'm
[1:57:28] here because he didn't just bring some
[1:57:29] doctrines. All kinds of people have done
[1:57:31] that. I'm here because God backed him
[1:57:33] up. I'm here because God proved it was
[1:57:35] the truth.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; I'm here because that has transformed my
[1:57:40] own life.
[1:57:51] today.
[1:57:55] You don't have to go very far
[1:58:00] until you'll find mobs
[1:58:03] gathered around celebrities.
[1:58:10] mobs of people wanting to get a glimpse,
[1:58:15] say, "What's driving them? What's moving
[1:58:17] them?"
[1:58:19] We hear of things today
[1:58:22] right in our own community, in our own
[1:58:24] town, our own city, dastardly,
[1:58:29] horrific events,
[1:58:32] slaughter and killing.
[1:58:39] I try to
[1:58:42] grasp when I read or see those things.
[1:58:45] This is so
[1:58:47] unreal.
[1:58:50] It's so inhuman.
[1:58:53] You wonder
[1:58:55] what moved that person.
[1:59:00] Was it greed? Was it hatred?
[1:59:03] And I think of the woman, the mother.
[1:59:06] who in the flames with her child in
[1:59:09] their burning or going to be burned and
[1:59:12] ran in. The young people did a
[1:59:14] presentation. I thought it was
[1:59:15] incredible and came out scarred for
[1:59:18] life. And the daughter, beautiful
[1:59:20] daughter, ashamed of her mother because
[1:59:23] of the scars that she bore to save her.
[1:59:28] What drove her to was some force, some
[1:59:31] power. And I've seen right here on the
[1:59:34] island where a family lost I think five
[1:59:37] children and and and the firemen and
[1:59:41] police had to hold back the mother
[1:59:44] because she she was going to run
[1:59:47] straight into that home that was an
[1:59:49] absolute inferno and I think they lost
[1:59:51] five children.
[1:59:54] incredible
[1:59:56] life is gone
[1:59:58] and there's something in her of
[2:00:00] motherhood going to drive her into it.
[2:00:04] If just a human love can do that, what
[2:00:08] should the spirit of God be doing in us
[2:00:10] as believers?
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; And I that's a question I'd like to send
[2:00:14] you from this place this morning. God,
[2:00:18] press through me, move through me with
[2:00:21] the full force of the Holy Spirit for
[2:00:25] the hour, for the hours upon us and for
[2:00:27] the word that you have for this day that
[2:00:30] we might live it, that we might speak
[2:00:31] it, that we might give, that we might
[2:00:33] commit ourselves, whatever you have in
[2:00:35] store for us. I want to be everything
[2:00:37] for the bright age.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:53] Brother Brandham started a revolution.
[2:00:58] You might say, "Well, I haven't seen
[2:01:00] it." I can tell you there are a lot of
[2:01:03] spiritual leaders and religious leaders
[2:01:06] that realize they kind of have their
[2:01:08] hands over their eyes hoping it'll go
[2:01:10] away and it doesn't go away. And every
[2:01:12] time they pull their hands back, they
[2:01:14] see that it's spreading. It's spreading.
[2:01:16] It's spreading. A lot of things spread.
[2:01:18] Islam is spreading. They don't have a
[2:01:21] vindicated their prophet.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Theirs is still in the grave with a
[2:01:25] white horse standing outside as I
[2:01:27] understand it. I don't know. I've not
[2:01:28] been there. That's what that's what
[2:01:30] their hope is. We got an empty tomb. We
[2:01:33] don't have any horse there waiting for
[2:01:35] him to rise. We've got a resurrection
[2:01:37] coming. We've already Listen, bride,
[2:01:40] bride age. You in the bride age?
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; How many in the bride age?
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; That same prophet said, "You're in the
[2:01:48] bright age." Said this, "You have
[2:01:50] received you have received the sign of
[2:01:54] the resurrection."
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; So I I I I read a book and this happened
[2:02:00] when the prophet said that I want you to
[2:02:02] be able to go out from this place today
[2:02:04] saying I have received the sign
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; of the resurrection.
[2:02:10] Well, don't take it too laxidasical
[2:02:14] because you don't want to be one of
[2:02:16] those that's after said, "Wasn't Elijah
[2:02:19] supposed to come?" Hey, he also said
[2:02:22] that, you know what that tells me?
[2:02:24] There's going to be people.
[2:02:27] There's going to be people who know the
[2:02:29] scripture. There's going to be people
[2:02:32] who are actually going to say because he
[2:02:33] said so. There will be people that will
[2:02:37] say, "Wasn't Elijah supposed to come?"
[2:02:41] God in heaven, hear me now. I pray that
[2:02:45] there won't be a single person who's
[2:02:48] sitting under the sound of my voice that
[2:02:50] will have to have those words going out
[2:02:52] of their mouth. Wasn't Elijah supposed
[2:02:54] to come? And he said, "He's already come
[2:02:58] and you didn't know it."
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; And he says, "The rapture will be the
[2:03:03] same way.
[2:03:05] That's what he said
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; just going to happen and he's like
[2:03:09] wasn't there supposed to be a rapture
[2:03:11] there will be person might think and try
[2:03:14] to figure everything out and say well
[2:03:16] how's it going to be surely all the
[2:03:18] people going to be gone I'll know the
[2:03:19] rapture is taking place or something
[2:03:21] don't you count on those things you
[2:03:23] can't even figure technology out the age
[2:03:25] of technology so don't try to figure out
[2:03:27] the bride age
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; we won't figure that one out but we want
[2:03:31] to be in it don't we
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; want to be a part of
[2:03:34] want to be a part of it. God bless you
[2:03:36] as you stand with me if you would
[2:03:38] please.

[2:12:15] Brazil have all expressed their their
[2:12:18] love to you and their appreciation for
[2:12:20] the glorious supernatural hospitality
[2:12:23] that you extended to them while they
[2:12:26] were here. It was so much more than they
[2:12:29] had ever expected or ever experienced.
[2:12:31] and they said there was something that
[2:12:33] will stay with them for the rest of
[2:12:34] their life. So, God bless you. Let's
[2:12:36] pray.
[2:12:42] Father, we are so thankful for
[2:12:46] the kingdom of God that
[2:12:50] is within us, Lord, that allows us to
[2:12:52] see into a supernatural realm. And Lord,
[2:12:56] as pastor has said, we are a different
[2:12:59] people.
[2:13:01] We are people who have been called by an
[2:13:03] unconditional
[2:13:05] supernatural covenant. Have been given a
[2:13:08] divine nature. Lord,
[2:13:11] you have moved strangely in each one of
[2:13:14] our lives. Father, you have moved us
[2:13:17] geographically. You have moved us
[2:13:20] economically.
[2:13:21] You have moved us. You have delivered
[2:13:23] us. You have lifted us up into the
[2:13:26] realms and spheres of God where we walk
[2:13:29] with with you and heavenly places. Lord,
[2:13:32] you've introduced us to a a civilization
[2:13:35] of supernatural beings, Lord, to
[2:13:37] understand the ministry of angels, to
[2:13:40] understand our enemy, Lord, and to how
[2:13:43] to overcome him. Father, you've taught
[2:13:46] us, Lord, that there is a love that we
[2:13:48] must enter into that is so far above
[2:13:51] anything that any man, any human being
[2:13:55] has ever heard or ever understood
[2:13:57] before, Father. And it's only by your
[2:14:00] grace. It's only by your empowerment,
[2:14:02] Father, the force that you have placed
[2:14:05] inside of us that continues to drive us
[2:14:08] and move us and lead us and guide us and
[2:14:11] direct us, Lord, to that perfect path
[2:14:14] that you have ordained for each one of
[2:14:16] us. Father, we thank you for the word.
[2:14:18] We thank you for the instruction and the
[2:14:21] inspiration that is available to us 7
[2:14:24] days a week, 24 hours a day. Lord, we
[2:14:28] thank you for,00 messages. Lord that
[2:14:31] came from the throne room of God that
[2:14:33] cover every area, every aspect of our
[2:14:36] life, Father, that give us the answer,
[2:14:38] Lord. And Lord, to know that you are
[2:14:41] there. You are there to to hear and you
[2:14:43] are there to to give us your perfect
[2:14:46] will for any situation, Lord. I thank
[2:14:49] you for the body of Christ. I thank you
[2:14:52] for the the bride all around the world,
[2:14:54] Father, and for the the ones that are
[2:14:56] laboring and ministering, Lord, in the
[2:14:58] word. ministering as as deacons and
[2:15:01] trustees, Lord. Those are in the prayer
[2:15:04] closets. Those are working in in
[2:15:06] missions, Lord. Those that are working
[2:15:08] in so many areas, Lord, that that that
[2:15:10] we don't even sometimes think about or
[2:15:13] hear about, Lord. But we know that you
[2:15:15] know everything that is done, every
[2:15:17] finger that is raised for the kingdom of
[2:15:19] God, Lord, you're aware of it, Lord. And
[2:15:22] we're so thankful to be a part of this
[2:15:26] restored age, Lord. No other age has
[2:15:29] ever had the opportunity and the
[2:15:31] privileges to know you in the power of
[2:15:34] your resurrection the way we do. And we
[2:15:37] thank you for it. Lord, bless your
[2:15:39] people now. Send them away from here.
[2:15:42] Lord, changed and transformed and
[2:15:45] renewed in their vision and their
[2:15:47] commitment to serve you with all their
[2:15:49] heart. We ask all these blessings in
[2:15:52] your precious and holy name of our Lord
[2:15:54] Jesus Christ. Amen.
