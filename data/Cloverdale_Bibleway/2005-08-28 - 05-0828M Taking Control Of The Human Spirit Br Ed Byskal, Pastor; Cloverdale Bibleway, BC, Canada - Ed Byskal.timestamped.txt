[10:58] [Music]
[11:55] We want to welcome. Is this thing on?
[11:56] No, I must have turned it off. There we
[11:59] go. Is that better?
[12:03] God bless you.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; When you're glad to be here.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Looks like most of you. I was just
[12:12] thinking this morning reading uh in the
[12:14] Psalms
[12:16] and uh
[12:19] David said in
[12:22] Psalm chapter 4,
[12:26] there be many that say, "Who will show
[12:28] us any good? Lord, lift up the light of
[12:30] thine countenance. Thou hast put
[12:32] gladness in my heart more than in the
[12:35] time that their corn and their wine
[12:37] increased." You know, people win the
[12:40] lottery, right? Are they glad? Oh, yeah.
[12:44] But David said, "Here, thou hast put
[12:47] gladness in my heart more than when
[12:50] their goods are increased." Amen.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; So, you should be happier this morning
[12:56] than somebody who has won the lottery,
[12:58] you know, who just put a lot of money in
[13:00] the bank. Say, he said, David said, "And
[13:03] if you don't have it, it's there for
[13:06] you." How many you've got that joy this
[13:08] morning?
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's uh stand together. We can
[13:11] sing. He has made me glad. He has made
[13:13] me glad.
[13:15] I will enter
[13:19] his gates with thanksgiving in my heart.
[13:24] I will enter his gates with thanksgiving
[13:28] in my heart. I will enter his court with
[13:33] praise.
[13:35] I will say this is the day that the Lord
[13:40] have made. I will rejoice. He has made
[13:44] me glad.
[13:48] He has made me glad. Oh, he has made me
[13:51] glad. I will rejoice. He has made me
[13:56] glad.
[13:59] He has made me glad.
[14:01] He has made me glad. I will rejoice. He
[14:06] has made me. I will enter. And I will
[14:10] enter his gate with thanksgiving in my
[14:14] heart. I will enter his foot with
[14:18] praise.
[14:20] And I will say the day that the Lord has
[14:25] made I will come. He has made me glad.
[14:32] He has made me glad.
[14:35] He has made me glad. Hallelujah.
[14:39] He has made me glad. Oh, I'm glad. He
[14:44] has made me glad.
[14:46] He has made me glad. I feel he made me
[14:51] glad. He has made me. He has made me
[14:55] glad.
[14:57] He made me glad
[15:00] because he has made me glad.
[15:05] He has made me glad.
[15:08] He has made me glad.
[15:12] He made Thank you, Lord. I know that he
[15:17] has made me glad.
[15:19] He have made me glad.
[15:23] He has made me glad.
[15:26] Oh yes, he has been glad.
[15:30] He made me glad. Hallelujah.
[15:34] [Music]
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a song I was thinking
[15:43] about this morning after uh Zephaniah
[15:46] spoke Friday night
[15:49] and we've been talking about standing
[15:51] up. Amen. Faith is a victory. Here's
[15:53] number 2468.
[15:56] Encamped along the hills of light, ye
[15:59] Christian soldiers rise and press the
[16:01] battle. Air the night shall veil the
[16:03] glowing skies. Amen. Faith is the
[16:07] victory. Amen. You don't need a lot.
[16:10] Amen. And it doesn't come from anything
[16:13] that you have. Amen. He'll give you all
[16:15] the faith you need. Amen. Let's sing it
[16:17] together.
[16:19] Encamped along the hills of light. Ye
[16:23] Christian soldiers rise and press the
[16:27] battle air. The night shall veil the
[16:30] glowing skies
[16:32] against the foe in veils below. Let all
[16:36] our strength behold. Faith is the
[16:39] victory we know that overcomes the
[16:43] world.
[16:45] Faith is the victory.
[16:48] Faith is the victory.
[16:51] Oh, glorious victory that overcomes the
[16:56] world. His banner over us, his love, our
[17:00] sword, the word of God. We tread the
[17:04] road of saints above with shouts of try
[17:08] and draw. By faith they like the world
[17:11] with breath swept on our every field.
[17:15] The faith by which they conquer death is
[17:18] still our shining shield. Oh, faith is
[17:23] the victory. Faith is the victory.
[17:27] Oh, glorious victory that overcomes the
[17:32] world. On every handful of bow we find,
[17:36] drawn up in dread.
[17:39] Let ts of peace be left behind and
[17:42] onward to the brave. Salvation helmet on
[17:47] each head with truth pred.
[17:51] The earth shall tremble our tread and
[17:54] echo with the shout. Oh faith is a
[17:58] victory. Faith is the victory.
[18:03] Oh glorious victory that overcomes the
[18:07] world. To him that overcomes the full
[18:11] white rain that shall be
[18:14] before the angels he shall know his name
[18:18] confess in them. Then onward from the
[18:22] hill of life with love of flame will
[18:26] vanquish all the hopes of night in Jesus
[18:30] name.
[18:32] Faith is the victory. Faith is the
[18:36] victory.
[18:38] Oh, glorious victory that overcomes.

[20:44] fire
[20:46] of me.
[20:49] While others fight to win the prize and
[20:55] sing through bloody cheese.
[20:59] I've got my mind up. I got my heart made
[21:04] right and I'm going with Jesus all the
[21:08] way.

[26:45] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[26:48] Thank you, Lord. Praise God.
[26:52] And I'm going to ask our brother John
[26:54] Andy's. Brother John, if you come for
[26:56] the service in a word of prayer. Got a
[26:59] number of requests here this morning and
[27:02] uh
[27:06] a couple of testimonies.
[27:09] Sister Lana says, "I had chronic fatigue
[27:11] for months and it was getting worse, but
[27:13] I went up to get prayed for and I am
[27:15] healed."
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. Sister Aaron Macaulay, I
[27:21] want to thank the Lord for returning my
[27:23] car that was stolen. There were no
[27:25] expenses and very little damage.
[27:27] Thankful.
[27:29] Brother Jonathan Nash wants us to pray
[27:31] for a co-orker and co-orker's wife need
[27:35] a touch of healing. Uh he has a chance
[27:38] to witness to both of them. Would like
[27:39] the Lord to use this for his glory.
[27:42] Father Tom Fre is requesting prayer for
[27:44] Nicole and Jonathan Frey who are at home
[27:47] not well. It's a request uh that we pray
[27:50] for a young man that wants to be
[27:52] delivered from drugs that he may come to
[27:54] know his deliverer. We want to remember
[27:56] in prayer this morning our brother Mike
[27:57] Cosino. He uh went in for surgery for a
[28:00] quadruple bypass. I understand he's
[28:03] doing uh much better and uh but he's
[28:06] still in the hospital. We just want to
[28:08] pray that the Lord would just completely
[28:10] touch him. Amen.
[28:12] Um, Sister Bev Charman is asking that we
[28:16] pray for um, Emily Drake as she's sick
[28:19] at home this morning. Um,
[28:23] Sister Sue Giri says, "Our daughter's
[28:25] best friend was killed in a car
[28:26] accident, leaving four young children.
[28:28] We pray uh, that the father would draw
[28:31] close to the Lord for strength." And
[28:33] sister Roxanne is requesting that we
[28:35] remember her dad uh brother Emile Bessie
[28:38] uh in prayer. His PSA levels have risen
[28:42] again and the doctor said there's
[28:44] nothing they can do. Uh the chemo is not
[28:46] working so they've quit all treatments.
[28:49] Um he has a bone scam on the 14th of
[28:51] September. So I want to remember him
[28:54] this morning. Amen. And if you've got a
[28:56] need this morning, if you're listening
[28:58] in over the internet on the phones and
[29:00] you've got a need, you need a touch from
[29:02] the Lord or whatever that need would be,
[29:04] you just lift before him as we go to
[29:05] prayer. Brother John, if you'd come,
[29:09] [Music]
[29:12] let's just accumulate all of our faith
[29:14] together and touch the Lord this
[29:16] morning.
[29:18] Father, we want to lift up our hands,
[29:20] Lord, in your presence. We want to lift
[29:23] up our hearts and acknowledge
[29:25] your workings among us in our lives. Our
[29:28] lives are but a vapor. All of our lives
[29:30] in this building, the lives out on the
[29:33] internet, those on the phone hookup that
[29:35] are joining in faith right now, they're
[29:38] miracles. Lord, you've done such great
[29:41] things for us. And we this morning want
[29:43] to say how great is our God. There is no
[29:46] God like you. There is no one like you.
[29:50] We approach you this morning with hearts
[29:52] of faith. Believing that all things are
[29:54] possible. Believing that your spirit is
[29:56] moving inside of your body, inside of
[29:59] your people. There's healing in the
[30:01] body. There's deliverance in the body.
[30:03] The Holy Spirit's working in your body.
[30:07] Father, how great thou art.
[30:10] You've been so wonderful to us, Jesus.
[30:14] Our mind is just going through the
[30:16] times. How you've dealt with us
[30:17] sovereignly. the supernatural hand, even
[30:20] what we feel now in this building, your
[30:23] spirit upon us. We just want to
[30:25] surrender right now and yield every
[30:27] thought, every part of our lives. Our
[30:30] souls are before you. Our spirits are
[30:32] before you. Our bodies are before you.
[30:35] We need you this morning, Jesus. Would
[30:38] you come by this way, Lord? We invite
[30:40] your spirit. We invite your presence. We
[30:43] invite your healing touch. We invite
[30:45] your hand to be able to move mountains
[30:48] that we cannot move. We Lord invite you
[30:51] into situations that seem impossible.
[30:54] But nothing is impossible for you. These
[30:57] temples, these houses are for your
[30:59] dwelling place and where Satan has
[31:01] invaded, where affliction has come in,
[31:04] where disease has come in, where sin has
[31:07] come in. We resist the enemy. We resist
[31:10] Satan and his powers of darkness. The
[31:13] evil hand of the crab fingers that would
[31:16] try to put cancer upon the believers,
[31:19] try to come into families and divide
[31:21] them. Anything that would take away
[31:24] oneness in the family is not of you. So
[31:27] we stand against it this morning. We
[31:29] stand against any spirit in the assembly
[31:31] this morning that would be opposite or
[31:34] different from your presence. having
[31:36] full impact, having full sway, doing
[31:39] miracles, even yet while we hear the
[31:42] word. Father, just reading this morning
[31:44] a testimony. Someone that didn't have
[31:46] hands laid on them, somebody that didn't
[31:48] even come up in a prayer line, but even
[31:50] yet while they heard the word, you did a
[31:53] miracle in their lives. Father, you can
[31:55] fill us with your Holy Spirit. Even
[31:57] standing here in your presence, we empty
[32:00] out ourselves. We die to ourselves. our
[32:04] thoughts. Let them leave us that the
[32:06] thoughts of Jesus Christ would come
[32:09] freely in. Lord, we're laying hands on
[32:11] these requests. We're holding them in
[32:13] our hands. They were written out by
[32:15] believers. Lives that believe that you
[32:17] can move on the scene. Unspoken requests
[32:20] are in the hearts of people. There's
[32:22] believers right in this service that are
[32:24] afflicted. Lives that are burdened.
[32:27] Jesus, our lives are before you. We are
[32:30] your victory. We're inviting you to come
[32:32] on the scene in these situations, in
[32:35] these issues, in our lives, and have the
[32:38] victory over Satan. Have the victory
[32:41] over the sickness. Have the victory over
[32:44] the darkness.
[32:46] Every seed, Lord, is coming to its
[32:48] place. The last ones are coming in.
[32:51] We're burdened, Lord, for the moving of
[32:53] your spirit. Soften lives. Bring them
[32:56] into the inner veil. This morning's
[32:59] service is an opportunity for all of us
[33:01] to take another step into your divine
[33:04] presence where all things are possible.
[33:07] Give us faith, Lord, to speak within our
[33:09] hearts. Give every life here rapturing
[33:11] faith
[33:13] to speak and all things are possible.
[33:16] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, these requests
[33:18] are many. And Lord, I pray as they were
[33:21] read out, Lord, and those that
[33:24] we're just asking you to come on the
[33:26] scene in these men and these women, in
[33:28] these families, in these lives.
[33:32] Be with our brother Tony this morning in
[33:33] India, with our brother DDA in New York,
[33:36] Lord. Be with the body of Jesus Christ
[33:38] around the world. We're waiting and
[33:41] we're longing for the hour when services
[33:43] like this will just continue on and on
[33:46] and on. meetings that we've been having
[33:48] will be just our our ordinary
[33:50] atmosphere. We won't have to go back
[33:52] into a life of of working and living out
[33:56] in sin. We're going to a land where
[33:58] there is no sin, where there is no
[34:00] heartache. There won't be any prayer
[34:02] requests there. There won't be any lost
[34:04] loved ones there. They'll be saved,
[34:07] perfect bodies. But while we're here, we
[34:10] still give you glory. While we're in
[34:12] this pest house, there's a theophony
[34:14] that's moving. There's a faith realm
[34:17] that we're still believing, Father, that
[34:19] you're among us. Nothing can stand
[34:23] before the prayers of your believers. Be
[34:26] with brother Peter Briner this morning.
[34:28] Father, I pray the cancer within his
[34:30] body would be afraid of the very
[34:33] presence of your own healing touch. that
[34:36] the molecules and the atoms and the
[34:38] cells would come back and there ought to
[34:40] be condition that our brother Peter
[34:42] would give a testimony behind this
[34:44] pulpit that he has totally delivered
[34:48] in the name of Jesus Christ. We claim
[34:51] his healing as a body of believers. One
[34:54] that has prayed for us. One that has
[34:55] stood in the gap for us. We pray for him
[34:58] and may the enemy lose his grip upon
[35:02] this seed of God's life and every life
[35:04] that's here. May tonight this morning's
[35:06] service be a moment we can enter in
[35:08] further and deeper into your presence in
[35:11] the name of Jesus Christ.
[35:14] Let us be aware, Father, of your
[35:16] presence. Let us move into that
[35:18] atmosphere. I'm just asking for this
[35:21] meeting this morning that you would just
[35:22] move in a realm that Lord that is
[35:24] further than what we can even ask for or
[35:27] think or even anticipate. men and women
[35:29] are joining our hearts together for the
[35:31] supernatural element to be turned on
[35:34] even now within our lives. Bless the
[35:36] minister. Let the glory of God so be
[35:40] transmitting into our souls that he
[35:42] would not even be able to minister.
[35:44] Glory cloud come down among us. Change
[35:48] lives and move us into that presence in

[45:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:59] going to have you sit back down again
[46:02] for a few moments
[46:05] before we read the word. We're just so
[46:09] thrilled at
[46:11] uh the reports and the things that are
[46:14] taking place. Our brother Mike Cosalino,
[46:17] he had operation yesterday, I believe it
[46:21] was. And maybe brother Tom you would
[46:23] just tell him you brother Tom visited
[46:26] him and
[46:29] brother Mike went in for an operation.
[46:31] He went in uh first of all because of
[46:34] his blood pressure was up. They cleared
[46:36] two of the veins in his neck and felt
[46:38] that they uh were ready to go in. They
[46:41] were going to give him a double heart
[46:42] bypass but they deemed it necessary to
[46:44] give him a quadruple heart bypass. And
[46:48] um they went in on and operated. It was
[46:51] a total success. Yesterday he had a
[46:54] tough day. This morning I walked in
[46:55] early. He's sitting up in the chair.
[46:57] Sister Ameilia, he's just happy. He
[46:59] says, "When I get out of here," he says,
[47:01] "We're going to turn the world upside
[47:02] down." Amen. All is well. He's doing it.
[47:07] The Lord,
[47:10] Brother Jim Hayes, I gave your testimony
[47:12] the other night uh in Friday night's
[47:16] service. I didn't know if you were going
[47:17] to be back, but I want I I would like to
[47:20] have you uh come up and uh just briefly
[47:23] tell us what what happened and uh and
[47:26] that what God did for you. Uh if you do
[47:29] that, uh I said on Friday night, and I
[47:32] want to reinforce this morning, the
[47:35] prophet said that in his presence, the
[47:37] supernatural is happening. It's not
[47:40] something that you have to manufacture.
[47:42] It's not something that you can uh
[47:45] invent. It's just something that God
[47:46] does. And uh and and God is a giver of
[47:50] life. And we don't know, you know, God
[47:53] sometimes uses uh doctors and hospitals
[47:56] and all the rest of it. We're not
[47:57] opposed to that, but we are
[48:00] I'm much more in favor
[48:03] &gt;&gt; and we're believers, so we want to
[48:05] believe. You know, God's word is
[48:07] preached and the people believe it.
[48:09] Prayer is made and the people believe
[48:10] it. So, just come by brother Jim and see
[48:13] what we want to give God the glory. I'm
[48:16] I'm very very very insistent that we
[48:20] give God the glory. When we ask for
[48:22] something, then he does it. We want to
[48:23] be sure and give him the glory. Brother
[48:25] Jim, God bless you. Amen.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, Brother Brown liked to brag on
[48:30] uh on Jesus Christ.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; But he said that he he didn't want to
[48:34] brag on any more that he did or any less
[48:37] that he did. Uh, I had this thing on my
[48:39] nose for a couple years. It had been
[48:41] misdiagnosed, been frozen a couple
[48:44] times, and then started to alter the
[48:47] tissue of the nose. I went into a
[48:48] specialist that did a biopsy. He said,
[48:50] "You got cancer. I want you to deal with
[48:51] it by August. You have three choices.
[48:53] You can do 15 treatments of radiation.
[48:57] You know, it's five days on, two days
[48:58] off." And I'm thinking, well, I wasn't
[49:01] too motivated about that. I was trying
[49:03] to figure it in how I could fit it into
[49:05] my schedule and fishing and everything,
[49:08] you know,
[49:09] and then the other choice was that they
[49:11] just going to just take a big chunk out
[49:13] of your nose and rebuild it. And I
[49:16] wasn't too excited about that. And then
[49:18] there was this one person in Watt Watcom
[49:20] County that did a particular procedure
[49:22] called Moe's surgery and uh named after
[49:26] the person who developed it and they
[49:28] they go in there just slice real thin
[49:30] and then you sit in a chair and they go
[49:31] out and look at it under the scope come
[49:34] back take another slice and they do that
[49:36] until they get it all that the purpose
[49:38] being to you know kind of mitigate the
[49:40] loss of tissue and so forth. But
[49:43] um so I dragged my feet of course and
[49:47] then had it scheduled towards the end of
[49:49] August here on this past Thursday and
[49:52] then I realized there was no service on
[49:53] Wednesday. So I I uh bolted up here to
[49:57] uh have some prayer because I was you
[49:59] know I was feeling a little timid about
[50:01] it because or insignificant in light of
[50:03] uh some of the other issues with and
[50:06] needs with some of the other people in
[50:07] the assembly. But uh nevertheless, I uh
[50:10] told brother Tom that I you know, I just
[50:13] assume avoid the uh you know the skin
[50:16] patches and the the plugs and the
[50:18] rebuilding and the cosmetic surgery and
[50:20] all that stuff. And uh so he said,
[50:23] "Sure, let's go into the office." And
[50:24] there was brother Ed and brother DJ and
[50:26] brother John. And uh we went into the uh
[50:30] office and when we started to pray and
[50:31] in my mind I had had uh the thought that
[50:34] you know Lord I just don't want it to be
[50:36] very deep because they were talking
[50:37] about the size of a quarter on one side
[50:40] and you know that was who knows how deep
[50:42] it was going to be and it was basically
[50:44] half the nose. So in my mind I'm
[50:46] thinking I I Lord I just you know don't
[50:48] let it be very deep. And his brother Ed
[50:50] started to pray. Um
[50:53] he said Lord let that cancer go back to
[50:56] where it come and he said let him not
[50:59] find anything.
[51:00] And so I found myself saying amen. you
[51:04] know, so as I went into the office, I as
[51:07] I was driving to the office, I was, you
[51:09] know, quite impressed by the the prayer
[51:11] and continued to think about it and
[51:15] um you know, I just I found myself
[51:17] wanting to say something something, you
[51:20] know, when I went in there and something
[51:22] profound, you know, and which is not
[51:24] usually my mode of operation or my style
[51:27] or my comfort level, whatever, but maybe
[51:29] perhaps uh you know, our style and our
[51:31] comfort level is a hindrance to us,
[51:33] &gt;&gt; you So, so I'm sitting in the chair, the
[51:36] surgery chair, and in walks the doctor
[51:38] and his entourage, you know, the
[51:39] physician's assistant, the the nurse,
[51:42] and u just immediately I said real
[51:45] directly, I said, "Uh, brother Dor, uh,"
[51:48] I says, "Dr. Dohy," he says, "Um, do you
[51:51] feel good this morning?" He looks at me,
[51:53] he says, "Yeah, I feel good." I says,
[51:55] "Good. I feel good, too. I I just had a
[51:57] meeting yesterday with four men, and I
[52:00] said this real directly, you know, and I
[52:01] just kind of I just want to say
[52:03] something. I want to throw myself out
[52:04] there where the prayer was at. You know
[52:05] what I mean? And um I said, "I just had
[52:08] a meeting with four men yesterday, four
[52:10] mighty men of valor, servants of
[52:12] Christ."
[52:14] And and then when my pastor prayed, he
[52:16] prayed that that cancer would go back to
[52:18] where it come from and you wouldn't find
[52:20] anything,
[52:21] you know.
[52:24] So that went over like a lead brick.
[52:27] He just kind of looked at me. Okay. you
[52:29] know. So, I lean back and he does his
[52:31] thing and uh he says, "Okay, relax. I'll
[52:34] be back in 30 minutes." So, I'm sitting
[52:37] there leaning back and I'm thinking,
[52:38] "Wow, Lord, I really impressed him with
[52:39] that, didn't I?" And um he comes back in
[52:43] 5 minutes. He says, "Well, um we didn't
[52:46] see anything on a perimeter or or any on
[52:49] that slice, so obviously this is the
[52:51] type that isn't in the core, so we're
[52:53] going to go after the core now." console
[52:54] and they come they make their second
[52:55] slice and says see you in 30 to 40
[52:58] minutes so just relax okay well he comes
[53:01] back in 10 minutes he says well and this
[53:05] just really impressed me he says the
[53:06] power of prayer is something isn't it
[53:07] this is what the doctor said to me
[53:09] &gt;&gt; he says we didn't find anything
[53:19] &gt;&gt; so there you go now you know brother Ed
[53:22] said we don't want a camp experience. We
[53:24] want a Holy Ghost experience. We want to
[53:26] continue on that and see God fulfilling
[53:28] his purpose in our life. And that's
[53:30] moving and expressing his victory in us.
[53:32] And I I just, you know, praise God. And
[53:36] uh thank you very much.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; I'd say it was more Brother Jim's
[53:47] confession to the doctor than even was
[53:49] our prayer. That was his confession. and
[53:52] he moved on his confession and the hol
[53:54] and the Holy Spirit then the Lord Jesus
[53:57] had to move as the high priest on that
[54:00] confession.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't God wonderful?
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Jason,
[54:07] it's your turn.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Where God is,
[54:15] &gt;&gt; supernatural is happening.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; How long you been married, brother
[54:18] Jason?
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Eight years.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Eight years. Okay.
[54:24] I don't get nervous. I'm nervous.
[54:27] Amen. Isn't he wonderful?
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Well, if I'm extra happy, you all know
[54:32] why. If you don't, Bible ways not doing
[54:35] good with this rumor.
[54:37] Well, wife and I are going to be
[54:38] parents. We want to thank the Lord for
[54:40] that.
[54:45] Amen.
[54:49] As uh brother Ed said, how long's been
[54:52] we've been married? We've been married
[54:53] for eight years. And and uh the Lord
[54:56] just did something really special for
[54:57] Emmy and I about two and a half years
[55:00] ago. Uh we finally figured out something
[55:03] was wrong and we went uh talked to
[55:06] Brother Ed and Brother Ed then says,
[55:08] "Well, give me a couple of days and I'll
[55:11] get back to you." and and then he uh he
[55:13] called us and he says well actually
[55:15] sister Ruth called us and said brother
[55:17] Ed would like to have he's right now
[55:19] he'd like to have prayer with you. So,
[55:21] uh, he had prayer with he, uh, actually
[55:24] called us in the back study. Then he
[55:25] says, "Jace, if you get brother Tom also
[55:27] and, uh, because they had the same same
[55:29] problems, my wife and I." And brother
[55:31] Tom and, uh, Brother Red, my wife and I
[55:34] went to back study and we had prayer.
[55:37] And that was 2 and a half years ago.
[55:38] That was actually on November 10th, uh,
[55:41] 2002.
[55:43] And if you have your Bibles, uh, let's
[55:45] turn to Mark 11.
[55:48] And we'll start with, uh, verse 23. And
[55:51] this was, uh, a scripture brother,
[55:53] brother brother Ed gave us. Actually,
[55:54] it's the 24th scripture that 24th verse
[55:57] that brother Ed gave us. But I'm going
[55:59] to go back to number 23.
[56:02] It says,"For verily I say unto you, that
[56:05] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[56:08] Be thou removed, and be thou cast into
[56:10] the sea, and shall not doubt in his
[56:12] heart, but shall believe that those
[56:15] things which he saith shall come to
[56:17] pass, he shall have whatever he saith."
[56:20] And now, this is the 24th verse that
[56:21] Brother Ed gave us. Therefore, I say
[56:24] unto you, what what things soever you
[56:27] desire when you pray, believe that ye
[56:30] receiveth them. And I underlined this.
[56:32] And ye shall have them.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Well, that was two and a half years ago.
[56:37] And uh this was actually back when
[56:40] brother Perry Green was here. And he
[56:41] brought remember those prayer cloths?
[56:43] Well, Brother Red uh cut one of those
[56:45] off and gave that to my wife. And she
[56:47] carried that with her for that amount of
[56:50] time, believing uh every day that the
[56:53] Lord was going to give her a child. And
[56:56] uh I know a lot of people are saying,
[56:57] "Well, why are you telling everybody
[56:58] it's only been six weeks?" Well, when
[57:00] God gives America, I don't care if it's
[57:01] six weeks or we have to wait for three
[57:03] months. I'm just going to tell her.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um she was carrying that, you
[57:08] know, always believing and me, you know,
[57:10] I don't know, being a doubter, you know,
[57:13] well, what what if what if God, you
[57:15] know, what if we don't get a child?
[57:16] Maybe we're supposed to be with a Tony.
[57:19] And Sister Rebecca, maybe God has got
[57:21] something more for us because I know
[57:22] every desire of a of a wife is is to to
[57:25] have a have a children. And she says,
[57:26] "No, I'm not accepting that." And uh
[57:29] bless her little heart. And and so back,
[57:33] let's jump up now to where we are now.
[57:35] And brother Tom, how many remember this
[57:37] service? Brother Tom said, "Remember
[57:39] your confess. Have a confession. I want
[57:41] you to stand up and confess it." Well,
[57:43] you know, my wife always bugs me because
[57:45] I don't always tell her everything, but
[57:47] you know, I think this is a good time.
[57:48] So, honey, if you don't mind, I'm going
[57:49] to tell everybody and tell you at the
[57:50] same time. Uh she usually says, "That's
[57:53] how I find out everything about you, so
[57:55] I might as well keep the ball rolling."
[57:56] Well, brother when brother Tom said
[57:58] that, you know, I stood up and said, "I
[58:00] want a deliverance because there's
[58:01] something that I had been fighting for
[58:02] for 18 years." And and then my wife, she
[58:06] stands up and says, "I want a baby. I'm
[58:09] claiming that baby." And then when we
[58:11] had uh on at camp on uh the Saturday
[58:15] when when our brother Spencer
[58:16] called everybody up, you know, I just
[58:19] had most supernatural experience that I
[58:21] I've I haven't had in a long time. And
[58:24] uh I knew I was free and and for the my
[58:28] wife, she didn't know this, but she was
[58:30] expecting already. And uh and so for me,
[58:33] I guess everything's got to line up. You
[58:35] know, you know, the husband's got to be
[58:36] right in his place and so on and so
[58:38] forth. And that Saturday, uh for me, it
[58:41] was it was a supernatural time. And I
[58:43] knew that I had reached where I wanted
[58:44] to be. And uh then Sunday, you know,
[58:48] Brother Ron Spencer preached, you know,
[58:50] talking about the wife and how she goes
[58:52] through and every my wife says she was
[58:53] laughing like crazy, you know, she's
[58:54] getting heartburn and the whole nine
[58:56] yards and uh and she didn't know she was
[58:58] expecting. And so Monday we uh she she
[59:02] had been experiencing these different
[59:04] things and and so you know she was
[59:07] talking to her sister in Indiana and her
[59:09] sister says, "Well, those are the exact
[59:10] same symptoms I've had. you know, when I
[59:12] was expecting, you know, feeling sick at
[59:15] weird times of the day. And uh, of
[59:18] course, I didn't clue in, but uh, I
[59:20] said, "Okay." So, she calls me and she
[59:21] says, "Well, Jason, should we go get a
[59:23] test? Should we do this?" And I said,
[59:25] "Well, you know, why not? You know, let
[59:26] let's do this." And, uh, so we did. And
[59:30] and so, uh, looking there, she was
[59:32] depressed. Wasn't showing right then.
[59:35] And I'm looking at it and I saw a faint
[59:39] line. And uh I said, "Honey, I I think I
[59:43] I think you are."
[59:46] She goes, "No, you better not be kidding
[59:47] with me." I'm not. Uh and so then I
[59:52] said, then I went into the living room
[59:53] and I said, "Well, I'm not going to I'm
[59:54] not going to get excited yet until the
[59:57] doctor says so." And uh then next day we
[59:59] went into the doctors and sure enough,
[1:00:01] the doctor confirmed it. And uh and of
[1:00:04] course I'm excited. And then uh and then
[1:00:07] we went and told our my mom and dad and
[1:00:10] and uh my dad gets that little weird
[1:00:12] Yeah. Right. smile because I was really
[1:00:16] quick about it. I I told him I said I
[1:00:18] said uh we were in the middle of
[1:00:19] conversation. I you're always wondering
[1:00:21] how are you going to tell your parents?
[1:00:23] And uh so I was really quick. I said I
[1:00:24] got good news and bad news. They both
[1:00:26] stopped. I said well the bad news is
[1:00:28] that I got to get at 4:30 in the
[1:00:29] morning. Good news is you're going to be
[1:00:30] grandparents.
[1:00:33] Oh, like I said, my dad, my mom, uh,
[1:00:36] because the whole thing was, and this
[1:00:37] this is the miraculous thing is my wife
[1:00:40] and I, we said, well, there are are
[1:00:43] alternatives. We can go to a fertility
[1:00:45] clinic and, you know, conceive that way.
[1:00:49] And in my in my this is how God works
[1:00:53] for me, you know, I, you know, I didn't
[1:00:56] I wasn't up to snuff. And uh, the doctor
[1:00:59] said, "Well, there's no hope. you know,
[1:01:01] you you just can't you just can't have
[1:01:02] babies. You know, there's just not
[1:01:04] enough there. And in all ser
[1:01:06] seriousness, that's that's when God
[1:01:08] steps in. Amen. When the doctors say
[1:01:11] there's nothing, we went to the
[1:01:12] fertility clinic and you know, the
[1:01:15] doctors ran their tests. They said, "No,
[1:01:17] your wife is fine. There's there's
[1:01:18] nothing wrong with her." They they said,
[1:01:20] "Well, there might be enough to where we
[1:01:23] can we can do our procedures." And so,
[1:01:25] they did blood tests on me and
[1:01:27] everything to make sure everything was
[1:01:28] okay. And when everything came back
[1:01:30] positive from the fertility clinic and
[1:01:32] from me, that's when my wife and I found
[1:01:34] out that uh we were expecting. So, we
[1:01:37] know we just want to give God all the
[1:01:39] glory. And it, you know, like that verse
[1:01:41] 24 says in the last verse, I'll close
[1:01:43] with this. And ye shall have them,
[1:01:45] whatever you shall ask. Amen.
[1:01:58] Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; I've got a picture in my Bible, a
[1:02:03] brother Claude segment. Brother Claude,
[1:02:06] I want you to come down here and join
[1:02:08] me. I won't make you testify, but I'll
[1:02:11] just going to ask you a couple
[1:02:13] questions.
[1:02:17] A lot of you folks perhaps don't even
[1:02:18] know who Claude Sigman is.
[1:02:21] Brother Claude, he's been living here
[1:02:24] for quite a few years, but hasn't been
[1:02:27] in the church as such.
[1:02:31] His wife and daughter
[1:02:34] are here. Brother Claude is brother
[1:02:38] Edwin Dodd, sister Sally Dodd's
[1:02:40] son-in-law.
[1:02:42] Come up here, Brother Claude. Brother
[1:02:43] Claude's a friend of mine because he's a
[1:02:45] hunter and a fisherman.
[1:02:47] Brother Claude, you didn't know I was
[1:02:49] going to call you, did you? I hope not.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; How many years you've been living here?
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Uh 21 22 years.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; 22 years. You You come over to the
[1:03:00] microphone. I got one right here. Yeah.
[1:03:02] So they can hear you. So you've been 22
[1:03:04] years here.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh something held you back
[1:03:08] from giving your life to Christ.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Smoking.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Smoking. How many years?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; 39 years.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; 39 years.
[1:03:16] That devil held him. 39 years. And you
[1:03:20] wanted to be in church, I'm sure, many
[1:03:22] times.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; You told me you'd go out fishing. And
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; yeah, I'll go fishing so come to church
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; instead of coming to church and feel
[1:03:31] like you're running away from something.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:03:35] You know how that is. You can run, but
[1:03:37] you can't hide.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; I got a picture here. It's brother
[1:03:41] Claude with a real trophy deer. He'd
[1:03:45] gone out hunting with another man. And
[1:03:48] uh you said something and I just just
[1:03:50] tell the folks what it is you said that
[1:03:51] morning. Said something about if if God
[1:03:53] if you give me that.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. See that night I couldn't
[1:03:57] sleep. So uh
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; just step up to my
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; and everything else. So uh I uh got up
[1:04:02] that morning and I said well he was kept
[1:04:05] on dealing with me and everything else.
[1:04:07] I said well I don't understand what's
[1:04:10] going on but you know it's been 21 years
[1:04:13] since I killed anything. I said, "If you
[1:04:15] give me a deer, I'll lay everything down
[1:04:17] and follow you." So that's what I did.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And then how long was it?
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; 35 minutes later.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; 35 minutes.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; 35 minutes later, God answered his
[1:04:28] prayer. Hallelujah.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; And it's been over since.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I ain't smoke for nine months in a
[1:04:37] week.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Nine months in a week. He's got it down,
[1:04:40] hasn't he?
[1:04:43] God bless you, brother. Appreciate it.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Our God's a mighty deliverer.
[1:04:50] Hallelujah.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; He can heal a cancer,
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; deliver people from a habit, whatever it
[1:04:56] might be,
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; give a couple children.
[1:05:00] In his presence, the supernatural is
[1:05:03] happening. Does anybody deny that?
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; And tonight, we're having at least five
[1:05:08] more baptisms.
[1:05:17] young men. I've been impressed. It's
[1:05:20] been young men and young men who
[1:05:23] graduated. They're in the workforce and
[1:05:25] they've come two of them speaking to
[1:05:28] brother Tom said something happened. I'm
[1:05:31] not even the same person.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; I haven't come and made any big
[1:05:36] profession. Haven't haven't necessarily
[1:05:38] had prayer or whatever more. They're
[1:05:40] just done. They're done with the world.
[1:05:43] They're done with the devil. They're
[1:05:45] done with sin. They're done with
[1:05:47] unbelief. And God came in a sovereign
[1:05:50] move. Said, "I'm a total changed person.
[1:05:54] I need to be baptized." So, we're going
[1:05:56] to be baptizing some more this evening.
[1:05:58] And Brother Zephaniah Peters, who's with
[1:05:59] us, is going to be speaking tonight. And
[1:06:02] immediately after the message, we're
[1:06:04] going to have the baptismal. And we
[1:06:06] don't know what all is going to happen
[1:06:07] because God's working in the unseen.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; One thing I'd like to just mention to
[1:06:13] people that are here. So often things
[1:06:15] that God does gets associated with a
[1:06:19] personality and that's dangerous. And
[1:06:22] people look to a personality. I would
[1:06:24] like to I'd like to make you aware of
[1:06:27] something that's been happening in case
[1:06:30] you haven't picked it up. God began to
[1:06:32] move towards the camp. Before the camp,
[1:06:36] I we were having some unusual meetings.
[1:06:39] Unusual for me and I believe from what
[1:06:42] I've heard from the people unusual
[1:06:45] towards in in your own experience. And
[1:06:48] then they were just different and they
[1:06:50] were in and and I listened to some of
[1:06:52] the testimonies uh because we weren't
[1:06:55] here the last Sunday. I listened to some
[1:06:57] of the testim
[1:07:00] said it actually started with me uh
[1:07:02] prior to camp in the Sunday prior to
[1:07:05] camp or the meetings prior to camp and
[1:07:08] and then so that then we have the local
[1:07:11] ministry. I was ministering in those
[1:07:14] meetings. Then come uh our brother
[1:07:17] Spencer and we had a a marvelous camp
[1:07:21] and then after the camp our brother Tom
[1:07:24] ministered in the Sunday morning service
[1:07:26] and evening brother Tony baptizing to me
[1:07:30] it was a a a very very special uh unique
[1:07:34] thing that God did in letting the people
[1:07:38] know it's not associated
[1:07:42] with any single personality.
[1:07:44] The Holy Spirit is our leader.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he uses one, he uses another,
[1:07:50] he uses whomsoever he chooses. And
[1:07:53] that's just marvelous. It's marvelous in
[1:07:55] my eyes. Next Sunday, Brother Lance Laru
[1:07:58] will be ministering. And I can tell you
[1:08:00] it will just be continuing on. It's a
[1:08:03] move of God. It's not a move of man.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You can stand if you
[1:08:08] would please. And I'll have you uh uh
[1:08:12] just before we read, I'm going to sing
[1:08:14] uh a song that I just heard you're
[1:08:17] playing, Redeemed.
[1:08:20] If you'll start it up, please.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; The price. Oh, hallelujah. Jesus
[1:08:33] has changed my whole life.
[1:08:40] If
[1:08:42] he asks you
[1:08:45] just who I am,
[1:08:49] tell them
[1:08:51] I am free.
[1:08:55] Oh, lift it up. I am redeemed.
[1:09:02] I have a cry. Oh Jesus
[1:09:08] and change my whole life.
[1:09:15] If anybody
[1:09:17] asks you
[1:09:19] just who I am,
[1:09:23] tell them
[1:09:25] I have redeemed. Let all the sisters
[1:09:30] sing. And now sisters
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:38] [Music]
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:41] Jesus
[1:09:42] has changed my all
[1:09:47] his name.
[1:09:49] anybody
[1:09:51] else
[1:09:54] who I am.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Tell them,
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; tell them
[1:10:00] I am.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; All of the brothers shall please.
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:14] Oh Jesus
[1:10:17] my whole life
[1:10:21] [Applause]
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:25] as you
[1:10:27] just who I am
[1:10:31] tell
[1:10:34] I am
[1:10:36] all together now
[1:10:40] I and
[1:10:43] [Music]
[1:10:44] marked with the Christ.
[1:10:49] Jesus
[1:10:50] has changed my whole life.
[1:10:57] If anybody
[1:10:59] asks you
[1:11:01] just who I am,
[1:11:05] tell them
[1:11:08] I am free. Our
[1:11:14] lovely Lord Jesus.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; All glory and praise to you.
[1:11:20] All thanksgiving and honor we exalt your
[1:11:23] name. Glor
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; indeed we are a privileged people.
[1:11:28] Indeed we are so thankful today. We
[1:11:32] thank you for the healings. We thank you
[1:11:35] for the lifegiving. Uh oh God. And we
[1:11:39] thank you, Father, for the deliverance
[1:11:41] that you have wrought, things that are
[1:11:43] visible and things that are invisible.
[1:11:46] for the spirit of God that has moved
[1:11:49] upon the hearts of the people, upon
[1:11:52] those that have been baptized, those
[1:11:55] that will be baptized, oh God, not only
[1:11:58] in water, but baptized with the baptism
[1:12:02] of the Holy Spirit and with fire, for
[1:12:06] you are that baptizer, the sealing of
[1:12:09] the Holy Ghost. So, it's done once and
[1:12:12] for all. We thank you for what you've
[1:12:14] done, oh God. For our brother Jim Hayes,
[1:12:16] our brother Claude Sigman, oh God, how
[1:12:18] we thank you for that deliverance. How
[1:12:20] the devil could not hold him any longer,
[1:12:23] Lord. And for the child that you're
[1:12:25] giving our brother Jason, sister M. Oh
[1:12:27] God, how we thank you for that, Lord.
[1:12:30] Oh, we just see so many things taking
[1:12:32] place. And we want to give you the
[1:12:34] glory. And now we ask that you will take
[1:12:37] the word which is written on the pages
[1:12:39] of holy scripture and open it to us,
[1:12:42] Lord.
[1:12:43] Pray that you'll just establish our
[1:12:45] walk.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Establish us, I pray,
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. Anoint me,
[1:12:50] Father,
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; and anoint the people. I ask and
[1:12:54] especially with our brother Zephaniah
[1:12:56] Peters for this evening, Lord. Oh God,
[1:12:59] we're looking to you. Pray that you will
[1:13:01] remember us in your extended grace and
[1:13:04] mercy
[1:13:06] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank you for
[1:13:10] your extra time that you've given this
[1:13:12] morning. I'll have you turn quickly if
[1:13:14] you would please to John the 4th
[1:13:16] chapter. We're going to
[1:13:19] read I was going to read uh quite a bit
[1:13:22] of this chapter, but I think because of
[1:13:25] the shortness of time,
[1:13:27] you're familiar with the story so well.
[1:13:29] a woman at the well.
[1:13:32] And uh the sixth verse of John 4 says,
[1:13:36] "Jacob's well was there, and Jesus
[1:13:39] therefore being wearied with his
[1:13:41] journey,
[1:13:42] sat thus on the well, and it was about
[1:13:44] the sixth hour.
[1:13:47] There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw
[1:13:49] water." Jesus saith unto her, "Give me
[1:13:52] to drink." For his disciples were gone
[1:13:54] away in unto the city to buy meat. Then
[1:13:58] said the woman of Samaria unto him, how
[1:14:00] is it that thou being a Jew, ask, drink
[1:14:04] of me, which I am a woman of Samaria?
[1:14:06] For the Jews have no dealings with the
[1:14:07] Samaritans. Jesus answered and said unto
[1:14:10] her, if thou kneest the gift of God, and
[1:14:13] who it is that sth to thee, that sth to
[1:14:18] thee, give me to drink, thou wouldest
[1:14:20] have asked of him, and he would have
[1:14:22] given thee living water. The woman sth
[1:14:25] unto him, "Sir, thou hast nothing to
[1:14:27] draw with, and the well is deep, from
[1:14:28] whence then hath hast thou this li that
[1:14:31] living water? Art thou greater than our
[1:14:33] father Jacob, which gave us the well,
[1:14:35] and drank thereof himself, and his
[1:14:37] children, and his cattle?" Jesus
[1:14:39] answered and said unto her, "Whosoever
[1:14:41] drinkketh of this water shall thirst
[1:14:43] again. But whosoever drinkketh of the
[1:14:45] water that I shall give him shall never
[1:14:46] thirst. But the water that I shall give
[1:14:48] him shall be in him a well of water
[1:14:51] springing up into everlasting life. The
[1:14:54] woman said unto him, Sir, give me this
[1:14:57] water that I thirst not, neither come
[1:14:59] hither to draw. Jesus sith unto her, Go,
[1:15:03] call thy husband, and come hither. The
[1:15:05] woman answered and said, I have no
[1:15:07] husband. Jesus said unto her, "Thou hast
[1:15:11] well said, I have no husband, for thou
[1:15:14] hast had five husbands, and he whom thou
[1:15:16] now hast is not thy husband in that in
[1:15:20] that sense thou truly." The woman saith
[1:15:23] unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art
[1:15:25] a prophet. Our fathers worshiped in this
[1:15:27] mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem
[1:15:30] is the place where men ought to worship.
[1:15:33] Jesus saith unto her,"Woman, believe me,
[1:15:36] the hour cometh, when ye shall neither
[1:15:38] in this mountain, nor at Jerusalem
[1:15:40] worship the Father. Ye worship, you know
[1:15:42] not what we know what we worship, for
[1:15:45] salvation is of the Jews. But the hour
[1:15:48] cometh, and now is, when the true
[1:15:50] worshippers shall worship the Father in
[1:15:52] spirit and in truth, for the Father
[1:15:54] seeketh such to worship him." God is the
[1:15:57] spirit, and they that worship him shall
[1:16:00] must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[1:16:02] The woman saith unto him, I know that
[1:16:04] Messiah cometh, which is called Christ.
[1:16:08] When he has come, he will tell us all
[1:16:10] things. Jesus saith unto her, I that
[1:16:13] speak unto thee am he. And when he when
[1:16:17] and upon this came his disciples, and
[1:16:20] marveled that he talked with the woman,
[1:16:22] yet no man said, What seekest thou? or
[1:16:25] why talkst thou with her? The woman then
[1:16:27] left her water pot, and went unto the
[1:16:30] city, and said unto the men, come see a
[1:16:33] man, which told me all things that ever
[1:16:36] I did. Is not this the Christ? Amen. May
[1:16:40] God bless his word as you have your
[1:16:42] seats.
[1:16:48] This portion of scripture actually was
[1:16:50] referred to several hundred times in the
[1:16:54] messages. Uh, as near as I can
[1:16:56] determine, brother Brandham referred to
[1:16:58] the woman at the well 646 times. And
[1:17:03] that to me sends us a powerful message.
[1:17:06] In fact, as I was looking for a place, I
[1:17:08] believe there's one place where he he he
[1:17:10] made reference to this scripture and
[1:17:12] then said that the angel of the Lord had
[1:17:14] directed him to some scriptures. And I
[1:17:17] believe this is one of those. I don't
[1:17:19] have that for certain, but uh he says
[1:17:22] one thing over and over again. He says,
[1:17:26] and right at the time when he himself
[1:17:29] has got people standing in front of him,
[1:17:31] especially if a woman is standing in
[1:17:33] front of him at the platform, he's a
[1:17:36] man. He doesn't know what her need is.
[1:17:38] Uh they're strangers. They've never met.
[1:17:41] He has them raise their hand to show
[1:17:44] that they have never met. They've never
[1:17:46] they don't know each other. And then he
[1:17:49] would refer to the scripture and say,
[1:17:51] "Now Jesus was trying to contact her
[1:17:55] spirit."
[1:17:57] He was trying to contact her spirit.
[1:18:01] And and then
[1:18:03] uh as soon as he would he would get and
[1:18:06] then he said he found her trouble and
[1:18:08] then the same now this is what I want
[1:18:11] you to follow me very close. The same
[1:18:14] Christ, the same one that sat on that
[1:18:18] well. Now, the same spirit begins now
[1:18:22] right there uh 40 years ago, 50 years
[1:18:25] ago, and begins to speak to this woman
[1:18:29] and tells her exactly exactly her
[1:18:32] problem, whatever it might be. and and
[1:18:35] in into minute detail even as Jesus said
[1:18:39] you've had five husbands and the one you
[1:18:41] have now is not your husband begin to
[1:18:43] tell her all these things uh she
[1:18:46] realized right away this was a prophet
[1:18:49] you are a prophet and that was great but
[1:18:51] it wasn't far enough and that was in her
[1:18:54] spirit realm and I want to speak to you
[1:18:56] this morning about taking control of the
[1:18:59] human spirit because I believe it is
[1:19:02] that same one that came not to a well in
[1:19:06] Samaria, not to Jacob's well, but came
[1:19:09] to a tent in Birch Bay, Washington, came
[1:19:13] to a a certain seat, came to a church in
[1:19:17] Cloverdale, came to a certain place, and
[1:19:21] actually came when a lot of you that God
[1:19:24] has moved on recently, you were on your
[1:19:28] journey to do your own specific thing.
[1:19:31] You thought that, you know, this is what
[1:19:33] I need to do. This is what I always do.
[1:19:35] I always come and get water at this time
[1:19:37] of the day. I've got my pot. I'm going
[1:19:39] to the well. I'm going to Jacob's well.
[1:19:41] We do this all the time. We do it. We
[1:19:43] have a camp all the time. It's this
[1:19:44] year. It's another year. And some maybe
[1:19:47] maybe she didn't even really want to go.
[1:19:49] Do I have to go? This is, you know, all
[1:19:51] this burdensome work and this labor and
[1:19:52] all the rest of it. Do I, you know, and
[1:19:55] and there's some of you here and I've
[1:19:56] even heard, well, I didn't really want
[1:19:58] to go. I didn't really want to attend. I
[1:20:00] I had no interest in in the camp really.
[1:20:02] It wasn't. But little did you realize
[1:20:04] who it was that was sitting there
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; and just started talking with you
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; and you didn't realize it. Just began to
[1:20:13] speak to you and and she didn't know who
[1:20:15] she was talking to and you didn't know
[1:20:17] who you who was talking to you. And
[1:20:19] Jesus said, "If you'd only known if you
[1:20:21] only knew the gift of God and who it is
[1:20:25] that's speaking to you." Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; You see, it's not it's not just uh uh
[1:20:32] some preacher and it's not just a book
[1:20:35] now. We are under we are under the
[1:20:38] banner of that same message. And this is
[1:20:40] the point I'm going to want to bring to
[1:20:42] you very very clearly today. We are
[1:20:44] under the banner of that ministry. That
[1:20:48] ministry has not faded away. When Jesus
[1:20:51] left, his ministry didn't end. Then
[1:20:54] started Peter and James and John and the
[1:20:58] Apostle Paul. And then God called and
[1:21:00] the ministry continued on. See, they had
[1:21:03] a sovereign move in the book of Acts on
[1:21:06] the day of Pentecost. That was a
[1:21:08] sovereign move. But they didn't go the
[1:21:11] next week and try to redo that same
[1:21:14] move. They didn't try and say, "We got
[1:21:17] to have another upper room. We've got to
[1:21:19] have another 120. We've got to duplicate
[1:21:22] that." See, we don't have to duplicate
[1:21:24] what happened in Birch Bay. We don't
[1:21:26] have to duplicate what happened at any
[1:21:27] other uh any other special meeting. We
[1:21:30] don't try to duplicate last Sunday, for
[1:21:32] example. But it's the same God that
[1:21:34] moves on from one station to another to
[1:21:36] another. The same God. But once the
[1:21:39] sovereign move of God happens in an
[1:21:42] individual's life or within a church,
[1:21:45] once a sovereign move happens takes
[1:21:48] place, then comes another uh very very
[1:21:51] important facet or part of the of of the
[1:21:55] work of God and that is now we are we
[1:21:59] are required to take a hold of that and
[1:22:02] build
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; on top of that. We are need we need to
[1:22:06] build and you young people will need to
[1:22:08] take and build on top of that. And
[1:22:11] sometimes that is not as exciting as the
[1:22:13] initial thing that God did with you. You
[1:22:16] know the the deliverance, the birth, the
[1:22:19] baptism, the sealing, all of these
[1:22:21] things are so wonderful and we just
[1:22:24] revel in it and then but then comes some
[1:22:26] hard work
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; and and then comes some discipline and
[1:22:30] then comes some building. But that's
[1:22:32] what that's what God really honors.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:41] I want to just establish. I'm going back
[1:22:43] now. I just kind of launched out into
[1:22:45] it. I want to go back just a wee bit.
[1:22:47] And uh Jesus said to her, "If you knew
[1:22:51] who it was that saith to you, I would
[1:22:53] like to just rehearse and review with
[1:22:56] the congregation this morning." And the
[1:22:59] service today is is really focused upon
[1:23:03] what God has been doing and the lives
[1:23:05] that he's been touching. And I'm
[1:23:07] addressing largely you young people. And
[1:23:10] not only the young people, but those of
[1:23:12] you throughout the congregation who has
[1:23:14] felt a a a special time with God
[1:23:19] recently. I have.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; I have. It's not just you young people,
[1:23:24] but brother Biscll is pastor stood there
[1:23:27] when God was moving at the at the at the
[1:23:30] front. I stood at the altar.
[1:23:33] I said, "I want to dedicate again. I
[1:23:38] want to take and have another hard look
[1:23:40] at my own life. I want to see what more
[1:23:44] I can do. God, extend my life. Extend my
[1:23:47] energy. I want to be more fruitful for
[1:23:50] you. I want to be a part of this. I
[1:23:53] talked to one of my daughters. I said,
[1:23:55] "There's a real sweep and move of God
[1:23:58] taking place." Sister Marilyn, it was.
[1:24:01] And Marilyn says, "That's right. And I
[1:24:03] want to be right in the middle of it."
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That should be all of our
[1:24:08] cry and our determination. I want to be
[1:24:10] right in the middle of it.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be on the outskirts or
[1:24:13] on the, you know, on the perimeter. I
[1:24:15] want to be in the middle of it.
[1:24:20] who it is that was speaking
[1:24:24] and I believe I can just add a dimension
[1:24:26] to it for you
[1:24:30] in the message blind bareard
[1:24:33] I want you to think about this now
[1:24:35] here's brother Brandham speaking he said
[1:24:37] you heard my word
[1:24:40] and you had a right to doubt it you
[1:24:42] heard my word and you had a right to
[1:24:44] doubt it but this is not me speaking
[1:24:48] It's him. And to doubt him is sin. In a
[1:24:53] manifestation of the spirit, he said,
[1:24:55] "You heard me telling you something,
[1:24:57] speaking to a person, didn't you? That
[1:25:01] was my voice, but it was not me
[1:25:04] operating it. It was a supernatural
[1:25:09] being." Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; You heard a man speak.
[1:25:14] Whoever that minister is.
[1:25:16] Uh you heard the word of God declared.
[1:25:20] And the ministry that comes from this
[1:25:23] pulpit
[1:25:24] is that which has been birthed under and
[1:25:29] given over to the very same spirit that
[1:25:32] spoke through that prophet of God. We
[1:25:34] don't want anything else. I want someone
[1:25:37] that knows what not only this person's
[1:25:40] trouble is or difficulty, but what was
[1:25:42] holding you back
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; or you back or you back or some sister
[1:25:47] over here or anyone whatever was a
[1:25:50] hindrance to to our walk. I want to have
[1:25:54] someone or or or the cancer brother
[1:25:58] Jim's face. I want someone who knows how
[1:26:01] to destroy that thing. I want someone
[1:26:05] that can loose the bonds that have held
[1:26:07] a man for 39 years. I want someone and I
[1:26:11] want to know who it is that's speaking.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; If it's just a man, his words will fail.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; If it's just a sermon, we've heard lots
[1:26:20] of good sermons and great men and
[1:26:23] theologians and they can bring the word
[1:26:25] of God till it just thrills you. But
[1:26:28] yet, we need something more than that.
[1:26:30] We need to know who it is that's
[1:26:32] speaking.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; And if we know the one who's speaking,
[1:26:36] hallelujah.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; He's the author of life.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's never known a defeat ever. If
[1:26:45] we know who's speaking, it changes the
[1:26:47] whole scene.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Was it just a feeling I had? Was it just
[1:26:52] some emotion I had? Well, if it was, it
[1:26:55] could be like this woman. Brother
[1:26:57] Brandham said that he was trying to
[1:26:59] contact her spirit. But the reason he
[1:27:01] was seeking to contact her spirit is he
[1:27:04] was seeking to take control of her
[1:27:06] spirit and bring the word down to her
[1:27:09] soul.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what he does. That's
[1:27:13] the the way that he does do it. It's not
[1:27:16] me. He's using my voice, but it's not
[1:27:21] me. It's him.
[1:27:23] When a man stands and perhaps
[1:27:27] uh takes a quote as I will today and
[1:27:30] make reference to a number of quotes, I
[1:27:34] want to ask this congregation,
[1:27:36] is it me reading a quote
[1:27:39] or was it a man uh brother Brandham
[1:27:43] so many years ago, whether it's the 50s
[1:27:45] or the 60s or whenever it was, is it him
[1:27:49] that we're quoting
[1:27:52] or should We ask ourselves,
[1:27:55] is someone, a supernatural being trying
[1:27:59] to speak to us and say, "Oh, if you only
[1:28:03] knew the gift of God
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; and who it is that's speaking,
[1:28:09] it would change our perspective about
[1:28:11] the service this morning. We say, who is
[1:28:14] this
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; that's seeking me? Who is it that's
[1:28:19] calling?
[1:28:21] Who is it that's troubling my heart or
[1:28:23] or or seeking to bring me peace? Who is
[1:28:26] this?
[1:28:29] And that was key. That was a key point.
[1:28:32] Who is it
[1:28:36] in the message thirst?
[1:28:38] He's saying when the deep calleth to the
[1:28:41] deep, it takes more than joining a
[1:28:43] church.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; It takes more than shaking hands with a
[1:28:46] preacher. It takes more than living a
[1:28:49] good straight life.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; To all of you that have been baptized,
[1:28:53] it takes more than living just a good
[1:28:55] straight life. It takes something to
[1:28:58] satisfy the inside of you.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; That pours down, he says, from God into
[1:29:08] your soul. So it it goes beyond the
[1:29:11] wonderful feeling and the oh the oh the
[1:29:15] exuberance we had and waving our hands
[1:29:17] and whatever more that's wonderful but
[1:29:19] it goes further than that say oh I'm
[1:29:22] just so thrilled I don't hardly know I
[1:29:23] I'm just ready to explode but it goes
[1:29:26] deeper than that and the Holy Spirit is
[1:29:29] taking a hold of the word of God and
[1:29:32] bringing it down past the body and
[1:29:34] through the spirit taking control of the
[1:29:36] spirit and remember the spirit is right
[1:29:38] next to the soul.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; For the word of God is quick and
[1:29:42] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:29:44] sword, piercing even to the dividing
[1:29:48] aunderder of soul and spirit because the
[1:29:50] spirit and the soul lie right next
[1:29:52] together. Amen.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; And that is why so many can get into an
[1:29:57] emotional realm and in the realm of the
[1:29:59] memory, the realm of the imagination,
[1:30:02] the the affection and and the reasoning
[1:30:04] can get into those realms and feel as
[1:30:07] though God has done something when
[1:30:10] actually God is starting to do something
[1:30:13] and he wants to go further than that and
[1:30:15] he's seeking to pull that take control
[1:30:17] of that spirit and bring the bring the
[1:30:21] resource down to the soul.
[1:30:23] He says it comes from God to the soul.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; How do I know when it's in the soul?
[1:30:28] I'll tell you what, when it's in the
[1:30:30] soul, it doesn't matter whether it rains
[1:30:31] or shines.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; It's still the same. Doesn't matter
[1:30:35] where things go good or things go bad.
[1:30:38] It doesn't matter whether you have a job
[1:30:40] or you just got fired. It doesn't matter
[1:30:42] whether you just heard you're terminally
[1:30:44] ill or whether you got perfect health.
[1:30:47] When your when the resources come down
[1:30:49] to the soul, it's all over.
[1:30:52] Hallelujah. You're done. You're done
[1:30:54] with the world. You're done with all of
[1:30:56] the world. You're done with anything
[1:30:58] that even tastes or hints of the world.
[1:31:01] You're finished with it.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; That's what God is doing.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And that's where we want to go on. We
[1:31:09] want to take now another step.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. in a thinking man's filter
[1:31:15] said the soul is drawing your resource
[1:31:19] through the outside down through the
[1:31:21] spirit into the soul. Your soul is
[1:31:24] drawing it. Your soul is calling for it.
[1:31:27] Your eternal body is calling for the
[1:31:29] message even that you're hearing this
[1:31:31] morning. It's not me who wants to preach
[1:31:33] it. Your soul has called for it. Your
[1:31:36] body on the other side is calling for it
[1:31:39] for you to take another step.
[1:31:42] Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; As I said a few moments ago, God has
[1:31:50] moved in a
[1:31:52] most unexpected and sovereign way.
[1:31:55] Nobody planned it. Nobody organized it.
[1:31:59] We simply do what we
[1:32:03] should do. Do it with all of our heart.
[1:32:06] And then God has to come in.
[1:32:10] And I can tell you, don't whatever you
[1:32:12] do,
[1:32:14] don't look lightly
[1:32:16] on the move of God.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; You might live the rest of your life and
[1:32:20] not see anything quite like it again.
[1:32:23] When God was reaching down and taking
[1:32:26] lives and transforming them, even to the
[1:32:30] point where they themselves, and I know
[1:32:33] I speak for a number, they themselves
[1:32:36] are bewildered at what's happening.
[1:32:38] something is changing within them. I can
[1:32:41] tell you when God delivers a person from
[1:32:44] a habit that habit becomes so foreign to
[1:32:47] them and that whole old life becomes so
[1:32:49] foreign as it is as the apostle Paul the
[1:32:52] past uh the past is not merely forgotten
[1:32:56] but it is it is the things that you once
[1:32:59] loved you hate and the things that you
[1:33:02] once hated you love.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You talk about a turnaround.
[1:33:06] That's what God does. And that can
[1:33:09] happen so swift and it does happen so
[1:33:11] swift. Sometimes with others it is more
[1:33:14] uh gradual but it is so swift that a
[1:33:17] person is bewildered what's happening.
[1:33:20] But you just let go and let God have his
[1:33:22] way.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; And so we are we have and we are
[1:33:26] responding to the voice of God
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; and the moving of his spirit. And now we
[1:33:33] must make that sovereign move of God.
[1:33:39] We must make that sovereign move of God
[1:33:41] the foundation upon which we build for
[1:33:46] your individual life.
[1:33:49] Brother Brandon was referring to the
[1:33:51] scripture. Let us be glad and rejoice
[1:33:53] and give honor to him for the marriage
[1:33:56] of lamb has come and the his wife hath
[1:34:00] made herself ready. And he made a
[1:34:02] special point with that. And he said,
[1:34:04] "If you notice, she made herself ready."
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; So many says, "If the Lord will take
[1:34:12] this evil spirit from me," now just
[1:34:13] listen. So many say, "If the Lord will
[1:34:16] take this evil spirit from me from
[1:34:18] drinking or from gambling or from lying
[1:34:21] or from stealing, I'll serve him." He
[1:34:24] said, "But that's up to you.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; That's up to you." say, "It's not if God
[1:34:32] does this, if God does that." God
[1:34:34] already moved by his spirit upon your
[1:34:36] heart and you heard his voice. And I'm
[1:34:39] here to say today, I want you to pay
[1:34:41] real strict attention who it is that was
[1:34:44] speaking. Not merely a quote, not merely
[1:34:47] brother Ron Spencer, brother Ed Biscll
[1:34:49] or Brother Tom Ray or brother Lance
[1:34:51] Laroo, brother John Andy's, brother
[1:34:53] Ernie Noea, brother Tony. It it it it
[1:34:55] isn't it isn't the individual who it is
[1:34:59] that was speaking. When a person says
[1:35:01] God spoke to me
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; as many of you are seated here today God
[1:35:06] has spoken to me. My next question is
[1:35:09] why has he spoken to what is his
[1:35:11] purpose? What does he intend now to
[1:35:14] happen?
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying there's something for us
[1:35:19] to do. But that's up to you. He said
[1:35:22] you've got to do something.
[1:35:25] He says they they that overcome they
[1:35:28] that overcome shall inherit
[1:35:32] all things. He says they that overcome.
[1:35:36] You have the power to do it, but you
[1:35:38] must be willing to lay it down.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I felt to have these
[1:35:45] testimonies today because I want to make
[1:35:46] reference back to them because there
[1:35:48] were principles that were involved. And
[1:35:50] I believe that when brother Claude said
[1:35:52] his simple prayer to God, his words, "If
[1:35:55] you do that, I'll do this." God's a real
[1:35:58] businessman, he took him at his word.
[1:36:00] Hallelujah. If you'll do that, I'll do
[1:36:03] this. I believe when brother Jim sat in
[1:36:05] that chair and said to those doctors,
[1:36:07] "Four men of God, four uh whatever are
[1:36:10] stewards of God, to me, that high priest
[1:36:13] said, "I have to move. I have to move on
[1:36:16] that. That is a profession." and his
[1:36:19] heart is convinced of that and according
[1:36:22] to the word of God. I have to move on
[1:36:24] that
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:36:29] That's something that we do and we must
[1:36:31] be willing to lay it down. He said she
[1:36:33] made herself ready. He said, you see,
[1:36:35] God could not push us.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; God could not push us through a little
[1:36:41] pipe. He's not trying to push you young
[1:36:44] people through a little pipe to come out
[1:36:47] the other end and say, "Blessed is he
[1:36:50] that overcomemeth." It's not God pulling
[1:36:52] you through a pipe and then on the end
[1:36:54] saying, "Blessed is he that
[1:36:55] overcomemeth." He said, "You had nothing
[1:36:57] to overcome."
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; If God just pulled you through a pipe,
[1:37:00] you had nothing to overcome. He said he
[1:37:03] just pushed you through. But you've got
[1:37:05] to make you've got to make decisions for
[1:37:09] yourself. And that you have I'm glad
[1:37:12] that you've made decisions. You said
[1:37:14] that was God that's speaking to me and I
[1:37:17] need to be baptized in the name of the
[1:37:19] Lord Jesus Christ. You made decisions.
[1:37:22] He says I have to make decisions for
[1:37:24] myself. He's saying in doing that we
[1:37:28] show our faith and respects to God.
[1:37:32] So the purpose the purpose that we have
[1:37:35] now is to build upon what God has done.
[1:37:41] It's important that we have a good
[1:37:43] understanding
[1:37:44] and and the purpose of the service this
[1:37:46] morning is to attempt to try to give you
[1:37:49] a good understanding of what has and is
[1:37:53] taking place. What is actually taking
[1:37:55] place? That's number one. And number
[1:37:57] two, who is it that has called you that
[1:38:00] I started off with? And number three,
[1:38:02] and for what purpose has he called you?
[1:38:08] Now, Brother Brandham referred to the
[1:38:10] woman at the well, and I'm going to make
[1:38:12] a reference back to her.
[1:38:16] Uh,
[1:38:18] this is who I want speaking to me.
[1:38:24] And I'm just going to read this with a
[1:38:26] purpose.
[1:38:29] There's a little lady sitting here with
[1:38:31] her head bowed. Now, this is one that
[1:38:34] was speaking in 1957
[1:38:38] 57. Do you know what eternal life is?
[1:38:42] What's 40 years? What's 50 years? What's
[1:38:44] 100 years? What's a thousand years?
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; It's not even
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; God. God's not a man. God's God.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; God's eternal.
[1:38:58] And I say this same God, this same God,
[1:39:02] I am thoroughly convinced that this was
[1:39:05] not a man that was could say these
[1:39:08] things. A little lady is sitting here
[1:39:11] with her head bowed and she's suffering
[1:39:13] with a bright disease.
[1:39:16] How many here know anything about a
[1:39:18] bright disease?
[1:39:20] One.
[1:39:22] It's not a very common disease.
[1:39:25] Here's a prophet
[1:39:27] calling a woman out of an audience.
[1:39:30] You're suffering with brights disease.
[1:39:32] Now, that's not saying you got a pain in
[1:39:34] your back or you got a pain and ache in
[1:39:38] your knee. He's telling her precisely
[1:39:41] and I had to look it up and it happens
[1:39:43] to be a kidney disease and people it can
[1:39:46] be terminal and people die from it. And
[1:39:48] he's saying you have a bright disease
[1:39:51] and you believe with all your heart. He
[1:39:53] said that kind of struck you.
[1:39:56] You were praying, weren't you? And you
[1:39:59] believed me to be his servant. Notice
[1:40:01] now what he says. Have bright disease
[1:40:04] again. He said,
[1:40:06] he said, I don't know you, do I, lady.
[1:40:09] I'm a stranger to you, but God does know
[1:40:12] you. And that's right. He says, there's
[1:40:15] some connection.
[1:40:17] There's some connection about a
[1:40:19] minister.
[1:40:21] Your husband's a preacher.
[1:40:24] That's right. And your name is Flossy.
[1:40:28] That's right. And your last name is
[1:40:31] Woodward.
[1:40:33] That's right.
[1:40:36] She didn't even have to say that's
[1:40:37] right. He's saying that's right.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; And I see you standing by a street
[1:40:44] called Willleta.
[1:40:46] That's right. and your number is 3322
[1:40:51] West Wleta Street. If that's right,
[1:40:55] raise up your hand. Do you believe me to
[1:40:58] be God's prophet? I certainly do.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; That same God. And then he goes on. He
[1:41:07] says,
[1:41:09] he says, "And then you get what you
[1:41:10] asked for in Christ's name." What about
[1:41:13] you way back?
[1:41:18] What do you think, young man?
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; My book laying in your lap.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Way back. Yes, sir.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; You young man with my book laying in
[1:41:34] your lap,
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; a Mexican boy. Do you believe in you'll
[1:41:40] get over that epilepsy?
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; I got thinking about way back. Yes, sir.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; I thought maybe way forward, way up,
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; in the Birch Bay, Washington,
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; sat a young man,
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; way up there.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly your heritage. He knew
[1:42:01] exactly your color, knew exactly where
[1:42:04] you come from, knew exactly what street
[1:42:07] you lived on, knew exactly your house
[1:42:10] number.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:42:14] Who's speaking?
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; If you only knew who it is that speaketh
[1:42:19] to you. If you only knew the gift of
[1:42:21] God. And now you begin to discover. Oh
[1:42:24] God, I felt this before. My parents have
[1:42:26] told me about it. The preachers preached
[1:42:28] about it. But now it's coming to me.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; God's coming to your own address.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; God knows exactly the book that's laying
[1:42:36] in your lap today.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; He knows what you've been reading.
[1:42:43] Oh, if we only knew, then we can say,
[1:42:45] "Oh, this Christ, thou art the Messiah,
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; this word, this spirit, this message
[1:42:53] which we have, you're none other than
[1:42:55] the Christ, the son of the living God."
[1:42:59] And then you're ready. Then you're in
[1:43:01] line to receive the full benefit more
[1:43:05] than even that feeling perhaps at the
[1:43:08] tent or in another service. more than
[1:43:10] even being baptized. But beyond that and
[1:43:13] further than from that, you say, "Oh,
[1:43:15] brother Biscll, are there things that
[1:43:17] are more wonderful? Things that are yet
[1:43:19] more glorious." Hallelujah.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; And maybe not in a in an emotional way
[1:43:24] and yet may might be.
[1:43:27] I can tell you friends,
[1:43:32] it's a great
[1:43:35] God has a lot of ways to bless
[1:43:39] his people.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; A lot of ways.
[1:43:44] Bless you with health,
[1:43:47] bless you with your family,
[1:43:50] bless you with brothers and sisters in
[1:43:53] Christ. God is not limited as to how he
[1:43:57] benefits his people. I'm convinced this
[1:44:00] morning he loves his people. I do not
[1:44:03] say lightly he loves you. But I say it
[1:44:05] with all sincerity. He loves you because
[1:44:08] you love him. You love his word. You
[1:44:10] love his manifestation. You love his
[1:44:12] revelation. You love him. And he loves
[1:44:15] you.
[1:44:17] Amen.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Feel if I didn't say anything further
[1:44:20] today than to announce to you that he
[1:44:23] loves you with an undying love. He loves
[1:44:24] you with a love that you cannot even
[1:44:27] begin to uh uh know its depths.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; He said the sign of the prophet was only
[1:44:35] vindication of his presence.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; The sign of the prophet, that sign,
[1:44:41] you're living on West Wleta Street, 3322
[1:44:45] West Walleta. that sign that he spoke to
[1:44:48] you, that sign and and and the very fact
[1:44:51] that that voice of that I would say it's
[1:44:53] the same one that said 3322 was saying
[1:44:56] to you
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; in Birch Bay saying to you this morning,
[1:45:00] knowing exactly your situation, exactly
[1:45:03] your condition, if I could get you to
[1:45:05] believe that all things are possible
[1:45:07] here today,
[1:45:10] not in another camp meeting, not in some
[1:45:12] other special service, a Wednesday
[1:45:14] night, a Friday night, or tonight. The
[1:45:16] same God, hallelujah, that spoke to the
[1:45:19] woman at the well is the same God knows
[1:45:22] your address, knows where you live,
[1:45:25] knows how you drove here today, knows
[1:45:27] how much fuel's in your tank.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Is the same God.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; That's the same God that's breathing
[1:45:37] upon our young people.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; And not exclusive to young people as
[1:45:42] well.
[1:45:46] I'm convinced and my heart was touched.
[1:45:49] He says a young man way back. Oh, I sat
[1:45:53] that. Oh, God. It wasn't in that
[1:45:55] meeting, but you're the same Lord Jesus.
[1:45:58] You came and sat in that service. You
[1:46:00] sat night after night in the meetings
[1:46:03] and you talked to them. This is way
[1:46:04] back, way up here in 2005,
[1:46:08] in a more wicked time, in a more evil
[1:46:12] day. But you're the same mighty God. And
[1:46:15] I tell you, God's hands are not going to
[1:46:17] be tied by drugs or by cigarettes or by
[1:46:20] alcohol or by friends or by your peers.
[1:46:24] God's hands are not tied.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; You're loosed.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; This move of God has loosed you.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Be not bound again or encumbered with
[1:46:40] the things of this life.
[1:46:43] Don't come back into bondage once again.
[1:46:45] You enjoy this liberty and tell the
[1:46:48] devil his backbone is broken. As brother
[1:46:50] Ron Spencer said,
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:47:00] this woman and I take her because the
[1:47:03] brother Brandon referred to her so many
[1:47:05] times.
[1:47:09] She certainly did not expect
[1:47:12] to encounter what she had encountered.
[1:47:14] And there are some principles here which
[1:47:17] I want to get on to right away.
[1:47:21] said he sat down
[1:47:25] one day up in Samaria.
[1:47:30] He said the Samaritans, he sat down by a
[1:47:33] well and a woman came. He was
[1:47:36] introducing his ministry to the
[1:47:38] Samaritans.
[1:47:41] The Jews, he said, real well-trained
[1:47:44] Jews.
[1:47:45] They knew what the sign of Messiah was.
[1:47:50] And the real trained Samaritans knew
[1:47:52] what the sign of Messiah was.
[1:47:55] And here he is saying there.
[1:47:59] I wonder about the Gentiles.
[1:48:03] I wonder about the Gentiles. And here we
[1:48:06] are. I wonder about the Gentiles when he
[1:48:09] made his visit in the last days to the
[1:48:11] Gentiles. Jesus Christ the same
[1:48:14] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:48:16] And I wondered and and I I'm I'm very
[1:48:19] very I'm profoundly affected
[1:48:22] and I even my own wife drives me. She
[1:48:26] says, you know, you're seeing things
[1:48:28] different. And I said, I am.
[1:48:31] So, I've never heard you speak like
[1:48:34] you're speaking. And I said, no. And
[1:48:36] I've never experienced what I'm
[1:48:37] experiencing.
[1:48:39] It's something sovereign.
[1:48:41] It's something so unusual.
[1:48:44] And it is none less. And something that
[1:48:46] is specifically to be specific with you,
[1:48:49] I've been able to identify there has
[1:48:52] come so that when I when I read and hear
[1:48:55] a quote, it's as though it's right now
[1:48:57] here. The same person's here.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; I don't even read it as 1957 or 1963.
[1:49:02] Eternal God right here who said it then
[1:49:05] is saying it now. He's saying it again.
[1:49:07] The same Jesus Christ. Not another. The
[1:49:11] same one. And there's no difference in
[1:49:13] time, my friend, for the woman at the
[1:49:16] weller, you sitting here, you sister
[1:49:17] sitting here, it makes no difference.
[1:49:19] That same one that knew her her
[1:49:22] condition and everything and her thirst
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; knew her thirst.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; That's a great thing.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Knew what she was craving for.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; That same God.
[1:49:34] He says, 'I wonder about the Gentiles
[1:49:39] when he's made his visit in the last
[1:49:41] days.
[1:49:42] I wonder about us Gentiles. Here we are.
[1:49:46] If you only knew the gift of God.
[1:49:49] Oh, what he's given. You're living in a
[1:49:52] golden age. You're living in a time when
[1:49:55] he has fully
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; and completely revealed himself.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; And we've heard it. I said, "Well, I've
[1:50:02] heard that before." But have you
[1:50:04] participated?
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Have you got a hold of it?
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Now the sweep of God. But now what you
[1:50:10] do with it,
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; that's that's key. This is this is
[1:50:14] critical what we do now.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:50:19] She like us, like you, like I
[1:50:23] is made up of body, soul, and spirit.
[1:50:26] She had her physical need.
[1:50:29] Coming to the well to get water. You
[1:50:32] have your physical needs. You go to
[1:50:33] work. You earn a paycheck.
[1:50:37] You have your daily duties. You sisters,
[1:50:40] we have our physical needs. We have our
[1:50:42] emotional needs.
[1:50:44] They're very real. You have your
[1:50:47] emotional need, whether you regard it or
[1:50:49] not. But we have our spiritual need.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we don't want to stop at
[1:50:55] the natural blessing. And we don't want
[1:50:57] to stop at the phys at the blessing
[1:51:00] within the spirit realm. We don't want
[1:51:02] to stop with our, you know, our our our
[1:51:04] emotional realm being uh satisfied, but
[1:51:08] we want to draw that resource from God
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; down to our soul.
[1:51:18] I thought of this statement
[1:51:23] in God commissioning Moses.
[1:51:27] Now,
[1:51:29] Brother Brandham says this,
[1:51:31] "Have faith now in God and believe
[1:51:34] everybody. Just try to be level and calm
[1:51:38] just as you can." You don't realize,
[1:51:41] friend, what a strain. You're living in
[1:51:44] two worlds at the same time. But the
[1:51:46] angel of the Lord that you see on this
[1:51:49] picture is here now. So, he was pointing
[1:51:52] to something previous. A picture had
[1:51:54] been taken some time now. He was trying
[1:51:56] to get those people to believe that same
[1:51:59] one was there now.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; And I'm trying today to get that same
[1:52:02] one he spoke about is here now.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; From the picture to the meeting, from
[1:52:07] the meeting to this meeting is
[1:52:09] irrelevant to God. There's no time with
[1:52:11] God. That same God,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that hung over and had a
[1:52:15] picture taken. That same God here at the
[1:52:18] pullpit, here at the platform, here in
[1:52:20] this meeting, and where faith is is a
[1:52:23] milky white wave. Hallelujah. Cloud of
[1:52:26] faith upon the people. God is here.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; God is present.
[1:52:37] I've never thought of this quite like
[1:52:39] this. Now you folks are under the banner
[1:52:43] of this message. Here come a messenger
[1:52:45] is what he said.
[1:52:47] Every spirit
[1:52:49] in this building is subject to me.
[1:52:54] by Jesus Christ.
[1:52:59] I begin to think about that.
[1:53:02] Maybe a few thousand people
[1:53:06] and a man is standing here
[1:53:10] and declaring and it being confirmed. I
[1:53:14] take every spirit. I've got all kinds of
[1:53:15] places. I take every spirit in this
[1:53:19] building. every spirit
[1:53:23] under my control for the glory of God.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Every imagination, every reasoning,
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; every affection,
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; every memory,
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; taking all memory, bring it into
[1:53:36] captivity. And that's what Jesus did at
[1:53:39] the well. He took all of her spirit into
[1:53:42] control
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; to bring the word down to the soul. And
[1:53:46] I feel that God wouldn't even be talking
[1:53:48] to me that way if that isn't what he was
[1:53:50] intent on doing here in this service
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; here to you.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Take control. Oh, memory. What a
[1:53:57] destroyer it is.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; What a destroyer of relationships. What
[1:54:01] a destroyer of faith.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; What a torment can be in a person's
[1:54:05] memory.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; And imagination.
[1:54:11] How people serve God in imagination
[1:54:13] never get to it.
[1:54:16] in our reasoning. Reason it this way,
[1:54:18] reason it that way, and get absolutely
[1:54:20] nowhere,
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; just dry up
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; reasoning
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; our affection. How many people I have
[1:54:27] seen in my ministry couldn't get on with
[1:54:29] God because of their affection. A
[1:54:32] boyfriend for a girlfriend, a girlfriend
[1:54:34] for a boyfriend. I was in a meeting and
[1:54:37] a young man says, he said, "And God
[1:54:39] dealt with him. God, this same Jesus
[1:54:41] that sat on the well spoke to him. I
[1:54:45] knew it. He knew it. He said, "I can't."
[1:54:48] He said, "If I do, my wife will leave
[1:54:50] me." And he he refused it. Two weeks
[1:54:53] later, his wife left him
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; with the children.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; When God deals with somebody, I tell you
[1:55:05] what, it's time to move.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Time to move. The reason I was just
[1:55:10] hesitant for a moment, I just thought of
[1:55:12] another one. And more come to my mind
[1:55:15] down through the ministry where people
[1:55:17] have looked right straight at salvation,
[1:55:20] at deliverance. They look straight at
[1:55:22] the promise of God and they knew that
[1:55:24] God was moving and speaking to them
[1:55:26] right then. They said, "Uh, another time
[1:55:29] or some other time when things are more
[1:55:31] convenient." And with King Agria, he
[1:55:33] never got a more convenient time. The
[1:55:36] convenient time is when God comes. The
[1:55:39] convenient time is when he's sitting on
[1:55:41] the well. The convenient time is now.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Now's the day of salvation.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the day of
[1:55:49] deliverance.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; This is a convenient time.
[1:55:53] I've
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; seen so many wait for that convenient
[1:55:55] time and it never came.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Taking control of the human spirit.
[1:56:08] And I began to think the prophet of God
[1:56:12] skipping across the country,
[1:56:15] taking control of every human spirit
[1:56:19] of several thousand here and hundreds
[1:56:22] here and thousands there.
[1:56:25] And I I said, "God,
[1:56:29] this is you. This is still you. This is
[1:56:32] you. And you must take control of the
[1:56:35] human spirit. You must take control of
[1:56:37] the human spirit and bring that resource
[1:56:40] down. Don't leave us to a a a fluff.
[1:56:43] Don't leave us just to a move in a tent.
[1:56:46] Don't move leave us just to a wonderful
[1:56:48] Sunday service whenever it was or an
[1:56:50] evening service when people get all
[1:56:52] moved and then the next day it's gone.
[1:56:54] The Monday morning will come as somebody
[1:56:56] said at camp. The Monday morning will
[1:56:57] come. But when God has pulled the
[1:57:00] resource down to the soul, Monday
[1:57:02] morning is the same as Sunday.
[1:57:05] Hallelujah.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; You're in a jubilee all the time.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are. Hallelujah.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. I'm going to
[1:57:17] rejoice.
[1:57:19] [Music]
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, I'm just saying it
[1:57:24] so you catch it. In the name of Jesus
[1:57:26] Christ, the son of God, I take every
[1:57:28] spirit in here under my control for the
[1:57:31] glory of God. Don't get any ideas. I'm
[1:57:33] not saying that that I am. I'm saying
[1:57:35] that one who said that is here.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; There's the mistake. They said, "Oh,
[1:57:41] William Brandham said it." No, he
[1:57:43] couldn't say that. How can a man take
[1:57:45] control of every spirit?
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; It was the Christ that sat on the well.
[1:57:51] Hallelujah. He's the same Jesus, the
[1:57:54] same Christ that sat on the well here in
[1:57:56] this service. Maybe sitting here, I
[1:57:58] don't know. But he's speaking to the
[1:58:00] individual heart. Yes.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; And his purpose is to bring that
[1:58:04] resource down
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; from a wonderful feeling in the natural
[1:58:08] it is God down to the soul down into the
[1:58:12] spirit through the spirit into the soul.
[1:58:16] And there it's anchored
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; there. It'll never move.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; There's no power.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; There's not will separate us. What can
[1:58:26] separate us from the love of God in
[1:58:28] Christ Jesus? What's going to take this
[1:58:30] away from you? Nothing.
[1:58:32] Nothing can remove it from you. Let all
[1:58:35] the devils of hell come. Let all the
[1:58:37] temptation come. You become anchored
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; because it's the same God. It's this
[1:58:45] same God.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; We don't just sing about him, but he is
[1:58:49] present with us.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; If you realize that, friends, so much of
[1:58:55] the prophet's ministry was spent on
[1:58:58] getting the people to try to believe.
[1:59:01] It's the same God was present
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; and he would say over and over and over
[1:59:05] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:59:07] and forever. And for so many of us, it's
[1:59:11] just a term. It's just a scripture in
[1:59:13] the Bible and it rolls off our lips so
[1:59:16] easily.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; It's much more than that.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced
[1:59:22] that as we and I would like as many as
[1:59:26] possible to join me.
[1:59:28] I'm seeking with everything that's in me
[1:59:30] to lay hold of he who's present with us
[1:59:34] now. And when I see what he did in the
[1:59:36] message, I say you're the same now. When
[1:59:38] I hear what he says in the word of God,
[1:59:40] I said you're the same one now. Whether
[1:59:42] you sat there or what you said there,
[1:59:44] you're the same now. You're operating
[1:59:46] the same. You're doing the same.
[1:59:47] Hallelujah. Nothing is impossible.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip some. I thought it was
[2:00:01] really outstanding when our brothers
[2:00:04] Zephaniah stood here and began to speak
[2:00:07] Friday night
[2:00:11] and he began on certainly not knowing
[2:00:14] what I was wanting to come to this
[2:00:15] morning. and he began and he spent
[2:00:18] that's why I'm not taking so much time
[2:00:19] with it. How the relationship of the
[2:00:22] soul and the spirit and and he and he
[2:00:24] talked about God pulling that resource
[2:00:26] down. I thought that's right on my
[2:00:29] notes. That's right here. That's what
[2:00:30] I'm speaking on. Thought how wonderful
[2:00:33] you are, Lord. You're just carrying the
[2:00:35] same theme straight through.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Says this this the true nature of your
[2:00:43] life
[2:00:46] the true nature of your life the true
[2:00:48] nature of your soul is a desire to live
[2:00:50] for God.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; I know that that is so that is your true
[2:00:54] nature.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; And he said your your spirit your soul
[2:01:00] is the nature.
[2:01:02] It's your soul is the nature of the
[2:01:04] spirit. He said, "And if your soul, if
[2:01:06] your nature craves for the things of the
[2:01:08] world, says then you're dead."
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; If it craves, because God can't crave
[2:01:12] for the things of the world. But your
[2:01:15] soul craves, the true nature, your true
[2:01:18] nature craves after God. Oh yes, you
[2:01:21] were in the world. You were tempted and
[2:01:22] you did this and you did that and you
[2:01:24] tried something else and you, you know,
[2:01:26] you you had this kind of friend and you
[2:01:28] engaged in in whatever more and you
[2:01:30] succumb to temptation. But that's not
[2:01:33] your true nature. And that's why God
[2:01:35] dealt with you. That's not your true
[2:01:36] nature. Your true nature is a hunger
[2:01:38] after God.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:01:50] I just want to take the next few minutes
[2:01:51] please
[2:01:53] for after the sovereign move of God then
[2:01:56] we build upon that
[2:01:59] spiritual and supernatural act. Uh my
[2:02:04] I'm going to
[2:02:07] I'm going to have you turn in your Bible
[2:02:08] if you would please to First Timothy the
[2:02:12] 4th chapter.
[2:02:23] I'm not going to keep you long because
[2:02:24] we want to give our time to the service
[2:02:27] tonight as well and you'll be refreshed
[2:02:30] this afternoon and have a little bit of
[2:02:32] nourishment and then come back and be
[2:02:34] ready for what our brother Zephaniah has
[2:02:38] on his heart as well. And I know God is
[2:02:41] really blessing him by seeing even
[2:02:44] what's been taking place.
[2:02:46] And when I make reference, I'm not going
[2:02:48] to I'm not going to belittle what God is
[2:02:52] doing. I'm going to magnify it before
[2:02:54] God.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; To me, it's marvelous. It's marvelous in
[2:02:58] our eyes. Hallelujah. And as we praise
[2:03:01] him for it, he'll just do more.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want him to do more, friends.
[2:03:05] Oh, we want him to do more.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; There's a number of points here, but I
[2:03:12] will just I'm going to be quick. Uh 1
[2:03:15] Timothy 4:12.
[2:03:17] Let no man despise thy youth. So I'm
[2:03:20] speaking largely to you young people
[2:03:22] now. Let no man despise your youth. The
[2:03:26] Apostle Paul speaking to Timothy who he
[2:03:29] called his son. But be thou an example
[2:03:34] of the believers
[2:03:37] in word,
[2:03:39] in conversation,
[2:03:42] in charity,
[2:03:44] in spirit, in faith, and in purity.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:50] you young people. Now, God is calling
[2:03:52] for you to be an example. You can even
[2:03:55] be an example to your parents.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; You can be an example and will be an
[2:04:01] example to your friends and your
[2:04:03] associates. That's right.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Now, one thing that is absolutely
[2:04:08] essential, that's number one, is you
[2:04:12] must make not just a clear decision in
[2:04:16] the house of God or in the tent or
[2:04:17] wherever. You must make a clear decision
[2:04:21] and a clear break from all the old
[2:04:24] lifestyle.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; You can't ease out and ease into God.
[2:04:30] God said to Abraham, Abram, and this is
[2:04:33] one of our best examples. He said,
[2:04:35] "Leave.
[2:04:36] Get up. Leave your kindred." And brother
[2:04:39] Brandham said he had to leave everybody.
[2:04:41] He had to leave those. He had to leave
[2:04:43] his comfort zone. He had to leave where
[2:04:46] he was comfortable and his life and his
[2:04:49] friends and his family. He had to be not
[2:04:52] only be willing, but he had to leave it.
[2:04:55] That's right.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; God
[2:04:58] not call you necessarily to leave your
[2:04:59] family because your call is different.
[2:05:02] But the call is the same. The call is
[2:05:06] you must be willing. Your unbelieving
[2:05:09] family cannot affect you.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; If you have unbelieving family, you say,
[2:05:15] "I am headed for the kingdom of God."
[2:05:18] You go whatever direction you need to
[2:05:19] go, but nothing can change my course.
[2:05:23] And when you make that kind of a
[2:05:25] decision, even the devil hears it.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; And say it
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; and keep saying it. Nothing can change
[2:05:32] my course. And the first thing is tell
[2:05:35] your friends.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben Dingwall, I enjoyed your
[2:05:39] testimony the other night. Would you
[2:05:41] just stand so people know who I'm
[2:05:42] speaking about? Brother Ben has to go
[2:05:44] back up home to Edmonton. God bless you,
[2:05:46] brother Ben. And God worked some
[2:05:48] marvelous things in his life. yet when
[2:05:50] he was still in Edmonton, this thing is
[2:05:52] not localized to this church or any
[2:05:54] other church up in Edmonton and God
[2:05:56] dealt with him and he came back and uh
[2:05:59] his father told me he had such a time
[2:06:02] with God and on his face before God and
[2:06:05] then I I I sat with him about an hour as
[2:06:08] he prayed and just giving himself and
[2:06:11] letting the Holy Spirit mold him. And I
[2:06:14] left him uh between so between 11
[2:06:16] o'clock and midnight at the tent. And
[2:06:18] when I left the tent at about midnight,
[2:06:21] there's still probably about 200 people
[2:06:22] in there of young people and I don't
[2:06:24] know, maybe more came back in. But
[2:06:26] brother brother Ben did what I believe
[2:06:29] in with all my heart. He went back to
[2:06:31] work
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; and uh his all his cronies and his
[2:06:35] friends and the buddies that he may go
[2:06:37] out and whatever do whatever with said,
[2:06:40] "Oh, hey, what'd you do on the weekend?"
[2:06:43] Said, "I went to a Bible camp." Bible
[2:06:46] camp.
[2:06:48] You know what' you do there? He said, "I
[2:06:50] gave my life to Christ."
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that with all my
[2:06:55] heart. That's the way to do it. A clear
[2:06:59] decision, but also a clear break.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Clearcut decision and a clear break. God
[2:07:06] loves that.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; And when he says jump, just jump.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't ask how high. Don't
[2:07:13] ask how far. Just do it. Amen. And when
[2:07:16] you're done with the world, let the
[2:07:18] devil know. Let your friends know and
[2:07:20] set the set the uh make the testimony
[2:07:23] clear and quick.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; And and brother Ben was telling me one
[2:07:28] of the hardest fellas who's there, I
[2:07:31] don't know whether he's had a life of
[2:07:32] crime or whatever more of all of the
[2:07:34] guys that are there,
[2:07:36] the hardest one hard case come says, "I
[2:07:41] admire you. I respect that."
[2:07:44] They know.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; And as I've said to even my own
[2:07:47] daughters when they were in high school,
[2:07:49] they might make fun of you. You know,
[2:07:50] there's always a there's power within a
[2:07:53] mob. And when they're around as a whole
[2:07:55] group, oh yeah, yeah, know. And they say
[2:07:57] all kinds of things about you and how
[2:07:59] you look and how you live and your
[2:08:00] church and what you live and all the
[2:08:02] rest of it. But as I said, and I believe
[2:08:04] it, and I know it's true, when they get
[2:08:06] home and they lay on their bed and they
[2:08:08] get in their room alone, they say, "I
[2:08:10] wish I could live that kind of life. I
[2:08:13] wish I could look like that.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; I wish I could have that godly
[2:08:17] appearance. I wish I had some sparkle in
[2:08:20] my eye. I And and and when they get
[2:08:22] there, they hate those habits. They
[2:08:25] despise those drugs, but they're a
[2:08:27] slave. And you're free.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're free. Oh, bless the
[2:08:34] Lord. Glory to God.
[2:08:38] Hallelujah. You're free.
[2:08:42] Glory to God.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; They admire it.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; They respect it. And so, number one, if
[2:08:51] you haven't done it already, do it as
[2:08:53] soon as you can. Make a clear break.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Let them know I'm a child of God.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; I believe an end time message
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; and Christ has come into my life. I told
[2:09:03] brother B, I just shared it with him.
[2:09:05] When I gave my life to Christ, I was
[2:09:07] about exactly the same age as he was. So
[2:09:09] reminded me and I went to some of my
[2:09:11] buddies, you know, I hunted with and
[2:09:14] they drank beer. I couldn't stand beers.
[2:09:15] I didn't drink their beer, but we'd be
[2:09:18] in their parties together, you know. And
[2:09:19] I came to them. I says,
[2:09:22] "I gave my life to Christ
[2:09:25] and I'm done."
[2:09:28] This fellow was a bookkeeper in my
[2:09:31] wife's dad's store.
[2:09:33] He pushed me on the shoulder says, "Ah,
[2:09:35] Biscll," he says, "I'll give you three
[2:09:38] weeks."
[2:09:40] You know, and he always make a joke of
[2:09:41] it, "Ah, Biscll, I'll give you three
[2:09:43] weeks." I never smiled. I said, "No,
[2:09:46] Chris, you'll never see me again. You'll
[2:09:49] never see me there again."
[2:09:52] Three weeks went by, three years went
[2:09:53] by, time went by. I was pastoring the
[2:09:56] little church in this place. Then I
[2:09:58] moved away and was doing do work,
[2:10:00] missionary work down here amongst the
[2:10:01] native Indian people. And I went back up
[2:10:04] to Dawson Creek just for a visit. And he
[2:10:06] had a he had a a a successful restaurant
[2:10:11] called Smitties. That was his
[2:10:12] restaurant, not the one you have here.
[2:10:15] And uh he was he was the sponsor for the
[2:10:18] local hockey team.
[2:10:21] And his boy, they weren't able to have
[2:10:24] children either. He adopted some boys
[2:10:25] and they were they they were native boys
[2:10:28] and they became very fine hockey
[2:10:30] players. He's going places. I walked
[2:10:33] into the restaurant. Hi Chris, how you
[2:10:36] doing?
[2:10:38] Well, he said, "You know that Luger
[2:10:40] pistol I have?" This is exactly the
[2:10:42] conversation. You know the Luger pistol
[2:10:44] I have? I said, "Yeah." He says, "I was
[2:10:46] up on Bear Mountain this summer and I
[2:10:50] put that pistol to my temple and my
[2:10:53] finger on the trigger."
[2:10:56] He said, "I came just that close to
[2:10:57] pulling it." He said, "That's where I've
[2:11:00] been.
[2:11:07] It been my joy
[2:11:10] to be with buildings full of native
[2:11:13] Indians
[2:11:14] praying with them and seeing God move.
[2:11:18] It been my joy to see the Holy Spirit to
[2:11:22] see Jesus Christ. It been my joy and I
[2:11:24] thought here's my friend. How Satan has
[2:11:27] robbed him. Do you think I have any kind
[2:11:29] feelings towards that devil? I despise
[2:11:31] him
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; with a holy hatred that he would take
[2:11:34] and rob him of that.
[2:11:37] And years later, many years later, my
[2:11:41] father-in-law passed away. And he was
[2:11:43] being his service was to be in the
[2:11:45] United Church of Canada up there cuz
[2:11:47] that's all he had known.
[2:11:51] We went up there and the pastor was a
[2:11:54] woman. I was feeling so I was feeling so
[2:11:58] disheartened after being here and my
[2:12:00] father-in-law who gave his life to
[2:12:02] Christ
[2:12:04] seven years ago.
[2:12:06] in in his senior years who God had
[2:12:09] healed so marvelously
[2:12:13] and the prophet of God said to my wife,
[2:12:16] "Your father will be all right." We had
[2:12:19] to commit him to God. But now, because
[2:12:21] that's the only church he'd ever been a
[2:12:23] member of, no message church there now.
[2:12:28] I thought this woman is going to be the
[2:12:31] take his service. I felt so bad. The
[2:12:33] girls were practicing a song, getting
[2:12:36] ready to sing a song in the funeral the
[2:12:38] next day. And I learned that the pastor,
[2:12:42] the woman had to come to Vancouver for a
[2:12:44] convention.
[2:12:46] She just happened to be down here. And
[2:12:49] there was an old man from England.
[2:12:52] They have a little chapel on Buckingham
[2:12:55] Palace grounds. And he's one of these
[2:12:58] kind of senior veterans and chaplain
[2:13:00] from the wars and so on. And there's a
[2:13:03] group of them and they travel out like I
[2:13:05] think PR man and so on but they live
[2:13:07] right on the Buckingham Palace grounds
[2:13:09] in England and he happened to be
[2:13:11] visiting over here in northern Canada
[2:13:13] was in this church that day and he's
[2:13:17] walking down the aisle with me and he's
[2:13:18] all kind of humped over you know going
[2:13:20] along and the girls are practicing. He
[2:13:22] says who are they? He says that's
[2:13:24] smashing. Absolutely smashing.
[2:13:28] real profound English statement.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Allan, doesn't that
[2:13:33] sounds right? Smashing.
[2:13:37] I said, "Well, they're they're my
[2:13:38] daughters." Oh, he said, "They're your
[2:13:41] daughters." Yeah. He said, "I heard that
[2:13:43] somebody in the relatives is a
[2:13:46] preacher." I said, "That's me." "You're
[2:13:48] the preacher?" He says, "You're the one
[2:13:50] to take the funeral. I didn't even know
[2:13:52] the old man. You take it."
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:56] that fast right from a woman taking it.
[2:13:59] I got to take my own father-in-law's
[2:14:01] funeral. Hallelujah.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; And I was up there preaching his funeral
[2:14:06] and look right down the middle aisle on
[2:14:09] the edge of the aisle sits Christopher
[2:14:13] Smith.
[2:14:15] The one who says, "Ah, I'll give you
[2:14:17] three weeks."
[2:14:19] And all these years later, I'm preaching
[2:14:22] under these miraculous conditions.
[2:14:26] went up to attend the funeral and I
[2:14:28] ended up preaching it.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Oh, God, one more time,
[2:14:34] one more opportunity to lay it in
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; and to preach a sermon to them about
[2:14:40] eternal life."
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; And I was able to tell them about the
[2:14:44] West Harper, my father, my
[2:14:46] father-in-law, that they did not know
[2:14:49] because in his senior years, he received
[2:14:51] Christ.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I shook hands with him. Said, "You
[2:14:56] almost got preaching."
[2:14:58] I thought, "Well, at least that was
[2:15:00] different than the first one. I'll give
[2:15:01] you three weeks."
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; You'll never be sorry
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; that you trusted his name. You'll never
[2:15:09] be sorry that you gave your life to him.
[2:15:12] You'll never be sorry. Glory. Glory to
[2:15:16] God.
[2:15:18] Live for him.
[2:15:22] And then he says,
[2:15:26] then he says,
[2:15:28] "Till I come."
[2:15:30] And I'd like to have you think Apostle
[2:15:32] Paul is here. I'm just echoing his
[2:15:35] words.
[2:15:37] Could you boys, could you young men,
[2:15:39] could you young ladies, could this
[2:15:41] congregation,
[2:15:43] could you give yourself to hear Apostle
[2:15:46] Paul
[2:15:48] till I come give attendance?
[2:15:51] And that attendance is to give earnest.
[2:15:54] You give give yourself give attendance
[2:15:58] to reading
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; to exhortation
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; and to doctrine.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm closing with this to give
[2:16:08] attendance if you take it in in Greek.
[2:16:11] What he's saying is lay hold of it
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; and take it to yourself
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; and make it your possession. I am a
[2:16:19] reader of the scriptures.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; I am a reader of the message. I give
[2:16:25] myself to reading for the purpose not
[2:16:27] saying I read a page to take it and make
[2:16:30] it your possession.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; And and and and you remember now what I
[2:16:34] started with this morning. So
[2:16:36] significant. Don't forget it when you
[2:16:37] leave here.
[2:16:40] That same one
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; who's speaking in that page
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; is the same one that was sitting on the
[2:16:47] well.
[2:16:48] and say, "Lord, I may not recognize it
[2:16:51] today, but speak to me. Let me just go
[2:16:54] slowly through this page. I give myself
[2:16:57] to reading. I give myself to exhortation
[2:17:02] and I give myself to doctrine." You know
[2:17:03] what exhortation is? You see another
[2:17:05] buddy, another friend. You see someone
[2:17:07] else who had really, you know, was just
[2:17:10] moving along so well and you see them
[2:17:12] come in a troubled time. I'm I'm I'm
[2:17:14] here for you.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; I'm here to help you. and you begin to
[2:17:18] exhort them.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Brother David, I appreciate your ex
[2:17:21] exhortation
[2:17:23] uh in the service.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; It was marvelous.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; And I had asked Brother David to come
[2:17:29] that Sunday night and just spoke to him
[2:17:31] on the phone. David doesn't know this,
[2:17:33] but he said something to me on the
[2:17:35] telephone that spoke to me very, very
[2:17:37] deeply. He said, "I decided
[2:17:41] instead of criticizing the young people,
[2:17:45] I was going to become proactive
[2:17:47] and I begin to invite them over to my
[2:17:49] home
[2:17:51] and have them there and have a barbecue
[2:17:53] or have whatever. Just invite them to my
[2:17:55] place and be proactive and create an
[2:17:58] environment." And brother David, you did
[2:18:00] do that
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; and God bless you for it
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; and we respect that. Hallelujah. And
[2:18:07] there's many here.
[2:18:13] My family,
[2:18:15] some of my family was there after Sunday
[2:18:18] night's service and they said we left at
[2:18:20] 2:30 in the morning. And they weren't
[2:18:22] talking any frivolity. Those young
[2:18:24] people were talking about what God had
[2:18:26] spoken to them and what message they
[2:18:28] were in and what they had just heard and
[2:18:31] the last tape they had been in and the
[2:18:33] last book that they had read. I tell you
[2:18:35] my friends, that's something you can't
[2:18:37] buy.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; You talk about criticize. I'd like to
[2:18:43] see the person stand in this building
[2:18:44] that I couldn't find something to
[2:18:46] criticize.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; We'll always have something to
[2:18:50] criticize.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; I'd like to see the church. You can't
[2:18:53] criticize. There's always something to
[2:18:55] criticize. But you who have the beam in
[2:18:58] your eye, cast that out first so you see
[2:19:01] more clearly to cast out the moat that's
[2:19:04] in the other brother's eye.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You talk about You talk
[2:19:10] about being enthused. I am absolutely
[2:19:13] I'm absolutely swept away with what's
[2:19:15] happening.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. There's ought to be a lot
[2:19:18] of parents and I know there are parents
[2:19:20] here who are thrilled and parents who
[2:19:23] have not seen their children here. Maybe
[2:19:25] they're out in the world. You say within
[2:19:27] yourself, the same God that called them,
[2:19:30] there's nothing with distance.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; There's nothing with distance.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; What does God know about distance?
[2:19:36] Nothing.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This same prophet, the Lord
[2:19:40] Jesus, speaking to him, say, you take
[2:19:41] that handkerchief, you're praying for
[2:19:43] somebody and he's away. He's your
[2:19:45] husband. He's in another town. You think
[2:19:47] God doesn't know about that son, that
[2:19:49] daughter, whoever they might be. God
[2:19:51] knows them.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you have the same faith that
[2:19:56] that brought salvation to you and hold
[2:19:58] that for them.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I'm going to close. We're
[2:20:11] not through, but I'm going to leave the
[2:20:12] rest for brother Zephaniah to say
[2:20:14] tonight. I know he's got
[2:20:17] he's got a message from God and God's
[2:20:19] been stirring his heart as well. But I
[2:20:22] want to lay down some practical things
[2:20:24] and I only gave you two now. You make a
[2:20:27] clean break. You make that make it known
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; to all of your friends, all of your
[2:20:33] peers. I think of my grandson Wesley and
[2:20:36] all of you know and young people, you
[2:20:37] know a whole lot more about him than
[2:20:39] perhaps I do. And he was headed he was
[2:20:41] headed for big trouble in the world. I
[2:20:44] don't mind saying, and I would say to
[2:20:46] his parents, he's a talented boy, but
[2:20:48] you've got to you've got to you've got
[2:20:50] to give some direction to those gifted
[2:20:52] talents because the devil's waiting for
[2:20:54] them.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; The world wants them.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; I deny that.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; And I was in Edmonton and he's sitting
[2:21:02] right over here and I saw his face just
[2:21:05] be stoned through the service
[2:21:09] and I knew it was the Holy Ghost.
[2:21:12] And there was no big emotional flare,
[2:21:14] nothing. Service was over. And he just
[2:21:16] came and stood like a man. He said,
[2:21:18] "Grandpa,
[2:21:20] I don't want any emotional thing. I
[2:21:21] don't want to be at the altar. I don't
[2:21:23] want I don't want to just have some, you
[2:21:25] know, some emotional experience." He
[2:21:27] said, I said, "God's dealing with you."
[2:21:29] Yes. He sat back down. I think I may
[2:21:32] have prayed with him. He was at a job
[2:21:35] over in Vancouver Island. I called him
[2:21:38] just to keep contact. I said, "Wesley,
[2:21:41] that's God dealing with you. Just hold
[2:21:44] that. Hold your course. Hold your
[2:21:46] course." And he came back here one
[2:21:49] service and God met him here in a
[2:21:51] wonderful way and he was done. Done with
[2:21:54] the world. Right over here in a place
[2:21:58] some of his friends wanted to meet him
[2:21:59] or something or he maybe went in there
[2:22:01] for lunch or something. Walked in.
[2:22:03] Here's a whole slew of his friends. I
[2:22:05] think there was 19 of them. Josh, a
[2:22:08] thing of you. All these friends,
[2:22:12] druggers, druggies and dope addicts. And
[2:22:15] he had some friends that were big
[2:22:17] pushers. He never got into it to my
[2:22:20] knowledge, but they were big- time
[2:22:21] pushers driving hot cars and more money
[2:22:24] than they had need of and from good
[2:22:26] homes. And these kids had super super
[2:22:30] very expensive cars. Here's all lined up
[2:22:33] and some girls there and all the rest of
[2:22:35] it. You can see the scene.
[2:22:38] He stepped up. He said, 'I'm not in this
[2:22:40] anymore, fellas. Oh, yeah. Come on. No.
[2:22:43] He said, 'I gave my life to Christ. I'm
[2:22:45] done. Oh, come on. You can't do that.
[2:22:48] So, the waitress comes around and says,
[2:22:50] I want a beer and I want a Heineken and
[2:22:52] I want a Bud Light and I want this and I
[2:22:54] want something else. They came to Wes.
[2:22:56] He says, "Ginger ale, please."
[2:22:59] They looked at each other said, "He has
[2:23:01] changed."
[2:23:03] He just drank his ginger ale down, got
[2:23:06] up, says, "Salom,
[2:23:09] so long, fellas. I'm out of my way. I'm
[2:23:11] out of here."
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; And that was the end of it.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; You think we're not rejoicing?
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, we are.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Let's have some music. Let's sing.
[2:23:33] Amen. I'm waiting for the musicians.
[2:23:36] I got to sing.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; I've never been sorry. I've got to sing
[2:23:42] it.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; Not too fast, but just so you get right
[2:23:45] in the rhythm of it. Amen.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; I've never been sorry
[2:23:55] since I trusted his name.
[2:23:59] Every moment I find him.
[2:24:02] Exactly the same.
[2:24:06] My soul has been saved
[2:24:09] since the Savior came.
[2:24:13] I've been sorry
[2:24:17] since I trusted his name.
[2:24:19] [Music]
[2:24:23] Is that up where it should be? Is that
[2:24:25] where we are?
[2:24:27] Ever since Jesus saved and pardoned, I
[2:24:31] have been singing every day. I've never
[2:24:34] been sorry.
[2:24:42] He is with me
[2:24:45] the awkward way. I never sorry.
[2:24:54] [Music]
[2:24:55] Praise the Lord.
[2:24:58] Holy name.
[2:25:04] [Music]
[2:25:19] All day long I sing the story
[2:25:23] for this wonderful
[2:25:26] story.
[2:25:32] Surely I know a holy way.
[2:25:36] [Music]
[2:25:38] I can't be sorry.
[2:25:40] [Music]
[2:25:44] I can't be sorry.
[2:25:50] Every moment I
[2:25:54] s
[2:25:55] [Music]
[2:25:57] my soul has been sing
[2:26:01] [Applause]
[2:26:03] I never sto
[2:26:09] [Music]
[2:26:13] my pathway right through my story
[2:26:18] that
[2:26:19] [Music]
[2:26:22] Never a god of sad refining. He's
[2:26:25] willing with me. This I know.
[2:26:30] Oh, praise God.
[2:26:33] Glory. I've never been sorry
[2:26:37] that I trust in his name.
[2:26:40] Everybody
[2:26:43] exactly the same.
[2:26:46] My soul has received
[2:26:49] since the Savior.
[2:26:52] I never
[2:26:55] [Music]
[2:26:59] he gave her water that was not in the
[2:27:01] well.
[2:27:02] [Music]
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You think I'm going to
[2:27:17] cut this rejoicing short?
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; No way.
[2:27:22] Jesus gave her water that was not in the
[2:27:26] well.
[2:27:28] Jesus gave her water and sent her forth
[2:27:32] to jail. She went away singing. Amen.
[2:27:37] Came back bringing
[2:27:40] others to the water that was not in the
[2:27:44] well. Oh Jesus gave her water that was
[2:27:49] not from the well.
[2:27:52] Jesus gave her water and sent her forth
[2:27:56] to tell. She went away singing and came
[2:28:02] back bringing
[2:28:04] others to the water that was not going
[2:28:08] to be well.
[2:28:10] Tell you if you're still thirsting this
[2:28:12] morning, there's a well here.
[2:28:15] [Music]
[2:28:17] and you'll never thirst again.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; You'll never thirst again.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Just come and drink.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; It's real, friends. This isn't just some
[2:28:30] excitement. This is real. We got lives
[2:28:32] here that have been totally turned
[2:28:34] around, transformed. And I'm so thankful
[2:28:37] because that's what I experienced. That
[2:28:40] same God from 50 years ago is the same
[2:28:43] God. Amen. All right, let's sing. He's
[2:28:46] the same God and then we're going to be
[2:28:48] dismissed.
[2:28:53] Same God.
[2:29:02] The same God
[2:29:04] is wonder.
[2:29:11] God
[2:29:14] the mighty red sea.
[2:29:20] Oh, he's the same God
[2:29:23] living
[2:29:25] in me. Oh,
[2:29:29] he's the same God.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; The woman at the well.
[2:29:38] The same God. I wonder
[2:29:44] who to tell
[2:29:46] the same God
[2:29:48] [Music]
[2:29:49] is the great
[2:29:53] sea.
[2:29:54] Oh yes, he's the same God
[2:29:59] living.
[2:30:02] Now when we sing it once again, remember
[2:30:04] he's the same God that did what he did
[2:30:06] for brother Claude Segment. The same God
[2:30:09] that did for brother Jim Hayes. Same God
[2:30:12] that did for my brother Jason, Sister
[2:30:15] Annie. Same God that done all these
[2:30:18] things. The same God, run Joshua, my
[2:30:20] brothers here. The same God, each one of
[2:30:24] you young men, don't you ever forget it.
[2:30:26] Don't ever forget it. That same God
[2:30:28] spoke to me in the 10 Birch Bay. Spoke
[2:30:30] to me in my church. He sat on a well one
[2:30:33] day and spoke to a woman. And what he
[2:30:35] did for her, he's doing for me. Take
[2:30:37] control of my spirit.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; Bring that word down into the realm of
[2:30:42] the soul.
[2:30:44] You'll never regret it.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:48] Hallelujah. We'll give him glory as we
[2:30:50] sing it once again. Oh, he's the same
[2:30:53] God.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; The woman at the well. Oh, he's the same
[2:31:02] God.
[2:31:03] [Music]
[2:31:04] Ready
[2:31:07] to tell
[2:31:09] the same God
[2:31:13] [Music]
[2:31:19] and he's the same God
[2:31:23] is dwelling in me.

[2:31:28] Brother Jared Harp, would you come
[2:31:29] Brother Jared? Ask God's blessing upon
[2:31:32] the congregation, upon the afternoon,
[2:31:35] and upon the evening service. Oh, we're
[2:31:38] so charged, friends. I don't have to
[2:31:40] tell you. I just so filled with
[2:31:42] expectation. I don't even know what's
[2:31:43] going to happen from day to day. But it
[2:31:46] doesn't have to happen right here in the
[2:31:47] service. God's not limited to these four
[2:31:50] walls. He's just going to continue on
[2:31:52] and on and on.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Jared, if you'd come,
[2:31:55] please. Amen.
[2:31:59] I have to give this note. There's a
[2:32:01] junior choir practice. Junior choir
[2:32:04] practice at 3 p.m. today, please, in the
[2:32:07] chapel. 3 p.m. today for junior choir.
[2:32:10] God bless you.
[2:32:13] Oh God, how happy we are tonight or this
[2:32:16] morning, Lord Jesus, to see you're
[2:32:19] moving again, Lord. Just a continuation,
[2:32:21] Lord. Oh God, how good it is to know
[2:32:24] that you're the same God, Lord Jesus.
[2:32:27] Oh God, you've spoken to me, Lord, three
[2:32:30] years ago at a camp, Lord Jesus. And
[2:32:33] God, it's the same, Lord. It's even
[2:32:35] better now, Lord Jesus. And I thank you,
[2:32:38] God, with all my heart, Lord. Blessed be
[2:32:41] your name this morning, God. Oh Lord,
[2:32:43] you're worthy, worthy, Jesus, of all
[2:32:46] praise and honor that we could give you,
[2:32:48] Lord, forever and ever, Lord. God, I
[2:32:51] thank you, Jesus. God, I thank you for
[2:32:54] Brother Ed, Lord, and for the burden he
[2:32:56] has for the young people, Lord. And God,
[2:32:58] we pray that you'll bless him, Lord, for
[2:33:00] his labor of love this morning, God. For
[2:33:03] brother Zephaniah tonight, Lord, we pray
[2:33:05] that whatever you'd have for us, Lord,
[2:33:07] that we would, God, be prepared in our
[2:33:10] hearts for the word tonight, Lord Jesus.
[2:33:12] And God, for the ones who be baptized
[2:33:15] tonight, Lord, we just pray the special
[2:33:17] something for them tonight also, Lord
[2:33:19] God. And God, we just thank you, Jesus,
[2:33:21] again, God. And we ask that you'll go
[2:33:23] with us, Lord, and bless us this
[2:33:25] afternoon, Lord, and be with us in our
[2:33:27] conversations, Lord. And whatever we do,
[2:33:29] Lord, we just want to give you all the
[2:33:31] glory and honor that you do, Lord Jesus.
[2:33:33] We thank you again in Jesus Christ's
[2:33:34] name. Amen.
