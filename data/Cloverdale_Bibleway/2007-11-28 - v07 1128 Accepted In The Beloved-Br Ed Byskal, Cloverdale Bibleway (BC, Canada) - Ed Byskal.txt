The littlest things we praise your name, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah to your name, Lord. Praise your name, Lord. In this presence, we're going to go to prayer and ask brother Tony. Believe you have a prayer request that you want to relate if you would come at this time. Give it. We don't have any prayer cloths up here, but if you have a need on our heart as brother Tony goes a prayer, just lift it to our Lord. Amen. We just want to rejoice with the saints in China that were released, the brothers when they heard that so many around the world have been praying for them. They just broke down and wept. Amen. It touches hearts and lives when we pray. We also would just invite you as uh on behalf of our family to join with us in prayer. Rebecca's sister, her older sister Shirley, her husband uh has been admitted to uh South Africa. They were in the country of Zambia for some mission work that they were filling in for and her husband Shirley's husband Lauren. He uh he's got an infection and it ended up causing an abscess upon his brain. And so he's in a very serious condition. There's an abscess there. They've done an operation a week ago and they had to take him in for another emergency operation uh just um about 6 hours ago. So you know how it is when one of your family members is suffering. We appreciate you joining our hearts together with us. Can we do that? Heavenly Father, we do live to worship you for you've done so much for us. Lord, we live our lives, Lord, sacrificing our own desires in order that we could worship you in the spirit of holiness and the way we live, the manner of conversation that we have, Lord, because of our love and our gratitude and our appreciation. Lord, for when we were vile, lost sinners living unto ourselves, Lord, you didn't look at our flesh. You didn't look at our weaknesses, our our faults and failings. You look beyond that to the lamb's book of life. Lord, there you saw our names written there in the lamb's blood. Hallelujah. And father, here we are tonight, Lord, your chosen bride. Here we are tonight, oh God, as as ones that have been on placed on earth in the ministry to stand in the gap, a ministry of reconciliation for those that are in need of salvation, in need of healing, in need of deliverance. And Lord, we bring our requests before you. And we ask abundantly that our joy may be full. For we know that you delight, Lord, in seeing your children blessed. We know that you, Lord, bore those stripes in your body in order that you could prove you're greater than sickness, greater than abscess, greater than cancer. Hallelujah. And so, Father, once again tonight, Lord, with the faith that you've given to us and Lord, recognizing and knowing who we are, we come boldly, Father, as your wife, as your bride, Lord, asking on behalf of those that are in need. And Lord, we have this need in our family. And Lord Jesus, we're asking, Lord, that whatever's been spoken, Lord, that it would be forgiven, Lord. whatever action that may have been taken, Lord, that might have been contrary to your word. Father, we pray for mercy, Lord, we stand, Lord, in the gap for Shirley and Lord, at this hour that you would move in a in a sovereign way in that hospital in Johannesburg, Lord, and move over that bed and Lord, bring a healing and a strength to his body. And Lord, more importantly than that, that there would be a recognition of your presence in this last days. Lord, for we realize the hour that we're living in and how short it is. And Lord, we're applying that token once again for our families tonight. And Lord, we know that there's many extended families in this assembly. And by way of internet that are listening tonight, we pray, Father, that you would move on our loved ones hearts. Move on those that are away from you, even in this assembly. And so, Father, we ask thy will to be done as we ask it according to thy word now. And father, as we turn our hearts to the word, Lord, that feeds our souls, that lifts us up in a heavenly places, Lord, may there just be a move of your spirit over our pastor tonight. Lord, may we just be elevated once again and leave this place, a a happier people, a a victorious people because of the word that has fed our souls. Bless the red tonight as we ask all these mercies in Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. You love the Lord. Praise God.

Your prayers gave us power. &gt;&gt; We had a wonderful time at Brother Donnie Reagan's church and congregation there and those that came in from many different places. We were really happy to to uh join with them. And at this Thanksgiving time, first time I've ever been there at Thanksgiving time. And some came from oh from Florida and different states around North Carolina and South Carolina, I guess, different places. We're just real happy to be with them. And it was nice to have some of our own congregation. Brother Ernie, Sister Katie were there and brother Hank. Amen. It was nice to see him. Brother Jake Dick came and and uh I was able for the first time probably in 20 years we I was able to have my daughters with us and uh that was very special and Dave uh also was able to be with Marilyn. So it was just very very special and uh you know it's uh when you when you raise a family it's it it is nice to get to be together once in a while and sometimes it's it's hard when everybody's kind of involved in the ministry one way or another. It's just difficult to get together, but it was was just really really nice and especially for uh I knew that you were praying and uh I knew that God was blessing also in the congregation. I already heard the church was packed Sunday morning and like nobody was away here. A few Sundays ago, I I happened to know that there was quite a few people away, probably as many as 20. And I thought, well, there'll be a little bit of room in the church. I I came to church and it was just absolutely squeezed tight. I thought, "Well, my where did all these people go?" I said something to someone. They said, "Well, it was just the people sitting in the fellowship room got into the sanctuary finally." So, God bless you for coming early and being here and for praying and and everything that's taking place. Thank you for your prayers for during the prayer meeting and for the young people and for what's taking place. and brother John Andy's been going through the seals with them and and I'm going to try to get in one of those meetings, brother John for sure. In January, as you suggested and and uh praying for the camp, the brothers that uh you may wonder what uh you know what took place. We made an announcement and brother Chris Peterson took their names and uh the names of all the people and he was you know quite persistent, you know, because I just stood up to see how he's doing. He says, "Well, write your name down." So, I was number 27. I haven't been out there yet, but I I keep getting the daily uh progress reports and said the brothers that have been out there just uh have been having a great time. I know, brother Jack, you were out there. They liked it. Some of the brothers liked it so well. I heard that they, you know, uh just made a nice wood fire and made them all comfortable and they said, "I think we'll just stay till tomorrow." And then they want to stay day after day. It must be good food and really a welcome spirit out there. So, you that have uh uh have uh put your name down, you're you're going to enjoy your time out there. And uh and we want to pray about that, too, because it's a spiritual it's a spiritual work. We're not there just, you know, for or uh uh you know, just to spend time, but it we we're looking forward to God using it. Amen. He can use your car. He can use your house. &gt;&gt; He can use everything. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. And he does. We're thankful to God for that. Uh I'm going to have you stand and I'd like to sing. We worship you in spirit and in truth. If you just lift up your voices and sing with me. I just feel like I'd like to worship him tonight. Wouldn't that be a good thing to do on Wednesday? Amen. [Music] We worship you in spirit and in truth. [Music] We worship you in spirit and in truth. We have heard your word and felt your presence. [Music] We worship you in spirit and in truth. We're going to sing it once again. And while we sing it, if you know it, you could just close your eyes and look up to him. If you feel like lifting your hand, that's fine. But above all things, let's lift up our hearts. Let's lift them up with yielding by yielding to the Holy Spirit. And the words which said, "And I felt your presence too." If we have not felt his presence, I'd suggest we ask, invite him tonight. Would you do that? Say, "Lord, let me sense and feel your presence. I invite you to come and minister to me personally. We're not here just to put in time, but we're here to hear something. Living word. Amen. Hallelujah. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. Let's just enter in now. We worship you. Yes, Lord. In spirit, in truth. Oh, hear us Lord. &gt;&gt; We worship you in spirit and we have heard your word and help your true. We worship you in spirit and in truth. Now with our heads and hearts bowed as we approach your word, oh loving father. You love your children. You have called us to this place. We have come to worship you in spirit and in truth. And we worship you now, Lord, by opening our hearts to your word. And let the Holy Spirit speak. Let the Holy Spirit be the minister tonight, oh God. Minister to my heart. Minister to every heart. And I pray, Father, those that may not be hungry, create within them a hunger. Create within us a thirst. Oh God, create within us that desire. May the desire be so intense. Let it be a flame burning embers within our soul, Lord God. And we want to let you know nothing can satisfy us in this world. We say take the whole world and give us Jesus. Give us the Lord Jesus. Oh, a living Christ, not a Christ of history, not a Jesus of history, but one that is now alive and resurrected amongst his people, Jesus Christ in bride form. I pray Lord you'll just let your anointing now Father flow through us and into us in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll have you uh turn in your Bibles if you would to Ephesians the first chapter. Very very common portion of scripture for those of us message believers. But it's wonderful words, precious words. uh uh in Ephesians 1, we're going to start at the third verse and just read down to verse seven. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself. self according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made uh wherein wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved, in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace. You know, we've read just a few verses. I don't know if you have ever marveled, but I have many, many times, frequently as I read the scripture and especially reading uh Apostle Paul's writings. They're not merely profound, but there's no excess words. They're so potent, just potent with life. And I marvel because how even God I know it's God speaking through a man but how God could get control of a man so he can be so precise with his thoughts and lay the word down like that. And I can tell you you can read these four or five verses which we read and there isn't any excess words. Every word is just absolutely pregnant with life. It's marvelous. God help us as we continue on this evening. You have your seats please. I want to take this phrase which I have pondered on many times and I felt inspired to it this week while I was away to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. And I would like to speak to you this evening. Uh and I trust that God will just help me and give me uh continuity of thought. I would like to speak on uh accepted in the beloved. Uh I thought on the subject this generation in particular, we are uh we are sometimes at least I feel almost bombarded by society itself with a pressure and an imposition placed upon us to accept what others uh what what they want to believe, how they want to live. And it's it it seems that they're not satisfied to simply go on, do your own thing, live your own life, but they're not satisfied with that. They want you to accept &gt;&gt; what they do, how they speak, how they live, how they conduct themselves, what their sexual orientation is or whatever else. They might want to believe some of the craziest things in the world, but they and I just say, "Go ahead and believe it. Go do your thing. live your life however you feel to do it. Just go your way, you know, leave me alone. But no, no, no. They want you to accept it. &gt;&gt; It's an age of acceptations. If that if that makes any sense to you, they want you to accept it. &gt;&gt; However, you know, however it is. and whatever whatever level of uh uh of life whatever level of of you know manner of life that that they have and I don't want to go into details with that because I want to move on from that but we are certainly in that kind of an age. I talked to a woman in the bank today and I I just passed this over the pulpit a few days ago, but I just said to her, I said, you know, if you think about things for a little bit, I said, you'll you'll find that they they know well about the church here and everything and the people here. But I said, if you think about things for just a wee bit and and let this thought distill for a moment, boil it down. I said you you'll find that uh uh the criminals today are really imposing their lifestyle upon the government to such an extent that the government write laws to accommodate them and you pay the bill. &gt;&gt; That's really what it is &gt;&gt; in a lot of ways. in a lot of ways and I could go into some details and you just find out that uh I I went to do a little bank transaction day and they said well we can't do that anymore and I and and I had just trying to do a little small bank transaction across the border and I I I I couldn't do it down there. They said no we've centralized we've centralized the whole thing. They said, you know, it's this it's this money laundering thing here. I'm trying to, you know, get a check uh on one side of the border and bring it on the other side of the border. Just a a a measily insignificant transaction, but it can't do it because it's all done now in some big central uh bank uh at head office and you we can't give you a cashier's check in Canadian funds. Uh none of the branches can do that anymore. you've got to uh so I had to speak to a uh one of the uh executives and say h how can I do this then? I just need this in Canadian funds and bring it back across the border and and uh put it in another account and a personal account and take it out into another kind of a a certified check and finally I got the thing took me a couple of hours to do something that would have taken about five minutes. So I talked to the girl in the bank and I said you know she said well you know it's all this money laundering thing. I said, "Isn't it amazing that the these guys that are these criminals are imposing upon you to write laws that make it so hard for us citizens to live and all these drug dealers and all these pot growers are causing the government to write laws and impose uh and confine us and restrict us and also make us pay the bill. &gt;&gt; We have to pay the bill." So, in essence, they're writing the law. They're telling the politicians what to say. And yet on the other hand, they want to be accepted. They want you not only pay the bill, they want you to accept it. This is the way it's going to be. Well, I can tell you that is exactly the way it's going to be because that's how the world is going to go. It's going to go that direction. That has very little to do with my message, but I thought I'd just throw that out. There's something uh within I say the human psyche that wants to be accepted. We we we feel we need identification. Young people do. They want to be and and if a person's not accepted or is denied being accepted, it's a hardship. You believe it or not, it is a hardship. Some people say, "I'm a loner. It doesn't mean a thing to me." Oh, yeah. No, no. I know some of those people that are loners. They they want they need to be identified with somebody more than anyone else. They need to be identified with somebody. They want to be identified with somebody, some group or something. And there's always uh uh there's always something that uh attracts people to, you know, they get into the big crowd, whether it's a sports crowd or whether it's a religious crowd. But people, there's something within the human frame, a human inner person that needs to be accepted. Now, there's a key phrase here that I want to uh uh start my message by dwelling on this for just a moment. And it says that hath he hath made made us accepted in and that little word two-letter word in the beloved is a key word. He hath made us accepted in the beloved. Outside of that there's no assurance of being accepted but in the beloved. And the little word in which you may, you know, you may feel that you you well know it and that this is a a very elementary Sunday school class, but it's really not because the word in it speaks of or denotes that the object, now we're speaking about you as the object is surrounded by or included in a specific place and that you are enveloped or you are restrained by certain limits. And anyone that's in Christ is enveloped and restrained or constrained by certain limits. There are things that we can't do. Not because not because God is saying you can't do it, but because we don't have a desire to do it because we are we have certain constraints. We have certain limitations and those come to us because of the mere fact that we are living in we are living in Christ and Christ is the word and the word isn't thou shalt thou shalt not. Brother Brandham goes into his marriage relationship and refers to uh his own relationship with his wife. And when he goes overseas, she doesn't grab him by the tie and tell him what to do. And he doesn't tell her, you know, what to do. He doesn't have to point to some, you know, piece of paper on the wall, say, "We're married and you have to live a certain way." That's he said, "That'd be a terrible marriage." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That wouldn't be right at all. But because they're being dictated to, in other words, he says, "I fear my wife." He said in other place, he fears them. He has a certain not a fear of being a scared, but a fear of of the sanctity of the marriage union. There's a sanctity to it. And so, there are certain restraints. There are certain restraints of us living in Christ. And we're not only constrained of you can't, you can. That's not the point. The point is I'm glad for those constraints. I'm glad for that because it actually is our security. It's a place of safety, which I we'll dwell on in a few moments. But being accepted in Christ refers to also a certain sphere of activity. We're in a certain place of activity. We're not idle. We're not motionless. We're not atrophied. So, we can't do anything. But this is our realm of activity. We're in Christ and that's how we move and have our being because we're we're in a we're in a dynamic place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just came from a special meeting. I kind of thought that I would have some amens here this evening. &gt;&gt; You want to say scum to the pastor? This is a sphere of activity or within a certain realm of influence that's being in. So, we're accepted in I want to go over this. We're accepted in a place where we have a where a place of of security. We're accepted in a place of protection. We're accepted in a place a realm of activity and also a realm of constraint. We there are there are just things that we ourselves choose not to do or other things we choose to do. We choose we choose to once God has revealed himself, we choose to yield. You know, God's not going to force you to yield. We're the ones that yield. &gt;&gt; We do the yielding. &gt;&gt; God sends his spirit in upon us, but we do the yielding to that spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. He does the revealing of his word and we open our hearts. Amen. I'm glad there is something that we can at least contribute &gt;&gt; to it. Now the first Eve because we do believe ourselves as the bride of Jesus Christ. I thought of the first Eve. She was blessed in a very special way when she really wasn't aware of it. She was blessed when she was in Adam because the Bible says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. And God blessed them." Plural. God blessed them. Eve was blessed while she was yet in Adam. &gt;&gt; She had not been separated, but she was blessed. And he said unto them, plural, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." Eve was blessed in Adam, &gt;&gt; and that's where we are blessed. &gt;&gt; Eve was sealed in Adam. Hallelujah. Eve was protected in Adam. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Eve was sinless in Adam. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was a blessed place for her to be was in Adam. &gt;&gt; The first Eve and the second Eve is in Adam. &gt;&gt; And we are sinless in Adam. &gt;&gt; We are protected in Adam. &gt;&gt; We are secure in Adam. Hallelujah. Glory to God. What a blessed place. And we are blessed in Adam and on my message tonight. And we are accepted in Adam. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're accepted. Not we will be. We are accepted in him now. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the place that God intended for his children. And these are the these are the uh words which I just want to uh dwell on momentarily. He said he blessed them. To be blessed actually in the Hebrew is to be adored. He said be fruitful. That's branch off cause to bear fruit, multiply, become great, to become many, and to increase in growth. These are the words that God used. Replenish. Replenish the earth fullness. Come to abundance. Be satisfied. to be accomplished something. Isn't it wonderful? People today strive for fulfillment. Oh, I'm just looking for fulfillment. But only a believer can come to that place of real contentment, satisfying uh the the satisfaction of the soul. We're content in Christ. We don't have to be anxious and, you know, be frightful. We don't need that. &gt;&gt; Amen. replenish the earth to be in fullness or abundance and subdue it to keep to keep under to make subservient to be subject and he said to have dominion and that's simply to have to rule. You're blessed, be fruitful, multiply, replenish, subdue, and have dominion. That's a blessed place. I tell you what, if we can just participate in all of those &gt;&gt; and and God didn't speak that back there just because he had nothing to say. God was reflecting straight through to this time. And the prophet of God said, "Everything that the first Adam lost, the second Adam has brought it back." &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? You accept that? &gt;&gt; And we're accepted in the beloved and we are called upon. We're to have back in the and that's why in the breach before even coming to the seals he's coming especially to that place everything that Adam lost everything the first Adam lost everything and the fellowship &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; we've got it back &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; it's accessible to you &gt;&gt; don't let the devil tell you anything other than the truth &gt;&gt; the truth is spoken the prophet of God spoke the truth and Anything contrary to it is a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have to earn it or try to get it back somehow. It's been given back. So the blessing was placed on this state of complete oneness because now Eve is is in Adam and the blessing was placed while she was in that state of complete and total oneness. I just put down here in my notes because this is what I felt in the inner in my inner self that I've been deeply moved by the thought of being one with the word. I've asked myself, we've got the message. It it's it's been it's so wonderful. I have such an insatiable desire to see that others are blessed with this message. And that's why I'm I'm so thrilled with what takes place overseas and in missions and so on because I just I like to feel, oh, if they have an opportunity to be blessed like I've been blessed with that word, I'd be so thrilled with that. And that that just is a craving within my own heart to see someone else. We look out over the congregation. I I just trust you're able to feed on that word and be strengthened by that word and wash by that word. Don't leave it on the shelves, but it just let it flow over you and wash over you. Wave after wave after wave and God will quicken something to you. You might live on that for days. &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful it is. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful word we have. &gt;&gt; And I and I I I contemplated and thought much about you, Lord, I just want to be one. How do I get to be one with the word? H how what is it that I need to do to be one to be completely united like in a marriage union? I just want to be one with with Christ. Not something that we just say but something that is practical in our lives and actually happens. And I I feel that we need to uh in order for me to do that and that's what I'm conveying to you tonight is is you just live in it. You ponder it. You think about it. You lay down resting and you think about it and you sit up and you're thinking about it and you're in your car and maybe you hear a little bit of a a message, a tape or whatever more. If you're just in your quiet time, you're thinking about it. Yeah. You're you're pondering it and you let that word and while I was away, I was speaking to the people about the on the subject of the anointing which I spoke here about three services and I just thought of the the the anointed the the word itself is anointed. That is that's the very breath of God. Let that breath of God breathe on you. Tomorrow, tonight, and the next week. Just let it breathe on you. It's the anointing being poured into you. You don't know when you're going to need it. You ate food today. You don't know when you're going to need that food. You don't know it might be fighting off. Some infection right now or some other some contrary cells might be fighting it off. You have no knowledge of it. You have no feeling about it. You don't feel good. you don't feel bad but the food that you eat the thing that you take on and we eat uh you know sensibly and healthy it it it is doing something in our system we we don't know about it but and you hear the word you take it in you absorb it you let it penetrate you ponder it drops into your soul you don't know what it's doing all the time but it's fighting off &gt;&gt; Hallelujah giving you victory &gt;&gt; fighting off the enemy waring against doubt and fear and waring against criticism and waring against all these things. And people say, "I have low self-esteem." Take on the word and it'll it'll fight that thing off. &gt;&gt; I just feel twisted up inside. Take on the word. Let it wash over you. Become one with it. Hallelujah. Ponder this tonight. Accept it in the beloved. Accept it in the beloved. Isn't it wonderful to be accepted? I thought of the ultimate rejection and even while you know sometimes the little things happen in in the day and in your normal life I was just coming out of a parking lot and I thought coming home well I'll just pay this ticket ahead of time I'll just so I I put my parking card in the machine says denied I don't like that. Try it again. Denied. Again, denied. Well, I'll have to get a human being then. If the machine's going to deny me, get a human being and hope they don't deny me. But the ultimate denial said, "Oh, we felt anointed. We we sang. We worshiped. We we went to church. We paid tithes. We prayed. We saw great things happen. We prophesied all these things." Then to here, depart. &gt;&gt; I never knew you. &gt;&gt; I came to church tonight. I said, God, don't let one person &gt;&gt; sitting in our congregation tonight ever have to hear those words. &gt;&gt; You want to say tonight, you know, one thing, you might not you might not have to believe everything I say, but you have to believe everything Jesus said. And as sure as there's breath in your lungs, that's going to happen. &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. There's going to be people just like yourself who love their children, who love their husbands and wives, who had happy times and sorrowful times. There's going to be people just like you going to hear those words, &gt;&gt; depart from me. The ultimate denial, the ultimate rejection, and the one where there's no recourse. I say, "Oh God, let us not waste any time. We're the people of all people on the earth. You have been given something that multitudes, millions of others have never tasted." &gt;&gt; How we ought to rejoice tonight. How we ought to be able to just take and even stand and say, "Oh God, how privileged I am to be accepted in the beloved." &gt;&gt; What a privileged people we are. &gt;&gt; And it shall never take and become common place to us. &gt;&gt; Oh God, how we love you. &gt;&gt; I'm challenged to maintain &gt;&gt; and not let the enemy take it from me to maintain this place of oneness. I'm challenged to that. How to achieve and maintain it is a real challenge. And I say long after this service, after you've gone, day after day, I want you to think about it. If brother Ed was challenged, he wants to be one with that word. It's not enough just to say, "Well, I am one with the word." That's good. That's a good confession. But we want to be able to say, "Oh, God, I'm striving for that oneness. I don't want anything to affect it. I want anything to separate. I don't want anything to cloud this relationship &gt;&gt; because this is a marriage, you know. You that are married, you know that we as partners, we walk softly. We need to &gt;&gt; because all kinds of things can come in and afflict. It's the most perfect relationship. &gt;&gt; And you can even become accustomed to something less than what it should be. &gt;&gt; And I say we should not do that. We should not allow that. &gt;&gt; Now it got quiet, but you ought to say amen again. So, I'm going to confess that God intended I should have a wonderful relationship here on this earth. And God, make me what I need to be. Make my partner what they need to be, my husband, my wife. Make us what we need to be so we can be uh not only one and have our wonderful relationship, but we can be an example to others, a strength to others. &gt;&gt; Only the grace of God can sustain us and sustain our spirit and our resolve and our dedication to our position in Christ. I'm dedicated. We want to be forcefully resolved. Dedicated to this place in Christ. &gt;&gt; Might be here as a young person, unmarried person, which is fine. Single person is no less has no less meaning to you. Don't let the enemy distract or take something away from you that belongs to you. That is something that I'm so so consumed with. In the message of oneness, brother Brandon said that God's purpose, he said that's God's purpose. And his purpose as father, as father supreme, was to be one with his family. That was his purpose as father supreme to be one with his family, his earthly family, Adam and Eve. And the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them. &gt;&gt; Do you hear that? We need his nature &gt;&gt; in us. Oh, how I need that. So that made them with God's nature in them. Then with each other and God, they became all one. He said, "And isn't that a beautiful picture?" And I say, "Yes, brother Brandham. That's a beautiful picture, and it's a picture I desire that I might possess and have. God in his family, father over all, supreme, no death, no sorrow, no heartaches, no nothing. Just joy unspeakable. Never to be sick. Never to have a heartache. Just one with God. What a picture. The place of blessing for the believer is in Christ. As I said a few moments ago, Eve was sealed. She was safe. She was secure in Adam. And the blessing on her was irrevocable. God would not take it back. He blessed them and he wouldn't take that blessing back. He's blessed the bride of Jesus Christ in Christ and he won't take it back. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Not going to change his mind. Say, "Oh, maybe I, you know, maybe I should uh re-speak that or rethink that." No, it's it it's irvocable. He's just declared it and that's all it is. &gt;&gt; Blessed are they in Christ, &gt;&gt; accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just hang on because I want to go a little bit further. &gt;&gt; It's important to understand also that both man and woman's place is in Christ. Both man and woman. It's not enough for the woman to say, "Oh, let's my husband needs to do it." Or, you know, no. And and for every person, we all have to have that individual relationship of being in Christ. Okay, you say how how am I in Christ? Well, perhaps I can't give you the fullest and the most complete. But I say one thing, one of the one of the first things I would tell you is what I've already alluded to this evening, and that is a steady diet. I could look at a at a beautiful Thanksgiving turkey dinner or Christmas dinner or whatever more beautiful prepared dinner. I can just look at it, figure out now scientifically, how can I be one with this dinner? How am I going to be one with this turkey? How's it going to work? And what's it going to do? And get all the theology of it. Forget the theology. Just eat it. &gt;&gt; Just dive into it. &gt;&gt; Just start eating it and taking it down and thinking about it and reading it and pondering it and memorize it and say it over and over. When you get into something, say, "I find that hard to I find it hard to comprehend." Just say it again. Keep saying it again. And finally, it'll come into you. Hallelujah. And the prophet said, "How many times?" Say it until you believe it. Just say it and ponder it. That's the That's the best advice I can give you of becoming one with it. &gt;&gt; And it works. &gt;&gt; It absolutely works. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you think enough about him, you won't have time to think about all the negative things and all the trouble and all the problems. &gt;&gt; If you got any questions, just think about the word. Think about the message. Take it in. And the questions, believe it or not, the questions will get answered. &gt;&gt; You got burdens. &gt;&gt; If you haven't, come my way. And I'll give you a few. We got lots of things to be burdened about, but the best way to remain energized. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Had people come to me and I, you know, so once in a while you say something personal, say, I've been preaching, you know, my wife is here and we've been married 53 years. And and somebody came up says, you've been married 53 years. You just preached like a young man. I was so glad. I felt better about being a young man almost and being married 53 years. &gt;&gt; My wife knows what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to just feel that supernatural &gt;&gt; energy. You don't have to put it on. It's it's just there. It's part of the word. &gt;&gt; Say, where does it come from? Where does the enthusiasm come? Comes right out of the message, sir. &gt;&gt; I can't I can't read the message and feel depressed. If you feel depressed, take on the word. &gt;&gt; Eat it. &gt;&gt; Not eat the turkey. Eat the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Eat the lamb. Just keep eating on it. &gt;&gt; You'll be surprised what it'll do for you. You'll be surprised what it'll do for this congregation. Every answer, Christ is the answer. Christ is the word &gt;&gt; and we are accepted. You're accepted in him. &gt;&gt; God won't take it back. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. See, brother Ryan saying, "Amen." And brother Ryan flew all all night to come down to Tennessee and play the piano. It was wonderful, Brother Ryan. I'm sure proud of you. Thank you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just keep saying amen. I'll look your way every once in a while. &gt;&gt; I just like the thought of being sealed in him. &gt;&gt; Oh, it just feels so good. &gt;&gt; Just sealed. I'm secure. Take that, devil. &gt;&gt; Take that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take that old negative thing. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You hear all kinds of things when after I've got all loaded with all kinds of negative things, I just like to think about being sealed in him, being accepted in him. Tell the devil, you can't do anything with me. I'm untouchable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm in the second Adam. &gt;&gt; That's not just some hype. That's the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Believe it and you'll enjoy it. Don't believe it. You'll stay where you're at. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't want to stay where you're at, do you? &gt;&gt; Oh, good. Good. Then I'm preaching to the right crowd. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. In uh in Corinthians, Paul said this, "Be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ." &gt;&gt; That's what we all need to say. Parents need to say that to children. &gt;&gt; Amen. Follow me. &gt;&gt; Mothers need to say that to their children, to their daughters. &gt;&gt; Husbands need to say it to their wives and their family. &gt;&gt; Follow me as I follow Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a fine line, so I'll I'll just get off it. You might be called to be a housewife. Brother Brandham says in the great warrior David, you might be called to be a housewife. How many housewives have we got? You're called to be a housewife, but you got a position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, you might think that that's hard. You got a position. If you're washing pans or washing clothes or serving your family or serving your husband, you've got a position is in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not just talking about some, you know, uh uh how to live a better life. Here's a prophet saying, "You got your position in Christ Jesus by the Holy Ghost." And he said, "Amen." You're just as much David as the rest of them was. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Accepted. Acceptance is expressed in a number of ways in the Bible. It's expressed a number of ways. And I got thinking uh you know I made this very personal thought. How do I know I'm accepted? You might say, "Oh, brother brother Ed, you're up there. You're pastor. You know you're accepted." Well, no. I like to ask myself that question. You know, I just read it. It's a phrase. How do I know I'm accepted? Everybody thinks they're accepted. All kinds of people. So, I I I I bring it right down to ground zero. I say, "Well, number one, I got a message. &gt;&gt; And number two, that message was brought by a vindicated prophet." And he did things that no man has done worldwide around the globe since Adam. &gt;&gt; You can't find if you've got it in a history book. I'd like to see it and I want to see the evidence of it. I want to hear it on tape. I want to hear the evidence. You say, "Well, it was before tape." Well, we'd have to have just a absolutely qualified evidence that this happened. And and isn't it amazing that all these hundreds of people and even thousands that I've met and and thousands and thousands of unbelievers, people that don't believe this message and actually hate this message but can't dig up any evidence that even is compares with it. &gt;&gt; So that's why we have a reason to believe what we're believing. It's a supernatural gospel. &gt;&gt; God did something for us and gave us a heart to believe it. &gt;&gt; It's never happened. If it's happened, let's see it. As I was saying in brother Donny's church of people of you know uh somebody in Yugoslavia when we were there brother Milco you and I and and I was preaching there in a little church and and a Baptist church and uh a man came up he's from from the United States someplace and he came up and I was putting forward the message and how God sent brother Brandham as a messenger and a prophet messenger. This fell came up and he says, well, well, he says, I believe that Jimmy Swagger's carrying the ball now. I wonder if he believes that today. Respectfully, people who thought and came under the influence of others that thought they really carrying the ball found out they fumbled the ball &gt;&gt; badly, &gt;&gt; badly. But we're following a message and a messenger that never fumbled the ball. He packed it. He packed it across the goal line and won a and and won a a a great victory for Christ. Can you not say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I don't know what that man achieved in Yugoslavia, but I'm glad for the message the way it is today in the in the many countries that came out of the former Yugoslavia. and some I was in a I was in a a motel down there in some meetings and they've got a TBN I think it is uh Trinity Broadcasting or something once a while like to see you know what are these fellas saying turn it on believe it or not this exactly what it was a man and a woman sitting there like Hollywood style you know like these television programs they were ministers and he looks right at the camera he says you know right now and he says to his wife, you know, right now, he said, you just feel something. There's somebody in Texas, he said, has got a pain in their knee. And I said, oh my god, how can anybody believe that? Almost everybody in Texas got a pain in their knee. And and and they go on like that and try to sell that to people as something supernatural. No wonder the world mocks. says they tried to build a tower and didn't have sufficient to build it. But my brother, my sister, that never happened in this message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got an absolute. &gt;&gt; Never once had to say, "Oh, I'm sorry. I have to take that back." We got a word. A word that's clear. A word that's supernatural. A word with power. A word that's cleansing. A word that will give you security and assurance. We're sealed in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There isn't a thing that you and I can face in this life or this generation, but what God has has more than given us the uh uh the power within. The Bible says, now I must go along quickly. The Bible says, well, first let me just back up just a wee bit. I said acceptance comes and it's expressed in a number of ways and one of the ways is when God calls and I think that's very important because I don't think you people would be here on a Wednesday evening if you hadn't felt at some point in time the call of God upon your life. Now a lot of people, multitudes, millions have perhaps felt and heard a call of God and they would say so. But I if it's a call of God, then I believe that God will direct that person to the voice &gt;&gt; to achieve what the call was all about. &gt;&gt; Samuel was a boy, 12. I understand. Just a boy like some of you lads here in the front seat. 12 years old he was. And he heard his name called Samuel. Samuel. He goes out to Eli. Eli sends him back. I didn't call you. He thought Eli was calling him Samuel. And the call kept coming. But what the point I want to make with you tonight, he had already been accepted as God's prophet even though he was a lad at at a lad hearing the call. In other words, hearing the call is evidence that a person hearing the call. When the elect hear the call, you're already been accepted &gt;&gt; even though you don't know it. Apostle Paul on the way to Damascus heard the call. He heard his name. Saul soul, why persecutest thou me? He was already accepted as a prophet or as a apostle to the Gentiles already accepted. &gt;&gt; My news to you tonight is when you heard the call, go back in your life when you heard the call, you're already accepted. &gt;&gt; If you're here tonight and you haven't heard that call, or maybe you have heard the call, but you haven't said what some of these people have said, "Here am I, Lord." Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah said, "Send me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Brother Brandham was young, a boy, just young, and God was calling him, look what he was calling him to. And there he is packing water for his dad's alcohol system, &gt;&gt; making whiskey, &gt;&gt; and he's carrying water, but he hears a call. He hears a voice. He He hears something. And to him, it's strange. It even carries on him to into his married life. But it was a call of God and he didn't know where it was going to take him. He didn't understand it. But let me tell you when the call came, see I say God indicates his acceptance in a number of ways. And one of the main ways is he calls the individual. And when God calls the elect, there's no turning back. I haven't got time to go into that in as deep as I would like to. But then the Bible speaks of Christ and I want to come to this beloved one. If you just give me your attention for another about 15 minutes and I'm going to close. And there came a voice from heaven saying, "Thou art my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased." And in uh Luke's gospel 3 and22 it says and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him in a voice from heaven which said thou art my beloved son. In thee I'm well pleased. You're not just my son. You're my beloved son. And the apostle Paul has picked that up and he says you are accepted in the beloved. Not you're just accepted in the son, but you're accepted in the beloved son. Apostle Paul is picking something up here. There's a special a special relationship that God is is giving uh audible declaration on earth. You are my beloved son. This is my beloved son. Hear ye him. No wonder, no wonder God's messenger in this day would say and even title messages, hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. This is my beloved son. And brother Brandham put it in whom in whom I dwell. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you've been accepted in that son. I want to dwell on that. That's a blessed thing. And we ought to give thanks to God tonight. Oh God, that you put me. We could say, well, thank you that we have this place. It's comfortable and I've got a nice seat to sit on. That's just that that doesn't amount to anything. But when we can say, I've come into a special place. &gt;&gt; God has brought me into a special place. Into his beloved son, someone who he's looked on. Now think about this, please. When God looked on Adam, God knew that Eve was in him. God also knew that Adam could not create Eve. He'd only go to sleep and God would do the act of taking Eve from him. But when God looked on Christ, he didn't only know that Christ, that Eve, the second Eve, he didn't only see you and I in him follow this God's infinite. He knew that this son was going to be obedient. He's going to take every step. He knew that he would go to the cross willingly. And at the at Calvary, he's going to pay for the woman that was in him. &gt;&gt; Are you following that? &gt;&gt; And he knew further because he was the word. And that was the word that had come out of the logos in the beginning. At some at some I can't even say a point in time because there was no time. But in that great eternity, the prophet said he'd take a little journey and a little light came out from that from from that being. little light, little white light came out. There was a logos and that logos was the word said in another place. It was the sun. It was the son of God that came out. It was that it was the logos. It was that word that and by that force he was going to create everything. So in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says all things were made by him and without him was nothing made that is made. And so here's this here's this one now is on earth. This one by whom and the God that was in him that he was the very word the word now was made flesh. And by that word everything was created that had been created but in him was a bride that had not yet been created. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when God said, "This is my beloved son," he knew that that son also was going to speak some more words. Hallelujah. And the spirit that was in him was going to come into his chosen ones, his apostles, and they would speak, and God would bring forth by creative power &gt;&gt; a bride. He'd create you. &gt;&gt; He'd create me. He created this body of people by that which was in Christ when he looked on him and said beloved son &gt;&gt; and that's why the apostle Paul said we are accepted in the beloved actually we've been created by the beloved &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; why don't we loosen up and give the Lord a clap offer been created in the beloved We are loved by the beloved. &gt;&gt; You have been created. &gt;&gt; You've been made. It's &gt;&gt; why he said he made us accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Feel like preaching. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why God looked on him. It wasn't just Jesus of Nazareth, but it was all that was in him. And the prophet of God said clearly over and over and over, you were in him. &gt;&gt; So you were in him at Calvary. &gt;&gt; You were in him. &gt;&gt; You lived with him. You died with him. But you were in him when God looked on him and said, "My beloved son. &gt;&gt; You were in him then. I was in him. You were in him." And all that he was, you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he poured everything into Christ. and from Christ poured everything into the church. &gt;&gt; Beloved, &gt;&gt; can't have a beloved son without having a beloved wife. &gt;&gt; She's beloved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why he had joy in his heart to give his life for her. &gt;&gt; Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it. Hallelujah. When God made this audible declaration, he saw us in his beloved son. And this son by whom all things were created. In him was life, the scripture says, and the life was the light of all men. He was the word before he was flesh, was he not? And we were in him in word form before the word became flesh. John 1 and4 in him was life and the life was the light of man. John 1 and3 and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. You were made by him &gt;&gt; and for him. &gt;&gt; Your mother and father in the natural birth brought you forth. But don't put too much emphasis on that. &gt;&gt; That's not the important part of this. They were just instruments to bring forth a body in whom God would dwell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God didn't reveal himself to you in your flesh, in just your mortal ears. God revealed himself to you in your soul. Hallelujah. Your spirit was quickened. It was so all-encompassing that you couldn't even tell what part of you it your whole being was just gripped by the revelation of God's word &gt;&gt; and the light that went on in your soul. &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he does that. He does that and did that because she's beloved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said and show us the father. He said, "Look at the beginning there." He said, "I see this great space yonder and then the logos went out of God which was Christ." I'm not repeating. I'm just giving I speak preach it and then I back up and and give the quote so you know just how it's worded. He said, "And the logos went out from God which was the Christ, the anointing that went out and we're standing on the banister watching the creation come into existence and see whether he was the son." Now in the Hebrew series chapter 1, the logos and this great fountain, this great fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end, this great spirit began to form in the creation. And the logos that went out uh from it was the son of God. It was the only visible form that this spirit had and it was a theophony which means a body and this body was like a man. And he goes on to describe it. I tell you what, friends, I say never a man speak like this man. &gt;&gt; May be more eloquent people, but as far as I'm concerned, there isn't any more eloquent words &gt;&gt; because those eloquent people don't somehow include you and grip you and bring you into the picture. What this prophet of God said brings a people into the picture and he identifies who they are. They're the bride of Jesus Christ. spotless, virtuous, bride of Jesus Christ. She's accepted in the beloved, &gt;&gt; the beloved one, sending out the words of his creative power, creating his own bride. I only have about six minutes and I've got a ways to go, but I'm I'm not going to be long. But this is a if you want to read it, you want to read it at home. It's a leodyian church age. It's in chapter 9 and it's a 336 page 336 of the church age book and and this is so outstanding. He says, "And now he is standing." He's speaking of him standing amongst the the candlestick. He said, "And now he's standing in the midst of the church." As he stands there revealing who he is in the last age. When he begins to reveal himself, whoever he's revealing himself personally is accepted &gt;&gt; in him. &gt;&gt; He's revealing himself personally to the individuals that's accepted in him &gt;&gt; and he's revealing himself in the last days. He calls himself the author uh of the creation of God. This is another creation. This has this has to do with the church. This is a special designation of himself. He is the creator of that church. The heavenly bridegroom created his own bride. Oh, now before he even took the place of bridegroom when he was here on earth and God the father called it, spoke out of heaven said audibly, "This is my beloved son." &gt;&gt; And he was speaking to him, speaking to the people. And in him was the very words of life. Hadn't spoken them yet. that would create a people. &gt;&gt; My brothers and sisters, tonight I want to declare to you, even though you may know this, but that'll be emphasized and and uh uh reconfirmed in your heart, we are we are the object that have been created by words that have originated in that beloved son. He may have used other people and in this day he used a prophet to utter that breath of God out of his mouth creating a people. And you're not here by accident. You're not here even by your own choice. &gt;&gt; You're here because God elected to reveal himself to you. And when he begin to reveal himself to you, identify you and call you out. That is that is what I call being called by your name &gt;&gt; because he he begins to identify you and this becomes very personal. &gt;&gt; That's your call. &gt;&gt; He said he's the creator of that church. The heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of God. As the spirit of God he came down and created in the virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born. He says, I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body. I was challenged right here in the office here by one of the leaders of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada that he says William Brandham says that God created Jesus that Jesus was created. I said the cell the cell of uh the cell of life was created in the womb of Mary. He said oh he said he went like that just in like in disgust. Oh he said how can you believe that? And I and he I said, "Well, who was Jesus?" He said, "Jesus was God." I said, "Amen." I said, "Uh, I can say amen to that." But I said, "Did your God issue out of the womb of a woman?" He thought about that. Great big tall fellow sat back, thought about. I said, "Did your God cry out, "Father, take this cup from me if it's possible." Did your God gasp his last breaths on the cross and in fact die. Jesus Christ died. Did your God die? Did it Did your God come out of a woman a woman and die on a cross? See, then he was stumped. And I just when I say they're backpedaling, when I say that they're insecure, then I come on strong. I said, "You don't understand the Godhead. You come here to explain it to me. You don't know what it's about." Well, he says, "I'm going to get a certain certain man pastor from downtown." He says, "Would you meet with him?" He really knows the Godhead. I said, "Sure, bring him." Never did come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God started with the new creation &gt;&gt; and he stepped into it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word, the logos &gt;&gt; that came out from him in the beginning and here he is on earth. Oh my goodness. I'm having a hard time stopping. There's a wonderful word we have. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And as the spirit came down was in a body was born." And then he said the uh it it was the cells in the womb of Mary for that body. It's not enough for the Holy Spirit to simply give life to human oam supplied by Mary. He said that would have been a sinful mankind producing a baby. He says that would not have produced the last Adam. of him it is said, "Lo, a body hast thou &gt;&gt; prepared for me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This didn't come from a man. It didn't come from Mary. It came from God. God made this body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God stepped into it. &gt;&gt; Mary was a human incubator. She carried that holy child and brought him to birth. It was a God man. He was the son of God. He was the new creation man. And God met and joined. He was the first of the new race. He was the head of this new race. I'm glad I'm part of that race. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm part of that super group. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the head of the body of the church. Paul said in Colossians, therefore, if any man be in Christ, he's a new creation. And then he goes on to say, "And that you put on the new man, which after God has created in righteousness, the new creation, not the old creation made over." Hello. &gt;&gt; This is not the old creation made over. This is not the creation that came by sex that's just fixed up. &gt;&gt; Want to say amen to that? &gt;&gt; It's not just something that's patched up, &gt;&gt; something that came through the human race and it's just fixed up. This is a new creation. You're in the new creation. He called you in the new creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's another creation. He said, distinct from the old one. Oh, thank God. I feel like doing a dance. &gt;&gt; It's a new creation. Distinct from the old creation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Wesley had Wesley had brought some young people down from up from Georgia and a young man gave his life to Christ in the Sunday night meeting right while the preaching was on. He just surrendered his life and gave his life to Christ. Been coming to church at brother Dutch Scott's there a little bit and and uh announced to me after the service he said, "Grandpa, why don't you shake hands with him?" He said he he received Christ while you were preaching. Oh my goodness. become a new creation. Not an old creation fixed up, &gt;&gt; not part of the old creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, if I can just my my I'm trying to rush through here. It's another creation distinct from the old one. No longer is he dealing by the ways of the flesh. That was how he dealt with Israel. He chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue through the godly Isaac line. But now out of every kindred, tribe and nation, he has purposed a new creation. He is the first of that creation. He was God created in the form of a man of man. And now by his spirit, he is creating many sons unto himself. God the creator creating himself a part of his creation. &gt;&gt; This is the true revelation of God. He said &gt;&gt; this was his purpose. This purpose, this purpose took form through election. That is why he could look down through to the last stage. Hello. Here we are, father. &gt;&gt; Here we are. He could look through to the last stage. He says he sees you sitting here on a Wednesday evening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He can look down to this last age. right down to this last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of his new creation, the new creation of God. His sovereign power brought it to pass and by his own decree he elected the members of his new cre of this new creation. He predestinated them to the adoption of children according to his good pleasure. Hallelujah. Thou art my beloved son. &gt;&gt; You're in that son. You're in that word, united with him. And by his omniscience and omn omnipotence, he brought it to pass. How else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church, receiving glory from his brethren, if he did not make sure all things he knew, and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass. And then he goes, "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the council of his own good will." Amen. And lo, a voice from heaven. This is Matthew 3:17, which we read, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased." And while they yet spake, while he yet spake, behold, as Peter was speaking, just speaking some words, let's build three tabernacles. And while he spake, uh, cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice. This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye him. And when he be to speak, a race of people came out of it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A super race of people. &gt;&gt; I don't have to pump you up. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. I only try to get you to believe it. I try to convince myself. This old doubting mind. You need to believe that. Biscll &gt;&gt; and everybody on internet hears that. &gt;&gt; And I say to you, you need to believe it. &gt;&gt; And you on internet, you need to believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said it's a super race and the devil will do everything to cut that down. &gt;&gt; Can I read a couple more things just before I close? the the the term accepted that you're accepted in the beloved. It's not just accepted as we we say, well, uh here's a gift. Will you accept this gift? It's not just a matter of receiving and giving. That's not the kind because the Bible speaks of it that they heard the gospel. They received it and they accepted they they accepted the word. They heard the word. They received the word. And that's exactly the same word as accepted, but not this accepted. When this one says, when Paul says you're accepted in the beloved, this is the accepted in the Greek, please. You are highly favored. To make one accepted. If you weren't, he's going to make you accepted. To pursue with grace. Oh my goodness. Think of it in your own wayward way, going your own direction as hard as you could go. This one pursued you, &gt;&gt; followed hard after you, and pursued you with grace, to compass, with favor, to honor, with blessings. And it comes from the word grace. This word accepted actually comes from the root word grace. to be accepted in the beloved, to make them, and to pursue them. But it comes from grace. Grace, that which affords joy, hello. &gt;&gt; Pleasure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Delight, &gt;&gt; sweetness, loveliness. &gt;&gt; It's not a dragged out, &gt;&gt; sad, sour. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Dill pickle injection of some sort. It's not some vinegar experience. This is something that's lovely, &gt;&gt; sweet, wonderful, happy, joyful. Say, "Oh, but the pressures of the world, this is greater than the pressures of the world." Says, "I got such burdens. This is greater than I'm telling you tonight. Greater than any burden you've ever had &gt;&gt; and greater than any burden you ever will have." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You need to accept this. &gt;&gt; You need to receive it. You need to say yay and amen &gt;&gt; to it tonight. There is no other way. &gt;&gt; You don't have any other option. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talking to a woman. Bear with me a few minutes. My I'm trying to close. But brother Brandham talking to a woman and and and and speaking to her. He says this is her only alternative. &gt;&gt; I never never mentioned that. Never caught it just like that. He said it's her alternative. She's accepted her alternative. And I want to say to this congregation tonight, this is your only alternative. &gt;&gt; You don't have a whole bunch of options. &gt;&gt; There isn't a whole bunch of ways to become a beloved, accepted, and received into beloved. There isn't a whole lot of ways. This is the way in the name of Jesus Christ. Walk ye in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Receive it. Accept it. Deny everything else. Even now in your own heart, say, "I deny everything that's opposed to that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might be inclined to say, "Oh, Brother Ed, you don't know what I'm going through." I'll tell you, you don't know the burdens I bear. And the only thing that gives you sustaining grace is this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some of you don't even have a burden. &gt;&gt; You only got a phobe. &gt;&gt; Satan tried to put a phobe on you that you've got some great big in insurmountable thing. It's not insurmountable. I deny it in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Deny that phobe. &gt;&gt; Deny that thing. &gt;&gt; It's just a doubt. I'm going to preach till it's gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the sooner you get rid of it, the sooner I can end. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't have a problem. We got the We got the source. We got the alternative. &gt;&gt; The only alternative there is. Let this congregation rise and accept it in the name of Jesus Christ. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is abundant grace. &gt;&gt; This is his grace. You are accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; He's not going to deny you. &gt;&gt; He's accepted you. When he called you, he accepted you. &gt;&gt; You're accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; What a joy. What a glorious position to be in. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why don't we just stand? We're thanking him. Glory. &gt;&gt; I heard some heard some comments that Brother Tony was making when he came up to pray and I thought it was so striking because there were just so much like uh a quote that I had here and I've got to close with this quote. That's our position of a believer in Christ. He says, "And through the blood, washing of the blood, taking away, separating of sin." That the Holy Spirit woos the believer. He's pursued you and he woos you. He woos the believer through the blood. &gt;&gt; Cleansing. cleansing of the soul into the fellowship into the spirit life inside Christ inside with Christ. &gt;&gt; He woos you. That's what he's doing tonight. That's why I'm preaching. The Holy Spirit is wooing you &gt;&gt; to fellowship through the blood into Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says, he says this, "Shut out the world. The very nature of God is in you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen each time? Each time it registers, still subject to mistakes, &gt;&gt; but God can't see it &gt;&gt; because it's covered by the blood. &gt;&gt; God can't see through the blood. &gt;&gt; Every time he looks through the blood, it looks white. &gt;&gt; He looks through the blood, it looks white. He said again, so of God was so pleased with Christ till he accepted him and said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased." And through Christ being the perfect one, us dead to our own thoughts and ideas, being born of the spirit of God, walking not after the theology, but after the spirit inside of us. Then let the dead, let the dead in Christ walk not after the things of the world, but after the things of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he says, "So, so you're inside of Christ." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in him, you're accepted &gt;&gt; into beloved. &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory to God. How we thank you, Lord. Bless your people. Bless the super race. Bless this virtuous bride. Oh God, those that still may feel a twinge of something negative in their heart, I pray that you'll bind it up. &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll cast it out. And every spirit of hell that would try to utter a lie to your people. I pray you will cut off his breath and cut off his words and cut off his attempt to speak to the people of God. In the name of Jesus Christ as a servant of Christ and the church of the living God, we cast him out. &gt;&gt; Victory in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Victory in this beloved one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a glorious Christ. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Blessed be his name. &gt;&gt; Oh, we bless that wonderful name &gt;&gt; of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song. Let's worship him. &gt;&gt; Bless that wonderful name of Jesus. Don't even know how it goes exactly. We need to worship him now. &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll bless that wonderful name of Jesus. Bless and wonderful name of Jesus. How blessed that wonderful name of Jesus. It's the sweetest name. I know. I'll bless that wonderful name of Jesus. Bless that wonderful name of Jesus. Bless and wonderful name of Jesus. [Music] Looks like we don't have the words that isn't that old. Eternal super race must be able to remember it. I just say the sweetest name I know. If I run into a line, I don't know exactly the word, I just make up one. &gt;&gt; The Lord knows what's in my heart anyway. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the songwriter says to me. It's the sweetest name right now. So I'll bless that wonderful name of Jesus. Bless that wonderful name of Jesus. Oh, how blessed and wonderful today is the sing [Music] bless and wonderful name of Jesus. Bless and wonderful name of Jesus. You are blessed and wonderful. Our Jesus is the sweetest. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let the people of the Lord say so. Let everything that have breath praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; glory. Glory. I can tell you the devil hates it when you when you give him praise and thanksgiving. We're magnifying him. We're magnifying his sacrifice at Calvary where he bought us and now came and redeemed us and claimed us to his own. Let's say also he looked beyond our fault and saw our need. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace shall be my song. [Music] and my [Music] knowledge [Music] and Here's your opportunity now. I shall for [Music] my eyes to [Music] the cross when Jesus died for me. [Applause] That's the grace that my [Music] father [Music] once more so lovely in your voices. [Music] [Applause] my eyes to calus [Music] died for me. Oh, how far [Music] the gra. [Music] [Music] is one of our brothers and his wife that are going to be traveling east. They've not had their family dedicated. Would we have just a few minutes while Brother Tom prays a prayer of dedication on them? I wanted Brother Roberto and sister uh Mary, would you please come bring the children here while we sing it once again. faith and the other one I have its name here written down too by the time you come and do this dedication. I shall for [Music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Music] died for me. [Music] [Applause] That grace that my falling soul [Music] beyond my fall and my Let's just remain standing while we have this prayer dedication. We indeed have time &gt;&gt; for this is a part of the family of God that the Lord himself has has dealt wonderfully with in Mark 10 verse 13 and verse 14. The disciples wanted to keep the little children away. Lord is just too busy. He said, "Suffer the little children to come to me." And so when I was in prayer, Brother Roberto, Sister Rosemary, before the service, Lord just dropped a a little thought in my heart out of the token message. Go see how the prophet dedicated the family in the token message. So just at the time at the ending of the service, brother Ram said, "Here's now here's a little family, our heavenly father." And he mentions Michael and he takes a little son and their little daughter. And he says, "I lay hands on them." No different than Jesus or like Paul. I lay hands on them. I dedicate them. I lay my hands on them, Lord. May this little girl's life, he said, be blessed in the kingdom of God. Blessed father, blessed mother. May they live long lives, happy, see their children in the service of God. We ask the blessing. We dedicate this family. And I thought, how appropriate, brother Roberto, at token time, token hour, that we as a people, we also can pray that prayer upon this little family. God's dealt with brother Roberto, Sister Rosemary, and and now we've got Desmond, and we have faith. They're asking that we would dedicate them before the Lord. Let's do that as a congregation in the presence of God. Heavenly Father, [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm asking Lord that as I prot you this evening. We've heard your word. We're a part of that new creation. &gt;&gt; Part of the word as creator. Lord, &gt;&gt; I just pray that you'll keep your hand upon this family, upon these children as mother and daddy stand here. &gt;&gt; I pray, Father God, that you will receive these children in the name of Jesus Christ. Bless brother, &gt;&gt; sister Rosemary, make their church. May they see Lord Jesus Christ on display we pray &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Sister Rosemary. God bless you darling. I shall forever I just last. I shall forever. my eyes to brother and to the cross where Jesus died for me. How much the grace that caught my falling soul. He looks beyond my father and mighty. God bless you bride of Jesus Christ. give you a safe journey home this night tonight. Drive safely on the roads that may be a little bit icy. We don't know if we'll see tomorrow, but I want to I want to make your a promise by grace by grace we'll meet. If not here, we'll meet at the supper table. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your hope? &gt;&gt; Is that your faith? &gt;&gt; Is that your claim? We're going to ask brother Andy's to ask God's blessings upon us. God bless you, brother Andes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our lovely Lord Jesus, words would fail us to ever be able to express our gratitude for what you've done in our lives. this great great salvation that you have planned in your own mind before the foundations of the world and included us and even then we were accepted in you Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for this wonderful work of grace and mercy as you've come down in our day, us as little children, and you've predestinated that we'd be upon the earth. You've predestinated our entire lives that we would hear this word, this delivering word and the blood of Christ, the bleeding word, the living word, the creative word, and how it's worked in our lives, even to bring us to this hour, to this service, to hear this message tonight, and out on the internet, those that's participated in this time of worship. Lord, you have ordained it. And we pray God, even though this night can never be repeated, we're asking Lord that you will make it a milestone, make it a foundational evening for us, Lord. that you will build within us the tabernacle of the living God, even a powerhouse in each life, Lord, to be the very powerhouse as your prophet said, bringing forth life and virtue into this dying world and literally bringing forth additional sons and daughters of God by our influence and by our lifegiving efforts of surrendering to you, Lord. Thus every family, every man and woman but boy and girl. We pray heavenly father that this church as well as other message churches throughout the world but we being a part of this assembly Lord God would be an example in in our homes and our individual lives. And Lord that this assembly would be an example of the New Testament church in power and in deliverance. Lord, bless us, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. As we know that we are blessed in the beloved. We ask, Lord Jesus, your blessing upon us, Lord, until we're able to gather again here before you this coming Lord's day. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask this blessing and give you praise and thanksgiving. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. Andies, I tell you what, a super race knows how to pack it in. We're just a couple minutes short of two hours. You weren't that you you didn't pack that much in in any two hours of today. We've worshiped, we've prayed, we've dedicated a family, we've heard the word. The devil's been defeated. Unbelief has gone. Hallelujah. in two hours. All right. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Shake hands with one another. And while you do, you might as well sing. I'm blessed. Blessed. Blessed every day that I live. I'm blessed. And go out from this place. Know that you're blessed. Believe it. Hallelujah. You're dismissed in Jesus name. I am blessed. [Music] I am blessed. God bless you, brother Thomas. [Music] [Music] Down. Down. [Music] [Music] [Music] Christ living within. [Music] Green [Music] [Music] bless. [Music]
