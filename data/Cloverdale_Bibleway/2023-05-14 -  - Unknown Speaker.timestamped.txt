[0:11] but for me it means we're holding each
[0:14] other accountable
[0:14] [Music]
[0:18] sort of fidelo stands for always
[0:21] faithful to the Core
[0:22] and every turn to your back on it
[0:24] [Music]
[0:26] what is somebody you can rely on like
[0:28] one time they're going to get tough you
[0:29] know that there's going to be someone
[0:30] there to back you up and it's going to
[0:32] be your fellow Marine that's on your
[0:33] left or your right
[0:35] so we're always faithful we're always
[0:36] there with each other we'll always be
[0:37] fighting for each other if we have
[0:39] nothing else left at the end of the day
[0:42] me that is just a level of commitment
[0:45] unlike any other and I will never be a
[0:48] part of anything else
[0:49] [Music]
[0:55] I think it speaks volumes of character
[0:57] of Queen's past present usually thinking
[1:00] about what culture of ourselves always
[1:03] faithful to each other to our country
[1:05] for families
[1:09] [Music]
[1:15] foreign
[1:22] hey I'm not even American I'm proud of
[1:23] them
[1:24] soldiers
[1:27] but they don't have an eternal Bond
[1:31] like you and I have I'm sorry they might
[1:35] carry the motto Semper Fidelis hmm
[1:38] but I said no way I was studying halfway
[1:40] through I had a totally different title
[1:41] and I came across that he said um that's
[1:42] my title that's exactly what my motto is
[1:45] always faithful always loyal that's what
[1:48] it means I'm sorry but at least one lady
[1:51] said I'll never be involved if something
[1:53] is bigger than this sorry there is
[1:55] something bigger that's called a battle
[1:57] for life and death and there's an army
[2:00] that's raging against the enemy and I'm
[2:02] part of that big army
[2:04] [Applause]
[2:06] I'd take semper fidelis my way you know
[2:09] what they say about that it damage to
[2:11] demonstrate that in Practical terms new
[2:13] recruits are told story after story of
[2:16] how Marine sacrificed in combat to
[2:19] remain faithful to their fellow Warriors
[2:20] and so they're constantly telling each
[2:22] other of a warrior I've gone by they're
[2:25] telling each other of a shamgar they're
[2:27] telling each other assumption they're
[2:29] telling each other of a David of people
[2:32] gone by saying you know them December
[2:34] Philadelphia
[2:35] you know that person except for Phil
[2:37] Dallas you know any biscoll stiffer for
[2:39] Dallas
[2:42] look to each other and you say hey
[2:44] Stanford from Dallas
[2:48] putting their lives at risk to save all
[2:49] the Marines refusing to leave one of
[2:52] their own behind alive or dead
[2:57] that's this Earth
[2:58] but not dead in this light in eternity
[3:01] because this semper fidelis this army
[3:03] goes through a prayer meeting on a
[3:04] Monday night and they're praying for
[3:06] those that are wounded those that are
[3:08] somewhere left into battle and they're
[3:10] saying ah nah devil we're fighting we're
[3:13] going to be going to Warfare we're going
[3:15] to be telling each other except for
[3:16] Dallas oh he's faithful
[3:21] we can talk about Peter and Noah
[3:23] different ones who risk their life think
[3:24] about John the Baptist they would have
[3:26] been telling each other do you know what
[3:27] he did he put his life on the line he
[3:29] was preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[3:31] they cut off his head Semper Fidelis
[3:37] faithful loyal
[3:40] families moving here and there trying to
[3:42] uproot their families to grow and go
[3:43] maybe go to church many of you moved in
[3:45] here so your children could be in a
[3:47] school you're sacrificing your
[3:48] livelihoods you're sacrificing your ease
[3:50] why you're faithful to the cause you're
[3:52] faithful to the words that need whatever
[3:53] I can for my children Semper Fidelis
[3:58] story after Story
[4:00] encouraging each other in the faithful
[4:02] gone by and the faithful that are
[4:04] present
[4:05] you know what the rest says
[4:07] it says in many of the stories
[4:10] one one Marine made a conscious decision
[4:12] to die
[4:14] in order to save the lives of others
[4:17] and so they tell the story this one died
[4:20] and it would start to well up something
[4:22] some comrade ship loyal to the Core
[4:28] and this commitment to semper fidelis
[4:30] was one of the reasons Marines enjoy the
[4:33] well-deserved reputation for Valor in
[4:36] combat
[4:39] because they encourage each other
[4:40] telling each other of different counts
[4:42] because they go to like I said and they
[4:45] gather together they edify but I said
[4:47] let me tell you of a story of all time
[4:50] of one that gave his life on a cross for
[4:54] you and I it is a no Marine which I
[4:57] respect but the king of glory came down
[4:59] to a stable to save Mankind and give
[5:03] salvation for all oh that's them for
[5:05] Fidelity that's always faithful
[5:11] I will sing of my redeemer and its
[5:14] precious love for me on a cool crossy
[5:16] suburb pain that dead and made me free
[5:19] single thing
[5:22] that's what I'll say to the next one
[5:24] that builds up Valor in combat
[5:29] amen
[5:30] that's why things say Leave No Man
[5:32] Behind
[5:33] comes into play here with the Marines
[5:35] it's burned into their being
[5:37] it becomes part of really who they are
[5:40] far be it
[5:41] from an Earthly Army Corps
[5:44] to have more Valor more loyalty more
[5:47] comrade Chef more faithfulness than the
[5:51] armies of the Living God
[5:57] that's why each one of us young old
[5:59] middle-aged teenage walking down the
[6:02] hallway at school he said how you doing
[6:04] Sandra Fidelis faithful loyal or are you
[6:08] just pretending we don't need feigned
[6:09] loyalty
[6:11] now feign loyalty
[6:14] because what happens there after a time
[6:16] I don't have time to get into it that
[6:19] that manifests itself
[6:21] so if you need loyalty you need to
[6:23] Pledge of Allegiance not to No Flag but
[6:25] to the word
[6:26] [Music]
[6:28] maybe it's in your bedroom
[6:30] he said Lord I need that
[6:32] except for Fidelis
[6:34] eternal
[6:40] what a great example
[6:43] we had John 15 greater love hath no man
[6:46] in this
[6:47] that a man laid down in his life
[6:50] for his friends
