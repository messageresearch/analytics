Amen. &gt;&gt; Our brother Abe Dick is uh requesting prayer for Jamie. Uh the doctor said he should have been dead in the accident and uh he's really banged up and uh just a miracle. Anyways, just brother Abee's asking it would Lord would use this situation for his good to reunite the family and uh Sister Jan Hall from South Carolina is requesting prayer. He's going in for heart surgery. If you've got a need here this morning, if you're listening in on the internet and have a need, amen, you just cry out to him this morning. Amen. We have a God who's able to meet every need. Amen, brother John. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, we just want to continue in this worship today. God, what a mighty God we serve. Lord, we're reminded 2,000 years ago, you came walking into the city and they laid down their clothes. They laid down palm branches. They laid down Lord. And here we are 2,000 years later with a revelation of who that was walking into the city. Lord, would you walk into Coverdale Bible Way today, Lord? Lord, would you walk into this atmosphere that we are trying to create of love and of service? And Lord, what would this meeting be if Jesus Christ would come walking into this building, God? I believe every heart where their sin, they could be set free. Every heart that would be shackled, God, that we would hear the chains falling off. every heart that might be sick, Lord, that would just reach out and touch the hem of your garment, by your stripes, they could be healed, Lord, the signs would follow them that believe. There's believers here, God. We're worshiping a risen Savior, Lord, as you were headed to Calvary and headed to the cross, but Lord, we're here celebrating Easter, the resurrection, God. Lord, rise up within your people, Lord, once more. Lord, we've heard about these things over the years. They become more real and more precious to us even as the days have gone by. But we want to see more of it, Lord. More of your wondrous works to show. There's lives that need a touch, Lord. There's lives that need deliverance. Healing is ours, Lord. And we're claiming our loved ones. The Passover lamb, God. The token is being applied. You are our lamb, God. You are everything to us and you have prevailed and wrestled with Satan and you have won the victory. God, we're here to wave our hearts and worship. We're here to open up our mouths, Lord. We're not deaf and we're not dumb. And there's hands and hearts and lives, Lord, that you've set free from the dungeons of hell. You've loosed us, God. We were in bondage in Egypt and the wilderness had our eyes filmed over. But Lord, give us grace to cross Jordan and come into the land that's flowing with milk and honey. May you pour out your spirit on this service today. Even tonight, Lord, may you move this whole day, God. Let there be a strange dealings, Lord, of supernatural workings. That while we hear the word, there would be no unbelief, God, that every heart would be so dedicated, Lord, and so open to you that you could drop down and do the impossible, Lord. Supernatural would be going from heart to heart. There would be streams of light and rays of light, God, going throughout this building. that you would take our pastor in your hands and once more shepherd our souls Lord into your divine presence that Lord there could be a release there could be a worship God as we bow down we kneel down we throw our hearts down before you God you're the same Jesus you're the same yesterday today and forever so hands are lifted up over the building our brothers need you again Lord May you touch our brother Edwin, Father. Whatever is hindering in his body so that you would receive the full glory and praise and your will would be done. May you minister to him today. Thank you for sparing Jaime's life in this accident. I pray you'd restore the family and do something within the homes, God, and this need from South Carolina. God, you know all of us, Lord. We just lift our hand up silently. God, you know our needs. You know our thoughts. Here we are to worship. Here we are to bow down. Here we are to say that you are our only God. May you meet with us today in this place. God, &gt;&gt; bless every part of the meeting. The fellowship hall is full of believers. The nursery is full of mothers. God, out on the internet, Lord. lives. We're connected because we love your appearing. So would you help us, God? Help us this morning to shake off all of our feelings and what someone else might think and what someone else is doing, God, and enter into your presence. That there'd be a total liberty and freedom, God. And when the word is spoken, there would be a divine encounter. Father, you are our victory. Show your victories throughout this service today. Even people that aren't even in the service, but you would go out to them and move on the faith line of believers. And we're waiting on you and we want to see you today. Bless every aspect. God, we surrender to you now. We calm our hearts and we're looking. We're watching and we're listening for the sound of your appearing. Bless your name, God. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. I wonder if we can say, "Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord, for answering our prayers, Lord. Hallelujah. You brought us to this service. You pre-planned this meeting, God. We're here to see you, God. And we know that you're already answering our prayers. What a mighty God you are. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can have your seats. We want to welcome all those who are visiting with us today. We trust that and enjoy the presence of God with us, the ministry of the word as our pastor is going to be coming. Did we have a special this morning? The choir sing. Oh, wonderful. That's great. Figured they had something, but I didn't get the message this morning. So, maybe they could come at this time. And uh as they come, why don't we sing together uh number uh 10:58, be magnified, oh Lord. We just we'll just sing the chorus. Be magnified, oh Lord. Lord, you are highly exalted and there is nothing you can do. Oh Lord, my eyes are on you. Be magnified, oh Lord, be mag. Sing it once again. Oh, dream magnified. Oh, you are highly exalted and there is nothing you can do. My eyes are on you. We magnify Lord. Be magnified. I was in prison, locked up in chains. pains. Sin held me captive to sorrow and pain. Years of frustration as love passed me by. Until the master heard my heart's cry for grace marvelous I praise God and behold his grace flows from above with infant love. marvelous grace. I was downhearted. I was broken inside. Praying for mercy with nowhere to hide. There was a solace searching for thee with peace ever flowing and it set my soul free. Oh, it was grace, marvelous grace. I need to pardon and make me gra from All of his grace. I am forgiven. I am redeemed. A brand new creation. He saved me and he gave me a reason to sing.

I'm so thankful. Thank you, Lord. Let's just worship as we sing this chorus just once again. So we cry out your name. Hell should die. God of grace, Lord most high Jesus Christ. We rely on your grace and I ground in praise. Lord Jesus Christ Lord we will cry your name should die God of praise. Oh, Jesus Christ. We rely on your grace and I pray. Jesus Christ. So wonderful to be in the atmosphere of worship to hear the choir singing, hear the prayer that's been prayed. We also I don't know was anything said about brother Tim Hoffer this morning. All right. Uh, brother Tim and sister Susan Hoffer, I believe, left this morning uh for North Dakota, Minnesota, wherever on the border there. Brother Tim Hoffer's uh brother has not been heard of uh for a week now. That's last Sunday. That was the last contact. And uh they're right. He had a little farm. He was not on the colony. He was in a a little farm at Acreage. And that acorage is completely surrounded by water. Uh the uh National Guard or the sheriff's department, one or the other, were in there and the water over one bridge was 16t over the bridge and over the other bridge I think was around 6t. He was going to go in and uh uh last Saturday and brother Tim spoke to him. he wanted to come out here and he said that he he said I've got to find God and uh he was really uh really desperate for a number of reasons. Desperation has struck his life. So we don't know just exactly uh what has happened. We don't know whether he has uh perished or in the flood or whether he is on his way out here. Uh but brother Tim and sister Susan, brother Tim especially has some very very grave concerns. So I've been praying for him and for the family and just that uh that this will be resolved. And so I'd like the congregation to join me also in that prayer this morning and and join our brother Tim. Brother Tim Hoffer is not a high-profile person where he's highly visible, but he's a real man of God, a real saint, and we want to be in prayer uh for them uh today. Uh like the scripture says, bear you one another's burdens. So, we're going to do that. We're going to do what the scripture tells us to do. And uh let's just be in prayer for meetings uh tonight. Brother Lance will be speaking in about three weeks from now and I would appreciate very very much your prayers. We'll be having meetings in Switzerland and it's it's rather unique situation and about one month after that there are some meetings in Germany. You may wonder how some of these meetings uh uh happen but I can tell you they're not just meetings meetings. They are uh there's there's a lot of background more background than I can take time to give you now but the meetings in Germany which happen at the end of April 1st end of May 1st of June uh those are there are a series of uh younger men and they're kind of peers uh uh there's uh one pastor that passed away and a a brother has risen up and become pastor of that church. another brother in Germany passed away some time ago and uh uh a a younger man took his place. There's another church and and and these brothers are all peers and they have wonderful fellowship. And then the church also in in Gent where the Iversons are from. They're also very close to these brothers and uh quite a number of years ago there were there were some churches that got together and they wanted to have meetings along the German Dutch border at one place was Verden and then they had an couple of places and for the first six years uh I I I was requested to take those meetings. So one year after another for six years we had meetings. Brother Burkhart and Sister Doris were there and and oh quite a number of uh people from Germany at that time were there and the meetings were blessed of God. We started out I would imagine maybe 200 250 people and we're getting maybe 400 450 uh by the time two three four years had gone by and then then these brothers now it's been quite a few years since that happened and they have such a desire to come together again and to have these services because they haven't had any and so they just thought well uh ask if I would come there and and uh whether it's I don't think it's for old times sake but they said we just would like to have those kind of meetings again and so would you please come. So I all I can do is ask you if you would pray because nobody packs these meetings in their suitcase. You know, uh Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I didn't come I didn't come with the suitcase this morning either. You know, we've just got the word of God here and we've been waiting on the Lord and so on and so forth. And if the Holy Spirit doesn't come and take your hearts and your minds and my mind and my mouth and so this whole thing's in vain, we might as well just go out and get a coffee someplace. Uh but it would it would do just as much good for us. But if we're here to hear the word of God and that's what those people desire, and I've been thinking a lot about that this week, you know, it really we hear it often. you know what your expectation is. But I think that expectation I I just thought I might mention this to you before we break the word. But uh uh probably India and Africa are two of the countries that I think of that where the people have such a response to the word of God. And uh I recall vividly being on the platform several times, many times, and I couldn't get off the platform. You're just done preaching, and the the people are so full of expectation and so responsive, not with not emotionally, but so responsive to the word and just hanging on and and believing also in the office of the minister who's who's behind the pulpit. leaving just hanging on to every word and and not being able to leave the platform. You just invaded and completely encircled and people grabbing Brother Lonnie Jenkins was there as well and he would take a service. I take a service and and this one service in particular and the people just grab my hand. mothers and fathers, grab my hand and and and put it on their uh teenagers and pray for them because this is happening or that's happening or they're in school or whatever. Bless them in their in their studies and and one father and mother standing there with also some of the other children of one family grab my hand and put it on their son's head. He was about 12 years old and they said he fell when he was a boy, 3 or four years old. He fell out of a building maybe two or three stories and landed on his head and hasn't spoke since. And they said, "Pray for him." And with that kind of faith, friends, &gt;&gt; with that kind of faith and that kind of response and I I just prayed a prayer amongst all a whole crowd of maybe hundred people on the platform and I I prayed a prayer for that boy and I just said to him, "Say Jesus." He said, "Jesus." He just begin to speak just like that. And I it wasn't me. It wasn't even the prayer. It was their faith in what was in the word of God and the promise. And I just thought, you know, if we could just become more simple, if we could just become more simple and do away with our our pride and our our state formality and give God a chance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you believe that with me? Just give God a chance. We're not here to have any special, you know, uh special kind of order or special. We want God. We just want God to come on the scene and and do what he would want to do. I want him to be pleased with the meeting. Doesn't matter what we feel, but I want him to be pleased. Amen. So, let's just stand and I'd like to sing. Brother Rod, uh, He came to me and then we're just going to have prayer and go immediately to the word. He came. He came to me when I could not come to where he was. He came to me. Is that your testimony? That's why I died on Calary when I could not come to where he was. He came to me once again all together now. He came to me. He came to me when I could not come to where he was. He came to me. That's why he died on Calary. When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. We're so glad you came to us. &gt;&gt; We couldn't penetrate that veil. We could not come to the unseen, but you came into the visible in the invisible God, almighty God, creator of heavens and earth and all things that are therein. Oh God, God of Israel, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, you became known and visible to us. We saw your attributes. We see your compassion. We see your mercy. We see all the blessed benefits that have come to us through Jesus Christ. We see your longsuffering and how you were willing to take the penalty of our sin and bear it for us. And then you said invited us to come and lay our burdens at your feet. And here we are today, Lord. We're burdened for brother Tim and Sister Susan Holer and the family of Harold Holer. Lord, not knowing where that man is, but you know exactly what has taken place. And I pray, Father, you'll bring a resolution to this situation, oh God. And I ask that you will go and use our brother Tim mightily. I pray that his testimony and the testimony of others of the Hover family and brother Daryl oh God that is here, brother David and different ones may the words which they have spoken and the testimony that they have given may it anchor in the hearts of the people. Oh God, I pray father that if all of this takes place just for one more soul, it'll be worth it all. I pray father you'll move the community very much. go with them and may the Holy Spirit use them just as a vessel. And while I pray for them, I pray for myself this morning. Lord, I pray that I may just be a vessel, just a tool, oh God, just a mouthpiece to say something that would be a benefit, a strength. Oh God, a deliverance for someone, a healing for someone. Lord, I ask, oh God, above all things, that the spirit of revelation will be upon us, upon all that are listening, oh God, on the internet, I pray you'll bless them, oh father, wherever they might be at this moment. And now, Lord, I just give myself to you and pray, Father, as you receive us, you've heard our worship, and now we come before you humbly, asking your blessings and your anointing upon the word in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'll have you turn in your Bibles, please, to First Kings, the 19th chapter. We're going to begin to read at verse 19, I'm sorry, at the 19th chapter, verse 9. I have a strange title this this morning. I want to speak to you on a still small voice and Elijah's mantle. It's not two subjects, but it's it is one. A still small voice and Elijah's mantle. We're reading, "And he came thither unto a cave." This is Elijah. and lodged there. And behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, and said unto him, What doest thou hear, Elijah? And he said, I've been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts, for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword. And I, even I only am left, and they seek my life to take it away. And he said, "Go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And then behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and break in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, a still small voice. And it was so when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out and stood in the entering of the cave. And behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What do thou hear, Elijah? And he said, "I've been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts, because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword, and I, even I only am left, and they seek my life to take it away." And the Lord said unto him, "Go return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when thou comest anoint Hezel to be the king over Syria, and Jahu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel? And Elisha the son of Shafat of Abel Mcccla mccala shall thou anoint to be prophet in thy room." And it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of Heziel shall Jahu slay. And him that escapeth the sword of Jahu shall Elisha slay. Yet I have left me 7,000 in Israel. All of the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him. So he departed then and found Elisha the son of Chafat who was plowing with 12 yolk of oxen before him and he with the 12th. And Elijah Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him. And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said unto and said, "Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee." And he said unto him, "Go back again, for what have I done to thee?" And he returned back from him, and took a yolk of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him. Amen. God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. I pray that God will give you put you in the same channel that I've been in and that God will help me to convey the thought. There's uh there's been quite a stir that has been taking place. uh we may say amongst the young people I don't want to emphasize the young people so much but there's been a stir that has been taking place and it is especially wonderful when you do find it amongst the young men and young ladies and you'll know why as I progress in the in the message especially in this day when this day is is uh you know this whole age is really it's it's uh just designed for the youth And young people are into everything. So you young people want to be very very conscious of that which I'm sure that you are but not for the wrong reasons. Uh now Elijah he's the reason he's in this cave just quickly background is because he has uh he slew the false prophets of Baal 400 and Jezebel has put uh a sentence on him to kill Elijah and Elijah now has fled for his life and he finds himself in this cave and while he's in his cave you know God's victim says What dost thou here Elijah? And this great strong wind the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces. Uh but the Lord was not in the wind. And uh after the wind was an earthquake and the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake was a fire. And these were spectacular things and things which would catch a person's attention but God was not in them. And then after the fire was a still small voice. And there was something about the voice that he wrapped himself. He took his mantle and wrapped his face in the mantle and went and it moved him. Uh now the one who spoke in that still small voice, there's there's not a believer that's in existence. I'm talking about a real genuine believer. And I I want to and believe that I'm with you today as a believer. There's not a believer that has not heard the still small voice. It is a it is an inner witness. It's a very subtle thing that takes place, but it's something that every believer has heard. And I would say that many, many believers heard it before they were a believer. the still small voice that began to call them and it it is that inner witness. Uh it it it just begins to say the same thing. It just begins to draw. There's a drawing. And so I spoke about the drawing last Sunday. Now I'm speaking about the yielding to that drawing. And uh and so a at the sound of that voice, there was also a a response from Elijah. And he takes his mantle and it was different. It was different from the uh whirlwind. It was different from the rocks breaking. It was different from the earthquake. It was something that was different from the fire. It just had a different a different aspect to it. It not something he had to imagine. He didn't have to imagine it. It brought an immediate response to him. And he takes his mantle and and wraps his head in his mantle and moves forward to the mouth of the cave because he knew this was different. I I want to say to you that we're we're in a different season. &gt;&gt; We're in a different season. And whether you if you don't re recognize it, then I'm asking that you should ask God to quicken me to quicken my mind to give me a clear sense of what's happening in this hour. Give me a clear understanding of why this message ever come. Why did you send such a vindication? Why did you wait uh these thousands of years to do such a thing? Why has there been such a voice? Why is it so Why is it so uh h a gripping? Maybe not flashy. It's not big. It's not a huge denomination. If we're not elaborate elaborate buildings, not elaborate this or elaborate that. It's not the big things. And brother Brandham takes those things. He said it wasn't in those big things and he relates it to the big things that were happening. maybe huge campaigns and huge big this and fancy that. It's not that. That's not what we're striving for. We're thankful for a comfortable comfortable building, but that is irrelevant to us. We would I wouldn't care if we were in a warehouse or where we were. That's not what we're interested in. We're interested in the God of Elijah. &gt;&gt; We're interested in the God that spoke that still small voice. And we could have it out in the field or we could have it out in a tent or we could have it in a warehouse or we could have it in a castle. Whatever it is, we don't care where it is. We just want the God of creation to speak and we want to be ready to respond to it. &gt;&gt; So God is moving Elijah at this time. He's in a transition time. And the transition time is that the ministry which he has is going to pass off to Elisha. And that's the time that he's in right now. And the months prior the months prior to this uh instance or this account, he has prophesied a famine that there will be no rain until I call for it. The prophet of God refers to that many times. He says, notice it was a personal how he uses the personal pronoun. There'll be no there'll be no dew even on the ground till I call for it. &gt;&gt; Elijah calls for the people of Israel to come to Mount Carmel. He slays there the prophets of Baal 400. He sends word he to Ahab. He said go to a servant go and tell Ahab to prepare for rain. Now this has been three three and a half years of drought and the country is starving and people are dying and Ahab tells Jezebel all that the Elijah did. The scripture says and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets of the sword. And she puts this death sentence on him. And while in the cave, Elijah experiences these various things. The wind, the earthquake, the fire, and the and the Lord was not in those. And then the still small voice. What's amazing to me is that people when they it seems that they choose to remember what they want to remember and they choose to forget what they ignore, what they don't want to remember. Now, when Jezebel heard about all of these things, there's no mention. There's no mention whatsoever that this man who said there'll be no rain has now told Ahab the king, you you flee and tell because there's going to be rain. &gt;&gt; And and and there's going to and the Bible says it was a great rain. This wasn't a a little drizzle. A great rain came on. You know, there isn't a word of gratitude. There isn't a word of thanks that that now we have water, we have rain, we have we have we can feed our livestock, we can live once again, we can grow our crops. There's not one word when Jesus referred to this. Now there here's Jezebel and Ahab and they have no regard for it whatsoever. The only thing they remember is a Elijah slew our prophets. &gt;&gt; Elijah came against our denominations. Elijah chopped everything down. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing they could remember. They couldn't remember the fact that he said there be no rain till I called for it. And now after three and a half years, he says, you know, haste because rain's going to come and rain and dark clouds begin to form and rain came. But they have no consciousness of that. It's amazing to me that when people today in this day an educated supposed to be cultured civilization when they start to talk about this prophet of God, they want to talk about how he was so judgmental, how he came against the denominations and all these things, how essentially how he slew the prophets of Baal. That's what they're talking about. But they don't talk about what they they they they well they they just choose to ignore &gt;&gt; what God does in the lives of people. You hardly ever hear it. That's why we have to talk about it. &gt;&gt; That's why we have to rejoice in it. That's why I'm thankful. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of churches in the uh I'm going to be very plain this morning. There's a lot of churches in this valley, a lot of churches in the Pacific Northwest. But I'll tell you, there's very, very few of them. Listen to me now. very few of them that have all their young people sitting around the front and eager to hear the word of God and 150 plus coming to on on the Friday evening at the meetings and the kind of comments that I get and the kind of emails that I receive very very few I say somebody should say thank you Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; some parents ought to be shouting hallelujah &gt;&gt; I say praise be to God. &gt;&gt; That's the God of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Somebody's heard a small voice. &gt;&gt; Somebody's responded to it. &gt;&gt; This doesn't come by mechanics. &gt;&gt; It comes by dynamics. &gt;&gt; And we have been the recipients of some dynamics. &gt;&gt; Whether you want to believe it or not, I choose to accept it. I choose to believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can sit back if you wish and find fault and pick holes. And I can tell you that you'll do that till your till your bones are white &gt;&gt; because it'll always be here with us. &gt;&gt; But I thank God for what I do see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thank God. I see the resurrected Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; amongst his people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So they remember one thing of Jesus, he recalled something else. And the Bible says, "And it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering of the cave. And behold, there was a voice unto him that said, "What dost thou hear, Elijah?" Now, he didn't just hear a still small voice, but now he had to he began to yield. He began to yield. And this is very this is a uh a difficult subject because how do you yield? And what does it really mean to yield? And so I I I may not be as specific as I wish to be, but as you pick it up throughout the service, he heard a still small voice. Uh the word is he heard a a a a calm voice. God doesn't usually work in in an agitated way. If you get anxious and all uptight and so on, that's not the Holy Spirit. God works in a his voice will bring a calmness. It was a small still voice almost like a whisper but it was inside this voice that he heard. Brother Brandham said in the message God's preparation or an early message in 54 he said uh here comes Simeon. He's referring now to Simeon, not Elijah, but Simeon led by the Holy Spirit like you people, he said, that are have been led here tonight. I thought that was &gt;&gt; that's astounding. &gt;&gt; What Brother Brandham is doing is taking the voice that led Simeon &gt;&gt; to the Lord Jesus Christ and letting the people know that's what led you. And I felt inspired to say to you that's what has led you. &gt;&gt; I can tell you no demon voice brought you here. &gt;&gt; Nothing from the kingdom of darkness brought you here. &gt;&gt; You had to yield to something else. So, well, I just did it as a ritual. Maybe that's what you think. But there's something inside. If I wasn't in the house of God, I would be out of place. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be where I ought to be. That goes to show that there's a voice. There's something within that is witnessing to you of that the Holy Spirit still has a still small voice. Uh it brings a calm. It may be just a whisper, &gt;&gt; but we need to regard it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what I want you to do today. I want you to regard it. I'm telling you as a servant of Christ. That's the voice and I'm taking right from a messenger and I'm taking from my own experience and many of you experienced the same thing and you know that voice. You've heard and you felt that urging and there's a pull to that voice. &gt;&gt; The fire, the earthquake and the wind did not urge the prophet to the cave to the mouth of the cave. But the still small voice did. &gt;&gt; And he says, like you people were led here tonight, walked down and stopped. He said, "I see," and he's speaking of Simeon. He said, "I see the messianic sign." That is him. This is him. Reached right over and said, "Lord, let your servant depart in peace according to your word. Mine eyes have seen the salvation which thou hast prepared." In God's preparation, he continues on. He says, "And I can hear her testify, speaking of Anna, just then the Holy Ghost said, and stand up. He's in the temple." Hallelujah. I can hear the Holy Ghost say, "And stand up. He's in the temple." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You think I'm just enthused? Not a bit. I can say that he's present here. The same voice, the same one &gt;&gt; trying to get our attention. &gt;&gt; He's not in history and he's not in the future. He's here at this very moment. He's in this vortex of time. If you can believe it. &gt;&gt; He's in the temple. &gt;&gt; Where is he, Lord? She heard that still small voice speak in her heart. She raised up and here comes that old blind woman going right around through the people bumping into one and then the other one. What's the matter? Led by the Holy Ghost. The deep calling to the deep. &gt;&gt; Deep calling to the deep folks is more than a song. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You that are seated here today, you that have connected to the internet and you took the time and you turned it on and you logged in. Y'all want to sit there. They stand when we stand here. We want to participate in this meeting. That's not the result of some habit. That's a result of the Holy Spirit. There's a still small voice. And I want you to regard today, I want you to be able to say within your heart, I'm here because I heard his voice. &gt;&gt; Not 20 years ago or 10 years ago or 5 years ago or last year. Today, &gt;&gt; I heard his voice &gt;&gt; and I'm here again that he might confirm that is his voice to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the still small voice of his word. He said, "Notice not big noises in the message evening messenger." He said, "But it didn't attract the prophet." The prophet didn't care about the big noises, but when he heard the still small voice, he knew that that was the word. &gt;&gt; He veiled his face and came walking out. And what I want to bring to your attention right away quickly is when the prophet heard the still small voice and was moved by that and took his mantle and wrapped his face and was motivated by that still small voice and it was correct because that's what's written in the word of God. That's what he was supposed to do because when he moved then God said what doest thou here Elijah and then he got the commission what to do and he moved out on the basis of that voice. It was that same mantle and that mantle was nothing more than the word of God for the word spoke when he was moved and that mantle is nothing more than the nothing less than the mantle of the word of God. And there was a day in your existence, there was a day in your experience, listen to me close, there was a moment, a time when that mantle was cast onto you. &gt;&gt; And you felt and you came under the impact &gt;&gt; of that voice. &gt;&gt; It might have been just a word. It might have just been a phrase. It might have just been something that took place, but it pulled you. It drew you out from where you were. &gt;&gt; We've all had our cave. &gt;&gt; We've all had our place where we fled and tried to move and get away from things. But God called you out of that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach folks &gt;&gt; with God's help. the mantle of Elijah and yielding to the pull. And so he departed then, and he found Elisha, the son of Shafat, who was plowing with 12 yolk of oxen before him, and he with the 12th. He was with the last the 12th of the of the oxen 12 yoke. And Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him. This is not a uh some act of that is so spectacular and unusual. A man walks by another man. Elisha got up that morning like any morning. &gt;&gt; He prepared to go to work to the field like any day. &gt;&gt; He harnessed up those oxen and got them ready to plow like he would at any time. Amen. &gt;&gt; This day, this day was no different than any other day. &gt;&gt; He was just on his way to do his duty. It was just an ordinary day, folks. &gt;&gt; He just got up like you did and had breakfast like anytime. &gt;&gt; Maybe took his lunch bucket and went to work. &gt;&gt; He just went stepped up to his place of work, his place of duty, whatever it was. But there was a time &gt;&gt; when God saw that there was a different day. &gt;&gt; This was to be a different moment. And God came by your way and cast his mantle of his word onto your body and you can never escape it from that day forward. &gt;&gt; Something anchored in your heart. &gt;&gt; It may not have been a very spectacular moment. &gt;&gt; It may not have been anything with any great announcement and something came by your way &gt;&gt; and it was this God &gt;&gt; that I'm speaking of. Amen. &gt;&gt; None other. I'm going to give him all the glory. I'm going to give him all the credit. &gt;&gt; It was this God. Some of you young people just been baptized recently. I want you to know that it wasn't anyone that convinced you to do that. But this God spoke to you. This God came by and cast his mantle of this message word upon you. And you can never be the same from that time. You might even go back. People go back and cast it off and go into the world. I don't worry about them. All I can say is God will never take back his dealings. &gt;&gt; And there'll be nobody as miserable in the world as a miserable believer. &gt;&gt; They can never have peace. &gt;&gt; They can never duplicate what they experience in Christ. &gt;&gt; I can tell you right now, they're miserable. &gt;&gt; They lose sleep. &gt;&gt; And I pray God deal with them &gt;&gt; and grind them down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe they've been having a good time. They've been prospering and now we've got an economic meltdown. I say, "Praise God for the meltdown. Let it come. &gt;&gt; Let it grind these who've walked away from God into the ground, into poverty, into sickness, into whatever &gt;&gt; until they call out on the name of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All these other things are nothing but ashes. And so he left the oxen and ran after Elijah. Man, I'm talking about yielding to the pull. &gt;&gt; I'm struck to preaching and continuing on from the drawing. What drew a man that got up like any farmer would and and got ready to plow and he's plowing 12 oxen, 12 yolk of oxen out in front of him. I tell you, that's a chore. that that that is really a task. And he's in the middle of that and a man walks by and casts his mantle on him and he runs right after him. &gt;&gt; Something pulled him. &gt;&gt; I was a different I wasn't just a rag that was tossed on him. It was more it was what the mantle represented. &gt;&gt; This a reality, folks. &gt;&gt; This isn't just a story. This is a reality. I'm bringing it right down to you this morning right here. Something pulled you &gt;&gt; to where you are now. &gt;&gt; And what pulled you to this point is going to pull you on into eternity. &gt;&gt; It's not going to let you go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; I hear the call. &gt;&gt; This is something to be enthused about &gt;&gt; because this is truth. You can find it all through the scriptures. And he ran after Elijah. And he said, "Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee." And he said unto him, "Go back again, for what have I done to you?" It's a good thing to answer. It's a good thing even for us to ask ourselves, "What happened to us? Why did I Why did I choose to I talked to a a brother one time, Brother Amy Mulan, and he's pastor one, and many of you know, he was an old-timer here in the church. Brother Amy, he was a what a lot of people don't know, he was a hopeless wretch of an alcoholic. He could sit in a room and drink himself into oblivion. He didn't want to see anybody. He didn't need any friends. He would just get alone by himself and get all his liquor around him and just drink for a month into absolute oblivion. And when this came, uh, when this mantle was cast on him, &gt;&gt; his mind went to work right away, overtime, &gt;&gt; Satan turbocharged his brain. And he said, he told me, he said, I could have I could have found all kinds of argument against it because he was he was taught and reared up in the Catholic faith. He had left here trying to get uh rid of his alcoholic problem. He actually left here and went down to Borneo down into New Guinea and those areas there and got on a missionary ship so that he could just give him he just wanted to give himself to something religious of a of a spiritual order so he could get free from this demon of alcohol and it wouldn't work. And every time he tried to get over it, he just plunge right back into it. and through his brother, his brother who's a believer today, his brother and his brother and his sister-in-law go to brother Roger Smith's church and his brother I went and had a meeting in his brother's home and there was they were in a charismatic movement at that time and I had the first meeting. They'd been listening to the Bible believers radio broadcast. I got invitation to go over to Vancouver Island. There was about 21 22 in the room. They were all different faiths. And that is that was one time I I I just laid out a little bit of a challenge casually and I said that I'm sure that we all love Jesus. I'm sure everybody here loves Jesus. They're sitting on the floor sitting there, business people, all the rest of it. And I started over here with this person. I said, I I I don't know. This person might be a Salvation Army, but I'm sure they love Jesus. And I said, this person over here maybe is a Baptist. I'm sure they would say they love Jesus. This one may be a Pentecostal. This one may be a Catholic. This one may be a Methodist. And I went around the room. I said, "I I don't know who's here." I was a total stranger. And I said, "I'm sure that you all would say I love Jesus." And I said, "But this word, the scripture says that Jesus is the word." And I just happen to know that you all don't believe the same word. So I said, "I'm just wondering who has the real Jesus." &gt;&gt; I tell you, that was a quiet room. You people don't need to be that quiet. &gt;&gt; That was a quiet room. &gt;&gt; Anyway, brother Amy's brother and sister-in-law came into the knowledge of the message and walked right into the message from that time. And as a result, Amy did. Amy came to me and he said, I told my mother what happened. I told her that I was delivered from alcohol and she said, "Oh, I've heard that before and come back and tell me in six months." And he was really down in the mouth. He said, he said, 'They don't believe me. They don't believe me. He said, 'What should I do? I said, go back in 6 months. In 6 months, he went back. Says, hey, mom, it's 6 months. Says, oh, come back in a year. So, he came back all discouraged. I said, well, go back in a year. Well, I can tell you that Amy died in the faith. Amy died delivered. Hallelujah. And he told me, he says, "I could have I could have found all kind I could have poked all kinds of holes theologically in this message." But he said, "I knew one thing. This was my last chance. Ah, this was my last chance. I I had to believe this with all my heart." And it worked. &gt;&gt; He just believed it. He just received it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what it was? It wasn't it wasn't thunder and lightning and flash of uh you know flashing thunder. It was a still small voice inside &gt;&gt; and he believed it and accepted it. &gt;&gt; Now it was an unusual thing. Maybe it was an unusual moment. You can all go back to it. In this in the simplicity of this moment, I want you to go back to the time that perhaps you might think or remember when that mantle, it didn't have to be Elijah. It it might have been your parents, your a workman, associate, your neighbor, could have been anyone. Maybe you grew up in a home. I don't know exactly when it was for you, but I know when it was for me. And you might say, "Oh, uh, you know, Brother Bisco, you're so fortunate you're able to be with God's prophet." And that it was. But I can tell you that I had those questions which were plaguing me. Questions which were tearing me apart inside. Questions which I I was almost ready to give up on. And then to know just from about four scriptures, four scriptures were mentioned. Now it didn't have to be brother Brandham but God ordained that it was. And that was the day I can say here before you. The mantle was cast onto myself, the mantle of the word, and I could never escape it. And I go back, I go back probably hundreds of times. I go back to that moment when the word anchored and I couldn't escape it. And I would urge you, each one, do the same thing. There was a moment. Do you know why I'm doing that? I want to give honor this morning &gt;&gt; to the still small voice. Because that's not my voice. That's not your neighbor's voice. It's not your parents' voice. It's not a preacher's voice. That's his voice. Some of the most important junctions of our life has happened and seemed like a non-event at the time. Some of the most important junctions in your life happen so ordinary and this may be just a totally ordinary service and I want it to be that but some of the most important junctions and this may be one of the important messages in your Christian experience if you can just come to a certain kind of a realization and a certain resolve within your own heart. Now, Elijah, now I'm just really trying to watch my time, but now we're starting a little bit of a journey. Elijah takes Elisha on a tour. And every one of us, every one of us have to go on that tour. And he started at Gilgal. And from Gilgal they went to Bethl. And from Bethl they went to Jericho. And from Jericho they went to Jordan. And I I I I want to say this very quickly. Every person individually in your individual walk, you need to go to those stations. &gt;&gt; Amen. and God will lead you to those stations. And also I want to overlay it that actually the message within the message itself there's there's a progression within the message &gt;&gt; from the time that it came and it's gone on that same tour if I had time to it's gone from Gilgal &gt;&gt; to Bethl &gt;&gt; to Jericho and to Jordan and Jordan is separation. And I feel that within the message perhaps too many of us are somewhere along the road but we really need to experience and come to the separation. &gt;&gt; And the prophet declared it and he spoke it and I'm going to give you some I'm going to give you some examples, some quotes. Jordan is death. &gt;&gt; And God help I don't want to get ahead of myself, but death is not easy. Death is not pleasant. This kind of separation is is not something that the flesh revels in. It's something the flesh resists. It's something the flesh runs away from. But I want to take these stations. And then he said that then he started from Gilgal and this is the message witnesses and went on to the school of the prophets. And I want you to notice when he got up there at the school of the prophets, he said, "Lord, the Lord's leading me to Jordan." Three stages that Elisha followed Elijah. And Elijah was a type of Christ, Elijah. And Elisha is the type of the church. &gt;&gt; Are you the church? &gt;&gt; We we we're in this journey. And he says, "I I go to Gilgal first uh uh justification by faith and then now uh stay here church." Elijah, he says, "And the young and the old prophet, a type of the church in Christ." And he said, "As your soul lives, I'll not stay here, but I will I am going with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to announce to the word to the believers of the word today. This word is not a stationary doctrine. &gt;&gt; This word is not a stationary revelation. &gt;&gt; It's not something definitive that you can ever put in a box say I'm a believer. No, it's it's more than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message is a moving message. &gt;&gt; The message is a it's we're in a transition time even right now. And I thank God. I want to enter into that transition time. I want to enter because it's going to be this word that's going to take you people from this world to another one. &gt;&gt; We must be in this word as it is moving a moving word. It's a continuous revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so Gil Gaul, Gilgal is a an extremely significant place. Gilgal was the first encampment of the children of Israel when they crossed Jordan into their inheritance. The first place in their inheritance was Gilgal. And it actually means a like a wheel. The the word is in the Hebrew a wheel or a rolling a rolling off. And the reason why it's so important because when they crossed over and uh Jordan separated them from the wilderness and this was the first encampment as our first station, the first sight, the first place we settled down in our inheritance. Oh, I've been born again. I've I've arrived here. No, that's just the first sight. That's just the beginning. And God was testifying because he said, "And the Lord said unto Joshua, this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off of you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day. I've rolled I've rolled all us all that weight of sin off of you. I've separated you from this wilderness experience. I've separated you even from the mana of the past. You're going to eat the old corn now. You're going to come back to the original. Now, &gt;&gt; you're not going to have to live by that murmuring and live by uh, you know, just from one day to the other, crying for flesh and crying for mana and crying for something else. You've got now the original word. You've got the spoken word, which is the original seed. Can this congregation respond to that? &gt;&gt; Is that what you're feeding on? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can take experiences from the wilderness and maybe speak on them, but there's one thing for sure. We've come not only to Gilgal. We cannot stay there at Gilgal. That's only where we start. &gt;&gt; And Elijah, Christ is going to take the church from Gil. I've got to go on from Gil. It wasn't only the first place of the encampment to to designate we've inherited this place. Our feet now are starting to claim our inheritance. That's wonderful. But that's just the beginning. &gt;&gt; And it's surprising how many people get there and stay at Gilgal. &gt;&gt; We're not staying at Gilgal. &gt;&gt; We're moving on from Gilgal. &gt;&gt; Gilgal was also the first place where they had the uh the sanctuary. it here. Here here's the several things about Gilgal. It was the first place of the encampment of the children of Israel after they crossed the Jordan. And from there they launched their conquest. It was from Gilgal that they began to move out and to and to take over the land and they to take over Jericho as well. And then it was it was the first place that the the angel of the Lord appeared at Gilgal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, if you came into your inheritance, you did so with the visitation of the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the angel of the Lord that brought this revelation to us. And the angel of the Lord is none other than the spirit of Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? The very one, the very person of the pillar of fire. The very one whose presence was there. The very one who made people tremble. The very one who the prophet said their facial features would change when they entered into that presence. You're in that presence. Say, "Oh God, put me in tune. Oh God, get me in the channel. Oh God, the God of that still small voice. Let me regard it today. Let me respect it today. Let me love it today. Let me give myself to it. Let me yield to it. &gt;&gt; Don't just sit here. &gt;&gt; Don't just say this is another Sunday service. In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to yield to that still small voice. &gt;&gt; I I urge you with everything that's in me to regard it, to give it esteem. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your program is. I don't care what your thoughts are as a servant of Christ. I say, "Lay that down. &gt;&gt; Lay that all down. &gt;&gt; Say, I come here to regard that still small voice that has called me and drawn me, and that's why I'm sitting in my seat. &gt;&gt; I'm not here as an accident. &gt;&gt; I'm not here just as a series of circumstances. I'm not here just because I came for a a better life or a different answer. No, that's not why I'm here. I'm here, oh God, because you spoke &gt;&gt; and I heard a still small voice &gt;&gt; and I've come out of my cavemen. &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm sitting here in church this morning. &gt;&gt; If this ever reduced just to a church service, that's all it'll ever be to you. It was the first appearance of the angel of the captain of the Lord's host. Joshua said, "Are you force or are you Guinness? Who are you?" It was the first time that they could have a realization. I'm in the land. &gt;&gt; Take a look around. &gt;&gt; 40 years &gt;&gt; we've been trying to get in the land &gt;&gt; and here we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How long's this message been on the way? &gt;&gt; It's been for over 40 years. &gt;&gt; But I think there's a group of people that's rising up &gt;&gt; and realizing what God really sent to us. &gt;&gt; And I'm doing everything within my power. everything that I'm yielding myself to the Holy Spirit today to deliver this word to this waiting congregation. That's a still small voice is the same one that was in that pillar of fire speaking who the prophet spoke through. &gt;&gt; Was that Elijah? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And what did he cast on this people? &gt;&gt; He cast the word on you. &gt;&gt; He's cast that word on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you've been touched by it. &gt;&gt; Your very presence here today is a witness either for you or against you. &gt;&gt; Because you're saying by sitting here, I have been touched. &gt;&gt; I have felt the I have felt the weight of that mantle upon me. &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God help me. &gt;&gt; Our feet are standing. on holy ground. From 1963, Brother Brandham began to use the phrase the promise of this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he may have said it other ways prior. I'm just saying, and don't misunderstand me, but I'm I'm not trying to make an issue. I'm just saying that I find it I find these things very interesting, very significant and very curious and I'm raising it to you. The promise of this day in the message once more, he said, "I only want one thing and that's the support of Jesus Christ by his word. Let him vindicate that I'm telling the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. by his word, not some bogus makebelieve, unscrupulal thing, but the genuine Holy Spirit himself &gt;&gt; who takes the promise of this day and shows that it's the truth &gt;&gt; and he has not changed. &gt;&gt; I cannot make it happen. He's the one who makes it happen. &gt;&gt; He, the Holy Spirit, who's the author of this word and the revealer of it, takes this message and reveals it. not merely reveals it but causes it and causes it to be vindicated as the truth &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; And if you're here today and have still remain bound perhaps from a wandering in the wilderness, I can say to you, this is your opportunity to cross Jordan. &gt;&gt; This is your opportunity to be separated from that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In anointed ones of the end time, he also said, "You are a separated people." May I hear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Holy unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Dedicated to the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God to bear fruit of this promise of his promise of this day &gt;&gt; you're here. &gt;&gt; That's why God brought you. &gt;&gt; That's why God has done what he has done. So that you might bring forth the fruit of the promise of the word of the promise for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's why a denominational seed can never make it work. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's why you can't bring something in from, well, I was taught this back in the Lutheran or back in the Methodist or back in the Pentecost. That won't work. &gt;&gt; That's another seed. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just give another very important aspect of yielding. In the Bible, to yield is not merely, in fact, in the Old Testament, to yield was the yield. Your your crops shall yield, &gt;&gt; your vineyards shall yield, the yield of the field, &gt;&gt; it was the the what was produced, &gt;&gt; right? What was the final conclusion? You will plant your crops, but it will yield. And if you'll follow me, it will yield. &gt;&gt; That same we have well I want to yield to the spirit of God. Yield to the still small voice. Yield which means to move in that direction. &gt;&gt; Not to be forced and pushed and beat into that direction. I don't believe in that. It's to yield. I give myself to it. &gt;&gt; And in giving yourself, you cannot give yourself without forsaking something else. &gt;&gt; I have to forsake and that happens to be Jordan. &gt;&gt; I'm forsaking my own thoughts. &gt;&gt; I'm forsaking my own aspirations and opinions and my uh my ambitions. I'm forsaking that. Oh God, what is your will? I would like to do this or I would like to be that. But what is your will? &gt;&gt; And I yield myself to it. That's one form of yielding. But as you do that, you fulfill also the Old Testament part of yielding is that as you yield to his voice and yield to his spirit and that and the spirit of Christ begins to flow through you and manifest himself through you. What comes out of your life, your life, you're a tree yourself and you're yielding the fruit, &gt;&gt; the result &gt;&gt; of this word for this hour. &gt;&gt; See friends, if we come into this message and we happen to have in brother Brandham's language, we have a temper like a buzzsaw. And years later, we still have a temper like a buzzsaw &gt;&gt; that has not yielded &gt;&gt; the fruit of the life &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We still have our old canankerous nature, our old whatever more. No, it's the spirit of Jesus Christ. How I hunger, how I long for that spirit. You might say, you know, Brother Ed, I I'm I'm thinking of certain things right now. Well, I would encourage you just listen to that still small voice. What is he saying? And he's inviting you to come to the front of that cave. Come out of this dark spell. Come out of this dark moment. Don't live there any longer. &gt;&gt; You don't have to run from anybody any longer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You're a separated people to bring forth the fruit to bear the fruit of his promise of this day. Brother Brandham talks about him being the rose of Sharon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said that the priest needed to be anointed with the oil and the fragrance. And he said the fragrance of the rose of Sharon. He said that's why he had to be crushed. He was crushed. He was crushed at Calvary. Not merely to give us not only to give us salvation but to give us a different life &gt;&gt; that we would actually have a perfume in this world. &gt;&gt; Have a fragrance. What a wonderful life it is. the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And then quickly they would go from Gil Gal. Are you traveling with me? &gt;&gt; They would go to Bethl. And the Bethl is the house of God. Bethl is where Abraham first built an altar and sacrificed. Bethl is where Jacob dreamed a dream. And at Bethl he saw angels &gt;&gt; descending and ascending from above. And then from from Bethl they would go to Jericho. And Jericho was the first city of conqu that was conquered. Jericho was where Rahab lived on the walls. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that we have a message that that unveils to us Rahab's part. Rahab, this harlot woman who who believed and put the token where it was supposed to be &gt;&gt; and we could say so much about her but we I just want to say that she believed for her whole family. She lived in the most dangerous of places but in it is this message that reveals that woman's part in actually Joshua was conquering the rest of the land because she hid the spies. That was the great thing. She hid the spies. And that keeps being referred to that she hid the spies. And because she hid the spies, she was taken into the whole economy of God and became one of the mothers of Jesus Christ. Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, what an honor. You say, &gt;&gt; could that be? &gt;&gt; Not only could it be, it was. &gt;&gt; That is exactly what happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there's nothing spectacular about her life. What is it that a couple men come and then you finally hide them and and even deceive uh the king and the messengers that came from the king and so on so forth. She was so determined on protecting them. &gt;&gt; You know what she was doing? She was protecting the message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I hope this congregation is as committed as I am to protect this message. &gt;&gt; It has every kind of enemy, every kind of subtle device. And I'm determined within with the power of God to protect the word of God &gt;&gt; and to hold it high and to hold a standard high. And that that it's incumbent upon us. It's part of our responsibility to hold it high. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hold it above reproach. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Jericho, a great victory. &gt;&gt; And we've had great victories. And I'm sure that you that are sitting here, you can point to some place in your back in your past and you can identify and say, "Brother Biscoll, I'd been there. I'd been to Jericho. Oh, how wonderful to have my victory at Jericho. Maybe your first conquest when you came into the land. &gt;&gt; But we can't stay there. &gt;&gt; You can't stay there at Jericho. We must move on. from our earlier victories. &gt;&gt; Now we come to the last station and it's Jordan &gt;&gt; and it's not a pleasant uh it's not something that the flesh wants to get enthused or excited about because brother Brandham always identifies it as death. Not death in the flesh a death to the world. in Elijah and Elisha. He says, "Now the third stage is coming on." Now you might say, "Well, there was Gilgal, Bethl, Jericho, and Jordan as four." But remember, they were already at Gil Gaul. So they moved from Gil Gaul to the others. And uh and so now he says the third stage is coming on, but the church still just in case that leaves a question in your mind from where you went, brother Bam talks about justification. And he said he'll call justification. So we go justification, sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he talks about the three stages. But then in other message he says and then he said there is the Holy Ghost himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said justification. This is how he said it. And just hold it. &gt;&gt; And I don't care what you think. This is what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Justification made room for sanctification. Sanctification made room for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And the baptism of the Holy Ghost made room for the Holy Ghost himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do I need to repeat that? &gt;&gt; Surely not. And the Holy Ghost and the baptism because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost himself is a person. &gt;&gt; That is him. &gt;&gt; That is the very life of Christ himself. So the baptism of the Holy Spirit, yeah, we need that. Everybody needs that. But it makes way for the Holy Ghost himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said in Elisha and Elijah just another few minutes. He says, "Now the third stage is coming on, but the church still follows on. Elisha following Elijah. And when he said gets down to the Jordan, Jordan is a meaning of separation or death. You've heard many times when I come down to the Chile Jordan, Jordan was death. The Lutheran age followed by and so did the Methodist age. But we come to another age now, the age of dying out. &gt;&gt; He said all your worldly pleasures. &gt;&gt; God has got to do something with you in order for you for he could before he could give you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to die out. Get dead. You don't die out. He said, you remember life can only come out of death. &gt;&gt; Life can only come out of death. A seed can only die. Anything else can only die. And out of death comes life. Out of the death of Christ comes the resurrection of life. &gt;&gt; The only way that you can tonight become alive of faith in God is to die out to yourself and symptoms. everything around you. We need to be acknowledging that. &gt;&gt; Die out to symptoms. Die out to everything around you and become alive. Die out. Die out to symptoms. Die out to the circumstances. Oh, this congregation, we need to die out to the circumstances. We need to die out to the symptoms. If you're here and you're sick, you need to die out to the symptoms. But I'm talking about even greater symptoms and circumstances and die out to everything else and become alive in Christ. Can't say just die out and become alive. We need to die identify those things. I need to die out with those things that are troubling me and separate myself and yield to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing how much time is spent of our mind and our brain cells is taken up with life with life that's passing. And we need to uh I I believe we need to turn. I would urge you to yield yourself. I don't care where you are. You're getting dressed in the morning. Have your mind upon God. What's wrong with that? Not worried about the day. Not worried about, you know, what what's going to take place the rest of the time. not worried about, you know, maybe your studies or your work or your schedule. We all have that and it will always, friends, hear me. It'll always be the same. &gt;&gt; It'll never change. &gt;&gt; The devil is not going to change Satan's Eden to make it easier for you to be spiritual. &gt;&gt; You have to take it and the violent take it by force. &gt;&gt; It will take effort. &gt;&gt; It will take resolve. It will take mental fortitude. &gt;&gt; I am going to think on spiritual things. &gt;&gt; I'm going to think on heavenly things. &gt;&gt; I'm going to spend as much of my energy as I possibly can for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Die out to self and become alive in Christ. And the message paradox. He said, "Now you see, you see what coming down to the Jordan meant." He said, "We're down here now." &gt;&gt; We're down here now. &gt;&gt; This is amazing to me because this is 1961. Brother Brandham has just he's had the experience in the first part of 61 of going beyond the curtain time. This is just prior to within a very few months. He's going to have s is this the time the vision of the seven angels coming. Three months later, the seals are going to be open. And now this is right in this vortex, right in this junction. As Elijah was in a junction, this Elijah was in a junction at that time. And we're with him. &gt;&gt; We're part of it. &gt;&gt; We're listening to it. We're heing it. &gt;&gt; What did you say, Elijah? &gt;&gt; What did you say? &gt;&gt; You've cast your mantle on me. Where are we? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe somebody says, "I just been baptized." All right. And you're on your journey. Someone else been here 10, 20 years. You're on your journey. But we cannot stay. We cannot stay uh uh just at Gilgal. We can't stay just at Bethl. Oh, this is a wonderful place. We're offering sacrifices here. I'm just living this kind of life. We can't stay there. We can't go on. We can't just stay, I've had such wonderful victories. I remember when God did this at Jericho, etc., etc. We can't stay there. We got to move on to Jordan. We got to feel those chilly waters on our feet. &gt;&gt; We got to cross over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Knowing that the real inheritance is on the other side. &gt;&gt; We must not say within ourselves, well, I we've got it all here or I've been here and I've had this and I've enjoyed this for all these years. We need still to move on because we haven't got everything that we need. &gt;&gt; We haven't got everything that we want. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listening to brother Lance's last service and and a cry of his heart and soul, I could just feel the impulse that was gripping him. We don't want a God of word only. We want a God of of dynamics. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not enough for me to talk about a boy in India that fell on his head and lost his speech and was healed instantly and began to say, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." Clear as I'm saying it, &gt;&gt; that's that's God. But I can't live back at that conquest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've got We've got walls right now that need to go down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have walls now that need to go down. We've got things we've built around oursel, maybe complexes we've got around ourselves and they need to go down. You need to have a current victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm in the middle of this victory. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. just quickly. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's cross over now. We're down here now." &gt;&gt; And I know that he was saying this 1961, over 45 years ago, but that's just as current as it can be as it was in last night's newspaper. It's more current than that. And maybe somebody right here is here at this moment. We're down here now. Let's cross over now. Let's quit playing. Let's cross the other side cuz it's because it it all belongs to us. &gt;&gt; It's all ours. &gt;&gt; Them visions has never failed. &gt;&gt; They can't fail because they come from God. And I believe it with all that is within me. We're not a hirling. &gt;&gt; He wasn't a hirling. He wasn't saying these things to make us feel good. He was saying it because it was God's word. Thus sayith the Lord to this generation. &gt;&gt; I take it &gt;&gt; I take it as though he was speaking to Cloverdale Bible way. And even if he was speaking just to us alone, that's all my concern is. He these things have been spoken for you and I. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm very very determined with this word this morning, friends. I'm very specific. I'm very zeroed in. &gt;&gt; I'm coming right to your address and mine as well. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said we'll cross Jordan is what he said. I'm not a hireling to run back into the wilderness. &gt;&gt; He's not taking us back into the wilderness. &gt;&gt; He's not taking us to the Old Testament law, the Old Testament tabernacle and the in the mana in the Old Testament into the water from the rock. That was water for that season. &gt;&gt; We're going into the promised land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got wells of water that they knew nothing about back there. &gt;&gt; And he said, "We'll cross Jordan the separation." &gt;&gt; God, break to us the seals. &gt;&gt; Hear what's he's crying out in his heart. &gt;&gt; That's what he was crying. &gt;&gt; God, break to us these seals. &gt;&gt; And it was going to happen in just a few months. &gt;&gt; Did God hear that, Elijah? &gt;&gt; He heard him. And I am here today pacing over this po over this platform saying thank God &gt;&gt; that he not only heard it and God did it but he cast that mantle over our shoulders. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we felt the we felt the impact of the word the mantle of the word and nothing can satisfy us anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yield to that still small voice. &gt;&gt; Say yes to him. &gt;&gt; He said, "And break to us the seals that's on the back of the book." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let us enter into this great place now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For Joshua divided to the people their inheritance that God had left for them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To yield. I think of what uh what George Mueller said. How many know George Mueller's name? Let's see your hands. Good. I won't describe who he was, but he was a great man of God in his time. He says, "And he he was asked once the secret of his service to God." George Mueller said, "There was a day when I died. Utterly died." And as he spoke, he bent over lower and lower, lower until he almost touched the floor. Died to George Mueller. &gt;&gt; His opinions, he said, &gt;&gt; "His preferences, &gt;&gt; his tastes &gt;&gt; and his will &gt;&gt; died to the world. its approval &gt;&gt; or its censure &gt;&gt; died to the approval of of or blame even of my brethren and friends. And since then I've studied only to show myself approved unto God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't need the approval of the world. And we don't care about the censure of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're trapped in the censure of the world that will censure this message. We don't we're not interested in it. He also said we must consider times and seasons. And he used to say, George Mueller used to say, is this the Lord's work? Then is this the Lord's way? And last and not least, is this the Lord's time? I can tell you that this is the Lord's time. &gt;&gt; This message has been allotted to this time. &gt;&gt; You will never find anything so current as this message. You may have come here for years and heard it, but this this Sunday is not the same as last Sunday. &gt;&gt; This word is a moving word. &gt;&gt; And if you stayed where we were last Sunday, you're not going to be where the word is this Sunday. You need to say, "Well, how can I assure myself stay in a in a yielded state? &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's speaking to you. &gt;&gt; He's talking to you &gt;&gt; deep down. He's talking to you. If you'll just if you'll just pull the shades back, you'll you'll hear that voice, &gt;&gt; that little resentment that came up. Don't yield to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Seeking approval of people or seeking approval of the world, don't yield to that. Yield to God. Yield to Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to move on forward. &gt;&gt; If it's a battle, praise God, there'll be a victory. &gt;&gt; I don't want to stand there and whimper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to look at it. &gt;&gt; To yield is to move or to bend under pressure or when the force is applied to stop opposing or resisting and agree to somebody's demands or respects. I I I I agree with the demands of the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to close just a few minutes, but I'm very, very touched and I feel that I would do an injustice to the Holy Spirit if I didn't bring this last part. And this part has to do I've been in this message, this message right here, God called Man, and I have felt very affected. Not because I have had a uh such a close contact with all of the young people, but I have much closer contact than perhaps many know. And I speak to them, pray with them. And brother Brandon talks about a God called men and he said, and he speaks about Goded men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Men who have felt the mantle of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and women too, girls too, ladies too. But we have felt the mantle of the word of God. But he said he's he talked about a God God trained man. Not a man trained man. &gt;&gt; Not a selfmade man. &gt;&gt; Not a father and mother trained man. &gt;&gt; Not a preacher, not a Bible way trained man, but a Godtraed man. And the only way we can have a God-trained man is to have that man hear the voice of God. Hear the still small voice and yield to that voice. &gt;&gt; And he speaks of this man. He said he had done had a taste of heaven in his soul. These are just isolated statements. Have you had that even once? Do you remember you had a taste of heaven in my soul? He said he'd already felt the power of God. He knew there was more for him. He says, "Oh you sons of God, move out into that sphere yonder." And when I was reading that, I was taking it personally. I just said, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; channel me into that sphere out yonder." It might just be a breath away, but channel me into that sphere. I'm telling you as a precious precious people here that have come to to this service this morning. You could have been doing other things but a still small voice called you and you have tasted &gt;&gt; of heaven in your soul. You have tasted of God. And it doesn't matter how long ago that was. That's one thing you can never get get away from. &gt;&gt; You can just sense how you savored it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Oh, sons of God, move out into that sphere yonder, fearless, &gt;&gt; fearless. Take God at his word." &gt;&gt; I just can't tell you how, &gt;&gt; how that has affected me and how inadequate I feel when I read that. And I'll tell you why. Because the prophet of God, he moves right on. He gives us the example. He moves right on and takes the people and essentially friends, we do not have to cow tower live under. &gt;&gt; That thing that Satan is trying to impose on a person, be it physical, be it spiritual, be it mental, or be it any other thing. I declare today that this God has spoken so that that power is broken. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all we have to do is believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why he just called the people up right then and began to lay hands on them or do whatever or just speak to them and he just spoke to them the word of the Lord and revealed their problem and told them to go. He didn't do that. That God that was doing that one after the other after the other. Didn't matter who they were. Didn't matter where they come from. Didn't matter what their background. Didn't matter what church they were from. the same God have the same answer for the same person for the for every different person. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He he said something. I just want to drop these in. I just want to take maybe five minutes. I'm already 10 minutes over my time. But brother Ram said he said, "I stood on top of the mountain and up there is the is the pygmy uh juniper. There's pygmy spruce up there. And you go down a little bit further and there's the hemlock. And you go down a little bit further and uh and they hit the pine. And go down a little bit further and they hit the quaking asp. And then you go down into the buck brush a little further and then into the grass and on down into the weeds and on down into the desert where nothing. He said, "Each one a cell and a life of its own." Speaking of the environment where it lives, they all have life. And one's way up at the peak and it's a pygmy spruce. and on down the pine and the mountain aspar desert said but each one is a life each one is a cell of life but they actually speak to speak of and give testimony of where where they're living &gt;&gt; the environment that they're living in &gt;&gt; saints of God this word came &gt;&gt; to give you a special environment. &gt;&gt; I tell you in the name of the Lord, if you live in this environment, you will bring forth the life that will speak of this environment. &gt;&gt; It'll be a message environment. And when Elisha followed Elijah and had just had that uh nonevent as it were, a mantle cast on him by the time he picked that mantle up and brother Brandham says, "Where is the God of the Lord Jesus Christ?" &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying today. &gt;&gt; He said, "Where is the God of Elijah?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is the God of the Lord Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're serving that God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I declare that God. &gt;&gt; I declare that same deliverer and that same savior today over this pulpit. I declare that he is truth and outside of him there is no truth. elsewhere. But I'm concerned about and interested in what God does right here amongst us. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to declare the word so that you can believe the word and the Holy Spirit will cause that word to live and your life will speak of the environment that you live in. &gt;&gt; We don't preach of darkness. We don't preach of bondage. We preach of absolute deliverance and absolute liberty because that's the word of truth. It'll be up to you to respond. &gt;&gt; It'll be up to you to say, "This is my hour. This is my time. &gt;&gt; I'm going to deny. I'm going to deny myself. I'm going to deny the enemy. I'm going to deny the devil. &gt;&gt; I'm going to deny the world." &gt;&gt; You'll come into a place that you never even knew existed. &gt;&gt; And this is it. You know what I feel is happening? I feel that we're training especially you young men that are here. Especially men that are here. I feel that the Holy Spirit is urging me to say you are in training. God is training you to go further than where you have gone thus far. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is training you and putting you through a training period. &gt;&gt; We don't have a Bible school as such and we won't have. But here's what here's what the prophet of God he declares at the end of his message. He talks about a man that could sing and yield himself to that and men that could yield themselves to something else. But he said, "But there's a spirit that comes down and I yield myself to it." I I'd like to just try to say this. He said he said like one place he said like one and one is two and two and two is four and four and four is eight. He said, "I just go deeper and deeper and it breaks into a vision." Now, that's very simple. You would think somebody just some profound psych, you know, psychoanalysis or psycho psychology or something. He's just talking about yielding when it comes. And that same Holy Spirit is present here right now. for people just to yield and surrender themselves to. He says, "I I I feel it coming down now." And he's got a woman in need in front of him. I feel it coming right down now. And he said, "And I just yield to it." He didn't do crazy things. He didn't do nonsensical things. People sometimes I've seen and maybe you have seen too where they they go, you know, wild and and and demonstrative and so on so forth. Well, you know, I was just yielding to the Holy Spirit. But when you yield to the Holy Spirit, when you yield to the Holy Spirit, the one thing it will do, it will burst forth with the fragrance of the rose of Sharon. It will burst forth with something and it might burst forth with some praise and worship. That would be perfectly fine. But it will break it will break forth as something and you'll you'll begin to see evidence of a life that you as an individual in no wise could live. And brother Brandham called about having meetings in India or Africa. And he said, "And then maybe a 100,000 converts are there." And he said, "I have no men to turn them over to." He said, "And then if there was men that could be they could be turned over to," he says, "then they could establish a little work and then from that work another work." And that's how it would go. That's what his whole soul was crying out for. &gt;&gt; Now, I thank God that that there has been and there is and there's churches all over and they're established and so on. But but here we've got uh we've got ablebodied, sharp, quickened mind. Men, I say don't don't don't surrender up just to this world &gt;&gt; and what it has and what it will promise you. There's a higher calling. There's something that's better than the 12 oxen. &gt;&gt; There's something that's better than the field. There's something that's even better than it has to be mom and dad and all our human relationships. I see people robbed because they can't let go of those relationships. But I can tell you one thing that God is calling &gt;&gt; and a still small voice &gt;&gt; and I went back over my life and say to you in all sincerity I've heard that voice and I desire to follow it with everything that's in me. I wonder if we I I would like to just uh sing that uh song if we could please. I want to sing a chorus. I've been a little bit longer than I wanted to be. I'd like to sing that chorus. Jesus be the Lord of all. Let's just bow in a moment of prayer. Lord God, God of Elijah, God of Elisha, God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, may the God that demonstrated himself in Jesus Christ, come and demonstrate yourself even now, Lord, more than word, more than preaching. Let the dynamics of the Holy Spirit which have been promised to us in this message, let it begin to take effect in the lives of the people at this time, at this moment. Now, I can't begin to describe what may have been taking place in your heart, but there's if there's something very specific and something that you are talking to God about, just those that fall into that category. God has identified his still small voice and he's speaking to you and you wish to stand and by so doing acknowledge, Father God, I acknowledge that that's you speaking to me and I am now thus giving evidence that I'm saying yes, I'm yielding to your voice just now. Have we sing please Jesus be the Lord of all. Yeah. Hello Jesus. Just be the Lord of all the &gt;&gt; Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all the king of all my heart. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all the king my heart. We're singing this together. Some joint prayer now. Jesus I surrender I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all. Jesus I surrender all the greatness of my heart. Oh Lord Jesus. How many want to pray together with me now? If you'd like to raise your hand. I don't want to end the service like another service. We want to do business with God. Move me out, Lord. Maybe you're at Gilgal. Maybe you're at Bethl. Maybe you're at Jericho. And we need to move on. I believe that there is a separation that is needed. Separate me, oh God, from my own thoughts. I can tell you we're waring against it. Even now, Satan doesn't want that. He knows that if that separation comes, there's such a such a destruction to his kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh father God, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that you'll give great discernment and give courage to your sons and daughters. Give courage to your children, Father, at this time that they will listen to and heed and have their ear tuned to the voice, that still small voice, that inner voice of the spirit of God. And I say, "Oh, spirit of God, speak on. &gt;&gt; Speak on. &gt;&gt; Tell us what you would have us to know. &gt;&gt; Give us the direction in our lives. Tell us what you'd have us to do. Tell us when we shall do it. Lord, I pray that we will move on. Oh God, take this congregation of people. Cause the lighthouse. Father, cause the light of this glorious word to shine on out. Father, let it ripple out further. Let these lives be a powerful testimony for you in the name of Jesus Christ. I claim that as our right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want the congregation to come in praying behind me. &gt;&gt; Want you to pray and speak out your own heart. Oh God, we're not under any time restraint here. Oh God, &gt;&gt; you see the heart, &gt;&gt; let the people speak their heart. Let them pray their heart. For you said to call upon you. When your people call upon you, call upon your name, you will hear from heaven. Oh God, you'll hear. I'm praying this morning because I know you're hearing us. You're hearing us. You're seeing the hearts of the people. Don't let them get settled back, Lord. Don't let them be satisfied with Don't let them be satisfied with just the things of this life. Lord, don't let them be satisfied. Don't let them be caught up in it. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray a prayer of faith. Oh God, they'll be delivered from it in the name of Jesus. Oh granted, oh God, granted that everything we lay our hands to will be for the glory of the kingdom of God. Oh Lord, I pray you'll bless this people. Bless these families. Bless these young men and young women, oh God. And I pray that you will train young men for the kingdom, for the purpose of this word, Lord. Oh, what a great need we have. What a great need we have. Raise them up. Rear them up wherever they may go, wherever you may call them to, that they will be a powerful witness that no one will be able to withstand the word of witness that comes out of their mouth in Jesus Christ's name. We thank you, Father. We thank you, Father. We're moving on over out, Lord. We're moving further on. We're taking footsteps, which mean possession in our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; I feel the Let's all rise now. I hear the call. Same one. and his spirit to give my to me and I for I feel the I feel the I hear the Lord and his me and I Lord please take the like you just to remember I believe and I don't know when I don't know how but I believe that if you will accept it and men young men you be aware that you will sense and feel the presence of God in a different way around you not just talk I'm not talking about teenagers I'm talking about God needs stalwart men who know the voice of God and will move out in that realm. &gt;&gt; I pray that God will open up spheres, &gt;&gt; another sphere for you, another channel for you. &gt;&gt; Hey folks, we've got enough. There's any number of people that are just living down here in this world. But we need men living in the world that have God on their mind, &gt;&gt; have this voice on their mind, have this Holy Spirit on their mind, &gt;&gt; are living and digesting the word. &gt;&gt; And all of you sisters, what a what a powerful lighthouse you are. Don't give up on it whatsoever. Don't settle back on it at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what this that this world needs it more tomorrow than it needed it today. &gt;&gt; God bless you is my prayer. Heavenly Father, we're just asking now that you will dismiss us and give us time of refreshment as we speak about your word and we speak about your voice and what you're doing. We give you praise. I give you all glory. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Come down in a mighty way this evening once again. Come down throughout this afternoon as people speak about you. Oh God. Oh God.
