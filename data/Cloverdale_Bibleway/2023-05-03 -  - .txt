Christ's name amen amen amen just seems to be an Anthem isn't it that we have here I speak the name of Jesus become a favorite I'm sure of our hearts thank you musicians appreciate that we can turn to the scripture tonight and turn to second Samuel 15. I just want to pass greetings from our pastor brother biscoll he's sister Ruth they've been watching intently and there's connected and streaming and just so I'm enjoying the services they wanted to make sure that we passed their greetings along to you this one just a little note a little reminder for next weekend those that are 18 up just please just put your name register so we can order food appropriately if you plan to be there we'd like you to have a plate when dinner time comes or you'll fast for the weekend which is okay this might be unintentional I was so thrilled to hear Brother uh Matthew Wilson I know we've seen sister Ramona senior up there earlier in the last services and I've just been rejoicing What the Lord Has Done thankful he is indeed a Waymaker man I can know not too many months ago it maybe looked like a really dark path Amanda you look down as for sister Ramona brother Matthew but we can stand here today he said he made a way light in the darkness amen amen second Samuel 15. and we'll start at 19. well I'll back her up I'll go I'll go 13. how does that give you a little bit of back story here and there came I'll just go quickly and there came a messenger to David saying the hearts of man of Israel are after Absalom and David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem arise and let us flee and uh and we shall not for we shall not else Escape for absolute makes speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword the king's servant said unto the king Behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my Lord the king shall appoint we'll go into this a little bit later and the King went forth and all his household after him and the King left ten women which were concubines to keep the house and the King went forth and all the people after him and tarried in a place that was afar off in verse 19 now well 18 sorry and the servants all passed on beside him and all the cheriths and the pelotites and all the good tight 600 men which came after him from gath passed on before the king these are men that have been with him for quite a while verse 19 says then the king said to itai to get tight wherefore goest thou also with us return to thy place and abide to the king for thou art a stranger and also in Exile whereas thou camest but yesterday should I this day make thee go up and down with us seeing I go with her I may return thou and take back thy Brethren mercy and Truth be with thee and I answered the king and said as the Lord liveth and as my Lord the king liveth surely in what place my Lord the king shall be whether in death or in life even there also will thy servant be and David said to it I go and pass over and inside the get tight passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with him let's just skip over to uh second Samuel 18 and we'll just go forward just a little bit let's read a verse hopefully we'll be able to connect them together before you second Samuel 18 verse 2. and David sent fourth a third part of the people under the hand of joab and a third part under the hand of abishai and now this is David in Exile and they're working their way through over Jordan job's brother a third part under the hand also of ithai the guitar so they're broken into three parts and the King said unto the people I will surely go forth with you myself also and the people said Thou shalt not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they care for us but now Thou Art worth ten thousand of us look at what they how they thought of David their King Thou Art worth ten thousand of us think of it therefore now it is better that thou secure us out of the city so David did not go it that way let's just pray one more time Heavenly Father Lord we've read parts of your scripture Laura and I so in love reading Lord different accounts in your Old Testament and seeing Lord how you weaved who you are through the lives of these brothers and sisters and Lord different accounts of scripture Lord as you typed yourself in so many different ways Lord your scripture is so inspired how one can look at the Bible and read through it and not see Lord the weaving of Jesus Christ all the way through is beyond me but Lord I'm so thankful that you've opened our eyes to see this beautiful word with a message that you gave us to open our eyes Lord so we commit this service tonight feed us with your word we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you let me have your seats tonight I'm going to attempt to uh speak just a little topic something a little fairly just uh let's say basic but just down home and I'm so I'm going to title tonight and you're probably uh today's title I'm just going to call Semper Fidelis and so that's my title tonight nobody reads Latin that went somewhere long time ago semper fidelis well tonight we're just going to title it always loyal and that's what that means and we'll get into that a little bit but I want to speak a little bit about loyalty which you can see here in this scripture it's pretty hard to look at the at the subject of loyalty and not look at the account of David and his men and the Mighty Men and so I just want to maybe delve into a little bit of the topic and that's where we just took itai who was just a newcomer into the ranks so at this time and that's why David told him he said really you don't need to come with us you just got here you yourself is a is an Excel why don't you just go to your place you really haven't you haven't really had much uh you know you're you'd be pretty safe if you just stayed back go back don't need to run around and Exile with me and he said go but his his response was very similar to other accounts in the scripture which we might touch on but as the Lord liveth and as the Lord the king liveth surely in what place my Lord the king shall be whether in death or in life this was a commitment this wasn't just well I'll come along for the ride no he knew that maybe I could die he really just arrived why would he have any need to to connect himself with David and David's troubles but he had obviously made a journey to connect himself he'd come from I think one account says he's a Philistine origin the get tight and so he's come here he's he's seen something in David and he's now said in death or in life I'm with you all right this is the next this is the level of of itai's statement he said here and then on the flip side the people that what they thought of David in their loyalty to him with he was worth ten thousand to of them to to the people which showed you that obviously there was a two-way relationship between David and his people he was loyal to them and they were loyal to him that was pretty clear in these scriptures hopefully you got that much thus far but loyalty is is a pretty broad term it implies a faithfulness that is steadfast in the face of any temptation to renounce desert or betray so you're loyal loyalty is a strong word it really connotates the feeling or sediment you know of accompanying a sense of of Allegiance you know if you're loyal you're Allegiant to something you're very loyal and it it has a certain level of devotion applied to it and it it also if you're loyal to something or if you have allegiance to somebody it also then characterizes you have obviously have a love for some for that that person or or whichever it is you're loyal to and it's an enjoyable experience that's shared between in many cases maybe a sovereign or employer you know in loyalty it's a great quality loyalty it's needed much needed in the world today it's something that's you know kind of higher level you know it's truthfulness it's diligence it's Integrity it's faithfulness it's got all these literally bundled up into this word and and so loyalty though is I I think is is broken hard to find these days you know loyalty it's really the strict application of the golden rule it's the opposite of every uh of really the very human tendency to to look out for number one right loyalty doesn't do that loyalty it really puts the it takes the place or the law of self-preservation before the Divine Law of Honor or preferring one before yourself or prefer one another and so that's pretty tough for this age to be loyal because then I got to put somebody else before me and and therefore that's tough to do in this wonderful laodicean age and so loyalty it's it's it's broken and in fact uh you know I think even people maybe have a hard time understanding the concept if you go back in time loyalty was a big deal chivalry and loyalty and you know came for king and country and so really what we what our level of loyalty is our loyalty programs that's really our sense of loyalty I've got my my 18 loyalty program cards and that's the extent of my loyalty I go I'm loyal to this place because they stamp my card and they give me free things after 10 times or I you know buy them and they give me points I spend ten thousand dollars I get two points I need ten thousand points to do anything to buy a paper clip do the math it's about as good as it is but you carry them you've got your cards full of them and man that's the extent of loyalty these days yeah and when the next one tell us comes up with a good deal it's like throw that modem away and suddenly I've got uh Telus modem and Rogers has went out the door and six months later there's a new promo to out goes Telus modem in goes the Rogers modem loyalty nah no no no mortgage rates so ltd's got the better one I'm gonna go to RBC moving all my accounts over to RBC that's how loyal we are really at the end of the day you know some people they're pretty loyal to their car brands I've had Honda for a long time but you know that's about the extent of it you know so businesses they they drive hard because they really just want your money that's that's really all they're doing is they're actually really not loyal to you they're loyal to your dollar and as soon as they don't have your dollar they ain't loyal to you anymore is that how that works I guess we live in the same world huh yeah but I wonder if we treat God like a loyalty card you know it's if he gives me something while I'm sticking with him if he's given me the points I need or he's he's given me the you know the the healing I need well then I'm loyal but you know if I ain't getting anything in return while I'm moving on to my own ideas just another loyalty card in your spiritual pocketbook that's what the world I think treats God as you know I pledge allegiance to do loyal to a country I don't know if the state's still do but uh you know they pledge allegiance to the flag it's an oath it's a solemn promise and they they pledge that I know everybody says well I pledge allegiance to the flag and you know it's about 30 words long or so but I wonder if they really even know what they're doing you know I don't take if I was pledging something they gave each other a pledge was something I know where that comes from but uh that was a pretty big statement to pledge something you know he just don't so when you pledge to your country well you're you're putting yourself right on the the front line of the ranks and saying okay I'm going to stand for it anything that that I need to I'm going to give by all to my country I'm going to be loyal to it I'm going to uphold it standards I wonder if you want to do that sir Nathan Hale was one of the first U.S I think the first U.S uh spy and was killed as a spy back in 1776 I believe it was and he was loyal to Country and he said my regret it is it is said that he says this it's not totally confirmed but the history says that he regrets his last words were that he has but one life to lose for his country this was this was loyalty he wish he had more lives to lose and now if we spin forward consequently or coincidentally we have a coronation this weekend unbeknownst to me until I was doing some studying and we have a we have a king being crowned this Saturday I believe it is and uh and so they're having a you know the citizens are going to obviously around the globe are going to be watching as they pledge you know their allegiance to the king because something new is happening this time that they actually are allowing homage to the people to be done and so the Archbishop of Canterbury is going to enlist a course of millions they say to ask oh whoso desire in the Abbey and elsewhere to make an oath this is used to be just for nobility to say but now the people can join and say this is what they will be able to say I swear that I will pay true allegiance to your majesty and to your heirs and successors according to law so help me God yes this is what everybody can have to say and then after this after the uh followed by a Fanfare from the Archbishop saying God saved the king and in response the people will shout God save King Charles Long Live King Charles May the King live forever this is on the program this is what's happening this weekend yes the pledge [Laughter] this replaces the traditional homage of peers I said which was really just for you know the Royal Heritage but we want everybody now we're not going to be in exclusive we're going to include the world and allow them to be loyal to the crown and state this fact Unfortunately they didn't pull the public and when they did 85 percent of the public has no desire to give their loyalty to the crown so this is where loyalty lies and it's all but it's integrated in this age it's lost in our marriages and friendships and work and there's a lot of so much unfaithfulness because of the age and I wonder if that's how we did it in battle we said well forget it I'm just going to battle and it's for me and me alone it'd be a one-man battle everywhere and it'd be just a chaos there was there was a requirement in battle to be loyal because you fought his unified Force and so a soldier and I feel for me I feel like I should uh I feel like I could have been born back in those eras you know the 1200s I feel like I could have been a knight you know I feel like I could fight you know for for my king it just somehow was something in me you know but I think Lord maybe that's because I'm just fighting for my king not something in this world but in me and I would believe in a seed of God there's something that's like yeah I'm fighting for my king I've got a king you know people say well my lease yeah he is my lead he's my king of kings and I fight for him yeah yeah well you know King Arthur's days I liked those books thank you but people don't even know what that means anymore it's it's like really you know fight for a king the mentality is so shifted but I would hope that's not the case in the ranks of God's Army oh sir I would pray that there was an unwavering loyalty in this church tonight amen you know but it's easy to serve it's easy to be loyal when the going is good when everything is is fine and and wonderful but when things get tough like it did in David's day like it did when itai came it was a rough moment because David was being sent out of the Kingdom he was he was basically running in Exile before Absalom came along and the times were not easy and this is when you really find where your loyalty lies and you're seen really in their Kingdom what was happening and so people they can they can have their loyalty but but really when it when the battle stiffens then we find out where it is and if your loyalty has just been in a church and something ripples through a church and your loyalty is then shattered you're shattered you put your loyalty in some friend or your family and your family fails you and now you're sitting there well man your world starts to crumble you put it in a minister or a pastor and something happens and your confidence gets shaken it's because your loyalty has been put in the wrong thing your loyalty put should be in the very word of God in the word of God alone man will make mistakes churches will make mistakes but God's word never makes a mistake but Abraham says oh everything's all right as long as you got your name in the book you might have your name on a dozen books if it ain't the book of life you're lost he says you can never be so good you you can just be as loyal and clean and moral as you can be that won't have one thing to do with it you can say I come to church every service I'm as loyal church member as it can be it really don't matter actually what you're loyal to matters you need to be loyal to this and that alone amen loyalty to anything else but the anointed word of God it's got nothing for you because at some point it will fail and here if we go back in the story if you read you can go through II Samuel and first Samuel there's a quite the uh quite the accounts there but if we go back in there there was a time when out of Nigel was going to be crowned King because some loyalty shifted for joab had moved his loyalty which he should never have done and he moved it and thought that out of Niger one of David's Sons should be king and so joab and abiathar was going to take him to be crowned King David is now aged and hasn't really decreed who would he has but but they're trying to take maybe advantage and so their loyalty now to their own idea they're loyal to their own own thought on the matter and so now they're going to start to put things together and off they go they get some guests they kill some oxen and they're going to go have a party to Crown out of Niger King and so then Nathan and and uh Ben Anaya and zedok they they come to to David and they say wait a second it is not Solomon supposed to be king now let's let's type type to here and brother Brown says in a quote we'll get to further down the road David was the type of Christ and so David had what was going to be the direction for the kingdom David had the word for the kingdom and so Solomon was to be king and so here he decrees this and and and and brings benaniah and zyduck and they anoint Solomon and they bring him on the king's mule and here Port joab he's got his loyalty now misplaced over here and they prayed Solomon now down the street and they start to oh and now they start to cheer and this is a wonderful moment so here you've got somebody being crowned out in a different area and now you have David they've now they've anointed Solomon and he's getting crowned over in this area and so people say they're over where adonija is they're they're all you know they're having a good time until they hear sounds of cheering and again so they say what's that what's happening say well wait a second a Runner comes in and says they've just crowned Solomon King you know what happened in that very moment all their loyalty faded faded fast because they knew their loyalty was in the wrong spot but when things were going just okay you know and there was no Ripple in it that was fine they were they were feeling confident but the moment the error was found out oh my goodness you couldn't find nobody that was going to want to side without a Niger they were gone they were going this direction in that direction because their neck was on the line but those that were behind Solomon had confidence because they were following the word of the king they didn't have to be oh well I don't know can we cheer no tear King Solomon's on the throne and that's what the men with David as they came out of Exile they were confident that their lawyer who wear their loyalty was they didn't have to be like well should I be with David should I not no he's anointed that's who I'm following when you know you're following the word you don't have to Hopscotch around and look over your shoulder and wonder am I on the wrong right side no no you're on the right side I'd be wondering if you're on the other side that's when you should be should be a little scared but your trust your hope your faith your life should be placed in the anointed word for our day God's children don't it's in the worst times it's in the difficult times that's when God likes to show and bring out who's loyal to his word and not it's in the difficult moments you see where someone's loyalty lies and here as we read the scripture now we have David's Mighty Men needed really needed a real revelation of who they are following really if you look at the circumstance this is now the second time David had been on the run these men had been following him always when he was on the run from Saul many of them David was scorned he was a vagabond he had he had feigned craziness at Early times and they've kept following him all this time I put yourself in their shoes these are men they didn't just like well you know willy-nilly no these were Mighty Men and they had aligned themselves with David and David was not going through good times all the time this word has had difficult times and a small band of men looked beyond circumstances it was 600 at one point another scripture says 400 there's more but these were the men around and then there was a 30 which is even smaller group of them that were Mighty they're defined in scripture then there's even those that are the three and and Brad Brown says did you know David who he represented he represented Christ Christ was the son of David he said listen closely those Gentile Warriors many of them noticed they came from everywhere some of them were Gentiles some were even Jew but they they didn't know that they knew that the fugitive was anointed this is what matters they knew David was rejected by his own people they knowed the anointing was on them they could see it so they stood right by his side die or live they were Gallant men no matter how much the outside world didn't believe it they were firm and their loyalty I love the types in the Bible I wonder sometimes I read I just wonder I love putting myself into the types of the scripture I'm like yeah that's that's me that's me there or I read another account in scripture I'm like in Moses and different things I'm like yep that that's me I'd be right there with him I wonder if some people read the scripture I wonder where they put themselves I I really do are they able to put themselves on uh as David's Mighty Man I hope so that's where we all want to place ourselves and here David mighty man he came his own people kicked him out they didn't want nothing to do with him Saul run him out the head of denomination kicked him out have nothing to do with it the council kicked him out David was a fugitive he had gone wherever he could and there he was up in the mountains with a little group of men Gentiles and so forth and they looked at that man and they knowed he was the coming King man thou taking a revelation Big Time Revelation here they were before Saul when it was during Saul's time he's at the caves of agileum and these different accounts and they had to look at here's the man he's just in a cave I mean drinking stagnant water and food they could have scond or take get from other places that would provide for them they're on the run and they're like yeah he's King I'm following him some people like what are these guys they're crazy what are they following anyway just some cult out there let's put it down to our day who is this anyway is this it doesn't even make sense he's being run off it's not he's not unpopular it's it's just but there was a group of men there's a group of people that were loyal to the anointing so David ran from run from Saul he ran from Absalom David was on the Run both these times of rejection when David you think about it when David was running from Saul one one priest helped him out and gave him Goliath's sword and for that he was killed a bunch of other priests were killed in the whole village where the priest came from knob they were also slain men women children oxen because they'd helped David and then David had to wear that burden and the men that followed him loyal to him also had to carry that really what are you doing you had all these people killed because you helped like what you think think about what they had to live the heaviness of this but they stuck with him day in day out night in Night Out rejection and scorned and scoffed but they said that's the anointed king Absalom then he runs out David runs out now in that situation absent didn't like how David dealt with Tamar and Ammon and the story and thought he should have dealt with it now he stirs up the people and people start switching their loyalty and again David now is running out of out of the city of Jerusalem that's where the scripture he read started and what a turmoil again as David lazy packs up his family and he flees rejected and once again the loyal Mighty Men bind around so let's go we're with you through thick through sin through Darkness through good times through bad times their loyalty wasn't dependent on good circumstances and I wonder we will make sure that our loyalty to the word is not dependent upon great circumstances well I'm just doing wonderful my family's doing great but when I'm in dark times when my family's in a dark time when my wife is sick when my husband is sick when my lost loved ones are out in those times are you loyal amen I didn't see a scripture someone could point it to me but I didn't see one where through the up and down the Loyalty of those Mighty Men wavered I didn't see a scripture where it said well these 37 or the three but that one of the three he he he he he was always in scripture they were accounted as mighty men at David and so these Valiant Mighty Men had different Feats and battles you had the one that you know killed 800 with lifted up his spear against 800 and slew at one time that's a lot of people fill this place to the brink and then put the put me in the middle and be like all right bring it on you'll be like yeah we'll we'll take you out in 10 seconds no he didn't he took them out and whatever long it was these are Mighty Men Alias are son of Dodo and ahoite one of the three Mighty Men He arose smoke Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand claved to the sword they had to pry his fingers off the sword he had fought for so long these are Mighty Men of Valor he stood in the midst of the ground defended a ground full of lentils we have benoniah who who uh slew two lion-like men of Moab threw a lion in the midst of a pit slew an Egyptian large five cubits of spear the same as gliosphere Weaver's beam we had other Mighty Men of David that also slew Goliath's brothers so not just David David showed in the example the other mighty man said if he can do it we can do it if our God can do it he's given us the work so he can do it these Mighty Men not all of them Jew but they had a revelation Simon didn't even belong to Israel but David to them was the king didn't matter if they were Israel or not David was their King and so they accomplished these Feats for David not just women though not in this in David's sense but it's not just women that are mighty Mighty and Valor when there's a loyalty to to to where the loyalty is placed and I was thinking we can sometimes place our you know these Mighty Men of Valor what they've done and we can type and say rise up mighty event and sometimes our sisters are like what about us sisters you're mighty too I think because I go back to an equal Mighty woman whose name is JL and she also had a loyalty who jabin thought she was loyal to Canaan but her loyalty was on something else her loyalty was clearly on Israel and who she was fighting for who she was willing to fight for she had aligned that there and so she was loyal and faithful and here she had a devil come in her tent come on moms well you ever had a devil come into your home coming on your child or something like that come out of school there's an influencer where did that thing come from yeah this is where J.L was and so they thought she was at peace that little demon thought maybe they could enter your home and and be maybe be missed or maybe not be seen But jail refused to be loyal to anybody but Israel by her surely by her actions looked like she stood alone but tonight I wonder if there's mothers of this gospel you might feel like you're all alone in your little home but I say identify with JL maybe your spiritual walk has grown cold a little bit you can't remember the last time you've prayed maybe you've got little children you've allowed them maybe you're sticking them on some streaming device instead of taking care of them or your husband's home wondering if you barely have time for him and maybe when's the last time you put on a nice dress when he walked in the door and tell you revolutionized probably your marriage at that very moment but if any of those little imps or something come in your home I'd say like jail take a little take a nail of the word and nail his head to the ground he's a mighty woman Mighty and Valor claim back your walk claim back your loyalty to your savior maybe it's Deborah she was a judge of Israel road to battle with Barack the same this is the same time actually Deborah in jail we're also in the same time period essentially great women Valiant loyal to their King of Kings could we speak of Daniel who is told to stop praying stop worshiping stop praising Daniel you're going to be fed to a lion Den um his loyalty was to his God and it was not going to waver in the dark moment well I guess I for 30 days I mean that's all it is for 30 days I guess I could stop praying why not for 30 days I could stop opening my window maybe I'll just pray behind the window could have done these things don't tell me the devil didn't place the thought there but Daniel said no way I'm not going to alter my walk I'm not going to alter how I serve my God for any devil that's going to encroach his foot on my ground so open these windows I'm going to stand there boldly and I'm going to pray he did Paul so many ones in Scripture heresy he said so I worship God Hebrew boys we know how how often these were in difficult moments is when their loyalty to whom they serve who they said they served was now coming to the Forefront all right you say that you won't bow let's just see if you if you can put your money where your mouth is right and that's what's going to happen and that's what God and the devil's going to do you confess it you say it this is what I believe I stand on the word of God and then a trout comes and he's like all right let's just see where you stand on that and that's what happened in the Hebrew boys but our bam says they purpose in their heart in a prayer meeting one night amen Brothers a purpose in their heart in a prayer meeting one night amen you could be at a prayer meeting one night and you could be praying on your knees and we're purposing to say I'm going to live for this gospel and the devil's coming to say all right you're gonna bow we're not going to defile ourselves we was going to stand we was going to stand of God's word regardless of what the rest of the world said that's about a brown said they said so they said we're going to stand we're going to be loyal they're going to worship their God they're going to bow to the God of this evil age that's fine but not us all right so Nebuchadnezzar said well we'll just burn some of this Holy Roller religion right out of them brother Brown says could you imagine burn the holy ghost out of a man when the Holy Ghost is fire itself just you try amen he said fire fights fire amen you have the fire of God in you that don't matter what's on this age it don't matter how hot the furnace is you'll just walk right in there because you are fire amen he said I'll bring a fire that no man can bring but God's seeing the Loyalty The faithfulness of these Hebrew children oh my goodness brother Brandon he oh he encounts this one's so beautiful I know you've probably read it 1800 times I've read it so many but there the angel said Master look down they're fit have you we're they're fixing to burn up three faithful believers ah I can hear he says yep where and would I watch them all night long don't think his eyes not watching you you don't think when the Devil Makes then his his call of what he's going to do you don't think the Lord doesn't know that he's doing that you bet he does he's like all right I'll just take a look at this his eyes on the sparrow if he knows any sparrow that falls out of the sky you don't think he can see you or I when we're going through a deep dark trial oh yeah he's watching you he's watching you he said no no no no these are my loyal Faithful Servants he's got a keen interest to watch you because he wants to watch your life glorify him yeah he says oh I know he sees everything I hear warm what he says oh back there give me the authority he wants to wipe off wipe Nebuchadnezzar off the off the planet he says you know let me just go and watch Babylon off the face of the Earth he says I can't let you go and then Gabriel comes up he says in an account and draws his sword he said I want to chop them you know I'll just chop them right to death but I'm sure in about a split second Gabriel would be there and Nebuchadnezzar would be would be on the ground dead and there would be no fire but God said that's that's I believe you could do that but now it's not happened he said uh he said I can hear him say Well Gabriel you obeyed me since the day I created you but I can't let you go because he says I'm going myself because it's a man-sized job uh can you imagine God saying the story Gabriel but it's a man's size job I mean it's a god-sized job for me to go down there he says I can see him rise from his seat his robes drop off him way back there in the north and he talks about how he brings the Thunderclap clouds and all of all of this as he describes it which I won't take the time but then in a moment there as they walk into them flames you know what he says he says they're standing there Fanning away all the breezes like that talking over the future for them you wonder what they were talking about right there they're talking about their future right there what was going to happen he was given a little insight of what was going on Amen here this word tells you about your future in there your fourth man in the fire sent you a message in this hour to tell you your future in the Flames of laodice here you will not be consumed and while you're in there you've got a word that you can read and a message that you can pour over and it's your God and God's side God to tell you your future hey there they stood you know what the fire didn't go nowhere they were still in the trial You're Still In the Heat of laodicea I should say you're still in the fires of laodicea but there ain't no heat on you there's no smoke man no smell no no that there nothing of the age they were still in it the fire was all around them but they had one that could keep all the effects of it foot down why because loyal Faithful Servants to the Gospel of Jesus Christ would stand there and he back them up you loyal to him he's loyal to his servant in the time of need he just wanted to see are they going to do it are they going to stand for me God didn't wonder he was just waiting it's okay wormwood it's okay Gabriel they got it I'm just waiting for the moment when I can step on the scene same thing he did with Moses when he called and then he put in there amram trusted in the Lord their loyalty was in him he had spoke to them they knew Moses was a deliverer they knew he was a different child and they committed him to the river and God said bring down a legion of angels line up that now River on left and right and I'm going to go to the very end of it and wait for it because he's mine amen you think you're in a trial with crocodiles everywhere but you might have Legion of angels all the way down you're not you're never and at the end of it as the Lord said just come to me I'm at the end of your River [Applause] but this God you're God and my God he doesn't demand a loyalty in fact he doesn't demand it at all but he creates a relationship that you desire to be loyal to him in fact he begins by example a man he's loyal he's the loyal one he's always loyal always faithful he's not gonna he he's not going to desire commitment from you that he wouldn't do himself that's not our God David was a warrior he fought he led he provided he gave him dying loyalty to his people as Christ did for you and I that's why they could say no David don't don't you're worth ten thousand to us why because David had constantly gone all before them he led the way they knew he was a runny little boy and took a glass down he led and so therefore they desired I'm following him he was a type of our God who is the epitome of the motto of my title simpler Fidelis Semper Fidelis he's a covenant keeper he's a promise keeper Moses in Exodus and it came to pass in process of time the king of Egypt died the children of Israel signed by aside by reason of bondage and cried and their Cry came up to the Lord by reason of their bondage and God heard their groaning and remembered his Covenant amen God didn't go 400 plus years he's like oh I missed it I mean 400 years have passed oh my goodness oh no that's not our God he's loyal he's faithful to his promise he said to act for 400 years I will deliver your people Abraham and at 400 plus years God was just waiting Moses came to his proper time he said now's the moment I'm a promise keeper I'm a covenant maker and a covenant keeper [Music] he'll never let his word fall he's a coming his Covenant if it would break eternity would break it's impossible world will pass away God's word will never pass away Deuteronomy 4 31 says for the Lord that God is a merciful god he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the Covenant of thy fathers which he swear under them no forsake means it's to sink or to relax to let down to be disheartened to withdraw God will never withdraw he'll never abandon he'll never refrain he'll never relax he'll never let you alone he'll never be quiet he's gonna he's never gonna show himself slack as men count slackness not God and David knew of this faithful one David knew of this loyal one you just read his Psalms you know he knew who he had believed in amen David when he writes the Psalms in Psalms 136 you can actually read and if I read it you would unders you would know it right quickly because it's a Psalm that has every verse and has mercy endureth forever and it says another verse and his Mercy endures forever there's many verses there there's 30 26 that say and his mercy endureth forever this is a Psalm that David wrote but if you go into that psalm and you read the word mercy the word mercy is actually a Hebrew word called and it's not just Mercy as you would take Mercy it's actually indicating kindness loving kindness Mercy goodness faithfulness love acts of kindness oh he said it's it's this aspect of God it's his character of Truth and faithfulness Mercy steadfastness Justice righteousness loyalty all in one word it said it's actually impossible to try and convey what that word is in the in all of the English language and so the the translator put Mercy there but it's not just that it's the he said the moon the stars the rule by night for his mercy endureth forever that could be well his goodness endureth forever his loyalty endures forever it's faithfulness endures forever he's the love endures forever amen he's heading he slew the famous Kings he gave their land for a Heritage he said in who remembered I said our lowest state for his mercy endureth forever redeemed us from our enemies first faithfulness endures forever David knew who his God was he was a loyal God and he would write a Psalm about him Isaiah 54 said in the little rat in a little wrath I hid my faith from thee for a moment but with Everlasting kindness depart Everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee that Everlasting kindness is again said it's faithfulness it's love it's very it's loyalty it's acts of kindness all of that you say oh is Everlasting kindness no is his Everlasting faithfulness to you is this Everlasting loyalty to you oh the Bible's much deeper and richer than just face value Deuteronomy says no therefore the Lord that God he is the faithful God who keepeth Covenant and mercy again which is the word has said Exodus 34 and the Lord God passed before him proclaim the Lord the Lord God merciful gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and Truth keeping Mercy for the thousands and forgiving iniquity and transgression the whole scripture again the same word I said it's just filled with his faithfulness it's filled with his loyalty and his love for you and I the keeper of his word that's what he's loyal to it's his word he's the one who said seed will crush the head of the serpent did it happen it did because he's loyal to his word he will ensure that it happens he's the one who said Noah build an ark and a place of safety so that he would get through the flood did it happen oh yes it did he's the one who promised Abraham seed would be Sans as the seed and as the start of the sky and he have seat out of his flesh did it happen oh yes it did he promised Israel would go into captivity for 70 years did it happen some didn't want to but did it happen yes it did why because he's loyal to his word his Prophet speaker's word God's obligated to ensure it happens that's why even when Elisha spoke to she Bears though God is obligated for that to happen he said he would be wounded bruised bearing our sorrow did it happen yes because Isaiah spoke it the scripture spoken it happened because he's loyal to his word he said he'd raise a prophet like under Moses he said he'd be a savior he said he'd be a Healer he'd be a member of the Brokenhearted he said he'd send the Holy Spirit did it happen yes it did whether you want to say so or not it did because God is going to keep his promise you know if God could keep a covenant promise 400 and something years in the making you know to humanity that's a long time you'd be like that wow that's like let's put the watch on here this is we're in for Long Haul but God is tireless and he waited for it but if God can make sure that that happened through the course of generations you don't think that he's still able to ensure that his promises happen today I'd say if he can do that he can do anything if he can bring Humanity through a series of time bring it through a certain aspects and Junctions he can have prophets of hold through the hundreds and thousands of years speak certain things and then they happen all like this and then happen in one man Jesus Christ and prophecy fulfilled if he can do that do you think that he's can fulfill everything he said for this day John 14 18 I will not leave you comfort us but I will come to you amen yet a little while the world see me no more but see me because I live ye shall live also at that days you know I'm in the father ye and me and I in you Matthew 28 teaching them the last verse in Matthew lo I am with you always faithful one so unchanging loyal one always this last verse in Matthew always amen even to the end of the world it's second Timothy 2 13 if we believe not listen to this if we believe not this is scripture yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself I want you to ponder that scripture for just a little bit there was a time when you were lost in sin in wickedness and trespass in Dark Places maybe a time you're in a low low valley but he cannot as scripture says deny what himself who are you who are you we're Believers you've read the message what's inside of you himself because he's deposited his seed in you and that's why through the darkest of valleys even when scripture says if we believe not when you are in sin and trespass but he could not deny himself he would be faithful always to pick you up out of the muck in the mire and say there's a time when so and so I've got a time appointed I'm faithful I'm that God and I'm going to raise him up at that time you're his word you're a people that have eaten the book a man you've become the word he's faithful to you always faithful you have he quickened I wrote down here a god who's rich in Mercy loyalty to his seed and I wrote down he even went through hell for you that's your God he even went down to hell for you men might use that as some cursed phrase no he went there for you and I and stripped the keys that's your loyal God and you hathy quickened who are dead and trespasses in sin where in times past you watch according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air but God who is rich in Mercy who is rich in faithfulness who is rich in love who's rich in his loyalty to his people loyalty to his word and if you are the word he cannot reject you even when we were dead in sin have quickened us together with Christ amen you would play a little video for me I'm going to take a a little switch here or jerk your attention just one minute minute and a half of video I need sound but me means we're holding each other accountable stands for always faithful to the Core never turn your back on it [Music] what is someone that you can rely on like one time they're going to get tough you know that there's going to be someone there to back you up and it's going to be your fellow Marine that's on your left or your right so we're always faithful we're always there with each other we'll always be fighting for each other if we have nothing else left at the end of the day I will never be a part of anything else as big as this I think it speaks volumes of the character of Marines past present about what we both treat ourselves always faithful to each other to our country and to our families [Music] Eternal Bond hey I'm not even American I'm proud of them soldiers but they don't have an eternal Bond like you and I have I'm sorry they might carry the motto Semper Fidelis hmm but I said no way I was studying halfway through I had a totally different title and I came across that he said um that's my title that's exactly what my motto is always faithful always loyal that's what it means I'm sorry but at least one lady said I'll never be involved in something bigger than this sorry there is something bigger let's call it a battle for life and death and there's an army that's raging against the enemy and I'm part of that big army [Applause] I'd take semper fidelis my way you know what they say about that it demons to demonstrate that in Practical terms new recruits are told story after story of how Marines sacrificed in combat to remain faithful to their fellow Warriors and so they're constantly telling each other of a warrior I've gone by they're telling each other of a shamgar they're telling each other assumption they're telling each other of a David of people gone by saying you know them except for Philadelphia you know that person except for Phil Dallas you know any bisco except for Dallas look to each other and you say hey Stanford Dallas putting their lives at risk to save all the Marines refusing to leave one of their own behind alive or dead that's this Earth but not dead in this light in eternity because this semper fidelis this army goes through a prayer meeting on a Monday night and they're praying for those that are wounded those that are somewhere left in a battle and they're saying nah devil we're fighting we're going to be going to Warfare we're going to be telling each other semper fidelis always painful we can talk about Peter and Noah different ones who risk their life think about John the Baptist they would have been telling each other do you know what he did he put his life on the line he was preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ they cut off his head Semper Fidelis faithful loyal families moving here and there trying to uproot their families to grow and go maybe go to church many of you moved in here so your children could be in a school you're sacrificing your livelihoods you're sacrificing her ease why you're faithful to the cause you're faithful to the words I need whatever I can for my children Semper Fidelis story after Story encouraging each other in the faithful gone by and the faithful that are present you know what the rest says it says in many of the stories one Marine made a conscious decision to die in order to save the lives of others and so they tell the story this one died and it would start to well up something some comrade ship loyal to the Core and this commitment to semper fidelis was one of the reasons Marines enjoy the well-deserved reputation for Valor in combat because they encourage each other telling each other of different counts because they go to like I said and they gather together they edify but I said let me tell you of a story of all time of one that gave his life on a cross for you and I it is a no Marine which I respect but the king of glory came down to a stable to save Mankind and give salvation for all oh that's them for Fidelity that's always faithful I will sing of my redeemer and its precious love for me on a cruel crossy suburb paid the dead and made me free single thing that's what I'll say to the next one that builds up Valor in combat amen that's why they can say Leave No Man Behind comes into play here with the Marines it's burned into their being it becomes part of really who they are far be it from an Earthly Army Corps to have more Valor more loyalty more comment ship more faithfulness than the armies of the Living God Instagram that's why each one of us young old middle-aged teenage you need to be walking down the hallway at school he said how you doing Senator Fidelis faithful loyal or are you just pretending we don't need feigned loyalty not feigned loyalty because what happens there after a time I don't have time to get into it that that manifests itself so if you need loyalty you need to pledge allegiance not to No Flag but to the word
