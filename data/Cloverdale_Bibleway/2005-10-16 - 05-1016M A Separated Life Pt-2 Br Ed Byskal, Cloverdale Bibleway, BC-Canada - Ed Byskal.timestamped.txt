[13:53] Amen. I'm going to ask Brother Derek
[13:56] Paris, Brother Derek, if you'd come and
[13:59] open the service in a word of prayer.
[14:03] [Music]
[14:07] There's there's some things this morning
[14:10] people have on their hearts that they
[14:14] want the Lord to give ear to and uh some
[14:19] testimonies of thanks. Sister Lorie Snow
[14:21] wants to thank the saints for praying
[14:23] for her mom during her surgery.
[14:27] Although the surgery was unsuccessful,
[14:28] they were able to place her on medicine
[14:31] uh to help her and uh want to continue
[14:34] to pray strength for her and also she
[14:37] wants to thank everyone for praying for
[14:38] her brother Richard. Remember we prayed
[14:41] for him. God is doing miracles in his
[14:43] life. He recognizes it is the Lord. Just
[14:46] continue to pray for his salvation as
[14:48] well as his healing. Brother Chris has
[14:52] uh requested prayer that the Lord would
[14:54] open the eyes of four people. Paul,
[14:56] Jerry, Sundance, and Star.
[14:59] Brother Mark Lowry is requesting prayer
[15:03] uh for Sister Deborah who's at home
[15:05] suffering from some sort of a skin
[15:06] allergy. It's very miserable for her and
[15:09] we just are believing for complete
[15:12] healing. I'd like you to remember in
[15:14] prayer a lady that I work with, name is
[15:16] Moren Chant, was in the hospital, had a
[15:18] real serious operation. Uh want to pray
[15:21] that God would just have his hand upon
[15:23] her. Uh, Sister Sandy Clemens is uh
[15:27] requesting prayer. Uh, her mom Filina
[15:30] Dross is very sick and wants us to
[15:32] remember her in prayer. And also Dave is
[15:35] requesting prayer for Bonnie. Amen. How
[15:39] many have a need this morning? They want
[15:40] to remember. Amen. And uh those who are
[15:44] listening in on the internet or on the
[15:46] phone, if you've got a need, you just
[15:47] lift it before the Lord as we go to
[15:49] prayer. Amen.
[15:52] Let's bow our hearts and our heads.
[15:56] Put a prayer together bearing these
[15:58] needs up before our Lord. Heavenly
[16:01] Father, we come Lord this morning
[16:04] unworthy in ourselves, Father, to stand
[16:06] in this August presence that we feel
[16:09] this morning. But Father, it's not by
[16:11] our own works. It's not by our own
[16:13] desires that we are here. But it is
[16:16] because you have called us, Father.
[16:18] Before the foundation of the world, you
[16:20] looked down through the eons of time and
[16:22] you said, "I will choose a little bride.
[16:25] I will call her out unto myself." And we
[16:27] stand here this morning, Lord, the
[16:29] redeemed of the lamb, the bloodbought
[16:32] this morning. Father, we give you
[16:35] praise, Lord Jesus. We give you all the
[16:38] honor. We give you the glory this
[16:39] morning. Lord, we see the troubles in
[16:42] the world, but Father, we know that
[16:44] these things must come to pass as well.
[16:47] But we know this morning, Lord, that you
[16:49] are going to come this morning and speak
[16:51] through our pastor. Lord, as your
[16:53] presence is already here, anointing the
[16:55] people to receive your word into a
[16:58] prepared ground, Father, prepare our
[17:01] pastor, Lord,
[17:02] &gt;&gt; give him the words to speak, Lord. And
[17:04] as he would stand behind this sacred
[17:06] desk, Father, would you take over, Lord
[17:08] Jesus, and would you give utterance,
[17:10] Lord? Lord, not to just tickle our minds
[17:14] or to give us a sensation in our flesh,
[17:17] Lord, but to transform us, oh God. Lord,
[17:20] to turn our
[17:22] mortal bodies into immortality, Father.
[17:25] Lord, we desire to reach out and touch
[17:27] you this morning, Lord. on behalf of
[17:29] these requests that have been pinned
[17:31] down before us. Lord, I lay my hands
[17:33] upon them, Father. Thinking of Brother
[17:35] Rod's request, think of Brother Mark
[17:37] Lowry's request. Sister Debbie, Lord,
[17:39] laying at home this morning. Father, we
[17:42] are more than overcomers in Christ
[17:44] Jesus. Lord, anything that we would ask,
[17:47] believing, Father, you said that it
[17:48] would be granted unto us. This morning
[17:51] we stand together as more than two or
[17:53] three people believing in the name of
[17:55] our Lord Jesus Christ that you would
[17:56] come on the scene on behalf of these
[17:59] requests that we have before us. Lord
[18:01] behind every uplifted hand that was
[18:03] raised in faith Lord. Lord in a simple
[18:06] faith where you said if we would have
[18:07] the faith the grain of a mustard seed.
[18:10] Lord a very small minute faith Lord that
[18:12] we could say to a tree be plucked up and
[18:15] planted into the ocean. Lord, a tree
[18:18] planted in the ocean we know in our
[18:19] carnal mind cannot bear fruit and live,
[18:22] but you said that that's what it would
[18:23] do. So, Father, if we could reach out in
[18:26] faith this morning, Father, believing
[18:28] that you would come on the scene once
[18:29] again. We know that you will do it.
[18:32] Father, have thine own way this morning,
[18:35] Lord. Lord, may you have control from
[18:37] the beginning to the end of this
[18:39] service, Lord. We don't know who is here
[18:40] in this congregation that has need of
[18:43] you, Lord. We don't know what needs lie
[18:45] behind the heart of your people. But
[18:47] Lord, each person that walked into this
[18:49] building had a particular desire. Lord,
[18:52] they didn't just come to see a man. They
[18:54] didn't just come to hear words spoken.
[18:56] But Lord, they've come with a desire to
[18:58] hear from you. I pray that in the
[19:01] simplicity of this meeting, in the
[19:03] foolishness of preaching, that lives
[19:04] would be saved. Lord, that bodies would
[19:07] be healed, the redeemed would be found.
[19:10] Lord, we bless your name.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Be with you. musicians, the song leader,
[19:14] Lord, each and every vessel that has
[19:17] come in, may we empty out ourselves,
[19:19] Lord. May we just lay ourselves at your
[19:21] feet this morning, that we might learn
[19:23] of thee. We commit this day in its
[19:26] entirety into your perfect and divine
[19:29] care. In the name of our Lord Jesus
[19:31] Christ, we ask.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; And you may be seated.
[19:50] We want to welcome everyone that's here
[19:52] this morning, those who are visiting us.
[19:54] We're really happy to have you here with
[19:55] us and trust that you're going to hear
[19:59] something from God this morning. That's
[20:00] the reason I'm here this morning. Amen.
[20:04] Trust you're here for the same reason.
[20:07] And uh we've got a couple of
[20:09] announcements and then our sister
[20:11] Elizabeth Neighbor is going to come
[20:12] bless us with a song. Um
[20:16] brother David and Sister Janna Waldner
[20:18] are happy to announce the birth of their
[20:20] son. Levi Timothy Waldner. He was born
[20:25] weddednesday the 12th of October.
[20:27] Weighed in at 8 lb 3 o.
[20:32] And uh mother and baby are doing fine.
[20:35] doesn't say anything about dad, but I'm
[20:36] sure he's doing okay, too. So, we're
[20:38] happy for brother David and Sister Jana.
[20:40] Amen.
[20:45] There is going to be a young people's
[20:46] meeting this Friday night, uh, October
[20:50] the 21st, 7:30 p.m. in the fellowship
[20:53] hall. And I know that the young people
[20:55] have been really enjoying it. So, um,
[20:59] we'll be praying God would continue to
[21:01] have his way in those meetings. Now,
[21:03] Sister Elizabeth has asked that you not
[21:06] clap after the song. And sometimes it's
[21:08] appropriate not to clap, you know, with
[21:11] a slow song. And sometimes God is moving
[21:13] on the hearts of people. Uh, you know,
[21:15] it's uh just if you're going to say
[21:17] something, say, "Praise the Lord." Amen.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; Sister Elizabeth,
[21:21] &gt;&gt; the Lord gave me this song the week
[21:23] after camp. The verses are a believer's
[21:26] desperate cry to God for a loved one who
[21:28] needs deliverance. The chorus is the
[21:31] believer's confession of faith to the
[21:34] person that they prayed for after prayer
[21:36] when the Lord has given them renewed
[21:38] vision. As I sing it out of my own
[21:41] burden, I trust it will encourage you.
[21:46] [Music]
[22:04] Lord, hear my cry.
[22:10] In my
[22:12] great need
[22:14] [Music]
[22:15] for my loved ones,
[22:20] I
[22:22] now plead
[22:24] [Music]
[22:26] arrest their soul.
[22:31] Halt this downward slide.
[22:36] Break down barriers.
[22:39] Strip away objects of pride
[22:45] if they are thine.
[22:49] Give me vision beyond wine
[22:54] to rise in faithful love and boldly say
[23:01] to them.
[23:03] [Music]
[23:05] Even as you walk away,
[23:10] I see you restored.
[23:16] Though your first love has died,
[23:20] I see it a lie.
[23:25] As you build a wall of lies,
[23:30] truth will prevail.
[23:34] I see you fully satisfied
[23:42] behind
[23:44] the veil.
[23:46] The tokens applied.
[23:51] There's blood on the door.
[23:56] That door is now closing.
[24:00] I'm still believing the Lord
[24:04] [Music]
[24:06] and eagle blind
[24:10] and wrapped in heavy chains
[24:15] stumbles down
[24:19] pleasures dark lane.
[24:24] Shake out the feathers
[24:28] replace with thorns.
[24:32] [Music]
[24:33] If through fiery pain a sinner's soul
[24:37] can be reborn.
[24:42] But even as you walk away,
[24:47] I see you restored.
[24:52] Though your first love has died,
[24:56] I see it alive.
[25:01] As you build a wall of lies,
[25:05] truth will prevail.
[25:10] I see you fully satisfied
[25:15] [Music]
[25:17] behind the wheel.
[25:23] You can know the wonder
[25:27] again.
[25:32] Perfect.
[25:34] Release
[25:36] in him.
[25:41] yield
[25:43] as he speaks
[25:45] today.
[25:50] Time
[25:52] is slipping
[25:55] away.
[26:06] [Music]
[26:31] [Applause]
[26:35] as you Walk away.
[26:39] I see you restored.
[26:44] Though your first love has died,
[26:49] I see it alive.
[26:53] As you build a wall of lies,
[26:58] truth will prevail.
[27:02] I see you fully satisfied.
[27:11] Fully satisfied.
[27:14] I see you there
[27:18] behind the veil
[27:22] and I'm belieing here
[27:28] behind
[27:30] the veil
[27:38] behind the
[27:41] veil.
[27:49] Amen. Thanks, Sister Elizabeth.
[27:54] Steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[27:57] His mercies never come to an end. They
[27:59] are new every morning. Great is thy
[28:02] faithfulness, O Lord. Let's sing it
[28:03] together.
[28:08] The steadfast
[28:10] love of the Lord never ceases.
[28:15] His mercies
[28:18] never
[28:19] come to end. They are new every morning.

[28:43] steadfast love of the Lord ever
[28:52] come to an end. They are new every
[28:57] morning.

[29:16] of the kids are coming in from Sunday
[29:17] school. Let's uh sing together. Oh, come
[29:21] let us adore him. Do you love him this
[29:24] morning, saints? with all your heart.

[29:28] brother Bisco is going to be coming at

[32:37] this service to be in his presence.
[32:40] This evening, we're going to have
[32:41] brother Ron Borthwick from Scotland. He
[32:44] and his wife have been visiting and
[32:47] they'll soon be returning home. So,
[32:50] tonight you want to come early and have
[32:52] a good seat. Our brother Ron Borthwick,
[32:54] I I know you're going to enjoy him very
[32:57] much.
[33:00] Did they pray for brother Timothy? M.
[33:04] We're going to pray as we get ready for
[33:06] the word for brother Timothy Moz. Well,
[33:08] brother Timothy's having a a a nose
[33:11] operation. It's not a serious operation,
[33:13] but it's going to kind of hinder him a
[33:17] wee bit for a little while. And uh so we
[33:21] want to pray for brother brother Timothy
[33:24] and like you to keep remembering of
[33:26] brother John Stall as well if you would
[33:29] that God will give him back his vision
[33:32] in his eye. Amen.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; And uh he's just waiting now for them to
[33:37] be able to do something a little bit
[33:38] further.
[33:40] Uh I'm going to ask the Lord just to
[33:42] bless us in the word this morning. I
[33:44] know you've already prayed, but I want
[33:46] to pray with you and then we'll be
[33:48] turning directly to the scripture.
[33:51] Heavenly Father,
[33:53] we are approaching now
[33:57] before your throne,
[33:59] making our requests and our petitions
[34:02] known
[34:03] as our brother Derek already prayed
[34:07] and requests of the people were made. We
[34:10] know that you heard every word. And now,
[34:13] Father, we come as your prophet said to
[34:15] this most important part, your word. We
[34:18] don't want anything to stand in the way.
[34:21] We just pray Lord that every human
[34:25] spirit will come in subjection to the
[34:27] Holy Spirit. And I pray, oh God, that
[34:30] you will take and demonstrate your word
[34:32] in power. And Father, may the Holy
[34:36] Spirit have absolute liberty here this
[34:39] morning in every vessel. Lord, I pray
[34:42] that I also will have the liberty of the
[34:45] Holy Spirit to minister those things
[34:48] that you would have spoken to speak
[34:51] where you would speak and be silent
[34:53] where you would be silent. And may you
[34:56] be glorified, Lord. There are shall no
[34:58] flesh glorif be glorified in your
[35:01] presence. And I pray oh God you'll give
[35:03] clarity of thought now and clarity of
[35:06] word and especially clarity of mind that
[35:10] the people may not be distracted but
[35:12] receive oh God what you have intended
[35:15] for this service. Bless all who are not
[35:17] in the visible audience wherever they
[35:20] may be streaming at this time or
[35:22] wherever oh God these words may go. I
[35:26] pray that you'll make it a blessing in
[35:27] the name of Jesus Christ for an eternal
[35:30] purpose and we will give you all the
[35:33] praise and glory in Jesus Christ's name.
[35:37] Amen.
[35:39] Amen. I'll have you take your Bibles and
[35:42] turn to John's Gospel if you would, the
[35:44] 14th chapter,
[35:49] and we'll read beginning at the 8th
[35:52] verse.
[36:08] Philip saith unto him,
[36:11] Lord, show us the Father, and it
[36:14] sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him,
[36:17] "Have I been so long time with you? And
[36:21] yet hast thou not known me, Philillip?
[36:24] He that hath seen me hath seen the
[36:26] Father? And how sayest thou then, show
[36:29] us the Father? Believest thou not that I
[36:33] am in the Father, and the Father in me?
[36:37] The words that I speak unto you, I speak
[36:40] not of myself, but the Father that
[36:43] dwelleth in me." He doeth the works.
[36:47] Believe me that I am in the Father and
[36:50] the Father in me. Or else believe me for
[36:53] the very works sake. Verily, verily, I
[36:56] say unto you, he that believeth on me,
[36:59] the works that I do shall he do also,
[37:02] and greater works than these shall he
[37:05] do, because I go to my father.
[37:09] And whatsoever you shall ask in my name,
[37:12] that will I do, that the Father may be
[37:14] glorified in the Son.
[37:17] If you ask anything in my name, I will
[37:20] do it. If you love me, keep my
[37:23] commandments. And I will pray the
[37:25] Father, and he shall give you another
[37:27] comforter, that he may abide with you
[37:30] forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom
[37:32] the world cannot receive, because it
[37:36] seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but
[37:39] ye know him, for he dwelleth with you,
[37:42] and shall be in you. I will not leave
[37:45] you comfortless.
[37:46] I will come to you yet a little while
[37:49] and the world seeth me no more but you
[37:52] shall see me because I live you shall
[37:55] live also at that day you shall know
[37:58] that I am in the my father and ye in me
[38:02] and I in you. He that hath my
[38:06] commandments and keepeth them. He it is
[38:08] that loveth me and he that loveth me
[38:10] shall be loved of my father and I will
[38:13] love him and will manifest myself to
[38:16] him. Amen. God bless you. You may have
[38:18] your seats.
[38:22] Sometimes when we are
[38:26] ministering
[38:28] there are not just thoughts of a sermon
[38:31] but there are things that perhaps we've
[38:34] pondered as I've said here recently in
[38:36] recent weeks and the last few months
[38:39] there are things which we've pondered
[38:40] perhaps for
[38:42] months or years and then you approach
[38:46] the subject but uh you you don't declare
[38:50] clare it. You're not able to declare it
[38:52] or perhaps you just uh feel restrained a
[38:55] wee bit for one reason or another. Quite
[38:57] often the restrained is because you want
[38:59] to feel that the people are at a place
[39:02] where they can uh uh get a hold of your
[39:06] thought and uh also that it will not be
[39:10] misunderstood. That's very very
[39:12] important that you your thought will not
[39:14] be misunderstood.
[39:16] uh I want to speak uh continuing on with
[39:19] the subject last from last Sunday. This
[39:21] will be part two the separated life but
[39:24] it will come from a very very different
[39:26] direction.
[39:27] Uh the the subject here as we have Jesus
[39:32] said at that day you shall know that I
[39:36] am in the father. You shall know that I
[39:39] am in my father
[39:42] and you in me and I in you.
[39:47] There is this dual
[39:49] uh relationship this dwelling.
[39:53] I am in my father
[39:56] and you are in me
[39:59] and I am in you.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Now I tell you that is right immediately
[40:04] as a great separation line. That's a
[40:07] huge line of demarcation because there
[40:10] just a
[40:12] largest portion of the population cannot
[40:15] really make that declaration
[40:17] &gt;&gt; that Christ is in me and I am in him
[40:21] &gt;&gt; and I that will be largely where I'm
[40:23] going to be dwelling. The word in is
[40:26] very very small word but it's a very
[40:29] very powerful word and I I will be
[40:33] wanting you to not just think about that
[40:36] but how how is that how is it that I am
[40:40] in Christ and Christ is in me? Is it
[40:43] because I sit in church? Is it because
[40:44] I've listen to a certain message? Is it
[40:47] how is it that I'm in Christ? Is it
[40:49] because I decided I would be in him? Uh
[40:52] how is it that he's in me? Where does
[40:54] that happen? How does it happen? Uh h
[40:57] how does this function? You know, uh
[41:00] what proves that he's in me and I'm in
[41:02] him? And there there certainly is some,
[41:05] you know, I'm asking a lot of questions
[41:06] because those questions are are
[41:09] naturally arise as we go through the
[41:11] through the service this morning.
[41:15] What Jesus said, "And at that day," and
[41:19] brother Brandham stops and he says, "And
[41:20] that is this day." Amen.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a reason for him to say
[41:24] that because Jesus said, "At that day,
[41:27] you shall know that I am in the father."
[41:30] Now, Jesus didn't begin being in the
[41:34] father in this day.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "You will just know that I'm
[41:38] that." In other words, there will there
[41:41] will come a time that there will be an
[41:43] understanding of how Christ is in God
[41:47] that they didn't have in previous
[41:49] generations. There will come a time when
[41:52] I'm going to reveal that the oneness of
[41:55] Christ in God. In other words, the
[41:58] Godhead will come into an understanding
[42:01] that they haven't had
[42:03] &gt;&gt; over all of these centuries. There will
[42:06] come a time. It isn't that Christ will
[42:09] commence dwelling in the father at that
[42:11] time that there'll be some uh new thing
[42:13] happen. It is that your knowing of that
[42:17] will change. There will be a time and he
[42:21] said very clearly at that day there will
[42:24] be a day when the people will begin to
[42:27] know something and the knowledge Jesus
[42:30] was specific about it. You will know
[42:32] that I'm in the father. There will be a
[42:34] day when this will be revealed at a
[42:36] level that it has not been revealed
[42:39] before. Not only that Christ is in the
[42:42] father but then that I that you are in
[42:45] me. There will be a a a a day when that
[42:49] will come to such a level because you
[42:52] can you can read all the books you wish
[42:54] to read, hear all the messages you wish
[42:56] to hear. But there's something that
[42:58] really sets this message apart and that
[43:01] is this is a bride bridegroom message
[43:05] distinctly a bride bridegroom message.
[43:07] You never hear any other ministers. You
[43:09] never hear any other sermons about uh
[43:12] out of the scriptures that so speak of
[43:14] the bride and the bridegroom because
[43:17] that kind of relationship, a bride
[43:20] bridegroom relationship, a husband wife
[43:23] relationship, they know something about
[43:25] being one. And that is what this day is.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; This is the day to know something of
[43:31] this oneness. And so that is what Jesus
[43:34] is speaking about. He's saying because
[43:36] the revelation of the oneness of the
[43:39] Godhead would be made known and Jesus
[43:42] Christ would call his bride to himself
[43:45] into a marriage. That's why Jesus is
[43:48] saying at at that day and the prophet
[43:50] says and that's this day because he knew
[43:53] that that was clearly his ministry and
[43:56] he could say authoritatively that is
[43:59] this day.
[44:02] I'm going to get some liberty.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; I'll be needing it here before long.
[44:14] Now, I'm just going to take my time.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; So,
[44:17] &gt;&gt; now in the message Christ is the mystery
[44:19] of God revealed,
[44:22] the prophet says, "Now notice
[44:24] God making himself known." See Jesus
[44:28] said at that day you will know and now
[44:32] he prophets addressing this he said and
[44:35] God making himself known he just stops
[44:38] we're not supposed to make converts to
[44:40] Christianity by a government it's not
[44:44] the system it's not the church
[44:46] organization it's not a denomination any
[44:50] kind of a system there's no system that
[44:52] can make converts to real true
[44:54] Christianity
[44:56] &gt;&gt; but by the revelation of Christ in you
[45:03] &gt;&gt; as God was in Christ.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; That's how you truly have a convert to
[45:09] Christianity is when a person realizes
[45:13] that Christ is in them
[45:16] &gt;&gt; and that they are in Christ. This is the
[45:19] revelation by the revelation that Christ
[45:22] is in you
[45:25] &gt;&gt; as God was in Christ. Not just that
[45:28] Christ was in you, but that Christ is in
[45:30] you as God was in Christ. And so when a
[45:34] person comes to and has a revelation God
[45:37] is in me as God was in Christ, I'll tell
[45:40] you what, you're not going to re you're
[45:42] separated.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; You're separated from all kind of other
[45:46] uh thought and belief.
[45:48] And so he said, "And as God was in
[45:51] Christ, Christ is in you. What God did
[45:54] in Christ, Christ does in you. What
[45:57] signs did God in Christ, Christ does in
[46:01] you." And he said, "Isn't that
[46:04] beautiful?"
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "At that day." And he said,
[46:10] "That's this day."
[46:12] &gt;&gt; At that day, that's this day. At that
[46:16] day, what day? When the revelation is
[46:19] made known, you will know that I'm in my
[46:22] father and the father in me, I in you,
[46:27] and you in me. When the revelations made
[46:30] not only known, manifest.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; It actually begins to show itself. It
[46:36] begins to appear on the scene. Something
[46:39] literally happens. a people arise that
[46:43] have something distinct and unique about
[46:45] them in that Christ is in them. Not just
[46:49] in theory, not just in a profession but
[46:53] in an actual possession, Christ is in
[46:56] them. And when that becomes not only
[46:59] known but also manifest, see at that day
[47:03] you shall know that I and the father are
[47:07] one. I'm in the father and the father's
[47:11] in me. Then when the revelation come
[47:14] forth then it's I in you and you in me.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Good.
[47:21] Now the very life of Jesus Christ was a
[47:25] very unique and different life. We're
[47:27] talking about the life of Christ in an
[47:29] individual. the very life of Jesus
[47:31] Christ would be now in bride bridegroom
[47:36] and as as uh Mary a virgin Mary pregnant
[47:43] and not knowing any man but she was
[47:45] pregnantated by a spoken word of God and
[47:48] thus it shall be according to your word.
[47:51] Now the scripture says also which we
[47:53] read last week
[47:56] for such an high priest became us who is
[48:00] holy, harmless, undefiled,
[48:04] separate from sinners and made higher
[48:07] than the heavens. His life was indeed
[48:11] separate from sinners, separate from
[48:12] unbelief. He didn't sin. Sin is
[48:15] unbelief. There's no word that Jesus
[48:17] doubted.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; No doubt. There was it wasn't it was not
[48:21] possible for him to doubt for he was the
[48:24] word and he was separate from sinners.
[48:27] Now if that life if that Christ is in us
[48:33] how are we going to doubt the word
[48:37] &gt;&gt; his life was separate from sinners yet
[48:40] he was as we said the sinner's friend
[48:42] &gt;&gt; right
[48:44] &gt;&gt; and a man running from the presence of
[48:46] the Lord nothing ever compared
[48:50] with him he lived in a world now we're
[48:53] talking about I and you
[48:55] &gt;&gt; right
[48:56] &gt;&gt; that's we're talking about
[48:58] &gt;&gt; him in you.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; And now the prophet is describing his
[49:01] life. Nothing ever compared with him.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Let me just stop there. The life which
[49:08] you have received by virtue of not some
[49:12] doctrine, not by virtue of this church,
[49:15] not by virtue of anything that you have
[49:17] done, but by virtue of God's forordained
[49:21] knowledge himself by his own grace and
[49:24] mercy. The life which you have received
[49:26] in you regardless of your failures or
[49:30] your weaknesses. I can say this on the
[49:32] authority of God's word. There's no life
[49:35] that ever compared with it.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; There's no life that has ever compared
[49:39] with what you have received.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; It's not a church. It's not a doctrine,
[49:44] friends. It's so far beyond that. You
[49:47] might not even realize what it is that
[49:49] you have received. It could be like a
[49:51] child not knowing what kind of an
[49:53] inheritance awaits them. They have no
[49:55] way of evaluating it. They have no way
[49:58] of appreciating it. We sit there and you
[50:00] know uh kind of glibly. Yeah. Well, it's
[50:02] it's all all wonderful. But your
[50:05] father's trying to tell you that what
[50:07] you have received there is no life that
[50:09] compares with it.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; He lived in a world to himself.
[50:17] There are some things which we
[50:19] experience in God you can scarcely share
[50:22] with anyone
[50:24] &gt;&gt; because it is too precious
[50:26] &gt;&gt; on one hand.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; It is it's just too unique. It's too
[50:30] wonderful and you can't just throw it
[50:32] out for all to see.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; No man ever spoke like him. You can't
[50:40] expect that your language is going to be
[50:42] the accepted kind of language. It's not
[50:45] the jargon of the day. You say things
[50:47] that sound even though you may speak in
[50:49] the language of of of the of the uh
[50:53] country, but you speak almost in unknown
[50:56] tongues because they don't understand
[50:58] what it is that you're saying. It is a
[51:00] it's a divine utterance.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke in the language of his
[51:07] people, but they didn't. He spoke
[51:09] simply. He spoke so simply, but they
[51:12] didn't understand him. It's because he
[51:14] was coming from a a perspective of
[51:17] eternal things. He saw from a different
[51:19] from a different p perspective
[51:21] completely. And he said when he just
[51:25] opened his mouth, there was something
[51:27] about it. Something was different from
[51:29] anybody else. Somebody said he was just
[51:31] an ordinary man. But he said, "I defy
[51:34] that he was God. That's what he was. For
[51:37] no man ever spoke like him. No man could
[51:41] speak like him because he was the living
[51:43] word itself made flesh, the
[51:46] manifestation of the fullness of God.
[51:49] And now we are I have a multitude of
[51:52] scriptures everywhere and you know it
[51:54] well. But this life
[51:57] I'm simply describing as the prophet
[51:59] described it. But this life he said, I
[52:03] am in you.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:07] &gt;&gt; I am in you. This is the life that's in
[52:09] you. And I think it'd be good for us to
[52:11] have a look and to describe that life.
[52:14] This is the life that's in you.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Or you might say, "Oh,
[52:18] did I have so I have so many problems
[52:20] and this and that and things of life."
[52:23] Well, we'll get to that after a while.
[52:25] But the life that's in you is greater
[52:27] than your weakness.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; The life that's in you is greater than
[52:31] your failure this last week. The life
[52:34] that's in you is greater than those
[52:36] thoughts you had which you dislike. The
[52:39] life that's in you because what's in
[52:41] this body, this body is in this body has
[52:44] been by a natural birth, by a natural
[52:47] sexual birth has come into a life that
[52:49] is dying.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; This life is dying.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; But the life that's in you by virtue of
[52:56] this word is not dying. And the w life
[53:00] that came in you by virtue of this word
[53:03] has overcome the other life.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; By this you were born by the seed of
[53:09] your father when it came to the bedding
[53:11] ground of the womb of your mother and by
[53:13] the birth of the of the mother and the
[53:15] birth of the woman. You came into earth
[53:17] to die. But by virtue of the life of
[53:21] eternal life that came by the man Jesus
[53:24] Christ is stronger than that life. The
[53:27] life that came by the human seed is
[53:29] unrighteous. But the life that came by
[53:31] this seed here is righteous and can
[53:34] never be anything else.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; And it is stronger, more powerful than
[53:39] any other life. The life that's in you.
[53:43] And if Satan can get you to look at the
[53:46] manifestation
[53:48] of the life that you have by virtue of
[53:51] your natural birth and and get your mind
[53:54] consumed with the fact that uh that that
[53:57] this is the life that's dictating to
[53:59] you, this is the only thing that you
[54:00] know, you're not going to rise any
[54:02] higher than the life that you had by
[54:04] your natural birth, then you'll live a
[54:06] life of defeat. But when you continue to
[54:09] confess, I am in you and you are in me.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Now, either Jesus was lying or he was
[54:17] telling the truth. And I say he was he
[54:20] could only tell the truth.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am in you
[54:24] &gt;&gt; and you're in me."
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Not that this is going to be at some
[54:29] time in eternity. It's now.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; I'm in you. And a prophet comes in this
[54:34] day and says that's this day.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; That is this day.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't entered into it yet,
[54:41] I'm saying I'm repeating his words. That
[54:43] is this day.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; If you have any hesitation, I don't care
[54:47] what kind of a uh what kind of a
[54:49] background you have. I don't care what
[54:51] kind of a nature you were born with. I
[54:53] don't care if God has spoken to you and
[54:55] called you. I can say to you if you are
[54:58] if you've been called by elective love
[55:01] that's this day and God wants you to
[55:04] know that by revelation
[55:06] [Music]
[55:07] &gt;&gt; God wants you to understand it.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; And he said I will admit them prophets
[55:15] had their message.
[55:17] They had them that they had them then.
[55:21] They have them now. But there was a
[55:23] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[55:25] manifested there. Speaking of Christ, he
[55:28] was the unique one.
[55:30] The life that's in you is a unique one.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Right?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; There isn't, you know, there isn't
[55:37] dozens of them. There's only one life.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; It's a unique one.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Said, "I am in you and you are in me."
[55:45] And he was the one
[55:48] that had to face the issue with all his
[55:50] great powers that he had. He could have
[55:52] absolutely been king of the world and he
[55:55] will be to his saints. He said he is
[55:58] now. He's king of my life.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; King of our life. I crown thee now.
[56:03] Amen.
[56:05] Says for no man ever spoke like him. No
[56:08] man could speak like him. I want you to
[56:11] think about I am in you.
[56:15] There are some things
[56:18] that you will say. You may say a whole
[56:20] lot of things. You may say, "Well, it's
[56:22] warm in here. It's cold in here." You
[56:23] may say, "Well, uh, you know, I I like
[56:26] this color. I don't like this color. I
[56:27] like that, you know, garment. I don't
[56:29] like that garment." A whole lot of
[56:30] things that isn't unique. But then there
[56:32] are things which God
[56:35] has transmitted to you that you speak.
[56:39] It's not only unique, but not everybody
[56:42] can say that,
[56:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:45] &gt;&gt; A whole lot of people can't say that.
[56:47] And that's where the separation line
[56:49] comes.
[56:52] for a person by revelation to be able to
[56:54] stand up and say
[56:57] God dwells in me.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Because he said so
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ and the very life that he
[57:05] lived lives in me.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; How do you know? I have something a
[57:11] light went on inside and I may not be
[57:14] able to give you all the proof of it but
[57:17] I will make the declaration of it
[57:19] because he declared it. I will declare
[57:21] it.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; What about the victory over the natural
[57:28] life? That's not our business. If you
[57:30] surrender to the word, if you just
[57:33] surrender to his promise, if you
[57:34] surrender to the Holy Spirit that comes
[57:36] and dwells in you, you will live the
[57:38] life is pleasing in his sight.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[57:46] God in his creation,
[57:49] brother Bram says, God was in his
[57:51] creation.
[57:53] God is in his creation. God is in his
[57:55] word. God is in his son. God is in his
[57:57] people. Everything that God was was put
[58:01] into Jesus Christ. He was co-equal with
[58:04] the father. He said, "Think it not
[58:06] robbery." But he was he was equal with
[58:09] the father. Now, so God was in his
[58:13] creation. God was in his word. God was
[58:16] in his son. God was in his people. I
[58:18] want to just move through those a little
[58:19] bit. God was in his creation. How did
[58:22] God come into his creation? I mean in
[58:24] his creation. Well, he said, "Let there
[58:27] be." Yes.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; And there was.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; And then God was in his creation.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Let there be." And let
[58:34] there be. And there was. And there was.
[58:36] Let there be light. And there was light.
[58:38] Let the earth bring forth. And it did.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; You weren't there to stew about it and
[58:44] sweat over it.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't have to worry about it.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; He wasn't even on the scene.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; And all all happened. And then God was
[58:56] in his creation by virtue of his word.
[58:59] He spoke it
[59:00] &gt;&gt; and it happened and then God was there.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Just that simple.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Are we getting somewhere?
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Move on quickly. God was in his people.
[59:14] Now, here
[59:16] you're going to have to just think a
[59:18] little bit.
[59:19] God spoke to the children of Israel
[59:22] through the mouth of his prophet Moses.
[59:26] Thus, God was in his people.
[59:30] Didn't say that the people all had a
[59:32] marvelous experience.
[59:34] How was God in his people
[59:37] back at that time? God was in his
[59:40] prophet and his prophet was amongst them
[59:44] and God was in his people.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Good. They all didn't have what Moses
[59:49] had.
[59:51] But if they believed Moses, they fell
[59:53] under the benefits of the word that was
[59:55] coming out of his mouth.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; God was in his people.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; God was there.
[1:00:03] There wasn't Kora, Aubriam, all these
[1:00:07] others. They couldn't rise up and say,
[1:00:08] "God's behind my skin."
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; But Moses could say that.
[1:00:15] Moses could say he was veiling God.
[1:00:19] And the scripture said,
[1:00:22] God speaking to Moses, "Now go now
[1:00:24] therefore go and I will be with thy
[1:00:27] mouth and teach thee what thou shalt
[1:00:30] say. I will be with your mouth and I
[1:00:32] will teach you what you shall say and
[1:00:34] thou shalt speak."
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; God didn't say to Moses, "Now, can you
[1:00:40] will you speak?"
[1:00:42] No. God's telling him. And you will
[1:00:45] speak
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; and you will say these things and
[1:00:49] they'll be unique because it'll be God
[1:00:52] in you that'll be saying it.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; It's not you anymore. It's going to be
[1:00:56] God in you.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; God's not asking him for his consent.
[1:01:00] God just says you're going to say it.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; That's all. You're going to say it.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Moses had all kinds of excuses. He says,
[1:01:10] "And thou shalt speak unto him and put
[1:01:13] words in his mouth." You're going to say
[1:01:14] it. You're going to put words in Aaron's
[1:01:16] mouth, and I will be with his mouth.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God was in Moses' mouth.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; And the words were not Moses' words.
[1:01:25] They were God's words. And I'm going to
[1:01:27] transfer them because he says, "I can't
[1:01:28] speak. I'll give you a vessel that can
[1:01:30] speak, but I'm going to be with your
[1:01:32] mouth. And you're going to say the
[1:01:34] words, and he's going to hear them, and
[1:01:36] then I'll be with his mouth."
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:39] and with his mouth and shall teach you
[1:01:41] what you shall do.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; God was in his people.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that everybody had an
[1:01:49] experience,
[1:01:50] had some emotional thing or any other
[1:01:53] kind. It isn't even that they had a
[1:01:54] revelation. They just had to agree and
[1:01:57] believe
[1:01:59] the God of Israel, the God of Abraham,
[1:02:02] the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob is
[1:02:04] amongst us.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; It's not a the Gegosites can't say this.
[1:02:08] The Jebusites can't say this. The
[1:02:10] Canaanites can't say this. The Hittites
[1:02:12] can't say this. The Amorites can't say
[1:02:14] this. The Amalachites can't say this.
[1:02:17] But we can say this. God's in his
[1:02:19] people. Why? We have a prophet,
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; a vindicated prophet. And God blessed
[1:02:26] the people when they came to that
[1:02:27] realization. God's in us. And soon as
[1:02:30] the people rose up and says, I I don't,
[1:02:32] you know, I I don't think he's the only
[1:02:33] one that God's called. I don't think
[1:02:35] he's so, you know, I think God's God's
[1:02:37] upon all of us. Soon as they came into
[1:02:40] that, they came into God's disfavor and
[1:02:42] God swallowed them up and they died and
[1:02:43] withered and went away. We've seen the
[1:02:45] same thing in these days.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; God said further.
[1:02:52] Moses answered and said,
[1:02:56] "But behold, they will not believe me,
[1:02:58] nor hearken unto my voice, for they will
[1:03:01] say, The Lord hath not appeared unto
[1:03:03] thee." And it shall come to pass in the
[1:03:06] eth verse of Exodus 4, and it shall come
[1:03:09] to pass, if they will not believe thee,
[1:03:12] neither hearken to the voice of the
[1:03:14] first sign, they will believe the voice
[1:03:17] of the latter sign. God is dictating
[1:03:21] these things. You know, I I can tell you
[1:03:24] and you know it well even the things
[1:03:27] that are happening in these days and the
[1:03:29] things that took place in the prophet's
[1:03:30] ministry, it wasn't him that designed
[1:03:33] the meetings and and what was taking
[1:03:35] place and who was gathering on the
[1:03:38] prayer lines and who was to be it. It
[1:03:40] wasn't his design. It was God
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; allowing people to come and hearing
[1:03:45] certain things and having the secrets of
[1:03:47] their heart revealed. And he said he
[1:03:50] said to uh he said to Moses, "And it
[1:03:53] shall come to pass if they will not
[1:03:55] believe thee. And what did the angel of
[1:03:57] the Lord even say to brother Brandham?"
[1:03:59] said exactly the same words. I'll give
[1:04:01] you two signs. And if the people won't
[1:04:03] believe the first one, they will believe
[1:04:06] the second one. For I'll make you to
[1:04:08] know the very secrets of their hearts.
[1:04:10] How can a person deny it's God when
[1:04:11] they're standing right there? No, I've
[1:04:13] never seen this man in my life and he's
[1:04:15] telling me the deep secrets of my heart,
[1:04:17] telling me all concerning my what the
[1:04:20] doctor said or what my husband said or
[1:04:22] what the preacher said or whatever more.
[1:04:24] How can they deny that? They had to walk
[1:04:26] away and say, "God's in the midst.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; God is here.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; This man can't know that. God knows it.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; God was in his people.
[1:04:40] Hope I can get you to see this. So, what
[1:04:42] God intended for his people
[1:04:46] to be placed in the mouth of his
[1:04:48] prophet, what God intended for the
[1:04:50] people, God placed in the mouth of his
[1:04:54] prophet.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And in Deuteronomy, Moses spoke further.
[1:05:02] He said, "I will raise up a prophet from
[1:05:05] among their brethren like unto thee,"
[1:05:08] God speaking rather, "and will put my
[1:05:11] words in his mouth, and he shall speak
[1:05:14] unto them all that I shall command him."
[1:05:19] That is why, listen closely now. That is
[1:05:22] why the people when John the Baptist
[1:05:24] came on the scene asked him, "Art thou
[1:05:27] that prophet?"
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; This is the one they were looking for.
[1:05:31] and he said, "No, I'm not that prophet."
[1:05:34] "Are you Elijah?" "No, I'm not Elijah."
[1:05:37] And yet, if you go to the uh Baptist
[1:05:40] Jameson Faucet and Brown commentary and
[1:05:42] go to Malachi 45 and 6, the last verses
[1:05:45] of the Old Testament, they would refer
[1:05:48] back to that exact uh exact scripture
[1:05:51] and John's exact answer. No, I'm not
[1:05:54] that prophet. And they said that
[1:05:56] although John knew that he was Elijah
[1:06:00] because of the of the prophesi pro
[1:06:03] prophecy concerning him and the angel's
[1:06:06] words concerning him he knew but he also
[1:06:09] knew that he did not exhaustively
[1:06:12] fulfill the scripture and there was
[1:06:14] another coming of Elijah
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; there had to be before his first coming
[1:06:20] and before his second coming the same
[1:06:23] forerunner because he's a faithful
[1:06:25] forerunner,
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; a faithful messenger.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; And so he said he'll raise up and he
[1:06:31] said, "And it shall come to pass that
[1:06:33] whosoever shall not hearken unto my
[1:06:35] words, which he shall speak in my name,
[1:06:38] I will require it of him. A prophet
[1:06:42] shall the Lord your God raise up among
[1:06:44] their brethren like unto him." Now God
[1:06:48] was in his creation. God was in his
[1:06:50] people. I'll come back to that. But God
[1:06:53] was in his son
[1:06:56] and this life is in you.
[1:06:59] I have to say that.
[1:07:02] If you say, "Well, do you have evidence
[1:07:04] of that?" You're making a declaration.
[1:07:06] Do you have evidence of that? Well, I
[1:07:08] Yes, I feel I have evidence of that. I
[1:07:10] have evidence to satisfy myself. I see
[1:07:13] God amongst his people.
[1:07:15] I'll say to you this morning, I feel
[1:07:17] privileged to be amongst you
[1:07:20] called out of God under this message.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Uh we don't look at one another's flesh
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; to see just you know and and examine
[1:07:30] your flesh. If I stood and examined your
[1:07:33] flesh and your life that way or you
[1:07:35] examine mine, we would all be total
[1:07:37] failures. And anybody who doesn't think
[1:07:39] he's a failure is a liar.
[1:07:42] We are failures in this natural flesh.
[1:07:45] That is not the life that Jesus is
[1:07:47] talking about. He didn't say, "I'll be
[1:07:50] in you, but you'll have some weaknesses,
[1:07:51] etc." He said, "I will be in you,
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; and you will be in me, and I will be in
[1:07:56] the father, and that is oneness."
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; That is oneness. And that's what this
[1:08:02] word says. And I will call everything
[1:08:04] contrary to that as a lie. And this is
[1:08:07] the truth. This is God's word. Now a
[1:08:10] person can willfully walk away from the
[1:08:12] word and then all kinds of things will
[1:08:14] happen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Now God was in his son. I want to take
[1:08:21] the word in
[1:08:23] and I'm being a little bit slow and
[1:08:25] laborious just for this time because I
[1:08:28] want you to be thinking
[1:08:31] to be in
[1:08:33] it is denoting that the object
[1:08:37] is surrounded by
[1:08:39] or included in the object I will be in
[1:08:44] you.
[1:08:46] He is surrounded by and included in in
[1:08:51] you.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; He's surrounded by your life, your
[1:08:55] activity.
[1:08:56] And then further, it is that it is that
[1:09:00] to be in is to be enveloped
[1:09:03] or restrained by certain limits. I want
[1:09:06] you to hold that. That's why Jesus said
[1:09:09] he could only do what he saw the father
[1:09:12] do because the father was in him. And he
[1:09:16] was in the father and he was restrained.
[1:09:19] He was restrained by what he saw the
[1:09:21] father do. And the father was restrained
[1:09:24] because he did not exceed the limits of
[1:09:26] what Jesus did.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; You see, there were things which were
[1:09:37] written in the word which Jesus did not
[1:09:40] fulfill.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; You follow me? So even God who had
[1:09:46] spoken the word did not fulfill all of
[1:09:49] the word in the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:52] Although he was the fullness of the
[1:09:53] Godhead, God's word was not completely
[1:09:56] fulfilled in Christ because there were
[1:09:58] things that spoke of this time that this
[1:10:01] Christ would do in this day that he did
[1:10:04] not do in that day. He would do it in
[1:10:06] this day. And that is why I believe in
[1:10:09] the unveiling of God. The prophet goes
[1:10:12] back and he says
[1:10:14] he was the son of man on earth as a
[1:10:17] prophet through the dispensation of the
[1:10:19] church ages. He's the son of God because
[1:10:22] God is a spirit and he's a son of God.
[1:10:25] So he came back as the Holy Spirit. And
[1:10:28] in the millennium to the Jews, he will
[1:10:31] be the son of David, the king. He will
[1:10:34] sit on a throne. in the in the
[1:10:36] millennium he will be son of David. So
[1:10:38] he is the son of man. All the same one.
[1:10:41] He's the son of God. He is the son of
[1:10:43] David. But between the son of God and
[1:10:46] between the son of God throughout the
[1:10:48] church ages and in the between the son
[1:10:50] of God and the son of David, he said
[1:10:52] there's a there's a breach there.
[1:10:54] There's a space there where he returns
[1:10:56] again as son of man. He said to fulfill
[1:10:59] the rest of it
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; because there's portions in here that
[1:11:03] was not re fulfilled. One of them that
[1:11:05] wasn't fulfilled was and here he's on
[1:11:08] earth. But he says at that day
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; that's another day.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; You will know at that day when that
[1:11:15] comes
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; there's a day coming and now comes the
[1:11:19] revealing of the son of man with a
[1:11:21] vindicated prophet on earth standing
[1:11:23] here showing forth. It's the same life
[1:11:26] the same Christ dead raised the mimed
[1:11:29] healed all manner of things done. the
[1:11:31] secrets of the heart revealed in the
[1:11:33] same three pulls ministry and then he
[1:11:36] says and that's this day
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; this is a day when that knowing will
[1:11:40] take place it couldn't be known back
[1:11:43] there so Jesus did not fulfill that back
[1:11:45] there he fulfills it now
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; are you still with me
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; and so God himself was constrained God
[1:11:55] was in Christ but and Christ was
[1:11:59] complete manifestation of God. So
[1:12:02] whatever whatever to whatever extent
[1:12:05] that the Lord Jesus manifested the
[1:12:09] father that was the limit that the
[1:12:11] father was known.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; So God was in Christ but God himself was
[1:12:16] constrained because he himself was was
[1:12:20] uh uh enveloped I would say within the
[1:12:23] life of Jesus Christ. And Jesus was also
[1:12:26] constrained by the father. He was in the
[1:12:29] father. The father was in him. Jesus was
[1:12:31] constrained because he said the son can
[1:12:34] only do what he sees the father do.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; So he could only go so far.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; As you think more about that, you'll be
[1:12:47] blessed.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am in you."
[1:12:55] Jesus is not walking in a body down the
[1:12:57] street
[1:12:59] testifying of this message.
[1:13:02] He's constrained
[1:13:04] in you.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; To what degree you do it, to what degree
[1:13:09] the Holy Spirit moves you.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; That is the degree that he can do it.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't go beyond that. Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; And you can't do it unless he does it.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; So once again, this duality,
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; I am in you
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; and you are in me.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; He's surrounded.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; This is humbling. This is absolutely,
[1:13:38] you know, it just baffles my mind that
[1:13:40] the Lord Jesus Christ would come down
[1:13:42] and step into your life and say uh and
[1:13:45] so that you could say he Christ is the
[1:13:48] center of my activity.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; He is the influence in my life.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; And what he influences me to do I can do
[1:13:56] and I can't go beyond that.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; If I go beyond that, it's just human
[1:14:00] works, a human effort.
[1:14:03] And so
[1:14:04] it is to be restrained by certain
[1:14:08] limits.
[1:14:10] To be in also is denoting
[1:14:14] the sphere of activity.
[1:14:18] This is the sphere of our activity.
[1:14:23] Now you may be a farmer, you may be a
[1:14:25] carpenter, you may be a mechanic, you
[1:14:27] may be a businessman or whatever more.
[1:14:29] You may be a housewife. you you may have
[1:14:31] some other activity whatever more
[1:14:33] whatever you people do I'm a student I'm
[1:14:35] I'm gaining an education whatever more
[1:14:38] this Christ who is the word
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; must indeed be the center of the sphere
[1:14:45] of your activity whatever we do I do in
[1:14:49] the name of Jesus Christ I do it that he
[1:14:52] will be glorified I do it that he will
[1:14:54] be exalted if I if I'm blessed or I I I
[1:14:57] I gain some knowledge or I gain in a
[1:15:00] certain specific profession. I am going
[1:15:02] in this direction that he will be
[1:15:04] honored, that he will be glorified.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; To be in is to declare that you are
[1:15:14] within the influence or the scope of I
[1:15:18] am within the influence of that one that
[1:15:20] I am in.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And he is in me.
[1:15:28] Jesus said,
[1:15:30] "Believest thou not that I am in the
[1:15:32] Father,
[1:15:34] and the Father in me.
[1:15:37] The words that I speak unto you, I speak
[1:15:39] not of myself, but the Father that
[1:15:41] dwelleth in me, he doeth the work."
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was saying, "I'm not doing
[1:15:48] this.
[1:15:49] He's doing it."
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; How is he doing it? Because he's in me.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; How was God in Christ? Well,
[1:15:58] he was conceived. This very seed was
[1:16:01] conceived. It was a spoken word.
[1:16:05] Let me shock you. If you even plan to
[1:16:08] see the pearly gates,
[1:16:11] you won't even see the shadows of the
[1:16:13] pearly gates unless there's a life
[1:16:15] that's in you today that came by spoken
[1:16:18] word.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; And the very spoken word that brought
[1:16:22] forth Jesus Christ. You say, "Well, the
[1:16:24] prophets prophesied, a virgin shall
[1:16:26] conceive." I'll tell you something else.
[1:16:29] God sent a prophet right in this day to
[1:16:31] declare who you were
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; and to declare a word. And it's either
[1:16:36] believed or denied. It's either believed
[1:16:38] or disregarded. And that that in itself
[1:16:42] that that designates where that person
[1:16:45] is. That's right.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 14:11, "Believe me
[1:16:54] that I am in the Father and the Father
[1:16:56] in me, or else believe me for the very
[1:16:58] work's sake." So what he's saying, if
[1:17:02] you don't want to believe that the
[1:17:04] Father's in me and I'm in the Father, if
[1:17:06] that's too farfetched,
[1:17:09] if that's too deep for you,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; well, just look at the works.
[1:17:15] Where did they come from?
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; And even when they looked at the works,
[1:17:21] that didn't convince them.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; And neither will it today.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing. Say, "Oh, well, you
[1:17:27] know, you have long hair, you dress a
[1:17:29] certain way, you speak a certain way."
[1:17:30] Yeah, it's nice. I I really admire a lot
[1:17:33] of those things, but but you know, it's
[1:17:34] not for me. It's too strong for me. Are
[1:17:38] you one of those group? Are you a member
[1:17:40] of that group or whatever more? It's too
[1:17:42] strong for me. It it takes too literal
[1:17:45] position for me. Well, that's fine, but
[1:17:47] they but they see they see something
[1:17:49] there that's manifest. If you don't
[1:17:50] believe that God is in me, God is in
[1:17:52] you.
[1:17:55] If you don't believe that God's in the
[1:17:56] church, well, at least believe it for
[1:17:58] the work's sake because I declare if a
[1:18:01] person just looked honestly
[1:18:04] at the thing.
[1:18:07] You know, we were talking here the other
[1:18:08] day and there was a radio broadcast,
[1:18:12] a radio broadcast uh on a Vancouver
[1:18:15] station, one of the major stations,
[1:18:18] and they were having a huge discussion
[1:18:20] over the problem of marriage and
[1:18:23] divorces and the percentage of divorces
[1:18:25] and it was just it just uh skyrocketing
[1:18:29] and they had all you know not really
[1:18:32] looking for the answers but they were
[1:18:33] looking at the problem. such an enormous
[1:18:35] enormous problem. And so, uh, and they
[1:18:39] had all the percentages and everything
[1:18:40] else. And so, I called in and I said,
[1:18:45] "Well, I'd like I'd like you to, uh, I'd
[1:18:49] like to be able to say something about
[1:18:50] this." I said, "I'm a minister and I've
[1:18:52] conducted I forget how many at that
[1:18:55] time, maybe 75 or so marriages."
[1:18:58] And I said, "Our percentage of divorce
[1:19:01] is just a fraction of what you people
[1:19:04] are talking about.
[1:19:06] Just a fraction.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe like about 3%."
[1:19:12] Well, thank you. Click.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; They didn't want to talk about that.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Were they looking for an answer? Not a
[1:19:20] chance.
[1:19:23] You know, if somebody had said, "Uh,
[1:19:25] listen, I know where you can make, uh,
[1:19:27] you know, 3%," and somebody else says,
[1:19:29] "I know where you can make 30% on your
[1:19:32] investment." You wouldn't say, "Click,
[1:19:34] I've had enough of that." Say, "Where is
[1:19:36] it?"
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; I'd like to know where some of the
[1:19:40] success is. Do they want to? If you
[1:19:42] don't believe that God is amongst us,
[1:19:44] believe it for the work's sake.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Believe it for the evidence.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:51] And I have found that when that evidence
[1:19:54] becomes so uh uh so what shall I say so
[1:19:59] out in front
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; that it people do get afraid of it.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; They actually get afraid of it.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a life there never was a
[1:20:07] life like his life. Can you believe
[1:20:09] that?
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; There never was a life. Do you believe
[1:20:12] that?
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; There never was a uniqueness like the
[1:20:15] life of Jesus.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; How do you align? How do you get the
[1:20:19] things lined up in your mind that people
[1:20:22] just like the people of this day no
[1:20:26] different than back then? How do you get
[1:20:29] the lame that walked, the dumb that
[1:20:32] who's was loosed? How do you get those
[1:20:34] that threw themselves in the fire and in
[1:20:37] epileptic fits and was delivered? How do
[1:20:39] you get Lazarus raised from the dead?
[1:20:41] I'm talking about a small local country.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; This is not hundreds of millions of
[1:20:46] people. This is a small population. How
[1:20:49] do you get the things that are recorded
[1:20:50] in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John? And
[1:20:52] how do you end up each of those chapters
[1:20:55] with a man hanging on the cross?
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Because that perfect life was too strong
[1:21:00] for them.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; And they like the works and they like
[1:21:05] the bread and they like the fishes and
[1:21:06] they like the miracles and all of those
[1:21:08] things that that were exciting to the
[1:21:10] flesh. But it was when he said, "I and
[1:21:13] the father and are one."
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; That's where it was. And that's why a
[1:21:20] message like this morning, it's just not
[1:21:22] it's not that easy to digest because
[1:21:25] there's all kinds of things within your
[1:21:27] mind and within your being and within
[1:21:30] your past and within your expected
[1:21:32] future, your anticipated all kinds of
[1:21:34] things want to war against that.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Want to chop at it, want to belittle it,
[1:21:40] want to disgrace it in your mind, all
[1:21:43] kinds of things. And I'm here today to
[1:21:45] say to you, deny that.
[1:21:48] You have dwelt on that long enough.
[1:21:50] You've dwelt on the failure. You've
[1:21:52] dwelt on the negative long enough. Deny
[1:21:55] that and confess this and try that for a
[1:21:58] change. In fact, it's more than just try
[1:22:00] it. Say, "I'm going to accept that. I'm
[1:22:04] going to believe that. I'm going to
[1:22:06] practice that and watch this other be
[1:22:09] defeated."
[1:22:12] We've had negativism long enough
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; except in the name of Jesus Christ. What
[1:22:20] he said, I
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; am in you.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; And there will be a day coming and the
[1:22:25] prophet comes and says that's this day
[1:22:28] and he is in me.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; His life is in me.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Now you go to reasoning. Well, how does
[1:22:34] it and how does this? I don't know.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; I can't even figure out how bumblebee
[1:22:39] flies. How am I going to figure out this
[1:22:41] one?
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; All kinds of things I can't figure out.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered
[1:22:54] and said unto them, "Verily, verily, I
[1:22:56] say unto you, the Son can do nothing
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; nothing
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; of himself.
[1:23:03] If he can say I can't do I can do
[1:23:06] nothing of myself. Surely we can say the
[1:23:10] same thing. That's what that life said.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And he said I will be in you. And surely
[1:23:15] then we can say I can do nothing of
[1:23:19] myself of any eternal value of any
[1:23:23] eternal worth. I can do nothing of
[1:23:25] myself but what this life does in me
[1:23:28] that will be eternal. Hallelujah.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; I may say a lot of idle words,
[1:23:35] but the words that come from that life,
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; that'll be different.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; It's the life. You know, we try to make
[1:23:44] ourselves a separated people. People
[1:23:46] dress all kinds of ways. They have all
[1:23:48] kinds of veils and gowns and all kinds
[1:23:51] of robes and all kinds of things because
[1:23:53] that that's not what separates a person.
[1:23:56] That's why I said last Sunday, you may
[1:23:58] have long hair. You may wear a long
[1:23:59] dress. You brothers might be just as
[1:24:01] clean as a whistle. All the rest of it,
[1:24:02] and you think that separates you. No,
[1:24:04] that doesn't identify. All kinds of
[1:24:06] people do that.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; So, we got a nice home. We got a nice
[1:24:09] family or all kinds of nice families,
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; All kinds of nice people.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; It's not because you're blessed or
[1:24:16] you're not blessed or because you're
[1:24:17] healthy or because you're sick. It's not
[1:24:18] has nothing to do with it. Absolutely
[1:24:20] nothing to do with it. Nothing to do
[1:24:22] with it.
[1:24:25] We're human and we're so prone. Oh,
[1:24:28] because I'm dressed a certain way and
[1:24:29] I'm identified and they look at you and
[1:24:31] say you're different and and so we're
[1:24:33] thankful if someone has has a
[1:24:36] inquisitive or curious mind because they
[1:24:38] say, "Well, you you do look different."
[1:24:40] You're thankful for that. But that's not
[1:24:42] what separates you.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; What separates you is the life.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; And the only thing that on the outside
[1:24:48] that can count is something that results
[1:24:50] as a result of that life. Right?
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; So if the life that is in you and then
[1:24:54] you have a certain conviction about
[1:24:55] things say I'm not going to do that
[1:24:57] anymore.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to dress that way anymore.
[1:25:00] I'm not going to conduct myself that
[1:25:02] way. I'm not going to say those words
[1:25:04] anymore.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; I'm sure most everybody here at one time
[1:25:09] or another when I came out of the world,
[1:25:11] you know, they had a certain certain
[1:25:12] manner of speech and then one time you
[1:25:15] said it. Maybe you said it all through
[1:25:16] your life. Then one time you said it and
[1:25:18] you just felt a sting just inside. What
[1:25:21] was it? It was that life that was in you
[1:25:23] now giving a conviction about that. That
[1:25:26] was Christ in you. And the Holy Spirit
[1:25:28] is beginning to dictate. He say, "I'm
[1:25:30] not going to do that anymore." It was.
[1:25:32] And that's the only way that the outward
[1:25:34] man or the outward person can be a
[1:25:36] separated person. But what really
[1:25:38] separates you? You speak strange to the
[1:25:43] world.
[1:25:44] You see things differently.
[1:25:47] You cannot see things the way other
[1:25:50] people would see them. You're separated.
[1:25:53] The life that's in you is dictating to
[1:25:56] you what you are. And you become a
[1:25:58] separated person as Jesus was separate.
[1:26:01] Although he was a friend, you have
[1:26:03] associates, colleagues, you work with
[1:26:04] them. You have your peers, whatever more
[1:26:07] that you may be, you know, in your
[1:26:08] studies with and and at your workplace
[1:26:10] and whatever more and and and uh you may
[1:26:13] be considered a good friend of them. But
[1:26:17] Jesus was a friend of sinners, but he
[1:26:19] was separate from sinners because of the
[1:26:21] life that was in him.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:26:28] So God was in his son.
[1:26:32] Now the Bible says in John 1:14,
[1:26:36] "And the word
[1:26:38] was made flesh."
[1:26:42] You know, I've been ministering for a
[1:26:44] lot of years, but still things mystify
[1:26:47] me.
[1:26:49] And I was I was struggling with this
[1:26:51] this week. Say, "Do you struggle over
[1:26:52] things?" Yeah, I don't struggle. I don't
[1:26:54] wrestle with it, but I I I struggle with
[1:26:56] it. I think
[1:27:00] I'm going to say to the people on
[1:27:01] Sunday, you know, we hear it all the
[1:27:04] time. The word was made flesh.
[1:27:07] Hello. The word was h how does that
[1:27:11] happen? How how is the word?
[1:27:14] How is the word made flesh?
[1:27:19] This flesh came through natural birth of
[1:27:22] my father through my mother. How is
[1:27:25] this? And quite frankly, I had a big
[1:27:29] problem this week. And the big problem
[1:27:31] was
[1:27:33] I was seeing and I was trying to
[1:27:36] comprehend
[1:27:38] the holiness
[1:27:40] of God.
[1:27:42] The absolute purity,
[1:27:45] the holiness of God that is
[1:27:48] so
[1:27:51] indescribably
[1:27:54] righteous. I thought, how do I even come
[1:27:58] into his presence?
[1:28:00] How do I, poor human
[1:28:04] seem like you have all kinds of things,
[1:28:06] filthy, dirty things hanging on you in
[1:28:10] the world. And I, how can I say that?
[1:28:14] Something that uttered out of the very
[1:28:16] mind of God and spoke it and took men
[1:28:20] and captivated them and they uttered
[1:28:23] these holy words and they were inscribed
[1:28:26] and left to us in a book called the
[1:28:28] Bible. How is that word from the mouth
[1:28:32] of Almighty God, how does that become
[1:28:35] flesh in me?
[1:28:41] you're quiet and I was quiet.
[1:28:43] I said, "God,
[1:28:46] my mind can't get around that.
[1:28:49] I can't grasp that.
[1:28:52] I'll just have to believe it.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; I'll just have to believe it." And as I
[1:28:58] as I took that position, something
[1:29:00] wonderful be to happen.
[1:29:03] That's when I begin to realize
[1:29:06] when I
[1:29:09] hear down in the
[1:29:13] resources of my soul, I hear a word
[1:29:18] and the words sound too wonderful for
[1:29:20] me. It tells me
[1:29:23] I can be free. It tells me I can live
[1:29:26] forever.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:29] tells me things that I can't grasp with
[1:29:33] this impunity mind of mine. It tells me
[1:29:36] things that are too glorious.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; My mind can't even think. I can't even
[1:29:40] grasp the holiness
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; of God, let alone to try to grasp how
[1:29:47] that life is going to come and live and
[1:29:49] become flesh in me.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Now, this is where it gets strong. I'll
[1:29:55] tell you what, friends. The
[1:29:56] denominational world know nothing about
[1:29:58] what I'm speaking about today.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Don't even come near it. We only can
[1:30:05] approach it because a a messenger has
[1:30:07] brought it and exposed the whole thing.
[1:30:09] Says there it is. Eat it.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; There it is. Believe it.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; And it can never come into reality in
[1:30:16] our lives unless we do.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Take it and assimilate it and keep it
[1:30:20] and hold it and embrace it.
[1:30:25] I have so many things
[1:30:28] I want to bring to you.
[1:30:32] And as I pondered upon this, I thought
[1:30:35] the life that consumes most of my time,
[1:30:39] so much of my time, and so much of my
[1:30:42] thoughts, it's life that takes, you
[1:30:45] know, I'm going to step into the car.
[1:30:47] I'm going to run down while you want me
[1:30:48] to get a loaf of bread. Uh, you know, we
[1:30:52] take out the garbage. We mow the lawn.
[1:30:55] We go to school. You got your studies.
[1:30:56] You got your books. What you're going to
[1:30:58] do, what you're going to be.
[1:31:00] You maybe got, you know, you got
[1:31:02] doctor's appointments and dentist
[1:31:03] appointments and whatever more. We got a
[1:31:05] a life that's just a normal life. And
[1:31:07] we're all consumed with this kind of a
[1:31:09] thing. But when we start to think of,
[1:31:11] excuse my pacing back and forth, but we
[1:31:13] start to think, I start to say, how is
[1:31:15] this word, how is this righteous, holy
[1:31:19] God, how is this word going to be made
[1:31:22] flesh? Because that in reality is what
[1:31:24] has to happen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; That is what the prophet's talking
[1:31:28] about. I said, "Oh God, give me some
[1:31:30] scope of understanding here of what's
[1:31:33] taking place. Help me to convey some of
[1:31:35] this to the people this morning. this
[1:31:37] this life that was so separated. This
[1:31:39] life that was so unique. This life that
[1:31:41] was so marvelous. This life that was so
[1:31:44] holy. How is that going to come? I
[1:31:46] understand it in Jesus Christ. But how's
[1:31:48] it going to come into me?
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; It's not some figment of the
[1:31:53] imagination. Everybody talking today
[1:31:55] they're all born again. That's a lot of
[1:31:57] nonsense.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Well, I I shed some tears. All kinds of
[1:32:04] people shed tears and weep. I've been to
[1:32:06] an altar. Millions have been to an
[1:32:08] altar.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; There has to be something that is an
[1:32:14] actual happening, a reality
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; that takes place.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; How's that going to be?
[1:32:22] I just Here's the recipe.
[1:32:26] You hear it. You hear his word.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Not necessarily a preacher's word, but
[1:32:32] you hear his word. How does his word
[1:32:35] come? His word comes from the scripture
[1:32:37] and his word comes vindicated through
[1:32:40] his prophets.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; The Lord will do nothing unless he
[1:32:44] speaks it or reveals it or through his
[1:32:46] prophets. He speaks it in his prophets.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; We believe that
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; we have received a message.
[1:32:55] God has vindicated that message. You
[1:32:58] receive that word.
[1:33:00] Then the Holy Spirit who's brooding over
[1:33:03] the entire earth at this moment. I'll
[1:33:05] tell you what he's brooding for. He's
[1:33:07] looking for a seed
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; that he can brood over. A seed.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; He broods over stones and it doesn't
[1:33:16] bring There's a lot of earth that has no
[1:33:18] seed in it. And there's a lot of earth
[1:33:20] that has tears in it.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; It has all kinds of seed in it. It has
[1:33:24] thistles in it. It has all kinds of
[1:33:26] things. But the Holy Ghost is brooding
[1:33:29] over the earth to find that seed that
[1:33:32] came out of the mouth of God.
[1:33:35] And when he finds it, he stays there and
[1:33:39] broods over it till that seed comes to
[1:33:42] life.
[1:33:44] And when that seed comes to life, that
[1:33:46] seed is stronger than the seed that
[1:33:48] brought this body into life.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Stronger. stronger. My brother, my
[1:33:55] sister, the seed that brought this body
[1:33:57] into life will take me to a grave. But
[1:34:00] the seed that came in by believing his
[1:34:02] word will take me to heaven.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; It's stronger.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; You got your mothers, you got your
[1:34:13] fathers, you got your ancestors, and we
[1:34:15] thank God for that. But I have a parent
[1:34:17] in heaven,
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; my father.
[1:34:21] [Applause]
[1:34:23] who let seed come from his mouth,
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; spoke it,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; and a man believes it
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; and that springs to life because then
[1:34:33] the spirit comes to that seed. Yeah.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; A human spirit came to this natural life
[1:34:43] and I came out of my mother's womb as
[1:34:45] you did and we gave that breath of life
[1:34:48] and maybe had a spank so that we would
[1:34:51] be startled and we we cried out
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; as the prophet said in an unknown
[1:34:56] tongue.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Cried out. Nobody knew what we were
[1:34:59] crying about but it said one thing.
[1:35:01] We've come to life
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; and everybody's happy. The child came to
[1:35:06] life.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Many do not.
[1:35:12] They're still born. They had a perfect
[1:35:14] conception. Nothing wrong with the seed.
[1:35:17] Nothing wrong with the pregnancy.
[1:35:19] Nothing wrong with the birth. Nothing
[1:35:20] wrong with the forming of the child. The
[1:35:22] child has 10 fingers, 10 toes. It's
[1:35:25] perfectly fine. But if it doesn't take
[1:35:27] that breath of life, if that spirit
[1:35:29] doesn't enter, that human spirit, it'll
[1:35:31] never animate.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; We don't know what it's going to be
[1:35:34] like.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; We don't know whether it's a, you know,
[1:35:36] a timid person or a a boisterous person.
[1:35:39] We don't know what they're going to
[1:35:40] manifest. But when that spirit came and
[1:35:42] likewise so it was when the spirit of
[1:35:45] God came to the word of God and a life
[1:35:48] came within it. Hallelujah. And a call
[1:35:51] came and you became something you never
[1:35:53] dreamed you could become. You became a
[1:35:56] liberated, free son and daughter of God.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's thus sayith the word
[1:36:01] of God.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; And that is the one when Jesus said, "I
[1:36:06] will be in you."
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; That's how he's in you.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; I will be in you.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; And you'll be in me. And you couldn't
[1:36:17] understand this at this level had not a
[1:36:22] prophet come and spelled it out for us.
[1:36:26] And I'm seeking to bring it to you this
[1:36:28] morning. Another few moments, please.
[1:36:34] He said, "The fullness,
[1:36:37] all that was in Christ was poured into
[1:36:42] the church."
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Yes.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; was poured into the church.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the fullness of the Godhead
[1:36:53] bodily.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; And that fullness was poured into the
[1:36:57] church.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; An invisible union of the bride. Now,
[1:37:05] it's narrowing down. So, I want you to
[1:37:07] really pay strict attention.
[1:37:10] He said, "And so was God manifested in
[1:37:13] the beginning. And finally
[1:37:15] he was appeared as Jehovah
[1:37:19] God the father.
[1:37:21] Then he appeared as God the son in Jesus
[1:37:25] Christ. Now
[1:37:27] he's appeared as God the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; The same God all the time. Three
[1:37:33] manifestations of the same God. He said,
[1:37:36] "And now we find that in each
[1:37:38] generation,
[1:37:40] God has allotted his word from the
[1:37:43] beginning." Just like evolution came,
[1:37:47] first thing God created probably was
[1:37:49] botney life and then he created animal
[1:37:51] life and then he created human life
[1:37:54] next. Kind of an evolution rising
[1:37:58] higher.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; So has it been? You got the evolution
[1:38:04] now. So has it been in his church
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; justification under Luther. And he stops
[1:38:13] and says that's pulling his bride out.
[1:38:17] Now
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; this is different. He's not creating a
[1:38:20] creation so that God can be in his
[1:38:23] creation.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; He's not even creating a nation. Oh,
[1:38:28] there was I could have keep you here
[1:38:29] half the afternoon speaking about how
[1:38:31] God,
[1:38:33] you know, separated his people by
[1:38:36] separating Abraham out from his people.
[1:38:39] Then he separated a nation out of all
[1:38:41] the nations out of Abraham. And then
[1:38:44] when that nation became immersed in
[1:38:46] slavery in Egypt, God separated them
[1:38:48] again.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; And then they married and they married
[1:38:54] with the Moabites and God hated that.
[1:38:57] and despise that idolatry and so on and
[1:38:59] so forth. But they continued on
[1:39:01] righteous kings, unrighteous kings, all
[1:39:02] the rest of it. And then they come to
[1:39:04] the come to uh the time when Jesus came
[1:39:08] and then he separates once again. He's
[1:39:10] bringing one out of that nation who's
[1:39:13] totally separate of sinners.
[1:39:17] And so he said, and so now he's pulling
[1:39:19] out his bride. The church was born. You
[1:39:23] following me? Yes,
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; the church was born on the day of
[1:39:27] Pentecost and it continues for some time
[1:39:30] and then they begin to uh merge the word
[1:39:33] once again and take in a trinity
[1:39:36] doctrine and all of these things
[1:39:40] and God has to do another separation. So
[1:39:43] he begins to call out a people. Now he's
[1:39:46] pulling out his bride. He pulling out
[1:39:49] his bride bride. Not just a church now
[1:39:51] pulling out a bride because a bride
[1:39:54] knows an intimacy of the one who's
[1:39:57] calling her out. Much more than and then
[1:40:00] a God in heaven calling out a church.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Much more than even God calling Abraham
[1:40:07] and saying, "Leave your people. Leave
[1:40:09] your kindred to a place I'll show you."
[1:40:11] That was wonderful. But that's not the
[1:40:13] intimacy of a bride in a bridegroom.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus, even Jesus walking the
[1:40:20] streets of Jerusalem and in Israel
[1:40:22] manifesting himself that was marvelous
[1:40:24] and dying the death without without
[1:40:27] which we would all be lost. That's
[1:40:29] absolutely glorious. But yet there was
[1:40:32] not an intimacy with Jesus and Israel as
[1:40:35] there is now
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; more and more. The prophet says more and
[1:40:39] more is the time the evolution was more
[1:40:42] and more until from the botney life
[1:40:44] until it finally came up into a into a
[1:40:46] man in the image of God. More and more
[1:40:49] uh Israel being evoluted evolved all the
[1:40:52] way through the Old Testament till there
[1:40:54] came Jesus Christ the son of the living
[1:40:56] God. And then the church then the spirit
[1:40:58] that was in Christ came into the church
[1:41:00] and now the church is born and now the
[1:41:01] church is moving. And then it goes into
[1:41:03] darkness and it goes into
[1:41:05] denominationalism and it goes into the
[1:41:07] slavery of Rome. And then once again God
[1:41:09] is making separation. And out comes a
[1:41:11] Luther. Now starts another evolution.
[1:41:13] Now comes the justification coming up
[1:41:15] through the through the lower part of
[1:41:17] the body evolving it up. Then comes the
[1:41:20] sanctification. Amen.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; More and more. And then comes the gifts
[1:41:25] of the Holy Spirit more and more. So he
[1:41:27] said he he's creating his bride.
[1:41:30] justification under Luther,
[1:41:31] sanctification under Wesley and so
[1:41:33] forth. See he said the evolution of the
[1:41:35] spirit giving being given more and more
[1:41:39] because the body's building coming to
[1:41:41] the head which is Christ the body of
[1:41:43] Christ coming up to the head building it
[1:41:45] up building it up and evolution and
[1:41:49] friends we're not in the feet
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; you're not in the thighs
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; you're not in the breast
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; the head has come to the body
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; and in that day you will know I have
[1:42:04] And I am in
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; I'm in the bride.
[1:42:08] [Applause]
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; You may not feel it. You may not even be
[1:42:16] able to say that by any sensation that
[1:42:17] you have. All you need to know
[1:42:21] and if you want to know what brother
[1:42:23] Biscll did today, I just said again in
[1:42:27] prayer
[1:42:29] in the sincerity of my heart. I said,
[1:42:30] "God,
[1:42:33] a lot of things I don't know. One thing
[1:42:36] I do know, you were in that prophet."
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; One thing I know, you spoke those
[1:42:42] things. One thing I know, that pillar of
[1:42:45] fire was there and revealed the very
[1:42:47] secret of those hearts. And whether I
[1:42:49] feel anything, whether I sense anything,
[1:42:51] I will make this statement. God, you
[1:42:54] were in the people.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; God is in his people once again.
[1:42:58] Hallelujah. More so than at any time in
[1:43:01] the human history, God is in his people.
[1:43:05] God came amongst us. And that is why he
[1:43:07] comes to the unveiling of God. The
[1:43:09] unveiling of God. He's trying to say it
[1:43:11] as clearly as he can. He trying to tell
[1:43:13] them God is behind skin. And then he
[1:43:16] brings it down and down until he says,
[1:43:18] "And God, this God is behind your skin."
[1:43:21] Amen.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; It's not enough just to say it wasn't a
[1:43:24] prophet,
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; but now
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; God was even showing because God always
[1:43:28] did in his prophets what he wanted the
[1:43:30] people to receive for themselves.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; God, that was God. friends.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; If you know nothing more and don't get
[1:43:42] anything more out of this service than
[1:43:44] to be able to go home today and go out
[1:43:46] of these doors and say, "God of Israel,
[1:43:51] God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, God,
[1:43:55] you came." And that is how there's many,
[1:43:58] many places. I wouldn't have time to go
[1:44:00] into them now. When brother Brandham
[1:44:02] made the he made the reference that way,
[1:44:05] he referenced it that way. And then he
[1:44:07] would say, "God is in his church."
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; And he'd be right at the moment of
[1:44:11] displaying that God was right there.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Now, you see, he's being kind, but quite
[1:44:17] frankly, what he was doing, saying,
[1:44:18] "This God that is in me is in the
[1:44:22] church."
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; And I'll prove there isn't anybody else.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; You're a nice group of people. And you
[1:44:30] may think well of me. I trust you do.
[1:44:34] But I can't prove what he proved.
[1:44:37] I can't say it just that way. I cannot
[1:44:40] say now in the next few moments we'll
[1:44:43] I'll show you the father
[1:44:47] just can't do that.
[1:44:51] But he could,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz he knew he was called to do that
[1:44:54] thing. But I can do something. I can say
[1:44:58] that God
[1:45:00] that ordained him and brought him there,
[1:45:03] that's my God.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; And that God that spoke out of his
[1:45:08] mouth, that's my God.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; And I have heard those words.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; And I have believed those words.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; And now by virtue of that, that spirit
[1:45:17] has come to those words.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And gave me a life I didn't
[1:45:22] dream I could ever have. I have that
[1:45:24] life. And by virtue of that action, I
[1:45:27] can say God is in me.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is in me. God is in you.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; You need to say that.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Why don't we say that? God is in me.
[1:45:42] Hallelujah. Say it again. God is in me.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I have believed his word.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; I believed the spoken word. And I know
[1:45:50] that was God in that prophet. And I know
[1:45:52] that that God is in me.
[1:45:56] Hallelujah.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you feel.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; You can feel like a you can feel like a
[1:46:04] telephone pole if you want or you might
[1:46:06] feel like like you're in heavenly
[1:46:07] places. That has nothing to do with it.
[1:46:10] It has to do that you can say that.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; And you don't hardly need a a
[1:46:14] revelation. You just need to acknowledge
[1:46:18] that was God.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't see it. I saw it.
[1:46:22] You're listening to a live testimony.
[1:46:24] You're leaving to a You're listening to
[1:46:25] an eyewitness. And one day, I may not be
[1:46:28] here, but I want you to be able to be
[1:46:30] anchored and say, "We had as a pastor, a
[1:46:33] man who heard it, a man who saw it, and
[1:46:36] I believed his words, and I have it in
[1:46:38] the book, and I have it on the tape, but
[1:46:40] I have a living testimony, and I listen
[1:46:42] to it, and I heard it for some years,
[1:46:44] and I believe in that, God."
[1:46:49] And just by making that declaration,
[1:46:51] change your life.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; And you'll be able to say years down the
[1:46:54] road, I never believed I could have this
[1:46:56] kind of a life. I didn't know. Listen to
[1:46:58] me, my friends. By doing that, I can
[1:47:01] I'll tell you this. In the name of Jesus
[1:47:02] Christ, the blessings of God are already
[1:47:05] on that word. You don't have to ask for
[1:47:07] blessings. You simply have to receive
[1:47:09] that word in its fullness, and you are
[1:47:12] blessed.
[1:47:17] God bless your home. God bless your
[1:47:19] children. God bless your basket. God
[1:47:21] bless your store. God bless your health.
[1:47:23] God bless your job. God bless you.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; And he may bless He may bless you in
[1:47:29] allowing you to suffer in some way that
[1:47:31] will get him glory. And I might say if
[1:47:33] so, let it be.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:43] God is in his people.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; God is in his bride.
[1:47:59] I'm going to close.
[1:48:01] Just after the day of Pentecost,
[1:48:06] there came a young man
[1:48:09] and his name was Stephen.
[1:48:20] Steven became the first martyr.
[1:48:24] He was a young man. He didn't get to
[1:48:25] live very long.
[1:48:40] He stood there that morning at the
[1:48:43] Sanhedrin court and they accused him and
[1:48:47] he stood alone, just him alone up before
[1:48:50] the great Sanhedrin court. Maybe two or
[1:48:53] three thousand Jews or 5,000
[1:48:59] Stephen, he was just a young man. Young
[1:49:01] man,
[1:49:05] he had a revelation
[1:49:07] that the spirit that came on the day of
[1:49:09] Pentecost was in him.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; He knew that he believed the words of
[1:49:13] the Messiah.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; And he knew that God was in him.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; He began to speak to the Sanhedrin.
[1:49:24] standing there, he said, with a pointing
[1:49:25] finger. And the Bible said that when he
[1:49:27] walked out there, looked like his face
[1:49:30] was that of an angel.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean he had a light shining
[1:49:35] from his face. An angel would be a
[1:49:37] messenger that knowed what he was
[1:49:39] talking about.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Like his face was shining with the glory
[1:49:43] of God. He had a confidence.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Didn't come from the Sanhedrin. Didn't
[1:49:48] come from the Levites. Didn't come from
[1:49:49] the high priest. He knew where he stood.
[1:49:53] Some of you young people just coming
[1:49:55] into that place where finally for once
[1:49:57] in your life, you know where you stand.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; You know what you believe.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; And God wants to take that youth and
[1:50:03] that energy and use it for the kingdom
[1:50:05] of God. Never be ashamed of it. And
[1:50:07] don't even hesitate for a moment. Just
[1:50:10] say, "I've been called on the scene for
[1:50:11] this hour."
[1:50:13] [Applause]
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; As Steven was
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; and his face was like a brilliant light
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; and he walked out there not afraid of
[1:50:28] death. He wasn't afraid of nothing
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; because he knew what he was talking
[1:50:33] about.
[1:50:35] He says, "And Steven walked out there
[1:50:36] before the Sanhedrin court like a sheep
[1:50:39] among a pack of wolves. He was hounding
[1:50:42] for his blood. And they accused him and
[1:50:45] pointed an accusing finger at him. And
[1:50:47] what did he do? He said, "Men and
[1:50:49] brethren, the God of glory appeared to
[1:50:52] our father Abraham." He started right
[1:50:54] back at Abraham when Abraham was
[1:50:55] separated while he was yet in
[1:50:57] Mesopotamia and before he was called out
[1:51:00] and he went ahead and brought all the
[1:51:02] history down of Abraham and how that all
[1:51:04] through that he would bring in the
[1:51:06] Gentiles and when he got to a certain
[1:51:07] place looked at him full of the Holy
[1:51:10] Ghost and they couldn't wait any longer
[1:51:11] to get their hands on him and he said
[1:51:14] you stiff necked and uncircumcised in
[1:51:16] heart and ears you always resist the
[1:51:18] Holy Ghost like your fathers did so do
[1:51:20] ye. And he said he was God's advi
[1:51:24] advertisement.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Speaking about being an advertise,
[1:51:27] talking about being a billboard and
[1:51:29] saying to the people of this day, you're
[1:51:31] God's billboard. Hallelujah. You're a
[1:51:34] billboard before the world. You're
[1:51:36] making a declaration to the world of
[1:51:38] what is holy and what is righteous.
[1:51:41] Hallelujah. You're a you're a a
[1:51:43] messenger for this message.
[1:51:46] What would this message be just in a
[1:51:48] book or a tape form if it wasn't a lived
[1:51:50] out life? And that's the whole core of
[1:51:53] my message. It is a lived out life.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:58] Glory to God. I say to you in the name
[1:52:00] of Jesus Christ, God in this generation,
[1:52:03] he is restricted
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; by what you do, by what you say because
[1:52:09] God is in his people.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:15] God's expressing himself in his people.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed of him.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And he said,
[1:52:23] he said,
[1:52:25] "We don't have
[1:52:27] Oh," he said. And then, uh, excuse me.
[1:52:30] He said, "There may have been 5,000. How
[1:52:32] many of them got saved?" He said, he
[1:52:35] said there was 5,000
[1:52:37] where Stephen was.
[1:52:40] And he says, "How many got saved?"
[1:52:44] Brother B said there was one.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; He never accepted it right then.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; But years later,
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; there was one who held the coat.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; His name was Saul.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; And that stayed on Saul's mind. I held
[1:53:03] the coat
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; of Steven. I saw the glory of God. What
[1:53:08] he saw was the life of Christ in one
[1:53:10] young man.
[1:53:12] Yes.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Saul had young Pharisees standing there
[1:53:17] consulted and gave witness to his death.
[1:53:19] And when he saw that advertisement of
[1:53:22] the power of the resurrected Christ in
[1:53:25] that little fellow, he said he never got
[1:53:28] away from it.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Steven never even knew it.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Saul, that Pharisee was watching and
[1:53:38] giving consent. Stone him boys.
[1:53:42] layers coated at your feet. Yes. Torn
[1:53:44] him.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; He's one of these we have to get. But
[1:53:47] his Saul could never get away from that.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I declare to you,
[1:53:53] there's people that walk to you, walk
[1:53:54] with you. There's people who live beside
[1:53:56] you will never get away from the
[1:53:58] testimony of Jesus Christ that's in your
[1:54:00] life.
[1:54:06] And wouldn't you be rewarded
[1:54:08] if you lived a whole life and brought
[1:54:10] one on the other side? Just brought one.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; You young fellows, you young ladies or
[1:54:15] this congregation, wouldn't it be worth
[1:54:17] it if just one steps on the other side
[1:54:20] and says, "Let me shake your hand.
[1:54:22] You're live. You live beside me. You
[1:54:24] were my neighbor. I never told you what
[1:54:27] was going on, but I saw the glory of God
[1:54:29] in your faith. I saw how you lived. I
[1:54:32] saw how you conducted business, how you
[1:54:34] conduct I saw how you handle your
[1:54:36] children.
[1:54:38] I'm here because of you.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, you're going
[1:54:44] to say, "Heaven just became sweeter.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Heaven just became sweeter."
[1:54:54] says that same Paul,
[1:54:57] that same man Paul, that one standing
[1:55:00] there that morning led tens of thousands
[1:55:03] of souls to Christ because one man was
[1:55:06] willing to give his life as an
[1:55:08] advertising board for Jesus Christ.
[1:55:14] We don't have big audiences, Brother
[1:55:16] Brandham says.
[1:55:22] I say this to you now. We don't have to
[1:55:25] preach to 10,000.
[1:55:28] We don't even have to preach.
[1:55:31] We can be God's advertisement board.
[1:55:36] How do you know that your life?
[1:55:38] How do you know that your life might not
[1:55:40] start a young man on the gospel or some
[1:55:44] o some of you older men and you old
[1:55:46] women start them young men on the field
[1:55:49] out there to win 10,000 souls to Christ?
[1:55:52] It was because that he sought Christ in
[1:55:54] you. It was it it's you presented Christ
[1:55:58] to him in the simple power of the
[1:56:01] gospel.
[1:56:03] He said Paul never got away from it
[1:56:06] because he seen Christ reflected. He
[1:56:09] said, "How did Stephen do it?"
[1:56:13] Congregation,
[1:56:16] how are you going to do it?
[1:56:20] Said he never performed any miracles.
[1:56:24] Although he knew that Christ was in the
[1:56:26] was a miracle performer. He knew all
[1:56:29] those powers and things. But what did he
[1:56:31] do?
[1:56:32] He just presented his life in such a way
[1:56:35] that they seen that it was the power of
[1:56:37] Christ. You may never see a vision.
[1:56:41] You may never put your hands on a sick
[1:56:43] person and feel the charge of almighty
[1:56:45] God make a skeleton of a man turn back
[1:56:48] to life again. You may never see him
[1:56:50] standing out yonder in three or four
[1:56:52] rainbows.
[1:56:53] You may never see his image.
[1:56:56] You may never hear his voice, but still
[1:57:00] you can be his signboard.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Do you accept that? Does this
[1:57:06] congregation believe that?
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; I may never do may never have a vision.
[1:57:09] I may never do great things. I may never
[1:57:11] lay hands on the sick. I may never
[1:57:12] preach a sermon. I may never do anything
[1:57:15] that is outstanding.
[1:57:17] But I will accept what God's vindicated
[1:57:20] messenger says. I am his billboard. I am
[1:57:23] his advertisement in this generation and
[1:57:26] I will show forth the life of Jesus
[1:57:29] Christ.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; And that life is a separated life. Young
[1:57:35] people, don't try to mingle it and mix
[1:57:37] it up. It doesn't mix with all the stuff
[1:57:39] that's around you. Just say, "I'm so
[1:57:42] glad this billboard is different than
[1:57:44] all the other billboards. This is a
[1:57:47] different life, and I'm not going to try
[1:57:48] to make it the same."
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; God be praised. Amen.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; I
[1:57:57] will be in you
[1:57:59] and you in me
[1:58:01] and I in the father and we are all one.
[1:58:07] Isn't that lovely?
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Isn't that lovely?
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:17] This Jesus that we love so deeply
[1:58:20] is saying today, I am I am in you.
[1:58:28] And you're going to live this life.
[1:58:31] You're going to stand. You're going to
[1:58:33] be true.
[1:58:36] You're going to live this life because
[1:58:38] there's going to be a force in you,
[1:58:44] a power in you. And somebody's going to
[1:58:47] see that life
[1:58:49] might might be your children,
[1:58:54] might be your husband or wife, might be
[1:58:56] your neighbor, might be your friend, but
[1:58:59] they're going to see that life in you.
[1:59:02] That meant a lot to me. Even when I was
[1:59:04] I I I look at you young man. I put
[1:59:06] myself back there 17 and 18 years old
[1:59:14] and I had friends in the church and
[1:59:15] outside of the church.
[1:59:17] But when God got a hold of my heart,
[1:59:20] I began to realize that I was being
[1:59:22] drawn into. And let me say to you young
[1:59:24] people,
[1:59:27] God drew you into a special place.
[1:59:32] And he intends to carry on with that
[1:59:34] communion with you. And that has
[1:59:37] separated you from multitudes. When what
[1:59:39] has happened in the last few weeks took
[1:59:41] place that separated you from absolutely
[1:59:44] millions and millions of people your
[1:59:47] same age, you're beginning to experience
[1:59:50] something.
[1:59:51] You know, last Sunday,
[1:59:54] last Sunday night
[1:59:57] when I I was kind of specific. I said,
[1:59:59] "We want to sing." And it was the same
[2:00:01] God.
[2:00:05] And I asked I said I want only those of
[2:00:08] you only those that have that testimony
[2:00:10] that you want to make a declaration.
[2:00:13] It was God that did a great thing in me.
[2:00:18] I only want and I didn't know I actually
[2:00:20] had thought about it because I was
[2:00:22] thinking about it all through the
[2:00:23] service and I even thought I might you
[2:00:25] know if there was only 10 or 12 or 15 I
[2:00:28] might get the microphone and hand the
[2:00:29] microphone down and so they can say
[2:00:32] after one after the other. It was a
[2:00:34] great thing. It was a great thing. It
[2:00:36] was a great thing. I want to hear it out
[2:00:37] a number of mouths. And I thought, well,
[2:00:40] maybe at the very most we might have 50.
[2:00:44] But when you leapt up out of your seats
[2:00:46] and came forward, I tell you what, I
[2:00:50] will tell you before God and eternity
[2:00:52] can eternity
[2:00:55] will confirm this. God was very pleased.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; He was very pleased with that kind of
[2:01:01] response. said, "I want to stand there
[2:01:03] and I want to declare to not only this
[2:01:05] people, but whoever sees it."
[2:01:09] I got an email says it looked like there
[2:01:11] were hundreds up there. I want to
[2:01:13] declare
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; this testimony. God saw that
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; and God wants you to continue and you'll
[2:01:21] experience even what your brother in the
[2:01:24] Christ and your pastor experienced.
[2:01:27] I began to realize there were there were
[2:01:29] some in the church
[2:01:31] and all of my so-called friends in the
[2:01:33] world that knew nothing about the
[2:01:35] relationship and they the experience
[2:01:37] that I was having having and I just want
[2:01:39] I declared in my within myself I vowed
[2:01:41] within myself I would live so that they
[2:01:44] could see it throughout life
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; and I've never been sorry
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; never been sorry once God is in his
[2:01:50] people once again friends
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; God is in his people.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; We'll bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[2:02:00] your word has been spoken.
[2:02:03] There's such an atmosphere here just
[2:02:05] now. And the people
[2:02:09] have believing hearts. They're just so
[2:02:12] receptive.
[2:02:14] And I'm praying that your spirit, oh
[2:02:16] God, will come and make every
[2:02:21] uh every word just such a reality. Lord,
[2:02:24] I pray that you'll bless this
[2:02:26] congregation,
[2:02:27] bless this people, Father, and let the
[2:02:31] testimony of them go far and wide
[2:02:36] around the earth or to whatever place
[2:02:38] you would have it be. May there be a man
[2:02:42] or woman here, Lord, that will live in
[2:02:44] such a way as serving the same Christ
[2:02:47] that Steven was serving. Lord, may we
[2:02:50] not lose sight of the God that is
[2:02:53] manifesting and showing himself in us.
[2:02:56] Do bless, Lord.
[2:02:58] There are those that are needy.
[2:03:01] Would you reach out now, Lord? Perhaps
[2:03:04] they feel insufficient.
[2:03:07] Perhaps they feel a lack of confidence,
[2:03:09] a lack of self-esteem.
[2:03:12] Let them relegate that to where it
[2:03:14] should be and pass it off to that
[2:03:16] natural birth and say, "But by the birth
[2:03:20] that you, oh Father, have given me, I
[2:03:22] only know what you have said concerning
[2:03:24] that life, a life that has never known
[2:03:26] defeat, a life that has never succumbed
[2:03:29] to the enemy." And now, oh God, let that
[2:03:33] individual or those individuals that
[2:03:36] you're speaking to just now rise above
[2:03:38] that, oh God. And I pray, Father, that
[2:03:41] the powers of hell will be broken and
[2:03:44] chains will be shattered in the name of
[2:03:47] Jesus Christ. And that what you desire
[2:03:50] to have accomplished, Lord, will be done
[2:03:52] so in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. I'll
[2:03:56] have you stand with me. And I I want to
[2:04:00] sing uh
[2:04:03] I think it's 2019. Hear the hear the
[2:04:06] cries of the shackle. And then and then
[2:04:09] we're going to sing God is in his
[2:04:10] people.
[2:04:18] Now we sing this quite often.
[2:04:26] We sing this and you sing it with a
[2:04:28] great deal of
[2:04:31] fervor and zeal.
[2:04:34] But there may be somebody here
[2:04:36] that you're feeling the shackles
[2:04:40] and you know that you're not as yet at
[2:04:43] as of this moment free. Let me just say
[2:04:45] to you, you don't have to be
[2:04:46] embarrassed. You don't have to be
[2:04:48] identified.
[2:04:50] You don't have to make a great big
[2:04:51] public statement. But I will say to you
[2:04:54] in the name of Jesus Christ, what you
[2:04:56] what you must do in order to be free,
[2:05:00] you've got to confess and say what God
[2:05:01] has said. And I would recommend that you
[2:05:04] say, "I will believe the words that were
[2:05:06] spoken this morning." I can tell you
[2:05:08] friends, this is not my thoughts. I
[2:05:10] didn't have this as my thoughts. I
[2:05:12] believe this came from God for somebody
[2:05:14] here. And maybe you're that Saul. Maybe
[2:05:16] you're that one and you just want to
[2:05:18] you'll just raise your hand while we
[2:05:20] sing this song and say, "I've had those
[2:05:22] shackles and right now I am denying
[2:05:25] their I'm denying their right to be on
[2:05:28] my body." Hallelujah.
[2:05:31] Glory to God.
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, that the
[2:05:38] people of God be free. And whom the son
[2:05:40] says free is free indeed.
[2:05:45] Hear the cries
[2:05:47] of the shackles
[2:05:50] from the onset
[2:05:52] of time.
[2:05:54] For the chains of defeat, there's no
[2:05:58] peace.
[2:06:02] See the tears
[2:06:04] of the broken,
[2:06:06] the cry
[2:06:08] of the slaves. Is there no?
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we love this. And then the
[2:06:19] crying
[2:06:21] is still
[2:06:27] the shadow.
[2:06:30] [Music]
[2:06:44] worthy.
[2:06:51] Oh, he's so worthy.
[2:06:57] Worthy
[2:06:59] worthy
[2:07:01] worthy.
[2:07:11] Heat. Heat.
[2:07:22] I say
[2:07:51] Yeah.
[2:07:53] Heat.
[2:08:04] Yeah.
[2:08:07] Heat.
[2:08:33] We're going to sing serve him and love
[2:08:35] him. But before we do,
[2:08:39] perhaps you feel restricted and bound
[2:08:42] and Satan has robbed you. I deny that
[2:08:45] enemy having any right on any soul. And
[2:08:49] if you're an inquiring, if you're a
[2:08:51] hungering soul,
[2:08:53] just now slip up your hand. If you've
[2:08:57] been bound, if you've been hindered and
[2:09:00] we're going to pray. This congregation
[2:09:02] is going to pray. There's going to be
[2:09:04] people praying that aren't even here in
[2:09:06] the visible audience. For all of those
[2:09:08] that are streaming, I say every believer
[2:09:10] pray. Let us bring the power of God and
[2:09:14] the deliverance of Jesus Christ to the
[2:09:17] in to the hungry heart and the desiring
[2:09:19] and the needy one.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Father God,
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; eternal in the heavens that has called
[2:09:27] us to this moment that has sent such a
[2:09:30] voice as you have. And I have testified
[2:09:32] today that you are in your people. I've
[2:09:36] testified today that you are in the
[2:09:39] bride of Jesus Christ. And as your
[2:09:41] prophet has declared it, lo Lord, so do
[2:09:44] I declare it. Even so, Lord, it is thus,
[2:09:48] sayaith the Lord, you are in your
[2:09:50] people. I am in you and you in in me.
[2:09:54] And Lord Jesus, it is that life. It is
[2:09:57] that desire within us, oh God, that is
[2:10:00] there to bring deliverance to those that
[2:10:03] are bound. And may Satan now be defeated
[2:10:07] in the name of Jesus Christ. Satan, we
[2:10:10] adjure you by the living God to depart
[2:10:14] from the individual that is seeking,
[2:10:17] that is reaching out, that is calling
[2:10:19] upon the name of the Lord. Call upon him
[2:10:23] and you shall be saved. Call upon him
[2:10:26] and you shall be delivered.
[2:10:30] Give him glory, all ye people, for this
[2:10:34] lamb has never known a defeat. He's not
[2:10:37] a defeated Christ. He's a victorious,
[2:10:40] conquering son of the living God.
[2:10:44] Oh, we bless your name.
[2:10:47] We exalt you, victorious Christ, lovely
[2:10:52] Lord Jesus. We exalt you. We praise your
[2:10:57] name. We praise your name.
[2:11:00] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:11:04] Hallelujah.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:08] And because we love you, Lord,
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; we shall go on from here to serve you
[2:11:14] even with greater fervor.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Anoint, oh God.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Anoint, oh God, these that you have
[2:11:22] recently called, anoint them for
[2:11:24] service. Father,
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, our brother Tony and brother
[2:11:30] Steven Keer will be leaving tomorrow
[2:11:31] morning, oh God, for some weeks in
[2:11:35] Brazil. I pray you'll be with them. And
[2:11:38] may this Steven, oh God, be another
[2:11:40] Steven.
[2:11:45] May someone see his life. May someone,
[2:11:48] oh God, some young person perhaps in
[2:11:50] Brazil, catch fire for the fire that
[2:11:54] you've ignited in his soul. We want to
[2:11:56] give you glory. I pray you'll give
[2:11:58] brother Tony words. Oh God, give him
[2:12:00] wisdom, Father, that comes not from man,
[2:12:04] but comes from the throne of God. Let
[2:12:07] the very thoughts of God, the very words
[2:12:09] of God be found in his mouth, oh God.
[2:12:12] And we're not depending on any human
[2:12:14] ability. We depend solely upon
[2:12:19] the Holy Spirit.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Anoint them, we pray in Jesus Christ's
[2:12:25] name. Be with brother Murphy, Lord.
[2:12:29] be with brother Murphy. Oh God, sounded
[2:12:32] weary on the phone yesterday. Renew his
[2:12:35] strength, oh God. I pray that you'll
[2:12:38] energize him. Give him protection of the
[2:12:41] Holy Spirit. He too is another Steven.
[2:12:45] Oh, we bless your name for the word
[2:12:46] that's going out, oh God, from around
[2:12:49] the world. I pray that you'll bless our
[2:12:51] brother Ron Barwick tonight, oh God.
[2:12:54] You'll give him words just suited to
[2:12:56] this congregation.
[2:12:58] [Music]
[2:12:58] [Applause]
[2:12:59] Bless your name.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:04] [Music]
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; We'll serve him.
[2:13:12] Serve him. I'll serve him.
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:23] Making a declaration now. I'll serve
[2:13:26] him.
[2:13:27] I'll serve him. I'll serve him. Oh,
[2:13:32] we'll serve him.
[2:13:34] [Music]
[2:13:40] And we love you now. I love you.
[2:13:47] I love you.
[2:13:50] Love you.
[2:14:01] We love you.
[2:14:03] We love you all. We love you.
[2:14:08] Oh, we love you, Jesus.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Without the influence, we love him. I
[2:14:20] love him.
[2:14:24] I love him.
[2:14:29] Love
[2:14:34] that was made.
[2:14:39] Love him.
[2:14:43] I love him.
[2:14:49] I love
[2:14:51] the lamb
[2:14:54] that was slain. Everyone now, will you
[2:14:58] sing it please? I love him.
[2:15:03] Oh, I love him.
[2:15:07] Love him.
[2:15:15] Let us go.
[2:15:19] I love you.
[2:15:23] I love you.
[2:15:31] The lamb
[2:15:34] that was saved.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; You know the book of Revelation is our
[2:15:40] book.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:43] And when you speak about the lamb,
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; the lamb of God,
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; it's probably 10 times more in the book
[2:15:52] of Revelation than any other in the
[2:15:54] Bible because that's how he's expressed
[2:15:57] to us. Amen. God bless you.
[2:16:01] [Music]
[2:16:03] Is your feet on the word?
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; I want to sing before we dismissed. God
[2:16:09] is in his people once again. Hallelujah.

[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; We're not going to look any longer
[2:18:15] through this glass of self darkly.
[2:18:19] Hallelujah. But God is in his people
[2:18:22] once again.
[2:18:24] That's what he said.
[2:18:27] Because he said it, I have a right,
[2:18:29] brother Ernie, to say it. Amen.
[2:18:32] Hallelujah.
[2:18:34] You're not ashamed to say it, are you?
[2:18:36] God is in me.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:43] Amen. Why don't you turn around and
[2:18:45] shake hands with somebody that got God
[2:18:47] in them?
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Well, once again, God bless you,
[2:18:53] brother.
[2:18:54] [Music]
