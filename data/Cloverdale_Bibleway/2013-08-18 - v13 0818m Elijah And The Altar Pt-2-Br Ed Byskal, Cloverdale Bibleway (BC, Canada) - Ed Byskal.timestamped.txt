[0:02] [Music]
[0:40] From this time on
[0:43] that,
[0:45] [Music]
[0:47] oh my hope
[0:51] is in the Lord
[0:55] forever
[0:57] more.
[0:59] Hallelujah.
[1:01] Amen. God bless you all. Amen. I felt
[1:04] just to start maybe the service a little
[1:05] differently. Maybe we could just stand.
[1:07] I want to sing that chorus. I love him.
[1:10] I love him. I'm going to ask if our
[1:12] brother Tim Do would just come open the
[1:14] service in a word of prayer for us. Just
[1:16] praying in the study before the service,
[1:17] our brother Kyle prayed for us. He start
[1:19] out, "Lord Jesus, we love you." And I
[1:20] thought, "Yes, Lord. Maybe we could just
[1:22] sing that to him." The prophet loved
[1:24] this song. I thought it was so fitting.
[1:26] Almost every one of the seals messages,
[1:28] he ends the service with this song. I
[1:29] love him. I love him because he first
[1:32] loved me. Amen. So, why don't we just
[1:34] sing it as our brother Tim would come
[1:35] and just ask the Lord's blessing on the
[1:36] service this morning. Amen.
[1:39] Oh, and I
[1:43] love him.
[1:46] [Music]
[1:48] Oh, I
[1:51] love him.
[1:55] Be
[1:59] he
[2:01] first
[2:02] love
[2:04] me.
[2:09] Oh, and
[2:15] just my
[2:18] son.
[2:22] [Music]
[2:25] on
[2:27] Calary
[2:29] [Music]
[2:32] Calvary
[2:34] tree.
[2:36] Amen. Once more I love him. Oh, how I
[2:44] love him.
[2:48] Oh, I
[2:52] love him
[2:56] because
[2:58] he
[3:00] first
[3:02] loved
[3:04] me.
[3:08] [Music]
[3:10] When
[3:11] he purchases
[3:15] my
[3:17] salation,
[3:24] oh
[3:26] cal
[3:27] [Music]
[3:33] tree.
[3:36] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Tim, would you
[3:38] come, please? Thank you.
[3:44] [Music]
[3:46] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[3:47] prayer.
[3:50] Heavenly Father,
[3:53] our hearts ring out in love towards you.
[3:56] We love you because you first loved us.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; Your love was expressed to us. It found
[4:03] us in the different walks of life that
[4:05] we were in the muck and the mire of the
[4:07] clay. And Lord, you picked us up with
[4:09] your mighty hand. You redeemed us by
[4:12] your grace. You brought us to sit in
[4:14] heavenly places in Jesus Christ. Lord,
[4:17] truly, as the psalmist wrote, we will
[4:19] enter your gates with thanksgiving.
[4:22] We will come into your courts with
[4:24] praise. This is the day that you have
[4:26] made. We will be glad. We will rejoice
[4:29] in it. Lord, we come, oh God, to praise
[4:32] your name. We come to magnify you. We
[4:35] come to exalt you. This is the highlight
[4:37] of our lives that we could gather with
[4:39] saints of like precious faith. No matter
[4:41] what the week has had for us, no matter
[4:43] what has unfolded in our lives, Lord, we
[4:46] come into your presence and we shut
[4:48] everything else out. We are so happy to
[4:50] be in the presence of our father. We are
[4:52] so thrilled, oh God, to worship you and
[4:54] to adore you. And we want your presence
[4:57] to be here this morning in a mighty way.
[5:00] Oh God, we want you to anoint the songs.
[5:03] We want you to anoint the music. We want
[5:06] you to anoint every aspect of the
[5:08] service, especially as your servant
[5:10] comes behind the sacred desk. Father,
[5:12] may you move into the vessel once more.
[5:14] Get the man part out of the way. And
[5:17] Lord, use the gift once more for the
[5:19] benefit of the bride of Jesus Christ
[5:21] this morning, Lord. how we so appreciate
[5:24] your love gifts, Father. And Lord, we
[5:27] feed on them, everyone. You know the
[5:29] needs that are in our midst. May you
[5:31] touch the needs, Lord. May you, as
[5:34] you're in our midst, may you come by
[5:37] each and every way, Father. Each and
[5:39] every one, Lord, is important to you.
[5:43] And Lord, may you touch lives,
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Lord. May you lift up, may you raise up
[5:48] burdens, Lord.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; May sicknesses be healed this morning.
[5:53] Lord, the word does deliver.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; Great is your word that you send out, oh
[5:58] God. And we ask, Father, that you would
[6:00] bless each and every need that may those
[6:03] that came in needy go out whole.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; We ask it for your glory and honor in
[6:09] Jesus Christ's name.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; Bless your name.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; And why don't you greet one another as
[6:17] you have your seats? trust you'll
[6:20] forgive me from straying from the normal
[6:21] order, but I felt that it would be good
[6:23] for us this morning just to tell the
[6:25] Lord we love him the beginning of the
[6:26] service. Amen.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother John. Thank
[6:30] you. Amen. How great thou art, Sister
[6:33] Leno.
[6:38] Oh Lord my God,
[6:42] [Music]
[6:43] when I in awome wonder
[6:49] consider
[6:50] all
[6:53] the world thy hands have made.
[6:59] Oh, I see the stars
[7:04] and I hear the noise
[7:08] under

[17:13] I'm just going to ask if the brothers
[17:14] would come to take the offering at this
[17:16] time. We're just going to carry on in
[17:17] this atmosphere of worship even through
[17:19] the giving. Amen. We do just have two
[17:21] prayer requests. Maybe as the brothers
[17:24] would come, I would just ask our brother
[17:25] Glenn if he would ask the offering on
[17:26] the the blessing on the offering and on
[17:28] these prayer requests.
[17:31] Brother Milo was just asking that we
[17:32] would please remember our brother Roman
[17:34] and sister Sonia in Slovenia. They are
[17:36] translating the message into Slovenian.
[17:39] They're now working on the sixth seal
[17:40] and they're asking for guidance and
[17:41] wisdom for the translation and also for
[17:43] a job for brother Roman. And please
[17:46] continue to remember brother Rock also
[17:47] who is trying to establish himself in a
[17:49] small group in Slovenia. Amen. Let's
[17:51] just head back. God's blessing on the
[17:53] bride around the world. Amen.
[17:56] Also a request from the Revas family.
[17:58] Please pray for our neighbor Jerry
[17:59] Layman. He went in for surgery to clear
[18:01] a blocked artery in his neck and
[18:02] suffered heart failure. Just asking for
[18:04] a full recovery and return to strength.
[18:06] Amen. And may the Lord use this
[18:08] situation. Brother Glenn, would you just
[18:09] ask the Lord to bless the offering this
[18:11] morning? If there's a need on your heart
[18:12] that you just like to lift before the
[18:13] Lord this morning. Amen. We serve a
[18:16] great God. He still does miracles. Amen.
[18:19] Thank you, brother Glenn.
[18:22] Let's
[18:25] bow our heads and our hearts.
[18:28] Precious heavenly father, we
[18:32] thank you for the opportunity to be
[18:33] here, Lord, and to just bask in your
[18:36] presence, oh God. Just sensing your
[18:38] presence here from the outset, Lord, and
[18:41] as a brother Ryan said, we serve a great
[18:43] God.
[18:46] There's no God like you, Lord. And we're
[18:48] thankful for that, Lord, that we serve
[18:50] the only and living God, the one that
[18:53] manifests himself amongst his people,
[18:54] Lord. And we thank you for that, Lord
[18:57] Jesus. We just pray now for these needs,
[19:00] Lord, not remembering them all. The one
[19:01] with the artery, the uh sickness, Lord.
[19:04] We just pray that you touch him, Lord.
[19:06] And Lord, that he would realize that it
[19:09] was the God of heaven that touched him
[19:12] &gt;&gt; and he give give you glory, Lord Jesus.
[19:14] And
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, for the service this morning,
[19:17] Lord, we just want to
[19:20] rest in you, Lord, but at the same time,
[19:22] pull on the word, Lord, as our pastor
[19:24] would come. We just pray that you'd get
[19:26] the man out of the way, Lord, and that
[19:27] he would speak your word, Lord, from
[19:30] your throne, Lord, to our hearts this
[19:32] morning, Lord, that our hearts would be
[19:33] changed. And also, Lord, for the the
[19:36] giving, the people will be giving of
[19:38] their substance. Oh God, we just pray
[19:40] you take this, multiply it for your
[19:43] kingdom, oh God, that this would be used
[19:46] for your glory and your honor. We pray.
[19:48] We just commit our lives now into your
[19:50] hands, oh God, for your glory and your
[19:52] honor in Jesus name. Amen.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[20:00] Amen. Heavenly Father, I appreciate you.
[20:03] Just as the offer is being taken, Sister
[20:04] Elena.

[20:10] I appreciate
[20:13] you.
[20:16] Oh my heavenly father,
[20:20] I appreciate
[20:23] you,
[20:26] Lord. I love you. I adore you.
[20:32] I bow out
[20:34] before you. Heavenly Father,
[20:38] I appreciate
[20:42] you. Holy Spirit, you're a comforter.
[20:45] Oh, Holy Spirit,

[20:59] to me.

[21:11] inside me. Holy Spirit, you're a
[21:16] comfort.
[21:17] And we sing that verse again. Holy

[22:52] didn't have a midweek service. Felt like

[22:57] morning. Amen. And I trust you've put
[22:59] your order in. Our pastor's going to
[23:00] come and speak to us. Amen. We do have a

[23:05] the Lynon outreach in Tlea Reservation.

[30:09] for you're the great God. I am.
[30:16] You are the ris
[30:21] Lord. You are my comforter
[30:25] [Music]
[30:27] and my king.
[30:30] Lord I live.
[30:34] I live your
[30:38] name.
[30:39] I lift your holy
[30:43] name
[30:45] for Jehovah.
[30:49] I

[31:03] You are

[31:12] [Music]
[31:16] king.
[31:38] [Music]
[31:47] The father has a plan,
[31:51] though it's hard to see it now.
[31:56] You feel you're walking all alone. But
[32:00] he is there, no doubt.
[32:04] When the storm around you rages
[32:08] and you're tossed to and fro,
[32:12] when you're faced with life's decisions,
[32:16] not sure which way to go, stand still
[32:24] and let God move.
[32:28] Standing still
[32:32] is hard to do.
[32:37] When you feel you have reached the end,
[32:42] he'll make a way for you. Stand still
[32:49] and let God move.
[32:52] [Music]
[32:54] When the enemy surrounds you and the
[32:59] walls are closing in.
[33:03] When the tide is swiftly rising
[33:07] and you wonder where he's been,
[33:11] friend, there never was a moment
[33:15] when his arms weren't reaching out.
[33:20] You can rest assured and be secure. God
[33:24] is moving right now. Stand still
[33:31] and let God move.
[33:36] Standing still
[33:40] is hard to do.
[33:45] When you feel you have reached the end,
[33:49] he'll make a way for you. Stand still
[33:56] and let God move.
[34:00] [Music]
[34:18] When you feel you have reached the end,
[34:22] he'll make a way for you. Stand still
[34:30] and let God move.
[34:35] Stand still
[34:39] and let God move.
[34:43] Standing still
[34:47] is hard to do.
[34:52] When you feel you have reached the end,
[34:56] he'll make a way for you. Stand still
[35:04] and let God move.
[35:09] The answer will come,
[35:14] but only in his time.
[35:20] Stand still
[35:24] and let God move.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Stand still
[35:33] and let God move.
[35:37] [Music]
[35:49] [Applause]
[35:55] Hallelujah.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; What a good uh what a good in
[35:59] encouragement or instruction. Stand
[36:01] still.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I'm going to be
[36:05] standing here for a little while, but I
[36:06] won't be standing still. Exactly. But I
[36:09] am going to be standing still waiting
[36:12] for God to do what he wants to do.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's uh it's just a marvelous
[36:19] thing to stand back and watch God do
[36:22] things, isn't it?
[36:24] &gt;&gt; It's been wonderful. Uh a lot of times
[36:27] we are the beneficiaries of of something
[36:29] that God has done and we don't even know
[36:32] it. So, part of my task up here is to
[36:36] let you know about some things that God
[36:38] does. God heals Sister Natasha, who you
[36:40] just heard singing.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; The sitter in the middle, she wasn't
[36:44] hasn't been able to sing for uh perhaps
[36:47] a month or more. And her voice was just
[36:50] in s cough and situation.
[36:54] And uh God healed her.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; God healed her. And I I didn't even
[36:58] really know what I was saying. I just
[37:00] shook hands with her and said, "When are
[37:02] you going to sing
[37:04] the other day and she sang at the camp
[37:06] and how thankful we are for that." Uh,
[37:09] and there's been an awful lot going on.
[37:11] I I think the uh uh the Lynen Fair has
[37:16] been on and and many of the congregation
[37:20] have been in attendance there to uh
[37:24] witness and that's been wonderful. We're
[37:27] happy about that. Brother Matthew Redell
[37:29] takes responsibility of organizing that
[37:32] and seeing that there's uh message books
[37:35] and other material that's available and
[37:37] we're really really thankful for that
[37:40] opportunity.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; I said amen.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; That's good. Hey, we have we have souls
[37:49] that are worth 10,000 worlds. And we
[37:52] have uh uh Sister Sammy and brother
[37:54] Jason Kane. And they came as a result of
[37:58] last year's, wasn't it? Last year's
[38:00] sister or two years ago, was it two
[38:03] years ago? My time flies real quickly.
[38:06] Sister Sammy, why don't you stand up? Is
[38:08] Brother Jason there? All right, brother
[38:10] Jason. Here's two here as a result of
[38:13] the Lynen Fair two years ago.
[38:19] Hallelujah.
[38:21] Not members of the church, members of
[38:23] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; They heard a sound.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Then also uh there was a door opened to
[38:35] the uh a meeting taking place on the
[38:37] reservation at uh to to Tulip and
[38:40] Washington. and I think uh brother
[38:44] Roberto and uh sister Rosemary Valencia
[38:48] through their uh connection there they
[38:52] uh we found out about it and uh was
[38:55] given a invitation and I don't know how
[38:57] it all took place and brother Matthew
[39:00] Redell
[39:01] uh uh made arrangements etc and a number
[39:04] of group of people went down they were
[39:07] having a meeting there and brother
[39:09] Kenandes uh spoke some words brother Ken
[39:11] I'm going to ask you to come up in a
[39:13] moment and just give us a little summary
[39:15] and and uh how how you felt about it. Uh
[39:19] but before brother Ken comes, we also
[39:22] want to say that brother Ken and sister
[39:25] Linda Ordeal were able to go down and uh
[39:28] be with the Cobb family. Sister Cobb
[39:31] senior passed away and her funeral I
[39:34] believe was day before yesterday, wasn't
[39:36] it? And uh so
[39:39] uh they were able to give greetings. We
[39:42] we held them on our heart. And I
[39:45] mentioned also that she had passed away
[39:48] during camp. And uh brother Jeff and
[39:51] sister Debbie, sister Debbie's uh
[39:54] daughter of the Cobb family. So brother
[39:56] Jeff and Sister Debbie Jenkins from
[39:59] Limo, Ohio. They were there, of course,
[40:02] and many other family members and
[40:04] friends, and they were able to uh be
[40:08] with them and to have some fellowship
[40:10] with them. We're happy you were able to
[40:12] go, brother Ken. And Linda, God bless
[40:15] you. Uh
[40:18] we have greetings also from Brother
[40:20] Craig Boore, who was the speaker at the
[40:23] camp. And brother Craig felt that they
[40:27] were some of his best meetings that he's
[40:29] been in. Uh that's what brother John
[40:32] Andy's was saying that he made some
[40:34] comment about it I guess when he got
[40:36] home. But he sent me a text yesterday
[40:38] and wanted to be remembered to the
[40:40] church. So we just say God bless brother
[40:42] Craig. I can tell you he he gave it all
[40:44] he had and he allowed God to use him as
[40:48] a as a vessel and we're we want to be
[40:51] ready to hear that whatever whatever God
[40:54] has for us. Uh, brother Andy's, why
[40:56] don't you just come and give us a a
[40:59] brief of of the uh, what's taking place?
[41:03] I mean, things are taking place at Lynen
[41:05] Fair.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; You know, we don't know much about
[41:09] what's happening daytoday, what happened
[41:10] up at Talop, but I'm interested.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Ken, glad you were there and
[41:16] able to share something to them. God
[41:19] bless you.
[41:25] Well, as uh brother Ed has said, brother
[41:28] Roberto is was the contact to be able to
[41:31] put this together. And uh he had gotten
[41:35] permission and the pastor had allowed us
[41:38] to maybe have some specials,
[41:40] testimonies, and I was to speak 30
[41:43] minutes. And the main speaker was going
[41:45] to be a pastor and Indian brother from
[41:48] Montana because they're coming together
[41:51] on a on a group uh fellowship from
[41:54] different uh reservations.
[41:56] Well, he couldn't come. There was some
[41:58] activity in Montana and he couldn't
[42:00] come. So, it was thought possibly uh
[42:02] speaking would be extended to maybe an
[42:05] hour or so.
[42:07] And the pastor was supposed to be there
[42:09] at 5 when they were going to eat. and we
[42:13] had eaten earlier. We were going to meet
[42:14] him at 6. Well, he showed up almost at 7
[42:18] when the service began. So, when we met
[42:20] him, uh he said that he said that I
[42:24] could bring a a short testimony uh maybe
[42:27] 10 minutes and he was going to preach.
[42:29] So, uh brother Roberto said to me, he
[42:31] said, "Boy, that changed fast."
[42:34] But God has a plan and he was putting it
[42:36] all together. So as we approached and we
[42:40] had u uh
[42:43] had a special uh singing I believe the
[42:47] uh parises uh sang
[42:50] &gt;&gt; the St. John's and um and then brother
[42:55] and then I gave a very short testimony
[42:58] and then brother Matthew uh he spoke on
[43:03] uh it was it truth he read a verse spoke
[43:08] a little bit on truth for maybe about 10
[43:10] minutes and then he sat down well at
[43:13] this point we didn't have any permission
[43:15] to do anything further although we
[43:17] thought we did and so brother Matthew
[43:21] He uh during the service as the pastor
[43:24] was preaching and getting near the end,
[43:26] Pastor Ron, uh, Brother Matthew
[43:30] uh went over to Brother Roberto and
[43:32] says, "Now, do we have permission to put
[43:33] our literature out?" And he says, "Well,
[43:36] no, not that I know of." So, Brother
[43:38] Matthew, he put the table up. Uh, he put
[43:41] the the literature out. And when he was
[43:43] standing giving his short testimony, he
[43:45] said, "We have some gifts for you.
[43:48] gifts for you when you leave and of
[43:51] course the material was the gifts
[43:55] &gt;&gt; and that was there. Now that what was
[43:57] surprising God putting it all together
[43:59] the pastor when he got up and he was
[44:02] speaking and preaching and and moving
[44:04] around and most of them had Indian uh
[44:07] heritages in their background.
[44:10] He said that God had revealed to his
[44:12] wife two two years ago by a dream that
[44:16] there was going to come three tornadoes
[44:19] out of the north and the pastor kept
[44:22] speaking of uh Canada and he thought we
[44:26] were all from Canada which I didn't say
[44:29] anything different
[44:31] and so he was looking upon us to bring
[44:35] something out of it was going to be a
[44:38] blessing it was going to be a power of
[44:39] God he said and it was truth going to
[44:42] come out of Canada and come down for
[44:44] them.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; So the God even two years ago was
[44:49] working in the hearts to even have that
[44:51] said then. And then the people come up
[44:54] and they got the material and some said,
[44:56] "Oh, brother Brandham. Oh yes, I just
[44:59] love him." You know the opposite that
[45:01] you get sometimes. So God was moving on
[45:04] their hearts although they sang songs
[45:06] that we sing but their temple was quite
[45:09] different.
[45:10] and their doctrine and teachings and
[45:12] dress manner and everything was really
[45:14] the opposite of what we are. But it just
[45:17] takes the word of God
[45:20] &gt;&gt; and the seed to go to the elect and we
[45:22] don't know who they are, who she or he
[45:25] is. And then God will quicken that
[45:27] &gt;&gt; and that's what we're going for. Not to
[45:30] convert the whole church and re and
[45:32] reservations,
[45:33] but for one soul
[45:36] &gt;&gt; and that's God's business. And once that
[45:38] revelation strikes,
[45:41] no one could shut them up. Nobody could
[45:43] change them. This message is what they
[45:46] want.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you. And we plan to go again.
[45:49] The pastor said he wants me to come down
[45:51] and speak uh maybe in September. So,
[45:54] we'll just see what God does.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:06] Well, listen. Uh we're going to stand in
[46:10] a moment and read the scripture, but
[46:11] just before I do,
[46:13] uh how many have seen this book, Uganda
[46:17] 2013?
[46:20] How many have this book?
[46:24] A lot less.
[46:26] Well, I'll tell you what. Uh one was
[46:29] given to me. And so I looked through it
[46:32] and I I just thought, "This is fabulous.
[46:36] This is incredible. Who put this book
[46:38] out? Well, Sister Beth Dingwall uh took
[46:41] the responsibility who to put it
[46:44] together and it is there'sund and I just
[46:48] counted them. There's a 191 pictures
[46:53] with notes of the of the work that the
[46:57] 16 did. 12 of the students plus the
[47:01] others that went with them went to
[47:03] Uganda.
[47:05] uh adding a ceiling to a church, doing
[47:08] work on a church, sisters teaching
[47:11] others to sew, and they took five of the
[47:15] best sewing machines that you could
[47:17] find. Uh the the hub and and uh
[47:22] computers were taken and the hub was set
[47:25] up and training sessions were set up
[47:28] with the with the ministers. Then they
[47:30] were asked to go to a school and brother
[47:34] Tim was to speak there and uh they
[47:38] didn't know how many students there's
[47:39] 600 students there. Then brother Kim
[47:43] Dingwald found there's about 250 of
[47:46] those 600 that are orphans and have no
[47:50] one to support them. And this brother
[47:53] just has a burden to give them an
[47:55] education. And so, Brother Kim uh stood
[47:59] here and made uh we sent a letter out
[48:01] actually with a faith challenge report
[48:03] saying that if anyone wish to support a
[48:06] child, I think it's $30 a month. And
[48:09] that's not very much to give a child
[48:12] education and and care for them. And
[48:14] that turned out to I think there was
[48:16] about 30 that replied, but if you don't
[48:19] have this book,
[48:21] uh we're not selling anything, but it's
[48:23] not free. If you'd like one, I think
[48:27] that you could arrange to get one maybe
[48:29] from the office through the office. I
[48:31] have about 15, which I got. You can't
[48:34] have them.
[48:36] I just got those. You'll have to order
[48:38] your own. And anyone who wants one, I
[48:41] would suggest you put your name in
[48:43] quickly and find out how much they are.
[48:45] I don't know. Anything over the price of
[48:47] just getting them printed, uh, we'll
[48:50] will go to the school. uh the school can
[48:52] use uh brother Terry, is that all right?
[48:55] Uh so he he's he's agreeing. All right.
[48:58] Uh because we want to help our own
[49:00] school as well. But that's I'm not
[49:02] making a plug for our school. However,
[49:04] I'm a great supporter of the school.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; I believe to get our young people and
[49:09] children taught by those kind of
[49:11] students that we have and teachers that
[49:13] we have and staff that we have. I say
[49:16] God bless BCA.
[49:19] people can think whatever they want to
[49:20] think of that. I'm just glad I don't
[49:23] have to go to school anymore from the
[49:25] schools that I see around the country.
[49:28] And and then uh and and then there was a
[49:32] work done towards a radio broadcast
[49:35] in a tribal language and that is going
[49:38] to be happening very very soon. We've
[49:41] been getting all the information. So, if
[49:43] you don't want if if you'd like to have
[49:45] one of these,
[49:47] you call the office or see Sister Beth
[49:50] Dingwall or however she'll be the one
[49:52] who has to order them. And uh and I'm
[49:55] just enthused about what God is doing.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; And you know what, friends? I I'm I'm
[50:02] passionate about God's work.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; I'm enthused about God's work. And I
[50:07] don't care who does it or how it happens
[50:10] or who's at Tulip Tulip Tulip or who's
[50:15] speaking or who's witnessing or who's
[50:18] down at Lynen or uh for seven or eight
[50:21] years we were at the at the fair in uh
[50:24] in Vancouver the P& it was just great.
[50:30] uh in fact is my wife and I were on an
[50:32] airplane flying overseas and they
[50:35] decided to show a movie and we didn't
[50:37] have any headsets of course but uh the
[50:40] thing came on the screen you know and
[50:42] and here the movie was shot in Vancouver
[50:45] and uh part of it was uh they were doing
[50:48] at the pe fair fairgrounds and and and
[50:52] here they they they spanned our booth
[50:56] that truly Elijah shall first come. And
[51:00] I was sitting on an airplane, but I had
[51:01] to say amen.
[51:04] That sounds fine to me. And and God, I
[51:07] guess, just put them there for that
[51:09] reason. But we had we had souls out of
[51:11] that. And one soul's worth how much?
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; 10. And more.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Eternal life. Aren't you glad you're
[51:23] saved? Let's let's stand and let's just
[51:26] sing.
[51:28] Uh I'm a new creation. Is that what I
[51:30] said? Oh yeah. There's been a change in
[51:33] me. That's about the same thing
[51:35] [Music]
[51:38] in me.
[51:40] Since Jesus set me free.
[51:44] I've been to Calary.
[51:48] I'm born again.
[51:53] I shall not turn around.

[52:05] Oh,
[52:07] once more. Let everyone sing there's
[52:10] been a change in me.

[53:01] Born again. I cannot
[53:04] cannot turn around. My feet are on solid
[53:09] ground.

[53:15] Oh, what a change.
[53:19] With our heads bowed, heavenly father,
[53:22] how we thank you. There has indeed been
[53:24] a change, a transformation,
[53:28] transforming power by the power of the
[53:31] spoken word of God. We thank you that we
[53:34] have a thus sayith the Lord. And father,
[53:37] it has had such an effect. And we thank
[53:39] you for it. And we pray this morning
[53:41] that the Holy Spirit will come and
[53:45] just deliver the word to every single
[53:48] heart that is ready to receive. And I
[53:51] pray, Father, there'll be a moving of
[53:54] your Holy Spirit. May people hear your
[53:57] voice, not a man's voice. We're not here
[54:01] for that. We're not here for religion.
[54:03] We're not here for churchity. We're
[54:05] here, oh God, not just to attend a
[54:08] service, but may we receive something of
[54:10] eternal value.

[54:15] for his glory alone. Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll invite you to turn in your

[54:23] chapter.
[54:29] And I'll ask you to be very attentive
[54:32] if you would please. as little movement
[54:35] as possible because I'll need your

[54:40] to follow
[54:43] uh
[54:45] the thoughts today because uh even in my
[54:48] own studies over the last probably three
[54:51] or more weeks on this subject. It's been
[54:54] a very uh
[54:57] very wonderful time. I want to start
[55:00] reading at verse one.
[55:03] Chapter 10, Hebrews verse one. For the
[55:06] law having a shadow of good things to
[55:09] come, and not the very image of the
[55:13] things, can never with those sacrifices
[55:17] which they offered year by year
[55:19] continually make the comers there unto
[55:22] perfect. For then would they not have
[55:25] ceased to be offered, because that the
[55:28] worshippers once purged should have had
[55:31] no more conscience of sins. But in those
[55:35] sacrifices, there is a remembrance again
[55:38] made of sins every year. For it is not
[55:42] possible that the blood of bulls and
[55:44] goats should take away sins. Wherefore,
[55:48] when he cometh into the world, he saith,
[55:52] Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not,
[55:55] but a body hast thou prepared me. In
[55:58] burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin,
[56:01] thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I,
[56:05] Lo, I come in the volume of the book, it
[56:08] is written of me to do thy will, oh God.
[56:11] Above then, above when he said,
[56:13] "Sacrifice and offering, and burnt
[56:16] offerings, and offerings for sin, thou
[56:18] wilt not, neither hath pleasure therein,
[56:21] which are offered by the law." Then said
[56:24] he, "Lo, I come to do thy will, oh God."
[56:27] He taketh away the first, that he may
[56:30] establish the second. By the which will
[56:34] we are sanctified through the offering
[56:36] of the body of Jesus Christ once for
[56:39] all.
[56:41] And every priest standeth daily
[56:43] ministering and offering often of times
[56:46] uh the same sacrifices which can never
[56:49] take away sin. But this man after he had
[56:52] offered one sacrifice for the sins
[56:55] forever sat down on the right hand of
[56:58] God from henceforth expecting till his
[57:02] enemies be made his foottool. For by one
[57:05] offering he hath perfected forever them
[57:09] that are sanctified.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And may God bless his word as you
[57:14] have your saints.
[57:18] For those that attend the service
[57:20] regularly, you will remember the last
[57:23] time uh that I ministered, I spoke on
[57:26] Elijah and the altar.
[57:29] And uh I want to speak on Elijah and the
[57:33] sacrifice.
[57:35] So this is part two of Elijah and the
[57:37] altar.
[57:39] Uh I read how Elijah was confronted by
[57:44] the 400
[57:46] prophets of Baal
[57:48] and uh
[57:51] he had an altar. They had an altar. Uh
[57:54] but he rebuilt the altar.
[57:56] He rebuilt the altar.
[57:59] And I I did not just draw a like a p a
[58:04] mental picture, but in fact went into
[58:08] scripture to show very clearly and
[58:11] distinctly that the altar actually is
[58:14] your heart. And your heart is not just
[58:17] your muscle that's pumping blood. Your
[58:20] heart is that inner man, that inner
[58:22] person, that seat of emotion, that seat
[58:26] of uh the inner person in all of your uh
[58:30] which is even more than the mind. It's
[58:32] not the mind, but it's that the real
[58:35] you.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Down inside
[58:38] &gt;&gt; and that it took Elijah. It took the
[58:42] word of God
[58:44] &gt;&gt; by a vindicated prophet
[58:46] &gt;&gt; to rebuild that altar and put the heart
[58:49] in position.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Now an all an altar has a purpose and
[58:54] the altars are built for the purpose of
[58:57] sacrifice.
[58:58] And so in speaking of sacrifice now uh I
[59:03] want to say very quickly that the
[59:05] sacrifices of the entire Old Testament
[59:08] are rather difficult to relate to our
[59:12] life. But I want to tie it together
[59:15] where you will see it does relate very
[59:17] very uh conclusively
[59:21] to our present life. And I will say this
[59:24] just so you get a a good start that your
[59:28] heart is the altar. Without saying a
[59:32] whole lot of different words, but your
[59:34] heart is the altar. The altar can only
[59:38] be arranged and set in in the right
[59:41] place as Elijah was called. He's a
[59:44] restoring prophet. And Elijah, the
[59:47] spirit of Elijah bringing forth the word
[59:50] of God was to turn the hearts of the
[59:54] people.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; And even Elijah said, "And let the Lord
[59:58] let the people know that the Lord God
[1:00:01] has heard.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Let fire come down and consume this
[1:00:05] sacrifice and let the people know that I
[1:00:08] have done all things according to your
[1:00:11] word." And their their hearts have been
[1:00:14] turned back. Amen.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; There was a rearrangement
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; of their heart
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; of their of their whole direction and
[1:00:24] their thought and their conviction and
[1:00:26] everything because up to this time Baal
[1:00:28] had become very prominent. But fire came
[1:00:31] down and consumed the sacrifice and the
[1:00:34] and the water that he had poured on it
[1:00:36] and all of those things. But now I have
[1:00:39] some very very unique things to say
[1:00:42] about the altar and about the sacrifice.
[1:00:45] We've dealt with the altar. Now we want
[1:00:47] to deal with the sacrifice. Altars are
[1:00:51] for the purpose of sacrifice.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; So your heart
[1:00:57] your heart arranged by the word of God.
[1:01:02] God so God made you.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; God sent you here. You're not here just
[1:01:07] to wander around aimlessly like a bunch
[1:01:10] of ants on an antill. We have a purpose.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; God has a purpose in you being birthed
[1:01:16] here.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Now, some may not feel any purpose and
[1:01:20] maybe there is no purpose in their life.
[1:01:22] They live and die. We we we're not here.
[1:01:24] We as believers are not here just like
[1:01:26] animals. We've come and live and breathe
[1:01:28] and eat and so on so forth and die and
[1:01:31] and turn back to the soil. That's not
[1:01:33] our purpose here. God who created all
[1:01:37] things had a divine purpose and that
[1:01:40] purpose is not going to be made known to
[1:01:42] us by some institution
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; or by some you know theological seminary
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; or by some learned man or men or
[1:01:53] government or whatever more we can't
[1:01:55] entrust our soul to that you might say
[1:01:58] you that are visiting here might say
[1:02:00] well what am I doing I'm only going to
[1:02:02] echo what God has already confirmed with
[1:02:06] a supernatural vindication.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Lots of people have, you know, they have
[1:02:12] their leaders and their apostles and
[1:02:14] their prophets and their whatever more.
[1:02:17] I just want one to step forward that had
[1:02:19] the vindication of brother Brandham
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; for thousands of times times thousands
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; publicly not in not in a corner
[1:02:30] publicly.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; No leader has done it. No pope has done
[1:02:35] it. No cardinal has done it. No bishop
[1:02:37] has done it. No overseer has done it. No
[1:02:40] man has done it because it's not humanly
[1:02:43] possible. It's not man.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; It's God in a man doing it.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; And this congregation who has that
[1:02:53] conviction and knows that that's the
[1:02:55] truth and your soul hangs on that truth.
[1:02:58] You want to declare with with joy in
[1:03:00] your heart, thank God.
[1:03:04] for the day that he caught a hold of me
[1:03:07] and I'm changed forever.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; And your heart, your life has been made
[1:03:14] to be uh your heart has been made to be
[1:03:17] arranged by God himself.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And for a sacrifice.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Now the only life
[1:03:26] that was able to be the sacrifice was
[1:03:29] the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:32] And
[1:03:35] so
[1:03:37] I'm just trying to frame it just right
[1:03:40] to give you a give a give you a quick
[1:03:42] start.
[1:03:44] But the the all the sacrifices of the
[1:03:47] Old Testament, you'll have a hard time
[1:03:49] relating to them. So I didn't want to
[1:03:51] lose you with that. I'm going to name a
[1:03:53] bunch of them.
[1:03:55] and and but I have scriptures also where
[1:03:58] God says, "I'm not interested in your
[1:04:01] sacrifices.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in burnt sacrifices."
[1:04:06] And there's one phrase that we can all
[1:04:08] remember. Obedience is better than
[1:04:12] sacrifices. I've had people read the Old
[1:04:15] Testament and they said, "My, it is it
[1:04:18] is so gruesome." They were just killing
[1:04:20] and slaying and killing and slaying.
[1:04:23] That's right.
[1:04:25] But the scripture, it wasn't just that
[1:04:27] God wanted people to slay
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; animals. It was that was a obedience
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; to the word of God. That was
[1:04:36] demonstrating obedience to the word of
[1:04:38] God.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; And that's the key. And that's why he
[1:04:41] could say obedience is better than
[1:04:44] sacrifice.
[1:04:45] So with that then we will uh launch into
[1:04:49] launch into the scripture a little bit
[1:04:51] further
[1:04:53] in the message why it had to be
[1:04:55] shepherds.
[1:04:58] So we go I just go to the beginning of
[1:05:00] Eden's sacrifice at the beginning Adam
[1:05:04] and Eve standing there in the presence
[1:05:06] of God to hear his message to them. They
[1:05:10] had draped about them about their loins
[1:05:13] skin of sheep. The first message was
[1:05:16] ever heard was given uh over the top of
[1:05:20] a dead sheep skin
[1:05:24] that God had slew and wrapped Adam and
[1:05:26] Eve in after they had tried to make
[1:05:29] their own religion of fig leaves. It
[1:05:32] wouldn't work.
[1:05:34] Sheep sacrifice
[1:05:36] had been instituted for the atonement
[1:05:40] since the very beginning. He said sheep
[1:05:44] sacrifice. So that was the beginning
[1:05:47] sacrifice.
[1:05:49] And and and the word sacrifice and it's
[1:05:53] hundreds of times in the Bible.
[1:05:55] Sacrifice simply means slaughter
[1:05:58] or to kill.
[1:06:00] It is something. And when we think of
[1:06:02] sacrifice, we usually think of something
[1:06:04] that has died or expired and doesn't
[1:06:08] have its life anymore. I don't think
[1:06:10] there's anyone here. In fact, as I feel
[1:06:13] absolutely confident, no one here has
[1:06:16] slain an animal recently.
[1:06:18] And I can tell you, I've been to Israel
[1:06:20] a number of times and I've talking to
[1:06:22] Orthodox Jewish people and they also do
[1:06:26] not continue on. Even though they
[1:06:30] maintain 613
[1:06:33] regulations and laws of the Old
[1:06:35] Testament, yet the main one which was to
[1:06:38] slay an animal, a Passover lamb, they
[1:06:40] don't do. And they have some other
[1:06:44] function and they've got some other
[1:06:46] explanation. And so we have a hard time,
[1:06:50] in fact, is almost an impossible time to
[1:06:54] get our minds around the sacrifices of
[1:06:57] the Old Testament, which is the
[1:06:58] centerpiece of the Old Testament.
[1:07:02] It is a bleeding animals and the and the
[1:07:05] various there was burnt offering. Here's
[1:07:09] just a few of them. There was burnt
[1:07:11] offering. There was sin offering. There
[1:07:15] was a guilt or trespass offering. There
[1:07:18] was peace offerings. There were thank
[1:07:21] offerings.
[1:07:23] There were free will offerings. And
[1:07:25] that's key. Free will offerings. There
[1:07:28] was a wave offering. There was a heave
[1:07:31] heave offering. And they all had
[1:07:33] significance and meanings. There was
[1:07:35] fire offering. There was a drink
[1:07:37] offering.
[1:07:39] There was a incense offering. There was
[1:07:41] a frankincense offering. There was
[1:07:44] sacrifice upon sacrifice upon sacrifice
[1:07:47] and yet we say well we believe the Bible
[1:07:50] which we do and yet uh we do not do any
[1:07:53] of those. So where is the answer? Of
[1:07:56] course, the answer is that Jesus Christ
[1:08:00] is the only one when God's word, think
[1:08:05] of it now, God's word, follow it. God's
[1:08:09] word became flesh. When it became flesh,
[1:08:14] God looked on that, lo, a body hast thou
[1:08:17] prepared me? in offerings of sin and so
[1:08:21] on. Thou wst not, but a body hast thou
[1:08:25] prepared me. God looked on that body
[1:08:28] because that was the embodiment of his
[1:08:31] word. And and Christ was obedient to
[1:08:34] every word. It was obedience
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; to the word of God. And God looked upon
[1:08:40] that obedient one and said, "Thou art my
[1:08:44] beloved son."
[1:08:48] in in whom I'm well pleased.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; I'm pleased. Now, here's come one. And
[1:08:55] he became the supreme sacrifice
[1:08:59] that was the embodiment and the
[1:09:01] fulfillment of he it gave meaning to all
[1:09:05] of those. Uh he is the trespass
[1:09:08] offering. He is the sacrifice offering.
[1:09:11] He's the sin offering. He's the guilt
[1:09:13] offering to remove your guilt. Anybody
[1:09:16] here suffering with guilt remaining on
[1:09:18] their mind, he is your sacrifice.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Anybody here packing sin, here's the
[1:09:25] sacrifice.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Anyone doesn't doesn't have peace with
[1:09:29] God, here's the peace sacrifice. The
[1:09:33] full fulfillment of all of those
[1:09:36] sacrifices is found in Jesus Christ. But
[1:09:39] don't forget, it's not Jesus Christ of
[1:09:41] history merely. It's Jesus Christ who is
[1:09:44] the living word of God in every season.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; The sacrifice lies in the message.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; I'll prove that to you.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Outside of that, you say, "Well, all
[1:09:58] kinds of voices in the world." Well, I'd
[1:10:01] be very, very hesitant to hang my
[1:10:04] eternal eternal destiny
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; on some man's voice or some church's
[1:10:10] voice or something else. I'd make sure
[1:10:12] that first it was a voice that came from
[1:10:15] eternity and was supported by the
[1:10:17] supernatural,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; not some emotional supernatural or
[1:10:21] something that appears supernatural, but
[1:10:23] something that you know that man cannot
[1:10:26] know that man could not do that. That is
[1:10:29] God's knowledge. That is God's word.
[1:10:31] That is God's mouthpiece.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; And hang your soul on that. Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Someday we'll all find, if time would go
[1:10:41] on, we'll all find some common ground in
[1:10:44] a funeral parlor
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; or on a slab someplace. The rich, the
[1:10:49] poor,
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; the fat, the skinny,
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; the healthy, the sick. Doesn't make any
[1:10:55] difference. Everybody will find their
[1:10:57] place on a common piece of ground.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; You want to know you're not dead. Then
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; as the prophet said that death is just a
[1:11:07] doorway going to go from the interior to
[1:11:10] the exterior, the exterior to the
[1:11:12] interior, going to go from one realm to
[1:11:14] another realm. And as the songwriter
[1:11:17] said, what then?
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; We're not here for a Sunday school
[1:11:24] picnic.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; We're not here to just have fun and
[1:11:27] games. We're here because this is
[1:11:29] serious business.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; This is your soul. That's right.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; So all of these offerings, most of these
[1:11:39] sacrifices were not optional.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; They were required.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Salvation is not an option
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; to those who are elected and called.
[1:11:51] It's a must.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; I must go.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; I must surrender myself. And
[1:11:59] furthermore, from what Jesus said, all
[1:12:01] that the Father hath given me will come.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that they will come?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; If you're called of God, you're not
[1:12:10] going to stay where you are. You're
[1:12:12] going to come.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he said, "And no man
[1:12:16] will pluck them out of my hand." There's
[1:12:18] nobody that can connive and get you out
[1:12:21] of your hand. This isn't something you
[1:12:23] just become convinced about. It isn't
[1:12:26] something you learn. is something that's
[1:12:28] revealed to you and you can't take that
[1:12:31] revelation away.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; So it was not optional.
[1:12:38] And while we cannot relate to the
[1:12:41] multitude of sacrifices that God
[1:12:43] required in the Old Testament,
[1:12:47] because there's really nothing in our
[1:12:49] daily life that is even remotely similar
[1:12:53] to the life that God called the children
[1:12:57] of Israel to live. There's just nothing.
[1:13:00] You read through, you can read through
[1:13:02] Exodus. You can read through even in
[1:13:04] Genesis uh Noah built an altar and slew
[1:13:08] animals and Abraham offered sacrifices
[1:13:12] and all the Old Testament the patriarchs
[1:13:15] and then you come up to uh Exodus and
[1:13:19] Exodus and God calls them out of out of
[1:13:22] Egypt and I tell you what, you think
[1:13:25] there's bloodshed over in Egypt right
[1:13:27] now? There was a lot of bloodshed in in
[1:13:30] in Moses time
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; and there has to be something that
[1:13:34] answers to that.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; There has to be something in your faith
[1:13:38] that answers to that and said, "Well, I
[1:13:41] know that in whom I have believed.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; I know that the supreme sacrifice
[1:13:46] answers to that." And then we go on from
[1:13:49] there. And yet these sacrifices were of
[1:13:52] utmost importance
[1:13:55] and the centerpiece of their worship to
[1:13:57] God.
[1:13:59] They have more to do, and here's the key
[1:14:02] phrase, they have more to do with
[1:14:04] obedience
[1:14:06] than with merely slaying an animal.
[1:14:10] when you if you were just honestly
[1:14:12] reading the scripture without any
[1:14:14] religious background, you'd say, and
[1:14:16] I've had I've had people I went to
[1:14:18] school with and and uh I they started
[1:14:21] reading the Bible because they got they
[1:14:23] said, "Woo, that's gruesome."
[1:14:26] Well, just for the common mind or the
[1:14:28] natural mind, it is gruesome. He said
[1:14:31] they were just killing all kinds of
[1:14:33] animals and thousands and hundreds of
[1:14:35] them, etc., etc. And we don't want to
[1:14:37] dwell on that. But we could ask the
[1:14:39] question, why would God of eternity, why
[1:14:41] would God who created all things make
[1:14:44] such a requirement? It was obedience
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; to see the supreme test whether they
[1:14:50] would believe that he spoke that.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; And so when Israel went away from God
[1:14:57] and continued with their sacrifices,
[1:15:00] they became it the sacrifice himself
[1:15:03] itself became a stench in God's
[1:15:05] nostrils.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; See just merely a religious life,
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; God can't stand it.
[1:15:15] God can't stand just religious empty
[1:15:18] religious activity. And that's why the
[1:15:20] prophet said God hates a powerless
[1:15:22] church.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Power to transform.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Not power to reform, but power to
[1:15:27] transform.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Transform.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, my father, I won't
[1:15:34] get into his testimony, but my father,
[1:15:38] they made their own home brew.
[1:15:41] My father drank till he would
[1:15:43] unconscious.
[1:15:44] My father loved to dance. He loved the
[1:15:47] things of the world. He did the things
[1:15:49] of the world. But one day, just like
[1:15:52] something smoked him in the field while
[1:15:54] he was plowing behind the horses, and he
[1:15:57] dropped to his knees in the sod, a fresh
[1:16:00] feral, threw his arms in the air. Now
[1:16:03] I'm talking about an altar, an alter
[1:16:06] young man, an alder boy in the Catholic
[1:16:08] church.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; And he drops to his knees and says, "Oh
[1:16:12] God, if there is a God, if you ever show
[1:16:15] me how I can how I can be free from this
[1:16:18] guilt, I will receive you that very
[1:16:20] day." How come the guilt didn't go away
[1:16:22] in the church?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; How come the priest couldn't take away
[1:16:26] the guilt? How come all the incense and
[1:16:28] all the ceremony couldn't take away the
[1:16:30] guilt? because it isn't empowered to
[1:16:32] take away the guilt. This is not by
[1:16:35] ceremony. It's not merely even by having
[1:16:37] a church building or preaching. This has
[1:16:39] nothing to do with it. This just
[1:16:41] accommodate you so that you can come and
[1:16:43] have fellowship with God and to hear
[1:16:46] God's word.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; And in a house in a house just a kitchen
[1:16:54] in a home that a woman asked him to make
[1:16:57] some kitchen cabinets if he could. and
[1:17:00] he'd seen two girls on the street. They
[1:17:02] looked like angels to him. And he had
[1:17:04] said some days before, "If I could only
[1:17:06] have what they have." And they happened
[1:17:08] to be
[1:17:09] in that house.
[1:17:12] And this woman asked my father, "Would
[1:17:14] you like to be saved?" He said just
[1:17:16] before he was leaving, he said, "I don't
[1:17:18] know what that means." Said, "You can be
[1:17:20] free from your sin, free from your
[1:17:23] guilt." He said, "Oh, if I ever could
[1:17:25] know that I'd be free from my guilt."
[1:17:28] And the woman said, "Well, we're having
[1:17:30] little meetings over in a house here
[1:17:33] and you could come on Sunday." He said,
[1:17:36] "I was plowing in the field and
[1:17:38] something came over me and I dropped to
[1:17:40] the my knees and said, "If there was a
[1:17:42] God, if he ever showed me how I could be
[1:17:45] free from my guilt, I'd receive it that
[1:17:47] very day." And she slid out a chair and
[1:17:51] he knelt at a chair and stood up. a
[1:17:54] transformed person.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; There's been a change in me. And friend,
[1:17:59] the old time gospel is still the new
[1:18:02] time gospel. It's still the gospel that
[1:18:05] works.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe in that kind of
[1:18:08] gospel. I believe in that kind of
[1:18:11] sacrifice.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're no longer
[1:18:16] there are no sacrifices for sin outside
[1:18:19] of outside of the one that was made,
[1:18:21] Jesus Christ. And so the scripture says,
[1:18:24] and I want to read a few scriptures if
[1:18:26] you just listen attentively please.
[1:18:31] In Jeremiah, now the prophet Jeremiah is
[1:18:34] speaking. He said, "For I spake not
[1:18:36] under your fathers, nor commanded them
[1:18:39] in the in the day that I brought them
[1:18:41] out of the land of Egypt concerning
[1:18:44] burnt offerings and sacrifice
[1:18:47] sacrifices.
[1:18:49] But this thing commanded I them, saying,
[1:18:52] Obey my voice.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Have you got that?
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Obey my voice and I will be your God and
[1:19:00] you shall be my people.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Said now he gave all kinds of
[1:19:03] commandments, but he says, I didn't
[1:19:05] command you just in in offerings and
[1:19:07] sacrifices. That's not it,
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; but I spoke to you to obey my voice.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's a lot of voices. What voice
[1:19:15] is it? And I have a lot to say about
[1:19:18] that. And get right home to where you
[1:19:20] live. And then he went on to say, "But
[1:19:24] this thing I commanded them." Then in
[1:19:25] Jeremiah 6, that was Jeremiah 7. And
[1:19:28] Jeremiah 6 says, "Thus say the Lord,
[1:19:31] stand ye in the ways and see and ask for
[1:19:34] the old paths. Where is the good way?
[1:19:37] And walk therein, and you shall find
[1:19:39] rest for your souls." I say, the old way
[1:19:43] is still a good way.
[1:19:45] Hallelujah.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; The way God ever talked to a a man is
[1:19:50] still the way.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And and repentance is still repentance.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Whether you find it in Genesis or you
[1:19:57] find it in the Bible or you find it in
[1:19:59] 2013, repentance is still the same.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry for my sin. I'm sorry that I
[1:20:05] turned away. I'm sorry that I was even
[1:20:08] in this state and I I I ask for
[1:20:11] forgiveness
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; and receive me. Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; And I give you myself.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; That's oldfashioned,
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; but that's still what works.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; And people want to make, you know, want
[1:20:22] to shine it up and and make it easy and
[1:20:26] just join a church or join a certain
[1:20:29] group or or say, "I agree." And and
[1:20:32] start to be able to repeat the things
[1:20:34] that maybe message believers say. That
[1:20:36] doesn't make you a believer.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Preach it. Amen.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; He says, "Also I set watchmen over you,
[1:20:45] saying, hearken to the sound of the
[1:20:47] trumpet." But they said, "We will not
[1:20:49] hearken."
[1:20:51] Therefore, hear ye nations, and know, oh
[1:20:54] congregation, what is among them here, O
[1:20:57] earth, behold, I will bring evil up upon
[1:20:59] this people, even the fruit of their
[1:21:02] thoughts, because they have not
[1:21:04] hearkened unto my words, nor to my law,
[1:21:07] but rejected it. And to what purpose
[1:21:11] cometh there uh there to me incense from
[1:21:14] Sheba, and the sweet uh canain from a
[1:21:18] far country? Your burnt offerings are
[1:21:21] not acceptable, nor your sacrifice is
[1:21:24] sweet unto me. I just want your
[1:21:26] attention for a moment. These are people
[1:21:27] that have rejected God's word, turned
[1:21:30] away from God's word, but still kept on
[1:21:33] a ceremony of of of religion and
[1:21:35] sacrifices, and that's what we used to
[1:21:37] do. So, we just keep on doing it. And
[1:21:39] God said, "It's a stench.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; I don't want your sacrifices. I I want
[1:21:45] obedience."
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; But when the trumpet sounds, you said
[1:21:48] and it said to hearken, I I won't
[1:21:51] listen. I won't hearken. I won't do it.
[1:21:53] Say,
[1:21:54] there was an announcer yesterday, last
[1:21:57] night. My wife was just listening to the
[1:21:59] news for a moment and uh two two
[1:22:03] announcers are talking
[1:22:05] in the newscast and they said, you know,
[1:22:10] it's uh we have the NHL coming and
[1:22:14] that's kind of the only bright spot we
[1:22:16] can talk about
[1:22:19] the NHL, National Hockey League, but
[1:22:23] that's the only bright spot we can
[1:22:25] really talk about. And the other one
[1:22:26] said, "Yeah, it's hard to talk about the
[1:22:28] NHL when the world is going to hell in a
[1:22:31] basket.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; The rest of the world is going to hell
[1:22:35] in a basket.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Even people who have no consciousness
[1:22:40] perhaps of spiritual things realize that
[1:22:43] there's just a a turmoil throughout the
[1:22:45] earth. How can you have hundreds being
[1:22:48] slain and thousands upon thousands being
[1:22:52] wounded? This is only hours away by jet
[1:22:54] travel in so many countries and
[1:22:57] oppression and dictatorships and people
[1:22:59] trying to shake it. We live we live here
[1:23:02] in a uh perhaps cloistered as it were.
[1:23:05] But don't think friends that we're out
[1:23:08] of reach
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; of a lot of squeeze
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; and a lot of misery
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; and a lot of people have suffered
[1:23:16] economic disaster
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; and have almost become a there's a lot
[1:23:20] of people and we don't have to talk
[1:23:22] about economics but we can talk about
[1:23:25] the pain within the soul of homes tore
[1:23:30] apart
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; and the and the consequence of sin. It's
[1:23:34] severe, friends. It's severe.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Let's not fool ourselves.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; We're not going to whistle in the dark
[1:23:41] or whistle in the graveyard that it's
[1:23:43] not coming. It's coming to our door.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; And the scripture foretell it that the
[1:23:50] whole world will be embroiled. Here's
[1:23:53] what the scripture says. Things shall
[1:23:55] wax worse and worse.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; That's not good news. I'm not here to be
[1:24:01] a have a
[1:24:03] popular by popular demand. I'm here just
[1:24:06] to say what the Bible says. There's
[1:24:08] hardship on every hand even in this
[1:24:10] country of America or Canada or the
[1:24:13] Western world. And and it's it's it's
[1:24:15] sitting in a crisis sitting in a crisis
[1:24:18] position. And but the scripture says it
[1:24:21] will. And and we're not just looking for
[1:24:24] a better life.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in a better life. I'm
[1:24:29] interested in knowing that I have
[1:24:32] personally the sacrifice that is
[1:24:35] pleasing to God because it's the only
[1:24:38] thing that when I cross over that God's
[1:24:41] going to look on and allow me to enter
[1:24:44] into the regions of the blessed
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; in Amos just to make this point a little
[1:24:56] clearer.
[1:24:57] Though you offer me burnt offerings and
[1:24:59] your meat offerings, I will not accept
[1:25:02] them. Neither will I regard the peace
[1:25:05] offerings of your fat beasts.
[1:25:08] See, they were being refused. Now, just
[1:25:12] to take a turn quickly in the token
[1:25:16] message, the prophet said these words,
[1:25:19] the token, and this is where I want to
[1:25:21] come to now. The token is a sign that
[1:25:24] the purchase the token is the sign that
[1:25:28] the purchase has been made and been
[1:25:32] accepted.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Now, you can't get a token from the
[1:25:37] railroad fair
[1:25:39] until you pay the price.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; So, it has to be paid for. And the only
[1:25:44] way you're going to pay the price is pay
[1:25:47] it. There's no other way.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:51] He says, "Believe it and paying it."
[1:25:54] He's referring to believe it.
[1:25:58] There's no other way to get the token
[1:25:59] but to believe it.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Accept it.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And full obedience to the whole word of
[1:26:10] God will entitle you to the token.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; The token. The token was a sign that an
[1:26:18] animal in the Old Testament had been
[1:26:20] sacrificed.
[1:26:22] And the Passover lamb was a and and they
[1:26:25] took the blood and put it upon the
[1:26:27] doorpost and the lentil of the door. And
[1:26:30] he says, "When I see the blood, I'll
[1:26:32] pass over you."
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the blood that caused him to
[1:26:37] pass over. It was the fact that
[1:26:40] obedience put the blood there. Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; It's obedience to every word of God.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; And full obedience.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; He said full obedience entitles you to
[1:26:53] the token.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; He said full obedience not part of it as
[1:26:57] far as your denomination goes.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; And we as believers, I'll say not as far
[1:27:02] as say another message, church. It's so
[1:27:05] it is so incomprehensible that we would
[1:27:08] compare ourselves with ourselves. Well,
[1:27:10] so and so does it. What's that got to do
[1:27:12] with it? It's what does this say?
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; What does the message say?
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; It's not, well, they do it. Well, th
[1:27:20] those kids do it or someone else does it
[1:27:23] or their parents allow it. That has
[1:27:25] nothing to do with it or someone else is
[1:27:28] getting away with it. Who says they're
[1:27:29] getting away with it?
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Who says anybody? We don't get away with
[1:27:36] anything with God. want to say, "Well,
[1:27:38] are are you preaching a God of of uh
[1:27:41] love?" Yes, I am. And I'm preaching of a
[1:27:43] God of justice
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; because there's no justice. There's no
[1:27:47] love without justice.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Talked about Abraham.
[1:27:58] I want you to sit real real Canaan.
[1:28:01] Listen real close because I want to take
[1:28:03] a
[1:28:05] I want to take a little left turn here
[1:28:07] in just a moment.
[1:28:10] Abraham, he said, fully obeyed God.
[1:28:14] And the blessing never came until he
[1:28:17] fully obeyed God.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; So, so it's not just, well, I'm trying
[1:28:22] and I'm doing my best and I'm so forth.
[1:28:26] That's not it.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; It's full obedience. It's being sold
[1:28:30] out.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; You can call it a fanatical if you want,
[1:28:33] but I I'm a fanatic for this gospel.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me? I'm a
[1:28:40] fanatic for the gospel. I'm a fanatic
[1:28:42] for this message.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Because I have seen this message produce
[1:28:47] in the lives of people and in my own
[1:28:50] life
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; all these years. It just it holds you.
[1:28:53] When everything else shake, it holds
[1:28:55] you. When you're a young man, it holds
[1:28:58] you.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; When you're young, it helps you to have
[1:29:02] the right kind of desires, the right
[1:29:04] kind of ambition, the right kind of
[1:29:06] direction.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching you young people now.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; I was once young.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; When I was a young person, had some of
[1:29:16] my first automobiles and I bought my
[1:29:19] first car, I wouldn't let them put a
[1:29:21] radio in it
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; when I was young. And that was the big
[1:29:26] thing. That was the day of zoot suitors
[1:29:28] here in Vancouver and long chains down
[1:29:30] the side and and drugs were coming in
[1:29:33] the vogue and were popular and if you
[1:29:35] weren't into the drug scene, you were
[1:29:37] kind of nobody and they were slickers,
[1:29:39] you know, the ducttail and all the rest
[1:29:41] of it. And if you weren't part of that
[1:29:43] scene, you're just kind of nobody. But I
[1:29:46] I swam a different stream.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; You were the oddball.
[1:29:54] There has to be odd balls.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; You're the nut. There has to be nuts.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And I decided then I would be.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; I didn't know all about the sports.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I almost got punched out in Pentictton.
[1:30:11] I drove into Pentictton with my car.
[1:30:14] Didn't have a radio in my car. Got into
[1:30:17] Pentictton to gas up and all these
[1:30:19] signs. Welcome home the V's. Welcome
[1:30:22] home the V's. the Pentictton V's. I
[1:30:25] drove up and rolled the window down. I
[1:30:26] said, "Who's the Pentictton V's?" The
[1:30:29] guy almost punched my lights out. He
[1:30:32] says, "The V's. The V's. The Pentictton
[1:30:35] Ves. We won the World Hockey
[1:30:37] Championship or something." Oh,
[1:30:41] I've just been in some meetings and seen
[1:30:43] souls getting saved.
[1:30:46] I wasn't interested in a Pentictton Ves
[1:30:49] or the hockey champion. You might say,
[1:30:51] "Oh, that's years ago. That's years ago.
[1:30:54] That's what the NHL was. That's what the
[1:30:57] famous basketball players was." We're
[1:31:00] not interested in them.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; They're man, they're flesh. They'll
[1:31:04] live. They'll die. Unless they receive
[1:31:07] Jesus Christ,
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; there's only heaven and hell.
[1:31:12] And when you have a radio announcer say
[1:31:14] it's hard to get excited about the NHL
[1:31:17] when the rest of the world's going to
[1:31:18] hell in a basket.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; He meant what he was saying.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; I I don't have to advance his words, but
[1:31:26] this is what the Bible tells us. And
[1:31:29] we've received a messenger that has told
[1:31:31] us and vindicated. We've heard you
[1:31:34] people have received the last message.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; There won't be another one.
[1:31:41] There won't be another denomination.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; They'll all try to merge together.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Now, of all of these sacrifices
[1:31:52] and all of these offerings, they found
[1:31:55] their full meaning. And I repeat what I
[1:31:59] said earlier in Jesus Christ the supreme
[1:32:03] sacrifice
[1:32:04] who was don't think of him now just as a
[1:32:07] person who lived
[1:32:11] 2,000 or some years ago
[1:32:15] because that will displace it in your
[1:32:17] mind.
[1:32:19] He was the word then.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; That's what he was.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; And very few obeyed the sound.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Very few. Multitudes heard his voice,
[1:32:34] but very few heard the sound or obeyed
[1:32:37] the voice.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; And as it was, so is it.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; They want the bread and the fishes. Oh,
[1:32:45] we want the fellowship around the
[1:32:47] message and all of those things. We want
[1:32:49] more than fellowship
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; and we want more than bread and fishes.
[1:32:54] We want more than just a, you know, the
[1:32:57] econ economic things to happen right
[1:33:00] into things that run smooth in the home.
[1:33:02] We want more than just peace blessings.
[1:33:05] We want to know that sacrifice
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; has been made
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; for my soul. You say, "Well, it was on
[1:33:12] Calvary." Yeah, but that one on Calvary
[1:33:15] hung there because he was the word and
[1:33:18] he's still the word and he's still Jesus
[1:33:20] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:33:24] forever. What he was, he is. And what he
[1:33:26] is, he will be.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, I heard him last
[1:33:30] night. He said that's humans just always
[1:33:33] make that mistake. They rejoice in what
[1:33:35] God has done. They will talk about what
[1:33:38] he will do and fail to see what he is
[1:33:41] doing. Friends, the critical moment is
[1:33:45] this morning.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; The critical moment is now here
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; at 10 12
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; 2013.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; I think it's the 17th or something
[1:33:58] today. This is the critical moment, not
[1:34:02] what's going to happen. You don't even
[1:34:03] know if you're going to be here
[1:34:04] tomorrow.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Nobody has any guarantee of tomorrow.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; We are what we are today. Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; And his his word his word has always
[1:34:16] been the sacrifice.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Elijah comes to place the heart right so
[1:34:23] that the life by the Holy Spirit comes
[1:34:26] into you
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; and then that life begins to be lived
[1:34:30] out
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; and that is the sacrifice and God looks
[1:34:34] on that sacrifice and said I'm pleased.
[1:34:37] Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; He can only be pleased with what he was
[1:34:40] pleased with when he saw that life in
[1:34:42] obedience back then and he sees that
[1:34:45] life now living in you.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Well, I I don't
[1:34:49] know. I hear about people giving their
[1:34:51] lives and oh, forget that.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Hear them about going over and, you
[1:34:55] know, going over to some far away
[1:34:57] country and doing." I said, "Forget
[1:34:59] that. Most of you aren't going to go
[1:35:02] there anyway.
[1:35:04] But you can live now
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; a life in obedience
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; to the word of God.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; A life a life that God looked on back
[1:35:14] then
[1:35:16] and said, "I'm satisfied.
[1:35:19] I'm pleased
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; because this life is an obedience to my
[1:35:26] word."
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Some of it we have control of. Some of
[1:35:32] it we have no control of. Some of the
[1:35:35] life of Jesus he had no control of. He
[1:35:38] was born of a virgin. He didn't choose
[1:35:42] that
[1:35:44] as a man. He didn't choose that. He was
[1:35:46] simply born of a virgin because a
[1:35:50] prophet said it.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope this swimming water, but I
[1:35:56] hope it doesn't get too strong. I'm
[1:35:57] trying to preach it in simplicity.
[1:36:00] The prophets spoke the body of Jesus
[1:36:04] Christ into existence.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Matthew 1, Matthew first chapter said
[1:36:13] this is the way the birth of Jesus
[1:36:15] happened.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; It tells about now the birth of Christ
[1:36:18] was on this wise. In other words, listen
[1:36:21] to me now you that are visiting. The
[1:36:23] birth of Christ happened on this wise.
[1:36:26] This is how it happened. And then it
[1:36:28] goes into detail how it happened, how
[1:36:31] the birth of Christ happened. And then
[1:36:32] it starts out with this verse along
[1:36:35] towards the end of the chapter. Now
[1:36:38] all this was done.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; What was done? All the details of his
[1:36:44] birth. All this was done that it might
[1:36:47] be fulfilled.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; That was spoken of by of the Lord by the
[1:36:52] prophets. So it was the Lord himself
[1:36:55] that told how the sacrifice would come
[1:36:59] and the first Adam disobeyed but this
[1:37:02] Adam will not disobey.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; And that's why I say he was spoken into
[1:37:11] existence because had the prophets not
[1:37:13] said it, it wouldn't have happened. It
[1:37:15] wasn't the prophet. It was the God of
[1:37:18] the prophets
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; causing them to speak.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandham said if they
[1:37:25] and how well he would know it. He said
[1:37:27] they would in no wise have said those
[1:37:29] things if they knew what they were
[1:37:31] saying.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; They spoke things they didn't know what
[1:37:34] they were saying. We even do things we
[1:37:37] don't know why we do it. We make
[1:37:40] decisions and the decision they're
[1:37:42] decisions of sacrifice.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we don't even know why we make
[1:37:46] those decisions.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; The scripture says this. I must move
[1:38:01] along quickly because I'm coming right
[1:38:04] to a point I want to make very very
[1:38:07] strong.
[1:38:13] Paul, first church age messenger, he
[1:38:17] said, "Now I beseech you, brethren," and
[1:38:19] I like to say that to you this morning.
[1:38:21] I beseech you, brethren
[1:38:25] and sisters,
[1:38:27] therefore
[1:38:29] by the mercies of God
[1:38:32] that you present your bodies a living
[1:38:37] sacrifice.
[1:38:40] Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; There is no such a thing in the Old
[1:38:43] Testament. The sacrifice, even the word
[1:38:45] means slaughter,
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; kill it.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; But now, Apostle Paul knowing that the
[1:38:53] supreme sacrifice and the and the
[1:38:56] fulfillment, not merely the fulfillment,
[1:38:58] but the uh composite, the the the end
[1:39:03] result of all of those sacrifices have
[1:39:05] been met in one person. Not just a
[1:39:08] person that we become affectionately
[1:39:10] known as to Jesus Christ. More than
[1:39:12] that, but we want to say the word,
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; the living word. In other words, a
[1:39:18] sacrifice.
[1:39:20] Hear me now. The sacrifice changed form.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Hey, I know something about changing
[1:39:28] form
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; at my age. Some of you folks, you all
[1:39:32] know what about changing form as well.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; But you're still the same person.
[1:39:38] That's right.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe you liked olives as a kid and you
[1:39:43] still like olives or you hated something
[1:39:46] at some time, you know, as a child and
[1:39:49] you still do.
[1:39:51] I've been having a bit of a struggle
[1:39:53] because I I grew up loving butter and
[1:39:57] honey.
[1:39:58] Oh, I thought people who didn't eat
[1:40:01] honey were some weird people from Mars
[1:40:05] or something. Honey is meant for the
[1:40:08] honey is meant for the good of the
[1:40:10] people. And and we in the northern
[1:40:12] Canada had honey almost as as white as
[1:40:14] that paper. And I thought the honey all
[1:40:17] over the world was like that. And uh so
[1:40:20] I packed that honey to South Africa. And
[1:40:23] when brother Willie Ratif got his jar of
[1:40:25] honey, he took it quick and disappeared.
[1:40:28] And that honey never reappeared again. I
[1:40:32] think it he he just went and kind of
[1:40:34] secretly had it. You know, maybe
[1:40:36] himself. I don't know. If Brother Willie
[1:40:37] hears this, he'll understand what I say.
[1:40:40] He loved that honey. Somebody down from
[1:40:42] Tennessee was up and I I gave him some
[1:40:45] of that northern honey.
[1:40:47] H honey requires I shouldn't get on this
[1:40:49] subject but honey requires a lot of good
[1:40:52] water, fresh water that is handy and
[1:40:56] close because a bee has to have water
[1:40:59] and they after they get nectar and uh
[1:41:02] and then uh up north they have a lot of
[1:41:05] clover and wild fireweed which grows
[1:41:09] high and they got that fireweed and it
[1:41:12] gives the most wonderful honey.
[1:41:15] I'm a connoisseur of honey.
[1:41:18] You have to understand that. Don't send
[1:41:19] me any honey because now the doctor says
[1:41:21] I mustn't have any.
[1:41:24] That's why I said I have a massive
[1:41:26] problem.
[1:41:28] I I thought the first thing you do in
[1:41:30] the morning is reach and get that honey
[1:41:32] and mix it with your cereal. Anybody
[1:41:34] doesn't do that is wacko.
[1:41:38] Well, I guess I've gone wackle because I
[1:41:40] can't do it anymore. He said you mustn't
[1:41:42] do that. Yeah. you know, cut it back.
[1:41:45] And so anyway, we we've done that, but I
[1:41:48] just thought that that was, you know,
[1:41:50] but we changed form. Say, well,
[1:41:54] you're the same as you were years ago,
[1:41:56] Brother Ed. Well, that's fine. No, some
[1:41:58] things have changed. And my system
[1:42:00] starts to say, you can't do that,
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; but I I want to do it. I'm the same
[1:42:06] person.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; I'm the same thing. Now, I'm going to
[1:42:09] take it a little bit deeper.
[1:42:13] I understand
[1:42:15] from the DNA
[1:42:18] that we all have which is a unit of
[1:42:21] hereditary
[1:42:22] that come down
[1:42:25] and uh
[1:42:27] now we're get going to get in some
[1:42:28] swimming water so just
[1:42:31] hang on to it
[1:42:36] and that they connect those cells and
[1:42:39] they call it a chain.
[1:42:43] And I wanted to know if those chains
[1:42:45] ever break
[1:42:48] or if they get damaged. And I found that
[1:42:50] they could.
[1:42:52] And it would uh it it would it would
[1:42:55] indicate a sickness or a disease and
[1:42:58] could get more serious even if damaged.
[1:43:01] But if that chain breaks, it could get
[1:43:04] And then
[1:43:06] then I found where the prophet of God
[1:43:09] was speaking to someone
[1:43:11] and he was talking to a specialist in
[1:43:15] Mayo Clinic.
[1:43:17] And the specialist in Mayo Clinic said,
[1:43:20] "Well, you got that by hereditary."
[1:43:23] No, he said, "I have another father."
[1:43:28] Notice how quick. said, "I have another
[1:43:31] father." He's talking about a DNA and
[1:43:35] he's denying what came by through
[1:43:39] natural breeding and his natural what he
[1:43:43] inherited from natural birth.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Said, "You have that because it's a you
[1:43:49] it was an you inherited it." Says, "But
[1:43:52] I have another father."
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Says, "But you're going to have this."
[1:43:55] No, I'm not going to have that
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; because I have another father.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And he's not talking about some poetic
[1:44:03] license. He's not talking about some
[1:44:05] He's talking about a chain that is
[1:44:07] stronger than this DNA.
[1:44:11] And so I'm here to say to you, you have
[1:44:13] inherited things. You have come by
[1:44:16] things by way of your natural birth. But
[1:44:19] the new birth has broken that link.
[1:44:24] The new birth has broken that chain and
[1:44:27] you need not be subjected. Say, well, I
[1:44:31] was born that way. I was born with this
[1:44:33] temper. We've got all kinds today that
[1:44:36] even publications are they're born
[1:44:39] homosexuals. No, that might be in their
[1:44:42] DNA. I don't know. I'm not here to
[1:44:44] discuss that. But I happen to know
[1:44:46] another DNA. I happen to know another
[1:44:49] chain that is greater than that one. and
[1:44:53] not only will break that one, but will
[1:44:55] give the healing that that person needs.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; My father may have been born with the
[1:45:02] weakness of alcohol. I don't know. He
[1:45:04] loved to dance. He loved the world. He
[1:45:07] was born with perhaps those things that
[1:45:09] was part of his culture. But he got
[1:45:11] connected to another father. And he
[1:45:14] found out that there was by revelation
[1:45:16] there was another DNA and there was
[1:45:18] another birth. And it broke this chain.
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:29] Hallelujah.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; I know you believe it
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; and I know you've experienced it. But
[1:45:36] this morning I came with a heavy message
[1:45:39] on my heart and that is
[1:45:44] that I expect all of us at some point in
[1:45:47] time, you know, we have our our
[1:45:50] struggles and perhaps have come to the
[1:45:52] point where we feel I've tried so long.
[1:45:57] I've attempted so long. I've given it my
[1:46:00] best so long and I I have just finally
[1:46:03] given up
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; and I I just succumbed to this. I guess
[1:46:08] I was born that way. No,
[1:46:13] there's a life
[1:46:16] that's in you
[1:46:18] by the new birth.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; And it happens to be a life of
[1:46:23] sacrifice.
[1:46:24] And God wants you to speak with the
[1:46:27] Apostle Paul and say, "I die daily."
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; And yet I live, but I don't live. It's a
[1:46:35] Christ. It's the life of Christ.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; I should say the life of the sacrifice
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; that lives in you.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; And you need to offer that upon your
[1:46:45] heart.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; And you need to say in your heart, I
[1:46:48] will do that.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:46:54] I will do that.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; And we've heard, have you heard the
[1:46:58] shout?
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, we rejoice over that. We've heard
[1:47:01] the shout, but maybe the shout in the
[1:47:04] message has said even more than we've
[1:47:06] been able to assimilate into our system
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; and we know and we have a witness and we
[1:47:13] have a little tinkling. And uh I'm going
[1:47:16] to give a an example that you'll
[1:47:18] remember. Marilyn had a a dog whose name
[1:47:22] was Tyson.
[1:47:24] He's a big boxer.
[1:47:27] Oh,
[1:47:29] I loved that dog also. He was just
[1:47:31] really a fine dog. But, you know, he he
[1:47:36] loved to go out for a walk.
[1:47:39] And all we had to do was I just had to
[1:47:42] reach up and get his leash
[1:47:45] and just rattle that chain a little bit.
[1:47:48] I just rattle that chain. man, he'd leap
[1:47:51] up wherever he was snoozing or sleeping
[1:47:53] and come around the corner just
[1:47:55] scratching the floor with his claws. He
[1:47:58] He just wanted to go for a walk so bad.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; He just wanted that release. What did he
[1:48:04] want? He wanted to feel that chain. He
[1:48:07] wanted me to, you know, snap it on. And
[1:48:09] he just wanted to feel that tug because
[1:48:12] he knew he was going outside and going
[1:48:14] for a walk. And he he knew that was some
[1:48:17] freedom and some liberty. I tell you
[1:48:18] what, friends, in this message today, I
[1:48:21] had this witness in my heart that God
[1:48:23] wants to tingle, tingle your chain and
[1:48:26] let you know it's a chain of love.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Change of love. The apo the prophet of
[1:48:32] God said that apostle the apostle Paul,
[1:48:35] he became a prisoner
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; to Jesus Christ and to the word of God.
[1:48:41] Do you hear me? Up on the balcony, he
[1:48:43] became a prisoner. He became a prisoner
[1:48:46] bound. He said I I I He said that that I
[1:48:51] may apprehend
[1:48:52] that for which I'm apprehended. That I
[1:48:55] might lay hold. He's saying that I might
[1:48:58] lay hold upon it. That I might grasp it
[1:49:01] with the same intensity it has grasped
[1:49:04] me.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; I I I hear the chain. I hear the chain
[1:49:10] of love jingling. And I hear a chain. I
[1:49:13] hear a word that I can be released from
[1:49:16] this thing. This thing that has held on
[1:49:18] to me. This thing that has held me back
[1:49:20] from what I know God's full inheritance
[1:49:22] is. Listen, it's the chain of God's DNA.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; God's DNA.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; His love for you, his love for his
[1:49:33] child.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; His love for you is a daughter of God, a
[1:49:37] son of God. And the chain is saying you
[1:49:39] can be free. Amen.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in I'm not interested
[1:49:44] in just going on week after week or year
[1:49:47] after year. I'm here to tell you that
[1:49:49] there's a message that goes beyond this
[1:49:52] church. There's a message that goes
[1:49:54] beyond your understanding. And the Holy
[1:49:56] Spirit is jangling your chain this
[1:49:59] morning.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; And what a person needs to say is what
[1:50:06] the prophet said. I will.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; I will.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:50:13] Hallelujah.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; And then a person
[1:50:21] is able to say
[1:50:24] that's behind me.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; And what are you? You're living
[1:50:29] sacrifice.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; You're able uh the the order of your
[1:50:34] sacrifice rises to God and he says, "I'm
[1:50:36] pleased." And people, your brother, your
[1:50:39] sister, your peers, they look upon you
[1:50:42] and say, "There's somebody." Don't tell
[1:50:45] me it can't happen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; I see it.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; I go to school with it.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; I go to church with it. I see people are
[1:50:52] different. I see homes that are
[1:50:54] different. Don't tell me that we can't
[1:50:55] be victorious in this age. I see young
[1:50:57] people that are completely victorious in
[1:50:59] this age. I see I see those I see men
[1:51:02] and women who've said no to the world.
[1:51:05] No to the entertainments of the world.
[1:51:07] No to the ways of the world. We're not
[1:51:10] interested in their ways. We're not
[1:51:11] interested in their philosophy. It has
[1:51:14] got them nowhere.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; not as though I already attained
[1:51:29] either. We're already perfect. We're not
[1:51:32] there. Amen.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; We haven't attained.
[1:51:36] This speaks to all of us.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul is speaking on our behalf.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Because we haven't attained doesn't mean
[1:51:43] we reach out. We don't reach out.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Don't sit back.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking a word of warning. Don't
[1:51:50] sit back.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Don't expect to be just what you were
[1:51:54] last week.
[1:51:58] What has the word said about your cause
[1:52:01] and your case?
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; What has the word said about it?
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Word said you can be free.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; God has to make that real to you.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; But if he's making real to you, I said
[1:52:17] tune your ear
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; to the jingle of that chain,
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; the chain of God's word. Amen.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Don't let it go over your head now,
[1:52:33] please. I'm getting This is the message.
[1:52:37] This where I'm at.
[1:52:39] This what God wants me to say.
[1:52:43] Not as though I had already attained
[1:52:45] either were already perfect. But I
[1:52:46] follow after
[1:52:51] if that I may apprehend
[1:52:55] that for which also I'm apprehended of
[1:52:57] Christ.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Such a powerful, potent scripture.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not perfect. I'm not mature.
[1:53:07] I'm not what I want to be.
[1:53:13] I'm not there yet.
[1:53:15] But I follow after it.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to sit back and accept
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; just where I'm at.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to move forward.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Young men, young ladies, I'm going to
[1:53:27] move forward.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; I'm in my senior years. I want you to
[1:53:31] say, "I will do that.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; I don't know what the cost. I don't know
[1:53:35] what it's going to be, but I will do
[1:53:36] that.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I will believe that word of God."
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:42] and I'll follow after it that I may
[1:53:44] apprehend it.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not today. Maybe it's
[1:53:48] tomorrow. Maybe it's next week. I don't
[1:53:50] know. But I'm reaching out
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; that I may apprehend it.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Every once in a while I see on the
[1:53:59] newscast somebody being apprehended.
[1:54:04] somebody who was wellto-do, maybe some
[1:54:07] guy that was rich
[1:54:10] and he lived in a castle, he lived in
[1:54:12] this home, he had a home in Florida,
[1:54:14] maybe a home over in Paris and whatever
[1:54:16] more. And finally,
[1:54:18] finally FBI or CIA or other agents come
[1:54:23] in and they put handcuffs on him
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; and the next thing you see, he's in an
[1:54:28] orange suit
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; and he walks away
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; and he's got four walls.
[1:54:34] and a little toilet in one side and a
[1:54:37] little cot in the other side. And he's
[1:54:39] come from such pomp and glory and luxury
[1:54:42] and esteem of the people.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; He reduced to nothing.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he's apprehended
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; for his deeds.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit,
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to you now. The Holy Spirit
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; came upon you
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; for the purpose of apprehending you. And
[1:55:03] thus a messenger could say, "You're not
[1:55:05] your own.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; You have been bought with a price
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; by the precious blood of Jesus Christ."
[1:55:13] And that was the only life that could
[1:55:15] satisfy the judgment of God. And that's
[1:55:18] why when you receive that life by the
[1:55:20] Holy Spirit into you, God says to you,
[1:55:22] "You're free.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; You're free."
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't that clear?
[1:55:31] Hallelujah.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; But before I close,
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; I can't close
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; because I know that you have sat I'm
[1:55:40] going to prophesy now.
[1:55:42] I know that you've sat in many meetings
[1:55:46] and you've heard many of these ministers
[1:55:50] and I know that God has
[1:55:55] jingle the chain in your ear.
[1:55:58] Amen.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; And down in your heart
[1:56:03] there was a still small voice.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Listen to me now.
[1:56:10] We probably won't come in there again.
[1:56:12] There's a still small voice
[1:56:15] saying, "This is for you.
[1:56:18] You don't have to have that control you.
[1:56:23] This is for you." You might say, maybe
[1:56:25] you said, "Well, I I'm just Irish or I'm
[1:56:27] just German or I'm just Ukrainian or I'm
[1:56:29] just whatever. I'm Ukrainian."
[1:56:32] Say, "Well, they have a weakness for
[1:56:34] something and then you find something to
[1:56:36] have a weakness for one thing and a
[1:56:37] weakness for another thing." Deny that
[1:56:40] thing.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; That voice is not God's voice.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; The still small voice keeps saying the
[1:56:48] same thing.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; You can be free.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; You can be free. This sacrifice was
[1:56:54] complete. This is not a sacrifice plus.
[1:56:57] This sacrifice was complete. And if you
[1:56:59] just say, if you'll just obey
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; the voice,
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; I got something for you. The shout is
[1:57:07] the message.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; The voice is the resurrection.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; I have some deep questions. Maybe
[1:57:15] because of my age,
[1:57:18] but if a person doesn't hear the voice
[1:57:21] of the shout, I'm talking about the
[1:57:23] whole voice of the shout. We're not
[1:57:26] looking for perfection. We're looking
[1:57:27] for some that follow on.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; I still continue.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not there yet, but I am following
[1:57:35] after it. I'm passionate about this
[1:57:38] word. I'm passionate about God's work.
[1:57:40] I'm passionate about People say, "Well,
[1:57:42] it's the church." No, it's not the
[1:57:44] church. I'm passionate about what God
[1:57:46] the direction God gives. I believe in
[1:57:48] the leadership of the Holy Spirit. I'm
[1:57:51] passionate about it.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; I've been humbled, terribly humbled
[1:58:00] by some of the people
[1:58:03] that come from Africa.
[1:58:05] And that's why I say God bless you and
[1:58:07] don't ever lose it. Hallelujah.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; They have they've been birthed with such
[1:58:12] a respect
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; and they put a connection very quickly
[1:58:16] from God from the supernatural to God
[1:58:18] himself. They can bypass a messenger.
[1:58:22] When I say bypass, not they don't by
[1:58:25] they don't they don't ignore them. They
[1:58:26] bypass it to get to the source.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; I've had that. Daniel, I'll take your
[1:58:33] hand.
[1:58:35] You can stand
[1:58:37] as brother Daniel.
[1:58:40] I've had people like brother Daniel, not
[1:58:43] him, but people like him take my hand
[1:58:47] and say, I just want to look into the
[1:58:50] eyes that the prophet of God looked into
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; and I want to see the face that he
[1:58:58] spoke. I've read I've read the words,
[1:59:00] but I want I want to look into the face
[1:59:01] that he looked into while he said those
[1:59:03] words.
[1:59:05] And I just got reduced down. I felt so
[1:59:08] small
[1:59:12] and shake the hand that he shook
[1:59:17] and I felt so humiliated and so small.
[1:59:21] Thank you, brother Daniel.
[1:59:25] That kind of respect people, it's not
[1:59:27] respect for me. That kind of respect for
[1:59:30] God
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; gets answers.
[1:59:34] Amen.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; When you young people are thinking about
[1:59:48] marriage,
[1:59:49] the most important thing,
[1:59:52] you better talk to someone who hears
[1:59:54] from God.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before you get married
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; or before you even think of a partner,
[2:00:01] you need to talk to someone. You need to
[2:00:04] have that kind of honor and respect. Not
[2:00:07] for the man.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; We don't care about the man. We care
[2:00:12] about the office.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; A few presidents ago, there was
[2:00:21] President Bush and then there was
[2:00:22] President Bush. There was President
[2:00:24] Clinton and various presidents,
[2:00:26] President Reagan and so on so forth.
[2:00:29] When those men were in power, they could
[2:00:31] sign a declaration of war. The day they
[2:00:33] were voted out, their signature is worth
[2:00:35] nothing.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Why? All the authority went with the
[2:00:39] office.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; People can talk about William Brandham
[2:00:45] say, "Well, I think he did this and I
[2:00:47] think he did that." They're missing it.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; They're missing it completely. all the
[2:00:52] authorities with the office.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; And God never changed.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Moses had a temper. He had never changed
[2:01:00] his office. He was still the same
[2:01:02] prophet, do the same miracles the next
[2:01:05] day.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; He's supposed to strike the rock twice,
[2:01:08] struck it, struck it once, and he struck
[2:01:10] it twice. It's still brought forth.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; You understand? It's the office.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; And God does what he wants with the
[2:01:19] office. Then some will rise up and say,
[2:01:22] "Well, he spoke a certain me. He spoke a
[2:01:24] certain prophecy. It didn't happen." I
[2:01:26] can tell you one. His name was Jonah.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Have you read about him?
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; He prophesied yet 40 days.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Very specific prophecy. 40 days and
[2:01:38] God's going to destroy this city.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; And they repented such as no city has
[2:01:43] ever repented. And it didn't happen.
[2:01:45] Right.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; And God didn't come down and say,
[2:01:48] "Sorry, Jonah.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Sorry the people don't understand you.
[2:01:53] Some don't think you're a prophet
[2:01:54] anymore. I don't make any difference."
[2:01:56] God does what he wants to do.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God honors his word.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; And even the king and all of them
[2:02:04] repented in sackcloth and ashes. Amen.
[2:02:13] But when you hear and I'm closing now
[2:02:19] I had a witness in my heart in this
[2:02:22] study and before I came this morning
[2:02:26] that there's probably quite a few
[2:02:30] that you've heard that I thought of
[2:02:33] these various chains
[2:02:36] the chains of truth
[2:02:40] There's something in you says that's
[2:02:42] true.
[2:02:43] That is true.
[2:02:45] Why don't you hang a hold get a hold of
[2:02:47] it?
[2:02:49] Why don't you this morning say that is
[2:02:50] true? But then there's another chain
[2:02:53] says well you know you've tried before.
[2:03:01] So what?
[2:03:04] You tried before?
[2:03:06] You failed so many times. So what?
[2:03:15] Mayo Clinic said this. You inherited
[2:03:18] that.
[2:03:19] God was not and the prophet of God was
[2:03:23] not being disrespectful.
[2:03:30] I have to read that for you.
[2:03:33] Mayo brother said to me,
[2:03:37] "You can't get well."
[2:03:41] He said, "I got a right to."
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Now follow this. He says, "I have a
[2:03:48] right to."
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, you inherited it from
[2:03:53] your father."
[2:03:56] I said, "But my heavenly father redeemed
[2:03:58] me."
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm I'm out of the pawn shop
[2:04:04] now.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; So just move over, Satan."
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll just pull I'll just pull
[2:04:11] some symptoms all around you." Now he's
[2:04:12] talking what the enemy is saying to him.
[2:04:14] That's coming. Now he's in a
[2:04:16] conversation. Is this all right,
[2:04:17] friends?
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Because he he he says the same things to
[2:04:22] you and me. But the symptoms say, and he
[2:04:26] says,
[2:04:28] uh, and he said, I'll just pull some
[2:04:29] symptoms all around you. And I said,
[2:04:32] stand around. Listen to me testify. I'd
[2:04:35] like I'd like for you to hear me. He
[2:04:37] said, I'll make you sick. I said, I'll
[2:04:40] testify that much harder. I'll make that
[2:04:43] much more testimony.
[2:04:45] If you want to hear me, praise God.
[2:04:47] Stick around a little while and you'll
[2:04:49] hear me. He said, "I just kept praising
[2:04:52] God and made it so hot for him he had to
[2:04:55] flee."
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; If it happened then back then it
[2:05:00] happened the same thing today.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; whereby are given unto us. You say, "Oh,
[2:05:09] yeah. Well, I know that." No, you're on
[2:05:12] the wrong channel. whereby are given
[2:05:15] unto us, to every single person of you
[2:05:19] that are attending, and you that are
[2:05:22] streaming.
[2:05:24] This is given to you exceeding
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; and great and precious promises
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; that by these
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; you might be partakers
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; of the divine nature.
[2:05:42] And I say hallelujah.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; God has provided a thus saith the Lord,
[2:05:48] a revealed truth word.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; And by this we can become partakers of
[2:05:55] the divine nature, having escaped the
[2:05:57] corruption that is in the world through
[2:06:00] lust.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Perhaps, Brother Ryan, if you could
[2:06:07] come, if you would, please.
[2:06:21] You've listened close.
[2:06:24] You've listened attentively.
[2:06:27] And I do not want to close merely to
[2:06:29] close.
[2:06:31] I'm not having a service just to have an
[2:06:33] alter call. That's not my purpose. My
[2:06:36] purpose is that you
[2:06:39] will listen once again.
[2:06:42] And I want to encourage you to attune
[2:06:45] your ear
[2:06:49] to that voice, to that little rattle of
[2:06:52] the chain
[2:06:55] to show that
[2:06:57] the prophet said, listen now, he said
[2:07:01] that there's a when Christ was at
[2:07:04] Calvary, it was
[2:07:07] hooked into earth
[2:07:10] and all the way and hooked into to the
[2:07:12] throne of God.
[2:07:15] And that was an unbroken connection.
[2:07:18] That's that's the lineage I'm connected
[2:07:21] to. That's the lineage you as a believer
[2:07:24] are connected to.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; That's your unbroken
[2:07:28] DNA.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; It is the God's promise, God's
[2:07:33] sacrifice. Oh friends, I started reading
[2:07:37] about sacrifices and the countries and
[2:07:40] the religions and the people that have
[2:07:42] sacrifices and that there's pages and
[2:07:44] pages and pages. I wearied I couldn't
[2:07:46] read it all and they sacrificed for so
[2:07:49] many reasons and so many religions all
[2:07:52] over the earth. All manner of people and
[2:07:55] cultures and so on have sacrifices. I
[2:07:58] was in Nepal and and and and there's a
[2:08:01] little hole, a small doorway in a wall
[2:08:03] and I could see that there was blood
[2:08:05] stain over it. And so I said, "What what
[2:08:08] does this represent?" And they said,
[2:08:09] "Well,
[2:08:11] they take a goat and they kill this goat
[2:08:14] and they put blood over it like this
[2:08:16] over this little entrance and people
[2:08:18] pass through it and so on and so forth
[2:08:20] and and I thought my you know and they
[2:08:24] don't know perhaps they don't know about
[2:08:26] the cross and the blood of Jesus
[2:08:28] Christ." Friends,
[2:08:33] listen close as I am concluding. I'm and
[2:08:35] concluding with some things that uh my
[2:08:38] mind had a hard time getting around
[2:08:45] when God I don't know how he slew
[2:08:50] animals and clothed Adam and Eve.
[2:08:52] There's some details he doesn't give us.
[2:08:58] But brother Brandham describes Adam
[2:09:00] walking
[2:09:03] and the loose hide flapping on his manly
[2:09:08] body
[2:09:10] and the trickles of blood going down.
[2:09:12] Trickles of blood that can't cleanse
[2:09:13] them from sin and his disobedience has
[2:09:17] just taken place. And the prophet said
[2:09:22] they can they can cry now.
[2:09:27] He said tears going down their face
[2:09:31] being being sent out from the presence
[2:09:34] of God.
[2:09:36] They can cry now.
[2:09:40] And I I wept.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; I wept at the description of this scene.
[2:09:50] But God made the sacrifice.
[2:09:53] Then Abraham made them and Moses made
[2:09:56] them. Listen now. When Moses Ma Moses
[2:10:00] was given instruction and they would
[2:10:01] make an altar
[2:10:04] and they would prepare the wood, they
[2:10:07] God's children prepared the wood,
[2:10:09] prepared the altar, and God's people
[2:10:13] then slew the animal.
[2:10:16] And God's priests took the blood and
[2:10:19] sprinkled it or poured it around the
[2:10:22] mercy seat and various things.
[2:10:26] Then Elijah came, the spirit of Elijah,
[2:10:30] and the altar was broken down. No one
[2:10:32] said to him, Elijah, the altar's broken
[2:10:34] down. He was the one who recognized
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; they had their religion. We had our
[2:10:40] religion. When I met the prophet of God,
[2:10:43] I was just troubled about the way the
[2:10:45] direction things were going. I didn't
[2:10:46] know the altar was broken down.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; I didn't know my heart needed to be
[2:10:51] spoken to, but he uttered some
[2:10:53] scriptures.
[2:10:55] The false anointed, the rain falls on
[2:10:58] the just and the unjust. And said, that
[2:11:00] is true. That is true. What's happened?
[2:11:03] My young heart as a minister of seven
[2:11:05] years said, "What's going on? We preach
[2:11:08] with all of our strength, all of our
[2:11:10] might, and it just keeps getting worse.
[2:11:14] You give a scripture, give another
[2:11:15] scripture. It took Elijah to arrange the
[2:11:19] heart, the emotions, and the loyalty
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; and the gravity of God's word.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Back in Pentecost, they never gave the
[2:11:27] same importance. Look where they've gone
[2:11:29] today.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; It's just a It's just a promotional
[2:11:35] thing.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; And I wondered about that. Are you
[2:11:37] listening to me?
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; You are.
[2:11:41] And I I I I needed my heart arranged.
[2:11:45] And then I began to realize that the and
[2:11:48] he says the life of Christ, the evidence
[2:11:51] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that
[2:11:55] the life of Jesus Christ comes into you.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; That was the sacrifice friends.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; That is the only sacrifice.
[2:12:05] And that is why people can do many good
[2:12:07] works beyond us, beyond what we would
[2:12:11] do. And he says, "Nuns don't go into the
[2:12:15] they don't go into the church and take
[2:12:17] on a ring of the church to be bad
[2:12:19] people. Priests don't go into the church
[2:12:20] to be bad. They go in to be good. They
[2:12:23] go in to give their lives.
[2:12:25] They sacrifice themselves in various
[2:12:28] countries and live in poverty, utter
[2:12:30] poverty to give their lives not to be
[2:12:33] bad, to be good people.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; And they perhaps exceed us or exceed you
[2:12:37] or I manyfold
[2:12:40] in what we would call sacrifice. That's
[2:12:42] not the sacrifice.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; That is an honorable thing. But the
[2:12:47] sacrifice is none other than the life of
[2:12:50] Jesus Christ.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yes.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; You understand that? The life of Jesus
[2:12:57] Christ, the life that moved him
[2:13:01] through the pool of Bethea, Betheda,
[2:13:05] and stepped over those that were
[2:13:07] afflicted and sick and walked to a man
[2:13:10] that maybe wasn't that, but he could
[2:13:12] only do what the God had showed him to
[2:13:14] do. And here's a man been laying here 38
[2:13:16] years, and he said, "Rise up, take up
[2:13:18] your bed."
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "I have no one." right?
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Rise up, take your bed, and walk. And
[2:13:24] he's healed. And brother Brandham said
[2:13:28] that would have been questioned in that
[2:13:29] day and would be questioned today.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; What do you mean? You're a man, a man of
[2:13:34] compassion, a man that represents Jesus
[2:13:36] Christ. You pass over the sick and
[2:13:38] afflicted and take one maybe that's not
[2:13:40] that sick. That was still a sacrifice.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; And he might by bypass many good people
[2:13:46] and come to some some drunkard or
[2:13:49] prostitute.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. true
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; and bypass a good person. We don't know
[2:13:54] that.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; But now I want to I want to conclude
[2:13:58] with this. Thank you for bearing with
[2:14:00] me. But then when that sacrifice came,
[2:14:06] I think that this is just my own
[2:14:08] thoughts now. I think that God in the
[2:14:11] beginning when he said, "Let the earth
[2:14:14] bring forth
[2:14:17] and it brought forth the herb and it
[2:14:19] brought forth the grass and brought
[2:14:22] forth the flowers and brought forth the
[2:14:24] trees."
[2:14:26] I believe that in the mind of God, he
[2:14:30] saw one tree coming. There would be an
[2:14:32] altar one day
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; for his son.
[2:14:37] It would be a cross
[2:14:40] and it would not be his children. It
[2:14:42] would not be good people that cut that
[2:14:44] tree down.
[2:14:46] It would be wicked people that built
[2:14:49] this altar.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Wicked people
[2:14:54] built his altar.
[2:14:58] And God's people would take their
[2:15:00] sacrifice and cause it to bleed and do
[2:15:04] what they wish with the blood. But not
[2:15:06] this one. It was a Roman spear.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; A weapon of war that was wet with his
[2:15:13] blood. The blood of the new creation of
[2:15:16] God.
[2:15:18] I don't I I hope you people are able to
[2:15:20] go where I'm going. It was wicked, vile
[2:15:24] men who spat upon him.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; It was not good men. It was not someone
[2:15:30] killing their sacrifice. It was
[2:15:32] acceptable. God took the vilest and the
[2:15:35] most evil
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; and the rejecting nation
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; and allowed them to make his altar
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; and allowed them to crucify and kill his
[2:15:48] sacrifice
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; because the sacrifice spoke out
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; lay not the sin of their charge.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; They under do not understand what
[2:16:01] they're doing. Forgive them, Father.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; They know not what they do.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; That's the life that wants to live in
[2:16:09] us.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; That's a sacrifice.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Not some smart knowit all or somebody
[2:16:20] who can, you know, hammer everybody with
[2:16:23] doctrine and whatever more. Somebody who
[2:16:26] lives a life.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:34] I'm sorry to be as personal as I am.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; I just spent a week with Brother David
[2:16:40] McGary,
[2:16:42] Pastor McGary and his wife
[2:16:47] and we went with them to Alaska on on a
[2:16:50] boat.
[2:16:52] You know why that happened?
[2:16:56] Marilyn,
[2:16:58] believe she's here someplace when she
[2:17:00] lost her husband.
[2:17:04] I was her daddy.
[2:17:08] And when we'd back out of her driveway
[2:17:11] at night and leave her alone,
[2:17:16] I it just my heart was just tore into
[2:17:20] thought somehow
[2:17:22] someway.
[2:17:27] And then I hear
[2:17:30] that Pastor McGary and he and I had
[2:17:32] never been close.
[2:17:35] I'd never preached in this church.
[2:17:38] and he'd only been maybe in couple of
[2:17:40] meetings of mine.
[2:17:43] And he sent a ticket
[2:17:46] to bring my daughter down
[2:17:48] and give her about a week with them in
[2:17:51] their home.
[2:17:54] And I just had just such a warm feeling.
[2:17:58] That was so kind. years later,
[2:18:02] I meet him
[2:18:05] and I said, "Why did you do that?"
[2:18:11] It had such an effect on me. Why did you
[2:18:13] do that?
[2:18:16] He didn't really know.
[2:18:19] I'll tell you why.
[2:18:22] This man, little man up here,
[2:18:26] needed to see that
[2:18:28] depth of compassion
[2:18:30] to somebody it's not in his church,
[2:18:34] a daughter of a minister he's not that
[2:18:36] close to, but there just something on
[2:18:39] their heart, you know, we just want to
[2:18:40] do it. Come into our home and be with
[2:18:42] us. Is the strangest thing, but I have
[2:18:45] never forgot it.
[2:18:48] You know, you might think, well, how do
[2:18:49] I give my life? No, you're giving it.
[2:18:52] You're giving it right now.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; You're You don't believe that?
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; You're giving it right now.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; That was sacrifice.
[2:19:03] Brother Matthew and Sister Rhonda and
[2:19:06] all of you that were at the camp and
[2:19:08] those of you at the at the booth and not
[2:19:10] only that, those of you that are here
[2:19:12] and you young people at home, it it's
[2:19:15] the life of Christ. And if the life of
[2:19:18] Beethoven and with this I close was in
[2:19:22] me or the life of Beethoven was in you,
[2:19:24] you'd write music.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; And if the life of Leonardo da Vinci was
[2:19:30] in you, you'd paint masterpieces. You'd
[2:19:33] have to because that's the life.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; And when the life of Jesus Christ is in
[2:19:38] you,
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; believe me, I see many things in my own
[2:19:44] life.
[2:19:46] I say, well, and I've asked myself in
[2:19:49] that last week, I've asked myself, would
[2:19:51] Jesus do that or would Jesus be here?
[2:19:57] And sometimes I think, no, probably not.
[2:20:01] And I feel bad about that.
[2:20:04] But you don't give up.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You don't give up.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Because you see what there is. I was in
[2:20:11] Vancouver. Happened to be in Vancouver
[2:20:13] on on yesterday. Yesterday
[2:20:17] I worked down there, friends.
[2:20:20] In 40 years,
[2:20:22] in less than 40 years,
[2:20:25] it's turned into hell.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; Hell is on the streets.
[2:20:31] is just so vile.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; The whole atmosphere is so vile. You
[2:20:36] think it's going to get better?
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; No, it's not going to get better.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; What am I saying? We are still here.
[2:20:43] We're here for a purpose.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; And that you people and the believers of
[2:20:48] this message is the evidence of Calvary.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; What a privilege we've been called to
[2:20:59] live out the sacrifice
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; of Calvary.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; We beheld his glory as the glory of the
[2:21:14] only begotten of the father full of
[2:21:16] grace and truth.
[2:21:19] Let's just bow our heads.
[2:21:24] Father, I want to thank you. I ask you
[2:21:27] to hear me as I express myself. I'm
[2:21:31] thankful for this opportunity to
[2:21:34] unbburden my heart and speak things that
[2:21:37] you've been speaking to me. and perhaps
[2:21:39] things that I do not fully understand,
[2:21:42] but you understand
[2:21:44] to a congregation that have been so
[2:21:46] attentive and so respectful and I've
[2:21:49] held them, oh God, till I feel this
[2:21:52] burden lifting. But I know from the
[2:21:55] witness that you put in my heart and I
[2:21:58] know there's many visitors here. I've
[2:22:00] been told this morning many are visiting
[2:22:03] and perhaps perhaps they're not just
[2:22:05] visiting. Perhaps it's been your
[2:22:07] appointment that they should hear what
[2:22:11] has been spoken
[2:22:13] because perhaps, oh God, you have been
[2:22:15] seeking to have them hear your voice and
[2:22:19] and those of this congregation who come
[2:22:21] here, Lord, and we know very well. But
[2:22:25] there are those, no doubt, that you're
[2:22:27] speaking to right now. And if they will
[2:22:29] just listen, there's a still small voice
[2:22:32] saying, "This is for you. This is this
[2:22:35] is a moment for you. I'm talking to you.
[2:22:38] I'm speaking to you. And they hear that
[2:22:41] little they hear that little sound of
[2:22:45] the chain of God's love wanting to take
[2:22:49] them out from the situation they're in.
[2:22:53] Oh God, I'm going to ask just while I'm
[2:22:56] praying,
[2:22:58] are there some that want to stand and
[2:23:00] want to be identified in this prayer?
[2:23:05] I'll give you a moment.
[2:23:19] Father, I do not know what it is you are
[2:23:22] speaking.
[2:23:24] I do not know the heart conversation
[2:23:27] that's going on from the heart of God to
[2:23:30] the heart to your people. But you are
[2:23:32] looking upon the heart. You even said in
[2:23:35] your word, you spoke to Samuel and you
[2:23:38] said that you look upon the heart. Man
[2:23:41] looks on the outward, but you look upon
[2:23:43] the heart. God, you're looking upon the
[2:23:46] heart of your people, both seated and
[2:23:49] standing. And those that are standing
[2:23:51] are giving evidence to something that
[2:23:54] they are giving evidence. And I've heard
[2:23:56] the voice. I've heard this still small
[2:23:59] voice. And now I want to I want to take
[2:24:02] another step. I want to make a
[2:24:04] declaration that I I am moving forward.
[2:24:08] I perhaps I have not attained and I have
[2:24:10] not apprehended it but I I will move
[2:24:13] forward and I press on. I press toward
[2:24:16] the mark of the high calling in Christ
[2:24:18] Jesus. Father come by the Holy Spirit I
[2:24:21] pray in the quietness of this moment oh
[2:24:24] God in the solemnity of this moment and
[2:24:28] Father let them each one in their own
[2:24:31] way make their own declaration as your
[2:24:34] prophet messenger said as he made the
[2:24:37] the declaration. I believe it and I
[2:24:40] accept it in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:24:43] and for the glory for his glory and his
[2:24:46] glory alone
[2:24:48] I commit them to you now. Amen. Let
[2:24:52] everyone stand please.
[2:24:57] Let the uh
[2:25:00] voice of the shackled in the of time.
[2:25:04] Yeah.
[2:25:07] What was the name of that?
[2:25:09] Worthy. I'd like to have you sing
[2:25:12] worthy. Worthy before we offer prayer
[2:25:15] and closing.
[2:25:18] [Music]
[2:25:25] [Applause]
[2:25:26] [Music]
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Lift it up now.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; There's no
[2:25:38] See the tears
[2:25:41] falls the broken,
[2:25:44] the cries
[2:25:46] of the slaves.
[2:25:48] Is there no one
[2:25:52] worthy to set us free? Listen now. Then
[2:25:58] the crying
[2:26:01] is still
[2:26:03] as the chorus
[2:26:06] rings out.
[2:26:08] The shackle
[2:26:11] released from their chain.
[2:26:17] And thousands
[2:26:20] of voices
[2:26:22] are swelling
[2:26:24] the song
[2:26:26] be worthy.
[2:26:29] The lamb that was
[2:26:36] worthy.
[2:26:38] [Music]
[2:26:40] He's worthy.
[2:26:43] So worthy.
[2:26:46] Worthy.
[2:26:47] The lamb
[2:26:49] that was slain.
[2:26:56] [Music]
[2:27:06] [Music]
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Want to sing that first verse once
[2:27:11] again. You
[2:27:14] on the shackle. Thank you for your soul.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Be thankful for him.
[2:27:22] [Music]
[2:27:25] There's no
[2:27:28] [Music]
[2:27:31] tears
[2:27:33] broken
[2:27:35] and the cries
[2:27:37] all the way.
[2:27:39] Is there no one
[2:27:42] worthy set free?
[2:27:47] But then the cry
[2:27:53] as the chorus
[2:27:56] like your voice is lifted out
[2:28:01] from the tree.
[2:28:05] Hallelujah.
[2:28:10] [Music]
[2:28:13] the song.
[2:28:15] [Music]
[2:28:25] Worthy.
[2:28:28] So worthy.
[2:28:31] Worthy.
[2:28:33] Worthy.
[2:28:37] That was sweet.
[2:28:42] He's worthy.
[2:28:46] So worthy,
[2:28:49] worthy,
[2:28:51] worthy.
[2:28:53] The lamb
[2:28:55] that was slain.
[2:28:59] And all the archangels
[2:29:03] [Music]
[2:29:05] all
[2:29:07] time
[2:29:10] their
[2:29:16] [Music]
[2:29:17] fall
[2:29:19] before
[2:29:22] joining
[2:29:24] the Oh
[2:29:25] [Music]
[2:29:28] my
[2:29:43] [Music]
[2:29:52] Worthy,
[2:29:59] worthy,
[2:30:01] worthy.
[2:30:03] The lamb
[2:30:05] that was slain.
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing that chorus, that verse.
[2:30:10] I love him.
[2:30:13] Love him.
[2:30:17] I love him.
[2:30:20] Love him.
[2:30:26] That was slain.
[2:30:31] I love him.
[2:30:36] I love him.
[2:30:41] I love
[2:30:44] the lamb
[2:30:46] that was slain.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; We'll just bow in prayer.
[2:30:53] Oh God,
[2:30:56] almighty one,
[2:31:00] how worthy you are. There's none like
[2:31:03] you.
[2:31:05] You took our place
[2:31:07] and you've come, Lord,
[2:31:10] this morning. This morning you are
[2:31:13] speaking.
[2:31:15] We that have heard the shout, there are
[2:31:18] some that are sleeping to hear the
[2:31:19] voice. And we are in tune to the
[2:31:22] trumpet.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; We are in tune to these sounds. We're
[2:31:27] acquainted with this voice. Thank you,
[2:31:30] Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[2:31:33] pray that you will take this
[2:31:35] congregation.
[2:31:36] Bind your arms around them.
[2:31:39] Unstop any ears that may be closed and
[2:31:42] may they hear. We want to hear you,
[2:31:45] Lord. We are just saying, "Speak, Lord,
[2:31:47] and we will hear. Speak, Lord, and I
[2:31:49] will answer. Speak, Lord. We're ready to
[2:31:53] hear your voice." I ask you, oh God, as
[2:31:56] you embrace this congregation of people
[2:31:58] and that your voice may be heard long
[2:32:00] after they've left this building. Let
[2:32:03] the voice sound within them. Oh God,
[2:32:08] almost an imperceptible
[2:32:11] response, Father. Let it be a willing
[2:32:14] response and ready response. Yes, Lord.
[2:32:18] Speak on. Speak on. Oh God, how glorious
[2:32:22] is your voice. How wonderful it is to
[2:32:24] hear it. Thank you for ever calling us,
[2:32:27] Lord. I pray that you'll dismiss us from
[2:32:30] this place, but not from your presence.
[2:32:34] Bless every person, every visitor in our
[2:32:37] midst, all that are streaming wherever
[2:32:39] they might be in the world. Bless, I
[2:32:42] pray, oh God, those that are away. There
[2:32:43] are a good number of our people still on
[2:32:46] vacation. I pray that you will present
[2:32:48] yourself in their room and perhaps
[2:32:50] they're even streaming at this time. Oh
[2:32:53] God, oh God, we want to be with you so
[2:32:58] much. There such a desire in our heart
[2:33:00] to be with you, to cross over. We yearn
[2:33:03] for that rapture moment. We yearn for
[2:33:05] the change of these bodies, oh God, the
[2:33:08] promise of God. We pray that you will
[2:33:11] bless the people as we anchor our faith
[2:33:13] in the spoken word of God. And that
[2:33:16] spoken word will give us faith, more
[2:33:18] faith. Dismiss us now with your glory
[2:33:22] and your fullness, the fullness of joy
[2:33:25] and satisfaction. I pray and I'm asking,
[2:33:28] Father, that you will cause this word to
[2:33:31] linger on in the ears and the hearts of
[2:33:33] the people. I thank you for their kind
[2:33:36] attention in Jesus Christ's name's
[2:33:39] blessing upon them we pray. Amen. Amen.
[2:33:43] God bless you.
[2:33:46] Why don't you turn around, shake hands
[2:33:47] with some that are near. Sister Clemens,
[2:33:50] it's nice to see you. I heard you've
[2:33:52] been very sick.
[2:33:54] Amen. He said you're sick and you said
[2:33:58] I'm healed. Amen. God bless you, sister.
[2:34:03] You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:34:06] Bless you. Bless you, brother John.
[2:34:08] Bless you.
