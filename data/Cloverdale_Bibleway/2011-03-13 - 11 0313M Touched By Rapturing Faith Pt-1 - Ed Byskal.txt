[Music] With that chorus on our hearts this morning, it's Brother Ken Andes to come and lead us in prayer this morning. Brother Ken, Sister Violet Laws wants to thank the Lord for touching her grandson Payton as he is out of the hospital. We give thanks for that. I understand that brother Wes Nygard is now home recovering. The Lord has touched him and been very faithful to our brother Wes. Thank you each one for your prayers and I know the Nikard family certainly does. Sister Jessica and the boys, God bless you. Want to remember brother Luis in Argentina as she's going to a meeting with the mayor in there in Argentina in regards to having a church built. They're asking that the Lord would allow them to find favor in their eyes. Also, there's a brother Jose. He's a believer in the area. He's had a five-month-old son that's uh was born premature and has not developed according to uh I believe his feet in his spine there's complications. So just asking that the Lord would touch the little one. Amen. Our God is faithful. Every bat of an atsai, every sparrow that would fall from the sky and those that were made in his likeness, he knows even more so. Amen. We want to remember uh brother H on behalf of brother Matthew Redell Carlos. I'm not going to challenge the last name. He's a Spanish-sp speakaking man. Uh Sister Marie spoke with yesterday very much in need of God. We committed him today to pray for him today. So we will do that. God bless those that were in Richmond yesterday. All those that prayed. The seeds have been sown. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's up to the Lord to bring the increase. Amen. Brother Andy's, if you have a need on your heart this morning, something you desire a touch from the Lord, why don't you just lift it up before him as we go to prayer. Let us pray. Our dear heavenly father, we count it a great privilege to be in your presence this morning and that you have joined yourself unto your elect at this place. We thank you, Lord, for these testimonies that's been read, the many victories that you have won. We've agreed with you. We've agreed with your word, and you have done wonderfully. We thank you for these healings and deliverances that's been read, friends and loved ones, the elect sinners that we've prayed for and even the effort la yesterday reaching out with a testimony in this community. We pray, heavenly father, that every word that was spoken by the young people and individuals of this church yesterday will bear into the conscience of each one that was spoken to. Every piece of literature that was given, Lord, we pray that it will find its place in the soil of a life and that the elect will continue to come to you. We believe heavenly father that you are very concerned of for your own work for what you intend to achieve and are doing on the earth today. We're thankful to be a part of that and we know that you will give increase to the word. Hallelujah. And father for the requests that were read. We pray that you'll go forth around the world where we have been praying for brother Louise. pray that you'll give him success for the kingdom of God, be able to achieve this uh property to build a church for you. And amidst all of the devastation around the earth because of the uh tidal waves, tsunami, earthquakes, disasters, protect your elect, Lord. &gt;&gt; Keep them safe in the midst of it all. May we go forward. May we see the advancement of the gospel of Jesus Christ in every community, every language, every nation around the world. Father, we ask for your anointing upon this service as so many have prayed for it. Ask your anointing upon our pastor as he delivers the words of life to us. Lord Jesus, meet our needs as families and individuals and out on the internet where this is going. May your perfect will be done. We commit ourselves to you for your glory and for your honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Why don't you turn around and shake hands with somebody this morning? Say, "God bless you. Welcome to the house of the Lord." Amen. You may have your seats. I want to welcome all those that are on the internet streaming hookup, the telephone hookup. Say God bless you to you as well. Sister Patricia, I've got a special this morning.

Just real happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; How many were able to go to the BCA? I'm going to do a Tim Dodd to you, so just be ready. How many were able to go to the BCA concert on on uh Friday evening? The rest of you, shame on you. I love that. That was really cute. Brother Tim did that to me. And I felt so convicted. I'm trying to go there. I really am. I'm I'm actually going to try and go there next month and drive in the cold all the way up to Grand Prairie from that one comment two years ago, probably. So it was a really really wonderful time we had with the the the uh school and the they've come a really long ways and their the talents that have been cultivated in the children. So we also want to remind those that can volunteer to help with the school building project to continue your efforts and those that can labor with helping to provide the meals for the brothers that are working there. I can honestly tell you that it's a privilege and it's a blessing to feed those that are building the building. We're all an integral part of the body. We're going to have a baptismal service this evening. So, if the Lord's been dealing with your heart and you haven't taken that step, how many can confess that that step is the next step? &gt;&gt; That's the next step.

Let your people become an enlightened people. May the scales fall off of the eyes of those that still have scales on them. May the hearts that are be t made tender, oh God, &gt;&gt; make us pliable and flexible and yielding. &gt;&gt; May everyone yield to the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus Christ. and all those that are streaming at this time, that congregation of people, oh God, may your Holy Spirit sweep in amongst them, &gt;&gt; and do the supernatural things, oh God, &gt;&gt; in Jesus name, for his glory alone. Anoint now your word, Lord, &gt;&gt; the speaker, the hearers, in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just so good to be in the house of God and hear the young people sing. Sister Jenny, that was wonderful. The school, those that play and whatever more. Uh you have to fill up the rest of these places. So work diligently &gt;&gt; and learn to yield to the Holy Spirit and play for the glory of God and sing for the glory of God. You don't have to be, you know, professional. You just have to be yielded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless all the men that worked and labored. You know, we say the school the school. I want to say you'll be there. You'll you'll benefit from the place. We'll be able to have our meetings which we haven't been able to. There's sometimes we have gatherings that gatherings of fellowship. We don't have room in the fellowship room and we've been I've been really desiring that they get over they call it the gymnasium for me. It's going to be a place where the saints can gather and we will use it for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I pray that your children will be taught. I will want to say that I and my wife uh we don't have children that are in school. We don't have grandchildren that are in school. But I'm very very committed to the school to the teachers because I don't know another place that has such devoted Holy Ghost messagebelieving teachers that will teach and instruct the children. And can you believe that your children do not have to hear cursing &gt;&gt; and the Lord's name in vain? I I had to go to that kind of a school and many of you have but if we don't have to and this is being provided I think we should make every use of it &gt;&gt; and if you say well I can't afford it get another job it's more important for that your children would be able to have that kind of an atmosphere than even for your daily food it's more important because they're taking those things in and the schools today friends don't mind saying it this is public, but they're corrupt places. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; A principal right over here at a school within a mile of this church told my wife, he said, "I don't have time to be a principal." He said, "I am a counselor." He said, "There's such trouble amongst the children." He said, "I have a boy and we are in we're in some final exams." And he says, "I have a young man at probably 14, 15 years old. He's been sleeping in his car for 3 weeks because of the trouble that they're having in their home. And he said, "And he's supposed to be here and study and have exams." He said, "You know, can you imagine? Our homes aren't like that. &gt;&gt; This church message believers are not like that. And we're not just good families. That's not it. It's what we believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This morning, I'd like to just prepare you for the message before we read. Some have been saying, "What's happening? Something is happening." I hear that phrase frequently. Well, if you listen real close this morning, I think that you'll I pray I really pray that you'll be able to grasp a little bit of what's happening. And uh I just uh I I don't want to feel like I'm I don't want you to feel or think that I'm reaching way out into uh no man's land, but I want to take some things out of the out of the message. You know, the message really is somewhat mystical and uh and and I want to continue on. I started with who touched me and who touched me part two and uh the second time we touched on that or spoke on that subject I I really felt something different happening with myself and uh and I think many here perhaps have felt so and so I want to make statements today probably not preach the way I would normally preach but I would like you to take and ponder those statements and if something uh something really speaks to you, jot it down. That's fine. Uh quite a few asked for the notes and the slides that I had and we had them copied and those of you that had wanted them, we've given them to you. And we're going to read out of the Bible in just a moment out of Romans, out of the book of Romans. And then keep your Bibles handy for I have quite a lengthy reading in just a few moments. But while you're turning, can I give you a testimony that came uh a brother wrote us uh on the through the ad admin office uh on the website and to pray for his his sister and she had a a growth uh tumor and a and a and cancer and was bleeding. And here I received this on the 10th of March. This is the 13th, so three days ago. Dear Pastor Ed, I would like to give you some feedback on the prayer request below. My sister Lavina went for more tests last week and the doctors were confused. Number one, the mass was disappearing. Number two, there was no more traces of cancer. &gt;&gt; Number three, the bleeding has stopped now for over a week. Number four, her blood pressure, which was which constantly sat at about 200 over 140, is now down to just 140 over 80. &gt;&gt; All of this has happened without medication or any form of treatment being administered. Thank you for your prayers and may God bless you and all that is dear to you. Uh and he signed it. I say glory be to God. People say what is happening. There are things happening and I I attribute that to this brother's faith. I believe that God saw his faith and I just said God all the glory be to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Things are happening just over the over the streaming friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This brother's probably streaming right now. And I say, "God bless you, brother Kalin." Hallelujah. God bless anybody has a faith to raise their hand. It takes faith to walk down the aisle. It takes faith &gt;&gt; to believe the word of God. It takes faith. &gt;&gt; We serve a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We thank you, Lord. Romans the 10th chapter, starting at verse 14. God bless you, brother Matthew Redell, and all the group that went out witnessing. That's just wonderful. You sent pictures, but my Blackberry said it's trunciated, which I assume that big word means there's too much to get on there, but we'll see them on our uh on our computer when we get home. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him in whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? &gt;&gt; And how shall they preach except they be sent? &gt;&gt; As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things. &gt;&gt; But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report, so then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just have your seats quietly, and hold your Bibles open if you would, please. And we'll just keep as focused as possible. Ask God to just give you a special revelation. So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Or I shall say, or how or how and what shall they preach if the book is still sealed with mysteries? Right. &gt;&gt; Faith for the rapture can only come by the preaching of those divinely revealed mystery truths. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A phrase which brother Brandham gave to it. &gt;&gt; Faith for the rapture can only come by those divinely revealed mystery truths made known in this hour in the opening of the sealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Many have claimed to have opened the seals, &gt;&gt; but no one has opened the seals but the lamb himself. &gt;&gt; And and he had to have a validated voice &gt;&gt; and messenger and vessel on the earth. And as the prophet said, all the other church age messengers could be reformers, but the last one had to be prophet. &gt;&gt; There can be because he he's the only one. He's born that way so that God can bypass his mental faculties and speak thus sayith the Lord &gt;&gt; in a leady church age. He speaks to the messenger identifying the messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 tying the two together &gt;&gt; is going to do two things. Number one, according to Malachi, he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. &gt;&gt; Now, if you are those people, then your hearts have been turned back to the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; And number two, he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10. Notice now closely the seven thunders which are the revelations contained in the seven seals. So the seven thunders aren't some mysterious thing that builds some special group of people. It has nothing to do with that. It's accessible to every believer. The seven thunders are the voices or the mysteries. And all you have to do is remember two words. It was sealed. Those things were sealed with with a seal and the mystery was the seal as long as it remained a mystery that kept it sealed. But as soon as God would send a his his messenger and and and make known the mystery, then it became a thunder because it was a voice. That's so simple any child can understand that. So it was sealed with a mystery and revealed in the thunder or revealed. He said, "Let's the thunder is a symbol. Let's find out what the thunder is." And he goes back into John's gospel where a voice said, "This is my beloved son." A voice spake. Uh, I have glorified it and we'll glorify it again. And some thought it thundered. Brother Brandham said, "That's the symbol. It's a voice of God." And when a prophet speaks, it's a voice of God. So those were the seven thunders which was revealing the seven seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; Simple, isn't it? &gt;&gt; And glorious, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, he will do those two things. Now, &gt;&gt; at the time of the resurrection, I'm getting into some swimming water here, and I pray that the Holy Spirit will take you and give you some of the things that I've been experiencing at the time of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Just so everyone is settled, you need to get these. At the time of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the virginborn son of God, Jesus stays with the little group of believers &gt;&gt; at the time of the resurrection. He stays with the little group of believers and guides them through the event &gt;&gt; of the resurrection &gt;&gt; until they understand what has taken place. &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus didn't always do that, but at the resurrection, at the time of the resurrection in Luke 24, he stays with the little group of believers until they understand what has taken place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in our day, God raised up a redeemed son. &gt;&gt; Not a virgin-born son, but a redeemed son &gt;&gt; and he was redeemed by the virginborn son &gt;&gt; as we all have. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he raised up he raises up his vessels and he raised up a redeemed son by the virginborn son and through a life of sorrows brought him to adoption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That through him Jesus Christ would reveal himself again fulfilling Luke 17:30. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the true Easter seal, the prophet says, "And if he can reveal to me by his holy spirit," speaking to a woman, now that woman could be any woman here or any person here, speaking to her, he said, "By the Holy Spirit, the resurrected Christ who come here and give me a temporarily resurrection &gt;&gt; by my spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. that my spirit goes away now &gt;&gt; and his spirit comes in &gt;&gt; then to let you know whether he's alive or not. &gt;&gt; That's why he comes in into that level of ministry to let the individual who is needing who's touching him to let her know that he's alive and present there right at that moment. &gt;&gt; He says I don't know you and that's me and my spirit. me and my spirit. We don't know you. He said, those are his words. But he knows you and he wants to borrow my body &gt;&gt; to prove that he's the resurrected Christ &gt;&gt; and I'm so happy to loan it to him to give it to him anything he can get out of it. &gt;&gt; And so we find that there's a a a level of something that was taking place having a temporarily resurrection. And he talks about through the church ages that the church has been given a temporary resurrection. Temporary resurrection through the church ages. Temporary. But you and I are to come to the fullness of the word. When the book is open and the mysteries of God are being declared and are being preached, then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Now the reason why you have a son a virginborn son and at a certain time and the it is written he knew exactly where it would be written that's Jesus Christ of Nazareth now he's resurrected and he is with his believers uh now there are there are difference of prophecies there are some prophecies which took uh maybe years or centuries or days to come to fulfillment and the prophecies concerning the life of and death of Jesus Christ uh was over a period of even hundreds of years but the fulfillment happened in a relatively short time. And then Jesus spoke to his disciples and said that he would be slain and killed of the leaders and would rise up the third day. He said it very very clearly. They couldn't grasp it. And now the third day and they're even telling this stranger and now is the third day already. And so they had absorbed some things but could not put it together. And now in the revealing of the son of man in our time in your day, God allowed things to be uh spoken and written for a people. Now, the reason why it even went on tape and the voice went on tape is that there was going to be a people coming up that needed to hear that voice &gt;&gt; and those people would produce it or publish it and send it all through the world. And I'm so glad today that I can say to you if I was to tell you friends what was happening. We call it the message hub. Just forget that. I I call it this morning a voice from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. a voice from heaven. &gt;&gt; And there's been no vindicated voice like that in the entire New Testament period. And since Adam set foot and walked on earth, there has been no time when science has been able to put a prophet's voice in the heavens. &gt;&gt; Now all prophets voices went into the heavens. Your voice goes out. It's recorded forever. Listen friends. Now you have come to a season. You've come to a season you put some earbuds in your ears and pick up things and but now this time we're receiving a voice that's accessible by almost anybody from from heaven. &gt;&gt; And that's the first time that voice has been accessible from heaven. &gt;&gt; A voice from heaven. &gt;&gt; Why would it come at this season? Because it must come. that kind of a voice has to come at this season and he goes and this prophet messenger goes to this very scripture Luke 20 Luke 24 and calls it a prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the reason why Jesus stayed with those disciples and stayed with that little group &gt;&gt; so it could be recorded in Luke 24. He stayed with them through that chapter and he said the prophet said unto you that's a prophecy and so Jesus back there when the prophecy was to be laid out &gt;&gt; that was a prophecy to be laid out to be fulfilled over here. And so when it was being laid out it it cannot it cannot be uh something that cannot be reconciled with the fulfillment. It has to be laid out exactly as it's going to be fulfilled. And so when it's being laid out, Jesus stayed with those disciples. He he often left people in bewilderment. They didn't understand. But he stayed with that little group till they understood what he was saying and furthermore what had happened. &gt;&gt; And that's why they had they they saw him and and then they couldn't understand and they didn't know who he was. as we'll be going through it because I want to speak to you uh kind of on the context that it's reading between the lines &gt;&gt; and reading between the lines is not getting a new doctrine. &gt;&gt; Reading between the lines calls for a relationship. Brother Brandham says when I'm overseas my wife reads sends me a letter says oh Billy I put the children to bed and and I gave Joseph a kiss for you and so on. He's reading between the lines and he sees a little teardrop on the piece of paper. And you cannot read between the lines without first having a relationship. It's not some mechanical thing. It's something from the heart. It's something from a love relationship. You have to enter into a love relationship. And I'm urging you this morning to come on into this love relationship. Don't sit here that this is a Sunday morning service and after a little while we're going to go home. It's not that kind of a meeting. It's a relationship service. The Holy Spirit is calling you into a relationship so that you can read between the lines of the prophecy. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he had to be very very specific. And Jesus was specific. And he stayed with the two on the way to Emmas and went to their house and broke bread till they understood that it was him. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And then they ran and we'll be getting into it later. They ran and to tell the others that he's risen and what the ladies what the women saw and and and uh and and what Peter and they had run to the tomb and so on. But they come to the apostles and then he enters the room. Now it looks like a spirit. Now put yourself there. &gt;&gt; Put yourself there. If that's a prophecy, some of you may well &gt;&gt; experience some things that you don't understand. It has to happen. &gt;&gt; Things can't go on like this forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you believe those are you're the that people, &gt;&gt; then it may well be you &gt;&gt; or me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophecy I I I just have to slow myself down. Prophecy is time sensitive. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember that prophecy is timesensitive. &gt;&gt; It can be read, &gt;&gt; studied, believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when it begins to be fulfilled, &gt;&gt; most often the ful most often the fulfillment passes by without the people know what's happening. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want you I don't have to tell you that you're privileged, but you're highly honored &gt;&gt; to even be able to hear these things that God has sent in this time. You're highly honored that the message ever came your way. &gt;&gt; None of us are worthy of it, friends. Not one of us are worthy of it. We're so honored that God chose you and let the message come by your way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, and this is in Matthew, and his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes, that Elias must first come. &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come and restore all things, but I say unto you, that Elias has come already. And they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise also shall the Son of Man suffer of them. So he's come already, but they knew it not. Then the disciples, then &gt;&gt; the disciples understood. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That he spake of John the Baptist &gt;&gt; and they've already seen John the Baptist and the whole thing has passed. &gt;&gt; But then they understood. Brother Brandham says, "And they didn't know who John was, who John the Baptist was until they beheaded him." &gt;&gt; The disciples didn't even know him. The disciples said, "Why does the scribe say that Elias must first come?" And Jesus said, "He's come already and you didn't know it." You see how it went right through &gt;&gt; and they can be in the midst. The people can be in the midst as it was in the resurrection. But the resurrection, friends, is a different kind of fulfillment. They were right in in their daily lives. &gt;&gt; Yes. the women Joseph of Arythea and perhaps I won't have time to read it all I wanted to but Joseph of Arythea was a rich man and and he also was a secret believer the Bible says he believed he was also a disciple of Jesus and he went to Pilate because he had that kind of a position he went to Pilate and he begged the Bible says the body of Jesus and he wrapped it in linen and placed it in his own new tomb, a human tomb wherein no man had ever laid. And he placed it. That's what he thought of the Lord. Now, that's just what he was doing. This was his tomb, and it was all just a very natural event. And then the women who had been uh just you women. They were just doing their natural things. We always bring spices. And now the day of preparation which is was Friday because then as soon as the Sabbath comes they can't do anything like that and so they made their preparation and then had to wait over the Sabbath and early on the first day of the week they didn't they didn't have any revelation well he has to raise on the first day of the week. This is a new beginning. This is a the first day of the week is the beginning &gt;&gt; is it? We're here &gt;&gt; on the first day of week. &gt;&gt; We're we're we're here because we're testifying to a resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's why we gather on the Lord's day. This is the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; And so they went there. Just natural. They went with their spices. They went to and there's angels and there's two men in shining garments. And we know who you seek. Jesus of Nazareth. He's not here. He's risen as he said. &gt;&gt; Right. and they look in and see the place where he laid and he's not there. Listen, friends, this is you. &gt;&gt; Read between the lines. &gt;&gt; You're going to experience some very, very &gt;&gt; unusual things. &gt;&gt; And Mary lingers behind and she sees a man. &gt;&gt; He looks like a gardener. So now this other dimension is something that's beyond our capacity to grasp entirely. But yet we should read between the lines. &gt;&gt; If a prophet said that this is a prophecy, I think that we should just conclude and put it across the page. This is a prophecy &gt;&gt; and a prophecy must be fulfilled. And if you believe that that was a virgin-born son that laid down the prophecy and then he sent an adopted redeemed son in a prophet's office to gather a group of people who believe that message and are committed to it. Then we ought to be able to grasp don't let this pass through us. [Music] in modern events, which is one of the last messages. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if I'd say this with respect, he says to all my brethren and sisters in Christ, one of these days somebody's going to say, "Isn't it written that these things should happen first?" And when I highlighted that, I prayed and said, "God, &gt;&gt; don't let me be speaking to anybody &gt;&gt; that's going to fulfill that prophecy." &gt;&gt; One of these days, somebody's going to say, &gt;&gt; "Don't let it be you. &gt;&gt; Don't let it be you, my brother, my sister. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to you. Look at me. &gt;&gt; Don't let it be you. that's been spoken by a prophet. &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to say it. &gt;&gt; Wasn't this to happen? &gt;&gt; We don't want to say that. We want to say, "I know it's happening. I know something's happening. I may not understand it, but I know it's happening. And I know that I'm called to be in it." [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to happen &gt;&gt; at some point in time. It's going to happen. And you say, "Well, what if it doesn't happen while I'm alive?" At least you must die in the faith. &gt;&gt; You must die believing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I cannot see how God would send this kind of a message and messenger at such a unique time. Having prophesied so many things, if I have time, I will give you some wording concerning what he said about earthquakes and the one in that will take place in California and particularly Los Angeles and where they've discovered faults that they didn't even know existed. And it's right under Hollywood. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Furthermore, the ocean will weep its way into the desert. &gt;&gt; Weep its way. It'll be a sorrowful time." And if you've seen the surreal pictures and clips of video and the news of the ocean weeping its way into Japan, &gt;&gt; there's one one one small city of 17,000 with 9,500 people still unaccounted for. And they're trying to search over the rubble. half of the population of a goodsized town and they're gone. As far as they know, they're gone. They can't find it. They haven't found a life. I will say you want to see coming up those valleys and uh and and uh the news reporter standing three miles from the ocean and there's the boats and there's the there's the trucks, great big highway trucks that carried it right from the ocean all the way in three miles. I don't know how far it went in. Brother Brandham says it'll weep its way into the salt and sea &gt;&gt; and you want to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And one in New Zealand and then with within a few months another one in New Zealand and then one here and one there and one off the coast of British Columbia, a small one. And then Japan is is constantly rumbling. And as a they interviewed the people from over there, they said, "Well, you get accustomed to this. Things are rattling all the time." But the prophet of God makes different declarations. He talks about the lava. He talks about, you know, that this earthquake knocked the earth off its axis by 10 cm and sped the spinning of the earth up momentarily because of it convuls. This this prophet talks about this. He's not talking scientific terms. He says the earth will convulse. It's the creator &gt;&gt; and the ocean will weep its way into the desert and people say well it'll be felt clean back to Tucson or or whatever more. Do you realize that when they largest earthquake which was a 9 point something in Anchorage which he prophesied judgment coming down the west coast prophesied that before it happened and it happens on Good Friday. Some of these things should mean something. &gt;&gt; And the water bounced in the wells in Florida, probably 5,000 miles away, 17 ft, &gt;&gt; convulsed. The earth convulsing like that. &gt;&gt; Two men were fishing on a pond and the earth when it convulsed just sucked up the water and found themselves in their boat sitting in the mud. Say, friends, &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to come down and draw us little pictures. &gt;&gt; He speaks through a voice. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "You either take it or just leave it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just take it or believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And believe it or just forget it. &gt;&gt; I don't want to play. It's all right. If you're just in some denomination, you want to go and listen to the band or the choir or whatever more. And I thank God for what we have. But that's not why we're here. We're not here to be entertained. And we're not here to catch some human spirit. I'm That's why I thought I'll preach different this morning. I want to just lay it out line by line, have you absorb it, and have you consider what is being said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. One of these days somebody's going to say, "Isn't it written that these things should happen first?" And it'll be the same way it was then. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he's already come and they they did what they listed to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when they asked him why the scribes say the scriptures say that Elias must first come, they said that they said that to Jesus and he said he's come already and you didn't know him. And that's perhaps the way it'll end up again. [Music] &gt;&gt; So he's drawing from that. He says, "And now I want to be posted. I want now he said we want to be posted to know what's to take place for this age that we live in. &gt;&gt; That is said for us. &gt;&gt; This is a lesson friends. I'm not up here just to preach up here to give also instruction that you will remember it. You learn in school and then you go out from school and apply it. You come here this morning and now when you go home, I pray that God will give you such a sense that you will apply this. &gt;&gt; Lord, make me sensitive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, don't let me look at the world the way I looked at it before. &gt;&gt; Don't let me look at my job the way I looked at it before. Let me keep my eyes heavenward. &gt;&gt; Let me be consumed with this whole thing that you're making real. Don't let me just say something's happening, but let me at least be clued in and know something is happening in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Luke 24 is a prophecy of our time. &gt;&gt; Modern events, he called it, modern events are made clear &gt;&gt; by the prophecy. &gt;&gt; So when you take it and if you have not and you young people, this is a lesson for you. lesson you can do this week. You take Luke 24 you and read it and then take uh modern events are made clear by the prophecy if you have not read it. I've been speaking out of it and perhaps we'll speak yet because I won't finish this morning but speak out of it again. And when you read it, don't read it like a book. read it and read between the lines &gt;&gt; and say, "What is my Lord Jesus seeking to convey? What's he trying to tell me?" &gt;&gt; Not trying to strive with it or trying to figure it out. But first, before you even read, enter into a relationship. I have I've gone to the back of the message books to to because I love when he was so tender and tell people and I've been speaking who touched me and tell people uh of their back ailment or tell them that they have a person on their heart and it's an unsaved son or tell them I can only look up and say oh God my Lord Jesus My redeemer, &gt;&gt; my lover, &gt;&gt; my healer, &gt;&gt; how you must love your children. I don't feel worthy of it, but you care for every little thing. But now what is touching and moving me is I desire and I've been speaking to you the last service hunger and yearning when there wasn't one that I can find in 30 years of min 33 years of ministry. I can't find one where the Lord Jesus spoke out of the messenger's mouth and said to them, "There's one thing that you crave above all others. You do have some physical things, but that's not really why you're here. You're here because you want to have a confirmation that you are one of the raptured saints. You're going to go in the rapture. You're hungering and yearning for the resurrection." &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, what's wrong with having that as a desire? I want to see the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I don't care if I have a pain in my knee or a pain in my back. That's not why I want to touch him. I want to touch him with such a strong feeling. I want to be in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I want to walk with the saints. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. What could possibly equal that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Larry, my wife, I often tried to get her to come and sit closer to the front. I'd like you to sit closer to the front. No, she said, "I I sit beside Sister Mary. and she's hard of hearing and I help her find the place in the Bible where we're reading and uh when we heard she was gone. She said I miss her. They didn't have a lot of conversation said, "I miss her." And furthermore, I'm waiting for a beautiful young woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To walk in &gt;&gt; and to sit down beside me. I fully I'm looking for that. You know what, friends? Whether that happens or somebody says, "Well, that's kind of foolish. They said that about Brother Brandham." &gt;&gt; And those people never got a thing. Right. &gt;&gt; But those that believed, &gt;&gt; whether they received anything or not is irrelevant &gt;&gt; because they were believing for the supernatural, they're believing for the eternal. We're believing for the heavenly. &gt;&gt; Whether you have a physical or an emotional or whatever kind of an ailment, that's not the thing this morning. What the thing has to be prominent in your mind. I'm going to be part of this resurrection and I'm going to think about it. I'm going to I'm going to ponder it. I'm going to I'm going to let my mind be captivated by it. It's going to be on my mind. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you get so heavenly good, so heavenly minded that you're no earthly good." I say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's try it out. &gt;&gt; We've been so earthly minded sometimes for no heavenly good. Let's be so heavenly minded for no earthly good. One of the outstanding aspects of this prophecy, Luke 20, Luke 24, is that those who were ordained &gt;&gt; to be part of it, &gt;&gt; were passing right through it without recognizing it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Except for the extra measure &gt;&gt; of the personal presence of Jesus Christ with them. However, this must not happen. It could not happen back then. They could not miss it. It could not pass through them without them knowing because these disciples were chosen to reflect those chosen in the end time to be the fulfillment of this prophecy. &gt;&gt; So, they had to go. They had to move. That's why he stayed with them. It it is as though his actions were his actions the actions of Jesus was I'm staying with you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to continue with you. &gt;&gt; Now let me read between the lines. The Bible says and Jesus himself drew near &gt;&gt; in the prophecy in this day he raised up a prophet sir. So Jesus himself &gt;&gt; could draw near to a group of people. &gt;&gt; So now we've got that far. &gt;&gt; Jesus himself. And then the Bible says, "And he went with them." &gt;&gt; They had some journey in the prophecy and you have some journey between the lines in the fulfillment. And he has gone with you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He went with them. &gt;&gt; Not so they could go to church, not so they could have another miracle, not so they could feed the uh feed 5,000. That wasn't it. That was over. &gt;&gt; He went with them so that they could not miss who he was &gt;&gt; and what had happened. &gt;&gt; And he was in another dimension. &gt;&gt; He was in another dimension. back then in the prophecy and he was in another dimension here again. &gt;&gt; There was a prophecy &gt;&gt; but he went with them. &gt;&gt; He has gone with you. &gt;&gt; And they continued to be sad and confused and reasoning between themselves. And we have done exactly the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; They continued to talk about the things that had happened. They were talking about the Pharisees and talking about uh the misjudgment they made on and talking about how he was crucified and talking about their hopes and and their ambition. We thought there's going to be a rapture. We thought there's going to be a resurrection. We thought he was going to deliver Israel. They had to fix their mind. We thought we're going to be free from Rome. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That wasn't it. And he's he he wants them to move through and make the prophecy accurate. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be another people rise up at another time when this when I'm going to be revealed again. And this people are going to live it out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They've got to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he stayed with them and listened to them. [Music] &gt;&gt; We thought there's going to be a resurrection. We thought there's going to be we thought there's going to be a great revival. And he just goes along with them and walks with them. &gt;&gt; And he's and he came right in this generation from another dimension, the same one. &gt;&gt; And the prophet saying year after year after year, he's here, he's here, he's here, he's here. How many times does he need to say it? [Applause] &gt;&gt; That same one is here this morning. &gt;&gt; He's indeed here. &gt;&gt; He's heard your conversation. &gt;&gt; He's listened to all of the hopes and aspirations and and disappointments. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's listened to it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they didn't have they weren't clued in. &gt;&gt; They didn't have their priorities right &gt;&gt; and they continued to walk till they got to their place. He went with them. &gt;&gt; He walked right to their house. &gt;&gt; We're reading between the lines. He walked right to your house. &gt;&gt; He listened to you all the time. &gt;&gt; Yes. In the previous ministry, he healed their sick. &gt;&gt; He healed Peter's mother-in-law from the fever. He touched her &gt;&gt; and the fever left. &gt;&gt; He has done all these things. He done these things we give these testimonies for. He's done all of that. But this is a little different era. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't forget it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If this is my last service, don't forget it. &gt;&gt; This is a different time. &gt;&gt; The things we allowed in the past and occupied our minds with, let it disappear. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean anything &gt;&gt; in relationship. Go ahead, go to school, get your education, go to work, pay your bills. That's not why you're here. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And so he goes to their house. It's supper time. He goes in. He'll sit down. He'll be a guest. He knows they still don't know. &gt;&gt; They still don't know. &gt;&gt; I'm in their house. They still don't know. And the Bible says these men, they said, "And the women that are in our church, the women from our group, &gt;&gt; they heard they went to the tomb, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they went to the sephilic and saw the angels and whatever these people, and him they saw not." &gt;&gt; That's right. And these two men are looking at him. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "Then &gt;&gt; then, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; he begin to expound &gt;&gt; unto them out of the scripture. It was as though he had had enough. &gt;&gt; I heard all about your whimpering. I heard all about your sadness. I heard all about your disappointments. I heard all about your spiritual expectation that apparently didn't happen. And here they were right in the resurrection. They're in the greatest moment of history. &gt;&gt; You talk about being thick, friends, no wonder he said, "Oh fools &gt;&gt; and slow to believe all the prophets have spoken." &gt;&gt; And I say to this waiting congregation, let us not be foolish and forget what has been spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they said that they didn't see him, they were looking for him. And him they saw not &gt;&gt; and they were looking at him. &gt;&gt; And it was though he couldn't hold his peace any longer. He said, "Then &gt;&gt; he began to expound out of the scriptures all the things that were written concerning himself." And beginning at Moses, beginning back in 1947, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; and beginning back in 48, &gt;&gt; and he begin to expound on the things that he has done in this generation once again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And he told him about the first pull and told him about the second pull and told them and it was the same one all the time. [Music] &gt;&gt; But this is a different time, friends. Listen to me. &gt;&gt; You're in a You're in a resurrection &gt;&gt; era [Applause] &gt;&gt; The resurrection is our time. &gt;&gt; Those that saw and spoke with Jesus after the resurrection did not immediately understand what was taking place. Amen. &gt;&gt; And certainly did not know that they were in the middle of and a part of the greatest event in history to that time. &gt;&gt; For the graves were opened, Matthew records. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And many bodies of the saints which slept arose. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. While they're walking in their sadness, &gt;&gt; paradise has already been emptied. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think of the event, friends. &gt;&gt; Think of the event. And surely the Lord Jesus Christ was declaring they must not miss this because they are part of a prophecy &gt;&gt; and there's going to come a people that's going to fulfill it. [Applause] There's going to come a people &gt;&gt; that I'm going to draw to myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In a love relationship &gt;&gt; and I will not just be redeemer but I will be their bridegroom. &gt;&gt; And then I will take them as husband &gt;&gt; and I will pregnantate them with my own seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they will begin to understand &gt;&gt; what it is that's taking place. And we will enter into such a deep intimate relationship. &gt;&gt; And then I will whisper my secrets to her &gt;&gt; and she will not just come to church, but she will enter into a relationship with me. &gt;&gt; And I will gather her to myself. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my dove. Thou art in the cliff of the rock, in the secret place of the stairs that the that David spoke about in Psalms 27 that the prophet of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, taking him in this day, leading him to Psalms 27 &gt;&gt; in the secret of his tabernacle. And in the stairs speaks of it and it is here in this relationship in the secret places of the stairs. Let me see thy countenance. &gt;&gt; She is saying the bride is saying let me see your countenance. &gt;&gt; Let me hear your voice for sweet is thy voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to hear is not only to listen and obey, but with attention and with interest. &gt;&gt; And when I'm speaking to you this morning, you're being very attentive. &gt;&gt; And I want you to listen with keen interest &gt;&gt; because I feel I feel very unusually directed and I have been thinking about crossing over myself. You might say, "Oh, well, yeah, you're you're up in years and you're old and you can expect that there's going to be young people like you, young fellas sitting here that's going to go into the rapture, into the resurrection, and just one breath away, you're 21, and I'm 21. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Mary saw his beaten, brutalized body. &gt;&gt; She saw the crown of thorns. &gt;&gt; She saw the bleeding and the blood and and something so gory it would be hard for a person to take in. She viewed all of that &gt;&gt; and she saw him three days later standing in the same garden and he looked like a young man &gt;&gt; that was a gardener &gt;&gt; and he had so changed that she couldn't tell from his appearance it was the same one. She was only a few hours away from that experience. &gt;&gt; She saw him gasping for She saw him die. That's right. &gt;&gt; She saw him carried to the tomb. &gt;&gt; How can you turn it around so quick? That's the prophecy. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I want to ask this congregation, who's the fulfillment? Who's the fulfillment? [Applause] &gt;&gt; We ought to say a sea of hands. &gt;&gt; I'm the fulfillment. It must be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; I am here as a part of the fulfillment. &gt;&gt; God honor your hands. God honor the heart of faith. [Music] &gt;&gt; And if you're not certain, &gt;&gt; don't leave these doors till you know &gt;&gt; you're part of it. You think people aren't being warned? They were warned in Japan. &gt;&gt; Buildings were trembling and they were warned and they got one strong one and generally they get weaker but it got stronger. The next one was stronger and then came 8.9. They're expecting him to go less and less. It doesn't go according to people's expectations. &gt;&gt; Almighty God, creator of heavens and earth, he allowed happen whatever happened. &gt;&gt; But there will be a day &gt;&gt; and the prophet said that the earth will burst open &gt;&gt; and the lava will flow &gt;&gt; and Los Angeles will sink. California will slide into the ocean. &gt;&gt; Many of you were younger when Dr. Dr. Joseph Dr. uh Jacobs stood here and described the earth's crust and he is a he is a a professor University of Madras on the earth's crust and he described the actual formation of the crust under the city of Los Angeles and said that there's a and now perhaps I did I just say this a few days ago and there's a a segment he said the best he could describe it he gave it his technical term but he said the best way to describe desri the substance that is under California is it is like a graphite it's very very smooth and slick and he said that's a part of the earth's formation and then it comes to the like solid rock and whatever and he said when that earthquake comes he said that can only slide into the ocean the language he said brother Brandham used is precisely correct it not because the science was proving it but because God almighty knew it was that way and he who created all things. He caused and he's the one who spoke. Thus sayith the Lord, the city of the angels that call yourself the city of angels shall go down and be buried in the depths as Capernium was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we say, well, will we be here when it happens or won't we be here? That's irrelevant. &gt;&gt; You can be right in the middle. I mean, give me the Arctic, give me the mosquitoes, give me Vancouver, or give me any place. Give me Saskatchewan or the Midwest, but don't give me where a prophet of God has said that's what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; But even that, I don't move around cuz I'm scared or filled with fear. God has put us here. We're here for a witness and we'll be a witness until we're taken in a rapture. &gt;&gt; But we shall be taken in the rapture. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to you, I'll meet you in the rapture. &gt;&gt; You ready to sing, Brother Kim? &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I'll meet you in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said your voice. Let me hear your voice. We have &gt;&gt; maybe you just heard brother Brandham's voice. I tell you as your brother and whatever I am to you, I heard his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even every time. And that's why it touches me when he says there's a sister and she's sitting right here on the edge in one place. And he says he talks about the vindication being such proof. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think the people were having a time believing in that service and it was in Phoenix and he said to my left is a woman and she's scared. She's afraid that she's got cancer. Now what has happened? How can he say that? because somebody is touching &gt;&gt; the high priest &gt;&gt; and the feeling of her infirmities has touched him &gt;&gt; and I've been preaching to you now this is my second week let your craving and hunger and desperation &gt;&gt; I cannot miss the resurrection &gt;&gt; either I will be resurrected if I die I will go in the faith, &gt;&gt; but I will be holding it in front of me. And the only thing I want to do is to touch him &gt;&gt; so that he will be able to reaffirm and confirm back to me. What you want is is to be in the rapture. What you want is a change of this body. What you want, what you crave above all things &gt;&gt; is to be cut away. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's very shook up about it. I hope she don't miss it. And I hope no one misses it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen friends, I said this would be a different service. If you miss it, you will not be able to lay brother Biscll to blame. &gt;&gt; I'm saying it clearer than I could ever say it. Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; She had already touched. She had already reached through. She had already touched the high priest. Yes. &gt;&gt; Was already identifying her &gt;&gt; and telling her that what her fear was and what she was scared of. And he said, "The lady's name is Mrs. Bach." And he said, "And a lady by the name of Mrs. Hershey, don't forget God came to prove that son innocent. She was concerned about her son and the guilt of her son." and says that God came to prove that son innocent if you'll believe with all your heart. A lady sitting over here into the side of my right suffering with heart trouble. Mrs. Cloud, a lady way back to my right, right hand row, dark dress on. Mrs. Yates, believe with all your heart. Mrs. Cloud, Mrs. Hershey, Mrs. Yates, one after the other. How could they miss it? How could anybody miss it? He called your name. &gt;&gt; When that's something that struck you and spoke you. There wasn't a man. &gt;&gt; There wasn't a there wasn't brother Tom or &gt;&gt; Brother Diggs or Brother John, &gt;&gt; Brother Ken Andes, Brother Villanova, or myself. &gt;&gt; When that something is coming there to you personally, that is him calling your name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it didn't even give us a a a record of it. And now he said in power of God faith cometh by hearing but hearing but hearing is not faith. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing but hearing is not faith. He said a loaf of bread is purchased for 25 cents as way back then. But 25 cents is not the loaf of bread. &gt;&gt; It's only the thing to get you there. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing. How could we hear if the book was still sealed? &gt;&gt; How could we hear a sealed book? &gt;&gt; The mysteries of God, &gt;&gt; the Godhead. You didn't understand the Godhead till the message came. &gt;&gt; You didn't understand the tribulation. You didn't understand the theophony. Who spoke about the theophony? How many here went to another church before you came to the message? Raise your hand. A lot of you didn't go to any church. Did you ever hear of any theophies &gt;&gt; about the theophony? Raise your hand. &gt;&gt; You heard it in the church. &gt;&gt; You heard it in the church because you're Greek. That's part of the reason. &gt;&gt; We didn't hear the theophonyy's right beside us. &gt;&gt; We didn't hear it's one breath away. &gt;&gt; We didn't hear it's our word body. We didn't hear we're going to go to it. &gt;&gt; And that is why when Jesus was resurrected, they couldn't say couldn't understand him. They couldn't see him. And he walks with them. So to to Mary, he's like a gardener. &gt;&gt; To the two on the way to Emmas, he was a stranger. &gt;&gt; A little while later, when he's trying to make it more clear, he's a spirit. And so Mary, she wants to take and show me where the body is &gt;&gt; to the two on the way to Emmas. He's like a stranger and they're just talking to him as a are you a stranger? You don't know what's happened? Well, we'll tell you a little while. And he didn't want them he didn't want Mary in her state. He didn't want the two on the way to Emmas on in their state. And a little while later when they're running and saying he's resurrected and he appears and they're terrified, he didn't want them terrified either. So he doesn't want you ignorant. He doesn't want you confused. And he doesn't want you terrified. He wants you to know what's happening. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said hearing only brings the word that produces the faith. &gt;&gt; There can be no hearing if there's an absence of the word. &gt;&gt; If there's no hearing, there will be no faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that is why he said and dealt with rapturing faith as he journeyed through it was it wasn't William Brham it's the Lord Jesus Christ in his ministry giving him his ministry and telling him in his early ministry that we don't have enough faith to be healed. How do we have enough faith for the rapture? &gt;&gt; But I want you to listen now. Some people major on that. I'm not majoring on that. I'm going to go on down in his ministry till he says this will bring the rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophecies. Behold the day come. &gt;&gt; Amen. My time is slipping away. &gt;&gt; Behold the day come say the Lord that I will send a famine in the land. Not a famine of bread &gt;&gt; or a thirst for water, but of hearing &gt;&gt; the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Of hearing the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because they won't have the word of the Lord to speak. &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; They have the word of the seminary. &gt;&gt; They have the word of human human study. &gt;&gt; And I just said, "Oh God, we don't want just a human study. &gt;&gt; I study here. I wait on. But I keep this message before me. I want to be saturated &gt;&gt; with what God would vindicated [Music] &gt;&gt; a famine which is a drastic shortage &gt;&gt; of the word &gt;&gt; and they shall wander from sea to sea and from north even to the east and they shall run to and fro and seek the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And shall not find it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible? And shall not &gt;&gt; find it. &gt;&gt; They'll wander. They'll stagger. They'll tremble. They'll be unstable. &gt;&gt; This is a prophecy. &gt;&gt; A prophecy can be fulfilled very quickly, as I said at the beginning, or over a long period of time. And the prophecies concerning the coming of Christ as the Messiah were spoken over hundreds of years that they were fulfilled in just a very short time, a very few years. And some of them were happening so quickly. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, Jesus said, "When the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?" And brother Brandham puts it the faith on the earth. &gt;&gt; Because the word, he says, nevertheless, he refers to it in anointed ones at the end time. Now he said, now that's the question. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Will he find faith on the earth? That's the question. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 said, now notice he ties the two together. Please get it in the lesson. In the days of the message of the seventh angel, the mystery of God should be finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Here's the question. &gt;&gt; If you follow in the line of this hour, &gt;&gt; will it be finished? Amen. &gt;&gt; Will it be finished? Will I find faith? &gt;&gt; Will I find faith? Will it be finished? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The messenger, &gt;&gt; the the messenger to whom the mystery was revealed must preach and declare the whole mystery of God. &gt;&gt; But even when he was here on earth, he's saying, "Shall I find faith? Shall I find thee faith on the earth?" And the and then when he comes, he says, "Will it be finished?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Will Malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time? &gt;&gt; Restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the farmer father's the original word. &gt;&gt; Shall he find the faith on the earth? &gt;&gt; Hearing is not just the mechanics of the sound striking the eard drum. &gt;&gt; That's not the hearing he's speaking about. It is the attention to what is delivered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How much attention? That's why we preach young men especially to you. Young fathers, especially to you, spiritual heads in your home. &gt;&gt; Amen. those that will be accountable to God for your wives &gt;&gt; and your family. Hear attention to what is delivered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The act of hearing attentively. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so those of you that are preparing, you're preparing maybe further education. Fine. But this is this is a higher education right here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a higher education. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I don't make all parents responsible for all decisions that their children make. But you are responsible to live an example. &gt;&gt; So that you can call that son or that daughter &gt;&gt; and said, "I live the example before you." Amen. &gt;&gt; And my God is the God &gt;&gt; and this is the faith &gt;&gt; and this is the word that brings the resurrection and the rapture. &gt;&gt; Can I take a few more minutes, please? &gt;&gt; When the bride says, "And sweet is thy voice." Sweet is thy voice. That's very interesting in the Hebrew it's we say sweet first it is to be pleasant but it comes from a second word and the real real that gives it the depth and its meaning and the second word that is a it's a in gathering and the harvest it will take you a moment to think about it sweet is thy voice it's like a you are wooing me. Your voice draws me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the voice that will raise those that are sleeping in Christ, the depths and essence of that voice is &gt;&gt; that the bridegroom is gathering his elect to himself. &gt;&gt; For all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And at the appropriate time, &gt;&gt; they will come out from the earth. Why? Because sweet is his voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be misunderstood and I don't want to say anything, but if what you hear being preached doesn't woo you &gt;&gt; and draw you &gt;&gt; with a compelling force, &gt;&gt; then you're not getting it. You're not hearing him. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're hearing the sound of my voice or other preachers vibrating on your eard drums. That's not it. &gt;&gt; And when you hear a message, you can hear brother Brandham, you can hear tape after tape after tape, but if it only resounds on your eard drums, that's not him. That voice was only chosen &gt;&gt; to demonstrate and express the voice of the beloved one. [Applause] [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me your attention. Now, if you want to ask, I I experience this on a regular basis. I can't just read a book. I can't just listen to a tape. I want to actually experience. You say, "What can I do?" You youngest of the young people here can say, "Lord Jesus, I believe with all my heart that's you. I believe that you're you can say it right now. I can I believe that's you trying to speak to me. Brother Biscll is doing what he can do, &gt;&gt; but I believe that the Holy Spirit is here. And I want you to speak to me. &gt;&gt; And what you say I will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you brothers and you out there, whoever you are, this is not just a church. This is not We are here. Yes, we have socialized, but we're not here to socialize. &gt;&gt; That's not our purpose. Our purpose is to get ready. My whole commitment, my whole purpose is to get you ready for the rapture &gt;&gt; and the change of this body. And if I can contribute even a little bit to seeing something was said that I was able to surrender to the Holy Spirit and something was said that was so gripping that you could say I I I I forsook the world. I had a different set of priorities because of some service. And God, the Holy Spirit confirmed to my heart and my soul, my commitment and my yielding to the Holy Spirit and to let him have his perfect will and way in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And thus I died in the faith or I was alive and changed in my atoms. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's sweet to be gathered. &gt;&gt; And while he talked, his voice was a gathering voice. &gt;&gt; And they said to one another, "Did not our heart burn within us while we talk to him?" By the way, &gt;&gt; the burning in their heart, that burning, that that whatever they want to call it, some might call it a conviction. It's not a conviction, but that burning, that drawing, that that something special, the Lord speaking to me. The purpose of that is to draw you into a into a special experience, into a special relationship. And ultimately, just on the other side, embracing and shaking hands with one another and tears of joy going down our face. What can compare with that friend? &gt;&gt; Reading between the lines &gt;&gt; puts us into an atmosphere. Peter said looking for and hasting unto looking with expectation waiting with expectation and hasting making haste and to desire is to desire earnestly. I don't see anything in the apostles that that would indicate that we should just go and live our humrum life &gt;&gt; and be burdened and weighted down with the cares of this life. We have those cares, but there's got to be a greater a greater concern. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You that have unsaved young people, I see you here. &gt;&gt; Believe actively. Not that you haven't, but continue to believe actively. [Music] &gt;&gt; Believe actively. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We could talk about healing. I'm not talking about healing. Now, healing is only the token evidence of the resurrection. I don't want to talk about the token evidence. I want to talk about the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a lesson. The message teaches and to many of you this is very uh elementary but the message teaches that he come in three sons names. He &gt;&gt; one God came in three sons names. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Came in the son of man. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says prophet &gt;&gt; the son of God &gt;&gt; the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the son of David in the millennium. Those are the three &gt;&gt; he said. But, and this is in proving his word, but in between &gt;&gt; this conjunction &gt;&gt; according to his own words in the day when the son of man shall be revealed reveal himself. &gt;&gt; Not the son of God, son of man will reveal himself. Notice notice please the words in a different way. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the son of man, but in this junction &gt;&gt; between the son of man and the between the son of God and the son of David &gt;&gt; he comes again. He says another place to fulfill the rest of it. &gt;&gt; But now he says very clearly here in another way. &gt;&gt; What is another way? Well, I'll tell you. I referred to it last. The pillar of fire said it's over this man. It's over this woman. over this young person. The pillar fire was present. &gt;&gt; Whirlwinds came down. &gt;&gt; Judgment was called. Alasco almost sunk. &gt;&gt; Um other prophecies of the future. Some prophecies happen very quick and and and he and he himself stood right there at the platform and the people be came under a certain feeling. &gt;&gt; He could bring you into that right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want to say something clearly so you don't misunderstand me. You've heard brother Ed speak about when he was in the car and the prophet of God was driving and that angel of the Lord came. I've tried to describe it. Brother Brandham says I can't describe. I'm in two worlds but I can't explain it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I he said I've tried but he can't explain it. And I've spoke about that experience and he he could bring you into that if he wished to. But I believe that that was unique because of him. And the angel of the Lord, the Lord Jesus Christ could come to that vessel. &gt;&gt; I was the one that was in a frozen state. I've had others say, "Well, I I've experienced that." No, you haven't experienced that. When you experience that, you don't even know. But your next your breath your next breath I'm talking about this one &gt;&gt; and you're going to be another place &gt;&gt; but that presence came in this time &gt;&gt; to a messenger to confirm to you &gt;&gt; that this is for the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This is for all of us. Not that we have these little wonderful feelings as we go along. That's not what I'm talk I'm talking about the change. There will be a sweep. You will not feel it, &gt;&gt; but you will be transformed &gt;&gt; into another person. &gt;&gt; People would call us crazy. We're ready for the puzzle factory. That's according to God's holy word. &gt;&gt; That's according to this holy word. &gt;&gt; And you want to take it for your own personal possession. You and you want to say, "I shall be changed." God's word says, "I shall be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. I shall be changed." And now God came himself, &gt;&gt; right? To a messenger to confirm that now, this is the hour. &gt;&gt; This is the time. If it's this year or next year, who cares? &gt;&gt; But this word came to prepare us. &gt;&gt; If we're to go by the way of the grave, we'll go prepared. Hallelujah. We'll die with faith that will take us out of the grave. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In between this junction, &gt;&gt; he says, "And does God ever change his mind?" Bear with me. Let me give me a little bit of time, will you? Is that all right? &gt;&gt; But in between the son of God and the son of David according to his own word is another quote now. And according to Malachi 4 and and many places he's he he's to return back &gt;&gt; into his church in a physical form [Music] &gt;&gt; in the people &gt;&gt; in a and he said it in human beings &gt;&gt; in the way of being a prophet. &gt;&gt; This is something you're not to be afraid of. It is Christ himself that has returned back &gt;&gt; in a different way. &gt;&gt; And it's him that is with his people, &gt;&gt; not another one. &gt;&gt; This isn't some strange doctrine. This is precisely what the message has declared. &gt;&gt; He's the one who said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I shall come to you. &gt;&gt; In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you so. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I shall come and receive you unto myself. &gt;&gt; And in after the resurrection of the of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, that was him. &gt;&gt; Mary thought he's a gardener, but it was him. They emaous gentleman thought he was a stranger but it was him &gt;&gt; walking with them going with them going to their house eating bread &gt;&gt; looking like a spirit &gt;&gt; eating honeycomb and fish. It was him &gt;&gt; and then being said being seen above 40 days &gt;&gt; with many infallible proofs. Not to the public. To the believer, &gt;&gt; to them that believed, &gt;&gt; they that heard earnestly and attentively &gt;&gt; and crave for it and yearned for it and said, "Your voice is sweet. It's compelling. It's calling me. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; I feel like going home. &gt;&gt; I feel like going home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to I want to raise your expectations so high. &gt;&gt; God help me to make it so real. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ed, Brother Priscal, I can't miss that. [Music] [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; truly God is in human beings. But &gt;&gt; the sign of the end was a prophet human being. &gt;&gt; Christ in a prophet human being. That was the sign. And that's why he said this is the sign of the resurrection. And this is the sign of the Messiah. Search it out. &gt;&gt; Search it in your own computer. This is the sign of Messiah &gt;&gt; here on earth again. &gt;&gt; The Jews missed that one. The Gentiles missed this one. But the bride does not miss it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in modern events. I'm going to close &gt;&gt; after 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He begins to again fulfill the prophecy. &gt;&gt; He begins to f He begins to fulfill the prophecy. &gt;&gt; As he laid down the prophecy, he begins to fill the fulfill the pro prophecy by revealing himself. &gt;&gt; Yes. And in modern events now the prophet is coming to the end of his ministry and the end of his life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says and he said in one place now Jesus was coming to the end of his life there &gt;&gt; and the prophet was coming to the end of his life here. &gt;&gt; Oh my friends read between the lines. &gt;&gt; It's the same one. &gt;&gt; The same ministry. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Why did he come the first time? to redeem and show them that he had redeemed and to show them that he had resurrected. But by his because through his death we're justified, but in his resurrection were glorified. &gt;&gt; And he was so precise in laying down the prophecy. Read the prophecy. Pray over the prophecy. Read Luke 24 &gt;&gt; and put yourself there and read between the lines. That will happen again. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's not a question whether it'll happen. The question is where will you be? &gt;&gt; This preaching is happening even this morning so that you can be right in step. &gt;&gt; I heard it. I heard it. I don't understand it, but I'm in tune with it. My I'm yearning. I'm craving. Hallelujah. That's the only thing that means anything. I go to work, but I'm yearning. I go to school, but I'm yearning. Hallelujah. This body's going to be changed. I shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will meet my brothers, my sisters. Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; that same spirit that's in me now, it's going to change me. He's going to let you know who you're with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It had to be a special experience. When the prophet went beyond beyond the curtain of time and had other experiences and one came up to him, he didn't know it was his daughter. &gt;&gt; Sharon Rose, &gt;&gt; mother's over here waiting for you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] That's why I looked at the picture of my mom. &gt;&gt; I'm about three years old. &gt;&gt; About three years before the Lord took her. I looked at her picture. Going to see you. &gt;&gt; Going to see you. &gt;&gt; I'm getting ready for it, friends. &gt;&gt; I'm going to walk down a path. The prophet already said it. &gt;&gt; You'll walk down a trail and one of these days you'll find me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He told us he'll be singing Amazing Grace. Might as well sing Amazing Grace and get accustomed to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, brother Sister Iverson, &gt;&gt; God bless you. Going to see your father, Sister Iverson. Glorious man of God. Hallelujah. Your father-in-law, Brother Hank. Hallelujah. It's going to be that real. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I feel like doing a dance. &gt;&gt; If we can't rejoice in this, what are we here for? &gt;&gt; Let the world have their wild time. But this is a my time. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. said, "Now Jesus made himself known &gt;&gt; to these disciples." Now, &gt;&gt; these two disciples, Cleopus, his friend, &gt;&gt; now we're we're in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; How do you know you're not in the resurrection? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Well, you might say there's strange there'd be strange things. There is strange things happening. &gt;&gt; You say something's happening. &gt;&gt; Maybe the same Holy Spirit is seeking to open your eyes &gt;&gt; and give you an understanding. [Music] &gt;&gt; The morning after the resurrection, the first resurrection, what a beautiful morning, Jesus is up from the dead, living amongst his people. What a beautiful thought. &gt;&gt; He's here &gt;&gt; the same today &gt;&gt; as he was that day. &gt;&gt; Thus sayaith the Lord. He's here the same today as he was that day. &gt;&gt; Homegoing time, friends. It's homegoing time. I'm not here to excite you. I'm here to put you in expectation. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll close with this. I'll try. It's hard for me to close, but I'll close with this. &gt;&gt; When I started said he came as a virgin-born son and laid out the prophecy, then he came and used a redeemed son. Why? Because redemption. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And listen, church, this is a critical point. Redemption. I'm talking about full redemption. &gt;&gt; You're cleansed. &gt;&gt; You're pure. &gt;&gt; You're holy. &gt;&gt; You're not beyond mistakes, but you're holy. &gt;&gt; You're the pure spotless bride of Jesus Christ. Don't ever lose sight of that. And don't ever let Satan mar that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he had to come and take an adopted redeemed son. &gt;&gt; So that redemption would be complete and so that we would even the people in the world they couldn't figure out what kind of servant, what kind of man this is. William Brandham and some went off to this side, some went off to that side. But there's a body of people, a group of people that are down the middle. Now listen, because full redemption includes a resurrection. Full redemption includes a change of this body. And it took that servant to say that scripture is a prophecy for you. Listen to the prophecy. enter into this relationship and read between the lines. &gt;&gt; This is Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is not 40 years ago. This is today. &gt;&gt; We're still here, &gt;&gt; but we may not be here for tonight. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Only God knows how my heart is beating now. &gt;&gt; And don't let any fear grip you. &gt;&gt; But this is being preached &gt;&gt; so that the fear will come off you. &gt;&gt; And I hope God's ministering to you &gt;&gt; right now. He came with this message that you believe &gt;&gt; to deliver you from that fear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he wouldn't even speak to you. He wouldn't even draw you if you weren't his. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I preached to you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan have any advantage. &gt;&gt; This message came so we would be there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I wouldn't want anybody just take this casual. I'm just come here, you know, once in a while and because it's church and no, no, no, no. If that's what you believe, &gt;&gt; one day you'll come to church &gt;&gt; and you'll find it very empty &gt;&gt; and you'll say, "Where is everybody? &gt;&gt; Oh, they must have changed the clock." No, &gt;&gt; it's God's clock. &gt;&gt; He changed it and he just decided time to bring them home. &gt;&gt; They heard my voice. They love my voice. They say it's sweet to me, father. And he'll say, "Come home." Yes. &gt;&gt; See you in the rapture, friends. &gt;&gt; If not the next ver not the next not in the next service, I'll meet you in the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's we've been laboring all these years for &gt;&gt; for this one cause. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to ask brother Kim to sing it. Could you come? Linda, can you come and play it? Is that all right? I said no. Do we have I'll see you in the rapture. Whoever knows it. Use one of those. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Kim's been waiting for a week to sing this song or more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sure you can join him in the course if you wish. Do we have we have some verses too? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoy the word this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I was thinking as brother Biscll was was was preaching the this morning, you know, people ask us, you know, why are you building a school if you believe in a rapture? Why are you witnessing to your family? Why are you out on the streets? &gt;&gt; We'll work until Jesus comes. &gt;&gt; And the spirit and the bride say come. &gt;&gt; And we'll be on the streets saying come. We'll be on the mission field saying come. We'll stay come until he comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And one day, brother Peta, he'll come walking through the school. I look at brother Peter, he's working 12, 14 hours a day. I see him at the end of the day weary and tired. and he'll come through the school and he say, "Lay down your tools, Peter. It's time to go home." &gt;&gt; Amen. We're looking forward to that day. &gt;&gt; There's a new body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's enjoy it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. We're here for a short time, but we're here for a good time. [Music] If we never meet again on this earth, my precious friend. If to God you have been true and you've lived above all sin, then for us there'll be a meeting. A hallelujah meeting. I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day. [Music] I'll see you in the rapture.

We want to sing it again, but I want to I want you to shake hands. Whoever was inspired to write this song doesn't have the inspiration you have. Cuz when you shake hands, it might be the next hand you shake will be the hand of the savior. &gt;&gt; So you turn around, shake hands, and say, "I'll meet you in the rapture." I'll see you in the rapture. &gt;&gt; I'll see you in the rapture. I'll see you in that meeting. In the end [Applause] there forever I'll see you after. [Music] Isn't he wonderful? I'd like to sing that chorus to Oh, the next hand you shake may be the hand of the savior. Uh I've learned brother Isaac Norie hand you shake could be the hand of the savior. The next step you take could be on the streets of your home. Oh, your next could be the merits of her and the next voice you hear and say, "Well done.

But I walk around sometime I'm driving in my car and I just I just sing this little chorus. I heard it brother Isaac Negas probably 25 30 years ago. I can tell you it was never as real as it's been in the last few weeks. And I just just sing it along to myself. Oh, the next hand you shake will be the hand of the savior. Your next step you take with me on the street of your soul. &gt;&gt; It will happen with me. the Mary supper. And the next voice you hear could be him saying, "Well done, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus."
