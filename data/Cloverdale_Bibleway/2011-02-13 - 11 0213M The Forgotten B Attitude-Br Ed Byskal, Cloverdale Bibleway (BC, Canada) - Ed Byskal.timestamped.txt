[18:40] &gt;&gt; It is well with my soul.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of our Lord.
[18:46] Hallelujah. We want to give him glory.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; We have a testimony from our sister
[18:50] Star. She had asked the Lord for healing
[18:53] in her hands. She's been having pain for
[18:54] months. She's been having to take
[18:56] painkillers and iced her hands in the
[18:57] morning and the evenings. Sister Jessica
[18:59] Calwell requested prayer at a prayer
[19:01] meeting. I remember that. Amen. And by
[19:04] camp, she was doing things without pain
[19:06] that she hadn't done for a long time.
[19:07] She takes no more pain relievers and
[19:09] believes God for a complete and total
[19:10] healing. She thanks him for what he is
[19:12] doing. Praise our Lord. Amen. God bless
[19:15] you, Sister Star. We rejoice with you.
[19:19] Amen. The same God. Hallelujah.
[19:22] Why don't we sing that actually? The
[19:23] same God that spoke to you. We sang this
[19:25] at prayer meeting on Friday night. I
[19:27] don't know how many of you have heard,
[19:28] but we had a supernatural time on Friday
[19:30] night. It was Saturday morning at camp
[19:31] all over again. God came down at such a
[19:33] mighty way. Everyone was just lost in
[19:35] his presence. It was an outstanding
[19:37] evening. And so, trust that you'll be
[19:39] able to join us in the future prayer
[19:41] meetings. We had a wonderful time. Amen.
[19:43] Let's sing this. We'll start with the
[19:45] first verse. I look back on history.
[19:48] Hallelujah. Oh, I look back on history
[19:53] and I see the mighty God
[19:57] unveil.
[19:58] He's proving
[20:01] over and over that his word can never
[20:06] fail. Oh, but I can't keep on dwelling
[20:12] on some past me.
[20:17] Oh, cuz Jesus is God.
[20:25] [Music]
[20:26] Oh,
[20:28] the same God

[20:50] [Music]
[20:56] in the same God.
[21:03] Say God created
[21:06] God
[21:08] created
[21:10] all the heaven and all the earth. Oh, he
[21:15] came back
[21:18] when there was power in his word.
[21:23] Heat. Heat.

[36:54] wonder if you would come and just take
[36:55] these requests before the Lord. We also
[36:57] want to give glory to the Lord for
[36:58] healing our sister Tracy's migraine. As

[37:24] message. She's a homesick, brother
[37:27] Nathaniel Frey. Also, there's a number
[37:29] that have been sick and body, my wife, a
[37:32] number of others. Satan's not too
[37:34] pleased whenever you see a move like
[37:36] we've been experiencing. Hallelujah.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we'll just keep on pressing.
[37:40] He's already been defeated. We're
[37:42] already healed.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Peter Bonnie's requesting
[37:45] prayer for a co-work coworker, Brother
[37:47] Manfred, a contractor. He has high
[37:50] cholesterol and heart problems. And just
[37:52] is asking that we would pray for him.
[37:54] Amen. If there's a need on your heart,
[37:55] Brother Ricard, why don't you just come
[37:56] and take them before the Lord. Amen.
[37:59] Hallelujah. God bless you.
[38:05] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus.
[38:08] Father,
[38:10] Lord, words cease what we feel and what
[38:13] we've been experiencing, Lord, and your
[38:14] spirit and your nearness and your
[38:16] closeness, Father.
[38:19] Lord, and what greater joy there is to a
[38:21] son and daughter of God, but to
[38:22] experience the manifestation of his
[38:24] word, Father. The manifestation of his
[38:26] word in his people, Lord. And Father, we
[38:29] just can't help but be joyous and
[38:31] overcome with all that you've done,
[38:33] Father. Lord, who can argue the
[38:36] testimony? Who can argue the life? Who
[38:38] can argue, Lord, the experience that
[38:40] we've seen, Father? And truly, whenever
[38:43] we talk about you, Lord, we can say and
[38:45] point to that and say, Lord, this is
[38:46] real. This is good, Father. Lord, we've
[38:49] come here and we can say, I'm glad when
[38:52] I've come to the house of the Lord to
[38:54] worship, Lord, not just to receive from
[38:56] you, but to give back and to give glory
[38:58] and to give testimony, Father. And so
[39:00] it's important for us Lord to not just
[39:02] ask always but to give back and give
[39:04] testimony for the great things you've
[39:05] done Lord the things not that you've
[39:08] done been doing that you will do but
[39:10] Lord that you are doing right now Father
[39:13] Lord we've come here to you this morning
[39:15] Lord to hear from the word to hear what
[39:18] you have to say to us Father for we know
[39:20] that it's a manifesting time and Lord we
[39:22] want to not just hear but manifest what
[39:24] we hear Lord
[39:27] these different needs the ones I've
[39:29] requested Father, how often we come and
[39:31] we ask, Lord, and maybe it's not as real
[39:34] to us because we're not going through
[39:35] that at that point in time, but Father,
[39:37] your word says we need to truly become
[39:39] under the burden for if one in the body
[39:42] suffered, Lord, we all suffered, Lord.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; So, may we just unite our hearts this
[39:46] morning for these ones, Lord,
[39:48] &gt;&gt; different ones that's not feeling well
[39:49] in the body. Maybe that for a coworker,
[39:52] Lord, there's needs in the body that we
[39:54] know that we've spoken about before.
[39:56] Lord, may you come and heal them this
[39:57] morning, Lord. May you just come and may
[40:00] we come under the burden of that,
[40:01] Father, that you may anoint our faith
[40:04] that we can believe for we know it's
[40:05] already been said and done, but Lord, we
[40:07] need to see it and we need to believe
[40:08] it, Lord. Not a mental belief, but a
[40:11] true belief, Father. Faith that is
[40:13] manifested that's that's real, Lord. And
[40:15] we just pray that we come into this
[40:18] morning uniting our hearts, believing
[40:19] for the different ones, Father. We just
[40:22] so appreciate all that you do for us. Be
[40:25] with the man of God this morning. Lord,
[40:27] may you just come and speak to our
[40:28] hearts directly.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, may it find good ground to fall
[40:32] in. Lord, may we just
[40:34] &gt;&gt; take in what you've said to us. May it
[40:36] come right down to the soul. May it not
[40:38] just get stuck in the spirit or in the
[40:40] outer limits, but may it sink down right
[40:42] deep where we have need of it and we can
[40:44] draw on it in future. Lord, help us and
[40:47] transform us, Father, into what you want
[40:48] us to be.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Your bride that will spend eternity with
[40:53] you. Father, we just pray now, Lord,
[40:55] that you'll anoint this service. Be with
[40:57] your different ones,
[40:59] the musicians, the deacons, the speaker.
[41:03] Father, the audience, Lord, may we just
[41:05] hear what you have to say to us in Jesus
[41:08] Christ's precious name we ask it. Amen.
[41:12] [Music]
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Why don't you
[41:16] greet one another before you have your
[41:18] seats? I want to say, God bless you all.
[41:21] welcome you into the house of the Lord
[41:22] this morning.
[41:24] Any who may be visiting with us, just
[41:26] trust you'll feel welcome in the house
[41:27] of the Lord today. And those on the
[41:29] internet, we're thankful you can be a
[41:31] part of the service this morning. Want
[41:32] to say God bless you. Amen. One quick
[41:35] announcement and then uh Sister Margaret
[41:38] Darlene's cabins are going to come and
[41:40] bless us with a special.
[41:42] So why don't you come and get ready? One
[41:43] quick announcement. There are a few
[41:45] things on a table in the fellowship room
[41:46] left behind from winter camp. If you're
[41:48] missing something and it's not there,
[41:50] please get in touch with Sister Star
[41:51] Caldwell. But if you would just swing by
[41:52] the table, sometimes parents, you don't
[41:54] realize something's missing until you
[41:56] see it on a lost and found table. So
[41:59] check that out and let's sing. Isn't he
[42:00] wonderful? Wonderful. Isn't Jesus my
[42:03] Lord wonderful? As they're getting
[42:04] ready, oh, isn't he wonderful?

[52:40] [Music]
[52:57] If they could count my days before you,
[53:04] the book of my life will
[53:10] be closed
[53:12] if I can look back to see all my works.
[53:19] [Music]
[53:21] All I've done,
[53:24] Lord, all I've done.
[53:28] I wonder if I live my life for you.
[53:35] I wonder if I did the best
[53:41] I could.
[53:43] I wonder if my works will please
[53:48] you, Lord.
[53:52] All I've done,
[53:55] Lord. All I've done.
[53:58] [Music]
[53:59] When I can see my ups
[54:04] and downs,
[54:07] the mistakes I made in this
[54:12] journey.
[54:15] And when this life will be
[54:20] over
[54:23] with all I've done,
[54:26] Lord, all I've done.
[54:30] I wonder if I live my life
[54:35] for you.
[54:38] I wonder if I did the best
[54:43] I could.
[54:45] I wonder if my works will please
[54:50] you, Lord.
[54:54] All I've done,
[54:57] Lord. all I've done.
[55:01] But your amazing grace is my
[55:06] comfort.
[55:09] It is by your grace I am
[55:14] perfect.
[55:16] Lord, I did the best I could for you
[55:25] in all I've done,
[55:28] Lord. All I've done.
[55:32] I wonder if I live my life
[55:37] for you.
[55:39] I wonder if I did the best
[55:45] I could.
[55:47] I wonder if my works will please
[55:52] you, Lord.
[55:56] All I've done,
[55:59] Lord, all I've done.
[56:02] I wonder if I live my life for you.
[56:10] I wonder if I did the best
[56:15] I do.
[56:18] I wonder if my works will please you,
[56:23] Lord.
[56:26] All I've done,

[56:43] I love
[56:45] you more,

[56:53] you more.
[56:56] [Music]

[57:08] your name.
[57:14] I lift
[57:16] your name,

[57:32] your name,
[57:37] Lord. I love
[57:40] you more.
[57:45] I love
[57:48] you more.
[57:52] Lord, I love
[57:56] you more.
[58:01] I love
[58:03] you more.
[58:10] [Applause]
[58:18] Amen. Thank you, brother Daniel.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Daniel, do you have work yet?
[58:28] Did you find a job? Just about 3 weeks
[58:32] ago or so, brother Daniel lost his work,
[58:34] lost his job. And but you know what I
[58:38] appreciate?
[58:40] a congregation doesn't hardly know and
[58:43] they just keep coming to church and
[58:45] driving this distance from Seattle and
[58:47] are faithful and and uh so we just if
[58:51] you didn't we were going to pray that
[58:52] you would find find one. Amen.
[58:57] Good to be in the house of God.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Good to hear all the things that are
[59:03] taking place amongst us and elsewhere as
[59:06] well. But before we uh uh I have a few
[59:11] things that I want to mention before we
[59:15] go further in the in the uh service. I
[59:18] just want to show our sincere
[59:20] appreciation for everyone that uh has
[59:24] been assisting at the camp
[59:26] uh for brother Derek and Sister Debbie.
[59:30] Uh it's really been wonderful. And for
[59:33] those that have volunteered here and
[59:36] assisted brother uh brother Kim and all
[59:39] the people who have been working on the
[59:42] school building and the sisters that
[59:44] came and have made uh lunch and I think
[59:49] that's probably going to have to even go
[59:51] beyond being uh volunteer probably
[59:55] somebody's going to have to take some
[59:56] responsibility even for part of the time
[59:58] because the brothers are coming on a
[1:00:00] regular basis and uh And some are
[1:00:02] spending time during the day, but on
[1:00:04] Saturdays when they do call and and it
[1:00:06] just
[1:00:08] those are not uh not every Saturday, but
[1:00:11] uh uh those announcement will be made
[1:00:14] and I think they'd called for about 20
[1:00:16] or 25, but I think there's about 40 that
[1:00:18] showed up yesterday throughout the day.
[1:00:21] Uh and a lot of work was done. Just a
[1:00:23] lot of work was done. Uh,
[1:00:27] I can't go into that building without
[1:00:30] thinking of those that if the Lord Jesus
[1:00:33] carries that are going to be raised up
[1:00:37] in the atmosphere that I know will
[1:00:39] prevail there.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you something, friends.
[1:00:42] There's people there that don't have
[1:00:45] children. There's people there who whose
[1:00:47] children are grown up and gone. But for
[1:00:50] myself all I see is it's a blessed place
[1:00:55] for the believers children and and more
[1:00:59] than that uh they talk about certain
[1:01:02] areas that you know this fellowship room
[1:01:04] that we have here isn't sufficient for
[1:01:06] us anymore and what they call a
[1:01:08] gymnasium over there that's going to be
[1:01:10] a I hope everybody understands that as
[1:01:13] far as I'm concerned that'll be a
[1:01:15] fellowship room over there as well that
[1:01:18] will provide the needs of the of the
[1:01:21] congregation.
[1:01:23] But um some time ago uh I mentioned
[1:01:27] probably just before we took vacation I
[1:01:30] mentioned something uh concerning the
[1:01:32] the desire and the burden that I have
[1:01:35] and I I'm a little bit conscious because
[1:01:37] I know we're going on internet and so on
[1:01:39] but I mentioned about uh uh online uh
[1:01:44] streaming of the of the classrooms and
[1:01:48] it's more than I mean brother Dingwall
[1:01:51] and others took took a hold of the idea
[1:01:54] and it is it is in not only possible but
[1:01:57] I'm sure that you're going to see it and
[1:02:00] uh uh there's all kinds of people for
[1:02:03] example there are people who homeschool
[1:02:06] what what what caused me to think about
[1:02:08] this was some children that we have that
[1:02:11] are part of this congregation and
[1:02:12] families which are on the US side some
[1:02:15] of them perhaps a little too far some of
[1:02:17] them are not able to bring the children
[1:02:19] across for one reason or another but
[1:02:22] they would be able to uh stream online
[1:02:25] and s actually have it right be
[1:02:29] physically a part of what's going on in
[1:02:31] the classroom. And then there may be
[1:02:34] days that there would be a some kind of
[1:02:37] a a tour or an outing or something else
[1:02:40] and they'd be able to come across and
[1:02:42] become a part of that. So they would
[1:02:44] also have that physical interaction.
[1:02:47] Then there are those that are further
[1:02:49] away. And I know that there are just you
[1:02:51] just take my word for it. There are
[1:02:53] hundreds.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; There are hundreds of there's there's
[1:02:56] hundreds of believers that may be even
[1:02:58] up into the thousands. Some mothers are
[1:03:01] teaching their children, but they don't
[1:03:02] feel qualified and perhaps are not
[1:03:05] qualified. There are others who perhaps
[1:03:07] are qualified, but they're too busy.
[1:03:11] They're maybe occupied and they're maybe
[1:03:13] have small children, whatever more. And
[1:03:16] and so for one reason or another, but I
[1:03:18] can tell you that there are believers
[1:03:20] everywhere that are adamant, simply
[1:03:24] cannot uh give themselves over to send
[1:03:27] their children. Now, some areas may be
[1:03:29] different than others, but but as far as
[1:03:31] the public system is concerned, I can
[1:03:33] tell you that it's for the most part
[1:03:36] corrupt. And some that are even
[1:03:39] Christian in that sense of the word but
[1:03:42] are are in the public domain. They have
[1:03:45] children coming. There are people who
[1:03:47] have troubled children and we have found
[1:03:50] that even here that there were Christian
[1:03:52] schools but people who had troubled
[1:03:55] children were sending them to those
[1:03:57] schools because they felt they needed a
[1:04:00] a stricter environment. So whatever it
[1:04:04] might be, that's not, you know, that's
[1:04:06] not our affairs. But I got a letter from
[1:04:09] a brother and the brother's perhaps
[1:04:11] streaming right now from the Eastern
[1:04:13] United States. I do not know the
[1:04:16] brother. He just wrote it in handwriting
[1:04:20] on a page. And he said he had heard the
[1:04:23] comment about the school. He said, and I
[1:04:27] think they've been homeschooling their
[1:04:29] children. He said, "I we have seven
[1:04:31] children." And he says, "That so touched
[1:04:34] my heart to think that you have a burden
[1:04:36] for the children." And he said, "Uh uh"
[1:04:40] and he sent a check for $500
[1:04:44] for the school and for the internet that
[1:04:47] that might go forward.
[1:04:50] And he said it, and he closed off in the
[1:04:53] letter, he said, "Please pray for us."
[1:04:55] He said, "We're in we're in dire
[1:04:57] financial straits." And I just I felt so
[1:05:01] humbled reading that letter. Here's a
[1:05:05] brother in dire financial straits, has a
[1:05:08] family of seven children, that's nine in
[1:05:10] a family, and sent this school and
[1:05:13] church $500 to help out with that that
[1:05:17] because he caught a hold of that vision.
[1:05:19] I'd like the congregation to be able to
[1:05:21] say, "God bless you."
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:25] And that's a real sacrifice. And I pray
[1:05:27] that God will bless the brother and will
[1:05:29] bring him out of his financial straits.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I believe it's going to be a
[1:05:35] blessing. That's that's just personally
[1:05:37] my vision and I believe that's going to
[1:05:39] be so. And I could say some other
[1:05:41] things. I can tell you that there are
[1:05:43] those that are even in other countries
[1:05:45] in China being one of them, Africa being
[1:05:49] another where there the time zone is
[1:05:52] completely different. But they would be
[1:05:54] able to archive and some of those
[1:05:57] countries in China for example English
[1:05:59] is their second language that they that
[1:06:02] they require or that is available to the
[1:06:05] people and they love death they love
[1:06:09] eager they're eager to learn English and
[1:06:12] if they could if they if the Christians
[1:06:15] and the new believers that are coming
[1:06:16] there would be able to tap into the
[1:06:19] online English uh teaching and and under
[1:06:23] the opaces of this message I don't think
[1:06:26] we should belittle that friends that's a
[1:06:28] very great thing and and I I know that
[1:06:32] when we were printing the message books
[1:06:34] the people just they were so eager to
[1:06:36] get them because they had the Chinese on
[1:06:38] one side and the and the English on the
[1:06:40] other
[1:06:42] I'm really uh so taken with the thing
[1:06:46] that's been that is taking place not
[1:06:49] only since the camp before the camp
[1:06:51] months months for the camp. We don't
[1:06:53] want to just think camp camp because uh
[1:06:57] we don't want the people of the church
[1:06:59] or the people on the internet to think,
[1:07:01] well, we're just, you know, just there's
[1:07:03] a a youth movement, but it's a that's
[1:07:06] God's movement.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what we're we're
[1:07:10] interested in. I want to mention that we
[1:07:12] Lord willing
[1:07:14] uh just before I took vacation we got
[1:07:19] notice that they had found a location uh
[1:07:22] the brothers who've been seeking to
[1:07:24] arrange meetings in Switzerland and they
[1:07:26] found a location uh for meetings. So we
[1:07:30] Lord willing we will be go moving
[1:07:33] forward with these services u June the
[1:07:36] 2nd to June the 5th. Now we don't have
[1:07:40] the v holiday here that they have over
[1:07:43] there. They have they hold Easter which
[1:07:46] we do. Then they have Pentecost which is
[1:07:49] a big it's a big uh holiday in Europe
[1:07:53] and that is 50 days after Easter which
[1:07:56] was re they're celebrating Pentecost.
[1:07:59] And then they celebrate the next weekend
[1:08:01] which is the ascension weekend when
[1:08:04] Jesus ascended. That's the way that they
[1:08:07] have it. And uh so anyway, these
[1:08:10] meetings are going to be on June the 2nd
[1:08:12] to June the 5th. Uh and the announcement
[1:08:16] there is on the board. Um uh I of course
[1:08:20] will be going, the Lord willing, but
[1:08:23] brother Ron Spencer is going to be uh
[1:08:26] speaking as well. And brother Murphy
[1:08:29] will be going because there are other
[1:08:31] churches in Europe that uh have asked
[1:08:34] brother Murphy to be there. in fact is
[1:08:37] he will be just out of Crayfeld
[1:08:40] uh with brother Pankanen on Easter and
[1:08:44] they have uh uh they they feel quite
[1:08:47] close to the work. So I'd like you to be
[1:08:51] praying especially for these meetings.
[1:08:52] The two pastors that are uh uh local
[1:08:56] pastors that are there, brother Franis
[1:08:58] Alipakar who ministered here. He has a
[1:09:01] church perhaps no more than an hour,
[1:09:03] hour and a half from where these
[1:09:05] meetings are. And so I would say to any
[1:09:08] that are in that area of the of the
[1:09:11] world and you're streaming these
[1:09:13] meetings, uh there's brother France
[1:09:15] Alipakar and also brother uh Jeanjac
[1:09:20] Michel and and they have he has a church
[1:09:23] I think maybe about an hour the other
[1:09:25] direction. So people who are interested
[1:09:29] in hearing more about the message, they
[1:09:31] can get in touch with these brothers.
[1:09:36] Uh
[1:09:38] I I may not have all of the details, but
[1:09:41] and quite a few people here have heard
[1:09:43] about
[1:09:44] what's been going on here, the people
[1:09:46] going out on the streets and uh
[1:09:49] witnessing and handing out books. And
[1:09:51] brother Toby was in contact with his
[1:09:54] father, brother Caumb in Congo. And uh
[1:09:59] he he he just said, "This congregation,
[1:10:01] this is what we need to do." And they
[1:10:03] went out on the streets and uh uh people
[1:10:07] came into the church and they baptized
[1:10:10] 27 people. And uh after that uh I think
[1:10:14] it was after that anyway one of the
[1:10:16] services uh brother Caumbi was speaking
[1:10:20] to brother Toby and he said he he got up
[1:10:23] to preach and he preached for about 15
[1:10:26] minutes and the Holy Spirit just took
[1:10:28] over the service
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; and that was uh that was the end of his
[1:10:32] preaching. Not that we want that every
[1:10:34] time but I mean that that's just
[1:10:36] wonderful. And uh similar to what
[1:10:38] happened out at the camp, brother uh
[1:10:41] brother Diggs, he preached this meeting,
[1:10:44] but and then the service uh kind of went
[1:10:47] out of human control. And that's good.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; We we we're not just interested in I
[1:10:54] want to speak about this in a little
[1:10:55] bit, but we're not interested in just uh
[1:10:58] uh uh something of that nature. That's
[1:11:01] not what we're seeking. But we believe
[1:11:02] that that is an end. That's something
[1:11:05] that's sovereign. And that's something
[1:11:06] that God does. And then brother Kyle is
[1:11:08] telling me Friday night, this last
[1:11:10] Friday night, he said it was just a a a
[1:11:14] roar of prayer and no no one single
[1:11:16] voice, just everyone praying and praying
[1:11:20] for different burdens. And there's about
[1:11:22] 75 people packed in the fellow in the
[1:11:25] chapel. I I think that that is going to
[1:11:28] the prayer meeting is going to probably
[1:11:30] have to move in the future when we can
[1:11:32] to the fellowship room because it's
[1:11:34] packed right out. And I say praise be to
[1:11:37] God.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; And uh uh it it it's wonderful when a
[1:11:41] prayer meeting gets to the place where
[1:11:42] people want to come.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; When it gets to the place where if
[1:11:45] you're not there, you feel you might be
[1:11:47] missing something.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; That's really wonderful. And I want to
[1:11:50] thank you, brother Matthew, and sister
[1:11:52] Rhonda Redell for all of the effort and
[1:11:56] all of the uh delegation that you have
[1:12:00] done and the diligence that you have
[1:12:02] done and and so much of this has has had
[1:12:05] its beginnings uh with the people and
[1:12:07] the young people and not only young
[1:12:09] others as well. I saw brother Larry
[1:12:12] musician out there on the street in a
[1:12:14] picture and I God bless the people that
[1:12:17] uh that pray. God bless the people that
[1:12:20] give. God bless the people that work.
[1:12:22] God bless the people that are the body
[1:12:24] of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; We all are a part. And you don't know
[1:12:27] whether it's just a handshake or an
[1:12:29] encouragement or a word or an email or a
[1:12:33] telephone call or whatever it is. But
[1:12:35] what I say to you is is keep it up.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Keep moving in that direction because
[1:12:41] this is only this is only a means to an
[1:12:44] end.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:48] Uh
[1:12:50] then in China, we got a phone call last
[1:12:53] week
[1:12:55] and we we we heard of uh brother David
[1:12:59] that went to a city and uh he just took
[1:13:04] a little pullpit and set it on the
[1:13:06] sidewalk and uh
[1:13:10] started to speak.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; But the thing was
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; he he Th this
[1:13:18] uh
[1:13:20] brother Ivan, you come up here, would
[1:13:22] you
[1:13:27] just tell them how possible this is in
[1:13:29] China? It's better coming from you.
[1:13:34] I think you took the phone call, didn't
[1:13:36] you? Did you take the phone call from
[1:13:38] Brother David?
[1:13:42] Just come up here.
[1:13:46] Did you take the phone call?
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; I got an email.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; You got an email? Yeah.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; And how possible is this to happen in
[1:13:54] China?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Impossible.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Impossible.
[1:13:57] There you have it. That's why I want him
[1:13:59] to say it.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; It's it it's just um it's just like the
[1:14:05] Bible time when you go into a Greek such
[1:14:08] a country they fellowshipping they
[1:14:11] worshiping the hidden god. They're very
[1:14:14] superstitious.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And they are the government is is uh is
[1:14:19] very bound.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Then you go on the street on the Greek
[1:14:23] like Paul did and uh preach the gospel.
[1:14:26] It's I think it's as hard as that.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. And then and then
[1:14:32] brother David who's speaking here
[1:14:35] speaks a different dialect than the
[1:14:37] people who are there. And so a woman
[1:14:41] stepped up and she started interpreting
[1:14:44] for him.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; And then that gathered a bigger crowd.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; And after they were done with that, they
[1:14:51] baptized nine or 10 people.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And it it
[1:15:04] the street can't handle any traffic. The
[1:15:07] cars are parked up on the side. How How
[1:15:10] do you think that car is going to move?
[1:15:12] The whole street is full of people. And
[1:15:14] then they baptized this woman here,
[1:15:17] baptized this person here, and there's
[1:15:20] the group that was baptized.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:15:25] Hallelujah.
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:29] So, so it's not just Mount Baker camp.
[1:15:32] It's not just what happened Saturday.
[1:15:33] It's not just a prayer meeting here.
[1:15:35] It's in Congo. It's in China. And you
[1:15:38] can be sure it's happening in many other
[1:15:40] places. And we say praise God.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:48] God bless you. God bless you. God bless
[1:15:50] you.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; So I thought we need to know
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; these things. The Bible said were noised
[1:15:59] abroad.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Noised
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; abroad.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful, brother Ernie?
[1:16:07] Praise God. It just makes a person feel
[1:16:11] so overcome by it. Amen. Well, would you
[1:16:16] like to stand and we're going to read
[1:16:18] some scripture.
[1:16:21] Pray for my voice.
[1:16:24] Tell you what, I rebuked the devil for
[1:16:26] all I was worth in the study there.
[1:16:33] Amen.
[1:16:41] Let's just thank the Lord, shall we?
[1:16:45] Almighty God,
[1:16:47] we are we're filled, our hearts are
[1:16:50] filled with praise and thanksgiving. And
[1:16:53] we're here today, oh God, to give glory
[1:16:55] to you. We're here today to take another
[1:16:57] further step.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; We're here today to announce to you, oh
[1:17:01] Lord, that here we are. Here we are in
[1:17:04] your presence.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Here we are to be whatever you would
[1:17:08] have us to be. Here we are, oh God, to
[1:17:10] make ourselves available.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Here we are to sanctify ourselves.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Here we are to sanctify ourselves and
[1:17:18] surrender.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Surrender to the Holy Spirit. Oh, Holy
[1:17:22] Spirit, I pray that you'll move
[1:17:24] throughout the influence of this
[1:17:27] service, wherever it might be, in
[1:17:29] whatever rooms where the sisters are in
[1:17:32] the in with the children, Lord, and the
[1:17:35] babes and and Lord, the the deacons and
[1:17:39] all that may be around the building and
[1:17:42] then the congregation here in the in the
[1:17:44] sanctuary. Come, oh, Holy Spirit, come
[1:17:48] mightily. reach out into the internet
[1:17:52] land, Lord, wherever the people may be
[1:17:54] gathered, one or two or groups that
[1:17:57] might be here or there, and wherever
[1:18:00] this service may be heard, I pray that
[1:18:02] it'll be a foundation stone. Oh God, I
[1:18:06] pray, Father, that you will you'll
[1:18:08] accomplish what you have desired to
[1:18:10] accomplish in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:13] Anoint us now, Father, both speaker and
[1:18:16] hearers for your glory. Amen.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll have you turn to u
[1:18:24] to the Gospel of uh Matthew, Matthew's
[1:18:28] Gospel.
[1:18:32] And while you're standing and you have
[1:18:35] your Bibles open ready to read, I want
[1:18:38] to I want to draw your attention to uh
[1:18:41] two or three quotes first because uh
[1:18:45] because of what I see God doing amongst
[1:18:47] us, I want to tell the congregation
[1:18:49] while I was away, we a wife and I took
[1:18:51] three weeks, but I just had such a
[1:18:54] craving and such a hunger in my heart
[1:18:58] for the congregation,
[1:19:00] not not merely young people, but for the
[1:19:03] congregation that we might
[1:19:06] experience all that God has for us.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be short changed.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; We don't want to see us just carry on
[1:19:17] with unanswered prayers when they can be
[1:19:20] answered.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; We don't want to carry on just with the
[1:19:25] cool embers if we can have a blazing
[1:19:27] fire.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Amen. We don't want to just
[1:19:32] carry on as a prophet of God called I
[1:19:35] don't want to be identified as a
[1:19:37] powerless church.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; And he says a church that doesn't have
[1:19:41] the supernatural is a powerless church.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; I say God save us from a powerless
[1:19:47] church.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; We don't want a social club.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; We don't want a lodge.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; We want the church of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; The book of Acts church.
[1:19:59] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to say to you while we are
[1:20:04] just uh coming to the opening of the
[1:20:07] service that you'll have patience with
[1:20:09] me. I because I want to take sufficient
[1:20:12] time. But at the same time I want to I
[1:20:15] want to be very careful that you
[1:20:17] understand anything I say today is not
[1:20:20] intended to be a negative or a downer
[1:20:22] but it is to tell you that the book of
[1:20:25] acts the upper room
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; that was only to prepare the people for
[1:20:30] the book of acts
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; they didn't have a upper room every
[1:20:35] weekend
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; but they had an upper room and that
[1:20:39] conditioned the people and filled them
[1:20:41] with the holy spirit matured them as men
[1:20:46] so that once they had the upper room, it
[1:20:48] wasn't an upper room and then a downer
[1:20:50] room the next week. No, it was an upper
[1:20:53] room and then they went on from there.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; And that's what God intends.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Just think because of an upper room or
[1:21:01] because of a Holy Spirit being filling
[1:21:04] the people, what a glorious victory it
[1:21:07] is for the bride of Jesus Christ. If out
[1:21:10] from that comes a crop that cannot be
[1:21:14] moved.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; That's the whole intent.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; And so we have here a a quote I'd like
[1:21:25] to have you read with me. Now remember
[1:21:28] this. Christ in the true church is a
[1:21:32] continuation of the book of Acts.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could read that together.
[1:21:38] Christ. Now remember this. Christ in the
[1:21:41] true church is a continuation of the
[1:21:45] book of Acts.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows how
[1:21:49] that the Antichrist spirit would come
[1:21:51] into the church and defile it, making it
[1:21:54] lukewarm, formal, and powerless.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; It exposes Satan. and revelation has
[1:22:01] exposed him,
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; revealing his works, attempted
[1:22:05] destruction of God's people, and the
[1:22:07] discrediting of God's word, right down
[1:22:09] to the time that he's cast into the lake
[1:22:12] of fire, and we're to continue on in our
[1:22:15] direction until he's cast into the lake
[1:22:17] of fire.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; I want to have a ringside seat.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; I want to see that creature annihilated.
[1:22:24] [Applause]
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; He fights that. He cannot stand it. He
[1:22:29] cannot stand what's happening.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; He fights what's happening
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; and he does everything he can to to
[1:22:36] discredit it. He knows that if the
[1:22:39] people get the true revelation of the
[1:22:43] true church
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; and what she is,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; what she stands for and that she can and
[1:22:49] that she can do the greater works,
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; she will be an invincible army.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:58] Who could cease or who could hinder the
[1:23:01] book of Acts from coming about? The book
[1:23:04] of Acts was a certain because it had to
[1:23:06] be part of the scripture.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; And so the people who fulfilled it had
[1:23:10] to be there
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; at that season
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; and surrender themselves
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; to that degree.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Richard Drake, you said a
[1:23:20] mouthful the other day here at the
[1:23:21] pullpit when the Wednesday night when
[1:23:23] the young people were giving their
[1:23:25] testimony. He said what happened at the
[1:23:27] camp happened because the young people
[1:23:29] became surrendered
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; and it will only continue as they
[1:23:34] continue to surrender something on that
[1:23:36] basis and I just said God bless you
[1:23:38] brother Richard that's exactly my theme.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; It'll be an invincible army. He said if
[1:23:46] they get a true revelation of the true
[1:23:48] spirits within the framework of the
[1:23:50] Christian church
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; and by God's spirit discern and
[1:23:53] withstand the antichrist spirit. Amen.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Satan will be powerless before her. That
[1:24:00] is thus saith the Lord.
[1:24:04] [Applause]
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Satan will be powerless
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; before her.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; He will be as definitely thwarted today
[1:24:13] as when Christ withstood his every
[1:24:16] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:24:19] desert. Yes, Satan hates revelation, but
[1:24:23] we love it.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; With true revelation in our lives, the
[1:24:28] gates of hell cannot prevail against us,
[1:24:33] but we will prevail over him.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:39] Amen.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Now, as we just lead to the service,
[1:24:47] Brother Brandon said in the message,
[1:24:48] "Why are people so tossed about?" He
[1:24:50] said, "One of my favorite messages." But
[1:24:53] he said, "There's two different phases
[1:24:55] of the same Christianity."
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; And one of them is an intellectual or
[1:24:59] mental conception of what God has said
[1:25:01] in his word and of Jesus Christ by the
[1:25:05] way of knowledge. And the other is an
[1:25:07] experimental experience that God has
[1:25:11] given the man in his heart.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; The one intellectually is is a
[1:25:17] hungering.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; He's he's he's feasting on God, but his
[1:25:22] feast doesn't hold out.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Now, this is written so that you know
[1:25:27] that what you have received does hold
[1:25:30] out.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; It may not be at the same level all the
[1:25:35] time. It may not be at the same euphoric
[1:25:38] atmosphere all the time, but it's the
[1:25:41] same God. And I want to speak on this
[1:25:43] from the scripture.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; I want you to nail it down. Want you to
[1:25:47] remember this service and remember the
[1:25:49] scriptures. I have quite a few of them.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "And the one seems to have
[1:25:54] victory all the time. There's nothing
[1:25:58] bothers them. And under that nothing,
[1:26:01] I'll say no friendships, no troubles, no
[1:26:05] financial difficulties, no sickness, no
[1:26:09] nothing, nothing can bothers them.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; They're just as solid and anchored as
[1:26:16] they can be. No trials, no storms bother
[1:26:21] them at all.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; We all have trials. Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; But if the trial is bothering us, I want
[1:26:28] to announce to you there's a place
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; in Christ
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; where it will not bother you.
[1:26:35] [Music]
[1:26:35] [Applause]
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; But they seem to have something.
[1:26:40] Hallelujah.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; We have something about them that people
[1:26:45] who are Christians and are trying to
[1:26:47] live for God admire that type of
[1:26:49] Christian. That's the two phases of the
[1:26:52] two types. And I've often wondered,
[1:26:54] think of that, the prophet often
[1:26:56] wondered, Lord, what is it that these
[1:26:58] people have that others crave for so
[1:27:01] much and yet seem to fail to get it?
[1:27:06] All right. Now, we're going to read.
[1:27:10] I want to read from Matthew the 6th, the
[1:27:12] 11th chapter, and starting with verse
[1:27:15] two.
[1:27:18] Now when John had heard in the prison
[1:27:23] the works of Christ, he sent two of his
[1:27:26] disciples,
[1:27:27] and he said unto him, "Art thou he that
[1:27:31] should come, or do we look for another?"
[1:27:34] And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:27:37] "Go and show John again those things
[1:27:40] which you do hear and see. The blind
[1:27:44] receive their sight
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; and the lame walk. The lepers are
[1:27:49] cleansed and the deaf hear.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; The dead are raised up
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; and the poor have the gospel preached to
[1:27:57] them.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Verse six, and blessed is he whosoever
[1:28:02] shall not be offended in me. Brother
[1:28:05] Brandham preached one service
[1:28:08] only once and it was entitled the
[1:28:11] forgotten biatitude.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; And I am calling this service this
[1:28:17] morning the forgotten biatitude
[1:28:20] rediscovered.
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:25] rediscovered because a prophet
[1:28:27] discovered it
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Now the biatitudes
[1:28:32] in Matthew 5, blessed are the poor and
[1:28:36] blessed are the uh poor in spirit. Uh
[1:28:40] blessed are the they that mourn, for
[1:28:42] they shall be comforted. Blessed are the
[1:28:44] meek, for they shall inhabit the earth.
[1:28:46] Blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:28:48] thirst after righteousness. Blessed are
[1:28:51] the merciful, and blessed are the pure
[1:28:53] in heart. Blessed are the peacemakers,
[1:28:55] and blessed are they that are which are
[1:28:58] persecuted for righteousness sake. And
[1:29:01] blessed are ye when men revile you and
[1:29:03] persecute you. And those are all of the
[1:29:06] biatitudes. And he says that was in
[1:29:08] Matthew 4, the sermon on the mount. But
[1:29:11] he says then then over here in Matthew
[1:29:14] 11, he inserts this forgotten beatitude.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:29:26] John the Baptist had a very brief
[1:29:28] ministry
[1:29:30] of actual ministering time. Brother
[1:29:32] Brandham actually said it was just a few
[1:29:34] months
[1:29:38] and he was thrown in prison. We don't
[1:29:41] know exactly how long and that's not
[1:29:44] relevant at this time.
[1:29:46] But he had a he had a ministry that
[1:29:50] burst on the horizon and on the in the
[1:29:54] country of Palestine, little small
[1:29:56] country and he introduced the Messiah.
[1:29:59] He was a great prophet.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Uh Jesus gave him the highest
[1:30:04] commendation.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; He said he was no man born of a woman
[1:30:08] greater than John the Baptist. He said
[1:30:10] because the other prophets prophesied
[1:30:14] but he introduced who they prophesied
[1:30:16] about.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; They prophesied of Christ but he
[1:30:19] introduced the Christ. And I just want
[1:30:22] to uh say a little bit briefly
[1:30:26] so you can because I I I I want to I
[1:30:30] don't want to drag this part out but a a
[1:30:33] bit of his first ministry he preached
[1:30:36] with such boldness and his experience
[1:30:40] was in a in such a short period of time
[1:30:43] here he just come with such a force and
[1:30:46] such a burning in his bones and he says
[1:30:49] and now the axe is laid laid under the
[1:30:51] root of the trees. And every tree that
[1:30:53] bringeth forth not fruit is hewing down
[1:30:56] and cast into the fire. And the people
[1:30:58] asked him, "What shall we do?" Notice
[1:31:01] this is a position he has now. The
[1:31:03] people are asking him, "What shall we
[1:31:05] do?" And he answered unto them, "And he
[1:31:07] that has two coats and so on." He let
[1:31:10] him impart uh let him impart to him that
[1:31:13] hath none. And then then cometh the
[1:31:16] publicans to be baptized. and said unto
[1:31:18] him, "Master, what shall we do?" And
[1:31:21] they and he said unto them, "Exact no
[1:31:23] more than that which is appointed to
[1:31:25] you." And the soldiers likewise now the
[1:31:27] armies coming to him and saying, "And
[1:31:29] what shall we do?" And he tells them and
[1:31:32] said to them, "Do no violence to no man,
[1:31:35] and neither accuse any falsely, and be
[1:31:38] content with your wages." And the people
[1:31:40] were in expectation. And all the people
[1:31:43] mused in their heart uh in in their
[1:31:46] heart of John whether he were the Christ
[1:31:49] or not. Think of think of the ministry.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Is this the Messiah?
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; John was so bold to declare in another
[1:31:59] place in the scripture and John bare
[1:32:01] witness of him of Christ and cried
[1:32:04] saying this is he of whom I spake.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; He cometh. He that cometh after me is
[1:32:11] preferred before me. He was before me.
[1:32:14] And of his fullness have we all received
[1:32:16] grace for grace. For the law was given
[1:32:19] by Moses, but grace and truth came by
[1:32:22] Jesus Christ. And he said, I am the
[1:32:24] voice of one crying in the wilderness.
[1:32:27] Make straight the way of the Lord. And
[1:32:29] as said the prophet Isaiah. And John
[1:32:32] answered them. They asked him if he was
[1:32:33] the Christ. And he said, "I baptize you
[1:32:35] with water, but there standeth one among
[1:32:37] you, whom you know not. He it is who
[1:32:40] coming after me is preferred before me,
[1:32:43] whose shoe latcheth I'm not worthy to
[1:32:45] unloose." And these things were were
[1:32:47] done in Barb Beth Bara uh beyond Jordan
[1:32:51] where John was baptizing. And the next
[1:32:54] day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and
[1:32:57] he said, "Behold the lamb of God which
[1:33:01] taketh away the sin of the world,
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; this is he
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; of whom I said that comes after me,
[1:33:09] which is preferred before me." It says,
[1:33:11] "And I knew him not, but he that he he
[1:33:14] that but he that uh but he
[1:33:19] but that he should be manifest to
[1:33:21] Israel. Therefore, I came baptizing with
[1:33:24] water, and John bare record, saying, I
[1:33:27] saw the Spirit descending from heaven
[1:33:31] like a dove, and it abode upon him, and
[1:33:34] I knew him not, but he that sent me to
[1:33:36] baptize with water, is the same that
[1:33:39] said unto me unto uh upon whom thou
[1:33:42] shalt see the Spirit descending and
[1:33:44] remaining on him, the same is he which
[1:33:48] baptize with the Holy Ghost. Listen to
[1:33:50] his sermon. Listen to his declaration. I
[1:33:54] saw it. I saw it descending. He spoke to
[1:33:57] me and told me on whom I saw it
[1:33:59] descending. This is he and he will
[1:34:02] baptize with the Holy Ghost. He says,
[1:34:04] "And I saw and I bear witness and I bear
[1:34:07] record that this is the son of God."
[1:34:10] Amen.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; And again the next day after John stood
[1:34:14] and two of his disciples and looking
[1:34:16] upon Jesus as he walked, he said,
[1:34:19] "Behold
[1:34:20] the lamb of God."
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; In just a short time,
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; no soldiers are saying, "And what shall
[1:34:31] we do?"
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; In fact, his soldiers are taking him to
[1:34:35] prison.
[1:34:37] No publicans are coming and saying,
[1:34:39] "What shall we do?"
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; All the honor is gone.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; The big meetings have ceased.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; The people have fled.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; And he's come under accusation.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; And he's now he's being in prison and
[1:34:54] the conditions have reversed.
[1:35:02] says to two of his faithful disciples
[1:35:06] go and ask him
[1:35:08] if he really is the one
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; or do we look for another
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; after the reality
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; I will say that the scriptures of the of
[1:35:21] his bold statements I met the Christ
[1:35:26] this message is Christ there is nothing
[1:35:30] like this
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; but there might come a times when you
[1:35:33] find yourself in prison.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; This is not for a whole congregation,
[1:35:38] but I'm preaching it to the whole
[1:35:40] congregation because we as individuals,
[1:35:43] we encounter it. We find ourselves
[1:35:46] imprisoned
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; by circumstance and I want to detail
[1:35:51] these things. We find ourselves, let me
[1:35:53] say something. John never became less
[1:35:57] than John.
[1:35:59] Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; While he was saying, "Behold the lamb of
[1:36:03] God," he was John. And when he was in
[1:36:06] prison, saying, "See if it's him." He's
[1:36:08] still John.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; He was a prophet before and he's a
[1:36:12] prophet there.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Phantom said the prophets are
[1:36:18] neurotics.
[1:36:20] They get so high in the inspiration.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Then they come down out of the
[1:36:25] inspiration and they they they have a
[1:36:29] completely different mental process
[1:36:31] happening because they feel, you know,
[1:36:34] the inspiration is gone. You have a
[1:36:37] Saturday night at camp or you have a
[1:36:40] prayer meeting here in the church or or
[1:36:42] you have a service here and it's it's
[1:36:44] such an inspiration.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; The inspiration can depart.
[1:36:50] and and circumstances can come against
[1:36:52] you
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; and trials and Satan can come with all
[1:36:56] his forces against you and you just
[1:36:59] wonder is there any way out?
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; How can I get out of this?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus said, "And blessed is he
[1:37:11] who's not offended
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; in me.
[1:37:14] [Applause]
[1:37:16] Amen.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; John had been filled with the baptism of
[1:37:22] the Holy Spirit when he was still uh uh
[1:37:26] in his mother's womb.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; He had experienced all of these dramatic
[1:37:30] events which we've just spoken of a wee
[1:37:32] bit.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; And his ministry was with such power
[1:37:36] that the multitudes were literally
[1:37:38] attracted to him. The Bible says that
[1:37:41] all of Judea and all the region around
[1:37:44] about Jordan, mobs just came.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; We just saw a picture and and uh and
[1:37:50] brother David has a a street full of
[1:37:53] people, but he was moving a whole
[1:37:55] nation.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Imagine how he felt
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; and what a reality. This is it.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; I felt it. I I had such an inspiration.
[1:38:07] I was drunk on the spirit. Think of the
[1:38:09] people in the upper room. They came out
[1:38:12] of the upper room totally drunk on the
[1:38:14] Holy Spirit.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; But it was for a purpose.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; It was for a greater work.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; they didn't have that every Sunday or
[1:38:23] every Sabbath day.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; And then the adversity set up.
[1:38:31] The Bible even says of Jesus, "And when
[1:38:34] John had heard in the prison of the
[1:38:37] works of Christ, he sent two of his
[1:38:40] disciples
[1:38:42] and said go and ask him."
[1:38:45] And uh
[1:38:48] he said Jesus said the blind
[1:38:52] tell him he went. Now what he did?
[1:38:55] Watch it closely. Jesus
[1:38:58] went back to his vindication.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; He went back to the beginnings.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; He went back to the proof of the
[1:39:07] ministry.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Said, tell them the lame
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; are healed
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; and the blind receive their sight and
[1:39:15] the lame walk
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; and lepers are cleansed and the deaf
[1:39:19] hear. And now 2,000 years after this was
[1:39:24] written comes an end time messenger
[1:39:27] preaching in Chicago and he preaches the
[1:39:30] forgotten. Here's the forgotten
[1:39:32] beatitude and blessed are is he who's
[1:39:36] not offended in me. It wasn't that John
[1:39:38] was offended in Christ but the offense
[1:39:41] is has a different meaning which I will
[1:39:44] relate to you. It's it's as though a
[1:39:48] stumbling block or an impediment,
[1:39:51] something comes into your life that's an
[1:39:54] impediment to what God is doing.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; It it could be something that would
[1:40:00] cause a person to begin to distrust or
[1:40:04] to desert one to desert one whom he
[1:40:10] ought to trust and obey. John was now
[1:40:13] reassessing. He was re-evaluating
[1:40:17] what had happened.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Is it all really is it is it really that
[1:40:22] true?
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; I I made all these declarations, but it
[1:40:26] seemed as though that the the uh trouble
[1:40:30] that had come upon him.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Was now draining that out of him.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; And you know what I'm talking about.
[1:40:38] You've all been there because you've
[1:40:41] been up on the mountain heights and then
[1:40:43] you get down so low and say, "Is it
[1:40:46] real?" I know what I re I I was while I
[1:40:48] was studying this service,
[1:40:51] I remember seeing a young man. He's not
[1:40:54] here today. He's not even serving God
[1:40:56] today, but he said here at the when the
[1:40:59] young people were giving testimony such
[1:41:01] as they did Wednesday, he stood right
[1:41:03] here. He said, "You know, I often, you
[1:41:05] know, I desired to be filled with the
[1:41:07] Holy Spirit." And he said, "And I
[1:41:08] thought I had the baptism of the Holy
[1:41:10] Spirit." But he says, "Now I know I have
[1:41:13] the baptism of the Holy Spirit." Well,
[1:41:16] unfortunately, he's not here. He need to
[1:41:18] hear this service.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; I hope he does hear it.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; I don't know what God did, but all I'm
[1:41:25] saying to you is that that great moment
[1:41:29] of inspiration, excitement, don't count
[1:41:32] on that moment. That moment is only
[1:41:35] there to carry you to a greater work.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; The greater work is to be able to come
[1:41:42] into a prison and not allow the prison
[1:41:45] to break you down.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Here's a shocker for you. Brother
[1:41:56] Brandham says Jesus did not give him a
[1:41:59] book of rules
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; on how to be patient in prison.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't even deliver him from
[1:42:06] prison.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; He gave him he sent and and and what he
[1:42:12] did was confirm
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; that the call that he had and the one
[1:42:16] that called him is the same. It's Jesus
[1:42:19] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:42:22] forever.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; He's the same. are inside the prison as
[1:42:27] he is outside of the prison.
[1:42:30] The power of the Holy Spirit can help
[1:42:32] you to live in prison.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus never delivered him from prison.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Never took him out. He died there.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; But he died in victory.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; That is the greater work.
[1:42:54] It needed to be in the Bible that he was
[1:42:56] beheaded.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; It needed to be in the word of God.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; And he remained faithful till they took
[1:43:02] his head off.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he never lost his faith
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; that this is the Messiah.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; I don't care what happens. I don't care
[1:43:12] what people do. I can say one thing.
[1:43:14] This is this ministry and this message
[1:43:17] came by Elijah the prophet.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:26] But Satan and God will even allow Satan
[1:43:29] to bring things your way
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; and into your life.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Whether by friends or by family or by
[1:43:36] this or by that or by circumstances or
[1:43:39] by job or by education or by pleasure or
[1:43:42] whatever more. He'll try to bring things
[1:43:45] your way.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; If he thinks that success will take you,
[1:43:49] he'll he'll bring you success. If he
[1:43:51] thinks that poverty will bring it, he'll
[1:43:54] bring you poverty. But God can bring you
[1:43:57] through success. He can bring you
[1:43:59] through poverty. He can bring you He can
[1:44:02] bring you to be uh steadfast amongst the
[1:44:05] people. He can bring you to be steadfast
[1:44:07] alone.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with, you know,
[1:44:14] having a big comm camaraderie and all of
[1:44:16] that. It's wonderful, but we there are
[1:44:19] times when you don't have it. And you
[1:44:21] have to stand alone.
[1:44:24] [Applause]
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; I talked to a man this last week
[1:44:33] and he's facing some real issues.
[1:44:39] He's not part of this church.
[1:44:44] We had prayer with him
[1:44:47] and I said to him,
[1:44:49] he knows about the message.
[1:44:53] He has family in this church.
[1:44:56] And I just related my own testimony.
[1:45:00] And I told him, I said, "I've stood
[1:45:03] where you are. I've been there."
[1:45:06] And after we had prayer, I spent about
[1:45:07] an hour, hour and a half with them. I
[1:45:09] said, "There's you know what you need to
[1:45:11] do? You need to jump off the cliff.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; You need to be prepared
[1:45:22] to separate from all other
[1:45:24] relationships.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; This is not between you and your family
[1:45:28] and God. This is not between you and
[1:45:31] your friends and God. This is between
[1:45:33] you and God.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; And when God speaks, you jump off the
[1:45:38] cliff. I'm not doing I'm not doing this
[1:45:43] for anyone else.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; And blessed is he whosoever
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; is not offended in me.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; So the offense was was the things that
[1:45:56] did not turn out right for John.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; That was the offense.
[1:46:02] And brother Brandham says, and I'm going
[1:46:04] to uh
[1:46:08] go to what he said specifically in the
[1:46:11] forgotten biatitude.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "But when trouble set in,
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; there isn't a man or woman or young
[1:46:22] person here, but what either has or is
[1:46:26] experiencing or will experience. I'm not
[1:46:29] taking away anything from what God has
[1:46:31] done for you,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; but what I am doing as a watchman saying
[1:46:36] down the road, I may be able to see a
[1:46:38] little further than some of the young
[1:46:40] people or the or or others, but that's
[1:46:43] that's my position. That's my office to
[1:46:45] look down the road
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; when trouble does come.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Because trouble does set in.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; And these are troublesome times. And
[1:46:56] when trouble does set in, he said Jesus
[1:46:59] came and showed Jesus came and showed
[1:47:02] the Messiah that he was the Messiah.
[1:47:05] John saw that. John heard that. He says,
[1:47:08] "But then something went wrong." Brother
[1:47:11] Bham says something went wrong.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; What you when I what I'm preaching here
[1:47:16] now today is when something goes wrong,
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; at least you think it's gone wrong.
[1:47:25] Come on.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; It may not be wrong. It might be right.
[1:47:28] Who Who says it's wrong?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; As brother Tom preached. Who says it's
[1:47:32] bad?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Who says it's bad?
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Who says it's wrong?
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; John thought it was wrong.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; And that that allowed that made way for
[1:47:46] the offense.
[1:47:48] not offended in the sense that we think
[1:47:50] of being offended, but in in the an
[1:47:53] offense in the in the way that it became
[1:47:56] like a a stumbling block to him.
[1:47:58] Something's gone wrong.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; He said John had introduced the Messiah
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; with a fan in his hand and going to burn
[1:48:08] up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
[1:48:12] But he found out and he found out the
[1:48:16] works of Jesus. He was meek
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; and he was lowly
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; and so it wearied him.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, we get out boldly. We
[1:48:29] may go out on the streets and we may
[1:48:32] speak to our family and you've preached
[1:48:34] to your relatives and to your friends.
[1:48:37] You said, "This is it. Hallelujah." And
[1:48:40] you're just you're so bold with it. And
[1:48:43] I was at a meeting. I was in a prayer
[1:48:45] meeting. I was in our church. Oh, you
[1:48:47] should have heard it.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like this message. And
[1:48:51] then things come against you and come
[1:48:53] against you and this and it's not, you
[1:48:55] know, a jail hasn't got one bar. It's
[1:48:58] got one after the other
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; and you find yourself completely
[1:49:02] enclosed.
[1:49:04] And then you begin to wonder
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; if what you declared
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; with such power
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; and that this this word is the answer
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; and there's no message like it. Then you
[1:49:14] begin to wonder where is the power? It
[1:49:17] seems so weak and seems so lowly and it
[1:49:20] seems so, you know, like it hasn't got
[1:49:22] the strength I declared it did have.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; And that allows for it starting to be a
[1:49:30] stumbling block to you.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Reach it. Come on.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; And then Satan has all kinds of other
[1:49:37] things to throw out as an attraction.
[1:49:39] And a person becomes, as someone
[1:49:41] preached here not long ago, distracted.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:49:47] maybe it's so maybe it's here. Well, or
[1:49:49] maybe just become wearied. As he said,
[1:49:51] he got wearied
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; and he was so weak and lowly that it
[1:49:56] wearied him. He didn't know what to say.
[1:50:01] And he thought here's a prophet. Think
[1:50:04] of it now. Elijah here talking about
[1:50:08] Elijah there.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; That nice, brother Kyle.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; I guess Elijah, the spirit of Elijah
[1:50:18] knows what Elijah went through.
[1:50:22] The second this Elijah speaking about
[1:50:25] that Elijah
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; and he said and he thought now there's
[1:50:30] something that's gone wrong somewhere.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; It seemed that he believed the wrong
[1:50:38] thing.
[1:50:41] It seemed like he wasn't working right.
[1:50:44] And there's many times how many times
[1:50:48] many times
[1:50:51] Say it many times.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; That we think it too.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; I see you smiling.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; He says we think it too that it isn't
[1:51:11] working right.
[1:51:14] I'm glad I can say a prophet spoke thus
[1:51:17] sayeth the Lord.
[1:51:19] But it's working, right?
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; As long as we know that he's here,
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; what difference does it make?
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Whether you're in difficult times,
[1:51:32] whether things are going backwards,
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; whether it be sickness or finances or
[1:51:38] whatever more,
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; if working right, as long as you know
[1:51:43] that he's here,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; as long as you know this is the word,
[1:51:48] This is the message.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; And if I say this isn't the message,
[1:51:52] tell me where it is.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Tell me where it is.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Tell me where there's a message that has
[1:52:00] revealed
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; with such clarity.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; You can't find it anywhere.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; As long as we know that he's here, what
[1:52:16] difference does it make? It's working
[1:52:18] right.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Maybe it ain't working according to the
[1:52:22] way we think it ought to work, but it's
[1:52:25] working according to the way God wants
[1:52:28] it to work.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Agree with that, please.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; It's working the way God wants it to
[1:52:35] work.
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:56] repair.
[1:53:01] He said, "John thought, well, now I
[1:53:06] introduced a Messiah that had a fan in
[1:53:09] his hand, and he's going to purge the
[1:53:12] floors and take his wheat into the
[1:53:14] garner, and I told him the axe was laid
[1:53:17] to the root of the tree, and he's going
[1:53:20] to take all the trash and burn it up."
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; And here it is. Instead of a great
[1:53:24] mighty man like that, here he comes,
[1:53:27] meek and lowly. Something must have went
[1:53:30] wrong somewhere.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; You see
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; the future
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; from what he expected
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; and what he had declared.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't wrong. It was only wrong
[1:53:43] in his own thinking because he had a
[1:53:46] certain expectation
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't happening according to his
[1:53:50] expectation.
[1:53:51] Let let's leave our expectation in the
[1:53:54] hands of God.
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:53:59] Whether I'm healthy or sick,
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; whether I live or die,
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; whether I'm out of prison or in prison,
[1:54:07] I know one thing.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Christ
[1:54:10] is here.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ is here. And don't
[1:54:16] ever be moved from that one truth.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Christ, I have Christ.
[1:54:22] I have a message that came that was
[1:54:25] confirmed
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; by the almighty God.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; I had a message that I have a message. I
[1:54:32] was birthed
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; into a message that God thought so much
[1:54:37] of he wouldn't leave it for one single
[1:54:39] moment.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:45] the message you believe.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Almighty God,
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; creator of heavens and earth,
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; he would not leave this word.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Why should we leave it?
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; You can't find a single time.
[1:55:02] And I would encourage you to take what
[1:55:04] got me in into this channel.
[1:55:09] I was I was just hungering.
[1:55:12] I've seen supernatural things. I just
[1:55:14] thought, you know, we
[1:55:17] must have that.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; And so I I thought I'm going to listen
[1:55:22] to a series of services.
[1:55:24] And I knew that I was with the brother
[1:55:26] Brandham in May of 1961.
[1:55:29] So I thought, well, I'll just go back
[1:55:32] maybe a month prior to that. And there
[1:55:34] was a series in Chicago and it starts
[1:55:37] out with
[1:55:39] uh
[1:55:41] I think Micaiah the prophet
[1:55:44] then only believe
[1:55:47] and uh uh about three or four services
[1:55:52] and then the next service ends up in
[1:55:55] Grand Prairie when I was there and had
[1:55:58] set up that meeting for him. And then he
[1:56:00] went from Grand Prairie, we went to
[1:56:02] Dawson Creek.
[1:56:04] But he laid it out.
[1:56:06] It wasn't exactly what many of the
[1:56:08] ministers perhaps wanted to hear.
[1:56:12] But in one of the services especially
[1:56:15] is really remarkable. And then they've
[1:56:17] forgotten beatitude is is one that
[1:56:20] squeezed in there and only believe.
[1:56:23] And they are ultra simplistic
[1:56:26] in one way. And he just said, he
[1:56:29] described what Jesus was.
[1:56:32] And he said, "Now, wouldn't it be
[1:56:34] reasonable if we if we found out what he
[1:56:38] was
[1:56:39] and if we do believe that he's the same
[1:56:41] yesterday and today and forever."
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "If we found that he did the
[1:56:47] same things today, if we if we say that
[1:56:50] he's here, then he should do the same
[1:56:52] things."
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Now, friends, we can rejoice in that and
[1:56:55] we can also be convicted by that. I was
[1:56:58] convicted. I say, "I don't see all the
[1:57:00] same things. I don't see the number.
[1:57:02] I've seen supernatural things, but I am
[1:57:05] not satisfied.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; I want to see more."
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; And if we're not seeing it, I want to
[1:57:12] know why we're not seeing it.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; And if there's anything that we have to
[1:57:16] do that I have to do, that we as a
[1:57:18] church have to do.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; And then then to hear that God begins to
[1:57:23] break upon the young people, I say, "God
[1:57:25] bless you young people.
[1:57:27] Hallelujah.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Stay consecrated.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Stay fervent.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; And you'll show others the way.
[1:57:35] [Music]
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; I'm challenging you.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; If I can't get it, you'll get it.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Show us the way.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; I'm laying on a challenge to you.
[1:57:56] Hallelujah.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; If you were so moved with brother Dig's
[1:58:00] service and showeth us the way.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Continue on.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; I'm still here.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Trouble came my way.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Trouble set in.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; But I'm still here.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Satan threw everything at me.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] He gave me the greatest opportunity, but
[1:58:25] I saw it was going to take me away from
[1:58:27] God. I denied it because he's still
[1:58:30] here.
[1:58:34] Satan wanted me to sell my gift,
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; wanted to sell my testimony, but I
[1:58:40] denied him by the power of the Holy
[1:58:43] Spirit, and I'm still here.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; to me. That's the greater works.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; When you can go through a long, dark,
[1:58:59] hard spell
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; and come out the other end of the tunnel
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; and say, "Brother Ed, I'm still here.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; You've seen what I went through.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:59:22] You don't have to be an old man with
[1:59:24] white hair such as I am to have these
[1:59:26] things.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; You can have these things.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:59:41] said he became John became dismayed
[1:59:45] like many of us do when we see things
[1:59:47] going on that going on that isn't what
[1:59:50] we thought think it it just right we
[1:59:55] become dismayed
[1:59:57] he said don't be weary
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; saying to us
[2:00:01] it will be all right
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; he said the devil got a hold of him in
[2:00:04] there
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; and the devil thought.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet's telling what the devil
[2:00:09] thought.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; He thought now I've got him in jail now.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; He sometimes gets you in a place where
[2:00:16] you can't hardly wiggle.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Says, "I got you in jail now."
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I throw him in jail, so
[2:00:22] I'll rough him up real good." And I got
[2:00:25] him in there. He said, "God isn't using
[2:00:28] him right now. I got him in jail, so
[2:00:32] I'll just put every kind of a blanket
[2:00:34] over him that I can. I got him all caged
[2:00:37] up. Said he got the eagle in the cage.
[2:00:41] So I'll just make him wish he had never
[2:00:44] preached the gospel.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; I'll make him wish he never said he was
[2:00:51] saved.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; I'll make him wish he never even
[2:00:54] testified about the camp experience.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; See, John had his camp experience, but
[2:01:00] it's the other end of it.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; You all know about the camp experience.
[2:01:04] John had his Mount Baker cab experience,
[2:01:07] but this is the other end of it.
[2:01:10] [Music]
[2:01:10] [Applause]
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; And all the time, John is still John.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; He's still a prophet.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; And that's why Jesus said when he was at
[2:01:20] his lowest moment, Jesus raised him to
[2:01:23] his highest.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; And he said to the people, "What'd you
[2:01:26] go out to hear? Who did you go out to
[2:01:28] see? A man in soft raignment?" Not John.
[2:01:33] Oh, it wasn't greater. He come with
[2:01:35] camel hair eating uh eating wild honey
[2:01:39] and locust.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; But he's still the same John.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; He had the big crowds and he baptized
[2:01:48] multitudes and baptized Jesus.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is saying there's no man like
[2:01:55] John.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; No greater had ever been born of woman.
[2:01:59] And there John is questioning him
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; when he was at his lowest moment
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; friends. I'm telling you,
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; I'm declaring to you that God's thought
[2:02:11] of you
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; will not change one iota.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Whether you're whether you're on the
[2:02:17] ground or whether you're in the
[2:02:18] stratosphere.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; He won't change.
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:28] [Applause]
[2:02:30] Glory to God.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; In Micah, Malcia the prophet, he said
[2:02:44] how people become offended in Jesus
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; and John had become. He didn't express
[2:02:50] it in that way, but kind of offended
[2:02:53] because the things didn't go just the
[2:02:56] way he thought it ought to because he
[2:02:59] introduced Jesus as Christ the Messiah.
[2:03:02] He says, "And so he couldn't hardly
[2:03:04] understand what was." And listen, I'll
[2:03:07] just say right here to anybody that's
[2:03:09] walked along this message highway for
[2:03:12] any amount of time, I can guarantee you
[2:03:15] that you could agree with me. Things
[2:03:17] didn't turn out just exactly the way you
[2:03:20] thought they were going.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; You encountered stuff you never thought
[2:03:25] you'd ever encounter.
[2:03:27] But I will say to you
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; that the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; that called you
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; to this message,
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; he's the same one that vindicated this
[2:03:36] message
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; and he's still here.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; If he won't leave that message
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; and you are that embodiment of the
[2:03:45] message and he will not leave it,
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; he will not leave it.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; No circumstance
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; in this world can change God's mind.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; I don't care if all hell comes against
[2:04:01] you.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; He will not leave this message.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; That's one thing I can say to you.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; He will not leave it.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; And you need that confidence.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; He will not leave this message.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; And if you stay with the message, you're
[2:04:24] staying with him. Amen.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Just don't leave it.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; So Jesus didn't give John instructions
[2:04:39] on how to be patient in prison. He said
[2:04:41] Jesus never sent him any book. Here's
[2:04:44] how to have patience while you're in
[2:04:47] jail.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Let that sink in.
[2:04:51] Yeah.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; You get in your prison,
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; he's not going to just make things
[2:04:57] easier in your prison.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; And he may not deliver you out of it.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; The reason I say, "Oh, you say surely
[2:05:06] because this surely he doesn't want me
[2:05:08] in bound in this thing." He may not. But
[2:05:10] just in case, you stay there.
[2:05:13] Just in case the circumstances don't go
[2:05:15] away the way you think they ought to go
[2:05:17] away,
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; your thought of your con your
[2:05:22] conviction, your uh confession of where
[2:05:26] you are and what happened to you must
[2:05:29] never change.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; John, even even when the guillotine was
[2:05:34] going to come down across his head, he
[2:05:37] could have said, "That's still him.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; That's still him.
[2:05:42] What I spoke is still true.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; He's still the Christ.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of different things.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Don't let me dwell on this too long, but
[2:06:03] there's a lot of different things that
[2:06:06] can become
[2:06:08] a literal jailhouse.
[2:06:14] Doors of opportunity.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; They made it look like doors of
[2:06:19] opportunity, but it actually might be a
[2:06:20] door,
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; you know. Yes, sir.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; into a prison.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; And I have seen people, I could count
[2:06:30] them, I could name them,
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; that have gone the way of opportunity
[2:06:35] and ended up in jail.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:06:42] I talked to one person who had a high
[2:06:45] position in one of the software
[2:06:48] companies
[2:06:50] and we I said oh you work there. Yeah.
[2:06:53] He said in the velvet prison
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; I said pardon? He said we all call it
[2:06:59] the velvet prison.
[2:07:02] They just you couldn't live better.
[2:07:05] Oh, the food and all the perks and
[2:07:08] everything else, but you are completely
[2:07:11] swallowed up
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; timewise. No time for family, no time
[2:07:16] for children, no time for wife. That's
[2:07:18] against the word of God.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; And the man lost his family.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Lost his family because he was in a
[2:07:27] velvet prison. But you know, so Satan
[2:07:31] made his prison so nice.
[2:07:33] Oh, how how how could I leave how can I
[2:07:35] leave this kind of celery?
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; How do I leave all these perks?
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; How can I leave this? I can't leave
[2:07:43] this.
[2:07:44] But while he can't leave that,
[2:07:47] completely leave his spiritual life,
[2:07:49] completely leave God, completely leave
[2:07:51] the wife and family until they just
[2:07:54] disappear.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Is that success? That's failure.
[2:08:01] Come on,
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; friends.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Soon as people start
[2:08:11] the message starts to the revelation of
[2:08:13] it starts to get to them.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Oh man, you know, what is my wife going
[2:08:17] to do? What is my husband? What is my
[2:08:20] That's when you have to jump off the
[2:08:21] cliff.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; God's not dealing with the whole family.
[2:08:26] God's talking to you.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:30] He may call you to a mountain. He may
[2:08:32] call you to a desert. He may call you to
[2:08:34] the city. He may call you to the great
[2:08:36] crowds. He may call you to just nothing
[2:08:38] to be alone. It that's irrelevant.
[2:08:41] That's none of our business.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; It's his business.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; What he made real to you. You say it's
[2:08:47] still real. It's still real.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Is it real, young people?
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; What you experience is still real.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; You confess that it's still real.
[2:08:59] Hallelujah.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; You may not feel the same. We say, "He's
[2:09:04] the same."
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Yesterday.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; And today.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Yesterday
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; and today and forever.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; He'll never change.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; He'll never leave it.
[2:09:21] [Applause]
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Friends and family and relationship.
[2:09:27] friends.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, get it.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Who's a friend?
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends,
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; I call you friends.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus called his disciples friends.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; They stayed with him
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; through everything. Amen.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; They stayed with him when he had
[2:09:53] thousands in front of him
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; and they just became servants and served
[2:09:57] bread and baskets of food and picked up
[2:10:00] the fragments that remained and didn't
[2:10:02] do a whole lot of great things. And then
[2:10:04] he he he's speaking of great things that
[2:10:06] are happening. He says, "What shall we
[2:10:08] have?" He'll say, "You sit with me."
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; You'll sit on 12 thrones.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; And our prophet now comes Elijah and
[2:10:16] says, "You sit with him." Amen.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; The bride sits with the bridegroom.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; The bride sits with her husband.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; In the kingdom.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, my friends,
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; we're just on a little short journey.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; But I have I have the message that God
[2:10:36] confirmed and said through a messenger.
[2:10:39] And after he says things like that, he
[2:10:41] starts calling people by name.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Well, who is it? William Brandham
[2:10:44] doesn't know their name. It's God that
[2:10:47] knows their name. God knows your name.
[2:10:51] And I was I was just stunned once again
[2:10:54] as I listened
[2:10:56] because John sent God Jesus sent back to
[2:11:00] John
[2:11:01] really his first and second pole
[2:11:03] ministry the vindication
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; and when I thought of the vindication
[2:11:07] and so I was listening particular to
[2:11:10] that
[2:11:12] and I thought
[2:11:15] God that's you
[2:11:18] this man doesn't know that crowd.
[2:11:21] He calls people and says,
[2:11:24] "You have something wrong with your
[2:11:26] back.
[2:11:28] You're praying for someone.
[2:11:31] It's a child.
[2:11:34] You're praying for another person. It's
[2:11:37] a woman and it's your wife and she has
[2:11:41] heart trouble." And some of the times
[2:11:42] the things seemed so insignificant and I
[2:11:45] thought, God,
[2:11:48] are you that concerned?
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; I've lost sight of that.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Ah, brother Ed Biscll, I've lost sight
[2:11:55] of that. I thought you're just maybe
[2:11:58] concerned about big things and you know
[2:12:01] doing things in missions or big things
[2:12:04] at the church or not just big things but
[2:12:07] you know all the burdens and solving
[2:12:09] this and solving that but he's
[2:12:11] interested in the small things.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; You you've even got a pain
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; or you've got a sickness. You're not
[2:12:21] feeling well.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; He's here. Amen.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; He's here. And if he wanted to prove
[2:12:27] that to you,
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; he'd prove that that's what I did.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; And if you will believe it,
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; I'll do the same now.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; If you'll believe it,
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; I'll do the same now.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; And one of the meetings, you can listen.
[2:12:43] He said, "There was a woman that brought
[2:12:47] a baby." Now, he's talking about the
[2:12:51] forgotten biatitude.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's his current sermon, the
[2:12:55] forgotten biatitude. Only preach it
[2:12:57] once. Go and listen to it.
[2:13:00] And he said a woman brought a baby and
[2:13:02] the baby had a twisted leg up behind it
[2:13:07] and was lame.
[2:13:10] And he said
[2:13:13] she wanted me to pray for it. And I
[2:13:17] prayed for it.
[2:13:20] And she went and told her husband and
[2:13:22] said they were so happy
[2:13:26] and then she came back
[2:13:29] and said, "Brother Brandham." Now she's
[2:13:31] where John was
[2:13:34] first. She had her Mount Baker
[2:13:36] experience. Oh, I I I got Brother
[2:13:40] Brandham. I got in front of him and and
[2:13:42] he prayed for my baby
[2:13:44] and she went away.
[2:13:47] Nothing happened.
[2:13:49] And then she had John's prison
[2:13:51] experience.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; And she come back and she said, "Brother
[2:13:56] Brandham, nothing happened."
[2:14:00] And he just said, "Well,
[2:14:03] you know, it's it's it's all right." And
[2:14:08] he said, "You asked me to pray for it."
[2:14:10] I did.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; And she started to leave and go away.
[2:14:16] and she turned around and said,
[2:14:19] "Is it God's will for my baby to be
[2:14:22] lame?"
[2:14:24] And he said, "No, it certainly isn't
[2:14:26] God's will for your baby to be laid
[2:14:29] lame." And she said, "That's what she
[2:14:32] wanted him to say.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; That's what she wanted to hear."
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; And it was just that one thing. And that
[2:14:38] leg came down. The baby was healed.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Does that sister happen to
[2:14:42] be here in the service?" And she stands
[2:14:45] up. He says, "Well, there she is there.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; There's the sister there."
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Now, he said, "There was another woman."
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "This woman is some years
[2:14:55] ago." And he said, "The woman had a
[2:15:00] huge
[2:15:02] tumor hanging outside of her body on her
[2:15:04] stomach and couldn't walk because of the
[2:15:08] size of the tumor. And the deacons had
[2:15:10] to pack her
[2:15:15] And he said they brought her up for
[2:15:16] prayer
[2:15:18] and God healed her and the tumor
[2:15:21] disappeared. And he said he uses the
[2:15:24] word smooth and she just became so
[2:15:26] smooth,
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; It was gone.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; I wonder if that woman is here
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; there. There she is way at the back. He
[2:15:35] said, "Sister, why don't you stand out
[2:15:38] in the aisle?" So she stood out in the
[2:15:41] aisle. He said, "Open up your coat." She
[2:15:44] opens up her coat. He says, "See there.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Just smooth as can be.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; The tumor is gone."
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; And he's pointing out what he was,
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; he still is.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; And how long ago is that? 10, 12 years
[2:16:01] ago, he did it then.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; And he's going to do it now in a few
[2:16:06] minutes. Hallelujah.
[2:16:09] I said to myself, if we can just get our
[2:16:12] own people to believe, he did it 2,000
[2:16:15] years ago, he did it 40 years ago, and
[2:16:18] he do it tonight. He do it today. It's
[2:16:21] exactly the same. There's nothing
[2:16:23] impossible.
[2:16:25] [Music]
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; And we must not short change oursel.
[2:16:30] Believe to that.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Believe unto that.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; You're going to need it sometime.
[2:16:40] Amen.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Then he said there was another person
[2:16:46] and he said Rosella
[2:16:49] alcoholic.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said,
[2:16:54] "Rosella, are you here in the meeting?"
[2:16:56] Here's right close to the front. He
[2:16:58] says, "Here she is right here." He
[2:16:59] called five people.
[2:17:02] He called five people for five
[2:17:03] testimonies and they were all in the
[2:17:06] meeting. All right.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; And that was powerful for me.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; And he said, he said, "Excuse me, Sister
[2:17:13] Rosella, but he said, when you came up,
[2:17:14] you were just a bad eyed old witch."
[2:17:20] I thought, "My for God's grace."
[2:17:24] And he says, "And here she is, a
[2:17:26] beautiful woman," he says. And she's
[2:17:28] probably she she looks 20 years younger
[2:17:31] than she actually is. Amen.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; That was I thought God give grace to
[2:17:37] Rosella.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; And years ago, Alcoholics Anonymous gave
[2:17:45] her up. Mother and Father gave her up.
[2:17:48] Family gave her up. You talk about a
[2:17:50] jail. But God brought them out of that
[2:17:53] jail.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; God's greater. Amen.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; He came to give deliverance
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; to those that were in prison.
[2:18:05] [Applause]
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; So Jesus said to the disciples of John,
[2:18:17] just stay and watch this service.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; And see what's happening.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Watch this afternoon's meeting
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; and then go back and tell John what's
[2:18:26] happening. and and
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; and
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; blessed is he
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; who's not offended in me.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't happen the way you think
[2:18:38] it should happen, remember this last
[2:18:41] beatitude.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; It's been rediscovered.
[2:18:46] [Music]
[2:18:47] [Applause]
[2:18:48] [Music]
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if it didn't happen the
[2:18:51] way we thought it was going to happen.
[2:18:53] Life didn't turn out the way we thought
[2:18:54] it was going to turn out. All you need
[2:18:56] to know, all you need to be able to say
[2:18:59] is he is here.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; He's revealed himself.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; And I was birthed
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; not into a lodge, not into a church, not
[2:19:10] into a denomination. I was birthed into
[2:19:13] Christ.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; I was birthed
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; in the very voice of God.
[2:19:24] Oh, you ought to say, "Thank you, Lord,
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; for such a worm as I
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; that you called me
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; to be birthed under this visitation.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; You called me under this vindication."
[2:19:39] And on that basis, I say you're the same
[2:19:43] yesterday, today, this morning.
[2:19:47] Hallelujah. February 13th, 2011. You're
[2:19:52] the same. Hallelujah. Increase my faith.
[2:19:56] Help our preacher to increase my faith.
[2:19:59] Oh God.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:06] [Applause]
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:14] Hallelujah.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; So, some of the young people are up
[2:20:21] here.
[2:20:24] I was once young, too.
[2:20:29] I was 14.
[2:20:33] And we were in a little house.
[2:20:36] And a preacher's son right beside me
[2:20:42] the pastor's son and we were at two
[2:20:45] kitchen chairs just kneeling
[2:20:50] after the service
[2:20:53] and uh old brother McGriff
[2:20:57] but just visiting
[2:20:59] and all I remember he just came he laid
[2:21:01] his hand on my back I think he laid his
[2:21:03] hand on my friend's back laid his hand
[2:21:06] on my back and he said and he started to
[2:21:08] break down he just started which she
[2:21:11] often did. He's very soft and he just
[2:21:12] kind of broke down and says, "Oh, God,
[2:21:15] make Eddie a preacher." And at those
[2:21:18] words,
[2:21:20] I just I just went in fragments. I just
[2:21:23] collapsed. I just split open and I
[2:21:27] sobbed and sobbed and sobbed. I didn't I
[2:21:30] didn't have any desire to be a preacher.
[2:21:32] I I didn't know what I was going to be.
[2:21:35] And uh
[2:21:37] but but I never forgot that. never
[2:21:40] forgot that there are things that happen
[2:21:42] in your life you never forget.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; You just remember them all the time.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; It might be the most,
[2:21:50] you know, almost coincidental. It just I
[2:21:52] happened to be there. He happened to be
[2:21:54] there and and and the and the boy that
[2:21:58] was beside me, he was about a year older
[2:21:59] than me. And we we were like brothers.
[2:22:03] He became very successful right in this
[2:22:05] city.
[2:22:07] The town we were in was called
[2:22:08] Greenwood.
[2:22:10] If you just drive over here to Guilford
[2:22:14] Shopping Center and drive on 104th
[2:22:17] Avenue, you'll see a whole string of
[2:22:19] apartments. They're called the Greenwood
[2:22:22] Apartments cuz they were his. He became
[2:22:26] very successful.
[2:22:32] That was probably a couple bars in his
[2:22:34] jail.
[2:22:36] He then he married a Catholic girl and
[2:22:39] I'd say that's another couple bars
[2:22:43] and now he had a whole busy life
[2:22:46] successful business in real estate
[2:22:51] and he could debate. He had a mind twice
[2:22:54] the mind that I have and he could just
[2:22:57] debate the scriptures and find this
[2:23:00] little,
[2:23:01] you know, inconsistency in the scripture
[2:23:04] and this which seemed to be inconsistent
[2:23:08] in the scripture and something that
[2:23:10] wasn't working just right. And he'd
[2:23:14] raise those up and
[2:23:16] and I got a phone call. He was 39 years
[2:23:20] old
[2:23:22] and he's in a hospital with cancer
[2:23:27] and they don't expect him to live very
[2:23:29] long
[2:23:32] and suddenly he wanted to do something
[2:23:33] for young boys in trouble who had had a
[2:23:37] difficulty. He wanted to give a and a
[2:23:40] minister called me a Pentecostal
[2:23:41] minister. I think he's still living
[2:23:44] here. And he called and he said he he
[2:23:46] wants to give a quarter of a million
[2:23:47] dollars right away. You know, before he
[2:23:49] dies, he wants to give a quarter of a
[2:23:50] million to build a a place of like a
[2:23:53] farm for boys and young men. Help them
[2:23:57] out. Those that have had a hard life.
[2:23:59] Never got to do it. Died in just a short
[2:24:03] few days. Was gone. Life snuffed out.
[2:24:07] There were two chairs.
[2:24:11] I didn't make any big right choices.
[2:24:15] All I can tell you is that when finally
[2:24:19] God dealt with me,
[2:24:22] you young man, you listen real close.
[2:24:24] when God dealt with me and I knelt at an
[2:24:28] altar and I was about 17
[2:24:32] and I didn't have even what you had on
[2:24:35] on Saturday night out of the camp.
[2:24:39] But for me, that was it.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; I'm done.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; I just concluded right then, the devil's
[2:24:47] my enemy.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go his way. I didn't
[2:24:52] have a church like this to go to.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; I didn't have the message that you had.
[2:24:57] We didn't even know about the Godhead.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; We didn't know how to be baptized.
[2:25:02] We didn't know nothing. The rapture.
[2:25:05] It's out of our mind. We don't know
[2:25:06] anything about it. We're just totally
[2:25:08] ignorant people.
[2:25:10] But I knew one thing. I was done.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; I was done with the world.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; I'm finished.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; I didn't have any big ambitions. There
[2:25:20] was nothing happening out on the
[2:25:22] streets. I didn't have any message
[2:25:24] books. We didn't have any tapes to
[2:25:26] listen to.
[2:25:28] But I was done, brother Ernie. I was
[2:25:31] finished with the world.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; That's my challenge to you.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; I wasn't expecting a big Pentecostal
[2:25:42] thing the next night
[2:25:44] or a big hoopala the next day. I was
[2:25:48] done with the world. Amen.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; I was done with the devil.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; And I gave my life to Christ
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; and nothing has changed.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; Who's 17 here?
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Are you done?
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Are you done?
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Are you done?
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who else is 17? Girls,
[2:26:08] you're done. Amen. I didn't dream you
[2:26:12] were 17.
[2:26:16] Who's 18 and under? Raise your hands.
[2:26:19] way high.
[2:26:22] Hallelujah. Are you done with the world?
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; Even if you get to where John was.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Is it real? Is it really real? I said it
[2:26:31] was so real. Is it really real?
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it's real.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; Find me another message. Find me another
[2:26:40] Find me another messenger. Find me
[2:26:42] another one that God himself
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; would not leave his side.
[2:26:48] Preachers were against him. Businessmen
[2:26:50] were against him. Everybody forsook him.
[2:26:53] But God wouldn't forsake him.
[2:26:57] [Applause]
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; And God will honor your faith.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Alex said when they saw Matthew
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; and finally break through,
[2:27:17] That's God, Matthew.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; That's God.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday as he was in
[2:27:23] Mount Baker and he's the same today.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; And you might have a jail house
[2:27:28] experience.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, the jail will not
[2:27:32] change Jesus Christ.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; It will not change him.
[2:27:39] [Applause]
[2:27:40] [Music]
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; Sister Geneva and brother Matthew.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed. Don't be ashamed.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've got a wonderful son
[2:27:51] and you've got other wonderful sons and
[2:27:54] God knows them and God's heard every
[2:27:56] prayer you've prayed and those that have
[2:27:58] been prayed in this church and we stand
[2:28:01] with you.
[2:28:03] We care nothing about what the devil
[2:28:05] does. God might take them very low,
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; but all you have to say, we're in unity.
[2:28:12] My wife and I, we're in unity. We're in
[2:28:15] oneness. They belong to God.
[2:28:20] We're here to see things happen. We're
[2:28:22] not here to see just hear my sermons.
[2:28:25] We're here to see them happen.
[2:28:28] And I claim those boys with you in the
[2:28:31] name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:28:34] Hallelujah.
[2:28:37] Glory to God.
[2:28:39] We have every right to claim them. Ask
[2:28:42] what you will and it shall be done.
[2:28:55] [Music]
[2:28:58] [Applause]
[2:29:03] Hallelujah.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; This is an emotion. What a reality.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; What other messenger? What other
[2:29:13] message?
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; That's not Pentecost. It's not
[2:29:16] Presbyterian. It's nothing else.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; It's not Pentecost. God didn't God
[2:29:21] wouldn't allow his gift to be labeled.
[2:29:23] Right.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; And that's why he cries out in Chicago,
[2:29:26] cries out against them because they're
[2:29:28] so separated.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; And I want to say within this message,
[2:29:32] we shouldn't have this separation. We
[2:29:34] shouldn't be divided. This prophet spoke
[2:29:37] against it.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; I I I accept whatever blame I need to
[2:29:43] accept. But all I say is the word of God
[2:29:46] calls for blessed unity
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; and love for the brethren.
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:29:52] We don't embrace the world.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; If something's not the world,
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; and when I surrendered my life, I just
[2:29:59] have to go back because he's the same
[2:30:00] yesterday.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; As he was today, as he is today,
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; and my buddy went to the dance the
[2:30:10] following Saturday night. Broke my
[2:30:11] heart, but I had no desire for the
[2:30:14] dance.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; I said goodbye to the world.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; Goodbye to the devil. I said it when I
[2:30:20] was 20.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; I was about 21 years old. I have a car.
[2:30:25] I didn't even want a radio in the car.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; I bought a new car. I don't want a radio
[2:30:30] in the car.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; I drove into Vernon, British Columbia or
[2:30:34] Pentictton, British Columbia, filled up
[2:30:36] with gas and and banners on all the
[2:30:39] street lights and banners and the people
[2:30:41] in the party moved. And I drove in to
[2:30:44] get gas. And I I said, "What what's all
[2:30:48] the what's all the banners about?" He
[2:30:50] said, "The V's have come home."
[2:30:54] I said, "Who's the V's?" He almost
[2:30:56] punched me. He thought I was being, you
[2:31:00] know, being ridiculous. I don't know who
[2:31:02] the V's are. He said, "The V's. We've
[2:31:05] won the World Hockey Team or we've won
[2:31:08] world something." I I'm sorry. I don't I
[2:31:11] don't know anything about it. That was
[2:31:14] such an insult to him.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; But if he could have told me what just
[2:31:18] happened in Boisee, Idaho, I could have
[2:31:20] told him. I could have told him about
[2:31:22] the revival in Nampa, Idaho. I could
[2:31:25] have told him about so many people
[2:31:26] around the front, I couldn't even walk
[2:31:28] around them. I'm trying to find my way
[2:31:30] around repenting sinners.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; I knew what God was doing.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; And he's the same, Brother Daniel.
[2:31:42] He's the same.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach it
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; because I believe it
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; and you're going to see it happen.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; And he's able to do it even now, today.
[2:31:55] Now,
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; surrender it. Let it go.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; Sink or swim.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to serve God.
[2:32:11] When God sees that kind of dedication,
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; sir,
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; he moves.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; He moves.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; Might have been too long.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; See, brother also explained it, and I'm
[2:32:30] going to close in a few minutes. He
[2:32:32] explained it. He says when the like the
[2:32:34] prophets, he said they would explain
[2:32:35] when they go up into those spheres.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; He called it spheres. They go up into
[2:32:40] those spheres and it does something to
[2:32:42] the human heart.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; And when you come down, when you come
[2:32:47] down,
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; you get up into those spheres
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; where we make promises to God.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; I came out of a meeting in Edmonton,
[2:32:55] Alberta. I said, "I can never be the
[2:32:57] same. Ever be the same." Well, a few
[2:33:00] days later, I found out I was the same.
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; Found out I had the same problems.
[2:33:08] Hello.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; He says, "When you come down,
[2:33:13] when you come down, you can't explain
[2:33:16] it.
[2:33:18] You can't explain where you were.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; You can't explain this euphoria.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; You can't explain the glory of God.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; But don't deny it. It's still real."
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; And get all you can
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; and enjoy it. and give yourself to it.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; He said it takes you somewhere
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; and there's no need of trying to talk
[2:33:46] about it. And he then he went on to
[2:33:48] visions and so forth that tear you to
[2:33:50] pieces. You can't tell the other people.
[2:33:53] They don't understand it. They've never
[2:33:55] been there.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; So, how would you know about it?
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; When the inspiration leaves, he said,
[2:34:01] "And Elijah got nervous.
[2:34:08] You talk about inspiration.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; Says
[2:34:13] gets on the mountain, Mount Carmel.
[2:34:18] Showdown,
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; calling fire from heaven,
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; lick up all the
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; all the water.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; Slew 400 false prophets. Imagine it.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; I doubt if you'd want to follow that.
[2:34:30] Elijah
[2:34:32] said, a man killed 400 prophets.
[2:34:35] He slew them and had a mighty victory.
[2:34:38] And then he heard that a woman was out
[2:34:40] after his head at Jezebel and he ran out
[2:34:43] into the wilderness and asked to die.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Jonah preached in a city of Nineveh. And
[2:34:50] there's no record in the Bible of such a
[2:34:53] repentance. They even put sackcloth on
[2:34:55] all the animals and the cows.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; All the animals put sackloth on them and
[2:35:00] had such a repentance.
[2:35:04] Never was a repentance like that. A city
[2:35:06] of about 600,000 people and Jonah. And
[2:35:10] when he was done that the inspiration,
[2:35:12] he came down.
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; He ran out into the wilderness
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; and asked God to take his life.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; See,
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; one was the Mount Baker experience
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; and the other might be not that I wish
[2:35:26] it
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; but when it comes
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; remember this service
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; when trouble sets in.
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you find yourself in a
[2:35:34] jail, remember this service. It's the
[2:35:37] same message. Hallelujah. The same
[2:35:40] message that brought you in. The same
[2:35:43] vindication, the same Christ, the same
[2:35:46] reality, the same supernatural. He has
[2:35:49] not changed. He's the same. And if you
[2:35:51] can believe it, what you ask for, you
[2:35:53] can have it.
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; I'll close by saying this. God put a
[2:36:01] great conviction on me,
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; not just to preach an inspiration to
[2:36:05] you,
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; but to make a declaration
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; that this God
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; is prepared and ready to move now. And I
[2:36:13] have a responsibility to increase your
[2:36:16] faith
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; until you can believe it for now.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to believe it for next
[2:36:21] week. I want you to believe it for now.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; And that you can hear, that you can
[2:36:25] testify. And I went back in my youth. We
[2:36:28] didn't go to church to hear sermons. We
[2:36:30] went to church to see things happen.
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're supposed to be
[2:36:34] doing.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; This is not an idol God. We're to see
[2:36:37] things happen.
[2:36:39] [Applause]
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; I can I can I can
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; relate to brother
[2:36:46] Alex's joy.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; But it's not just joy,
[2:36:50] their prayer. Yes.
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; And Sister Bina
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; and then while the service was going on
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; out at the camp, he was having his
[2:36:59] service here by streaming
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; and he said and testified to those you
[2:37:03] those of you that were here Wednesday
[2:37:05] testified and he's in the middle of the
[2:37:08] uh middle of the floor. And what were
[2:37:10] you saying, Brother Alex?
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; I said, "Pour it down, Lord.
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; Pour it down. Pour it down."
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Did he pour it down? He
[2:37:18] poured it down.
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; Pour it down, Lord. Amen.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; I say tonight, this morning, pour it
[2:37:25] down.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; Let's not get so formal.
[2:37:32] Let's not have our services so
[2:37:34] structured we can't afford to have them
[2:37:37] pour it down.
[2:37:40] See it happen. Glory to God.
[2:37:44] I say now, pour it down, oh God,
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; and break prison doors,
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; and bring your people out of prison.
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; Let's rise to our feet, shall we?
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, how great is our God.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; How great is his name?
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; He's the mighty one.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
[2:38:08] and forever. Jesus, we've come here to
[2:38:10] give you praise. We've come here to give
[2:38:12] you glory. Hallelujah. We've come here
[2:38:16] to tell the people, Father, you're the
[2:38:18] same, oh God. Elijah never lost his
[2:38:21] identity. Jonah never lost his identity.
[2:38:24] John never lost his identity.
[2:38:26] Hallelujah. You're the same, oh God. And
[2:38:29] whatever state we find ourselves in at
[2:38:32] this moment, oh Lord, you're the God.
[2:38:36] You're the God of the situation. You're
[2:38:39] the almighty one. and we surrender
[2:38:41] ourselves to you. Whatever you have in
[2:38:44] store for us, Lord, if it was us, John,
[2:38:47] then we say, "Fine, oh God,
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; thy will be done.
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; Thy will be done."
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; We give you praise.
[2:39:00] [Applause]
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; Ask of me. He said, "Ask of me.
[2:39:07] [Music]
[2:39:10] Hallelujah.
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; I can say one thing.
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; There has been, and I'm going to praise
[2:39:21] God about it.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; There has been a great infilling of the
[2:39:24] Holy Spirit
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; taking place.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; It might be in your home. It might be in
[2:39:29] the church. It might be in the prayer
[2:39:31] service. I don't know where it is. It
[2:39:33] can be at the camp. A great infilling of
[2:39:36] the Holy Spirit. Some who have not been
[2:39:38] baptized,
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; we're baptized. I have that absolute
[2:39:42] confidence. Some have been baptized in
[2:39:46] the Holy Ghost.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; And once you're baptized, it's all
[2:39:49] finished.

[3:13:08] [Music]
[3:13:12] &gt;&gt; I just asked Joel.
[3:13:14] &gt;&gt; I just asked Joel where it started.
[3:13:21] Um well
[3:13:24] slowly uh over the last about 2 weeks
[3:13:28] probably God has slowly been just
[3:13:31] tugging feel a little tug
[3:13:34] and
[3:13:38] uh
[3:13:41] Wednesday especially
[3:13:44] I just I was at work and everything and
[3:13:49] you know something just made me before
[3:13:51] work I just got to my knees and I had to
[3:13:54] pray
[3:13:56] and I prayed for I prayed for everyone
[3:13:58] that's still out there
[3:14:01] prodigal my brother
[3:14:04] Andrew I prayed for everyone and
[3:14:09] and then I just I felt uplifted
[3:14:12] because I haven't prayed for so Um, and
[3:14:15] then I just got around to my normal, you
[3:14:17] know, started to work again. And then I
[3:14:21] felt a cold spirit come over me again.
[3:14:24] And it it literally felt like like I was
[3:14:26] doomed. I felt like I'm
[3:14:31] if I'm going anywhere, I'm going to
[3:14:32] hell.
[3:14:34] And I got down. I had to get down on my
[3:14:36] knees again and I had to pray straight
[3:14:37] away. And as soon as I did that, you
[3:14:40] spirit, the cold spirit left.
[3:14:43] Yeah.
[3:14:44] &gt;&gt; And I had the best day ever at work. To
[3:14:47] be honest, I had a really good day. And
[3:14:51] and then at night
[3:14:53] on the way home,
[3:14:55] it's just
[3:14:57] and and things have slowly been just
[3:14:59] leaving like like music.
[3:15:02] I just I it's I switched it over to like
[3:15:05] a praise channel and you know I've been
[3:15:08] really getting into the music of of God
[3:15:11] and and just praising while I'm driving
[3:15:13] to work and from work and and then I got
[3:15:17] home
[3:15:19] and you know it kind of it of course it
[3:15:22] was Wednesday and I knew you know
[3:15:23] everyone's going to church you know it
[3:15:25] was in the back of my mind and then
[3:15:28] and I was going to do my normal routine
[3:15:31] is just go to the gym gym like I always
[3:15:33] do. And
[3:15:37] I just, you know, I had got ready for
[3:15:40] the gym basically and and then I sat
[3:15:43] down on my bed and something did not let
[3:15:47] me go.
[3:15:49] &gt;&gt; I felt as if I literally had a battle
[3:15:52] inside of my head, the white dog and the
[3:15:55] black dog, and they were fighting so
[3:15:57] hard. And I I literally felt like there
[3:16:00] was a line drawn right across right in
[3:16:02] front of me and whatever I chose to do,
[3:16:06] it felt as if if I would go choose to go
[3:16:08] to the gym, it would lead me on the path
[3:16:11] that of darkness and there's no way that
[3:16:14] I'm coming back and if I would choose to
[3:16:16] go to church,
[3:16:19] I I felt like
[3:16:23] it was just the better choice. And
[3:16:26] something didn't let me go to the gym. I
[3:16:27] I had I had to come to church on
[3:16:29] Wednesday night. And right when I walked
[3:16:32] into the door, Tim Andy's was praying.
[3:16:35] And
[3:16:37] he said um he said, "You may someone
[3:16:41] here may not have even been at the
[3:16:43] meetings. Go to them, Father." And I
[3:16:47] said, "Wow, that's me." And I I'm here.
[3:16:52] And then he said, "The drugs can't do it
[3:16:55] for you anymore. the alcohol can't do it
[3:16:57] for you anymore.
[3:16:59] &gt;&gt; And I said to myself right there, I was
[3:17:02] like, "This is exactly where I'm
[3:17:04] supposed to be."
[3:17:10] &gt;&gt; And and since and since Wednesday night,
[3:17:14] I've had the drugs right in front of me.
[3:17:17] I've had the alcohol right in front of
[3:17:18] me. And absolutely no desire for it
[3:17:21] whatsoever.
[3:17:24] no desire whatsoever. And I thank I
[3:17:27] thank I thank God because I thought I'd
[3:17:31] be I thought there was no no possible
[3:17:33] way of me coming back here. And I came
[3:17:35] up I sat beside my dad. I felt like I
[3:17:37] felt so at home.
[3:17:39] &gt;&gt; I felt this is I felt I've never felt so
[3:17:42] happy in my life.
[3:17:45] And I'm I'm just praying I'm just
[3:17:48] praying for an absolute total
[3:17:49] deliverance.
[3:17:51] I just want to I just want to thank God
[3:17:54] for what he's done.
[3:17:55] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to press on
[3:17:58] &gt;&gt; because there's nothing out there that
[3:18:00] the devil offers that's worth it.
[3:18:03] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[3:18:05] Nothing at all.
[3:18:06] &gt;&gt; And I thank God for for revealing that
[3:18:08] to me.
[3:18:10] &gt;&gt; I just give him all the glory.
[3:18:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.

[3:19:03] speaking tonight, Brother Tom?
[3:19:14] We have have an amazing real God.
[3:19:19] &gt;&gt; Does incredible things
[3:19:24] &gt;&gt; you do, oh,
[3:19:25] &gt;&gt; let's bow our heads.
[3:19:28] [Music]
[3:19:31] &gt;&gt; Precious Lord,
[3:19:35] &gt;&gt; there's nowhere else we can feel at
[3:19:36] home.
[3:19:41] There's nowhere we want to be, Lord God.
[3:19:45] &gt;&gt; There's no pleasure. There's nothing
[3:19:48] &gt;&gt; Lord that can fill, that can satisfy
[3:19:51] like you can, Lord Jesus.
[3:19:54] And your prophet said that you wanted to
[3:19:57] fill us more than we wanted to be
[3:19:59] filled.
[3:20:00] Each one of us in here, Lord God, has
[3:20:03] built our own prisons.
[3:20:05] I for one, Lord God, have built a prison
[3:20:07] of my own, Lord Jesus.
[3:20:10] &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask you, Lord God, to
[3:20:12] tear down the bars, Lord God. Those
[3:20:16] things that hinder us, Lord Jesus, those
[3:20:19] things that we allow in our lives that
[3:20:21] aren't they're not us. They're not us.
[3:20:25] We don't belong in that prison, Lord.
[3:20:29] But as John was there for a season,
[3:20:31] Lord,
[3:20:32] &gt;&gt; he had a purpose and a reason there.
[3:20:34] Paul was there for a reason. Peter was
[3:20:36] there for a reason, Lord. There was
[3:20:39] great victory that came, Lord Jesus.
[3:20:42] &gt;&gt; There was overcoming, Lord God. There
[3:20:45] was people raised from the dead.
[3:20:48] &gt;&gt; There was jailers converted, Lord God.
[3:20:51] Lord, our brother that gave the
[3:20:53] testimony here, he's already prayed for
[3:20:55] others that are in this circumstance he
[3:20:57] was days ago. Lord God, they are they
[3:21:01] are his bars being loosed. And he's
[3:21:05] pulling out his brethren, his friends,
[3:21:08] Lord God, that are still there, still
[3:21:10] trapped, Lord God. Lord, your seed
[3:21:14] continually cries out. And Lord God, we
[3:21:18] know Lord God that there is victory for
[3:21:20] us. Lord Jesus,
[3:21:22] we thank you Lord for ministry Lord that
[3:21:24] has labored, surrendered all their
[3:21:27] lives. Lord God,
[3:21:30] &gt;&gt; Father God, where would we be?
[3:21:33] If
[3:21:34] &gt;&gt; they had not run, Lord,
[3:21:37] &gt;&gt; where would we be, Lord?
[3:21:40] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[3:21:44] &gt;&gt; oh God. Hallelujah.
[3:21:48] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Father, that was a
[3:21:50] consecrated car.
[3:21:52] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't even have a radio.
[3:21:55] &gt;&gt; Prayed
[3:21:57] that boys with dirty feet could come in
[3:21:59] the back of their car and mess it all
[3:22:01] up, Lord, just to take them to church.
[3:22:04] &gt;&gt; Lord, we remember the testimonies, Lord.
[3:22:08] &gt;&gt; Remember these laid on their face
[3:22:11] for each one of us, Lord. How many times
[3:22:14] they've prayers went up on our behalf,
[3:22:16] Lord.
[3:22:20] [Music]
[3:22:28] &gt;&gt; We rejoice Lord Jesus what you have done
[3:22:31] and what you are doing. Lord Jesus,
[3:22:34] we receive your great Holy Spirit Lord
[3:22:37] God. We deny that enemy that says it's
[3:22:41] not ours.
[3:22:42] We deny that enemy that keeps telling us
[3:22:46] it's not for us, Lord.
[3:22:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, you've done that. You can't be a
[3:22:51] Christian. Oh, you've done that. You
[3:22:54] can't have the Holy Ghost.
[3:22:57] I rebuke you, Satan. In the name of
[3:23:00] Jesus Christ.
[3:23:02] &gt;&gt; I rebuke you for myself, for my
[3:23:05] brothers, for my sisters.
[3:23:08] Lord, this is a move. Lord,
[3:23:10] &gt;&gt; the move is on.
[3:23:14] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[3:23:17] &gt;&gt; I stood beside a little boy, not six or
[3:23:20] seven years old, praying another boy's
[3:23:24] with his arm around him. Lord, they were
[3:23:26] just praying so earnestly, so sincerely,
[3:23:30] &gt;&gt; praying prayers that I was crying from
[3:23:32] my heart. Lord,
[3:23:33] &gt;&gt; little ones. Lord, you said we'd had to
[3:23:35] receive the kingdom as one of these
[3:23:37] little ones.
[3:23:39] Lord God, it's for us. It's for our
[3:23:41] families. It's for our seed, for our
[3:23:43] children after us. Lord God, no one in
[3:23:45] this room or is listening to our voice
[3:23:48] now is too young to receive your Holy
[3:23:51] Spirit, Lord God.
[3:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23:57] &gt;&gt; The seed has power within itself to
[3:23:59] transform itself into what is called to
[3:24:02] be.
[3:24:03] &gt;&gt; What you've determined it to be, it will
[3:24:06] be. Amen.
[3:24:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:24:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, we receive it, oh God.
[3:24:11] &gt;&gt; We thank you for it, Lord God. We thank
[3:24:13] you for it, Lord God.
[3:24:16] &gt;&gt; We thank you for it, Lord Jesus.
[3:24:19] &gt;&gt; May our lives erupt in praise and glory.
[3:24:22] For your kingdom's sake, for your glory,
[3:24:24] Lord God, we commit ourselves to you,
[3:24:26] Lord.
[3:24:29] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord.
[3:24:31] [Music]
[3:24:32] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord Jesus. Glorious.
[3:24:35] &gt;&gt; We love you Lord Jesus.

[3:24:41] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Jesus.
[3:24:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:24:44] &gt;&gt; Go with us now, Lord.
[3:24:47] &gt;&gt; Be with us and in us for your glory.
[3:24:49] God,
[3:24:50] &gt;&gt; protect and keep us, Lord, that we can
[3:24:52] come back together again.
[3:24:54] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name.
[3:24:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:25:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.

[3:25:13] back there and uh
[3:25:16] song going over and over in my head
[3:25:20] and the Lord gave me a few years back
[3:25:21] and uh I said if if the Lord uh if
[3:25:26] Brother Eis called me up here, I'd know
[3:25:28] I was to sing it. And I thought, I can
[3:25:31] only remember once he's ever called me
[3:25:33] up to pray a closing.
[3:25:35] And uh I'm not even sure I remember all
[3:25:38] the words, but it was it was to do with
[3:25:42] uh

[3:25:51] you though the world seen me no more. I
[3:25:54] believe.

[3:39:27] &gt;&gt; I know. I know. Brother Tom's reminding
[3:39:29] me,
[3:39:31] it's been a long time, but I said,
[3:39:33] "Brother Tom, we had 200 young people
[3:39:37] there last weekend, and it was great.
[3:39:38] And we've already had 200 more young
[3:39:41] people through the camp this weekend,
[3:39:42] and it was great, but it's good to be
[3:39:45] gathered with you this evening. We have
[3:39:48] been so desiring
[3:39:51] to be in fellowship and be in the
[3:39:54] presence of the Lord with you, not just
[3:39:57] experience on the internet internet as
[3:39:59] we tried to this morning. Amen. We
[3:40:03] certainly appreciate the testimonies of
[3:40:05] all of the young people. Amen. And it's
[3:40:07] wonderful to see God moving and
[3:40:10] not just hear the word preached, but to
[3:40:12] see the impact and to see the reality
[3:40:14] that it does have in our lives
[3:40:16] &gt;&gt; because it is true. And for us older
[3:40:18] ones that have had that experience,
[3:40:20] that's what we desire for our young
[3:40:23] people.
[3:40:24] &gt;&gt; That's the yearning in our heart
[3:40:26] &gt;&gt; to see our children have that experience
[3:40:28] for themselves.
[3:40:29] &gt;&gt; That's what carries us all through.
[3:40:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I want to sing just a
[3:40:33] couple of choruses. Want to get Brother
[3:40:36] Tom right to the pulpit. We do have a
[3:40:37] couple of specials to enjoy. I want to

[3:48:18] you yourself have responded to the cry
[3:48:20] of our hearts.
[3:48:22] &gt;&gt; We're so happy, Lord. We're so thrilled,
[3:48:25] Lord, with what you're doing, Lord.
[3:48:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:48:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:48:34] Brother Toby Kyobi, if you'd come,
[3:48:36] Brother Toby,
[3:48:38] lead the congregation in prayer. We want
[3:48:40] to remember William Hoyer. It's Andrew
[3:48:43] and Natasha Hoyer's boy. They had to
[3:48:46] take him to the doctor
[3:48:49] cuz he has a quite a cough and they're
[3:48:52] going to have him looked at. So maybe
[3:48:54] we' just pray for him this evening.
[3:48:56] Unite our hearts together in our faith.
[3:48:58] the Holy Spirit would go and
[3:49:01] minister to the little one, Brother
[3:49:03] Toby, if you'd come. God bless you.
[3:49:07] [Music]
[3:49:10] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[3:49:13] Oh God,
[3:49:16] we've test you
[3:49:18] &gt;&gt; and we found out you're good.
[3:49:22] &gt;&gt; We've been in your presence
[3:49:24] &gt;&gt; and we felt God, it's getting sweeter
[3:49:26] and sweeter.
[3:49:28] Oh God, there's no way, there's no word
[3:49:31] to express great things that you do
[3:49:34] &gt;&gt; in the life of everyone standing here.
[3:49:36] God,
[3:49:37] &gt;&gt; I do believe if we have to open a
[3:49:40] testimony service, God, we go on and on
[3:49:43] and on and on because you just pull
[3:49:46] yourself down. Oh God, you've opened the
[3:49:49] gates of heaven and let your blessing
[3:49:51] pour upon your bride and we've claimed
[3:49:54] every promise that is written in the
[3:49:56] Bible that is us. So God,
[3:49:58] &gt;&gt; I just want to remember sister Natasha
[3:50:00] and uh her husband, they have a baby
[3:50:03] which is sick. God is standing now. I've
[3:50:06] been a testimony not even 5 minutes ago
[3:50:09] coming with high fever. Oh God, the
[3:50:11] devil just burning me down. I couldn't
[3:50:13] walk. I couldn't do anything. Call
[3:50:16] brother Sam Ray and called brother
[3:50:17] Emanuel. They just laid hand on me and
[3:50:20] the devil just flew away. You're the
[3:50:22] same God. I believe you God. And I ask
[3:50:25] you, heavenly father, I just want to
[3:50:29] bring the child in your presence by the
[3:50:31] way of prayer and ask you, God, to go
[3:50:34] where the baby is and touch the baby for
[3:50:37] your name, oh God, so we can come back
[3:50:39] and give glory and thanksgiving to you
[3:50:42] because you deserve it. There's no God
[3:50:44] like you on earth, oh God, on heaven.
[3:50:47] None is like you, oh God. Your name is
[3:50:49] above all name, Jesus Christ. We thank
[3:50:52] you for the great things that you do in
[3:50:53] our life, oh God. Even for this morning
[3:50:56] service, what a great service. Oh God,
[3:50:58] every step of our life, you come with a
[3:51:00] perfect message for the right time. Oh
[3:51:03] God, we can understand. Oh Jesus Christ,
[3:51:05] we can go as a John the Baptist. We can
[3:51:08] go like Elijah. But know the living God
[3:51:10] is there. If we fast, he will take us
[3:51:12] because you never change. Oh Jesus
[3:51:14] Christ. Oh heavenly father, now let if
[3:51:17] there's anyone here who may be in a
[3:51:19] prison like John, if there's anyone here
[3:51:22] who be under juniper tree like Elijah,
[3:51:25] your presence, the angel of God, go
[3:51:27] behind them, oh God, and give them the
[3:51:29] bread of life. Give them your word, oh
[3:51:31] God. Heal the sick, oh God. Give those
[3:51:34] underneath the Holy Ghost. We're still
[3:51:35] standing and claim those one who just
[3:51:38] about to come. Oh God, bring them
[3:51:40] closer. Bring them to your presence. We
[3:51:42] can tell them the water is fine. come
[3:51:44] and test it. The Lord is good. Oh God,
[3:51:47] we just want more of you God. And we say
[3:51:49] God even now come Holy Ghost and sweep
[3:51:52] us now and take us home because we have
[3:51:54] tired to live in this oh this world full
[3:51:57] of sick to f of every evil spirit but
[3:52:00] want to come and hide in your presence
[3:52:04] oh God and every time be very very
[3:52:06] conscient and very conscious of what the
[3:52:09] Holy Ghost has to tell us and making it
[3:52:11] practice. Thank you God. I bring brother
[3:52:13] Tommy unto you now. The man of God. Oh
[3:52:16] God, you know how much we love him.
[3:52:18] &gt;&gt; A great gift for this last age. Oh God,
[3:52:21] we've seen you moving behind this man.
[3:52:23] We've seen you using his lips, using his
[3:52:26] hand, using his mind. Oh God, and he is
[3:52:28] a great instrument. Oh God, behind you.
[3:52:31] How many time you have come and
[3:52:33] vindicated his ministry, oh God, we just
[3:52:36] want to open our heart now and receive
[3:52:38] whatever you may have for us. Oh God,
[3:52:40] let it be according to your word. Oh
[3:52:42] God, we just want to receive it. Walk in
[3:52:44] your presence. Walk in your way, oh God.
[3:52:46] Come and have your way among us now. We
[3:52:49] love you, heavenly father. Let glory and
[3:52:52] honor be unto you because you deserve
[3:52:55] it. Just want to love you. Love you more
[3:52:58] and more God. Stay in your presence.
[3:53:00] That's our desire. Take everything, oh
[3:53:02] God, that can handle us. Take every
[3:53:04] burden, oh God. Anything that can stop
[3:53:07] us to come higher in your presence, just
[3:53:09] take it away. You've sent a message, oh
[3:53:11] God, to cut us higher. You said, "Bride,
[3:53:13] come higher, higher than what we're
[3:53:16] living now, God, to see your presence,
[3:53:18] to see your face, and just enjoy it.
[3:53:21] Thank you, Lord. Thank you for my
[3:53:23] healing.
[3:53:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you for Sister Natasha baby's
[3:53:26] healing, oh God. And anyone here has any
[3:53:29] need, what kind of need it is, oh God,
[3:53:31] we've brought in your presence. And you
[3:53:34] know your word can go and see every
[3:53:37] heart, every desire even in every small
[3:53:40] details. And I just want to thank you
[3:53:42] for the answer to every prayer that has
[3:53:44] been nailed and pray before you. Thank
[3:53:47] you Lord. We love you and we commit the
[3:53:50] rest of the service onto you. Holy Ghost
[3:53:52] just come move now and take control of
[3:53:54] everything we ask. In Jesus Christ's
[3:53:57] name we pray.
[3:53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:54:03] Praise the Lord. God bless you as you
[3:54:05] have your seats this evening. Sister
[3:54:07] Hadtie's got a special for us. So maybe
[3:54:10] she can just come and get ready at this
[3:54:12] time.
[3:54:14] We're going to have Brother Michael Ray
[3:54:15] come and sing right after she's done.
[3:54:18] Praise the Lord. I know you love the
[3:54:20] Lord tonight. I don't even have to ask
[3:54:21] it. I can see it. I can feel it.
[3:54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's wonderful to be in the
[3:54:26] presence of the Lord this evening. Amen.
[3:54:33] Um, I wasn't really going to sing this
[3:54:35] song, but um, when brother Kyra was
[3:54:37] preaching on um, the thin line between
[3:54:40] mercy and judgment, it like the chorus
[3:54:42] mercy said no, kept coming to my head
[3:54:43] and it kept coming to me the whole week
[3:54:45] and like I just want to thank God for
[3:54:47] his mercy and it's he's become so real
[3:54:49] in my life. So, thank you
[3:54:56] [Music]
[3:55:12] I was just a child
[3:55:15] when I felt the Savior leading.
[3:55:20] I was drawn to what I could not
[3:55:24] understand. Before
[3:55:30] the cause of Christ,
[3:55:32] I have spent my days believing
[3:55:37] that what he had me be is who I am.
[3:55:46] As I come to see the weaker side of me,
[3:55:54] I realize his grace is what I need.
[3:56:03] When sin demanded justice for my soul,
[3:56:09] mercy said, "No,
[3:56:14] I'm not going to let you go.
[3:56:18] I'm not going to let you slip away.
[3:56:22] You don't have to be afraid.
[3:56:26] Mercy said, "No,
[3:56:30] sin will never take control. Oh,
[3:56:36] life and death stood face to face.
[3:56:40] Darkness tried to steal my heart away.
[3:56:47] Save you Jesus.
[3:56:50] Mercy said no.
[3:56:54] [Music]
[3:57:00] For God so loved the world that he sent
[3:57:04] his son to save us.
[3:57:08] From the cross he built a bridge to set
[3:57:13] us free.
[3:57:16] Oh, but deep within our hearts,
[3:57:20] there is still a war that rages.
[3:57:25] Makes a sacrifice
[3:57:28] so hard to see.
[3:57:33] As midnight fell on crucifixion day,
[3:57:41] the light of hope seem all so far
[3:57:46] away.
[3:57:49] As evil tried to stop, redemptions flow.
[3:57:56] Mercy said, "No,
[3:58:00] I'm not going to let you go.
[3:58:03] I'm not going to let you slip away.
[3:58:08] You don't have to be afraid.
[3:58:12] Mercy said no.
[3:58:15] Sin will never take control.
[3:58:21] Life and death stood face the face as
[3:58:25] darkness tried to steal my heart away.
[3:58:32] Thank you Jesus.
[3:58:35] Mercy said no.
[3:58:41] And now when heaven looks at me, it's
[3:58:45] through the blood of Jesus
[3:58:49] reminding me of one day long ago.
[3:58:58] [Music]
[3:58:59] Oh,
[3:59:05] [Music]
[3:59:11] mercy said, "No,
[3:59:15] I'm not going to let you go.
[3:59:19] I'm not going to let you slip away. You
[3:59:23] don't have to be afraid.
[3:59:27] Mercy send the world.
[3:59:30] Sin will never take control.
[3:59:36] Life and death stood face to face.
[3:59:40] Darkness tried to steal my heart away.
[3:59:47] Thank you, Jesus.
[3:59:50] Mercy said no.
[3:59:55] [Music]
[3:59:58] Mercy said no.
[4:00:02] [Music]
[4:00:11] I'm amazed.
[4:00:13] Amen. As Michael comes,
[4:00:16] I'm amazed
[4:00:20] that you love me.
[4:00:25] I'm amazed
[4:00:28] [Music]
[4:00:30] for how you came through your preious
[4:00:35] blood. I found pardon in my sins and my
[4:00:41] sins.
[4:00:42] They're washed. They're all washed away.
[4:00:47] All my sins
[4:00:50] are washed
[4:00:52] away.
[4:00:56] [Music]
[4:01:00] that you love me.
[4:01:07] How you care for me through your preious
[4:01:14] blood I found pardon and my sins. All my
[4:01:19] sins
[4:01:21] they're washed. They're all washed away.
[4:01:26] All my sins
[4:01:29] are wash
[4:01:31] away.
[4:01:32] [Music]
[4:01:37] Hallelujah.
[4:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:01:41] &gt;&gt; That seems like an anthem. We've sung it
[4:01:43] many times, but it doesn't get doesn't
[4:01:44] get old. It just seems new every time we
[4:01:46] sing it. Amen. just a a song that you've
[4:01:49] all heard before, but um it just was
[4:01:52] been on my heart for a little while and
[4:01:53] I just felt pressed and pressed to sing
[4:01:54] it. I thought maybe I'd sing it at camp,
[4:01:56] but it just maybe wasn't the right time.
[4:01:58] So, hearing the message this morning and
[4:02:01] uh knowing that we've been on a
[4:02:04] mountaintop, but it's in that valley
[4:02:07] that we are our our experience is
[4:02:09] tested. And uh you know it's important
[4:02:12] that we can look back to the anchor that
[4:02:13] we placed maybe for those at camp and
[4:02:15] you can say no God met me there and that
[4:02:17] was a real experience and you can hold
[4:02:18] on to that anchor. So we're just going
[4:02:20] to sing sing a song. If you know it and
[4:02:22] you want to sing along feel feel free.
[4:02:23] It make me feel a little bit less
[4:02:24] nervous.
[4:02:29] [Music]
[4:02:45] It's not hard to believe.
[4:02:50] Standing on the mountain tops of glory.
[4:02:55] [Music]
[4:03:00] Oh, when you can hear the songs of
[4:03:03] angels and a breeze from heaven sends
[4:03:07] your spirit
[4:03:09] soar.
[4:03:14] Oh, but in the valley once more,
[4:03:19] will Jesus still be Lord? That's the
[4:03:24] question.
[4:03:25] [Music]
[4:03:28] Cuz
[4:03:30] believe
[4:03:32] in believing
[4:03:34] isn't easy.
[4:03:37] That is the testing.
[4:03:40] [Music]
[4:03:43] Oh, and I need faith for the times
[4:03:49] when the sun doesn't shine
[4:03:52] and the mountain top is just a memory.
[4:03:59] When there's no signs to be seen
[4:04:03] and you don't feel a thing
[4:04:07] to the word of God alone, I can cling.
[4:04:12] Oh, and I need faith for the day.
[4:04:18] When troubles come my way and I just
[4:04:22] don't understand what it means,
[4:04:28] that's when nothing else will do.
[4:04:32] Faith alone will see through
[4:04:36] and believing becomes my victory.
[4:04:41] [Music]
[4:04:45] Oh, it's not hard to believe
[4:04:50] when things are going well and skies are
[4:04:55] sunny.
[4:04:58] [Music]
[4:05:00] Oh, when you feel you're making progress
[4:05:04] and doing good, living in a time of
[4:05:09] plenty.
[4:05:10] [Music]
[4:05:14] Oh, but if all of that should change,
[4:05:19] will you still keep the faith? That's
[4:05:23] the question.
[4:05:28] Oh, cuz belieing when believing isn't
[4:05:34] easy.
[4:05:36] Oh, that is the testing. Amen. Let's
[4:05:39] sing it. Oh, and I need
[4:05:45] for the time when the sun is not shine
[4:05:51] and the mountain top is just
[4:05:56] oh and there's no sign to be seen and
[4:06:01] you know
[4:06:03] [Applause]
[4:06:05] do the word
[4:06:10] Oh my
[4:06:13] for the day when troules come my way and
[4:06:19] I just don't understand what it means.
[4:06:25] Oh that's when nothing else will do
[4:06:29] if the Lord will see you through
[4:06:33] and believing becomes my glory.
[4:06:39] Oh, will you be faithful for the time
[4:06:46] when the sun does not shine
[4:06:50] and mountain top is just my
[4:06:54] [Music]
[4:06:57] sign to be seen and
[4:07:04] to the word I All I
[4:07:11] think for the day when troules come my
[4:07:16] way and I just don't understand what it
[4:07:21] means.
[4:07:24] That's when nothing else will do.
[4:07:28] Faith alone will see me through
[4:07:32] and believing becomes my victory.
[4:07:38] [Music]
[4:07:49] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[4:07:54] [Music]
[4:07:59] Heat.
[4:08:01] [Music]
[4:08:10] Heat.

[4:08:46] Hallelujah.
[4:08:49] [Music]
[4:08:49] [Applause]
[4:08:50] [Music]
[4:08:58] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[4:08:59] &gt;&gt; Glorious.
[4:09:02] [Music]
[4:09:05] Jesus, it just seems that we're about
[4:09:07] basking in the presence of God.
[4:09:19] So thankful
[4:09:23] &gt;&gt; so blessed
[4:09:26] [Music]
[4:09:28] &gt;&gt; as we can say like the psalmist David
[4:09:30] your mercies are new every day
[4:09:36] &gt;&gt; we thank you for these times Lord these
[4:09:38] are wonderful times of refreshing
[4:09:41] &gt;&gt; wonderful times in your presence
[4:09:43] [Music]
[4:09:49] And Father, we're asking once again that
[4:09:52] [Music]
[4:09:53] as we have gathered around the word of
[4:09:55] God,
[4:09:56] [Music]
[4:09:58] the preeminent one,
[4:10:01] the Holy One,
[4:10:03] &gt;&gt; our King and Lord, you are
[4:10:07] &gt;&gt; our lovely Lord Jesus. We worship you
[4:10:09] tonight.
[4:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. worthy Lord,

[4:10:22] &gt;&gt; And so as we will look in your word, we
[4:10:25] pray, Father, that you'll inspire us
[4:10:27] again and help your people.
[4:10:31] &gt;&gt; We need help.
[4:10:35] &gt;&gt; We understand that there is a blind
[4:10:37] leody blind
[4:10:39] &gt;&gt; in need of nothing. And yet we're in
[4:10:42] need of everything.
[4:10:45] &gt;&gt; They might not want you, but we do,
[4:10:47] Lord.
[4:10:50] &gt;&gt; More and more and more we thirst after
[4:10:52] thee, the living God.
[4:10:54] [Music]
[4:10:58] &gt;&gt; And so, Lord, as we now turn to the
[4:11:00] word, would you
[4:11:02] speak to us
[4:11:06] &gt;&gt; that somehow we could just close oursel?
[4:11:11] in a little booth with you and
[4:11:14] &gt;&gt; tell you how lovely you are.
[4:11:20] &gt;&gt; Speak to us now we pray. Father
[4:11:22] committing all things into your care
[4:11:24] Jesus name. Amen.
[4:11:28] &gt;&gt; Revelations 12.

[4:12:32] angels

[4:13:00] winner. Amen.
[4:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Young people,
[4:13:04] &gt;&gt; parents,
[4:13:06] dads, moms,
[4:13:09] we have come to be strengthened in the
[4:13:10] Lord,
[4:13:11] &gt;&gt; in the word of God.
[4:13:14] &gt;&gt; And prevailed not, neither was their
[4:13:17] place found anymore in heaven.
[4:13:21] &gt;&gt; Glory. And the great dragon was cast
[4:13:24] out, the old serpent called the devil
[4:13:26] and Satan,
[4:13:28] &gt;&gt; which deceived the whole world. He was
[4:13:31] cast out into the earth, and his angels
[4:13:34] were cast out with him. And I heard a
[4:13:37] loud voice saying in heaven, "Now is
[4:13:40] come salvation and strength and the
[4:13:43] kingdom of our God and the power of his
[4:13:45] Christ. For the accuser of the brethren
[4:13:48] is cast down, which accuses them before
[4:13:52] our God day and night.
[4:13:57] &gt;&gt; And they,
[4:13:58] &gt;&gt; yes,
[4:13:58] &gt;&gt; us,
[4:14:00] &gt;&gt; you sir,
[4:14:02] &gt;&gt; me
[4:14:03] &gt;&gt; overcame him
[4:14:05] &gt;&gt; by the blood of the lamb.
[4:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:14:10] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[4:14:12] &gt;&gt; And they overcame him
[4:14:14] &gt;&gt; by the blood of the lamb.
[4:14:16] &gt;&gt; And by the word
[4:14:18] &gt;&gt; by the word,
[4:14:20] &gt;&gt; by the word of their testimony.
[4:14:23] &gt;&gt; Young people, you say, "I got a
[4:14:24] testimony." How are you going to
[4:14:26] overcome? By the blood of the lamb and
[4:14:28] by the word of your testimony.
[4:14:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:14:35] &gt;&gt; How are we going to overcome in this
[4:14:38] wicked age? is by the bleeding word
[4:14:41] &gt;&gt; and by the word of your testimony.
[4:14:43] &gt;&gt; Do you believe?
[4:14:46] [Music]
[4:14:49] &gt;&gt; And they overcame him by the blood of
[4:14:51] the lamb and by the word of their
[4:14:52] testimony and they loved not their lives
[4:14:56] unto death.
[4:14:57] &gt;&gt; And may God add his blessing to his
[4:14:59] word. You may have your seat.
[4:15:08] They wanted a title tonight. I surely
[4:15:10] don't plan
[4:15:13] on really being long.
[4:15:20] I live for these times.
[4:15:23] &gt;&gt; I have lived my life for these kind of
[4:15:25] times.
[4:15:28] &gt;&gt; I've left everything for this.
[4:15:31] &gt;&gt; And it's not going to stop here. Amen.
[4:15:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's not just here. This
[4:15:36] is a taste of heaven.
[4:15:39] &gt;&gt; It's just the beginning of greater
[4:15:41] things.
[4:15:42] [Applause]
[4:15:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:15:47] &gt;&gt; So, you think we're a little crazy,
[4:15:48] we're enjoying it.
[4:15:50] &gt;&gt; You think we're over the top, I'm
[4:15:52] basking in it.
[4:15:55] &gt;&gt; Come on, Michael.
[4:15:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This is our time.
[4:15:59] &gt;&gt; This is our time.
[4:16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen,
[4:16:04] they you know the last weekend they had
[4:16:06] the Super Bowl,
[4:16:07] &gt;&gt; they spent millions and cazillions of
[4:16:10] dollars for nothing.
[4:16:13] &gt;&gt; And we did by the grace of God gave our
[4:16:15] efforts for the kingdom and God has
[4:16:18] given us everything.
[4:16:21] &gt;&gt; They go crazy. Saints of God, surely
[4:16:24] this is what we come to the house of God
[4:16:26] for.
[4:16:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The sick are healed.
[4:16:32] The lost are saved.
[4:16:34] &gt;&gt; The blind see.
[4:16:36] &gt;&gt; That's what we heard.
[4:16:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[4:16:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, Joel.
[4:16:42] &gt;&gt; That's what this is about.
[4:16:45] &gt;&gt; We claim the token.
[4:16:47] &gt;&gt; Should we expect anything less?
[4:16:49] &gt;&gt; No, sir. This is what we live for.
[4:16:54] [Applause]
[4:16:55] &gt;&gt; I love it when I come to church and
[4:16:56] somebody says, "Did you see who's here?
[4:16:58] Did you see who's there? Did you see
[4:17:00] who's there?
[4:17:00] &gt;&gt; I said, "Yeah, Joel was there."
[4:17:02] &gt;&gt; I said, "That's a sign.
[4:17:04] &gt;&gt; That's an indication.
[4:17:06] &gt;&gt; That's what we believe.
[4:17:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:17:12] &gt;&gt; I It is just wonderful.
[4:17:15] &gt;&gt; It's glorious to me.
[4:17:20] &gt;&gt; This has been going on for months.
[4:17:23] &gt;&gt; This has been going on for months. It
[4:17:24] wasn't just at camp.
[4:17:26] &gt;&gt; We had all the parents here before camp.
[4:17:29] I I was going to actually have another
[4:17:30] another stand for the old people.
[4:17:33] &gt;&gt; You stood here for your children.
[4:17:36] &gt;&gt; You stood here for your children. The AM
[4:17:39] before the AM
[4:17:42] &gt;&gt; and God confirmed his word.
[4:17:44] &gt;&gt; God confirmed your prayers.
[4:17:46] &gt;&gt; God is in the midst.
[4:17:51] &gt;&gt; Say, "Where's God?" Wake up.
[4:17:54] &gt;&gt; Wake up.
[4:17:56] &gt;&gt; God's everywhere.
[4:17:58] [Applause]
[4:18:05] I've been in and so enjoying.
[4:18:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:18:08] &gt;&gt; But how are we going to overcome? We're
[4:18:10] going to overcome by the blood of the
[4:18:11] lamb.
[4:18:12] &gt;&gt; We're going to overcome by this message
[4:18:14] alone and by our testimony that's in
[4:18:17] this bleeding word.
[4:18:18] &gt;&gt; There's no other message, saints of God,
[4:18:20] that is going to deliver a young man.
[4:18:22] Pentecost can't do it. They're in their
[4:18:25] quagmire today. They have no power, no
[4:18:28] word. But the church of the living God
[4:18:31] has wonder working power.
[4:18:35] &gt;&gt; Glory. People are bound. People are
[4:18:38] bound because they want to be bound.
[4:18:40] &gt;&gt; But not in this church.
[4:18:42] &gt;&gt; If you want to be free,
[4:18:47] [Music]
[4:18:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[4:18:52] &gt;&gt; What's your title, Brother Tom?
[4:18:55] The title tonight is what is their
[4:18:58] testimony?
[4:19:00] &gt;&gt; I'm taking it out of brother Bram's
[4:19:02] message, faith in action.
[4:19:06] &gt;&gt; What is your testimony?
[4:19:10] &gt;&gt; What is your testimony? That's it.
[4:19:17] &gt;&gt; Here he says, he says, "When the great
[4:19:20] redeemed of host stand around the throne
[4:19:23] of God,
[4:19:25] waving the white palms, palms in their
[4:19:29] hand
[4:19:30] with white robes washed in the blood of
[4:19:33] the lamb."
[4:19:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:19:35] &gt;&gt; He says, "We'll tell the story of how we
[4:19:38] overcome." Amen.
[4:19:40] &gt;&gt; How do we overcome?
[4:19:42] &gt;&gt; By the blood of the lamb
[4:19:44] &gt;&gt; and by their testimony.
[4:19:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:19:48] &gt;&gt; What is their testimony? Title. What is
[4:19:52] your testimony?
[4:19:55] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[4:19:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus lives.
[4:20:01] &gt;&gt; The word's alive.
[4:20:04] &gt;&gt; What's your testimony? He lives. Christ
[4:20:07] Jesus lives today. Where? Brother Tom,
[4:20:10] he lives in me.
[4:20:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:20:14] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[4:20:16] &gt;&gt; Glory. We didn't leave him at camp,
[4:20:19] Nathan. We got God living in me.
[4:20:24] &gt;&gt; He lives. What's your testimony,
[4:20:26] Jonathan?
[4:20:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus lives. Where?
[4:20:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, young people. Where?
[4:20:34] &gt;&gt; He lives in me. What's your testimony?
[4:20:36] The bleeding lamb still lives.
[4:20:39] &gt;&gt; The bleeding word's alive.
[4:20:41] [Applause]
[4:20:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:20:46] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you believe when you pray,
[4:20:48] you shall have what you ask.
[4:20:50] &gt;&gt; He lives.
[4:20:54] &gt;&gt; People are looking for God. God came
[4:20:56] down in this generation.
[4:20:58] &gt;&gt; Science took a picture of it. That
[4:21:00] pillar of fire was here. Hung with a
[4:21:02] prophet. The world's missed it. But by
[4:21:06] the grace of God, you can say Jesus
[4:21:08] lives.
[4:21:11] [Music]
[4:21:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:21:14] &gt;&gt; The word lives.
[4:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:21:26] Oh, you say you're getting a little
[4:21:28] excited, Brother Tom.
[4:21:30] &gt;&gt; Well, I have a quote. We hadn't finished
[4:21:32] the quote yet, brother Randy.
[4:21:34] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, let it ring out through
[4:21:36] the mountains. Jesus lives."
[4:21:39] &gt;&gt; When you go to college tomorrow, Jesus
[4:21:41] lives.
[4:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:21:45] &gt;&gt; Well, where is he living? He lives in
[4:21:47] me.
[4:21:48] &gt;&gt; He lives in you.
[4:21:50] [Applause]
[4:21:51] [Music]
[4:21:55] When Jesus started to identify himself,
[4:21:59] &gt;&gt; the father. When you seen me, you seen
[4:22:01] the father. Blasphemy.
[4:22:08] &gt;&gt; We are
[4:22:11] the sons and daughters of God.
[4:22:14] &gt;&gt; We are.
[4:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. right now.
[4:22:18] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[4:22:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:22:23] &gt;&gt; Notice he said being personally
[4:22:25] identified the original headship. We
[4:22:29] have the answer to every devil's
[4:22:31] question.
[4:22:32] &gt;&gt; We have the answer to the devil's
[4:22:34] question. He Christ is risen.
[4:22:38] &gt;&gt; The bleeding word is alive.
[4:22:40] &gt;&gt; And he has paid the price. Raised up the
[4:22:43] head and the body. The devil can't stand
[4:22:46] it.
[4:22:48] &gt;&gt; You're going to have a fight. The devil
[4:22:50] can't stand it. But he has given us the
[4:22:53] bleeding bloody word
[4:22:54] &gt;&gt; and your testimony to overcome the
[4:22:58] devil.
[4:23:00] &gt;&gt; Not somebody else's testimony, Joel.
[4:23:02] Your testimony.
[4:23:05] &gt;&gt; I have a testimony. You heard a
[4:23:07] testimony. Gary, you got a testimony.
[4:23:10] [Music]
[4:23:13] Hallelujah.
[4:23:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:23:18] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, God's in the church." God
[4:23:19] better be in the church.
[4:23:21] &gt;&gt; You are the church.
[4:23:22] &gt;&gt; Well, say, "God's in the church." That's
[4:23:24] exactly right. God's in me.
[4:23:26] &gt;&gt; God's in you.
[4:23:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:23:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the reason." He said,
[4:23:34] "The devil, he's howling the way he is.
[4:23:37] His wickedness, his scheme has been
[4:23:40] uncovered by the resurrected Christ.
[4:23:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:23:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the headship over his
[4:23:46] body, God has given his mind, his
[4:23:49] thought towards every situation.
[4:23:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:23:54] &gt;&gt; You think I'm beside myself. I am not.
[4:23:57] We've got the devil's answer. Not me.
[4:23:59] But there was the Christ, the word
[4:24:02] living in me.
[4:24:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's not my idea. It's his power,
[4:24:07] not my idea. It's his word. As Christ of
[4:24:09] God revealed 84, page 84. Christ is
[4:24:12] risen, paid the price for our
[4:24:14] redemption.
[4:24:15] &gt;&gt; What God in Christ manifested. He gave
[4:24:17] the flesh and the blood that in the
[4:24:19] blood might come life and the flesh be
[4:24:22] redeemed. That was God in this redeemed
[4:24:25] flesh could manifest his word for this
[4:24:28] day as he did in that day.
[4:24:31] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[4:24:32] &gt;&gt; You see it? Oh my. I just can't stop.
[4:24:34] Neither can I.
[4:24:35] &gt;&gt; Notice we stand justified in the very
[4:24:40] presence of God.
[4:24:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:24:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "As a drop of ink dropped into
[4:24:46] a tub of bleach, you'll never find the
[4:24:48] stain again.
[4:24:50] &gt;&gt; No more. It went somewhere. It never
[4:24:52] will come back again." And a man that's
[4:24:54] truly been redeemed.
[4:24:56] &gt;&gt; The predestinated seed genes of God. Are
[4:24:59] you the redeemed?
[4:25:00] &gt;&gt; It's gone.
[4:25:02] &gt;&gt; It's gone. You have overcome
[4:25:05] &gt;&gt; by the bleeding word and by your
[4:25:07] testimony that you believe it.
[4:25:13] &gt;&gt; It's dropped into the inca blood of
[4:25:16] Jesus Christ never ever to be remembered
[4:25:19] again.
[4:25:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to be to God. Glory.
[4:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. God forgets it and he and he
[4:25:26] stands as a son and daughter of God in
[4:25:28] the presence of God. Amen.
[4:25:30] &gt;&gt; Now we are the sons of God. Not we will
[4:25:32] be. We are preach on this the Wednesday
[4:25:34] before camp. We're redeemed. We have
[4:25:36] Satan's answer. God's a vindicated
[4:25:39] himself.
[4:25:40] &gt;&gt; Proved himself to his promise in this
[4:25:42] day. The headship is here. Christ the
[4:25:45] risen Lord. It's here in the same power.
[4:25:51] &gt;&gt; God help us to believe.
[4:25:54] &gt;&gt; In the same power of his resurrection
[4:25:58] manifesting himself.
[4:26:00] That's the devil's answer.
[4:26:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:26:06] &gt;&gt; Christ in you.
[4:26:09] &gt;&gt; God's great revelation.
[4:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:26:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:26:23] &gt;&gt; What is their testimony
[4:26:26] &gt;&gt; and what is yours?
[4:26:30] Jesus
[4:26:32] lives.
[4:26:35] &gt;&gt; I serve a risen savior.
[4:26:39] &gt;&gt; He lives. Christ Jesus
[4:26:41] lives. Today, brother Bram said in
[4:26:44] revelation of Jesus Christ series.
[4:26:48] How are you over? How do you overcome?
[4:26:53] By the blood of the lamb and the words
[4:26:55] of your testimony. He takes consider
[4:26:58] this since the blood of God is perfect
[4:26:59] blood and if the perfect blood is
[4:27:02] loosing us from the power and bondage
[4:27:03] and defilement of sin then the loosing
[4:27:07] is perfect
[4:27:10] &gt;&gt; complete.
[4:27:12] &gt;&gt; Therefore there is no condemnation.
[4:27:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord brother David.
[4:27:18] &gt;&gt; Devil comes so quickly
[4:27:20] &gt;&gt; so quickly tomorrow.
[4:27:24] &gt;&gt; So quickly young people.
[4:27:28] to come against you,
[4:27:30] &gt;&gt; to condemn you,
[4:27:33] &gt;&gt; but you take God at his word
[4:27:36] &gt;&gt; right here, right now.
[4:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:27:38] &gt;&gt; It's perfect loosing and it's complete.
[4:27:41] &gt;&gt; There is no condemnation whatsoever. Who
[4:27:44] shall lay anything to the charge of
[4:27:46] God's elect?
[4:27:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's God that justifies
[4:27:51] and calls you righteous.
[4:27:53] &gt;&gt; It's Christ that died. There it is.
[4:27:56] &gt;&gt; His death gave us the blood.
[4:27:59] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[4:28:01] &gt;&gt; His death gave us the blood.
[4:28:04] &gt;&gt; The blood has loosed us. There is no
[4:28:07] condemnation. How can there be? There's
[4:28:09] nothing to condemn you for.
[4:28:13] &gt;&gt; Because the blood has loosed us from all
[4:28:17] our sin.
[4:28:21] [Applause]
[4:28:23] Hallelujah.
[4:28:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:28:27] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but those prison
[4:28:28] bars just opened up.
[4:28:31] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[4:28:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That blood has loosed us. No
[4:28:39] condemnation. How can there be? There is
[4:28:42] nothing to condemn. For the blood has
[4:28:45] loosed us from sin. We're free. We're
[4:28:48] guiltless.
[4:28:52] &gt;&gt; One of the greatest of the Pentecostal
[4:28:55] teachers
[4:28:56] this last week has come forth and said,
[4:29:00] "I don't believe in the blood anymore."
[4:29:07] &gt;&gt; One of the greatest, they followed him
[4:29:10] for years
[4:29:12] &gt;&gt; and comes forth and doesn't believe in
[4:29:13] the blood. But let me tell you young
[4:29:16] people, you wash yourself in that
[4:29:20] bleeding word and let that word become
[4:29:23] your testimony, you'll overcome every
[4:29:26] devil there is.
[4:29:29] [Music]
[4:29:29] [Applause]
[4:29:30] &gt;&gt; They don't want the power of the blood.
[4:29:32] I'll take the power of the blood.
[4:29:36] &gt;&gt; Glory. Look what it's doing to you. It's
[4:29:39] changing you from glory unto glory unto
[4:29:42] glory.
[4:29:46] Amen.
[4:29:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why the devil's
[4:29:49] howling. You think he's going to be
[4:29:51] happy about you young people going to be
[4:29:52] happy about you parents, about your
[4:29:54] children, happy about you getting
[4:29:55] victory over things that were in your
[4:29:57] life for so many years. You think he's
[4:29:59] happy? He is not happy. He's howling.
[4:30:01] But we've got a word.
[4:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:30:07] &gt;&gt; Bradam said he said he couldn't give us
[4:30:08] anything greater than what he's already
[4:30:09] given.
[4:30:11] &gt;&gt; The word of God. He just makes it more
[4:30:13] real.
[4:30:15] &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh God, let our eyes be open to
[4:30:18] see your word more real than it's ever
[4:30:19] been before."
[4:30:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:30:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:30:26] &gt;&gt; More real.
[4:30:34] &gt;&gt; By your testimony,
[4:30:37] &gt;&gt; how you're believing,
[4:30:40] &gt;&gt; how are you believing?
[4:30:43] Great.
[4:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:30:46] &gt;&gt; Say great.
[4:30:48] &gt;&gt; How are you believing?
[4:30:49] &gt;&gt; Great.
[4:30:50] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[4:30:52] &gt;&gt; I'm really believing.
[4:30:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:30:57] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[4:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:31:00] &gt;&gt; Are you really believing?
[4:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:31:06] &gt;&gt; He bought us. Revelation of Jesus
[4:31:09] Christ. He's bought us. He's purchased
[4:31:12] us. He's bought us. Christ purchased you
[4:31:16] &gt;&gt; at Calvary. He bought you.
[4:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're no longer your own. He
[4:31:21] purchased you. You are his.
[4:31:24] &gt;&gt; God is watching over you. You're his
[4:31:26] property.
[4:31:28] &gt;&gt; That's why the devil wants you.
[4:31:31] &gt;&gt; You're God's property. He's an enemy,
[4:31:33] but he lost.
[4:31:36] &gt;&gt; We've read he's lost.
[4:31:43] He has bought us for a purpose. We are
[4:31:45] kings.
[4:31:47] &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm a king."
[4:31:49] &gt;&gt; I'm a king.
[4:31:50] &gt;&gt; I'm an absolute king.
[4:31:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We are kings. We're spiritual
[4:31:56] kings. Oh, we're going to be kings upon
[4:31:58] the earth with him when he sits upon his
[4:32:00] throne. Great statement. But now,
[4:32:04] &gt;&gt; now,
[4:32:05] &gt;&gt; but now,
[4:32:07] &gt;&gt; now we are spiritual kings.
[4:32:10] [Applause]
[4:32:11] &gt;&gt; By your testimony,
[4:32:14] &gt;&gt; but now,
[4:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:32:16] &gt;&gt; I'm a spiritual king. Can you say that?
[4:32:18] But now,
[4:32:20] &gt;&gt; I am a spiritual king.
[4:32:24] &gt;&gt; We reign over a spiritual kingdom.
[4:32:27] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[4:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. For brother Bram takes Romans
[4:32:31] 5:17, "For by one man's offense, death
[4:32:33] reigned by one. Much more they which
[4:32:36] receive the abundance of grace and of
[4:32:38] the gift of righteousness shall reign in
[4:32:40] life by one Jesus Christ."
[4:32:42] &gt;&gt; Scripture Colossians 1:13, who hath
[4:32:45] delivered us from the power of darkness,
[4:32:47] and has translated us into the kingdom
[4:32:51] reign of his dear son.
[4:32:53] &gt;&gt; Right now we reign with Christ.
[4:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:32:56] &gt;&gt; Right now,
[4:32:57] &gt;&gt; your testimony
[4:32:59] How are you believing?
[4:33:02] &gt;&gt; Great. Right now you are a spiritual
[4:33:05] king
[4:33:07] &gt;&gt; glory reigning with Christ.
[4:33:11] &gt;&gt; Having dominion
[4:33:15] &gt;&gt; come on kings.
[4:33:16] &gt;&gt; Come on queens.
[4:33:18] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said you are.
[4:33:20] That's what God said through a prophet.
[4:33:22] You are
[4:33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. having dominion over sin,
[4:33:27] &gt;&gt; the world, your flesh,
[4:33:30] &gt;&gt; the devil.
[4:33:32] &gt;&gt; That's overcoming power.
[4:33:38] &gt;&gt; Sounds good to me, brother Tim.
[4:33:41] &gt;&gt; Showing forth his praise and glory,
[4:33:44] &gt;&gt; showing forth himself.
[4:33:49] &gt;&gt; And they overcame him by the blood of
[4:33:50] the lamb and by the word of their
[4:33:52] testimony. And they love not their
[4:33:53] lives. to death.
[4:33:55] &gt;&gt; How's your How are you believing?
[4:33:58] &gt;&gt; Good. Sounding good. Carlos, how are we
[4:34:00] believing back there?
[4:34:02] &gt;&gt; Good.
[4:34:03] &gt;&gt; It's by your testimony.
[4:34:06] &gt;&gt; Go believing.
[4:34:07] &gt;&gt; Go rejoicing.
[4:34:09] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[4:34:11] &gt;&gt; Listening.
[4:34:16] He says, "Now let's liken that today.
[4:34:20] Palestine belonged to Israel.
[4:34:23] They were dwell that that was in their
[4:34:25] dwelling place. You see, that was their
[4:34:29] dwelling place for Israel to dwell in.
[4:34:31] This body is yours.
[4:34:34] &gt;&gt; Come on. Now, we're going to get it down
[4:34:36] to your address. Spiritual kinks
[4:34:39] &gt;&gt; reigning over
[4:34:40] &gt;&gt; sin, the world, flesh, the devil.
[4:34:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm reading from your
[4:34:48] your inheritance. Amen.
[4:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:34:51] &gt;&gt; I'm reading from the word of God
[4:34:53] tonight.
[4:34:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:34:56] &gt;&gt; Listen. He said, "The body's yours. God
[4:34:59] gave it to you. It's your dwelling
[4:35:01] place. God wants you to have it. But the
[4:35:03] devil has moved in with cancer,
[4:35:06] tuberculosis,
[4:35:07] diseases. You say, "I'll take him out.
[4:35:11] I'll do this. I'll do that." But you
[4:35:14] know what? Something's happened. The
[4:35:16] pillar of fire has come amongst us.
[4:35:23] &gt;&gt; The captain of the Lord of hosts is
[4:35:25] here.
[4:35:28] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[4:35:29] &gt;&gt; yes. Every devil that's got the people
[4:35:31] bound tonight is scared to death.
[4:35:36] &gt;&gt; I believe that same God is here tonight.
[4:35:40] &gt;&gt; And those devils are scared to death.
[4:35:46] Hallelujah.
[4:35:48] &gt;&gt; You know what he says? Sure they are.
[4:35:51] &gt;&gt; I thought you heard he's the same
[4:35:52] yesterday. Come on, brother. You said
[4:35:55] this morning. He's the same yesterday,
[4:35:57] today, and forever.
[4:35:58] &gt;&gt; If they were afraid under a prophet's
[4:36:00] ministry,
[4:36:03] they are afraid under a bride's
[4:36:04] ministry.
[4:36:06] [Music]
[4:36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. She is the final voice to the
[4:36:11] final age under her messenger.
[4:36:15] And the devil's scared tonight because
[4:36:18] young people are getting anointed
[4:36:24] &gt;&gt; because elders are getting anointed.
[4:36:28] &gt;&gt; People are getting anointed.
[4:36:34] &gt;&gt; Glory. Don't miss it. Don't miss it.
[4:36:38] &gt;&gt; Don't cool your jets. Don't do that.
[4:36:40] Don't not do that.
[4:36:42] You press yourself in.
[4:36:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "Whatever God's got, I want
[4:36:46] what God has."
[4:36:50] &gt;&gt; Don't you be a spectator now. You press
[4:36:52] yourself into the kingdom of God.
[4:36:56] &gt;&gt; This is not a time to cool off. This is
[4:36:59] a time to press in.
[4:37:02] [Music]
[4:37:05] &gt;&gt; We are. You are. God is.
[4:37:08] &gt;&gt; He's amongst us.
[4:37:14] You say, "I'll take him out.
[4:37:19] &gt;&gt; I'll do this. I'll do that."
[4:37:23] But you know something? Something
[4:37:25] happened.
[4:37:27] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire has come amongst us.
[4:37:30] &gt;&gt; The captain of the Lord of hosts is
[4:37:31] here.
[4:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:37:34] &gt;&gt; Why did these Philistines go forth
[4:37:36] faint? Why did Jericho faint? Why did
[4:37:40] they faint? Because they heard of the
[4:37:41] great exploits.
[4:37:44] &gt;&gt; Glory. They are fainting tonight.
[4:37:47] &gt;&gt; Because of the exploits.
[4:37:52] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[4:37:53] They are nervous that you're actually
[4:37:55] going to get this.
[4:38:00] &gt;&gt; And we are getting it. And they are
[4:38:02] fainting.
[4:38:07] Glory to God.
[4:38:08] &gt;&gt; Glory. Brother Brandham said they are
[4:38:10] fainting
[4:38:12] &gt;&gt; the same way that the Philistines did.
[4:38:14] &gt;&gt; Why did Jericho faint? Because the
[4:38:17] people had the promise was on the road
[4:38:20] and they're coming in.
[4:38:24] [Applause]
[4:38:27] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[4:38:29] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[4:38:33] I am so thankful we don't have a captain
[4:38:35] here that says a little water over here
[4:38:37] and a little water over there. We got a
[4:38:40] pastor that said, "Let's go.
[4:38:47] Glory.
[4:38:49] This is what I believe." Saints
[4:38:53] &gt;&gt; a little water over here. Fellas, you
[4:38:55] got a problem? Oh, don't bother me with
[4:38:57] that. What are you talking about?
[4:39:01] [Applause]
[4:39:03] My Bible says when one suffers we all
[4:39:05] suffer.
[4:39:07] &gt;&gt; But my Bible also says when one
[4:39:08] rejoices.
[4:39:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:39:20] &gt;&gt; Glory,
[4:39:25] &gt;&gt; sir. They're fainting saints of God.
[4:39:27] Why? because we are coming into our
[4:39:29] promise.
[4:39:31] &gt;&gt; And the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[4:39:34] shall rise when, brother Tom, it could
[4:39:37] happen tonight.
[4:39:42] &gt;&gt; We've sung about it for 30 years. Now,
[4:39:44] let's see the manifestation of it.
[4:39:46] Brother Bram said in the message, boy,
[4:39:48] what is the Holy Ghost given for? To
[4:39:50] raise the dead.
[4:39:54] &gt;&gt; Who's going to call him for? You and I.
[4:39:58] [Music]
[4:40:02] This whole world will never hold me.
[4:40:04] &gt;&gt; Never ever ever going to hold me.
[4:40:08] [Applause]
[4:40:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had the promise was on the road
[4:40:17] to come in. Amen. And that's the one
[4:40:20] that's got the promise. The people. The
[4:40:21] covenant people.
[4:40:23] &gt;&gt; The covenant people. We've been going
[4:40:25] over the covenant
[4:40:26] &gt;&gt; the last few services. When God gives a
[4:40:28] covenant, it is unconditional and it's
[4:40:31] given by grace. Abraham had nothing to
[4:40:33] do with it. God had everything to do
[4:40:35] with it.
[4:40:37] &gt;&gt; And when God gives a covenant, saints of
[4:40:39] God, he's not an Indian giver.
[4:40:42] &gt;&gt; He does not give it to you one day and
[4:40:43] take it back the next. If God has given
[4:40:45] you a covenant, it is forever.
[4:40:49] &gt;&gt; Lori. Lori.
[4:40:53] Listen. Samson, listen. Samson, listen.
[4:40:56] &gt;&gt; He was under a covenant.
[4:40:58] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[4:41:00] &gt;&gt; He beat the devil down hip and thigh.
[4:41:02] &gt;&gt; Tore a lion in a half like a kid. Is
[4:41:05] that true?
[4:41:06] &gt;&gt; Took the gates of his city far gate and
[4:41:08] all.
[4:41:10] &gt;&gt; But his eyes got turned away.
[4:41:13] &gt;&gt; But God will never forget his covenant.
[4:41:18] &gt;&gt; You might have turned away, young
[4:41:20] people, but God remember his covenant.
[4:41:30] All right.
[4:41:32] &gt;&gt; Can I give you a scripture?
[4:41:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:41:34] &gt;&gt; Can I give you a scripture I've been
[4:41:36] wanting to say for just the last few
[4:41:38] weeks and can't get it out, but tonight
[4:41:41] I'll say it.
[4:41:42] &gt;&gt; How be it,
[4:41:44] &gt;&gt; the hair of his head began to grow.
[4:41:52] Hallelujah. God saw him in the prison.
[4:41:56] &gt;&gt; God saw him down there.
[4:41:58] &gt;&gt; And God remembered his covenant.
[4:42:04] [Music]
[4:42:08] &gt;&gt; God has given you a covenant. You might
[4:42:10] have gone wayward one day, but he
[4:42:12] remembered his covenant to you.
[4:42:17] &gt;&gt; What was the cry of Samson? God, one
[4:42:19] more time. I've had many victories when
[4:42:22] I was a young boy, Joel. But my hair
[4:42:25] started to grow and I remember my
[4:42:28] covenant with you.
[4:42:33] &gt;&gt; Glory. And it's unconditional.
[4:42:36] &gt;&gt; And you and I have been given a token
[4:42:38] promise. Brother Ram call it a token
[4:42:40] covenant.
[4:42:41] [Applause]
[4:42:45] [Music]
[4:42:46] Come on.
[4:42:48] &gt;&gt; Your children were talking about
[4:42:53] [Applause]
[4:42:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:43:00] &gt;&gt; Glory be to Jesus.
[4:43:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:43:05] &gt;&gt; They overcame by the blood of the lamb
[4:43:07] and by the words of their testimony. I
[4:43:10] believe Jesus saves.
[4:43:12] &gt;&gt; I believe Jesus is alive. I believe that
[4:43:14] word is burning in my soul tonight.
[4:43:17] [Applause]
[4:43:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:43:22] &gt;&gt; As I was with Moses.
[4:43:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:43:24] &gt;&gt; As I was with Moses.
[4:43:26] &gt;&gt; So shall I be with you Joshua.
[4:43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did he do? Meditated on the
[4:43:31] word of God day and night.
[4:43:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, today is it rapture. Today is it
[4:43:37] the change. Amen.
[4:43:42] &gt;&gt; Spiritual kings
[4:43:44] &gt;&gt; having dominion now.
[4:43:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:43:48] &gt;&gt; As I was with Moses, whatsoever things
[4:43:50] you desire when you pray.
[4:43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:43:54] &gt;&gt; Believe and you will receive them.
[4:43:58] [Music]
[4:44:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You heard. She will do the
[4:44:02] greater works.
[4:44:04] &gt;&gt; Those greater works, saints of hear.
[4:44:08] Hallelujah.
[4:44:10] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[4:44:12] &gt;&gt; But believing that those things that you
[4:44:14] say shall come to pass, you will have
[4:44:15] it. Whatsoever he says,
[4:44:18] &gt;&gt; he says, "Whatsoever you confess,
[4:44:20] &gt;&gt; how's your believing?"
[4:44:22] &gt;&gt; Great.
[4:44:24] &gt;&gt; If in your heart tonight, if you're
[4:44:26] dying with heart trouble,
[4:44:27] &gt;&gt; now listen, saints of God, listen,
[4:44:29] saints. We don't have a prophet here to
[4:44:31] discern you,
[4:44:33] &gt;&gt; but the word of God is still a discerner
[4:44:34] of the thought, the intent of the heart.
[4:44:37] He's still a word. Is that true?
[4:44:39] &gt;&gt; And here here now here. Brother Brown, I
[4:44:42] just listened to him yesterday. He said,
[4:44:43] "You've come to service."
[4:44:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "You've come to service." One
[4:44:46] more time. He said, "You've come to
[4:44:48] service." He says, "Now, it might not go
[4:44:50] on for a couple of weeks, but you will
[4:44:52] find out you're whole. You're healed.
[4:44:55] God has given you what you've desired
[4:44:58] &gt;&gt; cuz his word cannot return unto him
[4:45:02] void."
[4:45:05] How is your believing?
[4:45:10] [Applause]
[4:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:45:14] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[4:45:16] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[4:45:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Whatsoever you confess, if you
[4:45:19] in your heart tonight, if you're dying
[4:45:21] with heart trouble,
[4:45:22] &gt;&gt; listen, saints, I don't even know. We
[4:45:24] could have I could have had heart
[4:45:25] blockage. For all I know, for the last
[4:45:27] 10 years, some service, God just comes
[4:45:30] down. Sweet Holy Spirit, come move,
[4:45:32] flutter over us.
[4:45:35] &gt;&gt; Go see a heart specialist and say, "You
[4:45:37] don't have that gene anymore."
[4:45:40] [Applause]
[4:45:42] [Music]
[4:45:42] [Applause]
[4:45:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[4:45:46] &gt;&gt; How is your believing tonight?
[4:45:48] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[4:45:51] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your problem is
[4:45:52] tonight. My Jesus lives.
[4:45:56] [Applause]
[4:46:02] Amen.
[4:46:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:46:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You might been dying with
[4:46:10] heart trouble. You might have got
[4:46:11] cancer. You uh if you would believe with
[4:46:14] all your heart, something's anchored in
[4:46:16] there and you believe Jesus and I
[4:46:18] believe with all my heart. Now I accept
[4:46:20] him as my healer. I believe your soul
[4:46:22] believes I'm healed.
[4:46:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He does miracles.
[4:46:29] &gt;&gt; How's your believing?
[4:46:31] &gt;&gt; So great.
[4:46:32] &gt;&gt; He does miracles. So great.
[4:46:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, let him that's weak say, I am
[4:46:38] &gt;&gt; strong.
[4:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:46:41] &gt;&gt; Just say in your heart, I'm now strong.
[4:46:46] &gt;&gt; I'm now strong.
[4:46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's by your testimony.
[4:46:52] &gt;&gt; I am strong. I have now accepted Jesus
[4:46:54] as my healer. and never have any
[4:46:57] negative testimony anymore. Just believe
[4:46:59] it. God is under obligation.
[4:47:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is sitting at the right
[4:47:04] hand of the father to accept you
[4:47:07] &gt;&gt; for he's sitting there as the high
[4:47:08] priest of your confession to make it
[4:47:11] good before the father.
[4:47:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now divine healing brother said
[4:47:20] cannot be any planer than that. Amen.
[4:47:23] Amen.
[4:47:25] &gt;&gt; It's to the weakest.
[4:47:28] &gt;&gt; Remember, God's word will defeat Satan.
[4:47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:47:33] &gt;&gt; Any place,
[4:47:34] &gt;&gt; anytime,
[4:47:36] &gt;&gt; anywhere,
[4:47:37] [Applause]
[4:47:40] [Music]
[4:47:46] &gt;&gt; we're being equipped
[4:47:47] &gt;&gt; by the word.
[4:47:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:47:55] Now, healing
[4:47:58] is not something you just say, "Oh,
[4:47:59] yeah. I believe it. I believe it."
[4:48:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's that's all right if
[4:48:08] that's the best you can do just
[4:48:09] mentally." Or just say, "Yes, I believe
[4:48:13] that. I accept it." Then if you accept
[4:48:15] it on those basis, keep now then saying
[4:48:18] it over. Yes.
[4:48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:48:22] &gt;&gt; You know, we got to get away of coming
[4:48:24] up front next week. Coming up front next
[4:48:26] week. Coming up front next week. Coming
[4:48:28] up. Just keep on saying it.
[4:48:30] &gt;&gt; I'm healed.
[4:48:32] &gt;&gt; By his stripes, I'm whole.
[4:48:34] &gt;&gt; Go home. I'm healed.
[4:48:36] &gt;&gt; Go to work. I'm healed.
[4:48:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:48:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, John Ryan.
[4:48:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, John Ryan.
[4:48:47] That's a principle.
[4:48:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:48:49] &gt;&gt; The right mental attitude towards any
[4:48:51] promise of God. He will bring it to
[4:48:53] pass.
[4:48:55] &gt;&gt; Just keep saying it over and over and
[4:48:57] over.
[4:48:58] &gt;&gt; Let your testimony be.
[4:49:01] &gt;&gt; I am filled with God.
[4:49:03] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God.
[4:49:07] [Applause]
[4:49:10] &gt;&gt; Say it out loud.
[4:49:13] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God.
[4:49:18] &gt;&gt; Say it out loud. He said
[4:49:21] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Say it over.
[4:49:24] &gt;&gt; Now we are the sons of God.
[4:49:27] &gt;&gt; Now I am a son of God.
[4:49:29] &gt;&gt; I have got the devil's answer.
[4:49:32] [Applause]
[4:49:36] &gt;&gt; We have overcome.
[4:49:45] That's the word.
[4:49:47] &gt;&gt; Say it over.
[4:49:48] &gt;&gt; Keep saying it.
[4:49:50] &gt;&gt; I am healed.
[4:49:51] &gt;&gt; I am healed.
[4:49:52] &gt;&gt; I am healed.
[4:49:54] &gt;&gt; Till finally you actually believe it.
[4:49:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And when you believe it, then
[4:49:59] it's going to take place.
[4:50:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:50:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:50:04] &gt;&gt; Every time when you confess, well, I
[4:50:07] feel a little bad today. How many of us
[4:50:09] have felt bad since camp?
[4:50:12] Oh yeah, there's some honest souls out
[4:50:13] there. Man, the next day I couldn't even
[4:50:16] drag myself out of bed.
[4:50:20] And God bless my little queen.
[4:50:23] &gt;&gt; She has taught me over the years. Get
[4:50:25] up.
[4:50:29] &gt;&gt; Look out, brothers, that are looking to
[4:50:31] marry a nurse.
[4:50:36] Get out of bed. I thought they were
[4:50:38] supposed to wait on you hand and foot.
[4:50:43] Hey, I love a good confession.
[4:50:46] &gt;&gt; How you feeling, honey?
[4:50:48] &gt;&gt; Great.
[4:50:51] &gt;&gt; Get you out of bed.
[4:50:53] &gt;&gt; It'll get you cleaned up.
[4:50:55] &gt;&gt; It'll get you in your in your clothes.
[4:50:58] &gt;&gt; And then after a little while, you're
[4:51:00] not feeling so bad.
[4:51:02] &gt;&gt; And then all of a sudden, it gets you a
[4:51:03] little bit of faith. By his stripes, I
[4:51:05] am healed. By his stripes, I am healed.
[4:51:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:51:08] &gt;&gt; And my throat is shot. I feel like I
[4:51:10] like I got hit by a train. But praise
[4:51:12] the Lord,
[4:51:14] &gt;&gt; we're running over the devil on a
[4:51:15] runaway train.
[4:51:19] &gt;&gt; Why? We got a positive confession.
[4:51:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He said, "You'll never
[4:51:26] live above your confession."
[4:51:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the high priest of our
[4:51:31] confession. Any scholar knows that. He
[4:51:34] said profession is confession translated
[4:51:37] the same. He sits on the right hand of
[4:51:39] the father interceding upon that.
[4:51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:51:46] He says now he cannot heal you
[4:51:50] &gt;&gt; or cannot save you
[4:51:54] &gt;&gt; or do one thing for you
[4:51:57] &gt;&gt; until first you accept it.
[4:52:01] &gt;&gt; Confess it.
[4:52:02] &gt;&gt; How's your believing?
[4:52:04] He said, "Believe it."
[4:52:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. You've got to confess it.
[4:52:10] &gt;&gt; Not your feeling.
[4:52:15] &gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with your
[4:52:16] feelings
[4:52:18] &gt;&gt; because tomorrow you could feel rotten.
[4:52:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "I wish I was at camp." It has
[4:52:23] nothing to do with your feelings. It has
[4:52:25] everything to do with your believing.
[4:52:30] Amen.
[4:52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:52:35] &gt;&gt; I accept it. I believe it. I confess it.
[4:52:39] &gt;&gt; It's not how you feel it.
[4:52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:52:43] &gt;&gt; He is not the high priest of your
[4:52:45] feelings.
[4:52:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'd love a 100% amen on that one,
[4:52:51] Brother Tom.
[4:52:53] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with your feelings.
[4:52:55] It has everything to do with your
[4:52:56] believing.
[4:52:57] &gt;&gt; And let that be your testimony. Amen.
[4:53:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:53:02] &gt;&gt; It's what you confess. Now, if you'll
[4:53:04] get prayed for, sit in the building this
[4:53:07] afternoon, the Holy Spirit move in here,
[4:53:09] you'd feel his blessed presence.
[4:53:12] &gt;&gt; And everyone and you would walk out and
[4:53:14] say, "Well,
[4:53:16] I feel as bad as I did when I went in.
[4:53:18] He couldn't do a thing for you.
[4:53:21] &gt;&gt; Not a thing.
[4:53:22] &gt;&gt; Well, I accept it now." And then in the
[4:53:25] morning, get up. Well, I got a headache.
[4:53:29] I still feel as bad as I did. Then you
[4:53:32] drop right down.
[4:53:34] &gt;&gt; Way down. You'll never live above your
[4:53:38] confession.
[4:53:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care how we feel, young people,
[4:53:44] ever again.
[4:53:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care how you feel.
[4:53:48] &gt;&gt; You go by how you believe.
[4:53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:53:52] [Music]
[4:53:53] &gt;&gt; How do you believe? You'll never live
[4:53:56] above your confession. Let the
[4:53:58] saintliest person, this is a this is an
[4:54:01] incredible statement. Let the saintliest
[4:54:05] person in this bill building right now
[4:54:07] just make up in your mind you're not a
[4:54:09] Christian anymore.
[4:54:14] &gt;&gt; And you wonder some of you guys
[4:54:15] backsliding whatever.
[4:54:17] &gt;&gt; You just don't want to be.
[4:54:19] &gt;&gt; Listen what he says. He says,
[4:54:23] "The saintliest Christian
[4:54:26] &gt;&gt; in this building, just make up in your
[4:54:29] mind you're not a Christian anymore.
[4:54:31] &gt;&gt; Then you will not be a Christian."
[4:54:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, how's your believing?
[4:54:40] &gt;&gt; It's being recorded.
[4:54:42] &gt;&gt; There's a recording angel here.
[4:54:44] &gt;&gt; Can you wave your hand and say it?
[4:54:46] Great, Brother Tom.
[4:54:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go by my feelings
[4:54:50] anymore. I'm going to go by faith.
[4:54:52] &gt;&gt; For I'm going to overcome by the blood
[4:54:54] of the lamb and by my testimony.
[4:54:59] [Applause]
[4:55:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:55:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:55:05] &gt;&gt; No, I used to be. I'm not no more.
[4:55:08] You're fallen from grace right then.
[4:55:12] &gt;&gt; It's faith. It's either faith or
[4:55:15] unbelief.
[4:55:17] &gt;&gt; You're possessed with two powers. either
[4:55:19] faith or unbelief. And if you got faith,
[4:55:22] you're saved because you are a believer.
[4:55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:55:28] &gt;&gt; So now, saints of God, you that would
[4:55:30] sit back and let the devil run over you.
[4:55:33] Shame on you.
[4:55:35] &gt;&gt; We overcome by the bleeding word
[4:55:38] &gt;&gt; and by our testimony.
[4:55:40] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God.
[4:55:42] [Applause]
[4:55:46] &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God.
[4:55:51] Amen.
[4:55:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:55:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:55:58] &gt;&gt; One hour, we're done.
[4:56:01] &gt;&gt; Can I give you a little testimony?
[4:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:56:07] &gt;&gt; And sometimes things happen you do not
[4:56:10] understand.
[4:56:12] You wonder whether they did happen.
[4:56:16] Remember
[4:56:18] my last service here
[4:56:22] journey to liberty
[4:56:24] &gt;&gt; Sunday morning then Wednesday night then
[4:56:25] we went to camp my last quote
[4:56:29] my last quote I left off
[4:56:34] wouldn't you like to live where you're
[4:56:35] conscious of the unseen world
[4:56:40] &gt;&gt; wouldn't you like to live in that realm
[4:56:42] I believe God is pulling us into that
[4:56:43] realm into the unseen realm he said
[4:56:45] wouldn't you like to live in that realm.
[4:56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where where you are all the and
[4:56:50] you realize it all the time to realize
[4:56:52] when you walk out there, you get in your
[4:56:54] car
[4:56:56] &gt;&gt; and angels take their position to your
[4:56:59] side.
[4:57:00] &gt;&gt; When you walk up yonder to that man not
[4:57:03] so unloly to you that the Holy Spirit's
[4:57:05] standing there above you and angels all
[4:57:07] around you. He said, "Is that right,
[4:57:09] Brother Brandham?" The Bible said so.
[4:57:12] And the angels of God are encamped about
[4:57:16] them.
[4:57:17] &gt;&gt; They don't go to heaven
[4:57:20] &gt;&gt; back to heaven.
[4:57:21] &gt;&gt; He says they go with you.
[4:57:24] &gt;&gt; They're sent on a mission
[4:57:26] &gt;&gt; to watch over you on life's journey.
[4:57:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:57:33] &gt;&gt; Last quote. We close the service.
[4:57:36] Thursday morning. We're getting ready to
[4:57:39] pick up brother Kyre.
[4:57:41] Getting all ready. Joanne's getting all
[4:57:43] the uh wares and everything, all our
[4:57:45] clothes, all our bedding ready for camp.
[4:57:49] I got I I'll run in and get Brother
[4:57:51] Kyre. I'll I'll run in and get Brother
[4:57:53] Kaid and I'll pick them up at the
[4:57:55] airport. Raining, pouring rain, and
[4:57:57] Joanne was left at home. And I've got
[4:58:00] I've got I've got the the meetings on my
[4:58:03] mind. I got you young people on my
[4:58:05] heart. Ah, God, would you come down?
[4:58:09] Would you speak in an unusual way? Lord,
[4:58:12] you've been moving and all we want is a
[4:58:13] greater move of God. You're pondering
[4:58:16] these things and I wonder if I'm going
[4:58:17] to get the airport on time. I maybe left
[4:58:19] it a little bit late and I try a
[4:58:21] shortcut and I go down a certain road by
[4:58:24] the berry farms and I get on the King
[4:58:26] George Highway and they're working all
[4:58:28] over uh doing building the shoulders and
[4:58:31] you know how they got those big orange
[4:58:33] uh pylons and they've moved all
[4:58:35] everything over and and and I'm going
[4:58:38] down the road and I'm just thinking I
[4:58:39] got to get Brother Kyre and God help me
[4:58:41] to keep under the limit.
[4:58:45] That's probably one of my biggest
[4:58:47] weaknesses. I've got to get myself a
[4:58:49] four-cylinder,
[4:58:54] but I got to get there. And that's the
[4:58:56] kind of guy I am. And I want to get
[4:58:59] there. I hate being late. Going down the
[4:59:02] road. And the yellow line is moved. And
[4:59:06] I'm way over in the left lane. And the
[4:59:08] pylons are there. And I'm going, did I
[4:59:10] miss a lane here? I should be over on
[4:59:13] the other side. Here comes this Mercedes
[4:59:15] man. He's coming as fast as I'm going.
[4:59:17] And I'm going, well, I guess that's it.
[4:59:21] And then a little quote came by my way.
[4:59:24] The angels do not leave.
[4:59:28] &gt;&gt; They camp about them that fear God.
[4:59:30] &gt;&gt; I looked at that Mercedes. I figured
[4:59:32] this is it. I don't know how we got
[4:59:34] left, and I don't know how I got right,
[4:59:36] but I went down that road singing to the
[4:59:38] glory of God.
[4:59:39] [Applause]
[4:59:41] &gt;&gt; Is he real?
[4:59:44] &gt;&gt; To me, he's real.
[4:59:46] But that's not it. My little
[4:59:48] sweetheart's at home. She's working
[4:59:50] around the house. And at the same time
[4:59:52] I'm going through this. God has put her
[4:59:54] into prayer saying, "Lord, bless the
[4:59:57] camp. Bless brother Cyra. Watch over my
[4:59:59] husband on the road."
[5:00:01] &gt;&gt; I say, "God is in the midst of his
[5:00:04] people at Cain."
[5:00:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:00:07] &gt;&gt; Does he know where you are? Absolutely.
[5:00:11] &gt;&gt; Can you overcome? I have already
[5:00:13] overcome.
[5:00:17] Hallelujah.
[5:00:18] &gt;&gt; We're these are things saints of God you
[5:00:20] read back in the days of old.
[5:00:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[5:00:27] &gt;&gt; today.
[5:00:30] [Music]
[5:00:32] &gt;&gt; How's your believing?
[5:00:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To God be the glory.
[5:00:39] &gt;&gt; Great things he has done. Musicians, why
[5:00:41] don't you come?
[5:00:43] Hallelujah.
[5:00:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:00:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:01:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:01:05] Kadesh Barnea at Kadesh Barnea.
[5:01:11] covenant people.
[5:01:16] This covenant people, Israel, down in
[5:01:17] Egypt on account of disobedience and
[5:01:19] selling of their brother Joseph
[5:01:22] &gt;&gt; and was taken down in Egypt and was
[5:01:24] there 400 years under bondage. But I
[5:01:27] want you to notice
[5:01:29] they never lost their covenant.
[5:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:01:32] &gt;&gt; They lost their freedom.
[5:01:35] &gt;&gt; Not their covenant. And when God made a
[5:01:38] covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[5:01:41] that he swore by himself that he would
[5:01:43] save Abraham and his seed after him.
[5:01:46] God's duty bound to keep that promise.
[5:01:52] &gt;&gt; He's just as duty bound to you on that
[5:01:54] promise as he was to Abraham on his
[5:01:57] journey.
[5:01:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. Because you're
[5:02:01] Abraham's seed.
[5:02:05] How do you become Abraham's seed? You're
[5:02:07] dead in Christ and you take on Abraham's
[5:02:10] seed.
[5:02:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[5:02:13] &gt;&gt; Bible says, "And then you're heir
[5:02:15] according to that promise."
[5:02:18] &gt;&gt; That God's just as duty bound to you as
[5:02:20] he was to Abraham. Say that would take
[5:02:22] all the scare out of it. God don't want
[5:02:25] you scared of nothing.
[5:02:28] &gt;&gt; Rest solemnly upon what he has said.
[5:02:33] Amen.
[5:02:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:02:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:02:35] &gt;&gt; In the good times,
[5:02:37] &gt;&gt; praise his name.
[5:02:39] &gt;&gt; In the bad times,
[5:02:41] &gt;&gt; do the same. And in everything,
[5:02:44] &gt;&gt; let's stand and give him the glory. In
[5:02:47] the good times
[5:02:50] in
[5:02:54] everything,
[5:02:55] [Music]
[5:02:57] give him thank.
[5:03:00] Just give him
[5:03:02] [Applause]
[5:03:09] everything
[5:03:11] [Music]
[5:03:15] [Applause]
[5:03:17] [Music]
[5:03:20] in the
[5:03:22] just praise his name
[5:03:26] and in the baptism.
[5:03:30] to the
[5:03:34] in
[5:03:37] [Music]
[5:03:39] the king of
[5:03:41] all.
[5:03:45] Hallelujah.
[5:03:46] [Music]
[5:03:56] Give me
[5:03:59] just
[5:04:08] [Applause]
[5:04:10] [Music]
[5:04:16] [Music]
[5:04:33] everything.
[5:04:41] Let's do it one more time as we get
[5:04:43] ready to close.
[5:04:44] [Music]
[5:05:00] Hallelujah.
[5:05:02] [Music]
[5:05:10] Yeah.
[5:05:16] Heat.
[5:05:26] Heat.
[5:05:34] Heat.
[5:05:37] [Music]
[5:05:44] Hallelujah.
[5:05:46] &gt;&gt; Have we got a lot to thank him for
[5:05:48] tonight?
[5:05:50] &gt;&gt; We certainly do.
[5:05:53] [Music]
[5:05:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:05:57] &gt;&gt; Is he still the same?
[5:05:59] &gt;&gt; He is absolutely the same.
[5:06:02] &gt;&gt; As we said on Wednesday night as the
[5:06:05] young people were coming,
[5:06:06] &gt;&gt; what is the attraction on the mountain?
[5:06:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham took that that subject.
[5:06:11] What is the attraction on the mountain?
[5:06:14] He said it was God
[5:06:16] &gt;&gt; fulfilling his word.
[5:06:18] &gt;&gt; So you say, well then what is this been
[5:06:20] happening around us? What is this great
[5:06:22] attraction that's going on? I want to
[5:06:24] say to you, it's God
[5:06:27] &gt;&gt; fulfilling his word. Once again,
[5:06:33] [Music]
[5:06:37] &gt;&gt; brother Brennham takes John the Baptist
[5:06:39] as brother Bisll was saying about John
[5:06:41] this morning
[5:06:44] and he's standing in the River Jordan
[5:06:46] and he's baptizing and the different
[5:06:48] ones had come to see him's baptism
[5:06:51] and they said, "Are are are you the
[5:06:53] Christ?"
[5:06:56] And brother Bram said, "No." Oh, he just
[5:06:57] pointed himself back to the word.
[5:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:07:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the voice
[5:07:02] &gt;&gt; of him that crith in the wilderness,
[5:07:04] &gt;&gt; prepare ye the way of the Lord."
[5:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:07:08] &gt;&gt; He knew who he was. He knew he was
[5:07:09] Isaiah 40 fulfilled.
[5:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:07:14] &gt;&gt; But there was a time then when Jesus
[5:07:15] came to Jordan to be baptized. Yes, sir.
[5:07:18] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram says a wonderful thing.
[5:07:20] It says it changed then from the prophet
[5:07:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:07:24] &gt;&gt; to his prophecies.
[5:07:26] Yeah.
[5:07:27] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to you, there's a
[5:07:28] prophet that came today.
[5:07:30] &gt;&gt; And he's prophesied.
[5:07:32] &gt;&gt; There will be a super church.
[5:07:34] &gt;&gt; There will be a super race.
[5:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's turning from the prophet
[5:07:39] to the prophecy.
[5:07:41] &gt;&gt; What is the attraction? God fulfilling
[5:07:45] that prophesied word again.
[5:07:48] &gt;&gt; And how did they overcome?
[5:07:51] by the blood of the lamb
[5:07:53] &gt;&gt; and by the word of their testimony.
[5:07:57] &gt;&gt; What is their testimony? Jesus lives.
[5:08:00] &gt;&gt; Where does Jesus live?
[5:08:03] &gt;&gt; He's living in me. He's living in you.
[5:08:05] Keep that testimony high, young people.
[5:08:10] &gt;&gt; Speak positive.
[5:08:12] &gt;&gt; And as as many as believed him,
[5:08:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. gave he them
[5:08:18] &gt;&gt; power
[5:08:19] &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God.
[5:08:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe?
[5:08:24] &gt;&gt; How's your believing?
[5:08:25] &gt;&gt; Very great tonight.
[5:08:28] &gt;&gt; Go in this thy might.
[5:08:30] &gt;&gt; Go in the word of God.
[5:08:32] &gt;&gt; Be strengthened by thus sayeth the Lord.
[5:08:35] &gt;&gt; Do not go by your feelings. You go by
[5:08:37] the word of God. Amen.
[5:08:39] &gt;&gt; By this message,
[5:08:41] &gt;&gt; by your testimony,
[5:08:43] &gt;&gt; you watch God come behind it. The same
[5:08:45] way he vindicate that prophet, he'll
[5:08:47] vindicate the word of God in you.
[5:08:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Amen.
[5:08:52] &gt;&gt; Praise him.
[5:08:54] &gt;&gt; We thank him tonight.
[5:08:56] &gt;&gt; That he is a living savior.
[5:08:58] &gt;&gt; That I can say tonight through song, he
[5:09:00] lives. He lives. Christ Jesus lives in
[5:09:04] me.

[5:12:53] think it's it's worthy of it. We've got
[5:12:55] the time, don't we?
[5:12:57] &gt;&gt; There's many young people that came up
[5:13:01] and gave testimony on Wednesday night,
[5:13:06] but maybe there's 10 of you that haven't
[5:13:07] yet, and you say, "I know I got
[5:13:10] delivered.
[5:13:11] &gt;&gt; I know Jesus Christ, the word of God,
[5:13:13] delivered me."
[5:13:15] &gt;&gt; And you want to give testimony tonight?
[5:13:17] Yes, sir.
[5:13:18] &gt;&gt; Before the church of the living God.
[5:13:20] &gt;&gt; Say, "God met me in a supernatural way."
[5:13:23] &gt;&gt; And why don't you just get yourself
[5:13:24] ready cuz we're going to have 10
[5:13:26] testimonies.
[5:13:27] &gt;&gt; Something burning in your heart. You
[5:13:29] can't keep it quiet
[5:13:31] &gt;&gt; that you know you've got a testimony.
[5:13:34] [Applause]
[5:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're going to enjoy the
[5:13:38] presence of God.

[5:14:18] angels and a breeze from heaven send
[5:14:22] your spirit
[5:14:24] so real.
[5:14:28] Ooh, but in the valley once more,
[5:14:34] would Jesus still be Lord? That's the
[5:14:38] question.
[5:14:42] Cuz
[5:14:45] believing when believing isn't easy
[5:14:51] that isn't testing
[5:14:54] [Music]
[5:14:55] [Applause]
[5:14:57] cuz I need faith for the time when the
[5:15:03] sun doesn't shine
[5:15:05] and the mountain top is just a memory.

[5:16:15] and doing good, living in a time of
[5:16:19] plenty.
[5:16:20] [Music]
[5:16:24] Oh, but if all that should change,
[5:16:29] will you still keep the faith? That's
[5:16:33] the question.
[5:16:39] Cuz believing when living is easy.
[5:16:45] Oh, that is to see.
[5:16:49] Oh, what I need
[5:16:54] for the time when the sun doesn't shine

[5:19:50] Hallelujah.
[5:19:58] &gt;&gt; Have your seats.
[5:20:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said there's 10. You might want
[5:20:06] to get up here.
[5:20:08] Um,
[5:20:11] let's see. Uh, I guess when when I was
[5:20:13] riding down to the camp with brother
[5:20:15] Isaac Hegamman, he asked me what I was
[5:20:17] what I was expecting from camp and
[5:20:19] didn't quite know how to answer him. But
[5:20:21] all I all I could say I said only one
[5:20:23] thing I know it's going to be better
[5:20:25] than last time. And that's that's pretty
[5:20:28] amazing cuz every time it's
[5:20:31] just blows me away. And uh yeah, it sure
[5:20:35] was. Um,
[5:20:38] I guess guess there's probably a lot I
[5:20:40] could say, but I won't say too much. Um,
[5:20:43] on Friday night,
[5:20:45] well, Thursday night's meeting, I I was
[5:20:47] it really really spoke to me. I just
[5:20:49] just really in a a deep way. I I just
[5:20:52] love love that just to hear about love
[5:20:54] and God's love and how amazing it is and
[5:20:56] what it's doing in my life and each one
[5:20:59] of your lives as I see you grow closer
[5:21:01] to him and one to another as a family.
[5:21:04] And
[5:21:06] um but Friday night was kind of
[5:21:07] different. Um, I didn't even really
[5:21:11] expect to kind of come to like I don't
[5:21:14] know, I guess I didn't really expect
[5:21:16] myself to go to the altar, but somehow I
[5:21:18] just felt kind of smitten in my heart
[5:21:21] some of the things he was saying. And
[5:21:23] and so I went up and um when he prayed
[5:21:26] with me, I know John Curry's uh sure you
[5:21:29] all know he's a really good friend of
[5:21:30] mine and we talk sometimes and he says,
[5:21:33] "You know, Tim, one of the things I
[5:21:34] think you're the only thing you're going
[5:21:35] to ever have to struggle with is like
[5:21:37] mental battles." And it's true like not
[5:21:41] really many things matter to me in life,
[5:21:42] but just God, family, and friends
[5:21:45] basically. It's all I really care about.
[5:21:47] But um so things like usually it doesn't
[5:21:51] don't really bother me, but just mental
[5:21:54] struggles have been kind of a big thing
[5:21:56] for me and and that's what I was going
[5:21:59] up there about. And uh and he prayed
[5:22:01] with me and that's what he prayed for.
[5:22:03] He he prayed that the Lord would deliver
[5:22:06] me from these mental battles.
[5:22:08] And um and brother Tim Dodd came a
[5:22:11] little while after and prayed and also
[5:22:13] prayed that the complexes would go away.
[5:22:16] And so I just I accepted that. And
[5:22:20] &gt;&gt; so I'll give the God the glory.
[5:22:22] [Music]
[5:22:32] &gt;&gt; So we didn't really get to go to camp
[5:22:34] because I can't cross down yet, but I
[5:22:36] will be able to soon. But we did stream
[5:22:39] them and
[5:22:41] um it was first of all so amazing to see
[5:22:44] all the young people especially some of
[5:22:46] the young guys that Phil and I been
[5:22:48] praying for and Phil students. It was
[5:22:50] really moving for us. Um,
[5:22:53] but I think that what what was really
[5:22:56] God worked in me is faith for my family
[5:23:00] because seeing all the young people here
[5:23:03] and then um brother Matthew I don't
[5:23:06] remember his name his last name and his
[5:23:09] family. Uh she
[5:23:12] you huh
[5:23:13] &gt;&gt; Desmond
[5:23:13] &gt;&gt; Desmond is that their last name? how
[5:23:16] last camp he stood up and was beating
[5:23:19] the the thing. I don't remember it's
[5:23:21] called the punching bag. So, um I don't
[5:23:25] know. God's been really giving me faith
[5:23:27] for them and believing because
[5:23:31] I don't know. It's I I I sort of felt
[5:23:34] like I lost the burden a little bit cuz
[5:23:35] I hadn't seen any
[5:23:38] um interest. they didn't have any
[5:23:40] interest and it was just sort of hard
[5:23:43] cuz being the only one but God's really
[5:23:46] been helping me with that and my dad's
[5:23:48] been actually streaming the services
[5:23:50] every Sunday.
[5:23:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[5:23:51] &gt;&gt; So, and and actually just a little
[5:23:54] testimony for him is um he he'd only
[5:23:57] heard brother Bisll cuz he just recently
[5:23:59] started and brother Briscoll went for a
[5:24:01] while. So, brother Tom took a Sunday
[5:24:03] morning service and um it was the one
[5:24:06] that he just mentioned about the the
[5:24:08] journey and my dad's a poet or yeah, he
[5:24:12] loves writing poetry and um so on I
[5:24:17] don't know like Thursday or Friday or
[5:24:18] something. He wrote this poem and on
[5:24:21] Sunday, brother Tomt totally just
[5:24:23] preached about it about he just um what
[5:24:27] he wrote about. So, I don't know. It's
[5:24:30] that really did something for him. and
[5:24:31] he was pretty moved and he was like,
[5:24:32] "Whoa." So anyway, just keep praying for
[5:24:35] them cuz they're coming
[5:24:37] &gt;&gt; and if God can do it for the young
[5:24:39] people here, he can do it for my for my
[5:24:42] family. So anyway,
[5:24:43] [Applause]
[5:24:51] &gt;&gt; thank you. God bless you all. Uh I'm not
[5:24:55] a young uh I'm not single. I'm married.
[5:24:58] But uh the reason why I'm here it's some
[5:25:03] God have been doing things uh kind of
[5:25:05] different way for me and uh this is not
[5:25:08] a past testimony but it's something that
[5:25:10] even happened this morning. Uh I think
[5:25:13] many of you remember that on Wednesday
[5:25:16] brother Tom read my email and uh that
[5:25:19] email actually I wrote it I was I was
[5:25:22] praying and coming out of prayer. I
[5:25:24] thought I should send the email and uh I
[5:25:26] sent the email to brother brother John
[5:25:29] Andy's and copy to you. I don't remember
[5:25:31] if I did it to brother Ed but I think I
[5:25:33] did. But anyways, there's some way that
[5:25:35] really stuck with me when I was praying
[5:25:37] was the ministry is being vindicated.
[5:25:40] It's humble and it's a blessed ministry.
[5:25:44] &gt;&gt; So uh since brother Tom read that email
[5:25:48] then the devil start fighting with me. I
[5:25:50] did not even share this with my wife. I
[5:25:52] kept it secret and I was just praying. I
[5:25:54] knew it was a devil and I was hustled
[5:25:57] away with from a different way. But
[5:25:59] anyways, uh
[5:26:01] the devil was telling me that the
[5:26:04] ministry is not vindicated. It's like
[5:26:06] wow, how would you say such a thing? But
[5:26:09] anyways, I keep praying praying and I
[5:26:12] knew for sure it was a devil because I
[5:26:14] know when the devil talks to me and I
[5:26:16] also when God talks to me. But there's
[5:26:19] few things that I've been uh pondering
[5:26:20] on and studying. One of them was I was
[5:26:23] in uh Luke Luke 7:11. I think you all
[5:26:26] remember the with a woman who had a a
[5:26:29] young man who was dead and then Jesus
[5:26:31] came away and it's just been a great
[5:26:34] great subject to me. I've just been
[5:26:36] pondering about it and praying and just
[5:26:39] was I've been rejoicing in it. And then
[5:26:41] when I finish then I start reading the
[5:26:44] next part that start which shows that
[5:26:46] the disciple of John the Baptist went
[5:26:50] and when they saw that they went and
[5:26:51] report to John and John went sent them
[5:26:54] back two disciple said you ask him is he
[5:26:57] the one or should I wait for another one
[5:26:59] then I'm start think I'm like wow the
[5:27:02] Bible said Jesus had compassion for this
[5:27:04] woman that's why he raised her son but
[5:27:08] here is John the Baptist who was even
[5:27:10] the prophet, how would not God have
[5:27:13] compassion for him and living in prison
[5:27:16] and just send him with the word? No,
[5:27:18] they should see what happened and go
[5:27:20] report to him. So in other words, they
[5:27:22] would just bring a testimony which was
[5:27:24] the word of God many manifest in that
[5:27:26] time and taking back to John. So I've
[5:27:29] been pondering on that and just praying.
[5:27:31] I'm like, God, what is this? And then uh
[5:27:34] somehow I listened to one of the
[5:27:36] message. I don't remember exactly what
[5:27:38] that was, but it shows how Elijah was on
[5:27:43] Mount Caramel and all the great things
[5:27:45] he did. And then from there on just a
[5:27:48] little woman, Jezebel who was not even
[5:27:51] in the presence of God, the sinner, just
[5:27:53] a way that she said that she want
[5:27:55] Elijah's life. And this is a great man
[5:27:57] who was in the presence of God and just
[5:27:59] start running away from this little
[5:28:01] woman and then trying to see where to
[5:28:04] hide and end up in the juniper tree. So
[5:28:06] I've been pondering about that. God,
[5:28:08] what is happening exactly? Then I start
[5:28:10] putting that together with the camp. I'm
[5:28:12] like, we've been hiding. Now we're on
[5:28:14] the journey and we still have to go in
[5:28:16] the cave, which the Bible says uh Elijah
[5:28:19] went down in the cave and uh hide there.
[5:28:22] That's where the angel of the Lord came
[5:28:24] and met him and give him a bread for the
[5:28:26] rest of his journey. And I'm like, we
[5:28:29] need the bread of life now. We need
[5:28:31] Christ. We need the word after the
[5:28:33] experience that we had. Then Saturday,
[5:28:37] which was yesterday, I'm coming. I
[5:28:39] wanted to help the school. So I'm having
[5:28:41] this thought going through my mind. The
[5:28:44] ministry is not vindicated. How is that?
[5:28:47] So I go in the building. So the first
[5:28:49] thing, Brother Kim Dingle, I don't know
[5:28:51] if he's here, but he saw me and turn
[5:28:54] around say, "Oh, brother Edd's here.
[5:28:56] He's gonna help you." I'm like, "Oh
[5:28:58] man." So I got Brother Eddie start to
[5:29:01] help me and I kind of move fast and it's
[5:29:03] kind of slowing me down a little bit. So
[5:29:06] I'm trying
[5:29:09] trying to see how I could switch, but I
[5:29:12] heard something that I knew for sure
[5:29:15] this is a man of God. So I start and
[5:29:18] then brother Ed move went to do
[5:29:19] something I grab a big hammer start like
[5:29:22] smashing the concrete and I run to him
[5:29:24] like aren't you preaching tomorrow he's
[5:29:26] like yeah I am I'm like you shouldn't be
[5:29:28] here what you doing here it's a hard
[5:29:30] work you got to be going somebody else
[5:29:32] can do this but at the same time this is
[5:29:35] thought this thought still coming back
[5:29:37] in my mind the main street is not
[5:29:39] vindicated so I said god you gave me one
[5:29:42] sign and only one say I've been
[5:29:45] pondering by Elijah and I've been
[5:29:47] pondered by John the Baptist. So let's
[5:29:50] when today whoever will come and preach
[5:29:53] I want him to say and stay on the same
[5:29:55] thought that I've been pondering on. And
[5:29:57] then brother Ed came and say uh let's
[5:30:00] open Matthew. I'm like oh Matthew
[5:30:02] because I was in Luke. So he read about
[5:30:05] John the Baptist. I'm like oh wow. So he
[5:30:08] keep preaching keep preaching. Then when
[5:30:10] brother Ed is preaching I'm keep
[5:30:12] following him. I'm like right now he's
[5:30:14] gonna speak about Elijah and as soon as
[5:30:17] I finish those word he goes and Elijah
[5:30:20] and all my sister said oh my goodness.
[5:30:23] So it just became surreal to me after
[5:30:26] they called for the people to come at
[5:30:28] the altar. I couldn't help myself but I
[5:30:31] had a little note. I'm just going to
[5:30:32] share one with you uh so you don't make
[5:30:36] you think don't think I'm making this
[5:30:37] up.
[5:30:42] So, uh, when people were praying, I came
[5:30:45] up and show a little bit to brother Ed
[5:30:47] because I'm like, you know, the devil,
[5:30:50] you never know. I'll go talk to him
[5:30:52] after. Like, that kid just wrote that
[5:30:54] when I was writing when I was thinking
[5:30:56] about it. I get that quickly here.
[5:31:00] Uh, sorry. You
[5:31:02] &gt;&gt; want me to help you find it?
[5:31:05] &gt;&gt; It's okay. I have a note. Okay. Here. He
[5:31:08] brought this note up and read it to me
[5:31:09] this morning and and he's got in there
[5:31:11] that Monday is is the preacher's juniper
[5:31:14] tree.
[5:31:17] So I had it on my note. I said uh I was
[5:31:22] thinking about going to study on Mount
[5:31:23] Carmel Jet Tree and the cave. So, but on
[5:31:27] these few things that really stuck in my
[5:31:29] heart and I said every pastor after
[5:31:34] after having a good service Monday
[5:31:37] morning the devil will wait on him with
[5:31:40] the journey
[5:31:42] and I said there's many of us under the
[5:31:45] jourer tree wondering ourselves
[5:31:48] sometimes oh God
[5:31:51] &gt;&gt; who oh God I was writing fast I can't
[5:31:55] even read my own writing
[5:31:57] Oh God, what do you want me to do? God
[5:32:01] has to do something for every man that
[5:32:03] comes under the jourer tree or he will
[5:32:07] break in pieces. God knows your trials.
[5:32:11] He knows all about it. And after all,
[5:32:14] God came in a small voice. And uh this
[5:32:17] I'm talking about how God came to
[5:32:19] Elijah. And God came in a small voice
[5:32:22] and not in a big things. Big things are
[5:32:25] just a forerunners of God. God knows
[5:32:28] where you are. God sent an angel Elijah
[5:32:32] and gave him a bread, a bread of life.
[5:32:35] And this is the bread of life that we
[5:32:36] need.
[5:32:38] &gt;&gt; So once again, I want to say to you
[5:32:40] people, my email is real. And I believe
[5:32:43] it. God bless you.
[5:32:54] Um, I just believe God answered my
[5:32:57] prayer at camp and Thursday night,
[5:33:00] Friday night, Saturday morning, Saturday
[5:33:03] night, Sunday morning. It was all like
[5:33:06] really good. The testimonies at the
[5:33:08] snows and I just can't get enough of it.
[5:33:10] Amen.
[5:33:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[5:33:18] &gt;&gt; Uh
[5:33:21] I found my joy at camp or God gave me my
[5:33:23] joy back. That's what I had lost. Um but
[5:33:26] I really found that joy
[5:33:33] joy comes from like listening to the
[5:33:35] word, right?
[5:33:37] And it's amazing because for my entire
[5:33:40] life I've
[5:33:42] barely listened to the message. I came
[5:33:45] to church. But in the first I put a CD
[5:33:48] in my car, right? In the first 10
[5:33:50] minutes, I heard so many things that
[5:33:52] these brothers have preached their whole
[5:33:54] lives. But it's it was made to me
[5:33:57] because I people wonder sometimes, you
[5:34:00] know, what's the ministry saying? Is it
[5:34:02] really the word? and but it's really
[5:34:03] because they're not in the message and
[5:34:05] they haven't heard it and that's why
[5:34:06] they question the message that the
[5:34:08] ministry is preaching. Uh so it was a
[5:34:10] reality reality to me. Another thing is
[5:34:13] also uh at campus specific thing that
[5:34:18] brother Cadre sniffed out. Uh he was
[5:34:22] just preaching along right and we get
[5:34:25] those tithe statements right from the
[5:34:26] church and I realized I'd paid 5% for
[5:34:29] 2010. Uh, and it had been bothering me,
[5:34:32] right? Cuz I I thought I always paid my
[5:34:33] tithes, but I only paid five. So, he was
[5:34:36] just preaching and then he just brings
[5:34:37] up tithes so randomly. And then he said,
[5:34:41] "You're" He said, "You're cursed if you
[5:34:43] don't pay your tithe." And then he said,
[5:34:45] "Also, the the line that got me that was
[5:34:47] straight to me was he said, "You don't
[5:34:49] pay your tithe and you wonder why you
[5:34:50] have car problems every check."
[5:34:54] And that that was really right here cuz
[5:34:57] that happens.
[5:35:00] But that was just uh
[5:35:03] really that was the most personal I've
[5:35:05] ever had something speak to me. Uh and
[5:35:08] then brother uh Gary St. John, I just
[5:35:10] wanted to thank him. I don't think he's
[5:35:11] here today. He is here today. Okay. Um
[5:35:15] on Saturday night, I didn't pray with
[5:35:18] many people. I prayed with two people.
[5:35:20] And um the second one was brother Gary.
[5:35:24] And I just went over there and put my
[5:35:26] arm around him and prayed. and he had
[5:35:28] had me on his heart, he was saying, and
[5:35:29] how he told the Lord to just send me to
[5:35:33] him and and that's what happened. I just
[5:35:35] went and we prayed together and that was
[5:35:37] it that was great. So,
[5:35:40] [Music]
[5:35:47] &gt;&gt; first of all, I just want to thank the
[5:35:49] Lord for all he did in our family this
[5:35:51] um year.
[5:35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:35:53] &gt;&gt; This past camp, it was just amazing. and
[5:35:56] all my prayers he just answered and I'm
[5:35:59] just thankful for that. But um I went
[5:36:01] into camp with two specific things on my
[5:36:04] heart. Like I had many different things.
[5:36:05] But I came to the prayer meetings before
[5:36:08] both the prayer meetings and I prayed um
[5:36:10] I wanted my joy back because yeah I
[5:36:13] didn't have it. I lost it like this last
[5:36:15] year.
[5:36:17] And then um also for my temper cuz I had
[5:36:20] a temper and I don't know I work as a
[5:36:24] cashier it and the people always seem to
[5:36:27] just pull it out of me. So I just pray
[5:36:30] for that cuz I I know that people watch
[5:36:33] you in the world and in your work and I
[5:36:35] didn't want to be a bad um example to
[5:36:38] them. So then when I came to the
[5:36:40] services, Brother Kyre spoke um every
[5:36:44] service he seemed to hit on getting your
[5:36:46] joy back. And I was like, "That's mine
[5:36:48] because I've been praying for this." And
[5:36:51] um he said um you can get it back
[5:36:55] because you once had it so you can
[5:36:57] search for it. And I just I claimed
[5:36:59] that. And then and I did get my joy
[5:37:01] back. I'm very happy.
[5:37:04] &gt;&gt; And then another quick thing about my
[5:37:06] temper. So then I went to work and I was
[5:37:07] praying about it. And I was like, did it
[5:37:09] really happen or did I just think it
[5:37:11] happened? And
[5:37:14] um my boss was giving me this evaluation
[5:37:16] of the year to see how good I did. And
[5:37:19] then when we were in there and um just
[5:37:21] this last week, like right after camp
[5:37:23] and then we're sitting in the in the
[5:37:26] office and he's like, "Well, um customer
[5:37:28] service or whatever came up." I was
[5:37:30] like, "Oh, no." But and he was like,
[5:37:32] "Well, you just have to I think some
[5:37:34] something that you have to work on." And
[5:37:36] he's like, "Is your when you get mad,"
[5:37:38] he's like, "You frown or whatever for
[5:37:39] the whole day." And so I was like,
[5:37:41] "Yeah, well, I tried to tell him that it
[5:37:43] wasn't going to be like that anymore."
[5:37:45] And then but he just kept talking. I was
[5:37:46] like, "Okay." So I just sat there and
[5:37:48] then he he paused. And then a little
[5:37:50] while later he was like, "Um,
[5:37:53] but since you've come back," he's like,
[5:37:55] "I've noticed a huge change in you." And
[5:37:57] I was like, "Oh." And then I was like,
[5:38:00] "Yeah, well I I just wanted to tell him
[5:38:02] more." And then he was like just sitting
[5:38:04] there shaking his head. Yes. And then um
[5:38:06] he's like, "You don't think we watch
[5:38:08] you." He's like, "But I watch you and
[5:38:10] I've noticed a change in you." So I just
[5:38:12] wanted to give the Lord all the glory
[5:38:13] for everything he's done for me and my
[5:38:15] family.
[5:38:22] I'm awful without notes, but
[5:38:26] So
[5:38:27] this week has been
[5:38:30] uh interesting. I've been really sick,
[5:38:33] but I figured that all of us, lots of
[5:38:36] people have been getting sick. It's an
[5:38:37] epidemic of sickness, but it's an epide
[5:38:40] epidemic of victories also because
[5:38:44] we all got obviously something very
[5:38:46] special and he wants to take that all
[5:38:48] away right away after camp. You know,
[5:38:50] everyone just gets sick. But um so last
[5:38:54] night I I've been feeling really sick
[5:38:57] and I before bed, you know, I'm just
[5:39:00] like I'm sick of this. And so it was the
[5:39:03] first time I've got actually felt the
[5:39:06] presence in my room. And so I got down
[5:39:08] on the floor and just laid there and I'm
[5:39:10] like I need this to be taken away. But
[5:39:13] so I went to bed and then I woke up and
[5:39:16] I figured well I'd had a really really
[5:39:19] bad dream. And so I woke up and I was
[5:39:22] sweating and my blankets were everywhere
[5:39:24] and I was just I figured it was because
[5:39:27] I had gotten down and prayed for that
[5:39:28] long. And and so also at camp, mom
[5:39:34] before we left, she had told dad that
[5:39:37] she he better get ready cuz Nathan was
[5:39:40] going to come back with the Holy Ghost
[5:39:41] and he was like, "Wow."
[5:39:44] So,
[5:39:46] um I never thought of my brother that he
[5:39:49] could ever have the Holy Ghost cuz he
[5:39:51] was
[5:39:53] he wanted to beat everybody up and I was
[5:39:56] the little runt of the family and he
[5:39:57] just beat me up. But so I I never
[5:40:01] figured, you know, what he would be like
[5:40:02] if he had the Holy Ghost. So I never
[5:40:05] even thought to pray for him or anything
[5:40:07] like that. But so we get to camp and
[5:40:09] then he texted mom on Saturday night
[5:40:12] late late and he said that he got filled
[5:40:15] up and drunk and
[5:40:19] so it was crazy. And this week he's been
[5:40:21] different and he's been actually praying
[5:40:24] with meaning instead of repeating his
[5:40:26] prayer the same every night.
[5:40:29] And um
[5:40:32] I think that's all but I'm really really
[5:40:34] happy and everything and yeah, thank
[5:40:37] you.
[5:40:45] &gt;&gt; Um well, Brianna stole everything I was
[5:40:48] going to say, but um well before camp, I
[5:40:52] go into camp and I'm thinking, who am I
[5:40:55] going to hit? Who am I going to hit?
[5:40:57] boxing, pillow fight, anything. So, I
[5:41:00] get to the camp and I'm wondering who
[5:41:02] I'm going to who's on my hit list. So, I
[5:41:06] go up to my cabin and who's there for me
[5:41:08] to unleash upon. So, I get there and
[5:41:13] okay, there's not really anybody fun to
[5:41:16] hit there. And so, I was kind of in a I
[5:41:19] was kind of grumpy the whole camp or
[5:41:23] first part of camp. In the first
[5:41:25] service, I didn't really understand what
[5:41:27] was going on. I didn't really pay
[5:41:28] attention. And the next night, Friday
[5:41:31] night, um it was that was it kind of hit
[5:41:36] home. So, I just went up to the front
[5:41:41] and then that was a night where I got
[5:41:44] filled. And then the next night was kind
[5:41:47] of a confirmation for that. And then so
[5:41:51] it was the rest of camp it was really um
[5:41:56] kind of
[5:41:58] um yeah the whole the rest of the
[5:42:00] sermons are really confirming that and
[5:42:03] doing that. And then Sunday my mom
[5:42:05] during the prayer came over and told me
[5:42:08] to come up and pray with brother Diggs.
[5:42:11] I'm like oh no I don't want to really
[5:42:13] want to go up to the front in front of
[5:42:14] everyone. And so my mom drags me up
[5:42:18] there and so we pray and then that was
[5:42:20] the real and grand slam of convers or
[5:42:26] confirmation. And so um
[5:42:30] the ever since then at night I kind of
[5:42:34] read my Bible and prayed and listened to
[5:42:37] part of a sermon and I had never read a
[5:42:39] bi my Bible or prayed or listened to any
[5:42:44] sermon on my own. Never. So it was it's
[5:42:48] been a real change since then. And yeah,
[5:42:52] camp was really good.
[5:42:54] [Music]
[5:43:01] Um
[5:43:03] uh my camp experience really started
[5:43:06] before camp um during the prayer
[5:43:08] meetings and the first one was really
[5:43:11] good cuz like everybody was praying but
[5:43:13] the second one it was like the Holy
[5:43:15] Spirit come down and like everybody was
[5:43:18] praying like everybody was worshiping
[5:43:21] and if it was it was like the one of the
[5:43:23] hardest times I've ever prayed.
[5:43:25] And this camp wasn't really especially
[5:43:28] for me. I was mostly praying for like
[5:43:30] other people like my brother and like
[5:43:32] all those other guys his age.
[5:43:34] And then um Thursday night the th Yeah.
[5:43:38] Thursday night um when he was talking
[5:43:40] about love of God. It was really um
[5:43:43] something that I was wondering about
[5:43:44] like how deep did God's love go? And
[5:43:47] then Friday night was when I went up for
[5:43:50] prayer. And then brother Diggs came up
[5:43:52] to pray for me and he said, um, Lord,
[5:43:55] fill her up with the Holy Ghost so much
[5:43:56] that she can't contain it. And that's
[5:43:58] when I like totally gave my life to God.
[5:44:01] And then, um, uh, Saturday night that
[5:44:05] that was more of like just pray for
[5:44:07] everybody else. And just to see like God
[5:44:10] just like confirm like himself like in
[5:44:12] everybody like in Ellie and then like
[5:44:15] Matthew and Josh who I've been praying
[5:44:17] for for like a long time. And then um it
[5:44:22] was really amazing just to see the way
[5:44:23] like God can just come down and totally
[5:44:24] take over a service cuz I I was
[5:44:26] listening I was listening to Saturday
[5:44:28] evening um a couple days ago and brother
[5:44:31] Digs said um something like uh I wonder
[5:44:35] if God can just come down and just make
[5:44:37] this preacher stop preaching and just
[5:44:40] like God can totally change the service.
[5:44:41] And then and then I was like wow like
[5:44:44] like a few minutes later that actually
[5:44:46] happened and it was really amazing to
[5:44:48] see that in like in just a service and
[5:44:51] it was really changed for me like that
[5:44:53] kind of experience.
[5:44:55] Yeah. God bless you.
[5:44:57] [Applause]
[5:45:06] &gt;&gt; Um, I want to thank Sister Darlene and
[5:45:08] my mom Christy for our for being our
[5:45:10] counselors. And sister Darlene shared
[5:45:12] the scripture with us. It was Jude
[5:45:14] 24:25.
[5:45:16] Now unto him that is able to keep you
[5:45:18] from falling and to present you
[5:45:20] faultless before the presence of his
[5:45:22] glory with exceeding joy. to the only
[5:45:25] wise God, our savior. Be glory and
[5:45:26] majesty, dominion, power, both now and
[5:45:28] ever. Amen.
[5:45:30] &gt;&gt; And
[5:45:32] um there's Sterling got us these
[5:45:34] notebooks and she told us to write down
[5:45:36] three things that we expected out of
[5:45:38] camp. And so I wrote down a few and I
[5:45:41] believe all of those expectations were
[5:45:42] met. And it spoke to me in the service
[5:45:45] when um Brother Diggs, he was talking
[5:45:48] about don't be ashamed to say you have
[5:45:50] the Holy Ghost. And so after that
[5:45:52] service um I was talking with Victoria
[5:45:57] and then so I told her and then she told
[5:45:59] me that she had it too and I was just
[5:46:01] really happy and I felt freer and also
[5:46:04] um it spoke to me when brother Diggs
[5:46:07] said that don't wait for someone else to
[5:46:10] start the way of the Holy Spirit. You
[5:46:11] start it and I'd like been like
[5:46:14] struggling with that before he said
[5:46:16] that. And so and yeah, just thank you
[5:46:20] for all those who made camp possible.
[5:46:22] And
[5:46:26] [Music]
[5:46:31] &gt;&gt; hey, Phil,
[5:46:37] &gt;&gt; uh first of all, just like to say a big
[5:46:39] thank you uh to those brothers and
[5:46:41] sisters uh involved in the streaming.
[5:46:44] Yeah,
[5:46:44] &gt;&gt; I've never been so thankful for
[5:46:46] streaming ever.
[5:46:48] &gt;&gt; Um to to know that that was going on
[5:46:51] just a little ways from where we are and
[5:46:54] it was current at that moment. Um, I
[5:46:56] borrowed a projector from school and we
[5:46:58] had it on our our wall and uh, we were
[5:47:01] there worshiping with with you all and
[5:47:04] it was just uh, it was an amazing
[5:47:05] experience especially that Saturday
[5:47:07] night when things just kind of let loose
[5:47:10] &gt;&gt; and um, I I nudged Katie cuz she was
[5:47:13] just worshiping. And I said, "Look," you
[5:47:15] know, cuz I had been watching the
[5:47:17] monitor and I'd seen, you know,
[5:47:18] Matthew's arm like this and that, you
[5:47:20] know, the video just zoomed right into
[5:47:22] it and it was just like this and he was
[5:47:25] struggling as as you were praying for
[5:47:27] him and and um and then I looked again
[5:47:30] and uh and there he was with his hands
[5:47:32] up and worshiping and I nudged Katie and
[5:47:35] I said, "Look, that's Matthew. That's
[5:47:37] Ellie, you know, doing this and that's
[5:47:39] that's, you know, Josh." and just
[5:47:41] pointing out the different ones. And
[5:47:42] that meant so much to me. Um I see the
[5:47:46] you know I get to teach some of these
[5:47:48] guys and um to see them like that uh
[5:47:52] that just meant so much to me. So much
[5:47:54] to me and knowing that the next day or
[5:47:57] two days I guess on the Saturday night
[5:47:59] on Monday I'd get to come to school and
[5:48:01] see the change. And um there was a
[5:48:05] change. And honestly, I mean, I took one
[5:48:08] look at Matthew and there wasn't like
[5:48:11] the the cloud or this mask. It was just
[5:48:14] it was the old Matthew. I remember the
[5:48:16] old Matthew. And so, and I saw that
[5:48:18] right away. And I look into Ellie's eyes
[5:48:20] and it's the same just like a like it's
[5:48:23] gone, you know? And it's it's amazing.
[5:48:25] And in I teach 8, nine, and 10 mostly.
[5:48:29] And um in those grades, camp's been
[5:48:32] they've been talking about camp all
[5:48:33] week. You know, it's been keep on coming
[5:48:35] up. I remember talking to to Nathan in
[5:48:37] the classroom and even when the
[5:48:39] conversation kind of went, you know,
[5:48:41] towards the snowboarding trip or
[5:48:42] something like that, it somehow come
[5:48:44] back to the camp services and it it's
[5:48:46] just been a theme and it's uh you know,
[5:48:49] we're praying that it'll continue.
[5:48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:48:55] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[5:48:56] Hallelujah.
[5:49:00] Go ahead.
[5:49:01] &gt;&gt; That's 12.
[5:49:03] &gt;&gt; 12 for the 12 disciples.
[5:49:08] &gt;&gt; Well, camp experience has just carried
[5:49:11] on.
[5:49:11] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[5:49:12] &gt;&gt; It's been wonderful.
[5:49:14] &gt;&gt; And the prayer meeting, Monday night,
[5:49:17] Saturday night was wonderful, but we
[5:49:19] can't let it stay at Saturday night,
[5:49:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[5:49:21] &gt;&gt; We need to carry on,
[5:49:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[5:49:23] &gt;&gt; We're driving home. I was driving home
[5:49:25] with Aaron Hardy, John Kerr, Tim
[5:49:28] Girtson, and brother David Dertie.
[5:49:32] And
[5:49:34] we dropped Tim off at his house cuz he
[5:49:36] had homework. And then we dropped David
[5:49:38] off at his house. But we we would pray
[5:49:41] with each one as they left.
[5:49:45] And
[5:49:47] when we ca when we stopped at my house,
[5:49:50] it was just beautiful. God came down in
[5:49:53] so such a special way. Came down the
[5:49:56] same power he became Saturday night.
[5:50:00] &gt;&gt; It's just
[5:50:01] &gt;&gt; beautiful to remain in his presence.
[5:50:05] &gt;&gt; And then also Friday night and prayer
[5:50:08] meeting
[5:50:10] same power.
[5:50:12] &gt;&gt; Glory.

[5:50:31] children's children. Amen. Just give me
[5:50:34] your hand. Let's agree together as we

[5:53:18] we keep maring on earth
[5:53:22] by every
[5:53:26] God's on our side.
[5:53:30] We want the power

[5:53:59] in the name of the Lord.
[5:54:08] Glory.
[5:54:12] [Music]
[5:54:15] I have to say just two things. Keep it
[5:54:17] down to two things. Number one, when
[5:54:20] Brother Tim becomes a teacher at that
[5:54:22] school, I want to be in his classroom.
[5:54:26] I mean it. I'm reenrolling.
[5:54:31] I said anybody that has Brother Tim for
[5:54:33] a teacher,
[5:54:35] that'll be a great day.
[5:54:37] &gt;&gt; Another thing, I appreciate Brother John
[5:54:40] Andes.
[5:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:54:52] Hallelujah.
[5:54:56] Hallelujah.
[5:54:58] [Music]
[5:55:04] Amen.
[5:55:07] The Lord must love us very much.
[5:55:11] Amen. We appreciate you, brother John.
[5:55:14] I have not worked with somebody that's
[5:55:16] so willing
[5:55:18] &gt;&gt; every day
[5:55:19] &gt;&gt; at any time.
[5:55:21] &gt;&gt; He just doesn't say it. He lives it.
[5:55:24] &gt;&gt; And I feel a privilege to be able to
[5:55:27] labor with such a soldier at the cross.
[5:55:30] &gt;&gt; And he's a love gift to us.
[5:55:33] &gt;&gt; And you know, I I wouldn't want to be
[5:55:35] saying that at a funeral. I'll say that
[5:55:36] anytime. I'll give a man a bouquet
[5:55:39] anytime. I appreciate him and I
[5:55:41] appreciate his family
[5:55:43] &gt;&gt; and I appreciate the work of grace
[5:55:45] within his life. Brother John, would you
[5:55:47] come and close us in a word of prayer?
[5:55:52] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, the grapes from the
[5:55:55] promised land are good, Lord.
[5:55:57] So appreciate, Lord, that Joshua and
[5:56:00] Caleb spirit that's among us, Lord, that
[5:56:03] we're able to inherit our land with our
[5:56:05] children and our loved ones and the
[5:56:07] older ones, Lord, waving that banner of
[5:56:10] victory and the testimony of Jesus
[5:56:13] Christ still lives on. Lord, we're just
[5:56:15] so happy, God. We've been reveling in
[5:56:18] the glory of God among us. Just seems
[5:56:21] like whenever it comes up, Lord, we
[5:56:23] can't say enough. Just a few words and
[5:56:26] that presence comes near. Lord, would
[5:56:29] you come into our homes, God? Come into
[5:56:32] our lives in a greater way. Just
[5:56:34] continue this work, God. Let let the
[5:56:38] quality of your spirit be increased in
[5:56:40] our families, in our lives individually,
[5:56:43] and in our marriages, for our children,
[5:56:46] in our assembly. It's just so wonderful
[5:56:49] to see the glory of God all around us
[5:56:52] and hearing your word, God. and it's
[5:56:54] nothing but the truth. And to see the
[5:56:57] prophecy for this day coming to pass.
[5:57:00] Lord, it's so wonderful. We just feel
[5:57:02] like the next step could be into our new
[5:57:04] bodies, into that other dimension where
[5:57:06] we'll never, never, never end around
[5:57:10] your throne and be dancing and shouting
[5:57:12] and giving testimonies.
[5:57:15] God, truly, this is the presence of
[5:57:17] Jesus Christ. Lord, we pray healing for
[5:57:20] every life. It is true. Satan has tried
[5:57:23] to come in and afflict Lord uh one
[5:57:26] another, but we're just holding the
[5:57:27] banner of the word. Nothing can steal
[5:57:30] away what you've done for us. We'll keep
[5:57:33] confessing it. We'll keep uh putting it
[5:57:35] back into Satan's mind. He's going down
[5:57:38] and we're going up. We're going up in
[5:57:42] the first resurrection and the rapture
[5:57:44] call one morning and the change of our
[5:57:47] bodies. It'll be a wonderful day, God.
[5:57:50] This is just a foretaste, just a down
[5:57:53] payment, God. And if and if this is
[5:57:55] that, Lord, what's a new body going to
[5:57:58] be like? We'll be shouting for thousands
[5:58:00] and millions of years of your glory,
[5:58:02] God. Lord, if there's anything today at
[5:58:05] the end of this day, in the closing
[5:58:08] moments of this day, as the family is
[5:58:11] about ready to part, Lord, that we'd
[5:58:14] like to see you working in individual
[5:58:16] lives and hearts. May it continue,
[5:58:19] Jesus.
[5:58:20] continue your work, God, and don't let
[5:58:22] up, Father. Continue your love and your
[5:58:25] mercy, Jesus. We appreciate the men of
[5:58:28] God that's labored for us, Lord, and the
[5:58:30] sisters and those among us behind the
[5:58:33] scenes. We just so appreciate the body
[5:58:35] of Christ. May you go with them tonight
[5:58:38] and encourage every life along this
[5:58:40] pilgrim journey that it's not over yet,
[5:58:43] Lord. There's still battles to be won
[5:58:45] and victories. Amen.
[5:58:47] &gt;&gt; May you go with us now, Lord, and bring
[5:58:49] precious fruit and sheaves, Lord. And
[5:58:51] those on the internet, Lord, we never
[5:58:53] forget them, Lord. May the same Holy
[5:58:56] Ghost anointing that's been among us go
[5:58:59] out across the waves and cross the
[5:59:01] miles, God, and visit individual
[5:59:03] churches and families and lives. And let
[5:59:06] them also wave, Lord, a banner of
[5:59:09] victory, victory, victory. For we're
[5:59:12] part of a body of Jesus Christ. Go with
[5:59:15] us now, God. We love your appearing. Go
[5:59:18] with us now. And your grace is upon us.
[5:59:20] In the name of Jesus Christ, we thank
[5:59:23] you, Lord.
[5:59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:59:28] [Music]
[5:59:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Greet one another. You're
[5:59:33] dismissed. Amen. God be with you this
[5:59:36] week.
[5:59:38] [Music]
[5:59:42] &gt;&gt; Sure. One last thing.
[5:59:46] Forgive me. I said two. We have three.
[5:59:50] Uh I wonder can you put that up on the
[5:59:53] screen?
[5:59:55] The brothers, brother Biscll
[5:59:58] requested
[6:00:00] and I and it's just a burden. Do you see
[6:00:04] what God is doing and put it before the
[6:00:06] people? Missions
[6:00:08] &gt;&gt; outreach
[6:00:10] &gt;&gt; and brother Michael, brother John, and a
[6:00:12] group of young men and young ladies have
[6:00:14] got together to write up testimonies.
[6:00:17] We've got them broken down in countries
[6:00:19] and uh local uh ministry, local
[6:00:22] assembly, different ones. They'll have
[6:00:24] their testimony from camp. You don't
[6:00:25] want to miss that page. And and then if
[6:00:28] you want to support, there's a place
[6:00:30] where you can support to see this
[6:00:32] message go out. It's a great um page
[6:00:36] that the brothers have put together.
[6:00:37] Brother Michael put a lot of work
[6:00:38] together. Aaron, they've all done a
[6:00:40] great job. It's been a body ministry and
[6:00:43] it they've all come together to put this
[6:00:45] up. I'll rush home and we'll all put it
[6:00:48] on and look at it. There's some
[6:00:50] wonderful articles and you can't keep up
[6:00:52] with it.
[6:00:52] &gt;&gt; Right. Brother Murphy was having a China
[6:00:54] report and I said, "Brother Murphy, what
[6:00:56] about those ones that Brother Ivan was
[6:00:58] talking about?" He says, "It's already
[6:00:59] gone on from that."
[6:01:01] &gt;&gt; So, you'll want to go read that every
[6:01:03] day and see what God is doing. He's
[6:01:05] doing great things.
[6:01:06] &gt;&gt; We thank God for the different ones in
[6:01:08] the body that can put this up to get
[6:01:10] this message out and around the world.
[6:01:13] God bless you.
[6:01:15] &gt;&gt; God be with you.
[6:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:01:20] Hallelujah.
