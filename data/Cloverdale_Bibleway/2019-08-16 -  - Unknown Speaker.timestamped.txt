[0:07] did at youth temp when a man stands over
[0:10] his own daughter and trying to call out
[0:12] a demon and the demon speaks out but you
[0:17] have no power because you know about the
[0:20] television in your house and he could
[0:28] make it shut up and bind it from
[0:30] speaking but he couldn't make it come
[0:33] out then we had to send him out of the
[0:37] room did you hear me we had to send him
[0:43] out of the room and deal with it and it
[0:48] came out a demon that was trying to
[0:51] destroy this girl's life with suicide

[1:50] getting rid of that thing I'll beat it
[1:51] in a million pieces I get a picture back
[1:55] from him the next day of it beating
