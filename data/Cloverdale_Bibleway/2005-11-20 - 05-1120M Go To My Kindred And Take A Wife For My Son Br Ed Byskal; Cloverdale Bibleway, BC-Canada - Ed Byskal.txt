There's a testimony from our sister Debbie Gier. Friday before camp, she was experiencing some chest pain. And uh following Sunday in service, Brother Bisll said, "Brother Mike and Sister Debbie, it's not just a miracle in the mating. The miracle uh has already happened." I just tucked this into my heart. I couldn't help but believe that God was confirming to me that all was well. Over the next few months, I went through a series of tests, one of which indicated a possible blood flow restriction, and she got her tests on Thursday confirming no blockage. Amen. We're thankful for that. want to remember this morning in prayer uh brother Mike Hunt has uh been speaking to a man uh Bob Bodner Bonder Bob Bonder up in uh Edmonton I believe Jewish fellow and uh he's at this moment reading leadership we just want to pray for his soul sister Irastein is requesting prayer for Micah uh Schumé 2 and 1/2year-old suffering from seizure His parents are denominational Christians. Sister Lynn Douly um was talking to Sister Marie Masterson from Chattam, Ontario's requested prayer for her daughter Julie who was in a car accident 4 months ago is paralyzed. All she can do is move her hand open and closed for yes or no. And uh I just want to remember her and pray that God would just touch her and heal her. Brother Chris is requesting prayer for Donna Smith who needs total deliverance from drugs and her addiction has separated her from her children. Want to remember her this morning. Brother Gary St. John is requesting prayer for his mom. Sister Linda St. John needs healing in her body. Amen. How many have a need? They want to be remembered this morning as we go to prayer. Amen. I know we got many needs. Brother Tony, &gt;&gt; let's remember in prayer, Brother Ernie who's ministering down, and brother Samuel Dales, Brother Luis Escaro down in Chile, Argentina, and our precious brother Murphy who'll be making his way home today. Heavenly Father, how wonderful it is to be able to come into your presence this morning to lift you up, to place you in the highest place, Lord, as king of our lives, as our King Theophony, as our great bridegroom. Lord, we come humbly to you as your bride and yet knowing the confidence of our position, Father. For Lord, we see ourselves as a queen. We see ourselves as Mrs. Jesus Christ. This morning we see ourselves as Esther as she went and made her presence and her entrance into your great presence, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. And Lord, we know that there was a scepter that was stretched forth to Esther, Lord, to ask and give her the the permission to ask all that was in her heart to do. And here we are as your bride this morning. Lord, we love you. We want you to be pleased with our lives, with our worship, Lord, with the testimony of our lips. We give you honor. We we give you a praise offering of thanksgiving this morning for the great and mighty things that you have done. How we rejoice with our sister Debbie, Lord, delivered, Father. Oh God, what doctors might have said was a problem. You, the divine physician, moved on the scene and delivered our sister. How we thank you for that, Lord. And we know there's many other testimonies here. How that you've been moving and stirring in hearts, Lord. Oh, we have such great confidence when we hear these reports to know that as we bring these petitions before you that Lord Jesus, if we ask it and if we claim it in that name that is above every other name that it shall be done. Hallelujah. That's our promise. We have expectation. We don't doubt as we ask now Lord as we bring these requests humbly before you Lord Jesus a mother Father oh God brother Gary St. John, if it was our mother that was in need of a healing, Lord, how we could enter into our brother's burden and certainly as a member of the body of Christ, Lord, we hold up our dear brother's mother, Sister Linda, in prayer this morning that you would move on her ha behalf, Father, and grant her the healing that she needs, Lord. Father, for these other requests as well, Lord, for this one that Sister Iris wrote in of this of this child, Lord, that's suffering with seizures. Lord Jesus, even though the parents may not be walking in the fullness of your word, Lord Jesus, that's irre doesn't matter, Lord, but Lord, we are praying and we're asking because our sister Iris has had a contact with this family. May you prove yourself the same yesterday, today, and forever to this once, Lord. And father, for another need, our dear sister, Lord Jesus, prayer for her daughter who was who was seriously injured in a car accident. Oh God, of such a young child, Lord, paralyze, oh father, if it was our young child, oh God, how we would want you to move on the scene. How we would want you to restore cells and bones and nerve endings, Lord. Oh Lord Jesus, we enter into our sister's burden. Lord, may your presence envelop that innocent child, Lord. May you just sweep over her, oh God. We've seen necks that were broken, healed. Hallelujah. We've seen children with seizures healed before, Lord Jesus. Oh God, one more time, we we hold up this child before you, Lord, of your glory, Lord, may be shown in this situation, and we pray that you would just move on the scene, Lord, and straighten out the bones in this child's body, Father. Oh Lord God, we're here to be witnesses. We're not just merely the bride of Christ, but we're we're Jesus Christ on display. Lord, we may be the only representation of your word that some will ever see. And how our brother Chris has been going out with others and testifying of your of your power, Lord, meeting these ones and speaking your word, a word of life. And there's a a woman, Lord, that's in that's in prison, in bondage to drugs and demon spirits. Father, oh Lord, we we project faith to this woman today, Lord, that this power of drug addiction, Lord, this demon that has possessed her mind and her body, that the power of God would break that demon spell. Hallelujah. Oh, we bind those devils that truth could and prevail in this situation and release our sister, Father. Release her by faith, Lord, as a sister in Christ that you have led our brothers to. And for our brother Mike, Lord, as he's been witnessing to a man that of the Jewish lineage, Lord, Father, maybe you'll open his eyes to see that the Messiah's already come. Maybe, Lord, he's one of those that must go back to Israel again to be able to see you as you reveal yourself to the children of Joseph, Lord. God, we pray for wisdom for brother Mike. That you would just bless him and open this man's eyes according to your perfect will. And Lord, for those that are out ministering, our brother Ernie, bless him, Father, anoint him in the service that he's in even now. Our brother Luis, Lord, as he's translating and providing the the messages and Lord, some of the ministry in Spanish down for brother Hugo in Chile and Argentina, bless him and Luis, Lord, bless brother Steven Kemper as he's down in Brazil. Father, oh Lord, make him a blessing to the saints there as well. And Father, for our precious brother Murphy, how we've missed him, Lord. Oh God, I know his family misses him too. And tomorrow he'll be coming home. And perhaps even now making preparation for his long journey. Be with him. Be with the believers that are in China, his family that have not yet fully received you. Anoint them with faith. We pray. And Lord, especially for our pastor, how we love the man of God. How we love your gift within him. How we've been so blessed, Lord. Oh, we just want to have Lord anticipation Lord. Oh God, help us to be on the edge of our seat, Lord. Let us not be tired. Let us not, Lord, weary. Let our thoughts be focused on what you have to say this morning, Lord. We need this refreshing. We need this anointing. And Lord, we want to pull on the gift this morning. Bless our dear pastor. Give him strength, Lord. Give Brother Ed an anointing that just Lord, he would be able to be free to say what you would have him to say. Lord, we don't look at the vessel. We look at God in the vessel. Hallelujah. And Lord, for everyone that's in the extended audience, those out on internet and telephone, part of the family of God, bless us all with your spirit and presence this morning as we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ.

Oh, I know the road is narrow. The road is narrow, but I'll still run for my justice. One day I decide when I get to that place. I'll keep on resting until I get to that place. &gt;&gt; Till I get to that place to the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus. In Christ Jesus, we will stand. For the road is narrow, but I will still run for my prize. just to say one day I decide when I get to that place. The road is narrow. But I will still run for my pride. Just to sit. Just to sit. One day I decide. When I get to that place, I'll keep on pressing. Oh, I'll keep on pressing till I get to that place. I'll keep on pressing till I get to that place. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Man, we're in a fight. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name, we press on. Let's sing it together. We're going to be turning to the word at this time as brother Biscll comes. Let's just pray that God would speak to each one here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you want him to speak to your soul? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're hungry and thirsting and you'll be filled this morning in Jesus name we press on.

We're indeed happy to greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Wonderful to have the freedom and the liberty to be here gathered together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We also this evening we're having uh our brother Anatoli from Usbekiststan is going to come and speak this evening and our brother Peter uh is going to be in interpreting for him. Where's our brother uh Anatoli is where is he seated here? Uh let's welcome him brother Anatoli. Amen. I uh have only had a brief evening with our brother Anatoli. The last time I was not here when he was speaking and then he was in Tacoma so I went down to Tacoma and spent an evening with him. Uh and we had a real blessed time. uh he has a real fine church in that country of Usbekiststan and um I think the only church in the message there about 250 people I understand and most of those people all came in from hearing one tape just one tape false anointed ones at the end time that I mean that has special special depth for me because it was the on tape. Brother Brandham asked me if I heard. Of course, I couldn't have heard it because he hadn't spoke it yet, but there was a purpose in that also. Amen. &gt;&gt; This last Friday, we had a memorial service for our sister, Sister Marge Miller, and uh I think brother Glenn Grunard wanted to just make a comment uh on behalf of the family. Brother Glenn, would you please? And tonight, while Brother Glenn is coming, tonight we're having a baptismal service again. &gt;&gt; Uh, it looks like there's another three that are going to be baptized. That, you know what? That's going to be 50. &gt;&gt; Maybe that'll be Jubilee Night. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't that amazing? It's just wonderful. Come, Brother Glenn. God bless you. Put this up here. All right. God bless you, brother. I wanted to come up here personally. I didn't believe it was enough to just put a note in because of uh on behalf of all the family, we'd like to thank each and every one of you for being with us through this. um all the kind words, the prayers, the food, the babysitting for my children, having them over when we weren't able to be at home. Um and I know mom was very pleased also that so many people were here for us and for her. Um I'd like to uh thank brother Ed and Sister Ruth for being there. anytime we had a question, we needed to contact them, they were available 24 hours a day for us and we're a blessed people &gt;&gt; and the rest of the ministry also I know we're there for mom. I thank you very much. I can't mention everybody basically have to mention everybody in this church for all the help they've been to us. I'd like to make one comment. Brother Joe at the service on Friday, Joe Wner came out to me and he said, you know, this doesn't even seem like a funeral service. He said, "This feels like a wedding." He said, "There's such joy and such peace." And I said, you know, it's a celebration of life, the life that my mom lived before everybody because it was the life of Jesus Christ. I thank you everyone. Hopefully we can return all the goodness you've bestowed upon us and basically uh on behalf of all the family uh grandchildren everyone we thank you very much for what you've done for us your goodness and your love and I know one person will never forget that and that's our Lord Jesus Christ you'll be blessed for it thank you very much brother Glenn and to the sisters I I know that they've already been thanked by the family, but um sisters of the congregation, I tell you, you I don't just say this to be flattering, but you're something else. I went into the uh into the fellowship room and saw four tables laden with uh food and refreshments and went into the kitchen and found as much in the kitchen as there was out in the fellowship room. I said, "Who are you planning to feed?" It was just an enormous amount. And I think they were able to send back with the families and that was nice. and and I thought they had enough probably to feed the entire young people's meeting that same night, Friday night. Well, the Lord is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Tomorrow, Brother Murphy comes back from China, extended trip. And I can tell you that uh I know some little ones and a wife that's going to be very happy. Our sister Tracy and her parents, but especially Sister Tracy and the children. And God reward you for sacrificing the time with your husband for this I think two plus months isn't it brother Tony over two months and I can assure you one evening would not cover uh what has been happening in China it's just amazing absolutely amazing and uh soon as he gets back we'll be able to uh hear some of these things also been receiving some emails from Steven Keer in Brazil and uh he traveled to uh into the uh I would say interior uh into the village country he said where they were so very very poor materially but rich in faith &gt;&gt; rich in the word and that's lovely amen and even though we are here and you sit in nice seats and I hope it's comfortable for you and that you can hear the service and worship and all the rest of it, but you can still be rich in faith. &gt;&gt; Don't let these material things affect you in any way. It just happens to be our environment. But God never did say that if we got in this state in the end time, they're going to be he said, "Will he will the son of man find faith the faith on the earth?" because there's not going to be much of it and there isn't much of it but there is some &gt;&gt; and not only that it's an increased it's an increased portion because it's a bride portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart and so we want to be remembering brother Murphy as he travels back and brother Steven while he's still away and I'm sure that they uh brother Roger and sister Gail are anxious to see have their son come back as well. But um it's amazing this email, you know, uh it just happens in seconds. I never was a very good letter writer, but when I can get it in just a few moments and I look at it and I say, you know what, I can actually have that answer back in a few moments, I'm I'm very tempted then and I try to get it right back. And uh I received one from South Africa uh yesterday and or day before and just sent a little answer back and he said I thought it was going to be days before I would hear from you. But I was so glad I answered it because it was just it was needed right at that time and and we just uh we have a long-standing friendship. So it's just really wonderful. I'm going to have you stand if you will with me and uh we're going to go to the word. Uh you can turn to Genesis the 24th chapter and we'll read some verses there. Before we read, let's speak to the author. Amen. We can turn the pages as you are with the human strength, but I can tell you as the prophet said, it takes something else and someone else. &gt;&gt; Amen. to open what's in these pages. &gt;&gt; May God help me, help us this morning. Our dear father God eternal in the heavens, you are the one that has uh been the author of this book. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, you are the one that sent. You said, "I Jesus have sent mine angel." Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray that today, this morning, that you'll send, Father, a special portion upon this waiting audience, upon those that are have joined with us and are connected hearttoheart, attribute to attribute, wherever they may be in the in the world today. Those here, Lord, in the fellowship room or in the nursery or whatever part of this building they're in. But we're waiting on you, Lord. Here in the sanctuary, we're waiting on you. I'm standing behind this pulpit and I'm waiting on you, oh God. And as your messenger said, we can do nothing, nothing, nothing, but you can do all things. &gt;&gt; And we believe in you today, Lord. Come in your power. Come in your grace and mercy and longsuffering. I pray, Father, that you will bless us today with just a special presence. We're looking to you, Lord. Our hearts are open. We realize we can do nothing within ourselves, Lord, but we're here to hear from you. Bless all, I pray. They stand at the post of duties in Jesus Christ's name. Anoint us now. Anoint me, Lord, I pray for your glory. Amen. I want to read from Genesis 24 and we'll start at verse 4 down to verse 7. But thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac. And the servant said unto him, Pre-adventure, the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land, must thy needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. the Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that swear unto me, saying, Unto the seed, unto thy seed will I give this land, he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then. Look at verse 27, please. And now Eleazar the servant is speaking. And he said, "Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth. I being in the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren." &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless his word to our heart. You may want to keep your Bibles handy and open as you have your seats. I I want to take this text and that text largely is the theme of what I have on my heart to say to you. Go to my kindred and take a wife unto my son. Go to my kindred and take a wife unto my son. In the message, hear ye him. Brother Brham makes this comment. Well, what have we done? Speaking in Spokane, Washington, we've added members. We've got better churches, bigger membership. What we need is quality, not quantity. &gt;&gt; That's the trouble. That's the hunting of the bride today. That's the hunting of the bride today. I know something about hunting, been raised on it, and I can tell you that I have uh learned a few things. And you have to be sometimes subtle, sometimes very fast, sometimes very slow, very patient. And that's where most people stumble as a hunter. They're not patient. They just can't wait. They've got to move. They've got to do something. But that is something about hunting. Now the prophet is saying that's the hunting of the bride today. Eleazar had an awful time finding quality and then to get her ready to go was the next thing. So number one had an awful time finding quality. That was number one. After he found quality then to get her ready to go was the second thing. after he found it. So that's the next thing to do. He says, "Ah, we're hunting for that." Now, the Holy Spirit, God's servant was Eleazar, is hunting for that quality, that genuiness, that something that won't take back on God's word. Something that won't take back on God's word, won't fall back on God's word. It'll stand there, live or die, and say it's the truth. God said so, and that settles it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, even in our weak times or when we don't feel like uh giving some uh loud acclamation, confirmation of our faith in God. We all run into those times. But even in those moments, it's important that we make our declaration. It is the word of God is the truth. The message has declared it. God has confirmed it and I believe it and I disregard what whatever I'm going through right now has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; We'll all encounter uh our our difficult times. We'll all encounter times we don't have great feelings and we don't have great exuberance and we'll all encounter times when things are difficult in the world and reversals are happening and this isn't the way I planned it. We'll all have those times. We all do have those times. But it's what comes out of our mouth by the confession of our mouth. This word is the truth of God. He has declared it. He has confirmed it. He has vindicated it. And I believe it. &gt;&gt; And devil, you can just take that. &gt;&gt; It's important that we do that. &gt;&gt; Not doesn't just bolster ourselves up. It is declaring what is true. I would like if we could this morning to look at the big picture and I hope it's not too big. We'd like to see I would like if we could see all that God has done. If we could view things from this perspective, if we could see all that God has done, all that is recorded in the word of God. all that is happening presently, anything that has taken place in our lives and all that God might do in our in the future. If we could just look at the whole picture and funnel it down and say it was for one purpose, it was that God would send out his Holy Spirit and draw a bride, a wife for his son Jesus Christ. That is the purpose. This is, as many have said, the greatest love story. And it begins with the first Adam and his wife in Eden right in the opening chapters and concludes with the second Adam and his wife in the closing chapters. Come, I will show you the lamb's wife. That is what the whole whole story is about. And if we could just have an overview and somewhere between this in Genesis and this in Revelation, somewhere between that, here we're sitting tonight, this morning, &gt;&gt; here we are, and we're either part of that or we're not. And if we declare I am part of that then everything that God has done that he has planned that he's ordained redemption and salvation and the sacrifice and the sending of the Holy Spirit and the birth of the early church and all that ever happened has happened. It all has happened for that purpose that that this Bible can have a consummation that there can be a time. We call it the end, but it's not really the end. It's the beginning. &gt;&gt; It's just going to unfold into greater things, greater realities. &gt;&gt; In the millennium, the prophet said, he talked about all the scientific achievement and how that television has sounds going through the room and we just don't have the device right here. We could pick it up a radio and do the dial and you could hear all kinds of voices. Where are they coming from? They may be coming from uh uh the Europe or South America or or somewhere else, but but they're going through here right now. We're not set up to catch that sound. &gt;&gt; And there's he said there's colors going through the room and there's voices going through the room. There's bodies. He said bodies going through the room. There's images going through the room right now. You don't have the device to catch it. &gt;&gt; But that's the time that we're living in. And he said television was here when Elijah was here. Television was here when Jesus was here. Television was here when Moses was here. But they didn't have they didn't have the the technology to catch it. But it was here. God had set all of that in motion from the very beginning. And he said and and he said, "And and likewise are the angels here. And likewise is Jesus Christ here. This body is not set up to feel him or these eyes are not set up to t to see him. So we can't touch him. We can't see him. And these ears are not made to hear him. But we have been given by God. We've been given every son and daughter of God has been given a device that can hear him, that can sense him, that can see him. And it is much clearer vision than these eyes. We're not talking about 2020 now. We're talking about something that's divinely given of God. And and for those people, for those that hear him, see him, know him, for those people, this entire story, everything that's happened has happened for one purpose, and that is go get my son, &gt;&gt; a wife. Amen. Shall I if she won't come, shall I bring your son back again? That would have broken the type because Jesus Christ is not coming back into this element. &gt;&gt; It's going to be a changed world. When he come, when he arrives, what he's what he's doing now is sending his messenger, sent his servant to take us to him &gt;&gt; where he is. Hallelujah. beyond this veil and this corruption that is here, this sin, this degradation. We're going He came and he suffered that once and he suffered once and shed his blood once and carried it into the Holy of Holies once. Hallelujah. He doesn't have to do it again. And then he's getting his redeemed and taking them to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. everything that's been done and everything that is happening. I want to focus on on that. Some of you have your families here. Some of you young people have your parents here and you have some natural human ties. But I would like to suggest to you that all of that is only secondary, very much secondary. We feel close to them. I feel very close to my family. But I have to confess and keep in mind that's very secondary to the family that God determined he would institute. And one that you may not feel closely to emotionally. There be no emotional tie in God's mind or much closer to you than even family because it's his family. He said, "Where's the house that you build me? Where's my household? Where's my sons? Where's my daughters? Where are they?" That's the family that God is real, real concerned with. I'll say all those that God used down through the ages have a dual purpose. If we were to look in the Old Testament, all those that God used, all down through the ages have a dual two-fold purpose. One was they had to live out that part that was allotted to them for that season that they lived. but God working through them, God speaking through them, God laying out the word and using all of the various vessels uh and uh those that he chose all down through the ages had an extended purpose and that purpose was through them ultimately because the whole focus here is go get my son a wife. Yes. &gt;&gt; Go and get my son alive. &gt;&gt; And everything that they lived was all part of that. God was uh God was just extending through them because their lives first were lived out to live a uh an an example. They have their own life to live and their own uh commission. They had to uh fulfill what God had ordained for them while they lived in their lifetime. Be it Abraham, be it Joseph, be it Samuel, whoever it was, be it David, they had to live that life that God had ordained for them. But secondly, their lives were a type and a shadow of things which were to come. Rebecca, her type still lives now this morning. She had her life to live. She had to get on her camel. You have to get on yours. &gt;&gt; She had to say, "I will go." You have to say, "I will go." &gt;&gt; As I'm going to a land and to a man I've never seen, but I I have confidence in this messenger. You have to have the same. &gt;&gt; If you don't have the same, you're not going to get there. &gt;&gt; You've got to have that same quality, &gt;&gt; that same uh faith. &gt;&gt; You see, it all it all had a purpose. It all had an extended purpose. God through her was really saying and God through Eleazar saying he said the Lord in his prayer the Lord has led me to the house of my master's brethren. Now, one person in this generation who could really make that a declaration, and perhaps he did, would be brother Brandham himself. He could say, "The Lord has led me. I've journeyied a long ways. I've traveled around the world, seven times around the earth. I've been in the many nations and been in dark places and been in great auditoriums, been in these various countries. But the Lord has led me to my master's house. &gt;&gt; The Lord has led me to my master's kindred. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, my friends today to be able to sit here and say, "God led him to his master's kindred." &gt;&gt; To his master's children, &gt;&gt; I was connected to the master before the messenger came. [Applause] Can you believe that? &gt;&gt; You were connected. You were kindred. &gt;&gt; Before the master came, &gt;&gt; before the messenger came, Rebecca was already a kindred. She was already part of the family, it was only Eleer telling her that she had another role to fulfill. &gt;&gt; A role that she didn't realize, didn't dream she would ever fulfill that role. We've been called to a place. And so they lived out their part of God's plan in the age that they were called to live in. And they lived a testimony for future generations. God working through them as messengers. Messengers sent. In one way, Rebecca, and I'm just using that as an example because that's the scripture we're at, Rebecca. In one way, she could say, "I've been called. I've been called by this man. I've been called." And he was he's been sent. And I've been called through him to go to a man uh the son of a great man. and I'm to go to this son and I'm to be his wife. This is incredible. This is a this is amazing. But that's what I've been called for. But and that is her lot during her lifetime. But in her future testimony, in the future extension of God through her record, she also was one sent for you. &gt;&gt; Because we may have you uh those that read the scriptures, you read the Bible and you might be reading about Moses. You might be reading about some other servant of God and you read through the scriptures. So you could be you could be reading concerning the the New Testament of the disciples and what Peter did or Paul did and the life they lived and somehow on the one hand they had been called to live out the life and do the things that they were called to do. That was that was part one. Part two was they were sent and their record was written out and you perhaps read it and while you were reading it, the Holy Spirit who gave authorship to the book, to this book, the word of God, that Holy Spirit comes to you and speaks to you and grips you m moves you because of their record, because of their testimony. In that respect, they were sent to you because through their testimony, through their life, through their example, you were drawn &gt;&gt; Godward. &gt;&gt; And that's the purpose. That's the second part of the purpose. The one was they had their life to live. And the second part was they were also sent to find that bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you cannot understand my my concept &gt;&gt; and I'd like to just take a quantum leap just for a moment so I can get you your mind in the same channel that that my whole heart and burden for the word is this morning. You have been called &gt;&gt; and that you know &gt;&gt; I've been called. You've been called. You sat in the meeting. You felt the call. I heard the call. &gt;&gt; I felt the pull. But I'm here today to say, have you heard that you've been sent? &gt;&gt; As the father has sent me, so send I you &gt;&gt; for what purpose? Get my bride. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I thought that was a messenger's responsibility." It was indeed that was initially his responsibility. But you have received that. You've received the call. And after receiving the call, while you live out your part, God is extending himself by the Holy Spirit through you. And your life is influencing someone else, speaking to someone else. Maybe someone you'll never see or never know or shake their hand, but you're having an effect on them and drawing them God word. You were sent to that one. &gt;&gt; And herein is a natural life. your mothers and fathers that are here. You mothers and fathers that are have families, God has called you on one sense and you're living out your life as God gives you wisdom and direction, but beyond that, you have been sent first to your family. You've been sent to them. I'm getting way ahead of myself, but I thought and I was so affected by the prodal son, we call him the prodal son, and he took his portion of the inheritance, took it to a far country and wasted it with riotous living and with all kinds of uh who knows what kind of parties he was in there in his riotous living. And then when he came to nothing, his friends kind of vanished. But a citizen of that country. It's amazing how you get connected with the wrong people &gt;&gt; when you start wasting your substance, waste your strength, waste your youth. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, young people, I tell you, the devil's a liar. And he can never be truthful. He tell you, "Oh, wait. Have some fun." Yeah, have some fun. All right. Your youth will be gone. Your strength will be gone. Your beauty will be gone. Years will be gone. You will have wasted them. Don't waste them. I say to you all that are here today, how time is so fleeting. And you'll soon find that the time of opportunity slips by. Don't let it slip by. Now is the day. If you're here without Christ, now is the day of salvation. Today is the day. Now is the moment. When should I surrender to Christ? 5 minutes ago. Hallelujah. Not at the end of the meeting. Surrender now. I surrender all. I give myself to you. What a privilege this is. There's a call that goes out. And the call the call goes out to call you in. But then by the same token, you're also sent. You're sent to someone sitting beside you. You're sent to be an influence. You're sent to have an effect. You're sent to say the right thing. &gt;&gt; You're sent by God &gt;&gt; for his one purpose. &gt;&gt; My wife, &gt;&gt; my bride, &gt;&gt; this is what the story is all about. That's how the book ends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The lamb and his wife. &gt;&gt; That's what this whole thing is about. &gt;&gt; And the prodical son got connected with the wrong people. He got connected by the that's the only people he get connected with with the direction he went. &gt;&gt; But while he was feeding the hogs and living off of their food and that's all that's out there. &gt;&gt; We had prayer this morning cuz I got a call this morning. a man from a incredibly wealthy family in Canada, one of Canada's wealthier families. And the man was born a privileged child, born in wealth and and opulence, could have had anything and probably did, but he wasted the substance somehow and became addicted to cocaine. And today he's 58 years old. Today while I got the call, he's reading the message leadership. Oh, I thought what a what a message for him. How he needed that leadership in his life. And today he's reading it. Perhaps while we're still here in church, he's reading that leadership, but he wasted his substance and his life is gone. And I can tell you, the same devil that talks to you talks to him. The same devil that talked to him talks to you and I. Talks to you young people. Oh, wait. Oh, and just have your time. Don't listen to him. He's a liar. And when you get my age, you'll be so thankful. Well, I'm thankful for the biscll you told me. Nailed it down. I don't want to give him a moment of my life. One minute is one minute too long. Don't give him a moment of your life. And you'll get connected to the wrong people. You'll have the wrong boyfriend. You'll have the wrong girlfriend. You'll have the wrong wife, &gt;&gt; the wrong husband. You'll have trouble. And the devil be laughing at your foolishness. Said you listen to that kind of preaching and then went out like this, went away. &gt;&gt; God have mercy. &gt;&gt; And while he was there eating the husks of the hogs, &gt;&gt; feeding on the pig's food, &gt;&gt; he awakened. Amen. &gt;&gt; He came to himself &gt;&gt; and this was his great revelation. &gt;&gt; My father, &gt;&gt; he treats his servants better &gt;&gt; than I'm being treated. He remembered how his daddy treated his employees. &gt;&gt; He didn't have some great revelation of the creator and heavens and earth and some massive thing when his daddy back when he was a boy. when his daddy was treating his servants and his workers and giving them sufficient bread and treating his employees correctly according to the law that stuck in his heart. &gt;&gt; How my father treats his employees &gt;&gt; and the father perhaps not realizing that actually that act in that act he was sending for his son. [Applause] You mothers and fathers, &gt;&gt; you may not realize it, but while you live your life, you're being observed by your own and by others around you. But your old family, children are watching you. They're observing you. And you may not realize it. They may go astray, but one day they wake up. &gt;&gt; One day the Holy Spirit will bring them to their senses. &gt;&gt; Say, "I remember &gt;&gt; what my father said, what my mother said, how they lived, and the integrity that they had." &gt;&gt; And that's all he thought of. &gt;&gt; How my father treated his employees, his servants. He said, "That's better than I'm at &gt;&gt; and I'll just go back and be one of his servants." &gt;&gt; This came to my mind and I'm going to do it anyway. Our brother Jim Douly is here and very often he's away but at his there was a children the family put on a little birthday for him some years ago. I won't say how many. I don't know exactly but I believe it was your 50th birthday, brother Jim. And I don't believe Brother Jim will mind if I say this, but he has an eldest son. And this eldest son is much like the younger son today. He's not here in fellowship. He's up in the Yukon. And I think mother and dad are sitting here. And I get very personal at times and perhaps go out on a branch, out on a limb, but I believe I could speak on behalf of Brother Jim and Sister Lynn. They wish that he was where they are spiritually. But that son, his name is also James, and he got up and spoke on behalf of his dad. It's the only time I've experienced in my life, brother Jim, Sister Len, where something fit the scripture so perfectly. And I know he does not walk in the light of the word as you desire he would, but he got up to speak about his father. And I can see he was moved. He was exercised somewhat. And he wasn't just saying nice things, but he referred to one thing specific. He said, "The way my father treats his employees." &gt;&gt; Said, "I hope I can do that &gt;&gt; when I'm his age." &gt;&gt; I hope I can have that testimony. &gt;&gt; I hope I can have that testimony. Somehow I was touched and I never forgot that. I thought that was really special to have a son saying and that's what this boy was saying while he's in the pig pen &gt;&gt; saying my father my father treats his servants better than I'm being treated. I will return. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And &gt;&gt; brother Jim, may God based on your testimony grant you that on the basis of the word of God, I believe the Holy Spirit works on those things. &gt;&gt; So, not only are we called, but we're also sent. And I'm sure our brother Jim as well as perhaps the father recorded in the scripture and us that are here, we perhaps did something just as a matter of responsibility and didn't realize that that act was actually uh the the it was actually the arm of God reaching into the future that would be the very power that would call and you've been sent to that one to call them back &gt;&gt; to father's house. &gt;&gt; It's always been someone's been sent. John said, John the Baptist said, "I'm not the Christ, but I am sent before him. I'm sent for the purpose of getting a hold of some of you." That's why I've been sent. Had to realize that. And the scripture says, "God sent his only begotten son. Jesus Christ was sent." And when the word sent comes into the Hebrew, it has a a a definite purpose. I'm sent. And this this I want to nail down. I want to really draw you into this what I feel is for us this morning. We're not here just to be recipients. You're not here in church this morning just to be blessed and be recipients of God's blessing. But God would superimpose on your mind that you're not just a son and daughter of your father and mother. That is not it. God. If you're a called a child of Christ, if you're called as a son and daughter of God, then I am to announce to you today, and I've never spoken on this subject in my life, but I feel I'm ordained of God to announce to you today, you have been sent to this generation. You've been sent to some people that will make contact with you. You've been sent to more than you'll ever realize. and your words and your actions and your very character. &gt;&gt; Your manner, your demeanor, your conduct, all of these things are part of God's commission to us. You have been sent, go get my son, a bride. And when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth a son made of a woman made under the law. And then said Jesus, as my father hath sent me, so send I you. One that has sent, he is sent. He's one that is sent forth and he's sent with orders. Brother Brandham said, "If we work for someone, the first thing we need to do is find out what he wants us to do." Today, I'm here to say to this congregation and all who hear, we haven't been sent just to be called by the message. We haven't been We haven't been born, I should say, just to be called by the message, to be called by the messenger. But also we have been called that you might be commissioned and that you might make known be know what it is that God wants you to do and realize I've been sent. Tomorrow morning when you start your duties wherever you are realize you're sent. &gt;&gt; If mothers take their children to school I've been sent. Those that are teaching in the classes I've been sent. Wherever the men at the factory I've been sent of God. I've been sent to this place. I've been sent to have an effect in the world. I've been sent. I have a commission of almighty God. I am a scent one. &gt;&gt; Not just John the Baptist, not just Jesus, not just William Brandham, not just Paul. You &gt;&gt; that will change things. You may have some extreme difficulties tomorrow. Just remember, I've been sent to face this. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been sent to experience this. &gt;&gt; I've been sent to have this ridicule. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You kids in school, I've been sent &gt;&gt; I've been sent this person was sent to even tell me I'm I'm wacko or whatever. &gt;&gt; Or someone else will say, "What do you have? &gt;&gt; I've observed you. You've been sent to them. The Bible says that God sent his son. God sent his son. When did that begin? When did he send his son? When Mary conceived? No. When did he send his son? And I'm saying today, God sent you. When did he send you? When was it that he intended to send you? Well, he intended you to appear at this time. He intended you to hear and be called by the word that you've been called by. He intended that to happen. And he intended also that you would realize, I'm not just been called. I haven't just been uh one that's been brought in to receive wonderful things. I've also been one commissioned. I've also been one anointed. I've also have received the Holy Spirit. And I am a sent one. &gt;&gt; And the one I am sent to somewhere out in this crowd, somewhere out in this world that I mingle with, somewhere out there, I've been sent to someone. And they're going to read, they're going to see something. They're going to hear something. They're going to be influenced in a certain direction. And that is actually God from before the foundation of the world who saw I would come here at this time extending his arm through me and pulling this member of the bride of Jesus Christ. So I am set to them. &gt;&gt; Get him. &gt;&gt; Get her. &gt;&gt; So when did God send you? God sent for some amongst the Christian businessmen. In the message who is Jesus this was quite late message 1964 but it tells brother Brennham tells about brother Deus Shakarian who is the president of the international Christian businessman Christian businessmen international and he says the international president brother Shakarian in I was made acquainted with him many years ago. I believe it was in the early 50s. I think about 51 because he said he was going to Africa right after that. And when he went to Africa, it was Sister Linda Maritz's father and just a a very small handful of people that met him and had him. And I I became aware of that when I first met brother Ratif. And so he's an eyewitness to having met him in uh in Africa. I believe the the second time that he was there. I don't believe it was the first time, but second time. I'm not too exactly sure on that. He said and uh he said many of you know about it. And brother Brandon begins to begins to relate. He says of the telegrams laying on my desk so high telegrams come here pray for this one pray for that one and he's sifting through these telegrams and he says and I found a woman named Shakarion dying with cancer now he's got a pile of telegrams come to my church come to our city the Christian or the businessmen or whatever more the ministerial association or whatever it was invitations hundreds if not thousands piles and he's sifting through them just going through these telegrams and he sees this name Shakarion he says and someone the Lord and somehow the Lord led me over and that's where I got acquainted with the Shakarans when she was healed and from That time God led me over. Now here is this messenger called of God. Go get my son, a bride, bringing a message to a world in the very early 50s. The second pull, the revealing of the secrets of the hearts maybe just beginning and uh and the message hasn't even opened up yet. and the opening of the seals and the serpent's seat and all of these things haven't even been spoken but already a doors opening and he sees this name amongst all of those and it's Shakarion and from seeing that name he said God led him over and Deus Shakarion either was the president or became the president and opened up cities all over the all over the North America for him to go and it was one of the last doors that was open to him. And there he's blasting it out in 1965 to the churches and the doors and the chapters that were opened and birth pains. I was listening to it yesterday and there he is speaking it out and he said he was so thankful some of these doors were still remaining open to brother Carl Williams of the full gospel businessmen and and I thought oh God from that one statement and God led me over how he could say as it was with Eleazar and you have brought me to my father's to my my master's kindred head. &gt;&gt; I'm finding her. &gt;&gt; He said there was a doctor Theodore Palovius and that was a doctor for Mrs. Shakarion. And when brother Brandham came in there, he said the very idea you building up the you building the people under a false conception. He said you're giving them a false hope. And he said, "The woman is laying there dying and she had had both breasts removed and her body was all swelled up." He says, "And I went into the house." He says, "And now when you go in, the doctor said, "Be reverent and quiet because the woman's dying." Now, he just been knew that he just been sent over. He saw that name. He's been sent over responding to the telegram and the doctor is telling him, "Don't distress her. Don't just be quiet. She's a dying woman. Be real reverent." And so he knelt down to pray. And when I did, he says, "There came the angel of the Lord down to the bed and said, in three days she'll be up. [Applause] And here came the doctor Polyovius and was going to run me out of the house. And he said, "The very idea, well, building those people under a false hope, that woman's dying." And I said, "According to all your statistics, it is, but according to the word of the Lord, no." I said, "She's going to live." And he said, "Nonsense." He said, "You should leave this place and get out of here." And he said, and brother Shakarion stepped up and said, "Wait a moment." He said, "We had you down here also as our doctor, and we appreciate you, but we also we also called Brother Brham. Your hopes, you gave us none. &gt;&gt; He does." And I said, "Tell you what I'll do." He said, "If she isn't up again within 3 days, I'll put a sign on my back. False prophet, and you can go right through here in Los Angeles, get in your car, go down the street blowing your horn and pointing to me. And then if she is up, let me put a sign on your back." quack doctor &gt;&gt; and get in your car and blow the horn. And I can tell you she wasn't only up in three days. She lived for many, many, many years. And brother Brandon was not he was not the kind of man that would make him put a sign on his back. But you know what happened? You know what happened? He said, "I was sent." You know what happened to Dr. Pavolas? He said, "Baptize me. &gt;&gt; I'll receive this kind of Jesus Christ. Baptize me." And the messenger sent to him. &gt;&gt; And God through that brought the man to redemption, salvation, and then the doors swung open. And I'm so glad they did. You ought to go through the messages and hear the titles of the messages that were spoken in Christian businessmen international conventions or at their chapters and brother Brandham said help them to establish many many chapters. What am I saying friends that they were called &gt;&gt; but they were also sent. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was called of God but he was sent of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You have been called of God but you have been sent of God. Hallelujah. Don't ever forget it. You've been sent. &gt;&gt; You're sent to your children. You're sent to your wife. You're sent to your husband. You're sent to this church. &gt;&gt; We're under an awesome responsibility before God to live honorable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To edify the body of Christ. We've been sent. &gt;&gt; I haven't been sent to be a failure. You've been sent to be a success. &gt;&gt; We're not sent to drag people down. were sent to lift him up. &gt;&gt; I'm wondering how God sent for you. He said, "God looked down through the stream of time and saw every man that would be saved." God looked down through the stream of time and saw every person, every man, every woman, every one of you that are here. God, he said, "Look down through the stream of time. and saw you. And because he saw you, he sent just exactly the right kind of mingling of history. He He knew exactly every verse you'd read in the Bible. &gt;&gt; And he knew precisely the one that you'd read when he'd send his spirit upon you and move you and and and you'd well up with an emotion within say, "Oh, God, I I I that is having such an effect on me." God knew that. &gt;&gt; God ordained that. And that man, that woman when they lived their life back there was actually being sent to you. &gt;&gt; Their testimony would be sent to you on the pages called the word of God the Bible. &gt;&gt; Are you getting my point? &gt;&gt; And God by his in infinity looked down through the stream of time and saw every man that would be saved, every man. And he knew it by fornowledge. And we must know, we must know that we have been sent to those that are around us and to our generation. In the message why it had to be shepherds, notice he said, "As a father," and he's quoting the scriptures, "The father sent me as Jesus said, "So send I you." The father that sent him went in him to confirm the word. &gt;&gt; The father that called you &gt;&gt; has sent you &gt;&gt; and goes in you. &gt;&gt; Can you &gt;&gt; go with me there? Amen. &gt;&gt; The father that called you, the father that sealed you with the Holy Spirit is the same one that goes with you &gt;&gt; to confirm &gt;&gt; that you are not only called but you also been sent. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And as the the same Jesus that sends his people goes in the people that he sends." and why it had to be shepherd. It would be good for you to take these phrases so that you can remember this service this morning. It will not be forgotten. I pray in Christ is a mystery of God. He said, I don't want you to miss this. And as the father has sent me, so send you. He quotes the scripture. Jesus said, the father that sent him went in him to vindicate himself, right? For he was the word. And the same Jesus that sends you goes with you and in you to vindicate the same God. That's a mouthful. &gt;&gt; The same God that went in Jesus Christ. And Jesus goes in you to confirm that it is him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's supernatural, friends. And as the father hath sent me, and I live by the father, so send you, and you live by me. What is he? He is the word. You live by the message of the hour, my brother, my sister. You live by the word of God. The same God that called you goes with you. I'm just looking here. See what I want to There's several times I want to read and I would I would ask that this might be you might want to know where this is. listen to this prayer very closely. And I believe that every one of you can pray this prayer. Now, Satan, how many of you ever had to talk to Satan, tell him to do a thing or two? Now, Satan, I know you're holding this people. Dark, gloomy, hideous things holding over them, saying, "Well, I'll make a try at it." But I want to speak to you. I stand in their place between them and God this morning. I stand as a servant of the almighty God. My sins are gone through the blood of Jesus Christ by divine faith. Can you say that? Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; My sins are all gone are gone through the blood of Jesus Christ by divine faith and that I have in him as the son of God. And I claim and the Bible claims first and I speak as the Bible that he spoiled every power that you ever had at Calvary. Can we say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible claims that his disciples are to carry his commission that he had here on earth to the end of the age. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And we're there. &gt;&gt; And I am his disciple. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; How many disciples? I want you to make a confession. I am his disciple. &gt;&gt; I come as a representative. as a representative of Jesus Christ in his actions. And here it is. I am sent in his place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; These are bold statements. I would like every person, young, old, and whatever, whoever can understand me that ought to be able to say that I have been sent in his place. Jesus Jesus hasn't got shoe leather on like I have this morning. He's not in contact physically with this world, but I have been sent to this age, to this time, to this people. &gt;&gt; You've got to believe that &gt;&gt; because that's what the Bible teaches. I've sent you. &gt;&gt; And he said, I and he's telling the devil, I've been washed in the blood. My sins are forgiven. And I'm representative of Almighty God according to the scripture. and I am sent in his place and and and what whenever I call over the person, your power will break. &gt;&gt; Oh my friends, is this just a story? Is this just a prayer? Or is this a confidence that he had in God? And is this just for him? He said in the church ages that the that the every messenger had his wick in the oil. &gt;&gt; And it was not for the messenger only. But it was for all of them of that age. &gt;&gt; It's for you this morning. If you want to live in the hog pen, go ahead. But I am urging you to get out of it. &gt;&gt; If you want to live on meager fair and starve to death, that's up to you. But you don't have to. Amen. &gt;&gt; And nobody here is is no one can say I don't understand that. Of course you understand it. &gt;&gt; Of course you grasp it. &gt;&gt; You've been sent to this generation. &gt;&gt; And now you must stand up and make a declaration. And he said to the Satan, I now challenge you in the name of the name of Jesus Christ. In his blood I stand and you leave every person who I lay my hands upon. Not in my holiness. Not in my name. For my name is nothing to you. My holiness is nothing. He's talking to the devil. I have none. But you won't recognize my name, but you'll recognize Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you're going to come out. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Is that just for him? Is that just history? Or is that right now? and you're going to come out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I lay my hands on and pray, you're going to come out. &gt;&gt; Your power is broken. My sins are forgiven. This is the Bible standing here. Not the Bible in a book. &gt;&gt; Not just this is a Bible standing here. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God being lived out. And the Christ who said, "As God has sent me, so send I you. I've been sent." &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, if this church could realize that, if this church could realize that, it would change it. It would change the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You won't recognize my name. It doesn't mean anything. But he says, "I go now in a challenge." and you try to hold any of these people, may the curse of God come upon you. He's saying to the devil, may the curse of God come upon you. He needs to have five or 6 hundred people here today announce to him and I challenge you and may the curse of God come upon you in this day. says you're he says you may get out and take your hand off of these Christians. You're dirty, sickening, hand afflicting and crippling and sickening these people and giving them diseases. You take your hand off in the name of Jesus Christ. He realized he was sent &gt;&gt; and he gave himself to it. Jesus was sent. Paul was sent. I'm going to say I want to add one more thing because I'm coming to the where I want to close. being sent bringing as it were birth. It's always been associated with travail. &gt;&gt; It doesn't come easy. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said Eleazar he had an awful time. &gt;&gt; We know nothing about his journey. I tell you that you can be sure that Satan tried to prevent him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He just didn't. He he had a commission. He was commanded of his master Abraham. And shall I bring it twice? Shall I bring the son back or shall I return your son to the your kindred? Beware that you don't do that. That's not going to happen. You have to bring her here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; These that believe, oh, we're going to just see the heavens open and and some big carpet come down. on. It's it's just a a figment of their imagination. That's not the way it's going to happen. There's going to be a group of people. We that are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them that are resurrected to meet the Lord in the air. Is that the scripture? Is that the Bible? That's what we believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And devil, you cannot hold them that are in the graves, that are asleep in Christ, for they're going to rise according to this word of God. Hallelujah. This word of God that's not only written but is living in the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Tell my brother, my sister, we could keep you here quite a while but I don't want to. But there was birth pains and that is why Paul said I travail and birth again for you. &gt;&gt; Mary when she was conceived of the Holy Ghost, she had travail and brought forth a son. Israel had travail. And the prophet said, "Under every prophet's voice, Israel was in travail." The nation was in travail because the old has to die. And there may be some things here that need to die this morning. You got to die to your own concepts. Die to your own ideas. Die to your own little uh whatever it might be, things that are so precious to you or whatever more. You need to die to it. Die to your agenda and accept that of the Holy Spirit. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That a new life can be brought forth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It takes pain to bring forth sons and daughters. So, not only have you been called, but you have been sent. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And let it be known to you when one is sent. It isn't always easy. You may go through an awful time finding that one with character &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit starts to work on them and your life begins to affect them and then they come and are united to this lovely bridegroom Jesus Christ. Be it known to you that one day, more real than you are here this morning, you're going to have someone run up, shake your hand, &gt;&gt; say, "Who are you?" Well, you don't remember me. No, I certainly don't. When we were on earth, you lived next to me. &gt;&gt; You worked in a factory beside me. &gt;&gt; You went to school. You sat in the seat next to me. You sat ahead of me. I watched you. I watched how you did things. I watched when you said yes and I watched when you said no. And I saw Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Be it known to you that this Holy Spirit of God is working through his people calling. You've been sent my people. You've been sent of God to this generation. I don't want to spend any time on my personal, but I'll tell you what, friends. Sitting on the 19th floor of the Toronto Dominion building in Toronto, and I just found out after I told this last testimony that our brother Curt Steiner was a chef up on the top floor. He was higher up. up there about 50 floors or so, wasn't it, brother? 57 or something up there as a chef in the same building. Here we are. Hasn't God got a sense of humor? &gt;&gt; Says, "I'm going to take a little guy out of the 19th floor and I'm going to take a chef out of the 57th floor and I'm going to have them fellowshipping together in the same church over in a hicktown called Cloverdale." &gt;&gt; Who can figure that out, Brother David? &gt;&gt; Who can figure that out? I was sitting there trying to put together things and negotiate and all the rest of it and something down inside. You're going to leave this. You're going to leave this. You're going to leave this. Let me get that out of my mind. I've been waiting for this all my life. How in the world can I be leaving it? It's just some wild thought. I just put it out of my mind and I lay on bed and wherever it was that nagging inside to finally said okay what do you want Lord I want you to go west where I don't have any idea as I studied and prayed and waited on Lord for this on one hand I was being called and On the other hand, I was being sent &gt;&gt; and I've been sent here. &gt;&gt; And I've been sent to do all that I can. Everything that is possible that God will allow me to do. I've been sent to have an effect and to be an influence and to stand stable and stand steady. And God help us. Help us each one. And you've been sent. God called you, but you came in and you've been sent now. And may God cause us to be fruitful in the land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my precious brothers and sisters, whatever part that you are here, I want to say you're a lovely Rebecca. You're a lovely bride. And don't let anybody ever say anything different. It's lovely what God has put together. It's lovely that God has called you. Hallelujah. And you need to honor that. You need to respect that and at the same time confess without any hesitancy. And I have been sent. And when you run into a snag, you run into the devil. You you say the same prayer brother Brandham said. I challenge you, Satan. You're looking at somebody that's been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ. You know nothing about this. You're looking at somebody that has truth in them. You know nothing about this. You're full of lies. You're full of impurity. You're vile. You're unclean. And I've been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ. I challenge you. Take your hand off my property. &gt;&gt; Be gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, does it work?" Of course it works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, sent ones. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he came to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I couldn't go to him, he came to me. &gt;&gt; Let's thank him as we pray. Father, how grateful we are. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful, Lord, had I not obeyed that little small voice inside telling me to leave and to go to some place, not knowing where, there was no family there, not knowing what you had in your mind. But here today, Lord, these many years later, and I see the glorious beauty of your creation, the new creation in your people, and see how marvelously and miraculously you called them and gathered them. And Lord, they also know, and I've just been confirming to them today, and I believe your Holy Spirit has been witnessing that they have been sent. They are sent ones with a uh particular mission and commission. And I pray, oh God, you'll bless them along the way. I pray that you will bless them and make them fruitful in their land and where they journey and the places that they work and the mothers in their home and the young people in their halls of learning and wherever they may be. May they know, oh God. I pray for our school, Father, our brother Randy Timberman, the principal, Lord, and all the teachers. I pray for them this morning that they may enter their classrooms, Lord, tomorrow, realizing they've been sent to these precious ones, oh Father. I pray, oh God, that mothers and fathers and and all that are here, grandparents and whatever more, oh God, we'll realize the awesome responsibility of being one sent. We have a certain message. We can't vary from it. Bless our brothers and sisters, Lord. all that are within the sound of my voice. I pray that you will bless them abundantly, abundantly. Send your Holy Spirit upon them. And when their mouth opens, may glorious utterances come forth. Jesus prosper your work. I pray. And this evening as our brother Anatoli is here amongst us. Oh God, may I ask you to bless father in a special way, his wife and his family, children, and the work where he is, Lord, and not having a lot of fellowship. I pray that you'll strengthen them. I pray that you will encourage them, Lord, and lead them on in the way. For there is no doubt in my heart but what you have called them and you have sent our brother to his people. And now Lord, I ask that you be with us throughout this afternoon. And may our conversation be edifying one to another. Jesus, Jesus, we are your disciples. And if there's anyone here that has listened to the word today, Lord, and they have some struggle. They've been weighing things out in their mind, I pray that they will cast it all. Cast it all down at your feet. Say, Lord, here's my life. Here's all that I am or all that I ever can be in Jesus Christ's name. Touch the afflicted, Lord. Touch those that are afflicted. You have done so many wonderful things for us. Oh God, I want to thank you for it. You didn't have to do it, but you did do it. Grace, grace, marvelous grace. Glory to your name. Glory to your name. Blessed be the name of Jesus. Let us all rise and just speak out of your heart. Thanksgiving to him. &gt;&gt; Lord, we give you praise. We give you glory. We take this time to give honor to you, to give glory to you. How worthy you are, Lord. Worthy you are. Oh, how worthy you are, Lord. How worthy you are. &gt;&gt; Precious lamb of God.

There might be a prodal son or a prodal daughter here today or one that's not in the building, but there's a believer here. And I'm sure the heart of the father is in you. Your yearning is for him. Your yearning is for her. And many times you look spiritually out over the horizon. Is he coming? Is he coming? Is he coming? [Music] I wonder if this is the day [Music] I'd love to have a part. I'd love to be rewarded on the other side just with you are faithful. You spoke. You lingered in the service. You said some things. As we stood at the graveside of our sister Marge Miller just getting ready to let the people depart and the Holy Spirit just came and words were uttering out of my mouth to the family. You must not say goodbye here when you have the opportunity just to say farewell. We must not miss those opportunities. Those they just come in a moment of time and maybe it's just something special happening here in your heart and speaking in a certain way. And you must not pass the opportunity say, "Oh God, give me grace now to do what I need to do. I'll deny the enemy. I'll deny the devil. I will not be his servant anymore. I'm going to give myself I'd love to be able to have an opportunity. Pray with you if you're that one. So, the minister's here. Don't escape it. He's come for you. Be like Rebecca. Will you go? Will you go? Say yes, I will go. Yes, I will go. He came to me. He came to me when I could not come to where he was. He came to me. [Music] That's why he once [Music] he came to me. &gt;&gt; We're going to sing it one more time. And I would just say to anyone [Music] if there's something that's not just exactly right and you know that God has spoken to you and is urging you now saying this is the moment then you've come. There could be a time when you want to come, but if God's not drawing you, it just it will not be the same. But if you need to come, we're just going to sing it once more and then we'll be closing the service for all that need to dismiss. He came to me. I ask the minister and brothers to come and help. He came to me. [Music] When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. [Music] That's why he died on Calary. [Applause] [Music] And I could not come to where he was.

Take me and send me. [Music] and I will be a faithful messenger for you. Amen. I trust that the word of God by the Holy Spirit today opened up to you and expanded your vision to see God working in the little minute parts of your life in areas you never thought of. &gt;&gt; God is working there. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are sent ones and God bless you as such. Holy Spirit [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] of mercy and grace. Now I welcome his face. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

We just want to be sensitive, Lord, to what you want us to do in our lives, Lord God. We just thank you, Lord, for everything you've done. We thank you for Sister Marge Miller, Lord. Just thinking of her. Thank you for her life, Lord, and the testimony it's been, Lord God. Let us just look to that, Lord Jesus. And just so when we leave this world, maybe people can look at us the same as we look at her. Just an amazing walk with the Lord. Lord, we just pray that you'd bless her and the family, Lord God. And we just God, we ask for this service, Lord, this morning, Lord, that you've spoken, Lord. We just ask, Lord, that we could take this, Lord, and put it in our lives, Lord God, and just remember it, Lord. Let us not forget it, Lord Jesus. Let us use it, Lord God. and pray for these ones that came forward, Lord, that you would bless them, Lord God, and give them strength and courage, Lord. We just ask that you'd go with us this afternoon and be with our conversations, whatever we do, Lord. And we just ask for the service tonight, Lord, that you'd bre bless the speaker, Lord.
