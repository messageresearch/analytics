[1:04] Going to ask uh
[1:07] sisters Eileen and uh Aair Elen and Aare
[1:11] I. They have a song for us this morning.
[1:14] They could come and get ready.
[1:17] We just have a couple announcements.
[1:20] Our sister Melany's mom and sister are
[1:23] here visiting with us. Nice to have you
[1:26] here. And uh also there's a note that
[1:30] we're going to
[1:32] uh for anyone interested in uh
[1:36] says if you're interested in joining us
[1:38] for Thanksgiving dinner at Mount Baker
[1:40] Bible Way Camp, please see the signup
[1:42] sheet on the bulletin board. That's from
[1:43] Brother Ron Caldwell. So, Amen. It's
[1:46] nice to have a campground not just to
[1:48] use once a year.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got it. So, that sounds that
[1:52] sounds good.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; Uh sisters are just going to sing a
[1:55] song. There's the just a note here that
[1:58] it's from Mark 5:25-34
[2:01] speaking of the woman with the blood
[2:03] issue.
[2:04] God bless you.
[2:09] [Music]
[2:24] 12 years she suffered
[2:27] with no hope. She just grew up
[2:32] physicians. There were many
[2:36] yet she was bound by their curse.
[2:40] on the verge of simply
[2:43] giving up, not knowing what to do.
[2:51] All her hopes were truly shattered.
[2:55] It seemed her life was through.
[3:11] Then she heard a commotion.
[3:16] People talking in a street.
[3:21] They said someone is coming. I think
[3:25] it's Jesus the Nazarene.
[3:28] They said that he could heal the sick
[3:33] and cause the blind
[3:35] to see.
[3:39] She wondered in her heart,
[3:42] could you do the same
[3:45] for me?
[3:47] [Applause]
[3:49] She began to make her way
[3:53] down the road to where he was.
[3:57] And though the crowd was pressing,
[4:01] she refused to give up.
[4:05] She reached out and touched his clothes
[4:09] for healing to impart.
[4:15] She not only touched his hand that day,
[4:20] she touched his heart,
[4:25] she touched the heart of Jesus.
[4:29] Her faith had made her home.
[4:33] In a moment's time, she took back what
[4:37] Satan had controlled.
[4:41] She found in her failing
[4:44] a brand new place to start.
[4:50] She not only touched his hand that day,
[4:55] she touched his heart.
[4:57] [Music]
[5:01] Without him, she had never seen me on
[5:06] her knee.
[5:08] But she trusts the chosen, the only one
[5:12] who could make her love complete.
[5:18] She touched the heart of Jesus.
[5:22] Her faith had made her whole. In a
[5:26] moment's time, she took back what Satan
[5:31] had control.
[5:34] She found in her failing,
[5:37] a brand new place to start.
[5:43] She don't only touch his hand that day,
[5:47] she touched his heart.
[5:51] [Music]
[5:53] She found in her failing
[5:56] a brand new place to start.
[6:02] She not only touched his hand that day.
[6:07] She touched his heart.
[6:12] She not only touched his hand that day.
[6:17] [Music]
[6:20] She touched his
[6:24] heart.
[6:26] [Music]
[6:33] Amen. Thank you, sisters.
[6:39] Amen. We're just thankful for all uh
[6:41] those that are visiting with us and many
[6:43] that have come for the wedding. Just
[6:45] glad to have all of our friends with us
[6:47] this morning, those that are streaming
[6:50] as well, and all that joined us. God
[6:52] bless you all.
[6:54] Let's uh stand and sing I love you,
[6:56] Lord. Number 239.
[6:59] because the Flora girls are going to
[7:01] come and sing for us.
[7:06] I love you, Lord.

[18:00] I want to see
[18:04] [Music]
[18:20] [Music]
[18:25] You believe he heard that prayer?
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Believe he hears us when we sing and
[18:30] worship him. I just if I were God, I'd
[18:33] be pleased to have a people that were
[18:36] singing from the depths of their heart
[18:38] in all sincerity,
[18:40] laying everything else aside, saying,
[18:42] "All I want to see,
[18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[18:44] &gt;&gt; is Jesus in me."
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful?
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Well, we
[18:50] we had a great time yesterday with uh at
[18:54] the wedding of our brother Simeon
[18:56] Iverson and Sister Leah Barios.
[19:01] uh and uh trust we were able to start
[19:04] them off on a happy beginning.
[19:07] Amen. God bless them and the family that
[19:09] is still here with us. We're so thankful
[19:13] for that. Uh sorry we can't accommodate
[19:17] everybody in the fellowship or rather in
[19:19] the sanctuary. We understand that one of
[19:22] the deacons just told me the fellowship
[19:23] room is maxed out. Uh we're thankful
[19:27] that you're here. We're thankful that
[19:29] you came to church, whether you're in
[19:31] the fellowship or in the nursery or
[19:32] wherever you are. And we're very very
[19:35] thankful for all of those that are uh
[19:38] streaming with us as well. And uh uh and
[19:42] and they're happy to be part of it. And
[19:45] so we want to greet them wherever they
[19:48] might be at this moment or when they may
[19:50] archive if it's a time zone is
[19:54] different. But we give them special
[19:56] greetings and I believe that they uh are
[20:00] some are streaming from uh Switzerland
[20:03] this morning as well uh where we have
[20:07] just experienced a marvelous marvelous
[20:10] miracle, supernatural miracle from God
[20:13] on behalf of our brother Jean Jacques
[20:17] and we are grateful to God. But I know
[20:19] prayers have been made all different
[20:22] parts of the world for him and so we
[20:24] give all the glory to God.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; God has heard our prayers. I have a a
[20:30] brief email from his brother uh brother
[20:33] Gerard and sister Angela Michel where
[20:37] sister Ruth and I stayed just a few
[20:40] about a month ago. And he has said this
[20:44] uh after he opened with a paragraph of
[20:46] greetings.
[20:48] I think that all these requests
[20:51] from my brother Jean Jacques before our
[20:55] God have been heard by him in such a way
[20:59] of compassion. He answered our prayers
[21:04] and we are all very blessed by this we
[21:07] could say resurrection.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought that was a very fitting
[21:12] word.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because it was."
[21:16] One day we shall know why.
[21:19] Jean Jacques said to a doctor, "This
[21:22] happened that I can testify to you about
[21:25] the kingdom of God." And this Friday,
[21:28] Jean Jacques testified about the message
[21:32] and gave some booklets to several.
[21:35] He can speak, read, write, and react
[21:40] positively to everything. He must still
[21:44] rest. And tomorrow, Sunday, they are
[21:48] with us today. He was just saying we're
[21:50] going to be streaming the service. And
[21:53] so, we want to say, God bless you,
[21:56] brother George. Thank you for this
[21:58] report and blessings from this entire
[22:00] congregation, prayers of this
[22:02] congregation. Please convey it to our
[22:04] brother Jean Jacqu. Uh we also received
[22:08] a letter from brother Jeanjac's wife,
[22:11] sister Marionette. And if she's uh
[22:14] streaming today, we want to send special
[22:17] greetings uh to you, Sister Marionette,
[22:19] and through you to your husband and to
[22:22] all of the family. She has said these
[22:25] words, big steps are made every day.
[22:29] John Jocks becomes more and more
[22:31] independent.
[22:33] For example, he walked half an hour this
[22:36] afternoon and he is pleased to talk with
[22:38] us. Nevertheless, it wears him out.
[22:42] Let's not forget it's just one week
[22:45] since he was out in a coma. Right.
[22:47] Praise God.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; And these things which he is doing is
[22:53] what the medical team and the best they
[22:55] have have said he would not be able to
[22:58] do any of these things.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; That's God Almighty.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's none less than God.
[23:06] And Jesus said, "We are so grateful for
[23:08] this spectacular evolution worthy of a
[23:12] spectacular God. We are so thankful for
[23:15] all your support, messages and kindness
[23:18] and prayers. And John Jacques asked to
[23:21] thank every one of you for all you did
[23:24] and are doing for him. She said he is
[23:28] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; We say, "Praise God." We're so thankful.
[23:36] We're also real happy to have our
[23:39] brother Owen Jorgensson with us today.
[23:42] For those of you that have read the
[23:43] little blue books,
[23:46] uh, brother Owen has worked for years on
[23:50] the books on the life of brother
[23:53] Brandham. And brother Owen, when we were
[23:56] in Ukraine, it was such a pleasant
[23:58] surprise to have uh, the brothers from
[24:02] Villnus stand up and all of the books
[24:06] have been translated. I won't say all of
[24:09] them, but they had the first three
[24:11] translated and put in a beautiful book.
[24:14] Uh all three of them are in one book, a
[24:17] thick book. Um and he said it's been
[24:20] such a blessing. So there it is in
[24:22] Russian and uh they said that they're
[24:24] ready to do the next three. Uh they're
[24:27] preparing to do it and just finalizing
[24:29] it. I'd like you to come and greet the
[24:31] people if you would please, brother
[24:33] Owen.
[24:36] God bless you and welcome.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Well, uh it is always a joy for me to
[24:43] come up and fellowship with you here.
[24:46] It's just always a blessing and uh uh
[24:48] greet you in the name of the Lord and uh
[24:51] give you a little report on the sixth
[24:54] book. It's it's virtually done. maybe a
[24:57] little bit of editing or polishing left,
[25:00] but uh I'm uh we're we're working on the
[25:04] details of publishing now and I'm just
[25:08] really confident or hopeful or Lord
[25:11] willing I'm looking for it the first of
[25:13] next year. So, we're finally there. And
[25:17] uh uh yesterday I was fellowshipping
[25:20] with a number several brothers and
[25:22] sisters. And it's always a joy to me
[25:25] when I do travel to have people come and
[25:28] say how this particular story meant
[25:33] something to them and how this story
[25:35] here touched their lives. And it's just
[25:38] such a blessing to me because uh I've
[25:41] been at this so long and I've put in
[25:45] somewhere between 10 and 12,000
[25:49] hours writing this biography. When I
[25:51] started, I had no idea what I was
[25:56] what a huge task it was, but it's a
[25:59] great blessing to me to see that it is a
[26:02] blessing to you. So, God bless you. I
[26:05] wanted to give a little bit of thanks to
[26:08] your pastor, brother Bisll, here because
[26:12] uh I don't know if he remembers this or
[26:14] not, but somewhere around 18 years ago,
[26:18] I c I had heard that uh brother Billy
[26:20] Paul was going to be up here giving a
[26:23] testimony. And I had just gotten I I'd
[26:27] already done a couple of years of
[26:28] research, but I just started writing the
[26:31] biography. And uh I felt it would be
[26:34] such a advantage to me if I could meet
[26:37] brother Billy Paul and uh you know then
[26:41] have a a little bit of a relationship
[26:43] with him where I could call him and ask
[26:45] him questions from time to time and see
[26:46] things that I'm writing about his dad
[26:48] and he knows a few things that I
[26:50] wouldn't know or wouldn't glean from the
[26:53] tapes. So I called brother uh Biscll and
[26:58] I told him what I wanted to do and asked
[27:02] him if I could have a short interview
[27:04] which with brother Billy Paul and of
[27:07] course now I've known your pastor. It
[27:10] was about 1971 or two when I first met
[27:14] uh your pastor but you know he has a lot
[27:17] of acquaintances and Billy Paul who's be
[27:20] here just a short time would have a you
[27:22] know quite a few demands in his time and
[27:24] brother Ed is the pastor is responsible
[27:27] to see that uh you know he's that
[27:29] brother Billy Paul's not swamped or
[27:31] overdone and I'm sure he prayed about it
[27:35] but here I am just a young man with a
[27:38] dream that's all I was well I'm you know
[27:41] a brother or a sister but uh we all have
[27:44] things we'd like to do that never get
[27:45] done. I mean most of us are there and
[27:48] here's a young man with a dream who
[27:50] calls and asks for this interview and I
[27:53] just wanted to thank him that he felt it
[27:55] on his heart to say yes. I'm going to
[27:58] squeeze a little time in for brother
[28:00] Owen to meet with Billy Paul and he did
[28:02] after church and I got to meet Billy
[28:04] Paul in a room and uh talked to him 15
[28:08] minutes told him what I was wanted to do
[28:09] and asked if I could call him if I you
[28:13] know had a question for him and and then
[28:15] as gracious as Billy Paul is he said yes
[28:18] call me anytime and he was uh and he did
[28:21] supply some key bits of information now
[28:23] and then so I I don't know if brother if
[28:27] you remember that. But anyway, uh thank
[28:29] you very much for having some confidence
[28:32] in a young man with a dream. So, God
[28:34] bless you all.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Well, just one more item before we read
[28:47] the word. We had an in inspection of our
[28:51] school happens once every six years and
[28:55] two inspectors come in from the
[28:58] department of education, the government
[29:00] of British Columbia and they spent two
[29:03] days Monday and Tuesday. Uh, brother
[29:07] Randy Timberman's the uh, principal of
[29:10] the school has said that the
[29:12] representatives
[29:14] uh, were here for these two days and u,
[29:17] he said this is a very thorough
[29:19] inspection that occurs every six years.
[29:23] The last one completed was in 2002
[29:27] said, "I'm very pleased to pass on to
[29:29] you that BCA continues to meet all
[29:33] requirements of the Independent Schools
[29:35] Act." and he said that he wanted to in
[29:39] his letter to me to commend the
[29:40] teachers. But I want to commend uh
[29:44] brother Randy Timberman's as principal
[29:47] and all of the teachers and all of the
[29:52] volunteers
[29:54] and the students
[29:56] and everyone who has had something to do
[29:59] and those of you that have supported the
[30:01] school. that support has increased as
[30:05] far as physical presence of the people.
[30:08] Uh we are having of course uh there are
[30:13] there are parents who would like to send
[30:15] their children uh but are perhaps unable
[30:18] to pay tuition. So we're thankful for
[30:20] those that have sponsored still have
[30:23] need of some that can sponsor because
[30:26] we've come into some difficult times.
[30:28] And if you're able to do something along
[30:30] that line, any contribution would be
[30:33] very very much appreciated. I can tell
[30:36] you one thing,
[30:38] and I am absolutely convinced of this.
[30:40] On the other side,
[30:43] those of you that have had your children
[30:45] in the school will never regret
[30:49] that they heard what they heard in the
[30:51] school, and you'll never regret that
[30:54] they missed hearing what they would hear
[30:56] in the public school. Right. Amen.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; You'll never regret.
[31:03] I regret some of the things that I've
[31:06] been exposed to in the world. And I
[31:08] think it's a marvelous thing that these
[31:12] young people and these children. Now, I
[31:15] realize that not all from the church are
[31:17] able to be there. And there are many
[31:19] that are in distant places and across in
[31:22] different countries. There are some that
[31:24] have moved around the world.
[31:27] to have their children in this school.
[31:30] And I say, God bless you. And those of
[31:32] you that have had a difficult time
[31:35] financially, but you've kept your
[31:37] children in the school, I say, God bless
[31:40] you. Because if I had the option of
[31:44] having my children in an environment
[31:47] with ungodly teachers, teachers that
[31:50] know nothing about God, or having them
[31:53] in this school, it's not even a
[31:55] decision. That's right.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Some of you are quiet and you shouldn't
[32:00] be quiet. You ought to be saying,
[32:02] "Thanks be to God that we can have them
[32:05] in that kind of an environment." And the
[32:08] the uh inspectors come with three
[32:12] different
[32:13] uh aspects of their uh inspection and
[32:17] the number one is commendations. That is
[32:21] good things that they can say. The
[32:24] second segment is suggestions that they
[32:28] may have for improving the school. And
[32:32] the third is items requiring immediate
[32:35] attention. And after two days, they
[32:39] never had one item that needed further
[32:43] or immediate attention. Their
[32:46] commendations
[32:49] commending the school and the class, the
[32:52] teachers, the staff, the student body
[32:56] said they noticed a very strong
[32:58] correlation between BCA and our faith.
[33:03] They commented commented on how it was
[33:07] evident in the classrooms that our faith
[33:10] was the root of our program.
[33:13] Isn't
[33:13] &gt;&gt; that wonderful? Praise the Lord.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; They commented that our children are
[33:18] very happy and engaged in their
[33:21] learning. And when asked what they liked
[33:24] about BCA, our students said things
[33:26] like, "No bad language
[33:30] and teachers that care about us."
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; They liked how our school expectations
[33:36] were clear and noted how this spoke to
[33:39] our school culture. They stated how they
[33:42] detected a strong shared commitment from
[33:45] all the staff. They appreciated our
[33:48] motivation to the future and our desire
[33:51] to improve our school with its programs
[33:54] and they were encouraged by our
[33:56] motivation
[33:58] and they made special comment on the
[34:00] quality of our school policy and the
[34:02] documents and the filing systems etc.
[34:06] They were impressed with the quality of
[34:08] the equipment and they were also
[34:11] impressed with the fact that we did as
[34:13] much as we did with as little finances
[34:15] as we had. They thought that that was
[34:18] excellent. And they said that BCA
[34:22] they said how uh what a welcome and
[34:25] comfortable
[34:27] uh feeling that they had and they felt
[34:31] at the school and they were so well and
[34:33] warmly received which is not always the
[34:36] case. They even went on to say that one
[34:39] of the programs that has been instituted
[34:42] by the school, they would like to take
[34:44] it to other schools throughout this
[34:46] entire region as an example.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; I thought that this was remarkable.
[34:55] Now, you know what that is? You'll
[34:57] understand it better by and by in about
[34:59] the next hour or so as I speak to you
[35:02] about we are the light
[35:06] of the world. And even when you don't
[35:09] realize that you are shedding forth
[35:11] light,
[35:13] you are doing so. I'd like you to stand
[35:16] if you would with me.
[35:18] And uh
[35:23] you know I don't think it's out of
[35:25] place. I think that our godly teachers
[35:28] along with our principal brother Randy
[35:31] and all the volunteers and all of the
[35:34] parents and all that are part and parcel
[35:37] of this assembly. I think we should give
[35:40] our our our our people and our staff a
[35:43] good hand.
[35:44] [Music]
[36:01] See, I fully expect that if time should
[36:04] go on,
[36:06] those that are there as young ones,
[36:09] they're going to be sitting where you're
[36:10] sitting. They're going to be taking
[36:12] places of responsibility.
[36:14] And I'm very very thankful that
[36:19] we're able to have this kind of a school
[36:22] in this day that we're in. Amen.
[36:27] Let's just have a word of prayer.
[36:30] Father, I'm standing here today
[36:35] feeling humbled in your presence,
[36:39] asking that you will do something
[36:41] special
[36:43] for all that have gathered today.
[36:46] Such a variety of needs,
[36:50] such a variety of backgrounds,
[36:53] such a variety of thoughts. And so I'm
[36:57] asking, oh Holy Spirit, that you will
[36:59] come now and command every thought to
[37:02] come into subjection to the plan and
[37:05] will of almighty God. Oh God of light
[37:09] and God of life, God and author, father
[37:12] of our Lord Jesus Christ, author of
[37:15] salvation, author of redemption, who has
[37:19] brought this great plan and you put it
[37:22] into operation. Thank you for the
[37:24] message that you've sent. A faithful
[37:26] messenger that would not he would not be
[37:29] be deterred. He would not uh be
[37:32] sidetracked. But oh God, you kept him to
[37:36] bring it so accurately and so precisely.
[37:40] Give us understanding today, Lord. How
[37:42] we need understanding of the Holy
[37:45] Spirit. I pray that you will give us a
[37:48] heart and a desire that will follow
[37:51] follow your word with purpose with
[37:53] resolve. And today, Lord, I pray that
[37:55] you will functionize. You see what's in
[37:57] my heart, oh God, and may it be
[37:59] delivered by the Holy Spirit down into
[38:03] the heart and into the deep recesses. I
[38:05] pray of every living person here today.
[38:08] And Father, now I give myself
[38:10] unreservedly to you. I pray that the
[38:13] people will receive father the moving of
[38:16] the Holy Spirit that they may be fully
[38:18] yielded. Lord, we don't want any
[38:20] resistance to the Holy Spirit. I pray
[38:23] that they'll be re yielded to you. All
[38:25] that are listening and ever will listen,
[38:27] I ask that you'll confirm your word in
[38:30] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. And all
[38:34] the people said, "Amen." Hallelujah.
[38:38] I was going to sing a course, but we
[38:40] don't need to. Oh, thank you, Jonathan.
[38:44] I'm going to read if you would please in
[38:46] Genesis the first chapter.
[38:51] Reading verses 1 through 4.
[38:57] In the beginning, God created the heaven
[39:00] and the earth.
[39:02] And the earth was without form and void,
[39:06] and darkness was upon the face of the
[39:08] deep. And the spirit of God moved upon
[39:11] the face of the waters. And God said,
[39:14] "Let there be light." And there was
[39:17] light. And God saw the light that it was
[39:20] good. And God divided the light from the
[39:24] darkness.
[39:26] Amen. You may be seated.
[39:29] Keep your Bibles at the ready if you
[39:30] would please because we have other
[39:33] scriptures I want to read. Now I'm going
[39:36] to ask for your very very keen attention
[39:41] and uh I want to try to convey some
[39:44] thought to you. I think that it's it's
[39:47] uh more important than we can possibly
[39:52] grasp
[39:54] the the fact the principle
[39:58] that the message which God sent to us at
[40:02] this time
[40:04] is a progressive it's a progressive
[40:07] message. And so every once in a while
[40:10] it's important that we have like an
[40:12] overview.
[40:14] So many that are in the message fail to
[40:16] grasp that God was literally moving
[40:22] moving through time if we have to say a
[40:26] timeline of the message. He's moving
[40:29] through time in our day with the word as
[40:34] it was unfolded and as it was fulfilled
[40:37] and various scriptures that were
[40:39] fulfilled. It's important to see it uh
[40:43] moving in that direction so that we can
[40:46] because uh you know uh scriptures can be
[40:49] taken completely out of context for
[40:51] example and we could be looking for
[40:53] something to be fulfilled that has been
[40:55] fulfilled
[40:57] and that's why brother Brandham says
[40:58] they'll be looking for Elijah and he's
[41:00] already come. They'll be looking for a
[41:02] rapture and it's already come. And so
[41:05] those scriptures cannot be fulfilled
[41:07] again if they have been fulfilled. Not
[41:10] saying they have, but if they have been
[41:12] fulfilled, Malachi 4 has been fulfilled.
[41:16] Malachi 3 has been fulfilled. It's not
[41:19] going to be fulfilled again. Malachi 4
[41:22] is not going to be fulfilled again. All
[41:24] the scriptures concerning Christ,
[41:26] Calvary, his life, his death, his
[41:28] resurrection have been fulfilled.
[41:30] they're not going to be fulfilled again.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Understand?
[41:34] &gt;&gt; And so there are scriptures concerning
[41:36] our time. And that's why it's so so very
[41:40] very important for us to uh to
[41:43] understand that this message is not just
[41:46] a series of books or some tapes or discs
[41:48] or whatever more MP3s whatever you have
[41:51] to listen to and and to to be casual
[41:54] about it because there are things this
[41:56] is a message for this day that came for
[41:59] this hour to be fulfilled in this time
[42:02] and to do specific things at this time.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'd like to just take a
[42:08] sequence, a little sequence, a little
[42:10] overview please, of the dividing of
[42:13] light from darkness in our day because
[42:17] this what I would like to move forward
[42:18] to and uh uh a as I as I make my way
[42:24] through the message. But this this is
[42:26] just a rather an introduction the
[42:30] sequence of dividing of light from
[42:32] darkness in our day to bring forth
[42:36] our Eden. And I would like to speak on
[42:38] the light of Eden.
[42:43] The living word is a moving force. Do
[42:47] you believe that?
[42:49] It's alive with eternal life
[42:53] and it's moving forward even at this
[42:55] moment while we sit here.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; To fulfill the purpose of God's will.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I've got quite a number of
[43:05] quotes and I'm just going to take
[43:06] certain phrases out of the quotes. In
[43:08] God's provided way of dealing with sin,
[43:12] this is 1954
[43:15] and I don't often give the dates, but
[43:17] it's important. I'm going to give you
[43:18] the dates because I'm I'm speaking of a
[43:20] timeline. So 1954.
[43:23] Now here's a prophet to a generation.
[43:27] So he's got to say certain things at
[43:29] certain times and then different things
[43:32] at other times. So he says in 1954,
[43:37] always before daylight it's the darkest.
[43:40] It's always darkest just before the
[43:42] break of day. It's because
[43:46] the light is oppressing
[43:49] and condensing the darkness. And that is
[43:53] at the time it that is at that time that
[43:56] the morning star comes out.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Now, some people might just take that as
[44:02] a phrase. That's not just a nice little
[44:03] phrase. He's saying something to the
[44:05] people. He's announcing something to the
[44:08] people that and he just takes it from
[44:10] the phrasing phraseology that people
[44:13] understand the darkest hour is before
[44:15] the dawn. But he's saying and he's
[44:17] bringing it down to the people. That's
[44:19] what's taking place because and the
[44:22] reason that happens is because the light
[44:24] is pressing the darkness and condensing
[44:27] the darkness. And at that's that time
[44:30] that the morning star comes out.
[44:34] Now then the next year 1955
[44:38] in the message beginning ending of the
[44:40] the beginning and ending of the gentile
[44:42] dispensation please notice the message
[44:47] we see the darkness gathering now
[44:51] what is its light pressing against the
[44:55] darkness
[44:56] one has to give way
[44:59] all the creeping things that's been
[45:01] running through the night when that sun
[45:04] comes up they take to shelter when the
[45:08] light shines.
[45:11] Night dark
[45:13] and light cannot exist at the same time
[45:16] or the same building.
[45:18] It's either dark or it's light.
[45:21] And he says another place
[45:25] referring to God's presence. He said God
[45:27] is here like the light is here. says,
[45:30] "The light on my hand." And the two
[45:33] cannot
[45:35] exist at the same time.
[45:38] Regardless of how dark it might be in
[45:41] this room or in this building or at any
[45:43] place, as soon as light comes, it
[45:46] presses the darkness and banishes it.
[45:50] And darkness cannot exist where light
[45:53] is.
[45:55] in questions and answers in the Hebrews
[45:57] now into 1957.
[46:00] So we've gone seven years now uh I'm
[46:03] sorry 54 to 57 3 years
[46:07] he said you're born in the world and you
[46:09] come by a nature and your whole being is
[46:13] black and smutty and damned and cursed
[46:15] and going to hell.
[46:18] He said that's right.
[46:20] But when you're born again, then the
[46:23] light of God shines down into that soul.
[46:26] Hallelujah.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; And then it's no more dark. It's no more
[46:31] a dark valley, but it's a valley with a
[46:34] shadow in it. And number of times he
[46:36] went through the scripture to to show to
[46:39] the people that Psalms 23 is quoted
[46:42] improperly,
[46:44] calling it a a dark valley. No, he said
[46:47] it's a valley with a shadow in it. And
[46:51] he said, "You may be veiled here in the
[46:55] flesh and with things known by faith,
[46:59] but there's enough light in there and
[47:02] someday
[47:03] that light and darkness has to separate.
[47:07] And when the light shines, darkness
[47:10] flees." And when we go to be with Christ
[47:13] in that body, darkness and death
[47:15] vanishes and we burst into perfect
[47:18] light. Glory to God. There we are. No
[47:21] more sickness, no more dark mixed with
[47:24] it.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; 1958, now we come to my redeemer liveth.
[47:30] He said, in this great darkness that's
[47:32] swinging over the earth now is nothing
[47:36] but to declare that light is pressing
[47:40] its way down. Amen.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Then in ' 64 and shalom. Now we've gone
[47:46] from we've gone a full 10 years from 54
[47:49] to 64.
[47:52] The hour is upon us.
[47:55] [Music]
[47:57] Darkness, gross darkness
[48:00] is on the people now.
[48:04] That's what it is. What does all of this
[48:07] what does it all mean?
[48:10] Where are we standing?
[48:13] What hour are we in?
[48:17] How close are we to the coming? If
[48:20] you're not little flock, it's the
[48:21] father's good pleasure to give you the
[48:23] kingdom.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "What does it mean?
[48:28] God has begun
[48:31] to separate the light from the
[48:33] darkness."
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. pressing it behind like he
[48:38] did in the beginning to show the dawn of
[48:42] a new day. The church ages are fading
[48:46] out. God is pressing the darkness into a
[48:50] place. It has to do it to fade out the
[48:53] church organizations. See how he united
[48:56] the two together and fade out the world.
[48:59] The world is covering the thing over and
[49:03] worldly ism has took the whole thing.
[49:06] Then isn't God right by worldly things
[49:09] and worldly dressing and worldly acting
[49:11] and worldly living? It's the world and
[49:14] ye are not of the world. Little
[49:16] children,
[49:18] &gt;&gt; you are of heaven.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; This is not your home.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Spoke of the bright. Now this is just
[49:26] the overview. spoke of the bright and
[49:28] morning star in the man running from the
[49:31] presence which is in 1965 last last year
[49:37] brother Brandham was with us and many he
[49:39] said many I baptized
[49:43] that evening speaking of the time he was
[49:47] baptizing at the Ohio River
[49:50] he says and when they stood there when
[49:53] they stood there and witnessed that
[49:55] morning star
[49:57] coming down. Now notice that morning
[50:00] star, not the evening star, but the
[50:02] morning star coming down out of the
[50:06] heavens, cir circling around like that
[50:09] and said, "As John the Baptist was sent
[50:13] to bring forth
[50:15] to forrun the first coming of Christ,
[50:18] your message will forrun the second
[50:21] coming,"
[50:22] &gt;&gt; the morning star
[50:25] descending
[50:26] &gt;&gt; and making this kind of a a statement.
[50:29] Then in harvest time, staying on the
[50:31] thought of morning star for a moment,
[50:35] Jesus is that morning star,
[50:37] &gt;&gt; the brightest of all of them.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; But we find him in Revelation 1 with
[50:43] seven stars in his hand. He interprets
[50:46] that and said, "These seven stars are
[50:49] the seven angels to the seven churches
[50:52] or the seven church ages that's coming."
[50:55] Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; The stars that were in his hand were
[50:59] only the reflection stars from the
[51:01] morning star.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; You have to understand that the light
[51:05] the light of the messengers the light of
[51:09] the messenger of this age is morning
[51:11] star light.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; There is no light. He is that light.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Any light that you and I have is morning
[51:19] star light.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; It's his light. It's the light of God.
[51:23] And that's why the scripture can say,
[51:25] "You are light.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; You're children of light.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; You're not of the darkness.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; We're not of the world.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; But we are in a place of shadows.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Many shadows. And perhaps too many in
[51:39] the message live in under more shadows
[51:42] than they need to."
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; So the stars were in his hand and were
[51:48] only the reflection stars from the
[51:50] morning star. For the messenger of that
[51:53] of that day had the word and he and he
[51:57] is the word.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; He just had the portion for that day.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; And the people that's ready to come away
[52:06] from the world systems and world things
[52:09] and walk with him sees the reflection of
[52:13] the morning star through the messenger
[52:15] of that age.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; That's what we see. That's what we have
[52:22] followed.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; That is the light.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; And finally, he says they will arrive to
[52:30] one.
[52:31] And so will all so will it at the end of
[52:35] the church age. It will all arrive back
[52:38] to Jesus.
[52:40] That he is the word. We as Christians
[52:44] are only reflecting him.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The light is the morning star
[52:49] light. And that morning star light came
[52:53] down saying that there will be a message
[52:55] that will forerun the second coming of
[52:59] this light.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; And then in shalom and this is the last
[53:06] before I enter the rest of
[53:09] message proper. The hour is upon us.
[53:13] Darkness, gross darkness, gross darkness
[53:15] on the people.
[53:18] And what does it mean? Where are we
[53:21] standing? I know I'm repeating it.
[53:24] What hour are we in? How close are we to
[53:27] the coming? And here's the phrase I want
[53:30] you to bear in mind. God has begun to
[53:35] separate the light from the darkness,
[53:38] pressing it behind like he did in the
[53:42] beginning to show the dawn of a new day.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; I see the dawn of a new day.
[54:03] Maybe I'll show you these.
[54:12] And the spirit of God moved upon the
[54:14] face of the water and said, "Let there
[54:17] be light." And God separated the light
[54:20] from the darkness.
[54:23] And I believe that we are now living in
[54:25] that hour again. that when God is
[54:28] separating light from darkness and he's
[54:31] pressing it to the other side of the
[54:33] world that the light might be made
[54:36] manifest.
[54:39] Arise and shine for the glory of God has
[54:42] come upon you. The light is here. And
[54:46] then the very next verse says gross
[54:48] darkness is upon the people. And then
[54:52] when we are in a mixtury of light and
[54:55] darkness and then my address uh my
[54:58] address to the church is shalom peace.
[55:02] He's speaking that in the midst of
[55:04] mixtury of light and darkness. The world
[55:07] is in one of the most chaotic times of
[55:10] darkness that it has ever stood in. And
[55:12] yet it's standing in again the most
[55:15] blessed light that that light that it
[55:18] ever shined in. The gross darkness upon
[55:22] the people is represented in the life
[55:26] that they live. That's my statement that
[55:30] it's represented by the life they live.
[55:32] And then pro prophet goes on to say the
[55:34] reason I'd say shalom to them is because
[55:37] that it's God's peace. We're looking
[55:40] forward to the breaking of a new day
[55:43] until there is something great laying
[55:45] ahead of us. where the years has been
[55:48] the joy that we've looked forward to,
[55:51] the pressing coming of the great light.
[55:56] And now we can see it breaking over the
[56:00] horizontal realm, breaking between
[56:03] mortal and immortality.
[56:06] We see it breaking between heavens and
[56:08] earth, from an earthbound sickness and
[56:12] troubled world unto a bright shining day
[56:15] of an immortal life and an immortal body
[56:18] and an immortal earth that can never
[56:22] pass away.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; It's shalom unto the church. Now it's
[56:26] light time coming for the believers, but
[56:30] a gross darkness for the people.
[56:35] Hallelujah.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; I had a beautiful
[56:40] dawning background to some of these
[56:44] because it was in the rising of the sun
[56:47] that he made such grand announcements
[56:51] of the first the first breaking in this
[56:56] I I'll read this for you and this
[56:59] service will be different I'm quite
[57:02] sure. He said, 'Now the sun at this
[57:04] rising that was at the very beginning
[57:07] when God said let there be light and God
[57:12] saw the light that it was good and
[57:14] divided the light from the darkness. He
[57:17] says, "Now the sun at this rising of the
[57:19] sun," he says, "well there was a time
[57:22] when the world was laying in utter
[57:24] darkness.
[57:25] It was without form and was void and it
[57:28] was all covered with water and was
[57:31] laying there in dark, dismal, gloomy
[57:33] atmosphere. And the spirit of God moved
[57:36] upon that water and said, "Let there be
[57:38] light."
[57:40] God had a reason for that.
[57:43] For down beneath the water there was
[57:46] seeds that he had planted and it had to
[57:49] have the that sunlight to make it live.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; And the first light was ever given to
[57:54] the earth was God's spoken word.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; The first light that ever struck the
[58:00] earth was God's spoken word.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let there be light." And there
[58:06] was light that turned darkness into
[58:09] light in order to bring forth a creation
[58:11] of joy and life upon the earth. The
[58:15] reason why I'm feeling
[58:18] something that you're not able to feel
[58:20] right now is because my wife and I were
[58:23] sitting as the prophet spoke these
[58:25] words.
[58:27] And immediately following that, we went
[58:30] to the baptismal tank. And I will say to
[58:33] you as a congregation, as I pondered
[58:35] this morning and prayed this morning
[58:37] early,
[58:40] we were those
[58:43] that were walking in the darkness of
[58:45] confusion.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Hearing uh hearing ministry, God's one.
[58:51] No, God's two. No, God's three. We
[58:54] didn't know how to believe God. hearing.
[58:58] Oh, you're baptized this way. You
[58:59] baptize forward. You baptize backwards.
[59:02] You baptize in the titles. You baptize
[59:04] in Jesus only. You baptize. Utter
[59:06] confusion. Confusion happens to be
[59:08] darkness.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Question and doubt happens to be
[59:13] darkness.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Sickness happens to be darkness.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; This world outside these doors happens
[59:21] to be darkness. Amen.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; And we were in utter darkness.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; We were in church.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; I was preaching, believe it or not. But
[59:33] I say clearly, you cannot preach from a
[59:36] position of light if you're walking in
[59:38] darkness. And we didn't know because we
[59:41] didn't know, but we had sincerity. But
[59:44] I'm so thankful today that God said,
[59:48] "Let there be light." Amen.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; And he said that because he had a
[59:54] purpose because down in this earth
[59:58] &gt;&gt; was a seed
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; that had to come forth.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; And what a blessed moment it was when we
[1:00:06] came up out of the water
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; to rise into a resurrection
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; of a new day
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; that God was giving witness to and
[1:00:14] testifying because this seed must come
[1:00:18] forth. And it can only come forth by the
[1:00:20] spoken word of God.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And it was God saying while a prophet
[1:00:25] spoke these words, "Let there be light."
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; And there was light.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; And we came into that light.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; And as I came out of the water and
[1:00:36] stepped into the little room, just a
[1:00:38] handful of people, not a whole lot of
[1:00:40] people. Sister Tammy Laroo's mother and
[1:00:42] dad were there. And and I think that she
[1:00:44] was there probably also with Debbie, her
[1:00:46] sister.
[1:00:48] my family and I got into the change room
[1:00:52] was
[1:00:54] a little larger than ours. And there was
[1:00:57] another man that had just been baptized.
[1:01:00] I didn't know him. I believe it was
[1:01:03] brother Willard Collins that baptized
[1:01:04] us. I'm not sure. I think it was. And I
[1:01:08] came and I stood in the corner
[1:01:11] and the sweetest,
[1:01:13] most glorious, wonderful, quiet, serene
[1:01:19] presence
[1:01:21] of a person
[1:01:23] surrounded me. And a voice
[1:01:27] so tender, so sweet said, "Your wife is
[1:01:32] experiencing this same thing at this
[1:01:35] moment.
[1:01:37] And when we stepped out and I met her, I
[1:01:40] said, "This is what happened." She said,
[1:01:42] "That's exactly what happened to me.
[1:01:48] Let there be light." And there was
[1:01:51] light.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; And I declare that light today,
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; not to shine merely in, but to cause you
[1:01:59] to be light.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; So that he could say, Jesus said, "You
[1:02:03] are the light of the world." We're not
[1:02:06] here to be uh uh we're not here to be uh
[1:02:09] a source of confusion. We're not here to
[1:02:12] be a source of of uh you know difficulty
[1:02:14] for people. We're here to declare the
[1:02:17] truth of the light of this message.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:02:23] so God divided the light from the
[1:02:26] darkness. You're going to have to really
[1:02:28] pray that I'll get somewhere today
[1:02:30] because I have I'll have to take it up
[1:02:32] probably in another service. Brother
[1:02:34] Lance is going to be speaking tonight,
[1:02:36] but I don't want him to be nervous about
[1:02:38] time where we got all the time in the
[1:02:40] world. This is the Lord's day.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; It's not our day.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; It's not a day to shop.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; It's not a day to do other things. It's
[1:02:53] the Lord's day.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; So, we give it to him.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I haven't won't be able to
[1:02:58] eat." Well, don't worry about it. Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; And God divided the light from the
[1:03:06] darkness which is that he he merely
[1:03:09] separated. We understand that word to
[1:03:11] make a distinction to make a difference.
[1:03:15] And I love the prophet's words. He
[1:03:17] pressed it to the other side. Light
[1:03:20] cannot remain and ruin will rain where
[1:03:24] uh darkness cannot reign where light is.
[1:03:28] Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; But now notice please
[1:03:34] when the light that light came and to
[1:03:37] bring a glorious life of light to bring
[1:03:41] life and to bring such beauty upon the
[1:03:45] earth and the final act of God having
[1:03:49] his own son and making him God over this
[1:03:53] creation
[1:03:55] giving him this position. And now the
[1:03:59] enemy of the almighty God, Lucifer,
[1:04:03] Satan,
[1:04:04] the old serpent, the devil, whoever you
[1:04:07] want to call him, is all the same
[1:04:09] person.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; He's the enemy. He's cunning.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; He's a slicker.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; He knows this Bible better than you do.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Don't try and get him with your
[1:04:22] intelligence. You'll never be able to do
[1:04:24] so.
[1:04:25] and he crept in under the garden wall
[1:04:30] where God had his children fortified by
[1:04:33] the word. He didn't creep in until the
[1:04:36] wife had been taken from the husband's
[1:04:39] side because she had the facility for
[1:04:42] seed. And he crept in and uh behind the
[1:04:46] garden wall and saw this masterpiece,
[1:04:51] this masterpiece family that God had for
[1:04:55] himself.
[1:04:57] And Satan found that masterpiece family.
[1:05:00] And without going into details because
[1:05:02] you understand it, he marred the family.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; In other words, he introduced darkness
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; to the highest form of life
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; that was on the earth
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; where God, he began with a physical
[1:05:19] light in a physical darkness and
[1:05:22] darkness covered the earth. God said,
[1:05:24] "Let there be light." And there was
[1:05:26] light and life came. And then it
[1:05:30] continued and it evolved to higher
[1:05:32] species, not through evolution, but
[1:05:34] through the evolution of God creating
[1:05:37] higher species until he had his son. And
[1:05:40] he looked on it and he said, "It's good.
[1:05:42] It's very good."
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us that he created
[1:05:47] all these things for his pleasure and
[1:05:50] for his pleasure. Were they created?
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; God enjoys his creation. And
[1:05:55] furthermore, the scripture says that
[1:05:57] God's going to destroy them who destroy
[1:05:59] the earth.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; This is his handiwork. He loves it.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want the creation denuted. He
[1:06:09] doesn't want mankind. He doesn't even
[1:06:11] take pleasure in the death of the
[1:06:12] wicked.
[1:06:14] He doesn't take pleasure in the fact
[1:06:16] that they're strewn over the highways
[1:06:18] because of alcohol and drunkenness and
[1:06:20] and all of the uh alcoh the drugs and
[1:06:24] whatever more. God doesn't take pleasure
[1:06:26] in that. God doesn't take pleasure that
[1:06:28] our prisons are bursting at the seams
[1:06:31] and the hospitals don't have beds. God
[1:06:33] doesn't take pleasure in that.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; That's why God sent healing. That's why
[1:06:42] he sent deliverance. God doesn't take
[1:06:44] pleasure in the acts of darkness.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; He takes pleasure in light.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; And in the midst of Eden's perfect light
[1:06:57] crept the enemy and introduced darkness
[1:07:00] once again. Only this was not a physical
[1:07:03] darkness. This was a spiritual darkness.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; And he began to bring this darkness.
[1:07:09] And the prophet said in broken sistns
[1:07:11] just to break one word plunge the human
[1:07:14] race into the into a darkness of death.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Sickness is darkness.
[1:07:22] Diseases are dark is darkness.
[1:07:25] All mental orders is darkness.
[1:07:29] They got all kinds of phrases today. He
[1:07:31] said you call it cancer. But he said
[1:07:33] it's a devil.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; I say that cancer is darkness.
[1:07:46] speaks of a woman extremely nervous
[1:07:48] because she's shattered by death. He
[1:07:50] said that's a tumor that's malignant
[1:07:54] and that between you and I stands light
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; life and light.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. That same one that
[1:08:06] stood between that woman and that
[1:08:08] prophet, that same one is here present
[1:08:10] today, closer to you than your breath
[1:08:13] is.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; If we don't believe it, we shouldn't be
[1:08:19] here.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; That's the one we come to honor.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; That's this morning star.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; That's this one who came to dispel the
[1:08:28] darkness.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; And there's plenty of it.
[1:08:32] It's gross darkness upon the people.
[1:08:35] Arise, shine. Your light has come.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Let us be certain we walk in the light.
[1:08:42] Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; The darkness of religion, the darkness
[1:08:47] of creed and in the message, the
[1:08:51] darkness of merely going to church.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; The darkness of merely having a
[1:08:57] profession, empty profession
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; without feeling the sense. And I'm sure
[1:09:02] our Lord Jesus Christ coming uh amongst
[1:09:06] the people because he he loves to come
[1:09:08] to be honored, to be worshiped. God is
[1:09:11] in this place. I was going to sing.
[1:09:13] We're standing on holy ground. Oh, if
[1:09:15] you only knew how holy it is.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; We are standing on holy ground. And
[1:09:20] there's angels all around. I believe
[1:09:23] that.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; That has to be my anchor.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; I believe that with everything that's in
[1:09:28] me. If I didn't, I wouldn't even study
[1:09:30] this Bible. I wouldn't come here to
[1:09:31] preach. I wouldn't exhaust myself unless
[1:09:34] I believe that this God is present here
[1:09:37] now. He's the one who spoke back there.
[1:09:40] He's the one. And I can say a great
[1:09:42] light has dawned upon my own soul. And
[1:09:47] that's my testimony. This message
[1:09:49] brought more light. Oh, I revel in the
[1:09:53] light of the word.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; It's my love, my joy.
[1:09:58] Hallelujah. When all the rest of the
[1:10:00] world goes gives way, he is my He's my
[1:10:05] anchor, my satisfying portion.
[1:10:10] Amen.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Religion is full of darkness
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; even amongst believers. As I said a
[1:10:19] moment ago, it's amazing.
[1:10:22] Got a call
[1:10:24] just yesterday
[1:10:30] from far away
[1:10:33] asking some question about the message.
[1:10:38] It was so simple.
[1:10:43] I said sometime I'd like to get asked a
[1:10:45] question that had some depth to it.
[1:10:49] Like, can we do this?
[1:10:51] Can we dress this way?
[1:10:54] Or can we go to this kind of an event or
[1:10:57] this kind of a place? You know what I
[1:10:58] say? Grow up.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; It's time to grow up.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:09] Why do we take the message to begin
[1:11:11] with? If there is a question, don't do
[1:11:12] it.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't that simple?
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, so many times we don't want to go
[1:11:18] there. But if there is a question, just
[1:11:20] don't do it.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Go on the safe side.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; So darkness. Brother Brandham talks
[1:11:28] about the darkness of and I took quite a
[1:11:30] few of the remarks that he had made, but
[1:11:32] I won't have time to give them all. But
[1:11:34] he talks about the darkness of hope. So,
[1:11:37] and maybe so and we trust it'll be that
[1:11:40] way.
[1:11:43] Well, you say, "Well, I hope so." Well,
[1:11:46] maybe so. Or we trust it'll be that way.
[1:11:50] And now you have a brand. Now you have
[1:11:52] the title for that.
[1:11:54] Prophet called that darkness. Right.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Hey, we really need to put a the light
[1:12:00] of the word upon
[1:12:04] our whole realm of
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; our whole realm of being, our whole
[1:12:08] realm of life.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul said, "For we wrestle
[1:12:13] not against flesh and blood, but against
[1:12:16] principalities and against powers." We
[1:12:19] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[1:12:20] against principalities,
[1:12:23] against powers, against the rulers of
[1:12:26] the darkness of this world, against the
[1:12:30] rulers of the darkness of this world.
[1:12:34] So, we're not here merely resisting
[1:12:36] darkness. Our wrestling is against the
[1:12:39] rulers of the darkness.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Are you here? Are you ready to rise to
[1:12:46] this challenge? In case you haven't
[1:12:48] thought of it before, God through the
[1:12:51] Apostle Paul is saying that we
[1:12:54] I'll put it another way. Rather than
[1:12:56] saying we wrestle not, I say we do
[1:12:58] wrestle.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; We wrestle against the rulers
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; of the darkness
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; of this world. Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Whenever I see anything that even
[1:13:08] afflicts a assembly or afflicts a family
[1:13:11] or an individual, young person uh uh
[1:13:14] whatever it is or my own life, I always
[1:13:17] look behind the scenes at that spirit
[1:13:21] that's trying to uh promote this thing,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; promote this thought, promote this fear,
[1:13:28] promote this depression. Those of you
[1:13:30] that are here and you live a depressed
[1:13:33] life and let the doctor tell you you're
[1:13:35] manic depressant. You need to look
[1:13:37] beyond that pill, you need to look
[1:13:40] beyond the thought that brings it. You
[1:13:42] need to look to the ruler
[1:13:44] [Applause]
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; of that thing
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; and you need to do wrestling match with
[1:13:50] the ruler with the spirit of that thing.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; We're not against doctors. We're not
[1:13:59] against hospitals. I thank God for them.
[1:14:02] But the sickness, the prophet said, "You
[1:14:04] call it cancer, but it's a devil." And
[1:14:08] our problem with many times when we're
[1:14:10] praying for sickness and praying for
[1:14:12] healing and praying for things, we don't
[1:14:14] get to the root of the problem. We don't
[1:14:16] deal with the ruler of that thing.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; I tell you ought to pull the covers off.
[1:14:22] Amen.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Now, sister who may be sitting listening
[1:14:28] to me today, who I counsel with
[1:14:30] recently, it's not, you know, he said or
[1:14:33] they said or I did or they did or
[1:14:35] something else. It's who's behind the
[1:14:37] thing,
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; who's promoting the thing?
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; You find out it's a spirit.
[1:14:50] It's a spirit
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; say well we have this kind of a
[1:14:54] situation that arose
[1:14:56] in our family or whatever more in our
[1:14:59] life. You should you must not just
[1:15:03] identify it with the with the
[1:15:05] circumstance of here's what happened.
[1:15:09] as I flew once about 3,000 miles to pray
[1:15:13] for a woman who was in a dire sick
[1:15:17] condition in a hospital and I came into
[1:15:20] the hospital and and she was just like a
[1:15:22] nervous conversation started to tell the
[1:15:25] doctors came they did this examination
[1:15:26] inserted this and that and had this
[1:15:28] x-ray and went on and on and on and I
[1:15:30] listened and listened listened even even
[1:15:33] I was becoming weak listening
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; and I said to her are you son.
[1:15:42] I said, "Now you've told me what the
[1:15:44] doctors have said. Now I'll tell you why
[1:15:46] I'm here to pray for you."
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; All of those things. Well, that's fine.
[1:15:53] See, you could relate all of those
[1:15:55] things, but don't forget none of those
[1:15:57] things could bring healing in the sense
[1:16:00] of the the healing that I'm talking
[1:16:02] about. I'm talking about the healing
[1:16:03] that comes from light.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Faith is light. Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Doubt is darkness.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; And these other things might be as a as
[1:16:12] a prophet speaks of also and we're well
[1:16:15] acquainted with. There is artificial
[1:16:17] light.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; There is reflected light.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; There's the light of a candle, the light
[1:16:22] of a fire. There's laser light. There's
[1:16:24] various kinds of light for different
[1:16:26] purposes. We have light here which is
[1:16:29] electricity. We've learned how to
[1:16:31] control that light. God gave us this
[1:16:34] light.
[1:16:36] We are simply managing the light.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; We have to learn also how to control the
[1:16:45] light.
[1:16:47] Amen.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you know the answer right
[1:16:53] away, but you can't it's you can't say
[1:16:56] it right away. But this I cannot
[1:16:59] emphasize if I took from now till the
[1:17:00] rest of this service on this one thing
[1:17:03] that we wrestle against the rulers of
[1:17:07] the darkness because I can tell you that
[1:17:10] whatever afflicts you as a believer,
[1:17:13] whatever afflicts you as a believer is
[1:17:17] from the kingdom of darkness. And
[1:17:19] there's various shades of shadow that
[1:17:22] may come and and and afflict us because
[1:17:26] we're in this world and we're born in
[1:17:28] this flesh. But that does not say that
[1:17:31] that nature that came with our birth is
[1:17:35] to control this life. I want to declare
[1:17:38] it's not here to control this life.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; I defy the enemy that tries to say that.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Well, this is the way I was born. this
[1:17:46] is the way. This is just the way I am.
[1:17:48] Well, then if if if that you're
[1:17:50] continuing in that, you need to be born
[1:17:52] again,
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; born of the spirit
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; and born of the word,
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; and this is the source of light.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; God said, "Let there be."
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; It was God that said, "Behold, I send
[1:18:06] you Elijah the prophet." That happens to
[1:18:09] be light
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; to this generation.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; That's not darkness. That's light. Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; He said that when the God moved
[1:18:25] with compassion
[1:18:28] on the earth and made an atmosphere
[1:18:30] above and for its first time to bring
[1:18:33] joy and life to the earth by a seed that
[1:18:37] was he said that was a great hour but oh
[1:18:41] it wasn't nothing that sunrise like the
[1:18:44] sunrise on that Easter morning.
[1:18:47] This time with the sun leaping into the
[1:18:49] skies, it brought forth a greater
[1:18:52] sunrise than ever because it came
[1:18:55] greater news with the sunrise than it
[1:18:58] did at the sunrise at the beginning.
[1:19:01] There's a greater news than the one that
[1:19:02] said, "Let there be light."
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; This sunrise brought a news that he is
[1:19:08] risen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; He is quickened from the dead
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; as he promised. He is risen from the
[1:19:14] dead.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; This sunrise brought a different kind of
[1:19:20] a statement. It brought this kind of a
[1:19:23] statement. And because I live, you shall
[1:19:26] live also.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; That first sunrise didn't say that. But
[1:19:34] this sunrise did. The sen rise.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And it's the sen that I'm speaking about
[1:19:39] in my own personal testimony. That's the
[1:19:42] son that rose.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; I don't feel we even had a message prior
[1:19:48] to that.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Now God separating light from darkness
[1:19:56] as he did in the beginning. He divided
[1:19:58] and made a line of demarcation between
[1:20:01] the light and the darkness and the sun
[1:20:03] to rule the day and the moon to rule the
[1:20:05] night and these lights in the sky. And
[1:20:08] then Satan came,
[1:20:11] crept under the wall as the prophet
[1:20:14] said, got to the weaker vessel,
[1:20:18] had her doubt the word
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; and darkness fell.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Cain hated Abel.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; It's darkness.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Adam also doubted.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; He was not deceived.
[1:20:38] and darkness fell.
[1:20:41] Such a heavy darkness and not not very
[1:20:44] long.
[1:20:46] And a man who had been given life by God
[1:20:49] and breath by God took an instrument or
[1:20:51] or his own physical strength and slew
[1:20:55] his brother Abel. And the Bible says his
[1:20:57] blood went to the ground
[1:21:01] and darkness
[1:21:03] engulfed
[1:21:05] the earth. once again only from a
[1:21:08] different source
[1:21:13] and the soul become darkened and the
[1:21:16] scripture says and tells us that Adam
[1:21:19] lost his way
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; and there's multitudes today and perhaps
[1:21:25] even in this church today which burdens
[1:21:27] me have lost their way. How do I find
[1:21:30] how do I get how do I get back to where
[1:21:32] I was? I'm preaching so you can find
[1:21:34] your way back. Hallelujah.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to declare to you the
[1:21:39] light is here. You don't need to walk in
[1:21:41] that any longer.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; You need You don't need to walk half in
[1:21:46] the world and half here. You don't need
[1:21:48] to walk with question your mind. The
[1:21:50] light is here.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; You don't have to have that situation.
[1:21:55] You don't have to tolerate it any
[1:21:57] longer.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:02] have the enemy bamboozle you and knock
[1:22:05] you around and and drag you down
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; and live defeated. You don't need that.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; He has no right to that. That's from the
[1:22:15] kingdom of darkness. I resent that and I
[1:22:18] resist that in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:22:21] for the purpose of this service. I
[1:22:23] resist that.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; I don't even need to ever hear from you
[1:22:27] that you had glorious. I want all the
[1:22:30] glory to go to God.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; If something happens, give God the
[1:22:34] glory.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; And God's been separating darkness from
[1:22:40] light ever since.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what he did. I must hurry
[1:22:44] along. But he was separating light from
[1:22:47] darkness by bringing Israel out of Egypt
[1:22:51] when he divided them. Divided this
[1:22:54] people, even many that failed in the
[1:22:56] end. But he divided them out of Egypt
[1:22:58] and took them out of bondage, out of
[1:23:00] darkness.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Bondage is darkness.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; You might just be bound by some simple
[1:23:10] thing.
[1:23:11] You might be bound by some pleasure.
[1:23:15] You might be bound by something in this
[1:23:17] world.
[1:23:19] You might have experienced some bondage.
[1:23:21] You might have some bondage of uh uh uh
[1:23:24] wi within your own character, within
[1:23:26] your own nature. I say you don't need to
[1:23:28] be bound to that any longer. And you
[1:23:31] must look forward to this service to be
[1:23:33] free from it. Do you hear me? In the
[1:23:37] name of Jesus Christ, I'm here to do
[1:23:39] warfare against the enemy. I'm here to
[1:23:42] announce to you, you are free because
[1:23:46] you're children of light. You're not
[1:23:48] children of darkness. that darkness has
[1:23:51] no right in your realm.
[1:23:54] [Applause]
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; I'm here to wrestle against the ruler,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; the prince of the power of the air.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; I'm here to take this word and cut him
[1:24:10] free and cut you free.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Bring an end to it.
[1:24:19] say, "This is over and out. I'm done."
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I give myself. I throw
[1:24:24] myself
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; completely.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; To our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; And God separated these people.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; And when he was taken, oh, we could read
[1:24:36] it as a story. Oh, he took the children
[1:24:37] of Israel out of Egypt. No, he was
[1:24:39] separating light from darkness.
[1:24:46] And then the scripture tells us
[1:24:57] spoke to the children of Israel through
[1:24:59] Moses and said, "I have said unto you,
[1:25:02] you shall inherit the land, and I will
[1:25:04] give it to you to possess it, a land
[1:25:07] that flowth with milk and honey."
[1:25:09] Let me tell you, my dear friends, from
[1:25:11] the very depths of my soul and all the
[1:25:14] energy I have in my body, if God would
[1:25:16] do that to a physical people on a
[1:25:18] physical land, that they would have a uh
[1:25:22] their orchard in their cities and
[1:25:24] whatever more physically, how much more
[1:25:26] is that pertaining to our time?
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; And God did not ask them, do you want
[1:25:31] it? He said, I said unto you, you shall
[1:25:33] inherit it.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; And I say unto you on the basis of this
[1:25:36] word, you shall inherit it.
[1:25:38] [Applause]
[1:25:40] It is yours
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; and I will give it unto you.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; You shall inherit it not because you're
[1:25:47] good, not because your preacher's good,
[1:25:49] not because anything else, but you shall
[1:25:51] inherit it because I will give it to
[1:25:53] you. He said,
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; I will give it to you. Give it to you
[1:26:02] for what? To play with. Give it to you
[1:26:04] so you have a tickle down your back. No,
[1:26:06] I will give it to you to possess it.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; This is your possession.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; This is not something where you just
[1:26:13] have a a visit and I'm just here for a
[1:26:15] short time. I'm here to I have a
[1:26:17] wonderful time this morning. Forget
[1:26:19] about that. Forget about that. Say, "The
[1:26:22] pastor preached today that I God has
[1:26:25] given this to me. He's given this
[1:26:26] deliverance to me. He's given me this
[1:26:28] freedom from this bondage. He's given it
[1:26:30] to me to possess it. It's mine.
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:36] and I will have it
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; because he has given it to me.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "I am the Lord your God which
[1:26:44] have separated you
[1:26:46] from other people.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; You didn't just stagger into this church
[1:26:53] on your own power.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; You've come from many, many different
[1:26:57] places or wherever you are today. You
[1:27:00] didn't stumble into the message by
[1:27:01] accident. It's by the divine call of
[1:27:04] almighty God who has a purpose in your
[1:27:07] life. And that purpose is that you
[1:27:08] become a reflector of that morning star
[1:27:11] that came down. Sent a messenger with
[1:27:13] that voice. And the messenger reflected
[1:27:15] his portion of the word. And now it's
[1:27:17] your turn.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; He's not coming back to reflect your
[1:27:23] part. You're going to reflect your part.
[1:27:26] Hallelujah. Every family reflects
[1:27:28] something.
[1:27:29] And you know, you don't even have to say
[1:27:31] anything.
[1:27:33] I want to I want to announce to you
[1:27:34] today and this is my absolute belief.
[1:27:38] Just by living your life every day in
[1:27:41] your community, in your area, wherever
[1:27:43] you are, just by living the life, the
[1:27:46] way that you perceive things, the way
[1:27:49] that you speak about things, the way you
[1:27:53] act, the way you drive your car,
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; the way you conduct yourself,
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; all speaks of light.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; You don't have to preach a sermon, but
[1:28:08] you are a sermon.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; It's light.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; You look different.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; You act different.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; And that's why it was so much on my
[1:28:20] mind, brother Randy,
[1:28:22] when uh inspectors came and heard
[1:28:25] brother John Andy speak because they
[1:28:28] were in chapel. So they heard the whole
[1:28:29] service, the whole chapel on the
[1:28:31] rapture. They never heard anything like
[1:28:34] that. and maybe never understood
[1:28:35] anything like that. But what was it?
[1:28:38] It's light.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; They're affected. They don't even know
[1:28:42] why they're affected.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; We come out into the morning. Don't you
[1:28:47] feel better when the sun is shining?
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Vancouver, right, Pacific
[1:28:53] Northwest, whatever you are, Bellingham,
[1:28:56] Seattle. Don't we feel better when the
[1:28:58] sun shines?
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's just something about it.
[1:29:00] Hear that, Lord?
[1:29:03] [Applause]
[1:29:05] Hallelujah.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; We love it.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; I love it when the sun shines.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; But this morning, while it may be gray
[1:29:14] outside, the sun is shining in this
[1:29:16] place. The light is here. I testify it
[1:29:20] because the messenger of God who the
[1:29:23] angel spoke to, who God spoke in a
[1:29:26] supernatural voice, your message will
[1:29:28] thorun the second coming of Christ the
[1:29:31] great light.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; No wonder the morning star had to
[1:29:35] introduce it.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And he said the morning star and the
[1:29:38] evening star the same star.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist and this and this
[1:29:43] Elijah this time and Elijah that time is
[1:29:45] the same spirit. And he says the spirit
[1:29:48] is the Holy Ghost. It's the spirit of
[1:29:50] Christ. It's not another person. It's
[1:29:52] the same person.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; He's the lily of the valley, the bright
[1:29:56] and morning star. That's him.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; He's the only one that has a source of
[1:30:00] light.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Everything else, every other star simply
[1:30:03] reflects that light.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And now we're walking in that light. Oh,
[1:30:08] hallelujah.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; And we become that light.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; We're reflectors of that light. We don't
[1:30:13] have any light of our own. Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; It's his light.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Glorious light.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Beautiful star Bethlehem. Shine on.
[1:30:23] Shine on. Shine on.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; The sun bringing forth the light of the
[1:30:34] world to press the darkness to the other
[1:30:37] side. You understand? Right from the
[1:30:39] very beginning when that darkness came
[1:30:41] into Eden,
[1:30:43] I can sees that where God
[1:30:47] deep within the recesses of that eternal
[1:30:50] being
[1:30:53] saying, "I'll press
[1:30:55] this darkness.
[1:30:57] I'll press it and I'll continue to press
[1:31:00] it. I have a plan
[1:31:03] of redemption.
[1:31:05] I'll call my elected
[1:31:08] and I'll banish this darkness from them
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; even unto death.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; I'll banish this darkness.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; And that's the whole program all the way
[1:31:21] through and I must follow along very
[1:31:23] quickly. And that is why in the
[1:31:24] beginning the Bible says John in John 1
[1:31:27] and one in the beginning was the word
[1:31:29] and the word was with God and the word
[1:31:31] was God. The same was in the beginning
[1:31:33] with God. All things were made by him,
[1:31:35] and without him was nothing made that
[1:31:37] was made. In him was life, and the life
[1:31:41] was what?
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; The light of men.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Say it again. The life was
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; the light of men.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; The light of humans.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; The life was the light.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; The light was striking the earth again.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; What for? to separate and press the
[1:32:03] darkness back.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; There never been a life like this life.
[1:32:07] There never was a man like this man.
[1:32:09] There never was one would say what he
[1:32:11] could say.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Never one could say my flesh is meat
[1:32:15] indeed and my blood is drink indeed.
[1:32:18] Never one could say
[1:32:22] I lay down my own life
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; and I take it up again.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; That was a morning star. Hallelujah.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; None could say, "I am the light of the
[1:32:32] world."
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; You know, the amazing thing, he said it
[1:32:35] twice in the scripture, and each time,
[1:32:40] the one time he said it was when the
[1:32:42] blind man born from his born from his
[1:32:46] mother's womb in darkness and had never
[1:32:50] seen the light of day.
[1:32:55] He was in a physical darkness and the
[1:32:57] spiritual darkness
[1:32:59] right in the Israel
[1:33:02] should have been full of light. But he
[1:33:05] sat in the darkness
[1:33:08] and Jesus healed him
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; and brought light to his eyes and light
[1:33:13] to his soul.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I'm the light of the
[1:33:17] world."
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Because he banished the darkness and
[1:33:20] pressed it back. And the other one was
[1:33:23] when the leaders came with the woman
[1:33:25] caught in the very act of adultery
[1:33:28] and said, "Moses had said she should be
[1:33:31] stoned, what sayest thou?"
[1:33:36] He stooped and write in the ground.
[1:33:39] First he said, "He that's without sin,
[1:33:42] you cast the first stone."
[1:33:46] And they
[1:33:48] one after the other left his presence
[1:33:53] because he stood and wrote in the
[1:33:54] ground.
[1:33:56] Not because the word did not say that
[1:33:59] but because they neither were they free.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; So they they witnessed it themselves
[1:34:08] when he said he that's without sin cast
[1:34:11] the first stone.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; True. And he wrote in the ground and
[1:34:16] they gave testimony to their own
[1:34:18] conviction that nei were condemned.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Though they had never committed
[1:34:26] adultery, they were condemned and they
[1:34:28] walked out one after the other.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said after he had banished the
[1:34:35] light, the darkness from that poor
[1:34:38] woman's life.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. banished the darkness that gripped
[1:34:42] her and held her.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the light of the world."
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a light.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a light.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; I give him glory.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; I give him praise.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Our self-righteousness is darkness.
[1:35:12] in the rapture message. He said,
[1:35:25] let me just back up a wee bit
[1:35:28] just prior to re preach the rapture
[1:35:30] message,
[1:35:32] but I want to come to
[1:35:35] Luke 17:30.
[1:35:38] And even thus shall it be in the day
[1:35:40] when the son of man is revealed. As it
[1:35:42] was in the days of Noah.
[1:35:46] Are you listening close?
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; In the days of Noah, darkness
[1:35:52] covered
[1:35:53] the face of the earth.
[1:35:57] Violence was everywhere.
[1:36:00] And a holy man could preach for 120
[1:36:05] years
[1:36:08] without a congregation like we have this
[1:36:10] morning
[1:36:13] without convincing anyone to come into
[1:36:16] the ark.
[1:36:18] 120 years and after 115 I wouldn't be a
[1:36:23] bit surprised that there were times when
[1:36:25] Noah said what is my life all about? Is
[1:36:28] this just futility? the utter futility.
[1:36:31] I know that this is true. I know this is
[1:36:33] a revelation. I know that God's going to
[1:36:35] destroy the earth.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; But that was all part of God's plan. And
[1:36:40] he said in the end time as it was in the
[1:36:43] days of Noah and as it was in the days
[1:36:45] of Sodom, that's darkness. Gross
[1:36:48] darkness. Amen.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Even thus
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; shall it be
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; in the day
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; when the son of man is revealed.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Hello friends. That's your day.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; That's your community.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; That's Vancouver, Lynden, Siri,
[1:37:10] Bellingham, wherever you're from.
[1:37:12] Seattle, that's your town.
[1:37:15] That's your That's your subdivision
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; now. You know why I was so thankful
[1:37:25] about our school?
[1:37:30] That's the school that your kids go to.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; They hear vile, vulgar, filthy language
[1:37:40] every day.
[1:37:43] I'm laying it on heavy
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; and you allow that
[1:37:48] and you pay for that
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; not in my books.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; You can have your own reasoning and even
[1:37:56] your own reasoning I'll say your
[1:37:57] reasoning is darkness.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Your human reasoning is not light. It's
[1:38:04] darkness. That's right.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Can you even imagine somebody under the
[1:38:11] law? Can you imagine one of the old one
[1:38:15] of the old people from the law? Can you
[1:38:18] imagine them
[1:38:22] saying, "We're going to tax you and
[1:38:23] we're going to send your you're going to
[1:38:25] send your children, your sons and your
[1:38:27] daughters, and they're going to hear all
[1:38:29] that vulgarity and your daughters are
[1:38:31] going to be looked on and lusted over.
[1:38:35] and spoken about,
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; And your sons are going to have to stand
[1:38:40] and look at these bare breasted young
[1:38:43] ladies that are running around with
[1:38:45] every crease in their body showing
[1:38:47] through the sling slinky garments that
[1:38:50] they wear. Say amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; You know it's the truth.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; I'd get another job if I had to
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; to keep my kids out of that. Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, they might have put me in
[1:39:08] jail for some of the things I did,
[1:39:12] but I saw a whole group of young people
[1:39:14] right over here at at uh what's this
[1:39:17] school here on 184th?
[1:39:19] Murray something.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Curry.
[1:39:24] Curry school. Right over here a couple
[1:39:26] blocks away.
[1:39:28] And I saw all these little teeny boppers
[1:39:31] and my daughter Joanne was one of them.
[1:39:34] All standing there in a circle huddled
[1:39:36] outside the school grounds on the street
[1:39:38] just on the side of the street, you
[1:39:40] know, and one of them had a cigarette in
[1:39:42] their mouth and puffing at I didn't know
[1:39:45] they were old enough to light a match.
[1:39:48] You know what I did? I jammed my brakes
[1:39:51] on, threw my car door open, and ran
[1:39:53] across that street. And they turned
[1:39:54] white.
[1:39:56] And I was white. I was so angry and I
[1:39:59] spoke to them perhaps as a man shouldn't
[1:40:02] speak to them but I don't apologize one
[1:40:04] bit
[1:40:05] I rebuke them for for out there for
[1:40:08] smoking like that today smoking what is
[1:40:11] that that's just some little ah you're
[1:40:14] you know you're from the old school I
[1:40:17] thank God for an old school
[1:40:20] I thank God for some standards I thank
[1:40:22] God for some principles
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; and I say we need to do everything that
[1:40:26] we hand to prevent them.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; And then on down in their life on down
[1:40:31] the young people grow up in the 18, 19,
[1:40:34] 20 ready to get married and they've got
[1:40:36] things that they acquired.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; They saw
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; they had friends. They had peers and
[1:40:46] they acquired these things
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; where in school
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; that you paid for them to be in. Right.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I teach them at home." God
[1:40:57] bless you.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; God bless you for that great effort. Can
[1:41:02] I take a few more minutes?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; See, this is all those are just
[1:41:06] optional. That's free. I know it may
[1:41:07] sting,
[1:41:09] but I'm sorry. The only thing I could do
[1:41:11] is wipe some more salt in the wound
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; and make it sting a little bit worse.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus
[1:41:20] Christ. It's the power of God under
[1:41:22] salvation.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; We're going to just say something then
[1:41:35] you can forget it.
[1:41:37] Might be good if you don't forget it.
[1:41:40] Amen.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; The prophet used this word,
[1:41:44] for the word of God is quick and
[1:41:46] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:41:48] sword, piercing even the dividing a
[1:41:50] sunder of soul and spirit and of the
[1:41:52] joints and marrow and as a discerner of
[1:41:55] the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:41:57] heart. Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it would cause this
[1:42:01] congregation to fall into deep
[1:42:04] condemnation
[1:42:05] if I stood here at the pullpit and spoke
[1:42:08] out what God speaks to me of individual
[1:42:12] lives while we're while I'm standing
[1:42:13] right here preaching.
[1:42:16] You'd say, "Brother Brand would say,
[1:42:17] don't think that." To be perfectly
[1:42:19] honest, I could say the same thing.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Don't think that. You can feel that
[1:42:24] coming. Right.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; You can see whether that is a a a life
[1:42:30] looking you in the face of support or I
[1:42:34] got my own idea. I got my own thought.
[1:42:36] I'm going to say to you today because I
[1:42:38] know I'm coming from the word of God
[1:42:40] which is light and it is the kingdom of
[1:42:43] lightness and anything that wars against
[1:42:45] that is from the kingdom of darkness.
[1:42:49] Sometimes we quote things that may be
[1:42:51] out of the message and we're actually
[1:42:53] referring to the prophets echoing his
[1:42:56] exact words. He may be saying something
[1:42:58] about women. He may be saying something
[1:43:00] about ministers. But when it speaks
[1:43:02] about you women, don't you don't you
[1:43:05] allow not for one moment a little
[1:43:06] feeling of
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; as soon as you do that comes from the
[1:43:11] kingdom of darkness.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; It's a shadow that's trying to move in
[1:43:14] on you. And when something is being
[1:43:17] spoken and and it and it begins to touch
[1:43:19] an area of your life, don't you for a
[1:43:22] second say, you know, and just kind of
[1:43:24] shut it off, you throw your heart wide
[1:43:27] open.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, light of God.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Come in.
[1:43:33] Deal with that thing.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; May the light, May the fire of God burn
[1:43:39] it out.
[1:43:41] You want to walk out of here a different
[1:43:43] person,
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; then I say to you to believe it in the
[1:43:47] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; This God is one that separates light
[1:43:52] from darkness.
[1:43:53] [Applause]
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "We all know we're living in a
[1:44:01] Leodysian age
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; and those seven seals that's held the
[1:44:08] book is a mystery." When we say that I'm
[1:44:11] I'm bringing it down. I'm defining it.
[1:44:13] If it's a mystery, it's held in
[1:44:15] darkness.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; In other words, it hasn't come to light.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; If it's a mystery, you don't know
[1:44:22] anything about it. I don't know anything
[1:44:24] about it. And that's the way a a whole
[1:44:26] segment of the word was.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Says that's the age we're living in.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; And the whole book is a mystery to
[1:44:36] people. Should be open at that day.
[1:44:42] That's what he promised.
[1:44:44] He says, "But the revelation is to
[1:44:47] reveal the truth of it."
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; What it is to make it fit with the rest
[1:44:52] of the scriptures and then God
[1:44:54] vindicates it. That's that to be the
[1:44:57] truth. Amen.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; We have lived and are now living at this
[1:45:02] moment
[1:45:04] when darkness is being pressed back to
[1:45:08] the other side.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; The light was the light of men. The
[1:45:13] scripture speaks of it. The light of
[1:45:15] men. The life was the light of men. The
[1:45:18] true light that lightth every man that
[1:45:20] cometh into the world.
[1:45:25] Even into the Old Testament. We the Old
[1:45:27] Testament was not a perfect light
[1:45:29] because the scripture says that the law
[1:45:32] was unable.
[1:45:34] It was not perfect
[1:45:39] because of the conscience
[1:45:41] for the conscience sake. The conscience
[1:45:44] was not cleared by the law. The man went
[1:45:46] in as a sinner and he walked out and he
[1:45:49] was still a sinner. The nature was not
[1:45:52] changed
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; and so his conscience was not. He came
[1:45:57] in with his lamb. He did everything
[1:45:59] exactly according to the word
[1:46:02] and the high priest would go in and for
[1:46:06] forgiveness for him. But when he walked
[1:46:08] out,
[1:46:10] he still had
[1:46:12] on his conscience.
[1:46:14] His conscience wasn't clear.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; He still had guilt.
[1:46:20] There was no power
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; in the animal blood to clear him of
[1:46:25] guilt.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Guilt's a terrible thing.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon dealt with it and he
[1:46:31] said it'll drive you crazy.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; It'll send you to the Insane Institute.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Is that light? No, that's darkness.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; So, oh, we've got a we've got a pill. We
[1:46:41] can we can put you in some kind of other
[1:46:43] world so you're not in contact with, you
[1:46:46] know, you can't really deal with things.
[1:46:47] Put you in a psychiatric ward. I've been
[1:46:49] there. I've talked to people in there.
[1:46:52] I've prayed with them in there.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; I've been right down here. Not just a
[1:46:58] psychiatric ward. I was down here at
[1:47:00] Riverview when it was operating in a in
[1:47:03] where they had the hardcase
[1:47:07] insane people.
[1:47:09] I stood right there and one of the young
[1:47:13] men came out
[1:47:15] and was with us for several weeks.
[1:47:19] And the doctors called me for a meeting
[1:47:22] at the insane institution and they
[1:47:25] wanted to know what we had done to him.
[1:47:27] He was so remarkably changed. And they
[1:47:30] asked him,
[1:47:32] "Do you still have your medication?"
[1:47:36] Uh he said, "Uh uh no, I don't."
[1:47:40] Cuz the medication was long lasting
[1:47:41] medication supposed to be in his body
[1:47:43] for weeks. He said, "What did you do
[1:47:47] with it?
[1:47:48] Oh, he said I uh I flushed it down the
[1:47:50] toilet.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; The doctor was, you know, the
[1:47:54] psychiatrists are very very kind and
[1:47:57] very level. Okay.
[1:48:01] You flushed it down the toilet. Yeah.
[1:48:03] Yeah. I said, "Yeahhuh."
[1:48:08] They wanted me to know. So then they
[1:48:09] started asking me questions
[1:48:12] at at at at you know at uh the level
[1:48:15] that people would understand at the
[1:48:18] intellectual side and I'm not very much
[1:48:20] given over to that but I did understand
[1:48:22] what they were saying. They said do you
[1:48:25] believe in exorcism?
[1:48:28] Well I knew what that meant. So what I
[1:48:30] asked him I said what does that mean?
[1:48:33] He said that is the practice of casting
[1:48:35] out devils. Oh, I said just as Jesus did
[1:48:39] it in the Bible
[1:48:42] and I just put my back up to the Bible
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; and I felt so comfortable.
[1:48:51] So he said, "Uh, all right. I
[1:48:53] understand." He said, "Do you believe
[1:48:55] that people can be demonpossessed?"
[1:48:59] I said, "Just as Jesus spoke of it and
[1:49:01] taught it in the Bible, that's how we
[1:49:04] believe it.
[1:49:06] said, "Okay."
[1:49:08] And I could see that and he could see
[1:49:10] that we weren't going anywhere
[1:49:13] because he could see I had a stalk
[1:49:15] answer.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; And the answer was just as it is in the
[1:49:18] Bible.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, if you ever get in a
[1:49:21] corner, just put that Bible behind you
[1:49:23] and lean on it.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; It feels so good.
[1:49:28] And then I said to him, I said, "Doctor,
[1:49:30] I understand what you're saying." I
[1:49:32] said, 'If you really want to know what
[1:49:34] we believe, this is what we believe.
[1:49:37] That before it became a physical or a
[1:49:39] mental sickness, it was first a
[1:49:42] spiritual sickness.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; And all the bars went down and he just
[1:49:46] said, "Oh yes." He said, "I would tend
[1:49:48] to agree with you." That was the end of
[1:49:51] the conversation.
[1:49:52] He said in five weeks they were trying
[1:49:54] to he was trying to determine
[1:49:58] how this kind
[1:50:00] of remedy
[1:50:02] improvement could happen to someone who
[1:50:05] was in such a state. They don't
[1:50:07] understand
[1:50:09] this isn't just some needle with an
[1:50:11] injection to make a person like a
[1:50:13] marshmallow.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And I saw I saw a man I felt so sorry
[1:50:16] for him. Excuse me for taking this time.
[1:50:18] Great big man. and he's walking like a
[1:50:21] zombie through the place and and and and
[1:50:24] a nurse, a male nurse I think it was,
[1:50:26] are trying to get to him to throw a shot
[1:50:29] into him and he went into a rage. I
[1:50:32] didn't blame him.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; I didn't blame him a bit cuz he knew
[1:50:35] that wasn't doing any good for him. Just
[1:50:37] making him just a pile of mush.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Oh god,
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; there'll be a day when that darkness
[1:50:44] will leave. Amen.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; There will be no institutions on the
[1:50:48] other side.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; There'll be no hospitals on the other
[1:50:51] side. There'll be no mental disorders on
[1:50:54] the other side. There'll be no aging on
[1:50:57] the other side. As I pray this morning,
[1:50:59] oh God, let me preach with the strength
[1:51:02] of my youth today.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; This light is such a glorious light.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Let me do justice to this light.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; I can say the s
[1:51:15] rose and dawned
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; upon my life upon you that are sitting
[1:51:20] here.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; What about you? I thought of you from
[1:51:23] the colonies in many different colonies
[1:51:25] from different places. What was
[1:51:27] happening? God was separating you from
[1:51:30] darkness.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Utter darkness.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Bringing you out of that fear. Sister
[1:51:36] Kathy,
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; bringing you out of that terrible fear.
[1:51:39] And not only that, a doctrine that is
[1:51:41] nothing but death.
[1:51:43] [Applause]
[1:51:48] We ought to be able to have a a dancing
[1:51:50] jubilee.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; We've been redeemed
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; by love divine. Glory. Glory. Christ is
[1:51:59] mine.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; And what's happening right now? You
[1:52:03] might say, you look at your own
[1:52:04] individual life. I'll tell you what is
[1:52:06] happening. God with the light that's in
[1:52:09] you as an individual. Not because you're
[1:52:11] part of this church, but because you're
[1:52:13] part of him
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; who is the light.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; He is the sen,
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; the source of all eternal life.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Because of him, his light has come into
[1:52:23] you.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; I want to see a testimony of hands. You
[1:52:28] believe that light has come into you?
[1:52:31] All right. The reason I asked that is
[1:52:33] because God had a purpose of that light
[1:52:35] coming into you. And the purpose is to
[1:52:37] press the darkness back to the other
[1:52:41] side.
[1:52:45] And everything about your life,
[1:52:47] everything about the way you perceive
[1:52:48] things, the way you conduct yourself,
[1:52:51] everything about you is pressing that
[1:52:54] darkness back. Your neighbors feel it.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Your friends feel it.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; The people you shop, the stores that you
[1:53:02] shop at, they feel it. You've maybe
[1:53:05] never spoken to them, but they feel it.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; And when it comes to the crunch, they
[1:53:12] finally say, "They're different."
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; She's different.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Not because of your hair, your long
[1:53:18] dress. You're different because it's the
[1:53:21] effect of light.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; And let it be known to you before I
[1:53:26] close this service, that cannot change.
[1:53:29] That's a law of almighty God. And the
[1:53:32] next time you see the sun peek through
[1:53:34] the clouds and shine down on you, I want
[1:53:37] you to remember these statement by this
[1:53:39] little preacher today that a light
[1:53:42] that's greater than that light has
[1:53:44] embodied itself in you as a believer.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; And the son of God, the sen has sent his
[1:53:50] own personal messenger.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; I can see it as it were.
[1:53:59] the morning star
[1:54:03] having five,
[1:54:05] seven stars in his hand.
[1:54:09] And the season came
[1:54:12] and he sent one out. The Apostle Paul,
[1:54:19] are you with me?
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; He's saying,
[1:54:24] "Separate the light from the darkness.
[1:54:27] Take them from law to grace.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Take them from law to grace.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Go out, messenger.
[1:54:40] Go out with this light.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Speak this word. I'll reveal myself to
[1:54:46] you. That great light he saw on the road
[1:54:48] to Damascus came and inhabited him.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, congregation, do you hear me? out in
[1:54:56] the fellowship room. Do you hear me? And
[1:54:58] God sent one after the other after the
[1:55:00] other till finally the last one came.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; The last one in his hand, the one that
[1:55:06] was very close to him.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; That was Elijah. The spirit of Elijah.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; It's different from the rest.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why it's different from
[1:55:15] the rest. Because when John the Baptist
[1:55:17] came, they want to know, are you the
[1:55:19] Messiah?
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; It's so close.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Said no, I'm not the Messiah. Are you
[1:55:24] that prophet? No. Are you Elias? He said
[1:55:28] no. He didn't lie. He knew they were
[1:55:31] looking for Elias of Malachi 4 and he
[1:55:34] wasn't that.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; He knew there was a f a further
[1:55:37] fulfillment of his ministry
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; of his spirit that was on him.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; And then when Jesus came, they said John
[1:55:44] has risen.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Cuz they always were confusing those two
[1:55:48] spirits,
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of
[1:55:50] Christ. And that is why it is no
[1:55:53] surprise to me when the prophet of God
[1:55:55] comes in this day, they said is this
[1:55:58] he's he's a he's Christ. This is Jesus
[1:56:00] is is the Lord. Because it could not in
[1:56:04] the human mind separate those two. And
[1:56:07] the reason why friends listen close now
[1:56:10] because the light that was shining
[1:56:11] through is Christ.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; The light that's shining through is
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; the bright and morning star. Amen.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; It is him.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; So when you focus on that, you know,
[1:56:26] it's just hard to separate the flesh.
[1:56:27] And that's why he said it's so hard for
[1:56:29] you to get that separated.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; But there is a line.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; And finally, that last one.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; You've seen the seven church ages. I'm
[1:56:43] closing now. You've seen the seven
[1:56:45] church ages. Go and look at them.
[1:56:48] And when you see the last one, it's Le
[1:56:50] Oysia.
[1:56:53] And brother Brandham said there's just a
[1:56:55] little sliver of light. He said he left
[1:56:58] that there, but actually it goes into
[1:57:00] total darkness.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; That's your home.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; That's your home.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; That's where you live.
[1:57:12] That's where this church is.
[1:57:17] This is our civilization.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; I don't personally identify it, but
[1:57:21] that's where we're at.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; And so when you see this thing going
[1:57:25] this way and this war over here and this
[1:57:27] uprising,
[1:57:30] when you see a million people in the
[1:57:32] Congo now running for their lives with
[1:57:35] everything on their back and everything
[1:57:36] on their head, everything they own,
[1:57:38] little children,
[1:57:45] I saw little boys like you
[1:57:50] with huge huge loads on their head.
[1:57:55] Little fellas just like you.
[1:57:59] Little girls.
[1:58:01] Not a 100 years ago, yesterday.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:58:07] If you wish, you can get on a plane and
[1:58:09] be there in a few hours and be in the
[1:58:11] same environment
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; and wonder for your own life.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Because we sit here in this relative
[1:58:20] peace and rest, it doesn't mean that
[1:58:22] we're not part of the human community.
[1:58:24] We are.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; And there's preachers and believers of
[1:58:29] this message that's in that very area.
[1:58:39] It's darkness.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you friends, this is
[1:58:44] not some emotional thing, but something
[1:58:47] tugs very very deep in my heart. They
[1:58:49] don't need you to run over there and and
[1:58:51] and and just try to do something. That's
[1:58:55] not why I'm preaching. We're the best
[1:58:58] thing we can do is send a light.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm possessed. absolutely
[1:59:04] obsessed with getting the message out.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; They don't need me. They need the
[1:59:09] prophet's word.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; They need that message.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; If I never preach another message in
[1:59:15] this church, don't forget these words.
[1:59:18] The people out there need the light of
[1:59:20] this message.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm for translating it in
[1:59:23] every possible language. It's not a
[1:59:25] bunch of mechanics. It's the light that
[1:59:27] comes to their being
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; in hearing it and seeing it in their own
[1:59:32] tongue.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; You think that's just been a personal
[1:59:39] view? That's not a personal view. That's
[1:59:42] the word of God.
[1:59:46] What would have happened if Paul simply
[1:59:47] wrote letters in the in the prison where
[1:59:50] he was for a couple of years and and and
[1:59:52] in bonds
[1:59:54] and with a few people in a house
[1:59:58] and he wrote letters to the Corinthians
[1:59:59] and Philippi the Philippians and the
[2:00:01] Colossians and so on so forth. I tell
[2:00:03] you those letters were were they were
[2:00:06] treasured and they were translated other
[2:00:08] language and they were sent abroad with
[2:00:10] runners and and writers and whatever
[2:00:12] more so that other people could have it.
[2:00:15] I'm glad I don't know who but I'm glad
[2:00:17] it reached my hands
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; and the purpose of his life was to turn
[2:00:23] the corner from lot of grace. I'm glad I
[2:00:25] heard about grace.
[2:00:28] But this last messenger closing, help me
[2:00:31] close
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; this last messenger. I I'm just
[2:00:35] wondering. I'm just wondering when I
[2:00:37] cross on the other side. I'd like to
[2:00:38] find out. Did you deliberate, Lord
[2:00:41] Jesus?
[2:00:43] Did you deliberate? Did you think about
[2:00:45] this in your thought in the great plan
[2:00:48] of God? There'd come a day, there'd come
[2:00:51] a precise time
[2:00:53] when the world was moving forward in
[2:00:55] such scientific advancement,
[2:01:01] when the world would become almost a
[2:01:03] global village.
[2:01:06] Just as it's moving in that direction,
[2:01:08] it's coming into absolute darkness.
[2:01:12] I'll send my last one
[2:01:16] with the spirit of Elijah.
[2:01:19] Go.
[2:01:21] Here he comes.
[2:01:25] Doesn't know how to pray.
[2:01:28] Writes a prayer on a note. Tacks it on a
[2:01:31] tree.
[2:01:34] What is this strange feeling?
[2:01:36] As I said to the young couple getting
[2:01:38] married yesterday,
[2:01:40] he says to his young wife,
[2:01:44] "I've got to find out what this is
[2:01:46] about.
[2:01:48] I've got to I've got to get an answer.
[2:01:50] I've got to find out. And if I don't
[2:01:52] find out, I won't be back.
[2:01:57] And he's in his place of prayer
[2:02:01] and he says in his testimony,
[2:02:04] I heard footprints
[2:02:07] coming
[2:02:10] bare feet.
[2:02:15] you that were at the ceremony yesterday
[2:02:17] don't know how my heart was touched.
[2:02:20] I said, "Oh, God, I'm so glad he heard
[2:02:24] those footsteps."
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he received that man, that
[2:02:29] angel
[2:02:30] that toll of his ministry because of
[2:02:32] that light has come to this poor heart
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; and soul of mine. And that light is here
[2:02:41] this morning. He is here. I've talked
[2:02:43] about him
[2:02:45] and a messenger said every time you do
[2:02:47] he comes.
[2:02:51] The one of whom I speak
[2:02:54] is present in this place today.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:03:02] I just want to close
[2:03:05] I want to close with these words.
[2:03:08] I love you.
[2:03:11] Thank you for coming.
[2:03:15] Thank you for sending such a true voice
[2:03:21] for the light that has shone.
[2:03:24] Lord, I'm here before this congregation
[2:03:25] of people. Thank you for the light that
[2:03:28] came to my wife and myself.
[2:03:32] And it was so gripping. It was so
[2:03:33] compelling.
[2:03:35] We simply want to lay our life down
[2:03:38] and do what we could so that others
[2:03:40] might hear.
[2:03:42] And I pray Lord, I'm asking that this
[2:03:46] morning with this congregation of people
[2:03:47] and those that are out in perhaps other
[2:03:49] lands and those that are streaming the
[2:03:51] service that are one with us in this
[2:03:53] meeting out in the fellowship room.
[2:03:57] Lord,
[2:03:59] would you somehow touch
[2:04:02] them with a divine touch?
[2:04:05] Someone may be in deep question, deep
[2:04:07] quandry. Someone may still be in
[2:04:08] darkness. Someone is still
[2:04:11] in the clutches of the enemy and they've
[2:04:13] not free from sin. They're not free from
[2:04:16] the old life.
[2:04:19] Lord, I ask that you would.
[2:04:22] Lord, you know yourself what went
[2:04:23] through my heart and through my mind, my
[2:04:26] thoughts. As I studied, I thought of
[2:04:28] those that once were here, once were in
[2:04:30] fellowship,
[2:04:31] [Music]
[2:04:33] once were walking in harmony and close
[2:04:36] to you and desired
[2:04:39] you to live in them richly. And I think
[2:04:41] of where they are today.
[2:04:45] They wouldn't deny a prophet. They
[2:04:46] wouldn't deny a message. They wouldn't
[2:04:48] deny
[2:04:50] you, Lord Jesus. because they wouldn't
[2:04:52] deny Calvary or the resurrection,
[2:04:55] but for some reason the world and the
[2:04:58] darkness of the world and the shadows of
[2:05:00] Leodia
[2:05:03] have taken such a controlling place in
[2:05:05] their life and they're not here. I pray
[2:05:08] you'll send, oh God, your voice somehow.
[2:05:11] Send someone from this place. Send a
[2:05:13] messenger, oh God, to them. Send a
[2:05:16] sister to someone, oh Lord, to another
[2:05:18] sister. Send a brother, oh God, out and
[2:05:22] speak. I pray, Father, in the name of
[2:05:23] Jesus Christ. And may people realize, oh
[2:05:27] God, this is not just merely a church,
[2:05:30] but this is a body of the elect of Jesus
[2:05:32] Christ. This elect body of the bride of
[2:05:35] Jesus Christ.
[2:05:38] Lord, I give you thanks for that. Just
[2:05:41] to be considered
[2:05:43] as a part of your body.
[2:05:46] We thank you, Lord.
[2:05:49] Let's all stand, shall we?
[2:05:56] [Music]
[2:06:06] Wonder if we could sing just a chorus
[2:06:09] first.
[2:06:13] I have a father.
[2:06:16] Could
[2:06:17] you mic please the piano?
[2:06:20] Can you help me with the um
[2:06:23] just start singing please?
[2:06:25] [Music]
[2:06:35] Oh,
[2:06:38] and you never
[2:06:42] [Music]
[2:06:47] go.
[2:06:50] [Music]
[2:06:58] Heat.
[2:07:04] Heat.
[2:07:09] [Music]
[2:07:15] Oh,
[2:07:18] I
[2:07:22] [Music]
[2:07:29] [Music]
[2:07:32] even
[2:07:36] Heat.
[2:07:42] Heat.
[2:07:55] He sees his
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; I have a father.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Isn't that lovely?
[2:08:20] Thank you.
[2:08:23] [Music]
[2:08:41] Thank you.
[2:08:47] Thank you.
[2:08:49] Thank you.
[2:08:53] knows my name.
[2:08:56] Thank you. He knows my name. He knows
[2:09:00] your name.
[2:09:03] He knows my
[2:09:07] everyone.
[2:09:09] He
[2:09:15] me
[2:09:19] sing. It is well with my soul. It is
[2:09:22] well with my soul. The anthem of this
[2:09:25] church. I want you to look at every
[2:09:27] line.
[2:09:30] If you can say it in truth, sing it. If
[2:09:33] you can't, then just hold your peace by
[2:09:35] it and say, "Why can't I say that? Why
[2:09:38] can't I sing that?" Do not sing it as a
[2:09:41] song. Sing it in truth because truth is
[2:09:45] life
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; and truth is light.
[2:09:50] Hallelujah.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Listen to me congregation
[2:09:55] gathered here and wherever you might be.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; The words of my Lord Jesus. You are the
[2:10:04] light of the world.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; And when our Lord Jesus said that, that
[2:10:14] was such a incredible statement for one
[2:10:17] man.
[2:10:19] One man,
[2:10:21] without technology,
[2:10:24] without the travel,
[2:10:28] modern travel
[2:10:30] to stand perhaps in a pair of sandals on
[2:10:33] sand, searing hot sand,
[2:10:37] and say, "I
[2:10:39] am the light of the world." Amen.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; He knew who he was.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; And he knew what was in him.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; And you must know those two things
[2:10:53] today.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; You must know who you are.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; And you must know what is in you. Amen.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; And if something impedes that, if Satan
[2:11:02] has tried to encroach upon that and
[2:11:06] bring such deep shadows, I will banish
[2:11:08] them today by the power of the word of
[2:11:10] God.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; If you haven't got that liberty, you may
[2:11:15] want to come and stand here at the
[2:11:16] front. And there's ministers here
[2:11:18] that'll pray with you.
[2:11:22] Not you just want a closer walk with
[2:11:24] God. Not that. Just deal with that where
[2:11:27] you are. just want to rededicate your
[2:11:29] life, just deal with that where you are.
[2:11:31] If you've had some enemy that has held
[2:11:35] and you need a total deliverance,
[2:11:38] God is prepared to not only deliver you,
[2:11:41] but remember, please remember this
[2:11:44] congregation. Stay with me in the end of
[2:11:45] this congregation, at the end of this
[2:11:47] service. What we need and what we desire
[2:11:50] is that God will eliminate and remove
[2:11:53] the shadows.
[2:11:55] out
[2:11:58] of a person's life that they might
[2:11:59] indeed be able to say with a witness
[2:12:03] within themselves.
[2:12:05] Jesus said, "I am the light of the
[2:12:07] world."
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; And may that light emanate and permeate
[2:12:11] out
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; of every area
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; of a person's life,
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; name of Jesus Christ. I want everybody
[2:12:20] to say with me, in the name of Jesus
[2:12:22] Christ.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. In the name
[2:12:24] of Jesus Christ.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Let the light shine.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Let the light shine.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Let the power of the enemy be broken.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Let us say also, the light is here.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; The light is here.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Christ, you are here.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[2:12:43] [Music]
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Ministers, if you would come,
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; we're going to sing Christ.

[2:12:54] a river plays.

[2:14:12] And you that are there standing there,

[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; friends. I want to see something of an
[2:14:25] eternal nature take place today here in
[2:14:29] this congregation. Am I asking too much?
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Am I asking too much?
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; The light is here.
[2:14:41] Let that light then move.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Let that light sever bondage.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; And now I'd like the whole congregation,
[2:19:27] lift your voice up in prayer for all of
[2:19:29] these that are being prayed for right
[2:19:31] now. Everyone, you have someone on your
[2:19:33] heart. Let's call on God and just pray
[2:19:36] that there'll be a mighty manifestation
[2:19:38] of the power of the Holy Spirit. I look
[2:19:41] to you to pray wherever you are. Just
[2:19:43] reach out to God. Oh father, I join with
[2:19:47] this whole congregation of people. We
[2:19:50] are praying to a living God. A God who
[2:19:53] hears us when we pray. A God who answers
[2:19:57] because you love to answer. You love to
[2:20:00] give it to your people to give them
[2:20:02] every good gift. Oh God, give
[2:20:04] deliverance where deliverance is needed.
[2:20:06] Father, some of these have been bound.
[2:20:08] Some of these have been hindered. Some
[2:20:10] of these have been sitting in the
[2:20:11] shadows of darkness. Let that darkness
[2:20:13] leave now, Father, in Jesus Christ's
[2:20:16] name.
[2:20:17] Banish the darkness.
[2:20:20] Banish the confusion
[2:20:22] in the name of Jesus Christ. Banish, oh
[2:20:26] God, every spirit that is hounding them,
[2:20:31] every contrary thing, oh God, and let
[2:20:34] them step out into the glorious light.
[2:20:36] And may they claim the promise as I walk
[2:20:38] in the light as I walk in the light as
[2:20:40] he is in the light that I have
[2:20:42] fellowship. Oh God, fill them with the
[2:20:45] Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit of light
[2:20:48] and truth. Lead them, oh guide. Oh lead
[2:20:52] them, oh heavenly guide. Lead them, I
[2:20:55] pray. Shepherd, shepherd of the flock,
[2:20:57] lead them. Do this marvelous thing
[2:21:00] amongst us, oh God. May this be, may
[2:21:03] this be the hour, oh God, when the Holy
[2:21:06] Ghost falls upon the people,
[2:21:10] from the pulpit, oh God, to the pew, out
[2:21:13] into the fellowship room and the
[2:21:15] balcony,

[2:21:20] pray.

[2:21:24] room, oh God, name of Jesus. In the name
[2:21:27] of Jesus, let that name be glorified.

[2:21:33] name be lifted up. Let that name be
[2:21:35] praised. Praise. Praise.

[2:22:22] you're doing, we receive it in the name
[2:22:25] of Jesus Christ. I receive it from you
[2:22:27] now, Lord. Transforming power of Christ,
[2:22:30] the transforming power. Yes, Satan, you

[2:27:58] the best thing a prophet said, the best
[2:28:00] thing you say. God bless you

[2:29:16] from overseas, Lord, the Iberon family,
