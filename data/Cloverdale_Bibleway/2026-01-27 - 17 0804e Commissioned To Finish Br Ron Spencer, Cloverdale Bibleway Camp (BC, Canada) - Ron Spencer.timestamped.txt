[0:05] have been blessed so far at camp? I've
[0:07] had a wonderful time all the way from
[0:09] junior camp. We've just felt a wonderful
[0:11] presence. It's so good to know that when
[0:13] we come and we do our part, God is
[0:15] always faithful to come and do his part.
[0:17] Amen. So, all you have to do is come
[0:19] with an open heart and you'll receive a

[1:18] as wounds which bar the chosen one
[1:24] bring many sons to gloryy.
[1:32] Oh behold the man upon the cross.
[1:38] my sin upon his shoulders.
[1:43] Ashamed I hear the mocker's voice
[1:48] call out among the scoffers.
[1:53] It was my sin that held him there
[1:58] until it was accomplished.
[2:03] His dying breath has brought me life.
[2:08] I know that it is finished.
[2:14] Amen. How great the gulf. How great the
[2:18] gulf that God did spend
[2:22] to come where I lay helpless.

[3:49] No peace, no power, no
[3:56] boast in Jesus Christ and his death and
[4:01] resurrection.
[4:07] before
[4:09] I cannot give an answer,
[4:14] but this I know with all my heart.
[4:19] His words have made my way. Oh, why
[4:22] should I boast? Why should I look on his
[4:27] reward?
[4:29] I cannot give an answer.
[4:34] And this I know with all my heart.
[4:39] His words have paid my ransom.

[13:25] thankful to be a part of this service
[13:27] tonight. Aren't you glad to be here? We
[13:28] could be so many other places, but God
[13:30] seen fit to have you here in this
[13:32] service this evening. And that means
[13:33] there's something specific for you here
[13:35] in this service this evening. So don't
[13:37] leave without getting it. Amen. Amen. I
[13:41] just pray you'd be blessed this evening.
[13:43] Brother John, would you come please and
[13:44] pray for us?
[13:47] Let's just continue to worship God in
[13:49] our giving. Now, if you have a need as
[13:51] we bow our heads and you'd like the Lord
[13:53] to speak to you, this is your time.
[13:56] Let's just praise him together as we
[13:58] give thanksgiving. Heavenly Father, we
[14:01] want to thank you, God. As we heard this
[14:03] morning, you've given us breath and we
[14:06] want to cry out, Lord, and thank you and
[14:08] praise you, Lord, for this wonderful day
[14:11] that you have given us here at Mount
[14:12] Baker Bible Way Camp to be able to come
[14:15] together and worship, to be able to
[14:17] forget about the world and the things of
[14:19] life, be able to come into this little
[14:22] tent, Lord, and to know that when we
[14:24] leave, supernatural things are going to
[14:26] happen tonight, Lord. just sensing that
[14:29] expectation and that desire and that
[14:32] hunger in the people. I know our hands
[14:34] are lifted up. There's needs among us,
[14:36] Lord. But we just want to thank you
[14:38] already for going out and meeting our
[14:40] needs and satisfying our thirst. Jesus,
[14:44] want to thank you for this morning's
[14:45] service, Lord, as you used our brother
[14:48] David Mayor to speak to us that we are
[14:51] champions and we are heroes. We pray
[14:53] that that would be more than words, more
[14:55] than a sermon, but as we hear the word
[14:58] tonight, it would respond within our
[15:00] souls of healing and life and
[15:02] deliverance for every person here that
[15:06] our souls would cry out, Lord, and
[15:08] respond together, Lord. We love you
[15:10] tonight, Jesus. Oh God, may this tent
[15:13] tonight be filled with adoration and
[15:16] praises and hallelujah. that when our
[15:18] brother Ron comes, Lord, there be an
[15:20] atmosphere where the supernatural could
[15:23] take place.
[15:25] Bless this offering, God. As you've
[15:28] given to us, we want to give back. Some
[15:31] cannot give. Maybe tonight they've
[15:33] forgotten, but I pray you put it in our
[15:35] hearts. And as tomorrow night and Sunday
[15:37] morning we give again, may you, Lord,
[15:40] multiply and continue to work through
[15:43] the body. Every need supplies. If it's
[15:46] spiritual, if it's physical, if it's
[15:48] mental, emotional, financial, Lord, you
[15:51] are here to minister to us. And we want
[15:54] to roll out the carpet as it was and let
[15:56] you walk in among us. Bless the
[15:58] remainder of the service, our giving,
[16:01] our worship, the ministry of the word.
[16:06] Just a moment in your presence could
[16:09] change a life forever.
[16:11] And if that life is ours or someone next
[16:13] to us, we want to create an atmosphere.
[16:16] God, come tonight, Jesus. We give you
[16:18] this service, the offering in Jesus
[16:22] Christ's name. Amen.
[16:28] Amen. You can be seated. Let's just sing
[16:30] that chorus together. So glad I'm yours,
[16:32] Lord. So glad I'm yours. Eflat.

[20:12] &gt;&gt; I will follow
[20:15] your ways.

[34:42] from France, Switzerland
[34:46] this morning. And wow, was that was that
[34:48] good.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; That was just great. I I have uh become
[34:54] very good buddies with brother David.
[34:57] I'll never forget the the pitch that
[35:00] Brother Ed gave me to go to Switzerland.
[35:04] It was about a 30 minute
[35:08] pitch and it worked.
[35:12] Amen. And
[35:14] &gt;&gt; I'm just thankful for that. Brother Ed
[35:16] shared his burden for Switzerland
[35:20] and uh I've been there a few times with
[35:22] them now and and uh we certainly we
[35:26] certainly enjoy them and enjoyed Brother
[35:29] David's message this morning. Amen.
[35:31] Could we just bow our heads tonight and
[35:34] maybe you have come to the this evening
[35:37] to this to this tent and you'd like to
[35:39] say, "Brother Ron, I just I just need a
[35:42] supernatural touch from him.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; I just need him to come among me."
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, we bow our heads before
[35:51] you now.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to the Lamb.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; And we're very conscious of what you
[35:56] have done even this afternoon.
[36:00] Oh, without you we would be failures and
[36:04] &gt;&gt; we would have been wrecks on the on the
[36:06] road, a highway somewhere or another.
[36:09] But God, you were rich in mercy.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; It was your great love that you you came
[36:16] and Lord touched our lives.
[36:20] Oh father, I ask you that this afternoon
[36:23] you see each hand that is raised be and
[36:27] defied gravity.
[36:29] We realize we need something beyond our
[36:32] self. Father, I ask you today that you
[36:35] would come and minister to us in a in a
[36:38] special way. Touch all the new friends
[36:41] that have come among us tonight. And I
[36:44] ask you that you would anoint, bless
[36:46] each individual. You see our needs and
[36:49] Dear God.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Oh God, you're a God that's so special
[36:53] that you can touch each and every one of
[36:55] them. I ask you tonight that you would
[36:58] anoint, Father, this vessel as I speak.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; I pray that you would strengthen our
[37:04] vocal cords.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; May they just get stronger.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, our precious brother Ed, I ask you
[37:10] that you'd send your word and heal him
[37:14] today.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Strengthen him, Father.
[37:17] Oh God, may you just do an incredible
[37:20] work
[37:21] &gt;&gt; beyond all doctor's expectation.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Father, it's your work.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; And so we surrender ourselves to you
[37:31] this afternoon. Whether we're the
[37:33] speaker or the hearer or the
[37:35] technicians, I ask you that you would
[37:38] just come among us. And may your
[37:41] presence be known in this tent tonight
[37:44] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[37:47] And amen. Amen. Do you love him?
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you will turn with me to Luke
[37:53] chapter 9 and verse 57.
[38:08] I would like to speak this afternoon on
[38:10] commissioned to finish.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; All right. Our
[38:18] prophet ex declared unto us and it
[38:21] doesn't mean much to the rest of the
[38:23] world but it means something to us
[38:26] &gt;&gt; that we are the final voice
[38:29] &gt;&gt; to the final age.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; And so we realize that we're the
[38:33] finishing of the gentile dispensation
[38:35] and there's not another messenger
[38:37] coming. There's not there's not another
[38:40] message that is even coming. This is the
[38:43] final message that will call the bride
[38:46] of Jesus Christ together.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Now, the message is more than just the
[38:51] messenger. It's to a group of people
[38:53] that grab the vision for themselves.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; And they begin to realize that they're a
[39:01] part of it. And it's individual. Two in
[39:04] the bed, want to be taken, want to be
[39:06] left. I know which one I want to be.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Two at the meal, want to be taken, want
[39:10] to be left. I know which one I want to
[39:12] be.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; But the rapture is not that's just the
[39:20] finishing of it.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; While we're here on the earth,
[39:25] &gt;&gt; we've got a race to run.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; A message to live.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; The prophet would use a term called
[39:32] lived voices.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; I pray today that God would just speak
[39:36] to us in a special way. In Luke chapter
[39:40] nine, Jesus is going to share with us
[39:44] a real a real principle.
[39:48] And it came to pass that as they went in
[39:50] the way, a a certain man said unto him,
[39:53] Lord,
[39:56] I will follow thee whethersoever thou
[39:58] goest.
[40:01] And Jesus said unto him, "Foxes have
[40:04] holes, birds of the air have nest, but
[40:08] the Son of Man hath not where to lay his
[40:11] head."
[40:12] And he said unto another, "Follow me."
[40:16] And he said, "Lord, suffer me first to
[40:19] go bury my father." And Jesus said unto
[40:22] him, "Let the dead bury their dead,
[40:25] &gt;&gt; but go thou and preach the kingdom of
[40:28] God." And another also said, Lord, I
[40:32] will follow thee, but let me first go
[40:35] bid them farewell which are at the home
[40:39] at my house. And Jesus saith unto him,
[40:43] No man,
[40:44] &gt;&gt; yes,
[40:46] &gt;&gt; no man having put his hand to the plow
[40:50] and looking back is fit for the kingdom
[40:54] of God.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; You may be seated this afternoon.
[41:05] Jesus would pray this prayer and his
[41:07] disciples would capture it and it would
[41:10] be here even for us today. And Jesus
[41:12] prayed and taught them how to pray. And
[41:15] he said after this manner, therefore
[41:16] pray ye. Our father which art in heaven,
[41:21] hallowed be thy name.
[41:24] Thy kingdom come. Amen.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Thy will be done in earth as it is in
[41:31] heaven.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Not my kingdom come, but thy kingdom
[41:39] come.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Thy will be done. Not my will.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Thy will be done in earth as it is in
[41:50] heaven. Give us this day our daily
[41:53] bread. and forgive us our debts as we
[41:56] forgive our debtors. And lead us not
[41:59] into temptation, but deliver us from
[42:02] evil. For thine is the kingdom and the
[42:06] power and the glory forever. Amen.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Paul would write it like this. Know you
[42:14] not that they which run
[42:18] in a race run all, but one receiveth the
[42:22] prize.
[42:24] So run that ye may obtain.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; And every man that striveth for the
[42:30] mastery is tempering in all things. Now
[42:32] they do it to obtain a corruptible
[42:36] crown, but we incorruptible. Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Watch Paul now as he begins to just
[42:42] share these words with you. I therefore
[42:45] so run,
[42:46] &gt;&gt; not as uncertainly so fight I, not as
[42:50] one that beatth the air, but I keep
[42:53] under my body and bring it into
[42:56] subjection,
[42:58] lest that by any means when I have
[43:01] preached to others,
[43:03] &gt;&gt; I myself should be a cast away.
[43:09] The prophet of God shares this with us.
[43:11] He said, "The greatest weapon that I
[43:14] know of a Christian today is a committal
[43:20] to God.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; When you can't do nothing about it,
[43:25] &gt;&gt; just commit it to him
[43:27] &gt;&gt; and God will take care of it."
[43:33] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand commitment.
[43:36] commitment is is is is wholeheartedly.
[43:40] God asked for first place in our lives
[43:44] in our in our age today of leosia that
[43:47] you and I have to combat with in this
[43:50] age. It it contest us. It contest our
[43:54] will. It contest our ambitions. It
[43:58] contest everything that there is about
[44:00] being a a Christian.
[44:03] But God wants us to be totally committed
[44:07] to him.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Totally committed to him.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand there's many
[44:14] people that are talented.
[44:16] There's many people that have great
[44:18] ability. There's many people that have
[44:21] great names and love. But listen, God
[44:24] has a predestinated seed that is on the
[44:27] earth that God deposited and pre-planned
[44:31] that you would be here. He knew when you
[44:33] would be born and what hour that you'd
[44:35] be born, the nature that you would have
[44:37] carrying from last night. He knew that
[44:40] you would be here, but he had a purpose
[44:43] for your life.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Now, Satan will throw everything that he
[44:48] can at it to defeat that purpose.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I do not mind if he
[44:55] defeats my personal purpose. But listen,
[44:59] God's purpose can never be defeated.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; In life, there are many people
[45:11] that could write great volumes of books
[45:16] of the could have been. Yes.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Prisons hold people
[45:25] &gt;&gt; that could have been great lawyers.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; They could have been great doctors.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Some of them could have been presidents.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; They could have been great family men
[45:39] and women.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; But because of some choices
[45:45] &gt;&gt; that they made in their lives,
[45:49] It held them captive.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; It held them captive till now they serve
[45:56] under a warden.
[45:59] Under that warden they must eat when he
[46:02] tells them to eat.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; They must they must wear the clothes
[46:06] that he tells them to wear.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; They must go to bed when they are told
[46:12] to go to bed.
[46:14] There's certain medias that they cannot
[46:16] watch.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; They are known maybe by their last name
[46:20] or a number that is on the back of their
[46:23] jerseys.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Many of them will never know what
[46:28] freedom is ever about.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Some of them are sentenced anywhere from
[46:32] days to months to years to lifetimes.
[46:38] Some of them were incredibly good
[46:40] people.
[46:42] Some of them had great ambition and
[46:44] great purpose in their life. But
[46:46] somewhere or another emotions
[46:50] or friendships entangled them
[46:54] &gt;&gt; and it bound them
[46:56] &gt;&gt; and their life's ambitions that they may
[46:58] have wrote down in school that this is
[47:00] what I want to be. Their life's
[47:03] ambitions was tangled by just incredibly
[47:06] horrible choices.
[47:09] Yeah.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Some of them could have been the
[47:15] greatest athletes.
[47:17] Some of them could have been great
[47:20] great artist.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Some of them could have been a lot of
[47:23] great things.
[47:26] But they sat in prison behind walls.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; True.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; They said entangled.
[47:34] What does that have to do with tonight's
[47:36] service? Brother Ron, Jesus is talking
[47:39] about there are many that will take a
[47:42] hold of the plow.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; There are many that will hear his voice
[47:49] and they will make a start.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; They will make a start. Oh, we as the
[47:56] bride of Jesus Christ realize that we're
[47:59] elected and predestinated
[48:02] that God's going to see this through.
[48:05] But I want you to understand, we're not
[48:07] just talking to the bride of Christ
[48:08] tonight.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; But you too are at a war.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; You too are at war.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; You too must fight Leotaa.
[48:19] And Leoa has many entanglements that
[48:22] goes along with it. The cares of this
[48:25] life can ins snare you. The busyiness of
[48:29] this life. All of us have the same 24
[48:33] hours in the day. Rich or poor, biggest
[48:36] house or the smallest tent, all of us
[48:39] have 24 hours in the day. The richest
[48:42] man in the world does not have an extra
[48:44] second.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? The greatest educated
[48:50] person in the world does not have an
[48:53] extra second. Right.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; But if God is going to give me this
[49:00] appropriated time,
[49:02] &gt;&gt; I want to give all of my energies
[49:06] &gt;&gt; and all of my days unto Almighty God.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; I too stand here and just share with you
[49:14] this afternoon. I have looked back at
[49:17] days that I have wasted. I have looked
[49:20] back and looked back at days where my
[49:22] energies has been directed in in other
[49:25] things may not maybe not sinful things
[49:27] but they I've been drawn in in different
[49:30] things just because of life.
[49:34] Life just sometimes does that to us. But
[49:37] let me just say this to you. I cannot do
[49:40] anything about yesterday.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach in this tent.
[49:46] I can't do anything about yesterday,
[49:49] &gt;&gt; but I can commit.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; I can commit.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; It's like someone joining an orchestra.
[50:01] Now, let me just say this to you. Gifts
[50:04] and callings are without repentance.
[50:07] And we can only be what God called us to
[50:09] be.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; That's all that we can be is what God
[50:13] called us to be. But neither do I want
[50:16] to be any more than what he called me.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; But neither do I want to be any less
[50:21] than what I call.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; So if my job tonight is to be the
[50:26] preacher, I want to be the best that God
[50:29] will allow me to be.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; If it's to be the a maner, I want to be
[50:34] the best that God called me to be.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[50:43] Now, if I was in a in an orchestra
[50:48] and I had a part to play, I had a I had
[50:52] a specific job to do,
[50:56] if I was the first chair,
[51:00] you see,
[51:02] it would take someone to place me in
[51:06] that spot.
[51:09] I would have to be anointed and elected
[51:11] to that position.
[51:13] But you see,
[51:15] even being the first chair, I must make
[51:19] sure that I'm properly in line with the
[51:22] composer and the director.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; I must make sure that I do everything
[51:28] possible to make sure that I did it
[51:32] right.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; That doesn't happen by chance. It has to
[51:36] be 100% right on.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Now understand understand this.
[51:45] Are we okay?
[51:47] All right.
[52:00] Here's
[52:21] what Satan knows. He knows he's in
[52:23] trouble tonight.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; He knows he's in trouble. I already I
[52:29] got him targeted.
[52:30] Are we on?
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Better give you this. Satan knows he's
[52:45] in trouble. It's going to be a tough
[52:47] evening for him.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Can you hear me better?
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Have you heard everything I've said so
[52:57] far?
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Good. But I don't have to go over it
[53:00] again.
[53:05] Now,
[53:06] we must understand that when we get a
[53:09] the sheet music,
[53:10] &gt;&gt; yes,
[53:10] &gt;&gt; as being a part of the orchestra, we
[53:13] must understand that we can't negotiate
[53:16] with the sheet music,
[53:18] &gt;&gt; the sheet music is what it is.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; And it isn't it isn't aware that we can
[53:24] change it
[53:26] &gt;&gt; to fit us.
[53:28] You see, Elisha had to be trimmed to fit
[53:31] Elijah's rope.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; And so, we don't we can't change the
[53:37] message to fit us.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; It is us that have to be trimmed to fit
[53:42] the message.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; And and and and let me just say this to
[53:49] you. There's no great eyes or little
[53:52] news. There's no there's no one among us
[53:55] other than Jesus Christ. He is the great
[53:58] one that is in the building tonight.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for another great
[54:03] leader to come on the scene. We're
[54:05] looking for the voice that is behind the
[54:07] voice.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; I just want to remind you, he's in every
[54:11] service.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; We invited him here and he keeps all of
[54:15] his appointments and he's here. Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; And let me just say this to anyone that
[54:23] makes a national orchestra or a
[54:26] universal orchestra, they have to be
[54:28] committed.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; If you would make the Olympic team, you
[54:33] would have to be committed.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; God is expecting nothing less.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be any accidental
[54:44] raptures.
[54:49] There's not going to be, "Well, I I hope
[54:51] I make it." That's not how this works.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; That's not how this works. God's going
[54:57] to have a committed bride of Jesus
[55:00] Christ that lives every day of her life
[55:03] committed wholeheartedly to him.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; It's not part of the world and part God.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; It's 100% him.
[55:15] So my book is not going to be started
[55:18] out with could have been.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; I neither believe in
[55:25] in a half-hearted religion.
[55:28] You're
[55:28] &gt;&gt; right.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus askked us, "Take up your
[55:33] cross
[55:36] and follow me,"
[55:39] there's going to be some self cost.
[55:43] that's going to have to be paid by us as
[55:46] individuals.
[55:48] There's going to be some self-sacrifice
[55:52] that we're going to have to make.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; But so many times we want to be like a
[55:57] 40year-old still living with mom and
[55:59] dad, paying no grocery bill, no electric
[56:02] bill.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; If you're in that condition today, wake
[56:10] up.
[56:14] taking no responsibility for their own
[56:17] selves.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; You see, they're an indebted to their
[56:20] own family.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; They're carrying the family name. You
[56:24] can get mad at me later if you want to.
[56:26] Right now is not a good time.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Become an indebted or a literally a a
[56:34] weight on the family because you've got
[56:37] no responsibility.
[56:39] You don't want to take any commitment.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Don't cook. Don't clean.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Don't even clean your own room. I don't
[56:49] know who I'm talking to, but evidently
[56:51] I'm talking to somebody.
[56:56] Well, maybe I'm not talking to anybody
[56:58] in this building tonight,
[57:01] but let me just bring it up just a
[57:02] little bit closer.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Many times people sit in pews.
[57:08] We'll not call it basement, but people
[57:12] occupy pews
[57:15] &gt;&gt; that refuse to have any vision,
[57:19] &gt;&gt; refuse to accept their purpose in life.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; It's all about me.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; The church ought to be glad that I just
[57:28] sit here.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; If my name is not called, I'm not a part
[57:36] of this thing. If my idea is not
[57:39] projected forth, I I'm just going to
[57:41] walk away.
[57:44] Well, let me just say there's some
[57:45] benefits that goes along with this. It's
[57:48] called tribulation. Period.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; You see, there's groups of people that
[57:54] sit around the bride of Jesus Christ
[57:56] that has not been defiled by
[57:58] denominational systems
[58:02] &gt;&gt; who did not get a new birth.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:07] But by association they were they were
[58:10] elected.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; But they never caught the vision.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. Lord, you're the one who told me
[58:20] to go here. So here we are.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say this to you. We are
[58:30] here tonight. Brother Tom, is this all
[58:32] right? cuz I
[58:35] we're here tonight as your family has
[58:38] sent you here.
[58:40] They paid your way. Many of you paid
[58:43] your own way. Some of you came hours.
[58:46] Some of you came literally many flights
[58:49] just to get here. So, you know the cost
[58:52] of getting here and the the immeasurable
[58:54] time that that it took to get in this
[58:57] building.
[58:59] Sometimes even as the days would
[59:01] progress in a meeting, you become
[59:04] fatigued.
[59:06] Maybe wanting entertainment,
[59:09] maybe wanting the services to be a
[59:11] certain way, but God wants to bring you
[59:14] to a level tonight.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; That it becomes more than a protractive
[59:20] meeting.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; It becomes more than who you're sitting
[59:24] beside.
[59:26] It becomes more than friendships or
[59:28] family reunions.
[59:30] It becomes more than music or more than
[59:33] even a favorite preacher. God is calling
[59:37] and declaring tonight. I want total
[59:40] commitment.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; And so tonight, I want to speak to you
[59:46] on challenged
[59:48] &gt;&gt; to finish.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[59:53] Many many of your mothers and fathers
[59:56] have great testimonies.
[59:58] Testimonies that can be written down in
[1:00:00] the annals of eternity as as phenomenal
[1:00:05] overcoming testimonies of Leo.
[1:00:09] But that is not your testimony.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; You see, God doesn't have coattail
[1:00:16] religion.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as coel religion.
[1:00:22] The scripture says to him that
[1:00:24] overcometh,
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; "Will I grant to sit with me in my
[1:00:29] throne?"
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; As I taught my children that is not here
[1:00:33] tonight, as I taught my children, I
[1:00:36] would show them the pictures on the wall
[1:00:38] that they passed by over and over again.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Sister Marilyn's picture of of Brother
[1:00:45] Brandham sitting by the fire
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; passed by Hoffman's head of Christ.
[1:00:51] We have several pictures of Jesus. We
[1:00:54] have a lot of a lot of her message
[1:00:56] pictures that are in our home. And I've
[1:00:59] taken them before, especially Sister
[1:01:02] Marilyn's
[1:01:04] picture that she painted. And I've I
[1:01:07] I've I've shared this conversation with
[1:01:09] them more than once. It is important
[1:01:12] that you know who William Brandham is,
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; but it is more important that you know
[1:01:19] the God that lived inside of William
[1:01:22] Random.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; It is important that you realize that
[1:01:29] I'm your father.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; It's important that you realize that I'm
[1:01:33] your pastor. But I want you to catch who
[1:01:36] God is.
[1:01:39] Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Just share a few scriptures with you.
[1:01:42] Jesus is going to come to some final
[1:01:45] moments with his disciples.
[1:01:49] In Matthew
[1:01:51] 28
[1:01:53] verse 16,
[1:01:55] he said, "Then the 11 disciples went
[1:01:57] away into Galilee into a mountain where
[1:01:59] Jesus had appointed them.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; And when they saw him, they worshiped
[1:02:03] him. But some doubted."
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? and you met
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; and Jesus came and spake unto them,
[1:02:13] saying, "All power
[1:02:16] is given unto me in heaven and in
[1:02:20] earth."
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say, at this point, it
[1:02:23] doesn't matter what the skeptics say.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; At this point, I want you to understand
[1:02:32] tonight, I could care less what Facebook
[1:02:36] Yes, sir.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not one to be very dainty
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; and I'm not about politics. I could care
[1:02:43] less what Believe the Sign says.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; At this point, it don't matter.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "And Jesus came and spake
[1:02:59] unto them, saying, All power is given
[1:03:02] unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye
[1:03:05] therefore and teach all nations.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; So now he's going to commission them.
[1:03:11] You got a job.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; I have preached to you. You have seen
[1:03:15] the works of God, but now it's going to
[1:03:19] be your turn.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Baptizing them in the name of the Father
[1:03:26] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:30] And this scripture is going to trip up
[1:03:35] every trinitarian in the world,
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; teaching them to observe all things
[1:03:40] whatsoever I command you. And lo, I am
[1:03:43] with you always, even unto the end of
[1:03:46] the world.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Now, God made a promise.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And that promise is still real tonight.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; So, as I stand here, he anoints the word
[1:03:57] that he has delivered to the people.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; He made a promise to be in this building
[1:04:01] tonight. Yes.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 16. Afterward he appeared
[1:04:07] unto the 11 even as he sat at meat and
[1:04:11] upgraded them with their unbelief and
[1:04:13] the hardness of heart because they
[1:04:15] believed not them which had had seen him
[1:04:18] after he was risen. And he said unto
[1:04:20] them, "Go ye into all the world."
[1:04:24] That's what this church, that's what's
[1:04:26] this camp, that's what our churches,
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; have took up and become commissioned. Go
[1:04:33] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:04:35] to every creature. And he that believeth
[1:04:38] and is baptized shall be saved. But he
[1:04:42] that believeth not shall be damned. And
[1:04:45] these signs shall follow them that
[1:04:48] believe. In my name shall they cast out
[1:04:51] devils, and they shall speak with new
[1:04:53] tongues, and they shall take up
[1:04:55] serpents, and if they drink any deadly
[1:04:58] thing, it shall not hurt them. They
[1:05:00] shall lay hands on the sick, and they
[1:05:02] shall recover.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 and verse one. And I saw
[1:05:11] another mighty angel come down from
[1:05:14] heaven clothed with a cloud, and a
[1:05:17] rainbow was upon his head, and his face
[1:05:20] were as it were the sun, and his feet as
[1:05:23] pillars of fire. Verse seven. But in the
[1:05:25] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:05:28] when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:05:30] mystery of God should be finished, as he
[1:05:32] had declared unto his servants, the
[1:05:34] prophet, and the voice which I heard
[1:05:36] from heaven spake unto me again, saying,
[1:05:39] Go and take the little book which is
[1:05:41] open in the a hand of the angel, which
[1:05:43] standeth upon the sea, and upon the
[1:05:45] earth. And I went unto the angel, and
[1:05:48] said unto him, Give me the little book.
[1:05:51] Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; I got to have it.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Give me the little book. And he said
[1:05:58] unto me, take it and eat it up.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Verse 11. And he said unto me, thou must
[1:06:08] prophesy.
[1:06:11] Hallelujah. Again.
[1:06:14] After you've taken this message and
[1:06:17] you've ate it and it cleaned it up and
[1:06:20] it's took all of your denominational
[1:06:23] theological ideas out of you and it's
[1:06:26] washed you by the washing of the word
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; and you come under the inspiration of
[1:06:33] more than a prophet but under the
[1:06:35] inspiration of the mighty angel.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Grab a hold of that inspiration tonight.
[1:06:43] and become a lived voices.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not a preacher. I'm going to address
[1:06:50] you tonight. Revelation chapter 3. These
[1:06:54] are all familiar scriptures to you.
[1:06:57] Behold, I stand at the door knock.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:07:05] door, I will come in to him and s with
[1:07:08] him and he with me. To him
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; that just slides through.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; To him that survives.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; To him that gives his half of his heart.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; To him that overcomes,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; which means to wrestle with and prevail.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm looking at some serpent
[1:07:32] bruisers tonight.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm looking at some overcomers
[1:07:38] tonight.
[1:07:42] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:07:44] even as I also overcame and am sat down
[1:07:47] with my father in his throne.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Revelation 12 and verse 10.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; And I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:07:56] heaven now is come salvation and
[1:07:59] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[1:08:02] the power of his Christ for the accuser
[1:08:05] of our brethren is cast down. Satan, I
[1:08:08] want you to listen tonight.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; He has cast down which accused them
[1:08:13] before our God day and night and they
[1:08:17] overcame him.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; I read the scripture and Ron Spencer
[1:08:26] overcame him.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Tom Ray overcame him.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; How Hilderbrand overcame him. Ed Biscll
[1:08:36] overcame him. Read your name in it.
[1:08:40] Yes, sir.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "If you can't
[1:08:44] read Jesus in every scripture," he said,
[1:08:47] "Read it again." But remember this, if
[1:08:49] you you are in him, you're also in every
[1:08:53] scripture.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; And Ron Spencer overcame him by the
[1:08:59] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[1:09:01] testimony.
[1:09:04] Hallelujah.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Now listen to the prophet of God. I'm
[1:09:11] trying to behave.
[1:09:14] God's strategy is to take empty human
[1:09:17] vessels
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; and shake the world with them.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Brother David Mayor this morning, if you
[1:09:26] didn't hear it, go back and listen to
[1:09:27] it.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; He brought us heroes.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; He brought us men like Shamgar.
[1:09:33] Are you with me?
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; A man that was a descendant of the
[1:09:37] inheritance of Abraham's promise.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; He was not a preacher.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; We don't know anything other than he
[1:09:44] must have been a farmer.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; And the enemy continued to come and rob
[1:09:48] him of blessing after blessing after
[1:09:50] blessing after blessing. But one day he
[1:09:52] recognized who he was.
[1:09:55] If you can only recognize who you are
[1:09:57] tonight,
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; not because the preacher told you who
[1:10:01] you are, but you recognize who you are.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; This is my day. This is my hour. This is
[1:10:10] my opportunity.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to do this for me but me.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[1:10:28] At Pentecost, what did he do? He taken
[1:10:32] them 10 days to get all emptied out up.
[1:10:36] They was all standing there with their
[1:10:38] vessels turned up. And God took himself
[1:10:41] and filled them up. That's all. And they
[1:10:46] shook the world.
[1:10:48] He poured himself into them.
[1:10:52] That's the need of today. That's what we
[1:10:55] need today
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; is the empty vessels. Yes, sir. So God
[1:11:00] can fill them up
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; and you cannot take them. He says God
[1:11:05] cannot use them as long as they're
[1:11:07] already filled up.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; If you're full of theological training,
[1:11:11] God can't use you.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; God's got to have empty vessels that he
[1:11:16] can fill them. Oh, hallelujah. Elijah,
[1:11:19] he said, "Go get," he said, he didn't
[1:11:21] say, "Get some of those vessels and
[1:11:23] borrow a lot of oil. We'll see if we can
[1:11:26] get a good sale price on it. You got to
[1:11:28] get more and pay the neighbor back and
[1:11:30] back." Just get empty vessels.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; So, tonight I'm looking for some
[1:11:36] vessels.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, we are.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; That need the Holy Ghost in it. Well,
[1:11:42] well, brother, how does that work? Well,
[1:11:45] let me just give you the more than a
[1:11:47] recipe,
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; but an inoculation.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; In Acts chapter 2.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; This will follow Jesus's
[1:11:55] sermon that he delivers in Matthew 28
[1:11:58] and then what he delivers in Mark
[1:12:00] chapter 16. Now, they couldn't do that
[1:12:03] on their own. They had showed us what
[1:12:05] they could do on their own. We talked
[1:12:07] last night about Peter denying the Lord.
[1:12:10] Your ability shows failure.
[1:12:15] And when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:12:17] come, and they were all in one accord in
[1:12:20] one place, and suddenly there came a
[1:12:22] sound from heaven, as of a mighty
[1:12:24] rushing wind, and it filled all the
[1:12:27] house where they were sitting, and there
[1:12:29] appeared unto them clothed in tongue,
[1:12:31] like as a fire, as it set upon each of
[1:12:32] them, and they were all filled with the
[1:12:35] Holy Ghost. Brother Brandham said, "Even
[1:12:38] Mary,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; right? Right.
[1:12:41] Even Mary, for a for lack of a better
[1:12:44] term, the mother of Jesus was in this.
[1:12:47] And he said, "If Mary had to have the
[1:12:49] Holy Ghost,
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; you'll have to get the Holy Ghost
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; and begin to speak with other tongues as
[1:13:00] the spirit gave them utterance." Verse
[1:13:02] 36, Peter being the spokesman of the
[1:13:05] church that day. And he said,
[1:13:08] "Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[1:13:09] know assuredly
[1:13:11] that God hath made that same Jesus."
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Whom ye hath crucified,
[1:13:19] both Lord and Christ. Amen.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Now when they heard this,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; they were pricricked in their heart and
[1:13:28] said unto Peter and to the rest of the
[1:13:30] apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall
[1:13:34] we do?" I'm taking time right here.
[1:13:37] Maybe this is the first time you've ever
[1:13:39] walked into a tent meeting like this
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; and you feel this presence and you know
[1:13:43] that there's something real about this
[1:13:46] and you say, "Brother Ron, what must I
[1:13:48] do? It's the same and it's never
[1:13:51] changed.
[1:13:53] Man has tried to change the recipe and
[1:13:56] only produce death,
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; but it has never changed since day one.
[1:14:03] Repent.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; That's not sorry that I got caught.
[1:14:11] That's repent
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; and turn away.
[1:14:17] I am done with that devil that I have
[1:14:20] beencome a slave to all of these years
[1:14:23] and I have been behind prison doors all
[1:14:26] of these years. I am done with him.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; A lot of reason people don't overcome
[1:14:33] filthy habits is because they're still
[1:14:35] in love with that demon
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; and they have a love affair with that
[1:14:41] demon. If you can ever come to a spot to
[1:14:44] where the devil is your enemy
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; and you refuse to live another day with
[1:14:51] him,
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; too many people want the pastor to
[1:15:00] counsel devils out of our lives.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Devil's in for a real rough night. too
[1:15:10] many times want the pastor to cough or
[1:15:12] breathe or lay his hands on us.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. We can cast
[1:15:17] out devils, but you got to keep them
[1:15:19] off.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; We're commissioned to cast him off.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; But I have learned a long time ago, you
[1:15:26] don't negotiate with devils.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; There is no room to negotiate with him.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; You allow him to move in your life.
[1:15:40] Sometimes we just stop for a moment like
[1:15:42] that little Saunders girl did. Stop to
[1:15:44] live the just listen to the music just a
[1:15:47] little bit and all of the sudden we get
[1:15:50] we get
[1:15:52] just literally so involved until we find
[1:15:54] ourselves in the arms of another man.
[1:16:01] That can be a website.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; That can be the wrong kind of a voice.
[1:16:07] Some of those voices will tell you, you
[1:16:08] know, it's not that hard.
[1:16:11] You, you know, you don't have to be that
[1:16:13] fanatical.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Our church, you can cut your hair.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; You can wear pants.
[1:16:24] You don't have to have a closed line
[1:16:26] religion.
[1:16:29] So, they present to you an easier way.
[1:16:37] I like it when the devil's right square
[1:16:38] in the crosshairs.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Before long, the token of our home
[1:16:51] becomes things that we settle with.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Prayer is absent.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Listen to the tapes is absent.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Reading our Bibles become absent.
[1:17:04] As a matter of fact, it's difficult to
[1:17:06] get to church.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Let me just say church don't start at
[1:17:13] church. It starts at home.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; A victorious overcomer, a hero that we
[1:17:19] can talk about don't just accidentally
[1:17:21] happen, but they have become committed
[1:17:24] to the cause of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; You guys may not want me to preach
[1:17:30] tomorrow night, but here I am.
[1:17:37] So, Satan presents us an easier way.
[1:17:42] He will offer even Jesus a kingdom
[1:17:45] without a Calvary.
[1:17:49] Now, so he will offer you
[1:17:52] believe in this message without a new
[1:17:54] birth.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; But I want to say this to you. You can
[1:18:02] hand out a million tracks. If you don't
[1:18:04] have a new birth,
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Y,
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; you've missed the whole purpose.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; It's got to be life inside of here.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; We got to see more than books and tapes
[1:18:19] and pictures on a wall. I want to see
[1:18:22] life.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Cuz books and tapes and pictures on the
[1:18:26] wall does not scare the devil.
[1:18:31] But Peter's standing there and says,
[1:18:32] "Repent
[1:18:34] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:18:37] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:18:40] of sins." And let me just say this to
[1:18:42] you. If you have not been baptized in
[1:18:44] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, your
[1:18:47] sins have not been remitted.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; And you shall receive the gift of the
[1:18:55] Holy Ghost.
[1:18:58] For this promise is unto you and to your
[1:19:01] children, and to all that are a far off,
[1:19:04] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:19:06] call." And brother Brandham said, "And
[1:19:09] he's still calling."
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; And he's still calling.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; I can hear Belgium say, "He's still
[1:19:23] calling." Yeah.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; I received a testimony today of what's
[1:19:29] happened in your home. I don't know how
[1:19:31] I didn't get that mail, but I received a
[1:19:33] testimony, Sister Connie, and I just had
[1:19:35] a oldfashioned shout right there in the
[1:19:38] room.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. Us as moms
[1:19:41] and dads cannot hold our children. But
[1:19:44] if he comes on the scene,
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; if he comes on the scene,
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; a greater than Solomon is here.
[1:19:54] And listen, he's the same yesterday,
[1:19:57] today, and forever.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? 2 Timothy 4 and verse
[1:20:06] one. I charge thee, but therefore before
[1:20:09] God in the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
[1:20:11] judge the quick of the dead of at his
[1:20:13] appearing of his kingdom? Preach the
[1:20:15] word. Be instant in season and out of
[1:20:18] season. Reprove, rebuke, exhort with all
[1:20:21] longsuffering and doctrine. For the time
[1:20:25] will come when they will not endure
[1:20:28] sound doctrine. We are there.
[1:20:33] But after their own lust heap to
[1:20:35] themselves teachers having itching ears,
[1:20:38] and they shall turn away their ears from
[1:20:41] the truth, and they shall turn be turned
[1:20:43] unto fables.
[1:20:45] But watch,
[1:20:47] thou in all things endure afflictions,
[1:20:51] do the work of an evangelist, make
[1:20:53] proof, full proof of my minis, of thy
[1:20:55] ministry. For, watch how he says it. For
[1:20:59] I am now ready to be offered.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; boy. I I have looked at those words over
[1:21:07] and over again. I am now ready.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; What a spot.
[1:21:16] What a spot. I am now ready
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; to be offered. And at the time at the
[1:21:25] time of my departure is at hand. I have
[1:21:28] fought a good fight. Yes, sir.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; I have finished my course.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; I have kept the faith. Henceforth there
[1:21:35] is laid up for me a crown of
[1:21:37] righteousness
[1:21:39] which the Lord, the righteous judge,
[1:21:43] shall give me at that day. Not to me
[1:21:46] only.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Not to me only.
[1:21:52] But unto them also that love his
[1:21:57] appearing.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; He's talking about me.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Preacher.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; He's talking about me.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; I find myself in the scriptures.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13.
[1:22:23] I'll never forget this. This is one of
[1:22:25] the first sermons I heard your brother
[1:22:29] Tom preach.
[1:22:32] Brethren,
[1:22:34] I count not myself to have apprehended.
[1:22:38] But this one thing that I do sir,
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; forgetting those things which are behind
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; you can do absolutely nothing
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; about yesterday
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; but ask God to forgive you.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's just forgive you for the
[1:23:03] neglect. Yeah.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's forgive you for sherking your
[1:23:07] responsibility.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's forgive you for not giving
[1:23:11] your all.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for not being committed
[1:23:19] enough.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; God help us not to waste our time.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; God help us not to waste our time. Just
[1:23:27] shake yourself right now.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; God help us not to waste our time.
[1:23:32] Paul could say it, I am now ready.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; I am now ready. I'm ready. When they
[1:23:38] come to take my head off, I'm ready.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for shouting. Do you
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; I'm so excited. I feel like I just bust
[1:23:47] out of myself.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Forgetting those things which are
[1:23:54] behind.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my God,
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Ron. But I'm scarred by my history. I'm
[1:24:01] scarred by my faults and my failures.
[1:24:03] I'm scarred by the weaknesses that I
[1:24:05] have succumbed to.
[1:24:09] Well, let me tell you what God thinks
[1:24:11] about that.
[1:24:13] God so loved you,
[1:24:16] he provided a blood
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; that would wash that completely away.
[1:24:22] And that blood would be so powerful till
[1:24:26] even an infinite God that can count all
[1:24:29] the gnats and the chiggers and the flies
[1:24:33] that could knows how round this world
[1:24:35] is. How many people's ever lived on the
[1:24:37] earth, how many hairs that they had on
[1:24:40] their head,
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; every dimple in the chin
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; knows how many horses has been on the
[1:24:46] earth. how much hair that they've had.
[1:24:49] That God cannot even find your sins.
[1:24:54] Hallelujah.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Don't point me to my mistakes. Don't
[1:25:04] point one another to your failures. Quit
[1:25:07] digging up your own bones.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Quit digging your own bones up. Quit
[1:25:14] digging up your old failures. Quit
[1:25:17] digging that up.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Quit walking around like some scarred
[1:25:26] human being. You got work to do.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Get up and go to work.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry about what you've been
[1:25:36] through. Get up.
[1:25:40] Get up.
[1:25:42] Get up.
[1:25:45] We got war to take care of. The fight is
[1:25:48] on.
[1:25:54] Glory
[1:25:59] to God.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure you can point out somebody
[1:26:05] that's been publicly known,
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; but what about you, secret sinner?
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; They have found you on sites that you
[1:26:13] shouldn't have been on.
[1:26:17] I knew that quietened the enemy.
[1:26:25] We were taught by a prophet of God to
[1:26:27] kick out the television,
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; but he but the enemy pulled one over on
[1:26:31] us.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; And we don't need a 51 in screen now. We
[1:26:35] got a four.
[1:26:42] We talk about television and all its
[1:26:45] things, but it's censored.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; But there's websites that takes you to
[1:26:50] places.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; I find it amazing all of the
[1:26:54] advertisements that come up in the news.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; And sometimes I bow my head and say,
[1:27:00] "God, forgive me for even looking at the
[1:27:02] news.
[1:27:07] Come on, church.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Satan will rob you of your victory.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Now, let me let me just say this to you.
[1:27:18] So many times, we want to blame the
[1:27:22] teacher.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Follow me just a moment.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; We want to blame the teacher for our
[1:27:27] children's failures.
[1:27:31] Our
[1:27:35] child has not turned out to be a
[1:27:36] scientist or a doctor, a lawyer or a
[1:27:39] great engineer. And we want to blame
[1:27:42] those sorry outfit teachers
[1:27:47] for their failure
[1:27:50] of giving not giving enough attention to
[1:27:54] our individual children.
[1:28:02] You get a report card. It tells you
[1:28:04] progression, right?
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; And it begins to talk about what you've
[1:28:07] done for them the month.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; My daughter's a teacher.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; I'd say she's a good teacher,
[1:28:16] but there are times that when she comes
[1:28:18] home and she comes over to the house, I
[1:28:21] can just see it on her
[1:28:26] and I I can see that she's had a bad
[1:28:28] day.
[1:28:30] So I just take her and I hug her and I
[1:28:32] begin to pray for her. Pray that God
[1:28:35] would just st her, minister to her. God
[1:28:38] gave her the gift and the opportunity to
[1:28:40] do what she is doing to be a blessing to
[1:28:43] multitudes of children. And she'll guide
[1:28:45] them. She'll be a light to them in a
[1:28:47] very dark age.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; But I remind her that one bad apple
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; is not to distract her. right
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; from teaching the entire class.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to rehearse this before
[1:29:05] this whole world and say it.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Men of God
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; one bad apple
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; that is all about their self that
[1:29:20] refuses to overcome their pet devils
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; is not worth wasting your ministry for.
[1:29:27] Hallelujah.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; He's seen it before.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; I heard brother David this morning as he
[1:29:50] began to preach on boys becoming
[1:29:52] sissies.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Absolutely true.
[1:29:56] Absolutely true.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Now listen, I'm a real man and God must
[1:30:01] have took all the dainty out of me.
[1:30:08] But when I go to buy a suit or go to buy
[1:30:10] a dress shirt
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; and they have went away from the classic
[1:30:16] fit
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; that it takes real men to get their gut
[1:30:25] in.
[1:30:31] I don't want my navl showing.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; I need to be able to breathe while I'm
[1:30:38] preaching.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; I want a real man's shirt.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; I don't want my pants so tight. You can
[1:30:50] see my knees sweating.
[1:31:01] Come on, church.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Well, that's just the way the new
[1:31:06] fashions are that's taking us forward
[1:31:09] before a a feminist men. God's calling
[1:31:13] for real men.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about the muscles in
[1:31:19] your arms. I'm talking about the scars
[1:31:22] that's on your knees.
[1:31:26] Hallelujah.
[1:31:27] I believe there's young men in this
[1:31:29] building that can go on their knees and
[1:31:32] shake the kingdoms of hell.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; We are committed.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; I heard brother David talk. I'm blame on
[1:31:46] you, brother David.
[1:31:49] I heard brother David talk about hair
[1:31:51] dos and hairstyles.
[1:31:53] Before long, we're using more gel than
[1:31:55] all the girls do.
[1:32:02] We got hairs.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; We got colors.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; We gave her an imaginal fix.
[1:32:14] Before long, we bring it to church and
[1:32:16] say, "Acept me as I am. I'm sorry.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; We are not a bunch of compromisers.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; But God's calling for real men.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; In the charismatic realm, they have what
[1:32:35] they call promisekeeper conventions.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Where men gather and they they make a
[1:32:41] promise. I'm going to be a better daddy
[1:32:42] and I'm going to be a I'm going to be a
[1:32:44] better father and I I I'm going to be a
[1:32:47] better Christian and I'm going to be a
[1:32:48] better provider at the church and I'm
[1:32:50] going to do my part only to come home
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; and to repeat the process over and over
[1:32:55] again when Jesus came to Legion.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:03] Let me just say he came a long way and
[1:33:05] there was some supernatural things that
[1:33:07] happened on his way to get to Legion.
[1:33:10] But he had one man on his mind to get
[1:33:12] to. He's came to you tonight.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Paul would say it.
[1:33:27] I will repeat it, but I want you to look
[1:33:30] at it tonight. forgetting those things
[1:33:32] which are behind.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Forget them.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Forget them. Your enemy will never
[1:33:40] forget it.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; People that are against you will never
[1:33:43] forget it.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; But you're not that person no more.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on now.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; So many people come late in life.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Is this all right? I I don't even I I
[1:33:57] didn't look what time I started. So you
[1:33:59] ought to help me.
[1:34:02] So many people are late bloomers in our
[1:34:04] lives, late enemies in our lives only to
[1:34:08] point at our past failures.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say this to you. I was
[1:34:15] a drug addict.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; I was identified with that. I was a
[1:34:24] horrible person to be around.
[1:34:27] But this may look like the house that
[1:34:30] that man lived in.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; This might look like the house that he
[1:34:38] lived in, but that man don't live here
[1:34:42] no more.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know how you came to camp, but I
[1:34:55] want to say this to you. If there's a
[1:34:56] transformation that can happen in your
[1:34:58] life, what you have struggled with last
[1:35:00] week, you don't have to struggle with it
[1:35:02] no more.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; I have done preached too many years now
[1:35:08] to know that I have watched prostitute
[1:35:10] after prostitute after prostitute walk
[1:35:12] into tents like this and walk into
[1:35:15] churches, sat down in a pew, and the
[1:35:17] spirit of God called them and they never
[1:35:20] return to that ever again.
[1:35:22] Amen.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Sitting in our church is six
[1:35:27] cheerleaders that were worldly
[1:35:29] cheerleaders that found their way into
[1:35:31] our church. They don't look the same no
[1:35:34] more. They don't act the same no more.
[1:35:37] They are not the same no more.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Old things are passed away.
[1:35:46] Behold, all things become new.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:56] Paul said, "I press toward the mark for
[1:36:02] the high for the prize of the high
[1:36:04] calling which is in God in Christ
[1:36:07] Jesus." Listen to the prophet of God.
[1:36:10] Give me a preacher.
[1:36:12] Give me a Christian. Yes, sir.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Give me a housewife that's a Christian.
[1:36:16] Give me a farmer or a factory worker
[1:36:20] that'll put God first in everything.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say it with me? Everything.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; I'll show you a man that'll be
[1:36:29] successful in spite of all that the
[1:36:32] devil can put on him.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, you don't have to buy
[1:36:40] another book on how to be successful.
[1:36:46] You don't have to check out nothing else
[1:36:47] from Amazon on how to be successful.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; God will provide you a job that you
[1:36:54] never thought was attainable for you.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; God is the best banker that you can ever
[1:36:59] have. He is the best real estate broker
[1:37:02] that you can ever have. He is the best
[1:37:04] marriage counselor that you can ever
[1:37:06] have.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You don't have to find
[1:37:12] 52 books on communication between a man
[1:37:14] and a woman. Men are from Mars and women
[1:37:17] women are from Venus. You just need to
[1:37:19] fall in love with God.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. And Jesus Christ came
[1:37:36] down from heaven to glory
[1:37:39] down here to build a church.
[1:37:41] And the material that he's putting in it
[1:37:43] to it is a time-t tested material.
[1:37:47] You might come to the altar and make a
[1:37:49] confession, but when he finds blow holes
[1:37:52] and everything else in there where the
[1:37:54] world's blown the maggots into you and
[1:37:56] so forth, you cannot stand.
[1:37:58] He just pitches you to one side. God
[1:38:01] wants a timetested
[1:38:04] church.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Not somebody that's a Christian today
[1:38:09] and a backslider tomorrow
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; and it's in and out and up and down it.
[1:38:14] He can't place you nowhere. But he's got
[1:38:17] a church that's tested, that's went
[1:38:20] through trials, through losses, through
[1:38:23] sicknesses,
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; with a testimony.
[1:38:26] That's the man. That's the man that he's
[1:38:30] looking for.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, God help us.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus looking upon them said, "With men
[1:38:42] it is impossible."
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; But with God all things.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:38:55] are possible. The prophet of God said,
[1:38:57] "I'm so glad that there is a 10,000
[1:39:00] octane power, the word of God and the
[1:39:03] Holy Ghost to light it up to resurrect
[1:39:05] the power of God into a man's life or a
[1:39:08] woman's life or into a church that he he
[1:39:11] said that shoved that Cadillac down the
[1:39:13] road yonder under the dynamic power of
[1:39:15] the Holy Ghost which came back and was
[1:39:17] waved over the people at the day of
[1:39:19] Pentecost, making them the same
[1:39:21] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:39:25] There has got to come one. There has
[1:39:27] there has been churches churches and
[1:39:30] brides brides and churches and brides
[1:39:33] bride. But there's got to come one.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; I believe she's here.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for her. I believe I'm
[1:39:42] preaching to you.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; I believe that, brother Ken.
[1:39:58] watching
[1:40:00] 1965. A lot of what people would like to
[1:40:02] excuse this quote. It's real difficult
[1:40:04] to do. Invisible union of the bride. A
[1:40:09] true picture of the modern church today.
[1:40:12] Neither does the modern church want any
[1:40:14] of them these years. Screaming,
[1:40:17] shouting, tongue speaking. Acts 2:38,
[1:40:20] young ones around her.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; See? Yeah.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Brother kind of. Yeah. Self right there.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz he can see where the church is
[1:40:31] going. Even Pentecost is going. Even the
[1:40:34] church that he was preaching in was
[1:40:36] going.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; They're becoming just dead morgs.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; She don't wanted them whooping and
[1:40:45] crying and screaming.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Now, let me just say this to
[1:40:50] you. This is more than about a birth.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; There's times that we need a
[1:40:55] breakthrough.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; We need to break through in our homes.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, we need a revival in
[1:41:04] our church. What about a revival in your
[1:41:06] home?
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; I'm calling to you tonight. We're
[1:41:10] challenged to finish this race.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; We're challenged. This is more than this
[1:41:16] is more than just for the preachers.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Moms and dads and young people. Listen,
[1:41:21] if your mom and dad don't serve the
[1:41:23] Lord, it's no excuse for us tonight.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; I believe that we can so pray and so be
[1:41:28] so power packed that our moms and dads
[1:41:31] will come in.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care what religion they are. I
[1:41:36] believe that God can break the chains
[1:41:38] off of their lives.
[1:41:42] The God that's in this building can
[1:41:44] break those chains and break those
[1:41:47] prison doors.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; There can be such a presence in your
[1:41:52] home and in your life till when your
[1:41:55] friends come in, they can feel that holy
[1:41:57] presence of God that you have been
[1:42:00] talking to him.
[1:42:11] Brother Ron, you're preaching like a
[1:42:12] chip on your shoulder. Yep. I sure am.
[1:42:16] I'm tired of people that want to argue
[1:42:19] quotes and can't live the life.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of people that want to be
[1:42:25] critics and can't live the life.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Onward Christian soldiers.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Onward Christian soldiers.
[1:42:35] born with Christian soldiers marching as
[1:42:38] to war.
[1:42:45] Wow. Such a child
[1:42:48] would would immediately be put out of
[1:42:50] their denomination.
[1:42:52] They had one like that in the churches.
[1:42:55] Well, they throw her out real quick. Why
[1:42:57] you letting such a thous go on? You see,
[1:43:01] she's pregnantated with something cuz
[1:43:04] she's bringing forth members all the
[1:43:05] time.
[1:43:07] But she don't want them none of them
[1:43:09] screaming, hollering, blabbering Acts
[1:43:12] 2:38 miserable creatures that she thinks
[1:43:15] they are. It would certainly embarrass
[1:43:17] her and it would ruin her educated,
[1:43:20] ethical, scientific society church that
[1:43:24] she belonged to here. They would throw
[1:43:26] her out at the next council. She can't
[1:43:30] have it. She don't want to be
[1:43:32] impregnated with the word because that's
[1:43:35] the only kind that the word can bring
[1:43:39] forth.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; That's the only kind.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; The scripture said, "By their fruit
[1:43:48] you'll know them."
[1:43:51] So if you can look back at your life and
[1:43:53] realize it's not you that's living,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; it's him that's living.
[1:44:00] If stop and evaluate the music
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; that is being played from your life.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Help me preach just a few more minutes.
[1:44:16] Now
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; we blame the teachers.
[1:44:23] And you thought I left that subject, but
[1:44:25] I thought I'd bring it to right here. We
[1:44:28] want to bring preachers for our
[1:44:30] problems.
[1:44:34] But you see, men of God can only be
[1:44:36] directed by the Holy Spirit
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; to deliver the word of God in the hour.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Men of God many times don't know what's
[1:44:44] going in your home,
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; but he does. So by the discernment of
[1:44:48] the spirit of God through the word of
[1:44:50] God, he will begin to give you one
[1:44:52] sentence after another that attaches to
[1:44:54] you.
[1:44:56] Now you can say who told
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; somebody's been gossiping
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; or maybe that man knows and so he's
[1:45:03] picking on you.
[1:45:05] Well, let me just say somewhere you
[1:45:07] ought to take responsibility.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Look at what your children are
[1:45:13] producing.
[1:45:15] Look at the relationship with your
[1:45:17] husband and your wife.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Wow, you're a quiet group.
[1:45:30] Look, look, look at it.
[1:45:36] Look at your life.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Take responsibility of your life.
[1:45:42] Take responsibility.
[1:45:47] I don't think I told this last night,
[1:45:48] but I think I told it in Edmonton
[1:45:52] a few weeks ago. We were we were away
[1:45:55] with our family for a few days. I think
[1:45:57] it was four days. We was away with our
[1:46:00] family
[1:46:01] and we were gathered in a breakfast area
[1:46:03] and all of our family, our children
[1:46:05] would come around and they would hug me
[1:46:06] and
[1:46:08] you know it was just a normal day. They
[1:46:11] would hug me.
[1:46:13] My babies would tell call me papa.
[1:46:17] They'd tell me they love me and I'd tell
[1:46:18] them I love them and my children would
[1:46:21] was around us and we was talking
[1:46:22] backwards and forwards talking about the
[1:46:24] daily events and and we were just kind
[1:46:27] of just rehearsing backwards and
[1:46:29] forwards. We were there for about 40
[1:46:31] minutes every morning.
[1:46:33] One morning I didn't walk up the steps
[1:46:35] with Sister Connie and the rest of the
[1:46:36] family. I got on an elevator.
[1:46:39] I got on the elevator. I got on the
[1:46:40] elevator with a man that was a had a
[1:46:43] walker and he was very nice dressed man
[1:46:46] and he he looked at me and he backed up
[1:46:49] against the back wall of the elevator
[1:46:52] looked at me and said, "Could I speak to
[1:46:53] you just a moment?" I said, "Sure."
[1:46:57] He said, "I want to I want to
[1:46:59] congratulate you
[1:47:01] and I want to commend you on the family
[1:47:03] that you have."
[1:47:09] He said, "You're to be honored.
[1:47:12] You're to you're a blessed man."
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; You're to be commended and congratulated
[1:47:18] for having that kind of an atmosphere
[1:47:21] with your family.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; I said, "Thank you, sir." I said,
[1:47:28] "That's no accident.
[1:47:32] knows that
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; that's no accident.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; I don't tell our children, "All right,
[1:47:40] now let's behave because we're in
[1:47:41] public."
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; I definitely don't tell my little grand
[1:47:46] and grand how to behave in front of
[1:47:48] Popo. Don't embarrass Paulo. Now, that's
[1:47:51] just life.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Just real life.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Real life.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; That's real love. It's no make love.
[1:47:57] It's a This isn't artificial. This is
[1:48:00] real.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; This message that I have believed all my
[1:48:04] life, that I've had a passion for, it
[1:48:08] lives every day.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; It lives. I want to share this with you
[1:48:15] tonight. It lives.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; It didn't start two weeks ago. It
[1:48:23] started years ago in our lives.
[1:48:27] Now,
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; don't you point your poison darts at me
[1:48:29] and try to throw a fire. It's your fault
[1:48:31] if you don't have that.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; You need to take responsibility.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Listen, and I want to give you the
[1:48:41] answer for it. It's on your knees.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; It's on your knees.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; I turned to the man and I said,
[1:48:57] "My name is Ron Spencer. That don't
[1:48:59] probably don't mean nothing to you, but
[1:49:01] may I ask you your name?" And he told me
[1:49:03] his name. I said, "What do you do in
[1:49:06] life?" He said, "Well, I'm retired now."
[1:49:10] And he said, "Some of them call me the
[1:49:12] president of the University of
[1:49:14] Tennessee."
[1:49:16] something.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; And he said these words to me,
[1:49:21] "Of all of my life, I've never seen a
[1:49:24] family like that."
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Marvelous. Marvelous.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; That's what this message produces.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:49:45] That's what this message produces.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; It does.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; That's what this atmosphere produces.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; That's what this Jesus that's among us
[1:49:53] produces.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; That's what that produces.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; We were leaving the same day
[1:50:04] and we were putting our bags in the car.
[1:50:09] We went out the door together. So
[1:50:11] happened we went out the door together
[1:50:14] and he looked at me and he shook my hand
[1:50:16] and he said, "It's been an honor
[1:50:19] to be with you this week."
[1:50:23] And his wife walked up to me and she
[1:50:25] began to talk to me. She said, "You have
[1:50:28] moved my husband."
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; She began to share some words to me that
[1:50:37] was very nice.
[1:50:41] And I just looked at her and I said, "It
[1:50:42] was Jesus."
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; it was Jesus.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; That's what produces.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; I just feel it just kind of
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; just come to a spot here just now.
[1:51:10] I don't know where you're at in your
[1:51:12] life,
[1:51:15] but he's come in this building
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; in this place.
[1:51:19] And I've become very aware in the last
[1:51:21] few moments that he's dealing with souls
[1:51:23] all across this building.
[1:51:27] And the best that I know about this
[1:51:29] convention is not about preaching to you
[1:51:31] mysteries.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; The greatest mystery that you can have
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; is to have him
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; living inside of you.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; I believe it's more than the disciples
[1:51:48] being commissioned or your preacher
[1:51:50] being commissioned. But now you and I
[1:51:53] have a mandate. Yeah.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; If the prophet of God said, "Oh, how we
[1:51:59] need in Jeffersonville tonight thousands
[1:52:01] of live voices."
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean for us to move to
[1:52:04] Jeffersonville.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; But what about where you're at?
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; You've got a sacred responsibility where
[1:52:12] you're at, on your street, in your
[1:52:14] neighborhood, in your schools.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; In your community, on your job.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; To witness. Yeah.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; To witness
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; to witness.
[1:52:28] And your life is the greatest witness
[1:52:32] that you can possibly have.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; I didn't give a man the track or I
[1:52:36] didn't give him a book.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; I presented him a life.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; I've led literally thousands of people
[1:52:46] to Christ. But one of the greatest ways
[1:52:49] to lead people to this Jesus is for him
[1:52:52] to live.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; That's why people call brother Brandham
[1:52:59] God is because he so surrendered himself
[1:53:03] unto God
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; until they couldn't see the man anymore.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, that we could be guilty of that.
[1:53:13] Amen.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Legion came home
[1:53:30] clothed and in his right mind.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells us that he became
[1:53:36] a real family man.
[1:53:40] Amen.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know what you did
[1:53:45] yesterday, and I don't care.
[1:53:51] I don't want to know.
[1:53:54] But all I know is God commissioned me
[1:53:55] this afternoon to walk to this pull pit
[1:53:59] to challenge you with what you'll do
[1:54:01] with tonight and tomorrow
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; and the next day and the next day. We
[1:54:08] don't have a minute to waste.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe this has not ended like you
[1:54:18] thought it would.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; But now it becomes your turn.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; You see
[1:54:29] a director all he can do is present the
[1:54:32] music.
[1:54:36] Right.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; The music is not negotiable.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; But it's your responsibility to play.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; And if it's the triangle,
[1:54:49] be the best triangle
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; that you can possibly be.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; I have a man in my church that stands
[1:55:00] about that tall.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; He considers me a very tall man.
[1:55:05] I love that man.
[1:55:17] He may never hear this sermon.
[1:55:21] His name is Roy.
[1:55:25] Royy's a real Christian.
[1:55:29] He's a real Christian.
[1:55:33] Roy many years ago. He's never been a
[1:55:36] deacon.
[1:55:38] He's never been a trustee. He's never
[1:55:40] been an officer of the church,
[1:55:43] but he's my friend.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:46] He's become our custodian of the church,
[1:55:51] lives on the property,
[1:55:55] but Roy
[1:55:57] many, many years ago
[1:56:00] took up a job of open the door for
[1:56:02] everybody at church.
[1:56:08] And he said, "Every person that walks
[1:56:10] into this church needs to be greeted
[1:56:12] with a smile."
[1:56:15] Amen.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Because that's the best sermon that can
[1:56:18] be presented.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Is that no matter what you are in life
[1:56:25] that when you come to this church,
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; the first thing that you can see is a
[1:56:31] life.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Roy would be very embarrassed if he knew
[1:56:37] that I was calling his name tonight. But
[1:56:40] somewhere in the great eternities
[1:56:43] Amen.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; I can hear the great prophet of God say,
[1:56:49] "If it's to be the doormat, I want to be
[1:56:51] the best doormat that I can be."
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Let it live.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Let it live.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Let it live.
[1:57:07] Hallelujah.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; I don't know what your position is in
[1:57:10] life, whether you're the door greeter
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; or what you are,
[1:57:17] but I have preached to little women that
[1:57:20] hardly whispered an amen,
[1:57:23] but they could pull on the gift of God
[1:57:25] so incredible it feels like you're
[1:57:27] preaching just to them.
[1:57:31] just sitting rock under the Holy Ghost
[1:57:35] and you just know that they've been in
[1:57:37] contact with Jesus Christ.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; They're kind of like a woman that says,
[1:57:42] "Where is my Elijah at?"
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; And God comes on the scene for them.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; I know you've had a difficult day.
[1:57:56] You've climbed mountains.
[1:57:58] You've did something that I have
[1:57:59] difficult to do. You've got on water.
[1:58:02] You've canoed paddles. Paddle canoes.
[1:58:10] I like water. It's in a shower.
[1:58:15] Or to drink it. I've been invited to a
[1:58:18] really nice fishing trip and it'll take
[1:58:20] God and and 40 angels to be with me to
[1:58:23] go on that fishing trip.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:31] But God knows where we're sitting at
[1:58:33] today.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; So I want to pause and I hear the
[1:58:40] prophet of God say, "Stay in line."
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; I hear him scream, "Stay in line.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Stay in line. Stay in line.
[1:58:52] Stay in line, little pride." Amen.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; That's not 1964, 1965. That's now.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Stay in line.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Stay in line. This is finishing.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; I want to finish.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just start strong and
[1:59:09] run strong. I want to finish.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; I don't want to give out. I don't want
[1:59:14] to come to the end and just give up.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; I want to finish.
[1:59:21] Anybody can start out and run a little
[1:59:23] while.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Anybody can get some momentum from one
[1:59:26] another. But it's finishing the course.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; I want to finish.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Now just pause and just reflect for a
[1:59:44] moment.
[1:59:46] Stop blaming somebody else.
[1:59:53] Stop looking at your own faults and
[1:59:55] failures for a little bit and put it
[1:59:56] under the blood of Jesus.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Come to a place that you can pray, "Our
[2:00:02] Father, which art in heaven,
[2:00:06] hallowed be thy name.
[2:00:09] Thy kingdom come,
[2:00:12] thy will be done.
[2:00:18] Brother Ron, this service has not been
[2:00:20] so deep really
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; for you
[2:00:28] in your mind's eye. I have just preached
[2:00:32] your life story.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; I have just preached your life story.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you,
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; how are you running?
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:48] How are you doing?
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; It's not about what we used to do.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; It's about what you're doing right now.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Look at yourself.
[2:01:01] How committed really are you?
[2:01:05] Are you letting other things get in your
[2:01:07] way? Now, school is fine. It's got its
[2:01:11] place. Jobs are fine. They've got their
[2:01:14] place.
[2:01:15] Businesses are fine. They got their
[2:01:17] place. Hobbies are fine. They got their
[2:01:19] place. But anything that gets between
[2:01:22] you and God,
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Becomes idolatry.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Can I give you one more statement? And I
[2:01:33] hope it don't make nobody mad. Billions
[2:01:36] of dollars are spent
[2:01:39] on how to eat right and lose weight.
[2:01:44] Yeah.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Feel a spirit all over this building
[2:01:49] now.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; But 99.9%
[2:01:57] of us
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; feed our own self.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; I have been married.
[2:02:11] I'm not an idiot.
[2:02:14] 30 some years.
[2:02:19] Oh, brother Tim, that's easy for you to
[2:02:21] do.
[2:02:24] 30 some years. And but my wife only but
[2:02:28] just a short period of my life fed me.
[2:02:31] It was during that period where I was
[2:02:33] burned and my hands wouldn't work. I
[2:02:36] lost weight.
[2:02:58] But you see, I have to take
[2:02:59] responsibility of what I eat.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I thought you was
[2:03:05] finishing. I have and you just don't
[2:03:06] realize it
[2:03:11] because you've got to take
[2:03:12] responsibility of what you eat
[2:03:14] spiritually.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; You got to take responsibility what you
[2:03:23] eat. Yes.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you tonight as we
[2:03:30] come to the close of this service,
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; have you been blaming other people for
[2:03:36] your spot where you're at?
[2:03:40] Have you been committed like you should
[2:03:41] be committed?
[2:03:45] It's easy to go with the flow.
[2:03:48] It's easy to become part of a church and
[2:03:51] be part of a community of a church and
[2:03:54] just kind of fall in line. It's easy to
[2:03:57] be conformed to all of this.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; But what about your personal
[2:04:01] transformation with Jesus Christ?
[2:04:06] We can talk about what we have done, but
[2:04:08] what are we going to do?
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Maybe let's bow your head just now.
[2:04:21] I wrote a statement down to end this
[2:04:23] with today. I want to lay aside every
[2:04:26] weight and the sin was just so easily
[2:04:28] beset me.
[2:04:33] And I want to be more determined than
[2:04:35] ever before in my life.
[2:04:39] I want to be more determined than ever
[2:04:42] before in my life.
[2:04:47] How many could say, "Brother Ron,
[2:04:50] I really, really needed that tonight."
[2:04:54] Hands, hands before God. Hands before
[2:04:58] God. I really I really needed that
[2:05:00] tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[2:05:04] you. Thank you. I really needed that
[2:05:07] tonight.
[2:05:09] Brother Ron, I I just need deliverance
[2:05:11] in my life. I just I I personally just
[2:05:14] need deliverance in my life. Won't you
[2:05:16] just raise your hand to him just now?
[2:05:19] Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[2:05:23] Thank you. Thank you.
[2:05:27] I want to make a challenge to you
[2:05:28] tonight. It's a challenge to finish.
[2:05:32] You've sat for quite a while listening
[2:05:34] to me preach, but now it's your turn.
[2:05:41] Maybe you just like to stand to your
[2:05:42] feet just now with the hands that's been
[2:05:44] raised and say, "Brother Ron, I'm
[2:05:46] determined.
[2:05:51] This message tonight's going to change
[2:05:53] my life.
[2:05:57] This message tonight's going to change
[2:05:59] my life.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; I've heard powerful sermons, but
[2:06:02] tonight, this message
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; has asked me to take personal
[2:06:06] responsibility.
[2:06:09] And I want him to have an open channel
[2:06:10] to draw to me. I want to get it
[2:06:13] unclogged. I I want to get everything
[2:06:14] unclogged out of my life.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; I want to lay aside some weights in my
[2:06:19] life.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; I want to get rid of some shadows that's
[2:06:22] in my life. I need to get rid of some
[2:06:25] influences that's in my life.
[2:06:27] I need a proper diet spiritually in my
[2:06:30] life.
[2:06:32] And I want I want to just tonight I want
[2:06:34] him to come and change me. I want more
[2:06:37] than an emotion to change me. I want him
[2:06:39] to come.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; I want him to come and have a personal
[2:06:44] conversation with me.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; That's what he's done this afternoon.
[2:06:53] Don't let this evening be wasted.
[2:07:00] Don't let it be wasted.
[2:07:03] Just look at your life. God, what do you
[2:07:06] want to do with me?
[2:07:10] What do you want to do with me in my
[2:07:11] life? If it's to be an a manor,
[2:07:16] definitely a better prayer warrior,
[2:07:20] develop me, oh God.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Get me beyond me.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Get me beyond me.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; My job's not to speak squirrels into
[2:07:31] existence.
[2:07:33] Not to speak storms out of existence,
[2:07:35] but to get beyond myself.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; If I can have dominion over my flesh,
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; if I can get beyond my own opinions,
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; if I can get beyond my own thoughts,
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; help me Jesus.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Help me Jesus.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Help me Jesus.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Oh spirit of God, we bow our heads
[2:08:00] before you now. God,
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; like a father, you've come and talked to
[2:08:08] us.
[2:08:12] Lord, I knew in the room this afternoon
[2:08:15] when you came.
[2:08:20] There's just none like you when you
[2:08:22] come.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; How you turned this sermon, I thought it
[2:08:27] would go a complete different direction.
[2:08:28] how you turned this sermon. It's because
[2:08:31] of your care for your children.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Not just here, but around the world. You
[2:08:38] care for your children.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; And your children are struggling.
[2:08:43] They're fighting with their own selves.
[2:08:51] Oh, God.
[2:08:53] But you've walked into this building
[2:08:54] tonight.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. to let us know you're here to help.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake
[2:09:06] you.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; He was looking at disciples.
[2:09:10] Everyone but one would die.
[2:09:14] A martyr for him.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; But every one of them would leave the
[2:09:20] earth with a testimony that he lives.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:26] I don't know particularly many of us
[2:09:29] trust to make a rapture but may we leave
[2:09:32] the earth with a testimony he lived
[2:09:37] he lived in Ron Spencer
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; he lived in Ed Biscll who lived in Tom
[2:09:42] he lived in the ministry he love lived
[2:09:45] in that little woman down the street
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; oh God the greatest compliment that any
[2:09:51] of us could have
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; is I see Jesus in that individual
[2:09:56] The message lives inside of that person.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; A real humility, a real godliness.
[2:10:05] That's a real comer for overcomer. If
[2:10:07] I've ever seen one, that's a real
[2:10:09] overcomer.
[2:10:12] Satan, we bind you in the name of Jesus
[2:10:14] Christ.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; You don't have the keys to your own
[2:10:20] house.
[2:10:22] You were stripped at Calvary.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Now you take your hands off of God's
[2:10:27] children.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; You may have held them captive for many,
[2:10:31] many years. But tonight, we recognize
[2:10:34] who we are, what we've been called to
[2:10:37] do, what we've been elected and
[2:10:39] ordained.
[2:10:41] You placed us in this age, Father, to
[2:10:44] overcome this age. We'll be the final
[2:10:47] voice to the final age. You'll echo your
[2:10:50] voice out of our lives. Oh God, come and
[2:10:54] fill our hearts where we're standing
[2:10:56] right now. May the Holy Spirit permeate
[2:10:59] this tent.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; May the atmosphere of this building be
[2:11:04] charged with your presence.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:11:11] Oh, spirit of God move.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Spirit of God move in our lives.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we give you free course
[2:11:20] this afternoon.
[2:11:22] We ask you, we surrender ourselves to
[2:11:24] you tonight.
[2:11:26] We give ourselves wholeheartedly to you.
[2:11:30] We ask forgiveness, Father.
[2:11:37] Oh God,
[2:11:40] soak down in our lives just now. Go God,
[2:11:45] look at every closet of our lives.
[2:11:47] Father,
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; take anything out of us that's not like
[2:11:50] you. Every spirit of unbelief and
[2:11:54] disobedience and rebellion,
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; break those chains tonight, Father.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, Holy Ghost, break the chains of our
[2:12:03] old nature. Bring a newness in our
[2:12:06] lives.
[2:12:07] In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray.
[2:12:11] Oh God.
[2:12:14] Oh God. God. Oh God, the name of Jesus
[2:12:19] Christ.
[2:12:21] Oh God.
[2:12:23] Oh God.
[2:12:26] Now I'm going to ask your favor.
[2:12:32] I preached and sweated and
[2:12:36] I've delivered what God's laid on my
[2:12:38] heart tonight.
[2:12:41] But now it's your turn.
[2:12:44] It's not your neighbor that you can do
[2:12:46] anything about.
[2:12:48] It's not even the man that's sitting on
[2:12:50] the platform. It's you.
[2:12:54] I want you to lift your voices just now
[2:12:56] and talk to God.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Now, nobody else can do this for you but
[2:13:02] you.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; I want you to talk to him.
[2:13:10] I want you to talk to him.
[2:13:18] I want you to invite him to the chambers
[2:13:21] of your soul.
[2:13:27] I want God to meet your expectation
[2:13:29] right here tonight.
[2:13:32] Maybe it's to be a better daddy or
[2:13:34] better mama, be a better Christian.
[2:13:35] Whatever it is here tonight,
[2:13:40] won't you just go ahead and surrender?
[2:13:42] say, "I refuse to take that spirit home
[2:13:44] with me.
[2:13:46] I refuse to take this sickness home with
[2:13:48] me tonight.
[2:13:50] I refuse to worship that spirit anymore.
[2:13:55] Tonight, I am an overcomer through the
[2:13:58] blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:14:08] Oh, Holy Spirit.
[2:14:11] Hallelujah.
[2:14:12] Just invite him to where you're at now.
[2:14:17] Oh dear God, don't leave me out. Pass me
[2:14:20] not, oh gentle Savior.
[2:14:23] Hear my humble cry.
[2:14:28] Meet me here tonight, Father.
[2:14:31] Don't leave me where I'm at.
[2:14:44] Jacob said, "Oh,
[2:14:47] I'm going to hold on to you
[2:14:50] until you change me.
[2:14:54] I'm going to hold on to you until I'm no
[2:14:56] longer Jacob.
[2:14:59] I want to finish my course, but I don't
[2:15:02] want to do it as Jacob.
[2:15:07] I'm not going to let you go until you
[2:15:09] bless me.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let you go till you
[2:15:14] bless me.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:15:19] Oh God, come fill our lives.
[2:15:22] Oh God, come break through our shells
[2:15:26] tonight.
[2:15:27] Break through the barrier tonight.
[2:15:30] Break through every barrier. Through
[2:15:32] every boundary of our life tonight.
[2:15:36] Oh, break through every shell. Break
[2:15:39] through every prison door. Break through
[2:15:42] every chain tonight.
[2:15:46] Break through tonight in our lives.
[2:15:51] I refuse to go home the same way. I want
[2:15:54] more of you, Father. I just got to I got

[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; I more than promise you my life. I give
[2:16:32] you my life.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; I give you my life.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; My life is in your hands.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; I surrender my life.
[2:16:53] He's here.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; It's here to meet your need. Mighty
[2:17:05] angels among us now.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus.
[2:17:18] Oh, thank you Jesus.
[2:17:20] Oh, I thank you Jesus.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank you Jesus.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; It's me. It's me. It's me, Lord.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Hear my vocal cords, Lord, as I call out
[2:17:43] to you.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Let it break through Leotaa.
[2:17:48] Let it break through the cares of the
[2:17:50] world.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; It's me, God. I want to respond back to
[2:17:55] you, Father.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; I want to worship you in this moment. I
[2:18:00] want to lay at your feet.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; I want to lay at your feet tonight,
[2:18:06] Jesus.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:14] saturate us.
[2:18:24] Oh, just like
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; My thirsty
[2:18:35] soul.
[2:18:37] Come and fall
[2:18:40] on me.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:18:43] Feel my heart.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Invite him to where you're at.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Invite him to where you're at.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Come, Lord Jesus.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Make me whole tonight.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; I need you now.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Pour your spit
[2:19:06] out.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Let's just worship him now.
[2:19:14] Let's just worship him.
[2:19:22] Saturate
[2:19:25] my thirsty
[2:19:27] soul.
[2:19:29] Come and fall on me.
[2:19:37] I love you.
[2:19:41] Feel my heart
[2:19:44] and make me home.
[2:19:50] I need
[2:19:52] you now.
[2:19:54] Pour your spirit
[2:19:57] out.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Pour your spirit.
[2:20:01] Pour your spirit on me.
[2:20:07] All the way
[2:20:13] saturate
[2:20:16] my thirsty
[2:20:18] soul.
[2:20:20] Come and fall fresh on me.
[2:20:26] Feel my cup again.
[2:20:32] Heal my heart
[2:20:35] and make me whole.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; I need you now.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; I need
[2:20:44] you now.
[2:20:46] Pour your spit
[2:20:49] out. One more time. Just close your
[2:20:52] eyes. Lift your hands. Spirit out on me
[2:21:00] like gra
[2:21:08] my thirsty
[2:21:10] soul
[2:21:12] come and fall fresh on me.
[2:21:17] Feel my cup again.
[2:21:23] Heal my heart
[2:21:26] and make me home.
[2:21:33] I need
[2:21:35] you now
[2:21:37] for your spirit.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; I believe we can take a a moment right
[2:21:49] now. Right now. Right now.
[2:21:52] Just close your eyes
[2:21:55] and say, "Lord, I've heard from the
[2:21:58] throne of grace.
[2:22:00] I've heard God speak this evening.
[2:22:04] It has not been the instrumentality of
[2:22:07] man.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; But if you'll just be honest with your
[2:22:10] own heart tonight, I believe the word of
[2:22:14] God has sought you out.
[2:22:18] I believe that with all my heart the way
[2:22:20] the Holy Spirit moved from one side and
[2:22:23] to another side in another area, this
[2:22:26] area in that area.
[2:22:29] And if you're just willing just to open
[2:22:31] the door of your heart one time, just
[2:22:34] this one time, this one moment,
[2:22:38] God can do exceedingly and abundantly.
[2:22:40] I'm This is called the family camp. Now,
[2:22:44] we're talking about the young people
[2:22:45] that are here at the front. I know
[2:22:47] there's parents in the back that really
[2:22:48] need a touch from God.
[2:22:51] Really need a liberating move of the
[2:22:54] spirit
[2:22:56] where now it's not just church and I'm
[2:22:58] old and I don't lift up my hands and I
[2:23:01] don't I'm not a participant anymore
[2:23:03] because I I've been in this thing 30 and
[2:23:06] 40 years. Saints, it doesn't matter how
[2:23:08] long.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; A son is a son from the mind of God back
[2:23:13] to eternity. And I know in the mind of
[2:23:17] God, we praised him. I know when we go
[2:23:19] to heaven, we'll praise him. I know
[2:23:22] tonight there should be something in
[2:23:23] your heart that is willing to say,
[2:23:25] "Lord, that demon that has held me is
[2:23:29] not worth keeping me back from
[2:23:32] glorifying the God of glory. And I deny
[2:23:36] Satan in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[2:23:39] receive what I heard tonight. And I am
[2:23:42] delivered in the name of Jesus.
[2:23:46] Amen. I am delivered. I am set free. I
[2:23:51] am the church of the living God. I
[2:23:54] believe what I heard tonight. I am not
[2:23:56] going through a tribulation. I am going
[2:23:59] in a rapture.
[2:24:02] Hallelujah.
[2:24:05] That's what the rain is all about,
[2:24:07] saints of God. Not to regurgitate our
[2:24:10] problem again and again and again. It's
[2:24:14] to stomp the devil. Take the word of
[2:24:17] God. Know who you are in Christ. Amen.
[2:24:20] You are now children. You call yourself
[2:24:24] children. You are young men. You are
[2:24:26] young men. You are young women. And
[2:24:29] we've got many examples in the Bible.
[2:24:31] And they weren't wimps. And they weren't
[2:24:33] whiners. They were sons of God. And if
[2:24:36] you don't want to be a son of God, then
[2:24:38] you're in the wrong place. But if you
[2:24:40] want to be a son of God and liberated
[2:24:43] and know that you're more than a
[2:24:44] conqueror,
[2:24:46] then take what you heard tonight and
[2:24:48] tell that devil that's on your shoulder,
[2:24:50] get behind me.
[2:24:54] Get behind me. We've heard enough word
[2:24:57] in three services right now, saints of
[2:25:00] God, we should be conquering every
[2:25:01] spirit.
[2:25:04] There shouldn't be one of you looking
[2:25:06] down and say, "I don't want to hear what
[2:25:08] Brother Tom or Brother Ron or Brother
[2:25:11] David to say." You should be looking me
[2:25:12] square in the eye and say, "That's
[2:25:14] nothing but the truth, preacher."
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; If you want the world, have at the
[2:25:21] world. But give me Jesus.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Give me the word.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; You want popularity, go have at it.
[2:25:29] Because one day you won't be popular.
[2:25:32] You want to be the macho man, go have at
[2:25:35] it. But I'll take somebody that Brother
[2:25:38] Ron said today that has got muscles on
[2:25:40] his knees
[2:25:43] that's got a walk with God that knows
[2:25:45] who he's talking to because you say,
[2:25:47] "Well, I'm just a young person right
[2:25:49] now. In just a few short years, you're
[2:25:51] going to be married and you're going to
[2:25:52] have a baby and you're going to you're
[2:25:54] going to need to know the God of your
[2:25:56] salvation. That baby's going to get
[2:25:57] sick. Your wife is going to get sick and
[2:25:59] you're going to say, "Where's God?
[2:26:01] Where's the preacher?" No. Where are
[2:26:02] you? Where's your walk with God?
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; You call heaven down.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; You say, "I want to be married. I want
[2:26:10] to see men." Then I want to see men that
[2:26:12] know how to handle a word.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, I'm looking for a girlfriend.
[2:26:17] I'm looking for I I I tell you what. I'm
[2:26:19] looking for a son of God. I'm looking
[2:26:22] for a daughter of God." That's what
[2:26:24] we're here tonight. That's your
[2:26:25] challenge.
[2:26:29] That's your challenge tonight.
[2:26:31] Everybody wants to be first fiddle. We
[2:26:33] heard.
[2:26:35] Everybody wants to be numero uno. I'll
[2:26:38] tell you what, I don't want to be numero
[2:26:39] uno.
[2:26:42] Everybody wants to be the first guy
[2:26:44] wants to be recognized.
[2:26:48] I read an article years ago, years and
[2:26:50] years and years and years and years ago.
[2:26:52] You cannot change the music sheet.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; You cannot change the music sheet.
[2:26:57] Everybody wants to be the boss. Really?
[2:27:02] This guy was the second he was the
[2:27:04] second violinist in the greatest the
[2:27:08] symphony there was in America. And they
[2:27:11] did an interview with him and said, "You
[2:27:13] could be a first violinist anywhere in
[2:27:15] the world that you want to be."
[2:27:19] He said, "Why aren't you a first
[2:27:20] violinist?" He said, "Because God called
[2:27:23] me to be the second violinist because
[2:27:25] without me there's no harmony.
[2:27:29] Oh yeah.
[2:27:31] Amen.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Did you get it?
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Without you, there is no church.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; Catch the word. Don't try and be number
[2:27:41] one. Just be who you are.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; You cannot be a brother Ron Spencer, a
[2:27:46] Tom Ray. You can't be these brothers
[2:27:49] here. You be what you are and what God's
[2:27:51] called you to do.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Don't get jealous over somebody else.
[2:27:56] You just say, "Lord, make the best me
[2:27:58] there is."
[2:27:59] Is everybody with me tonight? You heard
[2:28:02] the word. How many received something
[2:28:04] from God tonight?
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; I sure did, saints of God. I sure did.
[2:28:09] And we've put in a lot of work and a lot
[2:28:11] of effort. And you, as brother Ron said,
[2:28:13] you've come a long way.
[2:28:16] You won't outgive God.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; There's no one of you I was going to
[2:28:21] say, God, I did more than what you did.
[2:28:24] God has given us gracious, gracious,
[2:28:27] gracious words of life. Wonderful words
[2:28:30] of life. And I just say all I want to
[2:28:33] see is Jesus.
[2:28:36] All I want to see is him.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; That's all I want to see. I don't want
[2:28:42] your theology.
[2:28:43] I don't want your thought of what it is.
[2:28:47] I want Jesus, the living word, living in
[2:28:50] me. That's what the whole message is
[2:28:53] about.
[2:28:56] Can we sing that little chorus before we
[2:28:58] go? All I want to see is Jesus.
[2:29:05] All I want to see is Jesus.
[2:29:14] All I want to see
[2:29:18] is in me.
[2:29:23] All I want to see
[2:29:27] is Jesus
[2:29:33] shine
[2:29:37] through me.
[2:29:42] Oh, I know the time is near where
[2:29:47] everything
[2:29:49] that I hold dear will lay before the
[2:29:54] holy
[2:29:56] consume me fire.
[2:30:01] All my words and all my deeds and every
[2:30:07] breath and all my needs will lay before
[2:30:13] the holy
[2:30:15] consuming
[2:30:17] fire.
[2:30:20] All I want to see
[2:30:24] is Jesus.
[2:30:29] And all I want to see,
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; I want to see him in me.
[2:30:39] All I want to see
[2:30:42] is Jesus
[2:30:48] shine
[2:30:52] through me. And let me hear him say, and
[2:30:56] let him say,
[2:31:01] well,
[2:31:17] it's
[2:31:19] well
[2:31:30] All I want to hear him say is well done,
[2:31:32] Saint. All I want to see
[2:31:37] is Jesus.
[2:31:42] And all I want to see
[2:31:46] is him.
[2:31:52] All I want to see
[2:31:55] is Jesus.
[2:32:00] Oh sh.
[2:32:03] One more time. Let's hear him say, "Well
[2:32:05] done."
[2:32:06] Let's lift up our voices to him and hear
[2:32:09] him say,
[2:32:13] "Well done,
[2:32:17] my
[2:32:20] preious
[2:32:23] one."
[2:32:26] Oh, well done.
[2:32:31] Well done.
[2:32:44] Amen. Well done.
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; Well done.
[2:32:50] How many really felt the word of God
[2:32:54] came to your address?
[2:33:00] And whenever Jesus comes, the
[2:33:02] supernatural starts taking place.
[2:33:06] I've got a quote here I was going to
[2:33:07] read. In fact, I got a whole message
[2:33:09] that I want to preach when I get home.
[2:33:12] Brother Ron gave me a message and I
[2:33:14] thought, "My goodness, I can't wait."
[2:33:17] And then these brothers know that's not
[2:33:18] me. I'm not running to preach, but I've
[2:33:21] got a message burning in my heart.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; And I think we better issue out some
[2:33:26] seat belts.
[2:33:29] Amen. I tell you what, that's inspired
[2:33:32] word that you heard tonight. That's
[2:33:34] inspired word you heard this morning and
[2:33:37] last night. I'm can't wait for tomorrow.
[2:33:40] Brother David,
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; we're feasting.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; Feasting. And this is the secret
[2:33:49] rapture. People don't even know what
[2:33:52] we're doing here tonight. They're out in
[2:33:54] their places and they're doing their
[2:33:57] thing. They don't have a clue. We're
[2:34:00] getting caught up
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; and we're getting carried away. We say,
[2:34:05] "Well, it's a secret rapture." It is
[2:34:07] indeed a secret rapture because some of
[2:34:09] you don't have a clue what I'm talking
[2:34:11] about, but most of you do.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; And we just want to get out of here.
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; And so we say, "Lord, anoint the men of
[2:34:18] God to minister the word."
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Till we raise into such heavenly
[2:34:23] places.
[2:34:24] Brother Matthew, you won't have to go to
[2:34:26] the Lynen Fair.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be something?
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be something? All their
[2:34:32] preparations for what? We're going to
[2:34:35] heaven.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; How many want to go to heaven?
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; How many want to pledge allegiance
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; to the lamb?
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; Can we sing that at our last song? We
[2:34:47] heard the word and I pledge allegiance
[2:34:50] to the word of God. That was we made a
[2:34:53] challenge to tonight. I
[2:34:57] pray
[2:35:01] to you.
[2:35:21] Oh, I pledge
[2:35:24] al
[2:35:26] to
[2:35:30] the
[2:35:34] I heard how
[2:35:39] longer
[2:35:42] where
[2:35:46] I find
[2:35:50] they were
[2:35:55] here's a challenge
[2:35:58] if they would never
[2:36:02] the name
[2:36:04] of Christ
[2:36:07] One by one
[2:36:10] they chose to die
[2:36:14] the son of God.
[2:36:18] They would not
[2:36:22] like
[2:36:25] angel
[2:36:29] sing.
[2:36:30] I can almost
[2:36:33] hear
[2:36:35] their voice
[2:36:47] with all my strength
[2:36:51] with all my
[2:36:54] I will sing
[2:36:57] to all
[2:37:00] is
[2:37:03] our glad
[2:37:07] to
[2:37:11] the lamb
[2:37:14] to the lamb of God.
[2:37:20] Oh my
[2:37:28] go
[2:37:33] to all
[2:37:36] his
[2:37:39] I
[2:37:44] to
[2:37:47] the
[2:37:51] Let's praise him.
[2:37:56] Amen to the lamb of God.
[2:38:03] Hallelujah.
[2:38:06] Glory to God.
[2:38:10] Hallelujah.
[2:38:12] Hallelujah.
[2:38:16] Amen.
[2:38:18] Don't you know that Jesus is here?
[2:38:22] Don't you know that King of Kings is
[2:38:24] present?
[2:38:27] Hallelujah.
[2:38:34] You know, the world has never had the
[2:38:36] devil's never had an original thought.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; They never He's never had an original
[2:38:41] thought. You know, you go to a sports
[2:38:44] game and they do the wave.
[2:38:46] Really? Really? We've been doing that a
[2:38:50] long time.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; We've been raising our hands and we've
[2:38:53] been giving him the wave of
[2:38:55] surrenderance.
[2:38:58] That's the real wave.
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; We've had a wonderful time.
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; I'm thanking you all that have come, all
[2:39:08] that have come down this highway. I
[2:39:10] remember my boys when we first came to
[2:39:12] this camp from Kuwamas. We went to here
[2:39:16] and they were just little tikes at the
[2:39:18] time and now they're old tikes.
[2:39:22] But by the time we got up to Maple
[2:39:23] Falls, they're giggling, they're
[2:39:25] laughing, they're jumping.
[2:39:28] We're going to camp.
[2:39:33] And I told you and I've told you many,
[2:39:35] many, many, many, many times
[2:39:38] when the pastor stood behind the pulpit
[2:39:41] at Kowama's camp. I've got it on the my
[2:39:44] Bible. And he got under the anointing at
[2:39:47] the close of the service.
[2:39:50] And he says in the first person,
[2:39:53] I give you your children.
[2:39:56] I was a deacon at the time. I was
[2:39:58] standing by a pole like where brother
[2:40:00] Jonathan was standing at. an old tent,
[2:40:03] an old blue tent. Tears were streaming
[2:40:05] down my eyes. I just had little boys.
[2:40:10] I had the privilege to have Sam
[2:40:13] come to have lunch with the brothers
[2:40:15] today.
[2:40:17] And when he walked in,
[2:40:20] people misunderstand it. They're
[2:40:21] thinking I'm saying son, but I'm saying
[2:40:25] hun.
[2:40:28] They're my boys.
[2:40:31] and I love them dearly and God gave them
[2:40:33] to me each one sovereignly
[2:40:38] and I can say to a parent that is
[2:40:40] sitting here today that their son hasn't
[2:40:42] come you call him hun you call him
[2:40:45] darling I don't care what you call him
[2:40:47] say that's big sis you fight I got them
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus gave them to me amen and Jesus can
[2:40:55] give you your children Jesus can give
[2:40:58] you your mothers Jesus can give you your
[2:41:00] fathers. Amen. They come out of the
[2:41:03] world and they've never gone back.
[2:41:05] They're not a bunch of yo-yos.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I met God at camp and then after
[2:41:11] camp, you become a a backslider again.
[2:41:14] What kind of You didn't meet God at
[2:41:15] camp. You meet God once, you're never
[2:41:17] the same.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; Moses never went hurting sheep again.
[2:41:24] I know that if you can believe that that
[2:41:28] word comes to your address and you catch
[2:41:31] a hold of that one time,
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; you will be a man and a daughter of God
[2:41:38] &gt;&gt; forever.
[2:41:40] And it doesn't have to be emotion. It
[2:41:42] has to be faith.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; And by faith, Noah built an ark to the
[2:41:48] saving of his household. And that's what
[2:41:52] we have camp for, for the saving of our
[2:41:55] household. Brother Peter, I have an
[2:41:58] ankle. Would you come and close us with
[2:41:59] a word of prayer, please?
[2:42:16] Precious Lord Jesus,
[2:42:19] we just want to say, Lord God, how we
[2:42:21] love you, how we appreciate your word,
[2:42:23] Lord Jesus.

[2:42:45] we appreciate you, Lord Jesus, that you
[2:42:47] are a living God, Lord Jesus. You are a
[2:42:49] living reality, Lord. You're not a dead
[2:42:51] God, Lord, but you are the same
[2:42:53] yesterday, today, and forever, Lord
[2:42:55] Jesus. And we're so thankful to you,
[2:42:57] Lord God, for being mindful of each and
[2:42:59] every one of us, Lord God, for coming
[2:43:01] down and speaking to our address, Lord
[2:43:03] Jesus. Lord God and it is our
[2:43:06] responsibility, Father, to move, Lord
[2:43:08] Jesus, with the spirit of God. It is our
[2:43:10] responsibility, Lord Jesus, to be
[2:43:13] always, Lord God, listening to your to
[2:43:16] that still small voice, Lord Jesus. Oh,
[2:43:18] Lord God, help each and every one of us,
[2:43:20] Lord. We're so thankful to you, Father.
[2:43:23] There is none like you, Lord God. And we
[2:43:25] just want to say that we love you and we
[2:43:26] appreciate your goodness. We appreciate
[2:43:29] everything you do for us, Lord God. Oh
[2:43:32] Lord Jesus, we pray that you go with
[2:43:34] each each and every one of us, Lord.
[2:43:36] Pray that you bless, Lord Jesus, brother
[2:43:38] Ron, Lord God. Strengthen him, Lord God.
[2:43:41] May you use him once again, Father. And
[2:43:43] may you, Lord God, the word would go
[2:43:45] far, it would go forth, Lord Jesus, into
[2:43:47] every heart. May it heal the
[2:43:49] brokenhearted, Lord Jesus. We know
[2:43:51] everything about us, Lord God. And may
[2:43:53] you go to each predestinated ground,
[2:43:56] Lord God. May that word produce the life
[2:43:58] that you desire to see within within
[2:44:00] each and every one of us, Lord. Oh,
[2:44:02] Father, what a wonderful God you are,
[2:44:04] Lord. We commit everything into your
[2:44:06] hands. We ask you, Lord God, that you go
[2:44:08] with each and every one of us, Lord. We
[2:44:11] love you. We ask all of these things and

[2:44:14] Jesus Christ. Amen. Thanks, Father

[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; Morning devotion 10:00.
[2:44:25] those that are on uh off camp and you
[2:44:28] need to make your way, just be safe on
[2:44:31] the road. And God bless you for coming,
[2:44:34] making this a wonderful meeting and
[2:44:36] pulling and bringing your lick of fire.
[2:44:38] God bless you all. Those that are
[2:44:40] camping and all that came from Edmonton,
[2:44:42] God bless you. And those from overseas
[2:44:45] in Europe, God bless you. I think the
[2:44:48] broad I'm I mean, it seems like it's
[2:44:51] gathering time. Amen. Man, it seems like
[2:44:53] we're in that swarm. Brother Ram talked
[2:44:56] about those Canadian geese in in in the
[2:44:59] United States of America.
[2:45:01] They heard that one honk and they all
[2:45:04] started to rally around. I think we've
[2:45:05] been hearing the honk. Amen. We're
[2:45:08] following the leader, Christ Jesus, and
[2:45:10] we're going back to our destination.
[2:45:13] Amen. Don't get me going. Okay.
[2:45:16] Can we do one? I've been dying to to
[2:45:19] sing it since junior camp. It's an old
[2:45:22] song. We got to run run run run run run
[2:45:27] with the message of Malachi 4. How many
[2:45:30] know that? Stick up your hand. Oh my.
[2:45:33] Look at that. Challenge.
[2:45:36] Challenge. Challenge to take this
[2:45:39] message to your schoolmate. Challenge to
[2:45:42] take it to the clerk that works beside
[2:45:44] you. a challenge to say, "I got life and
[2:45:47] you're dead." But you can be alive again
[2:45:50] because he's the resurrection. Can we
[2:45:52] run with this message? You got to run
[2:45:55] run
[2:45:59] with the message of Malachi 4.
[2:46:04] You got that never before
[2:46:18] me the coming of the Lord. Okay, just a
[2:46:22] second here. Just a second here. We're
[2:46:24] getting a little bit mixed up here. You
[2:46:26] got to run run. No. Is that right?
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; All right. So this half here is the
[2:46:33] other half. You got that? Not that I
[2:46:35] know what I'm doing, but that'll be all
[2:46:37] right. So you got to run run
[2:46:42] run run run with the message of Malachi
[2:46:47] 4.
[2:46:49] And you got to tell a lie you never told
[2:46:53] him before.
[2:46:56] Let him marry you right.
[2:47:00] And in that ear run
[2:47:03] this message is the coming of the Lord.
[2:47:09] Well, you got to run run run
[2:47:15] with the message.
[2:47:19] And you got like you never told it
[2:47:24] before
[2:47:31] that run for his message is the coming
[2:47:37] of the Lord.
[2:47:57] You can go if you can go,
[2:48:01] right?
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You You're dismissed if you can be
[2:48:04] dismissed.
[2:48:07] You know, those are kind of meetings
[2:48:08] that you just don't want to go. The
[2:48:11] trouble of it is you cut a meeting short
[2:48:13] and everybody sits down and they're
[2:48:14] there for another hour. Why do we cut it
[2:48:17] short?
[2:48:19] &gt;&gt; But if we're going to be around, why
[2:48:20] don't we just rejoice,
[2:48:22] praise him, glorify him. Amen. But I'm
[2:48:27] going to let my people go.
[2:48:30] God bless you. You're dismissed in
[2:48:33] Jesus' name. Nice having you all.
