[20:17] great love for you, Lord, for you
[20:19] reached down your hand. We can say
[20:21] individually for me. When I was lost and
[20:24] undone without God or a son, mercy
[20:28] stepped in, Lord, the love of God
[20:30] reached down and transformed our souls.
[20:34] Lord, we want to come to the house of
[20:35] God with thanksgiving on our lips to
[20:37] praise the most holy one, the glorious
[20:39] one, the great I am, the alpha, and the
[20:42] omega. We love you, Lord, this morning,
[20:44] asking God that as these hands were
[20:46] raised, that you would come down to
[20:49] their address, that the word itself
[20:52] would come through the servant of God
[20:54] this morning, our pastor, where the word
[20:56] of God was sent to heal the people. Heal
[20:58] us once again, Lord. Let the glory of
[21:01] God come down within this little
[21:03] assembly this morning. And pass me not,
[21:05] oh gentle Savior, hear my humble cry,
[21:09] while in others thou art dealing with
[21:11] and calling. Don't pass me by, Lord.
[21:14] Speak deeply to my own soul. And Lord,
[21:17] these needs that our brother Nathan has
[21:19] read, Lord, you knew them before they
[21:21] were ever penned down. For you are
[21:24] omnipotent God.
[21:25] Father, you can be touched by the
[21:28] feeling of our infirmity this morning.
[21:31] And by faith, we reach out to the
[21:33] promise of God. To them that believe,
[21:36] Lord, you're our healer. To them that
[21:38] believe you're our deliverer. To them
[21:40] that believe, Lord, you're their savior.
[21:42] God, would you move on our behalf this
[21:45] morning as we collectively join our
[21:48] hearts together to give you all the
[21:50] glory and honor. Do your holy name.
[21:53] Bless the servant of God this morning,
[21:55] Lord. Anoint brother Ed and let the word
[21:57] of God find its place within our lives.
[22:00] Lord, may our hearts be good ground this
[22:02] morning. May the seed of God be planted
[22:05] and may it bring forth, Lord, more than
[22:08] we could even ask or think, Lord. And
[22:11] Father, as we now take up this offering
[22:14] this morning, we pray, Father, that you
[22:16] will bless the giver, that you will
[22:18] multiply it and break it down, Lord, and
[22:21] use it for the glory of God. Lord, we
[22:24] commit the song service. We commit the
[22:27] service to you, praying God, thy divine
[22:29] will be done in Jesus' name. Amen.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Tom. You may have
[22:38] your seats as the deacons take up the
[22:41] offering this morning. Just

[25:40] of redemption that I am a part of it and
[25:43] that I'm associated with people that are
[25:46] a part of the plan of redemption. I
[25:48] never get tired of singing about the
[25:50] cross and about redemption because wow,
[25:53] where would I be without redemption?
[25:55] Amen. Where would I be without the
[25:57] blood?
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; I kind of get emotional when I sing
[26:04] about the cross and
[26:06] but I just want to give thanks to the

[27:32] let's sing a song together. When pangs
[27:36] of death seized on my soul, I would not
[27:38] be denied.
[27:47] When pangs of death seized on my soul
[27:51] unto the Lord I cried. Till Jesus came
[27:56] and made me whole. I would not be
[28:00] denied.
[28:01] I would not be denied.
[28:05] I would not be denied
[28:08] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[28:12] would not be down at Jacob in the days
[28:18] before I wrestled with the Lord.
[28:22] And it says when I cate
[28:26] I stood upon you. Oh, I was not denied.
[28:33] I would not be
[28:36] till Jesus came and made me. Oh, I will
[28:40] not be denied.
[28:43] Oh,
[28:45] my Lord was gone and could not hear my
[28:48] prayer. But praise the Lord for the work
[28:52] he done and Christ glory.
[28:56] Oh, I would not be.
[29:00] I would not be
[29:03] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[29:07] would not be.
[29:11] Now, I want to sing verse three again
[29:14] cuz I just love pushing Satan's nose in
[29:17] the word of God.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; He says, "My Lord is gone and he's not
[29:21] going to hear me, but I know the Father
[29:24] has said that he hears and he answers
[29:26] prayer." Amen. He never leaves us or
[29:29] forsakes us, but he's going to be with
[29:31] us until the end of the world. Amen. So,
[29:34] let's stand up and let's push Satan's
[29:36] nose into the word of God cuz that's
[29:40] what we're here to do. We're here to be
[29:41] overcomers in the name of the Lord Jesus
[29:45] because he is victorious and he's living
[29:48] inside of us. And therefore, we are
[29:51] victorious with Christ Jesus who is our
[29:54] Lord and Savior. Amen. Oh, Satan said,
[29:58] "My Lord was gone and would not hear my
[30:02] prayer.
[30:03] But praise the Lord, the work is done.
[30:07] And Christ the Lord is here. And I would
[30:11] not be denied.
[30:13] I would not be denied.
[30:16] Till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[30:20] would not be denied. Oh, I would not be
[30:25] denied.
[30:26] I would not be denied.
[30:30] Till Jesus came and made me whole, I
[30:33] would not be denied.
[30:38] Hallelujah. Let's sing. He leadth me, oh

[34:21] pastor comes, let's just sing
[34:25] a verse and a chorus of blessed
[34:26] assurance. Jesus is mine.
[34:29] Oh, what an assurance we have. Amen.
[34:32] We're holding to God's unchanging hand.
[34:35] He's taking us through all the way.
[34:39] Amen.
[34:42] Blessed assurance.
[34:48] Jesus is mine.
[34:54] Oh, what a foreign
[34:59] glory
[35:00] divine.
[35:04] I'm an air of salvation,
[35:10] purchase of God,
[35:13] [Music]
[35:16] born of his spirit
[35:21] and washed in his blood.
[35:27] This is my story.
[35:30] [Music]
[35:31] [Applause]
[35:32] This is my song.
[35:38] Praising my savior
[35:43] all the day long.
[35:49] This is my song.
[35:54] This is my song.
[36:01] My
[36:13] [Music]
[36:15] Amen.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Are y'all feeling all right?
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Good. I am too.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful to come into the house
[36:25] of God and I hope you came expecting
[36:28] something. Lord,
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:32] I just want to make a a couple of
[36:35] announcements
[36:36] before we go any further. Brother Caumbi
[36:41] from Congo is arriving here to be with
[36:45] brother Toby, Sister Rebecca, and their
[36:47] family.
[36:49] He's arriving on February the 9th.
[36:52] And so we'll be uh privileged and
[36:57] delighted to have him speak. uh maybe
[37:00] once or twice, maybe the 15th and the
[37:03] 22nd. So you can just bear that in mind.
[37:05] Brother Caillou will be here. Blessed us
[37:08] immensely the times he's been here. A
[37:11] man with depth of the word, pastor of a
[37:14] very substantial church in Mabu Jamaaya
[37:19] in Congo and uh we've spoken there at
[37:23] his church and it's a wonderful
[37:25] atmosphere. So we're very very happy. I
[37:28] can tell you that there's a a lot of
[37:30] places that would uh indeed like to have
[37:33] him. Uh for those of you that may have
[37:37] received a little email or a mail from
[37:40] Brother Norm Wood, uh we're happy to
[37:43] hear that there's improvement for Sister
[37:46] Louise.
[37:48] And uh and her diabetes is reducing
[37:52] every day.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and uh she had a terrible
[37:57] suffering with her knees and and and so
[38:00] on and got strained or sprained and uh
[38:04] there's nothing too small and nothing
[38:06] too great but what God is concerned
[38:10] about us
[38:12] uh
[38:16] I know that you're standing I'm going to
[38:18] be standing much longer
[38:22] but um there are some things that I've
[38:25] been impressed with
[38:28] and some things that I would like to see
[38:31] achieved
[38:33] this morning. Something that I'm going
[38:34] to just give you a personal craving that
[38:36] I've had on my heart and that is uh I
[38:40] was in the meetings that brother
[38:43] Brandham conducted and uh people that
[38:47] haven't been in the meetings might think
[38:48] well oh they were just so spectacular.
[38:51] Well, they were something like this
[38:55] meeting.
[38:56] But he would say often if God can do
[39:01] something through me to increase your
[39:05] faith to accept the son of God.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; He said on another time, I trust that
[39:11] God will do something that'll increase
[39:14] your faith so that you can be healed.
[39:19] The Lord bless you, he said. And now may
[39:21] he greatly increase your faith,
[39:27] but that he might increase your faith
[39:29] that Jesus has raised from the dead.
[39:33] Those are just it's no use us giving you
[39:37] a quote unless that God comes and visits
[39:42] you.
[39:44] That's what I pray for. That's what I
[39:46] crave for. It's not just uh sufficient
[39:51] for you to know something that happened
[39:54] 40, 50, 60 years ago or 2,000 years ago
[39:59] or earlier. We could go to the Old
[40:02] Testament. We could go to the New
[40:03] Testament and we can go into the
[40:06] prophet's ministry. But what is
[40:09] absolutely essential and it's I feel a
[40:12] very very heavy responsibility because
[40:15] it's largely the ministry's
[40:18] responsibility
[40:19] to preach the word in such a way so that
[40:23] we're not happy and satisfied when we
[40:25] leave the pulpit but that your faith has
[40:27] been increased and something happens.
[40:31] And so that's that's my desire today.
[40:33] And I want you to really focus yourself
[40:36] in that direction. God,
[40:40] what would you have me to do? How? Help
[40:43] me to increase my faith. Help me to
[40:46] listen in such a way. Help me to be
[40:48] exercised.
[40:50] And just on the way to the church, you
[40:52] know, the this is Satan's Eden. You
[40:55] understand? Okay. We have a lot of
[40:57] things that are provided in uh in the
[41:00] world that actually dilute our faith.
[41:04] One is I'm wearing glasses
[41:07] and if you see that I take them off,
[41:10] it's because I don't want the
[41:13] expression on the people to bother me.
[41:17] [Music]
[41:19] Uh but if there's something wrong with
[41:21] our eyes, we don't get we don't have
[41:23] desperation over that anymore. because
[41:26] we can go to an optometrist
[41:29] and our faith is diluted because we
[41:31] don't have desperation.
[41:33] In Jesus day, they didn't have glasses
[41:37] in Jesus day. Today, if we run out of
[41:39] money, uh we don't get a desperate
[41:41] because we got a credit card or a line
[41:44] of credit or something. But in those
[41:47] days, it was desperation.
[41:50] And today we don't have desperation for
[41:52] a lot of things because we got
[41:54] pharmacies and doctors and all those
[41:56] things. I'm not against them. I I'm I'm
[41:59] actually for doctors and whatever more
[42:02] so they can tell us what we need to know
[42:05] and maybe things we need to do that
[42:08] we're not doing. This life has us on a
[42:11] treadmill has us has us at a pace that's
[42:14] not God's pace. That's our pace. And so
[42:18] we need to adjust ourselves
[42:21] and we're here in church. Well, now we
[42:24] have the musicians and the song leader
[42:26] and so on so forth. We expect that. What
[42:29] else do you expect? Well, we expect that
[42:31] somebody's going to come out and preach.
[42:33] And do you expect anything more?
[42:37] Well, maybe desperation hasn't set in,
[42:41] &gt;&gt; but I find in the Bible when people
[42:44] called out,
[42:45] &gt;&gt; cried out to God, we must have this,
[42:49] meet me, and we find different ones that
[42:53] have desperation and God has done
[42:55] something.
[42:58] our sister Clement right here, Sister
[43:02] Leverne. God has met her on a number of
[43:05] occasions.
[43:06] And I don't know whether I would do this
[43:09] or not, but uh Brother Steven, Sister
[43:13] Tracy Rivas
[43:15] came to the front of the church about 3
[43:19] 4 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago or so, I don't
[43:21] know. And uh and Sister Tracy just told
[43:27] about uh an examination that she had and
[43:31] they thought there might be a tumor and
[43:34] they're going to you know and of course
[43:37] that leaves a person anybody
[43:39] has a wife and a mother or whatever more
[43:43] you have some concerns about that. And
[43:47] anyway, they dealt with that this last
[43:49] week and we had prayer here and the
[43:52] doctor said the tumor's dying and
[43:56] started dying about 3 weeks ago.
[44:02] Could we say glory to God?
[44:04] [Applause]
[44:08] And so to have our sister Louise Woods
[44:12] improving
[44:13] doesn't surprise me at all.
[44:16] And I look back and see we had a
[44:20] wonderful testimony. I to me it's a
[44:22] wonderful testimony. Brother Darren, you
[44:25] and uh Sister Roxan and that night of
[44:29] the service I was watching you down
[44:31] here. And I saw Sister Roxan just step
[44:35] out in the aisle and I was looking for
[44:37] the rest of your family. And I didn't
[44:39] know why. I was just uh you know had a I
[44:42] I wasn't concerned but I just and uh and
[44:47] God gave us I believe a mighty victory.
[44:51] Why are we here? Number one, I pray that
[44:54] the preaching of the word will increase
[44:56] your faith.
[44:58] I pray that something will in you will
[45:01] activate his presence for you. You don't
[45:04] have to bring it down. It's here.
[45:11] Amen.
[45:13] Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[45:16] we're standing in your presence,
[45:19] fully aware that man can do nothing.
[45:23] As a prophet of God would say, "I'm as
[45:26] helpless as can be." We are helpless.
[45:30] But you are almighty.
[45:33] You can do anything. and all things are
[45:35] possible to them that believe. And we do
[45:38] not want to be a people that limit you.
[45:41] You have risen from the dead. You have
[45:44] manifested yourself. You have declared
[45:47] yourself. You have interpreted your
[45:49] word. And we're here, oh God, as your
[45:52] elected people, not because we say so,
[45:55] because you have chosen that we should
[45:58] hear your voice. And your voice was
[46:01] quickened to us. And now we pray that
[46:03] that quickening will continue today and
[46:06] you'll do what you wish to do and what
[46:08] you desire to do. We simply pre present
[46:11] ourselves to you. Father, thy will be
[46:15] done on earth as it is in heaven in
[46:18] Jesus Christ's name for your glory.
[46:21] Amen.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Take your Bibles, please, and uh turn to
[46:28] Exodus
[46:29] the 3 chapter. Thank you for standing
[46:32] and being patient.
[46:40] Thank you musicians and brother Nathan.
[46:55] I'm going to begin reading at the second
[46:57] verse of the third chapter.
[47:05] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[47:08] him in a flame of fire
[47:11] out of the midst of a bush. And he
[47:13] looked, and behold, the bush burned with
[47:15] fire, and the bush was not consumed. And
[47:20] Moses said, I will turn now aside, and
[47:23] see this great sight, why the bush is
[47:25] not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he
[47:29] turned aside to see, God called unto him
[47:32] out of the midst of the bush and said,
[47:35] "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am
[47:38] I." And he said, "Draw not nigh hither.
[47:42] Put off thy shoes from off thy feet. For
[47:45] the place whereon thou standest is holy
[47:48] ground." Moreover, he said, I am the God
[47:52] of thy father, the God of Abraham, the
[47:55] God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And
[47:59] Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to
[48:02] look upon God.
[48:06] There's a another verse
[48:11] that I'll just read it.
[48:14] And uh
[48:18] Moses later on asked
[48:21] to see God's face and someone
[48:25] ministering here talked about show me
[48:27] thy glory brother Tim Dodd I believe
[48:31] and the Lord said and this is you can
[48:34] just listen please Exodus 33 and 21
[48:38] and the Lord said behold
[48:42] there is a place by me
[48:46] and thou shalt stand upon a rock.
[48:50] And that is my text this morning. And
[48:54] the title of this message is there is a
[48:56] place by me. You may just have your
[49:00] seats reverently. I want to have you
[49:04] have as little movement around as
[49:06] possible.
[49:10] I'm going to show just one slide
[49:17] if it's ready please.
[49:31] A place
[49:34] can be a country,
[49:37] can be a city, a town,
[49:41] a home,
[49:42] can be this church.
[49:46] A place can also be a condition.
[49:49] If you're sick this morning, that's one
[49:51] situation.
[49:53] If you're made healthy, you're in
[49:55] another state. You're in another place.
[49:58] I'm healthy.
[50:01] A person could be have plenty or they
[50:04] could be in a famine.
[50:06] And those are different places.
[50:09] A person may be righteous
[50:13] or they may be wicked. And those are
[50:15] certainly two different places. And all
[50:18] of us here we talk about where we used
[50:20] to be, where we were when God found us.
[50:23] That was certainly a different place
[50:25] than where we are today.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and the kind of language we
[50:29] used and the kind of things we enjoyed.
[50:32] The things we once loved we hate
[50:35] &gt;&gt; and the things perhaps that we didn't
[50:37] care for or hated we now love. We're
[50:40] different people
[50:41] &gt;&gt; and in a different place. A place can
[50:45] also be a destiny.
[50:47] I go to prepare a place for you. Jesus
[50:51] said, and the Bible says also, Judas by
[50:55] transgression fell that he might go to
[50:58] his own place,
[51:01] a place in a book. And in Luke the 4th
[51:05] chapter, the Bible tells us, "And when
[51:07] he had opened the book, he found the
[51:10] place where it was written, and he said,
[51:15] this day is this scripture fulfilled."
[51:17] So the place and the scripture come
[51:21] crashing together.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; There was another instance which I will
[51:26] refer to in the message later on. I'm
[51:28] just giving you this to initiate the
[51:31] service. There was a place
[51:35] where
[51:36] the the Philip the evangelist had been
[51:39] having a great in a great time of moving
[51:43] of the spirit of God and great things
[51:44] were happening in the book of acts and
[51:47] God spoke to him and said you go to a
[51:49] desert place. He went out in a desert
[51:52] and there was a man very very a man h a
[51:57] man of stature, a man of integrity, a
[52:00] unic uh uh over all the treasure of the
[52:06] queen of Ethiopia,
[52:08] Candice, and he was he was reading he
[52:12] had a scriptures
[52:15] he was reading in a certain place
[52:18] &gt;&gt; in the scripture he didn't find the
[52:20] place. He was just reading there
[52:23] and he didn't really know anything about
[52:25] what was going on. He didn't know that
[52:28] God was doing something supernatural on
[52:30] his behalf. Might be you this morning.
[52:33] And he was reading in the scripture
[52:36] and he was wounded for our
[52:38] transgressions and he was bruised. He's
[52:40] led as a lamb to the slaughter. And
[52:42] Philip steps up into his chariot and he
[52:46] says, "Do you understand what you're
[52:48] reading?" He said, "How can I understand
[52:50] except somebody tell me
[52:53] how can how can people have faith unless
[52:56] they hear the preaching?
[52:58] &gt;&gt; For faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[53:00] by the word of God. So we want to make
[53:03] certain that our ears aren't affected by
[53:05] something in this life."
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there was a place
[53:14] in the book and there's a many other
[53:16] instances where a place relates and I
[53:20] may touch on some of them as we go on.
[53:25] Uh a common phrase we hear places where
[53:29] the heart is.
[53:31] We have a lot of young people and
[53:33] children here from the school and there
[53:37] was a
[53:39] a young girl in uh sixth grade
[53:44] and I she addressed this and she wrote
[53:47] this.
[53:49] Home is the place where family is where
[53:53] the celebrations, get togethers and the
[53:56] heart is
[53:58] the place where you always feel safe and
[54:01] loved.
[54:03] A home is a place where you are always
[54:06] welcomed and wanted.
[54:08] A home is a place to keep you warm when
[54:11] it's cold and a place to be happy or
[54:14] sad.
[54:16] A place where there is food and water to
[54:20] eat and drink. My home is a loving,
[54:24] safe, and caring place that I'm proud to
[54:27] call my home. If your house is the same
[54:31] way, then it is a home because home is
[54:35] where the heart is.
[54:38] I thought when I was reading that, I
[54:41] thought, you know, we're we're we're
[54:43] your children.
[54:45] We're going to come here. We feel warm
[54:48] and comfortable,
[54:51] &gt;&gt; safe, protected.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Fed.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; There's water to drink,
[54:59] &gt;&gt; food to eat,
[55:01] &gt;&gt; somebody that cares for us.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; We feel welcomed.
[55:06] Hallelujah. What a wonderful presence.
[55:09] How a prophet would say to the people,
[55:11] you are a Christian because I feel a
[55:14] welcome spirit.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Home is where the heart is.
[55:26] We read of Moses and now I'm just
[55:29] starting and I'll appreciate your full
[55:31] attention.
[55:33] This is a special message for me. It's a
[55:36] special message.
[55:40] Moses had stood in the palaces of Egypt.
[55:45] Moses had stood and was in a position to
[55:48] be a pharaoh.
[55:52] Moses was the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[55:57] He stood at the top. He was by the
[56:00] brother Brandham said he was a genius.
[56:04] He taught the teachers of Egypt.
[56:08] That's a place he was in.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; He was respected. He was renowned. He
[56:13] was he was a man that had attained. We
[56:17] don't want to just dream its way out of
[56:18] our place, but you're not where you were
[56:21] a few years ago.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Not just spiritually, but perhaps
[56:25] materially or whatever. And and the
[56:28] world may have handed you a uh you know
[56:30] a good hand. It may have handed you a
[56:33] difficult hand. Uh we don't we don't
[56:36] desire to be sick but sometime we get
[56:39] sick. We don't desire to be discouraged
[56:42] but sometime we get discouraged.
[56:45] Sometime we fall into despondency and we
[56:48] don't know why.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; I don't believe I've ever told this over
[56:53] the pulpit and I know it's on the
[56:55] internet and to be around the world. But
[56:59] you know, you you you see me standing
[57:02] here ministering and the other
[57:03] ministers, I can't speak for them, but I
[57:07] once went to my doctor, a family doctors
[57:10] quite a number of years ago.
[57:12] And uh I go to a doctor because he knows
[57:16] something about our our anatomy and our
[57:18] system. And sometime we're doing the
[57:20] wrong thing. We're sometime we're doing
[57:22] exactly the opposite thing that we
[57:25] should be doing.
[57:27] And I had really thought about this and
[57:29] I stepped into the doctor's office and
[57:32] then they
[57:34] brought me into the waiting room. And so
[57:36] I'm sitting there in a little
[57:39] examination room and in comes a doctor,
[57:42] Dr. Forester.
[57:44] There's an old British doctor. Oh, he
[57:46] said, "How are you, Mr. Besco?" I said,
[57:48] "Fine." Oh, he said, "That sounds good."
[57:52] He said, "What can I do for you today?"
[57:53] And I said, "Well, you know, I really
[57:55] don't know." I said, "I just like to
[57:58] talk to you. Is that possible?" Oh.
[58:01] Fine. So, he jumped up on the
[58:03] examination table and just let his feet
[58:05] dangle. And he said, "What would you
[58:07] like to talk about?"
[58:09] I said, "Well, I said, I don't know
[58:12] what's going on really." I said, "I I I
[58:14] don't know what really I want to talk
[58:16] about." I said, "Uh,
[58:18] you know," I said, "I like fishing.
[58:22] For me to think of putting a line in the
[58:24] water right now is just utterly
[58:26] repulsive.
[58:28] Said my wife and I, we've traveled all
[58:30] over the world in different places and
[58:33] we've seen a lot of beautiful places. I
[58:35] can't think of a place that I have a
[58:38] remote desire to be in. Said I like to
[58:41] hunt. I don't I don't care to hunt. I
[58:44] don't want to go any place. I said I
[58:47] have a wonderful home and wife and
[58:50] family and everything is just
[58:54] wonderful at home. But I said I don't
[58:56] get any enjoyment. I don't get any
[58:58] satisfaction from it. I said and I I I I
[59:03] only held back one thing and that is how
[59:05] I feel when I'm behind the pulpit. I
[59:07] held that back from him because that's
[59:09] not in the medical field.
[59:11] And I said, uh, I I said, I I don't
[59:15] really, I said, there isn't anything
[59:18] that I can think of that I would desire
[59:20] to do.
[59:23] And I and then I stopped and I said I
[59:26] said, "Doctor, does this make any sense
[59:28] to you?" Oh, he said, "Absolutely."
[59:31] I said, "What is it?" He said,
[59:32] "Exhaustion.
[59:34] You're exhausted."
[59:36] He said, "And I am ordering you on eight
[59:38] weeks rest."
[59:40] Well, I had eight days because I had a
[59:42] wedding coming up in eight days and it
[59:45] wasn't a rest. But I had eight days and
[59:49] at least I learned a very valuable
[59:51] lesson,
[59:53] you know, and that's why the prophet
[59:54] even had Sam there and he would just go
[59:57] and talk to Sam and they would sit down.
[59:59] They've been friends since they were
[1:00:02] children as a boys. And sometime we need
[1:00:06] to hear something because we don't we
[1:00:08] don't always understand what's going on
[1:00:11] in our in our system in our family or in
[1:00:15] our life. We don't understand it. But
[1:00:19] God knows it
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; a lot better than the family doctor.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; And you might be in that situation where
[1:00:25] you haven't got everything in your life
[1:00:27] figured out, but God's got it figured
[1:00:29] out.
[1:00:33] Moses as I said it was he was born in a
[1:00:36] home of slaves.
[1:00:40] So one day that was his place
[1:00:43] and then he was put in a basket of bull
[1:00:45] rushes as a child as a baby and sent
[1:00:50] down the river Nile River and that was
[1:00:52] his place.
[1:00:54] And then he was found by the maidens and
[1:01:00] then he went into Pharaoh's
[1:01:03] palaces and that was his place.
[1:01:06] And then he had something going on
[1:01:09] inside that he was not content or
[1:01:12] satisfied with that. And we get into
[1:01:15] that position also because maybe even
[1:01:18] where you are spiritually that's not
[1:01:21] your place. God has something more for
[1:01:24] us. The church was in a certain
[1:01:27] condition and and it's described it was
[1:01:31] described in Revelation. It was uh in
[1:01:35] need of nothing, but they didn't know
[1:01:37] they were very needy.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; I want you just to hold that. And Moses,
[1:01:43] he he because he acted on behalf of the
[1:01:47] burden of his heart. The prophet said he
[1:01:49] looked out the same window Pharaoh
[1:01:50] looked out. Pharaoh saw them as mudbers.
[1:01:53] Moses saw them as brethren. He went and
[1:01:56] they didn't understand. He was he was
[1:01:58] trying to liberate them with this
[1:02:00] military might and strength and slew a
[1:02:02] man and uh as a result of that he became
[1:02:07] a vagabond and brother Vandom calls him
[1:02:10] all the time a runaway prophet.
[1:02:14] Sometimes even with even in the right
[1:02:16] direction, even called of God, even
[1:02:18] called to be a prophet, even called to
[1:02:20] be a believer, even called to be elect,
[1:02:23] often we may not be where we ought to
[1:02:26] be.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; We're not here to play games. We're not
[1:02:30] here to play church.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; We're here to talk about you,
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; talk about our God,
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; talk about this message,
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; to absorb it and let it permeate us. And
[1:02:43] are we here?
[1:02:46] What has he got in mind?
[1:02:49] Perhaps he would intend to.
[1:02:53] You think you came from your home? I'm
[1:02:56] way ahead of myself, but you think you
[1:02:57] came from your home. That was your
[1:02:59] place. And you've come here. I come
[1:03:02] here. Why do we come here? Well, it's
[1:03:04] Sunday morning. I always come here. This
[1:03:07] is Sunday. We're believers. We believe
[1:03:09] in we believe in being together but
[1:03:13] maybe because of the world and because
[1:03:15] of situations and because of
[1:03:17] involvements and whatever more maybe
[1:03:20] it's put you into another place and and
[1:03:22] you're consumed and burdened and
[1:03:25] whatever more and anxious and so on so
[1:03:28] forth and this God that I'm referring to
[1:03:31] if I could just increase your faith that
[1:03:33] you could realize say how can I increase
[1:03:35] my faith just if you'd realize that this
[1:03:38] God.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; The God who created the universe. That
[1:03:43] God. That God that came in the form of
[1:03:46] Jesus Christ. That God that let that
[1:03:50] body go to the go to the cross. That God
[1:03:54] and raised him from the dead. That God
[1:03:57] is here somehow is in this place. That
[1:04:01] God is here. That God who knows me
[1:04:05] infinitely better than I know myself.
[1:04:07] That God is here.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; That God who maybe I think my need is a
[1:04:13] certain need, but that God may see the
[1:04:16] need as being something different.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Moses was in a shepherd's tent now
[1:04:29] hering sheep
[1:04:32] and that was his place.
[1:04:39] and he saw a bush that wasn't
[1:04:42] consumed as it burned. He thought, "This
[1:04:46] is different."
[1:04:48] And he stepped over and when God saw,
[1:04:52] he didn't know God was there.
[1:04:55] Maybe you don't know that God is here.
[1:04:59] Maybe you think you're in church.
[1:05:03] I have your attention.
[1:05:05] And when he stepped to that bush, God
[1:05:09] said, "Take off your shoes."
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Your place you stand on is holy ground.
[1:05:16] He didn't know it was holy ground. He
[1:05:19] didn't know that was a sacred place. It
[1:05:22] was only holy. It was never referred to
[1:05:24] again.
[1:05:25] No one ever went to see the site again
[1:05:28] that I know of.
[1:05:30] But the place he was standing on was
[1:05:32] holy ground. And God saw what he wanted
[1:05:36] to do. God knew what he wanted to do.
[1:05:38] God knew what he wanted to do with him.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; He didn't have any idea that he was
[1:05:43] going to go back to Pharaoh to the
[1:05:46] palaces with a stick in his hand and
[1:05:49] say, "Let my people go."
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; He had no idea that was going to take
[1:05:56] place.
[1:06:01] Never had he stood hearing a voice speak
[1:06:04] to him that also resounded to a deep
[1:06:08] calling within him
[1:06:10] to see his people delivered.
[1:06:13] The call of a runaway prophet today
[1:06:19] runaway sons or daughters of God. When I
[1:06:23] say run away, I don't want you to look
[1:06:26] on it negatively. But you know, if we
[1:06:28] live below what we it's not sufficient
[1:06:32] that we just go on in the format of
[1:06:36] church services as such when when uh
[1:06:39] when the God that we speak of the
[1:06:41] resurrected Jesus Christ, we should be
[1:06:45] fully aware and fully in expectation
[1:06:48] every time we walk in these doors. This
[1:06:51] God who raised up Jesus from the dead is
[1:06:54] going to be in this place. He's going to
[1:06:56] be talking to people. He's going to be
[1:06:59] talking to me. I'm going to have my
[1:07:01] heart opened and full of expectation as
[1:07:04] though the prophet of God was here or
[1:07:06] Jesus Christ himself is here for he is
[1:07:08] here.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Whether the minister gets excited about
[1:07:15] it or doesn't get excited about it,
[1:07:17] nevertheless, that God is here. and I
[1:07:20] have certain needs and and perhaps it
[1:07:22] may not even be what I identify. It
[1:07:25] might be something else
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; and often it is something else.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you some examples.
[1:07:33] people thought their dilemma or or
[1:07:36] people came before the prophet and they
[1:07:38] were standing there that they they had a
[1:07:40] great physical need
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; and then when the angel of the Lord was
[1:07:45] there say but your real need is you're
[1:07:48] not saved
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; that's your real need
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; you're here because of this but I see
[1:07:57] someone else standing with you burden
[1:08:00] for someone else that has cancer
[1:08:05] These are simply examples of what your
[1:08:08] God
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; did through your prophet
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; to show what he is today. And if there's
[1:08:14] any phrase that was used and repeated,
[1:08:17] Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
[1:08:22] this is January what the 18th,
[1:08:26] 2015.
[1:08:28] That Jesus Christ that came out of the
[1:08:30] tomb is here, right beside you, right
[1:08:34] near you. And he's a God that fills all
[1:08:36] time and space. He's a God where there's
[1:08:40] nothing impossible with him. He can turn
[1:08:43] the world upside down and he can turn
[1:08:46] your life upside down. Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Prophet speaks about Moses. He said,
[1:08:58] "Now he was 80 years old." That blessed
[1:09:01] me and he knowed more about God in five
[1:09:04] minutes in the presence of that bush.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Than he learned in 80 years in the
[1:09:10] schools of Egypt.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "What Moses lacked the bush
[1:09:15] had."
[1:09:17] I say what you lack,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; the bush has.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; That fire has never left. That fire has
[1:09:26] never been quenched. That fire has never
[1:09:29] lessened in its intensity.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; For God was in the fire and God by his
[1:09:35] spirit. And God in Christ said, "I will
[1:09:39] be in you."
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; You've heard it over over again. It's
[1:09:44] not to make you feel better or to make
[1:09:47] you feel more elite or have a higher
[1:09:50] status. It's something that you know and
[1:09:53] you quietly experience.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; He said and uh and what the seminaries
[1:10:07] lack tonight, the Holy Ghost has got the
[1:10:11] same fire of God. What the schools need
[1:10:15] is fire. Holy Ghost and fire.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; In the presence of that fire. And this
[1:10:22] is my emphasis to you. In the presence
[1:10:25] of that fire,
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; he had an experience. He was running
[1:10:30] from Egypt before and now he goes to
[1:10:35] Egypt. So maybe the thing that we cower
[1:10:38] from is the thing that God will have us
[1:10:40] and fill us with something that we face
[1:10:43] it
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; head on.
[1:10:47] God spoke to Moses and said, "Behold, I
[1:10:49] send an angel before thee." This was
[1:10:52] later to keep thee in the way and to
[1:10:55] bring thee into the place which I have
[1:10:58] prepared. That was another place that
[1:11:01] was further on. uh it makes no
[1:11:03] difference to where you are in your
[1:11:05] spiritual life.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; It's to take you from this place to
[1:11:08] another place.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about the change of
[1:11:12] the body. I'm talking about our status
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; and our level of life here and our
[1:11:18] spiritual life here. And there is a
[1:11:21] place
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; by me, he said. And there was a
[1:11:26] different time
[1:11:29] when Moses had asked and I perhaps we'll
[1:11:33] just uh you don't have to turn to it but
[1:11:37] I'm going to just look at it because
[1:11:39] that's it's one of my favorite places in
[1:11:42] Moses experience in his life.
[1:11:47] Moses had said to the Lord, you'll just
[1:11:49] listen to me. I don't want you reading.
[1:11:51] He said to the Lord, "See,
[1:11:54] thou sayest to me, you said to me, bring
[1:11:56] up this people, and thou not let me know
[1:12:01] whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou
[1:12:05] hast said, I know thee by name, and thou
[1:12:08] hast also found grace in my sight." Now
[1:12:12] therefore, I pray thee, if I found grace
[1:12:14] in thy sight, show me now thy way, that
[1:12:18] I may know thee, that I may find grace
[1:12:21] to thy sight, in thy sight, and consider
[1:12:25] that this nation is thy people, because
[1:12:28] God had always put the responsibility on
[1:12:30] Moses.
[1:12:33] And he said, "My presence
[1:12:36] shall go with thee."
[1:12:40] And the prophet of God said to
[1:12:41] multitudes
[1:12:43] and perhaps you sense it this morning
[1:12:46] said, "You're feeling different now."
[1:12:50] This maybe not an average Sunday morning
[1:12:52] service. You're feeling different now.
[1:12:55] If you are, it's his presence.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Then he's come to you for a personal
[1:13:00] reason.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:04] And that's the way our services need to
[1:13:06] be.
[1:13:09] said, "I will give thee rest.
[1:13:12] My presence shall go with thee, and I
[1:13:14] will give thee rest." And he said unto
[1:13:16] him, "If thy presence go not with me,
[1:13:18] carry us not up hither.
[1:13:22] For wherein shall it be known here that
[1:13:26] I and thy people have found grace on thy
[1:13:29] sight? Is it not in that thou goest with
[1:13:32] us? So shall we be separated,
[1:13:36] I and thy people." Now he calls them thy
[1:13:38] people
[1:13:40] for all the people that are upon the
[1:13:42] face of the earth. And the Lord said
[1:13:45] unto Moses, I will do this thing also
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; that thou hast spoken, for thou has
[1:13:51] found grace in my sight, and I know thee
[1:13:54] by name.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; And I thought, I have a father.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; He knows my name.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; He knows your address.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; He knows where you're sitting this
[1:14:05] morning.
[1:14:08] And he said, "I beseech thee."
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Moses said, "I beseech thee, show me thy
[1:14:14] glory."
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; God said, "I will make all my goodness
[1:14:21] pass before thee,
[1:14:23] and I will proclaim the name of the Lord
[1:14:27] before thee,
[1:14:29] and I will be gracious to whom I will be
[1:14:31] gracious, and will show mercy on whom I
[1:14:34] will show mercy. And he said, "Thou
[1:14:37] canst not see my face, for there shall
[1:14:40] no man see me and live." And the Lord
[1:14:44] said, "Behold,
[1:14:46] there is a place by me."
[1:14:50] And that's my me message.
[1:14:53] There is a place
[1:14:55] by me. And thou shalt stand upon a rock.
[1:15:08] He says, "And if we,"
[1:15:12] this was in the Africa report
[1:15:15] service, he said, "And if we'll read the
[1:15:17] scripture, we find out that it was a
[1:15:20] pillar of fire that led the children of
[1:15:22] Israel."
[1:15:24] The same pillar of fire, I believe, was
[1:15:27] over Jesus Christ.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; And I believe he's risen from the dead.
[1:15:33] showing the same signs that he showed
[1:15:36] when he was here on earth. And it is the
[1:15:39] same pillar of fire
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; that's over the church
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; right now,
[1:15:47] the same angel of God
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; and that same presence of God. I have to
[1:15:54] say in a Cloverdale Bible way, either
[1:15:57] everything he said was false or
[1:15:59] everything he said is true. And I
[1:16:02] believe that that is true. And I believe
[1:16:04] the church ought to say yay and amen. I
[1:16:07] believe that is true. I believe that
[1:16:09] same pillar of fire is here in this
[1:16:11] building. I believe that same angel of
[1:16:13] the Lord is here. The one that stood
[1:16:15] between the prophet and his people. The
[1:16:18] one that stood when he was speaking.
[1:16:19] Even when he said, "I'm speaking through
[1:16:21] the pillar of fire." I feel as though
[1:16:24] I'm speaking through that pillar of fire
[1:16:26] this morning. Not because I feel it, but
[1:16:28] because there's a sanctity. There is a
[1:16:31] seriousness in this atmosphere and God
[1:16:34] has gripped your attention because he
[1:16:37] wants this to be nailed down in your
[1:16:39] heart. This God is present.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; You may be sick. You may be bound. You
[1:16:50] may not be saved. You may not have had a
[1:16:53] new birth. That pillar of fire is here
[1:16:58] to do that. If you can just make contact
[1:17:01] with him,
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; it's extremely important to recognize or
[1:17:11] to know the place we occupy in the
[1:17:14] stages of life.
[1:17:21] A place and a book.
[1:17:24] And there was delivered unto him unto
[1:17:26] Jesus
[1:17:28] the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when
[1:17:30] he had opened the book, he found he
[1:17:33] found the place.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. When he was here, he found
[1:17:40] the place where it was written, "The
[1:17:42] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[1:17:44] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:17:47] the poor. He hath sent me to heal the
[1:17:50] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[1:17:52] the captives, and recovering of sight to
[1:17:55] the blind, and to set at liberty them
[1:17:57] that are bruised, to preach the
[1:17:59] acceptable year of the Lord. And he
[1:18:01] closed the book. And if you read in
[1:18:03] Isaiah, it's halfway through the verse.
[1:18:05] And he closed the book. Halfway through
[1:18:08] the scripture, he closed the book. And
[1:18:11] he and and sat down in the eyes of all
[1:18:13] of them in the synagogue were all
[1:18:15] fastened on him. And he began to say
[1:18:18] unto them, "This day is this scripture
[1:18:22] fulfilled in your ears." That was moving
[1:18:25] them to another state. Some loved it
[1:18:28] perhaps. Some hated it. Some didn't want
[1:18:31] to hear it. Some said, "We've read that
[1:18:33] scripture thousands of times." But now
[1:18:36] is a different moment.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; This day
[1:18:41] is this scripture.
[1:18:43] And that same Lord Jesus came in this
[1:18:46] generation in another body, a redeemed
[1:18:50] body, an adopted son of God that he
[1:18:53] called a prophet to go through the pages
[1:18:55] of the book. And we had brother Tom here
[1:18:58] the other day declaring with all such
[1:19:01] force and intensity Malachi 4, he found
[1:19:05] in the book. He found in the book the
[1:19:08] place where it is read, "Behold, I send
[1:19:11] you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn
[1:19:15] the hearts and you can say that is me."
[1:19:18] And if it has not happened, you say it.
[1:19:21] My heart has not been turned yet, but
[1:19:24] this pillar of fire is present to turn
[1:19:27] my heart. And I have faith. I have faith
[1:19:31] that he will do so.
[1:19:35] And when my heart is turned, I will be
[1:19:37] what he wants me to be. I'll be the
[1:19:40] witness he wants me to be. I'll be the
[1:19:43] kind of man, the kind of woman, the kind
[1:19:45] of young person he wants me to be. I
[1:19:48] won't be what I am.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you're a devoted,
[1:19:53] yielded believer, but who can be
[1:19:56] something more than you are. Say, "What
[1:19:59] do you desire, oh God? Let thy will be
[1:20:02] done on earth.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; I can assure you he is not going to come
[1:20:08] and say my will is that you'll just come
[1:20:12] and sit in church
[1:20:15] this Sunday.
[1:20:17] No, his will is that your heart will
[1:20:20] burn with a fire and a fervor where
[1:20:24] there will be a dedication to God and a
[1:20:27] yieldedness to him. Say, "Oh God, thy
[1:20:31] will be done."
[1:20:33] Even though you may hear things you've
[1:20:34] heard many times,
[1:20:37] but the Holy Spirit will punctuate it.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; This day,
[1:20:48] this day relates to this place.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; The place he found the place
[1:20:56] in the book
[1:20:59] And then he said, "This day is this
[1:21:02] scripture fulfilled." This day, the
[1:21:04] phrase this day refers to this place in
[1:21:07] the book.
[1:21:10] And that now what they were seeing was
[1:21:13] this day in the book being interpreted.
[1:21:16] Oh, this is what's happening. Oh, this
[1:21:18] is the person. We thought he was just
[1:21:21] Joseph's child. We thought he was just
[1:21:23] from we his brothers and so on are here.
[1:21:26] We we thought we knew this man, but now
[1:21:29] here is the one who spoke the wonderful
[1:21:31] words on the mount on the sermon on the
[1:21:34] mount. Now we see who it is.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody caught it.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; I want to say, oh God, if I was there in
[1:21:44] the service, if I was in the synagogue,
[1:21:46] if you were in the synagogue, would you
[1:21:48] have caught that?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; We're sitting here today to catch
[1:21:52] something. We're in another day. We're
[1:21:54] in another hour.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Charlie Mitchell
[1:22:05] was a good friend of mine.
[1:22:09] I didn't know him when he was a minor,
[1:22:11] but he told me
[1:22:14] he told me and also brother Fulture,
[1:22:17] Ernest Fulture,
[1:22:21] and he was a minor
[1:22:24] working for the coal mines in Virginia.
[1:22:29] And taking in that dust,
[1:22:32] he developed a tumor in his left lung
[1:22:35] about the size of a man's fist.
[1:22:39] and his pastor was Ernest Fulture where
[1:22:43] I was preaching
[1:22:46] and
[1:22:48] brother Fulture told him there's a man
[1:22:50] by the name of William Brandham that
[1:22:53] prays for the sick
[1:22:56] and I'll take you to his meeting when he
[1:22:59] comes and has a meeting. They were
[1:23:00] having meetings I think in her
[1:23:02] auditorium in Jeffersonville.
[1:23:06] It was the 1965 and and the message was
[1:23:10] this day is this scripture fulfilled
[1:23:14] and Charlie Mitchell told me that he had
[1:23:16] never seen the man had never been there
[1:23:18] had never heard of him
[1:23:20] and his pastor Ernest Fulture took him
[1:23:25] and now in the message brother Brandham
[1:23:28] is just these are the I' I've taken just
[1:23:30] a few words because I know where it was
[1:23:33] and I interviewed Charlie Mitchell
[1:23:35] in Rowan Oak, Virginia at the television
[1:23:38] station.
[1:23:41] I don't want to tell relate the story to
[1:23:45] you, but it was it was gripping.
[1:23:49] And the prophet said in that service, he
[1:23:51] says, "But what about the elect group?
[1:23:55] What about them? If we say, well, we're
[1:23:57] elect. What about that group?" He said,
[1:24:00] "What kind of sign are they supposed to
[1:24:02] say?
[1:24:04] What are they supposed to have?
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to have?
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; He said it. Hallelujah. It shall be
[1:24:14] light in the evening time.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; If we say we're that group, then that
[1:24:18] light is shone upon us.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; This day is the scripture fulfilled.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; This day God's promises fulfilled.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; We know that to be the truth. He is here
[1:24:32] tonight as he was then. And I say to
[1:24:35] you, in the authority of God's word, on
[1:24:38] authority of everything he said, he's
[1:24:40] here this morning as he was then. He's
[1:24:43] here this morning as he walked out of
[1:24:44] the out of the up the banks of the
[1:24:46] Jordan River when the Holy Spirit, this
[1:24:49] is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:24:52] pleased. And that's it's up to us to
[1:24:54] say, "Oh God, I believe it is you. What
[1:24:58] is it that you'd have me to know?
[1:25:07] What's consuming? What's taking up our
[1:25:09] life?
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Is it of eternal value?
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now to preach it as I am, and
[1:25:23] I I feel such a heavy responsibility.
[1:25:26] I'm just on the verge of breaking down
[1:25:31] to preach it.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; That I said a while ago, if you preach
[1:25:35] anything and it's the gospel truth, then
[1:25:38] God is obligated to vindicate that.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Not back here when he said that today
[1:25:45] while I'm repeating your word.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; God is here to vindicate that.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Is it true and the
[1:25:56] congregation said amen such as you have
[1:25:58] now?" Now he said, "If that be so, let
[1:26:00] the God that wrote the word, let the God
[1:26:04] that made the prophecy, let the God who
[1:26:07] is God of the word come forth and prove
[1:26:09] that he's still God."
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; This is burning on my soul, Sister
[1:26:15] Tracy, wherever you are.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; It's burning on my soul. All of these
[1:26:21] things, this is what I've been studying
[1:26:23] and looking to the Lord for about the
[1:26:25] last few weeks.
[1:26:29] this place.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; We don't need a place of history.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; We don't need some scripture been
[1:26:35] fulfilled 2,000 years ago. We need a
[1:26:39] scripture in the book that's happening
[1:26:41] now.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Let the God who wrote the word, let the
[1:26:50] God who made the prophecy, let the God
[1:26:52] who is God of the word come forth and
[1:26:54] prove that he is God. That was Jesus
[1:26:57] yesterday.
[1:26:58] He said that was him today. That's him
[1:27:02] today. You believe that?
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, of course we believe that. He said
[1:27:07] there is a man sitting right back here.
[1:27:11] Now, that man has never laid eyes on him
[1:27:14] before. He's laying eyes on him in a
[1:27:17] vision. Said, "There's a man sitting
[1:27:19] right back here. He is suffering. He's
[1:27:22] got a tumor on his left lung. He doesn't
[1:27:26] He isn't from here. You have been a mine
[1:27:30] worker. Oh, do you know why he said you
[1:27:32] have been a mind worker? He never went
[1:27:35] back to the mines. Even though he was
[1:27:37] completely healed, he became a a
[1:27:40] preacher. He became a pastor of this
[1:27:42] message for years. And he lived a
[1:27:46] healthy life till God called him home. I
[1:27:49] say this God,
[1:27:53] you ought to say it. This God is my God.
[1:27:58] [Applause]
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:02] [Music]
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; You go ahead and thank him. You go ahead
[1:28:08] and get what you're supposed to get.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; You have been a mind worker. that is
[1:28:19] right. I'm a total stranger to you. If
[1:28:22] that's right, shake your hand. And when
[1:28:24] I interviewed him, he shook his hand and
[1:28:27] the tumors in your left lung and you're
[1:28:29] up for an operation right away. He was
[1:28:31] to Bristol to Elizabeth till I believe
[1:28:34] it was on the third city to three cities
[1:28:37] because the mining company was concerned
[1:28:40] about their uh the degree of their
[1:28:42] liability on him. and they sent them
[1:28:45] from one hospital to another hospital to
[1:28:48] the third hospital. And when they they
[1:28:50] said that that tumor has to come out and
[1:28:53] they wanted to operate right away and he
[1:28:56] wanted to go to this meeting first. And
[1:28:58] now here's a man declaring you're up for
[1:29:00] an operation.
[1:29:03] Your tumor's in your left lung and
[1:29:05] you're up for an operation right away.
[1:29:09] And that is right. And you're not from
[1:29:11] here. You're from out of town. you're
[1:29:14] from Virginia and he knows that you're
[1:29:16] from Langley or he knows you're from
[1:29:19] Surrey or he knows you're from London or
[1:29:22] in Lynon or he knows you're from
[1:29:24] Richmond. He knows exactly your address
[1:29:27] like some that he he told here and it
[1:29:30] wasn't him. It was the pillar fire. The
[1:29:32] pillar fire knows your house number.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; The pillar fire knows what time you
[1:29:37] walked into this church.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; And that's who you have to believe in.
[1:29:46] That's who it is.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You sense you maybe feel something. He
[1:29:52] said you're not feeling the same. You're
[1:29:54] feeling different now. Why are you
[1:29:56] feeling different? It's not just a
[1:29:58] preaching. It's not just something. It's
[1:30:00] not just a song that might touch the
[1:30:02] emotions. It's not just some excitement
[1:30:04] that might touch your emotion. The God
[1:30:08] who stood and spoke to Moses,
[1:30:12] that God still got a voice. That God can
[1:30:15] address your situation.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; So I have a question. That God has the
[1:30:21] answer.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; I remember that prophet spoke to a
[1:30:30] woman. He said, "And you're all
[1:30:32] troubled." He said, "And the reason
[1:30:34] you're troubled is there's trouble." She
[1:30:36] said, "That's right." He said, "There's
[1:30:38] trouble in your church." And he said,
[1:30:40] "There's some business things going on
[1:30:43] and they trouble you." And he said, "And
[1:30:46] I can tell you they're over."
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; That God,
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; why don't you say it? That God
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; is my God.
[1:31:00] Amen.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say it, young man?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; That God
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; is my God.
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; That God knows my problem.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; That God knows my ailment.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; That God knows my dilemma. That God
[1:31:21] knows my burden. And I leave it to that
[1:31:24] God to fix it up.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; I give myself to that God.
[1:31:36] And he went back to Virginia
[1:31:39] and he went back to the same hospital
[1:31:43] and they took a picture of his lung and
[1:31:46] there was no tumor there.
[1:31:49] That God is my God.
[1:31:54] When I heard that tumor, there's no
[1:31:56] blood going through it. Sister Tracy and
[1:31:59] I started to die in a doctor saying it
[1:32:01] started to die three weeks ago. That God
[1:32:05] is my God.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Not my faith, her faith.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Not the prophet's faith, your faith.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; God's not here to bless a preacher. He's
[1:32:16] here to bless his children, his people
[1:32:19] that he loves.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can hear the heart of God if they
[1:32:24] only knew how I craved
[1:32:28] to fellowship with him, to walk with
[1:32:30] him. He said, "You make a tabernacle as
[1:32:32] I want to dwell with the people."
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; That's a cry of his heart. He wants to
[1:32:38] dwell with them.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want to spend a couple hours
[1:32:41] with you on Sunday.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; The unic of Ethiopia.
[1:32:53] I'll just close with brother Fulture.
[1:32:57] Virginia is the place of his home.
[1:33:00] Brother Mitchell was brought by brother
[1:33:03] Ernest, Reverend Ernest Fulture, to that
[1:33:07] meeting
[1:33:09] in Jeffersonville,
[1:33:10] another place.
[1:33:13] He was transferred
[1:33:15] from a sick man to a man of perfect
[1:33:18] health. He was transferred from a mine
[1:33:20] worker to a pastor. That's my God.
[1:33:26] Do you believe in that kind of God,
[1:33:27] friends?
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Is this not a regular service? I don't
[1:33:34] know what's going to happen. Amen.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; A man of great authority.
[1:33:48] Unic of Ethiopia,
[1:33:52] great authority and status over all the
[1:33:54] treasure of Candace the Queen. Candace
[1:33:57] was not her name as such.
[1:34:00] If you read the history, Ethiopia
[1:34:04] was a very large
[1:34:07] and powerful kingdom.
[1:34:10] And Candice,
[1:34:12] the real name is Kandake
[1:34:16] also. Candice or Kanddeck
[1:34:20] was the name that was the name of all
[1:34:23] queens
[1:34:25] or queen mothers
[1:34:28] in Ethiopia
[1:34:30] and there they were mighty warriors some
[1:34:33] of them and Candice this one here was a
[1:34:37] mighty warrior. It is said that
[1:34:40] Alexander the Great in his invasions and
[1:34:42] taking country after country after
[1:34:44] country when she heard he was coming,
[1:34:48] she set her throne on two elephants and
[1:34:52] came to the edge of the river where they
[1:34:55] would cross and had her armies all lined
[1:34:58] up. And when they said when Alex, this
[1:35:02] is one of the theories when Alexander
[1:35:05] the Great saw that
[1:35:07] he was afraid that he might be defeated
[1:35:09] and he especially didn't want to be
[1:35:11] defeated by a woman and he backed away.
[1:35:15] And she's the only one that overcame
[1:35:18] Alexander the Great.
[1:35:20] She was a very very prominent and
[1:35:24] powerful and her kingdom was enormous.
[1:35:26] It took in all of Egypt
[1:35:29] and further south.
[1:35:32] This man was a man of such stature.
[1:35:37] He didn't have to have a convoy of armed
[1:35:42] men for security.
[1:35:45] And Philillip, he didn't question
[1:35:47] Philillip, where did you come from out
[1:35:49] in this desert?
[1:35:51] Everything was everything was just
[1:35:54] timed. His hunger was ready to receive
[1:35:57] him and he was reading in the scripture
[1:36:00] in the place
[1:36:03] the place he was wounded for our
[1:36:05] transgressions. He's bruised for our
[1:36:07] iniquities. He's led as a lamb to the
[1:36:10] slaughter
[1:36:12] and as a sheep before her shears is
[1:36:14] dumb. So he opened not his mouth.
[1:36:18] Philip said, "Do you know where you're
[1:36:19] reading?
[1:36:25] I read hundreds of times,
[1:36:28] perhaps that's an exaggeration, I read
[1:36:30] many times, I'll say
[1:36:32] Revelation 10 and one.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; And I saw another mighty angel.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Who's he speaking of? I didn't know.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Who's he speaking of? Is he speaking of
[1:36:44] some angel from heaven or is he speaking
[1:36:46] of who's he speaking of? I don't know.
[1:36:49] Did you know?
[1:36:51] Thank God that same Lord Jesus came in
[1:36:55] the form of a man and opened up the book
[1:36:59] to us and told us who that was and now I
[1:37:02] can say oh Lord Jesus it was you
[1:37:08] [Music]
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; and a unic is saying how can I tell
[1:37:12] unless somebody tells me I don't know
[1:37:15] who is he speaking of himself the
[1:37:17] prophet Isaiah or is he speaking of
[1:37:19] someone else. And starting at that
[1:37:23] scripture, he preached to him, Jesus.
[1:37:27] And I say, starting at that scripture,
[1:37:30] this prophet of God preached to me,
[1:37:32] Jesus.
[1:37:34] Resurrected.
[1:37:37] Hallelujah. This Jesus descending. This
[1:37:41] Jesus with an open book in his hand.
[1:37:44] This Jesus interpreting the word. The
[1:37:47] same Jesus that wrote the word is here
[1:37:50] interpreting the word. Hallelujah.
[1:37:54] Let the people of God give him glory.
[1:38:11] And Philip opened his mouth
[1:38:14] as many of you have and began at the
[1:38:16] same scripture
[1:38:18] and preached unto him Jesus.
[1:38:22] The unic had the scriptures.
[1:38:27] The world has a Bible. The churches had
[1:38:29] the Bible. You had the Bible.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; And when anyone else says today, well, I
[1:38:36] see in the message, well, I don't know
[1:38:38] if it means that. What did it mean
[1:38:40] before he came?
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; What it mean before the message? What
[1:38:44] did what was your understanding before?
[1:38:47] Then go back to that understanding and
[1:38:50] be in total confusion.
[1:39:07] He did not know that.
[1:39:11] He did not know. And we can say we did
[1:39:14] not know that scripture referred to our
[1:39:17] day.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; He did not know that scripture referred
[1:39:21] to his day.
[1:39:24] He did not know that it had been
[1:39:26] fulfilled.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Neither did we.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; And he did not know that it included
[1:39:32] him.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Thank God we found out it included us.
[1:39:37] [Music]
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Not to put us in another building and
[1:39:43] another place, but to put us in a place
[1:39:46] where he could talk to us, where he
[1:39:48] could reveal himself to us.
[1:39:51] And the revelation is a continuing
[1:39:53] revelation. If you haven't experienced
[1:39:55] it yet, today is the day.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; I know brother Tom, brother John is
[1:40:06] going to preach
[1:40:08] this evening,
[1:40:11] but I'm going to finish.
[1:40:14] I have to finish.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; The Bible or you hold
[1:40:20] includes you.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible you hold
[1:40:28] which is Christ knows your real need.
[1:40:31] Amen.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; And this
[1:40:40] I felt that I must say
[1:40:42] this
[1:40:44] is the right place.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; You don't belong in any other place. You
[1:40:50] belong here so you can meet him
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; at this morning meeting I'm talking
[1:40:55] about. I don't care where you go to
[1:40:57] church or anything else. Not talking
[1:40:59] about that. But I'm not talking about
[1:41:00] Cloverdale, by the way. That's not the
[1:41:02] place. But you're in a place of worship.
[1:41:04] You're in a place of sanctuary. You're
[1:41:07] in a place that supports and believes
[1:41:09] the word that God has sent and has found
[1:41:11] it in the book. This is the place.
[1:41:14] [Applause]
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Don't stay in your problem.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Don't stay in your dilemma.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Don't stay where you haven't got an
[1:41:25] answer.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; This is the place. Amen.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; And as you believe it, you'll go on and
[1:41:33] look back and you'll say, "That was the
[1:41:35] morning. That was the place. And that
[1:41:38] was the service."
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; You must come to the place where you
[1:41:45] say, "This is me."
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet of God asked the
[1:41:51] people when he was telling them and and
[1:41:53] revealing their situation, he said, "Is
[1:41:55] that right?" and they would say that is
[1:41:58] right.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not a prophet or a son of a prophet.
[1:42:03] But on the other hand, we are not merely
[1:42:05] quoting from a prophet. We're serving
[1:42:07] the God of Elijah, the God of William
[1:42:10] Brandham, the God and father of our Lord
[1:42:13] Jesus Christ. He's the one and he's the
[1:42:17] one who could only say, "I will be in
[1:42:19] you. I will be with you and in you."
[1:42:24] I say this is a place I say Lord Jesus,
[1:42:28] you pillar of fire,
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; you that spoke to Moses, you that spoke
[1:42:33] to Paul, Apostle Paul, you're the one
[1:42:35] that's here speaking to me and speaking
[1:42:38] through me.
[1:42:40] If I didn't believe that, I'd close my
[1:42:42] Bible and walk away from this pulpit.
[1:42:47] Amen.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; This is the right place.
[1:42:54] Make known
[1:42:56] his desire.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; What is your desire, Father?
[1:43:02] The unic read, he was led as a sheep to
[1:43:06] the slaughter and like a sheep and like
[1:43:08] a lamb before his shears. Is so he
[1:43:12] opened not his mouth. I read and we read
[1:43:16] and I saw another mighty angel come down
[1:43:20] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:43:25] rainbow was upon his head. His covenant
[1:43:27] was over his head and his face was as it
[1:43:30] were the sun and his feet as pillars of
[1:43:33] fire. We didn't know but I say to you
[1:43:37] today now we know.
[1:43:41] And the unic could say, "Here's water.
[1:43:44] What does hinder me?"
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; And I saw the word open up from Genesis
[1:43:49] to Revelation. I said, "This is a
[1:43:52] message. What does hinder me?" What
[1:43:55] hinder you? Nothing hinders you. This
[1:43:57] flesh will try to stand in the way. This
[1:44:00] flesh will try to press you down. But
[1:44:02] this is the word for you.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; This is the message and this is the
[1:44:07] place. And you're in the right place.
[1:44:13] [Applause]
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:28] understand God and his headship.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; We began to understand the Melzdc
[1:44:33] priesthood.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; We began to understand something about
[1:44:36] the Theophony body. Why don't you want
[1:44:39] to know where you're going?
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; We began to understand what makes us
[1:44:46] strong and what makes us weak.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; We began to understand
[1:44:58] the voice
[1:45:00] of the resurrected
[1:45:02] Jesus Christ.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; And if one thing ever stood out to me,
[1:45:08] and I've said it hundreds of times, this
[1:45:10] to me, this is the rapture call.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; And I believe I said those words to you,
[1:45:16] Brother Tim, on our first meeting.
[1:45:20] You told us of a dream when you were in
[1:45:23] your youth, a child,
[1:45:26] and it concerned you. And I never did
[1:45:28] say, but I had this similar dream when I
[1:45:32] was a boy.
[1:45:35] And I saw
[1:45:37] mother and father.
[1:45:40] And I I had to I had to stand up. But
[1:45:42] God was telling me in my youth, I wasn't
[1:45:45] even 12 years old. I wasn't even 10.
[1:45:50] I was about seven
[1:45:53] years old
[1:45:55] and there were some spots on the garment
[1:45:57] and I saw those spots. I knew they had
[1:46:00] to get off so that I could be in this
[1:46:02] rapture. That touched me. When you told
[1:46:06] me yours, that touched me.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; And here he is now. Been ministering
[1:46:12] alongside, been a pastor for 28 years. I
[1:46:16] think did it change his place? Yes, it
[1:46:19] changes place.
[1:46:21] This is the rapture call.
[1:46:24] I say it and you should say it also. I
[1:46:26] have been called. I'm here because of
[1:46:28] the rapture call. Not here because I was
[1:46:31] born into it. I'm not here because
[1:46:33] someone convinced me into it. I'm here
[1:46:35] because I heard the voice
[1:46:38] of the Lord Jesus Christ. I hear the
[1:46:40] voice of the angel as he's coming down
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; doing all three. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; The shout,
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; the voice, and the resurrection, and the
[1:46:53] trumpet call.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, friends, I must feel I'm beside
[1:47:01] myself.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I'm expecting an explosion
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; of of happenings,
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; of God doing things.
[1:47:14] I'm preaching that your faith may be
[1:47:16] increased.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching that you might meet him,
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; this pillar of fire,
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; and receive what you need.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Young men, young ladies,
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; families,
[1:47:30] children, single ones, this is your God.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:46] He said we must find in God's only
[1:47:48] provided place. God's only provided
[1:47:51] place.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; We must find where he did put his name.
[1:47:56] For it is his only provided place.
[1:48:00] There's not a dozen places, friends.
[1:48:02] There's only one provided place where
[1:48:05] God put his name. He said, "And he will
[1:48:07] only receive worship in that place." And
[1:48:10] his name is manifested in what he does.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; When he says, "You got a tumor in your
[1:48:18] left lung," the name of God is being
[1:48:21] manifested.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Interpreted that that's him speaking.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Why can't we see that?
[1:48:31] That's not for you to turn over in your
[1:48:33] mind. Forget turning it over in your
[1:48:35] mind. Just accept and acknowledge it.
[1:48:38] That's God speaking.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; The son always takes the father's name
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; in every case. I came into the earth, he
[1:48:53] said, with the name of a brom because my
[1:48:56] father's name was Branom. Jesus said, I
[1:48:59] come in my father's name and you receive
[1:49:02] me not. He said, "You want the scripture
[1:49:05] for that?" Yes. John 5:43.
[1:49:08] I came in my father's name.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; And he said, "The name of the father is
[1:49:13] Jesus."
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; And he's the way. He's the door. He's
[1:49:24] the house.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; I will say he's the place.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; I thought of calling this message a
[1:49:29] place called Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; That's the place. There is no other
[1:49:37] place
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; where to go to church. I go to church in
[1:49:40] a place called Jesus Christ.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; He's my place.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; He's the secret dwelling place of
[1:49:48] almighty God.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; And the name here he explains it. I want
[1:49:55] you to hear it. I would have put this on
[1:49:57] the screen, but I didn't have time. And
[1:50:00] the name, the name is the word because
[1:50:05] he is the word. Amen. And what is it?
[1:50:08] What is he then? The word interpreted
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; is the manifestation of the name. The
[1:50:16] word interpreted
[1:50:18] when the word and and the word can only
[1:50:20] be truth. In him was truth. So when a
[1:50:23] prophet of God speaks and that's why he
[1:50:26] said hundreds and thousands of times is
[1:50:28] that the truth and they would say yes
[1:50:32] that's the interpretation
[1:50:34] of the manifestation of the name that is
[1:50:38] the name of Jesus Christ on whom we
[1:50:40] believe
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; you Jesus
[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; I was I was hoping you'd be there
[1:50:49] brother Ellie I need you this Morning.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Give him glory.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; The word interpreted is a manifestation
[1:51:03] of the name of God.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; No wonder flesh and blood hath not
[1:51:09] revealed this to you. But my father
[1:51:12] which is in heaven has revealed this to
[1:51:15] you. Who am I? And upon this rock I'll
[1:51:19] build my my my place of worship.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; On this rock I'll build my place of
[1:51:26] worship. That is why he said there is a
[1:51:29] place by me
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; and thou shalt be upon a rock.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:43] my place of worship and the gates of
[1:51:46] hell shall can't shake it down.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your situation is. You
[1:51:53] want to look that devil in the eyeball
[1:51:56] and put the blame where it belongs. Say,
[1:52:00] "You can't shake me. You'll never shake
[1:52:03] this message out of me."
[1:52:06] And the sh and the more he shakes, the
[1:52:08] more it takes root down deeper.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God.
[1:52:24] [Music]
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Every once in a while people re talk
[1:52:28] about, well, you went through a lot of
[1:52:30] trouble some time ago. That doesn't I I
[1:52:33] thank God for it.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; It makes your roots go deeper.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Nothing can happen to the saints of God
[1:52:43] unless God allows it. And he allows it
[1:52:46] for their benefit.
[1:52:48] [Music]
[1:52:50] [Applause]
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Are you in the right place? Amen.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron, I spoke to you before the
[1:53:02] service and that's why I spoke to you.
[1:53:04] This is the place.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; The pillar fire with the answer.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Your answer.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; We need to receive it in the name of
[1:53:19] Jesus Christ.
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:31] Hallelujah.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Yet a little while in the world seeth me
[1:53:33] no more.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; But you see me
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; because I live. You shall live also.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; And at that day, you shall know.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; You shall know. You will not guess. You
[1:53:47] will not have to feel it. You shall know
[1:53:50] I'm in the father and you in me and I in
[1:53:54] you. Who is it then at this pulpit
[1:53:57] today? Jesus Christ in a vessel. Who is
[1:54:02] it in your seat? It's Jesus Christ in a
[1:54:05] vessel. And then you can believe what he
[1:54:08] sent is for me.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; You believe that on the balconies? You
[1:54:15] believe that over here? This is a place.
[1:54:20] [Music]
[1:54:25] [Applause]
[1:54:29] If you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:54:31] you,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; you shall ask what you will
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; and it shall be done
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; unto you.
[1:54:58] Amen.
[1:55:09] Hallelujah.
[1:55:13] Come sir.
[1:55:17] What a messenger said
[1:55:20] with the same pillar of fire that is
[1:55:22] here
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; happened to be there that day.
[1:55:29] Do you believe with all your heart?
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; That's number one.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Do you believe with all your heart?
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that you're standing in
[1:55:39] his presence?
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:41] That man didn't know he was standing in
[1:55:43] his presence.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; any more than Moses knew he was standing
[1:55:48] on holy ground.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; There are some here that don't realize
[1:55:55] where you're sitting.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; You are now in his presence.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Not you will be. You are now.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; And there are many people that were in
[1:56:05] his presence that missed what they could
[1:56:08] have had.
[1:56:09] He was there on their behalf.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; He was there to bless them.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; He's your answer.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; He knows your problem.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; He knows your question. He knows the
[1:56:23] dilemma.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; And he has the answer.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; And he says, "You're in his presence.
[1:56:39] If I be God's prophet,
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; then he will reveal to me what's wrong
[1:56:44] with you.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; I am not him. As he said, I am not him.
[1:56:52] Speaking of Jesus, or I would not put
[1:56:55] myself in the place of Apostle Paul. We
[1:56:58] are not William Brham, but we are
[1:57:00] believers of the God of him and the God
[1:57:03] that sent him and the God that spoke and
[1:57:06] said you will take a message and as and
[1:57:09] your message will forrun the second
[1:57:11] coming of Jesus Christ and I can say
[1:57:13] that message has caught us. The Lord
[1:57:16] Jesus has caught us
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; and brought us to this place
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; to take us to another place.
[1:57:29] [Applause]
[1:57:33] He said, "He will reveal to me what's
[1:57:35] wrong with you." That's right. You
[1:57:38] believe that? He said, "You have some
[1:57:40] kind of spells.
[1:57:43] It's epilepsy."
[1:57:45] Oh, if we thought
[1:57:48] about epilepsy
[1:57:50] and we think, "Oh, all the things he
[1:57:52] said about epilepsy and what a powerful
[1:57:55] demon it was." But he goes, he leaves
[1:57:59] that right at that point. And he says,
[1:58:02] "And another thing, the greatest you
[1:58:06] need
[1:58:08] of all is Jesus Christ as your savior."
[1:58:12] He went up there and said, "I've got
[1:58:14] epilepsy coming on me. I'm going to go
[1:58:17] before this man. I come from my home,
[1:58:20] from my place, and I've come to another
[1:58:22] place, an auditorium. I happen to get a
[1:58:25] card." Maybe he did or he didn't. And
[1:58:27] now he's standing on the platform. What
[1:58:29] a place.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; But your real need is,
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; as they said to Moses, take off your
[1:58:38] shoes.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; You're standing on holy ground. the the
[1:58:42] the feet that walked on the beautiful
[1:58:45] carpets of Egypt and in the marble
[1:58:49] palaces. He never had never dreamed that
[1:58:53] day he got up. It was just another day
[1:58:55] with the sheep
[1:58:57] and just another day at the office. Just
[1:59:00] another day at my work grinding it all
[1:59:03] out. It's just another day. It's not
[1:59:06] just another day.
[1:59:10] Father Mike Giani, not just another day
[1:59:12] cutting meat in a shop. You're son of
[1:59:16] God with a message from the Lord with
[1:59:19] Jesus Christ dwelling in you.
[1:59:23] Let the world do what they want to do.
[1:59:25] Let the world say what they want to say.
[1:59:28] They can't beat it out of you. They
[1:59:30] can't burn it out of you. There isn't
[1:59:32] enough doubting devils in the world to
[1:59:34] get it out of you.
[1:59:38] Do you believe that?
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; How about you in the balconies? Do you
[1:59:46] believe that?
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Let me see your hands.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let me see the hands down
[1:59:54] here. We believe that. You believe that?
[1:59:57] You believe that?
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; When you are a believer, you're you're
[2:00:02] you're a receptacle for all of these
[2:00:05] things.
[2:00:07] You're in a place. You're in the right
[2:00:09] place.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Your need, the greatest need
[2:00:16] of all is Jesus Christ as your savior.
[2:00:19] Is that right? You accept him now as
[2:00:22] your personal savior. Stop smoking and
[2:00:26] everything else and you're going to give
[2:00:28] your life to Christ. Quit smoking. Throw
[2:00:31] them out of your pocket then.
[2:00:35] Hallelujah. If you're done, you're done.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; I'm finished with this stuff. I'm done
[2:00:41] with it.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:45] [Music]
[2:00:45] [Applause]
[2:00:54] I assure you that this man
[2:00:58] came to a place and heard a preacher,
[2:01:01] a place
[2:01:03] concerned about epilepsy,
[2:01:05] a place or a state of condition. didn't
[2:01:09] dream or imagine
[2:01:11] that he would find himself in the most
[2:01:13] honored place in the universe.
[2:01:19] I got to get down here.
[2:01:24] Something's been really
[2:01:26] affecting me.
[2:01:32] I love seeing
[2:01:34] the glories of the universe.
[2:01:37] And when I do and I hear the vast
[2:01:40] distances
[2:01:41] from stars
[2:01:44] and other planets
[2:01:46] and I see these great bursts
[2:01:50] from the sun
[2:01:52] going
[2:01:54] hundreds of millions of years, light
[2:01:56] years out and affecting things on Earth.
[2:02:01] I I'm challenged. My human mind is
[2:02:04] challenged.
[2:02:07] I can only go back to what a prophet
[2:02:10] said.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; He fills all time and space.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; He fills all the space between you and
[2:02:23] me.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; He fills all the space of the universe.
[2:02:28] I I can't explain that. And yet he says
[2:02:31] he's a being and he lives in a house
[2:02:34] called heaven.
[2:02:37] He's a being. He has feelings. He's
[2:02:40] grieved.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; When at times
[2:02:46] he wants to rejoice and hear worship of
[2:02:49] his people. He's a being.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; He has feelings.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; This God I don't have any words. English
[2:02:59] language is kaput. It's impossible.
[2:03:05] But when
[2:03:07] the one that came down that pillar of
[2:03:09] fire when he I want to make it and he
[2:03:11] comes down into a man behind the pulpit
[2:03:14] by the name of William Brandham and has
[2:03:17] all the same attributes and that the the
[2:03:20] attribute of humility there there's a
[2:03:22] record of a woman that's standing
[2:03:24] washing dishes a preacher's wife a great
[2:03:26] known preacher and she's washing dishes
[2:03:29] and sees a little old car uh stop in
[2:03:32] front of their place and out gets a
[2:03:33] small man which was brother Brandon in
[2:03:36] much younger days. And she said she
[2:03:38] doesn't know why, but she just broke
[2:03:39] down, began to weep because it just his
[2:03:42] his his presence emanated such humility
[2:03:46] and it just broke her down. I know what
[2:03:48] that's about.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; That God
[2:03:56] will stand there and use his mouth
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; to the place where he say, "I don't
[2:04:00] remember what I said. I don't know what
[2:04:02] I said. I have to play the tape back.
[2:04:05] and say to a man, say to a woman, and
[2:04:09] many times friends,
[2:04:11] could have been you, could have been
[2:04:13] you. In fact, is this morning it is you.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; And he said, you're standing
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; you're standing
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; on holy ground.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; You are now standing in his presence.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:34] Now what's the problem?
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Now where do we live?
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Now what is it that we need?
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; I need this. I need that. I need
[2:04:44] something else. Those things are so
[2:04:47] infatile. They're so
[2:04:50] uh they're unimportant. They're
[2:04:52] unrelated to where we are this morning.
[2:04:56] Here you are, friends, and may never
[2:04:58] have this opportunity again quite late.
[2:05:01] And a man is standing there. a man with
[2:05:04] epilepsy trying to come back with a
[2:05:06] cigarette in a pocket of of cigarettes
[2:05:09] in his pocket binding him and holding
[2:05:12] him. And to hear the words, you're
[2:05:14] standing in his presence now. There's no
[2:05:18] place in the universe like that. There's
[2:05:21] no place there's no place on earth.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Even the cities of the world just
[2:05:29] disintegrate.
[2:05:32] Hollywood doesn't exist. It's a
[2:05:34] disgusting, filthy place as it is. The
[2:05:38] earth is going to be destroyed by this
[2:05:40] holy God.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; And when the world's on fire, friends,
[2:05:45] listen to this little preacher.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; You want to be hidden in God's bosom
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; as a believer then as you are now.
[2:05:57] Hallelujah.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; I'm saying this for a purpose.
[2:06:20] Yeah.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; In one of his last messages, he trying
[2:06:23] to tell people and never resisting it,
[2:06:26] but he plowed ahead. I'm glad he plowed
[2:06:28] ahead for you and for me.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; You grew up from your birth.
[2:06:35] Everybody here has been born.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; And you, he's talking to you. You grew
[2:06:41] up from your birth. When you was born
[2:06:44] and presented into this world and God
[2:06:46] knew. I have highlighted God knew that
[2:06:50] you were going to be here in this earth
[2:06:54] and you grew up from birth to maturity.
[2:06:58] Things that seem strange, so strange to
[2:07:01] you in your young womanhood, young
[2:07:04] boyhood or children as children now seem
[2:07:08] very real. You couldn't understand it
[2:07:11] when you was a child, but now you have
[2:07:14] become adult and you begin to understand
[2:07:16] and find out that everything was just
[2:07:19] right
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; and you really it really means something
[2:07:23] to you now.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Oh friends,
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; I don't want because I know how he lived
[2:07:30] and I know how our Lord Jesus lived.
[2:07:34] I hesitate to talk about how I lived,
[2:07:38] but I shunted all over the place.
[2:07:42] Moved many times, 13 times from the time
[2:07:46] I was eight. I counted one time 17.
[2:07:50] That's irrelevant.
[2:07:53] Absolutely irrelevant.
[2:07:55] And I didn't understand it then.
[2:07:58] And I just became passive. I became a
[2:08:01] very passive child.
[2:08:03] So, you're going to live here and you go
[2:08:05] to school here and now this is what is a
[2:08:07] log school. Now you're in this place and
[2:08:09] now you're in town and now you're in
[2:08:11] this army camp and you're sleeping here
[2:08:12] and it's bitterly cold so you have to
[2:08:15] slide your bed around the old oil heater
[2:08:17] to stay warm and on and on and on.
[2:08:23] None of you young people
[2:08:26] have experienced what this man here has
[2:08:28] experienced.
[2:08:30] I can say that.
[2:08:32] You don't hear me talking about it
[2:08:36] when you were young. Maybe you go
[2:08:38] through things with your parents and you
[2:08:40] don't understand and why is this in my
[2:08:42] school and my teachers and so on so
[2:08:44] forth. God knows exactly what he's doing
[2:08:47] and why he's doing it. And when you
[2:08:49] become adult and mature in the same way
[2:08:52] spiritually, spiritually you wonder why
[2:08:55] is this and why is that and why are
[2:08:57] these things and now since I come to the
[2:08:59] message this is happening and that's
[2:09:00] happening. That's just a normal run of
[2:09:02] things. That's the way it's supposed to
[2:09:04] happen. But when you grow up in the
[2:09:06] message, when you grow up and become a
[2:09:08] mature Christian, you'll turn around,
[2:09:10] look back, and say, "Oh, that is why."
[2:09:12] Then you'll say, "Thank God.
[2:09:15] Thank God for the trial. Thank God for
[2:09:18] the hardship. Thank God when things fell
[2:09:21] apart. Thank God when I was broke.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:27] [Applause]
[2:09:30] [Music]
[2:09:37] And he said, "So it is in your spiritual
[2:09:41] birth."
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "You do things that you don't
[2:09:44] understand
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; when you're a little baby come to the
[2:09:48] altar and you give your life." And I'm
[2:09:50] not speaking for brother Jonathan now.
[2:09:53] I'm just reading. And he You give your
[2:09:55] life to Christ. He has. And I'm so glad.
[2:09:58] and you do such strange things and I'm
[2:10:00] so glad maybe not everyone's running to
[2:10:02] the altar. Thank God he is here.
[2:10:05] Something motivated him to come to the
[2:10:08] altar and I say may that pillar of fire
[2:10:11] bring to him all that he has need of. I
[2:10:15] can tell you one thing if we would all
[2:10:17] surrender if you'd surrender you that
[2:10:19] have just stood and you know I I'm not
[2:10:22] I'm just not emotional. I don't care
[2:10:24] about your emotion. You don't have to
[2:10:26] have an emotion as such, but you need to
[2:10:29] allow him to come in and allow him to
[2:10:32] mold and to agree that it is him.
[2:10:35] Acknowledge him.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:10:42] thy will be done.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Do with me as you say fit.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Here I am.
[2:10:53] Whether it's to be elevated or to be
[2:10:55] abased,
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; here I am.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Whether it's to have friends or have
[2:10:59] them leave, here I am.
[2:11:04] [Music]
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Whether it's to make a decision for a
[2:11:08] change, you must say yes, Lord.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I'll say yes to you.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; There's no other way.
[2:11:21] Dust thou believe?
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Said, "It seems so strange
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; when you staggered into that little
[2:11:39] chapel or that little place
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; and ran right down and fell down at the
[2:11:45] altar. It seems so strange. But now you
[2:11:49] understand it.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; It seems so strange when some of you
[2:11:52] came to an old Bible way house.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Gil Ashdown, Sister Karen. Seems
[2:11:59] so strange.
[2:12:01] Brother Kyle, when you are going to
[2:12:04] Victoria and those people, those sheep
[2:12:08] are precious to the Lord. They're his
[2:12:11] gems. You're looking after the gems of
[2:12:13] his clown. and to see Sister Christina
[2:12:18] playing the organ and helping them to
[2:12:21] have worship. I say the pillar of fire
[2:12:25] is present and he's either pleased or
[2:12:27] displeased. And I say to you, he is
[2:12:30] pleased with every effort.
[2:12:33] He sees the resources and the funds that
[2:12:35] are spent.
[2:12:37] And we pray
[2:12:40] for brother Don,
[2:12:44] not ashamed. If I were in need, I would
[2:12:47] want you to pray for me. I believe in
[2:12:50] the prayers of God's people.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; And you staggered into a line. You just
[2:12:59] fell at the altar. He said, "God knew
[2:13:01] that. God knew that
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; before the world was.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; God knew that before the foundation of
[2:13:10] the world. It seems strange to you then.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; You just stumbled into a place
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; and he says of his of the tabernacle and
[2:13:19] I can say that of this place because of
[2:13:22] what our desire is to get this message.
[2:13:25] We have no personal ambition. We have no
[2:13:28] human kingdom to build. We have
[2:13:31] absolutely no interest in that. None of
[2:13:33] these men have any interest in that. I
[2:13:35] can assure you I it's repulsive to me to
[2:13:38] think somebody build up a name on this
[2:13:41] message. Why? What a disgrace.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; We are here for one purpose to
[2:13:47] propagate.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Give the winds a mighty voice. Be it
[2:13:52] internet, be it disc, be it book, be it
[2:13:54] whatever it is.
[2:13:58] That's what we're here for.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; To our last breath. We will declare that
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; God has sent a voice.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; The voice of our beloved.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; This is just to help you.
[2:14:18] There came a time in Jesus life. Can I
[2:14:20] have a few more minutes?
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; There came time in Jesus life. He's
[2:14:25] going to have the last Passover.
[2:14:32] Listen, friends, he has needs, too.
[2:14:37] God needs feet.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; God needs somebody with a mouth.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; God needs a body.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; God needs your body.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; And he won't substitute it with another
[2:14:50] one.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; He needs you. Amen.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Every person in this place needs to say,
[2:14:55] "What would you have me to do?
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; What will you have me to do?"
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said,
[2:15:07] "You'll go and prepare me
[2:15:10] supper." And I want to know where. They
[2:15:14] said, "You go down the road and you'll
[2:15:17] see a man carrying a picture and he will
[2:15:20] show you a large upper room,
[2:15:24] furnished,
[2:15:26] and prepared."
[2:15:28] Doesn't sound exactly like the
[2:15:30] messenger. Why? You came here and you
[2:15:33] have this and you have that, but your
[2:15:35] real need is this and you're praying for
[2:15:37] somebody else.
[2:15:42] and he'll show you a large upper room
[2:15:45] furnished and prepared and there make
[2:15:48] ready for us.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; You'll find this place.
[2:15:58] I have just a little section here
[2:16:01] and I felt very very moved
[2:16:05] when I came to this part
[2:16:09] and brother Nathan perhaps later will
[2:16:11] sing he knows my name
[2:16:17] he knows my every thought
[2:16:22] now I said just a moment
[2:16:25] I heard a name
[2:16:27] talking to a lady. It's your husband.
[2:16:31] His first name is Lewis
[2:16:35] or something. Somebody said Lewis. Is
[2:16:38] that right? And I see your house number.
[2:16:41] It's 631
[2:16:44] 45th Street and it's right here in Palm
[2:16:47] Beach.
[2:16:49] That's not a clairvoyant, friends.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; That's not a preacher.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. says, "Somebody's over here has
[2:16:56] got pain in their knee. That has nothing
[2:16:59] to do with that. That stuff has gone out
[2:17:01] the door. I have nothing to do with that
[2:17:03] anymore. Your name is this
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; and is that right? And you live at this
[2:17:09] address. You live in Lynden or you live
[2:17:12] in Langley and he knows your house
[2:17:15] number. He knows you came to church. You
[2:17:17] left that place and you're sitting in
[2:17:19] this place." And he knew what I would be
[2:17:22] speaking. And he knew how the voice
[2:17:24] would be calling out to you. And he
[2:17:26] knows that you're here with a certain
[2:17:28] question. You're here with a certain
[2:17:30] dilemma. You're here with some problem.
[2:17:34] He's the solver of the problem.
[2:17:38] He's the worker of supernatural things.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; How old you have to be? I'm looking at a
[2:17:48] girl here.
[2:17:52] You're probably no older than Sister
[2:17:54] Biscll was when she sat in church.
[2:17:59] And to this day,
[2:18:01] there are times when I feel I can hardly
[2:18:03] make church,
[2:18:09] but I know she wants to be in church.
[2:18:14] And so I drive her to church.
[2:18:17] Sometime I sit in my office cuz my wife
[2:18:20] wants to be in church. She wants to hear
[2:18:23] the word.
[2:18:25] You don't see her up doing glorious
[2:18:28] things,
[2:18:30] but she receives the word in her soul.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; You came to church.
[2:18:40] He knows your address. He knows exactly
[2:18:42] where you come from.
[2:18:46] He knows what motivated you. He knows
[2:18:48] who invited you. He knows your
[2:18:50] situation.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Some of you grew up in a Christian home
[2:18:55] in a believer's home and God saw that
[2:18:57] and knew that.
[2:19:01] I remember sitting on the front seat in
[2:19:04] our house.
[2:19:06] Mother and dad just got saved from
[2:19:08] Catholicism.
[2:19:10] and I'd get up and go into the kitchen
[2:19:12] and comb my hair and come back. But here
[2:19:16] I am and I never forgot those days.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; I remember when I was 14. Who's 14?
[2:19:28] Anybody 14?
[2:19:30] Nobody 14? God bless you. It's tough
[2:19:33] time.
[2:19:35] There's girls here 14. and they don't
[2:19:37] want to let everybody know when they're
[2:19:39] 14.
[2:19:40] That's okay.
[2:19:42] I was 14,
[2:19:45] nailed out the kitchen chair
[2:19:49] and a man put his hand on my back
[2:19:53] and began to weep,
[2:19:56] said, "Oh, God, make Eddie a preacher."
[2:20:01] That's all he said.
[2:20:04] And here we are doing our best.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Does God have a voice?
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; He has a voice.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Does he know where you are today?
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; I saw Sister Leslie coming in with her
[2:20:19] two children this morning. And I said to
[2:20:23] my wife, "God bless her." Amen.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; And those children, those children
[2:20:29] coming into the house of God
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; and I knew what I was going to be
[2:20:33] speaking.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; God knew that you were here. He knows
[2:20:37] the address you came from in Richmond
[2:20:41] coming here to this service. And let can
[2:20:43] I finish this this please?
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; And look, this is the kind of God I'm
[2:20:52] serving.
[2:20:54] And look, your house number is 11454
[2:20:58] on McKinley Street and your name is CD.
[2:21:02] Do it.
[2:21:04] Your name is Eva and your last name is
[2:21:08] York.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; And you live in this city and your house
[2:21:12] number 6136 Street. Is that right?
[2:21:16] You're going home to Well,
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Amen.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; This is the kind of pillar of fire I
[2:21:23] want.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; This is the kind of Holy Ghost that
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; come to live in you.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; And if you have not had the Holy Spirit
[2:21:31] or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or
[2:21:33] birthed by the Holy Spirit,
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; put everything else in this life
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; aside.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; That is number one.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; You're not from here. You're not from
[2:21:48] this locality.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; No, you're from another place called El
[2:21:53] Monte, California.
[2:21:55] Something on that order. And that's
[2:21:58] right. And your name is Naomi. That's
[2:22:01] right. Moore is your last name. And your
[2:22:05] house number is 502. Something like
[2:22:07] Mullhill Street. That's right. Is that
[2:22:10] right? Now listen friends. There was
[2:22:12] multitudes of people sitting in those
[2:22:14] services like you're sitting in those
[2:22:16] services. He did not call their house
[2:22:18] number. He called their house number to
[2:22:20] let you know he knows your house number.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm doing this that it
[2:22:26] might help your faith."
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Let your faith be released.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; Put yourself in that person's place.
[2:22:34] That God is my God.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; That God who knows every detail, that's
[2:22:41] my God.
[2:22:46] Maybe some of us need to say, "Speak on,
[2:22:48] Lord.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Speak on."
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; What more would you say?
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; And I close with this.
[2:23:00] Said, "The Holy Spirit tells me." That's
[2:23:02] what he was saying. The Holy Spirit
[2:23:04] tells me, "He tells me you're not from
[2:23:07] this country.
[2:23:09] He tells me you're from Tennessee.
[2:23:13] Your name is Turner. James Turner. It's
[2:23:16] James Turner. Your house you live on,
[2:23:20] it's Third and North Street. Your house
[2:23:22] number is 223, isn't it? You're healed.
[2:23:26] Go back home.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; I say that God is my God. I'm not
[2:23:32] reading a quote. That God
[2:23:35] still speaks. Lots of other people never
[2:23:38] had their house numbers. He knows your
[2:23:40] house number. He was only doing that as
[2:23:42] evidence that the who God was and who
[2:23:45] the man was.

[2:49:11] Our Lord Jesus, we want to thank you
[2:49:14] &gt;&gt; from the very depths of our souls for
[2:49:16] all that you have done and are doing.
[2:49:18] Even now, we've heard your voice. We've
[2:49:22] heard the voice of God speaking through
[2:49:25] your prophet messenger speaking through
[2:49:26] the word speaking through the word this
[2:49:29] morning. We've heard your voice. How it
[2:49:32] is so sweetly spoke to each individual.
[2:49:35] Oh God, our hearts are moved whenever I
[2:49:38] think of Jesus.
[2:49:40] Oh Jesus, your voice is so sweet and
[2:49:43] your view, your view, your vision is so
[2:49:46] wonderful. As your messenger said, we
[2:49:49] can never be the same. Any man ever sees
[2:49:52] him, any woman ever sees him, we can
[2:49:54] never be the same. Thank you, Father,
[2:49:56] for the reality. Thank you, Father, for
[2:49:59] the message that you've given us. We are
[2:50:01] not in confusion and we're not out here
[2:50:03] in some darkness. Oh, God. Our light has
[2:50:07] come and you're shining upon us. Lord
[2:50:11] Jesus, I want to lead the people in this
[2:50:13] glorious light. Oh, Father, may their
[2:50:16] glory be with them this afternoon, this
[2:50:19] evening. As brother John ministers, let
[2:50:22] the fire of God, thy prayer, burn on
[2:50:25] every verse of scripture that burn, oh
[2:50:28] God, the words I pray into our hearts.
[2:50:31] Brand us for the rapture. Oh God, we
[2:50:34] feel prepared to go. Yes, Lord. I pray
[2:50:38] that you will bless your people, your
[2:50:40] elect, your chosen out of the earth. Oh
[2:50:44] God, you've been so gracious to us.
[2:50:47] Bless the people as they wait upon you.
[2:50:50] And as we return this evening in Jesus
[2:50:54] Christ's name, we're not going to close
[2:50:57] the service any further than this. We're
[2:50:59] your dismissed to go as you feel led to
[2:51:01] go as you're directed. We ask you to go
[2:51:04] where reverened quietly. No visitation.
