[0:00] the lord said he put my name
[0:04] on the lamb's book of alive
[0:07] and the wrong my name
[0:08] was his name
[0:11] [Music]
[0:12] i had a connection
[0:14] with the name of jesus christ
[0:16] [Music]
[0:18] the blood
[0:20] for the murphy
[0:22] and jesus
[0:23] and connected it together
[0:25] [Applause]
[0:27] i have a connection i have a blood
[0:30] relationship
[0:32] with my father
[0:34] and he said i write your name
[0:37] with my name
[0:39] the name of jesus
[0:42] the name above all name
[0:45] the name everybody has a knee
[0:48] the name everybody has to bow
[0:51] that name and cast out demon that name
[0:54] can heal
[0:55] that name can deliver
[1:01] is that i write your name
[1:04] with my name
[1:07] if he just put my name on the book it
[1:09] doesn't mean anything but is that i put
[1:12] my name
[1:14] connected with your name
[1:17] [Music]
[1:21] the blood
[1:23] verse that you made me what
[1:32] so my name is not murphy anymore
[1:37] your name
[1:38] is emerged
[1:40] it's not a human name
[1:43] but
[1:44] i wrote her name
[1:46] connected
[1:56] that's why
[1:58] satan cannot deceive you
[2:00] because he can't deceive jesus
[2:03] that's why satan cannot overcome you
[2:06] because they cannot overcome jesus
[2:13] that's why no matter what happens it
[2:15] cannot overcome you and because it
[2:17] connects your name who is the name of
[2:20] jesus
[2:23] he said i wrote your name
[2:30] you mean my name
[2:32] was jesus
[2:34] is it a heaven on earth or pass away
[2:37] by my name we should never pass away
[2:41] no matter what trials is coming but i
[2:43] connect into your name with my name
[2:46] and put your name and then in the book
[2:48] of the lamb of life
[2:51] is that he will never be erased
[2:54] no matter what satan tried to do he can
[2:57] never erase that name or brother
[2:59] because the name by the blood has
[3:02] emerged to one hand
[3:08] it deceived all
[3:10] whose name were not written
[3:15] not in the church book
[3:17] but in the lamb's book of life
[3:20] before the foundation of the world god
[3:23] wrote your name
[3:24] in the lamb's book of life as soon as it
[3:27] ends inside his friend jesus christ
[3:30] put your name is on there
[3:35] it's an abide a spoken word and sent
[3:37] jesus sent christ
[3:40] the sacrifice to buy to redeem the same
[3:43] group they had to roll their name in the
[3:45] lamb's book of life
[3:47] before the foundation
[3:49] of the world
[3:52] because my name
[3:54] and your name is connected with him
[3:57] he must have come down
[3:59] he must redeem you he must deliver you
[4:03] he must heal you and he must take you to
[4:06] the heavenly place he must take you to
[4:09] the body change
[4:11] because your name
[4:13] is connected it always is
[4:15] the same god that before the foundation
[4:17] of the world
[4:19] calls your name and wrote down the
[4:21] lamb's book of life from the foundation
[4:23] of the world has already made a place in
[4:26] glory for you and when this works the
[4:29] tabernacle be dissolved we have a one
[4:32] already waiting for us
[4:34] in the way his affection there you are
[4:37] that's the gospel
[4:42] when he predestined anything to happen
[4:46] let a musician come and see that he will
[4:48] happen
[4:49] he knows
[4:51] that seed will be there just at that
[4:53] time
[4:54] he predestinated her bride
[4:57] she's going to be there
[4:59] going to be a rapture she's going to be
[5:02] there he predestinated about his foreign
[5:05] knowledge there's nothing going to stop
[5:07] him
[5:10] oh thank god
[5:13] thank god what a name
[5:16] that above our name
[5:18] that he connected us with him
[5:21] why we have
[5:22] put under the spirit of that we're doing
[5:24] now
[5:25] why we pray why we become a desperate
[5:29] why we are
[5:31] praying fast to pray them fast and
[5:34] burdened for our loved ones the burden
[5:36] of our children because the foreign
[5:39] knowledge of a god
[5:40] isn't coming to his end because the time
[5:43] isn't running out it doesn't make us a
[5:45] fear but he doesn't make us in our heart
[5:48] just burdened
